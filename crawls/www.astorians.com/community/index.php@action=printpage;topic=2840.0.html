				Megc and Daisy, be glad you went to the pool this afternoon. I was a little too quick in my praise yesterday of the Astoria Pool.&nbsp; I&#39;m going to post the letter I&#39;m writing to Vallone&#39;s office in a little bit but for now I will tell you that I stood in line for 3 hours, did NOT get into the pool and a huge riot and a raid of the swimsuit vendor ensued near the end, but right now I&#39;m getting in a cold shower.

				Yes, please tell. What a teaser! What could have happened to cause a riot at the Astoria Park Pool?! <br /><br />Did the swimsuit vendor run out of tankini tops? Or perhaps the shower inspector was being too stringent and making everyone double-shower? Or could it be that the Con Ed president tried to sneak in a dip disguised as a regular Astoria pool-goer and then got attacked by angry mobs and took the swimsuit vendor and the shower inspector down with him? I&#39;m so intrigued...<br /><br />Megc &amp; Daisy - did you make it in and out of the pool unscathed today?

				What the hell happened???&nbsp; I&#39;m confused!!!&nbsp; I went at 1pm and there was no line at all and went in with a breeze.&nbsp; No one said anything to me, even the shower rule was foregone due to the ultra hot water.&nbsp; I left at 3pm when they kicked us all out for the end of session one, so I don&#39;t know what happened after that.&nbsp; There were a lot of people there though.&nbsp; NycTexas, do tell!!&nbsp; What happened???

				This letter is really long so I hope it is okay to post it here. Needless to say that I will be in line in plenty of time tomorrow for the pool. Daisy I will prob be there by at least 3:30. I know most of you think I am really nice and sweet, with my Texas twang and all, but you would have seen a much different side of me yesterday!&nbsp; :evil:

				Dear Council Member Vallone,<br /><br />I would like to tell you what happened at the Astoria Park swimming pool yesterday (Wednesday) during the record-breaking heat wave.<br /><br />I arrived at the pool at 5:00 pm and the line was almost to the end of the park. It started moving and within 40 minutes I was at the corner of the building just 3 steps from the entrance gate. At this time the security guards came out and started shouting for us all to go home because the pool is closed. It was 5:45 pm. This was the first sign of an employee I had seen during my 40-minute wait. As the crowd grew restless and shouted back questions the guards ignored everyone and walked back inside the gate, which was then closed. The sentiment going through the crowd was that the pool was open until 8:00 pm and everyone was staying in line hoping to get inside. <br /><br />At this point I had been in line for more than an hour and called 311 to make a complaint. While I was on the phone to 311, two of the female security guards, now in their street clothes and leaving for the day, were shouting that we were all “fools for hanging around because there was no way we were getting in because the pool was full to capacity.” I shouted (to be heard over the crowd) to her that if people came out won’t people be let in? She addressed me with a racial slur (she is black, I am white) and told me to f**k off and to shut my mouth. This happened while I was on the phone to 311. I asked her name and she looked at me and laughed. The crowd was not happy with her response. I should also mention that while waiting at the top of the stairs we all noticed that a portion of the pool was closed for lap swimming – there were TWO people swimming laps while 500 or more waited to get inside the pool This did not go over well either. <br /><br />Now it is about 6:15 pm and still no one has come out to address the 500 or so people waiting fairly patiently in line. This entire time the police assigned to the pool were nowhere in sight. The crowd started to become more restless and a couple of shouting/pushing matches broke out but nothing major - yet. <br /><br />The people waiting in line were very orderly but as time passed more and more “line jumpers” crowded the front gate area while all of the blue-shirted “staff” and the green-shirted “parks and recreation” people talked among themselves or on their cellphones ignoring the questions from the crowd. The employees did nothing to keep these people back from this area and the throng continued to grow. People continued to exit the pool but no one else was allowed entry. <br /><br />At 6:45 pm the lifeguards started blowing their whistles for everyone to exit the pool. The crowd outside was relieved because we thought everyone inside was going to made to leave so we, who had been waiting for 2 hours, could go to the pool. <br /><br />As people were ready to exit, the employees still did nothing and soon the waiting area outside the locker rooms was stuffed with people trying to get out. Instead of opening the main gates for people to leave they were being directed to a back exit. I started shouting “Miss, Miss” to the young female employee (blue-shirt) who had been on her cellphone for the past hour and a half. She looked at me and kept talking. I shouted “Sir, Sir” to a green-shirted man. He ignored me. So I started cussing like a sailor screaming as loud as I could that we wanted to know the name of the person who shut down the pool when the Mayor said it was open until 8 pm. My cussing finally got the man’s attention in the green-shirt. He came near the gate and I told him we all wanted to know the person’s name. He gave me a good, long sarcastic look and said “Edgar the Lifeguard”. Then turned around to another employee and said “That bitch thinks she’s gonna get a name - please.”&nbsp; When he turned around I saw his name was Mr. Ward.&nbsp; The employee on the cellphone stared at me while she talked loudly to another employee about how much she hated white people. The Hispanic man waiting in front of me become so angry that he started yelling at her for talking to me like that - he said this made him more mad than not being let into the pool. Now many of us were clamoring for the name of someone in charge, every time the employee&nbsp; would just give us dirty looks or would turn their backs and walk away. <br /><br />By this time I had made a second call to 311 to make another complaint and I told them the situation was about to get out of hand and that the cops were nowhere, the employees were ignoring us and someone needed to be in charge. I debated whether to call 911, and in retrospect I should have, but really didn’t want to get on the bad side of the crowd by calling in the law. I encouraged everyone to call 311 to file a complaint and to call your office. <br /><br />Meanwhile we are all standing there watching people leave, the pool is empty and there is still an hour of swim time left. Still the gates remained shut and&nbsp; the employees ignored the crowd. The situation had reached a boiling point. <br /><br />Someone threw a half-empty bottle of water into the gated area at one of the guards but it hit a little girl in the foot. The mother starts shouting at the crowd and throws the bottle back, which opened up a floodgate of trash, food and plastic bottles being hurled back and forth over the gate. Still no cops. Then POP, POPPOP - just like everyone says it sounded like a firecracker. The people go berserk, half of them trying to get out of there and the other half becoming a&nbsp; mob which attack and loot the swimsuit vendor completely destroying his tables, tent, racks and merchandise. Still no cops. <br /><br />I stay by the gate, not wanting to get trampled and now very determined to get some names of the inept pool employees. Now the cops arrive. Not the cops assigned to the pool, they are still inside somewhere. About a dozen officers show up and keep telling the 20 or so people still at the gate that THE POOL IS CLOSED and for us to leave. We tell the cops we want names and they just keep trying to get us to leave. POP, POPPOP, POP - cops start scrambling up the hill to the sidewalk and all hell breaks loose again up there. Then some of the pool cops exit the screen door which I assume leads to the pool offices. They didn’t actually come out of the gates though, they stayed inside the pool area. They also ignored the questions about who was in charge.<br /><br />Many of us continued to try to talk to the employees about who is in charge, trying to get names of people and we were totally ignored. I tried to get the girl’s name who “hates white people” but 3 employees told me they weren’t going to give out ANY names. Finally at about 7:30 pm we managed to talk to Venice Smith, who didn’t want to take any responsibility either when she said “I’m just one of the supervisors.” She did tell me the girl’s name on the cellphone was LaToya Argo. And then refused to answer any other questions.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Now, Mr. Vallone, I understand that the pool had reached capacity but surely this isn’t the first time. Isn’t there a better system that is more fair to the majority? <br /><br />Ultimately blame has to be placed on the heads of the pool/park staff and the police.. If they had done their job by keeping the crowd more informed in a more positive way and keeping the gate area clear, the situation would not have gotten so out of control. And the police should have been there for crowd control. What are the employees there for? They aren’t lifeguards - they don’t clean the locker area - what is it they do besides sit around (yes, there are chairs there for all the employees to lounge in), talk on their cellphones, hurl racial/rude comments at their customers and collect city wages? Why were we treated like this when Mayor Bloomberg tells us over and over to turn off the air conditioners and “head to the pool”?<br /><br />I appreciate everything you are trying to do for the residents of Queens after we suffered through the week-long blackout. I hope you can do something about the Astoria Pool situation as well. <br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Cathy Albright<br />(address deleted for posting)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Wow. What the heck is going on with Astoria? Has it always been this bad or am I just noticing it now? It almost feels like the city&#39;s trying to get people to leave by treating us like second-class citizens. This is such a calm, friendly place, and we&#39;re being treated horribly lately.

				I went to the pool Tuesday hoping for adult lap swim but expecting extended hours.<br /><br />They let regular swim continue on until 7:40 (adult lap swim usually starts at 7:00) and after the exodus from the pool, I asked a life guard about lap swim.&nbsp; She reported there had been &quot;some sort of riot&quot; on Tuesday as well which prompted them to extend the swim time until 7:40 and cancel lap swim.&nbsp; The lifeguards had ejected the entire crowd from the pool earlier in the day and the extra 45 minutes of swim were added on as a peace keeping measure.<br /><br />The times seemed arbitrary.&nbsp; The riots are weird.&nbsp; It seems like the pool just makes up it&#39;s own rules at the moment.<br /><br />I checked around for extended hours/lap swim info on heat emergency days -- and usually, as I understand it, the pool hours are extended until 7:30 (1/2 an hour) and lapswim is bumped back 1/2 an hour (starting at 7:30) -- which conflicts with nyc.gov&#39;s announcement that pools would be open until 8:00pm.&nbsp; Confusing.<br /><br />Anyhow I didn&#39;t even try for adult swim yesterday.<br /><br />Send the letter to the mayor as well!&nbsp; <br /><br />cheers,<br />jayme

				I went Tuesday as well but things were a lot better. I got there about 4 and was in the pool before 4:30. They did make everyone get out for just a few minutes when some people playing too rough in the pool wouldn&#39;t heed the lifeguards warnings. But that was only about 10 minutes. I left about 7:30 so I didn&#39;t see anything bad happen on Tuesday - I was so impressed but that bubble was quickly burst yesterday!<br /><br />One of the things that really made me mad yesterday was how all of the employees were trying to act like they were SO F**KING overworked - that &quot;supervisor&quot; Venice especially. We had watched her for a while sitting around, laughing, drinking her water while we were all standing there sweltering and smelling the ever-growing stench of b.o. When she finally comes to the gate she is constantly wiping her non-sweating face with a rag and trying to make a face like she is dying a tortured death and acts like she can barely speak. We had been hearing her loud mouth talk about what idiots we were for 2 hours.....Then I say something about her speaking up and SHE wants to tell ME about how hot SHE is? Please - me and about 5 other people tell her that if she didn&#39;t want to work outside in the heat TO GET ANOTHER JOB and not tell us about it. I mean I don&#39;t see the Con Ed people with their protective work uniforms acting like this so I don&#39;t think someone who I have seen sitting for 2 hours in the shade should act like this. It was so ridiculous. But I&#39;ll be damned if it keeps me from trying to get into the pool again today!

				That remains to be seen. Vallone has nothing to gain by helping anyone in this situation. (Unless it can be tied to the blackout somehow) <br /><br />Ive written letter to him and his staff before. His staff is about as caring as Ward, and Argo. (whatever their names are)&nbsp;

				Oh my gosh! &nbsp;Are they that disorganized? &nbsp;Just what is its capacity? &nbsp;You would think with that many employees and cops on hand they would be able to run an orderly operation. &nbsp;105 degrees is a prime environment to make anyone&#39;s normally calm temperament rise. &nbsp;Nyctexas, thanks for writing in about the riot, you should send a copy to the mayor as well, and our other reps - Gioia and Generis(?). &nbsp;I wish someone had had a camera on them, maybe this is why no cameras are allowed - so we can&#39;t document their behavior!<br /><br />I can&#39;t make it to the pool today, I have an apt I completely forgot about until today. &nbsp;I hope they have learned a few lessons from yesterday. &nbsp;Racism from anyone distresses me, there was utterly no reason that should have been brought into it. &nbsp;They should all be fired and everyone should be trained on crowd control, racial sensitivity, and how to run an orderly operation.<br /><br />The pool was very crowded yesterday around 1pm when I went, and the kids were jumping in all over the place, but it was still relatively calm and what you&#39;d expect from kids excited to be in the pool on a really hot day. &nbsp;I would love an adult only section but that&#39;s not likely to happen. &nbsp;I though it was remarkably clean for a public pool, and every child and person that bumped into me said sorry. &nbsp;It&#39;s definitely more a place to cool down than to relax, too loud for relaxing, and no loungechairs, just concrete. &nbsp;The only weird thing I saw was the mother nursing her kid (he had to be almost or already 2 yrs old) right in the water. &nbsp;I know it&#39;s a natural thing, but in the water??

				Hey Cathy!<br />Great letter - I would follow it up with a phone call on Monday - ask for the Chief of Staff and you&#39;ll get either him or referred to the right person (who has been assigned your complaint). &nbsp;You should also send a copy to both the NYC Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe and to the Queens Borough Parks Commissioner. &nbsp;I&#39;ll track down their addresses and emails and get them to you via pm. &nbsp;Calling the media wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea either - it puts the spotlight on things.<br />Gioia&#39;s District starts at Broadway East of Steinway and 34th Avenue West of Steinway.&nbsp; I think the pool is actually in Assemblywoman Cathy Nolan&#39;s district instead of Gianaris.&nbsp; I&#39;ll see if I can verify that.

Our tax dollars are going to hire people who yell racial epithets while on the job???<br /><br />Another person who should DEFINITELY know about this is whoever is in charge of the parks department (I assume the parks dpt does the hiring for the pools).<br /><br />Looked up you - you can send a message to the commissioner here:<br /><br />http://www.nycgovparks.org/contact_us/html/contact.html

				Cathy I commend your tenacity and integrity in this matter. THEY (the negligent, ignorant &quot;employees&quot; and supervisors) are in the wrong and I agree that there should be a stink made about it all. <br /><br />However, I would also encourage you to keep your safety in mind as well. Going back to the pool today may get your point across but if the same bigots are there, reinforced with their self-righteous stupidity, there could be trouble! Be careful! Its a volatile situation.<br /><br />What I&#39;ve learned about new york city is: heat + ignorance = belligerence (and rioting, apparently). Especially at Astoria Pool. I was there during the <em>last</em> big <strong>city-wide blackout (August 2003)</strong> and it was <strong>chaos</strong>. No one was hurt but the management and police at the pool were all absent. Every man/woman/child for himself when the panic set in. <br /><br />That place is a lawless land. Fun for some, but no better than a third-world watering hole to me. I admire your diligence in creating change there.<br />&nbsp;<br />Hope you fare well and prevail!<br />annie<br /><br />

				The townhall is a PSC (Public Service Commission) event - they regulate Con Ed, so it&#39;s just power issues, but the situation at the pool should be brought to the attention of local elected officials, the Mayor and the Parks Department.<br />It&#39;s good to see that Curbed has picked it up, but the comments are snarky.&nbsp; Cathy&#39;s letter was very well written and intelligent and should be taken seriously.

				I went to the pool Wednesday after work with my three year old son; probably arrived at the pool around 6:45 or so.&nbsp; It looked like a refugee crisis at the front entrance:&nbsp; a mob of sweaty, exhausted people clutching bottles of water and beach towels.&nbsp; I saw the &#39;line&#39; wasn&#39;t moving whatsoever so I went up to the entrance and saw that the gates were completely closed.&nbsp; The tension and anger in that area was palpable, so I grabbed my son and went to check out the pool from the observation decks; only to see that the pool was completely empty.&nbsp; The pool stayed empty the entire time.&nbsp; <br /><br />What a waste of a pool on a 100-degree day.&nbsp; Needless to say, my son didn&#39;t take the &quot;no pool today&quot; news very well, but the utter incompetence in the pool employees letting us know just what the hell was going on is baffling.<br /><br />&nbsp;:?

				I can talk for days.......you have been warned....<br /><br />Y&#39;all are so awesome!! I&#39;m so glad I know y&#39;all! <br /><br />I lol when I read the comments on Curbed - I don&#39;t have a problem with other folks opinion. enigmacat you&#39;re right they were silly. No worries anyway, I&#39;m pretty thick-skinned. I was in the military so I&#39;ve had my fair share of encounters with a**holes. Ya know sticks and stones.... :-D<br /><br />And I know it&#39;s weird that I stuck around that long but like I said the first hour was desperation from the heat and by that time I was 3 STEPS - t-h-r-e-e steps, not Giant steps...just three Momma Bear steps...I could see the water and it was a magnet. Then the journalist in me kicked in and I wanted to know the ending to the story. (I actually got a couple of lousy pics on my cellphone of the madness.) Then my hard-headedness set in, which my husband can tell you is unrelenting. <br /><br />Anyway, I took my statement to Vallone&#39;s office today planning on just dropping it off. Rang the bell, told &#39;em what I wanted and when I got up there Vallone came out and greeted me. He and his staff were very nice to me. He said I was the only person at the pool who had contacted him. Masonicboom please call or email his office with what you saw and how we were treated and anyone else PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE call/write/email. (McDirk those emails would be awesome.)<br /><br />He was actually getting ready for the ConEd meeting and couldn&#39;t read my tome immediately but did want to know briefly what happened &amp; when the cops got there. I told him about the POP...he said he hadn&#39;t heard anything about gunshots. Was it? I don&#39;t know. I do know that, before those few seconds of chaos, and before the cops had to scramble up the hill, there were no other sounds like that and imho I don&#39;t think a lot of folks bring illegal fireworks to the swimming pool. It&#39;s not like there was a GUN BATTLE or anything,&nbsp; :-o and I was totally to the rear of the madness because everyone was trying to get <em>out</em>. I was at the gate wishin I could finish <em>melting </em> already, ooze under the barricade and flow to the water!! awwww, what relief it would have been....<br /><br />Just like I said, one second the trash throwing, next second POPing noises...crowd freaks, the poor swimsuit guy is desecrated, two minutes later cops there telling the 50 or so people still at the gate to leave and POPing noises...all the cops scramble up the steps/hill, (and let me tell ya, LMAO, some of &#39;em were regretting all those donuts and lattes) more chaos up there and then everyone was gone except the 15/20 of us who wanted some damn answers! <br /><br />Before it started getting out of hand I had kinda rallied the people near me in line telling them to please call 311 etc and complain and not to be lemmings, we can make a difference, blah blah and people were actually conversing whereas before they were just grumbling...and yes I was one of the few white people there - but it was just like Queens, man, diverse - all colors, all ages. And there was definite anti-police sentiment which made me think twice about calling 911 and having the crowd turn on me! However as soon as the chaos happened I regretted NOT calling 911. For the record I emphasized to 311 TWICE that they needed someone for crowd control. I mean really you would have thought there were no employees there - that is how fully everyone was ignored. It was crazy. <br /><br />As far as swimming with all those folks - I&#39;ve been a lot of places and honestly, uh, taken baths in dirtier tubs which didn&#39;t even have the benefit of chlorine or monitoring! However when I see people sucking water into their mouths to spray out I&#39;m thinking about alllllll the pee!&nbsp; :-P<br /><br />I&#39;ll let ya know if I hear anything. <br /><br />What I CAN hear right now is the sound of my husband smacking his forehead when he reads my statement and see&#39;s that it&#39;s getting attention! LOL, just kidding. He likes it. <br /><br />You guys rock and I can&#39;t wait to see ya again.&nbsp; (Zips mouth, locks it) eh promife nod dew dulc ud ull.

Didn&#39;t get here till 4 pm and, uh, I&quot;m not a TOTAL idiot. So I got my nails done&nbsp; :-) However, I am going to the pool at 10:00 am Friday come hell or high, uh...water, wait, what? well, never mind.<br /><br />

You know, the same places that usually pay slave wages. <br /><br />I feel I make my donations when the tax man cometh, when the landlord cometh, when life in NYC cometh. And if I didn&#39;t go <em>all</em> the time I might feel a tinge of guilt. And if I didn&#39;t know that the 100 people in front of me and the 100 people behind me probably are all going to pay full admission. <br /><br />We&#39;ve lived here for a year and I&#39;ve been to the Met over 50 times. My friend Nancy has lived here for 6 years and hadn&#39;t gone until today.

When my niece was here and I was really broke we went every day they were open for two weeks straight. (She devoured the Egyptian wing.) We would pack pb&amp;j&#39;s, go when they opened, take a stroll in the afternoon looking at the jewels on Madison Ave, eat and then go back. I wouldn&#39;t be able to do this if I paid $1 each time much less $15 or $20. Take heart in knowing I spread my cheapness around - NYPD museum, Bronx Zoo, etc. <br /><br />And I do appreciate the fruits of your labor!. I always think about that Marta!

They said they usually just get a basic account of events from employees when things happen so they really seemed to appreciate the customers viewpoint. My long-windedness (is that a word?) came in handy for once! Anyway they said disciplinary action will be taken and the situation is causing some major recoordination and investigation. I made sure to tell them that I was at the pool on Tuesday and what a great experience it was and how impressed I was with the pool operation, etc.

				We&#39;re all cynics at heart, but I guess it makes you feel good to know that city agencies can sometimes get it right.&nbsp; Kudos.&nbsp; <br /><br />BTW:&nbsp; You gotta love the investigator&#39;s name.&nbsp; Classic.

				Just got home (because the awesomely outspoken Cathy was nice enough to provide a group of us with a Trivial Pursuit set!) but it&#39;s great to see action being taken. Cathy&#39;s original letter got all over the place, which made people curious, and so local politicians are responding. <br /><br />Sure, there are more important things in life than being able to get into the public pool, but when it&#39;s 100 + degrees out, I don&#39;t believe anyone can think of any,&nbsp; so yay for attention being drawn to these city employees and their behavior.
