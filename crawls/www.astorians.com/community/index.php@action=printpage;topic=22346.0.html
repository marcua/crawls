				My husband and I have lived in Manhattan for 8+ years.&nbsp; We’re looking to move to Queens for a bigger space and less $$.&nbsp; We have some friends in Astoria and have always liked visiting, so we thought this would be a good place for us.&nbsp; Although we’ve visited our friends there, they all live in very different areas of Astoria, so we’ve never really been able to get a great sense of what the different areas bring to the table.&nbsp; We’re looking for something that’s convenient transportation wise (hopefully less than a 10 min walk to the subway).&nbsp; We’d like to be somewhat close to the fun restaurants, bars, etc that Astoria has to offer, but we do not want to live in the heart of all that action.&nbsp; (We currently live on a main avenue and it’s very noisy.)&nbsp; An outdoor space would be awesome, but we also want some sort of new construction, or at least, some place where we’re not going to get visitors of the small insect or rodent variety.&nbsp; Any information would be helpful.&nbsp; We’re looking for a 2 bedroom, in the $1800-2400 range.&nbsp; We also plan to have a car, so some access to parking (be it street or garage that doesn’t cost an insane amount of money) would be great.&nbsp; &nbsp;Any suggestions on our dream neighborhood in Astoria? Does it exist?

				For that price range you can certainly get a new apartment. I suggest you look into two/three-family homes, most of them have balconies. It sounds like you would like 31st Ave. or the Ditmars area (not Ditmars proper but the surrounding avenues/streets). Don&#039;t know about parking, I won&#039;t lie - that is difficult in Astoria, but many people do have cars so it&#039;s not impossible. I suggest you ask about it when apartment-hunting. I would avoid areas near the water because they are far from the subway and bus service can be spotty.<br /><br />Good luck!<br />

				If you are willing to add a little walk to your commute, you will get a really good apartment for that price. I live on 42nd street in the ditmars area, so I have a 12-14 min walk to the subway (depends on how lazy I get). For that walk I have an older two bedroom on the 2nd floor for a few hundred less than even your lower price. By the time you get to $2400 you should be able to have a newer unit, a balcony, a washer perhaps even in the unit, and certainly a parking spot. People in my area do park on the street and except for Tuesday and Wednesday nights (when cars have to be moved for street cleaning) there is always a spot, often right outside my place.&nbsp; People also rent out their garages, and the price is between $100-$150 per month, depending on the owner and the spot. If you move in the less than 10 min walk area, prices go up and parking does get more difficult, but I think $2400 is still doable.

				The 40&#039;s and up&nbsp; on the Ditmars area is a great place to live cuz its not that far from all the bars and food places but its located in a quiet and not busy area . You wont encounter much traffic or noise here like you would on Broadway and 30th ave where all the nightlife is located . I wouldnt live there if you paid me . But im sure some 20 yr olds might .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Parking isnt easy but in those areas like Lykourgos said ,its not bad .&nbsp; You might have your hit and miss nights where its a little tough , but you will get the hang of it . Garages are more around the 150-200 range . Never heard of a garage for 100 .&nbsp; A driveway spot is even more than 100 these days .&nbsp; &nbsp;I would look for something newer since they also tend to be larger and much more updated .&nbsp; &nbsp;Since your price range is around 2k+&nbsp; you should look into the Pistilli building located on ditmars and 47st&nbsp; right by the shopping plaza . Its a newer building and while it didnt get the best reviews for buyers ,&nbsp; renters shouldnt have a problem . The apts are pretty nice and most 2 bedrooms are around your range .&nbsp;
