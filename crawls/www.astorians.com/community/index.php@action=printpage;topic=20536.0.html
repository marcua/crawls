				I&#039;ve been snacking on sharp cheddar this afternoon. Later this evening I&#039;ll cook a Delmonico steak and roast some potatoes, probably in a mix of olive oil and duck fat. Maybe chocolate chip cookies for dessert.<br /><br />Pastured chicken stock is bubbling on the stove - it smells amazing. I&#039;ll let it simmer though the night, and strain it tomorrow.

Stopped at Sal, Kris &amp; Charlie&#039;s to get a hero for lunch (Italian Combo, yes to the hot peppers, nom nom nom). I just ate the other half a little while ago for dinner.

				Hmm...sounds like some newfangled concoction out of Los Angeles.&nbsp; :?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been thinking off and on about this all day! I&#039;ve had home made kimchee over freshly cooked japanese&nbsp; rice and it was delicious. Now how the heck do you eat kimchee with chili. Is it on the side? Or is it presented to the diner draped over the bowl of chili with grated cheddar sprinkled liberally on the kimchee and then srirred in before eating?<br /><br />Please elaborate.

Blood orange for dessert.<br /><br />I had a Rosario&#039;s dinner tonight - half a rice ball with tomato sauce, a few slices of fresh mozzarella dipped in balsamic, some amazing cracked Sicilian olives, a half dozen slices of sweet sopresatta, and a small glass of red wine.

				Joey threw it out because of the e coli scare. :-D<br /><br />Last night I made a pot of Mexican chicken soup. We enjoyed it with a Greek salad on the side. Gotta have my fix of dodonis feta (from Mediterranean Mart) every day. We&#039;ll have the same tonight.<br /><br />Have to give a shout out to Trader Joe&#039;s for the yummy meal because their corn tortillas (for the soup) are natural- made with only white corn, water and lime. The Greek salad had TJoe&#039;s &quot;kumatos&quot; which are purple tomatoes and are the tastiest on the market. The dressing is simply a little T Joe&#039;s Spanish olive oil drizzled on the salad because it&#039;s so delicious-not bitter, not bland-really tastes like olives!<br /><br />This morning for breakfast I had a whole wheat wrap with Trader Joe&#039;s peanut butter made with just dry roasted peanuts and salt. Stays nice and thick if kept in the fridge.<br /><br />Sounds like a commercial for Trader Joe&#039;s, right?<br /><br /><br />

				Today for breakfast I made crepes with egg and ham, folded into triangles (my son loves this)<br />For lunch I had FAGE plain yogurt with honey<br />For dinner I made a Cuban dish called &quot;Vaca Frita&quot; translated in english its &quot;Fried Cow&quot;, and white rice.&nbsp; It&#039;s made with shredded beef, lots and lots of onions, salt, pepper, and lemon juice (lemon juice very important).&nbsp; You simmer the onions first in olive oil (I use Pegasus greek extra virgin olive oil) and when the onions are tender (slice the onions thin long strands) add the shredded beef (you get the shredded beef by boiling beef that you use for stew until it&#039;s very tender then you take the pot, sit at the table, grab a plate, and one by one shred the beef by hand), add 1/2 cup of lemon juice, salt, pepper to taste and let it cook until the beef starts getting crispy.

				Mmmm, sounds tasty! Thanks for sharing your technique. I&#039;ll have to try this dish. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s full of flavor, but does the beef get chewy after frying? I hope I don&#039;t have to run out and buy extra floss.<br /><br />Oh, today I made (ersatz) chicken vindaloo, with white basmati rice.

				No, you&#039;re suppose to let it fry until it almost gets crispy (not burnt).&nbsp; With this dish you do need to whip out the floss.....<br /><br />What you made sounds awesome!!!!!!!&nbsp; :tongue:

				For dinner I had a salad made of CSA vegetables - lettuce, oregano, scallions - and blue cheese and pine nuts, with a homemade maple vinegar and olive oil vinaigrette. Accompanying that was some local duck simply pan roasted with a simple mixture of sumac and olive oil brushed on it. CSA strawberries for dessert and a trip to La Guli for a small shared stracciatella gelato.
