				Radicchio works well in salad - if you&#39;ve ever had a mixed greens salad that has a stiff, red, somewhat bitter leaf mixed in, you&#39;ve had radicchio.<br /><br />Here (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/find/results?search=radicchio&amp;x=0&amp;y=0) are the results for a radicchio recipe search on Epicurious.&nbsp; The first result, a radicchio, green bean and walnut salad makes me think of adding radicchio to the cold and spicy green bean and carrot salad I was contemplating making.<br /><br />Flooz - the salad has cooked green beans and carrots, but they&#39;re crisp-cooked, not limp, so maybe you&#39;d like it?<br /><br />I&#39;m not posting the recipe for the moment because I&#39;m still trying to find it....

				Radicchio is good split into quarters, coated with olive oil and grilled.<br /><br />You can also separate the leaves from the head and put 1 tablespoon of blue cheese and a bit of toasted walnut in each leaf. Broil for about 5 minutes, until the leaves wilt, and then roll them up and secure with toothpicks. Serve with red grapes. Yum.<br /><br />It also makes a great stirfry with snow peas and olive oil - I think anzubird showed me that. The sweetness of the peas balances the bitterness of the raddichio.

If i could make a monster salad with everything from the csa for tonight and tomorrow that would just rock my world!!!! since we&#39;re leaving town for 4 days i would rather eat it all up now then let it sit in the fridge and maybe not make it till we get back&nbsp; :-(

				I usually just cook up radicchio with onions and olive oil. And throwing snow peas in there does work really well too.<br /><br />I also had a recipe at some point for a pasta with a radicchio, shrimp and tomato sauce... shrimp being another thing that does a really good job of balancing the bitterness of the radicchio.
