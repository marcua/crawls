				Suprised they weren&#039;t found guilty of reckless endangerment....I mean, 50 shots! But otherwise, I agree. It&#039;s sad, but Cops are people, they aren&#039;t perfect. They make mistakes, and sadly, these mistakes can lead to terrible results. The prosecutions chief witness was far from credible considering his state at the time of the incident.

				50 shots? Come on that is extremely excessive don&#039;t you think? Yes, cops are people and they make mistakes. I have a lot of respect for them and what they do.

For someone who is supposedly trained in firearms, 50 shots means a lot more. It illustrates a different intent than simply firing off one shot that killed someone. <br />Like I said, I don&#039;t know what the details are about the case, but there was obviously some evidence that was able to convince a judge that 50 shots was justifiable in that situation.<br /><br />What I cannot agree with on this matter is the knee-jerk reactions from both sides. The community leaders quickly up in arms to call these cops racists because they shot a black man and shouting racial injustice is dumb to me. <br />I feel for the Bell family. It&#039;s a terrible tragedy that according to the courts, was unavoidable. I actually didn&#039;t know that you were able to waive your right to a jury and simply be tried by a judge in cases like this. It definitely worked in this case because judges are more sympathetic towards people on the law enforcement side considering what they deal with day in and day out. <br />

Yes Sean Bell and his friends had criminal records, and yes I think it&#039;s wrong that they are being portrayed as angels by some outlets, but at least those cops should have been convicted of reckless endangerment. at LEAST they should have had to pay damages to Bell&#039;s kids.

				The standard of proof in a criminal case is much higher than in a civil suit -- though they were acquitted, they may still be found liable for damages under a less strict standard.<br /><br />The prosecutor dropped the ball on this case, whether intentionally or unintentionally. The prosecution witnesses had criminal histories, making for impeachment material by the defense. The prosecution witnesses&#039; stories contradicted each other, making for reasonable doubt. Remember, the defense can sit back and say nothing, it&#039;s the prosecutor&#039;s burden to prove the case. That they didn&#039;t prove their case doesn&#039;t mean the cops are innocent, it just means they weren&#039;t proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. When there are inconsistencies in testimony, when there are motives to lie and a shady criminal history, the judge is going to find reasonable doubt. And while any defense attorney (and most prosecutors) can tell you cops lie, for some reason, judges haven&#039;t quite gotten that memo yet. Cops will almost always be believed over civilians.<br /><br />It&#039;s outrageous from a social standpoint to think these cops can get away with this, but from a legal standpoint, I can see how that happened. <br /><br />As for the victims being bad guys in a bad place, that&#039;s just wrong. Even &quot;bad guys&quot; have civil rights, including the right to not be shot at by overzealous, trigger happy, ill-equipped to handle high pressure situation, cops.

But, let there&nbsp; be an incident, where &#039;excess&#039;&nbsp; force seems to be used and the press and&nbsp; the &#039;race&nbsp; hustlers&#039; come&nbsp; pouring into the streets. I don&#039;t know what happened&nbsp; here, I wasn&#039;t there, but, this judge and DA did not prove even manslaughter and reckless endangerment, due to the fact, this was a club known for past criminal, &#039;gun&#039; incidents and&nbsp; the &#039;victims&#039;&nbsp; were using acar to ram&nbsp; the cops. <br />

				The police in question got jittery and wrongly assumed that Bell and his friends were armed. I expected at the very least manslaughter charges. <br /><br />All one has to do is step back and turn the tables to see whether the judgement makes sense. Imagine if there were 3 black police officers casing a club, and a group of white men come out of some dubious club with his friends. The black police come down on the white men in the car and shoot at them 50 times, and one ends up dead. Can you in your wildest of dreams imagine that these cops will be acquited of all charges in the death of an unarmed white man? Of course not. Justice is not blind in spite of our wishes and assurances that it is. I do not see how justice has been served with this verdict. <br /><br />There are numerous instances of white organized crime suspects being surveiled, yet you never hear of even one unarmed white man being shot at 50 times by police.

				I think the race card is BS in this case, and I agree that Sharpton should shut his facehole. <br /><br />I still smell something fishy when 50 bullets are fired at an unarmed man- black, white, hispanic or otherwise.
