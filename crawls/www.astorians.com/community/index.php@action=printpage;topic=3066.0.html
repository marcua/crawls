				As some of you may know, I am an actor/producer living in Astoria and I have been developing some new concepts for television series.<br /><br />The New York Television Festival had a pitch contest - my writing partner (Marissa) and I entered one of our concepts and we made it into the semi-finals! The show is called ASSISTED LIVING and its basically a cross between <em>Golden Girls </em> and <em>Desperate Housewives </em> and it all takes place in an assisted living community. Its gonna be hilarious - but we need your help.<br /><br />It is now up to the public to decide so on <strong>Friday August 25th</strong>, we need you to go to http://tv.msn.com/nytvf/contest/pitch (http://tv.msn.com/nytvf/contest/pitch) and vote for <strong>Joe and Marissa, Assisted Living</strong>. <br /><br />We need your vote! As it seems right now you can do multiple votes so the more you vote the better:)<br /><br />If we get into the top 2 for that day, we make it to the semi-finals where we get to pitch our concept to executives and have a chance to win a development deal with IFC!<br /><br />I&#39;ll send out a reminder on Friday as well. Just wanted to give you a heads up- and remember, <strong>Friday</strong> is the <strong>ONLY day </strong> you can vote for us. So get your vote in by midnight Pacific Standard Time (East Coast has up to 3a.m. to vote) or it won&#39;t count.<br /><br />Thanks everyone!!! :-D<br />-Joe

				Also, on Astorians 3.0, there is a neat little feature... &quot;Show unread posts since last visit.&quot;&nbsp; So if someone replies to this, as a reminder, no matter where it is located, it shows up in that list!!!

				Click on Pitch and then scroll down - it&#39;s on the right hand side (and to vote more than once, you just refresh!) - Joe is in the lead at 30% but it&#39;s tight and there are lots of folks voting repeatedly.
