				If you can get an appointment, I&#039;d recommend Spa Hydra on 36th Street, between 35th &amp; 36th <br />Avenues. I&#039;ve had facials, mani/pedi, eyebrow waxing and massages there and all were top notch.<br /><br />Very professional aestheticians, calm, serene space and very clean. <br /><br />I also gave my sister-in-law a day of beauty there when she married my brother two years ago. <br />I think she did a Brazilian wax as part of it and she said that, as well as her other services, were great.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the website:www.spahydra.com<br />

				Natura Spa, ask for Irina or Marina.&nbsp; It&#039;s $45 for a first time wax (because there&#039;s more hair and it&#039;s harder to do), $30 thereafter.&nbsp; If it&#039;s your first time, I&#039;d recommend Irina because Marina speaks mainly portuguese, and you may want to communicate that it&#039;s your first time.&nbsp; They take you into a private room, and it&#039;s very clean.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been going there for 3 years.&nbsp; You can just walk in there and they&#039;ll do it for you without an appointment.&nbsp; You could make an appointment, but I find I always end up waiting just as long (or longer) with an appointment.&nbsp;
