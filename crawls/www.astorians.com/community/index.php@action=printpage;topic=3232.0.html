				Okay Astorians, as most of you know I will be departing for points Midwest soon. (I&#39;m going to my first choice grad school for political theory, yay!) <br /><br />I&#39;d love to see as many of you wonderful people as possible before I leave, because you are all awesome and I&#39;ve had a great time living in Astoria. So on Friday, September 8th, come hang out and remind me why Astorians make the best neighbors in NYC.<br /><br />Since Hell Gate Social was so accommodating for our post-black out mixer, I’ve made the executive decision to go back there. They don’t serve food, but they have take-out menus. The drinks are pretty cheap and they have a nice outdoor area. <br /><br />So I hope to see a bunch of you there!<br /><br />-Rachel, who is the original Rachel on the board, now that there are several other Rachels&nbsp; :-)<br />

				I pm&#39;d hellgatesocial about the food and a few other things about the night but they haven&#39;t gotten back to me yet. I was planning on making a couple of things that I have really been craving lately and that are too much trouble to make just for Max and myself. One of them is sausage balls which don&#39;t have any fancy ingredients but no one has ever <em>not</em> liked them. Usually once I make them for a party/whatever that is usually what I&#39;m requested to bring. Haven&#39;t made them since we&#39;ve lived here and I&#39;m really dying for some so I&#39;m bringing them! I figure since they let us bring in food the last time they probably will again.....<br /><br /><br />Rachel we are all sad you are leaving so you better stay in touch! And don&#39;t think we are going to forget about that Chicago EATS trip either!

				Being that this is my event and all I should be on top of these address things. It&#39;s on Astoria Blvd, at 14th street, I think. But I&#39;ll post the address tomorrow. I am uber-inept at trying to organize social gatherings in the midst of a move and landlord drama. Luckily, Hell Gate&#39;s Social has awesome spiked lemonade&nbsp; :-D<br /><br />I was being REALLY silly in my nostalgia this afternoon and claiming I would even miss the N-Train. And then it rained and there were delays and it took me over an hour and a half to get home. So, screw the N-Train!!

				Once you make it past the Astoria Blvd/Hoyt Avenue split, Hell Gate&#39;s is very easy to find. They were awesome for our post-blackout gathering. Any new people should feel welcome, as this is strictly a casual affair and I like giving our local businesses atttention. I mean, everyone already knows alla bout the Beer Garden. This place is more obscure, so we&#39;re ahead of the trends when we take it over.!

				The Q19 on Ditmars does stop quite close to the Hell Gate Social.&nbsp; Get off on Astoria Blvd and 21 St.&nbsp; Ask the bus driver, he&#39;ll let you know when you hit Astoria Blvd.

				Sorry it&#39;s taken so long to post to this thread, couldn&#39;t get on through astorians.com.<br />A few things to add to the thread, this Friday we will be opening @ 5pm, with Happy Hour going on until 7pm. The happy hour will include, $3 beers, house martinis, and well drinks.<br />If JustRachel wants pizza we can order from Astoria Park Pizza on Ditmars, they deliver to us all the time. Also we do not accept credit cards at this time, cash only.<br />And last but not least, we are located @ <br />12-21 Astoria Blvd <br />bet. 14th &amp; 12th Street. <br />Take the N/W to Astoria Blvd and walk towards Manhattan on Astoria Blvd. Look for 2 red lights and a black steel facade.&nbsp; <br />718.204.8313<br />hellgatesocial.com (http://hellgatesocial.com)

				It&#39;s real hard......<br /><br />Breakfast sausage<br />Bisquick<br />Grated cheddar, preferably Longhorn <br />Chopped green chilies<br /><br />Eye<em>ball </em> everything till texture is right. Roll em up, not too big, good space in between cause they expand, bake at 350, don&#39;t burn em, cool and eat em. Feel free to sub jalapenos or any of the other exotic things you foodies mention&nbsp; - y&#39;all could probably turn these Texas balls into an international smorgasbord of balls! <br /><br />I like mine cold and chewy but most people like them warmed up. Sorry, I don&#39;t think HGS wants to nuke my balls so you&#39;ll have to eat them cold. I like my balls plain but some like hot mustard. I hope Uncle Telly reads this post.... <br /><br />Yeah Lanseaux Jimmy Dean has probably caused more Texas heart attacks than any other brand....from this little town near Amarillo - Plainview. Yum it is so good and spiced just right!

It&#39;s a bit of a process at first getting the consistency right, but I could make them in my sleep, I&#39;ve just never measured it.<br />In a BIG bowl you just squeeze the sausage out of the wrapper, add cheese, chilies. Mix this well before you add the &#39;Quick, mix again thoroughly. You have to get your hands in it. Don&#39;t worry,I always use the plastic &quot;cafeteria gloves&quot; for stuff like this. I&#39;m sure a high-dollar mixer could work it, but it&#39;s really thick and cold and too much for my equipment. <br />

				mandaT sorry to say haven&#39;t seen Jimmy Dean &quot;roll&quot; sausage here. In fact the only brand I&#39;ve seen and used is Jones. And just the little short ones, not the 2-foot kind we have in Texas (of course even THAT has to be big). Jimmy Dean alone has like 6 different flavors and then there are the other brands, Owens comes to mind. I think people here must get sausage more from the butcher or something. Or flavored different than in the South? Jones is the only brand I&#39;ve seen at KeyFood, TradeFair, Best Yet or Stop n Shop.<br /><br />I bet Wegman&#39;s has a hell of a selection..... :-)

				You can take the Q19A at the corner of Ditmars and 31st -- the stop in front of Pizza Palace. &nbsp;It turns down 21st St., and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a stop either right at or within a block or two of Astoria Blvd - the bus driver can tell her where.
