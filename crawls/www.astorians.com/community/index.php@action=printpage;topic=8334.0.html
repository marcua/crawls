				Last night we ordered food from the new Mexican restaurant called Guacamole.<br /><br />&nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br />The space is very clean and bright.&nbsp; (They opened 2 weeks ago)<br /><br />The staff is very friendly and bilingual. <br /><br />The food was delicious.&nbsp; Very simple, but very tasty.<br /><br />We sampled the chicken burrito, the beef burrito , the enchiladas rancheras and the kids ate the &quot;kids pie&quot;&nbsp; which was basically a chicken and cheese quesadilla (came with fries and corn).<br /><br />My only&nbsp; complaint is that the guacamole itself, while very yummy and freshly made was too oniony for my personal tastes.<br /><br />Affordable menu and good service.<br /><br />: )

				I&#039;m trying to remember what was in the space before, right next to the liquor store.&nbsp; Was it that dreary looking Mex-American Cafe?

				I work around the corner and i remember the tex mex place. I went in there when it opened and i asked for a take out menu when i opened it there was a dead cockroach inside so i dropped the menu and never went back.<br />Now that this new place opened i went into take a menu and i was very impressed with the menu.<br />Its not the usuall americanised version of Mexican food and i am definitely going to try it after the good reviews here.
