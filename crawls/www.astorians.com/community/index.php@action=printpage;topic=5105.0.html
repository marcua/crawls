				<br />Gov. Eliot Spitzer expressed his extreme ”disappointment” with the Legislature for going against his wishes and making ex-Assemblyman Thomas DiNapoli state comptroller and said he considered this a “turning point” in his relationship with the legislative leaders. <br /><br />He called today’s decision “a stark reminder of all that is wrong with our Legislature and its leadership and what we have so much ground to cover in our efforts to reform Albany.”<br /><br />“You have just witnessed the insider game of self-dealing that unfortunately confirms every New Yorker’s worst fear and image of all that goes on in the Legislature of this state,” Spitzer said. <br /><br />“Legislators and their leaders had an opportunity to rise above and show they have listened, learned, absorbed, but they did just the opposite. They returned to the cocoon of the Albany status quo that has driven their behavior for too long.”<br /><br />Spitzer said the “nature of the relationship” between himself, and&nbsp; Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, D-Manhattan; and Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, R-Brunswick, “will change” as a result of today’s vote.<br /><br />Ased what that means, Spitzer replied: “We will see how it works out.”<br /><br />“We will have to work together,” he continued. “It’s my obligation as governor to work with the Legislature. I will do that. There will be moments of agreement, moments of disagreement. The fact that I’m here right now expressing my disatisfaction this directly, this bluntly, with this particularity clearly envinces my fundamental belief that this is a turning point. Having said that, I will be working them. It is our job. It is our duty. I will do that.”<br /><br />Asked if there would be repercussions for lawmakers who voted against him, Spitzer insisted he didn’t want to talk about “consequences.” He also didn’t want to talk about whether he thought Bruno and Silver should be replaced as leaders as a result of the comptroller vote. <br /><br />“I’m not going to speak to that right now,” Spitzer said. ”I think I have spoken to the disappointment that I feel.”<br /><br />One possible repercussion would be that Spitzer might campaign against lawmakers who turned their backs on him in this fight when 2008 rolls around. The governor said he will campaign against incumbents - Democrat or Republican - when he believes “that there’s a better candidate.”<br /><br />“That’s not because of what happened today,” Spitzer insisted. “That has always been my credo.” <br />
