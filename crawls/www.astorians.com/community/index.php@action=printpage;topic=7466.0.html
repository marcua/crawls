				This isn&#039;t very recent, but I had two b-day dinners there in January and my better half and I celebrated V-day there too. <br />Love the food, decor, ambiance and and the service was each time. It is a little pricey for our budget, but it&#039;s our go-to <br />now for special occasions. They do have a prix fixe dinner - I think -&nbsp; on Sundays for $22. I think it&#039;s a real gem though<br />and hope it&#039;s around for a long time to come (or at least until my next b-day!).<br />

				Went there in April and it was definitely very nice. Hosted my sister&#039;s bridal shower there as well (it was very small- just the aunts.) They didn&#039;t have a/c for the shower, which bothered the luncheoning ladies a bit, otherwise the food is great. It&#039;s not 100% French but a bit of fusion.

				The windows of 718 have been papered over with signs announcing a, &quot;renovation-reopening this summer.&quot; We all know that is code for &quot;it bit the dust, never to return.&quot;&nbsp; Then a couple of days ago the awnings came down.&nbsp; There is another sign regarding &quot;new ownership,&quot; so perhaps another restaurant will bloom at this location. What boggles my mind is how a place like Oceano just keeps on going, when I see nary a soul sitting inside.&nbsp; 718 always had a crowd, so the closure seems baffling.

				In this case, it really is a renovation, but in one sense 718 is gone.&nbsp; They are completely revamping the space/menu/concept, and it&#039;s going to have a new name, but it&#039;s the same owners.&nbsp; At one point they told me they were going to be putting in a brick oven for pizzas/tarte flambees.&nbsp; There&#039;s a bit more info on their website: http://www.718restaurant.com/ .

				So far no sign of them re-opening (and it is past mid summer) nor any signs of them renovating (there are no permits up, etc). Just the windows are covered up.<br /><br />Is this one of those cases where &quot;closed for renovations&quot; means &quot;closed for good&quot;?<br />

				No, they are not closed for good.&nbsp; They are completely renovating it to be more like a traditional French bistro.&nbsp; The front is going to be covered in wood, I think, but I don&#039;t know what else they&#039;re planning in terms of design.

				I saw a lot of work happening on the exterior last week.&nbsp; So this sounds promising if that&#039;s true about going more towards true French cuisine.&nbsp; Though from the look of what I saw, I think the outside looked very heavy on the stucco.

				No disrespect to anyone here but I don&#039;t understand why people love this place. Three or four years ago it was pretty good, but I can&#039;t say the same now. Perhaps the chef has changed but the last two times I went it had gotten progressively worse. I wish the new place all the best, but the owner needs to address some issues.

				I agree that they seemed to have lost their way over time.&nbsp; But they obviously poured a lot of money into the place with this massive renovation.&nbsp; It looks beautiful.&nbsp; And I&#039;m generally excited to see Ditmars coming around finally.&nbsp; So I can&#039;t wait to try it once they open.&nbsp; With this much of an effort, I&#039;d be confident that they plan to be nothing like the old 718.

				I must have been lucky. I had 3 lovely dinners there within the space of a month 2 years ago - two for my birthday and<br />one for V-day. Each time the food and the service were wonderful. When things go that well more than once, I&#039;m happy. <br />So I am excited to try the new incarnation. But since my b-day is next week and they don&#039;t seem to be open yet, I&#039;ll<br />chance it maybe for V-day if they&#039;re up and running. And honestly, I&#039;m just glad to see not another burger place opening. <br />When I go out to dinner, I want something special. Hopefully, this new version will do well.
