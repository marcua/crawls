				Just saw this poll/article this morning.&nbsp; A majority of Californians are currently in favor of same sex marriage.&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty interesting.&nbsp; I would imagine the numbers change slightly throughout the campaign for a ballot initiative to ban same sex marriage in the state constitution, but shows steady movement towards support for equality.<br /><br />http://www.sacbee.com/111/story/970055.html

				Not much to add. Do you work on these issues in others states?<br />Who is funding the initiative? Who is working against it?<br /><br /><br />Is this an attempt to bring more conservatives out on election day? If it is, terribly cynical.<br />Would McCain and Gov Terminator speak against it?<br />Could not pass could it?

				I think California is safely in the Democratic column for the Presidential election.<br />Most of the national LGBT groups work on marriage issues across the country, so it&#039;s the same crew on our side, and generally the same cast of characters fighting us on the other side.&nbsp; Human Rights Campaign, Lambda Legal Marriage Equality, National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and local groups vs. Family Resource Council, Liberty Counsel, Focus on the Family, etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m relatively confident the voters are going to reject the amendment (though it&#039;s still early).&nbsp;

				Re: the Democratic platform - It definitely does not advocate for same sex marriage rights, much as I wish it did.&nbsp; I believe in 2008 it called for civil unions, probably will again, though a floor fight is anticipated.<br /><br />In California, the courts have just caught up to the legislature (which has passed same sex marriage bills through BOTH houses of their state legislature only to have them vetoed by the Governor).&nbsp; If there is a referendum, at least it may put the issue to bed once and for all.&nbsp; It still shocks me when civil rights get put to a ballot, either folks are equal or they are not.&nbsp;
