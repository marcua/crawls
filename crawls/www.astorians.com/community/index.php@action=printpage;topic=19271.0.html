				Note to all: I&#039;ve said this before and unfortunately, I guess I have to say it again.&nbsp; Real Estate agents are entirely welcome to post their listings on this website.&nbsp; We do have some criteria, but the listings need not be Astoria-specific.&nbsp; Many real estate agents offer wine, cheese, etc at their open houses, this is nothing new.&nbsp; These listings are not spam.&nbsp; There are many here in the community who appreciate seeing these listings and would like to see more.&nbsp; If you are not looking for an apartment, you need not respond to the ad.&nbsp; Just move on.&nbsp; There is no need for the insulting comments.&nbsp; Marlene is right - All posters here are human beings - the real estate agents included - and they are your neighbors as well.&nbsp; We ask that you treat each other with respect.&nbsp; The negativity isn&#039;t necessary.<br /><br />If you need an overview of the rules regarding real estate listings, please see here:<br />http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=18371.0<br /><br />Thank you.&nbsp; - Daisy (mod)<br />
