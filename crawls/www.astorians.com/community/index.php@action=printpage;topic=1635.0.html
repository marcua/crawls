				Newark for some Portuguese food is definitely worth a field trip.&nbsp; In fact, being able to get Portuguese food delivered on the weekend was one of the few benefits to working on the edge of the Ironbound for 4-1/2 years.

				i&#39;m telling you people, its worth a trip every once in awhile if you really love no holds barred really good food. No sauces to hide anything, no pretentious waitstaff to bother you, you sit right at the bar <em>(or i do anyway)</em> and chomp away with your hands as they keep filling your mug with wine-yes i said mug <em>($1.50 a mug for their generic red, which is better then some of the $6 glasses i&#39;ve had)</em><br /><br />and thanks goldfish boy for the liking of my blog!

				i grew up in nj. my parents would always take us to Newark for special occasion dinners.<br />also... we were catholic and for good friday, we would always treck up there for fishy items for lunch time, and buy a huge fish that we would eat for dinner that day. then many times we would return again on Easter Sunday to have easter meal at one of those fancy places. <br /><br />definitely worth the trip! <br /><br />oh... a couple of Brazilian Rodizio places over there too! &gt;drool&lt;
