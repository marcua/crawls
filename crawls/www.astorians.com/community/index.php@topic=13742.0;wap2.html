			I still miss Valco.&nbsp; The last purchase I made there (a few months before they closed) was a Mego Buck Rogers in the 25th Century &quot;Draco&quot; action figure (from 1979) that had been sitting behind a box for at least ten years.&nbsp; I paid just $2.00 for it and I still have it in my collection (still on the card).<br /><br />In the 70&#039;s, I remember a hobby store on 37th or 38th Street (I think) that had model kits and rocket kits; but I am not referring to the hobby shop on 36th street still in operation (they put old books on the front of the store) and from the inside looks like it was once an old soda shop (complete with a bar).<br /><br />Playworld had a great collection of model kits (an entire section) of every size and scale, including Testor&#039;s brand paint, glue, sandpaper, etc.&nbsp; Their Kenner Star Wars section (figures, playsets, vehicles) was nirvana.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- Quote from: astoria-for-life on January 21, 2009, 06:01:31 AM ---here we go!!!

			Wow, those names bring back some great memories.&nbsp; I used to LOVE going to those stores when I was a kid.&nbsp; When I was good, my Dad would take me there and allow me to buy stuff.&nbsp; It&#039;s too bad those stores went out of business so long ago.<br /><br />Also reminds me of the &#039;ol TSS store across from MPB.&nbsp; I&#039;d just hang out in the sporting goods section for the longest!!&nbsp; Another store I miss.&nbsp;
