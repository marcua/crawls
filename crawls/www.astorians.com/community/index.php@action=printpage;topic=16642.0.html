				Hi all -<br /><br />I am a freelance Museum educator/artist with a wonderful little 7 and a 1/2 month old boy, and I am in desperate need of working out a safe, dependable childcare situation for him that works with my schedule - which is predictable over the long term, but shifts hourly from week to week.&nbsp; <br />Currently I divide our childcare needs between two sitters.&nbsp; One is working like a charm a couple days a week, the other is becoming less and less reliable.&nbsp; My husband and I have been searching now for well over six months for a perfect sitter scenario, but to no avail - either the sitters are way too expensive (requesting $15-$25/hr for one child - which I am told is too much even by Manhattan standards), or they are unable to gel with my variable hours.&nbsp; As I&#039;m sure some of you feel, too, I&#039;d really love to just get settled with sitters and not have to worry about scrambling at the last minute to find a fill-in.<br /><br />The sitter that really works for us is another mother with a relatively flexible part-time schedule (and we&#039;ve agreed on a rate we both feel good about at $10/hr), so this got me thinking...I&#039;ve met several other mothers in the Astoria area that are freelancers and have childcare struggles, too; I wonder if perhaps a childcare swap group fueled exclusively by moms would be the way to go?&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m kind of testing the waters here so to speak.&nbsp; I&#039;m not even sure how this would work - or if schedules would mesh exactly - but I would really love to try and set up a time to meet and chat with anyone who might be interested in this idea.&nbsp; Unfortunately I neglected to get the contact info of the other freelance mothers I&#039;ve spoken with in the past, so hopefully this post will get their attention as well, and we can reconnect.&nbsp; <br /><br />I look forward to hearing from you, mamas!<br /><br />Amanda

				Hi There,<br /><br />I am a freelance choreograher in Astoria and will be having my baby in November.&nbsp; Did you ever find a solution to your problem?&nbsp; Connecting with other freelancers would be extremely helpful to me.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Josie

				Hi - I am hoping to set up exactly this scenario - some kind of freelance mom childcare pool. I&#039;m due in early January, so it will be a few months before I&#039;m ready to do this, but Josie and Amanda, if you are interested I would love to connect and discuss possibilities. <br /><br />Thanks, <br />-Alla

				Wonderful.&nbsp; I&#039;d be happy to help organize as well.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be home with my babe probably through mid January.&nbsp; One thing we could consider doing is createing a yahoogroup that&#039;s just for freelancing parents in astoria.&nbsp; It might be a good way to get this going.

				That&#039;s a great idea. <br /><br />I just checked google groups and found nothing active, but found one active yahoo group for Astoria parents - http://groups.yahoo.com/group/astoriamomsanddads/<br /><br />

				Another freelancer here, with a 10-month old boy. Child care has been kind of an adventure; I&#039;ve had a regular babysitter 3 days a week (whom I found through Sittercity.com) but that does get expensive and doesn&#039;t really provide enough hours!<br /><br />I&#039;m part of the Astoria moms Meetup group (http://www.meetup.com/ASAHMGroup/), which I heartily recommend for networking when you&#039;ve got a tiny baby! I have been trying to help organize a babysitting co-op through that group (hopefully expanding beyond that group eventually). The main intention has not necessarily been for workday sitting, though there&#039;s no reason why that wouldn&#039;t be possible. If you&#039;re interested, I&#039;ll get in touch with you both with any developments.<br /><br />(One thought: taking care of multiple newborns is probably a lot harder than older babies, since there&#039;s just so much holding involved; I was really glad to have one-on-one care until my son was about 5 months old. Now I think it would be pretty easy to take care of him and another child.)

				I am a freelancer as well. But my kids are older. I have a toddler and a school age child. I don&#039;t know how well that would work since it seems like most of you have infants. Maybe if anyone with 2 kids comes into it, I could swap with them. I don&#039;t mind watching a baby (in fact it would be refreshing and wonderful) but I don&#039;t know how you would feel about that. <br /><br />I can also suggest my babysitter who is looking for work. I had to let her go because I just don&#039;t have a steady enough schedule. She is very flexible schedule wise and wonderful with kids. She plays with them and when I say she loves kids that is an understatement. I am going to make another post on the board about this. PM me if you are either interested in a swap or the babysitter&#039;s info.

				Hello, <br /><br />This is a little bit tangential, but I am a member of a babysitting co-op located at the end of 30th Avenue, near 51st. We are currently interested in expanding our membership.&nbsp; Our children range in age from 0-6. If you are interested, please check out our informational website: <br />http://www.babysittingcoopinfo.blogspot.com/<br /><br />Have a great holiday season, <br />Laura Bootsy B.
