				The day before yesterday. I was walking home along 43rd St. between 28th and 25th avenues and noticed that the street was blocked by several police cars and a tow truck. At first I thought that it was a stolen car recovery. When I got nearer, I saw that it was instead a car wreck. The crazy thing is that the driver didn&#039;t side swipe the parked cars. She t-boned the car on the east side of the street right in the middle of the door. I have no idea how she could have turned so sharply in a single lane.<br />Apparently she was texting and lost control of the car. To make matters worse, she had two small children in the backseat and an infant in the FRONTseat.

				What could be so damn urgent that she couldn&#039;t wait to reach her destination, risking the lives of her children. I recall a life before mobile phones where you actually communicated remotely via a land phone either from your home, or from a pay phone if it was an urgent matter.
