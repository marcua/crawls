				Has anyone heard anything on the progress of the Broadway Station renovation?&nbsp; I remember seeing a sign advertising a grand re-opening on March 4, but they were closed as of yesterday. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think that March Madness will be the same without 20 tvs and one of their burgers.

				I have the same question.&nbsp; This seems to be a bad time to be closed for renovations if you are a sports bar.&nbsp; March Madness will bring folks who usually don&#039;t go to bars to watch the games, especially considering that one freaking network (CBS) airs all of the games and they determine which games will be seen!&nbsp; <br /><br />One of the great things about watching Sunday football at Broadway Station are the fans from other states or regions of the United States who proudly wear their jerseys and cheer their team, despite the distance from their home!&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I walked by B&#039;way Station bar a few days ago (March 25th/26th-ish) and the front door was open so I peeked in... and the place looked to be totally gutted. The walls were bare (read: no sheetrock), and there seemed to be only temporary lighting in the ceilings. I get the feeling that it&#039;ll be more than a few weeks before it re-opens.&nbsp; The crew at Indigo (a sister bar) might be the right people to ask re: a re-opening date... :x

				I saw the same thing as sjfee...bar was completely gutted and it looked they were completely rebuilding the actual wooden bar.&nbsp; They put up a sign in the window the other day thanking folks for their patronage and mentioning the sister bar on 31st Street.&nbsp; Not only are they missing out on March Madness, but they seemed to be a pretty decent Rangers bar.&nbsp; My buddies and I would watched quite a few playoff hockey games their last year and it was good times.&nbsp; Hopefully they&#039;ll get it open in the next couple of weeks before the playoffs start.&nbsp;

				I collected some more intel last night (1 April) on the state of the Broadway Station bar.&nbsp; The entire place was definitely gutted, but overall construction is in the rebuild stage- all the materials laying around looked brand new. Some Sheetrock has been hung on the walls- probably about 1/4 to 1/3 total coverage.&nbsp; The rear wall appears to be some sort of a floor to ceiling slate stone wall- and from 40-50 feet away it looked to be pretty well done. There&#039;s no roof or floor yet, but the bar is being framed. It looks like it&#039;ll be the same depth and at least the same length as the old bar.<br /><br />I&#039;m getting the impression that the final product will be a little more modern/trendy than the old place, but ought to maintain the sports bar feel. The manager at Indigo told me (about a month ago) that they&#039;re going to put up 20-something flatscreen TVs in the new place and table-top wireless speakers that can be tuned to whatever channel you&#039;re watching will be available.&nbsp; Additionally, they&#039;ll be subscribing to that trivia service that&#039;s always seen in TGI Friday&#039;s and Buffalo Wild Wings- the one where you can play all types of trivia, poker, etc. thru those blue wireless &quot;computers&quot;. <br /><br />Hope it opens sooner than later... I&#039;m in withdrawal from not having a beer/food/sports/trivia joint a block away from me...

				The old Dillons (previously the Spinning Wheel) has a new sign in the window saying &quot;Broadway Sports Bar.&quot;&nbsp; Looks like they are renovating there as well, so we&#039;ll go from none to two sports bars along that stretch of Broadway in probably a matter of weeks!

				In the last few days the crews have constructed a plywood &quot;shell&quot; for the Station-it goes about one to two feet out onto the sidewalk.&nbsp; From what I remember the front of the Station was entirely removed, so this shell is probably for security reasons.&nbsp; It would be exciting if they added a few more windows to the front.&nbsp; I was able to see in, and they&#039;re still in the thick of the renovations, but I&#039;m really encouraged by what&#039;s up.&nbsp; At least they&#039;re putting in the time to make sure that the ceiling doesn&#039;t leak anymore!
