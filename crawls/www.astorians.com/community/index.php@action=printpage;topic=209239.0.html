				Dear Astorians,<br /><br />I&#039;m writing to announce that this website will be closing down on December 31st.<br /><br />It&#039;s hard to believe this forum is over 17 years old. It all started in 2004 (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=2.msg2#msg2) when a small group of us realized there wasn&#039;t really a good online forum to share information about some of the great spots in Astoria and just talk about the neighborhood we loved. At first it was just a few of us posting on here, but as the &quot;Freeze Peach Cafe (https://www.yelp.com/biz/freeze-peach-astoria)&quot; (managed by my partner Meesh and I) opened and the community around the cafe grew, this online community also grew bigger and bigger.<br /><br />For many years astorians.com was the most active community discussion site in the community, and it thrived with lots of active posts, and some awesome volunteer moderators that kept all of us relatively well behaved. Lots of people met here (some even got married!), and we talked A LOT about a lot of stuff.<br /><br />But here in 2021 it feels that there are more options than ever for discussing community issues online, and that the time for a site like this has largely faded. The activity level on the site is much lower than it was at its peak, and it&#039;s a significant struggle to try and keep things going and fend off spam (which admittedly I haven&#039;t done a great job of for a long time). Rather that let it get taken over by spammers and hackers I&#039;ve decided it&#039;s time to put the site to rest. All good things come to an end.<br /><br />Many thanks to all who have made this site possible and giving it life all these years:<br />Moderators or major contributors: mcdirk, daisy, AJTNYC, Astoria Luv, 28Grand, megc, wasabisam, jayme and others <br /><br />And of course; thank you.<br /><br />I&#039;d love if you took a moment to share a memory or two about how the site was useful to you through these years, or maybe a memory from your interactions with the people here.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />merm

				Sorry to see this site go! Thanks for all your hard work building this forum and keeping it going for all these years!<br /><br />Years ago, I found a cat in the neighborhood, and I posted a photo of her here to see if she belonged to anyone. She didn&#039;t, but a few people offered to take her if I didn&#039;t want her.&nbsp; :smiley: (I kept her.) It was great to be able to post her here instead of having to put up flyers in the neighborhood.<br />

				This is really sad news, I met so many people here where we actually met in person and became friends.&nbsp; NYCMacUser - Lorrie, you are forever in my heart and even though you&#039;re in a better place, you are still missed.&nbsp; Jonathan, I met you and your dog Bentley, or Sir Bentley as I called him, he reminded me so much of my Limbo but with longer hair, and I can go on forever and name so many.&nbsp; This room was ahead of it&#039;s time, it brought us together.&nbsp; We were having Town Halls before they were called that, we were playing games that involved us all.&nbsp; I think of this group often, of those that are no longer in Astoria but will always be Astorians by heart (you can take an Astorian out of Astoria, but you can&#039;t take Astoria out of an Astorian!).&nbsp; I send you all such a huge hug, and wish you all the very best, and hopefully we can all continue to keep in touch.&nbsp; I want to give a shout out to all the Admins and creators of this room, you really aced it.&nbsp; Thank you

				Hey Merm&#039;!<br /><br /><br />mridude (Kevin),<br /><br /><br />Sorry to see this close, but I get that you need to get on with your life. I was last in Astoria around April. I had parked my car there and subwayed into Manhattan for a Job/Physical/Screening. I walked around a bit, Checked out some of the new stores. Noted the ones that were gone, Like FreezePeach, my local Oasis while I lived on 27th Street and Ditmars Blvd.<br />Many of my memories were intertwined with FreezePeach itself. The full-size poster of an early nonsurgically modified Michael Jackson on the bathroom door. Pixel, your cat, cornering a rat the size of a small beaver, Seeing people on the remote camera who appeared to LIVE there. You, teaching yourself a new, non-qwerty keyboard, looking into getting a HAM-Radio operators license, The small Christmas Tree festooned with green toy soldiers and various tanks, half-tracks and toy field artillery. Dubbed: &quot;Operation: Merry Christmas&quot;. The Knitty-Crafty ladies meeting to knit all

				kinds of things. Watching televised presidential debates. Using the internet for all kinds of things before I eventually had internet service of my own.<br /><br /><br />The Astorians site itself....what stands out most of all is when Big Brian (Hawaiian Brian...he liked Hawaiian shirsts) passed away. like 15 years ago? I attended his wake. Met his sister Judy. Then we all met at an Astorians member&#039;s apartment (her name was Judy as well) had some food and actually met several Astorians in the flesh.<br />The funny thing, if there was one, was that everyone there thought &quot;mridue&quot; was short for &quot;mystery dude&quot;. I explained that I was an MRI Technologist and welcome chuckles were had by all. <br /><br /><br />Brian actually was a neighbor and lived up the street from me. Also across the street from St. John&#039;s Prep.<br /><br /><br />I also remember the never-ending &quot;Bed Bugs&quot; forum. :rolleyes: ,&nbsp; The constant search by some for an affordable apartment.<br /><br /><br />The posting by Cadillacman about his friend and fellow homeless man, Chris, who died under the&nbsp; Railroad archway downtown.<br />I remembered Chris as well. I was cleaning out my tiny closet for some dire needed room and had several L.L.Bean Flannel shirts that no longer fit me. I washed them, bagged them, then saught out Chris on the streets.<br />I found him and offered them to him. The were warm shirts, and it was starting to get cold.<br /><br /><br />&quot;These are YOUR possessions?&quot; <br /><br /><br />Yes, they are.<br /><br /><br />&quot;Then I WILL TAKE THEM!&quot;<br /><br /><br />Astoria had it&#039;s share of Characters.<br /><br /><br />Bookbinder and I tried to get a &quot;Midnight Riders&quot; group going of Astorians who wanted to get together and ride bicycles in the neighborhood.<br /><br /><br />Meesh joined us on one of the early rides. We broke into the gate securing the Saint John&#039;s Prep athletic field and rode around the runner&#039;s track.<br />I told Meesh that we were probably going to get caught and get into trouble.<br /><br /><br />&quot;Come on! Don&#039;t be a coward! You live across the street. Have you ever been inside this gate?&quot;<br /><br /><br />Nope! That was the first and last time.<br /><br /><br />I miss Astoria.<br /><br /><br />Take care all!<br /><br /><br />Kevin (mridude...signing off....)

				<br /><br /><br />Nice closing note and words.&nbsp; I get it.&nbsp; It makes sense, and yeah, nice to close things off before all the spammers and bots take over.&nbsp; Indeed, I&#039;d actually &#039;forgotten&#039; all about this site.&nbsp; It&#039;s been a long time since I used it.&nbsp; Local conversations seemed to turn to local FB pages and Nextdoor.com, from what I&#039;ve seen.<br /><br /><br />I remember using Astorians.com to learn about all the great new places to eat in Astoria, but at a certain point it became moot, since the great food options here are now endless.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Thank you for all the great work in maintaining this site!<br /><br /><br />Godspeed to one and all!&nbsp; ;-)<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I appreciate all of the work that went into site maintenance.&nbsp; THANK YOU.<br />And I loved so many posts here throughout the years.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I first started visiting this site, the internet was a saner place.&nbsp; Arguments were like discussions.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Maybe the most important part of this site&#039;s history to me is that it was a great place to post about missing/found pets.&nbsp; We found a dog about ten years ago and I posted info and pictures here.&nbsp; After three days, the owner finally called and it turned out she lived just a few houses down our block.

				Sorry to see you go. I felt a sense of community here even though I never made it out of tourist status. I perused for all sorts of things when I moved into the neighborhood in 2007, dry cleaners, nail salons, etc…I posted during Hurricane Sunday needing help for those in the rockaways. I wish you all, all the best.

				Wow. I have not been active on this board in close to a decade, and actually moved out of Astoria in 2015 to purchase a house (on the other side of Queens) and start a family. But when I saw the email notifying me that this message board was shutting down, I felt the need to log on and post one more time.<br /><br /><br />Astorians.com was instrumental for me and my now-wife when we were looking for apartments together back in 2008. We knew we wanted to live in Astoria, but didn&#039;t know much about the neighborhood at all (other than our friends lived there). This board gave us tons of insight on the different sections of Astoria, and great feedback on certain buildings, landlords, realtors,&nbsp; etc. It really helped us find the right apartment, and we lived there very happily for 7 years, becoming entrenched in the neighborhood. I came back to this board many times for food and bar recommendations from others, and to give my own as well, as Astoria blossomed into one of the &quot;it&quot; neighborhoods in all of New York City.<br /><br /><br />I came to Astoria as a 26-year old who felt 22, and grew from a post-college party animal into a career-oriented, family-focused 33-year old soon-to-be father (who still liked a good beer or three). Hard to believe I have been away from Ditmars for 6 years now (and my son is in first grade!), but I come back to visit often. The area will ALWAYS be home for me, and this message board was always a small part of that chapter in my life.<br /><br /><br />I am saddened to see it will be shut down, but happy it existed in the first place, and proud of everything the moderators did to keep it going.&nbsp; &nbsp;:smiley: :embarrassed: <br /><br /><br />I wish you all nothing but the best going forward.<br /><br /><br />-Andrew<br />(Previously at 21-12 29th St, on the corner of 29th St and 21st Ave).

				Wow, end of an era!&nbsp; Thank you so much for creating and managing this; it was a luxury when I first moved to Astoria back in 2005 and found friends, food, hobbies, and a lively community.&nbsp; It&#039;s crazy to think it&#039;s been 10 years since my last post and leaving the neighborhood.&nbsp; Thank you for all the memories.&nbsp; One last post to go, I&#039;m definitely going to win the Last Poster Thread this time!&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Cheers!<br />Josh (Josh)

				I am a new member and I posted this question a week or so ago and can&#039;t find it anywhere so I will post it here. <br /><br /><br />I am new to the Astoria area, was so happy when I found this site and am sorry it&#039;s shutting down.&nbsp; Since I hope to buy into the area in the near future, what other community forums would you recommend for obtaining info on various condos such as if the management is responsive or if there are pending lawsuits?&nbsp; Thank you!!

				Just logging on to say how much this forum meant to me while I lived in Astoria, a place I still feel connected to even though I live all the way across the country in Portland, OR. I met some great people though these forums, attended some awesome Astorians events, learned about Freeze Peach here, and overall it gave me a sense of community. Big thanks to merm for running this forum and also to the merm-Meesh team who ran Freeze Peach. Rose Garden will forever be one of my favorite teas, too.<br /><br /><br />I know we have Facebook, Nextdoor, and other social media these days, but I maintain that hyperlocal forums and - for the olds among us - local BBSes are superior when it comes to community-building and connection. I still maintain friendships I built through those pre-social media online communities I frequented in the 90s and 2000s. But I also understand that merm needs to shut things down here, and I accept that. <br /><br /><br />So, adios everyone. Be well, stay safe, and love Astoria!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
