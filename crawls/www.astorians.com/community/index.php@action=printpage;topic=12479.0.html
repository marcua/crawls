				Where can I find the best single shot espresso in Astoria. So far the best I have had is a Euro Cafe on Broadway. I know we can do better than this. I&#039;m looking for a joint where I can walk up to the espresso bar and receive a single shot that does not taste like camel pee.

				As I&#039;ve never tasted camel pee I&#039;m not sure I can advise you, but you might try Soleil Coffeehouse on Astoria Blvd between 37th and 38 streets.

				Ive tasted camel pee and let me tell you, it sucks.&nbsp; Don&#039;t go into the desert without a canteen my friend.&nbsp; <br /><br />A decent shot of espresso?&nbsp; Try Laziza on Steinway by 28th ave, Il bambino is said to have a decent shot.&nbsp; Other than that, i&#039;d love to hear more suggestions.

				I&#039;d also like to add, that I&#039;m looking for a place that&#039;s not too flashy. No need for reflective material shirts or eurobeats. I will take the beautiful people. I just need a pick me up and a moment of zen.

				My hands down faves:<br /><br />Terrizzi Bakery on 30th ave in the mid 30&#039;s south side-- you can go up to the counter have it in a REAL not paper cup and it is usually very very good- and they have a sugar dispenser just like you&#039;d see at any caffe bar in italy. 35-14 30th ave.<br /><br />I also like Gian Piero&#039;s but it is sometimes a bit bitter- I always get a Macchiatto there with just a touch of sugar- but it is always served in a paper cup.&nbsp; they are 44th street and 30th avenue.<br /><br /><br />Enjoy

				Hmm--<br /><br />The only places I know of that will give you anisette or sambuca with your espresso are L&#039;Incontro (the espresso is always gratis after the meal) or Manducati&#039;s in LIC (the sambuca is gratis).&nbsp; Granted you&#039;ll have to have a meal before you can get the espresso....but i can think of worse things to do --

				i&#039;ve yet to find the perfect shot as well. i&#039;ll have to disagree about il bambino, last time i got espresso there it was abnormally large, watery and no frothy goodness on top. you know the general rule of &quot;the longer the sugar sits on top, the better quality the espresso is.&quot; i just came back from living in italy and was disappointed in il bambino. <br /><br />i&#039;ve had good espresso, though not perfect, at sparrow, and there is an italian bakery (can&#039;t remember the name) on 30th ave and roughly 44th st (on the same side as the church) that makes good espresso. <br /><br />please share your espresso experiences!

				yes that is Gian Piero on 30th ave near 44th<br /><br />there is also a place up on steinway-- north of 28th ave I believe- deep in the Egyptian area- It is an italian place and has very good espresso- I have only been there a couple times.&nbsp; It may even be egyptian owned now...If it find the name I&#039;ll pass it on.

				I&#039;ve sampled the majority of places listed on this thred and I think QuentinC got it right.<br /><br />&quot;Terrizzi Bakery on 30th ave in the mid 30&#039;s south side&quot; is now my hands down favorite.
