				Wow, this is so cool. My brother-in-law has written a book about their life growing up in Africa. I&#39;ve read part of this and it is very interesting! I love hearing these tales and looking at the awesome pictures. <br /><br />When you go to the page and see the photo, my husband is the oldest son and standing between his mom and dad. Lordee, he was (IS!) so handsome! <br /><br />www.freewebs.com/albrightstory<br /><br /><br />

				And. for those of you who do go to the site, I&#39;m not trying to make any theological statements or cause any debates about the Christianity aspect of the book - my mother-and father-in-law were Southern Baptist Missionaries, that&#39;s the whole reason they were there. And Ray, the author, and his family, in particular, are very active in organized religion. I have different viewpoints. To each his own. &nbsp;:-)<br /><br />It truly is an adventure story!<br /><br />

				That reminds me that I should share my book of memoirs of growing up in Africa (not my memoirs obviously)... the author grew up in Zimbawe, just south of where your husband was.<br />You may remember me mentioning it at Jen and Jonathan&#39;s after party thingy a while back.<br />Anyways, I might hand it off to you to read for comparison since her (the author&#39;s views) are very different. Who knows, you might like it :)

				Was thinking about this thread after my friends sent me their blog link.<br /><br />http://smithderksensands.blogspot.com/<br /><br />They are Mennonites about to go do work in Chad.&nbsp; I knew them when they were working in Uganda, too.&nbsp; Amazing stories, some happy and some very tragic.&nbsp; Kathryn is a gambist and we&#39;ve played concerts together.<br /><br />They went elsewhere in Africa (Burkina Faso) to learn French!&nbsp; I think that is very cool.&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />I&#39;ll also put out the disclaimer that I&#39;m not forwarding any specific kind of religious thinking via this post.&nbsp; :)
