				FYI, just walked by and there are signs in the windows (new addition since this morning).<br /><br /><br />Evidently, Dekko is becoming:<br /><br /><br /><strong>Don Coqui</strong><br /><strong>&quot;Shortcut to Puerto Rico&quot;</strong><br /><br /><br />I am intrigued...<br /><br /><br />(It&#039;s not open for business yet)

				Soooooo ... when the management told me they were doing &quot;a few minor renovations,&quot; that meant &quot;becoming a completely different restaurant, serving a completely different cuisine, with a new name.&quot; <br /><br /><br />Got it. <br /><br /><br />I mean, it could be great, but sheesh, just say you&#039;re starting over. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;ll miss Dekko.

				Think it could possibly be a Puerto Rican joint that serves frappes and baklava?<br /><br />&nbsp;:cry:

				We tried Don Coqui over the weekend.&nbsp; Very impressed with the food and the chef and the staff.&nbsp; This is a very well established and successful restaurant with a history in New Rochelle.&nbsp; So they basically took that business model, teamed up with the owners of Dekko and Cienna and changed it over.&nbsp; The Dekko part is still closed but will be a more casual cafe more for lunch and brunch.&nbsp; But it seems like they&#039;re still giving it thought.&nbsp; The old Cienna space is the main dining and drinking part of Don Coqui.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the over-the-top, garish decor of the old Cienna space takes away from the more down-to-earth dinner menu.&nbsp; But I&#039;m sure it fits well when it&#039;s after midnight and the place becomes more of a club.&nbsp; We tried several small plate items.&nbsp; Everything was delicious.&nbsp; Get the tostones with beef and also with codfish.&nbsp; Both were great. The king crab legs were amazing.&nbsp; Fresh and cooked perfectly.&nbsp; My guess is that all the food is prepared equally as well. The place definitely has a following and is already drawing crowds.&nbsp; Dekko and Cienna never quite found a niche there.&nbsp; I have a feeling this will be a huge success.&nbsp; &nbsp;We ate at the bar and the servers could not be more helpful and pleasant.&nbsp;

				Wow - that&#039;s so funny.&nbsp; For years, every time I drove up 95 past New Roc I&#039;d see Don Coqui and wonder what it was like.&nbsp; I can&#039;t believe there&#039;s one here now!&nbsp; Cool - can&#039;t wait to try it.

				Not my cup of tea.&nbsp; Love, love, love Puerto Rico, my granny is from there,but this place is more club/circus.&nbsp; I actually returned a steak because it was inedible and smothered in bbq sauce!&nbsp; Yuck!<br /><br />

				Went on a Saturday night to the club and was very impressed with the service, the music, and the crowd. I havent had dinner at the restaurant yet, but friends have given it positive feedback. I look forward to my first meal here.
