								<div class="inner" id="msg_31489">a friend of mine lost her dad. she wrote this in a journal entry and this morning i read it and it really moved me. thought you&#39;d like a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><em>9-11-01, Five Years Later.<br />Remember September, remember September. I think I have grown tired of remembering, tired of living it over and over again in my head so many times. The day before, the morning of, the moment, the realization, the breakdown, the desperate and screaming phone calls, the ride home in Joe&#39;s car the next day, the cars in the driveway, the hope on everyone&#39;s faces, and then...<br /><br />And then. And then and then and then. I think I slept through the year. I delivered a eulogy, I wrote poems and painted, I sculpted, I made so much bad art that I almost lost myself in it. I wrote and wrote, and the writing was as good as the art was bad. I swallowed a lot of pills that never seemed to do anything other than have side effects. I spent a lot of time with Ghevf who became one of the most trusted people in my world and still is. He was there you see. Not a lot of people were.<br /><br />I look back and I remember. I look back and I see how young I was. There&#39;s nothing quite like finding yourself at the epicenter of a national tragedy to make you grow up fast.<br /><br />***<br /><br />I was reading Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close last week and I had such a visceral reaction that I got up from where I was, went into the studio where James was working and put my arms around him. &quot;I need a hug&quot; I said, and lost myself in a long, emotional hug, the kind where you leave spots on the person&#39;s shirt because your face is leaking.<br /><br />It&#39;s peculiar - most of the time, I cannot feel much of anything about it, even to this day. I reach inside myself to try and summon the sensation of loss, and all I find is a void. It&#39;s the biggest and most hollow thing I have ever experienced, just sitting there in my heart taking up space. It always takes some sort of outer stimulus to break through the hollow space and pull out the tears of grieving, and when the tears come, they are intense and sobbing. They are loud. They are extremely loud.<br /><br />I&#39;ve never been someone to repress an emotion, and I think this is the only area in my emotional life that has repressed itself against my will. Perhaps my heart knows what&#39;s best for me better than the rest of me. There&#39;s a certain frustration to it, though - and I don&#39;t like how uncontrollable the emotions can be when they are bursting through my seams.<br /><br />Watching footage is an understandable release. Reading accounts can get me. The aforementioned book really got me. The memorials usually get it out of me too, though usually because I look around at all the young kids and widows and parents and I want to cry for them. Through empathy I have found my own release.<br /><br />***<br /><br />In five years I have come to understand more about my mother than I knew back in 2001. Most of it entails a kind of grace that is something I have rarely ever seen. She kept on working and living even when she lost her partner of many, many years. She kept her grief private and never let herself become labeled as a professional widow. She endured. She kept her family close. Incredibly close.<br /><br />***<br /><br />I&#39;ll go to the memorial again this year, five years later, five years after the fact. I still miss him. He will never see the woman I have become, the woman he helped shape me into. I&#39;ll never know the details surrounding his death, who he was close to, who he spent his last moments with. I&#39;ll never kneel down at a grave where his remains rest because they never found a single thing that could be buried. I&#39;ll never, I&#39;ll never, I&#39;ll never.<br /><br />But I keep remembering. I remember the sunsets at the lake where he sat in his tattered Cornell sweatshirt, I remember his struggles, his accent, his intensity, his smile. I never knew what a good father he was because I never got to approach him as an adult, and he never got to approach me as one either.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Grace.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Everyone&#39;s got their tragedies, and this one&#39;s one of mine. I&#39;m ready to leave New York now, but I somehow doubt it will ever leave me.</em></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_31491">The overwhelming military, police and national guard presence in Lower Manhattan (and in our subways) for the weeks after 9-11 still are very vivid in my memory. &nbsp;I remember how it was primary day, usually one of my favorite days of the year and I was involved in a heated City Council primary in Lower Manhattan. &nbsp;We heard the first plane go overhead and then heard the cries that the WTC had been hit, and sure enough, when we looked up, everyone stopped to stare in amazement and shock. <br />I was seeing a guy who lived in Battery Park City at the time of the attacks and getting to his apartment for weeks after the attacks took going through many barracades. &nbsp;It was so depresssing and surreal. &nbsp;I still find it hard to think about 9-11, the memories are too raw. &nbsp;Has anyone seen any of the films made about the day, or that wretched ABC mini-series? &nbsp;Watching the NY1 coverage was the first real historical overview I&#39;ve watched on TV and it brought back many strong memories.</div>

I&#39;ve spoken to my mother, had friends come down to my office to reminisce at work, and we all seem to be feeling this in a similarly strong way this year, and have found ourselves surprised by it. Strange, because I&#39;m ashamed to say, I barely remember last year. <br /><br />Yet, not only can I remember that day and each moment of it with aching clarity, but every day that followed it for a week and more. I remember coming out of the subway and standing in a doorway on Second Avenue and 43rd Street on Friday morning, (9.14.01) watching the rain fall, and for some reason, the rain, the torrential violence of it broke me down for the first time since the events took place. And the following day, 9.15.01, driving in to the city to bring in donations, etc. and being the only other car on 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue at 11:00 a.m. except for the fully armed military truck next to me at the light. Sitting there looking straight down 23rd Street with nothing but NJ in front of me. The chills two months later when the plane crashed a few feet from the home where my father then lived in Rockaway and thinking it was happening all over again and that this time I would not escape &quot;unscathed.&quot; As I am perhaps one of the few natives who did not have a direct loss of a friend or loved one that day.<br /><br />I can remember one month, two, six, and one year later, equally so. The next few, not so much. I suppose this is not so uncommon, either. I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s not meant to&nbsp; be callous, I certainly know that I sat and reconsidered the day and the events at least for a period of time on each of those anniversaries.&nbsp; But, as I said, today (and actually, this has been true for much of last week, as well), I am feeling a similar melancholy that I experienced in the few months after the original day. It&#39;s more acute, certainly. A part of that has to do (from a very personal perspective) with looking back and thinking, &quot;Five years is a long time. What have I done in five years? How has it all gotten past me like this?&quot; And the rest has to do with not only the scar of the day, but all the other evil that has come from this administration during that time.<br /><br />As far as not dwelling or not moving on, well, as I see it, I&#39;ve had plenty of good come to me since that day. I do not write the above to dwell on the morbid. I celebrate the good as often as I can every other day of the year and try to recognize as much of it as I can when it happens. I would do that with or without 9.11.01 to give me perspective. And yes, I will even do that today as much as I can. But to recall the events on the day they occurred, and allow them to remain powerful has nothing to do with not getting on with your life for me, personally. It is only when you let something like this overwhelm your thoughts and actions (be it 9/11 or any other personal strife) that you have ceased to live. <br /><br />So. Essentially. Yes. Sad. More than anticipated.<br /><br /><br />**********<br /><br />&quot;like tears in rain.&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Absolutely.&nbsp; My idea is not to forget, and just put it behind us.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think this is the kind of thing you can ever just put behind you.&nbsp; I&#39;m trying to use the memory of those events as a way to propel me to better things.&nbsp; As a starting point, in a way.&nbsp; With great tragedy can also arise great potential.&nbsp; I&#39;ve written some music with that in mind.&nbsp; But again, I didn&#39;t lose anyone directly in those attacks.&nbsp; I did witness the attacks, but didn&#39;t lose anyone.&nbsp; But it&#39;s interesting how I personified the Towers.&nbsp; When those buildings fell, I felt like I watched 2 people get cut down that were close to me.&nbsp; I worked a block away from the trade center for a couple years, and actually lived a block south of the trade center the year before the attacks.&nbsp; I would go to the plaza between the towers on almost a daily basis to eat lunch.&nbsp; And with the loss of the towers, it felt similar to losing a loved one, as I&#39;ve experienced.<br /><br />I&#39;m not quite sure how I feel today.&nbsp; Somewhat numb.&nbsp; Somewhat frustrated by not achieving as much as I wanted to.&nbsp; Frustrated by the idea that maybe I&#39;m not living my life as fully as I could, or should.&nbsp; Frustrated by not taking advantage.&nbsp; Advantage of the opportunities that life in the city provide.&nbsp; Advantage of the opportunity to tell my family and friends that I love them and how much they mean to me.&nbsp; It&#39;s as though life is a gift, and I don&#39;t feel entirely like I&#39;ve unwrapped it yet.&nbsp; And this day is just a reminder of that.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_31503">I didn&#39;t yet live in New York on 9/11. (I moved here on the day after the blackout, which is an actually funny story!) I was in Urbana, IL, which is a long way from New York City in many many ways. I woke up, heard something on the radio about a plane crashing into a building, recalled that a plane had once hit the Empire State building, and thought little of it. I went to class (Zulu!), where everything was normal, and walked up to work afterwards. Only then, hearing from my officemate Scott that the towers had fallen, and seeing the absolute gridlock on the Internet, did I realize the scale of what had happened. <br /><br />I lived in a brand new co-op then, which had two big effects on my experience of the event. One was that we had a hugely important meeting that evening. We&#39;d been up and running for all of three weeks, and the general manager of the organization that helped us buy the house was driving down from Ann Arbor, MI. (Poor guy spent all day driving the interstate with the radio tuned to the news.) We had our meetings as normal, and somewhere there&#39;s a photo of the new members of the co-op sitting at the table for dinner on 9/11, smiling somewhat unhappily at the camera. So in some sense my experience of 9/11 was a little overshadowed by my personally being so busy that day and the following couple of days. The second big effect of living in the co-op is that we had no television. I paid very close attention to the news, read the NYT online and so forth. But we didn&#39;t have a TV (being a hippie commune and all), and there weren&#39;t many videos on the Internet in 2001. So although I saw lots of pictures, I never saw the video of the second plane hitting. In fact, my recollection is that the first time I saw that video footage, that 90% of the US saw that day, and that some of you saw with your own eyes, was in Michael Moore&#39;s Bowling for Columbine the following Spring, perhaps six months later.<br /><br />My experience with this anniversary is also different. Part of it, perhaps, is that it&#39;s the 5th anniversary, and not the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th. But I think the bigger reason why is because I have a much stronger connection to the city now. I only knew one person in NYC on 9/11. (His email back to me that day said, if I recall, &quot;M&#39;ok.&quot;) Now I know hundred of people here and I feel like a New Yorker in at least some ways. It&#39;s a little like marrying into a family that lost a sibling a few years back, and having it be my adopted family now too that&#39;s recovering... <br /><br />Go see some music, y&#39;all...</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_31525">Two things happened to me since 9/11 that have deeply shaded how I see that day.&nbsp; Both are deaths -- of one of my parents and a close friend, in 2003 and 2004.&nbsp; Both of which brought home a sense of personal loss I didn&#39;t understand back on 9/11/01.&nbsp; And both of which put that day in a different context for me.&nbsp; When you lose someone in your life, it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s some awful world event like 9/11 or just a parent quietly passing away on a hospital bed.&nbsp; It&#39;s like getting shot through the heart, and you carry that with you the rest of your days.<br /><br />At that time, the events of 9/11 had a profound effect on me, mainly in terms of grief and anger.&nbsp; But I can see now, the simple passing of two people close to me registered so much more.&nbsp; And no one&#39;s going to mourn these two people who passed, save for the people who knew and loved them.&nbsp; In the grand scheme of things, that&#39;s all that makes sense and matters to me now.&nbsp; And that is in no way meant to disparage anyone who still feels deeply hurt over that day.<br /><br />You live with these things, and you walk on.&nbsp; Death and dying are the hardest things we&#39;ll all deal with one day, if we already haven&#39;t. My memories of 9/11 now are associated with seeing that stuff go down with my own two eyes, running like hell at various points, coming over the 59th Street Bridge to see Peter Vallone, Sr. handing out water, walking through Astoria on a beautiful, sunny day, and feeling like I was on another planet as the streets were bare, and this made no sense compared to what I had just seen across the river.<br /><br />But in all honesty, that&#39;s a lot easier for me to deal with now than these two far more private things that happened in the following years, and which let me know there are more of these sort of emotional jolts to come in the future that I&#39;ll be ready for.&nbsp; In all honesty, I&#39;m glad that day is slowly receding in my rear view mirror and hope a day like that never happens again.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_31541">This was a beautiful thread to come home to today.&nbsp; I know I&#39;m not a New Yorker, and really I&#39;m just passing through, but this day is significant for me because it showed me that people will come together in a crisis to help each other heal.&nbsp; I was here on vacation during the attacks.&nbsp; I got to see how such a tragedy could at once destroy and strengthen an entire city.&nbsp; This day is close to my heart because of how deeply it affected me and changed my views of the world.&nbsp; I always felt that because I live in America, I&#39;m safe.&nbsp; 9/11 shattered that calm.&nbsp; <br /><br />On my way home from work today I walked up Broadway through Times Square and past the theaters.&nbsp; It reminded me of the day after the attacks, when Broadway was empty and lined with candles.&nbsp; It reminded me of walking down 5th Avenue and seeing columns of smoke instead of those powerful buildings.&nbsp; This is certainly not just any other day in New York.&nbsp; I felt it as soon as I woke up today.&nbsp; There is sorrow, certainly, because so many lives were ruined.&nbsp; But on such a gorgeous, perfect day, I can feel hope in the air, a city rebuilding, it&#39;s residents healing, and I can&#39;t describe how proud I am to live here.&nbsp; New York is a place unlike any other, and rising above the horror, thriving on the desire to repair and protect, it proves its greatness and the greatness of its populace.&nbsp; <br /><br />I feel so fortunate to, five years later, be living in this city which taught me so much about life and myself.&nbsp; This is a very special place.&nbsp; All my memories here (even the bad ones) are precious.&nbsp; I am most thankful for my new friends here. Long after I leave New York, I will remember all the kindness and friendship generously given to me.&nbsp; I&#39;m a better person having you all in my life.&nbsp; Thanks to all of you.&nbsp; </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_31642">i was in DC on September 11, 2001. as part of an internship program at American University. i said the same thing the day i walked out to the subway that morning. &#39;thank you God for this beautiful day.&#39; it was a very long day. it was a very long week. it was quite a semester.<br /><br />but that semester was an important semester for me. we learned so much about community and caring about people in our community. fighting for social justice. learning so much about our classmates. learning so much about all the people in our dorms in other programs, from all over the nation. from all over the world.&nbsp; it inspired me to make Social Work my career. it inspired me to always work and help the people here in my country.&nbsp; <br /><br />i actually got a D that semester.&nbsp; :-D but i really did learn a lot. my papers were late. hahahha. you know why? i spent a lot of time partying and socializing. with new friends from the dorm. having intense conversations with classmates about everything.&nbsp; spent many weekends volunteering to tutor South DC kids in a new school.&nbsp; oh and i read a little bit too. :) <br /><br />we had to do all that partying. when you feel like something next to you might blow up, when you have been evacuated more than 3 times in one week for bomb threats, when your dorm mates are getting treated for anthrax, when&nbsp; you flinch everytime you see a plane in the sky, you really need to.&nbsp; you really need to spend time with others, and enjoy life whenever you can. if you have the means, the energy, the health, go have a great time!!<br /><br />i hope you all had a beautiful day!<br /><br />can&#39;t wait to meet more of you on Friday!! it&#39;s gonna be awesome!!</div>
