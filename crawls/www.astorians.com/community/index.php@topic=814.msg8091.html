I thought I had you there for a minute ;-). My bad.<br /><br />Amazingly enough, the audience was pretty cool about the immature title of the radio show that we were listening to and I must confess that I myself could not supress a chuckle here and there when the hosts of the show (perhaps overly) exploited the acronym in some amusingly creative fashion. In fact, I almost decided not to air it today until more thought was given to it... it is not my intention to offend. I think that the creators (who were probably making fun of another podcast entitled &#39;TWiT&#39; (This Week in Technology... which I wouldn&#39;t have known about if it weren&#39;t for this satire) chose the title (not only as a joke) but to draw attention to the fact that IT is still a very much male-dominated industry... and that many hacker meetings are doomed to become &quot;sausage fests&quot; if this is to continue. I sincerely believe that the creators of these shows do not want this to be the state of the industry and would love more people of the female sex to get involved thus increasing Humanity&#39;s Pool of Knowledge significantly, if not double, or triple. While we are talking about sex, I do not believe for a minute that the male and female brain are more or less adapted to deal with technologies or application of any type of tool by nature. It is an adament belief of mine that this is a <em>cultural</em> phenomenon and restriction which needs to be <span class="bbc_u">shattered</span> for the lie that it is despite of what the &quot;experts&quot; have projected onto their scientific studies and &quot;findings&quot;. Remember, that the Observer by necessity changes that which is Observed and this concept may extend to all data...including studies of the differences between the sexes and how our minds are supposed to work.<br /><br />My intent with today&#39;s &quot;programming&quot; was to introduce as many voices as could conveniently be crammed into the shortest period of time, while simultaneously paying close attention to the dictum of &quot;Content is King&quot;. IMHO we were successful, and were exposed to many various and useful bits of information. This temporally shortened form of media may in fact be conducive to economy of word, focus of idea, and easily digestable information/datagrams for consumption giving credence to the old cliche&#39; that one must chew one&#39;s food before swallowing. [Please vide John Malkovitch in the movie &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;]<br /><br /><em>&quot;Brevity is the essence of wit.&quot;- free Linux distro to the first person who can tell me the original source of this quote.</em><br /><br />The program started out with Kizzle&#39;s radio show Uberleeto [can the &#39;o&#39; be considered a zero and :. silent?] I don&#39;t believe he maintains his website (<a href="http://www.uberleeto.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.uberleeto.com/</a>) anymore but you can still check it out on the &quot;Wayback Machine&quot; sans the MSpaint project. In addition to creating hackermedia.net which is now hackermedia.org and for which we are all extremely grateful) he was one of the first if not the first to start the format of a little over five minute hacking show which may have been the progenitor of T.W.A.T. Radio, which is a daily... yes...DAILY, Hard-Core Tech Show.<br />It is my firm belief that if we can get past the name and learn the content of each show thoroughly then we will be well on our way towards a basic education of today&#39;s technology, or at least a spring board off of which to jump.<br />Skipping foward in time we listened to Jason Scott... and I am still trying to determine if he really went out to eat at all. Jason Scott is a preserver of BBS culture and also has a film out called BBS Documentary. Please check it out. Then we travelled back in time to the pilot episode of T.W.A.T., so that people could get a feel for the premise of the show (which I think we&#39;ll be playing alot more of in the future.) We also listened to the second episode of the new show Electrostuff, which I believe will save me mucho dinero in future. The last three episodes of the day covered some basic topics which we&#39;ll have to listen to a few more times to fully digest, but am sure that afterwards we will all be satiated. This is the food that some people starve for.<br /><br />Post show Geeky Conversation included:<br />we talked about the greatness of implementing a continuous ink supply for your printer replacing those expensive&nbsp; cartridges... which Electroman compared to the price of gasoline. There was talk of the first episode of Electrostuff where Elecroman implements a water cooling system for his computer and one of the members actually knows someone who instituted the water cooling device. We will have to investigate this further. [btw There are only two episodes of Elecrostuff as of now, so please give him some feedback and encourage him to produce more.]<br />After confessing that I needed a solution to sound problems, esp. dynamic range (playing so many shows of different qualities and changes in volume with each opening and closing music was quite annoying.

It was pretty busy at Freezepeach today and I was worried that there wouldn&#39;t be enough food. Thankfully the loaded cheese pies were more than filling; we even had a slice or two left over. For the Winter season we&#39;re thinking of initiating Soup (and so reconnect with our vegetarian roots) and bread (hopefully regionalized sourdough). We still need a way to healthily vegetatize the pies (eggs being the problematic binding ingredient). Merm is working on this (I hope), and no, today we didn&#39;t include bacon... my empty wallet saved us in this respect.<br />&nbsp; Again, I have to apologize to all the people who have ben hurt by AOL or the unfriendly commercialized puppetpeople of TechTv. (I really don&#39;t like name calling...especially if there is an indication that the offending parties may mean well (which may be problematic), but then again, how goes the olde saying about the metaphorical road to hell being paved with... what?)<br />&nbsp; Being an equal access media outlet we sometimes want to air people with whom we disagree, especially if there is information to be had or knowledge to be dealt, and I urge all you people out there who are offended by poisonous memes, propaganda and F.U.D. in general to write to these people and educate them on the true meaing of the word hacker. They may be receptive and discontinue their obseqiousness to the garbage which is Corporate Media. Then again, maybe not. Some of us are too entrenched in the hypnosis of Occlusion no matter how intelligent or clever we think we are. I am also a victim of figmentation at times, so I really understand. Thankfully I can accept criticism, though sometimes it really hurts, but, In the end I am thankful, grow, and move on (hopefully mending my ways... or maybe not [I am only human]).<br />&nbsp; Just remember people ... Corporate Crime and International Criminal Syndicate does Not equal Hacking or Hackers, though indeed some may have them in their employ as Crackers, just as they have every other sort of person in their employ, for example marketers in public relations to actual contract &quot;security&quot; personnel... maybe even you or me! (we are certainly buying into their lies; sometimes we have no choice, just as isolated from the world of information as someone born into the Klu Klux Klan!) In this world (in my own humble estimation) the so-called White Hats are the ones causing us (i.e. the consumer as well as the computer literati...{I fall into the consumer slot}) all of the annoying problems... only because of their <em>willingness</em> to please their masters. And it really isn&#39;t them who are causing problems like spam, etc. it is their employers who direct them. True freedom loving individuals <em>have</em> no masters.... for they do what is right by their own conscience, and actually take into consideration the possible repurcussions of their actions rather than blindly following &quot;the Book&quot;. Didn&#39;t Satan write a manual once? ;-) <br /><br />Hackers are not willing to change their name just for this reason. Back in the day some peverse individuals even hung, tortured and burned people because of their allegiance to certain deities, ideals or traditions. They even said that they were doing God&#39;s Work... and may have even believed it. In China during the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; it was the intelligentsia (teachers and artists) who were targeted. This is not what freedom is all about..nor the un-obstructed perception of truth or &quot;clear-seeing&quot;. Our &quot;enemies&quot; are not necessarily words or stereotypes. They are not Symbols. They are in fact multidimensional human beings with feelings, lives and souls who breathe, love, hate, feel pain and walk upon the Earth. A little Charity here People! When I say charity, I really mean &quot;Caritas&quot;, which any of you who are fans of PKD should know about.<br /><br />I&#39;m going to end this weekly rant (please criticise or correct me if I have been unfair or inaccurate... or just plain annoying) by saying that I really do sense something <span class="bbc_u">good</span> in the air, and the &quot;special shouts&quot; that precede each writeup are there for a reason. It is my own humble way of giving recognition not only to the stellar lights in my life but to those who light the way for others as well by their charitable example. This thing is not necessarily about technology exclusively... It is about the people who use it and create it. People are important, and now is the time to stick together, vent our grievances and work together towards a better sort of Habitat; and one which hopefully is not inimical to Life.<br /><br />Yours from Interzone (&#39;twixt Heaven and Hell),<br />Zeno (content free)<br /><br />&quot;Microsoft is not the problem.

The first was a topic series... for example we&#39;ll air shows having to do exclusively with a specialized subject like Phreaking, Wireless or Cryptography, etc. spanning a few weeks until we have a good foundation from which to build from. This will give some sort of structure to the lunch. The other idea was possibly a round table discussion... which I would like to see materialize (which usually happens anyway) but I don&#39;t want people to feel as if they have to share or discuss anything on Monday if it is their intent to just eat a bit and relax. The lunch <em>is</em> kind of informal. As soon as I get off my lazy butt I&#39;m going to contact the speakers, who will probably <em>not</em> be presenting on Monday @ 12, but probably on Friday nights. This is still in the works.<br />&nbsp; Also later on the evening I talked with Wakasm who turned me on to the exciting pong .gif floating around out there. He also found a function on his tv remote that allowed it to act as a mouse. He enlightened me to a new keyboard that has been in developement for some time now but may have been slowed down due to patent b.s. (more later). It is called the Optimus keyboard which implements customizable LCD keys which you can view <a href="http://www.artlebedev.com/portfolio/optimus/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">here</a>. Their <a href="http://www.artlebedev.com/portfolio/optimus/answers/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">faq</a>. Very exciting. <br /><br /><strong><em>Projects...</em></strong><br />A few of them are in the works. The crew at Basenet suggested during episode 0x09 that there is a need for a dictionary of open-source terms. For example... how is GNOME pronounced... is it gee-nome, or nome, or ga-nome? Perhaps all three? Taking this a step further, I&#39;ve noticed that there is not alot of spoken word books out there having to do with tech, which needs to be remedied for those of us who are either blind or just digest information better via alternative channels. Perhaps this media will also serve to reinforce what we have read. I think that the Jargon file would be a good place to start and I&#39;m not sure what ARRL has available in this area as well.<br /><br /><strong><em><span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color">M</span><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">K</span><span style="color: yellow;" class="bbc_color">-</span><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">U</span><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">l</span><span style="color: indigo;" class="bbc_color">t</span><span style="color: violet;" class="bbc_color">r</span><span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color">a</span> Pong</em> update:</strong> Wakasm has found an amusing .gif which he posted <a href="http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=1041.0" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 1.45em;" class="bbc_size"><em>Coming Soon...</em></span><br /><br /><marquee><span style="color: Green;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-size: 2em;" class="bbc_size">Binary Revolution Radio Episode 91 - easy WEP cracking</span></span></marquee><br /><span class="bbc_u"><span style="font-size: 2em;" class="bbc_size">Props</span></span><br /><br /><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0179969/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.ccc.de/congress/2004/fahrplan/speaker/images/170.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /><br /><strong>Errata:</strong> [We need your input for this section]<br /><br /><marquee>[Still Under Construction... where are my Legos?! :x]]</marquee></div>

I&#39;m really not <em>retracting</em> anything I said about Leo Laporte and Friends but only saying sorry that I helped further divide (in my own insignificant way) a community that is already unprotected under Laws and inherently <em>already</em> divided. Information Society is all inclusive... no exceptions. Some may see this neutrality as smacking of coldness and androidal roboticism... but in this AI I see the light of truth and the birth of true empathy blossoming in an intelligence created by us that is perhaps (or has the potential to be) greater than our own. Maybe not now, but perhaps in the Realm of MoonPenney. Don&#39;t scoff! :-) We now know that the world of James Bond and Speculative Fiction has long since become reality (with only some major or minor exceptions in regards to details &lt;/smirk&gt;). And we all know what lurks in the Details!<br /><br />My point comes to a matter of degree. What does it matter if some Kook on a community Forums or website says that what Leo Laporte or friend says is assoholic? Or what does it matter when some 12 year old kid or dead grandmother decides that pirating an MPEG layer 3 file of Michael Jackson&#39;s &quot;Thriller&quot; or the brand new Britney Spears Audio Book on Tape &quot;Politics through Prosperity&quot; is a good idea? The fact of the matter is, that when we (pixie people) decide to slander, cheat or become negligent... the overall effects on the World is in fact... negligible. But when Leo Laporte or friend says (who boasts over a million downloads and has the receptive ear of corporations and perhaps even <em>governments</em>) that hackers are a danger to your personal privacy and public security or Michael Jackson goes on a &quot;love fest&quot; in Thailand or the RIAA/FCC/MPAA decides to co-opt an entire form of media or law of nature as it&#39;s own showpiece to auction-block off to the highest bidder at it&#39;s own pleasure... well then, it could be argued that the fallout is less than negligable.<br /><br />Back to my original (and heartfelt premise): Not only should Robin <em>Hood</em> (who stole from the Rich and dared to give to the Poor; iow England -ruling aristocracy) be utterly and completely <em>Eradicated</em> and utterly and completely <em>Erased</em> from History books, so should everyone who dared to support him or even talk with him be so ignominously treated. Guilt equals Guilt by Association... and well.. I guess that means everybody ;-).<br />Why, the possibility that such a person could exist is my own worst unwholesome Nightmare, and for the benefit of our Children and our Children&#39;s Children we should not only completely rewrite history we should destroy all fairy tale books as well. Why, if such an unsavory and arrogant individual existed in modern times he would no doubt be labeled a Terrorist... him and all his so-called deviant &quot;Merry&quot; Band of Pranksters. Well, with today&#39;s media this is not only possible but also (if I hear no word to the contrary) completely Acceptable.<br /><br />Don&#39;t get me wrong... the positive energy that I felt last week has not dissipated. In fact, not only has it survived (perhaps due to the unexpected invigorating Spring-like Weather ... why if we could only halt Global Warming at this juncture it would not only be tolerable but absolutley pleasurable!) it has blossomed into nothing less than Green Man fervor. The only obstacle that I forsee (in the face of an uncrushed opposition lingering on it&#39;s last legs of despair) is our own inherent illogic. IOW... why are we here? Why are we banding together? And why are we not making the legal changes necessary in becoming a full-fledged Political Group with their own supporting corporate and private sector lobbyists? Making sure that the laws that put people away for millenia are in fact informed laws based on necessity and a technically sound basis? CCC in Germany is way ahead of us in this department, and maybe a model to emulate. Why?<br /><br />Perhaps it is because tech people are by nature anathema to politics. I don&#39;t mean to criticize or point out the obvious... but isn&#39;t water (H2O) a Universal Solvent?<br />The proverbial Ball is in your Court.<br />[/size] will equal 7pt (or less) in &lt;7 days<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 2.65em;" class="bbc_size">Props...</span><br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Rusesabagina" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.cinefile.biz/rwan-cs1.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br />Paul Rusesabagina and Don Cheadle<br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 7pt;" class="bbc_size"></span><marquee>[Perpetually ..Under ....&nbsp; &nbsp; ....&nbsp; &nbsp;...&nbsp; &nbsp;construction.......]</marquee>[/size]</div>

I <em>am</em> an American Indian. However, releasing the pent up frustration concerning what I percieve to be people&#39;s apathy is in itself cathartic and helps me the next morning in finding more productive means in the way of solution finding in the context of long term problems, of which I am by no means excluded. I am a smoker, a drinker and a user of petroleum products just as much as anybody else. The glass house that I live in must be shattered, for the glass is clouded and keeps us in Occlusion.

As I said before, i am an absolute beginner or noob in this field and thought that it would be fun in learning such a pertinent and fascinating topic together and interesting as well in observing the baby-steps that were taken along the way. So again, in apologia, any information that appears comes from that of a student rather than someone that could be stupid enough to consider his humble self any kind of authority. I still look foward to people contributing... especially to the errata section. &amp; as far as the political stuff... well, I believe it to be important but it kind of just leaks in now and again almost against my will.

It has been noticed that even some experienced phreaks have not mastered it&#39;s use. Beige boxing hinges (afaik) on the special type of alligator clip called &quot;bed-of-nails&quot; which has a spike which is attached to the clip which effectively pierces the insulation of the wire coming into contact with the underlying cable. Some hackers give up when the alligator clip is attached and the box doesn&#39;t work and are easily discouraged. The fact of the matter is, is that the clip has to be pressed upon (and that with force) until the spike pierces the aforesaid insulation, being careful not to come into contact with the other alligator clip or otherwise complete the circuit which would inevitably invite an unpleasant &amp; shocking awakening. [Note: I am describing here or only regurgitating what I have been told, and have not actually experimented with this. I was also informed that if one would graduate into the world of phone phreaking that one must not only read but in fact &quot;do&quot; and &quot;experiment&quot;.

Again we congratulate the people behind this venue for their humanity, backbone, courage and commitment to making this world a better more easygoing place. How many other places can we enjoy this kind of freedom?<br /><br />Today&#39;s program is number II in a series of VI devoted to the topic of Phreaking, which will hopefully be crowned by I-baLL&#39;s presentation.&nbsp; I am constantly overwhelmed by just how much information is out there and by how little I know. SK put foward the idea that we should have more hands on type stuff, like the cryptographic handouts we had in the beginning or bringing in pieces of equipment that we could take apart and learn about. I like the idea of a cable oriented episode where we could learn about different forms of cable, what makes them work and teach people how to crimp.<br /><br />SK and I welcomed a newcomer to the hour who showed great interest in the topic. Starbucks being closed for renovations may have been the cause for this unexpected boon to our fledgling community. SK helped me out in my fumbling when asked what a hacker is and gave his own definition, which to me seemed pretty consistent with what was written earlier under this (now over-bloated) topic . After grievances being aired with MS Word in particular and proprietary software in general, interest was shown in downloading and installing Open Office.&nbsp; I am surprised by how quickly some people just &quot;get it&quot;. Also, it was suggested that it would perhaps be prudent when writing long letters or emails to do so first offline using a text editor (remembering to save periodically) and when finished, copying and pasting to the email right before sending.<br /><br />Afterwards we talked a little more about numismatic coins and why it would not be cost-effective for criminals to counterfeit gold proofs. Even though Gold (Au) and Lead (Pb) are close enough together on the periodic table, it was stated that the properites of Lead would not allow it to hold the same level of detail as gold among other things.<br /><br />Hung out with Wakasm for awhile and watched him take apart a PS2, and it wasn&#39;t until I tried helping him fish out a small screw that got stuck to the magnet near the optical device with improvised tweezers fashioned from an insulated paper clip ;-) that I noticed how badly my hands were shaking due to withdrawals so had to go home. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Linksystems:</strong><br />OpenOffice (alternative to MS Office suite): <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.openoffice.org/</a><br />SKaReCRoW&#39;s page (still under construction): <a href="http://www.skarecrow.net/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.skarecrow.net/</a><br />Wakasm&#39;s Site: <a href="http://www.videogamebuddy.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.videogamebuddy.com/</a><br />There is another Mcast coming out of Astoria, but I haven&#39;t listened to it yet... so if you enjoy it tell us about it: <a href="http://www.thisshowagain.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.thisshowagain.com/</a><br />To learn more about wax cylinders: <a href="http://www.tinfoil.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.tinfoil.com/</a><br />TELECOM Digest &amp; Archives: <a href="http://massis.lcs.mit.edu/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://massis.lcs.mit.edu/</a><br />Voxio: <a href="http://www.voxioconsortium.com/home.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.voxioconsortium.com/home.html</a><br />Here is a most excellent site from a member of astorians that I never knew existed... until now; props Sorabji! <a href="http://www.payphone-project.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.payphone-project.com/</a><br /><br /><strong>Books, Magazines, Manuals &amp; other Media:</strong><br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>&quot;Telecom Digest Jan 5th 1994 vol.14 Issue 7&quot;,<br />d3c0d3r made reference to this issue... search for &quot;issue 7&quot; (without the quotes)<br /><a href="http://massis.lcs.mit.edu/archives/back.issues/1994.volume.14/vol14.iss001-050" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://massis.lcs.mit.edu/archives/back.issues/1994.volume.14/vol14.iss001-050</a></li><li>On the agressive telemarketer&#39;s number 416-214-9598: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/35d2f" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/35d2f</a><br />(a warning was given not to call this number; but if anybody is brave enough...)</li><li>[I don&#39;t know the status of the following numbers]</li></ul><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">206-222-2585 Default Daily<br />206-333-1942 d3c0d3r&#39;s Personal mailbox<br />206-600-1839 Default Daily mirrored<br />----------<br />206-424-3217 Zydeco&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zydeco" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zydeco</a><br />206-600-0687 Echos of the Past<br />206-736-2187 Area codes not in the continental U.S.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />[li]&quot;VLAN: Virtual Local Area Network and IEEE 802.1Q&quot; <a href="http://www.javvin.com/protocolVLAN.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.javvin.com/protocolVLAN.html</a>[/li][/list]<br /><br /><strong><a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/index.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span style="color: black;" class="bbc_color">T.O.M.s</span></a> (<em>Terminological Offensive Maneuvers</em>):</strong> (GLOSSARY)<br /><br /><em>NPA</em> - Numbering Plan Area or &quot;area code&quot;<br /><br /><em>victrola</em> - Precursor of the CD-player ... <a href="http://alephnull.net/20s/victrola/victrola.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">LINK</a><br /><br /><em>Meatspin</em> - I was first exposed to this .gif at a Japanese restaurant by friends from the local 2600.

Thanks again for your patience.</span><br /><br />This glorious summer day...just kidding... found SK buying the bagels and zeno quite late because he set his alarm clock to ten o&#39;clock <span class="bbc_u">p</span>.m. The Sakais were present, and someone else who I&#39;ve talked to before but whose name escapes me. Jayme showed up a little later as well.<br /><br />&nbsp; We took a little break from the series (presently on the topic of phreaking) and relaxed to a staple of the community... good ole fashion &quot;Off the Hook&quot;. In my introductory remarks I stated that I&#39;ve been listening to Emmanuel Goldstein for many years before I knew that he was into the hacking/phreaking scene. His importance to me was (and is) in the role of a social commentator, a voice of criticism, tolerance and dissent. I have personally derived much strength from his words which came to me via Frequency Modulation on many different radios at many different times. For those of us in New York, we have a great opportunity to listen to the show live on the air as they broadcast from the Empire State building every Wednesday night on WBAI 99.5 FM. They also stream via mp3 and even simulcast by shortwave (WBCQ 7415khz) if you are so inclined. Despite being often criticized, the show does in fact feature alot of technical content... and I personally like the fact that they highlight this subject against a human framework or context. Emmanuel&#39;s other show &quot;Off the Wall&quot; is devoted purely to politics, ranting and news, and not surprisingly, my favored of the two. I will say that they are both good shows and deserving of attention whether you disagree with the hosts or not, for they cover much news of global importance that is many times conveniently &quot;overlooked&quot; by the major commercial outlets... another reason why I love and support WBAI. Earlier this year someone wrote a post criticizing them quite harshly (which is all well and good) but when I offered a challenge for the critic to suggest a better or more informed alternative there was sadly no reply. So it goes...<br /><a href="http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=674.0" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Here is a link to the thread</a>... and yes... this tangent does concern technology. To save you time, it is four posts from the bottom. I am still waiting.<br /><br />There wasn&#39;t too much post-geeky discussion except that Jayme and I talked about World of Warcraft (which I&#39;ll probably begin playing) and which character classes I should choose from... which can definitely qualify as &#39;geeky&#39;. Which brings to mind a film that a friend sent to me via private messaging that I intended to link to last week. It&#39;s called <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7521044027821122670" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">&quot;Fear of Girls&quot;</a> (which I&#39;ll list again under the links section). Enjoy!&nbsp; :-) Note: The video starts playing right away when you follow the link... see below for a direct download.<br /><br />Special Note: It was mentioned during the show that if anyone is interested in having an alternative news service in the form of <span class="bbc_u">BBC World</span> appear for those who subscribe to Time Warner Cable or intend to subscribe, there is someone that you can write to concerning this (and be nice):<br /><br />Robert Watson, Vice President of Programming New Business Developement<br />c/o Time Warner Cable<br />120 E. 23rd Street, 9th Floor<br />New York, N.Y. 10010<br /><br />If you send &quot;Off the Hook&quot; a copy of your letter and we succeed in getting BBC World, Emmanual promises to compensate you somehow with some form of prize.

To make matters worse when the timer went off I didn&#39;t shut the oven off until right before I left... and while the pies did not burn there was not sufficient time for the tray that I carry them on the cool down!

SK, you should know, is a straight-up Linux guy. And while X (I have to get his handle later) showed no interest in debate he defended his OS of choice with conviction. While I must side with people like Adam Kosmin on this issue due to the ethics of proprietary software, I am still curious to know more about Apple&#39;s technology and practices and hope that X will be able to give a presentation himself on the subject. He seemed lik a very warm and enthusiastic guy.

I-Ball has yet to give his presentation, but please forgive us because I am sure that everyone can empathize with the hectic nature of unforgiving schedules. In choosing PLA Radio (which is in fact a new venture) by the people from the well established &amp; renowned Phone Loosers of America I felt that I could not go wrong... which btw went over very, very well. The crowd at the Peach today really seemed to get into the show as the content IMO was not only hilarious but very informative as well.<br /><br />&nbsp;Even though this is the end of a planned series, Phone Phreaking is a very large and involved topic which we will be treating again in the future. The nature of the telephone system is so intertwined with today&#39;s society and so ubiquitous that it is easy to take for granted and as a result this glaring achievment in technological innovation (now approaching 2 centuries old) which has indelibly changed the face of human history is easily overlooked. Everyone knows what a telephone is... but I believe that only a handful actually knows <em>how</em> it works or why it may be vital to have this knowledge.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Linksys:</strong><br /><br /><a href="http://www.stoprelayabuse.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.stoprelayabuse.com/</a><br /><a href="http://www.phonelosers.org/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.phonelosers.org/</a><br /><br /><strong>Books, Magazines, Manuals &amp; other Media:</strong><br /><br /><strong><a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/index.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span style="color: black;" class="bbc_color">T.O.M.s</span></a> <br />(<em>Terminological Offensive Maneuvers</em>):</strong> (GLOSSARY)<br /><br />phone mobbing:<br /><br />voice bridge:<br /><br />relay operator:<br /><br />prank call:<br /><br />lemon party:<br /><br /><strong><em>Projects...</em></strong> <br /><br /><strong>Pong update:</strong><br /><strong><em><span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color">M</span><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">K</span><span style="color: yellow;" class="bbc_color">-</span><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">U</span><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">l</span><span style="color: indigo;" class="bbc_color">t</span><span style="color: violet;" class="bbc_color">r</span><span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color">a</span>Pong</em></strong> <br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15pt;" class="bbc_size">Props</span><br /><br /><br /><strong>Errata:</strong><br /><br />[Massively <strong>Under Construction</strong>]</div>
