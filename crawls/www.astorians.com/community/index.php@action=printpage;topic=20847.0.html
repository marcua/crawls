				If that&#039;s true, I&#039;m happy. My better half lives right across the street from there. Will save him a lot of trips to <br />Tradefair, especially when he has his kids for the weekend.

				If this is a halfway decent market, it will be a gold mine.&nbsp; And even better if it&#039;s along the lines of a nicer quality, organic market.&nbsp; There are tons of people in that immediate area dying for a place like that they can walk to.

				Has anyone else seen the new Newtown Farmer&#039;s Market?&nbsp; I was wondering what the space would be and now the signs are up stating it will be a farmer&#039;s market.&nbsp; It is on the corner of Newtown and Crescent.&nbsp; Not sure when it will ofiicially be open.&nbsp; They have been working on the space for a while.

				Still brown paper on the windows but I saw more activity last night.&nbsp; The awning and signage is nice.&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait for it to open.&nbsp; Lower Astoria Blvd is finally starting to come around.&nbsp; It took long enough.&nbsp; I remember when City View Pharmacy was the only thing that was halfway decent for blocks.

				I also saw lights on and walls painted with some signage (inside) so I also got the impression it will be soon.&nbsp; People nearby are extremely excited for this.&nbsp; If it&#039;s good, they will do extremely well, to say the least.&nbsp; I also think this will really crank up the whole renaissance of Astoria Blvd that&#039;s taking place.&nbsp; It&#039;s been really pretty seedy for a long time up to the past year or so.

				I&#039;ve seen deliveries all week and they have roll-away produce carts outside. <br /><br />The sign is still there but they may have to turn down the brightness a little.&nbsp; &nbsp;It lights up whe whole building across the street.&nbsp; &nbsp;If I lived there, I&#039;d trade the orange mood lighting for a spitting-distance supermarket any day.

				Well, I just passed by and the owner is in a suit, there are employees inside with hats and smocks scrambling to apply finishing touches.&nbsp; <br /><br />The word I got is that they&#039;re opening in a few hours...

				If it&#039;s stocked with fair-priced, quality, and healthy foods, he will do extremely well.&nbsp; He&#039;s filling a huge gap in that area.&nbsp; I don&#039;t remember hearing such excitement in a neighborhood for a food market to open.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m really hoping it&#039;s like a private, mini Whole Foods/Trader Joes kind of place.

				I just stopped by on my way home from work.&nbsp; Overall, I think that this place has lots of potential.&nbsp; They do have some nice stuff there and they are clearly still stocking so I look forward to what they might have.&nbsp; I have to say though, i was a little disappointed at the prices.&nbsp; Not everything, but a few things that i like to use as gauges were at the higher end of the spectrum.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was happy to see Empire chicken there...although it was $3.79/lb<br /><br />It does seem that they are attempting to be sort of a private/smaller version of whole foods, lots of the same products...

				I walked over last night to check it out.&nbsp; It looks like it&#039;s coming along and can be really great.&nbsp; There was a decent chunk of empty shelf space; which I&#039;m assuming is for more stock not in yet.&nbsp; The owner came up to us when we came in; he was very nice.&nbsp; He talked about Whole Foods a lot, so people who have compared it are right.&nbsp; He said that a lot of people were surprised at the produce cost, so he was thinking about getting a blend of&nbsp; conventional/organic stock.&nbsp; It was a smaller store, so a little less variety, but enough that I was really happy.&nbsp; My partner did notice that there weren&#039;t many vegetarian products (no tofu, not a great variety of veggie &quot;meats&quot;), so I hope that they will get more.&nbsp; Also, they didn&#039;t have a lot of &quot;fat free&quot; options.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />All said and done though, I like independent grocery stores and living off of the Trade Fair on Ditmars now where the roof leeks, there are bugs, and I have witnessed the staff do some pretty gross things; I&#039;m pretty happy.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be moving to 21st and Astoria Blvd. at the end of the month and my only MAJOR issue was the grocery store lack, and this fills the gap nicely.&nbsp;

				I thought it was ok, but wasn&#039;t very impressed. Some prices are higher than Key Food and while I understand<br />they&#039;re still stocking, the selection in areas where they were stocked wasn&#039;t great. <br /><br /><br />Plus, a new market ought to have sales, promotions, etc. to get people in the door. I saw nothing like that. <br /><br /><br />Also, things like peanut butter, frozen vegetables, soup, etc. were all more than I pay now in Key Food <br />and Trade Fair. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m all for supporting local businesses, but I&#039;m also on a tight budget. And I&#039;ve also become very spoiled shopping at Trader Joe&#039;s near my office. I get double the amount of food there for $20 that I do anywhere <br />else. I shop where the selection and prices are best, not because a business is in my neighborhood. Sorry.<br /><br />

				If it&#039;s a small store, it&#039;s going to cost more than a huge store like Key Food. That&#039;s just the way these things work, they can&#039;t buy in the volume that a large grocery store can so their prices will be higher. They&#039;ll have to find a niche in having unique product, being convenient, etc.

				I was there on Sunday and it&#039;s pretty much everything I hoped it would be.&nbsp; And I hope it&#039;s even better when they&#039;re completely stocked and up and running.&nbsp; I&#039;m very happy that there will be a fresh fish and seafood market in there.&nbsp; There isn&#039;t a good fish market anywhere near that area.&nbsp; At the risk of sounding like a total snob, I&#039;m really glad it&#039;s not a Key Food type store in quality or price.&nbsp; I was hoping for a high end market with better brands and a more interesting selection of foods.&nbsp; And that&#039;s what they seem to have delivered.&nbsp; I also didn&#039;t get the impression they were necessarily charging inflated prices.&nbsp; Though being the only such store for many blocks, he almost could have.&nbsp; Very happy about this place!&nbsp; I actually hope they beef up the butcher area a bit (literally) with a better selection of steaks.&nbsp; But the NY Strip I bought yesterday was excellent.

We were told the official opening isn&#039;t until this weekend, 11/20/2011. The owner and manager both introduced themselves to us and asked for feedback. They explained that the shelves are just getting stocked and to expect more variety in the coming weeks. They also told us to feel free to request items they don&#039;t carry.&nbsp; <br /><br />I found the prices to be slightly higher than Trade Fair on some items but better than the other markets and super markets. I also like the mix of ethnic foods, produce, and the availability of commercial brand stuff. It&#039;s almost as if Key and Trade Fair merged. <br /><br />Our only issue was at the check out. Over half the items we purchased couldn&#039;t be scanned but the manager came over and explained that they hadn&#039;t scanned all the items through the system yet.&nbsp; I look forward to shopping there this weekend.&nbsp; I live in the Astoria NW building and I know many others who live around that area are happy to see this locally owned grocery open up in the neighborhood.

The area is in need of a non-bodega market for fresh produce and meats. The prices are good, service was very kind/welcoming, and it&#039;s a beautiful store. I do think they&#039;ll do well. Now, if the POS system doesn&#039;t work this week, for the OPENING, I&#039;d say you have a point.

				I went by there last night. I was greeted by the owner (older Greek man), who apologized for no heat in the store (to which I answered: better for the produce :-) ) --- He also advised me to keep in mind that more products will fill the shelfs by Sunday (official opening day).<br /><br /><br />I browsed the isles, bought a pound of deli ham, some apples. The checkout required a system restart and re-scan of all my products, but I was in no rush, and started chatting with (what&nbsp; appeared to be) the manager.<br /><br /><br />I recommended, they get on Facebook and start spreading the name &amp; any specials/deals they plan for the holidays season. I felt, like the prices we a bit higher than TF - closer to KF... but still, it&#039;s 2 (!) blocks from my house (and just down the block from the liquor store:) ---<br /><br /><br />As a thank-you, I got their orange grocery bag, gratis :-) --- Looking forward to Sunday and onward.

				I&#039;ve been in it a few times now—my boyfriend lives just steps away from it so we stop there sometimes for tomatoes, lettuce, just basics. But I have yet to see any sales in this store. I&#039;ve walked up and down many aisles and nothing. Nothing on sale in the frozen section, nothing on sale with cereal, soup, - these are just random products I&#039;ve checked. I asked one of the cashiers about when they&#039;ll start having some sales and they didn&#039;t know.<br /><br /><br />Plus, as I&#039;ve said before, their prices on things are higher than Key Food and Tradefair - in some cases a dollar or more higher. I&#039;m the type of person that, if the store has a good selection and good prices, I&#039;ll go out of my way to shop there. But I don&#039;t see why they have no specials at all. Vitamin Water for 99 cents a bottle doesn&#039;t cut it for me. Too bad because it&#039;s a well-designed space, good lighting and very clean.

				I haven&#039;t been there, but based on what people are saying about the prices and selection it sort of sounds more like a nice bodega than a real grocery store, kind of like the late Astoria Farmers Market on Ditmars. Since that one closed, I&#039;m wondering if they&#039;re related.

				I&#039;ve been here a few times and wanted to be a die hard customer, given that it&#039;s a conveniently located, small, and local business. I will still go for smaller, middle of the week, shoppings. Unfortunately, I save much more (and still can find non hormone/free range meets) going to Key Food. <br /><br />I do think the owners have a learning curve. I overheard a worker (seemed like an assistant manager type) informing one of the owners how to restock; explaining, breaking it down, pricing, and then putting on the shelf was the correct order. The manager responded with &quot;ok&quot; but then questioned why stocking was taking long---the worker explained that reorders should be spaced out differently and that in order to scan in the new bar codes for newer products, and individually price, the manager needs to expect longer turn around time.<br /><br />

				I want to update my last review. I shopped at Newton Market on Christmas Eve and today.&nbsp; On the Eve, I left something on the counter and had already crossed the street and walked down 2 blocks.&nbsp; A kind woman who works at the store ran after me with the package! I felt awful and consider that beyond typical good service.&nbsp; Today, I noticed that they seem to be mixing in more non gourmet, typical grocery items, for similar prices to Key Foods.&nbsp; And the POS thing is completely worked out.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I&#039;d say they are making improvements rather quickly but maybe opened a few weeks too early!

				Agreed -- they had about two things that I found exciting. These were, unfortunately, frozen and canned items. Not really a market by any stretch of the imagination. We need a TJ&#039;s or Whole Foods. Why don&#039;t small retailers realize there is a huge market for this stuff in Astoria?

				I&#039;ve said a few times in posts here that I was disappointed with this market. I&#039;m very price-conscious and it amazed me that their prices were often higher than Key Food on basics like peanut butter. And no sales on anything, at least not the last time I was in there.<br /><br /><br />I work near the TJ&#039;s in Chelsea on 21st St. &amp; 6th Ave. and am always impressed with how much more I can buy $10 or $20 than I can<br />in Astoria at Trade Fair or Key Food. <br /><br /><br />It&#039;s too bad that companies like TJ don&#039;t realize the untapped market potential they&#039;re missing out on in Astoria, especially with the two<br />empty Blockbuster locations on Broadway and over at Ditmars. <br /><br /><br />The last thing we need are more bakeries or banks....<br /><br />

				Trader Joe&#039;s isn&#039;t really a fair comparison for prices because they mostly carry their own brand of products, like Aldi. Also I&#039;m sure they are aware that they could do very well in Astoria. There must be other reasons why they aren&#039;t putting a store here, but then again it&#039;s taken them a while to put many stores in NYC at all. But between Newtown Farmer&#039;s Market and Astoria Farmer&#039;s Market, I&#039;m now skeptical of any place opening in Astoria that has &quot;Farmer&#039;s Market&quot; in the name. I&#039;ll be surprised if the upcoming California Farmer&#039;s Market is anything other than an overpriced grocery store that sells the usual basic products and mediocre produce.

				Yes, most of what TJ&#039;s sells is their own brand. However, everything I&#039;ve tried so far from dijon mustard to tuna, cereal, bread, etc. has been very good quality. I won&#039;t buy something just because it&#039;s cheaper. And I will pay more for something I think is better than its competition. With TJ&#039;s though, every thing I&#039;ve tried has been been great. <br /><br /><br />And their produce is very good. I buy a lot of it - mostly fruit - and it&#039;s high quality and a good price. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;ll just have to keep lugging home my shopping bags of groceries from work....<br /><br /><br /><br />

				they had a notepad for people to write product suggestions which they probably just tossed in the trash.<br /><br />another misstep is the portion sizes.<br />I prefer to buy 6 packs of eggs, not a dozen, since I can&#039;t finish them before they go bad.<br />they only have &#039;em by the dozen so I buy them elsewhere.<br /><br />soymilk, they only have the half gallons. I prefer quarts so I buy them elsewhere.<br /><br />the dog and cat food section is also weaksauce.<br /><br />I go there and buy tomatoes, onions, avocadoes, lemons, etc. and spend about $5.<br /><br />I would spend $40 and up if they had the other above mentioned items.<br />

				I must update my review.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Almost everything in the freezer sections has freezer burn. And I went to pick up some yogurt tonight, and for the 3rd time in a row, almost all the yogurt was expired, SOMETIMES BY A MONTH.&nbsp; I keep trying to give this places chances because it would be great for the area. Sadly, I&#039;ve given up hope. <br /><br /><br />The owner seems like a total sketch ball.

				So, obviously, there is no money really coming in, right?&nbsp; If he can&#039;t afford fresh goods in the freezer than clear it out! Better empty than covered in freezer burn.

When I hit Crescent and Newtown, I saw a store that I hadn&#039;t been to before and was surprised to find out that it was the infamous, Newtown Farmers Market that I&#039;ve read so much about on this board. &quot;Surely, it can&#039;t really be as bad as everyone makes it out to be on Astorians&quot;, I thought to myself, &quot;It&#039;s probably no Trader Joe&#039;s but it can&#039;t be that bad&quot;. Upon entering the store and walking down the first aisle, I knew that I was definitely mistaken. The shelves were half empty. The product was, in several cases, place one item deep and spread out to take up as shelf space as possible, so as to not look empty. The red meat was a strange grayish color with a little pink here or there. The fresh produce was practically non-existent, especially for a &quot;farmer&#039;s market&quot; to consigned to a table next to a stainless sink of questionable cleanliness with brown runny heads of iceberg lettuce dripping into it. The only thing that seems to keep them going is their location and the few Mexican staples that they to seem stock and sell on a regular basis. Everything else seemed to be expired, frost covered or potentially dangerous. Gray meat?<br />On a positive note I made my way to Berry Fresh Farm 2.0 a little later. What a great transformation this store is under going,<br /><br />-=:Astoristani:=-<br />

				This past Sunday I stopped in at Newtown Farmers Mkt.&nbsp; Bear in mind this was before reading recent comments in this thread.&nbsp; I was very surprised at how run down the place appeared.&nbsp; &nbsp;The market had an air of emptyness and a depressing sadness about the place.&nbsp; I don&#039;t normally shop there but stopped in to buy a couple of small items. The selection very lacking.&nbsp; The few items on the shelves had a left over feeling to them.&nbsp; <br />I walked out of the place without buying and am sure the next time I walk by it will be closed.
