				It&#039;s that time again... time for the ASHM&#039;s SWAP! This is open to the community at large you do not have to be a member of ASHM (Astoria Stay at Home Mom&#039;s Group).<br /><br />Here&#039;s the information:<br />CLOTHING: Bring all your gently used baby/children clothes and maternity clothes. Please no stained, torn, or damaged clothing.<br /><br />TOYS: Bring all your toys that are clean and in working condition.<br /><br />GEAR: Bring all your gently used baby/children/ and maternity gear. Books about maternity or child rearing will be considered gear.<br /><br />BOOKS: Children can bring in their books that they don&#039;t read anymore. For each book a child brings in s/he will get one ticket. The tickets can be used to redeem other books. No adult books will be part of the book swap. Books about maternity or child rearing will be considered gear as described above.<br /><br />Only children&#039;s books will receive tickets for even exchange of other books. There is no requirement of even exchange for clothing, toys, or gear. We do encourage everyone to bring something to the swap- and also to take some home!<br /><br />All left over clothing, toys, gear, or books will be donated to the Steinway Reform Church for their annual Ladies Guild Sale.<br /><br />BAKE SALE: Please try to bring a baked good to the bake sale (You are not required, however, to do so). Baked Good will be sold and proceeds will be donated to Food Bank for New York City http://www.foodbanknyc.org<br />Everyone participating is asked to bake at least one treat, serving 20-30 people. It can be anything—cookies, breads, brownies, muffins, cupcakes, etc... be creative, use what you have! Original recipes are preferred, but boxed mix items are welcomed as well (no ready made treats, please).<br />Everything doesn&#039;t have to be a sweet. You can go savory and sugar free, as well. No “main course” food or appetizers, please.<br />Sweets and treats can be individually wrapped or served “a la carte.” Napkins, plates, and baggies will be provided at the site, or you can wrap your treats in advance.<br /><br /><br />Please spread the word!<br />The sale will be open to everyone in the community!<br />Lastly... we need help! If you can help to bake, set up, clean up, help organize, or anything in-between, please, RSVP for this event on astoriafamilies.org where more details are posted.<br />Hope to see you there!<br /><br />SAT Nov 22nd<br />9 am to 12pm<br />Steinway Reform Church<br />c/o of Ditmars blvd &amp; 41st St<br />Astoria, NY
