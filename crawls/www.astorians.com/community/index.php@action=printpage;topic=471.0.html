				Jonathan, like I mentioned at dinner, Rosario's doesn't have an incredibly wide selection, but I think what he does have shows his care in what he has selected. &nbsp;My favourite is Corsignano. &nbsp;It is indeed a pecorino toscano, and the name of the town where it comes from is now Pienza.<br /><br />Oh, and the name of the bleu cheese I was thinking of is Mirableu. &nbsp;Does that ring a bell? &nbsp;My description of it shortly after I ate it was &quot;it's a Spanish sheep's milk bleu cheese called Mirableu. Stunning. We've never tasted anything like it. Definitely a bleu cheese, but rich, dense and creamy beyond belief, nicely counterbalancing the sharpness that bleu can have.&quot;<br /><br />I spoke with Rosario several times about whether he would be able to order it, but I never followed through. &nbsp;He was willing to look into it, though - and may be willing to consider carrying other cheeses if you speak with him.<br /><br />I should add that there is another shop with quite a number of cheeses on Ditmars between 31st and 33rd, next to the Dunkin Donuts. &nbsp;I think it's called something like &quot;Greek and Italian Delicatessen&quot;. &nbsp;I haven't been in there in quite a few years, though. &nbsp;About 10 years ago I was able to find both real Gruyere and Emmentaler there, although the owner was quite peeved that I insisted he cut from both wheels.

				L, here is the cheese shop we told you about last night. &nbsp;<br /><br />Village Cheese Shop North<br />(631) 298-8556<br />105 Love Ln<br />Mattituck, NY 11952<br /><br />Ricardo is the man to speak with (at least i think that is his name). &nbsp;With his guidance we picked out 4 cheeses, fig paste and a terrine of duck.<br /><br /><br />We should make a group trip to murrays on bleecker street.

				Sounds like a great idea. &nbsp;Jim might be off fishing, though - striped bass season is starting.<br /><br />And Jonathan, thanks for getting the name of the Mattituck cheese shop. &nbsp;At least if Jim goes fishing, I can make him stop off and pick up some mirableu. &nbsp;<br /><br />We also like the Bedford Cheese Shop (http://www.bedfordcheeseshop.com/) in Williamsburg, when we can get there. &nbsp;But that's not much help for us Astorians.

				Hey Jonathan, <br /><br />I just wanted to add that, as you may know, the new Murray's is bigger than the old one and possibly even more crowded. If you're bringing a big group, you might want to go as early as possible. Its packed in there and now they have this obnoxious &quot;take a number&quot; system.

				Hmmm, good point. &nbsp; I thought we should go there last so that we dont carry cheese around all day.<br /><br />Maybe we should just go to murrays early, then for wine and then home.<br /><br />Will you be joining?

				I doubt it. I'm a regular as it is. If I add any more cheese to my diet they'll make me take two numbers. I think I will try and make your next dinner outing, tho.<br /><br />While your down there, make sure to take the gang to Aphrodesia - the most amazing spice shop in NYC - right down the block. Of course the new stores Wild Edibles, Amy's, etc are great, tho, I am sad that they replaced that nice store that was there. Also, and hit O &amp; Co. (formerly Olivers - dumb name change) for artisianal olive oil. There's also the Puerto Rican Coffee Co on the other side of 6th Av and some clutch tea place - I don't even think it has a name. Bleeker is the *real* <em>Gourmet Ghetto</em>. There's a zillion great restaurants, too, but since you're a chef, I bet you know the area better than I as it is.

				Aphrodesia is a hippie herbal and medicinal store. great place, been there for ages and they have nice cats that run the place. &nbsp;I havent been to the other spice store. &nbsp;where is it?<br /><br />Cheese is right, there is so much on bleeker street. We have to go to porto rico for coffee and choc espreso beans. &nbsp;There is Raffettas on w. houston and mc dougal for fresh made pasta and sauces.<br />joes dairy on sullican and w houston for home made mozz and smoked mozz.<br />must stop for an espresso and cafe dante on mcdougal.<br />Also bagels on the square (bleeker/carmine) is a great find.<br />Would like to see the new wild edibles store too.<br /><br />This sounds like a very exciting foodie sort of day.

				I don't know, but I can't think of a time I've been stumped at Aphrodesia. I'll have to try your place out, tho. One of the other benefits to Aphrodesia is that the owner runs the shop herself and she always has the scuttlebutt on what's going on in the neighborhood. She's been there since the 60s. Its fun to chat with her.

				Well, I definitely want to check out Aphrodesia. &nbsp;We can swap. &nbsp;I actually haven't been to Kalustyan's in a few years - I used to work a block away. &nbsp;Oy, make that six years, then. &nbsp;(But from what I've heard from people I know, they've only gotten better since then.) &nbsp;I'm usually so crazed at work (this summer's an unfortunate exception) that I really have to take location into consideration. &nbsp;Sigh.

				I love the Bleeker/foodie trip idea. &nbsp;I would love try to see as much as we can, within a reasonable amount of time. &nbsp;I would like to check out Aphrodesia and by chance I need to get some coffee at Porto Rico. &nbsp;Good call on Murray's being last. &nbsp;I've been in the new store and even though it's crowded there, I never feel as claustrophobic as I did when it was crowded at the old place (which had its charm apart from the crowds). &nbsp;They carry this yummy Dalmatian fig and orange spread that I love, too.<br /><br />LUCKY JAYME GOING TO PARIS. &nbsp;I have never been, and that's a shame. &nbsp;Imagine, me, a harpsichordist, having never been to one of the most important harpsichord places. &nbsp;I need to change that.<br /><br />Kalustyans is great! &nbsp;Love all the grains and such you can get there in addition to the spices. &nbsp;They have a very nice selection of middle eastern pastries, too.<br /><br />I am very hungry after working an absolutely hopeless and painful temp job today in a real estate/developer's office. &nbsp;I need something less agonizingly mind melting. &nbsp;However, the good part is that it is a block away from the Union Square Greenmarket, which is rockin. &nbsp;I bought 3 big tomatoes for $1! &nbsp;The guy was trying to get rid of things. &nbsp;Bought some cheese, too, yum.<br /><br />I'm off to cook my CSA veggies and eat my &quot;Womanchego&quot; cheese (they call it that) I bought today.

				Rosario's is an Italian gourmet deli under the Ditmars train stop, across the street from the fire yesterday. &nbsp;His cheese selection isn't huge, but it's carefully selected. &nbsp;He focuses on Italian cheeses, but not necessarily the standards, although he has them, too. &nbsp;I think it's the best offering of its kind in the Ditmars area.<br /><br />They make their own mozzarella and fresh ricotta, both of which are very good. &nbsp;They also have a good olive selection, including one incredible bright green, round olive that explodes with a salty buttery flavour. &nbsp;I've never tasted anything like it anywhere else.<br /><br />Plus an interesting selection of imported grocery items.
