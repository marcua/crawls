				So, while my Specialized hybrid was a great starter bike, and still serves me well on the commute, it's time to move on. When I'm in Manhattan on my cheezy low end stock bike amid all the fixies and messenger hipness, I feel like I just rolled in from Topeka. (No offense to any Kansans on the board...but...you know.)<br /><br />I want to build myself a city bike, probably fixed gear, and instead of going to a shop I want to do it myself. Learnin' experience, and all. I'm also thinking of using used components, so I don't have to worry as much about theft. The problem is, my wrenching experience as of yet doesn't extend much further than pumping up the tires (cause, if I work on my own bike, f. up and can't put the thing back together, I'm stuck walking...)<br /><br />Anyone have any words of advice before I embark on this fool's errand? Better yet, anyone able to suggest where I could pick up supercheap used parts or a frame? Even more better, is there somebody out there who'll barter wrench skills for booze, once I realise that not only do I not know how to secure a bottom bracket, I don't know what one -is-?

				If you could possibly make it to Ronkonkoma (easy by way of LIRR), get over to the Freewheel Collective!<br /><br />It's a place that offers free bike repair, workshops, and access to tools so that you can do-it-yourself. They exist for the purpose of providing free bikes and repairs to low-income members of the community, but welcome people who want to practice their wrenching skills as well.<br /><br />Do a Google search on them- I don't have their exact address/web info handy at the moment.

				You also might try the Time's Up people. &nbsp;They hold a number of bike repair/bike mechanic workshops:<br /><br />http://www.times-up.org/bike_workshop.php
