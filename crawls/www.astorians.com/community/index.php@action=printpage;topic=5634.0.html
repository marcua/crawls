				I lied. I already have a share partner.<br /><br />But maybe <strong>you</strong> don&#039;t. Did you know that the Astoria CSA shares are much bigger than the Hellgate CSA shares? (They are also more expensive, you know.)<br /><br />So if you are considering joining the Astoria CSA (http://www.astoriacsa.com) (pickups thursdays at Cafe Bar), but think there will be too much food for you, then please leave a post here. <br /><br />It&#039;s a virtual CSA Match.com!<br /><br />

				I&#039;m definitely interested but would want to share with <strong>at least</strong> one other person - I&#039;m only me and while I love fresh fruits and veggies I can&#039;t consume a 4 person share.<br /><br />Anybody interested?

				Just a quick note to say that the Astoria CSA enrollment event, at Cafe Bar this Tuesday (March 27) at 7pm will be a great place meet others who are interested in splitting a share.&nbsp; We will be distributing &quot;I need to split a share&quot; stickers to identify those who are looking to split and Core members will be mingling and helping out by making introductions for those who need assistance.<br /><br />Come out and be a part of the fun and meet our farmers!<br /><br />Cafe Bar<br />34th Avenue and 36th Street<br />7pm<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hi folks -- I&#039;ve found someone to partner with, but if you&#039;re looking around, in addition to the postings on this board, you can contact the CSA directly as they&#039;re helping to facilitate share partnering.&nbsp; Good luck and hope to see you all later in the spring!

				<strong>I keep seeing people saying they are looking for a share partner, but it is hard to reach them, because they don&#039;t have their email in their profile, so that little envelope to contact them doesn&#039;t show up.&nbsp; <br /><br />So... if they don&#039;t put their email address directly in the body of the post, it is very hard for people to contact them.<br /><br />Your mileage may vary.<br />Margaret</strong>

				I have a question regarding share partnering that maybe someone could answer here. Who is responsible for splitting the shares? Is that done at the farm, or would that be something done at Cafe Bar during pick up by the share partners themselves? Just curious...

				The sharing goes on when the food is picked up. So, one of the share partners could pick up all the veggies and then the others could pick them up from them.

				Share partners will be responsible for dividing up the weekly share. We will have a cutting board and knife at the distro site for those harder to split items if you don&#039;t want to take them back to a home to split. Our Core Member Wendy is helping people find share partners too. Please email info@astoriacsa.com with &quot;looking for share partner&quot; in the subject and we&#039;ll forward you along the proper route.
