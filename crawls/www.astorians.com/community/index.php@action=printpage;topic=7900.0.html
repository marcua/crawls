				I saw the Goldman&#039;s on the Today Show this morning. &nbsp;They were being interviewed as to why they are profiting from the book. &nbsp;Their answer basically boiled down to just so Simpson won&#039;t profit from it. &nbsp;They actually said they do hope people buy the book. &nbsp;The whole thing has brought a rift between Nicole&#039;s family and the Goldman&#039;s. &nbsp;Considering they made no mention of what the money will be used for that they will receive, I have to agree with the Brown&#039;s. &nbsp;No amount of money will bring Nicole or Ron back and they just seem very greedy to me. &nbsp;How many steak dinners are they having with that money? &nbsp;At least give some to charity.

				Maybe he heard that the &quot;real killer&quot; was working the casino cage and was just looking to find the guy.<br /><br />I am not generally a fan of the Goldman&#039;s, but I can almost see where they&#039;re coming from.&nbsp; After all, if O.J. were to profit from the sale of the book, he would doubtfully fail to donate any of the money to charity.
