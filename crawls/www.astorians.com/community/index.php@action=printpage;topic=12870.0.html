				It&#039;s expensive, especially considering that same guys who were cooking omelets and making sandwiches are not making Wasabi Tuna and other stuff, and prices are up. Lighting is down.&nbsp; &nbsp;There isn&#039;t&nbsp; alegit cook back in that kitchen. They are crowded though, as they usually were before renovation (so much for all that bad economy talk)<br /><br />

				My boyfriend and I ate brunch at Sanford&#039;s on Sunday, and it was as good as I remembered. The prix fixe price was raised to $12 from $11, but the atmosphere of the place was worth it. Try the crabcakes benedict. It&#039;s amazing. And that&#039;s $12 for a mimosa (though we got there too early for them to serve alcohol), coffee, and meal.<br /><br />Why did it shut down in the first place? Someone in a previous post mentioned a fire?

				We&#039;ve visited four times now since the renovation: once for dessert, twice for dinner, and once for breakfast.&nbsp; I found the previous decor and layout to be a bit &quot;eh,&quot; but the space is much nicer now and I find it to be a pretty relaxing place to have a meal.<br /><br />Some thoughts:<br /><br />Weekday breakfast: $5 for french toast, sausage, juice, and coffee.&nbsp; The french toast was pretty standard, the sausage was good, but not exceptional, and the juice was in a small glass.&nbsp; That said, this may be the best thing you can still get for five bucks.&nbsp; The place wasn&#039;t busy (it was around 9:30am), so this would be a good time to go do some work there.<br /><br />Dinner: Wow, the bistro burger is to die for: pepper jack cheese, bacon, and some twisted sort of aioli.&nbsp; Deluxe comes with fries, lettuce and tomato and its under 10 dollars.&nbsp; My fellow diner likes trying different beers, and thought the list had some interesting choices: he ordered a Japanese beer that had a hint of pine.&nbsp; We spent some time sitting at the bar and the place seems serious about wine--they have a major sealing system that keeps the bottles fresh (unlike so many places I see that just shove a cork in the top of the bottle).<br /><br />Dessert: A very serviceable brownie bowl and a superb banana in a fried tortilla with ice cream.&nbsp; Both around 5 dollars.<br /><br />Overall: I&#039;d say this is a good value, actually.&nbsp; The food is good, the prices seem to be in line with what you&#039;re getting, and the decor is nice.

				I think Sanford&#039;s is great...previously my wife and I ate there and were shocked at the varied menu and how good the food was...it was a case of the food, menu, wine / beer list really being better than the decor, and now they&#039;ve matched the two. The pasta dishes are amazingly good; love the one with avocado cream sauce. The owner, or who I perceive the be the owner, seems like a nice guy who has always come over to our table and asked how everything was even though we don&#039;t know him or anything. Good food and service, and it&#039;s great to see it so crowded since the renovations. This place has been in the neighborhood for a long time, and I&#039;m happy to see it succeed with it&#039;s new setup!

				Sanford&#039;s has completed the transition from diner to trendy restaurant.&nbsp; It&#039;s noisier and darker, and I suppose they&#039;ve bid good riddance to the downscale types who used to eat at the counter.&nbsp; I no longer feel comfortable there.<br /><br />I remarked that I missed their fries, which are no longer on the menu.&nbsp; I especially miss the sweet potato fries.&nbsp; The guy who seems to be the manager said they still have fries, and pointed to the sides at the bottom of one page of the menu.&nbsp; I pointed out it says &quot;sweet mash, garlic mash&quot; but no fries.&nbsp; In any case, they no longer come free with wraps or panini.<br /><br />But I must face it, I&#039;m one of those downscale types.&nbsp; I&#039;ll still keep Sanford&#039;s in mind for ordering out, but if I want to eat in, I&#039;ll eat at Michael&#039;s.<br /><br />The same people also own Petey&#039;s.&nbsp; Burgers for the peasants.

				We tried Sanfords last weekend and my reaction was similar to that of LadyWithPans. The music was too much bass and treble - all bass drums and cymbals, sufficiently loud to disrupt reading or serious conversation. The food was good enough. The wine was good; a glass of wine comes in a precious tiny carafe - that seemed really silly.<br /><br />As we left, my friend pointed out that they had charged a dollar more than the menu said for her turkey club (10.95 vs 9.95, as I recall.) Since it&#039;s a computer cash-register, I wouldn&#039;t expect that to happen. I wish I had kept the receipt to see what other prices were enhanced.<br /><br />After the annoying music, and being chiseled on the check, I don&#039;t think I will be back. But, to judge by the capacity crowd, other people have different priorities than I do.

				While Sanford&#039;s was packed the first few weeks after it reopened, I noticed in the past few weeks the crowds have thinned out.&nbsp; Good thing because I did not like waiting for a table.&nbsp; I am very impressed with this incarnation of Sanfords...food is excellent and atmosphere is very trendy and inviting.&nbsp; Service is brisk and efficient.&nbsp; Highly recommend the chicken stir frys.

				I have to agree with a few of the posters.I like it the way it used to be.It&#039;s not Tom&#039;s from Seinfeld for sure.I like a diner to have that old NY classic diner feel to it.Since they closed I have been going to Neptunes,Micheals and Bel Aire when I&#039;m in the mood for Diner food.I have been to Sanfords and While its more pleasant to the eye and the food is good I just hate the music blasting and the upscale feeling they added to it.If I wanted that I might as well go to Grand Cafe which IMO is better than Sanfords.

				I&#039;m also not a fan of their hip make-over.&nbsp; It&#039;s nice that the prices haven&#039;t gone up much or not at all, but I just will avoid eating there.&nbsp; It&#039;s far from a relaxing dining experience when you have to compete with their thumping music to be heard.&nbsp; Who thought that was good idea?!&nbsp; &nbsp;
