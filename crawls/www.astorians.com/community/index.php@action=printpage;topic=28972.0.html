				I saw that Artichoke Basil Pizza opened so I decided to go in and check it out.&nbsp; The atmosphere is very warm and welcoming, but the thing I noticed as soon as I walked in was the smell.&nbsp; It didn&#039;t smell very good to me, probably from the artichokes.&nbsp; I am wondering if anyone else experienced this. I saw that the cheapest slice they have is $4.50.&nbsp; That&#039;s very overpriced to me.&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;ll check it out one day but I won&#039;t make it a regular place at that high price

				I walked by on Friday evening on my way to Mohave to meet friends for happy hour and was surprised at what I saw.&nbsp; Not only was every table full in Artichoke, but you could barely fit another person inside the space at all.&nbsp; Crowds waiting and by the counter.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if that kind of popularity will stick but it was pretty crazy.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking forward to trying it and I love artichokes and the related smell. :azn: PS - I love the new expanded bar at Mohave.&nbsp; We had a great time.&nbsp; Big improvement.

				Oh yeah, they&#039;re fattening as all hell.&nbsp; That&#039;s why I am really glad I don&#039;t live near Ditmars anymore.&nbsp; The other one is on Ave A, also no where near me.&nbsp; Once in a while treat definitely.&nbsp; But the grandma slice is probably healthier :)

				Great pizza have been to the one in the village and the one in astoria. Went last week(3/6) right after they opened. Space is great. Around 6:27 4, 4-top tables open plus&nbsp; a bar with around 6-8 seats. Long line but moved quickly. Only really had&nbsp; margaherita slices when we got up. No vodka grandma. Must be a hot slice of pizza<br /><br /><br />We ordered two artichoke slices. As always they are delicious. Like eating spinach dip on a pizza. Unbelievable <br /><br /><br /><br />Enjoy. MAke more vodka pizzAs please <br /><br /><br />Dan <br />#goforkyourself<br /><br />

				Finally had a chance to try this place. Got a few different kinds of pizza for the wife and I to split, and an order of the garlic breadsticks. Pizza-wise, got a margherita, a vodka sicilian, and an artichoke. I got not even halfway through the margherita and was stuffed -- so the artichoke will be for lunch tomorrow. The breadsticks were good -- simple, but good.<br /><br /><br />Would I get it again? Absolutely.<br /><br /><br />Price-wise, four slices and the garlic sticks came out to $26, which, for traditional pizza would be pricey, but these $4 slices are massive -- wide and super thick and filling. The breadsticks were WAY overpriced, though -- $10 for what is basically pizza dough with garlic on it and a tub of sauce on the side. When garlic knots at any pizza joint run 4 for $1 or $2, and garlic bread runs about $2-$3, $10 for the garlic breadsticks were overpriced, and though good, can&#039;t justify spending the money on them.<br /><br /><br />So other than the price (which really should be posted on the menu board), I have two main complaints, neither of which have to do with the quality of the food: 1) the wait for food. They ran out of some types of pizza, and rather than have a new pie ready to go, they repeatedly were telling people that whatever it was they were out of would take 20 minutes. The garlic breadsticks, I was told, would also take 20 minutes. Now I love knowing my food is fresh, but 20 minutes to wait for anything other than a whole pie at a pizza joint is ridiculous, and it took closer to 40 minutes than 20. Had I not already paid, I may not have been so willing to wait because of... 2) the music. It was loud. I mean, so loud you couldn&#039;t hear the guys behind the counter, and they couldn&#039;t hear you place your order unless you YELLED it out. I would never stay in to eat because there&#039;s no way to have a conversation with your dining companion. And during my 40 minute wait, I kind of wandered around the place, thinking I was underneath a speaker or something, but no, it was loud everywhere -- my ears were ringing by the time I left. Really unacceptable. (And it was some of the lamest music the 1990s had to offer, so not only was it loud, it was bad and loud.)<br /><br /><br />Not sure what their delivery looks like or what their delivery zone is, but if they head to my part of the neighborhood, I would definitely do that and avoid the music. <br /><br /><br />That area is really saturated with pizza joints, so I kind of wish they had opened up south of Astoria Blvd. instead where we have a bunch of burger places but little good pizza joints that sell single slices.&nbsp;

				We had leftovers from Artichoke that we tried heating up the following day -- they did not heat up well at all. Really gross, had to toss it. As I said, I liked the pizza, but unless we order only what we&#039;re going to eat right then, there&#039;s no point in spending the money.

				That&#039;s where I got confused too, seeing as I&#039;ve always viewed Artichoke as a fast food by the slice pizza joint, rather than a sit down brick oven pizza restaurant.&nbsp; But I&#039;ve only been to the one on Ave A and 14th Street - the place is the size of a closet and is most definitely take out.&nbsp; I enjoy it but it&#039;s only for fast meals, on the go.

				The original 14th Street location is so busy that they didn&#039;t have pizzas sitting long after they were made. We went to the new Astoria location last week, and my Margherita slice, reheated, just wasn&#039;t very good. Pretty dry, unimpressive sauce, cheese and flavorless basil leaf. It would probably be much better sooner after it came out of the oven. I liked the artichoke slice less than my hubby - a little too much for me.<br /><br /><br />It does feel like the chain that it really is now, I guess.

				I think the excitement will soon wear off and eventually it won&#039;t be too crowded anymore.&nbsp; If people don&#039;t like the pizza they won&#039;t go back.&nbsp; From all of these comments I dont&#039; want to waste my money there.

				I don&#039;t think the prices actually are too crazy for what you get.&nbsp; That said, for whatever reason, I just don&#039;t feel like the quality at this location is consistent with the 14th Street store (which is amazing).&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what it is, but it&#039;s not the same.&nbsp; Still, I do visit from time to time and it&#039;s nice to have a late night option to grab something on the go.&nbsp;
