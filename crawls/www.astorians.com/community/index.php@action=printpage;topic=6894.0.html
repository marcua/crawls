				Looking for a review of Zorba&#039;s on 23rd Ave and 29th Street.&nbsp; Good for a fairly cheap Greek dinner?&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks!

				My husband and I go there often for breakfast.&nbsp; We like sitting outside and take the dog with us.&nbsp; We are Greeks - this is certainly not the best Greek food in Astoria, but it is fine for a quick snack.

				Agreed, Zorbas isnt the best compared to some other restaurants in this neighborhood but its got a charm all of its own.&nbsp; I go there all the time and sit outside for dinner.&nbsp; Their salads, sandwiches, and gyros are great and the staff is really nice too.&nbsp; Highly recommended!

				I LOVE ZORBAS!!<br />Ive been eating there for five years. Next to Choo Choos, they have the best burgers in town. Excellent wraps, gyros, souvlaki, greek salads, and of course, breakfast.&nbsp; <br /><br />Opa!

				I know this is an old topic, but just wanted to say I tried Zorba&#039;s for the first time last evening for dinner. Been in Astoria for 2.5 years and finally went there, and it was so nice!<br /><br />We ate outside, had basic Greek meats/salad, and you can&#039;t beat the 3.50 house wine and imported beers!<br /><br />The service was good and the waitress was extremely friendly. She seemed to be buddies with all the regulars, so who knows, maybe I will become a regular myself!<br /><br />Great place for an inexpensive but nice date, or to go alone and have a nice meal outside. I definitely recommend Zorba&#039;s!

				I use to go to Zorba&#039;s all the time when I lived on 28th St. btw 23rd and 24th Aves.&nbsp; &nbsp;I rarely ate in but I often got their gyro for dinner and their egg sandwiches for breakfast.&nbsp; Nice folks.&nbsp; And I miss their gyros a lot.&nbsp; I can&#039;t seem to find ones I like as much over near the Broadway area.
