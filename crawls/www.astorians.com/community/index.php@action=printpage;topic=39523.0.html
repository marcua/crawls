				<br />I live on 21st Ave right near Steinway and have lived here for two years.&nbsp; This past week, for my first time ever, I saw a possum on two separate nights.&nbsp; One night it was on Steinway near 21st Ave and another night it was on 38th Street btwn Ditmars and 21st Ave. I&#039;ve never seen a possum so I think it&#039;s super cool that we have wild animals like this right in our midst.<br /><br />Then I went on Google and found this video of a mother possum with her babies, seen in Astoria.&nbsp; So amazing!!<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDpttJLocdE<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;ve seen a few possums over the last 3 or 4 years and I live on 30th Road between 29th &amp; Crescent Streets. I&#039;ve seen several in the 35th - 36th Avenue area as well. My gym is over there and I&#039;ve seen them running in/out of side allies and going in/out of trash cans. There&#039;s a house around the corner from me with driveway and I&#039;ve seen them scurrying in and out there as well. They tend not to go near people, at least the ones I&#039;ve seen. They usually run in the other direction.<br /><br /><br />But I agree, it is amazing seeing them here.

				We&#039;re on 32nd off 20th Rd and have one who hangs out in our backyard a lot - I&#039;m pretty sure it lives next door. It is completely unfazed by human presence, and goes about its business even 2-3 feet away from me. I&#039;ve seen it year-round, and in the winter watched it gather a huge pile of leaves with its prehensile tail, then carry them over a 6 foot fence, presumably to insulate its nest. I love it - I find it marvelous that we have a specimen of the only native North American marsupial living in our backyard!

				I&#039;m so glad to hear that others here have seen them all around Astoria and that you also think it pretty cool, for the most part.<br /><br />I had this fear that there might be some people who&#039;d view them as a &#039;nuisance&#039; or want to poison them or something...you know how some people can be.<br /><br />btw, when I said I saw them for my &#039;first time ever&#039;, that wasn&#039;t just referring to the two years I&#039;ve lived in this part of Astoria.&nbsp; I&#039;d never seen a possum before in my entire 53 years on the planet!&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; So when I first saw one the other night I was like &#039;what the...?&quot;&nbsp; I was mesmerized, waiting to see if it would reappear.&nbsp; But once it went into the person&#039;s front yard and got lost among the shrubs, I never saw it again that night..

				Keep in mind:&nbsp; the Opossum/Possum are harmless and rather be left alone and not confront us humans.&nbsp; They will NOT attack.&nbsp; If they happen to &quot;show&quot; teeth or hiss at you, it&#039;s only because they are FRIGHTENED.&nbsp; Same goes for playing &quot;dead&quot; hoping you&#039;ll leave it alone.&nbsp; Their lifespan is 1-2 years, sadly because of dogs,cats and us humans!!!<br /><br /><br />They&#039;ve been called, &quot;Natures Little Sanitation Engineers,&quot;&nbsp; their diets includes mice, crickets, bugs (they love snails) to name a few (oh yeah and any type of pet food left outdoors and overripe/rotting fruits).<br /><br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve had them pass by in my yard as well as raccoons (that&#039;s another story).&nbsp; Okay let me get back to work .....

				<br />It&#039;s funny cuz when I moved to NYC 15 years ago I never would have thought there&#039;d be any wild animals here.&nbsp; When I lived in Harlem, I had a ground floor apartment in like a &#039;rowhouse&#039;, and my kitchen door led out to a small cement patio with 8&#039; high cinderblock walls.&nbsp; I used to let my cats out there, knowing they couldn&#039;t ever escape or scale those walls.<br /><br />So one night I had the door open and assumed my cats were still out there (when in fact they were inside somewhere...) and as I peered out the door to call my cats in, I saw this huge set of eyes along the top of the patio wall.&nbsp; I thought &#039;wow, that&#039;s a huge cat!&#039; (there was a colony of feral cats in the other yards surrounding mine....)...then as I looked some more, I realized I was seeing black rings around the animals&#039; eyes, and it was THEN I realized &#039;omg, it&#039;s a RACCOON!!&quot;.&nbsp; My first time ever seeing a raccoon.<br /><br />I never would have thought that I&#039;d have to move from Boston to NYC to start seeing wildlife.&nbsp; lol

				Once you start looking, there&#039;s plenty of it....I&#039;ve seen woodpeckers, hawks, and lots of songbirds in my Astoria backyard. I&#039;ve seen pheasants (almost daily on Randall&#039;s Island when I commuted by bike) and wild turkeys (along the Henry Hudson Parkway). My husband even spotted a coyote in the Bronx Botanical Garden. I have so much respect for these critters that can coexist with us!

				litza ~ in short, they have no choice but to coexist with us.&nbsp; My famous words to live by &quot;Please let&#039;s be kind to our Planet Earth and all its habitats and creatures..&quot; I always try to remember to end all of my postings with that !<br /><br /><br />Speaking of our feathered/furry friends, while I haven&#039;t yet seen a hawk in my backyard.. i do have the common sparrows, grackles, bluejays, cardinals, doves, nuthatcher, etc.,&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />C&#039;iao ~

				Possums in Astoria. That&#039;s pretty cool. Some of the neighbors are startled to find them in their garbage cans, but they don&#039;t try to harm them (as far as I know). I&#039;ve told them to just tip the can over so the little marsupials can go on their way. Hopefully people will educate themselves about how unique and interesting they are, and be more accepting of their presence. If not-then put a lid on the garbage can, which is what I do anyway.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;I live by Astoria Park and lately I&#039;ve noticed we get daily brief visitations of green parrots (monk?) on my block-usually early morning and early evenings.

				Yes, I think I&#039;ve seen those green parrots as well ...over by me on 21st Ave and Steinway.<br /><br />I love birds and feed them on my balcony...know many of them just by their calls...and I remember one day hearing an uncommon call...then I was like &#039;I know that call...but it&#039;s not a typical one around here....&#039;...then I looked out for the birds and saw something bright green a few houses away on the roof!<br /><br />On my Astoria balcony, I have no problem getting blue jays.&nbsp; Boy are those little guys smart.&nbsp; All I have to do is open my squeaky balcony door (I swear they recognize the sound now...), I put out a few peanuts IN THE SHELL (their fave food) and within ten or so minutes, they swoop in, grab a peanut in the shell, fly to a nearby tree, hold the shell against a branch with their claws, and peck away to get the peanuts inside.<br /><br />I also get house finches and dark-eyed junco, but for some reason no other birds, not even cardinals or mourning dove, seem to know of my feeders on my balcony.&nbsp; (and btw, I do know the different foods they like...it worked when I had a yard...but not on my current balcony.&nbsp; Maybe certain birds are simply less likely to fly onto a building balcony?)<br /><br />When I lived in Glendale/Ridgewood in Queens, and had an entire yard with bird feeders, I got mockingbirds/catbirds (can never differentiate between the two), woodpecker, white-breasted nuthatch, cardinals, mourning dove and dark-eyed junco.<br /><br />When I lived in Harlem, I actually got Tufted Titmice, a really beautiful bird...but sadly, I haven&#039;t seen any Tufted Titmice in a good ten years or so.
