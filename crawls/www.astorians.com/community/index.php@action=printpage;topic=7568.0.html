				I just received the following message from a university listserv.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know anything about this organization but since I know we have a bunch of scientists and educators on the forum, I thought I&#039;d put this out there for anyone who&#039;s interested.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />My name is Tawanda W. Johnson, and I&#039;m a member of the Task Force on the Future of American Innovation, a lobbying group in Washington, D.C., which is sponsoring a video contest to inform Congress about the importance of funding scientific research. Please circulate information about the contest to your student groups. Top prize is $1,000 and trip to Washington, D.C. The deadline for submission is Sept. 10.<br />&nbsp;<br />Best,<br />&nbsp;<br />Tawanda<br />&nbsp;<br />This link takes you to the video that promotes the contest:<br />&nbsp;<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuGBNNCwkfs<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Here are the rules for the contest:<br />&nbsp;<br />Innovation Video Contest<br />&nbsp;<br />Create a Video Celebrating America&#039;s Innovation:<br />&nbsp;<br />The Task Force on the Future of American Innovation (http://www.futureofinnovation.org/) invites you to create a short video that presents an inspiring story about scientific innovation in America. The video should illustrate how scientific discoveries resulting from federally funded research in the physical sciences have changed our lives. The video can focus on past transformational research or showcase what the future might bring. Let your creativity flow-feel free to use music, humor, or other formats to help celebrate American innovation, now and for the future. <br />&nbsp;<br />For examples of breakthroughs from past transformational research, go to:<br />&nbsp;<br />http://www.sc.doe.gov/Accomplishments_Awards/Decades_Discovery/decades.htm<br />http://www.nsf.gov/about/history/nifty50/index.jsp<br />&nbsp;<br />Contest: <br />&nbsp;<br />The top five videos selected will be viewed in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. on Oct. 4, 2007, during a 50th anniversary commemoration of the launching of Sputnik by the Soviet Union and the ensuing American investments in research and education. Invitees to this special event will include members of Congress and their staff.&nbsp; The producer of the winning video will win an all-expense-paid trip to Washington, D.C. (for two people) from within the United States to attend the Capitol Hill event. This grand prize will include round trip travel expenses, one night hotel accommodations and a scholarship check for $1,000. The four runners-up will each receive a check for $300.<br />&nbsp;<br />Criteria for Judging Videos: <br />&nbsp;<br />. Creativity<br />. How well message is conveyed<br />. Level of entertainment<br />. Quality of the video<br />&nbsp;<br />Video Contest Rules:<br />&nbsp;<br />. Videos are to be no more than three minutes in length.<br />. All videos must be received by Monday, Sept. 10, 2007.<br />. Any submitted video may be used by the Task Force in its activities, including Capitol Hill presentations and posting video on the Internet.<br />&nbsp;<br />. The contest is limited to contestants residing within the United States.<br />. Each contestant may submit no more than two videos.<br />. Please submit your video via the YouTube Internet site at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuGBNNCwkfs<br />&nbsp;<br />.

Only the five finalists will be notified. The winning videos will be posted on the Task Force Web site on Oct. 5, 2007.<br />&nbsp;<br />Tawanda W.
