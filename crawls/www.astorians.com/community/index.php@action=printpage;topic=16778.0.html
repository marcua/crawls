				Yesterday morning, or the one before, I was standing by my window (24th Street at 36th Ave), looking at the wind blow the golden brown leaves around on the lawn when I saw a little dog, generally chihauhau shaped, the same color as the leaves, playing among the leaves.&nbsp; The wind was so strong I wondered if it would blow the little cat-sized dog over.&nbsp; I kept expecting someone to come and pick up the dog, but nobody did.&nbsp; The dog eventually ran out of the lawn area, sniffed a fire hydrent, ran under a parked suv, tried to cross the street, ran back to the hydrent.&nbsp; A man came by walking a similar shaped black dog, but it was clear the golden brown dog was not with them.&nbsp; It ran away down 36th Ave.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t feeling well and couldn&#039;t go out to investigate.&nbsp; Has anybody heard of dog in this are being lost?

				<em>I</em> have a-cold-or-the-flu-or-something.&nbsp; And I&#039;m not lost, I&#039;m right here.<br /><br />What bothers me is that this isn&#039;t the first time I&#039;ve encountered a dog under these type of circumstances.&nbsp; Elsewhere on this site I&#039;ve written about a white dog I first saw lose it&#039;s way in high white snow.&nbsp; That story didn&#039;t have a happy ending.&nbsp; I tried to find the owner, I tried to find a new owner, and eventually had to abandon the dog myself in high white snow.&nbsp; I&#039;m not happy when I see an unattended dog.

				Is this for real?<br /><br />You found a lost white dog in snow... and now a lost brown dog in brown leaves...<br /><br />Did both of these occur after finding some extra strength NyQuil in the green grass?&nbsp; :lol:<br /><br />Sounds like Alice has fallen down the rabbit hole again.<br /><br />Fun trip... but get some rest.&nbsp; :wink:

I hope this isn&#039;t the case. There are a lot of rescue groups in New York City and I&#039;m sure one would have taken the dog.

				Oh, you non believers.&nbsp; <br /><br />If I could have taken the dog anywhere I would have simply kept it.&nbsp; It was a perfect little doggy.
