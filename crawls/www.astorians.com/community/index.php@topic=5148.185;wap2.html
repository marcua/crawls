			Hey everybody!&nbsp; Glad to see this topic here.<br />I too try to remember to have my Baggu shopping bag with me at all times.&nbsp; Sometimes I might forget it&#039;s in my other tote bag, or it might be in my &#039;laundry&#039; pile.&nbsp; (I do try to wash it pretty regularly since food, i.e., fresh watermelon etc. can sometimes leek in my bag)..<br />But anyway, for those shopping trips where I DO need to take a plastic bag from the store, I save all of mine up and then bring them to Whole Foods, who accepts plastic bags for recycling.<br />Does anyone know of any places besides Butcher Bar on 30th Ave., that sell grass-fed, antibiotic-free meats?&nbsp; What about good quality fish?<br />I also agree that living in NYC automatically makes us greener than most...that is, assuming we use public transportation only.&nbsp; (I have to say I&#039;m shocked and disheartened at the number of NYers...generally in the outer boroughs but still close to public transportation, who have cars!)&nbsp; I make orders from Fresh Direct maybe 5 times per year, and for those orders I try to stock up especially on heavier, bulkier items like laundry detergent, paper products, etc.&nbsp; (And Fresh Direct carries many Seventh Generation items.)<br />For those of you who may happen to live in the vicinity of 21st Street and 30th Drive, there is a guy who runs Hellsgate Farms, and who invites people in the nabe to drop off compost at his house on 30th Drive.&nbsp; (I don&#039;t know the exact address...I just know the house by site, but if interested you can google Hellsgate Farms and ask him about composting.&nbsp; Right now I think just a handful of people who happen to know this guy drop stuff off, but I&#039;m sure he&#039;d appreciate others doing the same.&nbsp; You can also get info on where this guy offers his produce.&nbsp; I know last year he had an arrangement with Queens Kickshaw on Bway, where they offered some of his produce for sale.)&nbsp; I know that this guy, Rob, is also looking to facilitate more green homes in the area. )<br />Which brings me to a related question.... I myself am interested in purchasing a home in Astoria and couldn&#039;t afford a single family on my own....nor are there many single families to choose from.&nbsp; I&#039;d love to see if I could find one or two other people to maybe buy a 2-3 family home.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for like-minded people who&#039;d be interested in having a vegetable/fruit garden on the property, a rain barrel, maybe a chicken coop if we have the room, solar panels, composting, etc.&nbsp; There may or may not be some communal space in the building...a living type area perhaps with a small kitchen, but overall I&#039;d envision we&#039;d have our own &#039;apartments&#039;...and that the communal aspect would be mainly with regards to the external aspect of the home (green energy use, outdoor space, etc.).&nbsp; Naturally we&#039;d need to meet up, talk about our own personal goals, understand everybody&#039;s financial situations, our ideas of what kind of home we&#039;d want, and we&#039;d need to have our own lawyers to ensure our own needs are all met.&nbsp; <br />If anyone might be interested in just meeting up for starters, and seeing if we are on the same page, you can email me directly at yippee1999@yahoo.com.<br />Thanks!!<br />Lynn
