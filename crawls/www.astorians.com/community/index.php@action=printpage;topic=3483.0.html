				Rant...<br /><br />Not much to say here other than I hate scaffolding.&nbsp; Everytime it is removed from a building, it only seems to reappear on a bigger building!&nbsp; It&#39;s ugly.&nbsp; It impedes pedestrian traffic.&nbsp; It blocks out sun light. It seems like it lasts FOREVER.&nbsp; And I NEVER see actual work being done above it.<br /><br />What exactly are the rules governing scaffolding?&nbsp; Isn&#39;t there a time limit the city imposes on it?&nbsp; If not, there should be.

				Perhaps it would be better if a large piece of construction material or heavy tool were to hit you in the head.&nbsp; &nbsp; That&#39;s what they&#39;re there for.&nbsp; &nbsp;(actually I think it&#39;s more to avoid lawsuits in the event someone gets hit with a tiny chip of a brick... this country has gone sue-crazy)<br /><br />I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a scaffolders/riggers union that makes a ton of of them too.

				Speaking of scaffolding...<br /><br />What&#39;s with the new scaffolding up underneath the Amtrak bridge on 31st St between Ditmars and 23rd Ave??&nbsp; I just noticed it today as I walked under it, and thought - they can&#39;t be building right here because it&#39;s right under the bridge. What could it be?

				From what Ive gathered over the years the problem stems from a few issues.<br /><br />1. Very often scaffolding is left up after work is done because advertising makes the building money and scaffolding rentals are cheap.<br />2. Permits expire and no one is there to check / enforce it.<br />3. The amount of inspectors for site inspections has been slashed over the years.<br />4. And once again there is tons of money to be had from advertising, in the city at least.<br /><br />5. And I guess you could argue that the building owner spends money out of his/her pocket so that neighbors can get out of the rain and have place to park their bikes.&nbsp; That and Republicans are really benevolent caretakers of planet Earth.

				Jonathan hit the nail on the head.&nbsp; Department of Buildings, which handles the permits, does not have enough staff to enforce their own rules, so they stay up much longer than they could or should.

				Lots of the scaffolding is due to Local Law 11 which went into place after some folks were hit by flying bricks.&nbsp; Buildings are required to undergo inspections every few years.&nbsp; If the Inspectors find loose bricks, protection has to be provided and pointing has to be done on the building.
