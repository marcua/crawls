				I think you need to throw out the mattress and all sheets that were on it.&nbsp; I had an exterminator come to my place when I had a roach problem.&nbsp; He told me to be careful about bed bugs because they were starting to cause massive problems in the entire city.&nbsp; He basically said that if you have bed bugs, you need to trash all your beds and sheets asap.

				speaking from experience:<br />1)the landlord is responsible, it is a class D(i believe) health violation. if other tennants had them it is most definitely the landlord&#39;s problem-he should exterminate the whole building if it has now reached 2 apartments.<br />2)mess does not attract them, mess attracts roaches ants, the bugs that feed on filth. bed bugs are purely blood suckers. mess makes it easier for them to hide, but that is not the cause. they aren&#39;t interested in the twinkie wrapper under the bed, they only want blood.<br />3)there are many many things that need to be done prior to the exterminator doing anything.-also there is no &quot;over the counter&quot; remedy a professional is a MUST. you will just mask the problem. They can hibernate for a year or two without a blood meal.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; a)it is recommended, but not required that you throw out your mattress and box spring. they can be sprayed with a contact kill spray. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if it is thrown out, it MUST be wrapped in plastic, completely otherwise the suckers will jump off along the way. you can get plastic mattress covers from bed bath and beyond. if you keep the mattress it has to be covered in this before you use it again. essentially trapping what is in there and &quot;suffocating&quot; them with chemicals.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; b)sheets, towels, pillows, bedspreads, EVERY article of clothing or upholstery, basically any fabric MUST be washed in the hottest temperature possible. do it twice in a row for better effect. if you can&#39;t wash it, dry clean it. or throw it out. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; c)every thing you own, especially where the problem is concentrated has to be cleaned and boxed up.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; d) all wood products must be accessible to an exterminator, they love fabric and wood.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; e)everything must be pulled away from the wall so that the exterminator can spray the perimeter<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; f)all the floors, rugs and moldings need to be vacuumed.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; g) everything on the walls has to come down and be cleaned. if it is wood it has to be sprayed.<br />It is a pain in the ass, and you still aren&#39;t done.<br />Once the exterminator has sprayed everything you have to cover the matress with the plastic mattress cover. Then fill in any hole, gaps and cracks in the walls or along the baseboards.<br />You should have a follow up visit a week or two later. Also to be paid by the landlord.<br />Don&#39;t unpack anything. If anything, rewash everything again.<br />breathe and try to return to normal.<br /><br />If you are wondering if you have them here&#39;s what to look for:<br />any unexplained rashes or welts. I had welts from an allergic reaction to the bites...even a doctor discounted bed bugs. no allergy then it could just be small red bumps.<br />their poop(your blood) has a &quot;sickly sweet&quot; odor. it smells kind of musty and stuffy.<br />you see red marks(blood)on your sheets.<br />check the corners of your mattress, where it folds, that&#39;s where they hang out. also in your box spring. But i never really found them in my bed(hence i was able to salvage it) there were some in the box spring, but there was a nest(?) behind a tapestry on my wall. and anytime i saw them they were on the wall running up to the molding and the cracks. so after i had the exterminator i filled in as many cracks as i could reach.<br />I can&#39;t remember the name of the comapny my landlord got(which he only got after i called 311, then he tries to tell me he isn&#39;t responsible and that he&#39;s doing me a favor...he wouldn&#39;t have paid for it then, he was being a douche)it starts with an A and is in Brooklyn, in Bay ridge i believe. <br />Don&#39;t feel bad not going to their house, you shouldn&#39;t set foot in there until after they get some heavy duty chemical action. They can hop on and off anywhere. They are so small, when fed they are like an appleseed..and when hungry they are clear!!!<br />If you need more info, i have a wealth of it, and the scars on my arms, legs and back to prove it.<br />But we are all clear now.<br />Knock lots of wood!<br />~*Jenn

				the whole fiasco isn&#39;t my proudest moment, and i usually keep it under my hat...my friends and i refer to it as &quot;the incident.&quot; however, i will impart the knowledge where necessary. and it sounds bad, but at least i&#39;m not the only one. it&#39;s still like having cooties but lots of people are getting them.<br />even the hotel pennsylvania is infested (article somewhere on cnn).<br />and i keep seeing articles in the paper(am NY today)and online...so its getting epidmeic.<br />i&#39;ve learned and am always on the look out. it sucks.<br />but like i said...wher someone is in need of info, i shall impart.<br />i think now most people reading this thread are going to check their mattresses...actually it would be a good idea.<br /><br />Jenn

				This place on 23rd Ave is talked about a lot:<br />http://brooklyn.citysearch.com/review/36213353<br /><br />How big is the bedbug problem in Astoria??<br /><br />The reason this epidemic has spread so voraciously through NYC is because the DOHMH/311 is unwilling to tell you how widespread the problem really is. There&#39;s really nothing to be embarassed about on a personal level (see Jenn&#39;s posting about how it has nothing to do with superficial cleanliness). And on a public health level, no information is made available. I tried calling 311/DOHMH and they can&#39;t disclose whether my own slumlord currently has bedbug complaints lodged against him and if so, how many... its &quot;confidential&quot;. Confidential even if you report your own apartment! Don&#39;t I have the right to know if my own building, the shared spaces in which I dwell, is harboring a health violation? So everyone suffers in isolation, wondering if they got it from the person just beyond their wall or floorboard... this city is a nightmare.<br /><br />If you have a bedbug problem, I urge you to follow Jenn&#39;s example and be both candid and zealous about fighting them.<br /><br />best of luck!<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I have lived in 3 apartments in Astoria since I moved here 7 years ago and thankfully, *knock on wood* have seen no bed bugs, though my second apartment had a terrible roach problem and many of my things, including all my kitchen appliences had to be thrown out when we moved. This is why it is not wise however to pick out furniture from the curb even if it looks like it can still be used. You never know. This site is also a good site when it comes to bed bug info.<br /><br />http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/bedbugs/

				http://www.nyc.gov/html/hpd/html/pr/violation.shtml<br /><br />if you go to this website and scroll all the way down to &quot;enter HPD online&quot; you will be redirected to a site where you can input your address and see all open violations against your landlord. They stay there unless he has proven he/she has rectified the situation. Because when i called 311, they never told me they were coming i couldn&#39;t have an inspector check my room, the complaint was removed. Obviously if i am being eaten alive i wasn&#39;t going to live there. So rats, i couldn&#39;t get the bastard on record.<br /><br />It&#39;s a really nifty tool.<br /><br />Jenn

				So HPD only pertains to housing violations not inclusive of health violations...? I&#39;m not sure. Because I looked up my building (31-57 34 Street) and there are only some old listings from like 10 years ago and doesn&#39;t even include the recent complaint that I filed (and resolved) last year about building structural violations. Its a great tool, I agree, but it would be even better if they maintained it.<br /><br />What I&#39;m more irritated at is the general lack of public health information. Bloomberg&#39;s spending more money than any mayor of recent memory on public health measures and STILL something as ancient and preventable as bedbugs are plaguing this city as if it were the 17th century. <br /><br />I mean, who is 311 trying to protect? The slumlords?? Because not only should they tell about your own building, but I think there should be an online database for health-residential violations (kinda like how DOH keeps the searchable db of NYC restaurants and their inspection records). Because the data isn&#39;t even out there. I can look up how many cases of TB there were in NYC last year, but not how many (and where) bedbug cases there were! Does anyone ever wonder how/why there was this sudden SPIKE in bedbug cases about 18-24 months ago? <br /><br />If the data were out there, I&#39;d do a google mashup: that&#39;s most helpful to show how an epidemic (of any nature) spreads through city through casual contact. How else is a city expected to solve this problem?<br /><br />I guess this is an academic arguement.<br />Which makes sense since I&#39;m trained as a molecular microbiologist.<br />More data, dammit!<br />I&#39;m going to write a letter.<br />And send it to some bureaucratic office who won&#39;t read it.<br />

				This is somewhat related to another post I started about no rent protection for tenants.&nbsp; The republican run state government has made so many concessions to landlords, and stripped so many rights from tenants, it&#39;s really quite disturbing.&nbsp; This is just another example of protection of landlords at the expense of tenants who via rent, pay the landlords mortgages.

				I&#39;ve lived in Astoria for about 8 years.&nbsp; Last spring, I discovered I had bed bugs in my apartment.&nbsp; Firelight 79 is exactly right on all her accounts.&nbsp; Your landlord is responsible for taking care of extermination for the bed bugs - it is required by law, especially if your apartment is rent stabilized.&nbsp; I basically had to inform my landlord of this and threaten legal action.&nbsp; Turns out the entire building was infested with them (they just travel thru the walls to everyone&#39;s apartments), and the entire blg had to be exterminated.&nbsp; The exterminator has to come at least twice.&nbsp; It does not matter how clean, dirty, rich or poor you are, if you have blood, they will be there.&nbsp; They are extremely hard to get rid of.&nbsp; Vaccuum like crazy, and throw out the vaccuum bags.&nbsp; Throw out your mattress if possible.&nbsp; Wash everything in hot water.&nbsp; Keep everything that&#39;s been washed in plastic bags while your place is being exterminated (so more bugs don&#39;t get in them).&nbsp; You are not safe after the first extermination, but perhaps the second.&nbsp; In my case, I was getting bit for 2 months before I saw one walk across my desk.&nbsp; You tend not to notice the actual bugs until it&#39;s far too late, I just thought I had a mosquito problem or hives.&nbsp; It was the last straw and I decided not to resign my lease.&nbsp; After 3 exterminations, I put a bunch of stuff I could not wash into vaccuum sealed bags (they love books), and put them into storage for 4 months.&nbsp; Then I moved.&nbsp; From all the research I did, I learned the best thing you can do is move, especially if your neighbors have them - you&#39;ll probably just get them again, unless the whole blg is done, and your neighbors are as vigilant as you.&nbsp; In my case, I knew they wouldn&#39;t be.&nbsp; The exterminator said this is a huge problem in Astoria, he gets calls all the time, and it&#39;s due to the large amounts of immigrants here.&nbsp; But in general, it&#39;s a huge problem in nyc.&nbsp; These buggers are in general hitchhikers, and you can pick them up anywhere.&nbsp; It was a nightmare, but I&#39;m hopefully bug free now.&nbsp; Best of luck, and please don&#39;t worry about your mess.&nbsp; Just call the landlord- your body will be happy you did.<br />

				THANK YOU. This is exactly my point: Daisy, it seems to me that you had to suffer both physical and mental anguish because essentially your entire building had been having systemic problems and unfortunately you didn&#39;t find out about it until it was too late and you too were infested. <br /><br />I&#39;m glad you moved. Where in Astoria did you live? I hope its all working out well now, it sounded horrible. And I argue that what your landlord did (or not do, when it comes to fair disclosure) was at best negligent and at worst criminal. If you had been duly notified when he first started getting calls about bedbugs, I think you could have been more prepared, if anything. I know that its probably impossible to prevent at some point (like trying to row against a friggin tsunami, I imagine) but maybe neighbors would think twice before dumpster diving or furniture salvaging if they were aware of the threat...?<br /><br />It appears that we are made to pose as a sitting ducks as the infestation would move through our hallways and crawlspaces... no one is entitled to know about outstanding bedbug issues surrounding their own walls even if he/she were to call 311 and file an identical complaint. Apparently the landlord&#39;s rights to &quot;privacy&quot; on his property trump your right to live in a home free from public health hazards. Why don&#39;t we just go chew on our lead-paint crusted windowsills? Its not like the super&#39;s fixed the stuck window anyways...<br /><br />What the f@ck? This sucks.<br /><br />Sorry. I just watched the State of the Union propaganda fest and I&#39;m feeling frustrated.<br /><br />

				Sorry I didn&#39;t get to post back til late, can&#39;t do this at work...<br /><br />Yeah, the whole experience was physically and mentally exhausting.&nbsp; But in a weird ironic way, very cleansing.&nbsp; I threw out so much stuff, moved to an entirely new place.&nbsp; I would say the landlord was more negligent than criminal.&nbsp; I was probably a bit more forceful about the situation than the rest of the tenants, but with good reason.&nbsp; These bugs will make your life a living hell, and I don&#39;t understand how anyone can put up with it.&nbsp; Another resident and I actually walked around to all the other apartments, and made a list of everyone who had the problem - and lo and behold, the majority had seen them, and had done nothing about it.&nbsp; Their kids were being bit, and still they didn&#39;t say anything.&nbsp; But alot of people in the blg don&#39;t speak english, and don&#39;t know the laws, or that they don&#39;t have to live with getting bit all the time.&nbsp; I don&#39;t want to get into specifics, but it was on 38th and Ditmars.&nbsp; The guy owns a lot of blgs in queens and astoria, sort of like a donald trump, but more slumlordish.&nbsp; They did take care of the problem though, and I didn&#39;t pay for any of the treatments.&nbsp; Worked out better than I expected.&nbsp; But I did pay in mental and physical anguish, plus the cost of moving, getting a new bed, storage, laundering, etc.&nbsp; It&#39;s pure hell.&nbsp; It&#39;s been 6 months since I&#39;ve moved, and I am so much happier.&nbsp; It&#39;s like starting over, a brand new chapter in my life!&nbsp; <br />-Have a good one. -D

				Hi Daisy and fellow Astorians,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I had been getting bitten or something (I thought it was a rash as a result of a bad reaction from a migraine med I was started on), however after consulting with my neuro doctor and a couple of doctors I work with and also realizing that for some reason I was getting bitten and my partner was not, I put two and two together and realized it must of be happening on our couch and low and behold, that night I went home and found about five of them on the underside of my arm rest, which is where I put my legs when I fall asleep on the couch when watching T.V. at night. So we cleaned the couch and vacuumed and since then have only found one, however this past weekend we spoke with some people in the apartment building (one of which is the landlord, who ever so nonchalantly said &quot;oh yeah, I&#39;ve known about the problem&quot;), in which I proceeded to go nuts; asking why he did not tell the whole apartment building about this, to which of course there was no answer (BIG SURPRISE), anywho, it turns out the whole place has them (30 apts.) and according to the landlord they are going to be spraying 6 apts. at a time. I think we are lucky (if you can say that) because, we are very clean, we are a top, corner apartment and they have sprayed the apt. below us a couple of times already and the guy who lives there said he has not seen any lately. This article does however sum up how I have been feeling for a long time now, as at first I did not know what was going on with my body as I just kept getting new spots all over my body each day and no one really knew what it was from and when I found the bugs, it was in a sense a relief, until we found out that this problem was in the whole building and it has been going on for a while now. We are going to see &quot;what&quot; they do this Saturday and then, if need be we will and are prepared to take it to housing court to get back what we are going to lose from this whole situation. I never thought the old saying about &quot;sleep tight and don&#39;t let the bed bugs bite&quot; would ever come true, but it has and it has been a nightmare. We just love Astoria, however if this does not get resolved it looks like I will have to visit all of you guys from another part of Queens :cry: :cry: :cry:, which truly makes my sooo mad, but its not like we have not had other problems with this apartment building, but we have such a great deal, great spot and now we have these intruders taking over our lives as well, ugh, thanks for letting me vent! I hope to report back with positive news. Life changing and as I said before I would not wish this on the worse of presidents :roll:

				Thanks Daisy, we have read that thread like the bible and it has been very helpful, actually, my partner was reading it because I told him about the &quot;what to do when your neighbors are too loud during sex&quot; thread because it was sooo funny and he saw the BB thread and decided to read through it, not knowing we would actually need to use it for real :-o Anywho, we are going to wait and see what happens and hopefully I will report back when we either by a place or god knows what, thanks for your kind help though, -Vin

In spray form? Did you see quick results? As I said before, I think that we have the least problem out of anyone as we have only seen them on the couch, however it is what is behind the walls, under the floors, etc. that is on our minds. I am also not happy with the fact that they are going to come in and spray some god knows what solvent that will probably smell like a salon on a Saturday before Easter Sunday at the nursing home and I am one who cannot take fumes, esp. with my migraines. Ugh!! Very interesting about the earth though, thanks for that and we will look into this.&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				I used the DE in powder form. After a couple of months of having the exterminator come again and again and again, we finally did one big push and that seemed to make the big difference. <br /><br />This is what we did:<br /><br />-caulk the entire apartment<br />-wash everything hot water and dry with highest heat. <br />-anything that can&#39;t be washed was steamed or put into plastic bags to be stored for 18 months.<br />-vinyl covers on the mattresses and futon<br />-vacuum everything<br />-threw out everything suspicious that couldn&#39;t be adequately cleaned or stored long term. mark up anything thrown out &quot;BEDBUGS DO NOT TAKE&quot; to avoid spreading to other apts.<br />-used a spray for mattresses and furniture<br />- put DE around the edges of the room.<br />- put glue traps under each bed leg.<br /><br />I&#39;ve only had one bite since.

				oh my. i just went to a meeting about bedbugs and it scared the hell out of me. I think these people in the article are going a little overboard, or a lot overboard. but how scary. does make me wish we could bring back ddt for indoor use, even though i am an environmentalist. but the bedbug thing is TERRIFYING. I was supposed to write an article about them for a science magazine and I decided not to, simpy because I don&#39;t want to go crazy.

				Bedbugs....the final reason to move out! My husband and I just moved to Astoria in Sept. We love the area...so close to the city and reasonable rent. However, our apartment has been a disaster. Last week we discovered bedbugs!!! We still have not seen the little things but we have bit marks. After talking with our neighbor we were informed that the previous tenant moved out because of them and the whole 6 story building has them. I believe our only option is to move. We found a new place this weekend. Small / New 6 apartment building. Now I&#39;m paranoid we will bring them with us. Any advice???

				http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=2323.0<br /><br />Check out the &quot;Bugs in my apartment&quot; thread - other astorians have had the same problem. <br /><br />I would suggest:<br /><br />1) talking to the landlord and any neighbors before signing the lease to make sure there are no bedbugs in the new apartment.<br />2) wash and/or treat everything you can before your move and pack in clean plastic bags or plastic boxes (lots of advice on this in the other thread)<br />3) anything that can&#39;t be satisfactorily washed or treated prior to moving, put into storage for at least 12 months (sealed up good to avoid infecting other storage units)<br />4) have an exterminator treat the new apartment before you move in, along with your boxes if possible.<br /><br />

				You should report addresses with any current or past bed bug infestations on this site (there&#39;s a spot to note the year):<br /><br />http://bedbugregistry.com<br /><br />re: The Voice article:&nbsp; I actually know two of the people from the article and they were kind of misrepresented.&nbsp; The woman Diane who comes across as paranoid has good reason:&nbsp; she threw away a ton of stuff, put everything else in a pod storage, took nothing except maybe her purse, went to stay with a relative and then the relative&#39;s home became infested.&nbsp; It would make anyone a little paranoid, in my opinion.&nbsp; The Voice writer chose not to include that fact, which she was told, but perhaps readers might have thought the woman had reason to be worried.&nbsp; If one bed bug infestation is a nightmare, imagine moving and getting them again.&nbsp; It happens.<br /><br />(and read our Bedbugger blog:&nbsp; http://bedbugger.wordpress.com)<br /><br />nobugs!

				the cold works but if you have cracks in your floor they may just come back. <br />STERI FAB works like a charm.&nbsp; alcohol based spray that is safe for animals and humans. they sell it at the SQUARE HARDWARE On ditmars &amp; 37th st.&nbsp; he sells a case a WEEK so its just not you with this problem. <br /><br />until you can get that though, take 1/2 cup rubbing alcohol and mix it with 1/2 cu warm&nbsp; water....put in a spray bottle...and watch them DIE DIE DIE.... <br /><br />I JUST moved and thank goodness we got rid of them...most of my clothes are still in &quot;quarantine&quot; in garbage bags, but remember the bb&#39;s live mostly in FABRIC....so def. throw out your mattress and CURTAINS!&nbsp; You will probably want to throw your dressers and night stands away, too.&nbsp; its expensive but worth it. <br /><br />we caught the bbs right after they came in the apartment&nbsp; (thru a crack in teh bedroom floor) and basically sealed off the bedroom with duct tape.&nbsp; it was a long narrow apt and since they move very slowly, and&nbsp; if the infestation is recent, you still have a chance to catch them before they spread in your entire apt. <br /><br />Your landlord is fully responsible for any exterminations and related costs.&nbsp; this is the law.&nbsp; if your landlord doesnt comply you can file a complaint with DOH and they can be fined if they don&#39;t! <br /><br />Big hint: NEVER move into any apartment with wall-to-wall carpeting. Huge red-flag. <br /><br />Take ALL your clothes, sheets, etc. and wash them in hot water; but more important is about 60 minutes in a hot dryer.&nbsp; Then let them cool and fold them at the laundrymat - use those blue recycle bags to store the clothes in, that way you know they are &quot;safe&quot;...then tape the bags shut with duct tape, mark them, and put them in another room of the apt. its a massive pain in the butt, but trust me it gets rid of them.&nbsp; &nbsp;Whatever can&#39;t be washed has to be dry cleaned; but to save costs use those DRYEL bags - theyre pretty efficient.&nbsp; <br /><br />Deface any furniture you put on the street, the health dept said to paint BEDBUGS on it with red paint or big large x&#39;s. (Would you believe, though, that people STILL took my defaced furniture from the street despite it being clearly marked BEDBUGS?!)<br /><br />ANYWAY it sucks, I know, but let me know if you need moral support. I have to say it was the nastiest thing that ever happened to me, but we got through it alright.&nbsp;

				You can do a search for &quot;diatomaceous earth&quot; and find all the posts about it on the forum.<br /><br />I bought mine on amazon.com. Make sure you get the freshwater DE, NOT saltwater. And use a mask while you put it on if you use it as a powder. You can also mix it with water to make a paste. <br /><br />I didn&#39;t mix mine with anything else. What I did was this:<br /><br />Clean the apartment as much as possible. Sanitize *every* possible hiding place - this included electronics, books, clothes. etc. Books were vaccumed individually, by hand and the bookcase dusted with DE. Any electronics that might house them (all those little nooks and crannies) were either dusted with DE or sealed and put in the closet. Clothes were taken to the laundry and kept in plastic bags. Things that couldn&#39;t be laundered were either steamed or sealed in plastic and dated 18 months in the future (a bit paranoid of me but I had a good reason to be paranoid by then). Furniture was sprayed with bedbug spray - I used something else but given other recommendations I&#39;d use Sterifab if I had to do it again - god forbid. We had the landlord send someone in and caulk/seal and then I bought my own calking gun and went over it myself to find any missed spots - and they did miss spots. Then we put DE around the perimeters of each room and under the beds. We put two vinyl covers on the beds and futons, also put covers on the pillows. We put tape (sticky side out) around the bed legs, and vaseline. In addition, I put glue traps (the paper kind) under all the bed legs. So any bug that got to me would have had to brave DE, a glue trap, vaseline, and tape. The beds have to be moved away from the wall and the bed covering should be made up so that NOTHING touches the floor. <br /><br />All that said, if you can just get a good exterminator, you might save yourself some stress. In the thread mentioned before there are some recomendations from people who used exterminators who really fixed the problem. I would not recommend either of the ones that I used. <br /><br />DEFINITELY CAULK, no matter what!<br /><br />We had the exterminator come several times and continued to have problems. I finally discovered that a neighbor had had them. Building management refused to admit that this could have anything to do with our problem but when we treated the whole apartment, as above, it stopped.

				Are there other problems in your apartment building, or have you had problems in the past?

				No, I&#39;ve never had problems with the suckers- and when the exterminator came to spray the apartment (for roaches, etc) he mentioned that they hadn&#39;t had any complaints in my building.&nbsp; That being said, everyone I ask knows someone with them or has them.&nbsp; And my exterminator literally said- &quot;oh yes, you should be scared!&quot;&nbsp; he said that he went to some pest control seminar and some guy talked about how he saw a bedbug go from one guy to another guy in line at a hotdog cart .&nbsp; &nbsp; Which sounds unlikely, but freaks me out nonetheless.&nbsp;

				uzumaki: yup, greensense. good luck!<br /><br />besmircher: I think story about the bedbug going from one person to another sounds kind of far-fetched. For one thing they are nocturnal creatures and don&#39;t live on humans. They suck your blood around 4 in the morning, just before dawn, and go hide in the mattress. For another thing, they are quite small. Either the viewer in question had very good eyesight or he got close enough to the guys in question to make them a tad uncomfortable.<br /><br />I&#39;m not saying they can&#39;t spread person to person, but I think it would be more likely if someone had an infected mattress and stored their bookbag on the mattress, and then took the bookbag on the subway and put it next to another bookbag, or took it to a cafe and put it on a sofa, etc etc. <br /><br />If you are spending a lot of quality time hanging out with people you know have them, take precautions - strip and put your clothes in a plastic bag the second you get home and hop in the shower. But again, they are nocturnal. I think they are more likely to enter your home via used furniture, a mattress delivered in a truck that also hauls away old (potentially infected) mattresses, an overnight guest who brings in infected luggage, visiting an infected hotel and bringing home infected luggage, or having a neighbor with bedbugs. <br /><br />

				DE is not a spray or a chemical - it is a mechanical solution that actually cuts through the exoskeleton, causing the bedbug to dry out, and continues to work indefinitely after being applied.

				oh yeah--&nbsp; about the public schools:<br /><br />the public schools&#039; policy right now is that if they pull a bug off a person, they send it in to be identified, and only then do they consider that the school might have a potential problem.&nbsp; the teachers must catch, bag and mail in the bugs, or the city does not care.&nbsp; Any of you who&#039;ve had bed bugs would know that (a) they&#039;re hard to catch in the act, (b) you can be bitten for months and months by many bugs and never see one, even if they bite in broad daylight, and (c) even if a bug is on you, it is not <em>living on</em> you.&nbsp; In other words, the city seems to think that if teachers pull a bug off a kid, that it came to school with the kid.&nbsp; Not necessarily true!&nbsp; It could come out of the floor boards or from under a chair, just like it might do in your home.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard from someone from the teacher&#039;s union about this, and the teachers are upset.&nbsp; It&#039;s a ridiculous policy.&nbsp; According to the news articles, also, there&#039;s no set policy on notifying parents in general if a bug is found on one kid (like they would with lice).&nbsp; They will tell the kid&#039;s parents.&nbsp; Some schools are beginning to notify other parents, but it&#039;s not the district-wide or city-wide policy yet.&nbsp; You can see some of the articles on bed bugs in NYC schools linked from posts here: http://bedbugger.wordpress.com/tag/schools/ (http://bedbugger.wordpress.com/tag/schools/)

				A few months back, my daughter woke up with the &quot;three bites&quot;, after figuring out what it was (and after finally coming to terms that I had bed bugs, I fought hard to not accept it.), and scratching half my skin off... I practically tore my place apart looking for them. I found two. One was full of blood! ugh!<br /><br />I searched the internet, and found this company online that sells some great products to the &quot;regular&quot; consumer in NY. They worked great for me.<br /><br />http://www.domyownpestcontrol.com/bed-bugs-c-39.html<br /><br />I bought a sprayer, a bottle of Suspend, and Gentrol. I also found out that the purple can of Raid (for fleas) also works on them.<br /><br />I sprayed, then repeated after two weeks. Haven&#039;t had a problem since. I still do a light spray about every 6 months, just in case. Because all it takes is ONE neighbor to have a couple of bed bugs.

				I apologize in advance for the long winded post:<br /><br />It&#039;s funny how a day changes everything. I come home last night to my lease renewal to find that they rent has gone up a negligible amount and I can stay in my place. I&#039;m very excited and have a normal evening with my boyfriend and look over a notice the housing company left with our rent envelope about calling them immediately if we have bug issues. I think sure, I&#039;ll call, because we haven&#039;t been sprayed properly in a while and it&#039;s time. About time for bed, for some reason I turn over my back support pillow and find 5 bed bugs swarming. I immediately bag it and throw out the window and into the trash area. I&#039;m freaking out and not thinking clearly. <br /><br />We search around and find several more and throw out all our linens and vaccuum bag some things that had been close to the bed. I have a carpet next to my bed as well and am vaccuuming that tonight. I called my landlord company and they said they will have the exterminator call us to schedule an appointment and are sending me a list of guidelines &quot;that have to be followed by the letter.&quot; I&#039;m prepared to do what it takes and I&#039;m reading about the washing at hot temperatures, the sealents, the bug sprays, the plastic mattress covers. I&#039;m just freaking out because I LOVE MY APARTMENT. Do I have to move?? I don&#039;t want to and the management company has always been good to me. I&#039;m embarrassed, even though I know I shouldn&#039;t be, and I just feel...polluted. I don&#039;t want to move though, it&#039;s my home. Should I ask my neighbors if they are having problems as well??

				i&#039;d say that if your management company warned you about bug problems then someone probably has them and they are trying to fix it. However they should do the whole building and not just which apartments have the infestation as they will just move to a chemical free apartment.<br />do everything the instructions say. make sure they send the exterminator more than once. and be vigilent about vacuuming and keep checking your matress. wrap both matress and box spring in plastic. industrial grade from home depot if you can. line your walls by the rug/carpet with painters tape and lay double sided tape on it. do the same with your bed frame legs. this will trap em if they are coming from down below. keep nothing on your walls for a while and make sure to plug up all holes and cracks with expanding foam and caulk.<br />and read all our old tips from the bug threads.<br /><br />there&#039;s no harm in talking to your neighbors. if you don&#039;t want to start out telling them that you have them. just bring the notice you got and ask them if they&#039;ve had any problems. <br /><br />GOOD LUCK!!

				After reading this forum&#039;s other bedbug thread last week, my stomach hurt from thinking that moving to western Queens might mean moving to bedbug-central.&nbsp; It immediately triggered my catch-all anxiety management response - i.e. I ran to dr. google.&nbsp; I spent a large part of the weekend poring over the archives of http://bedbugger.com (http://bedbugger.com).&nbsp; It&#039;s this super-comprehensive blog about all things &quot;bedbug.&quot;&nbsp; Lots of resources and FAQs.&nbsp; <br /><br />Warning - the deluge of info was unsettling at first.&nbsp; But ultimately, all the good info proved comforting.&nbsp; Since the problem is worldwide, and people are suffering in far away places like Stockholm and Sydney, I figure I&#039;m vulnerable to bedbugs almost anywhere on the planet - not only in NYC.&nbsp; And most importantly, it seems the bedbugs can be defeated if you follow proper protocols.&nbsp; Just knowing that fact made me feel better.<br /><br />As for me - I used to spend days roaming second-hand furniture stores &amp; antique flea markets hunting for &quot;treasures.&quot;&nbsp; Yeah, those days are OVER.<br /><br />hardkore -- sorry to hear about your recent discovery.&nbsp; As for moving, it might not even be a 100%-guaranteed solution.&nbsp; There were anecdotes at the bedbugger blog from a couple of people who chose limited or no treatment and, instead, just moved away from their bedbug-infested apartment.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the bedbugs followed them to their new place.&nbsp; Or maybe it was a new batch at the new place.&nbsp; One woman abandoned all her possessions: walked away with the clothes on her back and not much else.&nbsp; And still, the suckers turned up at her new apt.&nbsp; That&#039;s soul-crushing stuff.&nbsp; Something to consider when deciding whether to fight or flee.&nbsp; In any case, best of luck to you.&nbsp; Hope your victory over these bugs is swift and total.&nbsp; <br /><br />aquaecny -- wow.&nbsp; What an ineffective response from the school.&nbsp; The bedbugs found on these kids might not have even originated from their homes.&nbsp; There might be colonies hanging out in the school itself.&nbsp; Bitten the kid after crawling from its hiding space in the school radiator (?)&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t the principal or whoever the decision-maker is care that one of these bugs might hitch a ride to her house?&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

				As an update:<br /><br />My management company sent me an email of points to follow prior to the exterminator visit. The exterminator also called prompty and we&#039;ve set up an appointment. He also gave me points to follow. Yesterday, I vaccuumed my bedroom for about 3 hours and sprayed rubbing alcohol on the mattress, along baseboards, used it to wipe out shoes, etc. Bagged all clothes which are going to be run through the dryer a couple times at high heat and then vaccuumed sealed in space bags and put in the bathtub. I haven&#039;t been bitten in 2 days and my other bites are fading. I set my alarm for 4am and set about the bedroom with a flashlight this morning and found none. I&#039;m going to vaccuum my bedroom/mattress/carpet everyday like this for a couple weeks and hopefully crisis will be averted. I do have hope and I do not want to move. I dont think I will need to *crosses fingers*

				Yes, I am at 191.&nbsp; As an update for my situation:<br /><br />Supposedly, my principal approved sending a letter home with the entire student body informing families of the problems we have been having.&nbsp; I still haven&#039;t seen an actual letter, so that is still to be determined.&nbsp; Also, there fumigation of about 7 rooms is going to happen today after school.&nbsp; Again, this is what I heard, but you know how easily news gets exaggerated the more it travels.&nbsp; Until I hear it from my principal (not other sources) and/or the custodial engineer and I see it happening, then I will believe it.

				It can be hard to tell if you have bedbugs, especially since they are so good at hiding, you can&#039;t feel them biting you, and it can often take more than a day for bites to appear.<br /><br />I &quot;inherited&quot; them when I moved in to my Astoria apartment last fall. My friend who had the room before me left her bedroom furniture. She had brought them back with her from Florida (she slept with her suitcase on the bed when she got back) . She had no idea they were there - thought they were mosquito bites.<br /><br />It took me a few weeks to figure out what they were (at which point I was COVERED in itchy red blotches), then about a month to get rid of them. I came very close to throwing everything out, but I did find this stuff, which works:<br /><br />http://www.bed-bug.net/bedbugproducts.html<br /><br />If you do have them, I would HIGHLY recommend this combo: the Bed Bug Patrol Spray to kill them immediately AND the Fossil Shell Dust to prevent them from coming back for up to a year. Both are all-natural (I think the first is made from plant oils, the second from crushed fossil shells) and non-toxic, which was important for me since I have two cats. I also didn&#039;t want to sleep in chemicals.<br /><br />If your bed has a wood frame, check there too - mine were on the underside of the frame. You will need to strip all bedding and either discard it or boil it. Then spray all other components of the bed with the Patrol Spray. Once that dries, apply the Fossil Dust to the bed and on the floor all around it. You may need to do this more than once.<br /><br />The Fossil Dust is a little messy - it looked like a coke fiend lived in my room for a few weeks when the ceiling fan kicked up the dust. And sadly this stuff isn&#039;t cheap - I think with shipping I paid around $75, but the site now says that they have free shipping, which must be new. But it&#039;s cheaper than an exterminator OR getting new furniture, which can get its own infestation if they are in other places as well.<br /><br />I sincerely hope you don&#039;t have them, but I know Astoria has a high rate of bedbugs. If you do some googling, you&#039;ll find tons of pages on identifying them and saving your stuff.<br /><br />Good Luck!

				I just reported these bastards at my apartment this week, the landlord had several units sprayed etc. Someone was infested with them and never bothered to report them which I do not understand! I had to go out and buy a vacuum etc, and waste a weekend (and quarters) washing and drying all my fabric belongings. <br /><br />I just hope the infested unit(s) take care of their belongings properly so that they do not continue. Is there anything the landlord can do to to ensure they comply with the washing etc? Or any other advice? I am just fed up and feel like I will have these bugs forever!

				I completely sympathize. I felt that way and was at my wits end before I got rid of them. You start forgetting there was a time when you didn&#039;t have bed bugs. <br /><br />Again, I&#039;d highly recommend these products:<br /><br />Get rid of bed bugs (http://www.bed-bug.net/bedbugproducts.html)<br /><br />Even if your neighboors don&#039;t follow the exterminator&#039;s adivce, the fossil dust will keep them out if you dust around your doorway. But definitely treat with both - the BedBug Patrol and the Fossil Dust - thoroughly. You will probably have to spend a day making sure you get everything. But they will die and not come back.<br />&nbsp;<br />It is worth every penny.

				I dont&#039; think it&#039;s necessary to throw everything out. Fabrics can be salvaged through washing and drying. Some items can be sprayed down with sterifab or another contact-kill spray. You can also wrap things in plastic and put them away - I dated everything to be opened 18 months from the storage date and put two layers of plastic around them and taped up everything so that NOTHING could get in or out. <br /><br />Some things you may have to throw out, but if the problem is that your neighbor has them, or they are living in your walls, you only increase your costs and do not solve the problem. I threw a lot of things out just because I was so frustrated and paranoid. I later regreted it. Some things really did have to go - how was I going to sterilize my clock radio? - but I threw out a gorgeous quilt that I&#039;m still bummed about losing. I wish I had just wrapped it in plastic for a few months.<br /><br />I cannot recommend caulking highly enough. Once I caulked, sprayed, and put DE along all the baseboards (and glue traps under the legs of every bed) and we sterilzed or stored everything in the apartment, the problems stopped. I keep an eye on the caulking - it developed cracks during the winter, and I had to recaulk. A small price to pay.

				Fellow Astorians &amp; Guests,<br /><br />Sorry for the long post, but I have to write this.&nbsp; If you are looking at an apartment on 48th Street between Broadway and Northern Boulevard, make sure you ask the landlord if they have an exterminator for bed bugs and do not, I repeat, do not rent on this block, if they try to tell you that they don&#039;t need one because there is no problem!&nbsp; The rents are considerably lower on this block for a reason!&nbsp; Every day, more beds, furniture and clothes are being put on the sidewalk because they are infested with these little buggers.&nbsp; My neighbor, who never seems to leave the block, and I are telling people to wrap anything that they are going to throw in plastic, but they aren&#039;t listening.<br /><br />This morning, there were two different extermination companies at two different apartments and I saw a group of residents from one building standing outside, while the exterminators were in their apartments.<br /><br />The problem with this block are several 1. residents aren&#039;t helping each other by not properly disposing of infested items 2. some of the landlords are not doing what is required 3. some residents don&#039;t do anything 4. the buildings are connected and, I believe, the bugs are travelling from house to house.&nbsp; I could be wrong, though.<br /><br />Again, if you are looking at an apartment on this block, please, please ask, if they have an exterminator!&nbsp; Oh, and another point, the same exact thing occured on this block last summer, but the problems that I outlined above, made it so only half of the block was properly treated and they quickly returned!&nbsp; So, I guess if you can stay away from this block, it might be best&nbsp; :|

				Be very careful, because you may just bring them with you when you move.&nbsp; I would do everything possible to get your landlord to get a REAL exterminator in there, for 3 visits for BED BUGS, not roach treatments.&nbsp; He is REQUIRED to do so by law.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t get the place properly treated, you stand the high risk of bringing them with you when you move.&nbsp; There is a lot in this thread about prevention, please do as much as you can for your own piece of mind.&nbsp; It is really hellish to live with and you shouldn&#039;t have to.

I&#039;m just wondering if others agree that if I put my sealed up pillows or clothing inside the freezer for 24 hours that it will kill any bed bugs inside.&nbsp; I guess I&#039;m asking partly out of curiosity because it makes sense to me.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />One website says it works, but it takes weeks. Another site says it takes a few hours. When I had bedbugs I didn&#039;t try the freezing thing, just the boiling thing and threw out half my furniture. <br /><br />It took me more than 6 months to completely get rid of them because the poison the exterminators use (at least this was the case last year, when I had them) doesn&#039;t kill the eggs, only the hatched bugs and adults, so he had to come back and spray every single week to kill all the new hatchlings and get them before they bred. What a nightmare!<br /><br />I found a product online, can&#039;t remember the name of it, but it comes in a white bottle that looks like bleach (it&#039;s a powder) and is EXTREMELY toxic to humans and animals. I have 3 cats and was afraid to use it. But I lined the baseboards in an area the cats couldn&#039;t get to, and I really feel it was much more effective than the liquid spray the exterminator used. And his spray got over EVERYTHING. He assured me it wasn&#039;t toxic, but come on. How could it not be?? Nothing kills those rotten bugs.<br /><br />Another site I visited said they used boric acid, thyme and tea tree oil and it seemed to work. Other people agreed thyme was affective for them as well, seemed to repel the bugs.<br /><br />Monica

				Here&#039;s a stupid bed bug question- do they jump, or just crawl?<br />I know fleas jump, and I&#039;ve read nothing about Bedbugs jumping, just crawling. I saw a bug last night, that jumped away (We did catch it and kill it) and now I&#039;m all freaked out. Probably because of this thread.&nbsp; :wink: I thought I&#039;d just ask before I worked myself up into a tizzy.<br /><br />Thanks!<br />Marisa<br />

				we had a huge bedbug infestation and beat them! it took a long time, but it was worth it.&nbsp; the best advice i can give is lots of sticking things in the dryer at high heat, doing laundry almost every day, storing all clothes and things in plastic bags until the infestation dies down, vacuuming every single day - floors, bed, couches, etc. - and covering mattresses with a plastic cover. oh, and exterminators. we also used a heavy duty bug killer from the hardware store called &quot;intruder&quot;...not sure if it works, but sometimes it just feels good to bathe your home in chemicals.&nbsp; even then, it took a while for them to be completely gone. you should always consider it good news if the problem is getting better, not worse - it can take time, but this way you know the treatment is working. good luck everyone!

				I had a bad case of bedbugs about 3 years ago (some of you may know my story, which entailed moving, throwing everything away, paying $500 in extermination fees and too much paranoia) and have been extremely panicky about them ever since. I&#039;ve just moved into a new place, just paid my 2nd month of rent, and woke up 3 days ago with 3 bites on my calf on my right leg. I know they&#039;re the bites, they&#039;re in close proximity, they&#039;re bright red and they itch.&nbsp; it makes me sad that i may have to go through this again. I just bought the spray and the powder that somebody recommended earlier in the thread and i guess i&#039;ll have everything laundered. <br />I guess i&#039;d just wished that i would never have to go through this again - luckily this time i know the signs and i was able to catch it before everything i owned was completely infested and destroyed.&nbsp; :cry:<br />

				I have treated many bed bugs in our area. The reason why I tell clients to wrap the mattress in plastic is so bed bugs won&#039;t spread while they toss the mattress and/or after the mattress is treated. <br />Threw the years I noticed that even though you wrap them, rip them up, label them as bed bug infestation someone or someone with a van comes a long and picks them up and sells them for 5 dollars. In turn the companies re wrap them with new material and sell them for top dollar.<br />&nbsp;I do hope the city gets involve to pick up infested mattresses, but I highly doubt it.<br />Don&#039;t forget when your dealing with bed bugs its not only the mattress you have to&nbsp; be worried about its everything in the room or rooms.

				Hi- I&#039;m quite familiar with bed bugs and they are AWFUL! Some advice- tell your landlord because chances are another unit in your building has them or will get them- they tend to travel upwards and through walls.

				Bites show up differently on different people, but as a rule, they generally come in threes (known grotesquely as the breakfast, lunch, and dinner combo, since bedbugs attach themselves, feed for a few minutes, and then move to another spot). Generally they are very red and if you&#039;re very allergic to their anticoagulant (which is what they inject you with) you&#039;ll see red welts that itch like ten thousand mosquito bites put together. The itching is unbearable and often keeps you up at night and makes your life a living hell.<br /><br />It is infuriating how there is not much public awareness about bedbugs in NYC. The wimpy couple of webpages on NYC.gov don&#039;t cut it. Bedbugs should be considered more than a &quot;pest&quot; or a &quot;nuisance&quot;. Ask anyone who&#039;s had them and they&#039;ll tell you it affects your ability to work, sleep, function and certainly affects your mental health. I am a survivor but I still consider myself &quot;on the watch&quot; and every time I see a discarded mattress with black dots on it in Astoria I wanna puke. Also, when I see signs (like in a Bangladeshi supermarket on 36th ave that say &quot;we have spray for bedbugs&quot;) I want to run in the store and inform the owner that there is NO such thing as a simple &quot;spray&quot; to kill bedbugs --- they are not like fleas or ants... you cannot just spray chemicals on them. It takes a multi-lateral approach, you must leave residual spray, bag up your entire life and wash everything you own, take switchplates off, books, etc etc. <br /><br /><br />I URGE you to visit bedbugger.com as soon as possible, check out the FAQ&#039;s for identifying bedbugs and post on the forum if you wish. There is a lot of misinformation out there, as well as people who are underinformed and who deny or downplay the problem. If you are someone who severely reacts to BB bites (a lot of times in a couple or roommate situation they&#039;ll be one person who does and the other person who doesn&#039;t even react to the bites) then this can be absolutely horrifying. Seek help asap!

				I just moved in to--and quickly moved out of--a guy&#039;s apartment who had bedbugs in the Ditmars area. <br /><br />It was a tramautizing experience. I woke up one morning with a bite on my bicep, figured it was just a mosquito that flew in over night. Then a couple days later, I wake up and have 6 bites on one arm, 4 on the other, and one on my foot (!). <br /><br />They look like mosquito bites, only they&#039;re a bit bigger and take longer to go away. If you wake up and have a line of bedbugs on any part of you, it&#039;s most likely bed bugs. Other giveaways: there will be drops of blood on the sheets and sometimes they leave casts of their body on the bed. So if you see pieces of bug, including tentacles or scales, that&#039;s it.<br /><br />My advice is to move out immediately of a place if this happens. Wash everything you own. Throw anything on the bed out--not worth it. And report it immediately, as they spread.<br /><br />Also, if you&#039;re renting out a room, BUY A NEW MATTRESS. Don&#039;t use one that&#039;s already there.<br /><br />So. disgusting.

				Sorry this happened to you astorianita and thanks for sharing it. There is much ado about how the bedbug problem in NYC is over-exaggerated and nothing more than hysteria, but posts like yours remind us of how prevalent these bugs are. <br /><br />Please report this address to the BedBug Registry (google it, it&#039;s a very helpful resource where you can ANONYMOUSLY report incidences of bedbugs so that people can find out before they move somewhere if there are bedbugs). <br /><br />Also, I hope you took precautions not to bring them to your new residence. <br /><br />I would add to your post that buying a new mattress can be difficult-- many scumbag mattress sellers refurbish old ones and resell and are not required to tell people; also, some companies that advertise &quot;we haul away your old mattress&quot; do not take precautions to ensure that the fresh new mattresses they deliver are not being contaminated contemporously with the old ones they are hauling away. <br /><br />Ick.

				I will certainly report it to the Registry. Thanks for the heads up.<br /><br />There are chances that new mattresses might be contaminated, yes, but the odds are slim. A lot less than just using a bed that&#039;s been sitting there for god knows how long and has been occupied by god knows who.

				First of all, I&#039;d like to commend this forum for what it&#039;s worth. I wish I would have found out sooner seeing as I am an avid LIC/Astoria citizen. And although I&#039;ve done my share of wrongdoing as a teen growing up, I really am fond of the neighborhood and the betterment of it. I was born and raised here my entire life and this Bedbug thing is a FIRST for me. <br /><br />I share an apartment with my family on 34th Avenue and 41st Street and I am not afraid to cue everyone in on this problem. This has been plaguing my building for the past 2/3 months now. (Well my apartment and the one above us that is.) It&#039;s extremely frustrating and the problem still hasn&#039;t been resolved. I have since thrown away my old bed, desks, and book case seeing as how when I sprayed bedbug pesticides on it, they kept crawling out of the crevices deep within the wood. Disgusting experience.....Not to mention when I was sleeping I saw one crawl right beside my eyelid. Picture it on a 100X zoom. NASTY!!!! I couldn&#039;t sleep anywhere for the next 3 days.... <br /><br />I&#039;ve adjusted to brass beds and tables, and shelfs now....but the problem still ceases to EXIST! I can&#039;t get rid of these things. Should I inform my landlord about this problem, he&#039;s a bit of a bum and I HATE asking him for anything really....I&#039;m not looking to cop an attitude with him again. I refuse to move out neither. I lived here for over 20 years....<br /><br />I would love to have my place exterminated but where would I stay and how long would it take? It&#039;s very puzzling...especially in this day and age where we are strapped to every cent we earn. <br /><br />I&#039;m seriously contemplating about putting up flyers about this problem. I can&#039;t take it anymore. Bumps are scorn across my body and I&#039;m paranoid everywhere I go, I feel life they&#039;re crawling on my body...the hair on my arms just rise....it&#039;s like I can feel them but they&#039;re not there. <br /><br />What do I do about this dilemma? <br />

				Please get help now. There is really no such thing as commercially available bed bug pesticide. Yes, you can get rubbing alcohol, steri fab and kleen free, but those kill bedbugs on contact and the problem is that bb&#039;s hide in the most remote places and are extremely, extremely hard to get rid of. <br />You need professional help- contact your landlord NOW (landlords are required to pay for treatment) and put up flyers everywhere in your building. <br /><br />The reason why these bugs spread is due to human ignorance and refusal to confront the problem. Unfortunately since they don&#039;t spread disease(**) they are only considered a &quot;nuisance&quot; and public awareness and laws are not up to the challenge of ridding NYC of them. <br /><br />(**) of course I wouldn&#039;t WANT them to spread disease; I say unfortunately because unlike cockroaches (which can contribute to asthma in children, and spread disease, as well as rats, which can bite etc), bedbugs are just considered pests and are not a high priority for NYC. Little do they know bedbugs cause psychological damage and severe itching, making you WISH you were being eating alive by mosquitos instead. <br /><br />Go to bedbugger.com and read the FAQ&#039;s. This thread is helpful but bedbugger.com is the most up to date, comprehensive resource out there.&nbsp;

				How long would it take though? I have no place to stay and I can&#039;t afford to stay in a Hotel/Motel for 3 days....<br /><br />And the problem lies in the fact that I live in a 3 floor apartment building with 1 family residing in each apartment (6/7 apartments.) <br /><br />So, if they just exterminate my apartment...will it really do anything seeing as how these things come from the building itself. Or would they have to exterminate the entire building and evacuate everyone. I don&#039;t want to hassle my neighbors and be at fault and gain a reputation for &quot;being dirty.&quot; <br /><br />Damn....I&#039;m stuck. I&#039;ve lived here for 20 years and NEVER had this problem. I guess I took it for granted....

				Scribbles, I&#039;m not 100% sure because I&#039;m not a lawyer and haven&#039;t gone through bedbugs exactly, but your landlord is responsible for exterminating all affected apartments and for supplying you with a place to live. I&#039;ve gone through a termites scenario and I deducted the cost of motel and exterminator straight out of my next month&#039;s rent. I&#039;m pretty sure you don&#039;t need your bum of a landlord&#039;s permission to do so even though life would be easier with his good graces. <br /><br />Only your landlord can help. After that, 311. After that, deduct deduct deduct and if he tries to evict you, you have proof of his negligence. With 20 years under your belt, I think you have some clout.

				You don&#039;t have to evacuate but yes, you do need to exterminate the whole building, apartment by apartment. &nbsp;They could easily have come from someone else&#039;s apartment, and it really has nothing to do with how clean or dirty you are. &nbsp;You have blood, that&#039;s all they want. &nbsp;Your landlord is required to pay for and to exterminate for bed bugs - and make sure it&#039;s for bed bugs and not just a roach extermination. &nbsp;Each apartment has to be visited at least twice. &nbsp;Wash and Dry your stuff, then put all your clothes and other washables in plastic bags throughout the extermination process so they&#039;re not contaminated. &nbsp;If you ignore the problem, it only gets worse. &nbsp;I had the unfortunate experience of having neighbors who did exactly that, and the whole blg became infested. &nbsp;Needless to say, I was fed up with the blg due to that and other things, and just ended up moving out. &nbsp;But AFTER I got the landlord to exterminate the whole building. &nbsp;The precautions I took to avoid bringing them with me were numerous and exhausting. &nbsp;Neighbors I confronted knew about the problem and had just chosen to live with it, like it was no big deal... &nbsp;Read this thread, there&#039;s lots of good info in it.

				I saw a chair last week in the trash area behind my building that was covered in plastic with a sign that said &quot;do not use, bedbugs!!!&quot;&nbsp; There was only a chair, no mattress or other furniture, and my building has never had any bug problems - so I assumed it was just an idiot who found a chair on the street and took it home only to find that it had bedbugs.&nbsp; In any case, I wrote a note to my landlord and included it with my rent check (good timing, right?) asking him to look into it, and low and behold, they tore up the old floor in whichever apt that was and have been working to exterminate before it spreads to other apts.&nbsp; I love my landlords!!!! :) And they love this building.&nbsp; So, we&#039;ll see, but hopefully I won&#039;t have to deal with bedbugs too!

				Okay, I&#039;m freaking out about bedbugs, and apparently rightfully so.&nbsp; I&#039;ve pretty much read every single word of this thread and any link that appears herein, so I guess I&#039;m prepared for the worst, but at best, I&#039;m so completely paranoid now that I feel crawly things on me.&nbsp; Not very healthy.&nbsp; <br />So here&#039;s my situation:<br />About two months or so ago I got a call from my landlord explaining that there was a case of bedbugs in the building.&nbsp; He had gotten the exterminator into the apartment that was infested, and from what I understand, everything has been bedbug free since.&nbsp; Being absurdly paranoid about bugs anyway, I have been keeping an eye out for the little bastards even before I heard that there was a case in our building.&nbsp; To this day I have yet to see a live bedbug, or the signs of live bedbugs (the bloodstains, the smell, etc) in our apartment...HOWEVER...<br />This past weekend, we were doing our &quot;6 month super deep clean&quot; where by we pretty much pull everything away from everything, vacuum the couch, chairs, mattress, box spring, deep clean all the chiffarobes, chapeau stands, hot wash all the comforters, etc.&nbsp; So while we were doing this, we spotted a small, whitish, dead bug on the box spring.&nbsp; This causes my brain to short circuit and start freaking out, however, before I could put it on a piece of tape and compare it to the online photos of these hellspawn my girlfriend crushed it with a tissue and threw it down the toilet. <br />On top of this, for the last month or so, I have had a good number of bug bites, but considering that I had taken a trip through the south, which included an outdoor evening meal in Savannah where there were a ton of mosquitoes, a night at a race track on the Potomac River, and plenty more outdoor stuff where there have certainly been mosquitoes and other bitey bugs.&nbsp; <br />Since we&#039;re going away this weekend, I was planning on putting some glue traps in various parts of the apartment, to see what I catch, and should there be bedbugs, give the landlord a call, schedule an exterminator and all that jazz. <br />The biggest question that I have is that I, in no way, shape or form, want to be forced to throw away my furniture.&nbsp; My bedroom set is far from cheap, disposable IKEA stuff, and we can&#039;t afford a new couch right now.&nbsp; We had already planned to get a new mattress this winter, so if push comes to bedbug shove, we can move that date up.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;m just freaking out and needed a place to share my worries.&nbsp; If anyone has any tips on killing bedbugs without ruining / having to throw out furniture, please let a brother know.

				KidMurdock, I don&#039;t see any reason to toss all your stuff or to move just yet. It sounds like all the bites you have had could have easily been mosquitoes - unless there was a week that you didn&#039;t really spend much time outside but still found yourself having bites? One unidentified bug on a box spring does not an infestation make. <br /><br />I think the glue traps are a good idea. If you want to take an extra measure of caution, I would do the following: <br />- thoroughly caulk the apartment<br />- put mattress covers on your bed. you can get them at bed, bath and beyond, and they should zip up around your mattress and box spring (one for each). if your apartment does become infested, the mattress and box spring will be safe.<br />- ask to have your apartment inspected for bedbugs<br />- take notice of whether you get any bites when haven&#039;t been hanging out in any place where you could get mosquito bites.<br /><br />Another test you can do is to change your bedding and put the used sheets in a plastic bag. Let it sit for a few days, then open it up and take quick sniff before the enclosed air disappates. If it&#039;s a sickenly sweet, yeasty smell, you may have bedbugs. BUT BE WARNED - this is not a foolproof test! When you are good and paranoid you will smell it everwhere. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think it is necessary to get rid of all your furniture. It&#039;s tempting, when you have no idea where they are hiding and you are panicking, to just toss everything. But I don&#039;t think you need to do that. <br /><br />At this point, you just need to find out whether you have bedbugs, and avoid getting them if you don&#039;t already have them. <br />

				&nbsp;Bedbugs are spreading like wildfire for one reason: ignorance. People are scared to admit they have them because there is a stigma of being dirty and disgusting associated with pests. Bedbugs are different. Who gets them? People with blood and CO2.. which is all of us. <br /><br />I saw a mattress against a pole on my street- at least the people wrote &quot;BEDBUG&quot; on it, but it wasn&#039;t wrapped in plastic. <br /><br />To those of you who think your itchy, red welts are just mosquitos: call an exterminator to inspect. I say this because I am living proof that one can have a bedbug infestation for MONTHS and not know it. I got bites for MONTHS and was convinced it was mosquitos (I even saw mosquitos, and heard them buzzing at night). Get an exterminator immediately. The longer you wait, the more eggs a single female can lay and end up infesting your place, or worse, you can spread them to another family. <br />I agree with Enigmacat on everything, that is excellent advice.

				For your information Under the Radar, I have a BB decontamination center set up in my foyre. This is where i de-robe, place my outerwear into assigned compartments, remove my wrappings, and continue to comb my body with a lice comb that i gave left over from third grade. Also, my date(s) (preference to remain unknown) have been very appreciative of my concern and ingenuity.<br /><br />Let us reflect. It takes a village to erraticate a demon. Join me fellow conservators of cleanliness. Unite and we will overcome! I&#039;ve seen others wearing the plastic bags. Once I was sitting in Broadway Bakery and i saw a piece of black plastic edging out of the back of a young woman&#039;s pants. No need to be conspicuous. I gave her the old slow nod and wink of approval. She did not acknowledge me, but I knew she knew that I was on her side. Tally ho BB warriors!

				Look, I know bedbugs suck and everything, but I think people are freaking out about them just a bit too much. The problem, as I see it, is that they were a non-issue for so long that no one really knows anything about them and so you get this borderline hysteria.

				I got bedbugs here about 2 years ago. It sucked. I washed everything in hot water and tossed a lot out. Rental insurance does not cover anything. Your landlord MUST cover the cost of having the exterminator come 3 times (minimum).<br /><br />It&#039;s a bummer when you get them, beat it as soon as you see the little creatures. Get an bed-bug plastic encasing for your bed (you can get one at bed bath beyond) and there are some sprays that will help prevent them to spread.<br /><br />Good luck!

				I read somewhere that they cannot live and breed in foam mattresses, because they are not porous enough for the bugs to get into. There are no hollow parts for them to live and breed. The article went on to say that they could still get into your bedroom, and crawl up the legs of your bed and bite you, but they would have to live elsewhere and breed elsewhere, like in your walls or something. So having a foam mattress doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t get bed bugs, but it means its a lot harder for you to get a total infestation as far as your actual bed is concerned. <br /><br />As soon as hubby and I got married last year, we used gift money to buy us a foam mattress. We haven&#039;t had any problems, but to be fair, neither has anybody else in our building. So the whole foam mattress thing might not even be the ideal solution, but it does give me some peace of mind. And boy oh boy is it COMFY!&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				As a survivor of bedbugs, NYC will never take the bedbug problem seriously until there is a financial incentive to do so, and until bedbug infestations are categorized as public health issue rather than a &quot;nuisance&quot; or &quot;problem.&quot; Unfortunately they don&#039;t spread disease, (no one wants them too... but if they did they would be taken more seriously) and their reproductive and feeding habits are severely understudied and misunderstood. The resource you mentioned is an excellent one, and it needs to get out particularly in neighborhoods where people don&#039;t speak English or who are more fluent in another language. (I recall hearing two ladies at the laundromat discuss how washing a load with bleach gets rid of &quot;los chinces&quot;... and I shuddered, because this is just soooo wrong!)<br /><br /><br />May I suggest looking up Lou Sorkin, a well-known forensic entomologist who has done some major work on bedbugs.

				I don&#039;t know that people don&#039;t want to do anything about it: I think it is a lot harder to motivate people when there is such stigma attached to bedbugs. Also, it&#039;s very difficult to reach immigrant and insular groups regarding bedbug control. People with a lot of children, many adults living in two-bedroom apartments with their families- have other concerns and would just throw things out and buy new beds instead of really attack the problem. I would like nothing more than for NYC to take the problem seriously, but seeing as you can&#039;t even get people to stop tossing trash on the ground... who knows.

				dear chris,<br /><br />well, at least one person is responding with some thoughts.<br /><br />the policy advocay group new york vs bed bugs has been<br />pushing for an official comprehensive policy like the ones<br />other cities have.<br /><br />aside from sending letters to peter vallone to show support<br />for immediate action, we are also tossing around the idea<br />of having a reliable stable of, say, 100 people who could<br />be counted on to send email notes blasts to appropriate<br />parties, such as dept of heath and dept of house when<br />we need to make a push, show support, at key moments.<br />&nbsp;(could even use a pre-prepared letter so there is not too much time and effort <br />required)<br /><br />i see the issues you brought up - that is one of glaring hideous problems<br />in my building - a large-ish family across the hall, immigrants, they<br />didn&#039;t address their problem for years!!!! and then that was AFTER<br />all the other apartments got them. (they dealt with their roaches<br />the same way - no dealing with them and told the landlord they didn&#039;t<br />want to be sprayed because it was against their religion to kill bugs.<br />yes. that is what they have said repeatedly.)<br /><br />still, there are plenty of american born single healthy astorians<br />that could easily play a tiny part in making astoria better. and<br />there is no interest or activity.<br /><br />as far as i&#039;m concerned, astoria seems to suck for me now after<br />12 years.&nbsp; can&#039;t move into another building because i know of<br />dozens personally that have/had bed bugs and know i will just<br />move into similiar scenerio. <br /><br />also, not joining in such a tiny way to action insures that<br />the problem continues into the far far future.&nbsp; meanwhile,<br />as astorians sit on the couches in cafes, sit in<br />the subway stuffed next to people and their belongs<br />(will be worse once the w line is cut), sit in the movie<br />theatres, taxis, restuarants, keep their stuff in lockers<br />at gym ALL THIS WITH THE REST OF INFESTED ASTORIANS,<br />etc. they should know FOR CERTAIN that bed bugs are<br />famous travelers and that is how we all have them in<br />the first place.<br /><br /><br />

				actually, canvasing door to door would not be to do<br />a count of who has bed bugs.&nbsp; it would be primarily<br />to get a petition signed in support of a city task<br />force/policy/strategy (the kind that other major <br />cities have and nyc does not.)&nbsp; no one, even<br />here, would have to disclose their bed bug <br />status, just that something needs to done<br />as the situation is out of control.&nbsp; the bugs<br />pose particular hardships: financial, material,<br />emotional and social.<br /><br />so thank you for the offer to go to door.<br />if you like, we could start with if you agreeable<br />to send a letter to the councilman peter vallone.<br />if you use the newyorkvsbedbug.org site,<br />there is a citizenspeak function that even has<br />a sample letter.....<br /><br />thanks,<br />best, sgw<br /><br />

				I had an amazing exterminator when I lived at the Acropolis on Ditmars and 35th (they are always having bed bug issues). He is liscensed and very thorough. <br /><br />Dont be afraid of visiting your friend. It&#039;s such a hard thing to deal with alone but be persistent that they must be very clean from now on and cork up all the holes in their apt to prevent the bugs from coming in from the neighbors. Another thing they can do on a continuous basis is to take their clothes to the dryer and dry on HIGH several times (cheaper than dry cleaner) and from then on keep the clothes in Zip lock bags. This kills the bug eggs and prevents them from spreading. <br /><br />Hope that is helpful...here is the exterminator info:<br />Gary <br />917 662 4812<br /><br />They usually charge approximately $400 a room I belive? But I could be wrong, my landlord paid for us because it was a building wide problem. <br />Good luck!

(Silly!)<br /><br />And if the thought of safety in your favorite theater or in neighborhood-X-that-is-not-Astoria crossed your mind… sorry!<br /><br />The interesting question is, should we wear leather outfits?<br /><br />There are no known repellents that work to my knowledge.<br /><br />Bringing any kind of contact-killing spray to the theater is likely going to get you interrogated in a tiny room and, more important, if you actually see bed bugs around your seat, I don’t imagine you are going to stick around to try to kill them?<br /><br />Tactile inspections are not likely to work either—there is so much dirt and debris on seats, in their seams and undersides and around them for this to be of much help. Plus, most of us are not skilled at bed bug inspection.<br /><br />So, in a movie theater, we may get bed bug bites. If we’re lucky, we’ll get them before the third act. That way the bed bug, satiated and no longer attracted to us, in fact slightly repelled, will amble off to its hiding spot and leave us alone well before it’s time to gather our coats from under that pile in the next seat.<br /><br />It gets complicated if there are lots of bed bugs. If, in fact, the bed bug population in your favorite movie seat is ready for new adventures. Or just clumsy. In that case, all bets are off.<br /><br />So, perhaps you need to select washable attire for movie-going and isolate your clothing (and shoes) upon returning home. Into a hot wash and dry as soon as possible and problem solved. Don’t bring a backpack or handbag or shopping bags and you’re set.<br /><br />Of course, your friends and family, those innocents who have not yet had bed bugs at home, are unlikely to take such precautions. And your downstairs neighbors? Your teenage kids?<br /><br />What do you think, we may as well go to the movies? Some of us won’t be able to stay away no matter what unhappy bed bug experiences we’ve already had. We may get bites. We may get bed bugs. C’est la guerre.<br /><br />We could, of course, call these our fellow New York citizens and ask them to create a plan to control bed bug infestations in our city. Just saying. We can be poor in these uncertain times, but do we have to have bed bugs, too?<br /><br />For more information, check out www.newyorkvsbedbugs.com&nbsp; Take action!

				Yea the experience was disturbing and there was no mistaking that it came from the seat and not my clothes (which were brand new, and being the freak that I am a thoroughly inspect every thread of my clothes for them, even drawers and socks. Anyway here&#039;s the specific details from my experience.&nbsp; <br /><br />I like to slouch in movie theater seats so the back of my head is always pressed up on the seat firmly. At first it first started with a little scratching, I didn&#039;t think of it too much. Then it hit me when I kept scratching it for the next 5 minutes. I start shaking off my body like something is on me until I had enough and turned around. <br /><br />I went through my frantic routine of searching for them. I knew it was a BB bite right away. So I start looking around the corners of the seats, edges and all. Blindspots are bedbugs great hideouts.<br /><br />Then there it was behind me crawling down and towards the back of the seat. <br /><br />BTW if you think any other theater is safer than UA Kaufman, you&#039;re dead wrong. <br /><br />Most folks wouldn&#039;t have even seen this bug but since I&#039;ve had a trained eye for them since last spring. I&#039;ve become a wiz at spotting them or sensing them before they bite. I get goosebumps and the hairs on my body start to rise. That&#039;s my first clue.<br /><br />Really, everyone needs to beware anywhere and everywhere you sit. Theaters, Coffee Shops, even your friends and relatives homes. <br /><br />It almost feels like it&#039;s impossible to avoid them. I spot a few in my apartment from time to time. <br /><br />BUT SWITCHING FROM A WODDEN BED TO BRASS WAS GENIUS FOR ME. So far I&#039;ve only had two or three over the course of the past 3-5 months. <br /><br />Exterminators suck a**. What a waste of money!!!<br /><br /><br /><br />

				BUT it is not much of a stretch or even false to say<br />they could be living at your local theater.&nbsp; they<br />are fantastic hitchhikers and travel in clothes, purses,<br />backpacker, etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />it just takes one.<br /><br />considering the level of infestation in astoria, i would<br />think they are nearly everywhere.

				Ok you don&#039;t have to believe me. I&#039;m just telling you what happened. <br /><br />I&#039;m almost certain that it wasn&#039;t from me. Like I said, I thoroughly check and examine all my clothes before I wear them to go outside. If you ever had BB, you can understand that it becomes a symptom and it almost seems like you check between every thread to see if they&#039;re hiding somewhere. <br /><br />Also, I&#039;m very sensitive when it comes to BB. It almost strikes a 6th sense in me and I can feel them within the premises or nearby. I can&#039;t really explain it. <br /><br />Third, let&#039;s just say it did come from me...still doesn&#039;t change my insider sources. <br /><br /><strong>Regardless</strong> I encourage everyone to go out to the movies. I&#039;m not stopping any of you from NOT going. Just bring some pesticide repellents with you LOL. <br /><br />

				Yay!

				Does anyone want some Steri-Fab and Drione powder (over-the-counter pesticides) for free? I successfully used them to get rid of bedbugs four years ago and was holding on to them in case the bugs came back, but don&#039;t have the space for them anymore. I have about half a gallon of Steri-Fab and a third of a gallon of Drione powder.

				I had this scenario play out recently and used an exterminator as well as over the counter products.&nbsp; I think what finally won the war after months of battles, was throwing a lot of s___ away.&nbsp; If you keep raw or finished wood, or fabric upholstered furniture, the bugs will likely find a place to hide in them and once you think its over... here they come!&nbsp; I&#039;ve been free of them for about 6 - 8 months now, so we&#039;ll see.&nbsp; <br />

				Did anybody read this article today on Gothamist? ugh.<br /><br />Mutant NYC Bed Bugs Impervious to Toxic Attack<br />A new report in the Journal of Medical Entomology has confirmed our worst fears: Big Apple bed bugs have developed nerve cell mutations that make them almost impervious to pyrethroid toxins, such as deltamethrin, commonly used against them. Toxicologists at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Korea&#039;s Seoul National University have conducted extensive tests on the resilient bastards, and it appears that New York City bed bugs are now as much as 264 times more resistant to deltamethrin than easier to kill bugs in Florida. Of course, Florida is where bed bugs retire to suck blood in their old age, so it figures they&#039;d have a higher mortality rate there. But up here, they&#039;ve totally gone rogue, and the Times editorial board is calling for &quot;a task force to figure out how to stay ahead of an army that seems to be growing every year.&quot;<br /><br />http://gothamist.com/2009/01/14/mutant_nyc_bed_bugs_impervious_to_p.php

				I was the victim of bed bugs at the last apartment I had before I moved to Astoria.&nbsp; It was located on the lower east side and the landlord was a real jerk-off who was not willing to help us with this problem.&nbsp; Bed bugs must be properly exterminated for if you even want a chance of them not coming back.&nbsp; That being said, I have a good friend whose entire building was sprayed for - they even drilled into the walls of his apartment and sprayed for them - and the bed bugs still came back.<br /><br />Said friend as well as a friend&#039;s husband who is a building super gave me some tough love advice that proved to be the best thing I could&#039;ve heard - find a new place to live while you still have some amount of sanity to spare!&nbsp; Even after only having to deal with the bed bugs and the uncooperative landlord for 2 months I am still completely neurotic about having to live through such a horrific living experience again.&nbsp; This despite having thrown out the following before moving: my bed, two wardrobes, one dresser, one chair, one couch, one entertainment center, one coffee table, 2 large rubbermaid storage containers full of clothes, a TV, etc.<br /><br />Please consider moving if it is an option and leave behind what you can.&nbsp; They will travel with you and can hide anywhere - even in electrical sockets.&nbsp; Take every precaution possible including freezing, storing disinfected clothes and bedding in giant ziplock bags, etc.&nbsp; List your apartment on the bed bug registry.&nbsp; There are also good online support groups to help with the really challenging emotions that come with your living space being so invaded.<br /><br />Bed bugs suck!

				I moved a few months ago and woke up this morning with quite a few bites on my arms. It&#039;s not my mattress that&#039;s the problem because I lived somewhere for 8 months beforehand and had no problems. So I&#039;m thinking someone in the building might have them and they may have crawled through the walls somehow.<br /><br />Does anyone live in this building and if so, have you had any problems?<br /><br />Separately, what can I do if they&#039;re not coming from my apartment?

				NO NO NO STOP with the Rid-ex. That is usless and you will just cause yourself more problems. Call a professional exterminator and visit this website : bedbugger.com and read the forums and read the FAQ&#039;s. There are loads of information on how to treat bedbugs and how to protect and isolate your bed. <br /><br />Bug bombs will just force some of the bugs into other peoples&#039; apartments. <br /><br />Sorry to say but you probably do have them, and it is likely that your building has had an infestation. Astoria is one of NYC&#039;s bed-buggiest neighborhoods, for various reasons. I sympathize with you. :(<br />

				Yea I had a problem last Spring/Summer. <br /><br />They seemed to have left during the winter weather (only spotty cases.) I am noticing that these little creatures are starting to pop up again with the warm weather. They&#039;re getting more microscopic than ever as well. I had to find one of them using my cellphone backlight. It was thinner than a hair.&nbsp; <br /><br />Luckily I&#039;m more composed and not freakish about it like last year. I know how to handle the situation. Its still frustating though. <br /><br />And my landlord is a cheapskate. Last year, the exterminator came to my APT and on the 1st day told me that the black marking beside my bed was due to the bugs then the day he comes back to do his work - the story changes opposite. Im guessing the landlord chose the inexpensive basic route. Which did absolutely nothing. <br /><br />The guy came lifted furniture sprayed toxins beneath then vacuumed. <br /><br />I swear though, Bed bugs will keep you up in the middle night. 1000X worse than having a baby wake you up in the middle of the night.

				Got it, no rid-ex.<br /><br />Scribbles, are you in this building? Is your super Emanuel? He hasn&#039;t seemed cheap to me. Exterminators are coming once now and then back again in another two weeks to catch the next round of hatching. <br /><br />My entire life is in hermetically sealed bags. It&#039;s more than a little depressing. <br /><br />It worries me that they came back to your apartment though it sounds like they did kind of a half-assed job with exterminating. I think you get what you pay for.<br /><br />I am crossing my fingers that they&#039;ll be gone for good after this, though my hopes are low on that front. The mattress encasing will at least hopefully keep me from getting chomped on while I sleep, even if they are still around.

				Scribbles (and all)<br />the rise of bed bugs (where&#039;s your source on this?) has nothing to do with warm weather. I had bedbugs in the dead of winter. They are notoriously difficult to kill with heat or with cold.<br />In order to kill bed bugs and their eggs with cold, you must place infected items in a subzero freezer (-29 degrees at least) for several days. <br /><br />If bed bugs seem to be on the rise, it has more to do with international travel, more people vacationing and visiting friends, and ignorance, not because of the spring.

				Be careful about laundry. If you do it in building laundry room, that could be it. Same for laundromat.&nbsp; &nbsp; I read that drying clothes completely helps kill them.<br /><br />Another source of bugs is discarded furniture. If you see a chair, dresser, or whatever that someone through out, be aware it could have them. They can be inside the wood.

				Does anyone know if you can get bedbugs simply walking down the street? Like can they jump from the sidewalk on to your shoes then travel home with you? If thats the case then forget it Im never getting out of my house haha jk I guess it&#039;s like getting hit by a stray bullet.Wrong place at the wrong time.A freak thing.<br /><br />How about sitting at a subway car? risky?? or better to just stand up and not sit at all?? All those homeless people that sit that has to give you a better chance of getting them on you.<br /><br />Lastly why is this happening now?? It can&#039;t be just because of travelers.People have been travelling for decades and this hasn&#039;t become such a big issue till now.

				Turn your nervous energy into something positive.&nbsp; First, research all you can on them.&nbsp; I&#039;ve survived them in the past (in an old apartment), and sometimes a preventative treatment is a good thing to have to give you peace of mind, even if you haven&#039;t been bitten.<br /><br />Also, to ALL NY&#039;ERS: Protect your mattress and box spring.&nbsp; There is a wonderful product called Protect A Bed mattress covers.&nbsp; We should all be using them.<br /><br />To the poster: &quot;Can you get bedbugs walking down the street?&quot;&nbsp; I would say that&#039;s very unlikely.&nbsp; They mostly come out at night, when you&#039;re sleeping and the reason they are drawn to humans by the carbon dioxide we exhale.&nbsp; That&#039;s why after a treatment, your exterminator will probably tell you to continue sleeping in your bed as &#039;bait&#039; for the bugs.&nbsp; They will come towards you, and come in contact with the insecticide and die.&nbsp; <br /><br />Bedbugs are a challenge, but if your building management has a good plan of attack, and you are willing to participate in the program, you should be fine.<br /><br />Don&#039;t stress, but if you need a drink and need to chill, let me know and I&#039;ll meet ya at Crescent Lounge for a beer or two.&nbsp; We&#039;re all in this together.&nbsp; It&#039;s just part of living in NYC.<br /><br />There aren&#039;t many bedbugs in suburbia, but if I lived there I&#039;d slit my wrists...<br /><br />Hugs and Hershey Kisses,<br />Candy

				One of my tenants had bedbugs and we covered the exterminator the first time.. the only thing was that the exterminator suggested that the old box spring, mattress be thrown out... just because the exterminator sprays there does not mean they will be gone forever.. another tenant brought them from a hotel where she was on business... its a vicious circle...

				For anyone who ever sees a house centipede in their apartment, before you kill it or become consumed by disgust, keep this in mind: not only do they eat roaches and silverfish, but they also eat bed bugs. I&#039;m pretty sure there&#039;s a family of house centipedes living in my building because I&#039;ve seen little ones. They used to really creep me out because they are creepy as hell, but then I figured I&#039;d rather have a family of creepy, super-fast insectivores living in my apartment than pretty much anything they&#039;re interested in eating, so I no longer kill them or sic the cat on them if I see one.

				I didn&#039;t get through all 17 pages of this thread but just in case no one else mentioned it- I remember seeing an ad on TV for bed bug extermination that uses a hound dog to sniff them out, and then they use a freezing agent to kill the bugs. It&#039;s a greener and non toxic way to exterminate them and according to articles, it really works!&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				I hope I&#039;m just being paranoid, but as of about five days ago, I am starting to suspect I might have brought bed bugs into my house somehow. All this time I thought I was safe because I live in a fully detached private house.<br /><br />The reason I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s bed bugs is because my bites don&#039;t seem to look like the pictures of bb bites I&#039;ve seen pictures of. My bites are tiny, about the size of a pin head. They itch like crazy - although for only a few minutes once or twice a day. Then, for the rest of the day, they don&#039;t bother me but for the fact that I&#039;ve got tiny but visible bumps on my skin. Still, unlike mosquito bites, these bites seem to be lasting a helluva long time. At first, I thought that one of my three cats brought fleas in from out in the back yard. But none of my cats are scratching, so I don&#039;t suppose that&#039;s it. It seems to be something that much prefers humans over felines.<br /><br />This past weekend, I stripped my bed down and washed everything in hot water, and dried it all bone-dry in my dryer at the highest temperature setting. I took my mattress and box-spring off the bed as well, and vacuumed the hell out of everything. As I did all this, I carefully inspected everything for the tell-tale signs of bed bugs, but saw nothing at all. And, just to be sure, I dusted boric acid all over my bed frame and box-spring before putting an entirely different set of sheets and blanket on my bed. So far so good. I don&#039;t seem to have had any more bites during the night since then.<br /><br /><strong>BUT</strong>... now I&#039;m starting to wonder if whatever is biting me is something lurking around at my job. These past few days, after my getting-ready-for-work shower in the morning, I&#039;ve been giving myself a good all-over inspection - making a mental note of where my bites are and how many. But when I got home from work today, I notice I have a few new bites on my ankles that were not there this morning. So can it be there are bed-bugs or something else that have been attacking me at my job? If this is so, then I guess it&#039;s a given that whatever it is is probably hitch-hiking home with me.<br /><br />I guess what I&#039;d like to know is if anyone else here has had a similar experience. And, if so, did it turn out you had bed bugs or something else? And what did you do to solve the problem? All Ideas and suggestions are welcome because right now every few minutes I&#039;m thinking I feel something on me, but when I look, can see absolutely nothing.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I have found bites to be a completely unreliable way of figuring out if you have bedbugs. I discovered them two months ago and only did so because I saw a spot of blood on my sheets. Neither I, nor my boyfriend, nor my roommate ever had any bites. We were just not reacting to them.<br /><br />So no, I would not freak out if you have bites. It could be a lot of things. The best thing you could do would be to contact your landlord (if you rent) or call in an exterminator (if you own) to have an inspection done. They know what evidence they&#039;re looking for, and you don&#039;t. Same thing goes for work.<br /><br />Oh, and it&#039;s too late now, but NEVER wash anything, move the mattress, etc. unless an exterminator has told you to. If you do have bedbugs it is very possible that you just drove them away from your bed into a harder-to-locate hiding place.<br /><br />Bedbugs are hard to detect and even harder to get rid of. Don&#039;t wait.<br />

				Hello everyone.&nbsp; i had bedbugs&nbsp; 2x about 5 yrs ago &amp; i was freaking out &amp; didnt get much sleep..they bit my ears &amp; both ears were intensly itchy &amp; bright red &amp; of course arms legs .. all but privates lol...bedbugs are hard to get rid of but&nbsp; you can get rid of them...! when our bldg had them, an exterminator come here a couple times {that was when they used chemicals &amp; it didnt help&nbsp; me get rid of them. now they can freeze them put by using some sort of freezing spray on them... &amp; dogs are being used to detect them... but do you know what helped me eventually get rid of them?.. it is a LICE SPRAY that you can buy at Riteaid for about $ 6 it is called &quot;Lice&nbsp; Bed Spray&quot; &amp; it is the store brand . the good things is that you can spray it on clothes &amp; blankets whatever... i&nbsp; have been bedbug free for 5 yrs now .. i know the nightmare you are all going thru, but trust me ... you can get rid of them.. &amp; also of course i had to do a lot of hot water washing which cost me lots of $$&nbsp; &amp; i bought many cans of the spray ... but when u have these t little bastards .. you will pay anything you have to get rid of them! when they bite you&nbsp; each bite&nbsp; usually forms a line of 3 marks.. i used to keep a flashlight on my pillow&nbsp; so whe n i woke i could check.. &amp; sure enuf i spotted them...if they have allready bitten you&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; taken your blood,&nbsp; you will see what appears to be tiny red dots walking&nbsp; on the pillow or or sheet &amp; when u touch them they break&nbsp; open &amp; hence the blood comes out of which&nbsp; they have gotten from you... the ones that havent bitten you will appear anywhere from cream color , brown &amp;&nbsp; &nbsp;to brownish red .. depending on the age of them...just keep spraying the bedframe ..pillows&nbsp; around the bed ..anywhere... read the can first tho, you may not be comfortable spraying it everywhere .... what kills lice also kills bedbugs .. so this is why it works. hope this helps&nbsp; you all ..<br />&nbsp;LadyA

				I&#039;ve had bed bugs before in the summer of 2008 and it <strong><span class="bbc_u">wasn&#039;t fun</span></strong>. Eventually we ended up having to call Freedom Pest Control (www.expelpest.com) and paid alot of money to have them exterminated. We had to move most of the clutter out of the rooms sealed into black garbage bags so they could start the extermination. On the first meeting they steam cleaned, vacuumed, and poisoned all the cracks, bedding and crevices. They came back twice more to poison everything. They really know what they&#039;re doing and make sure to do a thorough job.<br /><br />However, all the stuff we put in the garbage bags we had to wait for a hot day (95F or hotter) and put them out on the back porch so all the bed bugs got roasted inside :P.<br /><br />After having bed bugs before, I&#039;d say the best protection is to encase every mattress and box spring in your home, so that if you do get bed bugs they can&#039;t hide inside your bed.<br /><br />If you&#039;d like a cheap (and inexpensive way) to deal with bed bugs, remember their biggest weakness... <strong>They have to crawl to bite you</strong>! If you make everyplace where the bed touches the floor slippery (by putting the legs in a glass cup for example), they won&#039;t be able to get to you if your mattress is encased. You can also try using Diatomaceous Earth as well. (http://www.bedbugsguide.com/diatomaceous-soil.htm)

				I&#039;m happy to report that since my last post to this thread back in November, there were some easy and inexpensive steps I took that got rid of my bed bugs. And since it&#039;s been months since then, during which I&#039;ve had no more bites, it would appear the results I&#039;ve gotten with my anti-bed bug measures are permanent.<br /><br />First of all, I did some research online, and found out a very effective bed bug killer can be made with silicon crystal cat litter. Here&#039;s a short video that gives instructions for using it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJj_kArOc8&amp;NR=1 (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJj_kArOc8&amp;NR=1) I took it a step further buy making a 50/50 mixture of the ground silicon cat litter and boric acid. I figured if the one doesn&#039;t get &#039;em, the other will. I sprinkled this between my mattress and box spring. I also used a plastic squeeze bottle (like the kind used for dispensing ketchup) to blow this mixture into all the tiny crevices of my bed frame, as well as the baseboard of the walls around my bed. Worked like a charm!<br /><br />But still, even though I didn&#039;t get any more bites since taking action that first weekend, I still had the bites I&#039;d gotten at the beginning itching the hell out of me. This led me to seek out relief measures for bed bug bites, and I found a great one that&#039;s very easy to do and which really REALLY works! All you need to do to stop the bites from itching is to apply external heat for a minute or two. The way I did it was to use a blow-dryer that I held a few inches away from the bites. I kept the blow-dryer at just the right distance that the heat was intense, but not enough to cause a burn. It should only take a few seconds to determine this optimal distance for yourself. I then kept the blow-dryer blowing on the bite area for about between one and two minutes. That&#039;s it - that&#039;s all it took to put a permanent stop to the itching. The bites I had never bothered me again.<br /><br />I hope these two tips are helpful to anyone else looking to put an end to a bed bug problem.

I don&#039;t know how the blow-dryer remedy would work with mosquito bites since my clash with bed bugs didn&#039;t come until mosquito season was well over. Also, I find that, at this point in my life, mosquito bites only itch me for a few hours at most, then disappear. I&#039;m guessing this is a result of having gotten older because mosquito bites used to hang around and itch a lot longer for me years ago. It&#039;s something I&#039;ve wondered about. So if anyone has any information on the topic of the effects of mosquito bites changing with time, I&#039;d like to hear about it.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Glad things have calmed down for you wrt evil bed bugs.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Thank you!<br />I really hope the bed bug tips I gave prove very helpful to fellow Astorians.

				Standard exterminators are excellent. My Landlord has them treat our apartment monthly for roaches and we never have any issues. <br />Recently my Neighbors had a bad bed bug problem and Standard was called in to treat their apartment and my apartment. Thermal Remediation was used <br />in their space. Thermal Remediation is a process where they super heat the apartment to 150+ Degrees for several hours to kill bed bugs. Then in my Apartment the perimeter was sprayed and any cracks between the floor and walls were sprayed as well. <br />Your friend may want to throw out any furniture that has padding or wood, inspect the bed if they see signs of bed bugs throw the bed out. If not buy bed bug protection wraps for the Mattress and box spring. Getting ride of Bed Bugs is very expensive and not an easy process. They should notify their Landlord immediately of the issue. My landlord paid for the <br />exterminator service and from what I am understanding most landlords will cover the cost of having the exterminator come in to treat the apartment for bed bugs. <br />This is a huge issue in the city currently. There was an apartment building i walked by recently where it looked like 4 apartments had thrown out everything DVD players Beds, dressers, Chairs all saying BED BUGS. Do not have your friends over your house and do not go to your friends house. It sounds extreme but they can create a major headache for anyone who gets them and their neighbors.<br />They are fools if they try to handle this themselves. <br /><br />

				<br />I had them in the Bronx few years back, fought them for couple years on and off. My advice is move out, soon as you can. Chemicals used to treat them are very bad for you health, landlords will tell you no one else has them in the building etc. Once they&#039;re in a building they&#039;ll spread and they can&#039;t be got rid of. Just look for another place, meanwhile spray only when you have to, cover your mattress. Good luck

				Call 311.&nbsp; They will help renters.&nbsp; If your place is infested and your landlord won&#039;t bring in a BED BUG Exterminator (not a regular roach/ant guy) then file a formal call with 311.&nbsp; It&#039;s against the law for a landlord to ignore the problem.&nbsp; It&#039;s a major health issue in NYC.&nbsp; They spread fast.&nbsp; Once they come to fumigate your place, wash all your sheets, clothes and anything laying around in HOT water and dry clothes on HOT.&nbsp; Vacuum thoroughly.&nbsp; There are some great places in the city that sell bed protectors to wrap your box spring and mattress and pillows.&nbsp; Totally worth it.<br /><br />

				Has there been an increase in cases recently? I confirmed that I have bed bugs last week and am freaked out! My super is going to spray my bedroom Wednesday, hopefully that will be the end of them. But from reading online, it sounds like it can be alot more involved. I was in my local hardware store today and the girl in front of me was buying bed bug sprays/ poison.The 2 guys behind the counter were saying that there has been a huge increase in people looking for this stuff recently! I have decided I am going to move when my lease is up. The guy in the hardware store told me that there is a registry online of people who report having bed bugs. I looked it up and it seem almost every second building is on that list. I don&#039;t even know where to move to. I have been a resident of Asoria for approx. 13 years &amp; have had 5 different apartments and have never had an issue before. Have I just been lucky so far or totally naive? Until last week I knew nothing about bed bugs &amp; only knew 1 person who had them, who lives in SI by the way.<br />

				I live near 31st avenue and 33rd street and we have bedbugs in our apartment.&nbsp; The building directly next to mine has had infestations in at least 3 apartments.&nbsp; 2 days ago, someone on my block threw out a mattress and it was infested with bedbugs.&nbsp; They didn&#039;t even put a sign on it.&nbsp; <br /><br />The bedbugs have really screwed up my life temporarily.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had to miss work so that I can clean literally EVERY piece of clothing and fabric in the apartment.&nbsp; I&#039;ve thrown out my dresser where I found the bugs and I&#039;ve spent nearly $600 on this before the exterminator has even arrived: mattress and box spring covers, taking my dog to the vet because he got bit by a bug and the bite became infected,&nbsp; bug spray, plastic bags, tape, flashlights.&nbsp; I&#039;ve thrown out lots of random things I don&#039;t want to take any chances with.<br /><br />Bedbugs are creepy.&nbsp; They live in tiny crevices and they come out when you are in your deepest sleep, usually between the hours of 3 and 5am to feed.&nbsp; They climb onto your skin, release a saliva to numb your skin then suck your blood for about 5 minutes. Each bug usually bites 3 times a night. Then they crawl back to their crevice full-bellied without you feeling a thing until you wake up and notice an itch.&nbsp; They can also go up to 18 months without eating!&nbsp; If you decide to sleep on the couch to avoid the bites for a couple nights, they will follow you to the couch and start living there!&nbsp; They are highly evolved bugs and resilient.<br /><br />If you think you have them, tell your landlord right away!&nbsp; It&#039;s the right thing to do.&nbsp; This is an epidemic and it&#039;s going out of control.&nbsp; <br /><br />Everyone in NYC should have a bed bug cover on their mattress.&nbsp; If you wake up and have ANY type of strange bite or rash, don&#039;t assume it is a mosquito or a rash.&nbsp; Check your mattress seams for any signs of the bugs.&nbsp; They are as big as an apple seed and they will leave droppings of blood near their hiding place.&nbsp; Also, don&#039;t lean anything against your bed.&nbsp; I made the mistake of leaning my dresser against my bed and the bedbugs used the dresser as their hiding place. Fortunately, my mattress was miraculously saved.<br /><br />If you have bedbugs and you throw any furniture out, make sure you spray paint or write BEDBUGS on it so nobody decides to take your furniture home and spread the epidemic to their building.&nbsp; <br /><br />I finally got hit with bedbugs and I realize now that it is a major problem that is not getting any better. Unless we take preventative measures it will get worse and worse.&nbsp; 10 years ago bedbugs were hardly even heard of.&nbsp; Now, everyone knows at least 1 or 2 people who have had them.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I just found out I have beg bugs in my apartment- my management company says it&#039;s $700 for the treatment and they pay for that, but they say I have to pay to wash all of my laundry. Everything has to be washed, everything in the dressers, closets, coat closet, my curtains. Once washed everything has to go in bags and stay there until both treatments are done, the second treatment is 3 weeks after the first. I&#039;m so overwhelmed right now! The guy said I need to vacuum all of my shoes, purses, and my books and bag them too.<br /><br />I have people coming to stay with me next weekend!

				Yes, I had to go through exactly what you are experiencing in an old apartment blg of mine.&nbsp; Same number of treatments, same washing of clothes, heat dryer, and bagging everything.&nbsp; My lease was up and I actually took the opportunity to move, but not before making sure I was utterly rid of the bastards.&nbsp; This included my throwing away a lot including the mattress, and putting all books and papers and other items they are known to hide in into vacuum sealed bags and putting them in storage for four months when I moved.&nbsp; It turned out the entire blg was infested.&nbsp; So they just came through the walls to my apt.<br /><br />It was a nightmare but in a way, a good cleansing process for me.&nbsp; I will never live in another Pistilli building again though.

				Well, I didn&#039;t move the books into bags until the exterminator had come his three times, so they did get doused with whatever air thing he was spraying - you have to leave your apt for 4 hours when he does it. &nbsp;This way they got the dose of poison 3 times before being stuffed into vacuum sealed bags where the air was sucked out so they would suffocate and die if any were left. &nbsp;I was out for blood. &nbsp;Ah the irony. &nbsp; :evil: My clothes were able to be washed and put in the heat dryer, so those were bagged up right away. &nbsp;I literally lived out of bags for a full month before I moved. &nbsp;<br /><br />Just make sure that your neighbors get exterminated too. &nbsp;It&#039;s a horror to go through, but I lived through it and am still in one piece. &nbsp;If you&#039;re on top of it, you&#039;ll kill them all. &nbsp;

Ask someone to grant you access to the building and ask them and the neighbors in the apartments closest to the one you will be renting what the bed bug and overall status is of the building. Are they happy? Any problems? Even if you asked them before, when you were on your tour, you might not have gotten the full story or even the truth. <br />Also, you can go to the HPD website <br />http://167.153.4.71/Hpdonline/provide_address.aspx<br />enter in the address information and you&#039;ll be able to see if the building has any specific problems (bed bugs and more if there are any) and also the apartment numbers of the units that are affected. Keep in mind, this information will not be 100% accurate because the info is only there if the tenant calls 311 and reports it or goes to Housing Court and files an HP Action against the landlord.<br />Good luck!

				SO I have a question. A girlfriend of mine moved into an apartment that she was told was treated for bedbugs. She moved her stuff in, still in boxes, including her covered mattresses. She and her kids suffered no bites. three days later he daughter spotted a bug on her pillow. My friend swears it had to be a bedbug though her daughter was not bit. She literally moved two days later. Threw out the bed, bed linens and dresser. There were boxes in the bedroom where the bug was spotted. <br /><br />She sprayed the boxes and resealed them and also placed all clothing in sealed garbage bags and moved. <br /><br />Is there anything preventative that she could do to assure she didnt move any bugs with her? I told her about the Diatomaceous Earth mentioned here. What do you guys think? Ugh my skin crawls at the thought of that.

				Legally your landlord is responsible to treat the problem. There is an excellent bedbug forum called bedbuggers. If you google bed bug forum, you will find it. I know first hand what a nightmare this is. I didnt have them, but had quite a scare for about 6 months. I remember the lack of sleep and stress we went though. It was awful. I will never look at my sheets or an upulstered piece of furniture the same again. <br />&nbsp;<br />The best advice I can give you is to BREATHE and that though this sucks, this too shall pass. <br />&nbsp;<br />Hang in there!

				Thanks bejessie and angela1969.&nbsp; I just realized the problem the other day and had to discuss it with my husband about what to do, in terms of getting rid of the mattress, and all.&nbsp; I just checked the NYCHA website, and aside from their cleaning and wrapping advice I need to call the regular service number to find out what the Housing Authority does.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m not going to go over all the pages in this discussion to see if anybody&#039;s given this advice already, but here&#039;s some more information if people haven&#039;t had the problem yet:<br /><br /><br />In retrospect I&#039;ve had at least a few bedbugs far longer than I thought.&nbsp; For a couple of years I would occasionally find tiny dried brown bits of something when taking the blankets and top sheet off the bed each day to air it.&nbsp; I had no idea they were dried bits of bug bodies.<br /><br /><br />A long time ago I read the book in which someone describes how to trap bedbugs to prove to the landlord the problem exists - keep the lights out till about 1 in the morning, wet a bar of soap, then pull back the covers and pounce with the soap.&nbsp; The bugs will stick to the soap.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think landlords needs convincing anymore, but if you want to check out the situation do what I did - my husband goes to bed hours earlier than I do, so I went in the room with my L.E.D. flashlight.&nbsp; He didn&#039;t have any blanket or sheet over him so I look him over first, and didn&#039;t see anything on him at the time.&nbsp; Then I went to the heaped up comforter and top sheet that were all on my side.&nbsp; I pawed through them carefully and found live bugs crawling around.&nbsp; One was not so tiny.&nbsp; At first I crushed them with the sheet and brushed the dried dead ones off the bed with the sheet too, but then I put on my very flexible Mr. Clean dish washing gloves and started killing them.&nbsp; It wash shocking how much blood got on the gloves and how quickly.&nbsp; It was hard to lift the edge of the mattress - it&#039;s 8&quot; thick.&nbsp; This kind of mattress is something that most people might occasionally spin to exchange what is the head and what is the foot, but never flip over because it is a pillow top mattress.&nbsp; If you flipped it you would lose that extra cushioning.&nbsp; But by not flipping it, chances are you never see what is under it, and you give the bedbugs a comfy home.&nbsp; I did see bedbugs between the top and bottom mattresses in what little area I could see.&nbsp; I checked his side and found more live bugs - and they were <em>very</em> tiny.&nbsp; Don&#039;t buy this kind of mattress.&nbsp; Buy normal thickness mattresses so you can take the top off more easily and vacuum them.<br /><br /><br />I have 4 sets of sheets - 2 light blue and 2 dark blue.&nbsp; I would use two sets of the same color before switching to the other.&nbsp; The dark blue doesn&#039;t show red blood, but the characteristic streaking of blood that comes when you kill these soft insects in your sleep does appear shiny in regular room light.&nbsp; I assume this is the same with other dark colored sheets.&nbsp; Until there is a cure for bedbugs, don&#039;t buy sheets that are uniformly dark.&nbsp; If you want darkness, choose a pattern with some light areas.<br /><br /><br />I have a dark blue dust ruffle around my lower mattress.&nbsp; It is the kind that fits something like a flat sheet, meaning it goes all across the bottom mattress.&nbsp; I may never have a dust ruffle again.&nbsp; My mother always put a fitted sheet on the lower mattress, and in the future I will do that.&nbsp; While I had the flashlight on his side of the bed I checked the folds of the dust ruffle and saw they are perfect for holding the remains of many dried, crushed insect bodies.&nbsp; That didn&#039;t happen overnight.&nbsp; Because the top mattress is so heavy, the dust ruffle got washed maybe only once a year, twice at best.&nbsp; If you do get a dust ruffle, make sure it&#039;s light in color (and not brown), and since you won&#039;t make the mistake of the deep top mattress you&#039;ll be able to wash your dust ruffle more often.<br /><br /><br />I used to wash my mattress pad 4 time a year and my comforter twice a year, but both have to be done more often than that.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				<span style="font-size: 3.95em;" class="bbc_size"><strong>2414 Astoria Blvd.&nbsp; Astoria, NY 11102 </strong></span><br />&nbsp;<br />My life has become a nightmare! I moved to NY from California a couple of months ago and my life has been changed forever. The first or second night I moved in with roommates, I noticed little bugs crawling on my computer. My lights were off and window was open, so I figured they were just little bugs that naturally come through the screen in the summer. It never dawned on me initially that these were the SCOURGE that is BED BUGS!! The irony is that when I lived in Cali and would see the horror reports of infestations in New York... I would pray that would NEVER touch my life or my children&#039;s...............flash forward and I am now living my worst nightmare come true!! <br />&nbsp;<br />Approximately a week after I noticed these bugs, I became ill. I thought it was the flu because I had a fever &amp; aches and pains.......general flu symptoms, which I now understand can be attributed to the initial bites from bed bugs. Shortly thereafter, I developed welts/bites with a red center..... in a linear pattern.............. it still didn&#039;t dawn on me that these were bed bugs. I showed them to roommates who looked sad but knowing, but never said these could be bed bugs. She said they were probably mosquitoes and her mother first agreed and then said it was probably chicken poxs!!!!!!!!!!!!! Having worked in the medical profession............. I knew this wasn&#039;t possible as I had already had chicken pox as a child and that none of the symptoms were indicative of this. I had a light bulb go off and AH HA moment telling me the joke was on me and everyone else was in on it................ they just didn&#039;t choose to share it with me. <br />&nbsp;<br />Now... you must understand I am a clean and neat freak by nature................. this COMPLETELY freaked me out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Of course research made it evident to me that this was a bed bug infestation......... uggggggggggggggggg. I don&#039;t think I will ever feel clean again!!!!!! <br />&nbsp;<br />To backtrack a bit, before I realized what was going on, I continued to sleep in this bed.... and SURPRISE SURPRISE.... the bites multiplied. I at this point was depressed, crying and beside myself. I came from California and I had never even SEEN a bedbug much less lived with one!!!!!!!!!!!!!! At this point I went to an emergency room and took a few of the &quot;bagged bugs&quot; with me. Of course................ my worst fears were confirmed:(!!!!!&nbsp; I was treated like a leper to begin with............. sitting in the ER waiting room.........people stared at me and moved away from me. When I was called back for my vitals.... one of the nurses yelled at me... &quot;Don&#039;t touch anything and don&#039;t sit in that chair&quot;!!!..... to which she proceeded to get a sheet and put on the chair before I could sit down..............POINT TAKEN!!!!!!! She paraded me back............. ahead of everyone else........... to the Head of Er.... who looked at my bites.....the bugs in my bag and concluded (along with another ER nurse) that these were bed bug bites.................. CAN YOU SAY HUMILIATION????!!!!!!!! Because they didn&#039;t want me to have contact with anyone else.... they took me back to another part of the ER..... another sheet was placed on a chair and I was made to wait for the ER Dr. to bring prescriptions, advice, etc........ of course by this time, I was the &quot;Main Act&quot; ....if you will??????..... people were asking to be moved away from me............. I didn&#039;t blame them.............. the Dr. came out with prescriptions including a course of antibiotics..... anti itch medication both oral and topical.... etc......... I continued on to the pharmacy to the tune of money I couldn&#039;t afford...... FLASH FORWARD A FEW DAYS............. I let my roommates know.... who still insisted they weren&#039;t bed bugs and didn&#039;t want to tell the manager of the building due to other issues they were having............... ultimately...........the manager was told and OF COURSE..... he argued with me and HUMILIATED ME all over again INSISTING .................... these weren&#039;t bed bugs EVEN THOUGH I told him of the Drs. diagnosis!!!!!!!!!!!!!!............... and thus MY NIGHTMARE INTENSIFIED............ I was being called on the carpet and questioned like I was the bad guy.................. are you kidding me??????????????????? still being questioned as to the legitimacy of my diagnosis and being made to feel like this was all in my head EXCEPT.......................... I had physical proof and tons of pics to the tune of 50 or more...............of my bed, bites etc etc etc................the manager then tried to put the blame on me....asking if I lived in motels............. I explained, I came from my CLEAN apartment in Los Angeles, California and I had never even seen a bed bug. He then tried to say the bugs weren&#039;t bed bugs............despite what the Drs. said...............&nbsp; long story short..........he admitted as well as a roommate that, they had a history of bed bugs in the room I was staying in. The landlord said he sprayed once a couple of years ago.......WHAT??????????????? even I, as a lay person, knows this isn&#039;t something that can be eradicated with one treatment!!!!!!!! At that point I decided to take my own action. I stripped the bed to a white sheet and monitored it over the next 3 days.................. hundreds of bugs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOW WHO IS CRAZY??????????????? I am now on my second course of antibiotics, have been sleeping in my sons room upright in a chair for the last 2 weeks......and the landlord has said I have to leave giving some LAME excuse...................... No one wants to accept responsibility for this!!!!!!!!!!!!! They want me to leave so they don&#039;t have to deal with this but I have clothes, papers, etc etc etc that have been contaminated................I WANT JUSTICE..... I DID NOTHING WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I want to know who the owner of this building is????????????? Regardless of what the outcome is for me............... I don&#039;t want ANYONE else to have to go through this. I moved from California and am now about to be homeless because they don&#039;t want to deal with this issue. When I asked how they can live with themselves not telling other tenants in this building............. I get no answer.............. someone should have to answer for this............ I want and need compensation for this SCOURGE they inflicted upon me............. People knew of this problem but didn&#039;t see fit to tell me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BEWARE..................DON&#039;T MOVE IN TO 2414 21ST STREET unless you want BED BUGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

				I&#039;ve been in my apartment for 3 years, and have gotten bed begs twice- it was a total nightmare! They treated basically the entire wing of my building and everything is fine now (knock on wood!!!).<br /><br />I&#039;ll probably be moving out in November, but I&#039;m sort of scared, can new potential apartment rentals ask if you&#039;ve had bed bugs? Can they refuse to rent you the apartment if you have?&nbsp; Do I need something from my management company saying it was treated?<br /><br /><br />

				Thanks so much for all of the good advice and links. I&#039;m so very sorry for those of you who had had to deal with this. To date... I&#039;ve been on 3 courses of antibiotics, steroid injections and countless meds. I&#039;m one of those unlucky people who is highly allergic. If I&#039;m even around anyone who may have been around them I light up like a Christmas tree. The Drs. told me this will get worse every time I have any type of exposure. Not only that, this building should be CONDEMNED!! The room I was in had hundreds of bugs so I got mosquito and tick bites as well and am having classic symptoms of Lyme Disease all the way down to the bulls eye bite that infected ticks make. I&#039;m leaving NY because I&#039;m so freaked out. I don&#039;t even like to go outside anymore. I want the owner/landlord where I stayed to pay but don&#039;t want to sue him necessarily. Any ideas on a demand letter that I can do myself? I want him to pay for all of my medical bills, all of my belongings I had to leave behind including family pictures.... I want them treated and I ABSOLUTELY feel that he should pay!!! I also want him to pay for my computer I had to get rid of (couldn&#039;t take a chance), cleaning bills and endless washing of clothes.... etc. Any ideas I would greatly appreciate. You all have been a life saver!!!!

				Hey All,<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m a journalist currently covering the Astoria (Western Queens) region. I was wondering if anyone on this message board would be interested in talking to me about their experience with bed bugs. Perhaps someone who was not told before moving into their apartment that bed bugs had been an issue, or someone now dealing with bed bugs and renting infested apartments. etc... In addition, if anyone has children/knows parents if children in PS70 (the public school deemed to have the worst bed bug problem in the city) I would love to speak with them.<br /><br /><br />Anyone interested in sharing can contact me at anm2145@columbia.edu.<br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br />Adam

If there are any community meetups about the issue, I would be happy to participate and hear your thoughts/complaints/issues with the problem. Is this something that has just been going on recently? How do you avoid them?

				hi, all.<br /><br />I had an infestation in my Astoria apartment almost 5 years ago.&nbsp; It was torturous but we eliminated them and have not seen any evidence of them whatsoever for those 5 years.&nbsp; <br /><br />Cut to last night when my girlfriend found a single alive, red, adolescent bed bug crawling on our bathroom wall.&nbsp; The bathroom is on the far side of the apartment, completely opposite the bedrooms.&nbsp; Nonetheless, we did a thorough check of our beds, floorboards, walls, etc and found no additional evidence of them.<br /><br />I immediately left a message for the landlord but have yet to receive a return call.&nbsp; I&#039;m wondering what my next step is.&nbsp; I suppose we&#039;ll need a professional come and investigate the place, but I&#039;d also like to know how many of our neighbors currently have bed bugs.<br />

However, the exterminator recommended caulking of holes which the super never did and bedbugs returned. Originally bedbugs were found in August 2010. Then the winter was fine. Around April 2011 noticed fecal matter around windowsills. By May 2011 the bugs were back and multiplying quickly.&quot;<br /><br /><br />What do you think? Should I be really concerned? <br /><br />

				I would be. I read that bed bugs will be especially abundant this summer because of the mild winter we experienced. 1 report out of 66? You know what they say: where there&#039;s one there&#039;s more. Or something like that. I&#039;ve never had an experience with bed bugs, so maybe I&#039;m just really, really paranoid, but then I&#039;m sure there are those who have had bed bugs who are just as paranoid about it as I am.

				funny i registered just to post something strange i just saw and saw this thread.<br />its obvious astoria has a bed bug problem. seems to have been not as sever this summer but last year (when i had them) it was not uncommon to see dozens of mattresses littering the street on garbage day.<br />dont know what to say...they turned my life upside down when i discovered them...but i also managed to get rid of them by myself and cheaply.<br />unless you have a really serious infestation please dont by into the hype. exterminators are making a fortune off of scaring people. i see products for sale at the trade fair that cost 5 dollars that &quot;bed bug specialists&quot; have sold for 15 to 25...these guys are out to get your money...and keep getting it.<br />all the advice in this thread is sound.<br />i did such a good job putting mother earth compound into my walls and then sealing it i not only got rid of my bed bugs i havent seen any creepy crawly things in my apartment in a year now.<br />one thing i find effective if youre trying to get a good nights sleep while fighting them is getting a heavy plastic painters tarp and laying it down on your floor with a light dusting of de underneath it...then put your elevated mattress on top of it. if they come up from below this will throw them off enough to keep you safe until the problem is under control.<br /><br /><br />of course i still sleep with the lights on...<br /><br /><br />scarier even is i work nights. i tend to do a 2 am run to the 24 hour deli to get something to eat and as i exited my apartment i saw...a giant rat! it was like twice the size of a chiahuaha and scurried off as soon as it noticed me...<br /><br /><br />too bad they dont eat bed bugs...

				I had a bed BUG, singular, in late August.&nbsp; I was waking up with the classic 3 bites in a row.&nbsp; Had &#039;em on my hand, knees, and back.&nbsp; They itched so much and were so big that I eventually realized I was not dealing with a mosquito.&nbsp; I immediately took everything in my room (sheets, blanket, clothes, my entire closet as well) and threw &#039;em in the dryer for 30 minutes, while wrapping my bed in a plastic sheet to contain the bugs somehow.&nbsp; While inspecting my bed after, I found a bug, killed it, and wrapped in scotch tape for proof.&nbsp; I kept checking my bed but never spotted another bug, which was weird.<br />&nbsp;<br />I called my management company, and wow, they were awful.&nbsp; They gave me the run around for weeks, forcing me to stay on my couch.&nbsp; Luckily, I received no more bites and my old ones went away.&nbsp; Eventually I learned my upstairs neighbor had a bed bug infestation before I even got bitten.&nbsp; She also called the mangement company and they also ignored her, resulting in things getting so bad in her place that it spread to my apartment!<br />&nbsp;<br />Finally, the management company arranged for the exterminator to come 2 1/2 weeks after I originally called.&nbsp; I had to take everything and put it through the dryer again and keep it in bags.&nbsp; After a thorough inspection and spraying, I was informed the bug I killed was the only bug!&nbsp; The woman upstairs had it bad: she had to toss her couch and mattress.&nbsp; She was sleeping on her bathroom floor.&nbsp; It&#039;s a common thing for one or two to wander from an infested apartment.<br />&nbsp;<br />The paranoia and stress during this experience was insane.&nbsp; I was a shell of a man for 2 1/2 weeks.&nbsp; Now with my mattress cover, box spring cover, and pillow covers, I&#039;m $200 poorer but sleeping soundly.

				By the way I recall that Witch Hazel works good on various bug bites including bed bugs, mosquitos and gnats. Soak a cotton ball and apply liberally every hour and not only will the itch go away, but in 24-48 hours, you won&#039;t even be able to find where the bite was.

				I&#039;m finally reclaiming my bedroom after spending August through November on the sofa bed in my living room. I haven&#039;t seen a bug in four months. <br />The room is amazingly clean, the walls and the floors have been scrubbed, and not a bug has been seen.<br />So, I&#039;m buying a new bed, wiring the room for Cable/HDMI, and moving back in. Life in the nabe is good.<br />The bugs were such an intrusion on my life that my bedroom became the Gaza Strip of my existence--a place I was afraid to go.<br /><br />

				First time poster, I&#039;m considering a move to Astoria in February. I am really paranoid about the whole bed bug situation. I have a friend who lived in Astoria and she had bed bugs shortly after moving in, and her grandmother did as well a few blocks away. I am just extremely worried that I&#039;ll move in and have to deal with the same issues. Is my fear rational or what?

				Bed bugs can come from adjoining apartments or you can unwittingly bring them into your home yourself. They usually attach themselves to clothes, new or worn, be in new clothes you purchas,e or even can be inside your luggage after you come back from vacation. I always wash new clothes as a precaution and dry clean new dress clothes. I recommend you spray your new apartment before you settle in. They have some new bed bug sprays available, such as Sprayway&#039;s Good Night (found it at Key Food) which is basically odorless. Spray around the corners, cracks, closets, dressers, and your bedframe perhaps every 6 months as a precaution.

				bigblue32, the fear is rational, but I&#039;m not convinced the bed bug problem in Astoria is really any worse than other places in the city. We do have a particularly active online community where people are likely to discuss them, but I know two people in Brooklyn who&#039;ve had them in the last few years. I saw one on a subway bench a few days ago. They&#039;ve been found at movie theaters and hotels. They are prevalent in major cities across America and likely many other places in the world. <br /><br /><br />Check out bedbugregistry.com as it might help you feel better - worse about bed bugs in general as you see how widespread the problem is, but not so bad about Astoria specifically.<br />

				Got the word from my landlord today that I have &#039;em in my apartment. They informed me a few weeks ago that the apartment above me had them and wanted permission to inspect my apartment.&nbsp; They finally did today and they say I have them.&nbsp; <br /><br />Pain in the neck.<br /><br /><br /><br />
