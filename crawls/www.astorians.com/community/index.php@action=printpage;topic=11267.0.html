				Hi - I am purchasing a new car and am looking for a parking space somewhere in the vicinity of 32nd Street and 34th Avenue. <br /><br />Also - any idea what a spot is going for now?<br /><br />Thanks!

				I live close to 35th and 34th Ave and I ended up with a $110 spot by 24th Ave. Seems as though the going rate on Craig&#039;s List for our &#039;hood is $200+. I got lucky and found an early morning CL post. Someone had the audacity of asking for 2 months security and 2 months rent. Four months is a bit much for a piece of concrete IMHO.<br />

Or worse, how are you to know how often a brownie ( traffic enforcement agent) passes by and maybe by their count you have already been there an hour? Your word against theirs. Not really worth it.

I always avoid broken meters because I got a ticket at a broken meter and when I went to fight it, the court told me that you cannot park at a broken meter. But, I didn&#039;t have to pay the ticket because the court was informed that the meter was fixed a couple of days after I got the ticket and that the timer was running fast.

We only use our car about once a week so taking the train two stops up isn&#039;t a huge deal for us. It would be a different story if we commuted.
