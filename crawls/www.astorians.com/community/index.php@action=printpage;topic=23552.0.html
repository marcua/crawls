				Anyone know any after hours spots in Astoria or LIC? Something open from like 4-8am or something like that? <br />&nbsp;<br />I don&#039;t care how shady it might be, we can take care of ourselves. Just need a place for friends to go to get a drink when everything else closes.

				Seeing as how its illegal to open at those hours, even the places that are open will undoubtably be selective. I don&#039;t think saying that you heard about it on astorians.com is gonna get you in. On that note, no place is gonna tell you over the phone that they serve after hours, just wouldn&#039;t make any sense

				I&#039;m pretty sure that service of alcohol should not really take place between 4 - 8 am.&nbsp; And Sat going into Sun, you need to wait until noon?&nbsp; Or has that been loosened since I think some Sunday brunches start before noon and serve cocktails?&nbsp; In order to avoid awkward situations in any establishment that is open after 4 am, I think it&#039;s wise to decide earlier if you are up for after hours.&nbsp; Then leave the bar/club and get seated at the diner or where ever and place a hefty drink order before 4 am and then hang out another hour or so.&nbsp; The place may or may not serve openly after 4 but like others said, that policy would not be advertised on Astorians.com.&nbsp; &nbsp;But I can appreciate the wanting the night to go on longer, especially if you started late.&nbsp; A safe option is always at home, unless you will be too noisy.&nbsp; The last thing you need at 5 am is a police raid or some nuts who are totally out of control and causing all sorts of trouble.&nbsp; It&#039;s been a long time since I heard of places in Queens that look like a dentist office by day but are after hours clubs at night.&nbsp; But they did exist and was in a few. Also some bars that will shutter all the windows and kill the lights but stay open until 6 or so.&nbsp; Again, it&#039;s a different city from when I knew that to be the norm.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m not active in this &quot;scene&quot; so to speak, but I know enough to know that you will have a very hard time finding an establishment willing to serve you from 6 - 8 openly.&nbsp; Not without going to some &quot;underground&quot; place, which could be rather intense for someone who is sober and just getting off work.&nbsp; I think you&#039;d find out more about options from others who work night shifts rather than the limited audience on this website.&nbsp; If the authorities came in and you were drinking at 6 or later, it would be almost impossible for the owner to say you were served just before 4:00 am at any reputable diner or other establishment.&nbsp; Sadly I think you will have a hard time trying to find a good time under these circumstances.

				Although it&#039;s not alcohol-oriented, this late night-early morning meal looks very cool. <br /><br /><br />http://www.ediblecommunities.com/queens/world-s-fare/late-night-malaysian-at-flushing-s-curry-leaves.htm<br /><br /><br />They have a late night menu from 4am-11am. I loved the food at Curry Leaves and find they make the best Malaysian food in Flushing.

				Cafe Bar (34th Ave &amp; 36th St) is open 24 hours, and it wouldn&#039;t surprise me if they served drinks early morning to people who are mature and cool.

				If you have to ask, you aren&#039;t out there enough to be in the know.&nbsp; This is an exclusive club that protects itself due to the sensitive nature of the activity.&nbsp; Every time there is a problem there is a good chance of losing one&#039;s secret spot....they are out there but you have to pay your dues by being a regular patron to get in.&nbsp; You can&#039;t expect to go knocking and be let in....
