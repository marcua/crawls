				Title: <strong>image sizes &amp; duplicate messages</strong><br />

				Hi guys. Two suggestions/comments about the board:<br /><br />1) I tried to post an image, and when I hit post, it said the biggest size I could do was 50K. (I think my image was something like 70K.) So this is me asking that the 50K limit be raised a bit (although, I&#039;m not sure how much this would affect bandwidth usage or allow for obnoxiously huge images, yada yada yada. So, overall, not the biggest deal.)<br /><br />So, I resized my image, and went to repost (it had never actually posted because of the image size thing), and something else happened! Which leads me to suggestion/comment number 2.<br /><br />2) When I went to post my message with the smaller image attached, it said I couldn&#039;t because I had already posted that message. But it never actually went live because of the image size thing, so it still exists only in my mind. So, there&#039;s a small bug that&#039;s probably only happened to me that you might want to look at.<br /><br /><br />(I think #2 is especially funny because I was writing about windshield flyers - there is a thread in August about it - and today I had one from Synergy cement itself to my windshield. So I took a photo and was going to email Synergy. But the contact form on their website isn&#039;t working. So I was like, &quot;eh...I can put the message on Astorians! Maybe they&#039;ll see it that way!&quot; but then astorians.com wouldn&#039;t let me post it because it thought I was trying to spam. I briefly considered sending an actual paper letter, but I don&#039;t want them to have my address because I get enough junk mail as it is. So I&#039;m thinking I should just give up on trying to communicate with anyone online for the rest of the evening :) )

				Yeah, I&#039;ve run into that problem before.&nbsp; It might be a limitation with the server or the software, but I&#039;d have to find out for you.&nbsp; I know there is a way to post nice full size images using Flickr and image links, but I&#039;m not sure how.&nbsp; I bet someone here can let you know how.

				Yeah, I know how to post images that are hosted somewhere else (flickr, my own domain, photobucket, whatever). But I didn&#039;t want to post it elsewhere, thinking that it&#039;s just another step. But now here I am 27 steps later just talking about it :) Ha! Oh well.<br /><br />Also I am still looking to where I can buy a blade to scrape this paper off my windshield. Otherwise I&#039;m driving to Manhasset with a 4-inch square of postcard cemented to my driver&#039;s side windshield. Yikes!

				Hi Alison,<br /><br />I&#039;ll raise the limit a bit, I agree this is a little too small.<br /><br />As to number two unfortunately it&#039;s a bug within the underlying SMF software itself and difficult for me to correct. There&#039;s a new version of SMF though in testing that should fix this bug. I&#039;m going to upgrade as soon as it&#039;s proven a stable release.<br /><br />
