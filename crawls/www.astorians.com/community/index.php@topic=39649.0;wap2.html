			Jose Peralta: Stop Empowering Republicans![/size]demonstrationThursday, February 16 at 6:30 PM - 8 PMNext Week · 27–36° Mostly CloudyUnited States Post Office (Jackson Heights, Queens)78-02 37th Ave, New York, New York 11372State Senator Jose Peralta defected from the Senate Democratic Caucus to the IDC (Independent Democratic Conference) to caucus with Senate Republicans. This is indefensible when Senate Republicans seek to push the Trump agenda in New York. Here in the most diverse neighborhood in New York City, we say no to xenophobia, no to Islamaphobia, and no to the Trump agenda!
