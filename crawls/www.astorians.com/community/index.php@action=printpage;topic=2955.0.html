				Did people hear about the lightning in this past Thursdays rainstorm?&nbsp; It hit the building across the street from me, and also hit Trinity Lutheran Church, up on 31st Avenue (at 37th Street).&nbsp; Did it hit any other buildings?&nbsp; How much damage did it do?&nbsp; I&#39;ve never heard of this many lightning strikes during a storm?&nbsp; Was this one worse than usual?

				The lightening and thunder were super loud and very intense near our house. Sure sounded like it hit something around here (Ditmars &amp; 36th st).

				One strike actually hit the roof of my building on 34th/broadway.&nbsp; Not sure if there was a fire as it would have been quickly put out by the rain, luckily (I&#39;m on the top floor!). It did send bricks from the buildings decorative roof falling to the sidewalk though.&nbsp; The FD checked it out and blocked off the sidewalk until repairs were made.

				I just posted something on General Astorian Discussion about it.&nbsp; I&#39;m a member of the church that was struck by lightning.&nbsp; Our pastor said that he went out to the laundromat on Thursday evening and he found a crowd of people with mouths gaping and hardly able to speak coherently.&nbsp; But then he looked up and found the church had been struck.&nbsp; The story was on the Channel 4 news; one parishioner videotaped it and we all watched it after worship today.

				Hell yeah I heard it.&nbsp; It was like a gunshot outside my window &amp; killed my Amp, A computer, a DSL modem &amp; router.&nbsp; I should know better, and have an optillator on the telco and a decent surge protector.&nbsp; TO think I made it this far in my life without ever losing anything to lightning.&nbsp; Damn!
