				24, the wine bar on 24th Ave and 26th street, has had a sign up for a week or two...<br /><br />(http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2731/4466138688_3ab552d757.jpg) (http://www.flickr.com/photos/harlanh/4466138688/)<br /><br />Wait... what?&nbsp; :-o Like, geishas (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geisha)? <br /><br />They appear to have a new business model, perhaps borrowed from the late lamented Club 23. Hmm...

				23, 24... seems like the natural progression.<br /><br />That even looks like the same printing from the &quot;signs&quot; that were on the Club 23 window.

				Fabulous. I always thought that place looked like a bordello, with the dark room/red lights/attic furniture/unmarked fa√ßade.&nbsp; :| {{{shudder}}}<br /><br />Just another thing to make moving out of town a little easier.

				I actually spoke with the owner there when this started, because I&#039;m rather fond of 24.&nbsp; It&#039;s just hot waitresses.&nbsp; Apparently it&#039;s been a big success.&nbsp; I&#039;m still a bit skeeved out by it (I&#039;m against objectifying people, generally), but it&#039;s no worse than Hooters or something.&nbsp; It does make me far less likely to drop in on a weekend though.

				<em>I&#039;m still a bit skeeved out by it (I&#039;m against objectifying people, generally), but it&#039;s no worse than Hooters or something.</em><br /><br />Hooters counts as objectifying women in my book. It&#039;s just as bad, if not worse.<br /><br />We once dropped by Bistro Les Amis on Ditmars, next (near) to Taverna Kyclades. Around 10pm (might&#039;ve been a weekday), it seemed as if the clientele became nothing but men over 50, and the waitresses nothing but hot twentysomething women, some of whom seemed to be sitting with the men. Clearly there&#039;s a market for this, but I&#039;d like to stay as far away as possible from such places. Creepy as hell.<br /><br /><br />

				I understand your stance completely, and did advise Patrick against the idea.&nbsp; I even gave him a list of possible gender-inclusive, non-objectifying alternatives.&nbsp; Sigh.&nbsp;

				Too bad if there is some unsavory objectifying going on.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been to 24 and during the last time especially I found it to be quite nice, if a bit dark. Great wine (from Georgia, the country) and a tasty snack.&nbsp; And if it&#039;s still as dark as it was, I think it might be difficult to see the hot waitresses!&nbsp; &nbsp;8-)<br /><br />And honestly, Christine, it wasn&#039;t at all scary like you make it out to be.&nbsp; Really.

				<br />I guess fridays and saturdays at 24 can now be called &quot;The Sausage Party&quot;, because that&#039;s what it will be.<br /><br />advertising hot waitresses will most likely drive single ladies elsewhere.&nbsp; :roll:

				I want to like this place but it misses the mark. It&#039;s so close to my place it&#039;s a shame. The staff can be a bit overbearing&nbsp; and the times I&#039;ve been it was hard to hold a conversation with friends because of it. Yuck though, won&#039;t be back now for sure.

				I&#039;ve been there too and liked it for the wine/beer selection, but didn&#039;t feel comfortable due to the darkness. <br /><br />Knowing that it&#039;s becoming like Club 23 definitely doesn&#039;t help.
