				Alright, I don&#039;t mean to beat a dead horse on here or anything, but I have searched for threads on Acropolis Gardens and most of them are from several years ago.&nbsp; We are looking to purchase a fully renovated 2BR in the complex and have been doing extensive research on it.&nbsp; I have heard conflicting stories, good and bad, about the property.&nbsp; I understand that it&#039;s big and most of what you will deal with there will have to do with who lives in your particular building with you.&nbsp; A lot of bad reviews that I have read are years old, so I was just wondering if anyone who owns there has any input on the buildings and what their experiences have been.&nbsp; Thanks!!

				Think about it as a place you are BUYING into in addition to it being a place to live.&nbsp; There is equity involved.<br /><br />1) There is no board approval - that means anyone and everyone can live there.&nbsp; You are buying shares in a place where no concern is given to who is moving buying, moving in, etc.&nbsp; <br />2) They immediately allow subletting.&nbsp; What percentage of apartments are actually owner occupied?&nbsp; You&#039;re buying an apartment in a co-op that&#039;s essentially filled with &quot;investment&quot; properties, not into a community of cooperator owners.<br /><br />Take a close look (or have an accountant) take a close look at the financials of the development.&nbsp; How large is the reserve fund?&nbsp; Have there been any assessments?&nbsp; For what?&nbsp; What kinds of major renovations need to be done that have not been done yet?<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard mixed about it myself.&nbsp; Personally, I wouldn&#039;t buy at a place like that because it seems more about quick turnaround and apartment flipping rather than a true cooperative.&nbsp; And I think things like no board approval just invites too much risk into your investment.<br /><br /><br />

				My boyfriend owns the apartment we live in and have no major complaints about the building. It&#039;s affordable and close to the train station. Try to find another building in the Ditmars area that can offer that. I personally like that the Co-op leaves you alone and should you want to move after a while, subletting is a great option.<br /><br />It infuriates me that people on this board will tell you how it is there and give you false and/or outdated information when they haven&#039;t lived there!<br /><br />I have never seen anyone deal drugs there. If you want to find the crackheads or druggies, they hang out in front of the Starbucks.<br /><br /><br />

				We have done research and have looked at countless other options.&nbsp; Hellgate, can you let me know any other properties that gave you better bang for your bucks?&nbsp; Maybe I can check them out as well.&nbsp; We&#039;ve looked at a lot of co-ops and condos and the price here seems to be good for what you get and you can&#039;t beat the location.&nbsp; They are a bit small, however, they have 2 different sized 2BR apts in the complex and we are looking at the larger one.&nbsp; With buying, our monthly expenses here will be the same as where we are renting now and we would probably end up subletting it in the future.<br /><br />Thanks so much for your input cyberia since I&#039;ve heard a lot of rumors myself (mostly outdated) or comments from a &quot;friends, cousins, step-sister&#039;s, nephews, grandfather lived there years ago and told me&quot; type of info as well.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad to hear from people that live there.&nbsp; I have also heard that they have made a lot of improvements in the past few years.

				You&#039;ve got to be Fing kidding me. That gyro shop hasn&#039;t been there that long and it&#039;s owned by a nice Greek family with the only &quot;kid&quot; working there is their son who is in his 20s. It&#039;s not nice or helpful to that business to spread rumors like that.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t witnessed any drug dealing at the Acropolis. While it wouldn&#039;t surprise me if some kid was selling pot, the new security company they hired are always patrolling the grounds so the kids don&#039;t get a chance to hang out.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=19487.msg204799.html#msg204799">Quote from: rhino082 on October 17, 2010, 05:13:45 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Several years ago(5+) I heard that there was a drug bust at the Gyro shop on the corner.&nbsp; Kids there were selling pot.&nbsp; The cops made a huge bust, supposedly the owner went to the cops because he saw it happening for a few months.&nbsp; Also there is a 15 year old kid in a building around me that I&#039;m positive sells pot.&nbsp; He is supposedly one of the supers son.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t seen him around in awhile though.&nbsp; He may have learned not to **** where he eats.&nbsp; &nbsp;Crack and heroin could be a possiblity, but doubtful.&nbsp; <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				There was a gyro shop there before Aphrodite opened up so there has been one there for at least the last four or so years.<br /><br />Also, I&#039;ve happened upon two drug deals taking place in front of the Acropolis two separate times last week while walking home from the train.&nbsp; This is a somewhat normal occurence I&#039;ve seen over the years.<br /><br />Not trying to create conflict - just reporting what I&#039;ve seen from living in the area for years now.

				Aphrodite and Ditmars gyro are owned by the same family.&nbsp; name was changed when Ditmars Gyro was shut down by dept of health.&nbsp; the pot dealing wasnt actually done by workers there, but in front.&nbsp; it was a meeting place and a place they would linger in front waiting for buyers to come by.&nbsp; there was also crack being dealt in the acropolis, but i dont know if its still going on because im not in there as much as i used to be.<br /><br />yes, the super&#039;s son deals pot, its actually some pretty good high end stuff too.<br /><br />yes this is all true, i have no reason to spread a fantasized legend.&nbsp; and i don&#039;t want to imagine what some homosexual does with harnesses, but whatever goes on in that apt wouldn&#039;t affect the quality of life.&nbsp;

				I love how people get so uppity about the acropolis and about parts of Astoria in general. The truth is, no matter where you are in Astoria, there are small time drug dealers, small time crime etc. I live on a very family oriented block, but down the street from me is that sketchy corner store. They have been held up twice. Ive also personally witnessed people selling drugs on that corner. <br /><br />All along Ditmars a few years ago tehre was a rash of robberies. My friend who lives on 36th has seen small time drug dealing on her corner. People. We live in Astoria but we also live in NYC. Dont be nieve to think that because you live on a block with mostly houses or very quiet buildings that crap doesnt go on. Then you talk to people from Ditmars and they seem to think the Ditmars area is higher end than the 30th ave/Broadway area. Its all Astoria, people. Crap goes on. Thats not to say you shouldnt report such incidences or do your best as a member of the community to make it better, but hell, If you cant deal with the reality of living in the city, go to the suburbs. <br /><br />My friend that lives in the Acropolis has a daughter and is very very happy there. Her apartment is so cute. French doors, and a great layout. She has never had bedbugs. Ive seen some DUMPS in the acropolis as well. And actually almost took an apartment there and while cleaning found a note from a previous tenant that they had a bedbug problem. From what I saw maintainance did their best to try to fix it, but... this happens in large buildings... Since they are all privately owned it just depends on the owner. Just know they are all small. I personally think you can totally work a small space if your organized and have an eye for design. <br /><br />Dont let people scare you into thinking the Acropolis is like some housing project. It isnt.

				Thanks Bejessie.&nbsp; You took the thoughts right out of my head.&nbsp; Goodness, if we all judged where we were to live by the potential of drug-deals next door, well then, you might as well live in heaven.&nbsp; I grew up in the burbs, and believe me, drug deals happen there too.&nbsp; Astoria is a very safe area and the majority of us are very happy here.&nbsp; I have friends who live in the Acropolis and they quite like it.&nbsp; Everyone&#039;s going to have their own experiences, but to judge it on whether or not a drug deal happened on the corner or at the store or even in an apartment, geez.....&nbsp; Open your eyes and get over it.&nbsp; Drug deals happen.&nbsp; Percentage wise they&#039;re bound to happen anywhere - house or building.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure it goes on at my street and it&#039;s full of houses.&nbsp; But really, it&#039;s not like Astoria some drug ridden crime area.&nbsp;

				Drug dealing can be anywhere. As soon as we moved to the new house, our neighbor told us about the time a coke deal was going down right in front of our house, oh lovely......&nbsp; :-P<br /><br />The one story I have about the Acropolis: My cousin used to live across the street, and his apartment got broken into twice (the first time, he thinks he got home in time to scare them off, but the back door was unlocked or something; second time, not so lucky- got cleaned out.) He suspects that the perps were keeping an eye on his comings/goings from the Acropolis, since he sometimes noticed people watching....&nbsp; :|<br /><br />But it seems like lots of people live there, and it&#039;s definitely in the center of everything. Maybe ask some of the merchants if they happen to know anybody who can vouch for the building?

				I sure will! I figure if it sucks I can leave in a year. Time for change and honestly that short walk to the subway is going to be a major major plus. I spoke to the tenants upstairs and downstairs. No bedbugs but as with any larger building I will be proactive about preventing them. Mattresses will be sealed, etc. <br /><br />The apartment is small but I think it will be just fine. There are only two of us and two kitties. Im stoked. <br /><br />:)

				I felt it was necessary for me to update this thread because of what happened to us when we moved into our apartment in the Acropolis.&nbsp; We basically moved in on a friday and was moved out by sunday. It was a horrific experience and I swear to you I will shudder every time I walk past that complex. <br /><br />I have many friends who live there who are happy and do not have any sort of bug problems. One of my friends has THE most adorable apt ever and never seen a bug. But there are just too many units in there with bedbug problems and while the management does spray when called, the whole towers are not treated. <br /><br />I moved in on Friday. When I spoke to the landlord I asked specifically about bedbugs. He said the apartment didnt have them. After all my crap was moved in, I was cleaning and noticed the baseboards and outlets sealed. This usually happens after some sort of bug outbreak. Its the correct thing to do to try to keep bugs out. I called the landlord and flat out asked again if there had ever been bedbugs. He admitted a year ago tehre were but they were treated and hadnt returned. The apartment had been vacant for 6 months. I freaked out about how he was legally obligated to disclose this to me. <br /><br />Saturday rolls around and there is a stench in my apartment that we cant figure out where it came from. Like cat pee. Super nasty. My daughter comes from her aunts house and sleeps in her bed (covered with bedbug covers) the next morning she notices a bug on her pillow. <br /><br />Now to be fair, none of us were bit and my daughter is EXTREMELY sensitive to bedbug bites. She got bit once at my dads house when his apt got infested a few years back and it was so bad she wound up at the doctor. Im not 100% sure it was a bedbug. It could have been something else. But that with the fact that the situation wasnt disclosed to me sent me into a panic. I panicked and called the landlord and flipped out. I called my old landlord hwo basically told me we were like family to them and said that we should return home. We did. Our old new apartment is getting a huge renovation. <br /><br />I had to throw out my daughters bedroom set, and every box was opened and sprayed. I had every fabric item removed from the apartment in sealed trashbags and then washed in hot water and dried on high.&nbsp; I steamed everything and had to vacum every nook and cranny to make sure that I didnt bring anything. Im STILL in a panic. Im so petrified of bringing anything from that place into my apartment. <br /><br />With that said, this is the second time I have experienced some bedbug type of situation at the acropolis. Like I said I know people who live there and are totally happy. But this was a nightmare. I will NEVER advise anyone to go to that complex again. My former landlord who owns the unit is so upset that he wants to sue the management company. I got my deposit back. He claims they assured him the problem had been taken care of. Second time Ive heard that.&nbsp; He is going to have a hard time selling his unit which is actually a pretty cute little unit. <br /><br />So as much as I am embarressed that this happened, I even posted in the bedbug forum stating this had happened to a &quot;friend&quot; I felt it was important to give this information to anyone considering the complex. Its a great location. Which is why I wanted to live there. But I was never so happy to come back to my old block. Seriously one of the worst experiences of my life.

				Bejessie - I&#039;m so sorry to hear about your experience.&nbsp; We&#039;ve had nothing with problems trying to deal with the Acropolis and have basically been shown every sign that buying here in NOT a good idea.&nbsp; We&#039;ve been waiting for over 5 months for them to provide certain information the bank has been requesting in order to approve the coop for lending.&nbsp; They still have not provided it.&nbsp; We actually received notice from the bank that they will not approve the property since they have not provided information and every time the management company is contacted they all seem to be on a perpetual vacation/holiday/left early, etc.&nbsp; Funny since everyone was around when they wanted the $700 application fee for the coop approval which is non-refundable.&nbsp; It is interesting how they have no problem accepting checks and applications but can&#039;t provide simple documentation such as proof of insurance.<br /><br />So, we&#039;re back to the drawing board now that we&#039;ve wasted about 6 months, lost a good interest rate as well as some money spent on fees, applications, appraisals, etc.&nbsp; And almost our current place since we gave our landlord notice in January since we were promised to close that month which didn&#039;t happen.&nbsp; Worth it my eyes though seeing as how this could have been a potential disaster.&nbsp; From my understanding there were 5 units waiting on these docs to close some as far back as 9 months.&nbsp; I feel bad for the people trying to sell them but I&#039;m glad that won&#039;t be us down the line.<br /><br />P.S. Good luck with the landlord suing the management company, I did get a hold of the financials and on paper they&#039;re broke.&nbsp; They tried to explain it away to me that it looks that way for &quot;tax purposes so they don&#039;t have to pay as much&quot;.&nbsp; Yeah well too bad for the owners there when the IRS comes knocking.

				God what a nightmare.&nbsp; Thanks for the warning BeJessie.&nbsp; I know from my own bedbug experience that you have to treat the entire complex if you ever expect to be actually rid of them.&nbsp; Otherwise they just travel through the walls and into your apartment again.&nbsp; There are stores below my former bed bug infested apartment building that I specifically avoid because I am afraid of bringing them to my new apartment.&nbsp; It was such a horrifying experience.&nbsp; I realize I can get them from anywhere - even the subway or bus - but I&#039;m paranoid enough as it is.....

				Thank you for all the kind words. It has been a nightmare. We have been back for about 10 days now and no signs of bugs and we never got bit so hopefully we are in the clear. <br /><br />The apartment I moved back into got a huge renovation so for me it all worked out (my apt looks amazing) and all of my old neighbors were happy I moved back. But I cannot begin to explain the emotional aspect of this. Didnt sleep for a week. Was SO afraid of bringing those things to my apt. The cost of washing everything, of replacing my daughters bed. Not to mention moving costs. It was a horrible horrible nightmare and Im just grateful that I can begin unpacking and trying to get back to my life and sleep an entire night without fear of having bedbugs.<br /><br />I have spoken up many times for the acropolis, but the problem with the acropolis is hardly the people in the acropolis. The problem is the management. The management who fails to maintain the building. The management who fails to exterminate an entire tower for a bedbug infestation. Someone told me once that the problem was that the tenants werent letting exterminators in, but in all honesty, Bedbugs are a healthcode violation. To refuse to allow treatment could be brought up on charges. <br /><br />It just makes me sad when I think about it. Whats worse is someone else is going to move into that apartment and possibly someone who wont realize the deal until its too late. I ONLY picked up on it because Ive had so many friends that have had them and noticed when I saw the baseboards and outlets caulked up that something went down. <br /><br />Shell, this was a blessing in disguise. I feel like you dodged the bullet on this one. I hope you guys find something fantastic. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				For everyone&#039;s information regarding bedbugs it is the law that a landlord or real estate agent has to inform the new tenants or prospective tenants that this apartment or any other apartment for that matter has had bedbugs.&nbsp; I know people that have put notes underneath new tenants doors to inform them that the apartment that have rented has had bedbugs or still has bedbugs.&nbsp; Good luck and I wish you the best.

I have no signs of the buggers yet in my apartment but I still am not sure if I am in the clear. However, I spent a TON of money replacing beds, washing clothes, and a two way move. I have spoken to an attorney who wants to go after this guy for damages. I havent slept in over 12 days now. Its literally keeping me awake. Im afraid to unpack anything in boxes. Yet dont want boxes in the apartment. This has truly been an awful experience for us. As much as I just want to put this behind me, I am a single mother so to have taken approx 1500.00 and basically flush it down the toilet because some idiot didnt disclose this to me has really hurt us. I will never be the same after this. Checking every crevice of my apartment. Vacuuminge every day. Checking sheets and mattress covers daily. ugh. what a mess.
