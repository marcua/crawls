				Greetings,<br /><br />I&#039;m strongly considering removing the topic of &quot;politics&quot; from this board. The vast majority of account suspensions and bans are as a result of political conversations that have little to do with the topic of &quot;Astoria&quot; (except by proxy in that it affects the whole country). Furthermore, the posts tend to be extremely long and this makes it difficult for moderators to keep up with the reading.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure that a board about &quot;Astoria&quot; needs to cover the topic of national/international politics - and I&#039;m not even sure it needs to cover local politics. Add this to the fact that I&#039;m growing tired of babysitting this particular topic areas and constantly reminding people to tone it down (or thanking them for not responding in-kind), or suspending accounts and it makes the decision very easy for me.<br /><br />The &quot;rants&quot; section would remain - but discussion of politics should be reserved for one of the million political sites out there that cover this topic well.

As you have indicated that you are &quot;strongly considering&quot; changing the forum to &quot;Rants&quot; (sans politics), here are some thoughts that I hope you will take into account as you deliberate.<br /><br />1. By participating in the &quot;Politics and Rants&quot; section, I have become aware of people who live in my neighborhood who care deeply about issues that I care about. Although I do participate in other forums that discuss philosophy and economics and politics, it is highly unlikely that those national/global forums will lead to my befriending people here in Astoria. It is especially cool to have discovered people whose similar socioeconomic passions and diverse viewpoints will possibly (hopefully) lead to friendships with Astorians right here in my beloved hometown.&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />2. In general, the level of conversation and debate in the topic is actually pretty high, despite the fact that the topic title literally invites people to rant. What does rant suggest to people? Well, the definition of rant is: &quot;To speak or write in an angry or violent manner; rave.&quot; That sounds like what you&#039;re having problems with.&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe calling the forum simply &quot;Politics&quot; or even &quot;Political Notions&quot; would have helped from the outset. And perhaps it&#039;s not too late.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; A modest proposal: throw down the gauntlet to those who post in that topic. Challenge them to keep the level of conversation at a decent and respectful level. We posters can and should consider ourselves on notice that if we continue to waste your time with nasty ad hominem arguments, then we&#039;ll lose the topic. Should be an effective incentive. I honestly think that most of the posters would be willing to cease and desist personal attacks in their posts if doing so means keeping the topic alive on your site. <br /><br />So, again, thank you for astorians.com and for including the Politics topic. I hope you won&#039;t eliminate it.<br /><br />Respectfully Yours,<br />Adam

				I have mixed feelings about this.&nbsp; On one hand, I personally really love politics and reading and writing about it, both locally and nationally.&nbsp; But on the other hand, when I first starting posting on this board, I would post frequently in the politics section, but too often I found myself wanting to write &quot;NO YOU&#039;RE THE effing IDIOT&quot; which of course is both nonproductive and lacking in &quot;netiquette&quot;.&nbsp; And so I started to avoid that whole section.&nbsp; I guess there are a handful of people, most of whom aren&#039;t actual members of our community (in that to the best of my knowledge they&#039;ve never been out to one of the mixers or other activities that are posted up and down these boards) and reside mostly in the Politics thread who are kinda poisonous.&nbsp; There are certainly conservatives and liberals on this board who are capable of expressing themselves without name calling and baiting, but there are also a few who aren&#039;t, and they get everyone all riled up.&nbsp; And once again, this mainly happens in the Politics thread.&nbsp; <br /><br />The easy answer, for me at least, is to be stricter about moderating these folks in these threads, but thats just easy for me b/c I&#039;m not a moderator.&nbsp; I have no idea how much profit, or more likely how much loss, Merm makes off this site, so if he says he doesn&#039;t have the time or the patience to monitor the Politics thread, than I have to believe him.&nbsp; If this means these threads get shut down, well so be it, I won&#039;t be leaving these boards.<br /><br /><em>BUT</em> I do hope we can still talk about local Western Queens politics and news here.&nbsp; As the chair of the TA Queens Committee (http://groups.google.com/group/TAWQ), Astorians.com has been a great resource for us, not only to get the word out but to find out whats happening locally.&nbsp; I recently first learned about ConEd potentially selling their 20th Ave location (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=9381.0) here on the boards, thats a huge deal for our group, and as a volunteer group we don&#039;t always have the time to attend the CB meetings and hear this for ourselves.&nbsp; Also this board has put me in touch with some great local activists and political folks (most of whom don&#039;t regularly post in the Politics threads to be honest) and has been personally very valuable to me that way too.<br /><br />Wow, this is almost long enough for the Politics thread... Anywho, its a shame when a few bad apples have to ruin it for everyone else, but if it comes to that, lets please remember that local politics, though often equally incendiary, are just as important to some of us on the board as the wingtacular... if thats even humanly possible.

				Many thanks for the comments so far. Just as a quick response to the points raised:<br /><br /><strong>1. &quot;It is especially cool to have discovered people whose similar socioeconomic passions and diverse viewpoints will possibly (hopefully) lead to friendships with Astorians right here in my beloved hometown.&quot;</strong><br /><br />I have no problem with Astorians being used to find other people who are interested in politics in the community - you just would need to use the board to meet up, and not carry on the actual discussion here. That way a local bartender or cafe barista gets to be the moderator of the conversation instead of me. :)<br /><br /><strong>2. &quot;Maybe calling the forum simply &quot;Politics&quot; or even &quot;Political Notions&quot; would have helped from the outset.&quot;</strong><br /><br />Could be, but these kinds of conversations happen in other sections too. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the name of the topic that makes people feel entitled to be rude and childish - I think it&#039;s the subject matter itself.<br /><br /><strong>3. &quot;Throw down the gauntlet to those who post in that topic.&quot; &quot;Be stricter about moderating these folks in these threads&quot;.</strong><br /><br />Unfortunately this is what we&#039;ve been doing for years, and this is what I&#039;m tired of incidentally. :)<br /><br /><strong>4. &quot;Its a shame when a few bad apples have to ruin it for everyone else&quot;</strong><br /><br />I agree, but when it comes to politics, even the most kind and normally composed people on these boards can join the fray. I don&#039;t think this is just a few bad apples we&#039;re talking about, I think politics itself is the bad apple because I see good folks who are some of the friendlies in the neighborhood acting completely out of character when it comes to politics.<br /><br />Thanks to Heff and Adam for commenting!

				Can you clarify your idea a bit more?&nbsp; Are you talking about just removing the politics section or attempting to remove the political conversation from the board?<br /><br />I think the conversation will happen with or without the section and you may find that the section contains the dialogue a bit more.&nbsp; Without the section I think the dialogue is still bound to happen on with spill over to other areas.<br /><br />If you are thinking that political discussions in general should be removed from Astorians -- I would strongly disagree with that.&nbsp; Grassroots and community politics (within community affairs and national politics brought into discussion and action) at the local level are the most powerful sort of politics.&nbsp; While we don&#039;t always agree as a community, I think the dialogue with people living together in a community is in itself an awesome thing. <br /><br />This said from someone who almost never participates in that particular forum but who is a bit politically active.<br /><br />Just something to think about.<br /><br />cheers,<br />jayme<br /><br />-j

				Yes, I&#039;m talking about removing the politics category from the board, and discouraging (though not perhaps censoring altogether) discussion of &quot;politics&quot; in general on this site.<br /><br />While the idea of &quot;grassroots and community politics (within community affairs and national politics brought into discussion and action)&quot; is a great idea in concept, the types of discussions that I&#039;m talking about (that happen on the politics board) are not these kinds of discussions. Most of the political dialog that happens here is pure rhetoric - very little of it is &quot;community activism&quot; related.<br /><br />The kinds of discussions that happen in the &quot;local chat&quot; or &quot;community events&quot; board however are different - even though they have political undertones to them. Like &quot;what shall we do about crime in the neighborhood&quot;, or &quot;Astorians for [insert candidate here] meeting @ [insert cafe here]&quot;. These discussions rarely if ever collapse into emotional and abusive (not to mention long) rants.<br /><br />I am all for grassroots community affairs - because it is speech rooted in action, but those threads are seldom found in the politics board are seldom up to this standard. On the politics board we just discuss how much we love/hate Bush, whether or not all [insert immigrant race here] are terrorists, and why everyone else besides us is wrong.

				Merm, I absolutely sympathize with you and the moderators.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been in here long enough to know a few things:<br />1. People are generally here with the best intentions for community in Astoria.<br />2. There are trolls and flamers and whatever else you call them in here and they love the politics board.<br />3. The politics board has had flare ups and fights since day one and must be a real pain in the ass to you all.<br />4. It&#039;s politics and people get carried away, very far away at times and very low down.<br />5. But obviously it&#039;s one of the most popular sections and taking it away would most likely lead to spill over.<br /><br />What to do?&nbsp; It&#039;s a tough one. I agree with the previous posters in saying that this section has been an important part of this site.&nbsp; What a great place to exchange thoughts and fight for your beliefs, know your fellow Astorian&#039;s views and learn a few things.&nbsp; To take it away seems harsh but very understandable.&nbsp; <br /><br />Two idea&#039;s come to mind.<br />1. Make it an uncensored section like on an adults website where you enter at your own risk (and maybe a 3 strikes and you are out policy).&nbsp; It&#039;s politics after all and what&#039;s dirtier than that?<br />2. Some of us create our own version of &quot;Drinking liberally&quot; and meet up from time to time for politcal conversation and a pint or two.<br /><br />-Hoping it stays on Astorians.

				Hi Merm<br /><br />I understand your frustrations entirely and the time and effort it must take to run this site. But one thought occurs to me: how can local politics in Astoria not be relevant to discussions of what&#039;s going on in the neighborhood? <br /><br />&quot;Rants&quot; can easily turn political so I&#039;m not sure how can the two be separated and still make the discussions interesting, informative and relevant.<br /><br />My soultion is to perhaps require each thread start with a non-rhetorical question to be answered, to promote discussion, rather than a statment or diatribe that results in dissection and conflict.<br /><br />I want to thank you for starting this site. I enjoy it for a multitude of reasons and try not to let the more heated discussions get to me (though I&#039;m always not successful). Whatever you decide I&#039;ll be visiting Astorians as often as I do now.<br /><br /><br />

				I can&#039;t say I&#039;d miss the politics discussions one bit.&nbsp; I agree with every one of your reasons, pretty much.&nbsp; I mean, who has the time to constantly monitor these really long and often off-topic discussions, that lead into name-calling, etc, and break the rules that you have established.&nbsp; You&#039;ve been trying to enforce the rules for years now, and it never works.&nbsp; I tend to avoid the politics discussions because I honestly get so annoyed with the way they are in general, and to be honest, most of the discussions end up being between 5 key people.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see why there can&#039;t be meetings held elsewhere to have these discussions, so that Merm does not have to, in many ways, babysit the discussion.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, I do know that politics will come up in other areas and I don&#039;t think Queens related politics should be eliminated completely - as this would have more to do with Astoria in general.&nbsp; But let these Queens related topics come up in other areas, you shouldn&#039;t have to monitor all these other political discussions that have little to do with Astoria.

				It surely isn&#039;t looking good here for keeping the Politics forum.&nbsp; :cry:<br /><br />Some more points for your consideration, merm.<br /><br />4. Astorians.com purports to reflect our community. The conversations in each of the topic areas reflect the views of participants who live in or care about Astoria, no less so in the Politics thread. The question should not be, &quot;What does a conversation about national public policy or politicians have to do with Astoria?&quot;, it is, &quot;What do people who consider themselves Astorians care about and think about national public policy and politicians?&quot; The views in astorians.com&#039;s Politics and Rants thread will differ from the views (and priorities and emphasises) that would be found in the same topic area on sites all over the country. Because, you know, we&#039;re ASTORIANS!&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />5. Getting together for beers and having political conversations in person complements but does not adequately replace participating in an online community discussion of politics (or anything other topic, from recipes to florists to photography, etc.) that involves hundreds if not thousands of other people. Ideas and issues being discussed openly in a public forum fosters accountability, which is a good thing for everybody involved. People getting together in a bar will tend to reify their beliefs/assumptions/policy positions more than to challenge them.<br /><br />6. I&#039;d like to reiterate that most of the conversations in the Politics and Rants forums are civil and engaging. Even threads started with topic names that are controversial are pretty well &quot;moderated&quot; by the decency of the participants instead of from above. <br /><br />7. Consider letting this forum moderate itself. <br /><br />Cheers,<br />Adam<br />

				I&#039;m going to preface this with the obvious: It&#039;s your site and you should do with it what you want. <br /><br />That said, here&#039;s my 2 cents:<br /><br />1. I agree with people about spillovers. You can&#039;t have a public site and expect all conversations to stay entirely on-topic. One thing will lead to another and the topic might become something else. I actually appreciate your not moving things around too much like some other forums in my experience (this makes finding yours and other posts hard, takes things out of context, etc....). If you decide that political speech doesn&#039;t belong here (to quote you, &quot;I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the name of the topic that makes people feel entitled to be rude and childish - I think it&#039;s the subject matter itself.&quot;), then it will be your prerogative whether you move or lock a thread that crosses that line. Depending on how intensely you decide to follow this approach, the flow of conversation on this site may become a bit too... controlled.<br /><br />2. I can appreciate the difficulty and frustration in moderating a board where you have to babysit. My suggestion: stop babysitting this particular topic. See Debbie&#039;s revelation above as an example of self-regulation at work. Plenty of people in that forum will keep it from devolving into something horrible. Give them responsibility for the tone and maybe they won&#039;t test your limits. Maybe they&#039;ll rise to the occasion when they know that the overall tone of the area is their responsibility (reflects on them) instead of your responsibility. Treat people like children, they&#039;ll behave that way.&nbsp; I say, just let it be open. <br /><br />3. For people who don&#039;t like the politics threads, change the channel! It doesn&#039;t mean that everyone should not be able to participate because you personally don&#039;t enjoy them. And by the way, what is the big deal with long posts? I didn&#039;t realize there was a time limit on posts? <br />

Most of the threads don&#039;t &quot;degrade.&quot; Some of them include flashpoints where the exchanges become heated, but that&#039;s par for the course in a Politics thread, right? <br /><br />I don&#039;t see the conversations &quot;often&quot; degrading or &quot;almost always&quot; rehashing same positions and discussions. I am regularly surprised to discover the people with whom I find myself in agreement and disagreement, surprised by the introduction of engaging topics and the in-depth conversations they engender. Sure there are exceptions, but that&#039;s life. You don&#039;t throw out the baby with the bathwater. <br /><br />As for the &quot;usually the same 5-10 people&quot; comment, you can and should say the same thing about other threads having the same basic core group of people participating in them. The &quot;Last Poster Wins&quot; or &quot;My Favorite Salumeria&quot; threads don&#039;t end up in heated exchanges, but who would expect them to? <br /><br />Also, many more people read (dare I say, enjoy?) the threads than participate in them by posting. The effect of ending Politics and Rants isn&#039;t going to be limited to 5-10 people.

				Thank you for the site and the hard work, Merm.&nbsp; It has been a great tool to get to know more about my community.<br /><br />My vote goes for keeping the Politics section and I second (or, I guess, third) Gleason&#039;s addition of the 3 new topics and, perhaps, say adding a 4th that is National Politics.<br /><br />While I agree that the purpose of this forum is, mainly, to talk about things Astoria, I know that I and, perhaps, many others utilize it as a forum for political discourse.&nbsp; I am involved with other forums, but they are definitely very specific in their nature and are not as open and conducive to talking about politics.<br /><br />Sure, having the threads degrade to bashing one another is not pretty and a PITA, but I think maybe you&#039;re throwing out the baby with the bathwater by removing the section altogether.&nbsp; This forum brings a multitude of people with diverse backgrounds together to discuss everything better than any other forum I&#039;m involved with.&nbsp; Disagreements are bound to flare up; hell, look at the Applebee&#039;s thread.<br /><br />But, that&#039;s part of it all.&nbsp; To me, it almost seems like removing the Politics section is removing an avenue of free speech and bringing down heavy regulation because some (even many, at times) don&#039;t like the way the discussion plays out.&nbsp; Politics is just one of those things that drives most to get very defensive or aggressive; but it doesn&#039;t necessarily mean that great ideas and points aren&#039;t being exchanged in there before reaching that point.<br /><br />With the bias and censure that the main media outlets seem to have already, the discussions here are almost a breath of fresh air because they are so candid.<br /><br />My vote is to keep the avenue open, leave it uncensored and unregulated, and only step in if things get WAY out of hand.&nbsp; Self regulation could work well here, too, and perhaps it could be left up to us to &quot;report&quot; posts/threads that have gotten out of hand?<br /><br />Thanks again for everything.

Quality of life and local politics issues I think would work fine in the &quot;local chat&quot; section - and many of those discussions end up there anyway.<br /><br />Also, I just want to restate that this site does not permit &quot;free speech&quot; - this is a site about Astoria, so the discussion is intended to be limited to those topics. There are many restrictions that both I (as moderator), and the rest of you place on each other - and I think that&#039;s a good thing. I&#039;m not against political conversation - but the question is whether or not it&#039;s appropriate and helpful in this particular venue and format. There are other venues and formats that may be more conducive to general (especially national) political discourse (and I may even be willing to help start a venue specifically for that if we find a way to achieve that that satisfies everyone).<br /><br />Problem is that many very nice folks can&#039;t seem to control themselves and act civilly when it comes to these general political issues (liberal vs conservative), and it ruins it not only for them (when I ban them), but for me, and for some others who don&#039;t read the threads, but post. As for having the board be 100% &quot;open&quot; (in that people can say whatever they want) I can honestly say I&#039;m against that. Too many people have left the site entirely because of something someone said - I&#039;m not inclined to allow a single (or a few) trolls offend the entire board and drive the community away leaving only those with the thickest skin left on the site.

				I know that, whether my posts have been personally offensive or not, I am one of those who continues and adds fuel to the fire on the politics section of the board. &nbsp;That being said, I think that most of the discussions do have some intelligent and insightful discourse. I know the Frappe, Billz and several others have managed to maintain thoughtful discussion while holding very contrary views. As in any realm of personal conversation, you will run into some who don&#039;t add as much to the conversation as others or some who are there merely to rile people up.<br /><br />I fully support the idea of making the politics board an &quot;Enter At Your Own Risk&quot; portion of the site. I&#039;d much prefer to defend the arguments from trolls through our own merit or ignoring them than to have it shut down all together.<br /><br />I like being able to discuss political issues here. There are several members whose opinions, while not always anywhere near my own, I look forward to hearing and respect. I would like to continue that discourse. Certainly though, the board is not mine to dictate and I feel that further moderation of the forum would probably lead to the inability to actually have the kind of discussion I value. <br /><br />Do what you feel is necessary, merm.

				Merm, the title of your thread is &quot;Politics Topic to be Discontinued.&quot;<br /><br />Your first post then suggests that you&#039;re open to persuasion. To most of us, &quot;seriously considering&quot; connotes open-mindedness. <br />&quot;Considering&quot; means &quot;thinking about,&quot; not &quot;leaning towards.&quot; Which is why some of us are presenting a case to you for keeping Politics and Rants despite your thread title.&nbsp; <br /><br />As you are &quot;seriously considering&quot; this issue, your thought process would surely turn up a reason or two for keeping the Politics and Rants section. It would be great to hear you play devil&#039;s advocate. You&#039;ve told us about the reasons for closing it down, but if those reasons were not countered by reasons for keeping it open, you would have shut it down already. You wouldn&#039;t have started a thread about it if your mind was already made up. In other words, your own conclusion is not conclusive to you, if we&#039;re to understand your thread title in the context of your first post.<br /><br />As everybody has observed, this is your board so you can do what you want. You chose to create a thread that simultaneously states a final decision and then suggests a process whereby that final decision might be contradicted.<br /><br />Are you, in fact, open to persuasion? Inquiring minds would like to know.

All they have to do is not click on it. Those who do click on it are likely to find some agreeable, some disagreeable, some thought-provoking, some upsetting material. But we clicked on it. We made a choice to enter it and, guess what, we can make a choice to exit. All on our own.<br /><br />Your proposition that Astorians.com as a whole will benefit from removing a section that is completely voluntary is specious. It would be different if people who visited your site were somehow forced to enter the Politics and Rants section, forced to read things they would never choose to. But they&#039;re not. &nbsp;All that removing the Politics and Rants section does is eliminate an outlet for local Astorians to share their perspectives and ideas about relevant topics. And I repeat, the site is about Astorians, not Astoria. We are as much what Astoria is about as Astoria&#039;s shops and dining options and museums and parks, etc. <br /><br />Now, if the principal problem is that the moderators are annoyed by the amount of time it takes to read through all of the threads and posts, then that problem is easily enough addressed by changing your moderating approach to that part of the site. But to terminate the whole section is radical. <br /><br />Of course, you have the right to do it, but dong so is inconsistent with the spirit of free and open discourse that the web represents. &nbsp;<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=9507.msg113073.html#msg113073">Quote from: merm on February 17, 2008, 05:02:03 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> The more I have to ban normally friendly people from the site because they lose their cool, the more it feels that this kind of discussion detracts from the site more than it benefits it.

Just stop banning people. Let us work it out. We will work it out. Cooler heads will prevail. Most if not all of the people on these boards are decent to the core and mature, too. People will calm down and apologize for flaming, other posters will call for a return to arguments instead of name-calling. If you let it be, it will be fine. <br /><br />As a site-wide policy, if somebody is constantly mean-spirited and always engages in ad hominen attacks and/or explicit bigotry of any sort, ban them for life, don&#039;t suspend them. Make that clear and then let the Politics and Rants section govern itself. <br /><br />I sincerely hope that you will experiment with changing your moderating approach to Politics and Rants before terminating it altogether.

				It sounds like this is a resources issue. I know it is probably difficult to find enough moderators to manage the content flow of the site in a way that doesn&#039;t lead to burnout. I personally don&#039;t spend much time in Politics and Rants, but I know it&#039;s important to the community and a lot of people would hate to see it go. Some thoughts - <br /><br />1. Find more moderators- maybe some astorians.com members in good standing could moderate on a rotating schedule.<br />2. Spin off non-local politics onto another forum or blog, passing along the ownership to someone else. (It would be really easy for one of the wonks to start a blog and point other politically minded astorians there).<br />3. Don&#039;t make access to politics and rants immediately available for posting. It could be an area that comes available when you reach a certain number of posts, have been around for a certain amount of time, specifically request to join, or a combination of all 3. This would reduce the likelihood of a random troll surfing by and joining the site just to stir the pot.<br /><br />That&#039;s all I&#039;ve got. I hope you find a solution that eases the burden of running the site as well as keeping a healthy political debate option available to astorians.

				I am in such conflict over this. It seems to me that argumentative people always find something to argue over. If politics is banned, what will pop it&#039;s ugly head up next? Will you have to ban discussions on religion? The decriminalization of drugs? The whole Applebee thing got pretty ugly for a while, too. But there was no talk about locking the thread. There will always be hot topics where there can virtually never be any consensus. Banning voices on any particular subject, even in a privately run forum, is a form of censorship. If it was the vituperative or demeaning language of the posters that got out of hand, then perhaps more strenuous moderation should be in order. The first offense could result in a 48 hour site ban. The second in a 1 week ban. The third a total, forever banishment. People will soon catch on that there are certain things that are simply not allowed as they are deemed inappropriate for the forum.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=9507.msg113050.html#msg113050">Quote from: merm on February 17, 2008, 02:49:52 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Too many people have left the site entirely because of something someone said - I&#039;m not inclined to allow a single (or a few) trolls offend the entire board and drive the community away leaving only those with the thickest skin left on the site.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Was what was said really uncalled for, or mean, threatening?

But I do know that you have allocated so much of your time, effort and money to maintaining astorians.com, and that you are dedicated to seeing it become successful, that I must trust your instinct to listen to those who you have requested guidance from, with the understanding that whichever way your decision goes there will be people leaving the forum because they disagree with that decision.

I don&#039;t think merm should have to read every single post any more than I think anyone else should. A better solution might be to have someone other than merm monitor just the politics/rants section, since obviously it is a subject a lot of people find important to this community, and there are probably some people who would be happy to keep tabs on what&#039;s going on there. Maybe make that category members-only, also.<br /><br />Unfortunately, if the objective is to rid the board of conflict, getting rid of a couple categories isn&#039;t going to do it.

				I&#039;m grateful for the discussion surrounding this issue. As I see it the politics/rants section is among the most unruly of the site, and over the years most of the people that either get suspended from the site, or leave the site do so because of a rant or a political flame war that starts in that section.<br /><br />That being said, I do recognize the positive effect that diverse discussion can have on the site if civil. I&#039;d like to try something on a trial basis.<br /><br />First, I&#039;ve updated the board rules/guidelines, borrowing from some of the points made in the eGullet forum rules. I think there are some good guidelines for posting there that we can all benefit from. Please review them (http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=8222) if you haven&#039;t lately. These rules <strong>especially</strong> apply in the discussion of politics/rants.<br /><br />Second, I&#039;m going to narrow the number of users that can access that board. Only those above a certain post count will be able to post there (TBD). I&#039;m still considering whether or not people without the ability to post will see the board, or if I&#039;ll require people to be logged in.<br /><br />Third, I&#039;ll evaluate the politics/rants board closely and may make tweaks in upcoming weeks. I&#039;ll post those here.<br /><br />

Thanks for your thoughtful post. I hope the following is helpful. So that you and others know, there are at least two people who merm temporarily banned from this forum. <br /><br />Merm, is there a set length to a temporary banning or is that up to your discretion? <br /><br />***<br /><br /><strong>Here&#039;s the post, in response to Debbie, that got Billz1981 banned.</strong><br /><br /><em>&quot;That hardly sounds constructive.&nbsp; Is the situation a joke to you, and the punchline is that you get to laugh at what you assume to be the ignorance of the original posters?&nbsp; Neither of us were there, and it may or may not have gone down the way they say it did.&nbsp; But I fail to see why you going to the gas station would be of benefit.&nbsp; You were not there, you have no quarrel with the guys who own the station, and it is none of your business.<br /><br />Besides, how will you find the time?&nbsp; Aren&#039;t you busy knowing more gay people and diverse friends than anyone else, being discriminated against, running a business that is more successful than anyone else, reading many diverse publications with many viewpoints because you recognize the U.S. media isn&#039;t as good as the European one, baking cookies for the troops, founding peace organizations, etc. etc?<br /><br />Ok, I guess that was a little mean on my part.&nbsp; Nothing personal.&nbsp; I just feel that lately, for the past year or so that I have participated on this board, your posts have been a little goading and condescending.&nbsp; You constantly purport to be a person of tolerance, but then find a way to slam someone else who holds viewpoints that differ from yours.&nbsp; If you were really interested in diversity, you would welcome an honest discussion with the conservatives on this board (all two or so of them) instead of grandstanding with your snide comments.&quot;</em><br /><br /><strong>Here&#039;s the post, in response to Debbie, that got paratactical banned.</strong><br /><br /><em>&quot;Your blanket disapproval of anyone fitting under this label is just as disgusting, close-minded and ignorant as blanket disapproval of Muslims, gays or any other group.&quot;</em> <br /><br />&quot;...this label...&quot; refers to &quot;conservative&quot; in the context of her whole post.<br /><br />It&#039;s worth noting that it is, in fact, Debbie&#039;s &quot;blanket disapproval&quot; that is being criticized. This is passionate, but by no means a personal attack.<br /><br />***<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if anyone else was banned, NYCMacUser. You should read the above posts in context. It&#039;s so much more poignant when you see that everybody is getting along on page 7 until Debbie ... oh hell, I don&#039;t want to ruin it for any of you! Check it out: http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=9418.0. <br /><br />It&#039;s a fascinating read! <br /><br />Note the wide-ranging, free-flowing nature of the conversation and how it demonstrates the participants&#039; inclinations at various points to moderate themselves. <br /><br />Fans of Greek tragedy will recognize the ironic role played in the thread by Debbie, who called for the thread to be locked immediately on page 1 and then instigated the exchanges starting on page 6 that resulted in merm feeling it was necessary to lock it by page 8.&nbsp; Maybe by page 10, everything would have resolved itself peacefully, with everyone better off for persevering, but the opportunity cost of merm shutting the thread down is that, alas, we&#039;ll never know.<br /><br />I hope this has been enlightening.<br /><br />L&#039;Chaim,<br />Adam

Nothing paratatical wrote was a personal attack. She was characterizing as offensive to her the exact behavior that you proscribe in your Rules section. <br /><br />So, again, please end these bans.<br /><br />And, if you banned Debbie, please end that now, too. <br />Debbie was ranting in the Politics and Rants thread. She is clearly contrite about it. <br /><br />Your new Rules remain far too arbitrary. To quote, <strong>&quot;- Act appropriately: We do not permit comments that we deem abusive, baiting, defamatory, insulting, harassing, inflammatory, hateful, obscene, inappropriately rude or personal, retaliatory, threatening, invasive of privacy or violative of any law.&quot;</strong> That is a long list of highly subjective excuses to interfere in people&#039;s debates with one another.<br /><br />Merm, it seems as if you are chasing a level of control that is neither feasible nor, in the final analysis, desirable for any of us. You sent a chill through the Politics and Rants board when you locked that thread. Locking that thread and the bans have been far more damaging to that section than the discussion that was transpiring there. <br /><br />I hope you will come to the conclusion, sooner rather than later, that free and open debate, that is, debate by people who feel genuinely free to express themselves thoroughly and honestly, is itself nearly always the best way to moderate exchanges of ideas. <br /><br />Sincerely Yours, <br />Adam

				Adam. While I appreciate the feedback I consider this case closed for now. Moderation overall is highly subjective - and as you probably know rules regarding appropriate conversation is a difficult thing to quantify - and are difficult to enforce.<br /><br />However, the purpose of this site is not primarily to facilitate &quot;debate&quot;, but to facilitate &quot;discussion&quot; relating to Astoria - there is a difference. If someone feels that in order to make their point they need to resort to &quot;abusive, baiting, defamatory, insulting, harassing, inflammatory, hateful, obscene, inappropriately rude or personal, retaliatory, threatening, invasive of privacy or illegal&quot; methods, then I&#039;d prefer they not be on this site.<br /><br />If I&#039;m chasing a level of &quot;control&quot; that is not feasible or desirable for anyone then I&#039;ll just end up removing the politics section altogether (we&#039;ll see how things go with the changes made first though). If we can&#039;t have discussions about politics that are free of insults and respect I&#039;ll have no problem refocusing the site away from those topics and encouraging people to go elsewhere if they want to engage in that kind of discussion. Should that day come, I&#039;ll be glad to assist anyone affected in finding an alternative venue (online or offline) for continued political debate - it just wouldn&#039;t be a feature on this site.

Debbie and Billz would have either agreed to disagree and moved on or reached a new level of understanding about each others&#039; perspectives. And today, the Politics thread wouldn&#039;t seem like Siberia with an intimidating WARNING sign in front of it.<br /><br />In this case, you really could have pleased &quot;everybody.&quot; That is, the involved parties (very small group) would have respected and benefited from a soft touch. Because it would have been a moderate and constructive response that consumed less of your time... everybody&#039;s time and energy.&nbsp; <br /><br />Merm, this isn&#039;t merely venting. It&#039;s a pointed constructive criticism of your moderating approach, its upsetting and chilling effect, as well as how you come across by engaging in it.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t keep after you about this if I weren&#039;t generally happy about what Astorians.com offers and, at the same time, genuinely convinced that you believe there was nothing wrong with or even contradictory about your retaliatory approach to moderation in this instance.<br /><br />The owner of a property has the legal right to do what he wants with it, but morality applies to an owner&#039;s actions as they affect people on his property, too. On a property that thrives based 100% on user opinion sharing, thread-locking and user-banning should be undertaken as last resorts in extreme cases.<br /><br />-Adam

				Adam - I consider this case closed for now. <br /><br />I do appreciate your enthusiasm for the site and community but moving forward we will be trying out the new format for the discussion of politics. Additionally, going forward &quot;the rules&quot; which are posted as a link on every page of this site, should serve as a constant reminder of the guidelines that we all agree to in order to participate in this discussion. Members should not depend on a moderator to remind them to stick to board guidelines. And after four years of running this site I can say that a &quot;light handed&quot; approach actually encourages people to push the limits knowing that they&#039;ll get a warning first before any action is taken (perhaps it&#039;s the conservative in me). For this reason I don&#039;t plan on taking a &quot;soft touch&quot; approach to my administrative duties here - especially in the context of politics, which has been a trouble spot for misbehavior on the site historically.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be happy to evaluate this topic again down the road once we&#039;ve seen what transpires over the next days to weeks.

Which in my recent suspension they most certainly were not.<br /><br />Therefore, I strongly protest justification in which they were applied to a recent post I made. In this instance, it&#039;s longer a question of what kinds of content is welcome by the powers that be. Because I&#039;m not questioning The Rules here, but but rather their completely erroneous application.<br /><br />To start with, when I logged on yesterday morning this is the first thing I saw:<br /><br />(http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v518/henducalma/astorians_scr.jpg)<br /><br />Cccording to that warning, this was the post that warranted the suspension &nbsp;(http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=9553.msg113660#msg113660) because it was &quot;personal, and name calling&quot;.<br /><br />Let&#039;s review The Rules, which can be read by clicking here (http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=8222) and here (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=9531.msg113857#msg113857)<br /><br />Specifically:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><ul class="bbc_list"><li>Write about posts, arguments, and positions, not members.</li><li>Avoid generalizations about and dismissive names for groups of people.</li></ul></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">- <strong>Don&#039;t make it personal:</strong> We do not permit ad hominem arguments or personal attacks.

If you feel the need to respond publicly don&#039;t make it personal (like &quot;hey you jerk, I&#039;m offended&quot;). Instead engage the person&#039;s idea and express your disagreement with it in a respectful way (I disagree with notion that... and this is why...).<br /><br />- <strong>No name calling:</strong> Don&#039;t call people names. Calling people names does no service to this community and it will not be tolerated - don&#039;t do it, even if &quot;the other person started it&quot;.

Note the use of the word &quot;it&quot;, a third-person neuter noun, as in &quot;It&#039;s trolling&quot; -- go back to the beginning of my statement and it&#039;s clear that I&#039;m referring to &quot;The &#039;Islamofacist&#039; thing&quot;, not FZ.<br /><br />There&#039;s absolutely no question that I was referring specifically -- and <em>only</em> -- to the post FZ made earlier in the thread; or, as The Rules state, one of FZ&#039;s &quot;posts, arguments, and positions&quot;.<br /><br />There was <strong>NO</strong> personal attack, there was <strong>NO</strong> name calling. Therefore, <strong>NO</strong> rule-breaking.<br /><br />I challenge Merm or whomever initiated the suspension based on the above to prove otherwise. If the post was reported by another user, I challenge them as well to state their reasons here. And if there was a report made to a moderator, I would&#039;ve hoped this person would have first brought it too my attention so I could have a chance to explain the post accordingly. <br /><br />I share with you all the particulars of this event because I wish everyone here to know exactly what transpired. Too often suspensions or other administrative sanctions are made without little or no public mention. It&#039;s just done and that it. Why is that? <br /><br />As for the others who apparently got suspended recently, I don&#039;t know what your particular alleged infraction was, but I invite you to share it here with the rest of us. I for one would like to know exactly how The Rules are being applied here, and in which instances.<br /><br />Moreover, I hope everyone who happens to get suspended -- whether they felt it justified or not -- chooses to provide the details for all of us to see. Not to point fingers or rehash board conflicts, but so we all are clearly informed about how, and in what manner, administrative rules are being applied to members.

				I&#039;ve made it perfectly clear I think that name calling (even if you&#039;re creative and cute about it or do it by &quot;proxy&quot;) will not be tolerated. Those comments would be inappropriate not only on the &quot;name calling&quot; premise, but because they are personally directed and inflammatory.<br /><br />I do see your point about parenting - but unfortunately when it comes to the discussion of politics I find that it encourages the most immature and childish behavior from some participants; which, coincidentally is the reason I started this thread in the first place.

				Just to play devil&#039;s advocate here, I recently saw someone else accuse a poster of hijacking the thread. &nbsp;Would this also get that poster suspended, as they are equating someone to a hijacker in the same way that ditmartian was equating someone with a troll?<br /><br />For the record, I don&#039;t think either of those examples should be grounds for suspension. &nbsp;I recognize that merm is the law in town on this board, but those examples are more like attempts at self moderation by board members than personal attacks.

				I think it&#039;s important to point out that when I suspend someone it&#039;s seldom for just one particular remark. Most of the time as I&#039;m reading a thread I see the discussion unfold and many times a person crosses the line several times (singling someone out, calling them a name, etc). I&#039;ll reference the final post that caused me to take action to suspend, but most of the time it&#039;s because I see a pattern of someone stepping over the lines more than once. Or sometimes it&#039;s through several threads, or even over several days with one user picking at another user. There are also cases where I&#039;ll get abusive PM&#039;s reported to me by someone, and later see a member who is baiting the other member in public. As you might imagine, I have little patience with these kinds of members (not saying that is or isn&#039;t the case this time.)<br /><br />Someone noting that the thread is going off topic or that the thread is being hijacked in terms of its topic isn&#039;t the same as singling someone out as a &quot;hijacker&quot; of threads for example. Even if someone is singled out I may not suspend the person if it&#039;s not part of an ongoing pattern.<br /><br />There are users on the board that thoughtfully criticize each others ideas while being respectful. Then there are users that just criticize and name call out of disrespect without forming any broader argument. In a gray area if a criticism is thoughtful and respectful I tend to not suspend, but might say something to someone in a PM (as I did yesterday for a couple members who did not get suspended). In cases where I see disrespect, or where comments are baiting or inflammatory it&#039;s different.

				Merm, I think that you&#039;re doing a great job with this board.&nbsp; I think that you&#039;ve managed to articulate your point extremely well, and if there are parties out there who want a forum in which they can bash one another without the threat of suspension, their best bet would be to create a politics message board separate from Astorians.

If it&#039;s really too difficult to figure out from this very long thread, and the overall tone and philosophy (if not the direct requirements) of the rules of the board, then I suppose we&#039;ll just have to figure it out by trial and error.<br /><br />There are many many people on this board that seem to have found that voice. They are able to respectfully engage each other, without resulting to insults, name calling, or dismissive adjectives, and they never show up on my radar. If you look around you&#039;ll see lots of these examples, and I suggest this as a good place to look. If after all that it&#039;s difficult to ascertain the tone and decorum of the site, then you may end up getting suspended once or twice - but at least you&#039;ll know what for, and hopefully from that point on you&#039;ll know what types of actions put you on a moderator&#039;s radar.<br /><br />Out of the 8,000+ people who visit the site monthly, only a few have trouble figuring out how to respectfully engage each other. If it eludes you, feel free to lurk for a while (which is a good idea anyway before jumping into a new online community) and see if it starts to make more sense.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=9507.msg114099.html#msg114099">Quote from: NYCMacUser on February 22, 2008, 03:24:46 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I might have accepted that if you had only added, &quot;in my opinion.&quot; Saying you are a &quot;broken record&quot; or &quot;trollish&quot; is just as justified as an opinion as any other opinion.

				Something just occurred to me. I remember when I was a little girl, if I burped during a meal my mother would glare at me. She considered doing that in public unacceptable and disrespectful. As a young woman I learned that in some cultures, not only was it acceptable, but a flattering thing to do.<br /><br />Is the perception of disrespectful and/or dismissive a regional thing? This IS NYC. Things here are quite different than in the rest of the country—or for that matter, the rest of the world—so I am wondering if us natives hear things differently than you transplants.

If you were to put some of the more aggressive members of the board all in a room together face to face I think you&#039;d find they would have a civil discussion where no moderator was needed. But for some, the anonymity provided by the internet frees them to be less respectful and more dismissive of others ideas. People choose different words offline I find.<br /><br />I find a similar effect at play on the freeway. There&#039;s something about being behind 1/4 inch of steel and glass that can make the silliest thing seem like a really big deal and prompt people to act very immaturely (i.e. road rage, honking their horn for minutes on end etc). You just don&#039;t frequently see that kind of thing in person as much (it does happen - just infrequently, even in NYC).<br /><br />Then again, maybe I just proved your point that we see the problem differently because we&#039;re not from the same place. :)

				merm, your idea of moderation is clearly different from a lot of people&#039;s. It&#039;s a fair difference, but I think a lot of us would prefer it if the offending posts were deleted and warnings were posted, instead of silently banning/suspending people and leaving the guilty post up for all to see. Could you explain your rationale for doing it that way? The former method allows people the chance to step back and go &quot;Yeah, I guess that was out of line&quot; rather than getting even more irritated that they can&#039;t even log in to explain themselves, and that they weren&#039;t given a warning that they&#039;re out of line. People who aren&#039;t trolling do tend to come around when given the chance. Suspending people is not a warning anymore than receiving a speeding ticket isn&#039;t a warning. A warning is to let people continue on their way while letting them know they&#039;re out of line and shouldn&#039;t do it again.<br /><br />No matter how clear you think the rules are, what constitutes as inflammatory and insulting is highly subjective. We&#039;ve lost some decent people here because of the insta-ban method of moderation. It feels very un-community-like when people who&#039;ve been helpful and contributing members of the forum for a long time are suddenly banned because of one or two unfortunate posts.

				What I find unfortunate is that this problem really only exists within the topic of politics (with a few exceptions). Most of the other topics on the board are discussed rationally and there&#039;s seldom the need for any moderation at all. But when it comes to politics the discussion can very quickly become heated and the conversation is derailed.<br /><br />If I were to delete offending posts I know there would be those who would protest that as well (a great example of that is in this very thread). It also creates additional complications around the issue of censorship, and it lets people who make abusive or hateful comments hide behind the veil of a moderator&#039;s delete key. It&#039;s a valid approach, but it does have its own set of complications.<br /><br />You are right, we have lost a few members because they threw big fits over being suspended for 24h or something equally as silly, but only a few. We&#039;ve lost far more members (although still relatively few compared to the entire member base admittedly) because they&#039;ve been insulted or abused by other members on the board. And of those who has left (for whatever reason), most often it has been because of political discussions that have gotten out of hand.<br /><br />Another approach would be to suspend or warn people publicly (as you&#039;ve pointed out), so that everyone can benefit from seeing what is and what is not crossing the line - but this too creates problems as it can humiliate the person who gets suspended. I know because I&#039;ve tried this, and I agreed with the criticism that it can be humiliating. It&#039;s admittedly a very good way for people to learn what is appropriate and inappropriate behavior, but there&#039;s a cost.<br /><br />The bottom line is that <em>any</em> action that a moderator takes that suggests someone is out of line is often met by a challenge and excuses (not always), even when we do nothing but send a PM pointing out an area where someone has crossed the line. Many people are unable to see or admit where they&#039;ve created a problem, even where it&#039;s obvious. After four years of running this site, I can say I&#039;ve tried a lot of different moderation styles with different members and while it&#039;s a great idea to think that I can be a kind of benevolent administrator that comes behind and reads every post and gently reminds people when they get close to crossing the line, it just doesn&#039;t seem to work that way I&#039;ve found (to be fair, I used to think this was possible.) All this being said, I don&#039;t think my moderation style is that different than you&#039;d see on other successful moderate to large sized discussion forums on the net.

				I&#039;ve been reading the posts with interest. While I&#039;m not for censorship, and don&#039;t even like when the threads get locked, the bottom line is, I&#039;m not the one putting all the work into this site. I see the frustration in some of the moderation of the site, but I guess I take it for what it is, take what I want from the site, and try and follow the rules. I don&#039;t think that you can completely take out politics from astorians.com. It isn&#039;t astoria.com, it is astorians.com, and astorians are people with varying political views. <br /><br />But as it isn&#039;t my site, and one of the moderators chooses to give a warning through a 24hr suspension, i&#039;ll take my political discussion elsewhere. To be honest, I have. <br /><br />In fairness to Merm, the suspension appears to be after several violations and following a consistent pattern of behavior. I blatantly called someone an &quot;ass&quot; several months ago, but no suspension. It isn&#039;t my pattern of behavior. And although the moderators do have subjective perspectives on what warrants a suspension, doesn&#039;t seem too &#039;big brother&#039; to me.<br /><br />I just wanted to weigh in, a little jealous I don&#039;t have a really strong opinion of this, other than, it looks like the discussion is getting ridiculous, and not going much further.

I think there are a number of threads where a single member gets called out on behavior by the group and is not treated fairly, but it seems that because of a group mentality, it is rare for these discussions to get the attention that the political threads do.<br /><br />Specifically, the Oleput threads on the board. While pink_floyd may not have been the most courteous in the discussion, there were certainly other members criticizing him as an individual. While I&#039;m not saying that this was intentionally unpunished, there does seem to be a bias as to who is okay to personally attack and who is not.<br /><br />There seems to be a large drive toward a status quo here and it can often be difficult to defend an opinion here that is not in the majority. This is, of course, always the case, but it seems like reactions to the politics sections are more severe than the other parts of the board, regardless of the mood of those involved. I can only speak for myself, but when a member attacks a blanket point of view and I tell them that I believe their criticism is biased and invalid and this is the action that puts me under suspension, I can&#039;t help but feel like the cards are stacked against me because of an unpopular opinion. If critique of viewpoints is not desired, where does discussion go? How do we draw the line between a person and their beliefs without forming a majority rule kind of &quot;groupthink&quot;?<br /><br />I&#039;m thankful for the board and I understand where my comments could be viewed as offensive, but they certainly were not ad hominem arguments. If the general definition of ad hominem does not cover the range of posts that should be banned, a more comprehensive definition, in my opinion, is required to be clear and avoid the suppression of minority opinions.

So while it may feel that there&#039;s a bias against certain views I can testify that this is not the case.<br /><br />Even if someone feels their views are frequently misrepresented and misunderstood it still doesn&#039;t give license to get personal in criticisms. I think it&#039;s fair to say that the common theme in the problematic politics threads are that respect for others breaks down and people start to lose focus on engaging ideas and move into blind criticism of other members and their ideas. That&#039;s when the discussion becomes unproductive, and that&#039;s when I start seeing reports coming into the moderators&#039; queue.

				I think if this were just a site where we were talking about national sports or weather it would be a different thing. But because this site focuses on our little neighborhood I think the feel of the conversation is different. I always liken the conversation to one that I&#039;d like to take place in a cafe - but that&#039;s not possible because of the difference in everyone&#039;s schedules and tastes.<br /><br />Since we all actually live together in the same neighborhood, and see each other on the street/subway I think it takes an extra effort on all our part to respect each other and keep the discussion civil. The purpose of this site is to create a broad, positive, and constructive dialog about Astoria. Diversity of views is completely welcome, but snide and dismissive remarks are not. It&#039;s just that simple.<br /><br />I do realize there are a lot of boards out there where people can hide behind the anonymity of the internet and disrespect each other in ways that they&#039;d not ever normally do in person - this is not one of those places. I&#039;m a strong believer in what goes around comes around - and my goal for this site is to create an honest and respectful dialog within our real, physical, geographical community.<br /><br />If you&#039;re looking to debate politics, and you want to tell people off, please join one of the other thousands of sites that serve that purpose. But it is my belief that when a conversation degrades into people likening each other to Nazis, or terrorist supporters, or bigots, or broken-records, or fascists, etc - that the conversation is no longer helpful to the community in which we live.<br /><br />I believe the success of this site, and the role in the neighborhood is precisely because I&#039;ve (we&#039;ve) tried to keep the dialog civil - and I have no plan of changing that. So - if it detracts from the site (and admittedly it does, I do see negatives in this approach and I realize this isn&#039;t a clear cut issue) so be it because I think the approach here creates a far more positive effect on the community dialog as a whole. And I think our site growth over 4 years speaks to it.<br /><br />But, there are lots of other venues on the internet for people to have conversations that are more in line with what they&#039;re looking for. For many people Astorians can&#039;t be your be-all end-all discussion site (it&#039;s not for me), so I hope that for those that aren&#039;t happy they can supplement their forum experience with other sites - there are even other sites that cover Queens. And we are talking about the internet here, if it&#039;s that bad here maybe it&#039;s time for another Astoria-centered site to start up that&#039;s run differently. I welcome all these ideas.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=9507.msg114207.html#msg114207">Quote from: Handyman on February 23, 2008, 09:00:51 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What happened to the &quot;rants&quot; section?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s there. :)

We don&#039;t always contact the the person who reported though. Sorry if it feels like the report goes into a black hole - it doesn&#039;t.

				Sorry for the three posts. I have a proposal that has come out of this very long and interesting discussion we&#039;ve been having.<br /><br />1. Break &quot;politics&quot; into it&#039;s own subcategory, and place it under random-gabble. I think this is a good idea because most of the general political stuff that&#039;s posted isn&#039;t related to Astoria anyway, and random gabble is for both local and non-related stuff.<br /><br />2. &quot;Rants&quot; will be added to random gabble (Random Gabble &amp; Rants?). I think this could work because some rants are not specifically Astoria related, and because I think they could work together.<br /><br />3. A new section called something like Community Activism and Issues would be created (as an experiment) that would focus on local issues and challenges we face as a community, and be a place for discussion of how to make Astoria better through activism.<br /><br />I think that having a section dedicated specifically to serious, local issues would be a good thing whereas now all politics (even local) is grouped together with &quot;rants&quot; which I don&#039;t think does it justice.

				For starters I&#039;ve:<br /><br />- Moved politics into its own section under random gabble<br />- Expanded random gabble to include &quot;ranty&quot; topics.<br />- Expanded &quot;local chat&quot; to now include &quot;local issues&quot;. Local politics should also be discussed there when it comes up.<br />- Expanded Community groups to include &quot;Activism&quot;. Community organizing should happen in that forum.

				Just a couple of thoughts - <br /><br />As we go into a National election, the Polictics section should get very interesting, and I am certain that our discussions can enlighten some folks.&nbsp; I have learned so much from the intelligent people on this board.<br /><br />Secondly, although Billz and I have differing views, when I was at Oleput yesterday for a coffee, I looked around to see if he was there so that I could say hello.&nbsp; He and I have &#039;been at it&#039; several times, but it would still be a pleasure to meet him!&nbsp; I respect his point of view and this board has helped me to broaden my point of view.

				merm, now that my &quot;Vallone Letter in Metro&quot; thread has been moved way out of the way of anything having to do with Astoria, I would like to know why it was moved out of the Astoria-based category I posted it in. Moving &quot;Politics&quot; to the off-topic category is a fair solution, but I&#039;ve expressed being unhappy about that thread being moved, and you haven&#039;t offered any kind of explanation. Now that the local chat includes &quot;Issues&quot; can it be moved back there?

You can still see it from the main page, but it&#039;s also separated from the &quot;Rants&quot; section, which I like. The way it was before implied that politics and rants went hand in hand, but now politics is merely an off-topic category. I&#039;m glad it has its own category in the off-topic section, and I think that&#039;s where it belongs. The people who are interested in discussing political issues, myself included, know where to find it.
