			Greetings<br /><br />I'm Jennifer - age - I forget more and more frequently (truly) but I believe that it's 36 this month. &nbsp;Just got married two months ago &nbsp;to Jonathan (who is floating around here somewhere). &nbsp;I've been in Astoria almost 3 years after moving back east from 10 years in Seattle - originally I'm from CT. &nbsp;<br /><br />I teach math at the all girls public school in East Harlem - which means I've got a lot of time for slacking, reading, riding my bike, making a domestic mess and gettting into trouble for the next couple of months. &nbsp;<br /><br />Hope to meet one or two of you in the near future. <br /><br />Jen

			I'm impressed! I don't this we'd get quite this response on Craig's List forums. Yay!

			Okay. My turn I guess.<br /><br />My name is Samantha and I am mrm's wife. I'm 27 even though I look like I am still in high school.<br /><br />As he said we've been in the NYC area since 2001, and we've lived in Astoria since 2002. Before that we were in CA in college, but I am actually from Tennessee.<br /><br />Anyway, since being in NYC I have interned, freelanced as a web and graphic designer, temped, and am now currently wrapping up my receptionist job at a rare stringed instruments dealer in Manhattan. In just a few days I'll be starting a great new job at a non-profit (thankfully NOT a receptionist job!), also in Manhattan.<br /><br />I love to read - you'll see me doing that every day on the subway. I am currently reading a book about a forensic anthropologist. I enjoy computers (yes, I have been known to be a gamer), cooking, uncooking (currently a rawfoodist until I decide otherwise), writing, and watching TV...sometimes too much TV. Current favorites are Alias, Charmed, The Office (the US version), The Daily Show w/ Jon Stewart, and Desperate Housewives (of course).<br /><br />And Pixel is my cat, too. And in my humble opinion he's perfect even if he doesn't have the whole toilet thing down.

			It is really great to read all these replies! &nbsp;Nice to know a little bit about all of you (I lurked for a week or so before I spoke up) and learn of your love and appreciation for Astoria. &nbsp; I will definitely make a point to visit the Freeze Peach and maybe even join some of you for a game of Trivial Pursuit (ladywithpans?). &nbsp;I am also a TV watcher (also love Alias and Charmed, the Daily Show and Desperate Housewives) and movie fan. &nbsp;On that topic, what can you say about Time Warner and Road Runner? &nbsp;I will need a highspeed connection once I move in. &nbsp;<br /><br />Sam, where did you go to college in CA? &nbsp;And my housemate is from Tennesee! &nbsp;Small world. &nbsp;I also have a cat, Marina. &nbsp;There are pictures of her on my flickr account, which you can access from my profile. &nbsp;She is the best cat ever (but I am biased!).<br /><br />Since all of you have shared your ages, I will with mine: &nbsp;I am 36 but will turn 37 on Saturday. A happy birthday should go to Joey, fellow moon child. &nbsp;ladywithpans, what did you study at SUNYSB? &nbsp;Robyn, your tea sounds delish. &nbsp;I have been exploring tea this year and find it a nice alternative to coffee. &nbsp;But don't get me wrong, I love the coffee, especially if it is strong.<br /><br />I can't wait to move! &nbsp;The packing is a bummer, though.

			I was an English major at SUSB, and when I read classic literature now, I wonder why I've laid it by for so long.
