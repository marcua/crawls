				Maltitol is one of the sugar alcohols (total misnomer, as it is neither a sugar nor an alcohol) that has become popular in low carb diets to replace sugar.<br /><br />The theory behind it is that sugar alcohols are only partially absorbed by the body, reducing the standard caloric effect of 4 calories per carbohydrate gram. &nbsp;Each sugar alcohol is different, and each person has a different rate of absorption.<br /><br />Here (http://wilstar.com/lowcarb/sugaralcohols.htm) is a page listing the various sugar alcohols, and their respective theoretical caloric effect.<br /><br />Maltitol is, from what I have seen, the most common one used. &nbsp;It's deadly for me. &nbsp;I once grabbed a small candy bar not realising that the sweetener was a sugar alcohol, specifically maltitol. &nbsp;The resulting rumbling and general intestinal distress was most unpleasant, despite the fact that what I ate was one serving, which contained 14g maltitol. &nbsp;The only way to determine your own tolerance level is to try it. &nbsp;I can tolerate about 5g sugar alcohol before it starts bothering me. &nbsp;This is exceedingly low.<br /><br />Also, my own personal theory is that the less you absorb it, the more intestinal distress you will have. &nbsp;The more you absorb it, the less trouble you have. &nbsp;Thus, any benefits of having a &quot;sugar-free&quot; candy are largely negated, particularly if it's calories you are trying to avoid.<br /><br />My recommendation is to stick to small quantities of real, dark chocolate. &nbsp;Lindt 85% is an excellent choice.

				Dagoba has a very distinctive flavour that can take a little getting used to, but I do like it.<br /><br />Yes, I have conducted chocolate tastings. &nbsp;No, we are not surprised.<br /><br />(Meg, is it specifically sugar that you are trying to avoid? &nbsp;Or calories? &nbsp;Or are you just curious because someone gave you the bar?)

				I'd eat it. And if I liked it I'd probably easily polish the whole bar in an afternoon feeling no guilt.
