				Glad to hear. Some people were asking, so I&#039;ll be happy to be armed with info on that.<br /><br /><br />I hope that the renovations include an actual sign outside that tells people the name of your store as opposed to just a door decal. I find it to be a little unwelcoming without one.

Philo-Junius, I am always at the restaurant.&nbsp; When I reopen, introduce yourself to me.

				Does no one else remember that it took over a year for Sugar Freak to open in the first place?&nbsp; This was even after they had put up signage and blocked their windows with fancy drapes.&nbsp; If there&#039;s a renovation, I put it six months out before they reopen.&nbsp; Like New Years.<br /><br /><br />Personally, I always found the food top notch, even if the jumbalaya was too spicey, the bloody Mary&#039;s made up for it.&nbsp; Hope they are on track to bring Creole back to the hood.

				why is everyone assuming the worst?&nbsp; Seriously:&nbsp; CALM DOWN.&nbsp; Construction of commercial spaces in this bureaucratic mess of a city is complicated and nightmarish.<br /><br /><br />The owner has chimed in SEVERAL TIMES saying that she is planning on opening - why would she lie?&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I think it&#039;s great that she&#039;s expanding!&nbsp; Regardless of whether or not you like the food we should all celebrate when someone is successful - especially when it&#039;s a small business owner in a city that is slowly being taken over by chains and big corp.<br /><br /><br />Chill on the hatin&#039; - just chill.

				Hours after opening, I stopped in to sample the new SugarFreak! I got to meet Michele and was pleasantly surprised. It became packed in a hurry. <br /><br /><br />We sat at the bar and ordered some food. I admit to being a few drinks deep already and didn&#039;t get to enjoy the selection of beverages. I ordered the recommended fried chicken with a side of grilled corn on the cob, and it was delicious. At first I thought it was a bit on the pricey side, but it&#039;s a very large portion (I took most of it home...stomach was too filled with beer from Hallet haha). <br /><br /><br />I like the way it looks inside (great bathrooms), and I look forward to going back to try out other menu items when I am a bit more sober. <br /><br /><br />Congrats to the gang in there. :)

				The new menu is enormous, but thankfully the food is still very good.&nbsp; (And the Sazeracs are still $8, though they only filled the rocks glass halfway.)&nbsp; Red beans and rice have a nice flavor without being too spicy or salty, and it comes with a a split, grilled half a sausage on the side (in addition to the sausage on the plate).&nbsp; I also enjoyed the creamy maque choux side, sort of a NOLA version of succotash. <br /><br />Our waiter told us it would be another couple of months before the sweets place opens.
