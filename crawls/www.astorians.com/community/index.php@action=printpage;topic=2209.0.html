Fight By PATRICK HEALY <br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/23/nyregion/23cnd-faso.html?hp&amp;ex=1148443200&amp; en=37c3c2c532e3b9e4&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage<br /><br />&nbsp;The New York Conservative Party endorsed John Faso as its nominee for governor this afternoon, setting up a fierce political fight within the far-larger Republican Party. <br />Mr. Faso, a fiscal conservative who opposes abortion, is competing for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, against William F. Weld, a former governor of Massachusetts and committed tax-cutter who supports abortion rights.<br />The election-year convention of the Conservative Party, meeting in midtown Manhattan, also received a swan-song visit from the outgoing Republican governor, George E. Pataki. He received a standing ovation, though the applause were modest, given that many conservatives in the room have said that he has not done enough to cut state spending, reduce the debt burden and drive down taxes further.<br />Audience members applauded when Mr. Pataki cited his &quot;conservative policies&quot; of fighting crime, but not even the Conservative Party chairman, Michael R. Long, put his hands together when Mr. Pataki credited himself as fiscal conservative who lowered taxes and fought spending. Mr. Pataki is considering a bid for the White House in 2008, and his advisers say he would like to run in the mold of a fiscally conservative, socially moderate Republican. <br />Mr. Faso, a former Republican leader in the state Assembly, pledged to cut taxes and state spending as governor, and repeated his warnings that the leading Democratic candidate, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, has not categorically ruled out raising any taxes. Mr. Faso argued that the tax burden weighed too heavily on New Yorkers, particularly the middle class, and he delighted the conservatives by promising to be a fiscal watchdog. <br />&quot;You should not be considered wealthy if you are a married couple and earn $40,000 a year, yet that is the situation in this state today,&quot; Mr. Faso said. <br />Mr. Faso said his first action as governor would be to draft &quot;a responsible state budget that includes the reforms and spending restraint to provide the much-needed tax relief to families and businesses.&quot; <br />Mr. Faso has been picking up endorsements from Republican county leaders at a rapid clip lately, including in such vote-rich counties as Westchester and Suffolk. Yet Mr. Weld enjoys support from leaders of the state party apparatus — including, privately, Mr. Pataki — and he started off ahead of Mr. Faso in fund-raising. Mr. Weld&#39;s advisers still contend that their candidate is taking in more donations, but campaign finance reports will not be made public until July. <br />No Republican has won statewide office in three decades without the joint endorsement of the Conservative Party. Ryan Moses, the executive director of the state Republican Party, who attended the Conservative Party conclave, said that while the two parties like to act as political partners, Republicans would pick candidates according to the wishes of their members and not the 155,000 or so members of the Conservative Party. <br />&quot;I think John Faso has had tremendous conservative support all along, and I don&#39;t think any Republican out there was thinking that this day would be any difference,&quot; Mr. Moses said of the nomination. &quot;We could partner in three or four races this year. But we have to support the ideals and the people who best represent the party&#39;s needs and interests.&quot; <br /><br />As expected, the Conservatives also nominated John Spencer, the former mayor of Yonkers, to challenge Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton; Jeanine F. Pirro, the former district attorney of Westchester County, as its candidate for attorney general; and C. Scott Vanderhoef, the Rockland County executive, as lieutenant governor. <br /><br />[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]

				&nbsp;:evil:<br />( we have a devil smily but no angelic ...&nbsp; 8-) )&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />Spencer: GOP primary ``death sentence&#39;&#39; in chance to unseat Clinton<br /><br />By MARC HUMBERT<br />AP Political Writer<br />http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newyork/ny-bc-ny--senaterace0524may24<br />,0,7531150.story?coll=ny-region-apnewyork<br /><br />May 24, 2006, 12:16 PM EDT<br /><br />ALBANY, N.Y. -- A Republican primary to pick a challenger to Sen. Hillary<br />Rodham Clinton&#39;s re-election bid this year would be &quot;a death sentence&quot; for<br />the GOP effort to unseat her, one of the top contenders for the party&#39;s<br />nomination said Wednesday.<br /><br />John Spencer, the conservative former Yonkers mayor, said that while a case<br />can sometimes be made that a primary is good for a campaign effort, this was<br />not one of those times.<br /><br />&quot;This is one of the classic cases where a primary is a death sentence and<br />quite a benefit to Senator Clinton and Senator Clinton only,&quot; Spencer told<br />The Associated Press.<br /><br />The former mayor is facing a possible GOP Senate primary against Kathleen<br />Troia &quot;KT&quot; McFarland, a political novice who was a Reagan-era Pentagon<br />official and has been out of government since 1985.<br /><br />Statewide polls have shown Clinton with better than 2-1 leads over both<br />Spencer and McFarland.<br /><br />Spencer&#39;s statement comes less than a week before the state GOP convention<br />at which delegates will decide if McFarland wins at least 25 percent of the<br />weighted vote to force a September primary. Failing that, McFarland, the<br />wife of a wealthy Wall Street investment banker, could seek the petition<br />signatures of at least 15,000 Republicans to get on the primary ballot.<br /><br />Told of Spencer&#39;s comments, McFarland suggested that perhaps the former<br />mayor should bow out of the race.<br /><br />&quot;If Mr. Spencer wishes to step aside so I can challenge Mrs. Clinton<br />woman-to-woman, I would be very grateful. I would consider it a true gesture<br />of chivalry,&quot; said McFarland. &quot;In the absence of that, he can expect a<br />healthy and energetic primary. Let the voters decide, I say.&quot;<br /><br />Spencer made it clear he felt it was McFarland who should exit the race,<br />saying he would seek to convince Republican delegates that his snaring of<br />the state Conservative Party endorsement on Tuesday at that party&#39;s state<br />convention made him the obvious choice to face Clinton. No Republican<br />running statewide in New York has won without Conservative Party backing<br />since 1974.<br /><br />&quot;The idea of a primary is mindless,&quot; Spencer told the AP, noting that<br />Clinton &quot;stands alone with all that money.&quot;<br /><br />Clinton, the front-runner among potential candidates for the Democrats&#39; 2008<br />presidential nomination, reported last month she had almost $20 million in<br />her Senate campaign account. Spencer reported having $340,000 on hand while<br />McFarland said she had $430,000.<br /><br />&quot;If Mr. Spencer is this pessimistic about his chances, it&#39;s not surprising<br />that voters feel similarly,&quot; said Clinton adviser Howard Wolfson when told<br />about Spencer&#39;s no-primary wishes.<br /><br />Spencer said Wednesday he already is &quot;in the high 60s&quot; for a percentage of<br />the GOP convention vote next week. He has the backing of state GOP Chairman<br />Stephen Minarik.<br /><br />On Tuesday, McFarland told the AP that she was &quot;comfortably&quot; above the 25<br />percent convention vote threshold needed to force a GOP Senate primary.<br />
