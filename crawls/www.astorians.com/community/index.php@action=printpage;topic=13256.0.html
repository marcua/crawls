				I just went to the nyc health dept. website and looked up the health inspection results for our local restaurants. Not good at all. I wish I would have remained blissfully ignorant.

				Oops - I did this too!&nbsp; I stopped after 2 restaurants, because I didn&#039;t want to know anything else.&nbsp; I worked in the restaurant industry for several years, and sometimes you see things you wish you would not have, although the opposite applies as well - the last restaurant I worked at was kept meticulously clean, and I really was almost surprised to have never seen any flora or fauna there that wasn&#039;t meant for consumption.&nbsp; You never know what you are in for until you peek in the kitchen/prep areas.

				I did it too and found out that a restaurant I used to eat at fairly frequently about a year ago had scored over 140 violation points. YUCK.<br />

				Don&#039;t drive yourselves too crazy!! My best friend from high school is a health inspector. She once counted three flies buzzing around in her kitchen and said, &quot;I just failed my own test- that&#039;s a couple points,&quot; something to that effect.<br /><br />Points can be given for not having boxes of food three inches off the floor in the freezer, or being a few degrees off while cooked. In other words, it doesn&#039;t necessarily mean anything truly awful.

				Unfortunately, it lists why it failed and where the points come from and a lot of local restaurants I eat at regularly have roach and mice problems in the food areas. Gross. I just ruined 5 restaurants I used to eat at.&nbsp; :cry:

				Having watched Andrew Zimern&#039;s (sp?) show for a while now, bugs no longer turn me off too much.&nbsp; Believe me, they are EVERYWHERE!&nbsp; There must be a handful of restaurants without a critter problem.

				Yeah, bugs aren&#039;t as offensive as people&#039;s bodily fluids. They say if the bathroom&#039;s clean the kitchen usually is, but I don&#039;t know. I get creeped out when the bathrooms don&#039;t have soap or toilet paper or hot water-that&#039;s definitely a red flag for me when I check the restaurant inspection website. Wouldn&#039;t want the kitchen staff&#039;s hands all over my food then.
