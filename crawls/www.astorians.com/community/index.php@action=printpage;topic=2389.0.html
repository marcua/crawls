				I&#39;m a 21/F who goes to SUNY Stony Brook, but is home in Astoria for the summer and I need a job, lol.&nbsp; I&#39;ve tried everything from craigslist.com to monster.com, to word or mouth and so far nothing.&nbsp; Everything else I find is either looking for a college grad, or full-time, not seasonal.&nbsp; I have experience doing clerical work, food service, and working with kids (ages 3-5).&nbsp; I&#39;ve sent out my resume and been looking for a few weeks now, so I&#39;m getting desperate, lol.&nbsp; If anybody is looking or has heard of anything (even outside Astoria), I&#39;d completly appriciate it! <br /><br />Thankx!<br />Anna&nbsp;

				I would suggest temping. While it isn&#39;t an entirely stable way of work it does allow for more flexibility on your schedule. <br /><br />Otherwise, not sure where else you should look. Perhaps the Village Voice classifieds? Or if you are interested in non-profit work try Idealist - www.idealist.org. But always, always keep looking at craigslist.

				My school is running a 3 week camp at its East Harlem location.&nbsp; We need someone to be the adult on the camp bus to and from queens each day.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know if the kids are all getting picked up at one spot - or if the bus rides around and picks them up at various locations.&nbsp; Once you&#39;re at camp I&quot;m sure there would be work that they have for you to do but I don&#39;t know what it is.&nbsp; &nbsp;(Okay I&#39;m not that infomative but the director said last week &quot;WE NEED SOMEONE BADLY!!! WHO DO YOU KNOW??)<br /><br />The campers arer all girls going into 8th - 10th grade.&nbsp; &nbsp;(so you wouldn&#39;t be dealing with the camp bus stuff of movies&nbsp; :-))<br /><br />if you&#39;re interested let me know and I can get some more information.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have no idea what it pays.

				A lot of the summer camps in the schools are being ran by Sports and Arts in the Schools foundation.&nbsp; The website about hiring is:&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.sasfny.org/jobs.htm<br /><br />You can try www.snagajob.com <br />It has local retail jobs.&nbsp; <br /><br />
