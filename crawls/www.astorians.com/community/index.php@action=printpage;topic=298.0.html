				Reverend Billy Pledges Year-Long, World-Record-Setting Exorcism of Illegal &quot;Studyhall&quot; Starbucks<br /><br />Following their 8pm revival show on Wednesday February 23rd at St. Mark's Church, The Stop Shopping Gospel Choir and Reverend Billy will march to the Cooper Union Starbucks at 4th Avenue and St. Mark's Place. They will announce their intent to place in the Guinness Book of World Records for longest EVICTION OF THE DEVIL FROM THE BODY OF AN INNOCENT VICTIM. The Church and congregation will roust the demonic sweatshop bean, aka Starbucks, from the so called &quot;study hall&quot; with gospel shouts and incantations from across the land. <br /><br />Supernatural efforts will begin immediately after the St. Mark's Church revival concludes at approximately 9:45pm. Round-the-clock, high-pitched cursings, reciting medieval texts, anti-hypnosis solutions, and singing The Rhyme of the Busty Mermaid are just a few of the &quot;tricks&quot; The Church of Stop Shopping has up its &quot;sleeve.&quot; <br /><br />In the mid 1990's a corrupt agreement between Rudy Giuliani's administration and Cooper Union made possible the third Starbucks on the Astor Place intersection. Originally, the land was leased by the city to the college rent-free in perpetuity, with the stipulation the college use it for &quot;educational purposes only.&quot; Giuliani and Cooper Union achieved classic, Orwellian doublespeak in deeming a transnational coffee shop &quot;educational.&quot; If Starbucks is a study hall Reverend Billy is a fake preacher!!! <br /><br />Pushback Starbucks!<br />Reverend Billy and The Stop Shopping Gospel Choir<br />This Wednesday February 23<br />St Marks Church, East 10th and 2nd ave, 8 pm<br />$10 reserve@revbilly.com for reservations

				We have a show and an exorcism the last wednesday of each month!!! &nbsp;It is really a panic. For anyone who finds themselves depressed and down about politics as well as corporate intrusion on community landscapes and our brains. &nbsp;We are serious about the issues but also give people an experience where they can comes together to laugh at the absurdity of it all.<br /><br />COME AND SAVE YOURSELVES FROM THE SHOPOCALYPSE!!!
