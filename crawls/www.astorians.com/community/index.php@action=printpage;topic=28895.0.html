				The other day I walked past what used to be Don Coqui on 31st right under the Ditmars train station and saw that it is now going to be called Jimmy&#039;s Puerto Rican Food or something like that.&nbsp; I wonder why they changed the name before they even opened.&nbsp; It seems strange to me

				We ate at Jimmy&#039;s last night and were very glad we did.&nbsp; The food is excellent.&nbsp; The shrimp bisque was incredible and filled with tender shrimp.&nbsp; My red snapper was a thick filet and cooked perfectly and served with crispy tostones with no trace of grease whatsoever.&nbsp; Jimmy Rodriquez is the founder of the Don Coqui family of restaurants.&nbsp; One or more are named &quot;Jimmy&#039;s&quot; in one way or another.&nbsp; It was smarter here until the &quot;unofficial&quot; Don Coqui on Newtown changes its name.&nbsp; From what I understand, that formal business relationship is over, so the one on Newtown should not be using the Don Coqui brand.&nbsp; They did a nice job with the Jimmy&#039;s space near Ditmars.&nbsp; It&#039;s a stylized like a lounge, but I was told the focus is going to be food and not so much music and dancing.&nbsp; If the food remains as delicious as it was last night, this place will be a hit.

				Unfortunately they are not online just yet. They advertise a website but it&#039;s either wrong or not live yet.&nbsp; My Red Snapper entrée was $21 and I thought that was very fair.&nbsp; It was a very fresh filet and plentiful.&nbsp; Delicious preparation.&nbsp; A large portion by anyone&#039;s standards.&nbsp; My wife had their house chicken soup for $5 that was like a meal in itself. I think it&#039;s a good value for the quality.&nbsp; They have take-out menus if you go by one day.

				FYI, the original Don Coqui in Astoria is at the old Zodiac place, on the 30th Ave stop?&nbsp; or is it Don Q?&nbsp; Anyone remember that place? This new place has live band/music on certain days/time.&nbsp; The old Zodiac also had a live music.&nbsp; Menu consisted of Greek food.&nbsp; It was very good.<br /><br /><br />Ciao ~

				I was there again for a little while this past Friday night.&nbsp; The atmosphere definitely is a little off.&nbsp; The mood lighting (LED) feels too clubby or sci fi for sitting and having a relaxing drink.&nbsp; Maybe it can be toned down a bit.&nbsp; It&#039;s very cold (blues and pinks) and distorts the look of the food, the drinks, and the people.&nbsp; The TVs show sports and maybe TV programs from Puerto Rico.&nbsp; Not sure but I think they&#039;re muted and are there just for the added affect.&nbsp; It&#039;s not necessary and can be annoying.&nbsp; There is music, and I think it&#039;s pretty good, and just the right volume.&nbsp; They&#039;re not really getting people inside so easily. I wonder if they&#039;ll make it.&nbsp; I think they&#039;re hurting due to the atmosphere more than anything else.&nbsp; The people there are very kind and hospitable and the food is delicious.

Maybe that will attract more customers.&nbsp; Right now the things on the menu are kind of expensive and only for dinner.&nbsp; When I eat at a restaurant I like there to be enough lighting to see my food.&nbsp; I&#039;m not planning on eating there unless they get a lunch menu or if someone treats me to dinner.

				I saw that they now have big white lettering on the entrance that says Happy Hour.&nbsp; Now it looks more like a bar than a restaurant.&nbsp; I guess they think this will attract customers.&nbsp; I agree with someone who mentioned that the lighting inside makes it look like a lounge/bar instead of a restaurant.&nbsp; Maybe they should change that if they want to attract customers for dinner.

				Another one bites the dust.&nbsp; Drove by yesterday and saw the place empty.&nbsp; All tables, chairs - gone.&nbsp; They were cleaning up.<br /><br /><br />It would be nice if they open up a Greek restaurant in that area.&nbsp; No more coffee house.&nbsp; We have enough of them!

				&nbsp;:cheesy: hi Braun ~ I absolutely knew you would be the first to respond !!&nbsp; I remember when the Greek restaurant was there, I ate there a few times and it wasn&#039;t bad at all !<br /><br /><br />Who knows?&nbsp; Perhaps they will re-vamp it.&nbsp; A fast food Puerto Rican/spanish place would probably work better.&nbsp; Don&#039;t think making it a bar would help ... they attempted that and obviously it didn&#039;t work.<br /><br /><br />We&#039;ll see.
