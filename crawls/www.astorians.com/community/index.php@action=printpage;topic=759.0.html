				I used to work as a freelance web and graphic designer a couple of years ago, but since working full-time in Manhattan I decided to take a break from it.<br /><br />Well, now that my husband and I are getting rid of our television I'll have more &quot;time&quot; (like I didn't already) to do other things. It would also be nice to have the extra cash.<br /><br />I am not looking into taking on big projects or projects that require ongoing maintenance. Preferably you'll have a way to update your site yourself.<br /><br />I am experienced in Dreamweaver, Photoshop, HTML, basic CSS, among other things. My day-job is working in the online services division of a very large and well-known non-profit, so I am utilizing my web skills on a daily basis.<br /><br />Usual timeline:<br /><br />- First contact (no not the movie :) ) - e-mail or PM from you, I'd give you more info based upon your inquiry.<br />- Face-to-face meeting if necessary, preferably in the Astoria-area (Freeze Peach would be best locale for me).<br />- Contract - I'd write up a contract detailing costs and what I will and won't do (basically a good way to protect myself and you - while this can be deemed legalistic, it can save us from some real headaches); you'd look contract over and decide if it is satisfactory - if so you'd send/give me a signed copy.<br />- Upon receipt of contract I'd begin working on design of website - I'd come up with approximately three different designs for you to choose from. If you had any images you wanted me to use within the design you'd need to give these to me before I'd come up with any designs.<br />- You'd choose a design and give me your preferences for the design.<br />- Upon selection of design you'd provide me with all content which includes any preferred images and text (I will not write the content for your site - this is your responsibility as this is YOUR site), and I'd complete the site. Actually, in order for the process to go faster, it would be ideal for you to have given this to me early on or for you to be working on this in the meantime so I can move forward more quickly.<br />- Final review/updates/changes - just what it implies.<br />- Website completion. <br /><br />If you're interested please send me a PM or e-mail me at ssm.spam@gmail.com.
