				My friend&nbsp; is moving here November 10th from my hometown of Chattanooga, TN!!!! I am soooo excited to have my boy here!!! He has been scouring craigslist and other places for a place to stay. <br /><br />However, I am really worried. He keeps finding people who are offering a &quot;great deal&quot;, then finding out they are scamming.&nbsp; I&#39;m trying to tell him this with every new &quot;deal&quot; that comes along but he is so naive, he has never lived anywhere but Chattanooga.&nbsp; He insists that it must be &quot;real&quot;, until of course it falls apart.&nbsp; <br /><br />So here is where I need your help. I need to find him a place to stay, at least temporarily or semi-permanent. He is a great guy and a ton of fun. He doesn&#39;t do any drugs or drink and I&#39;m fairly certain he doesn&#39;t smoke (but I&#39;ll double check on that if anyone finds something). He is just a nice easygoing southern boy coming here to try to make his way in acting. <br /><br />As cheap as possible is best, and it doesn&#39;t have to be glamorous. He is just coming here with his clothes and leaving everything else behind. I just need someone who won&#39;t try to take advantage of his being new to the city. Please help!

				Craigslist is known for its scams as far as real estate goes.&nbsp; But I did rent out a room once and found great people thru Craigslist, and also searched for my own.&nbsp; Is he opposed to roommates?&nbsp; I would suggest he check out this option on Craigslist, as it does seem to yield more fruit.&nbsp; Plus it would be much cheaper, especially for an actor trying to make it here in the big city.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also November&#39;s a bit far in advance to be looking.

				Posting on this board and others, as well as looking for signs up in some of the local stores, are good ways to find rooms.&nbsp; Word of mouth is probably going to be your best bet.&nbsp; Is your friend moving up permanently, or just for a month?<br />I didn&#39;t realize you were from TN!&nbsp; I&#39;m from GA&nbsp; :-)

				Wild - I actually grew up in Dayton, TN which is about 45 minutes to an hour north of Chattanooga. Do you still have your accent mcdirk? I lost mine a long long time ago with no regrets. :evil: Not that a southern accent is necessarily a bad thing, just not for me!

				My family always had a lighter accent, more North Georgia/Alabama, Central Tennessee than a full drawl.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t think I had an accent when I moved up, but folks always said I did.&nbsp; 15 years in the Big Apple has masked it pretty thoroughly though - but when I&#39;m around other Southerners, back in the South or say numbers or placenames, it comes out more than usual.&nbsp; I tend to talk too fast to drawl!

				I&#39;ve heard there is a Chic-fil-A in an NYU dorm, but haven&#39;t been able to confirm it - I do know you need an ID to get to it, if it does exist.&nbsp; There is one out in Paramus, NJ, but none in NY as yet.

				Why would you avoid a place simply because of a religion? Sounds stupid to me. The only way you can tell something is different about Chic-fil-a is that it&#39;s closed on Sundays.<br /><br />People rave about the place in the South, but I&#39;ve always considered it just another fast-food restaurant.
