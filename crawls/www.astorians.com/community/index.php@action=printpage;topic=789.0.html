				A wonderful Belgian frites and beer bistro has opened in the &quot;location of the damned&quot; on Ditmars at the corner of 35th, across from 718. <br />Les Moules has big frosty glasses of Stella Artois and Hoegaarden--and much more importantly, Leffe--at good prices, generous drink specials, free tapas, and excellent food. The service is friendly, the owner solicitous, and the atmosphere genuinely European. Let's give this place business and keep it open--break the curse of the location!<br />John Zmirak, gourmand.

				I have no idea why the restaurants that open in that spot keep closing--but it has a self-fulfilling aspect to it. People start to look at the place with suspicion, since nothing ever lasts there, and they're so used to seeing it dark that they don't even consider going in.... <br />But this time they absolutely should!<br />One thing I've noticed, in a lifetime of living here--too many people open restaurants with only 6 mos of capital, so they can't afford to wait for word of mouth to build business. I think that's what happened with Volo--a tragic loss! Now I have to go to Manhattan to get Taleggio!

I think it was a few establishments back (2 years ago, roughly) that I was in there for the first time. Food was OK, but overpriced, and little else to go on to compel me to ever go back.<br /><br />It's a critical location -- right on the corner with those wraparound windows so everyone could see whether it was a 'hoppin' place or not. As the record of previous establishments indicate, not at all. And a dead restaurant is self-perpetuating -- people see it's empty, they don't want to go in and be the only ones there, so they move on.<br /><br />They could make the location work for them, but like the previous owners, I don't see them making the most of the space. For one thing, I think they have to do something about the decor. I see those tired looking doily(?) or whatever thingys on the windows and immediately I think of these really old-world style restaurants I used to frequent in Poland and Hungary. It has associations for me with cheap food, worse service. I keep seeing in my head tables filled with mostly unshaven men, overflowing ashtrays and shot glasses of vodka. &lt;blech&gt;<br /><br />Then &nbsp;saw their menu in the window. The design could use a little sprucing, the prices a little pruning, IMO. Like I said, this was several months ago. Maybe they've done that.

				This is a great spot. I didn't know they did frites, but their Tapas and mussels menu seriously rocks.<br /><br />Hopefully they'll break the curse of this location. Highly recommended.

				I ate there for lunch and was freezing.&nbsp; I wore my coat through the whole meal.&nbsp; I think they have a heating problem with all the glass walls.&nbsp; Also, the food took about an hour -- and so I had to rush through eating it to get back to work. <br /><br />The best part of the experience was the host, who was very friendly.
