Mine is usually pretty decent, and I generally get the movies quickly. Give Netflix a try for a month or two, if the postal service on your street stinks, cancel it. (And complain to the Post Office! They won&#39;t know who the people who aren&#39;t doing their jobs are unless we tell them.)

Netflix chooses to use the usps as their shipper. However, I think that the problems that a lot of people have with their mail has to do with individual mail carriers, so if you wanted to invest in a PO Box, you can do so for about $6 a month (http://www.usps.com/receive/businesssolutions/poboxfees.htm). The boxes that are 1.3&quot; x 5.5 &quot; should be able to fit a Netflix envelope.<br /><br />I know, you&#39;ll still have to go to the Post Office to pick up your mail and that&#39;s inconvienent, but unless Netflix starts using another shipper (which they probably never will), you&#39;ll have to work with the Post Office.
