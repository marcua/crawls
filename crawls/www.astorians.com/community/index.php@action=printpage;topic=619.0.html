				In my humble opinion, it doesn't matter &quot;why&quot; they are being &quot;banned&quot;.<br />How can a species or a race of people be banned?<br />&quot;Banned&quot; sounds curiously like &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; which is a euphemism for genocide. No matter how bad bad dogs can be, animals do not have the capacity to voice their dissent, protect their rights, argue their case or assert their right to exist.

				I figured maybe they were banning &quot;designer&quot; breeds &nbsp;(like the mutated dwarf cats that are somewhat new) because its a cruelty to animals issue. &nbsp;(dwarf cats legs are so short I would think they have a hard time getting around). &nbsp;But NOOOOOOO... they're banning pit bulls - because they're dangerous. &nbsp;UGH!!<br /><br />Now I know how the gun lovers feel (I think). &nbsp;Dogs aren't innately dangerous and mean - they have to be RAISED that way. &nbsp;Terriers in general are biters - if they're going to ban pit bulls (terriers) then what about fox terriers and all those other little yappy biting terrier dogs? <br /><br />Dogs don't (usually) attack people - unless they're trained to attack people (usually). &nbsp;If german shepherds were the dog of choice of the guys (I think it's usually guys who raise tough pit bulls) who keep scarey dogs around... would they be banning German Shepherds? &nbsp;Or black labs? &nbsp;or beagles? &nbsp;<br /><br />What the fcuk?

				Hello ILoveCheese.<br /><br />NYCMacUser hasn't replied to your question, so I looked into this myself.<br />&nbsp;This call to action stems from newly enacted legislation in Ontario Canada.<br />Here is the press release communique from their attorney general explaining the specifics.<br /><br />http://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/news/2005/20050331-Pit-Bulls-Proclam.asp<br /><br /><br />The aim is to prohibit any new pit bull ownership in the province. &nbsp;There is a grandfather clause exempting existing dogs and some other allowances.<br /><br />&nbsp;I've read a lot of horror stories about how they are treated and I support any legislation that would prohibit people from breeding more of them for, let's face it, dogfighting. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;If people really want one, the shelters are overflowing. Visit &nbsp;I read at one breed rescue site that 200 pit bulls are killed a day at shelters in Los Angeles alone. &nbsp;<br /><br />Here's one available for adoption now in NYC.<br />Buddy-<br />http://www.petfinder.com/pet.cgi?action=2&amp;pet=4502512<br />rescued by Humane Law Enforcement Officers, what a suprise.

				Thanks, Tuesday. <br /><br />I did do a little research myself. And, that's sort what I thought. I agree that dogs are usually only mean when they're raised poorly. And I agree that killing people's pets, when they're not hurting people is wrong. But I don't agree that people deserve the right to breed a particularly hazardous variety of dog. Just like I don't think people deserve the right to own an automatic weapon. It's not as if this breed existed in nature we're disrupting the environment. And its not as if there aren't a zillion other kinds of dogs in the world that someone can breed. Does the pit bull breed serve some necessary function that another breed can't? I must be missing something here. <br /><br />What really bothered me about this post, tho, is that people walking thier dogs are now part of the protest? That's like if I said &quot;Everybody take the subway to work at 8:30 tommorrow morning to support the rights of the window-washing squeegy guys.&quot; If you're going to have a protest, have a protest! I wouldn't assume that people support your cause if they're doing something they'd do anyway. <br /><br />PS. Why &quot;Tuesday&quot; and not &quot;Saturday&quot;?

				I am sorry for not responding sooner. I haven't been feeling well, and it <br />has been difficult for me to get on the computer.<br /><br />The reason this vigil needs to be held on this particular night is because <br />there will be little vigils held all over North America at the same time <br />everywhere. 8:00 P.M. on the East Coast; 5:00 P.M. on the West coast; <br />etc. The organizers are hoping to get some press from the vigil so that the <br />public will come to understand that breed banning is NOT the solution to <br />vicious dogs. That to enforce laws requiring people to PTS (Put To Sleep) <br />loving, healthy, gentle dogs is not a solution to anything. They are trying to <br />get the public to understand that we need to PUNISH THE DEED NOT THE <br />BREED. This year Pit Bulls, next year Toy Poodles. When will it stop. We <br />just need to enforce the laws already on the books so that the government <br />cannot get any closer to our bedrooms!<br /><br />There are no inane vicious dogs. There are bad owners. There are bad <br />(READ: Puppy Mills) breeders. <br /><br />This Canadian law is also now in the Assembly of the State of California. <br />AND it looks like it is going to pass.<br /><br />When will it stop. After dogs—what's next?<br /><br />The real issue here is not necessarily dogs—although I feel very strongly <br />about banning ANY breed just for the sake of destroying something <br />someone has had a problem with.<br /><br />Personally, I am sick of the government, whether local, state or federal, <br />legislating MY lifestyle.<br /><br />With or without a dog, please come to Astoria Park by 8:00 P.M. Sunday <br />night and light a candle so that we may all recognize each other.<br /><br />The politics of dogs is just the beginning of the beginning of the end &nbsp;of <br />being allowed to own them. <br /><br />Landlords got their way by being able to ban pets—but there is a loophole <br />in the law I will be glad to share with anyone who has a need to know—<br />now the police are expected to enforce housing laws!<br /><br />BTW, I will probably NOT be able to attend Sunday night due to health <br />issues. If anyone would like to borrow one of my 2 dogs, just let me know. <br />They will be more than happy to accompany you to the park. I have a <br />Bichon and an Affenpinscher.<br /><br />MY LANDLORD CAN KISS MY A**!<br /><br />NYCMacUser<br />Lorrie

				Title: <strong>ASTORIA PARK VIGIL A COMPLETE SUCCESS!!!!!!!!!!!!</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>zeno</strong> on <strong>August 29, 2005, 02:17:40 AM</strong>
			</dt>
			<dd class="postbody">
				I must admit that being new to the excercise of civil disobedience and peaceful protest as outlined in the Bill of Rights that I was a little nervous about showing up in a public park late at night with candles and pit-bulls.<br /><br />Was it a coincidence that the Vigil was set to end at 11:59 pm, exactly one minute before midnight? What would happen at that dreaded hour? Was there some clause in the law books in Rome about candles (read: open flame) that punishes such indiscretions in ways too horrible to mention? And what time does this park close anyway? If I overstayed the dreaded minute would my peaceful vigil be instantly transformed into trespassing or criminal mischief by the armies of peace officers and private security agents who would be hired to crack down on the protest?<br /><br />My heart litterly quivered in trepidation as I contemplated the Rave in Utah where helicopters descended while military men in camoflage made short work of those dangerous teenagers and dancers, tackling them and screaming them into submission.<br /><br />And what about the other protesters? Would they look on me unkindly when I tried to give them a flyer concerning the September 24th March on Washington to end the War on Iraq? Would screaming arguments ensue and more importantly, would I get bit?<br /><br />My, my, between the stealth helicopters, the armies of cops, cannibalistic <br />leftists, pit-bulls, snipers, angry townsfolk, neo-cons, tear gas, plastic <br />bullets, real bullets in M16s, <em>sonic</em> weaponry and open flames I was <br />really in for it. No surer way on the path to destruction a direction was headed I.<br /><br />Luckily, my fears were unfounded. Here are the minutes of the action:<br /><br />23.12: I arrived late to the protest, but didn't see anyone there at the risers, so I walked around to the other side of the track just in case there was confusion about which riser to meet at, then found myself back where I started at the first riser.<br /><br />around 23.23: I courageously lit my candle amidst astonished and puzzled onlookers (all three of them) and placed the aforementioned candle on the top riser then sat down. I immediately lit a cigarette to demonstrate to the onlookers that I was not about to pray, but was in fact a depraved liberal, &quot;one of the people&quot;.<br /><br />23.28: I noticed that my right ankle was starting to itch quite badly then deduced that I was indeed being eaten by a mosquito when it flew past my face.<br /><br />23.29: I ground out my cigarette, careful not to litter.<br /><br />23.30: After ruminating on how large the mosquito was I decided to stand up. Not only would this help me from being bit, it would also help me become more visible to the other protestors who by this time were arriving in droves (albeit unseen by me), it is after all a very big park.<br /><br />23.36: Representatives of New York's Finest started showing up, along with dozens of private security &quot;personnel&quot; sporting the latest in technological crowd control devices and weaponry, but they were so cleverly hidden that I couldn't spy a trace of them (must be their training), although I can't say I didn't try. In response to this, the (by now hundreds of protestors) also remained hidden. As newly installed Comptroller I felt it was my duty to stay out in the open and if necessary, take the blame as well as the full wrath of the Administration if they were so inclined. I gritted my teeth, tried to look relaxed, confident and reminded myself that this was a necessary burden of leadership. With great leadership comes great responsibility, a willingness to sink with one's ship. I would show the world and George W. Bush what it means to be a commander! <br />Perhaps, after hearing of my bravery he would award me some Medal of Honour or Reward for Courage. Such a trophy, bestowed by him would really mean something, he is after all a Great War Hero and a fighter pilot to boot.<br /><br />23.41: Tragedy! It struck without warning. My solitary flame in the darkness was snuffed out by a malignant wind. I quickly relit it should others be confounded in the night without a beacon to guide them.<br /><br />23.42: Someone ran past me on the track. I looked at my watch and saw it was 46 seconds after the minute.<br /><br />23.47: I scanned the track to look for the lone runner and became suddenly disappointed to see him leaving the track without the benefit of having been timed sucessfully.<br /><br />23.51: Lit another cigarette and admired the skyline of Manhattan as well as a gorgeous terraced condominium complex in the distance. I thought to myself how little time I actually spend with my thoughts in such pleasant surroundings.<br /><br />23.53: Received communication from the current Comptroller that I was fired and would be ineligible for further election to office due to (what I believe) was a curious use of a technicality. Specifically, due to the fact that I was no longer a dog owner I could no longer lead. So with great regret and remorse I submitted and peacefully stepped down. Let me just say, that during my term it was a great honor to serve you all, but due process must be observed even if it causes great discontent with those who would rather hold on to power beyond their lawful term if democracy is to be preserved.<br /><br />23.55: Relit my candle and prepared to grind out my cigarette. Also started to prepare for the &quot;dreaded&quot; hour.<br /><br />23.57: Some skaters joined the vigil and protested dog breed bans everywhere silently in keeping with the solemness of the occasion.<br /><br />23.58: Staring at my cell phone which showed the &quot;correct&quot; time.<br /><br />23.59: Blew out my candle and started the long walk home.<br /><br />Well I must say that I had expected much more mayhem and opposition, but now that I know how serene these vigils and demonstrations can be, as well as how conducive to silent meditation and mental well-being they are, I for one will not be afraid of attending more protests. By seeing how successful this Vigil turned out (as controversial as it was) I have no reservations about saying with certainty that when it comes round time to protest the final phase of the U.S.A. PATRIOT Act, I am quite sure it will also be a Complete Success. :-)<br /><br />----Zeno.

				When we stretch ourselves beyond what is normal, safe and comfortable <br />for the good of others, then we really are performing acts of courage. &nbsp;In <br />that context, we must accept what may be courageous for one, might be <br />ordinary and not courageous for another. Most of us would have recoiled <br />at even the thought of remaining alone in our vigil.<br /><br />By your stoic and fearless actions, you and you (obviously) alone <br />represented the thousands of disenchanted citizens by your courageous <br />staying powers.<br /><br />You acted with fortitude and honor in the face of frightening, albeit unseen, <br />adversaries.<br /><br />Courage is the ability to act regardless of the feelings or potential <br />consequences. <br /><br />Courage is following your intuition when the facts are against it. <br /><br />In most cultures, courage carries connotations of strength and <br />self-assurance.<br /><br />Cindy Sheehan and her candlelight vigil have nothing on our Zeno. <br /><br />Nothing at all. She, in fact, is surrounded by dozens, perhaps hundreds, of <br />others in her struggle. You were all alone. Except, of course, for that one <br />lone mosquito. You kept your candle burning. Your head rattling with the <br />deafening noises leaping off at you from the Triborough Bridge. The <br />clanging and banging of those trucks filling the night air with thoughts of <br />migraine and pollution. The trains spilling across the Hellgate Bridge <br />blowing their whistles in the night just to let you know that they can. <br /><br />And you stayed . . . and stayed . . . just in the hope that your participation <br />of the American way would light the night for all the lost souls who <br />promised to participate with you—and instead decided to stay home and <br />watch the Tom Selleck movie!
