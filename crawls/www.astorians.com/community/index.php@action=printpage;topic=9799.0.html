				Let&#039;s face it, anyone of a&nbsp; certain age, as I am, who grew up on this show, when it was originally on and grew up in the 60&#039;s, 70&#039;s and even early 80&#039;s&nbsp; must have one time or another knew someone, or indulged themselves. No comment from my end.&nbsp; &nbsp;:lol:<br /><br /><br />&#039;Gilligan&#039;s&#039; Mary Ann Caught With Dope<br /><br /><br /><br />DRIGGS, Idaho (AP) - Dawn Wells, who played Mary Ann on ``Gilligan&#039;s Island,&#039;&#039; is serving six months&#039; unsupervised probation after allegedly being caught with marijuana in her car. <br /><br />She was sentenced Feb. 29 to five days in jail, fined $410.50 and placed on probation after pleading guilty to one count of reckless driving. <br /><br />Under a plea agreement, three misdemeanor counts - driving under the influence, possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of a controlled substance - were dropped. <br /><br />On Oct. 18, Teton County sheriff&#039;s Deputy Joseph Gutierrez arrested Wells as she was driving home from a surprise birthday party that was held for her. According to the sheriff&#039;s office report, Gutierrez pulled Wells over after noticing her swerve and repeatedly speed up and slow down. When Gutierrez asked about a marijuana smell, Wells said she&#039;d just given a ride to three hitchhikers and had dropped them off when they began smoking something. Gutierrez found half-smoked joints and two small cases used to store marijuana. <br /><br />The 69-year-old Wells, founder of the Idaho Film and Television Institute and organizer of the region&#039;s annual family movie festival called the Spud Fest, then failed a sobriety test. <br /><br />Wells&#039; lawyer, Ron Swafford, said that a friend of Wells&#039; testified that he&#039;d left a small amount of marijuana in the vehicle after using it that day, and that Wells was unaware of it. Swafford also said several witnesses were prepared to testify that Wells had very little to drink at the party and was not intoxicated when she left. He said she was swerving on the road because she was trying to find the heater controls in her new car. <br /><br /><br />03/11/08 22:40 Â© Copyright The Associated Press<br />

On one&nbsp; hand, it is just as damaging as smoking tobacco and drinking combined, but, both of those, especially&nbsp; smoking, have many more restrictions to near&nbsp; banning that I thought I would never&nbsp; see, partly due to the availability and health problems. On the other&nbsp; hand, your health should be your business, since&nbsp; many pay for health insurance, if it was more centralised the argument would be reversed, and&nbsp; we really have no statistics&nbsp; on how many accidents&nbsp; are caused by people driving while high on Pot. Truth is we don&#039;t need more readily&nbsp; available&nbsp; intoxicating substances, but, throwing people&nbsp; in jail is also&nbsp; no great solution. My solution, unless&nbsp; you are caught with a certain amount, say more than an ounce, and/or you&#039;re&nbsp; operating any kind of machinery when you are caught, at most you should just have to be alerted to the dangers.

				Well FZ, holy crap I agree with you. <br /><br />To touch on your point about costing taxpayers money, if legalized, it would most likely get taken over by the tobacco industry, which is already taxed up the ying-yang. (In my opinion should be taxed more, because I&#039;m sure cigarettes cost ungodly amounts of money in health insurance payouts across the country)<br /><br />As for her, I say let her go, who cares if she toked a bit. DWI is a whole different story, and so is dealing. But I doubt she was going all Pablo Escobar.

				Your arguement was to tax cigarettes more because they cost &quot;ungodly amounts of money in health insurance payouts&quot;.<br /><br />My arguement is that I&#039;m already paying for my health insurance payouts and, thusly, should not be charged more for my smokes.<br /><br />Maybe I wasn&#039;t clear, but I don&#039;t understand what your last post has to do with taxing cigarettes more.

In addition to healthcare costs, their tax money also goes to pay for anti-smoking campaigns, education about the dangers of smoking and government programs to help people quit. <br />If those companies get overtaxed as a result of the knowingly dangerous product they sell to people, I have no problem with it. Even if the cost trickles down to me, I&#039;m ok with that. It&#039;s the inherent nature of that business.

				Yeah, I guess I wasn&#039;t clear enough.<br /><br />I suppose if that&#039;s your stance, I can understand why you believe that.

				I think I get what you are saying. I hope that you never would have to face what some patients are dealing with.<br /><br /><br />Some medicines have side effects. Some medicines have risks.<br /><br /><br />Surely you know that inhalers are one way of dispensing medicine.<br /><br /><br /><br />There are plenty of legal ways of damaging one&#039;s health. There are some illegal ways of protecting one&#039;s health.<br />My view is let the adults decide. Let the patients decide. Get informed with your doctors.<br /><br /><br /><br />Good health.
