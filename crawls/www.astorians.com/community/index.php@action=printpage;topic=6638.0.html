				I used to be really into bars when I was in my twenties.&nbsp; &nbsp;Now that I&#039;m well into my forties, I no longer go (as often), but I am amazed at all the bars that have come and gone since I moved to Astoria way back in November &#039;87.&nbsp; &nbsp; Let&#039;s list some of the bars that have gone.<br /><br />1) On the east side of 21st Street just south of 30th Avenue there was a place called Mantle&#039;s.&nbsp; It is now a private social club I believe.<br /><br />2) Also on the east side 21st Street, just north of 30th Avenue, there was believe it or not a Czechoslavian bar.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is a free standing brick building that became a used furniture store and is now an auto parts/motorcycle store.<br /><br />3) On the west side of 21st Street, a two blocks or so below where Newtown and Astoria Blvd. come together, was believe it or not a disco!&nbsp; &nbsp; It then became a bar run by a Jamaican guy and also billed itself as a clam bar.&nbsp; &nbsp;I used to jog down 21st Street at night and run by the place and there was never anyone in there.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is now some other kind of business, a restaurant maybe.<br /><br />4) On the south side of 30th Avenue between 31st and 32nd Streets there was a &quot;neighborhood&quot; bar that is now a butcher shop.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can still see the cool tin ceiling.&nbsp; &nbsp;Pinnochio,&nbsp; a restaurant on the southeast corner of 30th Ave. and 32nd St., and the butcher shop were located on the southwest corner of 31st St. and 30th Avenue and respectively moved when the building came down and the office building, now housing a bank on the ground floor, was built.&nbsp; <br /><br />5)&nbsp; Tupelo, on 34th Avenue between 36th and 37th Streets approximately, was the last of three or four bars at the site that is now a Bravo supermarket.&nbsp; &nbsp;If my increasingly faulty memory serves me correctly, when I moved here in &#039;87 there was a bar on the site that went under and then it became one ethnic social club then another before going out of business until the stylish Tupelo moved in.<br /><br />6)&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember the name of it, but there was a bar on the west side of Steinway between Broadway and 34th Streets.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was closer to 34th Street than Broadway and to narrow it down further it was south of the subway entrance.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can&#039;t remember which storefront it was but there is another business there now.<br /><br />7)&nbsp; I believe there was a bar on the northeast corner of Crescent and 30th Avenue directly across from the hospital.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is now a pharmacy.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m pretty sure it was a bar.<br /><br />8)&nbsp; There was a bar on the south side of Broadway between 31st and 30th Streets across the street (and on the same side of the street) from the supermarket.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is now a nail salon.&nbsp; &nbsp;I remember walking by and never seeing many people in there, but there was one regular I would see in there all the time who was in a wheel chair.&nbsp; &nbsp; He quickly found a new spot because I saw him in the bar on Broadway diagonally across street.&nbsp; &nbsp;That one is still open, albeit having undergone a renovation.<br /><br />9) There was another bar, called &quot;The Spinning Wheel&quot; or the &quot;Spinnaker&quot; or something like that also on the south side of Broadway near Crescent.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I moved into Astoria the place was closed, but reopened shortly after.&nbsp; &nbsp; It has since gone out of business.<br /><br />10) There used to be a bar on the west side of 31st Street and 36th Avenue that was part of the same building as the supermarket.&nbsp; &nbsp;I walked by one day and the bar was gone. The supermarket expanded and took over the space.<br /><br />11)&nbsp; And I seem to remember an Irish Bar on the south side of 36th Avenue a block or two west of 31st Street.&nbsp; &nbsp;I walked down that block for the first time in years and the bar was long gone, having been replaced by an Indian deli/store.<br /><br />12)&nbsp; When I moved into Astoria I remember going to a bar on the south side of Broadway between 33rd and 34th Streets.&nbsp; &nbsp;Remember back then Astoria was bereft of cable TV (I didn&#039;t get mine until &#039;92 or so) so I went to this bar to watch a sporting event and the odd thing about the bar is that it was painted all black inside.&nbsp; &nbsp;There was a backroom with a pool table.&nbsp; &nbsp;And they had some sort of electronic sports trivia game.&nbsp; That place closed and a more upscale, and brighter, Irish bar opened in the space and was open for about a decade.&nbsp; &nbsp;I noticed the Irish bar closed and it is now some other type of bar.&nbsp; &nbsp;Of all the bars listed, this is the only one I ever actually went into.<br /><br />13)&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe someone can help me out here and I&#039;m stretching the boundaries of Astoria to include Long Island City, but were there ever two bars on the south side of Queensboro Plaza?&nbsp; &nbsp; I remember one that had an Irish name that was right on the corner where you would pick up the bus when they were working on the N line.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was open until fairly recently -- the last five or six years -- but last time I went by it was gone and replaced by a deli.&nbsp; &nbsp; I could have sworn there was a second bar in that stretch, but could be imagining it.<br /><br />14)&nbsp; &nbsp;I never went in and never even walked by it, but as you made the turn on the N train either from or two Queensboro Plaza you could see a bar on the street just west of 31st Street, just north of the plaza.&nbsp; It is long gone.&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m not even sure it was a bar, but I could have sworn it was by the neon sign.<br /><br />15)&nbsp; &nbsp;This bar was closed before I stumbled across it, but two or three blocks west of the 39th Street subway station there was a corner bar.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was closed when I walked by, but the facade was still there.&nbsp; &nbsp;The facade is long gone and I can&#039;t even really remember where it was located.<br />

				I remember #3 when it was the Village Tavern - really nice - bar and wine only with decent kitchen and excellent clams. Cuz and Timmy were bartenders. John was owner I believe.<br /><br />#5 was originally the Studio Bar from when Paramount was there - became Yellowbird Lounge (still also had old Studio Bar sign up). Later closed.<br />&nbsp;It then became Tupelo and part of it became Sign shop there.<br />

				Another one I forgot about was on the north side of 34th Street, between 32nd and 33rd Streets.&nbsp; &nbsp; The sign hanging read &quot;Ryan&#039;s&quot; so you thought it was an Irish bar, but it was an Italian restaurant that did not business whatsoever.&nbsp; &nbsp;I remember eating there once or twice and no one was in there.&nbsp; &nbsp; A guy I knew who grew up in Astoria knew the Ryan of Ryan&#039;s and stopped in there to see presumably the owner, &quot;Buck Ryan&quot; but learned it was an Italian restaurant.<br /><br />The restaurant closed and it became a late night bar catering to Latinos and is still that today as far as I know.

				How could I forget this one?&nbsp; &nbsp;It probably is the latest casualty.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Tsolias (sic) Bar on Hoyt Avenue South, a couple of blocks west of 31st closed.&nbsp; &nbsp;That one had been open for years and only in recent months has it closed.&nbsp; I jog by there virtually every day and looked in one day and noticed it was closed.&nbsp; &nbsp; Now a for rent sign is up.&nbsp; <br /><br />I never went in the place, but remember when we had the first blackout a couple of years ago -- not last summer&#039;s more recent blackout -- but the blackout that affected all of NYC?&nbsp; &nbsp; I went for a jog that night and remember Tsolias remained open (one of the few businesses to do so).&nbsp; &nbsp;They had set up a generator on the sidewalk and that was powering the place.

				Two more quickies.<br /><br />Wasn&#039;t there a bar on the corner of 33rd Street and Astoria Blvd. (across the street from the Burger King, which was a Roy Rogers)?&nbsp; The space is now the recently closed &quot;Blue Deli?&quot;<br /><br />And wasn&#039;t there a bar in the space where Dunkin&#039; Donuts now is on the corner of 31st &amp; Hoyt Avenue South, hard by the Astoria Blvd. subway station?

				Was there ever a seedy looking bar on the south side of Astoria Boulevard just west of 21st Street?&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a few storefronts east of Fishbein&#039;s and the bottle shop that were on the corner.&nbsp; &nbsp; I seem to remember a sinister looking place there that didn&#039;t have windows or small slits that passed for windows.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is long gone, but I seem to remember a bar being there, though I only walked by and never went in.&nbsp; I would have been afraid to go in.

				Tsorias, the bar on Hoyt Avenue South a block or two west of 31st Street, can no longer be considered the latest bar closing.&nbsp; &nbsp; On my corner, 28th Ave. &amp; 34th Street, is or was until yesterday a little cafe/bar.&nbsp; &nbsp;I just walked by and there is a police sticker on the metal gate saying &quot;closed by order of the New York Police Department.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;God only knows if it will reopen.&nbsp; &nbsp;Kind of weird because just a couple of weeks ago on the other end of the block the Japanese place on 30th Avenue and 34th Street was closed by the NYC Health Dept, but has since reopened.<br /><br />I moved into my current apartment in &#039;01 and the now closed bar @ 34th &amp; 28th has had four distinct iterations.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I moved in it was a Columbian restaurant that was open for breakfast and lunch only.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then new owners took over and it still remained a Columbia restaurant.&nbsp; &nbsp;I never went in.<br /><br />Then it had a third iteration when it was turned into a bar/restaurant by a different group of Hispanics -- Mexicans maybe -- that served dinner and remained open late into the night.&nbsp; &nbsp;They tried everything to make a go of it, doing take-out,&nbsp; changing the menu and even broadcasting pay per view boxing matches (which seemed to draw a crowd).&nbsp; &nbsp;But no one came.&nbsp; &nbsp;I felt bad for the owners because I saw how hard they worked to make a go of it and stopped in two or three times late in the afternoon to knock back a Heineken or two.&nbsp; &nbsp;I had the place to myself usually.&nbsp; &nbsp;They also were generous with their buybacks, giving you the third brew on the house.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />They finally gave up the ghost and a fourth set of owners, who weren&#039;t Hispanic, took over.&nbsp; &nbsp;They looked like Slavic people from one of those countries that was formerly part of Yugoslavia.&nbsp; &nbsp;They seemed to be doing better.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would see people in there, but surprise, surprise, surprise when the patrons show up today and see the sign.

				Does anyone remember the bar that used to be on the corner of 31st Street and 36th Avenue?&nbsp; Food World took it over a few years back and the block was never the same.&nbsp; I remember the bartenders were great, the drinks were cheap and it was really a neighborhood chill spot, for better or for worse.&nbsp; One of the regulars was a guy who sang Italian operas and Brat Pack tunes at the bar.&nbsp;

				When I was growing up there was a bar on 30th Ave and 30th St, right where the &quot;parking lot&quot; for Trade Fair is. It was called the Piano Bar. My buddy and I used to run errands for one of the barmaids there.

				I forgot all about this place, but when I moved to Astoria there was a bar way down on the northeast corner of Steinway and 19th Street (the last east/west street) called Suspenders.&nbsp; &nbsp;I never went in there, but there was also a bar called Suspenders on the East Side of Manhattan, maybe Second Avenue &amp; 40th Street.&nbsp; &nbsp; Before I moved to NYC in &#039;82 someone had recommended the East Side Suspenders and I used to go there frequently in the 80&#039;s when I lived in Manhattan.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was&nbsp; big firefighters&#039; hangout.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have no idea if the Manhattan Suspenders is still there, but the Astoria Suspenders (I am pretty sure the owner of the two Suspenders was the same) changed the name to something else a number of years ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;Last time I was by that corner the bar was still there, but I forget what it was called.<br /><br />And I remember somewhere on Broadway in the 40&#039;s was a little bar on the north side of the street.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was called &quot;The Admiral&#039;s Club&quot; or had some sort of nautical name or navy name.&nbsp; &nbsp;I never went in the place and wonder if it is still there.<br /><br />And one other bar/restaurant I did go to is on Broadway &amp; 38th Street on the same block and Phelan&nbsp; &amp; Cronin.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is still open, but has changed names and I assume owners since I moved to Astoria.&nbsp; &nbsp;It might have been affiliated with another bar on Long Island.&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember the old name and I can&#039;t remember the new name even though I walk by all the time.

On Ditmars, Matty&#039;s Cafe on 32 St. On the next street was a place called Tom&#039;s, which is now a hair salon I believe, then McGivneys on 37th Street, (I worked there for awhile). On 45th and Ditmars was a place called Cheers, and another place I forget the name was on the corner of 43rd Street and 23rd Ave. That&#039;s where I had my first beer in a real bar. All this was around 1977-1987. Dooley&#039;s was also on Ditmars at 38th Street. <br /><br />I just remembered the name of the topless bar you mentioned. It was called New Image. That was the mall which used to be Eintracht Oval, a pretty big soccer/football field with stands and everything. I remember the name because we used to refer to the place as &quot;Nude Image&quot;.

				Our apartment on 30th Ave. was right next door to Terry&#039;s Bar. Always filled with neighborhood<br />regulars - mostly our dads! - it was the place everyone went on Sunday afternoons to watch a <br />game or just relax. I remember when the Mister Softee truck came around, all of us kids would<br />run into Terry&#039;s and ask for ice cream money - which we always got.<br /><br />Also, the Backstreet Bar that used to be on the corner of 30th St. &amp; 30th Ave. - where Tradefair&#039;s<br />parking lot is now. Dark inside, always gave the impression of being cool and sophisticated - at least<br />to a teen. <br /><br />I miss those places.....

				I remember there used to be a place that was more of a restaurant than a bar, but it did have a bar called I think &quot;Nickelodeon&quot; and it was on Steinway diagonally across the street from the old theater @ 30th Ave. &amp; Steinway.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a nice to play to go to grab a drink before or after a movie.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know &quot;Nickelodeon&quot; is long gone and I can&#039;t off the top of my head remember what is there now, though it might be another restaurant.

				The place now called Broadway Sports Bar (B&#039;way near Crescent) used to be called Dillon&#039;s. Before that it was called The Spinning Wheel. <br /><br />I had long understood that before it was called The Spinning Wheel it was called The Empire, but a friend who has lived here longer than I&#039;ve been alive says that before it was The Spinning Wheel that place was actually called The Colonial, and it had been called The Colonial for over 30 years. <br /><br />Does anyone here know if the bar at that location used to be called The Empire or The Colonial?

				I think the smoking ban finished the job that raising the drinking age started.

				Not sure If this was posted already, but i used to hang out alot in a bar called &quot;the Boulevard&quot; on the corner of 33rd street and Astoria Blvd. What I remember most about this bar was how hard it was to enter the bathroom to pee. The door always seemed to be locked. and when it opened 3 or 4 guys would come out, at the same time with their eyes wide open and their jaws wiggin . hmmm&nbsp; LOL at the time I did not realize what was going on...

(I bought the book in the early 90&#039;s) Lo and behold, because of work in the year 2004 I found myself on Astoria blvd. and 18th street and saw a freshly dug hole in the ground. - New foundation being poured. To quote Maxwell Smart- missed it by that much.!!&nbsp; The building was gone. but because of your memory and the photo in my book we can say for certain a bar was here from 1934 (photo credit) till whenever you last saw it.

				There is another bar on 30th between maybe 35th and 36th that closed.&nbsp; &nbsp;And it looked like they closed in a hurry because there are still glasses on the table and a fully stocked bar.<br /><br />But the space on the corner of 34th St. and 28th Avenue has also re-opened as another bar/cafe.&nbsp; Since I lived in the area (from March &#039;01) there have been at least five different restaurants, cafes and bars on the site.&nbsp; &nbsp;None has been able to make a go of it.

				Was Gus&#039; tavern where the butcher is now on the south side of 30th Ave. between 31st &amp; 32nd Streets? I know that was a bar. If you go into the meat market you can see the *cool* tin ceiling. When they built that building on the southwest corner of 30th Ave. &amp; 32nd St., Pinochio&#039;s restaurant moved across the street where the hamburger place is now. The butcher moved a few doors west to where a bar once was. I remember when this move happened -- it wasn&#039;t all that long ago -- but I can&#039;t remember the bar where the butcher is now.<br /><br /><br />Speaking of bars, I noticed that Jimbo&#039;s, a long-time Astoria bar on Astoria Blvd. just west of 31st St./the Astoria Blvd. subway stop, is renovating. It is morphing into a Greek restaurant/bar, according to the sign outside the place.

				I remember wandering around Dutch Kills on the Astoria side of the plaza.&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember exactly when it was. It might have been back in 1989 when my job took me to the area, but I noticed an old bar, that was closed, on the corner of 39th Ave. &amp; 30th St. For whatever reason, I always remembered the place. I was walking by there this week and someone re-opened the bar.&nbsp; They had burgers and a menu. It looked like a nice, little place, but they had a sign on the door saying they were &quot;closed while they regroup&quot;. The new place had &quot;Kills&quot; in the title, but it wasn&#039;t &quot;Dutch&quot; Kills.<br /><br /><br />Anyone else remember that old bar that was there?

				The new place is called Dutch Kills Centraal and it&#039;s on 39th Ave and 29th Street. It was going to open as Windmill Tap &amp; Grill.

				Chris, in regard to your inquiry, <br />6.&nbsp; Are you thinking of the old Villanova?&nbsp; I believe it was called Wolfetones for a brief time in the early 90&#039;s.&nbsp; When you walked in, the bar was to the right and there used to be one of those old shuffle/bowling games against the left wall.<br />13.&nbsp; The bar you are thinking of on the corner of Queensboro Plaza sounds like the Dublin Bar.&nbsp; A bit of a divey pub, but a good place to get a quick drink or two back in the day.<br />14.&nbsp; I think the place you are referring to was called the Brazilian Circle, or something similar. It was on 41st Avenue, just north of Queensboro Plaza, and just south of the old LIC HS.

It might have changed names before it closed because I remember walking by one day and being surprised to see a sign advertising music in the place.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font"></span><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=6638.msg235080.html#msg235080">Quote from: hellgateviking on November 08, 2013, 10:16:51 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font"></span><br />13.&nbsp; The bar you are thinking of on the corner of Queensboro Plaza sounds like the Dublin Bar.&nbsp; A bit of a divey pub, but a good place to get a quick drink or two back in the day.<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=6638.msg235080.html#msg235080">Quote from: hellgateviking on November 08, 2013, 10:16:51 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><br /><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;" class="bbc_font">I do remember that place.&nbsp; First the bar closed and was replaced by a convenience store/news stand and then they knocked the whole building down.

Do you remember where it was and when it closed down?
