				I&#039;ve finally decided to get around to getting a radiator cover for my exposed radiator in my living room.&nbsp; The only place I know to get them in my immediate area (Broadway) is the Astoria Finast Windows Co. (36th or 37th and B&#039;way), but they seem to never be open and maybe out of business.&nbsp; I noticed the building they&#039;re in is for sale.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, does anyone know where I could get one?&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks!&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)

				Hi.<br /><br />The only place that I know has them is Lucky Window Products.&nbsp; They&#039;re on 3rd avenue in brooklyn.&nbsp; (718) 492-7774&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; It would bet money that that is where Finast used to get his.<br /><br />If you want one out of wood, I know the woodworker at Ditmars Lumber makes them. (718) 545-wood&nbsp; He&#039;s expensive and slow as heck but if you go to him and get a price, I can build you one similar and cheaper than he will.<br /><br />Did you have something specific in mind?&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#039;ve always wanted to build one.<br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; Your message box is full.<br />

				There is a place on Broadway, maybe the corner of 35th or 36th st that has them and custom makes them as well.&nbsp; It is on the corner, has a for sale sign on the building but it is still open.&nbsp; If it isn&#039;t those blocks it is 1 off but on Broadway for sure.&nbsp; Good luck!

				This place is in Jackson Heights.<br />I haven&#039;t shopped here, but I too would like to get some radiator covers one of these days. <br />&nbsp;<br />http://www.stanleyradiatorenclosures.com/<br /><br />Here&#039;s their price list:<br /><br />http://www.stanleyradiatorenclosures.com/files/34814426.pdf<br />

				Great! Keep us posted on how it goes!<br /><br />(Hope your Christmas cactus can hang in there. Give it some light and don&#039;t overwater.)

				I&#039;ve ordered from Stanley in Jackson Heights - the stock covers are servicable and get the job done for a lot less money than I&#039;ve seen other places.&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;d check them out. <br /><br />

				I finally made it over to Stanley&#039;s and I bought one of their pre-fabricated models.&nbsp; It&#039;s nicer than I thought it was going to be and it fits nicely.&nbsp; So yay, more surface space!&nbsp;

				&nbsp;:-D <br /><br />Yea I&#039;ve also noticed the overthetop patriotic stigma from that place on Broadway. <br /><br />I think its interesting stuff. I actually stop to check out some of the articles and memoribilia they have on their window. What else am I going to look at? Radiators?&nbsp; :-D<br /><br />But I always see two photos of military personnel on their window front, so I assume the family of this business has children or siblings either at war or a victim of it.
