				Title: <strong>Missing UPS Package</strong><br />

				I ordered a cheap electric razor online. It came with a fogless mirror and i could not resist. I checked on the status of its delivery yesterday morning, and UPS claims to have delivered the package to the front door of my building at 3:30 pm on Friday. When I got home from work on Friday around 8, there was no package and no UPS sticky note stating that they attempted to deliver me a package. I&#039;m working with the vendor to get a replacement, but am more perturbed by the thought of someone taking my package. I live on a busy block near 30th Ave and 34th street, and I am surprised that UPS would leave a package on the steps of a 5 story walk up.<br /><br />Yesterday I posted a hand written note in my lobby along the lines of, &quot;Dear neighbors, UPS claims that they delivered me a package to the front door of our building, but it was not here when I got home. If you picked the package up by mistake or saw anyone else do so, please let me know.&quot;<br /><br />Would you find this offensive?<br /><br />I went out last night about 8 and when I got home around 2 the note was gone. I posted another note along the same lines.<br /><br />Now I&#039;m going to check if that one is still up.<br /><br />Meanwhile,<br /><br />Dear neighbors,<br /><br />You know my story. Have you seen my package? If you have, please let me know. And you happen to see anyone with a crappy shave, let me know too, because they may be using my crappy electric razor.<br /><br />Yours,<br />AAPA<br />

				I got a package the other day that had obviously been dropped kicked by UPS thereby shattering the contents inside.&nbsp; Thankfully the vendor is sending a new one but I&#039;m nervous to see if it will also arrive shattered.&nbsp; Hope you get your package soon.

				This is a long shot, but I once had a package that was misdelivered to an address a few blocks away. Maybe that&#039;s what happened? Somehow when I called about that one (or maybe even on the website?) they were able to tell me who signed for it, so that tipped me off. They picked it up and redelivered it the next day.<br /><br />Good luck! I hope that there&#039;s a simple explanation for this....

				i always see UPS and FED-EX packages left on doorsteps or in the lobbies of buildings.&nbsp; i have even seen big computer boxes that say DELL on the side left out in open view on 21st st, where there is a constant flow of traffic and anybody can take it.&nbsp; use usps, i know they aren&#039;t allowed to leave anything outside..

				They can check delivered if it&#039;s merely on the curb.&nbsp; They are not supposed to but they can and do.&nbsp; I think your first not was fine. I wouldn&#039;t have left the second note because it&#039;s a tad passive aggressive. Just my humble opinion.

				Their goal is to make as few return trips as possible, so UPS leaves packages all the time now.<br /><br />They will only not leave packages at locations that have a lot of claims against them.

				My super had my package. He picked it up from outside my building, or in the lobby (I did not fully understand) on Friday, and then was not home for the entire weekend. He called my ex-roommate on Monday night to tell him that he had a package for me. The super explained that he had received complaints from tenants for not picking up loose packages in the past.<br /><br />Thanks for your time and energy.
