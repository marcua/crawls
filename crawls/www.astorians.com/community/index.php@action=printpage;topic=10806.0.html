				You know, recently, I&#039;ve&nbsp; seen Obama make some&nbsp; moves&nbsp; toward supporting war. The truth is as far back&nbsp; as nearly a year ago, Obama wanted&nbsp; to invade&nbsp; Pakistan to get Osama and Al Qeada. Although, I thought it would&nbsp; be difficult, and may result in the&nbsp; fragile&nbsp; Paki govt overthrown by Islamicists&nbsp; who would&nbsp; then possess&nbsp; Nukes, it was&nbsp; a bit startling. He was alos speaking to AIPAC, and even worse a combined USA/Israel &#039;pin&#039;, while&nbsp; saying he would stand by Isaels side if attacked? Still, one&nbsp; has&nbsp; to&nbsp; remember that only&nbsp; Nixon could go to China&nbsp; and Roosevelt&nbsp; could&nbsp; intern American citizens of enemy &#039;heritage&#039;&nbsp; and&nbsp; be applauded. I argue many times&nbsp; with people&nbsp; I normally agree with, that trade with Communist China is&nbsp; a mistake. But, I find that where globalists of left and right agree is, that trade&nbsp; &#039;builds bridges.&#039; Unfortunately, I don&#039;t want to build&nbsp; a&nbsp; bridge with someone who will blow it up when I am on it.&nbsp; :lol:&nbsp; Anyway, Obama has also changed&nbsp; positions&nbsp; on the &#039;immediate&#039; withdrawl of troops&nbsp; from Iraq, he has obviously&nbsp; seen the intelligence, but, can&#039;t get too far&nbsp; to the &#039;middle&#039; cause&nbsp; he has promised&nbsp; the far-left group&nbsp; in his party of the immediate&nbsp; withdrawl. It&#039;s like when&nbsp; the recession had started a year before&nbsp; Clinton left office, but, was not &#039;highlighted&#039; by&nbsp; our&nbsp; &#039;crack&#039; news, until&nbsp; Bush got in. Of course that was overshadowed&nbsp; by the 9/11&nbsp; attacks. The same will happen if, G-d forbid :lol:, Obama&nbsp; becomes&nbsp; President, a year&nbsp; in he will be welcoming our brave troops, as Iraq&nbsp; has been becoming more&nbsp; stable, at least since&nbsp; the &#039;surge.&#039; I&nbsp; do believe, that&nbsp; he will wait, &#039;redeploy&#039; into afghan, and try to make&nbsp; &#039;nice.&#039;&nbsp; But, in the end, he will come to realise, that despite wishful&nbsp; thinking from the Wi-Fi/Internet generation, the danger is real, the enemy will not&nbsp; be coddled and he will strike. Of course, I am voting for McCain, cause&nbsp; he was in from the begining, even having his own son in the battle. But, for those&nbsp; who think this is&nbsp; a solid&nbsp; so-called &#039;anti-war&#039; guy, who is standing in the street with a sign, I think they will be in for&nbsp; a surprise.<br /><br /><br />Obama: Peacenik or untested warmonger?<br />By JEREMY LOTT | 6/4/08 9:29 AM EST&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Barack Obama declared his opposition to “a dumb war, a rash war, a war based not on reason but on passion, not on principle but on politics” at an anti-war rally in early October 2002. From the time of the joint congressional resolution that made the Iraq war possible, through President Bush’s 48-hour ultimatum to Saddam Hussein, Obama, then an Illinois state senator, warned that his country was making a horrible mistake that it would soon regret.<br /><br />That noble declaration has drawn throngs of supporters to the young and untested freshman U.S. senator. Even his most enthusiastic fans will grudgingly admit that experience is not Obama’s strength in this race. But while Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton was busy justifying her vote in favor of the joint war resolution — and Sen. John McCain’s impatient message amounted to “Faster, pussycat! Kill! Kill!” — Obama made what a majority of Americans now believe was the right call. Surely that has to count for something?<br /><br />In a just and rational universe, it might. However, a look at America’s past peace candidates should give voters pause — or at least cause for despair. These purported peaceniks have a disturbing tendency to go from the most subdued, peace-loving candidates to war-waging presidents.<br /><br />Woodrow Wilson ran for reelection in 1916 on the slogan “He kept us out of the war.” Note the past tense. Once he was back in the White House, Wilson plunged America into World War I and locked up political dissidents on a massive scale.<br /><br />Wilson was far from a rare example. Franklin D. Roosevelt promised to keep American soldiers out of foreign wars during his 1940 reelection campaign and then was forced to preside over World War II — and the Japanese internment. Lyndon Johnson painted Barry Goldwater as a dangerous, unstable warmonger who would blow up little children and flowers. Then Johnson escalated U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia into the Vietnam War.<br /><br />Republicans are missing from the list because the party doesn’t tend to run out-and-out peace candidates. Instead, it runs “win the peace” candidates, “peace through strength” candidates, “peace with honor” candidates, “keep the peace” candidates, etc.<br /><br />In fact, the closest Republicans have come to a peace candidate in a long while was George W. Bush. He was far less hawkish than Al Gore, didn’t seem to know or care much about the rest of the world and wanted a “humble foreign policy.” Gene Healy, author of “The Cult of the Presidency,” a history of the growth of executive power, recently wrote of our current president, “Part of me thinks there’s an alternate universe somewhere where the Twin Towers are standing and George W. Bush became the sort of president about whom you could say, as [H.L.] Mencken did of [Calvin] Coolidge, ‘He had no ideas and was not a nuisance.’”<br /><br />That Bush presided instead over two wars points to one fatal flaw of peace candidates, at least from a pinched, pacifist point of view: There are some wars presidents simply can’t stay out of, and most Americans — even otherwise anti-war ones — wouldn’t want them to.<br /><br />To wit, during World War II, the isolationist America First Committee disbanded after Pearl Harbor, and anti-war stalwart Charles Lindbergh requested that Roosevelt let him be part of the war effort by reinstating his military commission. After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, even Reps. Ron Paul (R-Texas) and Dennis J. Kucinich (D-Ohio) voted for the authorization of force in Afghanistan.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0608/10803.html

The War in Iraq, is part of the overall war. Iraq, was&nbsp; &nbsp;a nation we were at war with in the region. Ron Paul, a&nbsp; vociferous&nbsp; &#039;anti-war&#039; type, correctly stated&nbsp; that the case for taking out Saddam was made by the previous&nbsp; administrations&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; cease fire, signed by Iraq, which is repeatedly violated.http://www.fas.org/news/iraq/1998/11/01/981101-in.htm&nbsp; Of course&nbsp; the Bush &#039;haters&#039;&nbsp; will never&nbsp; admit it, they are blindly &#039;anti-war.&#039; The blind &#039;anti-war&#039; mob will come after&nbsp; Obama , if he shows&nbsp; any signs of rationality. Inaction on Iraq, leaving Saddam in place, while we were in Afghan , would have made the situtaion worse, their was unanimous&nbsp; agreement, until, of course, a Republican President followed&nbsp; through on it.

				If the thread is going to turn to discussion of rationales for the Iraq war, I suggest we turn to this thread: http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=10754.15<br /><br />I don&#039;t think it&#039;s very fair to categorize the Iraq war as part of an overall war, since the ties to an overall war on terrorism, or WMDs or whatever it was can really be used to justify just about any military action these days. <br /><br />I agree that there are a lot of blindly anti-war people out there who hate Bush without really knowing why. I also think there are just as many blindly pro-war folks who irrationally hate Obama for his stance on the war. <br />

The &#039;rationale&#039; was already in place in the cease fire, for a myriad&nbsp; of reasons, including WMD&#039;s, which Saddam did have and&nbsp; used&nbsp; on his own population. This is old history. <br /><br />I was&nbsp; never blindly&nbsp; &#039;pro-war&#039;, and those who are are marginalised, while&nbsp; the&nbsp; blind &#039;anti-war&#039;&nbsp; people are giving more &#039;respect.&#039; In any event, Obama has changed his stance, which is one&nbsp; thing, I have noticed. He still maintains&nbsp; it was a &#039;war that should not have been authorised and waged&#039;, which is&nbsp; incorrect IMO, but, he has&nbsp; &#039;moderated&#039; his stance of what to do about it.&nbsp; &nbsp;

Also, this is a main media&nbsp; cenetr of the nation, as is Hollywood, so the views tend to be more pronounced. I think some on the &#039;anti-war&#039; side&nbsp; are well-meaning people, but, much of the leadership is&nbsp; hardly &#039;anti-war&#039;, only &#039;anti&#039; the USA&nbsp; taking offensive action. A true &#039;anti-war&#039; person, pacifist, would be&nbsp; against war all the time. I &#039;hate&#039; war&nbsp; like anyone who has seen how it destroys, my family, relatives. But, I also understand, that there are worse things&nbsp; than war, and those include&nbsp; appeasing an enemy who would&nbsp; destroy your way of life, and enslave you. The problem in fighting this war is that it is religiously&nbsp; based, the worst sort of war. The fascists, communists, any other &#039;ism&#039; is&nbsp; based on the premise of &#039;living&#039;, this war, at least on the enemy side, is &#039;glorifying&#039; death/martyrdom. There is&nbsp; no &#039;nation&#039; based armed force, cause the enemy doesn&#039;t recognise&nbsp; &#039;nations&#039;, and they have isolated and made other beliefs, besides&nbsp; their own, punishable by death, in many cases. You pick your base of operations to remove&nbsp; this threat from future&nbsp; generations, by giving an opening to those who share&nbsp; the same faith, that has been perverted&nbsp; and distorted&nbsp; by a large minority of a radical cult of death. They have many names, &#039;Jihad&#039;, Hezbollah, the umbrella&nbsp; organization Al Qeada. This is&nbsp; highly destructive&nbsp; to not only those of other faiths, but, to the faith of Islam, which is partly based on the tenets&nbsp; of&nbsp; Judaism and Christianity. It&#039;s&nbsp; basically&nbsp; a &#039;family&#039; fight, the human family, and you and I know how ugly that can get and how far you have to go to stop it.<br /><br />I agree, having rational&nbsp; discussion, about &#039;rationale&#039;(I do know the difference)&nbsp; &nbsp;:wink:, is paramount. My concern is once&nbsp; you are in battle, you don&#039;t create more harm, by basing your opposition by destroying the mission. No war ever happens as&nbsp; &#039;planned&#039;, even the&nbsp; &#039;good&#039;&nbsp; wars&nbsp; like WW 2, where&nbsp; was Adolf&#039;s &#039;secret&#039; weapon? During the war,few&nbsp; were running around denouncing FDR&nbsp; about detention and interment or the &#039;mistakes&#039; on intelligence&nbsp; as&nbsp; &#039;lies&#039;, murderer and &#039;satan&#039;, as I see continually from many on the so-called &#039;anti-war&#039; side. The thing is&nbsp; Afghanistan, where&nbsp; the Taliban&nbsp; took over after we stopped&nbsp; supporting less radical elements, not because&nbsp; we went to war. Saddam was about to go sanctionless and have new &#039;contracts&#039; with the Euro&nbsp; economy, newly created market of&nbsp; nearly 500 Million in Europe. Leaving him there, while we let him off the hook after 12 years of violating a cease fire, would have us&nbsp; &#039;surrounded&#039; on the Afghan/Paki border. Bin Laden was a symptom of&nbsp; the radical &#039;Islamic&#039;&nbsp; revolution started&nbsp; in the 70&#039;s&nbsp; in Iran. This is no lie, and miscalculations&nbsp; are more likely to happen, than when dealing with &#039;nation&#039; enemy. This is a worldwide&nbsp; movement, war in Afghan/Iraq, is&nbsp; a start in changing and giving hope to Muslim folks in that region, but, the enemy was here, living amongst&nbsp; us for years, in relative peace, in the 1990&#039;s. they ate our food, even drank our&nbsp; wine(hypocritical since it&#039;s supposedly against their faith), even visited&nbsp; prostitutes, before 19 flew planes&nbsp; into the WTC. It was the culmination of inaction, of &#039;anti-war&#039;&nbsp; negotiation since&nbsp; the appeasement of the 1970&#039;s&nbsp; that led to&nbsp; the Iranian revolution.<br /><br />This&nbsp; is&nbsp; far more&nbsp; reaching than the Afghan/Paki border, Iraq, Pres. Bush or even Obama and McCain. It&#039;s about where&nbsp; the world&nbsp; will head. Many faiths&nbsp; had their&nbsp; &#039;dark&#039; ages, but, those&nbsp; happened at a time&nbsp; of stone, bronze, sword and shield. This is&nbsp; fare more&nbsp; dangerous, and the access makes&nbsp; being &#039;anti-war&#039;, much more dangerous, than talking the fight to them, now, before&nbsp; it becomes&nbsp; worse.
