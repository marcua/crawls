Nearly half live in Florida.<br /><br />But those numbers are deceptive.<br /><br />In 2005, 10,645 Venezuelans received their green cards allowing them to live in the United States, almost doubling the 6,222 who received them in 2004, according to the latest Department of Homeland Security statistics. And another 400,000 Venezuelans came to the United States in 2005 on business and tourism visas. It is unclear how many stayed.<br /><br />Colombia, with nearly twice Venezuela&#039;s roughly 27 million residents, sent the same number that year.<br /><br />Anecdotal evidence suggests even more are seeking to come here since Chavez&#039;s recent nationalization of Venezuela&#039;s largest telecommunications company and the electricity sector. <br /><strong>The Venezuelan Congress also recently gave him special powers to decree laws for 18 months, and Chavez is threatening to expropriate supermarkets, stores and other businesses caught hoarding food or speculating on prices.</strong><br /><br />...

				That&#039;s why I left Miami.&nbsp; Although I&#039;m part Cuban.&nbsp; It seems that everytime there&#039;s a problem somewhere everyone ends up going where?&nbsp; You guessed it, Miami -- Florida.&nbsp; There are NO JOBS in Miami, zilch.<br /><br />I feel bad for the people already living there.&nbsp; To them it means less jobs.<br /><br />

				I always thought that America benefited from such situations, especially since they often come with increased skills and education.<br /><br />Brilliant, educated jews who came here because of Hitler,<br />Hard working, resourceful Cubans who came here because of Castro,<br />The Greek backbone of Astoria who came here because of the Junta,<br />Wealthy Venezuelans who came here because of Chavez.<br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;m with you 100%.&nbsp; I have NOTHING against people coming from other countries to find a better life and the U.S. IS mostly made up of immigrants (starting with the Pilgrims).<br /><br />What I meant to say (having lived there for 25 years) is that Miami has not kept up with the people.&nbsp; The City is basically bankrupt.&nbsp; There are no new jobs, as a matter of fact a lot of companies have pulled out of Miami.&nbsp; You have a few companies in the Tampa area, but that&#039;s about it.<br /><br />So it&#039;s not that it&#039;s a bad that they&#039;re coming to the U.S., it&#039;s bad that they&#039;re not spreading out and going to toher States.&nbsp; Miami has no money as it is, the resources are very limited.
