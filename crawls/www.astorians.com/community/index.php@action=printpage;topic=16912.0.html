				I don&#039;t know what you consider reasonable but Vesta has a prix fixe on Christmas Eve for $40/person (or $60/person with wine pairing). Menu looks fabulous - they are somewhat keeping with the traditional feast of the 7 fishes so there&#039;s a lot of delicious seafood on the menu. I believe I also saw that Bistro Les Minots was having a prix fixe. Just check out their posting on here. I haven&#039;t been to Bistro yet so I cannot comment as to its atmosphere, but I think Vesta would be a lovely Christmas Eve experience.

				If you HAVE TO go to Manhattan, Rosa Mexicano has great Mexican food-and margaritas. They&#039;re having a special on gift cards, today being the last day of the promotion, and you can only order on line. If you purchase a $100 gift card you get $30 extra for free. I already got mine! Plan on going after Christmas, though. I like the location on 1st Ave. <br /><br />https://rosamexicano.com/Default.aspx?tabid=315&amp;ProductID=23

				We are going to Rolf&#039;s on Christmas Eve.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard the decor is super cheesy and the food is decent.

				Cara Bella on the corner of 47th Street and 30th ave has a nice warm, romantic feel to it.&nbsp; Very good food also.

				I&#039;m taking my family to Stove on Christmas.&nbsp; 28th ave and 45th street.&nbsp; really really delicious and nice.<br /><br />My detailed review from my last visit, Christmas &#039;07<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=8787.msg106455.html#msg106455">Quote from: alyssa726 on December 25, 2007, 06:54:02 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">went to stove for an early Christmas dinner today, and it was awesome.<br /><br />first of all, i was impressed when we walked in: really nice bar, white table clothes, simple but lovely decor, all that, but not pretentious at all.<br /><br />food was amazing.&nbsp; they offered a Christmas menu. i had a salad, this neat sole, crab, shrimp thing, and the sherry trifle. my dad had the soup, filet mignon, and apple pie a la mode.&nbsp; &nbsp;both came with a melon and prosciutto appetizer and entrees were served with mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, green beans and turnips, (yes, turnips!&nbsp; i hadn&#039;t had those since i was in Ireland 5 years ago, so i was really excited... they were delish, and after chatting with our server found out that Stove is Irish owned and the chef is from Kilkenny).<br /><br />here&#039;s the best part, for two complete meals and a bottle of decent wine, the bill was under $100!&nbsp; the set dinner was only $30something.<br /><br />i would definitely recommend stove.&nbsp; great, friendly service to boot.<br /><br />thanks for bearing with me through my turnip digression.<br /><br />&nbsp;:-)<br /><br />ps, my dad liked the coffee, and he is mr. picky-coffee-guy<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
