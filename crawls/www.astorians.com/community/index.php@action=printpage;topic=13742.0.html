				I still miss Valco.&nbsp; The last purchase I made there (a few months before they closed) was a Mego Buck Rogers in the 25th Century &quot;Draco&quot; action figure (from 1979) that had been sitting behind a box for at least ten years.&nbsp; I paid just $2.00 for it and I still have it in my collection (still on the card).<br /><br />In the 70&#039;s, I remember a hobby store on 37th or 38th Street (I think) that had model kits and rocket kits; but I am not referring to the hobby shop on 36th street still in operation (they put old books on the front of the store) and from the inside looks like it was once an old soda shop (complete with a bar).<br /><br />Playworld had a great collection of model kits (an entire section) of every size and scale, including Testor&#039;s brand paint, glue, sandpaper, etc.&nbsp; Their Kenner Star Wars section (figures, playsets, vehicles) was nirvana.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=13742.msg164593.html#msg164593">Quote from: astoria-for-life on January 21, 2009, 06:01:31 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">here we go!!!

				Wow, those names bring back some great memories.&nbsp; I used to LOVE going to those stores when I was a kid.&nbsp; When I was good, my Dad would take me there and allow me to buy stuff.&nbsp; It&#039;s too bad those stores went out of business so long ago.<br /><br />Also reminds me of the &#039;ol TSS store across from MPB.&nbsp; I&#039;d just hang out in the sporting goods section for the longest!!&nbsp; Another store I miss.&nbsp;

				I remember all of them.When I was a kid we called Valco&#039;s &quot;Cheap Charlie&#039;s&quot;.I don&#039;t know why,maybe there was a store there with that name previously and our parents just kept calling it that.

				&nbsp; ABB, I too, remember my parents, Aunts, Uncles and cousins all referring to Valco&#039;s as &quot;Cheap Charlie&#039;s in the 70&#039;s.&nbsp; I remember walking up Steinway Street when I was a kid, and getting very excited when we passed by, although we were usually on the other side of the street.&nbsp; I also remember looking all around for any indication that it had &quot;Cheap Charlie&#039;s&quot; anywhere in its name.&nbsp; Being brought in by my parents or my Uncle and Aunt was always like winning the lottery for me!&nbsp; This pleasant memory just reminded me to ask them why they called it Cheap Charlie&#039;s.

				Don&#039;t forget Treasure Cove, which was where Taverna Kyclades is now....&nbsp; &nbsp;And on Steinway, which hardly anyone remembers- Cookie Kingdom- It was where the bank next to Starbucks is now. They used to have all sorts of cookies and the outside looked like a castle. We used to BEG my mom to take us there.&nbsp; One of my favorite memories is of Perry&#039;s Delight, the ice cream shop that was on the corner of 31st Street and 24th Ave. I would LOVE to have a picture of that place!!!&nbsp;

				I worked at Valco&#039;s from 1970-72. The manager was Bill who married Stella, a beautiful greek girl from Astoria&nbsp; actually I think she lived on Steinway street. The assistant manager was Anthony Boniciolli who I married in 73. Mary Klaiber, Frank Demato, Gabe, Jeff, another Mary and Clarence who was the stock manager. The Wieners owned it, I think his name was Hyman. He had two sons and they opened down the street a children&#039;s furniture shop, Frank Demato was a manger for awhile. I have found Frank Demato over the years, but have not found anyone else..If anyone knew or knows any of these people, please email me..Thanks Joanne

				Yes, to the left of the parking lot.&nbsp; My wife&#039;s grandmother used to take her there as part of their weekend routine. <br />Good to read how many of us have fond memories of growing up in the area. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;
