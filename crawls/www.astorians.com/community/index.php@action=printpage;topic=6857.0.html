				Thought it would be interesting to get astorians reaction to this letter sent to a local paper:<br /><br />http://www.timesledger.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=18529326&amp;BRD=2676&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=542861&amp;rfi=6<br />------------------------<br /><br />06/28/2007<br /><br />Four clues your community is facing urban deterioration <br /><br />As a lifelong New Yorker, I have seen many neighborhoods disintegrate. The answer to urban blight in the Bloomberg-era is gentrification, but that is no solution for most people. The solution is to get out before it is too late. <br /><br />Based on my experience, I have identified four sure signs that a neighborhood is on its way to destruction. Here they are:<br /><br />1. There is population instability. Moving vans and do-it-yourself truck rentals clog the streets. You seldom recognize anyone who lives in your neighborhood because folks are constantly moving in and out. Renters outnumber owners, and few people seem to have a stake in the place, or want to establish roots there. Landlords start renting to people who are unlikely to stay very long, because they want to re-rent the property for more money. People who buy property are already thinking of selling it for a profit.<br /><br />2. There is a proliferation of fast food, all-night delis and convenience stores. This connects to population instability, because establishments that cater to spur-of-the-moment eating and shopping habits cater to people who lack a stable family structure. Where there are intact families, there are everyday rituals and set times for doing things. <br /><br />3. There is a crumbling infrastructure. The roads and streets and sidewalks go into disrepair, mostly from overuse, but no one cares enough to complain. Since so few people consider the place their permanent home, they see themselves as just passing through, and as a result, nothing gets fixed. If you spot a forever-broken traffic light in a heavily travelled area such as the one on 23rd Avenue, things can only get worse.<br /><br />4. Quality of life issues are ignored. When you start to see graffiti, broken windows, crumbling buildings, litter on the streets, and a general atmosphere of filth, noise and slop, and the local authorities are not flooded with complaints from angry citizens, crime and mayhem soon follow.<br /><br />Of course, it would be a noble thing to stay and fight for what was once a charming neighborhood, but to do that, you would have to find like-minded folks who cared enough.<br /><br />And how can you do that when nobody knows who their neighbors are, or even wants to know?<br /><br />John Borrillo<br />

				I think a lot of it just has to do with your specific location.&nbsp; I used to live right by the corner of Ditmars and Crescent up until a few years ago.&nbsp; I can say that living there was no fun.&nbsp; The deli on the other corner was usually open 24-7, especially during the warm weather months, and that attracted all sorts of losers who would go to the park to booze up at night.&nbsp; Many of them were drunk/on drugs, and I can recall several different incidents where there were fights, broken glass, shouting matches, and police being called.&nbsp; One specific incident had one drunken group of guys stop at the deli to go after another drunken group that was there with metal pipes, breaking several car windows along the way and beating this one guy to a bloody pulp.<br /><br />Then, with the bars across the street, people standing outside chatting and smoking at 3 in the morning was getting annoying if you were trying to fall asleep just across the street.&nbsp; Ditto the car service that was there, whose drivers would sit outside and chat all night, leave their cars double parked for hours, knock off mirrors from cars from not parking carefully, etc.<br /><br />The high school across the street was a real mess too.&nbsp; I once saw two students from there actually shoplift some cakes from the deli one morning and walk out.&nbsp; There were also a few occasions where there would actually be fights in the middle of the street.<br /><br />For about a year or so, there was also this really shady &quot;nightclub&quot; that operated under the cover of darkness, on Crescent next to the car service.&nbsp; Police busted that one up finally one night, and it later became a music school.<br /><br />Plus, hearing the deafening roar of motorcycles zipping past to get to Astoria Park, and all sorts of morons who would stop at the deli or pizzeria and leave their sound systems blasting in their cars made the whole scene unbearable.<br /><br />And yet, if one went just half a block down Crescent, you would have none of those problems.&nbsp; So it really just depends on specific location.&nbsp; Fortunately for me, I&#039;m no longer living at that crazy intersection.

				Every few years things get bad for a while.&nbsp; About 10 years ago, in summer, a-holes would sit on the benches, break beer bottles, and get in drunken fights.&nbsp; Calls to the police did nothing.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what happened, it just seemed to stop.&nbsp; One winter the drug dealer living with the chronically drunk mentally ill woman on the first floor of my building would blast their music system to all hours and we had to sleep with ac on to drown it out.&nbsp; Then he realized that if he stopped doing that the police would stop showing up at his door.&nbsp; The housing authority was finally able to get her out of the building, and there he went, too, but it took long enough.<br /><br />

				Why, yes. Astoria is definitely full of crime, graffiti, noise, lack of electricity and all kinds of derilects. That&#039;s why it&#039;s a thoroughly undesireable place to live. Plus, the rents keep going up. I say we need to publish MORE stories about it! Because a few years ago, when some community marketing guru told all those lies about how cool it is, rents began to climb and all those condos started being built.<br /><br />It&#039;s about time the truth was exposed and the rent prices adjusted accordingly&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				You know, really, I wanted to think this urban decay/over development/exploding population crisis was silly nonsense when I first saw it a few years ago -- and I made a practice to avoid these threads.&nbsp; Honestly though, I can&#039;t dismiss it without a second though now.&nbsp; While the influx of new folks is perhaps not the root of all evil -- and neither are a few new buildings or a few new &quot;Astoria amenities&quot;, the collective impact of the rise in popularity of Astoria as a place to live and the lack of support (utility/electric/transportation) is a not-pretty trend.&nbsp; Infill housing is popping up (the uglification) on formerly single and two family home blocks, condo conversions, increasing rents...&nbsp; it&#039;s a questionable change.&nbsp; <br /><br />On the one hand the existence of this board does suggest that there is a greater feel of community -- but on the other, it also is evidence of change in population demographic for Astoria.&nbsp; Community establishments close (Keystone - 25 years?) in the blink of an eye to give rise to &quot;new&quot; and in-demand spots (vegan healthfood?) that can afford the increasing rents but might not have the long term staying power.&nbsp; I&#039;ve cheered for the change (vegan healthfood!&nbsp; in Astoria!) because I really do want to see Astoria grow and I&#039;m excited to support these new neighborhood businesses.&nbsp; But that&#039;s just it -- &quot;new neighborhood&quot; means something is happening to distinguish it from the old.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have any clear ideas really one way or the other yet.&nbsp; All I know is I&#039;m not dismissing the crazy urban decay talk offhand.

				It&#039;s great that so many people responded to my letter. It means I&#039;m actually saying something, as opposed to merely offering a report on my emotional state or why I feel so good about living in the big City. Let&#039;s start by getting a few things out of the way. First, I love Astoria, or what&#039;s left of it, and that&#039;s why I bother to write. I want people to see what I see and I want to see some of these trends reversed. <br />I&#039;m aware that there are lots of twentysomethings with college degrees using the place as a dorm room and the fact that it&#039;s so close to Manhattan means that they think they&#039;re in paradise. But a community should never be defined by how close it is to someplace else; it needs to have its own character. People shouldn&#039;t confuse nostalgia with historical memory:&nbsp; It really was a much better place years ago.

				Astoria is going down hill so homeowners, before the value of your property devaluates or gets destroyed by gang members SELL SELL SELL, especially those of you that have been there for 30 years and only paid $25,000.00 for your home...sell it for $200,000, you&#039;re still making a profit but most importantly...saving your lives!<br /><br />Horrible place to live, people should start moving out and renting elsewhere!<br /><br />&nbsp;:evil:

				Actually, it had a charming character, but like most of the rest of the City, it&#039;s being emptied of its uniqueness by a number of factors, most of all by mindless money-grubbing. <br />First, I want to point out that I love college-educated people; in fact, I taught college for many years. It&#039;s great that so many college-educated young folks who are being priced out of Manhattan are living here now, but there is a difference between &quot;crashing&quot; somewhere and making a home. Turning the place into a dorm environment benefits no one, except the greedy landlords. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been living in the area for over ten years now, and I&#039;m still wondering what the local politicians actually do. If they cared about the communities they supposedly represent,&nbsp; they would be proposing legislation to clamp down on illegal rentals and organizing candlelight vigils at City Hall every time the lights went out. Astoria is now the province of the powerless and the just passing through. Who knows, though, the kind of folks who made the neighborhood what it was may yet come back, when they get sick of the suburbs and long for the camaraderie and the richness of life in what was once a real global village.

				The part of Astoria I&#039;m in (lower Ditmars by the river and Astoria Park) still has a lot of the original owners BUT in the past year and a half I have seen a lot more &quot;for sale&quot; signs and it&#039;s sad because in the past people used to stay in their homes for years (decades) and a lot of these homes are &quot;pass downs&quot; from parents, grandparents....<br /><br />I grew up in Astoria and love it (I came back after being absent for 25 years...so that should say a lot) and I have no objection to it changing and that now there are so many different ethnicities living here, it&#039;s a wonderful thing.<br /><br />What I don&#039;t like is how many of the homes in the historical part of Astoria that were original Astoria Mansions have been torn down to make way to ugly new buildings, I don&#039;t like to see how homes are being turned into two and three family residences and the owners/landlords are stuffing apartments with people that are looking for &quot;temporary&quot; residence (out by the time they graduate).<br /><br />Even though Astoria is more &quot;hip&quot; than it was years ago, it is losing that &quot;family&quot; aspect of it which is sad.<br /><br />It&#039;s all about money and greed and the worst part is the a lot of these people are long time 2nd and 3rd generation Astorians...don&#039;t they care?<br /><br />

				The native Astorians, too many of them anyway,&nbsp; don&#039;t care. If they did, they would be protecting the community. Something happened in the 70&#039;s; the &quot;ME&quot; mentality took hold and now the older folks are suffering from the same cultural dementia as the rest of the society.<br />What are they going to do with all this money they&#039;re making on the illegal rentals and conversions? Perhaps, like the Ancient Egyptians, they believe in a material afterlife, and they&#039;ll need to take it all with them as they cross into eternity.<br />Sad commentary when the generation that should know better leads us into the desert rather than out of it.

				I&quot;ve only been in Astoria for five years, but my husband was born and raised, living here for 35, which is why we bought a house here. He has the opposite to report. The area is becoming more varied in terms of ethnicity, however, certain areas are becoming incredibly beautiful, well-taken care of, and are conducive to families. For example, we went to the fireworks show in Astoria park, and it was lovely. My husband reports that ten-15 years ago, families just couldn&#039;t go. It was dangerous, and the element was very shady, with fights, a lot of drinking and many other &quot;uncouth&quot; elements rallying around. This past week, it was something to be shown on Sesame Street.<br /><br />Certain areas are shady, but the area appears to be improving. Maybe the remodeling and overabundance of housing is hurting the look of it, and I think some of the indicators mentioned are worthy of attention, spurring locals like us to watch out for them and take action as needed, as I think many of the people on this board do (or at least they say they do). <br /><br />And we will not be selling (despitethe very cunning attempts. :)) Our property value has doubled since we bought five years ago. Astoria must be doin something right.

				Lived in Astoria from 1973 to 1993 and this is what I remember:<br /><br />Filth, trash, garbage worse than it is now.<br />Culturally dead, nothing going on.<br />Would never go into Astoria Park.<br />Entire busses coming into the parking lot of the Park and thousands of people using the pool and leaving trash behind.<br />No sophistication at all (I could not speak to anyone about art and literature).&nbsp; Some of you complain about not having a bookstore.&nbsp; Folks, I remember having a hard time finding the New York Times!!!, and not because they were sold out.<br />The only place people went to for vacations were the Poconos and Mattituck.&nbsp; I used to call Mattituck &#039;Astoria on vacation&#039;.<br /><br />I am sorry if I sound like a snob but I am here now because I witnessed a positive change.&nbsp; Yes, it is getting far more crowded and I can&#039;t park anywhere, but I would never trade this Astoria for the old one.&nbsp; This Astoria makes a middle aged woman feel like she is living in a vibrant community where things are happening!&nbsp; I have met so many interesting people (you have to make the effort) and we chat about theater, books, music, art etc.&nbsp; In years past, I spent most of my time in Manhattan.&nbsp; Working there is enough, I don&#039;t have to go there for food or entertainment.&nbsp; I love it here!<br />

				There is nothing wrong with being single. In fact, it&#039;s lots of fun, from what I remember, but that&#039;s not the point. The point is, the character of a neighborhood is determined by its demographics. If you have too many single people in a neighborhood without ties, or a real stake in the place, aside from its proximity to the Manhattan club scene, it becomes a dorm environment. What I meant by intact families is the opposite of &quot;my family lives 6 hours from me.&quot; As for generalizations, we would do much better if the local clubhouse politicians would generalize from their own narrow experience of wearing $800 dollar suits and living in carefully protected enclaves and got out there and tried to put a stop to the destruction of a once-charming place. It&#039;s hypocritical to say that you love the place, if you wouldn&#039;t want to bring up kids here and have them go to low-performing public schools and grow up in an atomsphere of slop. People should make a distinction between change and decay. Astoria isn&#039;t &quot;changing&quot;; that&#039;s too romantic. It&#039;s decaying.

				I think we all see what we want to see.&nbsp; Personally, I think Astoria is doing well, is diversifying, and changing in a postive way; it doesn&#039;t mean that EVERY change is good, but a lot of them are.&nbsp; I guess I&#039;m not of the mind to say that Astoria is deteriorating.&nbsp; It&#039;s a great town - why give up on it?<br /><br />&quot;Dorm environment&quot; is the newest in a line of phrases being tossed about in Queens.&nbsp; I think this is happening to give the phrase baggage and eventually will be used more broadly as a verbal weapon.&nbsp; It&#039;s a term of intolerance, at the very least.<br /><br />I find it odd that you take issue with long time residents who don&#039;t care, yet at the same time you blast young single people for not caring.&nbsp; There&#039;s an inconsistency there.<br /><br />But like I said, we all see what we want to see.

				Quite frankly, I&#039;m growing tired of the naysayers who keep trying to convince us in vague and doomsday terms that Astoria is going downhill. &nbsp;And toward what end? &nbsp;For those who believe that Astoria is facing urban decay, it will always be a self-fulfilling prophecy. &nbsp;If you have a specific issue that you wish to discuss, such as littering or graffiti, then fine. &nbsp;Otherwise, what is the point??<br /><br />As for myself, I love Astoria and my neighborhood in particular because of its diversity - we have all sorts of people in my neighborhood, singles and families, young people and retirees, people from all racial and ethnic backgrounds. &nbsp;So I would have to disagree that a neighborhood is defined only by &quot;intact families.&quot; &nbsp;We all have a choice and a stake in creating our neighorhood, and my neighbors and I *do* know and care about one another.<br /><br />As a graduate student, I know that my stay in Astoria will be temporary, as dictated by the academic job market, but it doesn&#039;t mean that I&#039;m contributing to the &quot;decay&quot; of Astoria. &nbsp;It&#039;s unrealistic to demand that people should live their entire lives in the place where they were born and equally unrealistic to believe that people who live in a place for a temporary period of time don&#039;t care about building a community.

				I like Astoria. NO, I will not be raising children there for the simple reason that I NEVER want children. I like upstate, where I am from but do I want to raise kids there? NOPE. If I had kids, would I raise them in Astoria? Sure but I have made the personal choice to NOT do the kids and family thing.

				To clarify the decaying school theory, this is actually not true in Astoria, and Astoria has two of the top ten ranked elementary school programs. I have observed and consulted in many schools in both Queens, Brooklyn and Long Island, and Long Island school districts I was LEAST impressed with. The board of education is actually improving. There are still lots of problems, and schools that are underfunded with significantly underpaid and undersupported staff, but this is not a phenomenon unique to Queens, and certainly not unique to Astoria. I&#039;m sick of the &quot;bad schools can&#039;t raise kids here&quot; argument.

				My original letter was published in the print media; that&#039;s where it should have stayed. I&#039;ve enjoyed the give and take, but, because it&#039;s so easy to &quot;rant, &quot;&nbsp; what began as a serious debate has devolved into a sniping match among the computer literate. The loss of a neighborhood I loved and still live in is too serious a matter for the kind of silliness that denies reality in favor of &quot;looking on the bright side&quot; and other assorted cliche&#039;s and stock phrases. Nonetheless, just so that no one accuses me of being a&nbsp; whiner or a &quot;naysayer&quot; I want to relate a conversation that took place this past week between me and a staff member from a local politician&#039;s office regarding a quality of life complaint I filed.<br /><br />Staff person: &quot;I&#039;m calling from .......Office regarding the graffiti situation.&quot;<br /><br />Me: That was a while ago. You&#039;re just getting back to me now?&quot;<br /><br />Staff person: &quot;Just where is this graffiti you mentioned in your email?&quot;<br /><br />Me. &quot;It&#039;s all up and down 23rd avenue. I called the local police precinct and they sent a squad car to my apartment, which was embarrassing. <br /><br />Staff person: &quot;When you say &#039;up and down&#039; 23rd Avenue, can you be more specific?&quot;<br /><br />Me. How specific do you want me to be? Why doesn&#039;t he [the politician in question] take a ride up and down the block and see it for himself. It&#039;s bad enough he couldn&#039;t do anything to get the lights back on last year. It seems like the least he can do.&quot; <br /><br />Staff person: &quot;Well, it&#039;s not like we can just go and clean up graffiti, if it&#039;s on private property.&quot;<br /><br />So much for civic involvement.<br /><br /><br />

				John,<br /><br />I think it&#039;s just that your approach has seemed very negative toward younger, single people who aren&#039;t from Astoria but like to live here and, really, that&#039;s a big part of who&#039;s on this board. Plus, the people on this board who are married with families and looking to stick around seem to like the rest of us just fine. When you come and say that the only intact family is one that lives so many minutes away from each other, you&#039;re calling a lot of families that are good, caring, complete families &quot;not intact.&quot;<br /><br />You&#039;re not arguing with a serious intent to find a compromise or a solution to save your neighborhood; you&#039;re standing up strawman and ad hominem arguements and putting people in a place where they feel like they have to defend themselves.<br /><br />If you&#039;d like to have a serious discussion about what we can do to keep this a vibrant, wonderful neighborhood, the first step is to speak to the positive things we can do to make changes rather than griping about your neighbors.

				<br />http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=6988.0<br /><br />Once again it seems that astorians.com, for better or worse, does reflect this community. <br /><br />Some of you have been to a community board meeting or a precinct council meeting, and, as you have observed yourselves, shouting down someone and trying to silence them as they bring in some thoughtful points is less than helpful.&nbsp; <br /><br />Remember when the lights went out last summer? More than one person has said to me how shocked they were to see cameras panning around&nbsp; an all but empty meeting room in public hearing after hearing. The whole city witnessed that sad spectacle – and took careful notes. <br /><br />Where were all of you? <br /><br />And simply parroting what the politicians said, as so many residents did, while café after café took down its walls and pumped air-conditioning into the open air, or by turning a blind eye as your neighbors subdivide their basements, or by remaining mute as some developer takes down a house for a 12 story monster in your backyard says volumes about a community – your silence speaks loudly. <br /><br />Thousands of residential units have been proposed for this community last summer. Silvercup is even taking down a generator to put up a number of 40 story buildings …. And not even a puff of concern for the grid?<br /><br />We have all noted that time and again, when something happens, everyone is all fired up and ready to go to the community council or the like, then disappoint us as it peters out in a few weeks. We have seen groups around the community hold meetings to discuss issues. How many of you show up?<br /><br />In politics, the squeaky wheel gets the grease. Doormats gets the shaft. And yes, I agree with a central tenant in his essay: a passive community is a dying community. <br /><br />Whether you accept the obvious or not, there are problems in this community and there are trends that are not so positive. Just read the papers and listen to the local politicians for confirmation.<br /><br />Rather than BLOGGING to gloss over or ignore everything, or sadly attack those that even raise talking points, as you probably will me,&nbsp; why don’t you GET INVOLVED by actually looking into issues, thinking about them beyond your immediate experience, discussing them with others, and trying to come up with ideas?<br /><br />A successful community does not happen on its own. Democracy is not a spectator sport. And if you love something, be it a car, a child, or a neighborhood, you will get passionate about it and take care of it. <br /><br />I never met the fellow that wrote this, nor do I agree with everything he says, but I respect what he says. Because, unlike his naysayers, he makes me think.<br />

				Perhaps, just perhaps, it&#039;s time to stop negative nodding Gleason and listen to what he has to say. So much of it makes a lot of sense. Astoria has always been my home, and I am troubled by the lack of young people willing to get involved in her future. Bitching and whining is not the way things get done. Going to meetings and being bored, or not raising points, or not getting your point across is not productive. If this is your home, if Astoria is your future, you need to speak up and be heard. Participate in her future. The generations that came before you did; you need to do it also. If Astoria is just a stopping off point for you, then everything that Gleason says will be prophetic. <br /><br />The cafes are still blasting their air conditioners with their doors and walls open! You and I are the ones who will suffer if the grid goes down again. It&#039;s too easy to blame ConEd for all the problems. We need to make our Community Board take notice of our concerns. We need to make the 114th Precinct aware of our concerns, and make them responsible for fixing some problems. <br /><br />I love this community. I love what is represents. People need to find the time to not only attend meetings, but voice concerns and demand action to save Astoria for generations to come. In the past 5 years rental apartments have skyrocketed to prices that are not feasible for most individual renters. The market will always ask for more, and if people are willing to give it, it will keep on asking for more. Building expensive housing is not the solution to the housing problem in Astoria. <br /><br />Can&#039;t we have a reasonable discussion about our Community without all this back-stabbing and negative nodding? Can&#039;t we listen to each other&#039;s concern&#039;s without judging?

				I think when some of our local politicians see me coming, they turn the other way!&nbsp; I officially am a &#039;pain in the ass&#039;, and I do not mind.&nbsp; Through letters and phone calls, I was able to get things done for the community.&nbsp; If anyone wants to know how or what, I would be happy to share the information.&nbsp; My feeling is that the Community Board needs a facelift and that some of us should try to join.&nbsp; There are numerous forums, community groups, meetings one can join.&nbsp; I agree that blogging sometimes turns into a &#039;bitching session&#039; and nothing comes of it.&nbsp; If there is a &#039;smell&#039; on Ditmars, for goodness sake, let&#039;s find out where it&#039;s coming from instead of discussing the smell ad-nauseum.&nbsp; What did it smell like?&nbsp; Where did you smell it?&nbsp; What time did you smell it?&nbsp; Was it a whiff or did it choke you?&nbsp; etc.&nbsp; Instead, call the EPA or Vallone&#039;s office, let them know what&#039;s happening and follow up.&nbsp; This is how I got some issues resolved.

				I&#039;m all for an open mind and making the community better (and I do agree with people including Gleason on some points about neighborhood problems), but I must admit it&#039;s a bit hard to see past the irony sometimes of the self-proclaimed &quot;real&quot; residents complaining about the fact that us &quot;young people&quot; don&#039;t do anything but complain.<br /><br />In my opinion it&#039;s going to be difficult to build community and a sense of ownership within the context of posting on an online community board behind a cloak of anonymity to tell people they are doing nothing, or that they aren&#039;t representative of the &quot;real&quot; Astoria.<br /><br />If complaining and discussing community problems isn&#039;t &quot;doing&quot; anything, then why do it? If this community does not represent Astoria at large, then why post here? The answer I believe is that writing about problems <strong>is</strong> doing something, and that this online community <strong>does</strong> represent the community at large - otherwise local activists (and I mean that in a good sense) like Gleason wouldn&#039;t be here, and wouldn&#039;t be using this board to complain about the complainers.<br /><br />Just because people aren&#039;t gathering in living rooms, marching on city hall, and burning bras doesn&#039;t mean they aren&#039;t doing anything - and I personally don&#039;t appreciate being talked to as though I don&#039;t care. The world has changed, I&#039;d like to suggest that people are in fact doing &quot;things&quot;, but that they are doing it in different ways than some might approve of.

Just because people post here doesn&#039;t mean they aren&#039;t doing anything. They may just not use the board as a journal of all the things they are doing.<br /><br />That being said though, I do think that the sharing of ideas is indeed doing something (and I think that is self-evident by this very post). Not everyone engages in the political process in the same way. Some people write editorials, give speeches, talk to their friends, hand out flyers, support businesses that represent their views, and some just research and <strong>vote</strong> (and they use boards like this to formulate their views). I don&#039;t think it&#039;s fair to criticize those people who don&#039;t &quot;make phone calls&quot; just because someone thinks it&#039;s more effective than engaging the political process through public discourse. It&#039;s elitist and mildly offensive in my humble opinion to take that position. This kind of rhetoric is counter-productive to the cause of building community and raising awareness in my humble opinion.<br /><br />Again, if political discussion online is of no value and changes nothing, then why do it? Herein lies the irony for me; that someone can argue that public discourse is of no value and changes nothing - but they are trying to motivate and persuade people through public discourse on the very website they disparage. If public discourse is of no value, then by all means please feel free to take that advice to heart.<br /><br />I disagree with that position. I think that discourse here (and in any public setting) has great value, and does promote change. If that weren&#039;t my position I wouldn&#039;t be here, nor would I be engaging the people who are complaining about the complainers.

				The sharing of ideas is welcome.&nbsp; Complaining without any outcome may or may not be useless.&nbsp; I find all the posts about the smells particularly useless if no one does anything about it.&nbsp; If someone does make a call, it would be great to know the outcome.&nbsp; Again, going on and on about a bad smell does not really result in any action.

Going on and on about the smell may make some reader (who doesn&#039;t post here for example) more likely to make a call than they would have before reading it. Or it may make some politician who reads it realize how many of their constituents are upset by it. Or it might make our site rank well in Google for &quot;smelly astoria&quot; so that when people start searching for the cause of the smell they come across our site and realize they are not alone in hating the smell. It&#039;s not like this board lives in a vacuum. There are 5,000+ visitors a month, and less than 1,000 regulars. That&#039;s 5 to 1 readers to posters. Saying something does do something - it&#039;s just a bit more viral in nature than I think you give credit for.<br /><br />Sorry for the rapid response here - I&#039;ll let someone else chime in. :)

				Merm is right.<br /><br />Boards like this work because its an easy portal into community events. &nbsp;Many people who are involved locally utilize this board every day to get the word out for their pet cause whether its charging to enter the pool or charging to drive into the city &nbsp;:evil: &nbsp;McDirk, Debbie, AstoriaLuv, Myself, Alexa, Frappe, etc etc, I think its safe to say we are all actively involved in one project or another that we feel is important, and we bring that info here, at least to educate and hopefully to get folks to write letters and so forth. &nbsp;Its best to get involved directly, like Debbie described, but you can&#039;t expect everyone to do that, and some of the comments along the lines of get involved are a little condescending and I think actually repel people from whatever cause you may be pushing now or later.&nbsp; You can force people to behave the way you want, but you can persuede.&nbsp;<br /><br />I moved here 6 1/2 years ago from the PA suburbs, I&#039;m white, work in the entertainment industry and would not be considered by some people a real resident, or even a real New Yorker, but I do participate, very actively, and this board has helped. Internet forums like this are a nearly pure form of democracy where people can write whatever nonsense or common sense they want and reach out to a stranger on the other side of the screen. &nbsp;They are effective for getting people involved and will continue to do so. &nbsp;I hope that our local politicians take the time to have an aide peruse these boards b/c boards like these are a smart way to see what people are saying, and in that way, complaining could be heard. &nbsp;Maybe some of us should write a letter to our local leaders and let them know about our happy little internet community here after all following a board like this is no different that keeping up on the letters page in the local paper. &nbsp;Another scarier example of the effectiveness of internet boards, is that this is how many Islamic terrorists communicate to one another from country to country, and it seems to work for their recruitment.<br /><br />Not everyone is going to be involved. &nbsp;Most of my close friends are too &quot;busy&quot; to get involved in whatever, but if I berated them they wouldn&#039;t be my friends much longer. &nbsp;Just because you&#039;re not active in the community doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;re not part of the community or some sort of phony resident.

For example, of the 1000 regular visitors to this board, how many of you have actually gone out to a community board, a UCCA, an Astoria Civic, a LICA, a Transportation Alternatives, ALWPA, or a precinct council meeting? One of the town hall meetings held by elected officials?<br /><br />Your lack of involvement does not auger well for this community and its future. <br /><br />I challenge you to get involved. Simply thinking that posting and ranting is effective will, without the follow-up to real human interaction, in the long run, simply wastes your time and gets our community nowhere.&nbsp; Blogs, although very useful and fulfill an important niche, are never a substitute for meeting face to face. A screen never trumps a human face. A keyboard, a handshake. <br /><br />Organizing, meeting with others that have a similar concern, and collectively deciding on your next course of action is the only way to truly be effective and to for you to demonstrate to this community, the one that you are making your home, is worth your effort to make it a success. If something is important to you, you will find the time. No excuses.<br /><br />The next time a civic group posts on this board, let’s see how many of you find the time to make the effort at showing up. Night out against crime is in Astoria Park this Tuesday. That is a good start.<br />

				People on this board are involved with AWLPA, APA, Transportation Alternatives, Power to the People, and have attended LICA, precinct meetings, and community board meetings.&nbsp; Get your facts straight before you start accusing people of non-involvement.

				And do any of those groups feel that too many people attend? <br /><br />The last time I went to a town hall meeting, a few score showed up ... out of a community of 300,000.

				I wish to make a proposal!&nbsp; I will personally organize an Astorians.com Meeting with our local representatives this fall.&nbsp; It will be held at Riccardo&#039;s.&nbsp; It will be sponsored by the Astoria Renaissance Committee (a Committee I had formed seven years ago made up of the residents around the park).&nbsp; We will put up a poll on Astorians.com to see which of the following issues will be discussed (the issues are from posts that I have read):<br /><br />Noise polution (mainly from motorcycles)<br />Trash and littering<br />Graffiti<br />Dog walkers not picking up after their dogs<br />Astoria Park issues<br />Odd smells on Ditmars<br />Over Development of the area<br />Pistilli and various issues with his buildings<br />And whatever else should be on the poll<br /><br />Since I do not wish to look like a fool in front of our representatives, I would like to get an idea of who from this blog would participate (obviously, if you are actually in town and do not have an emergency).&nbsp; I just wish to see how much interest there is prior to organizing this.&nbsp; I would also like to know who can put the poll up on the blog because I cannot do this, and to see if anyone is interested in assisting me to organize this meeting.&nbsp; Let&#039;s see exactly how many individuals are willing to make the effort to attend a meeting.&nbsp; Once we post the date and time, l will come to you again for your commitment to attend.&nbsp; We can then take attendance at the meeting and see who actually showed up.&nbsp; I agree that sitting on my porch and complaining about issues on this blog does not make much of a difference.&nbsp; The only way I was able to get anything done in the past was to attend meetings, to organize meetings, and to get the local papers involved.&nbsp; Alas, I felt that I was all alone in my efforts and became burnt out.&nbsp; I am willing to give it another try, with your assistance.&nbsp; Who is the first one to commit?<br /><br /><br />

				Debbie, I&#039;d like to be there, and hopefully a date can be worked out when I can attend.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; <br /><br />You can add a poll to this thread, or start a new thread.&nbsp; I think the &quot;add poll&quot; is at the bottom... or top?&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember.&nbsp; But for sure you can start one.<br /><br />I bet the APA people would be very interested in something like this, too.<br /><br />OT: I never think of astorians.com as a blog.&nbsp; I always think of it as a forum, or in older terms, a BBS (bulletin board service).&nbsp; Blogs are usually authored by a small group of people (10-12 or so like Gothamist (http://gothamist.com)) or as little as 1 person (like Megnut (http://megnut.com)).&nbsp; Even though comments are a part of blogs, that&#039;s a fairly recent addition, whereas forums have been more interactive for years.&nbsp;

				Debbie, I would be happy to attend the meeting and applaud your efforts to get something going.&nbsp; I really do hope we can get more feedback and participation from others on this board.&nbsp; I know the interest is there.&nbsp; I would start a new topic about this meeting though, as I don&#039;t think it will get as much attention on this post topic.

				I&#039;d also be happy to be part of the meeting, as I&#039;ve been in the process of both trying to put together a new business in the neighborhood, and am considering living at Astoria Park.&nbsp; feel free to send me a personal message if the meeting and committee come to be...<br /><br />matthew
