				Hi,<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to find a vet for my kitten and this one had some really mixed reviews- people either loved it or hated it... has anyone been? <br /><br />If you hated it- any recommendations for where to go? I&#039;m close to the Broadway, Steinway area.<br /><br />Thanks!

				There is a place on Broadway and 37th, on the North side of the street in between Bai Sushi and the window repair place.&nbsp; It&#039;s called Broadway Animal Clinic.&nbsp; I recently brought my cat in for a checkup and they were very nice and professional.&nbsp; They have some package deals on shots and weren&#039;t overly expensive.&nbsp; They just opened in the fall, so the place is brand new and very clean.&nbsp; When I was there, there was a family there gushing to the main vet/owner about how grateful they were to him for saving their dog- I guess he did some work for free because they couldn&#039;t afford it and the dog would have been put down otherwise.&nbsp; That won a few points with me.<br /><br />On the flip side, the only review I can find online is from someone who had a horrible experience, so your mileage may vary.&nbsp; Since you&#039;re so close, you might as well stop in and see if you think they&#039;d be a good fit for you and your cat.<br />

				I&#039;ve used Steinway Court and it can get extremely expensive.&nbsp; They&#039;re great as far as professional and treating you and your animal well however, you will walk out with an enormous bill.&nbsp; My 5 yr. cat is 100% healthy and up to date on all her shots and the last &quot;check up&quot; with 3 booster shots was nearly $500.&nbsp; On top of that they were pushing me to leave her to have her teeth cleaned (no sign of pain/plaque/cavities) and that would be an overnight plus the anesthesia so I could only imagine how much more that would have been!&nbsp; I&#039;m certainly going to try a different place next time she&#039;s due.<br />Hope that helps!

				Anyone know how Steinway Animal Hospital is? It&#039;s the former Astoria Animal Hospital which was terrible -- I can&#039;t recall the vet&#039;s name, but he was known to perform unnecessary surgeries. The new vets/owners seem to be getting good reviews online, and according to their website (steinwayvet.com), they have the latest in equipment.<br /><br />We need to get our 5-year old cat neutered (I know, I know... but my partner had a bad experience where her puppy died during neutering, so it made her very wary of getting our little guy done). Because of the experience with the dog and because our kitty isn&#039;t a kitten anymore, we want to make sure we bring him to the absolute best vet around -- in Astoria, out of Astoria -- doesn&#039;t matter. We&#039;ll travel.<br /><br />

				humans have insurance - cats, only if you got it when they&#039;re young.&nbsp; My girl cat has asthma - I take to a vet in Sunnyside now and my last bill was close to $400, it&#039;s expensive as they get older and have lots of tests done.

				I&#039;ve posted about Steinway Ct. before and can say I won&#039;t be going back.&nbsp; Dr. Glasser and his staff are very professional and kind, for the most part (his &quot;bedside manner&quot; can use a little work - using large words and &quot;doctor-speak&quot; a lot), but they will rip you off.&nbsp; <br /><br />Our cat has genetically bad teeth and had some other maladies when we first moved here (he was a rescue) and for removal of 2 teeth, Steinway Court charged us $750.&nbsp; They cleaned the rest of his teeth while he was under general anaesthesia, which I can understand, but we weren&#039;t notified ahead of time so the charge for that came as a surprise.&nbsp; A general exam fee is $75, which, to me, is pricey considering our new vet&#039;s fee is $40.<br /><br />Add to that lots of weird tests, fees, unnecessary scans/bloodwork, and the bill can really climb up there.&nbsp; For example, he charged us for putting a scope down our cat&#039;s ears to check for ear infections/mites, something he did during the check-up but didn&#039;t tell us we&#039;d be charged for.&nbsp; He also insisted on multiple rounds of bloodwork, claiming our cat tested &quot;inconclusive&quot; for Bartonella (aka cat scratch disease), and not knowing any better at the time, we let him run more tests.&nbsp; Lo and behold, after waiting for the test results to come back from his off-site lab (in Florida...??), our cat tested negative.&nbsp; Seemed fishy. <br /><br />Plus, we were told that our cat was overweight (by all of one pound) and needed to go on Science Diet dry food, which is only available in his office (how convenient) and costs $20 for a bag that only lasts about 2 weeks.&nbsp; <br /><br />All in all, a ripoff.&nbsp; The kind of thing where you check out with the receptionist and your jaw hits the floor when he/she tells you how much your bill is.<br /><br />&nbsp;We now use All Pets Veterinarians on Ditmars and 35th Street and couldn&#039;t be happier.&nbsp;

				Steinway Court Vet is indeed a rip off and I&#039;m surprised they are still in business. Two years ago I brought in my cat who had a urinary infection. They wanted $1200 BEFORE they would even start the removal procedure. That was way to much up front for my wife and I so we did not sign the authorization form with the estimate she presented us. <br />We took a few minutes outside to call around and we found another less expensive vet where we were going to take him. When we went back in and told them we we could not afford this here and made an appointment elsewhere the lady said the doctor had already begun the procedure. Note: we never authorized it. She also accused us of not caring for our pet and offered to have him euthanized since we could not afford the treatment. The entire office made us feel awful.<br />We had no choice but to leave our pet. They were &quot;kind&quot; enough to accept $600 up front, but would not release him until we came up with the remaining $600. We filed several complaints - even with his licensing board. When I went back a few days later to collect him the balance had risen to $830. I raised all holy hell at the front desk and mentioned the complaints that I filed. The receptionist went to the back and came back and all of a sudden there was a &quot;relief fund&quot; that we magically obtained or fell into. I left with my pet and paid no remaining balance - and with proof on signed paper that we owed nothing more.<br />A few weeks later they called to inform me that my pet was due for a check up. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever sworn so much over the phone. Needless to say they have not called back.<br /><br />

				I would <strong>not </strong>suggest taking your pet to Steinway Court.&nbsp; When I first brought my 2-month old puppy home, he developed a case of hypoglycemia - a fairly common ailment of very young toy breeds. I took him to Steinway Court and the doctor could not tell me what was wrong. He wanted to do all sorts of tests and x-rays. I then told him I wanted to call my dog&#039;s breeder from the office to see if they had any suggestions. I was willing to keep him there overnight, but the doctor said &quot; if you come tomorrow, your dog will probably be dead&quot;. I took him home and nursed him back to health after speaking with some other experienced dog owners from the neighborhood ( he simply needed some glucose/ Karo syrup for a few days )&nbsp; My bill for all those tests was <span class="bbc_u">VERY expensive</span> ....and he tacked on $15.00 for the 5 minute phone call I made to the breeder !&nbsp; As an experienced vet, it should have been obvious what was ailing my dog. I&#039;m sure he knew what was wrong the whole time but was milking us for as much as possible....which seems to be the routine at that office.&nbsp; &nbsp;NEVER AGAIN.

				I went there very briefly when I adopted Doyle from the ACC - they offer a &quot;free exam&quot; to new adoptees from that shelter.&nbsp; I might as well have taken him to my regular vet (Dr. Hatzi at All Pets, who is awesome), because the only things that were free were weighing him and taking his temperature.&nbsp; Everything else - looking in his ears, cleaning his ears, trimming his claws, etc etc etc - was itemized and charged for on the bill.&nbsp; My free exam there wound up costing twice as much as the same services would have been at All Pets.&nbsp; Very nice and friendly staff and doctors, though.
