				The prices in LIC have dropped from $800 sf to $600sf yet the majority of condos in Astoria are still priced at about $600 sf.<br />I think it is fair to say that the LIC condos are much better than their Astoria counterparts.<br /><br />If you do a search of all the new condos being built in manhattan and lic you can find information on the developers and their projects meanwhile most of the condos in Astoria seem to not list the developer on popular real estate websites.<br /><br />The locations of some of the condos aren&#039;t ideal and the quality of construction on some of them are questionable.<br />So what gives?<br /><br />If you have been to any of the open houses please advise on your experiences since the majority of posts on astoria condos are not too positive especially when it relates to their price.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Cant tell you abt the quality of the condos being built . Im guessing both are done quick and cheap and the developer is off to the next project . As for location Astoria is much safer and the schools are better than LIC schools .&nbsp; As for raising a family , Astoria again is much better as is the nightlife if you arent married .

				If we were looking for a condo as opposed to a house, I&#039;d consider LIC: Quicker commute (slightly), just a hop over the bridge into Brooklyn, near the river, and more growth potential. A handful of great little places to eat and cool bars.<br /><br />Don&#039;t know about crime or schools, but I get a kick out of the industrial surroundings. Reminds me of the meat packing district and parts of Brooklyn.

				LIC definitly has more growth potential.<br /><br />If you buy a condo in Astoria for the price they are asking you are looking at a loss when it comes time to sell.<br /><br />Astoria has been overhyped quite a bit, dont get me wrong it is nice but its still just Astoria.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Springtime , where do you get your info or facts from &gt; ?&nbsp; How can you say if you buy now , once you sell it will be for a loss ?&nbsp; Would you be flipping in&nbsp; a year from now ?&nbsp; That wouldnt be smart in anyplace&nbsp; , including LIC .&nbsp; What if you buy now and sell in 10 yrs , u think&nbsp; there is no way you make profit ?&nbsp; Tons of people told me that 7-8 yrs ago ... and told my other friends who bought in Astoria 10-12 yrs ago ,&nbsp; .... and my dad who bought in Astoria 30 yrs ago . All have already made profits .&nbsp; &nbsp;No one knows when the market will go up , only that eventually it will one day just like everything seems to go up . To say buying now means a loss makes no sense nor does it hold any value since it cant be proven .

				schools are a key issue for us, so we are looking to stay in Astoria rather than move to LIC.&nbsp; it is just so frustrating that we have seen so little on the market that 1) isn&#039;t either new and shoddy or old and run down; and 2) priced reasonably.&nbsp; we are not looking for &quot;a steal,&quot;&nbsp; just something that bears a passing relationship to the price it has been assigned.&nbsp; <br /><br />we like the place we are renting, so maybe we will just stay put.&nbsp;

				rebb&nbsp; i hear what you are saying , but i just feel that if someone can buy then&nbsp; they should&nbsp; cuz renting is kinda dumping your money out the window . If you put money into your own property you will be building equity .

				I dunno how safe it is around here, given the fairly frequent postings of stuff that goes on. The meatpacking district in Manhattan was once purely industrial; now there&#039;s the High Line and all kinds of trendiness happening there.<br /><br />Sure, the market will go up one day, but as it is, there are luxury buildings in Manhattan that are going into foreclosure, and even when the recession turns around, how much luxury can the market bear? <br /><br />I&#039;m often puzzled about the financial advantages of buying vs renting- ownership is not a financial advantage for EVERYbody. What we pay in rent here (each) a friend of ours pays in maintenance fees. Right there is money that can never be recovered. <br /><br />Property taxes- yeah you can claim them, but that&#039;s more money that vanishes when you own. We also don&#039;t pay a water, parking or heating bill- more stuff you can&#039;t get back as owners.<br /><br />If you time your purchase right, sure you can make oodles of dough. Then what? Unless you cash out, you just have to put all that extra money into a similar house, since they&#039;ve ALL gone up.

				Given what we have seen these last few years, I think it is safer to treat home ownership as a forced saving plan, rather than as an investment likely to bring in big returns. If you put 20% down and borrow 80%, your mortgage payments mostly &quot;rent&quot; to the bank for the money you borrowed, and the small percentage that goes to equity each month is a deposit in a volatile savings account. If you &quot;break even&quot; on your sale price, you come out ahead because you get your original investment back, plus the money you saved in your house. If you hadn&#039;t bought the house, it is unlikely you would have saved that money. Of course, if your house appreciates in value, you get a big dividend. <br /><br />That said, I don&#039;t view home ownership only as a financial issue.&nbsp; there is the security of knowing that a place is mine and i can do with it what i want.&nbsp; (I am so sick of neutral colored walls).&nbsp; There are quite a few changes i would make to our apartment if it were mine--changes that would improve the quality of our life, but that no landlord would invest in because for them it really is only an investment.&nbsp;

				There&#039;s also the interest rate- the amount you pay for the house is really X + 5.5% of X. <br /><br /><em>security of knowing that a place is mine and i can do with it what i want</em> <br /><br />This is really what it boils down to....although technically it&#039;s the bank&#039;s!

				Owning a place provides psychological advantages that can&#039;t always be boiled down to dollars and cents.<br /><br />A landlord can decide he doesn&#039;t want you anymore and kick you out.&nbsp; Sure there are laws to protect people against this, but it all depends on how good of a person you are dealing with.&nbsp; <br /><br />If something breaks, you are at the mercy of someone else.&nbsp; My last landlord wasn&#039;t interested in spending money on anything important (although he was always spending thousands of dollars to renovate his daughter&#039;s apartment downstairs).&nbsp; It took 3 times to get the leaky roof fixed correctly.&nbsp; The shower assembly inside the wall was leaking, and I told him about water accumulating outside of the tub.&nbsp; He ignored it until finally the leak caused some kind of damage to the ceiling downstairs until his daughter&#039;s apartment.&nbsp; <br /><br />Who wants to deal with that garbage?&nbsp; Sometimes you are lucky and get someone really good that cares about their property.&nbsp; Sometimes you don&#039;t.&nbsp; Just like there are good and band tenants there are also good and bad landlords. <br /><br />Someone posted above about looking at ownership as a forced savings plan rather than an investment.&nbsp; Sometimes that&#039;s a good way to go about it.&nbsp; When my wife and I had triplets we really needed a place.&nbsp; Whether or not I can sell it later on for more money than we bought it for is irrelevant - the primary concern was having someplace big enough and safe to raise our kids in.&nbsp; Finding a big enough place to rent in Astoria or LIC would have been hard enough, so it was pretty much trial by fire and buying a place.

				Wow triplets , im having identical twins soon and im nervous enough !&nbsp; My wife and i always say, imagine there was another one in there . <br />Abt owning , great part in Astoria if you do end up buying a multi-family , you get your tenant or tenants paying off a huge chunk of your mortgage each month . The tax deductions and tax writeoffs are also very big . You have gas/oil ,property taxes , property insurance and anything you do to the house to improve its value as well as fixing/upgrading things . You also get to add in the depreciation of the house and appliances . <br />In the end when your house does go up in value , depending on when you may have bought even if you dont sell to reap the rewards&nbsp; ,your kids will have a paid off house in a nice area .

				My cousin lives in Parkcity Utah and totally loves it . She is originally from florida and couldnt wait to leave .&nbsp; My other cousins just moved to Charlotte NC and said it was the best thing they ever did . They can actually crank the radio in their own house ! ....a 5 bedroom house that went for 350k during the mid/high peak 2 yrs ago .&nbsp; Living in NYC isnt really living to me , its more like dealing with life here to have other things ...family , better job , all the perks of NYC at your disposal , and ofcourse all the culture and diversity you can get . But u cant play your music loud , or even yell at your wife or husband out of fear your tenants might hear you . Or that you might be heard&nbsp; by your landlord sleeping right above you&nbsp; , seperated by a thin piece of sheetrock and some old plywood .&nbsp; Others in the country cant believe we live like this , but for some reason we do . <br />Sucks my favorite song is on the radio yet i cant put it loud cuz the guy in the next apt works nights and sleeps during the day , so i wanna be a good neighbor . Afterall he did promise to remove his shoes when he comes home at 430am ,not to wake my 3 sleeping infants .My 3 infants all in the same bedroom cuz its NYC!!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;Ahhhh what a life , NYC !!!&nbsp; We have fine arts though , oh and museums&nbsp; and i can eat indian food 7 days a week when i want and never even go to the same place twice while never leaving the same block . Its NYC after all , you give you take ..and then you give and give like $1800 a month for a small run down apt&nbsp; with that landlord wedged between you and the day sleeper .&nbsp; Well that 5 bedroom 4 bath house is tempting&nbsp; sure . Some large square of grass that looks like a mini nfl arena for a backyard&nbsp; sounds nice when you have kids and dogs that wanna run but instead chase each other around the dining room table . I just wish that guy in the apt next door can start working days again so after work i can play my song and maybe even dance around in my pj&#039;s (hey y not !!) without waking him up at 4pm .

				I hear ya about the quality of culture and stuff. And I&#039;m not attracted to the bland sameness of suburban life (having grown up on L.I. I learned that a big house + yard does not always = happiness.) Ditto my husband- we&#039;re truly happy in our simple, ramshackle rental. <br /><br />But my internet biker pals keep posting photos of their rides and commutes, and the images are jaw-dropping. Scenery right outside their door, adventuresome roads and trails surrounding them, and they&#039;re all fit and happy. They&#039;re also not lacking for good food and quality beer.<br /><br />If we move, I&#039;ll just have to become an aggresive cook, in an attempt to emulate decent falafel and pizza. As long as we&#039;re somewhere near A city with some cultural options, think I&#039;d be okay.<br /><br />NYC needs to get over itself. Yeah there&#039;s museums and stuff- how often do we actually visit or attend? The more I cook, the less impressed I am with what expensive restaurants have to offer. It&#039;s turned into a giant tourist trap.

				It&#039;s why we&#039;ve remained in NY all along- our understanding that the suburbs were a little bland. But we&#039;ve been renting ever since moving out of our homes, and we&#039;re tired of having no control over the condition of the places we live. <br /><br />Anything we buy around here would require a tremendous amount of renovation. The price of the fixer-uppers, though, would get you something already amazing for less than half the price elsewhere, with money left over for college, car, or retirement. As much as we love it here, is it worth sacrificing hundreds of thousands of dollars for great pizza and falafel??<br /><br />I do realize I&#039;m being dramatic- these are thoughts we all experience at some point.<br /><br />

				I also love the fact how all these condos have a kitchen squeezed in with the living room.<br />Basically there is no living room.<br /><br />If you put a dinner table that seats 4 by the kitchen that leaves very limited space to be considered a living room.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				These new condos and rental apartments are all designed to squeeze the maximum number of units into a predefined space.&nbsp; There is really no consideration given to actually living in them at all.&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s just me but I&#039;d rather have a larger apartment than a balcony that&#039;s just lost unusable space for half of the year anyway.&nbsp; And then when it is warm outside you can sit with a cup of coffee and look at the N train rolling by.&nbsp; What a view.<br /><br />Unless you are single or a couple that doesn&#039;t want to have children, none of these new constructions are really practical.&nbsp;

				one of the things i really like about NYC is that we don&#039;t have huge houses.&nbsp; while i suppose all of us want &quot;one more room and two extra closets&quot; i have no interest in a 3500 sq foot home, or even a 2000 sq foot home.&nbsp; i would have to fill it with furniture and heat/cool it.&nbsp; i like having fewer possessions and a smaller ecological footprint.&nbsp; i like not needing a car.&nbsp; <br /><br />to me, the ability to get where i want to go without driving is one of the city&#039;s best features.&nbsp; add the food, the culture and the diversity and i can&#039;t imagine living anywhere else.&nbsp; (i have lived in LOTS of other places so i am pretty sure about that.)&nbsp; <br /><br />i keep thinking i will find &quot;the right place.&quot;&nbsp; in the meantime, we stay renters

				I hear ya about the 3,000+ sq foot McMansions that seem to be all the rage. Even on these shows we watch, the houses are a bit much. <br /><br />The houses around here aren&#039;t necessarily too small, except compared to what the price is, and the amount of work required.

				The two bedroom units should cost what they are currently selling the one bedrooms for.<br /><br />The way these condos are marketed and priced is they are thinking that people that live in Manhattan and pay 2K in rent/month will move to Astoria and buy property.<br /><br /><br />
