I said ...Well, they haven&#039;t rued the day. After 9/11, we should have laid waste&nbsp; on such a scale that&nbsp; their would be tens of millions dead, they would have done&nbsp; it to us in a second&nbsp; given half a chance. This is&nbsp; a&nbsp; planet of&nbsp; barabarians, with few exceptions, if we don&#039;t fight to preserve&nbsp; the exception we deserve&nbsp; to disappear.<br /><br />I was answering why they hadn&#039;t rued the day&nbsp; and what they would&nbsp; have done, if they&nbsp; had our power, I said we &#039;should have&#039;, we didn&#039;t we are&nbsp; not the kind of people I see being denounced daily and they enemy is being played down. This is why the uproar&nbsp; on the moderate&nbsp; steps&nbsp; taken, removing the Taliban and fulfilling the 12 year violated&nbsp; cease fire&nbsp; in Iraq was the minimum, is frustrating and mystfying to me.. <br /><br />My &#039;Tuchas&#039; have been to the Middle East, many times, both in service and out. Matter of fact, after 9/11 I tried&nbsp; to re-enlist and&nbsp; I was over the age, even after&nbsp; they raised&nbsp; it recently. I also tried&nbsp; getting into a security&nbsp; firm. But, this whole argument, If one supports a war they should all be there fighting it, while all war opponents&nbsp; are safely at home denouncing it, is the single most meanspirited&nbsp; argument of all. If I said one who supports national health care should move&nbsp; to Cuba, or&nbsp; if one supports&nbsp; fighting crime they should shut up&nbsp; and&nbsp; become a cop, I&#039;d be laughed at and for good reason. So, let&#039;s&nbsp; cut out that&nbsp; nonsense. I support cancer research, but, I&#039;d be a rotten surgeon. <br /><br />Ok, so, you called me a hater and&nbsp; bigot. I think it&#039;s&nbsp; a fair assumption you won&#039;t be inviting&nbsp; me&nbsp; to tea and cakes.&nbsp; I have&nbsp; friends and even some&nbsp; family who were in the IDF. When I see&nbsp; criticism only directed&nbsp; one way, while the other side&nbsp; I keep hearing how we did&nbsp; this or that to them and we should&nbsp; leave, to me it smacks&nbsp; of support. If I&#039;m in a&nbsp; fight and someone keeps telling me I am wrong and says&nbsp; nothing about the other side, I assume&nbsp; they are not supporting&nbsp; me and it is&nbsp; defacto&nbsp; support of my opponent. You can&#039;t be &#039;neutrally&#039; against&nbsp; one side.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;I lived with Muslims, in an exchange in a ARMYROTC program, for nearly 3 years. We ate, showered, sh*t and slept&nbsp; in close quarters.&nbsp; The Muslims I lived with were highly educated folks, we were studying Avionics and Hydraulics of high performance military aircraft. Anyway, a gentleman I became friends with from Jedda, Saudi Arabia... &#039;Mahood&#039;, explained to me the fanaticism of the coming Muslim &#039;Jihad&#039;, the Iran hostage situation had just ended and we were in Upstate NY at the time at Stewart Airport and saw the hostages land. We would have long talks, we both enjoyed playing soccer, and on the field after practice we would discuss the similarties, and their are numerous, of the Holy Bible and Holy Koran. There are great differences as well, and the sad part is that the Koran has gone back in time to reinforce things abandoned over the centuries, &#039;mistakes&#039; if you will, that Jews and then Christians visited on &#039;non-believers.&#039; Still, those Zealots, hundreds and even a thousand years ago did not have access to the weapons of today, thankfully, they only got as far as the sword and shield. &#039;Mahood&#039;, could not understand the complacency of the West at the hostage situation, then by former President Jimmy Carter, he reiterated that it emboldens the zealots when they see appeasment or pulling back from a fight. He told me on the last day of our ROTC graduation, that one day the Jihadists will attack your home if you do not stop them, that was in 1984. Mahood was and is a friend of mine, he and his parents still maintain a residence in Qatar, and he eventually worked as an interpretor for the British consulate. We exchanged a Bible/Koran that last day, and he told me how he would have to hide it in his nation, where &#039;Mecca&#039; the holiest site of Islam exist, I told him I can read his book anywhere, and that is the difference. The current war is a result of neglect due to&nbsp; convenience and appeasment for resources. Yes, it is partly cause of oil, but, not the West trying to grab it, but, the East using it to spread an ideology based on religious intolerance and ancient bigotry. If not now, when, if not us, who, someone once said, this has to be stopped now, otherwise, there will be further bloodshed and the war everyone claims they want to avoid will then be in your homes and unavoidable. 9/11 was their best shot yet, but, not the last one by far.<br /><br />There over a billion Muslims&nbsp; on earth. If we take the lowest polling that %10&nbsp; support&nbsp; Jihad and suicide bombing, and that fully&nbsp; 1/3 see it as duty to make Islam the law wherever they may be, that&#039;s&nbsp; between 100 and 300 Million people&nbsp; who want&nbsp; to end &#039;our&#039;&nbsp; way of life. <br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_105459">Saturday evening, my wife and I went to Ron Paul&#039;s grass roots headquarters for a celebration leading up to today&#039;s &quot;Boston Tea Party&quot; fund-raising drive (currently they&#039;re approaching $4 million dollars donated today!).<br /><br />Although I recognized a few classical liberals in the crowd of approximately 170+ people, mostly this was a youthful group who are clearly passionate about his candidacy primarily because they trust that Paul is a principled statesman. Passionate advocacy like this is earned by Paul in a way that I believe is elusive for most of the other candidates, certainly by the leadership of the Democrats and Republicans. Why should that be the case?<br /><br />Some leaders have a principled basis for their policy positions. Paul is such a leader.<br /><br />Other leaders strive eagerly to seem appealing to a wide variety of groups. Hillary and Obama and Edwards, as well as Rudy, Romney, and other Republicans are typical of such leaders.<br /><br />Obama discovered religion when he learned that it would help him with voters. Romney discovered his anti-choice position when it was politically expedient for him to do so. Hillary wants to seem antiwar, but has she really been anti-war? Edwards spends a small fortune on one of the largest homes in the South, yet positions himself as the anti-poverty candidate and believes fervently in wealth redistribution....really?<br /><br />*****<br />Recently, the Interior Minister of Venezuela, Pedro Carreno, was remarking on how horrific capitalism is when he was interrupted by a reporter asking him about his $180 Louis Vuitton tie and $500 Gucci shoes. He was stunned and recovered only by saying: &quot;It&#039;s not contradictory because I would like Venezuela to produce all this so I could buy stuff produced here instead of 95 percent of what we consume being imported.&quot; <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jxDeNDAApj1Ei6s7FoOefGRP9KQAD8THDE8O0" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jxDeNDAApj1Ei6s7FoOefGRP9KQAD8THDE8O0</a><br /><br />&nbsp;:-o&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="http://www.astorians.com/community/Smileys/SoLoSMiLeYS1/cry.gif" alt="&#58;cry&#58;" title="cry" class="smiley" />&nbsp; :x<br /><br />Why do I share this story?<br /><br />My point is this: there are people trying to acquire power for the sake of having power and everything that makes possible; there are far fewer people trying to acquire power so that they can diminish that power and reduce the benefits that come with it.<br /><br />You may disagree with Paul on one position or another, but our country&#039;s national government needs a&nbsp; healthy reality check and he seems to be the only one willing to make that happen.<br /><br />We all know that the free lunch promises of the other candidates are tailor-made by marketing gurus to appeal to us on various levels. Your heart. Your hopes. Your sense of justice. But anyone desperate enough to make one or a dozen free lunch promises should not be entrusted with power.<br /><br />BECAUSE THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A FREE LUNCH! And the pursuit of free lunches is why our government recently voted to raise the national debt limit to 9.8 trillion dollars. That&#039;s 9,800,000,000,000.00 dollars that our government owes in the name of supporting the utterly obsolete idea that the national government&#039;s intentions correlate to its real world effectiveness. Your share of this debt about $32,500.00... but actually each of us is deeper in the hole than that because of the amount of debt individual states are in and future liabilities associated with rising Medicare costs.<br /><br />This is not the time to care about &quot;being a Republican&quot; or &quot;being a Democrat&quot;. This is the time to choose to be a voter who refuses to endorse candidates who want to impose on us the costs associated with pursuing utopian visions for the sake of seeming to do something positive as a way of securing your votes.<br /><br />Break the vicious cycle. Stop supporting these charlatans, these hypocrites, these opportunists. Stop thinking of yourself as a winner or a loser based on your party affiliation; newsflash, we&#039;re all losing until the professional politicians stop taxing and spending us to death.<br /><br />Please seriously consider registering as a Republican so that you can vote for Ron Paul.</div>

Passionate advocacy like this is earned by Paul in a way that I believe is elusive for most of the other candidates, certainly by the leadership of the Democrats and Republicans. Why should that be the case?<br /><br />Some leaders have a principled basis for their policy positions. Paul is such a leader.<br /><br />Other leaders strive eagerly to seem appealing to a wide variety of groups. Hillary and Obama and Edwards, as well as Rudy, Romney, and other Republicans are typical of such leaders.<br /><br />Obama discovered religion when he learned that it would help him with voters. Romney discovered his anti-choice position when it was politically expedient for him to do so. Hillary wants to seem antiwar, but has she really been anti-war? Edwards spends a small fortune on one of the largest homes in the South, yet positions himself as the anti-poverty candidate and believes fervently in wealth redistribution....really?<br /><br />*****<br />Recently, the Interior Minister of Venezuela, Pedro Carreno, was remarking on how horrific capitalism is when he was interrupted by a reporter asking him about his $180 Louis Vuitton tie and $500 Gucci shoes. He was stunned and recovered only by saying: &quot;It&#039;s not contradictory because I would like Venezuela to produce all this so I could buy stuff produced here instead of 95 percent of what we consume being imported.&quot; <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jxDeNDAApj1Ei6s7FoOefGRP9KQAD8THDE8O0" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jxDeNDAApj1Ei6s7FoOefGRP9KQAD8THDE8O0</a><br /><br />&nbsp;:-o&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="http://www.astorians.com/community/Smileys/SoLoSMiLeYS1/cry.gif" alt="&#58;cry&#58;" title="cry" class="smiley" />&nbsp; :x<br /><br />Why do I share this story?<br /><br />My point is this: there are people trying to acquire power for the sake of having power and everything that makes possible; there are far fewer people trying to acquire power so that they can diminish that power and reduce the benefits that come with it.<br /><br />You may disagree with Paul on one position or another, but our country&#039;s national government needs a&nbsp; healthy reality check and he seems to be the only one willing to make that happen.<br /><br />We all know that the free lunch promises of the other candidates are tailor-made by marketing gurus to appeal to us on various levels. Your heart. Your hopes. Your sense of justice. But anyone desperate enough to make one or a dozen free lunch promises should not be entrusted with power.<br /><br />BECAUSE THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A FREE LUNCH! And the pursuit of free lunches is why our government recently voted to raise the national debt limit to 9.8 trillion dollars. That&#039;s 9,800,000,000,000.00 dollars that our government owes in the name of supporting the utterly obsolete idea that the national government&#039;s intentions correlate to its real world effectiveness. Your share of this debt about $32,500.00... but actually each of us is deeper in the hole than that because of the amount of debt individual states are in and future liabilities associated with rising Medicare costs.<br /><br />This is not the time to care about &quot;being a Republican&quot; or &quot;being a Democrat&quot;. This is the time to choose to be a voter who refuses to endorse candidates who want to impose on us the costs associated with pursuing utopian visions for the sake of seeming to do something positive as a way of securing your votes.<br /><br />Break the vicious cycle. Stop supporting these charlatans, these hypocrites, these opportunists. Stop thinking of yourself as a winner or a loser based on your party affiliation; newsflash, we&#039;re all losing until the professional politicians stop taxing and spending us to death.<br /><br />Please seriously consider registering as a Republican so that you can vote for Ron Paul.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m a Republican &nbsp;by &#039;default.&#039; The democrats have veered &nbsp;so far &nbsp;away from reality, I don&#039;t even see them anymore. The Republicans are way too weak, in NY especially, they want to be &nbsp;&#039;loved.&#039; &nbsp;:roll: &nbsp;But, Ron Paul, forget it, there is &nbsp;nothing new, another &nbsp;John Anderson/Pat Buchanan/Ross Perot hype, only this guy &nbsp;uses the internet. My main disagreement with him is &nbsp;foreign policy, he views &nbsp;the USA &nbsp;like we are in the 19th Century. You can&#039;t be on an Island in a &nbsp;world &nbsp;of sharks and last long. The man reminds me of &nbsp;a &nbsp;drunk uncle &nbsp;on New Years, he sounds &nbsp;good when everybody is &nbsp;drunk, but, New Years &nbsp;day it&#039;s time for adults to be in charge. John McCain is my choice, I have disagreements &nbsp;on the &#039;torture&#039; front, but, &nbsp;he knows &nbsp;that we can&#039;t away from the battle.</div>

I am humbled and inspired, grateful and thrilled for this vast outpouring of support.<br /><br />On just one day, in honor of the 234th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party, the new American revolutionaries brought in $6.04 million, another one-day record. The average donation was $102; we had 58,407 individual contributors, of whom an astounding 24,915 were first-time donors. And it was an entirely voluntary, self-organized, decentralized, independent effort on the internet. Must be the &quot;spammers&quot; I keep hearing about!<br /><br />The establishment is baffled and worried, and well they should be. They keep asking me who runs our internet fundraising and controls our volunteers. To these top-down central planners, a spontaneous order like our movement is science-fiction. But you and I know it&#039;s real: as real as the American people&#039;s yearning for freedom, peace, and prosperity, as real as all the men and women who have sacrificed for our ideals, in the past and today.<br /><br />And how neat to see celebrations all across the world, with Tea Parties from France to New Zealand. This is how we can spread the ideals of our country, through voluntary emulation, not bombs and bribes. Of course, there were hundreds in America.<br /><br />As I dropped in on a cheering, laughing crowd of about 600 near my home in Freeport, Texas, I noted that they call us &quot;angry.&quot; Well, we are the happiest, most optimistic &quot;angry&quot; movement ever, and the most diverse. What unites us is a love of liberty, and a determination to fix what is wrong with our country, from the Fed to the IRS, from warfare to welfare. But otherwise we are a big tent.<br /><br />Said the local newspaper: &quot;The elderly sat with teens barely old enough to vote. The faces were black, Hispanic, Asian and white. There was no fear in their voices as they spoke boldly with each other about the way the country should be. Held close like a deeply held secret, Paul has brought them out of the disconnect they feel between what they know to be true and where the country has been led.&quot;<br /><br />Thanks also to the 500 or so who braved the blizzard in Boston to go to Faneuil Hall. My son Rand told me what a great time he had with you.<br /><br />A few mornings ago on LewRockwell.com, I saw a YouTube of a 14-year-old boy that summed up our whole movement for me. This well-spoken young man, who could have passed in knowledge for a college graduate, told how he heard our ideas being denounced. So he decided to Google. He read some of my speeches, and thought, these make sense. Then he studied US foreign policy of recent years, and came to the conclusion that we are right. So he persuaded his father to drop Rudy Giuliani and join our movement.<br /><br />All over America, all over the world, we are inspiring real change. With the wars and the spying, the spending and the taxing, the inflation and the credit crisis, our ideas have never been more needed. Please help me spread them <a href="https://www.ronpaul2008.com/donate" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.ronpaul2008.com/donate</a> in all 50 states. Victory for liberty! That is our goal, and nothing less.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Ron<br /><br />&nbsp;</div>

I am humbled and inspired, grateful and thrilled for this vast outpouring of support.<br /><br />On just one day, in honor of the 234th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party, the new American revolutionaries brought in $6.04 million, another one-day record. The average donation was $102; we had 58,407 individual contributors, of whom an astounding 24,915 were first-time donors. And it was an entirely voluntary, self-organized, decentralized, independent effort on the internet. Must be the &quot;spammers&quot; I keep hearing about!<br /><br />The establishment is baffled and worried, and well they should be. They keep asking me who runs our internet fundraising and controls our volunteers. To these top-down central planners, a spontaneous order like our movement is science-fiction. But you and I know it&#039;s real: as real as the American people&#039;s yearning for freedom, peace, and prosperity, as real as all the men and women who have sacrificed for our ideals, in the past and today.<br /><br />And how neat to see celebrations all across the world, with Tea Parties from France to New Zealand. This is how we can spread the ideals of our country, through voluntary emulation, not bombs and bribes. Of course, there were hundreds in America.<br /><br />As I dropped in on a cheering, laughing crowd of about 600 near my home in Freeport, Texas, I noted that they call us &quot;angry.&quot; Well, we are the happiest, most optimistic &quot;angry&quot; movement ever, and the most diverse. What unites us is a love of liberty, and a determination to fix what is wrong with our country, from the Fed to the IRS, from warfare to welfare. But otherwise we are a big tent.<br /><br />Said the local newspaper: &quot;The elderly sat with teens barely old enough to vote. The faces were black, Hispanic, Asian and white. There was no fear in their voices as they spoke boldly with each other about the way the country should be. Held close like a deeply held secret, Paul has brought them out of the disconnect they feel between what they know to be true and where the country has been led.&quot;<br /><br />Thanks also to the 500 or so who braved the blizzard in Boston to go to Faneuil Hall. My son Rand told me what a great time he had with you.<br /><br />A few mornings ago on LewRockwell.com, I saw a YouTube of a 14-year-old boy that summed up our whole movement for me. This well-spoken young man, who could have passed in knowledge for a college graduate, told how he heard our ideas being denounced. So he decided to Google. He read some of my speeches, and thought, these make sense. Then he studied US foreign policy of recent years, and came to the conclusion that we are right. So he persuaded his father to drop Rudy Giuliani and join our movement.<br /><br />All over America, all over the world, we are inspiring real change. With the wars and the spying, the spending and the taxing, the inflation and the credit crisis, our ideas have never been more needed. Please help me spread them <a href="https://www.ronpaul2008.com/donate" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.ronpaul2008.com/donate</a> in all 50 states. Victory for liberty! That is our goal, and nothing less.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Ron<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />14 year old boys, teens barely old enough to vote? Yup, those&nbsp; are definately&nbsp; Ron Pauls true&nbsp; &#039;believers.&#039;&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; BTW, What is it with Doctors&nbsp; from the Northeast, Dean , now&nbsp; this guy? I&#039;m telling you, I deal with Doctors, have too, have found that very few of them know&nbsp; what the heck&nbsp; they are doing, and&nbsp; their profession is more&nbsp; Dr. Kevorkian&nbsp; and Mengele&nbsp; than&nbsp; people&nbsp; who genuiniely&nbsp; are helping anyone. I had&nbsp; one&nbsp; threaten to call the police, the filthy pill pusher, when he tried&nbsp; screwing with my health. If more&nbsp; people&nbsp; read up on their health and laid into these&nbsp; murderers&nbsp; with white&nbsp; coats, health care would be cheaper&nbsp; and better. If I was&nbsp; in charge, I&#039;d give Medical Colleges time limits to find&nbsp; cures for diseases, otherwise, they would&nbsp; be defunded and shut down. Also, anyone&nbsp; convicted&nbsp; of misdiagnosis that results&nbsp; in death, executed. You&#039;d see the freak&#039;n medical&nbsp; profession find cures&nbsp; real fast.&nbsp; Medical science , for the most part, is&nbsp; a&nbsp; horrendous&nbsp; shame giving false&nbsp; hope&nbsp; to millions&nbsp; of suffering people. As for&nbsp; the OBGYN, He is&nbsp; a&nbsp; clueless, dangerous, but, I&#039;m not too worried, he&nbsp; can win the Boston High School Vote.&nbsp; <img src="http://www.astorians.com/community/Smileys/SoLoSMiLeYS1/wink.gif" alt="&#58;wink&#58;" title="wink" class="smiley" /></div>
