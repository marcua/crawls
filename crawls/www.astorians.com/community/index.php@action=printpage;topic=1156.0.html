				We didn't even see this one coming - <br /><br /><br />Dandana it's at 42 - 21 Broadway<br />It's Egyptian (Moroccan maybe??) cafe/lounge <br /><br />the logo has a music note in it.. but I asked the waitress about live music... and she said - maybe in the future. &nbsp;They only had their grand opening 3 days ago. &nbsp;So far just belly dancing &nbsp;(on the weekends)<br /><br />There is no liquor license yet. &nbsp;<br /><br />Food - was quite great. &nbsp;We had... Lamb Tangine and two... I don't &nbsp;know the name ...it's a chicken dish baked in Philo dough - it was sweet and savory. &nbsp;Both dishes were a &nbsp;little on the sweet side for my taste - but when mixed together with rice and the greek salad - it was really very good. &nbsp;<br /><br />service was... a bit underwhelming - but they just opened so i'll cut them all the slack in the world. &nbsp;<br />On the other hand after my tagine with cous cous sat on the table for a few minutes with no cous cous... i had to ask. &nbsp;the response was &quot;oh... we actually ran out of cous cous. &nbsp;Would you like some rice instead?&quot; &nbsp;So I had to wonder if she just wasn't going to bring me anything if I hadn't said anything. &nbsp;They'll work the kinks out - hopefully after a few weeks. &nbsp;<br /><br />Prices were fair. &nbsp;Most of the entrees were $15 or 18. &nbsp;The salad was $7. &nbsp;Egyptian tea - $3 &nbsp;<br /><br />What's nice about this place is that although it has the hookah pipes like the places on Steinway - it also has a full menu. &nbsp;Many of those cafes don't. &nbsp;It's also a bit more upscale than some of the Steinway cafes - I think catering to a more mixed crowd. &nbsp;Of course the prices reflect the differences - too. &nbsp;I'm sure the pipes are more at this place than they are on Steinway. &nbsp;But maybe not... &nbsp; I wonder what it's like on the weekends -

				ugh.<br /><br />Went last night - for the first time in about a year.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think much of the comfy seating was removed.&nbsp; <br /><br />We ordered food even though the tables were dirty and everyone in the place was smoking hookas (not focusing on food - if you&#039;re smoking)<br /><br />Both ordered the bastilla - I was SOOOOO craving it - and it was SOOOOOOO bad. <br /><br />old dry minced meat in a phyllo (the cinnamon and powdered sugar on top were still good). <br /><br />The cabernet was great. <br /><br />the waitress was cute as a button<br /><br />the woman next to us was wearing an extremely sexy outfit<br /><br />so if you want to go for eye candy... and a drink and a hooka.... go for it. <br />&nbsp;<br />skip the food. <br /><br /><br /><br />
