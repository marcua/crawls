				Well, flooz, MandaT and mysteryastorian scoped out Il Bambino, talked to the chef, and it became clear that this place is a winner and would be perfect for our next EATS event.&nbsp; It&#39;s very vegetarian friendly, too, as you can see from their menu (http://ilbambinocafe.com/menu.html).&nbsp; Talk of a prix fixe was batted around ($20).&nbsp; It&#39;s BYOB, too.&nbsp; Friday night seemed like the best night, around 8pm or so.&nbsp; Now, we have to pick a Friday.&nbsp; I&#39;ll toss out the 16th and 23rd for starters.&nbsp; <br /><br />What say you all?

				If I had my druthers I&#39;d take the 16th, as I will be -1 most of that week and weekend ... and a group gathering would be much enjoyed.&nbsp; :-(<br /><br />However, I&#39;m still okay with the 23rd. I have a planned weekend getaway the following day, so my only issue would be not having a real late night for myself (not a deal-breaker, just a preference).

				I think I can do either of those Fridays. &nbsp;Definitely a fan of having EATS on Fridays as opposed to Saturdays or weeknights. &nbsp;I&#39;m not sure I like the prix fixe idea because I&#39;m a picky eater, but I&#39;ll cope.

				I can probably do either day but don&#39;t want to commit to a Friday.&nbsp; They are usually tough for me, but I may be able to make it.&nbsp; But if it&#39;s necessary to do a prix fix then don&#39;t worry about counting me in.&nbsp; I don&#39;t want to hold you all up.

				the prix fix is still a question. we really just need to get a rough estimate on people to work out all the kinks. the place is pretty small and if we are enough to fill up the joint, we have to work with it. also there are only so many panini makers in the kitchen!

				I think the menu will satisfy a picky eater.&nbsp; And they will adjust things for you if you like (like no sauce or a different pesto).&nbsp; And they are just so nice there.<br /><br />I agree, the prix fixe is still up in the air.

Wine tasting starts at 6:30, so if you like you can go on over, have a drinky tasty and buy a bottle.&nbsp; The selection is decent, and I was happy to see South African wines there, as well as some interesting Chilean, Austrailian and NZ wines.&nbsp; They also have some ok CA wines.&nbsp; The restaurant has italian sodas, water, coffee, tea, and the like.<br /><br />This is very exciting!&nbsp; Those of you who have not been are in for a real treat.&nbsp; The food is so delcious!<br /><br />I&#39;ll bring my camera, and I expect I&#39;ll see the regular papparazi there, too. :wink:

				megc, thanks for organizing tonight. It was good to meet more of you and I&#39;m officially hooked on the IL BAMBINO phenomenon. Didn&#39;t have the potato salad, but all the other stuff was GUUUHHHHRD-picture a Homer floating with open mouth, little crusty sandwiches falling into place. Chomp.

				I had a great time!&nbsp; Great food and great company is a terrific combination.&nbsp; I liked how people felt free to get up and walk around and visit.&nbsp; Biggest tasty surprise:&nbsp; the chickpea crostini with anchovy in a vinaigrette involving preserved lemon.&nbsp; Was so happy to have that potato salad again, too, along with the amazing tomatoes and ricotta.&nbsp; Those big bottles of italian soda were so good, too!&nbsp; I had tangerine, yum. Loved the hot peanut butter chocolate, too!<br /><br />Anyway, great night, nice to see everyone.&nbsp; I had fun helping put this together.&nbsp; Thanks for the kind words.<br /><br />Gotta start thinking of the next event for March.&nbsp; &nbsp;Suggestions?

				kudos to all involved in organizing.&nbsp; and thank you to Il Bambino. <br /><br />I had a great time - mixing food with people with wine and mingling... definitely the way to go.&nbsp; Beats the heckle out of the more traditional wedding banquet style dining.&nbsp; <br /><br />the food was all good - but TOOOOO much.&nbsp; I would have liked to have been told in advance about the three courses.&nbsp; &nbsp;As far as my favorites... sundried tomatoes with ricotta? on that delicious toast and the EGG SALAD with truffle oil? butter? omg!!! yummmyyy yummy My least favorite - the stinky blue cheese.&nbsp; &nbsp;maybe if I&#39;d prepared myself for it... but... i was definitely not braced.&nbsp; <br /><br />It was great to see everyone.&nbsp; <br />

				It was a great meal, and thanks again to Meg for organizing it.&nbsp; I definitely would have paced myself more at the beginning if I&#39;d know how much food there was going to be.&nbsp; Highlights:<br /><br />--The frisee salad with parmesan <br />--Salad of beans with chorizo and salsa verde<br />--The stuffed tomato with tun<br />--Truffle egg crostini<br />--Chickpea and anchovy crostini<br />--The panini, especially the one with prosciutto, gorgonzola, and fig spread<br /><br />Looking forward to the next event!

				So I went to Il Bambino for lunch today since it got such good reviews from you all and your Friday dinner.&nbsp; I had a panini with portobello mushrooms, red pepper spread, and manchego.&nbsp; It was tasty but I kind of wished I had gone with some other people so I could have sampled more menu items.&nbsp; I asked about the peanut butter hot chocolate, apparently that was a special drink the the owner had made for your event.&nbsp; He was very sweet and offered to whip one up for me, I accepted and was in heaven, OMG yum.

				I went there tonight and it was definitely more crowded than I had seen it before - it&#039;s usually pretty empty when I&#039;ve gone before - maybe all this mention has given them more business? I hope so, they deserve it!
