So you have to fall back on &quot;cruelty&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; to explain it.<br /><br />And it&#39;s pretty well known that many sociopaths who end up being career violent criminals start out by torturing animals as kids...

				hhmm, i think i <em>might</em> see what you&#39;re getting at merm... <em>maybe</em>?<br />but to me anyway-i think i would feel better if he decided to eat it at least. i can&#39;t see what he did being the same as the ole cow to slaughter thing. maybe its a societal (is that a word?) thing on how we view certain animals? would i prefer to know that all the meat we eat has been brought to the table via humane means, of course-is it? probably not- and when/if i see an article stating some awful event that involves some brutalization of a cow or pig or duck or lamb that pisses me off as much as this article did. i guess i&#39;m playing the ignorant card here? cause its obvious that its not a perfect system and i still choose to eat meat, all i can say and admit to is that i go on my gut and how i was raised. i&#39;m used to killing my meals (no i don&#39;t do it anymore) and i&#39;ve been around &quot;people of the land&quot; my whole life, so maybe i&#39;m also a little caloused when it comes to these things, i don&#39;t know maybe i&#39;m rambling.. i think i am! but its been awhile since i wrote so much in here! so to sum it all up:<br /><br />• decapitating kitten <strong>wrong</strong><br />• decapitating any animal in a fight with your girlfriend <strong>wrong</strong><br />• decapitating a dinner <strong>wrong/right</strong> depending

				I agree that the guy is messed up. The violence here is clearly uncalled for. But I&#39;m not sure that it&#39;s any less justified a reason to kill the cat out of rage, than to kill one so you can have some nice cat burger and cat wings down at the local &quot;Cat n&#39; Chips&quot;<br /><br />I think the think that makes us cringe at this is because we&#39;re able to see this event through the perspective of the cat. It clearly didn&#39;t deserve to die, so we identify (side) with the cat. If it&#39;s the act of considering the cat&#39;s perspective that makes us cringe at this story I&#39;m not sure killing a cat for fast-food vs. out of rage is any different - from the cat&#39;s perspective. Both are completely unnecessary.<br /><br />What we&#39;re talking about is the taking of unnecessary life, and that&#39;s upsetting to us. Especially when it can be easily shown that an animal based diet is completely unnecessary in developed countries.<br /><br />I&#39;m not entirely against eating meat, but I just see a bit of irony (even hypocrisy) in how we treat people that kill unnecessarily out of rage, vs. killing unnecessarily out of fast/processed food addiction.

				I think that guy should go to jail for sure, but you raise interesting point Merm.<br />It would be good if the kitten case got more publicity and then the man was set free on the grounds that the slaughterhouse was just as cruel. Then maybe there would be a companion story on slaughterhouse realities.<br />The way it is now, you have to seek out videos to see what goes on by visiting PETA or HSUS. <br />&nbsp;Today PETA has videos of turkeys being abused. But as birds are excluded from the Animal Welfare Act, there&#39;s nothing you can do to them in a slaughterhouse that would be illegal. &nbsp;If anyone is interested in these issues please visit PETA or HSUS. There are bills &nbsp;in Congress intended to improve things but they need people to call or email support to their representatives. These websites make it easy to find out what legislation is pending and who your reps are.

				Merm, to me the difference is the reason why the animal exists. If people didn&#39;t eat beef, drink milk, or wear leather, there would be essentially no cows in North America. The reason why a cow exists on this planet, and (if it&#39;s lucky and is going to be eaten by a yuppie) has the pleasure of eating grass on a pasture, is because we bred it. So humanely killling the cow in order to eat it is part of its existence, and is not a violence against its existence. <br /><br />For a cat, however, it was bred to be an unbearably cute companion animal for people. Its reason for being is to sit on the couch and purr while we watch TV. Without us, there would be a lot fewer cats, and they would mostly not look like inbred Persians.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#39;s a violation of our moral contract with a cat to kill it in a fight with our girlfriend, and thus violate its reason for being, just as it would be a violation of our moral contract with a cow to shoot it and let it rot.

				Anybody ever read the Chronicles of Narnia - more specifically, The Silver Chair, by C.S. Lewis?<br /><br />This debate and the subject of animal slaughter reminds me of this book where the main characters are showered with food and care by these giants, only to discover that this wasn&#39;t because they liked them as people, but rather because they were looking forward to having the delicacy of Man Pie. The main characters were able to escape soon after they made this discovery.<br /><br />While it is a children&#39;s book, I think that it does make a good point. No matter what your reason for existence is, don&#39;t you want to live?

				Yes, I&#39;ve read it, but 20 years ago...!<br /><br />Two points on your questions... First, there&#39;s not a lot of evidence that animals are aware of their own mortality. They can definitely be afraid, and we should avoid making them afraid, but if you asked them &quot;would you rather live or be eaten&quot;, they wouldn&#39;t understand the question. Second, your argument is against hunting, not against livestock whose very existence relies on us. For those animals, the question is &quot;would you rather live and be eaten, or never live at all.&quot; (see also, Tennyson)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=3497.msg34105.html#msg34105">Quote from: wasabisam on September 21, 2006, 12:57:02 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Anybody ever read the Chronicles of Narnia - more specifically, The Silver Chair, by C.S.

Look - my view is skewed and will never reflect yours because I am a life-long vegetarian, and over the last year or more have become more ethically interested in the treatment of animals no matter their human-imposed category (food or pet). So it is difficult for me to say, &quot;yeah your argument makes sense because cows really are just beef that haven&#39;t been killed yet.&quot; To me cows are cows, not meat (and on some farms are very large pets).<br /><br />It is just interesting what categories we arbitrarily put animals in. In this country dogs are considered pets, but in some parts of the world they are food just as much as cows are food in America. Other animals, like horses are functional/practical so they are neither food nor pet - used for work on the farm, racing, etc. (Although I think they do wind up as dog and cat food, but I don&#39;t have anything to back that up with.) Yet in other countries horse meat is just a normal way of life. Then you have the whole display animals thing with zoos. Monkeys, tigers, elephants, all sorts of exotic animals wind up in zoos. But in other parts of the world monkeys are prized for their delicious (sarcasm) brains, tigers for their colorful coat, and elephants for their ivory.<br /><br />Sure - I own a cat, and I suppose you could just come back to my argument and say, &quot;well, you&#39;re not being fair because you own a cat. If fair was fair, then you would not support the domestication of animals.&quot; And maybe that would be the right thing to do in conjunction with my argument that we shouldn&#39;t place arbitrary labels on animals just so we can do whatever we want with them - eat them, pet them, use them for their assets or abilities.<br /><br />While I don&#39;t think that merm is saying this guy should be roaming the streets, I do think that his point is valid - why treat any animal different than another animal? Saying, &quot;because that&#39;s just the way it is and the way humans have set up the cycle of life - cows=beef, cats=pets&quot; isn&#39;t much of an argument, IMHO.

As for vegetarianism, I applaud your decision to live your values. This said, I don&#39;t think it supports your argument about the right to life of animals when you explicitly state that your conclusions are due to your lifestyle, and not to any sort of reasoning. Also, if I may be cynical, I must point out that if you elected to eat beef, that more cattle would be raised to meet demand, and another cow would have the opportunity to have at least some life. If you bought free-range beef, it would even be fairly pleasant, if a bit short. In other words, by your actions you are implying that your answer to my question is &quot;(b) to never have lived&quot;. If you&#39;re comfortable with that, that&#39;s fine. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a &quot;right answer&quot; here, but I do ask that you have a coherent argument...<br /><br />This said, there are other interesting and more coherent arguments for vegetarianism, or at least restricting what you eat. Let&#39;s get past cows and cats, and talk about people. Suppose I had a farm where I raised people for food. (Soylent Green, yum!) Clearly, those people only existed because I put their parents in cages with a bottle of cheap wine and Isaac Hayes on the stereo, so by my previous argument, we should feel comfortable slaughtering them when they&#39;re nice and tender and eating them. Clearly, I don&#39;t want to take this position, however, so I need another principle! So let me take the principle that eating things that are too similar to me is bad. We can all agree on some boundary conditions (eating people = bad, eating lettuce = good), so where do you draw the line? Are other primates OK? Monkeys? Mammals? Chordates (things with backbones)? Animals? By this argument, you can choose to draw the line wherever you like, and I can&#39;t really argue with you. So for you, eating animals is bad. And for me, mammals are tasty, but monkeys are not to be eaten.

I&#39;ll say again I&#39;m not entirely against eating animals, but I find the &quot;why&quot; killing &quot;which&quot; animals is okay and not others interesting. I personally find these social rules are not based in science, but just based entirely on human convenience, not necessity.<br /><br />There&#39;s no scientific or rational reason imho that:<br />- Killing a pig is okay as long as it ends up in a happy meal<br />- Killing a pig is okay if it is for sport<br />- Killing a pig is not okay if it is done in anger (but not eaten)<br /><br />I think it&#39;s sad that this cat was killed, and I most certainly think the guy needs help. But I&#39;d also argue by extension that it&#39;s no worse than those animals that are killed to end up in a happy meal. Just because there&#39;s a &quot;system&quot; in place to kill animals and put them in pretty packages doesn&#39;t justify it for me.<br /><br />I&#39;ve also spent quite a bit of time in the last year or so learning about food production in the United States and this has influenced my views quite a bit. I don&#39;t think you can effectively argue these days that a) meat production is necessary or that b) animals that are raised for meat are privileged. Most of these animals spend their lives diseased and in constant discomfort, only to be slaughtered for no real reason other than the fact that we like their taste. We don&#39;t even need them for nutrition. Some could even argue that animals that are domesticated and then killed in one violent rage by a human actually live a <em>more</em> fufilling life.<br /><br />On one hand we have unnecessary killing as a result of the whim of a violent man,<br />and on the other hand unnecessary killing as a result of the whim of a violent society.<br />It doesn&#39;t seem like apples and oranges to me.<br /><br />The &quot;how&quot; and &quot;what&quot; makes the killing &quot;justified&quot; isn&#39;t scientific or rational, it&#39;s just a social construct of pure convenience. Most people have no idea where or how their &quot;food&quot; got to them - I think this makes it easy to keep eating meat. But I think that any person here who finds this story upsetting, will feel equally so if they take an unbiased view of food production in the U.S.

				My fantasy is that all the people who spend mental energy&nbsp; defending animal agriculture would use it instead to argue for humane animal treatment.&nbsp; Human beings can do SO MUCH better than they do.<br />Right now, animal agriculture corporatations make the rules.&nbsp; These &quot;protections&quot; everyone reassures themselves about are a joke.<br />&nbsp;For starters, birds are not even covered under the Animal Welfare Act period.&nbsp; So you can do anything you want to turkeys, chickens.&nbsp; Because they are birds does that mean we should not show any mercy?<br />It&#39;s more profitable to raise animals like they are machines and that&#39;s what has happened. <br />It&#39;s perfectly legal to abuse and mutilate farm animals, it&#39;s part of the system.<br />Why not support changes?&nbsp; A simple email on an issue or a phone call to your representative.&nbsp; They&#39;re just adding up the numbers who call or email.&nbsp; Then they are pressured to do the right thing. Some of them already want to do the right thing actually and would like to get some support from us.<br />The industries rely on people to keep quiet, believe propaganda and defend them so they don&#39;t have to.<br />Just because it&#39;s &#39;how things are done&#39; doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not a violation of the moral contract.<br />&nbsp;

Anger is part of being human after all, why restrict it (exept when it comes to him hurting other humans of course). This doesn&#39;t work for me currently.<br /><br />I know that it&#39;s easy to just dismiss the PITA crowd as crazy (I think some of them are crazy), but I think people owe it to themselves to take a look at food production and animal handling in the U.S. If the idea of someone killing a cat for no good reason is disturbing to you, consider what humans and animals go through to get meat to your plate - it&#39;s equally disturbing I promise. Cows in the U.S. don&#39;t &quot;graze on pastures&quot; or &quot;eat grass&quot;. The same is true for every other conventional meat product. Our ideas about meat production are entirely fictional constructs.<br /><br />If we all ate meat that was raised the way we imagine they are I wouldn&#39;t have a problem.

(There are only 3 horse slaughterhouses in the U.S., all foreign-owned, killing about 100,000 horses a year, the meat goes overseas.) These are horses from many places, horse racing, farms etc. &nbsp;Just an example of recent action on an animal issue. &nbsp;It took a few minutes to call his office. Now he knows one more voter is watching this issue as well as &#39;animal &#39;issues in general. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;I do have to get back to work.<br />Harlan what is your zip code btw?

				Many people who assault or kill other people start by abusing animals. &nbsp;I think this is a terrible situation and feel for the woman and her cat. &nbsp;I am glad they caught him and hope they throw the book at him. &nbsp;<br />I also don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to &quot;own&quot; a cat. &nbsp;Cats do their own thing and tolerate (as well as sometimes enjoy) humans. &nbsp;Some dogs one might own, but cats you can&#39;t - they&#39;re not pets, they are feline companions.

				I think technically cats are considered &quot;wild animals&quot; so you can&#39;t really own them. <br /><br />They own you!!! :lol:
