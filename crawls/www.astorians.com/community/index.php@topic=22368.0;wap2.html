			Hi there,<br /><br />I am a 29/F looking for a buddy to run with. I am not a runner by any means. I used to smoke for years and never work out. I don&#039;t even have a gym membership.<br /><br />Turning over a new leaf....so with that said, I would like someone who is at my level or a bit in better shape. I am looking to run at least 3-4 times a week, anytime. <br /><br />If you are in the ditmars area and interested please send a message! <br /><br />Thanks for reading&nbsp; :smiley:

			I came here to post something similar. I&#039;m a terrible runner and haven&#039;t even tried to run since last spring, but I want to try it again. Looking for a buddy, particularly in the Broadway vicinity. <br /><br /><br />I could run in the mornings around 9 or 10, or in the evenings. If anyone is interested I can get more specific.
