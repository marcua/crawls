				Hello Astorians,<br /><br /><br />I am a mother of a 3.5 year-old boy and we are looking for a pre-K in Astoria.&nbsp; We moved here from Russia about 2 months ago, so my son doesn&#039;t speak much English. He is very sociable and loves to play with kids, though.&nbsp; He loves his taekwondo classes that we&#039;ve started 3 weeks ago.&nbsp; He used to go to a pre-K for a full day, from 8 am to 5 pm, back in Russia, so being away from Mom isn&#039;t a problem.<br /><br /><br />I am interested in your experience and recommendations, both positive and negative.&nbsp; It&#039;s important to know where <strong>not</strong> to go, too. :)<br /><br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Welcome.<br />My first advice (and I mean this in the most helpful way so please don&#039;t be offended) would be to help your son with speaking and understanding English. My son has a friend that started in a 3 year old program not speaking or understanding English and the poor little guy was throwing up every school day morning (3 days a week) from the stress. It was VERY difficult for the teacher as well because he wasn&#039;t understanding what she was saying. He was much better by the end of the year but it was a very rough year. Last year in my son&#039;s preK class the students that didn&#039;t understand and speak English also had a difficult time. It is very stressful for a child to not understand and be able to communicate with others in the classroom.<br /><br /><br />As far as pre k I can only tell you about those around me (30th Ave area) PS 234- I have a friend that is there and is very happy. I toured the school for K (it&#039;s our zoned school) and found the staff there very nice and pleasant the school is new and very clean. I would have happily sent my son there if he hadn&#039;t tested into the g&amp;t program. <br /><br /><br />I sent my son to PS 70 for preK because I heard wonderful things about that program. I was very pleased with the program but I didn&#039;t like the principal and the overall feeling of the school. I still recommend the pre k program though, I think it&#039;s one of the strongest. As far as I know it&#039;s the only one that gives homework, not much just practice writing a letter of the alphabet over the weekend and bring in objects that start with the letter and talk about them on Monday. I think this really helped the children speak in front of the class. The teachers were warm, caring and very good with the children.<br /><br /><br />I have heard good things about Queensview Nursery School too.<br /><br /><br />The children that I know that went to preK at daycare centers didn&#039;t learn much if anything academically it was more of a playtime. <br />I wanted my son to have the 2.5 hours to be more academic to help prepare him for Kindergarten.<br /><br /><br />You can check out public school at schools.nyc.gov all schools have grades and you can also see how parents grade the school and principal.<br />also insideschools.org<br />Good luck feel free to PM if you have any other questions.

				Thank you so much for such a detailed and thorough reply.&nbsp; <br />Yes, English seems to be a real problem.&nbsp; Today&#039;s taekwondo class clearly showed that to me.&nbsp; <br />I wonder how he could learn the language better than just with me and Sesame Street... <br />Are there English classes for kids as little as him, so that there would be some communication with either a teacher or a group?<br />Besides, he really wants to be around kids and I&#039;d rather have it in an organized environment, not just the playground...<br /><br /><br />Well, I guess we&#039;ll just have to work on it both ways - learn English at home and still try to go to pre-K.

				I did not mean to imply that your son shouldn&#039;t go to pre k unless he speaks English- I think it is an important program for ALL kids it is just harder for the non-English speaking kids.<br /><br /><br />Once a child is registered for public Kindergarten there is a language assessment and if a child needs help there are classes within the schools to help. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if there are any English classes for kids in the area. Have you tried Muzzy - it&#039;s a web language program for kids? <br />I have heard good things about it. <br />We are not a big TV family but many friends have used PBS tv to help their children learn English.<br />I think most branches of the library have a weekly story time for kids, some have playgroups too.<br />LIC kids may have a class or playgroup you could join to be around other kids, maybe the YMCA in LIC, there are also several Mom groups in Astoria (yahoo groups I think) you could check those out too.

				I just got freaked out for a moment about him not speaking English and I see your point about pre-K being an important program for all kids. :)<br /><br /><br />How do you get registered for public Kindergarten?&nbsp; I realize that it&#039;s still in future for us, but I&#039;ve heard that there is a way to do it online.&nbsp; When is the right time to do this?&nbsp; Maybe you should get on waiting lists ahead of time?<br /><br /><br />I haven&#039;t tried Muzzy out, but I&#039;ll sure take a look.&nbsp; Right now we&#039;re using a lot of iPad things to learn words and alphabet and numbers as well as real life situations, names of places, phone numbers that we come across every day... We aren&#039;t a TV family either.&nbsp; Right now we don&#039;t have a TVset at home, so no PBS.&nbsp; We find Sesame Street songs on YouTube and Netflix because of my son&#039;s great love for Elmo.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I have never heard about libraries having storytime for kids and playgroups - that&#039;s totally cool!! Thank you for advice, I&#039;ll definitely find out more.&nbsp; And, yes, playgroups in different places - that&#039;s one of our options as well.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Thank you so much for all the ideas!<br /><br />

				I&#039;m not sure if you&#039;re looking for info about private pre-K&#039;s as well as public ones, and I&#039;m not sure what part of Astoria you&#039;re in, but there&#039;s an excellent day care (kids ages 2-5) with some slots available (she just expanded):<br /><br /><br />Khensee WangmoGroup Family Day Care42-20 Ditmars347-449-4771 <br /><br /><br />She follows the Montessori model, and the parents I know who have sent their children there absolutely love it. My son will be starting next week. For what it&#039;s worth, I know a Russian woman who is sending her 2.5 year old son there, and at this point I think he speaks mainly Russian. I can probably put you in touch with her if you want to send me a message!

				Yes, I am looking for info about both private and public pre-K&#039;s. Geographically, we are on 21st St. and 30 Ave.<br />I&#039;ve heard a lot of good things about Khensee Wnagmo herself, so I&#039;m definitely interested!<br /><br />

				<br />As far as I know there is no early registration for public kindergarten and there is no waiting list for general ed. kindergarten.<br /><br />If you decide to go with public pre K I would check: schools.nyc.gov to check out the registration deadline and get more information.<br />When I registered my son I had to do it at the school and bring him with me, I also had to bring proof of address and his birth certificate. You will get a form to take to your Dr. for proof of immunization and a physical, this is to be returned at the start of the school year.<br /><br /><br />As far as kindergarten registration- there is a time frame (check the website for the dates) in late winter or spring for the following school year. Again you have to go to the school in person and apply with your child (at least that&#039;s how it was last year).<br />You may apply to any school you wish but if it is not your zoned school your chance of getting in can be slim to none depending upon the school. <br />You can check the website to find your zoned school or call 311 (when I was checking on schools the website wasn&#039;t working that well).<br /><br /><br />I think the only registering you can do online is for charter schools and to sign your child up to take the Gifted and Talented test.<br />Charter schools are chosen by lottery- they have a waiting list so even if you aren&#039;t chosen at first if you have a low number you may still get in. <br />&nbsp;<br />You have the option in pre K to have your child tested for the &quot;gifted and talent&quot; program if your child does well you can apply to selected schools that offer the program.<br />Slots in those schools are given by score (higher the score the better your chance of getting the school of your choice) your child is guaranteed a spot in the program but it may not be your first choice.<br /><br /><br />I am probably giving you too much information and your head feels like it&#039;s going to explode! <br /><br /><br />You have time.&nbsp; Talk to parents about schools, check out the school websites, for kindergarten you can tour the schools. Luckily there are a lot of options in the area, and some really good schools. There are also plenty of private options but I am not familiar with those.

				I highly recommend Kid Krazy.&nbsp; I believe the opened up a second location near Astoria Blvd. and 31st Street.&nbsp; Both of my sons went to Pre-K there, the teachers and staff were all fantastic.&nbsp; There are plenty of non-English speakers in Astoria who start Pre-K not knowing much English but kids seem to learn so fast I think it evens out pretty quickly.

				We sent our daughter to Immaculate Conception on 29th street and Ditmars.&nbsp; The preK teacher is excellent, very patient and nurturing.&nbsp; They have extra aides in the classroom so children are able to get a lot of individual attention.&nbsp; They have an open house coming up very soon, and I believe that they will admit children year-round.<br />&nbsp;<br />Check out their website - http://icsastoria.org (http://icsastoria.org).&nbsp; &nbsp;Please don&#039;t judge them by the website though - go and tour it yourself and see how warm and caring the teachers and children are are.
