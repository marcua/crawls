				I have a date with a dog next weekend (the 4-legged variety) and need some help.&nbsp; I offered to take my best friend and her newly aquired, insanely overactive yet incredibly adorable pooch to a dog run.&nbsp; I hear there is an enclosed dog run in Astoria Park.&nbsp; I also recently heard there is a dog run at Socrates Sculpture Park? And I think there may be one somewhere on Vernon Blvd.&nbsp; Any info on any one of these or any others nearby would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks in advance.

				There is a dog run on Astoria Boulevard right near the river. <br /><br />However, I am concerned that &#039;newly acquired&#039; might mean puppy. If so, please have the owner check with a vet before taking any puppy to any dog run. If the dog is not fully vaccinated the run is a dangerous place for the dog. A &#039;newly acquired&#039; dog may not be responsive to commands by the owner and might be a target of other, perhaps older, dogs who see the pup as an interloper. If the dog is not well-socialized, any dog run can be a dangerous place.<br /><br />Dog runs are for well-behaved dogs who do not play roughly with other dogs; are not fearful of new things and do not intimidate others.<br /><br />They are also the filthiest places. <br /><br />I have been using the same vet for 30+ years, and he makes clients sign a form that you will not allow your dog to use a public dog run as many of the diseases caught there cannot be successfully treated. <br /><br />I take my dogs to parks during off-leash hours, and to many well-kept facilities out of the City, where they are maintained by local municipalities in pristine conditions, but never to a run here in the City which are in disgusting shape. My dogs are fully vaccinated, middle-aged, completely socialized and are (relatively) well-behaved.

				Thanks for the response and for relaying your concerns.&nbsp; &quot;Newly acquired&quot; meant my friend got the dog about 2 months ago althought the dog is about a year old.&nbsp; She is very sociable and good with other dogs.&nbsp; However, after reading your response, I think we might just play in the yard...

				As a DIY-type and someone who loves a project, I have set my sights on finding a space that could be turned into a dog park for those of us who live in and around the Steinway/Broadway crossroads. It is easier than writing a dissertation, but I digress. <br /><br />I won&#039;t really do anything about this until summer rolls around but have already read bits and pieces of web material about starting a dog run. That said, and knowing next to nothing about this, I have had my eyes on the nearly empty lot at the corner of 34th Ave and (I think)&nbsp; 36th Street, diagonally across from Cafe Bar. It used to be an auto service station of some type? I want it to be a small, clean and safe dog run. I don&#039;t have a pot to *bleep* in so where I think I would secure funding to buy such a plot is fully beyond me but if the shopping mall developers and condo builders can use eminent domain to their consumption content, why, oh why can&#039;t I?<br /><br />Mostly I am posting to see if there are any other doggie-do-righters in the nabe who would be interested in jumping on my barely crafted dog run bandwagon. Thoughts? Takers? Nay sayers?

				I like the dog run over in Bayside along the water.&nbsp; That whole stretch along the Cross Island Pkway, under the Throggs Neck Bridge up to Northern Blvd. is really pretty and a great walk for you, friend and dog.<br /><br />Head towards the Whitestone Bridge (Astoria Blvd. will take u in that direction) and hop on the Cross Island. Get off about two exits past the Bridge at the Utopia Pkwy exit.&nbsp; Go a few blocks till u hit Utopia Pkwy inersection (which is just a Boulevard).&nbsp; &nbsp;turn LEFT, going over the Cross Is. and you&#039;ll see the beginning of the Little Bay Park on your right.&nbsp; The dog run is on your right also.&nbsp; Down by the water is a walk way that goes on for a couple miles.<br /><br />SWEET! :mrgreen:

				mronda, I know that lot you&#039;re talking about across from the film studios.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know why the owner has been sitting on it so long but he doesn&#039;t seem to be going anywhere with it.&nbsp; <br /><br />AJ, I never knew there was a dog run there either cuz I always got off Cr. Island at Bell Blvd. and parked in the lot near Ft. Totten.&nbsp; A friend turned me on to it so that&#039;s why I get off an exit earlier.&nbsp; Tons of parking right on the street near the warer.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t usually go to the dog run.&nbsp; I just walk for a while with the fur baby and stare at the water.<br /><br />Good luck, mronda with your idea.&nbsp;

				That would make sense cuz this lot was originally a gas station.&nbsp; For awhile people parked there but the owner put up a link fence to prevent that.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t noticed what it looks like lately.&nbsp; Truthfully, I don&#039;t see that place being a desirable dog run.&nbsp; there&#039;s gotta be some place better suited.&nbsp; what about down by the water closer to Astoria Park?

				I tried to look for the dog run in Astoria Park, but what I found was concrete surrounded by a high chain-link fence. The gate part was padlocked, and the only entrance was a small break in the chain-link that looks like someone can sneak in if they crawl through.&nbsp; Is that it, or was I in the wrong spot? I found that area near the bridge, in close proximity to the children&#039;s playground.<br /><br />
