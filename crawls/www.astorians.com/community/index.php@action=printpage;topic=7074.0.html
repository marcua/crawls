				Where were you on 07/13/1977, 30 years ago today? It was the day the lights went out in New York City, a citywide blackout that caught everybody off guard, and sparked off looting in alot of neighborhoods. <br /><br /><br />Here a link to nice article about that day in the NY Times. Check out the photo gallery, lots of memories.<br /><br />http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/07/13/the-night-the-lights-went-out/ (http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/07/13/the-night-the-lights-went-out/)<br /><br /><br />I remember that hot summer night, sitting on the front stoop of my home with my family, eating the ice cream from the fridge before it all melted away.

				Mom had gone oversees to visit her parents and poor Dad was stuck overnight at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where he worked.&nbsp; They had to mobilize because they were afraid of looters.&nbsp; My Dad told me that it was such an eerie night.&nbsp; He had to walk the miles of hallways with a flashlight all night long.&nbsp; The Egyptian Galleries were especially scary.&nbsp; My brother and I had purchased lobsters that night and were planning to surprise Dad with a nice meal.&nbsp; We didn&#039;t know what to do with them so we set them free in the East River.&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp; Maybe they made their way back to Maine!

				I was safely tucked away in the midwest, although my wacky preacher uncle thought that the Son of Sam would somehow make it to Minnesota so he used to preach about the danger (and evil) of making out in parked cars.&nbsp; <br /><br />I vaguely remember watching people looting in NYC on the national news!&nbsp; I think my uncle thought the looters were going to come to Minnesota as well and probably had a sermon about it.<br /><br />

				In July 1977 I would have been 15 y/o, so I was most likely off on some summer holiday with my family.

				Things went black at LaGuardia Lanes that Wednesday night.&nbsp; Was due to begin the night shift at 11pm at United Parcel Service in Maspeth.&nbsp; No juice, no work; radio of the old &#039;67 Camaro reported power in Rockland county.&nbsp; Made tracks.&nbsp; Found lights, a cold beer, live music, and air conditioning (it had been 93 when the lights quit).&nbsp; Returned with sunrise on Thursday via Harlem River Drive and Triborough; plenty of smoke from the night&#039;s hijinx clouding the Bronx.&nbsp; <br /><br />Not a witness to lobster liberation in the East River, but saw some twisted humans by the Hudson.&nbsp; They caused a traffic jam at Palisades Parkway overlook so they could gaze through the night sky across the mighty Hudson and see...nothing.<br /><br />A few years later was working in Bushwick and East New York.&nbsp; Locals said that most stores folded for keeps that night.&nbsp; Picture the full length of Ditmars or 30th Avenue or Broadway -- open for business before, but mostly cementblock, rusting scissor gates and busted windows thereafter.&nbsp; That&#039;s what shopping was like for nearly twenty years.&nbsp; Astoria had remarkable fortune to ride out the worst days, but for a lot of New Yorkers, those that were elsewhere or not yet born were to be envied.
