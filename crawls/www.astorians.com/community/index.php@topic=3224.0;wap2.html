			I posted this under the community calender, but since we have the new sports thread (thank you Merm) I&#39;ll just repost here; please vote at the original posting (we have 6/7 players so far, need at least 16).&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Slow Pitch, Co-ed fun softball game, Sunday 9/10, 11am, Queensbridge Park LIC<br /><br />I will provide bat and balls and bases, but at least half of players need to bring a glove (we can share them).&nbsp; If/when I get enough respondents will post more detailed info. Queensbridge park is located on the East river directly north of the Queensboro bridge; total novices welcome.&nbsp; &nbsp;Seven or nine inning game, we&#39;ll see how it goes.&nbsp; Football starts that day so gotta keep that into consideration&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />Thanks, Rob
