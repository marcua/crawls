				You know things are bad when you are told not to run for election. DailyKos had a diary posted about this and some people (NYers I think) weren&#039;t to happy about the White House meddling in local politics. Others made the point though, that Paterson&#039;s running could hurt other races including Congressional and Sen Gillibrand&#039;s election. And I have to agree with that. What do you think? <br /><br />The last point of the NYT article was that this gives AG Cuomo and opening to run against Paterson in the Primary.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the article.<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/20/nyregion/20paterson.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;ref=nyregion&amp;adxnnlx=1253469703-pAVVl/3QmwIHh8o2KHc3Zg (http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/20/nyregion/20paterson.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;ref=nyregion&amp;adxnnlx=1253469703-pAVVl/3QmwIHh8o2KHc3Zg)

				It&#039;s kind of sad how few people are capable of keeping things confidential, given the amount of dirt that seems to be constantly leaking out of the Obama administration. If I were Obama, I think I&#039;d be seriously working on finding out who these people are and making sure they understand that confidential means confidential, or they&#039;re out. I doubt it&#039;s really all that unusual for the White House to meddle in state politics, but perhaps past administrations have been able to keep their mouths shut in such situations.<br /><br />I also think it&#039;s very lame that Rangel went out and said that the party would become racially polarized if Cuomo took on Paterson. It is my understanding that Paterson&#039;s popularity is low, even among black people. Rangel sucks. Paterson sucks. It has nothing to do with being black.

The confidentiality concern kind of ties in with all the s___ that was coming out from the Paterson people during the process of replacing Hillary Clinton as senator, other things I can&#039;t think of at the moment, and even something as silly as Obama telling a reporter off the record that Kanye West is a jackass. It just seems to be a widespread problem.

				<br />Thanks K for the article link. And I agree somewhat with Essen. The timing seems a bit odd to me. Leaks generally do not bother me at all, especially if intentional.<br />I would rather though hear on the record reporting.<br />How much would the White House be playing a part in state elections?<br /><br />Obama did not step aside in considering running for President.<br /><br />Paterson should freely run to be elected as governor. Cuomo should contest if he believes he would do a better job.<br />Which candidate do you think would likely be more effective? And towards what aims?<br /><br />It would be a shame if the Democratic party looks to squelch primaries as much as the GOP does. A party should be democratic, yes?<br />Speaking of which, when would Giuliani need to get his hat in to challenge Lazio.<br />Do you believe Paterson would have no real chance against Giuliani. Is there a concern that too many voters might come out to the election polls in 2010?<br /><br />While the gossip and games intrigue me, none of it matters really in my case. I really only imagine one unlikely scenario to vote for a Party candidate in 2010.<br /><br />As the <span class="bbc_u">vote for Governor determines party status </span> in NYS, I am almost certain to vote minor party again for Governor.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Gregory Meeks who carried the water for the party breaking the political reality to Gov. Clueless, the leak likely happened very high up the food chain.&nbsp; Let&#039;s be totally frank - all proper steps were followed.&nbsp; If a black Governor won&#039;t listen to the word of his (black) President who passed on the word thru a black congressman, I&#039;d say all levels of decorum were followed and any jokes you hear on SNL in the next 10 months are gonna be that much funner Now.

				Would it be too much to ask that the President actually take more time governing and less time campaining? He doesn&#039;t get to vote in NY. He is not a resident of NY. The POTUS should have no opinion on who should be the Governor of any state other than the one in which he can cast ONE vote, just like any other citizen.

				That&#039;s the trouble with state apparatchiks.&nbsp; They&#039;d like POTUS to load into AirForce One, touch down in their little backwater, ride up to the rally being held (with at least one other damaged-goods congressman, say Charley Rangel, in tow) touch the hem of the garment and inject a little of that potency a Gov. Clueless lacks.&nbsp; But then they don&#039;t want any other input?&nbsp; It works both ways.

When campaign season rolls around in a year, you can bet Obama will be campaigning on behalf of Democratic candidates, just as Presidents have done for most of the history of the Republic. If Paterson wins the primary (I&#039;ll eat my hat), you can be that Obama will be there cheering him on against Rudy (who would win). <br /><br />And TRX, the President can&#039;t prevent Paterson from running again, and he&#039;s not... This seems to be all intra-party politics, not official at all.

				Wow.

And NYC still working way through city elections.<br /><br />May be interesting to hear Paterson this Sunday on MTP.<br />But not sure why they would have Pres. Clinton.<br /><br />Appears most other shows are well focused on foreign affairs and Afghanistan.<br />This Week - ABC<br /><br />Liking more and more CNN - State of the Union.<br /><br /><br />

				While I&#039;m not sure on the law, it was a surprise to me, I think having a Lt. Governor might keep the clowns in the State Senate in order.<br /><br />Paterson is a good man, but he hasn&#039;t been a particularly effective Governor and his poll numbers are in the toilet.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it is possible for him to win re-election, let alone re-nomination. but stranger things have happened.&nbsp; I&#039;m a big fan of Cuomo - I think he would be a good candidate for Governor.
