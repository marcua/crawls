				Forgive me if I&#039;m off-topic, but I thought CSA people might be the ones to know: are there zoning regulations against farm animals in Astoria?&nbsp; I keep thinking about how wonderful it would be to have some hens in the back yard.

				I laughed when I read this!&nbsp; My husband always says that he would love some hens in our backyard.&nbsp; I am sure there are laws against this, although years ago there was a rooster somewhere around 43rd Street and 21st Avenue that would wake everyone up.&nbsp; An older neighbor of my brother&#039;s kept it as a pet!

				Just Food has more information about this. <br /><br />As far as I know, you are allowed hens (no roosters) in NYC (there is a growing movement in Brooklyn w/ folks keeping hens). Not sure of pen regulations and such, but I would check with Just Food. There are a couple orgs trying to get people to keep hens in the city so there is def info out there. If you don&#039;t own the building, I would ask the landlord, as they might not want all that hen poop and chatter around! <br /><br />If you do keep some hens.... I&#039;ll be happy to take some eggs off your hands! (I want to get some myself but with travel and not owning my building it is not yet possible).

				I&#039;m laughing too!&nbsp; My son was just asking today if he could raise a chicken from egg-hood.&nbsp; I told him usually the mother chickens hatch the eggs, but I also remember a teacher at a school in Manhattan having an incubator in her classroom and hatching out eggs for the kids to watch the process.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what happened to them afterwards.<br /><br />I was also trying to find an article I saw once about people in the East Village (of course) building a coop in their apartment.&nbsp; I have a cat so I can&#039;t see that ending happily.&nbsp; But maybe if you have a really cool landlord...

				When William Grimes was the food critic for the NY Times, he wrote a series of articles about keeping chicken(s) in his backyard in Astoria.&nbsp; I believe the chicken found him - but disappeared before he ever got the benefit of an egg.

				That article was hysterical. I cut it out and saved it for a long time.&nbsp; He found the chicken in the backyard and she did lay eggs eventually.&nbsp; Then he did a taste taste against various egg brands, organic etc.&nbsp; He declared hers the best. He also marvelled at how easy it was to care for and wondered &#039;why everyone didn&#039;t have one.&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; It&nbsp; included several photos of the chicken integrating herself into the small crew of cats he fed.

				I think that hens keep laying even if there are no roosters around.&nbsp; The eggs won&#039;t be fertilized, but that&#039;s actually a plus to me.&nbsp; My mom is a docent on a farm in the Midwest and some people actually prefer to eat fertilized eggs.&nbsp; No judgement, but hmm...<br /><br />I keep laughing at the idea of keeping hens, too.&nbsp; It might be fun to keep them in the living room, then take them for walks on little harnesses or let them roam around the yard when I can keep an eye on them.&nbsp; My neighbors already think I&#039;m the madwoman of Astoria for trying to raise tomatoes and peppers on the porch and corn and sunflowers in the backyard; I wouldn&#039;t want to deprive them of the shock of seeing me take my flock for a walk down the sidewalk.<br /><br />I read the Grimes article and ordered the book.&nbsp; And I&#039;ve found another hen article- the one about people raising hens in an East Village co-op.&nbsp; Here&#039;s the link: http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/17/garden/17chickens.html?ex=1186545600&amp;en=a4742111a3ababaa&amp;ei=5070<br /><br />I&#039;ll keep you posted on how Chicken Talk 2007 goes with my landlord.

The eggs we eat are the unfertilized ones. You cannot eat a fertilized egg (at least not until it hatches and becomes a chicken :-P). <br /><br />Most hens don&#039;t lay every single day, but you&#039;d get four or five eggs per hen per week. They typically don&#039;t have a strong nesting instinct when they know the eggs aren&#039;t fertilized and they are not hard to collect. Try collecting an egg from a chicken who knows her egg has a good chance of having been fertilized, and you&#039;re likely to wind up with some nasty peck marks. <br /><br />Hens are easy to raise and care for, and they&#039;ll eat just about anything (including mice!). However, the mess they make is vile, and there&#039;s a lot of it--make sure you have a place to dump it before you get a boxful of chicks. Hens can peacefully cohabit with cats--they&#039;re kind of vicious towards them and cats will keep their distance once they&#039;ve been pecked a time or two. You also have to keep their wings clipped, which is not a fun chore (yes, chickens can fly--badly, but well enough to make it over a five-foot fence). I would *definitely* not keep them in the house.

				Glad to hear that Grimes got the egg(s)!&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D<br /><br />But people can - and do - eat fertilized eggs (note that a blood spot in an egg does not mean it has been fertilized).&nbsp; Some people believe they are more healthful, although I don&#039;t think that is true.&nbsp; You can get them at the Union Square Greenmarket sometimes, although they cost more than unfertilized eggs.

				I guess I should have elaborated that someone raising hens for eggs would need to candle the egg before eating it--at some point in the process (not sure when, I never raised roosters), eating a fertilized egg is a problem because there&#039;s really a baby chick inside. If the egg is fertilized but harvested soon, there is no difference between it and an unfertilized egg.

(Seriously. I grew up on a farm with free-range chickens...)<br /><br />That&#039;s cool that you can have hens. I would love to do that.<br /><br />Even better would be a goat. Fresh milk! I remember reading that up until 1910ish there was a building in Manhattan that would sell live goats. People in Queens and Brooklyn would buy them, take them back to their homes and keep them in their backyards until they were ready for a big feast. I may have the dates messed up, and I cannot find where I originally read that, but I think it&#039;s true.

				There&#039;s also a place like this on 20th Avenue and 33rd Street. You can hear the animals inside when walking by.&nbsp; I think they slaughter them for you upon purchase.&nbsp; &nbsp;:killme:

				The places that sell under the tracks sell them live and then slaughter them for you after purchase. I&#039;ve never had one b/c I can&#039;t bring myself into those places. The chickens are kept in horrible conditions and it smells terrible in there.<br /><br />Roosters are not allowed in NYC, but hens a plenty are. I think that&#039;s mostly to keep the eggs as eating eggs and make sure we don&#039;t get overpopulated with chickens in NYC. Although I&#039;d much rather see chickens run around then rats, but whatever. Also to keep the roosters from crowing at 4:30 AM I would think.<br /><br />There was an article in Edible Brooklyn a while back about folks in Brooklyn keeping eggs. I&#039;d love to see/ hear about this movement growing in Queens. You do sort of need to keep them outside I think (smell) and build enough shelter that they can survive a chilly winter (though they&#039;re furry so it&#039;s not a huge problem). They just need a big cage.<br /><br />Talk about fresh goat milk though... I would kill for a cow!<br /><br />And speaking of live goats for slaughter at a feast... Someone mentioned 1910ish is the last they heard about a slaughter, but I have a friend who was living in Astoria about 10 years ago and walked outside during Greek Easter and saw a red puddle in the back alley of her house. She didn&#039;t understand what it was-- was someone painting? She followed the blood to find a family with a fresh slaughtered goat hoisting it up over the spit. I bet it was delicious!!! So... my point is I bet this still goes on today. If not, folks just go to International Meat and buy a whole goat or lamb from them and roast it up. YUM!
