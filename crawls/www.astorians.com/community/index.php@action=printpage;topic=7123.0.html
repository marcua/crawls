				<strong>So, there I was cruising the &#039;net today, and all of a sudden I came across this craaaazy mad expensive &quot;bottled water&quot;. http://www.blingh2o.com/ (http://www.blingh2o.com/) i was just wondering if anybody had ever seen it before, what they think of it, and if they think that it fits in todays American consumerism society.</strong><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Too weird.&nbsp; The word bling has definitely been overused.&nbsp; And really, &quot;Swarovski&quot; and &quot;Tennessee&quot; should never be used in the same sentence.&nbsp; :-D

				I hate the word bling.&nbsp; I am so not into labels that state their name in big letters all over their product, bling, grillz, and anything else that declares to the world just how much money you have and how much you think you&#039;re special because you happen to have it.&nbsp; And bling water?&nbsp; It&#039;s just water people!!&nbsp; But yes, Americans will eat it up.&nbsp; It&#039;s sad really, that people would spend that kind of money for water when there are plenty of those less fortunate around the world who don&#039;t even have clean drinking water.&nbsp; Kevin Boyd should at least donate the proceeds to charity.

				They can&#039;t be serious... Now all the celeb-wannabes of NYC will be requesting this along with their $350 bottle of Vodka (which only cost $24 in a liquor store)... perfect!
