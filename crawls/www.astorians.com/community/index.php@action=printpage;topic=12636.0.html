				I have a couple of larger sewing projects (a new lining that needs to be put in a fur vest, a daybed cover, etc.), and I used to rely on a great guy on the corner of 31st ave and 34th to tackle stuff like this for a great price (he also did great leather repair). Sadly, he left to go back to Egypt for Ramadan a few months ago and still hasn&#039;t returned. Does anyone know of another great someone-more-than-a-basic-seamstress/tailor in Astoria who handles projects like this? Thanks so much!

				San Remo on Steinway between Broadway and 34th Ave is awesome.&nbsp; Very old school, excellent work, and great pricing.&nbsp;

				Thanks! I was wondering about San Remo- I know that their tailoring is excellent, but I wasn&#039;t sure how I would be received if I came in with a pillowcase that I needed to be copied in a different fabric (yeah, I know it&#039;s not tough to do myself, but I have a few items ahead of a sewing machine on my &quot;buy-off-of Craigs&quot;- list...)

				I brought them a cloth purse with an open seam and frayed handles, and they repaired it.&nbsp; Though I felt a little silly not being able to do it myself.&nbsp;

				Does anyone know if they can work on leather/suede, i.e. a bag? I have a bag that&#039;s falling apart and was thinking of taking it to a shoe repair place for lack of a better idea...
