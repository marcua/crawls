				Not that I&#39;m intentionally trying to tie this back the the religion thread, but here&#39;s an observation...<br /><br />Isn&#39;t it ironic that it&#39;s the same people that are anti-abortion are also against a safety net like this?&nbsp; They don&#39;t give a crap what happens to the kids after they&#39;re born, just as long as they&#39;re born.&nbsp; Smacks of hypocracy.

				I&#39;m not sure how I feel about this...I&quot;m generally not for more government intervention, and what of families, women, that choose not to have a family, not to breast feed, not to take time off work, because they want to work on their careers, and make the choice to do so. Would granting others that made family their priority be punishing those that made career a priority...I&#39;m not sure...Not taking a stance yet.

				I have been to other countries and sadly enough when it comes to social services we are low on the list. <br /><br />We&#39;re fortunate here in NY because there is insurance for persons that have low incomes or that their jobs don&#39;t provide for insurance but that&#39;s not the case for other States.<br /><br />It&#39;s sad to see that we have money to pay for wars that make no sense but we don&#39;t have money for maternity/family/insurance plans.&nbsp; <br /><br />There really is no excuse.

I think what people don&#39;t realize is that if you make it more expensive to employ women, the pay scale difference between men and women will only worsen. On the employer side, I&#39;m not going to pay you much because you might decide to have a kid and and cost me money without me gaining any benefit from it. It&#39;s how the market works.

				To step back from the religious or market employment views; Good government should most definitely be part of social and public care.&nbsp; There should be a level of support for preventative medicine and affordable health care. The president wants to offer tax breaks so people can afford health care. Isn&#39;t this just the govt subsidizing the health care industry?&nbsp; Some sort of national health care would be a fine thing.&nbsp; No matter what you think, it is sad that once again the US is so far behind in basic things like maternity leave.<br /><br />As long as the govt. can afford to subsidize the oil industries, defense contractors, wars and any other group Then there should be money for social services and education.&nbsp; Why not? it&#39;s our money.
