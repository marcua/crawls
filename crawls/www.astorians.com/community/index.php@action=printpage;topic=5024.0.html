				** Maybe Wang would open the season.&nbsp; :mrgreen:&nbsp; **<br /><br /><br />Power is on in Legends Field opener<br />03/01/2007 <br />By Bryan Hoch / MLB.com<br /><br />TAMPA, Fla. -- The heart of the Yankees&#039; lineup put on a power display in the first two innings of their Grapefruit League opener on Thursday, creating a good show for a packed house and providing a tantalizing preview of what may come. <br />Johnny Damon took Twins starter Carlos Silva deep on his second pitch, part of a three-run first inning, and Jason Giambi added a two-run shot in the second inning. Seven of the nine Yankees starters reached base in the first two frames, and the team couldn&#039;t help but boast about its assembled wealth of offense. <br /><br />&quot;We&#039;ve got guys up and down the lineup,&quot; Giambi said. &quot;It can&#039;t be much fun for an opposing pitcher to go, &#039;Who&#039;s my out?&#039;&quot; <br /><br />Wearing pinstripes in front of a Legends Field crowd of 10,231, Damon stepped into the box looking to smack a line drive. Instead, he turned on a low fastball and cracked it over the right-field wall, prompting jokes from the dugout about how his season could only go downhill from there. <br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s great,&quot; Damon said. &quot;The whole lineup, after me, you&#039;ve got to face all of these other guys. It&#039;s got to be scary for a pitcher coming in.&quot; <br /><br />Damon said he had packed on a few pounds of muscle over the winter -- in addition to a little extra body weight that he called a &quot;pooch&quot; (ostensibly, he meant a &quot;paunch&quot;) -- by working out at a gymnasium constructed within his Orlando-area home. <br /><br />&quot;I think building that gym was a big convenience,&quot; Damon said. &quot;During the offseason, you&#039;re supposed to just be resting, but unfortunately you&#039;re pulled in directions for great causes or whatnot. <br /><br />&quot;There&#039;s a lot to do, and when the season starts, you have your schedule that no one can mess with. That&#039;s what makes coming back and playing baseball a bit easier.&quot; <br /><br />An inning after working a walk, Giambi -- who reported no problems with his surgically repaired left wrist or his once-ailing left knee -- bashed his homer, creating a good indication for his year ahead. <br /><br />&quot;The wrist feels great,&quot; Giambi said. &quot;I worked hard at rehabbing it all offseason, and I feel good up there. I&#039;m taking pitches and seeing the ball. That&#039;s the most important thing for the first game.&quot; <br /><br /><br />The Yankees&#039; offensive display impressed just about everybody in the building, except perhaps the Twins and Silva, who allowed five runs and four hits in a beleaguered pair of innings. <br /><br />Even without such fireworks, Opening Day at Legends Field is always a touch above the rest of the Spring Training slate. <br /><br />A festive set of introductions was reminiscent of a true season opener, with past Yankees ranging from Yogi Berra to Reggie Jackson to Rich Monteleone doffing their caps and enjoying a warm bath of applause. The loudest ovation was reserved for a flyover of four F-15 jets dispatched from Pensacola, Fla. <br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s unbelievable,&quot; Giambi said. &quot;Yankees fans get excited about baseball, which they should. They talk about it all offseason -- the moves, they follow it -- and it&#039;s cool to be a part of it.&quot; <br /><br />The aura of the ceremonies are not lost on the newest Yankees; in fact, Giambi fondly recalled his first Tampa experience in 2003, when he claimed to be so impressed that he was actually nervous to take the field for fear of fumbling a ground ball. <br /><br />&quot;Unbelievable,&quot; Alex Rodriguez said. &quot;Sometimes you pinch yourself because we are so fortunate to play for this great organization. It&#039;s pretty amazing. You see it from guys who are here for the first time -- it&#039;s like a playoff game for them, you know?&quot; <br /><br />Then again, maybe the Yankees&#039; rookies shouldn&#039;t be surprised. Thursday&#039;s events culminated the nearly three weeks of workouts that lead up to the Grapefruit League schedule, a sometimes-mundane mix of live batting practice and bullpen drills. <br /><br />Even without nine innings of action, the Yankees still draw their fair share of spectators to Legends Field. Imagine the energy that takes over the building with actual game play. <br /><br />And, as Damon reminded half-kiddingly, there&#039;s plenty more to come. <br /><br /><strong>&quot;We only have 210 more games, so I&#039;m really looking forward to it,&quot; Damon said.</strong><br /><br />&nbsp;:mrgreen:

				And the Sox are getting spanked by the who?....&nbsp; the ROYALS??<br /><br />7-1 going into the 9th.<br /><br />OOOh, and Manny&#039;s sporting some stylish &quot;Preditor&quot; haircut.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wonder if Johnny Damon was still with them, if he&#039;d do any Geico commercials.
