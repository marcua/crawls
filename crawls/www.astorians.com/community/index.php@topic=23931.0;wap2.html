			I got this error message a few minutes ago: <br /><br /><br /><br />--- Quote ---An Error Has Occurred! Wrong value type sent to the database. Array of integers expected. (quoteids)<br />--- End quote ---<br /><br /><br />Can you please tell me what it means?<br /><br /><br />Also, a bunch of child boards seem to be gone, unless I&#039;m just blind. What happened?

			I&#039;m not sure about that error message you received so I&#039;ll let the admin look into that one.&nbsp; As far as the child boards go, if you click on the home page you should see them listed at the bottom of each lead section.&nbsp; So for example, under the heading &quot;Get Connected&quot; you should see the subcategories Admin/mod talk; Find ____ in Astoria/LIC; Community Groups, Activities, Events and underneath that it should read &quot;Child Boards: Sports, Community Supported Agriculture, OUT Astoria, Parenting &amp; Families....etc.&nbsp; Let me know if you are able to see them or which boards you think are missing.&nbsp; Sorry for the headache.

			Well, now I feel dumb - turns out I had at some point clicked the minus sign in the top right corner of the Get Connected section of the website! So yes, I really was blind! Thanks for the answer, AJ - you solved my problem in this area.

			No need to feel dumb.&nbsp; That minus sign is not the easiest thing to notice!<br /><br /><br />With regard to the error message you received, were you by any chance accessing the site from a smart phone at the time you got the message?
