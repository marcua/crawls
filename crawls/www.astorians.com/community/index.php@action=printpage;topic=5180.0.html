				I like my neighborhood, apartment building etc, so when the time rolls around, I&#39;d like to renew my lease for another year. My question is, who will I deal with? I live in an apartment building that&#39;s part of an entire block of buildings managed by Aris Crescent LLC. Will I actually talk to a specific person regarding lease renewal or will it be discussed with me through company forms via mail? I did initially use a broker through MQ realty who I never want to speak to again.

				You&#39;ll probably just get a form in the mail to sign. You can always call your management company if you want to talk to someone, though. The broker has nothing to do with it.<br /><br /><br />

				If you live in a rent stab blg, they are legally supposed to send you a renewal lease 60-90 days before your lease is up.&nbsp; If it&#39;s not rent stab, then it&#39;s up to the landlord when you will get one, if at all.&nbsp; If you&#39;re really concerned, just call the landlord or management company.&nbsp; The broker has nothing to do with your apartment now.

				Just out of curiosity, who was the broker that you never wanted to deal with again there? Just that they are looking for some stuff for me, and I&#39;m anxious not to have a bad experience.<br />Good luck with the renewal anyway.

				Hey,<br /><br />Good luck with renewal lease!&nbsp; If you really like your living situation and it is under some sort of rent control, you should check out the link to the NYC rental guidelines website below for more info!&nbsp; I didn&#39;t do my research and mistakenly believed that my landlord could only raise my rent by whatever the set percentage was.&nbsp; I was not aware of the Legal rent allowed section that appears at the top of a rent stablized lease.&nbsp; My landlord informed me after reaising my rent by almost $300 that he could charge the Legal Rent (it&#39;s not the market value) without making any major capital improvements!&nbsp; Apparently, there was some sort of amendment to the rental laws in 2003 that I was not aware of!&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.housingnyc.com/

				Yeah, I had read about that. My monthly preferential rent is 700 less than the &quot;legal regulated rent&quot;. The regulated rent seems like a ridiculous amount to pay for a one-bedroom in the area, and if the landlord raises my rent $700 then I will have to move. I am hoping for the best of circumstances.<br /><br />Henry of MQ realty was pushy, charged me a $300 application fee and initially told me rent was one thing, and upon signing, raised it $25. By pushy I mean he wanted the first, last and security AND his fee without giving me the lease to review. He wanted everything upfront without me being able to review the paper work for anything sketchy in the lease. He said all rent stabilized leases follow the same format, but it was the rider that I cared about because it had the regulated rent stated on there etc. He was so damn awful to work with. He would say things like &quot;there needs to be some kind of trust on your end...you&#39;re really dragging us along by not giving us all the money upfront.&quot; And I would want to say &quot;Well you lied to me about the rent and utilities, what was included in the lease and then wouldnt show me the lease until you had your 5,000+.&quot; But I didnt and I&#39;m glad because my apartment might have been given to someone else.<br /><br />If my rent is skyrocketed to the regulated rent, is it possible to appeal it since apartments in the complex are still starting and sometimes slightly below my current price? I see it on craigslist. Could I say I would like to move into a different apartment in the complex so I can still pay my original amount, or does it not work that way :P

				that sounds about right with MQ. Gary there did the same thing to us.<br />wanted CASH Wihtout being able to see a lease and put serious pressure on us.<br />we would have done it if we didn&#39;t realize the 2 other people in the office were all signing the same lease for the same apartment.<br />they are HORRIBLE.

				Fernando at MQ realty did EXACTLY the same thing with us.&nbsp; In fact, he wouldn&#39;t even tell us what the rent would be until he had his fee.&nbsp; He said, he wouldn&#39;t negotiate the rent with the LL until he knew we were &quot;serious&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp; why would anybody give them money before knowing what the rent would be?

				I know! Obviously people must because they wouldn&#39;t try it otherwise. I held my ground because I had looked through 30+ apartments in my price range and I knew I wanted the one Henry showed me. So for the week that it took to have my &quot;application&quot; approved and other junk to get settled, I REFUSED to give MQ any money without the necessary paperwork on their end. I got some threats that they were going to give the apt to someone else, but I didnt budge and they finally gave me the lease and voila! they got their damn money THAT day because everything seemed on the up and up with the agreement. And it&#39;s worked out fine with the management co. and the people in the apartment building. Everyone&#39;s nice, no one&#39;s particularly loud or obnoxious and I feel safe and cozy. I was really just curious if I was going to have a sit down with a person, like the landlord, or just simply get paperwork in the mail when the time comes for lease renewal. (and hopefully not a $700 monthly rent hike!)
