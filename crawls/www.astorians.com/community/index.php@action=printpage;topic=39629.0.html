				<br />I wonder what happened?&nbsp; I was never a fan of their very lackluster waitstaff/table service, but otherwise I really liked the ambiance here, and much of the food (their pancakes were THE best!).&nbsp; I sure hope (for the sake of the people who live in that part of Astoria) that another café goes in, since there&#039;s nothing else around there.

				<br />Pop Bar..I assume that&#039;s same space right next door that&#039;s changed a few times over the years?&nbsp; That spot doesn&#039;t seem to have much sticking power.<br /><br />Astoria Craft...not sure I know that.&nbsp; I recall there was a Mexican(?) restaurant bar on a corner heading towards 21st St., and think I remember seeing something else there now.&nbsp; Is that Astoria Craft?&nbsp; ..and assume by the name that it&#039;s a beer place?<br /><br />As for 60 Beans, I feel like many folks just aren&#039;t sure &#039;what&#039; to make of them now or what their future holds.&nbsp; I was so thrilled when they began offering dinner there, as the chef was phenomenally good imho, but for whatever reason they stopped the dinner thing a few months ago.&nbsp; Since they clearly have a kitchen, I figured they might try again to offer dinner (maybe with a new chef) or else try offering brunch.&nbsp; Last I&#039;d heard was that they were staying open &#039;somewhat late&#039; (til 700p or so) and continuing to offer beer/wine, but ....it seems to me that if you are going to do that, then why not stay open later?&nbsp; Offering beer/wine til just 700p seems half-hearted to me.&nbsp; Unless...they are staying open later than I realize?...and are they regularly also including live music?&nbsp; <br /><br />I would love a place in the nabe that&#039;s not a bar per se, but just a place to nurse a nice glass of wine and chill with music.&nbsp; I will say that last summer, Mussels and Sausages was good for that... they had some very nice live music...and at just my speed...nice and chill.&nbsp; ;-)<br /><br />I
