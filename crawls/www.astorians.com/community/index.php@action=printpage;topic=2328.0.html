				i actually liked the wings. I could go back and have a bucket ($13.95) of the 1 step up hot with a few ciders and be good to go. For the &quot;hotter&quot; peeps in the party, the wings didn&#39;t do it for them. But i really did like the flavor and the hotness. For me they were 1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8...9...10. There&#39;s always room for better! But the company was good and the crash course for beginner politics was greatly appreciated!

				as a Western New Yorker, I found the wings to be quite dissapointing.&nbsp; The &quot;medium&quot; ones had a little flaver, but no heat.&nbsp; The hotter wings had no flavor.&nbsp; And the wings themselves were kinda scrawny.&nbsp; I find McCann&#39;s to have much much better wings.

				Ah,&nbsp; &nbsp;I was thinking about trying to get into this until I saw the &quot;crash coarse on politics&quot; comment.<br /><br />I agree that McCann&#39;s wings do indeed rock tho haven&#39;t been as good since Edgar left for the Massapequa bar.<br /><br />Planet Wings suicide sauce is pretty good but I found the wings to be a little on the scrawny side.<br /><br />Sunswick wings are good, but not the full dozen you&#39;d expect and they have a nice bleu cheese.<br /><br />Never hit that place at the bottom (manh side) of the 59th St bridge that has the atomic wings... any good?<br /><br />Cassidy&#39;s Ale House (the old Stable Mates and/or Big Boys) used to have good wings but were really tiny the last 2 times I tried them.<br /><br />Wow....
