				Right on the corner of 35th Street and Ditmars. It used to be Les Moules, before that a Greek-inspired steakhouse, can&#039;t remember before that...<br /><br />But after seeing people in there with (I presume) the owner, the renovations have begun in earnest. A local restaurateur told me he once looked into that property before he opened his place and the terms the owner insisted upon just weren&#039;t feasible. (Something about giving him a generous percentage of the profits, signing to a multi-year lease, etc. No wonder previous places have had a hard time surviving.)<br /><br />Anyway, I dont know what&#039;s going to go there, except &quot;another restaurant&quot;... Has anyone heard anything? What would you like it to be? (madre de dios just not another sushi place!!!&nbsp; :wink: )

				Wow!&nbsp; I was wondering how long it would take - I had heard about the unattractive leasing terms as well.&nbsp; I noticed recently that the For Sale signs were down, and I had wondered if something might be in the works.&nbsp; Before Les Moules, it was two Greek restaurants (one of them was called Palladium - I think it was the first).&nbsp; Before that, it was Ditmars Video, with the Adult section down the stairs in the middle of the shop.<br /><br />I&#039;d love to see an Indian restaurant - there are no options at all, not even delivery, anywhere near Ditmars (if there is, let me know!).&nbsp; I don&#039;t think those few blocks could support another sushi restaurant.&nbsp;

				Glad to know they are doing something with that space.&nbsp; You&#039;d think it would be a great spot, but now that I understand the landlord has such expectations, it&#039;s no wonder things have gone under there.&nbsp; A good Indian restaurant would be so nice.&nbsp; I doubt sushi will go in.&nbsp; Maybe it will be a 30th Ave-style cafe?&nbsp; ;)

				I dont care whats there as long as one can sit at the bar without having dinner. Sure, 718 has a bar, but its more for killing time while waiting for a table. It is a huge space though, so I would imagine the rent is high. I&#039;ll tell you what the problem was with Les Moules....No matter how nice a place looks, if you have a salad bar in the middle of the restaurant, you might as well be a Denny&#039;s....Speaking of which, what about an Applebee&#039;s?<br /><br /><br />I kid............

				Yes, they need to get rid of that salad bar.&nbsp; A good Irish pub would be awesome, with food.&nbsp; McCann&#039;s and the Beer Garden are great, but too crowded.&nbsp; I like Sparrow, but I would love a regular Irish pub with food like McCann&#039;s.&nbsp; And decent prices, cool happy hours, and buy backs.&nbsp; Can&#039;t we have any new bars open up that don&#039;t charge standard 8-12 bucks a cocktail?&nbsp; I think Stini&#039;s has a good happy hour though.<br /><br />I&#039;ll take an Indian restaurant any day, although I doubt it would happen there.&nbsp;

				FWIW, I know that two partners had been looking into the place, one of whom was Indian, but the deal fell apart.<br /><br />Maybe it&#039;s been put back on the table because I&#039;ve seen two guys speaking to (I presume) the owner just before the renovations started, and one looks Indian.<br /><br />As for an Indian restaurant, I hope not. I l;ive very close to the place and I just can&#039;t stand the smell (or taste for that matter) of curry. And I&#039;ve tried to like Indian cuisine. My wife loves it. But it really turns me off.<br /><br />I&#039;d love to see a real Lebanese restaurant, not just a takeout falafel place. :mrgreen:

				They&#039;re really ripping the place up with tons of trashed sheetrock and other detritus piled up inside. And I saw a coupla guys moving (removing?) a sink from the smaller kitchen in the back. (There&#039;s a 2nd kitchen downstairs.)<br /><br />The bar and the table/chairs seem untouched.<br /><br />Part of me wants to ask someone there what&#039;s to come, but another part wants to be surprised, come what may...

				I was walking by the other day and a guy who was working on the place was outside. I asked him what kind of food the restaurant would serve and he said Italian. I sort of sighed and said &quot;oh, really? Well, good luck.&quot; I had my heard (stomach?) set on Indian.

				And Alba&#039;s has pretty decent home-style Italian (ie, not fancy).<br /><br />Forno&#039;s is the real deal (45th and Ditmars), and in between Alba&#039;s and Forno&#039;s in terms of quality/price/etc is Portobello in the 45th st. plaza.<br /><br />I would be PSYCHED if the place was more along the lines of the old 31 Restaurant.

				Yup, the whole side facing 35th St. has been replaced with garage-style doors (at least, that&#039;s what it looks like - don&#039;t know whether they open the same way).&nbsp; I assume more of the same is coming in the front.<br /><br />I heard a rumour it&#039;s going to be a Euro cafe.&nbsp; Anyone hear anything about this or anything beyond &quot;Mediterranean&quot;?

				As a 30th Avenue resident who often escapes to Ditmars for the lack of Euro-cafes, smoke, etc. <br />I hope it&#039;s not a Euro-cafe either. It&#039;s a nice space though so I hope it&#039;s either some cuisine that&#039;s not<br />well-represented in Astoria or something more continental that&#039;ll appeal to many palettes.

				We ate there tonight. It&#039;s called Oceano. It was a mildly negative experience. The menu is a mess. There are too many peculiar dishes that don&#039;t belong on the menu (e.g., pasta and cajun dishes), and not enough stand-out choices. Maybe they can sort things out in the coming months.<br /><br />According to the manager, the &quot;speciality&quot; is seafood. We ordered the seafood ceviche, salmon, and one of the chicken dishes. Each was priced between $15 and $20, and were among the less expensive items on the menu. None of the dishes were memorable, and each included the same side of slightly warmed-over carrots, celery, and zucchini. I couldn&#039;t wait to leave.<br /><br />I&#039;m perplexed. Why would one open an overpriced, mediocre seafood restaurant across the street from Kyclades? <br /><br /><br />

				The place on 20th and Steinway was most recently Da Nicola; my girlfriend and I ate there several times and always enjoyed it and the service was always very good.&nbsp; It was also very quiet - nice for us, bad for business.&nbsp; Before that, it was Strada Nova Trattoria; we enjoyed that also, but they didn&#039;t get enough business either.&nbsp; They are remodeling the place now (at a very fast pace), and I think it&#039;s going to be a Greek place from a notice I saw on the door.&nbsp; A new place is also going in on 45th and Ditmars where the short lived (unfortunately) Bon Vieux Temps closed; it&#039;s a small space (like 718), but I looked in the other day and it looks pretty nice so far.

				I&#039;ll try both, though I wish Oceano had their menus on display....<br /><br />And there isn&#039;t anything outside that said &quot;GRAND OPENING&quot; or somesuch.

Streamers and piñatas or whatever. Have a samba band jamming away.<br /><br />Make it a big, grand opening celebration of sorts instead of:<br /><br />hi. here&#039;s a restaurant. ok.<br /><br />:|

				The place is called Oceano.&nbsp; We tried it yesterday late in the afternoon.&nbsp; They had a few tables being served.&nbsp; We really liked this place a lot.&nbsp; We&#039;ll go back for sure.&nbsp; The softshell crab appetizer is amazing.&nbsp; They had a special fish soup special that was very delicious.&nbsp; I had the skirt steak entree with a special Latin sauce on the side.&nbsp; It was excellent.&nbsp; My wife had a similar entree that was also very delicious.&nbsp; Two big guys seated behind us had the hot shellfish combo special.&nbsp; It&#039;s a specialty of the house.&nbsp; A large variety of shellfish.&nbsp; Includes a lobster tail, scallops, king crab legs, etc.&nbsp; About $35 per person.&nbsp; They each received a serving platter sized dish.&nbsp; They were blown away and ate every bit.&nbsp; I hope this place makes it.&nbsp; The prices are very reasonable for what they serve.&nbsp; They also gave the tables a complementary mashed plantain appetizer that was very tasty.&nbsp; And they gave us a complementary creme brulee that was amazing.&nbsp; It&#039;s a great location and the staff couldn&#039;t be nicer.&nbsp; After the service fiasco at Mohave, this place shined. :mrgreen:

				My boyfriend and I recently ate at Oceano. I&#039;m going to suggest that anyone even slightly interested, try it. It seems like it might fill a niche in the neighborhood and here&#039;s why:<br /><br />I had the jalea appetizer; fried calamari, fried shrimp, fried yucca (a potato like vegetable) and a pickled onion and corn coulis. It was FANTASTIC and its obvious that they are very good at frying- each item retained its own flavor, the seasoning was fabulous and it was light. Honestly delicious. I just had the lobster bisque for my entree, and that was pretty standard. My boyfriend had a skirt steak and bean dish that needed a sauce-it was too dry- but there was a lot of flavor and we both decided that we would come back- many of the appetizers were very interesting sounding and I&#039;d go back in a heartbeat if I had a calamari craving, as I&#039;m known to have. <br /><br />So on a scale of 0-10, we gave it a 6, which is pretty solid. The service was sort of awful- we had maybe 4 waiters, and they arent very familiar with their menu and when delivering the skirt steak to my boyfriend, waiter #3 yelled &quot;HERE&#039;S YOUR COW! IT&#039;S DELICIOUS!&quot; <br /><br />Pretty standard pricing in my opinion, especially for the crab legs. They are heavy on the crab combos.<br /><br />I&#039;d go back if I was feeling casual and wanted fried seafood. The restaurant has garage-door style windows so it will probably be an outdoor cafe come summer, which might be nice. I&#039;m happy it&#039;s here as a decent option, although it wont make my top five restaurants in the area any time soon (of which mine are JJ&#039;s Fusion, Wave Thai, Bistro 33, Watawa and Fattys.)

				Thanks for the review. It seems like sub-par service is the norm around here...&nbsp; :|<br /><br />Still, we&#039;re looking forward to trying it soon.<br /><br />Request to admins: now that Oceano is up and running, I&#039;d like the name of this thread to be changed to &quot;Oceano Restaurant open for business&quot; or something. Seems more accurate especially since people are posting reviews.

				I ate there for the first time tonight.&nbsp; Service was a little slow but no complaints otherwise.&nbsp; I had the pulpo appetizer and it was excellent.&nbsp; Paella was very good as well, though not quite as good as at El Olivo (though I must qualify that by saying El Olivo&#039;s paella is exceptionally great).&nbsp; Was a little on the pricy side, but certainly not more than I&#039;m willing to spend on a Saturday night out.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be back again, if for no other reason than I haven&#039;t had good Ropa Vieja in far too long.
