				If Obama is trying to paint himself as anti-establishment, and not of the old-school breed of Washington politicians, why would he choose someone that is pretty much the consummate politician? Wikipedia says &quot;Biden has served for the sixth-longest period among current senators.&quot; If that&#039;s not establishment I don&#039;t know what is.<br /><br />Dear $diety I hope we don&#039;t get stuck with McCain for president. I don&#039;t like Obama that much (my horse in this race was Ron Paul) but if we get stuck with &quot;warfare-welfare&quot; Mc-Attach-Iran-Cain we&#039;re royally hosed.

They claim that they knew about the daughter&#039;s pregnancy prior to picking her as a VP and about the other problematic portions of Palin&#039;s time in Alaskan gov&#039;t, but chose her anyway. It seems like a big mistake and it gives the message, in my opinion, that McCain is showing how he does not currently possess the ability to make the kinds of decisions a Commander in Chief must make. Regardless of his positions, if he cannot make good decisions to enact that changes in the country that he is striving for, he is not a strong candidate.<br /><br />I actually think that the biggest electoral effect will be that the groups typically observed as the &quot;liberal elite&quot; will mock and joke over the situation which may serve to further alienate the rural swing voters who tend to shy away from what is viewed as liberal superiority.

				Actually...Palin&#039;s pregnant daughter has a lot to do with the campaign. It goes to show the type of family values she has, which is big with the country.&nbsp; What does it say that she can&#039;t educate her own daughter enough about sex and contraception.&nbsp; How can she preach it to the country?&nbsp; <br />I don&#039;t have a problem with a woman being a VP or President, but this was a poor choice.&nbsp; She has been governor for only 2 years and before that a mayor of a town of 90000 people.&nbsp; She has no foreign relations experience.&nbsp; Really...how does she qualify for the position?&nbsp; I was on the fence with Obama and I thought it would be a very close race.&nbsp; Now, I think Obama has it locked up.&nbsp;

				It&#039;s so disappointing that McCain chose to favor the religious right over the moderate/independent vote in his VP choice. The more I hear about this and see how various people are responding, the more I am convinced he knew all along this would win Palin over in the eyes of evangelicals, even though it&#039;s &quot;not a political issue.&quot; I&#039;ve thought, as long as this campaign has been going on, that if Obama comes across as a bit too full of empty promises I&#039;ll either vote for McCain or some third party candidate who won&#039;t win anyway. Now that his message is so clear, there&#039;s no way I&#039;m voting for that ticket. I&#039;m sure McCain wouldn&#039;t give a crap about losing my vote since New York is so strongly democratic anyway, but that&#039;s sad to me, and I&#039;m really afraid of having 4-8 more years of religious right in the White House. I&#039;ve never been one to buy into Obama&#039;s rhetoric, but now McCain really is looking to me like more of the same. He can play Palin up as some sort of maverick as much as he wants to, but all she is is an underqualified ploy to win over the religious right and a sad attempt to woo some Hillary supporters. McCain&#039;s campaign is a joke.<br /><br />JavaJay, she was the mayor of a town of less than 9000 people, not 90000 thousand. That might&#039;ve been a typo, so just clarifying.

On the positive for McCain, he has beaten his personal best in fundraising over the past five days (still not making Obama money). He was distrusted by more than one conservative base and that seems to be solved for now. He took the focus off of the Democrats convention (with some help from Gustav). Plus yesterday the Dems number 1 was comparing his experience with the Reps number 2. That&#039;s a bad idea.<br /><br />The obvious risk is that if she truly falters out of the starting block, there will be no getting up. Tonight&#039;s speech will be the first test, but she could also get creamed in the Oct 3 VP debate. <br /><br />The Obama campaign is overall playing this pretty well, but I still believe that if he had chosen a better VP, Sarah Palin would be on the sidelines, and McCain would have been forced to go with a bore like Pawlenty.
