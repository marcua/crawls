				My daughter lost her apartment due to fire and is staying with friends while looking for another apartment. &nbsp;I am keeping her two cats. &nbsp;The problem is that we already have 3 cats -- in a one bedroom apartment. &nbsp;<em>Her</em> cats are adorable, affectionate and playful But the male cat doesn't get along with my two males [that's putting it mildly :)]. &nbsp;As a result, I have to keep my daughter's two cats locked up in the living room and me, my partner &amp; our three cats are crowded into the bedroom/kitchen/bath. &nbsp;Whenever I have to go in to feed daughter's two cats, chaos insues! (is that spelled right?) &nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway, if you or anyone you know would like to keep these two cats until my daughter gets an apartment -- anytime between this week and say six months -- most likely in the next few months -- I can pay $15 a week for food, litter and such. &nbsp;And of course, if it didn't work out for some reason, I would take them back. &nbsp;I am returning to school and am spending more time working at home so I need more space &amp; order!<br /><br />If you know of anyone or any solution, give me a call at 718-728-8951 or post to me here.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Renee
