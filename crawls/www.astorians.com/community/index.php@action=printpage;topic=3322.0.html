				Okay this may sound strange, but I&#39;ve just been reading a really interesting website that talks about lucid dreaming (http://www.dreamviews.com/). It&#39;s basically when you train yourself to become &quot;aware&quot; during your dreams, remember them, and then try and interact with them. It sounds really cool!<br /><br />I&#39;m wondering if anyone has ever done this before, had a dream where they became aware that they were dreaming and interacted with their dream. After reading the instructions on that website I think I&#39;m going to try their suggestions. One really interesting concept is &quot;dream spinning&quot;, where if you are having a dream you want to change you just &quot;spin&quot; and when you stop spinning the scenery has usually changed. There are tons of other interesting tips there.<br /><br />I think I&#39;m going to try and keep a journal in an attempt to become aware of what I dream. Anyone have any dream experiences to share?

				I remember seeing a &quot;Lucid Dreaming Device&quot; in those cheesy catalogs you get in the mail (I can&#39;t remember what it was called). It looked like a blinder you&#39;d wear at night to keep light out, and it was advertised that it would shine a red LED at your eyelids during your REM sleep phase. It would wake you up just enough to realize you were dreaming, thereby allowing you to control your dreams.<br /><br />As a kid I thought that was the coolest thing I&#39;d ever heard of. I think the company went broke, though - it didn&#39;t really work as advertised.

				<em>edit after I typed this all out: Gah, I&#39;ve obviously spent too much time thinking about this...</em><br /><br />I used to do this when I was a teenager, maybe 14 or 15. It was probably because I was always reading about it, and my friends were way into astrology and whatnot (not that they&#39;re the same things, but they were in the same section at the bookstore :) ) I used to be so good at it that if I wanted to interact with a specific person in my dream, I&#39;d say to myself something like &quot;Johnny Depp will walk through that door now, and we&#39;re gonna be at 6 Flags and go on roller coasters&quot; and there he&#39;d be. But honestly, for me, the absolute best thing to do lucid dreaming is to fly.<br /><br />I don&#39;t remember exactly how I trained myself to do it. Tthe fact that I read about it a lot and talked to my friends about it probably had a lot to do with it, because for me, a lot of my everyday life gets filtered into my dreams so at some point during my dream, I&#39;d become aware that I was dreaming. One technique I remember was to ask yourself whenever you remember, &quot;am I dreaming?&quot; and then to test yourself. If you&#39;re dreaming, you may be able to force strange things to happen just by &quot;willing&quot; them to happen. (A specific thing I remember was to try to make the time on a clock change...if you look at it and it says 10:00, look away and &quot;force&quot; it to be something else when you look back.) However, I did get to one point when I did this back in the day where I would ask myself if I was dreaming, and since my answer when awake was always automatically, &quot;no, I&#39;m awake,&quot; it became my answer in my dream.<br /><br />You know how in dreams, completely bizarre things seem totally normal? I think the key to lucid dreaming is REALLY thinking about what&#39;s going on around you, and when you realize that something strange isn&#39;t normal, you&#39;ll realize that you&#39;re dreaming.<br /><br />Despite the fact that I&#39;ve become lucid in my dreams a few times in the past couple years, I&#39;ve never been able to take advantage of it - I usually start thinking something like &quot;AWESOME! Now I&#39;m gonna go fly and do this and that and hang out with this person, and its going to rule...&quot; and I get so excited that I wake myself up.

				Lucid dreaming is something academically reported and still being studied, actually. <br />Specific to what you&#39;re talking about, Merm, a recent study in the Peer Reviewed Journal &quot;Dreaming&quot; reviewed techniques for inducing lucid dreams. The study is small, only 20 participants, so they admit the limitations of the study straight of the bat but according to the abstract, the researchers found that the reflection-intention technique (using a journal) was to some degree effective. researchers again note that the study sample size was small and it would have to be repeated in similar conditions repeatedly until a large enough sample size was attained before any conclusions could be reached...<br /><br />here&#39;s the reference (from PsychInfo, which I am thankful to still have access to as an academic nerd):<br />Paulsson, Timo; Parker, Adrian. The Effects of a Two-Week Reflection-Intention Training Program on Lucid Dream Recall. [References]. [Journal; Peer Reviewed Journal] Dreaming. Vol 16(1) Mar 2006, 22-35.

				I can sort of do this, but it was easier when I was younger.&nbsp; When I realize I&#39;m dreaming I sort of scramble to stay asleep and it becomes hard to keep a whole environment together--sometimes I wake up and sometimes I just dream that I wake up.&nbsp; Sometimes it works well, usually during a vivid dream that I can&#39;t really control--it&#39;s more like I know I can do whatever I want because it&#39;s just a dream but I can&#39;t control what&#39;s around me.<br /><br />I never really fly in dreams but I do jump really high and stay in the air for a long time (I&#39;m always like &quot;Hey, check it out!&quot; but no one cares, haha).&nbsp; And, uh, let&#39;s just say that Johnny Depp and I aren&#39;t going on roller coasters.&nbsp; :evil:

				Last night I actually told myself as I was falling to sleep that I would wake up and write down my dreams after they happened. I had placed a pen and pad right next to the bed on my nightstand. I did indeed wake up and write down 8 separate dreams, and there were an additional 4 dreams that I woke up but was too lazy to write down. I had no idea I dreamed so much. Looking back on my notes it&#39;s kinda funny because I don&#39;t remember some of this stuff. Here&#39;s what I wrote down, some I remember, some I don&#39;t. On most I just wrote a one liner and went back to sleep evidently.<br /><br />1. Praying in a Home Depot store (I don&#39;t remember this dream at all)<br />2. Going to Walmart and discovering when I was inside the store I had to hold my breath. (Don&#39;t remember it. But scribbled on my paper nonetheless.)<br />3. Sitting on a committee discussing the various logs running on this server. We were arguing over the logs. (I barely remember this one)<br />4. I had forgotten the SMTP &quot;address&quot; for my mail server and so I had to go and meet with my mom and dad and wife to get them to tell me what the SMTP address was for the server. (Don&#39;t remember this)<br /><br />Next I had a longer dream that I do remember better (after looking at my notes)<br /><br />5. I decided that something had to be done to let Bush know that the war in Iraq was a big mistake. So I just traveled back in time to let him know. Somehow I got a meeting with him and I was trying to convince him that I really was from the future and that if he went to war in Iraq that it would be really bad for our country. After I was convinced he finally heard me I went into a nearby church and started whispering to everyone in the pews the same thing.<br /><br />The next thing I knew I was on some bridge and I came across a kid sitting there who I recognized as the inventor of some really popular open-source piece of software. He was all depressed sitting there, so I told him that he shouldn&#39;t give up because he was going to be famous one day and that his work would have a good impact on the world. I still don&#39;t remember what software he was supposed to develop.<br /><br />6. Next I dreamed that after the dream I told you above that I woke up and discovered my night stand and lamp was all broken to pieces and the pen I was trying to write the dream down on wasn&#39;t working. So I stood up out of bed and stepped on some glass. Then I thought I heard someone in my house. This dream was quickly becoming a nightmare so I woke up for real and wrote down this dream, and number 5.<br /><br />7. Next I dreamed that my mom called me (from the past) and told me that she was having a hard time watching me (as a baby) and that she needed me to come and babysit myself. So I traveled through time (again, which didn&#39;t seem like any big deal) and I babysat myself for an afternoon. I remember thinking what a smart baby I was because I (as a baby) was talking and I couldn&#39;t even walk yet. I tried to think of what advice I could give myself, but I don&#39;t remember if I did give myself any advice.<br /><br />8. I&#39;m in some kind of big compound where there&#39;s all these buildings and some kind of communal dwelling. Lots of people living there, sleeping etc. And I go outside and there&#39;s all these guards with machine guns and they are looking for bombs. But outside there&#39;s an airshow going on with all these stunt pilots doing really crazy maneuvers. Like cutting the grass with their propellers and stuff. I get the sense that a bomb is going to go off in the building imminently, and then I wake up.<br /><br />9. I then have notes that say &quot;false awake&quot;. I&#39;m guessing that I was dreaming that I was waking up, but not really awake.<br /><br />I wasn&#39;t lucid in any of my dreams though last night. I totally thought everything was normal, even time traveling. I&#39;m going to do it again tonight and see what I dream. It&#39;s strange to me that I&#39;m dreaming about Walmart, Home Depot, and churches so much. I seldom go to any of them.

				Oh BTW, using a notepad to record your dreams as they happen is the first step in learning to lucid dream regularly according to that website I linked to in my first post there. So that&#39;s why I got the idea to try it. :)<br /><br />Another interesting thing I was thinking about is the fact that near the end of the sleep phase is when you get the longer, deeper dreams. That&#39;s what happened to me too. It wasn&#39;t until &quot;late&quot; in the morning (like 4am) after I had been sleeping for a while that I started to have the more vivid and longer dreams that I now remember better after looking at my notes. It&#39;s strange seeing the scribbles you wrote in the dark though the next morning and not remembering some of it.

				MERM! You have to watch Waking life.. It came out a few years ago. It&#39;s one of those rotoscope movies that looks like &quot;Scanner Darkly&quot;. Anyway, it get&#39;s pretty philosophical but it&#39;s completly about lucid dreaming. <br /><br />I used to be able to do it when I was younger. Now with a kid, I sleep so hard when I get any chance that I don&#39;t remember dreaming.

				I usually don&#39;t remember my dreams either, but having a notepad by my bed really helps. I recorded about 5 dreams last night, it&#39;s really interesting. No time travel or churches last night. But still no lucid dreaming.

				Actually - this is silly, but I wonder what would happen if you attempted suicide in a lucid dream.<br /><br />unrelated, feel free to not read the rest of this post:<br /><br />last night i dreamed/dreamt? that i was in rural Georgia with my best friend from 6-7 years ago, who i&#39;ve since severed ties with, and haven&#39;t seen in a very long time.<br /><br />he had these fireworks of sorts - some sort of pyrotechnics that seemingly cost a fortune.&nbsp; we were in a very wooded area in the distant outskirts of the greater Atlanta area I think.&nbsp; you didn&#39;t have to light these things he had - just throw them, these small blue squares -- maybe the size of ice cubes -- and the chemical reaction was enough to cause huge blasts, but they were slightly delayed.&nbsp; fire wasn&#39;t exactly produced, but the shrapnel involved was sort of like liquid metal (well, liquid plastic, so hot that it wouldn&#39;t reform into solid plastic anytime soon).&nbsp; the things were so tiny and sporatic, it was ridiculously dangerous.<br /><br />I say to him, &quot;that stuff must have cost a lot of money, man!&quot;<br />He says, &quot;yeah.&quot;<br />Me, &quot;In the thousands?&quot;<br />Him, &quot;Three hundred forty thousand.&quot;

				Lucid dreaming is just being aware that you are dreaming. So you can choose to either go with the flow of the dream (which a lot of people do) or you can try and control the dream. People who master it say that it&#39;s a good way to stop nightmares or to do fun things they can&#39;t do in real life. That site I linked at the top of the thread has lots of really good information on getting started. I&#39;ve been journaling my dreams for 4 nights now, but still haven&#39;t gone lucid yet. Lucid dreaming just means you&#39;re aware enough to make a choice as to whether you want to follow or lead the dream.

				So I&#39;ve been keeping a log off and on of my dreaming over the last few days (since I started this post). I dream some very strange stuff. Like about philosophers, and running through caves with gnomes chasing me, and RV&#39;ing, and being on cruises that go underwater, and visiting my old houses. Anyway, lots of strange stuff. One of the most interesting was when I woke myself up and wrote down an &quot;Epiphany&quot; I had about &quot;Super Grover&quot;.<br /><br />Well, the last two nights I&#39;ve actually remembered to lucid dream! It was almost right before I woke up in the morning though so they didn&#39;t last very long at all. Both times I realized I was dreaming and when I tried to change things I couldn&#39;t so I just would &quot;spin&quot; and it worked. I was able to change my surroundings a little bit.<br /><br />I&#39;m actually looking forward to going to sleep tonight with the hope I can pull off another lucid dream. Maybe I&#39;ll dream that astorians.com gets 100,000 users...

				Well, I tried to lucid dream last night but every time I fell to sleep I&#39;d forget and think it was all real. So I just went along with it all last night and missed out on the ability to jump off cliffs or fly around the room. Oh well...

				anyone see the trailers for &quot;The Science of Sleep&quot;... maybe this would count for lucid dreaming as the character enjoys staying in his dreams.... i&#39;m going to see it... mainly b/c Gael Garcia Bernal is my boyfriend, but you know... might be good to learn a little about lucid dreaming. :) well at least it might be inspiring.

				I just came back from watching &quot;The Science of Sleep&quot; and I think it was probably the best film I&#39;ve seen all year.&nbsp; Highly recommended for anyone interested in lucid dreaming, Gael Garcia Bernal, or escaping to another world for 2 hours or so!&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				I&#39;ve been able to successfully lucid dream a few times in the last couple weeks. One time I was able to&nbsp; stay in the dream for quite a while and realize I was awake. The problem that I&#39;m having is that when I realize I&#39;m lucid I get too excited and wake myself up before I can jump off any tall buildings or take a trip to the center of the galaxy.<br /><br />So far it only seems to happen in the morning right before I wake up. I want to figure out how to get it to happen earlier in the night too.

				i think i just lucid dreamed right now... kind of excited about it.... hopefully this counts...<br /><br />first of all, i woke up about 4am, achy, nervous, i hafta go to court this morning and get there on time. i sat up for a bit on the internet, etc. then i went to sleep... i was having an odd dream about being in a case review with my supervisor that went totally wrong. i decided to leave and go back to my &#39;home&#39;. that journey was odd, my friend and her girlfriend picked me up in a car driving around in crazy traffic with people who were driving trucks with the front that looks like a cartoon character....almost like disney or something, they stop by a starbucks, i walk past it and go to my home... in my dream this was a familiar place, but when i think about it now, i&#39;ve never been there, even tho it felt like a town i lived in when i was little.&nbsp; <br /><br />here&#39;s the odd part.... my alarm goes off, i sleepily hit snooze. i fall back asleep, and i&#39;m back in that house. it kinda turns scary as there are random men coming into my bathroom, washing their hands, and trying to flirt with me. i kick them out, and try to lock the door. for some reason i decide to leave the home (maybe i didnt feel safe) and walked down a dirt road to a starbucks. (what? i hate starbucks. anytime i step into a starbucks is to take a piss when i need to), and the starbucks is playing music from one of my favorite bands. but it&#39;s not the most recent album. it sounds like their first, but it&#39;s a little off and fuzzy. and i&#39;m walking around the creepy starbucks, and the band is actually there and they recognize me! (i have met and hung out with them before early in their career) so they all greet me, they get their coffees, and we go back to my &#39;house&#39; and that music from the starbucks is still playing in the house.&nbsp; then they say they are going to jam out in the woods.... i know what they are going to do, they are going to &#39;smoke&#39;. but i really wanted to hear them play that old music, i walk out the house and walk down the dirt road, talking to my favorite guy in the band....<br /><br />the alarm goes off again! i remember hitting snooze, <br /><br />and going back to where i was in the dream. i&#39;m still walking down the dirt road, and the guys in the band are talking about what they were thinking of playing, how great it&#39;s going to be, and that it&#39;s going to be a great day. the whole time i&#39;m thinking in my head.... i need to go to court! so i continue talking to him and tell him that i really love the band and i&#39;d really like to hang with them. but i need to go. the guy looks at me, takes his hands in mine and says &#39;well, it was great seeing you, i hope to see you again.&#39; looking kinda sad. i nod my head, smile, and turn away.<br /><br />i woke myself up. got out of bed, started making breakfast, and writing this.&nbsp; <br /><br />some comments-- again! my most vivid dreams i remember when something like this happens, when i wake up, fall asleep again, and it&#39;s a short period of time before i have to wake up.&nbsp; <br /><br />when i was on the internet, i was listening to the band&#39;s webpage, which ONLY has their newer stuff. the music in the dream was amazing. darn! <br /><br />i seriously felt as though that house was familiar, but, i can&#39;t place it. i must have been in that house in a previous dream.&nbsp; <br /><br />i&#39;ve never hung out with that band in that fashion. i&#39;ve sat with them before and after shows. i sat and hung with them almost a whole day when they were playing a show at our university, i was &#39;hospitality&#39; and got them whatever they needed. but they seemed pretty cool and didnt want much. so i sat and chatted w/ them the whole day.&nbsp;

				The question is, were you aware that you were dreaming while you were in the dream itself? I think that&#39;s what a lucid dream is, not just vivid, but where you actually control it and yourself because you are fully aware that you are dreaming and can do anything you want.
