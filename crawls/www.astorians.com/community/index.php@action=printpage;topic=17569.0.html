				It seems like they are actually trying to run a successful business, which is refreshing for that location. I ordered a white pizza and some penne vodka a few weeks ago, and it was very good. Have heard from others that have had positive reviews as well.

				The wife and I ordered 2 of the cold Italian hero and fried Zucchini appitiezer, the hero&#039;s were the best cold hero&#039;s i have had in a long time plenty of meat roasted red peppers, the&nbsp; lettuce was nice and crisp and tomato was very fresh, the marinara sauce was also fresh and the fried Zucchini was cooked perfectly Delivery time was a little long but the food was worth the wait. Will order from them again :-) :-)

				The pizza was fine but nothing special really.&nbsp; Delivery took nearly an hour and we live practically right behind the place.<br /><br />The white pizza was very very good, and the crust seemed better than on the regular pie.&nbsp; Not sure if they make them differently or what.<br /><br />

				I think the DOH shut this place down...they had signs up a day or two ago about how they&#039;d be closed for a day, and then the dread &quot;CLOSED by DOH&quot; signs a day later. I notice they never had their sanitation score displayed which certainly make me want to eat there.

				Well, I took a look yesterday and the DOH had put up 3-4 signs on the outside...which were then covered by other signs from Giorgio&#039;s. I&#039;ve seen this done at other places, seems pretty shady to me.

				Personally, I&#039;m getting sick of all this grading and violations and shutdowns.&nbsp; It&#039;s gone way over the top IMO.&nbsp; Frankly, do I think any restaurant keeps a kitchen as clean as I keep my own?&nbsp; Of course not.&nbsp; But I&#039;m too busy to make home cooked meals much of the time.&nbsp; And I&#039;m learning to become less neurotic about many things - like all these restaurant horror stories.&nbsp; We called Georgio&#039;s last night.&nbsp; They delivered an incredibly delicious meal.&nbsp; See if you can find better baked clams than theirs.&nbsp; Of course, they&#039;re still a little tough to deal with by phone.&nbsp; &nbsp;And the delivery takes forever.&nbsp; And the location - and atmosphere - is not so great to eat in.&nbsp; But their food is really remarkable.&nbsp; I hope all this stuff is sorted and they can just keep up the great cooking.
