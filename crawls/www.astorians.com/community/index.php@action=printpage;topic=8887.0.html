				I came to this board cause I am a virtualy life-long Astoria resident. I figured I&#039;d give the &#039;Politics&#039; board a look and that the debate here would be robust, but, at least in the realm of reality. Sadly, I see the usual crackpot theories and nutty websites that are par for the course on the web channeled here too. Still, as someone who came to this country from Europe, and whose relatives were butchered by both Nazis and Commies, I can attest to extremism when I see it. One such extremism is the hatred and sheer lunancy that has gripped many folks against the President. It is not based on reality anymore. The removal of Saddam and the Taliban were not only a needed move, but, it opened a region closed to the outside and bought the fight and current attack of Islamic extremists to their home, after they bought it to ours for decades culminating in 9/11. You may not agree, and I don&#039;t, with some of the early military decsions, but, given the military available after the draconian cuts during the 1990&#039;s, the USA had to act fast after 9/11. The newly discovered &#039;concern&#039; for &#039;human rights&#039;, by those who supported Castro for decades, on what is happeing on Gitmo, Cuba is bad enough, but, to say the Patriot Act and some other MODEST measures, compared to what FDR did in WW 2, makes Bush a &#039;dictator&#039; is ludicrous on the surface. Only slip and fall attorneys and the legal establishment who want to treat this as a &#039;crime&#039; problem could possibly believe it. <br /><br />We live in a world of REAL dictatorships. China, who is flooding our markets for at least 15 years with cheap goods, often dangerous, are builidng up their tech and communist Armed forces. Chavez in Venezuela, Hollywoods buddy after Castro, who has suspended and rewrote the entire constitution and is trying to be President for life, cozying up to Irans leader a holocaust denier who wants Nukes, and was onlt &#039;stopped. albeit temporarily by the&nbsp; removal of Saddam in 2003. We are told the world &#039;hates&#039; us cause of GW. The REALITY is that in Europe, Germany, France, the two heads of the so-called &#039;Anti-War&#039; movement recently elected decidedly Pro-War and Pro-USA leaders. Anyone can now see that the war is turning the tide and the extremists are on the run. The only ones who refuse to see this are people who are tired of war, understandable, and unrepetent Anti-Semites like Pat Buchanan, who have teamed up in an &#039;unholy&#039; alliance of assorted America haters, righties and lefties. In the end, we have no choice, but, to fight this war. Retreat is surrender. My nephew is in Iraq, and I want him home NOW, but, when I send him articles of what is being written and shown from Hollywood/media about his and his fellow soldiers efforts, he is angry and disgusted and tells me how it bears little to reality. Yes, there have been lies in this war, from the media, like the Museum &#039;looting&#039; story early on, and how the whole war was based WMD&#039;s in Iraq, and not the 17 resolutions Saddam violated. How the incidents in Abu Ghraib were the norm and not the exception, and finally a slap in the face of tens of millions of Americans who elected Bush TWICE and the media cast doubt and disparaged it. The President did the right thing, and I believe history will prove it. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

				With regardss to war, I am not a pacifist at all.&nbsp; For me, war is strictly a cost/benefit analysis:&nbsp; Will the engagement of war result in the best possible outcome for a nation given the circumstances?&nbsp; Will the benefits of global positioning and access to natural resources outweight the cost of dollars, life, global goodwill and blowback?&nbsp; If the answer is yes, I support war.&nbsp; If not, I am against it.&nbsp; Keep in mind, even if it is beneficial, the CBA of diplomacy, as well as United Nations actions must be entered into calculations, as if they are more beneficial than war, then I am against war.&nbsp; <br /><br />As it stands now, I see the balance of this war decidely in the red.<br /><br />Just as you seem to be a realist in this matter, not giving over to emotion, neither am I.&nbsp; Human right violations on the part of Saddam play no part in my calculations, given that we are active allies with dictatorships who have engaged in human rights violations.<br /><br />I am open to change my mind should I be shown in a logical manner that this war is beneficial to this country.&nbsp; I can appreciate your opening post as a way to bring up the subject matter, but it is not logical nor compelling.&nbsp; So, as Agent Kujan said to Verbal Kint, &quot;Convince me&quot;. <br /><br />

				FZ, I think that your comments are in poor taste, misguided and unfortunately only choosing to see one side of the whole story.&nbsp; Your opinions are as close minded as the people you accuse of crack pot theories.&nbsp; <br /><br />It would be easier to accept your comments if you did not start off so offensively.&nbsp; Actually it sounds more like a diatribe then the beginnings of a mutual conversation.&nbsp; Perhaps you could try again.<br /><br />As for your nephew, well we can all only wish him our best and good luck to him.&nbsp; He and his fellow troops are the only ones who deserve our respect and support.&nbsp;

				How are &quot;hollywood types&quot; any less grounded in reality than the Bush administration?&nbsp; Last time I checked, GWB came from more privilege than most Hollywood actors and never really had to work a day in his life and made it to where he was based on his family name.<br /><br />And how is their reality any less important than yours or mine?&nbsp; Personal experience is a relative thing.&nbsp; And let&#039;s not forget that Ron Reagan and Fred Thompson are both Hollywood types, and look where they were/are on the political spectrum, and they are the hollywood types that actually ran for office!<br /><br />FZ, your ability to see things in pure good/evil is something.&nbsp; Not everything is cut and dry.&nbsp; Your experience is based on the life you&#039;ve led in this country with whatever news source you choose to trust.&nbsp; Those other &quot;nutjobs&quot; in other countries view you as just as much of a nut job.&nbsp; So why are you right and they are wrong?&nbsp; Experience and perspective is everything.&nbsp; The ability to see things through other people&#039;s eyes is important to open a dialogue and avoid armed confrontations.<br /><br />Lastly, Iran is in a significantly stronger position as a direct result of the destabilizing effects of the US initiated military action in Iraq.&nbsp; If we didn&#039;t go into Iraq, Iran still has to worry about Saddam, and still has to be cautious of the US.&nbsp; But now that our military is stretched to the brink, and they don&#039;t have to worry about Saddam, that whole area is easily manipulated by Iran and Ahmedinejad.<br /><br />And now with the recent NIE about Iran giving up it&#039;s newcyuhler (hey, I&#039;m an American, and if my president says it this way, so will I) weapons program, the president STILL invoked WWIII for no other reason to scare the pants off of people.<br /><br />I just get the sense that FZ is more motivated by fear than anything else, and I think it&#039;s unfortunate.<br /><br />I just wish this country would spend even a fraction of what it spends on wars and nation building on its own people and actually provide things like healthcare to our own citizens.<br /><br />All I see out of this war is $ going into the hands of the people this administration is closely associated with and the bankroll Cheney, Bush and Co. stand to make in another year when they are private citizens again and rejoin these very companies.

You can&#039;t be&nbsp; a&nbsp; &#039;part-time, peace activist.&#039; The UN had entered&nbsp; into&nbsp; the calculations&nbsp; of Saddam&nbsp; Hussein, it&#039;s why were&nbsp; there in first&nbsp; place, the Kuwait&nbsp; invasion and&nbsp; the no fly zone for 12 years. Saddam repeatedly called&nbsp; the &#039;bluff&#039;&nbsp; of the UN and the USA&nbsp; and lost. It was a culmination and&nbsp; fullfillment of the cease fire provision, the first Gulf War never ended. <br /><br />Human rights violations&nbsp; don&#039;t enter&nbsp; in the so-called&nbsp; &#039;Anti-War&#039; side, since they&nbsp; go around&nbsp; carrying pictures of Chairman Mao, and T-shirts&nbsp; of&nbsp; Che&#039;.&nbsp; The fact of the matter&nbsp; you deal with the cards you are dealt, until you can change the dealer. Problem is&nbsp; in that part of the world, with no tradition&nbsp; of any pluralism, only such a&nbsp; move of removal will ever bring any positive&nbsp; change. I agree it looked bad, but, you don&#039;t change&nbsp; place with thousands&nbsp; of years of history overnight, or a few years. <br /><br />I&#039;m not&nbsp; trying to convince&nbsp; anyone that this war,&nbsp; or any war is &#039;beneficial&#039;, but, a neccessity. I don&#039;t want to have the operation doctor to remove&nbsp; the tumor, but, the body will die. You&nbsp; weigh your options, it&#039;s&nbsp; not&nbsp; a&nbsp; world run under the best of&nbsp; choices.

But, all this doesn&#039;t matter, the mantra&nbsp; of Haliburton,&nbsp; a company used for decades&nbsp; supporting the troops, as some sinster&nbsp; corpration that just suddenly appeared run by Cheney&nbsp; is ridiculous and wrong.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know&nbsp; how many &#039;corrupt&#039; officials&nbsp; have left, but, they have left. Yes, the constant baseless accusations by the Left and attacks using the Press is very Soviet, thanks for pointing it out. I mean you are bound to get&nbsp; someone if you keep accusing.<br /><br />Diminishing separation of Church and State?&nbsp; You mean the state diminishing the Church, only if it&#039;s&nbsp; &#039;Christian.&#039; Anything else&nbsp; is AOK, it&#039;s&nbsp; &#039;diversity&#039; and if you complain you will be branded&nbsp; a fascist and a racist.&nbsp; The Press&nbsp; has become&nbsp; very Soviet, no doubt about it.<br /><br />The Press in the so-called&nbsp; &#039;Free&#039; West is&nbsp; a horror. It&#039;s run by so-called &#039;idependent&#039; Journalists&nbsp; from cookie-cutter leftist&nbsp; indoctrinated&nbsp; Univerisities. The few that slip through are denounced&nbsp; as Fascists and Warmongers, like FOX&nbsp; news, which is hardly&nbsp; &#039;right-wing.&#039; You can deny and throw out as many accusations as you want, but, there are tens of millions&nbsp; like me seething below&nbsp; the surface&nbsp; at the control of our&nbsp; culture and destruction of our&nbsp; traditions by a&nbsp; relatively small &#039;mob&#039; in the Northeastern states&nbsp; and LA.

Let&#039;s&nbsp; not get started on nepotism and Hollywood, and how they keep turning out&nbsp; movies&nbsp; that no one&nbsp; goes to about this war&nbsp; cause&nbsp; tinsel town wants&nbsp; to show&nbsp; how &#039;commited&#039; they are&nbsp; by showing us how &#039;we&#039;&nbsp; are wrong. They make billions&nbsp; in Hollywood&nbsp; really doing nothing, glorified&nbsp; court jesters who at one time&nbsp; did at least&nbsp; care about the nation they live in and didn&#039;t&nbsp; fly around the world&nbsp; hugging it&#039;s enemies. Let&#039;s&nbsp; not go further on the arts&nbsp; and media&nbsp; class because&nbsp; they house&nbsp; some of the worst&nbsp; beings on this planet. A lot of crazed&nbsp; dictators came from being poor, it&#039;s&nbsp; not a&nbsp; virtue, it&#039;s a circumstance. No one&nbsp; chooses&nbsp; to be poor.<br /><br />Yeah, Ronald&nbsp; Reagan did come&nbsp; from a&nbsp; time&nbsp; when movies&nbsp; were at war&nbsp; with the enemy, not at war with the nation that feeds them. Thompson is also from a&nbsp; different&nbsp; time. But, these&nbsp; are far and few&nbsp; between and they garner&nbsp; no support&nbsp; from Hollywood.<br /><br />Yes, good&nbsp; and evil&nbsp; are relative I am told, but, those&nbsp; same people&nbsp; who use that line&nbsp; see&nbsp; me and Bush, Cheney&nbsp; as &#039;evil&#039; and&nbsp; everyone&nbsp; else&nbsp; as misunderstood, victims , who if we were just &#039;nice&#039; to them they wouldn&#039;t behead&nbsp; us or fly planes&nbsp; into buildings. C&#039;mon, let&#039;s&nbsp; face it, we live&nbsp; on a planet&nbsp; where&nbsp; 3/4&nbsp; of the beings&nbsp; barely walk erect&nbsp; and&nbsp; the rest of them are the squabbling classes&nbsp; who think they can fix&nbsp; it by denouncing&nbsp; the other&nbsp; guy. The Euros&nbsp; are finally&nbsp; &#039;paying back&#039;&nbsp; the USA&nbsp; for being a&nbsp; Sap for&nbsp; 50 years and they are&nbsp; beating us up economically and they&nbsp; supported&nbsp; the Dictator&nbsp; we tried&nbsp; to overthrow to keep getting his Oil. Lets&#039;&nbsp; not forget our &#039;allies&#039;&nbsp; who&nbsp; after 9/11&nbsp; shed&nbsp; a&nbsp; tear while applauding and cheering that&nbsp; Uncle Sap&nbsp; was finally knocked from his pearch, now it&#039;s their&nbsp; turn, but, the Islamicists&nbsp; are going to give&nbsp; them a run for&nbsp; their money, lives and whats&nbsp; left of Euro-Tradition. But, it&#039;s&nbsp; all Bush&#039;s fault, if he only&nbsp; left Saddam alone, went into Afghan so Saddam and others&nbsp; could be freed up to support groups&nbsp; there, we would&nbsp; be in Afghan with a Strong Saddam and neither Khadafy or that imp in Iran would have stopped&nbsp; anything.&nbsp; <br /><br />Still, there&nbsp; is hope. When Bush leaves, Iran can restart their&nbsp; Nukes&nbsp; and we will have peace and justice again. Gitmo prisoners&nbsp; will be released, no more&nbsp; war, the birds are singing and the skys&nbsp; are clear.Then we&nbsp; really will get what we deserve in the West. I just hope I am far away&nbsp; from this&nbsp; wretched&nbsp; city known as&nbsp; NY, that I used&nbsp; to love, cause&nbsp; they are going to be first since&nbsp; they have&nbsp; been in the forefront of this disasterous misnamed &#039;Peace&#039; movement. They&#039;ll get &#039;Peace&#039;, the &#039;peace&#039; of the grave. <br /><br />Yes, we will be rid&nbsp; of&nbsp; the &#039;evil&#039; Bush and Cheney, we&#039;ll all get a prize from Osama, Al Qeada. We&#039;ll deserve it.

You can&#039;t be&nbsp; a&nbsp; &#039;part-time, peace activist.&#039; The UN had entered&nbsp; into&nbsp; the calculations&nbsp; of Saddam&nbsp; Hussein, it&#039;s why were&nbsp; there in first&nbsp; place, the Kuwait&nbsp; invasion and&nbsp; the no fly zone for 12 years.

I agree it looked bad, but, you don&#039;t change&nbsp; place with thousands&nbsp; of years of history overnight, or a few years. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Again, your arithmetic is ridiculously simplistic.&nbsp; This seems to be your world view:<br /><br />Against Bush = Liberal<br />Against war in Iraq = Pacifist<br />Against Bush = Against war in Iraq<br />Liberal = Pacifist<br /><br />So by conveniently lumping everyone into the same &quot;you&#039;re either with us or against us&quot; category perfected by the Bush administration, you can easily stereotype everyone who even slightly disagrees with the policies of this administration and dismiss their beliefs, because of your perceived belief that all these liberal &quot;pacifists&quot; go around idolizing Mao and Che and are enemies of the state.&nbsp; To me, it sounds like a little bit of dictatorship rubbed off on you from wherever you came from, because this line of thinking is ridiculously close-minded and dangerous.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh, and if the Bush administration is so concerned about human rights violations around the globe, where are they regarding Sudan and Darfur?&nbsp; Or on well-documented human rights violations committed by all sorts of American &quot;allies&quot; and/or business partners such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Turkey, China and so on?<br /><br />Finally, you mention playing with the cards you are dealt.&nbsp; Using that analogy, it seems to me that the United States was the dealer in many of those hands, since we propped up regimes like Saddam&#039;s for many years (and still support many vicious regimes around the world...look no further than Pakistan with &quot;President&quot; Musharraf) and turned a blind eye when he gassed the Kurds in his own country.&nbsp; It&#039;s only when he started misbehaving according to our rules that the tables turned.

FactCheck is&nbsp; an organization which ascertains the validity of political campaign advertisements researched this accusation. According to FactCheck , &quot;The Bush administration is doing a fair amount to fight corporate corruption, convicting or indicting executives of Enron, Arthur Andersen, Tyco International, Worldcom, Adelphia Communications Corporation, Credit Suisse First Boston, HealthSouth Corporation and others, including Martha Stewart. The Department of Justice says it has brought charges against 20 executives of Enron alone, and its Corporate Fraud Task Force says it has won convictions of more than 250 persons to date. Bush also signed the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation in 2002, imposing stringent new accounting rules in the wake of the Arthur Andersen scandal.&quot;<br /><br />When Factcheck.org checked the facts about allegations by Democrats that there was a scandal because of the &quot;no-bid&quot; contracts awarded to Halliburton they stated, &quot;It is false to imply that Bush personally awarded a contract to Halliburton. The ‘no-bid contract’ in question is actually an extension of an earlier contract to support U.S. troops overseas that Halliburton won under open bidding. In fact, the notion that Halliburton benefited from any cronyism has been poo-poohed by a Harvard University professor, Steven Kelman, who was administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy in the Clinton administration. ‘One would be hard-pressed to discover anyone with a working knowledge of how federal contracts are awarded...who doesn&#039;t regard these allegations as being somewhere between highly improbable and utterly absurd,’ Kelman wrote in the Washington Post last November.&quot; <br /><br />The Center for Public Integrity another public interest group also investigated the purported scandal of the Halliburton &quot;no-bid&quot; contracts. They wrote:<br /><br />In Iraq, Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown &amp; Root (KBR) has been awarded five contracts worth at least $10.8 billion, including more than $5.6 billion under the U.S. Army&#039;s Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) contract, an omnibus contract that allows the Army to call on KBR for support in all of its field operations. When the Army needs a service performed, it issues a &quot;task order,&quot; which lays out specific work requirements under the contract…From 1992 to 1997, KBR held the first LOGCAP contract awarded by the Army, but when it was time to renew the contract, the company lost in the competitive bidding process to DynCorp after the General Accounting Office reported in February 1997 that KBR had overrun its estimated costs in the Balkans by 32 percent (some of which was attributed to an increase in the Army&#039;s demands). KBR (obtained) the third LOGCAP contract in December 2001…<em>n November 2002 the Army Corps of Engineers tasked KBR to develop a contingency plan for extinguishing oil well fires in Iraq…<ul class="bbc_list"><li type="circle">n March 24, 2003, the Army Corps announced publicly that KBR had been awarded a contract to restore oil-infrastructure in Iraq, potentially worth $7 billion. The contract KBR received…would eventually include 10 distinct task orders. KBR did not come close to reaching the contract ceiling, billing just over $2.5 billion…The contract was awarded without submission for public bids or congressional notification. In their response to congressional inquiries, Army officials said they determined that extinguishing oil fires fell under the range of services provided under LOGCAP, meaning that KBR could deploy quickly and without additional security clearances.</li></ul><br /><br />Neither the Center for Public Integrity nor Factcheck.org determined anything sinister about Halliburton’s no-bid&quot; contracts for the Iraq war. Two nonpartisan, nonaligned, public interest organizations have investigated the Halliburton allegations and found them to be specious allegations made for purely political purposes.<br /><br />An L.A. Times op-ed of April 22 said, &quot;Halliburton Received No-Bid Contracts During Clinton Administration For Work In Bosnia And Kosovo.&quot; An October 2003 article in the (Raleigh, NC) News &amp; Observer quoted Bill Clinton&#039;s Undersecretary Of Commerce William Reinsch as saying &quot;&#039;Halliburton has a distinguished track record,&#039; he said. &#039;They do business in some 120 countries. This is a group of people who know what they&#039;re doing in a difficult business. It&#039;s a particularly difficult business when people are shooting at you.&#039;&quot;<br /><br />If Democrats want to investigate a scandal involving Iraq they should devote their efforts to the UN &quot;Oil-for-Food&quot; program instead of Halliburton. <br /><br />Wow, I didn&#039;t know that all the corrupt officials are all gone.&nbsp; I bet you counted them yourself and everything.&nbsp; You are bound to get someone if you keep accusing?&nbsp; Sounds a lot like the current administration&#039;s policy on the enemy combatants, if you ask me.<br /><br />There&nbsp; is no enemy, except Bush and Cheney, right? <br /><br />Your one-track, &quot;you&#039;re with us or against us&quot; mantra, shared by the Bush administration, is far more Soviet than anything I&#039;ve seen in the press, which happens to be largely controlled by corporations such as News Corp. and GE that are anything but &quot;Soviet.&quot;<br /><br />LOL.&nbsp; Again, News Corp. and GE, or Disney hardly qualify as &quot;soviet.&quot;&nbsp; Neither do Time Warner or Disney or Viacom or Clear Channel or any of the other huge corporations which control the largest media institutions in this country and the world.&nbsp; But perhaps such an aversion to &quot;cookie-cutter leftist indoctrinated Universities&quot; is why over a hundred White House lawyers all went to the same law school, Liberty University (owned by Pat Robertson).&nbsp; Hardly cookie-cutter nor leftist, I&#039;ll give you that.<br /><br />Except, there&#039;s a problem.&nbsp; Bush went to one of those cookie-cutter, leftist universities.&nbsp; Two, in fact.&nbsp; Harvard and Yale (certainly through only his own academic merits, with no help whatsoever from father and grandpa Bush&nbsp; :lol:).&nbsp; Seems to me that throws a monkey wrench into your equation.<br /><br /><br />Even in the Soviet Union, people&nbsp; slipped&nbsp; through indoctrination. </em></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

But, I do like how you sidestepped&nbsp; Jimmy Carter, that man did more damage&nbsp; to this&nbsp; country in four&nbsp; years&nbsp; than the last ten Presidents&nbsp; combined. <br /><br />BTW, You are&nbsp; incorrect about the bio and chem weapons, that Saddam never&nbsp; had, but, claims he did up until we enforced&nbsp; the ceasefire&nbsp; you claim&nbsp; there was&nbsp; never a war we went with him in 1991, which also never happened. <br />Paris, Moscow, Berlin, Brussels and Beijing the &#039;Peace Coalition&#039; all threatened to veto any U.N. move for the United States to war with Iraq. All of these members had vowed to strike a blow for &#039;peace&#039; and not challenge Saddam Hussein. However, Saddam had more than just diplomacy to thank our global allies for.<br /><br />Saddam was not one to settle for second best. Saddam had to arm his nation with the best military equipment the world could offer. Saddam&#039;s quest to arm his country led him on a shopping spree in Paris, Moscow, Berlin, Brussels and Beijing.<br /><br />Iraq&#039;s best jet fighter was purchased from France. The Mirage F-1 is considered to be a state of the art strike-fighter capable of launching advanced missiles. France has sold over 700 Mirage F-1 fighters to over 11 nations. Iraq had&nbsp; &nbsp;60 F-1 fighters in its air force inventory.<br /><br />The F-1 is capable of flying over twice the speed of sound and is normally armed with air-to-air missiles and twin 30 mm cannons. However, the F-1 also has a deadly strike capability. <br /><br />A Mirage F-1 was used by Iraq to launch two Exocet anti-ship missiles that struck the USS Stark before the Gulf War, killing over 40 American sailors.<br /><br />During the Gulf War, France sent a squadron of advanced Mirage fighters to assist the allied forces. However, the French fighter jets were effectively removed from the fighting area because their radar emissions matched the Iraqi F-1 jets. <br /><br />The allied air commanders quarantined the French jets, not allowing them to fly combat missions over Iraq, because they feared the Mirage fighters would be mistaken as Iraqi and be shot down.<br /><br />Iraq attempted to strike Saudi Arabia using two of its F-1 fighters during the Gulf War. The F-1s carried modified Exocet cruise missiles intended to strike at Saudi cities. Instead, the F-1 fighters were jumped by a Saudi Air Force F-15 Eagle and shot down, the only double kill during the entire war.<br /><br />The F-1 also appeared recently in a short video shown by U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell to the United Nations. The Iraqi F-1 is shown testing a biological/chemical spraying system at low altitude. The F-1 video is a telling example of Iraq&#039;s illegal biological and chemical weapons program.<br /><br />The effort and money expended to develop and test a spraying system for installation on a Mach 2 jet fighter is not something done on sheer whim. The difficulty and expense of modifying the top Iraqi jet fighter to carry biological and chemical weapons indicates a certain willingness to use these weapons. It also demonstrates the desire to acquire such weapon systems despite any U.N. ban.<br /><br />Saddam purchased a large number of French-made Aerospatiale and Eurocopter helicopters for his army. Both the Aerospatiale and Eurocopter systems can deploy chemical weapons. <br /><br />The Iraqi army is also well-equipped with what is considered to be the best artillery weapon in the world, the French-made 155 mm howitzer. The Iraqi army used its 155 mm guns during its war with Iran to fire chemical weapons as well as a large array of conventional munitions. <br /><br /><br /><br />The biggest weapons supplier to Iraq was Russia. Iraq reportedly still owes Russia over $4 billion for arms purchases in the past 20 years. Obviously, if Saddam Hussein was removed from power, Russia was not likely to be paid for the past weapons sales. <br /><br />The vast majority of Iraq&#039;s air force consists of Russian-made jet fighters. Iraq had nearly 200 Russian-made jet fighters including MiG-21, MiG-23, MiG-25, Sukhoi SU-22 and Sukhoi SU-25 interceptors.<br /><br />The Iraqi army is equipped with hundreds of Russian artillery pieces, rocket launchers, BMP armored vehicles, T-55 and T-72 tanks and Scud missiles. Most of Iraq&#039;s chemical arsenal, estimated at around 200 tons of nerve gas and mustard gas, is fired from Russian-made weapons.<br /><br />For example, Iraq recently modified a MiG-21 jet fighter to act as a radio-controlled chemical sprayer. In addition, most of Iraq&#039;s air-delivered chemical weapons deployed in its long war with Iran came from the belly of MiG-21 and MiG-23 fighter jets. <br /><br />Most of the estimated 100 tons of nerve gas that remained in Saddam&#039;s arsenal is thought to be stored in Russia-made bombs designed for the MiG fighters.<br /><br />In addition, U.N. inspectors recently discovered empty rocket warheads designed to deploy nerve gas. The rocket warheads in question are part of a Russian missile system sold to Iraq.<br /><br />The telltale sign that Al-Musayyib as a chemical weapons facility was the presence of Russian-made chemical decontamination vehicles that arrived to assist technicians dressed in Hazmat suits. It is only logical to conclude that the Iraqis were concerned for their safety, because one does not put on a Hazmat suit in the desert for the fun of it.<br /><br />Saddam turned to Europe and China in order to construct his chemical weapons production facilities. German and Chinese chemical manufacturing equipment has been purchased over the years and embedded into the Iraqi commercial infrastructure. The intent was to make these facilities as civilian-looking as possible.<br /><br />Israeli citizens discovered during the Gulf War that German-made electronics systems were found inside Scud missiles fired at Tel Aviv. <br /><br />The German electronics allowed Iraq to modify the Scud missiles, making them more accurate, cheaper to produce and much more deadly. <br /><br />Israel found that German-made electronics were the heart of the Iraqi Scud warhead fusing mechanism. The very same fusing mechanism was employed effectively by Iraq when a Scud fell on the U.S. Army barracks outside Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, killing 28 American soldiers and wounding over 100 others.<br /><br />Saddam turned to Belgium before the Gulf War in an attempt to improve his Scud missiles and to create a weapon never seen before in any military arsenal. Iraq contracted Canadian Dr. Gerald Bull to build a super-gun, using components manufactured in the U.K., Belgium, Germany and Italy. Dr. Bull&#039;s base of operations was Brussels, Belgium.<br /><br />Belgian officials ignored repeated warnings from Iranian and Israeli intelligence officials that Dr. Bull was developing such a weapon for Saddam Hussein. Dr. Bull also assisted Iraq by improving the accuracy and range of its existing arsenal of Scud missiles.<br /><br />Bull used weak Belgian export regulations to circumvent export bans against assisting Saddam&#039;s quest for super-weapons, trans-shipping much of the equipment for his super-gun and Scud projects through Brussels. <br /><br />In the end, Bull paid for his assistance with his life. An unknown assailant assassinated him outside his Brussels apartment.<br /><br />Saddam also turned to China in order to purchase the very finest in weapon systems. Iraq purchased a number of Chengdu F-7 fighter jets from Beijing and has managed to trans-ship spare parts made in China for its force of F-7 and MiG-21 fighters through illegal front companies in Jordan, Hong Kong and Singapore.<br /><br />China also supplied Iraq with a large number of T-55 and T-58 tanks equipped with modern night-vision gun sights and laser range-finding systems. Somehow, the Iraqis keep these tanks in tip-top condition with an ample supply of Chinese-made spare parts.<br /><br />It is well known that China sold Iraq the &quot;Tiger Song&quot; air defense system during the 1990s. Both Colin Powell and Condi Rice have stated that China sold Iraq its new air defense system. <br /><br />The sale took place despite the fact that China also signed on to the U.N. ban on weapons sales to Iraq. NATO gave the system its name in 1998 after it was discovered to be operational in the Iraqi desert.<br /><br />In 1994, German authorities seized a large shipload of ammonium perchlorate bound for Iraq. The Chinese Chemical Import-Export Corporation, a subsidiary of the People&#039;s Liberation Army, stated the chemical was bound for Baghdad as a food preservative. Anyone with half a brain knows that ammonium perchlorate is a lousy preservative but a key component in solid rocket fuel.<br /><br />In 2001, the Chinese Shangdong Arts and Craft Company went to Baghdad in an effort to open trade ties between Iraq and China. Interestingly, the employees of the Shangdong Arts and Craft Company do not make art or craft supplies. <br /><br />Instead, Shangdong Arts and Craft was a cover for Chinese army officers, who traveled to Baghdad in an effort to sell Saddam Hussein advanced missile technology.<br /><br />&nbsp;It was certainly&nbsp; no surprise we found Saddam&#039;s most advanced weaponry had markers on it citing manufacture in France, Russia, Germany, Belgium and China. <br /><br />

				FZ, you started this particular thread with some fairly slanted views and comments and then people reacted. What did you expect.&nbsp; If you looked at your starting post here you might see how it could come off that way.<br /><br />There have been plenty of fair debates and yes lots of head butting in this section since it started but usually it goes pretty smooth until open minds close down and the rhetoric starts in (on both sides).&nbsp; Looking at the Ron Paul thread it would also seem you stepped in with comments that seems pretty heavy handed and attacking.&nbsp; That thread was going along very smoothly before that moment.&nbsp; How can you expect anyone to convers with you when you come off so one sided.&nbsp; WHat comes to mind is your recent comment that &quot;Anti war views is really wanting peace for Al queda&quot;&nbsp; (my version of your quote and not your exact words).<br />It&#039;s always all or nothing with you.&nbsp; Not your way does not equal support for the enemy.

				FZ - while it is true that a lot of people on this board are left-leaning, there are also a good chunk that are right-leaning and in other categories altogether. They don&#039;t all enjoy political debate, though, which is why you may not be getting the support you hoped you would. I know some people that will actually ask for a topic to switch to something else if politics enters the conversation (face to face conversation).<br /><br />I think that many of us are angry at where we are in Iraq or even in the Middle East. It&#039;s very frustrating to me that we are pouring so much money into a war that isn&#039;t even ours to fight (a civil war that has been going on for hundreds of years) when we could be pouring that same money into our own country (a few ideas would be the healthcare, education, or my personal favorite - local family agriculture). I think that if Bush could admit that we are making a mistake (IMHO) or at least be more honest with the American people about what&#039;s going on over there, we would be more blase about him. But we&#039;re in a situation where it feels like the war will never be over, and it seems very likely that our next stop will be Iran.<br /><br />I appreciate our troops, but I think that they have been put in a never-ending battle and that they would do well to be in other parts of the world (perhaps even here!) where they are truly needed. I&#039;ve watched too many YouTube videos about our troops getting blown up or families agonizing over their husbands or children going to Iraq. Are our troops so indispensible to allow a war like this to continue? Are they that indispensible to an administration that seems to stay in Iraq to save face?<br /><br />I may not be right, but this is my own opinion. If you want to call that pacifist or liberal, go ahead. But I think that we each have a diverse viewpoint on Bush, and should be allowed to share that opinion in discourse.

Some here, who frequented&nbsp; some cafe&#039;&nbsp; called&nbsp; &#039;Freezepeach&#039; (Free speech.. clever. :-) , said they were offended by some of the signs of&nbsp; my buddy&nbsp; who owns&nbsp; the shop, basically America&nbsp; Love It Or Leave It. The store&nbsp; had been vandalised&nbsp; and&nbsp; he took some of the stuff down. But, posts continued&nbsp; here from the &#039;Peace and Tolerance&#039; mob, and were rife&nbsp; with such noble gestures as someone saying they would walk in and just stare down the WW 2&nbsp; combat veteran, a couple of others&nbsp; mentioned&nbsp; actions that had&nbsp; happened&nbsp; against the store. This&nbsp; is not mere disagreement, this is gestapo/soviet secret police&nbsp; tactics. Suppose I posted&nbsp; that&nbsp; a few fellow Astorians&nbsp; would walk into these cafe&#039;s and stare down people&nbsp; in Che&#039; T-Shirts, or Anti-Bush shirts, what would&nbsp; you call the people&nbsp; who did that my tolerant friend? So, speak for yourself, cause I hope you don&#039;t lump yourself with the people&nbsp; I just described, their call to intimidation is not&nbsp; DEMOCRACY. more&nbsp; &quot;PEOPLES&nbsp; REPUBLIC.&#039;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />p.s.- if you need a saddle for your high horse, there is a horse farm in France which sells them on the cheap.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

I too am very tired of being lectured to by people &nbsp;who support Castro, Che&#039; and the Soviet &nbsp;Union for &nbsp;years about &#039;human rights.&#039; I however can&#039;t &nbsp;ignore &nbsp;it, cause &nbsp;it&#039;s &nbsp;part of the media/academic structure, in short, the &#039;establishment&#039;, and &nbsp;I will continue &nbsp;to oppose it and do everything within my power to stop them as they are part of &nbsp;an internal &nbsp;enemy. <br /><br />As for &nbsp;%2, the figure &nbsp;is ludicrous, since &nbsp;every one of these I have ever seen has people on stage giving &nbsp;praise and love for Castro/Che&#039; and even for N&#039;Koreas Kim. Maybe, you haven&#039;t been paying attention, you know, &#039;ignoring&#039; the reality?<br /><br />I don&#039;t know who your &#039;Pro-War&#039; friend is, but, the President on down never said this war would &nbsp;be over in weeks, and the cowards &nbsp;to me &nbsp;are the frauds who claim to be &#039;Anti-War&#039; and pro these societies &nbsp;they only visit like Cuba, but, they would never live there, no, they choose &nbsp;to live in one of the centers &nbsp;of capitalism &nbsp;like New York. <br /><br />We were there &nbsp;cause Saddam had invaded &nbsp;a soverign nation.

We ended &nbsp;the suffering of Afghan and Iraqis, they will have to build their society. <br /><br />Lastly, we couldn&#039;t use one bullet to rid &nbsp;us of Saddam, the lefties made a law stopping that in the 70&#039;s to save Fidel and other pantheons &nbsp;of &#039;Freedom.&#039; I will give this to former &nbsp;Communists and Socialists, at least, they were &nbsp;a bit more honest about using so-called &nbsp;&#039;Anti-War&#039; groups as fronts to acheive &nbsp;Global &nbsp;Communism. I think the current crop of &#039;Anti-War&#039; leaders &nbsp;are like &nbsp;New &nbsp;Mobsters, or Klansman, they have better suits/ PR,but, to what end? It&#039;s &nbsp;suicidal, the Islamicists &nbsp;would kill them first and then they would &nbsp;get to people like me. But, I guess if the Feminists &nbsp;and Gay Rights groups &nbsp;can ignore &nbsp;Hundreds and thousands in the Middle-East, Persia &nbsp;and Africa being executed &nbsp;daily, while worrying that Pat Robertson or dead Falwell &nbsp;as &nbsp;their &nbsp;enemy, they must be &nbsp;&#039;ignoring&#039; reality.

Reason I used&nbsp; the UN, especially&nbsp; for the source&nbsp; of&nbsp; Saddam&#039;s arsenal,was&nbsp; it was the UN that authorised&nbsp; the removal of Saddam from Kuwait in 1991. Then when Saddam was&nbsp; NOT removed, the same people crying now about&nbsp; the Butcher of Baghdad&#039;s&nbsp; removal, said we left him there cause he&#039;s&nbsp; &#039;our&#039;&nbsp; buddy. Two years earlier, in the late 80&#039;s, after&nbsp; the same crowd&nbsp; in the UN stopped&nbsp; the Iranians and Iraqis from killing each other, this freed them to go back and&nbsp; gas his own citizens and for Iran to&nbsp; restart&nbsp; it&#039;s &#039;benevolent&#039; program of&nbsp; paying Martyrs&nbsp; who blew up tourists and kill hundreds throughout the 90&#039;s.

By the time of Shock and Awe, Khadafy&nbsp; and now we find even Iran , backed off a bit, probably because&nbsp; they were afraid&nbsp; of Jimmy&nbsp; Carter coming in and monitoring an election, OR, the bombing of Baghdad, just across&nbsp; their&nbsp; border, and the removal of a guy they fought for&nbsp; 12 years and couldn&#039;t remove. I&#039;m going out on&nbsp; a limb here, but, I think it&#039;s&nbsp; the latter. Of course&nbsp; the NY Times, TIME, NEWSWEEK, CBS, NBC, BBC, REUTERS and most of the rest are still looking for the &#039;looted&#039;&nbsp; Museum pieces, said&nbsp; to have been tens of thousands at the time, but,&nbsp; turned out they were safely tucked&nbsp; away.

				<strong>To be a Republican you need to believe:</strong><br /><br />1. Jesus loves you, and shares your hatred of homosexuals and Hillary Clinton<br /><br />2. Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad guy when Bush&#039;s Daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him, and a bad guy when Bush needed a &quot;we can&#039;t find Bin Laden&quot; diversion.<br /><br />3. Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is Communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony.<br /><br />4. The United States should get out of the United Nations, and our highest national priority is enforcing U.N. resolutions against Iraq<br /><br />5. A woman can&#039;t be trusted with decisions about her own body, but multinational drug corporations can make decisions affecting all mankind without regulation.<br /><br />6. The best way to improve military morale is to praise the troops in speeches, while slashing veterans&#039; benefits and combat pay.<br /><br />7. If condoms are kept out of schools, adolescents won&#039;t have sex.<br /><br />8. A good way to fight terrorism is to belittle our longtime allies, then demand their cooperation and money.<br /><br />9. Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy, but providing health care to all Americans is socialism. HMO&#039;s and insurance companies have the best interests of the public at heart.<br /><br />10. Global warming and tobacco&#039;s link to cancer are junk science, but creationism should be taught in schools.<br /><br />11. A president lying about an extramarital affair is an impeachable offense, but a president lying to enlist support for a war in which thousands die is solid defense policy.<br /><br />12. Government should limit itself to the powers named in the Constitution, which include banning gay marriages and censoring the Internet.<br /><br />13. The public has a right to know about Hillary&#039;s cattle trades, but George Bush&#039;s driving record is none of our business.<br /><br />14. Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime, unless you&#039;re a conservative radio host. Then it&#039;s an illness and you need our prayers for your recovery.<br /><br />15. Supporting &quot;Executive Privilege&quot; for every Republican ever born, who will be born or who might be born (in perpetuity.)<br /><br />16. What Bill Clinton did in the 1960&#039;s is of vital national interest, but what Bush did in the &#039;80&#039;s is irrelevant.<br /><br /><em>Friends don&#039;t let friends vote Republican! </em><br />

				<br />http://wexlerwantshearings.com/<br /><br />&lt;the site can be somewhat &#039;funny&#039;&gt;<br /><br /><strong>Wexler Launches Online Push for Cheney Impeachment Hearings</strong><br />at WexlerWantsHearings.com<br /><br />Following the release of an online op-ed advocating for Cheney impeachment hearings by Representatives Robert Wexler (D-FL), Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), all Members of the House Judiciary Committee, Wexler has launched an ambitious online effort to mobilize support for immediate impeachment hearings for Vice President Dick Cheney. <br /><br />Wexler, a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, has launched www.WexlerWantsHearings.com to mobilize grass roots and netroots support from across the nation in order to increase pressure on Congress to hold hearings. In a new video, featured at www.WexlerWantsHearings.com, Wexler issues a strongly worded statement in favor of hearings.<br /><br /><strong>&quot;Our Constitution mandates that the House of Representatives hold Presidents and Vice-Presidents accountable when they commit High Crimes... Accountability and the rule of law are not partisan; they are American. They supersede politics and strategy. We must hold all of our leaders accountable. No exceptions,&quot; </strong> &nbsp;Wexler states on the video.<br /><br />A copy of the online op-ed by Wexler, Gutierrez, and Baldwin, entitled &quot;A Case for Hearings&quot;, is available at www.WexlerWantsHearings.com. <br /><br />In the editorial, the three Members of the Judiciary Committee declare that serious charges have been made against Cheney &quot;relat[ing] to his deceptive actions leading up to the Iraq war, the revelation of the identity of a covert agent for political retaliation, and the illegal wiretapping of American citizens.&quot; <br /><br />The Members of Congress further state that &quot;the worst legacy of the Clinton impeachment – where the GOP pursued trumped up and insignificant allegations - would be that it discourages future Congresses from examining credible and significant allegations of a constitutional nature when they arise.&quot;<br /><br />Wexler is encouraging the online community and netroots to join together to support hearings. Wexler will take part in a Blogcall Press Conference on December 14, at 10:30 am with leading bloggers to advocate for impeachment hearings.<br /><br />For more information, visit www.WexlerforCongress.com or email campaign AT wexlerforcongress.com.

				<strong>To Be a Democrat, You Need to Believe:</strong><br /><br />Drug addiction is a disease that should be treated with compassion and understanding...unless the addict is a Conservative talk show host.<br /><br /><br />The United States should be subservient to the United Nations. Our highest authority is not the U.S. Constitution, but a collective of tinpot dictators (and their appeasers) and the U.N. charter.<br /><br /><br />Government should relax drug laws regardless of the potential for abuse, but should pass new anti-gun laws because of the potential for abuse.<br /><br /><br />Calls for increased security after a terrorist attack are &quot;political opportunism,&quot; but calls for more gun control after a criminal&#039;s spree killing is &quot;a logical solution.&quot;<br /><br /><br />&quot;It Takes a Village&quot; means everything you want it to mean...except creeping socialist government involvement in the nuclear family.<br /><br /><br />Disarming innocent, law-abiding citizens helps protect them from evil, lawless terrorists and other thugs.<br /><br /><br />Slowly killing an unborn innocent by tearing it apart limb from limb is good. Slowly killing an innocent disabled woman by starving her to death is good. Quickly killing terrorists, convicted murderers and rapists is BAD.<br /><br /><br />Every religion should be respected and promoted in public schools the name of diversity, so long as that religion isn&#039;t Christianity.<br /><br /><br />The best way to support our troops is to criticize their every move. This will let them know they&#039;re thought of often.<br /><br /><br />Sexual harassment, groping and drug use are degenerate if you&#039;re the governor of California, but it&#039;s okay if you&#039;re the President of the United States.<br /><br /><br />Sex education should be required so that teens can make informed choices about sex, but gun education should be banned because it will turn those same teens into maniacal mass-murderers.<br /><br /><br />Minorities are blameless for the hatred of the racist; women are blameless for the hatred of the rapist; but America is entirely at fault for the hatred of Islamofascists.<br /><br /><br />Poverty is the cause of all terrorism...which is why the leaders of al Qaeda are typically U.S.-educated and were raised in wealth and luxury.<br /><br /><br />The Patriot Act is a horrific compromise of Constitutional rights, but anti-Second Amendment laws and Franklin Roosevelt&#039;s Presidential Order 9066 must be regarded &quot;reasonable precautions.&quot;<br /><br /><br />We should unquestioningly honor the wishes of our age-old allies, even when said allies no longer act like our allies and have vested economic interests in propping up our enemies.<br /><br /><br />Socialized medicine is the ideal. Nevermind all those people who spend every dime they have to get to the United States so they can get quality medical care...that their nation&#039;s socialized medical community can&#039;t provide.<br /><br /><br />Michael Moore, Noam Chomsky and Natalie Maines are perfectly qualified to criticize our leadership, but Arnold Schwarzenegger, Charlton Heston, and Dennis Miller are just ignorant political hacks.<br /><br /><br />John Lott&#039;s research on how gun ownership reduces crime is junk science, but Michael Bellesiles is still an authority on why gun control is good (even though he was forced to resign from Emory due to research misconduct over his book &quot;Arming America&quot;).<br /><br /><br />Bush&#039;s toppling the Saddam regime was a &quot;diversion,&quot; but Clinton&#039;s lobbing a couple of cruise missiles at Iraq in the thick of the Lewinsky sex scandal was &quot;sending a message.&quot;<br /><br /><br />A president who lies under oath is okay, but a president who references sixteen words from an allies&#039; intelligence report should be dragged through the streets naked.<br /><br /><br />Government should limit itself to the powers named in the Constitution, which include banning Second Amendment rights and shopping the courts for judges sympathetic to causes that wouldn&#039;t pass in any legislature.<br /><br /><br />&quot;The People&quot; in the First Amendment means The People; &quot;the People&quot; in the Fourth Amendment means The People; &quot;the People&quot; in the Ninth Amendment means The People; &quot;the People&quot; in the Tenth Amendment means The People; but &quot;the People&quot; in the Second Amendment (ratified in 1791) means the National Guard (created by an Act of Congress in 1903).<br /><br /><br />You support a woman&#039;s &quot;right to choose&quot; to kill her unborn child, but don&#039;t believe that same woman is competent enough to homeschool the children she bears.<br /><br /><br />Proven draft-dodging is irrelevant, but baseless claims of AWOL status is crucial to national security.<br /><br /><br />Threatening to boycott Dr. Laura&#039;s and Rush Limbaugh&#039;s advertisers is exercising Freedom of Speech, but threatening to boycott CBS&#039;s &quot;The Reagans&quot; and Liberal actors over their asinine anti-American remarks is censorship and McCarthyist blacklisting. <br /><br /><br /><br />_____________________________________________________<br /><br />I mean, c&#039;mon.

I wasn&#039;t labeling you, but, you feel compelled&nbsp; to defend&nbsp; &#039;communists&#039;, I don&#039;t feel compelled&nbsp; to defend&nbsp; fascists. Just because&nbsp; ideas&nbsp; are said to fall on one side or another doesn;&#039;t mean we have to walk in lockstep. You can support the war, like&nbsp; Leftist Chris Hitchens, or be against&nbsp; it cause you don&#039;t&nbsp; like&nbsp; war like Rightist Pat Buchanan. I have met plenty of people and have known both &#039;Right&#039; and &#039;Left&#039;, what I find&nbsp; is the &#039;Right&#039; is quick to denounce&nbsp; extreme&nbsp; Right, Fascist/Nazi, but, many on the Left feel compelled&nbsp; to defend the most extreme Communist/Collectivist.&nbsp; Why is that, I don&#039;t know, makes&nbsp; many on the Left look real bad, especially when spouting about Human &#039;rights&#039;, &#039;Justice&#039; and &#039;Health&#039; care. <br /><br />I&#039;m glad you&nbsp; do explode the myth&nbsp; that all wealthy people are on the &#039;Right&#039;, it&#039;s&nbsp; a total myth, all anyone has&nbsp; to do is walk along the West-Side of Manhattan and watch the &#039;Proleteriat&#039; cruise&nbsp; around&nbsp; and patting themselves&nbsp; for&nbsp; their&nbsp; &#039;concern&#039; , and denouncing the close-minded middle class, uneducated oafs. <br /><br />Now, you offer you are a progressive&nbsp; who runs a $30&nbsp; Million company, that&#039;s&nbsp; great, but, denouncing what you call people pushing Jesus, which is the calling of Christians, while hugging Commies as&nbsp; &#039;Good&#039; People, makes you look bad. If you truly are concerned with Human Rights and especially&nbsp; Gay Rights, you should be on my side in favor of taking the War right to the Islamicists. I don&#039;t get the opposition?<br /><br />I resent being a labeled alot of things and MY car, with a&nbsp; Bush/Cheney sticker was vandalised&nbsp; several&nbsp; times. I find it hard to believe the other is true, and at this very site , when I first came, a thread threatening a long standing Astorian and Veteran of WW 2 was&nbsp; applauded&nbsp; and jokes&nbsp; were made about it. I&#039;m just not feeling the &#039;tolerance&#039;, can you help me?<br /><br />Of course, if you don&#039;t see the NYT or the Niagra&nbsp; Falls of media&nbsp; as&nbsp; enough &#039;Liberal/Progressive&#039;, maybe, you&#039;re not as &#039;progressive&#039; as you think. Actually, I would believe all this &#039;progressive&#039; thinking, IF, all these millionare progressives would invite&nbsp; me and millions of&nbsp; other lower middle class&nbsp; types&nbsp; to the Hamptons and Upper West Side, help the poor live better, open up a homeless shelter&nbsp; right&nbsp; next to&nbsp; their homes, and send their kids&nbsp; to oublic school. It would be a start, after all, you know how we&nbsp; &#039;Right-Wing&#039; extremeists&nbsp; are, we need to be shopwn things. :)

				Man, politics on the web: pandora&#039;s box best left closed.<br /><br />For the record, I&#039;m the one who lit the fuse on that original thread with that &quot;business owner posting &#039;patriotic&#039; displays in his front window&quot; issue.&nbsp; I think what set me off was that someone had noted they saw human s___ deposited in front of the man&#039;s doorstep, and the general gist was this wasn&#039;t such a bad thing.&nbsp; And I thought that sort of attitude was not kosher, that such an act was incredibly juvenile and wrong and that whatever the guy&#039;s political beliefs (which, for the record, I&#039;m luke warm on), he had every right to use his store window however he pleased (which I perceived as a deeply foolish move business wise ... why make a public display of your political beliefs at your place of business when the strong possibility exists that this will alienate potential customers who really shouldn&#039;t have to care one way or the other about your political beliefs).<br /><br />I pretty much checked out of here right after that for a number of reasons (and this will be a one-stop flashback for me here, although I do read the site regularly as it often has great info on new stuff in the neighborhood).&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because at that time, I fully believed what FZ does about the clique-ishness, but have since come to realize cliques form naturally within every web endeavor and have just as many positives (social support system) as they do negatives (childish sense of &quot;insider&quot; status that&#039;s often unwittingly displayed by clique participants).&nbsp; The left-leaning stuff?&nbsp; Sure, that&#039;s true, but I rarely find it all that offensive.&nbsp; If FZ has lived here for decades (and I&#039;m sure he has), then he knows the lay of the land, knows that most people on this site are much newer to the neighborhood, more than likely have college educations and well-paying jobs in Manhattan, and I gather this forms some sort of gray, threatening cloud of gentrification to some people who&#039;ve lived here for a very long time.&nbsp; (On one hand, I&#039;m part of that cloud; on the other, I&#039;ve lived here long enough to feel genuinely threatened by the outrageously rising rents and property values.)<br /><br />I think I soured on the whole &quot;website as community&quot; thing around that time, surely not just this site.&nbsp; To me, it felt more like loneliness and a need to connect, the most insidious aspect of the web being that to fight loneliness and connect requires you to sit alone in front of a computer.&nbsp; It just felt mentally unhealthy to me then and still does now. (This site is a lot more rational than some I&#039;ve been on, where name-calling fights occur on a daily basis.)&nbsp; With this site in particular, I really soured on it when it was brought home to me that I actually recognize some of you on the street from avatars or photos posted here (which seems like a potentially dangerous thing to do given the dark corners of the web).&nbsp; Most people on web message boards don&#039;t live in the same community, and it occurred to me that the sort of half reality/half unreality world of the web becomes very well when the guy you may be arguing with vehemently over some silly issue might be just down from the block you.<br /><br />At some point, it&nbsp; occurred to me that I have more real, human interactions with people just sweeping leaves on my landlord&#039;s sidewalk.&nbsp; Neighbors say hello.&nbsp; Dog walkers thank me for clearing broken glass.&nbsp; People I normally wouldn&#039;t even glance at stop to make small talk.&nbsp; I guess because they recognize I&#039;m some part of the community, doing something positive, and, as I do with them, when I glance up and nod or say hello, they want to share in some type of positive belief that we&#039;re living in a good place ... because of moments like this.&nbsp; (For the record, the only people who blow me off, aside from asshole teenagers, are clearly newer, younger people who&#039;ve moved here recently.&nbsp; If they&#039;re looking at me and thinking, &quot;Look at that older Greek guy sweeping the sidewalk, hope he doesn&#039;t threaten me, assuming he speaks English,&quot; all I can think is I&#039;m not that much older, of Irish lineage, come from a small town in Pennsylvania, am a vaguely artsy person, been to college for what it&#039;s worth, and the simple fact is my landlord is very old, needs help keeping her property in order, which I gladly do as I&#039;m paying human, sane rent, and in doing so, have found the basic connection to a community that felt just as baffling and closed to some woman walking by me with downcast eyes who assumes I&#039;m hitting on her instead of just doing my landlord a nice favor.)<br /><br />I relate just as much to FZ as I would to anyone here vehemently disagreeing, or posting dog pictures or what have you (hint: don&#039;t do s___ like that ... it only justifies his point of view ... it&#039;s degrading and out of place, and you know it is when you do it).&nbsp; In all honesty, I&#039;ve given up on politics, have an extremely negative view of both sides of the fence, so it&#039;s no skin off my nose however all this stuff breaks.&nbsp; My ultimate point here?&nbsp; I guess it&#039;s that when it comes to politics on the web, always look beneath the surface and try to figure out what&#039;s really going on, because it&#039;s rarely the issue at hand.&nbsp; If I&#039;m reading FZ right, I&#039;m thinking he sees this board as not indicative of the entirety of Astoria (when the reality is that would be impossible to encompass on one website) and that bothers him.&nbsp; While it doesn&#039;t bother me, I know exactly what he&#039;s saying.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure what he&#039;s looking for (if he&#039;s dealt with political zealots of any stripe, he knows he&#039;s not going to change their minds, however well or not well reasoned his points of view are ... in my mind politics are friction, sometimes healthy, sometimes not), but I think what he&#039;s trying to say is &quot;this is me, and I don&#039;t see myself represented here in any meaningful way&quot; ... other than a lone voice in the left-leaning wilderness that is(n&#039;t) Astoria.&nbsp; And I respect that on a level beneath whatever surface level bullshit goes on here.&nbsp; I suspect we&#039;d get along fine if we nodded at each other while I was out sweeping, as would a lot of people here disagreeing with him.<br /><br />Now, if you&#039;ll excuse me, have to get down to the hardware store by Alba&#039;s to get a new snow shovel, as I broke the other one Wednesday night on that hard slushy s___ we had.&nbsp; Play nice!

				Above post:&nbsp; well said.&nbsp; Your reasons are mostly why I stay out of these debates largely across the board.&nbsp; And I suspect it&#039;s why many others do as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is a good informational site on Astoria, but debating politics is not of interest to me.&nbsp; &nbsp;I post once in a blue moon, but for the most part I ignore these threads.&nbsp; <br /><br />OK, back to ignoring.&nbsp; I have some cleaning to do!

				Jiggs, I&#039;ve always felt that politics absolutely cannot be turned into something that&#039;s black and white, right or left.&nbsp; In reality, I think you will find that most people are like you....with convictions and beliefs on the issues that may sometimes lean to what is considered the left, and sometimes to the right.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s pretty absurd to expect that people should either faithfully follow and believe in everything the left espouses, or what the right espouses.&nbsp; Such thought usually leads to extremism, in my view.&nbsp; One thing I was trying to bring up throughout the thread and in the debate with FZ is that it&#039;s wrong to immediately label someone a &quot;leftist,&quot; or a &quot;communist&quot; or a terrorist sympathizer or a Mao supporter just because they disagree with President Bush on one issue, even on several issues.&nbsp; That just goes back to casting brushstrokes in either black or white and eliminates the middle ground which most people actually find themselves in, in reality.

You&nbsp; Hoping? :lol: I guess&nbsp; that&#039;s&nbsp; one way to&nbsp; eliminate opposition. :wink: I feel, I am progressive, in science, medicine all the way up&nbsp; to space&nbsp; travel. It&#039;s why I became&nbsp; an aeronautical engineer. Just&nbsp; cause&nbsp; something is labeled&nbsp; &#039;Progressive&#039;, doesn&#039;t&nbsp; mean it&#039;s good, cancer, AIDS and disease&nbsp; is progressive, Communism and Fascism&nbsp; can be &#039;progressive.&#039;&nbsp; On the other hand, &#039;Conservative&#039;, can mean stuck in an old way, refusing to change anything , even when confronted&nbsp; with a different&nbsp; reality. One can &#039;conserve&#039; the &#039;traditions&#039; of slavery, indentured&nbsp; servants and&nbsp; race separation. Yes, on a one to one basis, Nazi guards&nbsp; have been know&nbsp; to help people&nbsp; escape&nbsp; and Communists&nbsp; have&nbsp; done the same, but, they are also part of&nbsp; a group. I too, am a middle-age man, successful can be open to interpetation. I feel I have done&nbsp; OK, but, find&nbsp; myself, after nearly&nbsp; my entire&nbsp; life living in NYC, and see it get better, to want to get the heck outta&nbsp; here. I worry the same people&nbsp; who elected&nbsp; Dinkins, with 2,500&nbsp; murders&nbsp; a year,will get in charge again. People&nbsp; have short memories. They forget&nbsp; what NYC had turned&nbsp; into before&nbsp; Guiliani. The so-called&nbsp; &#039;Free&#039; Press is more concerned&nbsp; with publishing Journalist Donna Hanovers&nbsp; side of events&nbsp; and&nbsp; suddenly are &#039;concerned&#039; on the treatment&nbsp; of women by Rudy, while&nbsp; letting the &#039;Queen&#039;, sorry, Senator of NYC and her&nbsp; Husband&nbsp; roll along as&nbsp; the &#039;ideal&#039; married&nbsp; couple. Of course this has zero&nbsp; to do with competance, but, that only matters&nbsp; when the &#039;wrong&#039; person is surging in polls.&nbsp; :wink:<br /><br />As for your non-compromise:<br /><br />First, once&nbsp; you catagorize&nbsp; people, based on gender, race, sexual orientation, things&nbsp; beyond&nbsp; control, it sets&nbsp; up situation open for&nbsp; abuse and &#039;special&#039; rights. I would&nbsp; say&nbsp; equal&nbsp; rights&nbsp; for&nbsp; all citizens.<br /><br />Second, it&#039;s&nbsp; not a just a &#039;womens right&#039;, it&#039;s&nbsp; also&nbsp; the &#039;sperm donor&#039;, as males have been degerated too in this modern society. Of course, many men are at fault&nbsp; for allowing their status as&nbsp; fathers&nbsp; and &#039;beings&#039; to reach such&nbsp; denigration. If we are talking abortion, certainly if no identifiable&nbsp; &#039;Male&#039;&nbsp; is involved or objects, it should be solely the womens right to choose. Otherwise, she made her&nbsp; &#039;choice&#039; when she became impregnanted&nbsp; voluntarily by the&nbsp; dummy. <br /><br />Third, there is no separation of Church and State. The Constitution the says&nbsp; &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . .&quot; The phrase &quot;separation of church and state&quot;, does not appear in the Constitution. So, the argument is&nbsp; UnConstitutional.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; It is telling that &#039;Church&#039; is mentioned, not Mosque&nbsp; of&nbsp; anything else. The &#039;target&#039; is quite&nbsp; clear.&nbsp; :wink:<br /><br />Fourth, I too am a firm believer in &#039;Gun Control.&#039;&nbsp; I used&nbsp; to go to a&nbsp; firing range, every week. There is no doubt, if&nbsp; I was ever&nbsp; in a situation, I would hit the right target.<br /><br />I would think, if you search your&nbsp; memory, someone, a teacher or relative, or&nbsp; the news, influenced&nbsp; a&nbsp; 12 year old to join a protest? As for my parents and family, they are/were wonderful people, their kindness was&nbsp; repayed&nbsp; by merciless&nbsp; attack and&nbsp; death, by nazi and communist alike. I don&#039;t&nbsp; intend&nbsp; on letting that follow&nbsp; me here, in the land of&nbsp; the free. However, when I see&nbsp; the madness&nbsp; that has gripped the self-haters and the embracing of those&nbsp; who want to destroy&nbsp; the society, a heart attack may not look so&nbsp; bad.&nbsp; :-(

				For what it&#039;s worth, the &quot;separation of church and state&quot; comes from some of Thomas Jefferson&#039;s correspondence and the first example of the people in America enforcing this is the Flushing Remonstrance (http://www.queenslibrary.org/irc/gallery/index.htm), which is actually on display in the Flushing library to celebrate its importance during this overly combining nature.<br /><br />Also, FW, for years both conservative and liberal justices have preserved this separation. Why? Because it&#039;s absolutely essential for an effective, sustainable government.

After the Lawyers&nbsp; Guild and it&#039;s Marxist/leninists allies have &#039;interpreted&#039; the laws and just plain run roughshod up until&nbsp; recent decades, like in the 80&#039;s and beyond, when&nbsp; religious&nbsp; people, escpecially &#039;Christians&#039; became politically involved.

The point is today, for&nbsp; tens of millions&nbsp; of Americans, it&#039;s Christmas&nbsp; Day, if it&#039;s not for you and me, don&#039;t celebrate&nbsp; it. But, Christians have&nbsp; a right&nbsp; to the public square.

I&#039;m just curious as to the details, where it happened and the surrounding events. <br /><br />It&#039;s unconstitutional to deny religious displays because they are religious, but it&#039;s also unconstitutional (as has been deemed by court verdicts) to display the symbols of only one religion. You really can&#039;t have just a cross in a public park--only show casing one religion in a public area has been determined to be an endorsement (or establishment) of that religion over others and is not allowed.<br /><br />Now, there certainly may be places where no one has protested or lodged complaints and, thusly, parks with one cross remain.

				As an Atheist, I could care less about what is displayed, as long as all fictional character worshippers are treated equal with respect to what can be displayed. People should be able to display whatever they want, including a Yule tree, to remind all the christians that all these &quot;christmas traditions&quot; are not really christian, but have all been taken and influenced by the pagan holiday Yule.

I would also note that Democrat Carolyn Maloney ousted Republican Bill Green in 1992, in the congressional district that includes LIC and Astoria, which further leads me to believe that Astoria went for Clinton in 1992. <br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah, let&#039;s&nbsp; pickall of Queens, and&nbsp; the 1992, with Perot and when Bush sr. lost&nbsp; as the total barometer.

I figured I&#039;d give the &#039;Politics&#039; board a look and that the debate here would be robust, but, at least in the realm of reality. Sadly, I see the usual crackpot theories and nutty websites that are par for the course on the web channeled here too. Still, as someone who came to this country from Europe, and whose relatives were butchered by both Nazis and Commies, I can attest to extremism when I see it. One such extremism is the hatred and sheer lunancy that has gripped many folks against the President. It is not based on reality anymore. The removal of Saddam and the Taliban were not only a needed move, but, it opened a region closed to the outside and bought the fight and current attack of Islamic extremists to their home, after they bought it to ours for decades culminating in 9/11. You may not agree, and I don&#039;t, with some of the early military decsions, but, given the military available after the draconian cuts during the 1990&#039;s, the USA had to act fast after 9/11. The newly discovered &#039;concern&#039; for &#039;human rights&#039;, by those who supported Castro for decades, on what is happeing on Gitmo, Cuba is bad enough, but, to say the Patriot Act and some other MODEST measures, compared to what FDR did in WW 2, makes Bush a &#039;dictator&#039; is ludicrous on the surface. Only slip and fall attorneys and the legal establishment who want to treat this as a &#039;crime&#039; problem could possibly believe it. <br /><br />We live in a world of REAL dictatorships. China, who is flooding our markets for at least 15 years with cheap goods, often dangerous, are builidng up their tech and communist Armed forces. Chavez in Venezuela, Hollywoods buddy after Castro, who has suspended and rewrote the entire constitution and is trying to be President for life, cozying up to Irans leader a holocaust denier who wants Nukes, and was onlt &#039;stopped. albeit temporarily by the&nbsp; removal of Saddam in 2003. We are told the world &#039;hates&#039; us cause of GW. The REALITY is that in Europe, Germany, France, the two heads of the so-called &#039;Anti-War&#039; movement recently elected decidedly Pro-War and Pro-USA leaders. Anyone can now see that the war is turning the tide and the extremists are on the run. The only ones who refuse to see this are people who are tired of war, understandable, and unrepetent Anti-Semites like Pat Buchanan, who have teamed up in an &#039;unholy&#039; alliance of assorted America haters, righties and lefties. In the end, we have no choice, but, to fight this war. Retreat is surrender. My nephew is in Iraq, and I want him home NOW, but, when I send him articles of what is being written and shown from Hollywood/media about his and his fellow soldiers efforts, he is angry and disgusted and tells me how it bears little to reality. Yes, there have been lies in this war, from the media, like the Museum &#039;looting&#039; story early on, and how the whole war was based WMD&#039;s in Iraq, and not the 17 resolutions Saddam violated. How the incidents in Abu Ghraib were the norm and not the exception, and finally a slap in the face of tens of millions of Americans who elected Bush TWICE and the media cast doubt and disparaged it. The President did the right thing, and I believe history will prove it. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I agree with the original move by Bush to get rid of saddam but he didn&#039;t go far enough.<br />he fought a PC war and when you are fighting animals who cut off heads and stone and lash women who get raped because it is their fault you will not win.<br />The Airforce should have gone in with B-52&#039;s and just bomb the hell out of the resistance strong hold.<br />The only thing they understand is force, the extreme Muslims will kill all of you die hard liberals if they get the chance and that is what you can not understand. <br />Do not think that they think like you because they don&#039;t.<br />When the day comes when people understand that they don&#039;t have western values for human lives is the day we can win this war.<br />If GW would hide bombs in a hospital or a school he will be thrown out before he can finish nuuk-elar but when Saddam or Ahmendjad (however the F u spell it) they are heroes

				Why would it be ridiculous?&nbsp; Even if you feel that &quot;overthrow&quot; is too strong a word to use, saying that they pretty much voted along party lines is accurate.&nbsp; I mean, it was a 5-4 vote if I&#039;m not mistaken, it wasn&#039;t as if all 9 justices just saw through what was happening in Florida and all ruled one way or another on the letter of the law.<br /><br />Plus, if the legislative and executive branches of government can be corrupt (and they are, very much so), then why would the judicial branch be any different?&nbsp; Just because judges are supposed to be &quot;impartial&quot;?&nbsp; Politicians are supposed to &quot;serve the people&quot; too, and we see how often that happens, from both the left and the right.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry, but calling everyone who casts doubt on the Supreme Court&#039;s decision, especially when they are backing up their claim with valid issues that perhaps were not examined as carefully as they should have been (willfully or otherwise), comes off as being just as, if not more, close-minded than those who you accuse of being close-minded and ignorant.<br /><br />Finally, here&#039;s a hypothetical which should serve as some nice food for thought.&nbsp; Let&#039;s suppose that the elections in 2000 and 2004 were switched, with Bush winning a clear majority in 2000, but with the whole Florida recount/elections fiasco taking place in 2004.&nbsp; Now let&#039;s assume that the vacancies which came up in the Supreme Court during Bush&#039;s second term actually occurred during his first term, and Bush ended up nominating Roberts and Alito during his first term as a result.&nbsp; Then let&#039;s assume that the Florida election issue made it all the way to the Supreme Court in 2004.<br /><br />We would have a situation where Bush&#039;s re-election would depend on the Supreme Court, whose Chief Justice and one other member will have been chosen by Bush himself.&nbsp; There would be quite a dilemma here.&nbsp; Roberts and Alito could choose not to vote due to the obvious conflict of interest, but then there would only be 7 justices voting, with two of the court&#039;s more conservative judges abstaining.&nbsp; That would create a risk of Bush losing on a party-line vote among the 7 remaining justices.&nbsp; Of course, Alito and Roberts might choose not to abstain in such a situation, which would likely result in a 5-4 vote for Bush.&nbsp; However, that would raise questions, as in that case, Bush practically *chose* two of those justices, who would more than likely have voted for Bush in such a situation.&nbsp; <br /><br />And if this sounds far-fetched, I&#039;d say think again.&nbsp; If an election could make it to the Supreme Court in 2000, it can make it again anytime.&nbsp; So the above scenario, while it did not actually play out, raises, in my opinion, serious questions, because something like this could certainly happen one day.&nbsp; It&#039;s quite a glaring loophole in the system of checks and balances, in my opinion.

				Actually you guys are all way off base. It is a question of modesty. Islamic law is similar to Jewish law in that respect. According to Judaism a woman, married or not, is not allowed to be alone with a man in an enclosed space, whether it&#039;s a car, a room in a house, or just a house. It&#039;s supposed to be a sort of protection for the woman in case the man gets an &quot;urge&quot; (sexual I mean) to act out on what he deems to be a possible sexual encounter. So the fact that that woman was given lashes makes every bit of sense according to the Laws of Islam. Granted in Judaism those types of &quot;punishments&quot; were given up long ago based on the idea that Jews today are on a lower level spiritually than the Jews who lived in the past, so the Rabbis felt that since we are on a lower plane of being and we are all (men and women) equal ( so to speak), we have no right to punish others.<br /><br />&nbsp; The fact that in Jewish and Islamic traditions that women are treated as unequals is besides the point since Rabbis and Imams would never see it the way that you or I do, speaking from a laymans point of view. It&#039;s a different way of seeing life.<br /><br /><br />OK that was wayyyyyy off topic.

				<strong>Frappe</strong>, <strong>Sweeper</strong>, here is a resource that evaluates nations on the basis of the freedoms their respective citizens enjoy. Note that while comprehensive within its own objective methodology, the project certainly circumscribes the results. That said, I find it a very useful tool for evaluating the health of civil liberties, giving me (and I apply my own personal value judgment here) an indication of which countries are &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot;.<br /><br />http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=15<br /><br />From their methodology statement:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Freedom House does not maintain a culture-bound view of freedom. The methodology of the survey established basic standards that are derived in large measure from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. These standards apply to all countries and territories, irrespective of geographical location, ethnic or religious composition, or level of economic development.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />To put it somewhat tritely, while the number of IKEA outlets might not satisfactorily determine the level of freedom in a country, evidence of say, enforced, non-voluntary and gender-discriminate genital mutilation certainly does.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=8887.msg106904#msg106904">Quote from: Jtrane on December 31, 2007, 02:36:56 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You&#039;re automatically assuming that everyone across the globe has the same access to information that you and I have in this country.&nbsp; That&#039;s obviously far from the case.&nbsp; People in Afghanistan or rural parts of Pakistan?&nbsp; Iraq has just been bombed back to the dark ages, and they&#039;re just hoping to get consistent running water and electricity back on a day to day basis.<br /><br />[snip]<br /><br />But the point I&#039;m trying to make is that not everyone has the benefit of access to information like you claim, especially in those countries that lack even a modest infrastructure.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><strong>Jtrane</strong>, I understand what you&#039;re saying, but some sort of &quot;informatic determinism&quot;, whereby countries with greater access to information have an advantage in establishing rule of law/civil liberties fails to take into account quite advanced nations that not too long ago were ruled by totalitarian governments.<br /><br />In other words, what excuse was there for Stalinist Russia or Nazi Germany? The latter certainly had all the &quot;benefits&quot; of being an advanced society -- industry, economy, culture, etc. Yet that didn&#039;t stop them from falling off into the (thank God short-lived) abyss....<br /><br />Clearly the level of &quot;advancement&quot; in a society, while it might put the brakes on oppression, is not enough of a guarantee. And I believe it&#039;s been argued that precisely because (for example) Nazi Germany was so modernized, the govt could implement a horrifically engineered and institutionalized oppression (replete with legal, economic and physical infrastructure to support it).<br /><br />So, if lack of/access to information doesn&#039;t adequately explain why oppression exists (and contiunes to perpetuate) in some countries, what does?

				Sweeper:&nbsp; Sure its truly obvious when using our value system.&nbsp; Anything is.&nbsp; What makes this value system superior to another?<br /><br />Legal systems and laws are always an expression of the groups which constitute the power of a culture.&nbsp; One which is more inclusive does not represent a more enlightened one.&nbsp; In our case, adult white males did not come to a humanistic opiphany and permit women and minorities to be included (how many women and black are there in the very progressive movie, &quot;12 Angry Men&quot;?).&nbsp; Their inclusion represents a compromise.&nbsp; From a strict demographic standpoint, both of the said groups are still woefully underrepresented.&nbsp; From a power standpoint, they are represented equal to their economic power.&nbsp; A brief study our history of our legal system would make this abundantly clear.&nbsp; Even better, look at the evolution of the legal system of the Roman Kingdom/Republic/Empire.&nbsp; Aparthied fell for the same reasons.&nbsp; So did slavery in the western world: the Brits got rid of it when the economics no longer made sense and it held out in America and Brasil much longer because it did make economic sense.&nbsp; The Russians banned serfdom in 1861 for the same.&nbsp; Nowadays, its much cheaper to have wage slavery than actual slavery.&nbsp; The only enlightenment MacMillian&#039;s &quot;Winds of Change&quot; speech rested upon was that it no longer made economic sense to hold onto the colonies of Africa.&nbsp; If the native populations did not get the sense of nationalism and develop the powerbase which rivaled that of Europe, then we&#039;d still have Rhodesia, the Belgian Congo and Southwest Africa on our maps.&nbsp; This can go on for pages.&nbsp; It all points to the fact that we do not command any moral superiority.&nbsp; It simply shows that our god is money.&nbsp; Money dictates the power of our culture and our legal systems and laws represent this.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sharia law is the product of a legal history which is six times as old as our nation, with its roots before the Viking invasions of the British Isles.&nbsp; While economics has played a part in its development, it places a higher priority on religion.&nbsp; While money is our ultimate decider between who is right and wrong, Allah is their decider.&nbsp; The sanctity of Allah is more important than the sanctity of life or free speech.&nbsp; Its more important that the tradition and culture be maintained than it is to allow folks to prosper.<br /><br />Its not an abnormal thing to judge other cultures with our own value system.&nbsp; But the measures provided by sweeper and dimartian are just that.&nbsp; We get so wrapped up in the superiority of our own culture, its difficult to fathom another culture which just does not share the same priority system.&nbsp; Is difficult to even get one&#039;s arms around it.&nbsp; <br /><br />And by saying that something is true, without any sort of investigation, because it is seems so obvious, is faulty.&nbsp; Does a heavier rock fall faster than a lighter one when dropped?&nbsp; It seemed obvious it would for quite a long time.&nbsp; Seemed obvious to the European powers that their value system was innately superior to those found in the lands they colonized.&nbsp; <br /><br />

As a non-religious, socially-tolerant, pro-capitalist radical, it&#039;s pretty clear what my fate would be in a state run by say, the Taliban.<br /><br />If anything, movements like the Taliban and Al Qaeda are quite modern in their effective use of violence, organization and enforcement of power. In many respects the Taliban takeover in 1996 resembled the Bolshevik coup d&#039;etat in 1917; and afterwards, certainly the means by which they secured power was a classic display of terror tactics and purges.

				Greetings all,<br /><br />I am very disappointed by this thread. I&#039;ve never in the course of one thread had so many people violate the guidelines of this board. Calling people names, using hate speech, and personally attacking people is not permitted on these boards. I&#039;m locking this thread now.<br /><br />Sorry.
