				http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/21129038/full_metal_mccain<br /><br />It&#039;s a good read, reminds me of some of the Hunter S. Thompson contributions to RS from the days of yore...<br />It&#039;s decidedly anti-McCain, but not trying to disguise itself otherwise. Even moreso, I&#039;d say it&#039;s a piece against the ignorance of strict party line voters and the fear tactics used to keep them in line.

But if you can&#039;t see all the harm that Bush has done in the last eight years, then you really need to wake up and smell the coffee. Every time you post, when someone disagrees with you, it turns into some bitter battle of left vs. right, anti-bush vs. patriots etc. It doesn&#039;t have to be that. Everyone who has posted replies to your arguments has <em>tried </em> to understand your point of view, but you get all defensive and say that people who are anti-bush aren&#039;t patriots and crap like that. That&#039;s bullshit!&nbsp; Can&#039;t you post something without it sounding like it came straight from the effing White House? <br /><br /><br />*end rant*

I disagree on some of the implementation of policy, I was in favor of a larger&nbsp; force in Iraq, not&nbsp; disbanding the entire Iraq army, butm removing Saddam was&nbsp; the correct thing, IMO. It was also the opinion&nbsp; of the Clintons, Pres. Clinton signed an order in 1998,Hillary voted&nbsp; for it as Senator, seeking the removal of Saddam. See, I can say&nbsp; something positive&nbsp; about&nbsp; the Clintons. :-)&nbsp; Further, I call the enemy Islamicfascists, the Bush Admin doesn&#039;t like that, so there&nbsp; is another example. Now, if&nbsp; someone&nbsp; can provide&nbsp; me one criticism of how the so-called &#039;Anti-War&#039; folks and the democrats&nbsp; have acted the last 8 years, I&#039;m listening. After&nbsp; all, they are not &#039;saints.&#039;&nbsp; :wink:
