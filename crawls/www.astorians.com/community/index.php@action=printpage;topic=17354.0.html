				Hey all,<br /><br />Besides the obvious dinner, flowers, etc. my girlfriend mentioned wanting to go dancing on Valentine&#039;s Day.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for something not terribly expensive (Water&#039;s Edge has both but 100 bucks a person which I can&#039;t afford right now).&nbsp; I have a few places I am considering for dinner, so a separate venue is not an issue.&nbsp; We usually like to dance to popular stuff, not techno or anything typically heard in clubs.&nbsp; A live band would work too.&nbsp; Thanks for any suggestions you may have.

				As a fairly old-fashioned, senior citizen I am just wondering if your GF might be willing to forgo dancing if she was forced to keep staring at something diamond on her 4th finger?

				Haha nice idea, but we&#039;re not quite ready for that yet.&nbsp; Not to mention if I am looking for affordable options, that certainly isn&#039;t it.&nbsp; :)

				Cavo is having a special Valentine&#039;s Day menu&nbsp; -- I think it&#039;s $65 per person, but you can check their site.<br /><br />I think they also have dancing - it might be worth giving them a call. I know that they do on New Year&#039;s Eve.<br /><br />I&#039;m told their food is very good and the atmosphere is very nice.&nbsp;

				You probably want to go dancing in the evening, but I just saw on WLA that there are free salsa classes being offered in the afternoon on Valentine&#039;s Day. Here&#039;s the link: http://www.whyleaveastoria.com/events/free-salsa-class<br /><br />Thought that might be more in your price range!&nbsp; :-)
