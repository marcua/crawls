				There&#039;s an &quot;eating and drinking establishment&quot; coming to that little strip on 23rd Avenue that houses Sal, Kris &amp; Charlie&#039;s. anyone know what the deal is?<br /><br />From DOB: http://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/JobsQueryByNumberServlet?requestid=4&amp;passjobnumber=420803143&amp;passdocnumber=01

				Yep - I believe it&#039;s going to be a bar/pub run by the folks behind the Irish Rover. Not sure if it will be an &quot;Irish Rover 2&quot; (the Rover doesn&#039;t serve food) or something else more elaborate (possibly), but the ownership in the two establishments is definitely connected.

				Oh, duh â€” http://queensnyc.com/2013/02/word-on-the-street-astorias-irish-rover-may-be-expanding-to-a-second-location/<br /><br /><br />I missed that when you posted back in February. Thanks for the intel, Meg.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve always thought that little strip had potential for something beyond what&#039;s there. That, and the strip that Tony&#039;s Bicycle is on.

				Walked past this today and saw the new sign &quot;Astoria Tavern&quot; placed in gold lettering over the top, with ornate lights underneath. Nice to see some progress.

				&quot;Astoria Tavern&quot; next to Sal, Chris and Charlies under the viaduct at 35th and 23rd Avenue. Some of the scaffolding has been taken down revealing the upper part of the storefront.

				Rest of the scaffolding is down and storefront is fully exposed. Looks okay, I suppose. All new and shiny- looks out of place in that spot at the moment.

				Out of place now, but with how the neighborhood is changing, probably not for long. I&#039;ve always loved that weird little strip under the train tracks there. I wonder if new places like this will push things like SKC out or just be a nice complement to them.

Hipsters love them, too, as do all sorts of people in between these opposing groups. Their reach is amazing. Plus their value is extremely good for the money, so I don&#039;t see them being pushed out.

				It will be a sad day if SKC is ever pushed out. And I agree with Meg- I&#039;ve only been going to SKC for 6-7 years, but it&#039;s always refreshing to see how packed that place is (and how quickly the line moves) and how it&#039;s the same guys working there. The clientele is so ecletic, you&#039;ve got construction workers, cops, mobsters, and people like me all in the same line, waiting for sandwich in perfect harmony. :)

				I was walking by yesterday, and a fat guy doing construction told me the grand opening is Friday night. Curious to see what it looks like, but I&#039;ll probably wait a week or 2 to let the initial curiosity die down

				They open tonight. I walked by last night and peeked inside. Believe it or not, it looks a lot like Irish Rover. Nothing crazy, just a nice, long, fully-stocked bar with 10 or so taps. Darts in the back.

				Stopped in last Friday before the Yankee game.. it is almost a mirror image of The Rover. Bathroom layout is really the only difference in layout. Nice and clean for now- bit of a mixed group at 5pm. Didn&#039;t stop in on the way home, but it wasn&#039;t terribly crowded around 11pm or so. Thankfully, the music wasn&#039;t set at 11. You could hear it from across the street, but not annoyingly loud for the neighbors (what few there are in the immediate vicinity).
