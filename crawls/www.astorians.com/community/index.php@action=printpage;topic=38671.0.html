				Lefkos Pirgos is closed, the windows whitewashed and no tables and chairs on the sidewalk.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Though I&#039;ve only been there a few times, it was a very nice place with excellent pastries and a friendly wait staff.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

				The pastries always looked delicious to me but I never felt comfortable walking in there.&nbsp; I got the impression it was a place for men to hang out.&nbsp; I knew this place was going to close.&nbsp; They want to combine 4 stores that are closed and make 1 big place

				While the service was very slow even by Greek standards it was kind of like one of the first Greek sweet shops in Astoria. I think it was here even before Omonia if I&#039;m not mistaken. Now after Athens cafe and this place closed Astoria feels a little less Greek.

I thought I read someplace that they might build a larger building on that entire footprint and then open new retail.&nbsp; As for Lefkos Pirgos, I hope they do well in that old bank space.&nbsp; It will be nice to see that kind of café on that corner.&nbsp; I agree it was not the friendliest cafe but maybe the new address will give the whole place a fresh start.

				I peeked in the windows and was surprised to see they still have pastries in their cases.&nbsp; Would have thought they would have cleared out before they closed.<br /><br />How long till they open the new shop?&nbsp;

				Walked by today and saw that Lefkos Pyrgos was in the midst of an auction. There were people inside - making bids, I imagine. Construction has started on the three retail spaces next door, too - it&#039;s all one big space now. I wonder what&#039;s going to go in there eventually? Things are changing...

				Soooo here&#039;s the latest from a reliable source:&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Lefkos which takes the corner on 31st and wraps around 23rd Ave and the 3 other storefronts on 31st is now being worked on.&nbsp; this reliable source tells me this will be&nbsp; ..... (drumroooollll pleese) ...... a Time Warner Cable Center.&nbsp; Personally, I rather have that than some tall building taking up that expensive corner!&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Peace out!&nbsp; :cheesy: <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em><span style="font-size: 0.7em;" class="bbc_size">(Please be kind to our Planet Earth and all its habitats and creatures)</span></em>

				if that is true - it&#039;s a waste of space.&nbsp; It&#039;s a great spot for a restaurant / outdoor café.

				In reply Bored Temp:&nbsp; speaking of waste of space among other things is that so-called Medical Bldg along 31st Street which I heard will be torn down.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Peace out ~

I had heard it was going to be a Comcast service center but Time Warner is just as bad. Useless waste of space - a cafe or clothing store would have been better.
