				Hi guys --<br /><br />Wasn&#39;t quite sure where to ask this, but this seemed like maybe the section.<br /><br />Has anyone had any positive/negative experience with any particular real estate brokers in Manhattan?&nbsp; Most of the offices I&#39;ve found so far seem maybe more on the shady side.<br /><br />I am looking to rent in the East Village area (I&#39;ve put in my time here in Astoria, alas), if that helps.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />

				Well, you have to have a lot of money up front to pay the fees of 12-20% of a whole year, plus security and first month and your apartment is almost guaranteed to be small, but good luck.&nbsp; The East Village is a nice place to live.&nbsp; I really liked living there during my years in college.&nbsp; Sorry no recommendations though, I&#39;ve never been able to justify the fee to myself and I have too much stuff for a small space at twice what I pay here.&nbsp; Sorry to see you go :(

				I would suggest finding some buildings you like and seeing if you can find out who the managing agent is. Then call the managing agent and ask if they have any apartments available. In general managing agents can&#39;t charge broker&#39;s fees. Unfortunatley a lot of them have setups where they&nbsp; have in house brokers or will only rent through a certain broker, which sort of kills the advantage.

				^^^, yeah, i hear you on the cost.&nbsp; i have yet to experience that true city life though.<br /><br />^^, cool, thank you for the link.<br /><br />^, great idea.&nbsp; i actually am not feeling too picky about exact buildings, but that is an interesting idea -- though yes, you might be right about them still trying to get a fee of some sort.&nbsp; everyone around here will take your money, that&#39;s for sure.<br /><br />thanks guys!

				I would try buying the Gabriel&#39;s book that lists all the management offices in the city. <br /><br />I lived in many different apartments in manhattan and did not pay broker&#39;s fees.&nbsp; They are out there, you just have to do the legwork.&nbsp; Many walkup buildings list the management companies in their lobbies, complete with phone numbers.&nbsp; It also wouldn&#39;t hurt to buzz the super if they live in the building.&nbsp; They can often tell you what is currently open and can sometimes show you.&nbsp; Sometimes they even now what is about to open up.&nbsp; <br /><br />As someone mentioned above, canvas the area and go to the buildings that you like.&nbsp; <br /><br />don&#39;t sign anything from a broker unless you plan on using them.&nbsp; Sometimes you can &quot;backdoor&quot; the broker and go right to the management office after the broker shows you the place.&nbsp; They will often try to get you to sign something prior to looking at a place so you can&#39;t do this.&nbsp; Just flat out refuse and they will most likely show you the place anyway. <br />

				A broker will charge up to 15% of the first year&#39;s rent. It&#39;s a lot, but that&#39;s what&#39;s beginning to happen in Astoria now too (I negotiated 12%). Just be prepared to pay a lot of fees when working with a broker and have all your paperwork (taxes, referrals, pay stubs, etc) ready from day one- they won&#39;t wait for you. The rental market in the EV is much tighter that Astoria, and the housing stock by and large sucks. Aside from the usual Craigs List, I would recommend walking the streets and talking to people. Especially supers. Maybe a sublet would be a good first step for you - sometimes they turn into actual lease holding opportunities, but there is no guarantee. You&#39;d be able to see if you like living there at least. This is a better time of year to be looking - you want to avoid the late Spring and early Fall when students are en masse moving here with Daddy&#39;s money.<br />Best of luck!!

				FYI:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">(http://www.newsday.com/images/nynews/defaultheader-darkblue.jpg)<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>New York City</strong></span><br /><hr /><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>City warns about online rental ads</strong></span><br /><strong>BY SARA STEFANINI</strong><br />amNEWYORK<br /><br />October 27, 2006<br /><br />A quick scroll through housing rental advertisements in New York City on popular Internet sites reveals a number of attractive &quot;NO FEE&quot; alerts, embellished with asterisks and exclamation points for maximum visibility.<br /><br />Those promising postings aren&#39;t always for real, warns a City Council report released yesterday. In fact, about one-third of brokers who list no-fee properties probably are lying, the Committee on Oversight and Investigations found.<br /><br />In September, the committee called 223 real estate agents who had advertised no-fee apartments on craigslist.org and backpage.com, two popular Web sites that list classified ads.<br /><br />When asked if they charged a broker&#39;s fee, 31 percent said they did, despite what their ad said. Another 4 percent said the cost was noted on the posting, in small print at the bottom. Of those with fees, 87 percent charged either one month&#39;s rent or 10 percent to 15 percent of yearly rent.<br /><br />&quot;These ads are costing New Yorkers thousands of dollars,&quot; Councilman Eric Gioia (D-Woodside), chairman of the committee, said at a news conference yesterday. &quot;The truth is that you can&#39;t put an ad in a newspaper that&#39;s dishonest, and we&#39;ve gotten pretty good at protecting against that.&quot;<br /><br />To better control the online real estate market, the committee recommended that the city Department of Consumer Affairs, which regulates advertising, act as a monitor of Internet listings and check into complaints sent to Web site administrators. It also suggested that the department increase its fines for violations, which range from $50 to $500, and that it relay any findings to the state Department of State, which can revoke an agent&#39;s license.<br /><br />&quot;We look forward to working with the Council to both strengthen those protections and expand our efforts to educate consumers,&quot; department spokeswoman Dina Improta Roskins said.<br /><br />Craigslist.org and backpage.com are two of the largest rental-listing sites covering the city. About 3,000 city rental ads are posted on backpage.com every month, said Carl Ferrer, the site&#39;s founder. Both he and Craig Newmark, who founded craigslist.org, have tried in recent years to supervise the no-fee promises themselves. Newmark said he has gone so far as to kick repeat offenders off the site. Both support the City Council&#39;s suggestions.<br /><br />&quot;We rely currently on the community and other brokers to report the bad apples,&quot; Ferrer said. His site receives 20 to 30 complaints a month about deceitful agents, he said.<br /><br />Robert Eichner, president of the Manhattan Realtors Association, said he was shocked by the fraud the committee found.<br /><br />&quot;The magnitude is out of control,&quot; Eichner said, adding that most deceitful agents probably use the &quot;bait and switch&quot; technique, luring customers with a deal that&#39;s too good to be true.<br /><br />He was skeptical of the consumer affairs agency&#39;s ability to control the problem.<br /><br />&quot;The spirit is good, but do they have the resources and the staff for such an undertaking?&quot; Eichner said. &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
