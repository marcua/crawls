				<br />Health Care Crisis: <br />What Will Cure the System’s Ailments?<br /><br />Featuring<br />Jonathan Cohn <br />Senior Editor, The New Republic <br />Senior Fellow, Demos<br />Author:Sick: The Untold Story of America&#039;s Health Care Crisis--and the People Who Pay the Price <br /><br />VS.<br /><br />Sally Pipes<br />President and CEO, The Pacific Research Institute <br />Author: Miracle Cure: How to Solve America’s Health Care Crisis and Why Canada Isn’t the Answer <br /><br /><strong>Co-Sponsors: Demos &amp; The Pacific Research Institute</strong><br /><br />Health care is shaping up to be the most important domestic policy issue of the 2008 President Election. More that twelve years after the political failure of the Clinton health care plan, Americans seem eager for the Federal government to revisit the issue in a broad based manner. The states have been acting on their own, with Republican governors spearheading plans that have upset many conservative health policy analysts. <br />Is America’s hybrid system <strong>the best, or worst</strong>, of government and private health care? How do we balance the desire for cost containment and innovation? How can the system sustain the increasing demands that baby boomers will place upon it? <br /><br />Wednesday, May 9th, 2006 <br />6:30 P.M. Prompt<br />(Free and open to the public - Reception to follow) <br /><br /><strong>Donnell Public Library<br />20 West 53rd Street<br />(Between 5th and 6th avenue) </strong> <br /><br />Mission of the Donald &amp; Paula Smith Family Foundation <br />The Foundation defends free speech and a free society through the critical examination of ideas, sponsoring debates and related activities in the New York area. In a world where philosophical arguments all too often take the form of partisan rancor and anti-intellectual appeals, the Foundation hopes to serve as a reminder that we are united by a deeper loyalty: to skeptical analysis, reason, and truth-seeking. The Foundation aims to foster informed debates that are both vigorous and civil, on topics ranging from economics to ethics, from politics to art, and beyond. Some debates will yield clear answers and some debates can never be settled, but the argumentative process itself can serve as a model of rational discourse in an often divided society. <br /><br /><br />The Donald &amp; Paula Smith Family Foundation<br />(152 West 57th Street, 22nd Floor )
