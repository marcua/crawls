				Depending on the condition of stone a skilled mason might be able to repair/reset/relevel the slate.&nbsp; <br /><br />Most of the regulations relate to gaps and unevenness rather than the material used.<br /><br />The link below if from NYCDOT which has some info on sidewalk regulations.&nbsp; If I&#039;m reading it correctly, damage caused by tree roots might be covered by the city if their instructions are followed.<br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/faqs/sidewalkfaqs.shtml

				&nbsp;I build gardens for a living and do&nbsp; stonework, its how I make my living. What you have is either true blue, or blue/grey/green New england blue stone. New stone is about 6 to 8 dollars a sq ft ( randome rectangle 3in). The value of&nbsp; your&nbsp; stone&nbsp; would be offset by the cost of moving it and getting rid of it. garbage is about 90 a yard.&nbsp; &nbsp; The other guys option of resetting may apply. It depends on what your site conditions are. ie are their huge tree roots, are their drainage issues,&nbsp; etc.. The problem with that though is also labor cost. If those stones are 5&#039; sq. then it will take 3 people to set them. Its the size and weight.&nbsp; If you get get 3 guys for under 100 an hour&nbsp; you&#039;ll be doing well.&nbsp; Figure it will take about 20 to 30 minutes per stone with no cutting.&nbsp; First, pick up all the stone, then excavate underneath, then 3/4 crushed drain rock, then a 2 inch base of stone dust, then tamp it and re set the stone. A good guestimate&nbsp; would be in the 325 to 500 range for redoing the stone.&nbsp; Thats just a rough gauge , but&nbsp; it will give you something to jump off of.&nbsp; Some people dont add a drain base, or use a tamper so it may be less.. depends on the process, but thats how Id do it.<br /><br />&nbsp;Good luck

				I got the same notice for blue stones on 42nd Street between Bway and 34th Ave and my neighbor three houses down - same type of sidewalk - got one as well. Ours were from February. Anyone else in the neighborhood receive one? The City says the rate for replacement is $8.02 per square foot for 4-inch thick sidewalk. I don&#039;t know if a private contractor could do it for less as I have yet to investigate as I do not really want to lose the stones. Sigh.

				I&#039;m reviving this topic because the City is going to replace in the coming weeks the sidewalk I mentioned here back in 2009. I still have time to do the repair myself (well, to hire someone to do the repair). Can anyone recommend a contractor/mason who has experience with bluestone sidewalk? I&#039;ve been googling, but coming up short. It may be too expensive for me to have them reset, but I want to explore all the options. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

				Be careful if you use the city contractor. Story from a friend was that they give you very little time to make repairs and push their contractor who can do the work ASAP. In their case, contractor did a horrible job, pitched the sidewalk so that water gathers in one spot on their property, hit gas lines, created ConEd drama for the entire block and sidewalk had to be redone again because curb was incorrect, which resulted in another citation for the homeowner.
