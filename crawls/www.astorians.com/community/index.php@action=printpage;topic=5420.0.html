				OK... So I&#039;m halfway thru this piece of garbage and I&#039;m wondering... since I DVR&#039;d it, is it possible they made a mistake and edited out all the funny stuff, or does this movie just really, REALLY suck?<br /><br />I&#039;m going to hold off watching the rest of it until I hear some of your responses.<br /><br />I have precious few free hours to waste them on crap like this.

				I enjoyed this movie, though there aren&#039;t a lot of laugh out loud parts, however, the first time I saw it, I didn&#039;t like it, the next time (not sure why there was a next time) i liked it more, and the story goes from there...now I like it, but am over watching it often...however I had a similar experience with Anchorman...fell asleep the first time, now I can&#039;t get enough of it.

				Alexa, I am the same as you. I saw Napoleon Dynamite and couldn&#039;t get through it the first time. Someone gave me the DVD as a gift and once I watched it again I did like it a bit more. No matter how many times I see Anchorman, I don&#039;t like it. Same goes for the 40-Year Old Virgin. Everyone loves that movie, I just think it&#039;s boring and not so funny. <br /><br />About 10 years ago I saw Cable Guy (Jim Carey and Matthew Broderick) in the theater and I got up and left before it was over. When I saw it again on HBO, I actually was laughing at it. Guess movie tastes change over time?!

				GOSH! Did that suck.&nbsp; So glad to see others feeling the same way. Just didn&#039;t get all the hype when it was in the theaters. Some of the ideas are funny but overall not a funny movie.<br /><br />

				I didn&#039;t like &quot;Napoleon Dynamite,&quot; and I practically lost a few friends over not liking it.<br /><br />(I do, however, like the original Napoleon Dynamite a.k.a. Declan Patrick Aloysius MacManus.)

				Napoleon - I have heard a lot of mixed reviews about it...I have to say that I went through a phase after I started to like it that I would watch it whenever it was on. Now, I think it is funny, but don&#039;t watch it.<br /><br />Anchorman - I HATED this when I saw it, and now, I know it by heart....please give it a chance TRX...it is just soooo funny, but I guess I have movies that I can&#039;t stand too. <br /><br />The movie that I wanted to get up from the theatre and leave was actually Dumb and Dumber....I couldn&#039;t believe I was on a date (okay, I show my age now) and watching this (needless to say, I love the movie now and have it memorized. <br /><br />The other movie that I labored through in the theatre was Austin Powers 3...I was horrified that I paid moneyu to see it...but I can appreciate the &quot;b&quot; quality of it now.

				It was quirky more than a funny film (Napoleon Dynamite).&nbsp; I think the funniest scenes are all in the second half to last fourth of the film.&nbsp; The first half is mainly character development.&nbsp; It has it&#039;s funny moments.

I would&#039;ve loved to have been taken on a date to see that.

				I saw Napoleon Dynamite last summer with my sister and was totally disappointed.&nbsp; It&#039;s just not funny, or entertaining, or amusing, or any other postive adjective one might add to describe a well known popular movie.&nbsp;

				I actually found Napoleon Dynamite amusing.&nbsp; Not hilarious, but amusing.&nbsp; The wife hated it.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s just a particular type of humor that doesn&#039;t appeal to everyone.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard from numerous people that it gets better with multiple viewings, but I&#039;ve got plenty of other things to watch.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now Dumb and Dumber I refer to as &quot;Dumb, Dumber and Dumbest&quot; with the dumbest being anyone who actually liked it.&nbsp; just what I refer to it as, not looking for a fight...&nbsp; ;-)

				I just saw this thread and have to add my .02 cents. I thought it was mildly amusing the first time. But it&#039;s one of those movies where quotes and scenes pop into your head after the fact. Talking about it at work is funnier than seeing the movie. Know what I mean?<br />
