				Does anybody know of a synagogue or regularly-meeting minyan in Astoria?&nbsp; We checked out the Astoria Center on Crescent and 27th, and they were very nice, but I guess with a couple of excpetions we were the youngest people by about 50 years&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; An internet search yielded something about &quot;Beth Jacob&quot; at 28th st. between 23rd Ave. and Ditmars, but the building seems to be a Greek social club and the phone number doesn&#39;t work.&nbsp; I know there are a couple of synagogues in Long Island City, but those are a bit far and orthodox and, I&#39;m guessing, also aged congregations -- not that there&#39;s anything wrong with those things, but like I said, we wanted to meet people closer to our age, and we&#39;re not necessarily tied down to any particular denomination (e.g., Orthodox, Conservative, Reform).<br /><br />Does anybody have any ideas about the options (if there are any)?<br />Thanks!

				Hi Benny,<br />there is nothing here that comes close to being Bnei Jeshrun or the like unfortunately.<br />That said, if we generate interest, would you be interested in doing an informal minyan/friday night service similar to the parkslope minyan and other independents?<br />-Miri

				I&#39;m not necessarily interested in a regular minyan, but I&#39;m definitley interested in a younger Jewish Astoria community.&nbsp; I went to Astoria Center for the high holidays last year and it was definitely a mostly older crowd, but since they had free services for first time visitors, there were definitely some younger folk interspersed.&nbsp; I think part of the problem is that when people like us go and see all the older people, we don&#39;t go back so quickly, so we don&#39;t run into the other younger people.&nbsp; It wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea to try to get a bunch of interested &quot;younger folk&quot; (under 70) to band together for events there.&nbsp; There are definitely some people trying to gear younger there, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be working.

				I wasn&#39;t suggesting a regular religious minyan that follows traditional models either...<br />I was thinking something more freestyle, maybe Shabat dinners once a month with a family style service, from Debbie Friedman to Carlibach to Israeli music, if people want it could be drumming and dancing, pretty much going with the flow of being spiritual without per say religious.

				Hey Ben<br /><br />Welcome to the neighborhood.&nbsp; My husband and I have also been half-heartedly searching for a younger (more modern?) congregation.&nbsp; We&#39;ve been to the Astoria Center a couple of times but we&#39;re not interested in joining.&nbsp; <br /><br />A year and a half or so ago a few of us joined a yahoo group called AstoriaJews.&nbsp; The group has been somewhat dormant save for a picnic in the early summer.&nbsp; Many of the member are actually members at Astoria Center - so if you check out the postings there you&#39;ll see a number of the events are at AC.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck - keep us posted on what you find.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

				Folks,<br />&nbsp; Thank you for your responses; it is nice to see that other people are interested in this topic.&nbsp; I agree with the suggestion that maybe some of the younger folks might &quot;band together&quot; to try things at the Astoria Center.&nbsp; I will probably continue to go there on Saturday mornings (but will be out of town for the holidays).&nbsp; But I also think that it would be nice to do something less formal and &quot;religious,&quot; and it seems like a few of you may also be interested -- somebody suggested a monthly Shabbat dinner, which sounds fun to me, especially when wine involved.&nbsp; And there are always less time- and effort-consuming options as well, like a book or study group, or pre- or post- shabbat drinks, or kebab-eating contests at the kosher Uzbek restaurant in Rego Park (I&#39;m only slightly joking...).&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; Anyway, I&#39;m not quite sure what the best forum for discussing these things would be.&nbsp; Perhaps it should be moved to the yahoo group that somebody mentioned (and that I just signed up for)? Or should it stay here as a running thread?&nbsp; Or should somebody make a &quot;Community Group&quot;?<br />&nbsp; Thanks!<br />ben

				Jews in da &#39;hood my brothers and sisters!&nbsp; This sounds good to me.&nbsp; And the Rego park idea for Uzbeki food rocks!&nbsp; I too read that article in NYT food section about &quot;Regostan&quot;.<br /><br />GFB is right that most of us seem to be here on astorians (and not that much of a minority) and not super religious. This works for me as im more of a cultural jew than an observant house of worship type.&nbsp; And of course I am open to more of that.&nbsp; <br /><br />What I like about being Jewish:<br />Ability to carry on more than 4 conversations at once with only 3 people involved.<br />I know that at a chinese restaurant (or any other) you are meant to share you meal.<br />Ability to use flem and coughing sounds when pronouncing appropriate words.<br />Humor humor humor<br />And much much more.

				A sukkot (let&#39;s see how many different transliterations we can get) dinner is a fantastic idea.&nbsp; It could be at somebody&#39;s apartment, or if we are really adventurous, we could try to see if there is a sukkah around that we could use (maybe Astoria Center will have one?).&nbsp; Of course, if anyone is interested in building a sukkah, that can be looked into, but I&#39;m guessing that most of you have the typical Astoria front lawn/back alley situation which is not ideal for such purposes (not to mention the fact that I, at least, am not about to ask my new landlady for permission to construct and decorate a large wooden booth on the premises).&nbsp; <br /><br />Sukkot is Friday October 6 through Friday the 13th (actually, it ends at sundown on the 13th).&nbsp; I would also add that Saturday night the 14th starts Simchat Torah, which is a great excuse for a party (actually, that&#39;s simchat torah&#39;s raison d&#39;etre, if I&#39;m not mistaken).&nbsp; So anyway, that&#39;s a good smattering of weekend and weekday nights that we should be able to make one of them work.<br /><br />Again, I just want to add that while in my original post I said that I was looking for a synagogue or a minyan, which I still am, I would always rather err on the side of social and inclusive rather than religious (if that would make it exclusive).&nbsp; <br /><br />ben

				I would have to check just to make sure but I have an open area at my disposal (a fenced off parking lot that no one currently uses) in front of my building...<br /><br />It could make for a great sukkah space if we opt to build one, people would just have to bring the beach chairs with them for seats :)

				There are some rules about building a Sukkah. as I recall, gee, it has been such a long time for me, the minimum height of the walls should be approximately three feet; the Sukkah must be at least twenty-six inches long and twenty-six inches wide; the walls may not be higher than thirty feet. The material used for building also have some rules: the walls may be made of almost any material, but there must be a roof—a S&#39;khakh or Skhakh—not sure of the spelling. It must be made of organic materials—something that grows from the ground— like branches or I remember a lot of evenly spaced bamboo poles.<br /><br />The thing I remember most vividly are the taffy, candy or caramel apples on a stick. Now, I would probably need permission from my dentist to bite into one!&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br />You know, we could still celebrate the holiday without all the trappings. After all none of us are traditionalists. It would still be fun just to be together to share memories and the joy of being with each other.

				This is awesome.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think the suggestion to get together and build a sukkah is a fantastic idea, and a great way to spend an afternoon (pizza + beer + construction project = fun), provided that Miri is able to get permission.&nbsp; As far as the actual building of the thing goes, I have some experience with this, although in the past I have either built sukkahs from pre-fab kits or from pvc pipes (the thing doesn&#39;t need to be made of wood, just covered with vegetation -- skhakh, as a pervious post rightly said).&nbsp; I am happy to look into the options for this, but the thing that would be essential is a car (a trip would need to be made to -I&#39;m guessing- Long Island or Brooklyn for a kit, or to Home Depot for do-it-yourself building materials), which I don&#39;t have.<br /><br />Now that I think about it, though, the timing of building it would be difficult, since Yom Kippur is on a Monday and Sukkot starts the following Friday night -- that doesn&#39;t leave a convenient day on which to build it.&nbsp; It would be possible to build on a weeknight that week, but only if the lighting situation was such that we could see what what we are doing (and of course, not make too much noise).&nbsp; <br /><br />It may be that this is just too ambitious for now, and it will be best to just try to use a sukkah at the Astoria Center or one of the synagogues in Long Island City, or else just forgo the sukkah entirely and have a dinner at someone&#39;s apartment (in which case I would offer to host such an event).<br /><br />ben

				I too have experience with Sukkah building - whether with PVC pipes or Wood<br />oh, and there is a Home Depot on Northern Blvd (with a nice large parking lot)...<br />anyways, let me first check and see if I get permission. <br />If I don&#39;t have an answer by Friday, can someone among the ACI members ask their permission to &quot;use&quot; the sukkah for an event for a &quot;young&quot; Jewish non-affiliated group in Astoria?<br />I&#39;m just so excited about how people are interested.<br />I am already thinking pomegrenates and other fall harvest fruits of Israel....<br />Anyways, Lorrie, sharing memories as we sit around and eat is definitely a big plus!<br />

				Anyway, I&#39;m really happy that there definitely seems to be a critical mass of people interested in doing something.&nbsp; The potluck Shabbos (+Sukkos?) dinner sounds like a great idea.&nbsp; In case the sukkah thing doesn&#39;t work out (I&#39;m growing very skepitcal about the possibility of building a sukkah on a weeknight in the dark, even though it was my own suggestion), and if there is no other local sukkah we can use, we would be happy to have people over here (we&#39;re near the Ditmars end of things).&nbsp; The only thing is that we moved only last week, and don&#39;t have much in the way of seating -- so if it became clear that too many people are interested (which would frankly be a great thing), we&#39;d have to find another venue (or find a way to bring in some more chairs and a bigger table).&nbsp; The date that works best for us is Friday October 13 (which is techincally when Sukkot ends and Shemini Atzeret begins), so actually that obviates the sukkah problem.<br /><br />In the meantime, it may very well be that the Astoria Center will have Sukkot-related activities (decorating the sukkah, if there is one?).<br /><br />I am looking forward to meeting all of you.<br />ben

				Anyone know the one about the retired moyle and the tailor?<br /><br />In a heavy Yiddish accent (think George Burns and Tevya).<br /><br />SO a retired moyle takes a lifetimes worth of foreskin in a basket to the tailor and says, &quot;tailor, ive been a moyle now for 60 yrs. I&#39;m retired today and Ive brought this to you to make me a special special gift for my retirement.&quot;<br /><br />The tailor looks at the forskin and the old man and says, &quot;come back in a month and I&#39;ll have a beautiful gift for you!&quot;<br /><br />A month goes by and the excited moyle makes his way back to the tailor. &nbsp;&quot;Tailor&quot; he says &quot;what have you made for me?!?!&quot;.<br /><br />Tailor reaches under the counter and pulls out a carved box with gold and silver inlay, he solemnly presents it to the retired old moyle and smiles.<br /><br />The moyle eyes gleaming and moist at such a gift takes it in his shaking hands and opens it. &nbsp;There nestled in a bed of blue satin is a lovely little wallet. &nbsp;The moyle looks at the tailor dissappointed and upset, he says &quot;tailor, whats this? I must have given you 30 lbs of forskin and all you have for me is a wallet?!?!&quot;<br /><br />The tailor smiles and says &quot;yes, but when you rub it, it turns into a steamer trunk!&quot;<br /><br />

This has led me to explain exactly what a gefilte fish is. So once again, here goes.<br /><br />Each year as soon as the frost on the Great Gefilte Lakes (located Upstate New York somewhere in the Catskill Mountains) is thin enough to break the surface, Frum fishermen set out to &quot;catch&quot; gefilte fish. Now unlike your normal fish, gefilte fish cannot be caught with a rod and a reel or your standard bait. The art of catching gefilte fish was handed down for hundreds, maybe thousands of years. For all I know Moses used to go gefilte fish catching. I&#39;m sure that the Great Rambam (Maimonides) when he wasn&#39;t busy playing doctor, spent his leisure time G/F fishing. Enough already, you say, so how is it done? Well you go up to the edge of lake with some Matzoh. Now this is very important!! It has to be Shmurah Matzoh or the fish will not be attracted. You stand at the edge of the lake and whistle and say &quot;here boy,&quot; &quot;here boy.&quot; The fish just can&#39;t resist the smell of the Matzoh. They come en masse to the edge of the lake where they jump into the jars and are bottled on the spot.<br /><br />Again you must remember that there are two kinds of gefilte fish. The strong and the weak. The weak are your standard fish which are in a loose &quot;broth&quot; (it is actually the lake water). Now the strong are special. They seem to be in a &quot;jell&quot;. These fish are actually imported from the Middle East where they are caught in the Dead Sea. They have to be strong to be able to swim through that &quot;jell&quot;.<br /><br />Last year, a well meaning gentleman tried to correct me by stating, &quot;Reb, shouldn&#39;t they be saying &#39;Here Boychic!&#39;&quot; I didn&#39;t have the heart to tell him, Boychic is a Yiddish word and Gefilte Fish don&#39;t understand Yiddish! Only Hebrew and surprisingly, English! There has been a big debate as to whether to use the Hebrew or English in the US. With a big break from tradition, shockingly the English is accepted by almost all G/F fishermen. Some still insist on using the Hebrew and consider the use of &quot;Here Boy&quot; as Reform and not Halachicly acceptable. However the Congress of OU Rabbis (who have to be present at the lakes when the fish are bottled) uniformly accept &quot;here boy&quot;!<br /><br />The time of the catch is very important! The fish cannot be caught before Purim is over or the fish are considered Chametz! Besides, the fish know when Pesach is coming and will not respond to the Matzoh before the proper time. I am still a little bothered by which end of the fish is the head and which the tail (not to mention that I am not sure where their eyes are). This is a small price to pay for the luxury of eating this delicacy.<br /><br />Have you ever had the baby G/F? Oy, they are so cute that I feel a little guilty eating them! Have a great Pesach and hope that the Matzoh doesn&#39;t affect you like Pepto Bismol or worse yet, prunes!

(maybe even the Zohar?&nbsp; I haven&#39;t looked this up).<br /><br />If your Hebrew is good, I would recommend a book called _Malakhei Elyon_ (_Heavenly Angels_) by Reuven Margaliot, which is an anthology of all the passages mentioning particular named angels and demons in classical Jewish literature.&nbsp; He has a 6 pages on Ashmodai just listing the sources from the Talmud, Zohar, etc.&nbsp; If you are more comfortable in English, you might try looking up &quot;demons&quot; or whatever in Encyclopedia Judaica.<br />good luck.<br />b

				back to gefilte fish.&nbsp; I too am scared of the stuff in the jar.&nbsp; I do, however, recommend Unger&#39;s frozen gefilte fish (which Fresh Direct carries, and probably some supermarkets), which is basically a loaf of frozen gefilte that you boil in water and then refrigerate.&nbsp; It&#39;s much better than the jarred stuff (though not as good as your Bubbe&#39;s, obviously).&nbsp; Also, Agata and Valentina on the Upper East Side (79th and 1st) has spectacular gefilte at their smoked fish counter, but it&#39;s a bit expensive ($3.50 a piece, I think), but the pieces are huge (it&#39;s the sweet variety, which I understand is Polish, as opposed to the more Litvak fishy one).&nbsp; I&#39;m guessing Zabar&#39;s/Eli&#39;s would also be good (and expensive), but I&#39;ve never tried it.<br />b

				So this is my first post here, and I must say this thread is quite fascinating. I&#39;ve only been living in Astoria since around June, and have loved the fact that in four months here I&#39;ve only seen 1 yarmulke (kipa, skullcap, religious head-covering, whatever you want to call it) here in all that time. I never imagined that there was a vibrant Jewish crowd here. I moved here after living in Israel for 11 years and while I have nothing against religious people (all my immediate family is religious and we get along fine), I needed to get away from that stuff as much as possible. I come from an Ultra-Orthodox (but not chassidic) background and up until 2 years ago was still religious myself. Anyway, I&#39;m always game to meet new people and would love to get together for any Jewish events devoid of heavy religious content (although I&#39;m always up for a debate about the issues!).<br /><br />Since I don&#39;t frequent the board here that much (last thing I need is another online distraction) is there a way for me to stay up to date with only certain events, namely events related to these sort of get-togethers?<br />

				Looks like I&#39;ve gotta play catch up on this thread.&nbsp; Got a couple of comments:<br /><br />1) Gefilte Fish: An Italian friend of mine (from Italy) had gefilte fish for the first time at a hannukah party at my mom&#39;s.&nbsp; He liked it and said, &quot;it&#39;s basically a fish meatball... not bad.&quot;<br /><br />2) The Kedem winery on the Hudson Valley has some decent kosher wines.&nbsp; Those would be the more expensive ones, not the cheaper ones.&nbsp; When I was in college and VP of the Jewish union, we made a trip there to stock up on wine.

				I was thrilled to discover this thread (though I admit I haven&#39;t read all of it)!<br /><br />I&#39;ve been living in Astoria (Ditmars) for three years and never want to leave, but I&#39;m also in the process of converting to Judaism and not too keen about the religious community in the neighborhood (we also tried ACI and wondered about the phantom synagogue on maps around 23rd Ave, but have ended up attending synagogues on the UWS).<br /><br />My partner and I would be eager to join in any Astoria-based Jewish activity -- be it religious or social in nature.&nbsp; We already hold shabbat dinners on a semi-regular basis for our friends, and I would be glad to open up our home to more people!&nbsp; I also love the idea of a sukkot event.&nbsp; Has a mailing list formed to keep track of what&#39;s going on?<br /><br />Litza<br /><br />PS -- Re: kosher wine -- Both Astor Place and Sherry-Lehman have pretty respectable selections of kosher wine at reasonable prices, and they&#39;ll deliver to Queens for no cost if you spend enough (about a case&#39;s worth, not too bad).&nbsp; Definitely takes the stress out of shopping for wine!

				To my mind, it&#39;s a bit too cynical to talk about the practice of selling High Holiday tickets as a &quot;pay-to-pray&quot; arrangement.&nbsp; Someone needs to maintain the synagogue, pay the rabbi and cantor, buy torah scrolls and prayer books, etc., and the easiest way to get money out of people is to ask for donations on the two days when most Jews actually go to synagogue.&nbsp; And at any rate, I&#39;m certain that if you approach the proper person on the synagogue staff, you could probably get yourself a free ticket (if your refusal to pay is for financial reasons).&nbsp; <br /><br />In an ideal world, I would actually like going to synagogue, and as such I would belong to one and go regularly, and as a member I would either be exempt from having to buy tickets, or if the synagogue still required me to buy tickets, I would try to see it as a necessary fund-raiser for the shul.&nbsp; But this isn&#39;t an ideal world, and I don&#39;t have a real connection to any synagogue on an institutional level, and so the deal seems to be that I have to shell out cash or find some alternative arrangement.&nbsp; It&#39;s sad that those of us who don&#39;t belong to synagogues (either for financial or ideological or social reasons) get screwed, but in my opinion, that&#39;s the price we pay for being on the fringe.&nbsp; The system is not set up for the benefit of people who go to synagogue twice a year (what my childhood rabbi disdainfully called &quot;twice-a-year Jews.&quot;)&nbsp; And in a way that&#39;s fair, because if left to us (not &quot;us&quot; in this thread, but &quot;us&quot; in the wider sense of non shul-goers), synagogues would go the way of the Roman bath-house.<br /><br />All of that being said, it would be totally insane if a ticket-sale policy were in effect at a certain synagogue in a certain neighborhood where there aren&#39;t many Jews, and they can barely get a minyan on Saturday, and they consider it good if they get 100 people on the High Holidays.&nbsp; it would seem that such a synagogue could only gain tremendously by opening its doors to people like us, even for free.<br /><br />One more observation: you can pray any day of the week, including Shabbat - which, by the way, has a greater sanctity than Rosh ha-Shanah - without having to buy tickets from anyone.<br /><br />bennyt

				Not to stray to deep into the topic but I can&#39;t help but feel sometimes that &quot;Pay to Pray&quot; goes deeper than just High Holidays. Even when you are a member of a synagogue, some synagogues are really competitive over who gives the larger donation. It also wasn&#39;t too far back when the sale of aliyot was common practice (for those who don&#39;t know, an aliya is when you read from the torah scroll, the most common aliya l&#39;torah these days is during the bar/bat mitzvah ceremony). The point is that people should feel free to pray whenever and where ever they choose without the pressure to belong to any particular synagogue. Also, it&#39;s my feeling that a Rabbi should also be a teacher, a guide and a leader,&nbsp; and it shouldn&#39;t feel like he/she is a businessperson first in the style of how he/she leads the congregation. Ultimately, people should feel comfortable to be Jewish in what ever way they choose without the pressure of having to belong to any one title.

				true dat, true dat.&nbsp; <br /><br />But just keep in mind that, like it or not, the connection between cash and kavod (=respect, honor) is pretty ingrained in the whole institution of the synagogue.&nbsp; Excavations of ancient synagogues in Israel have yielded inscriptions (often artistic) that describe who donated how much.&nbsp; Even the second Temple had such elements as Nicanor&#39;s Gates (named after the dude who donated them, Nicanor).&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

I really doubt it. Humiliating? Devastatingly so. As a young(er) woman, the Cantor and I would make the rounds of people we had not seen on a regular basis. We used to do this around Pesach. We would drop over bearing (ou)P cakes and fruit and sit and lovingly talk to families, especially widows, until we were able to determine the reason they had not been attending services. When it was discovered that fixed income (loss of a job, loss of a husband, etc.) was their issue, they were given free membership, and all that that entails until things changed. And if it *never* changed, that became a free *lifetime* membership. That&#39;s what being a Jew means to me. Caring more about people, than the crappy things that make up a synagogue. <br /><br />When there was a bazaar, local merchants were contacted and asked for donations of merchandise. Not money! We should have been selling that new merchandise for synagogue goals. But, instead, the affluent members would pick through the (still) ticketed stuff, set it aside to take home, and proceed to put prices on used shmatas for $2-$3. That&#39;s when I started realizing that being a member had benefits that were not becoming. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=3346.msg35018#msg35018">Quote from: bennyt on September 27, 2006, 09:51:36 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">(if your refusal to pay is for financial reasons).</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Refusal?

I really don&#39;t appreciate you telling me about *my* ability to pray. Whether or not you intended it, that line sounds arrogant. Sorta like you might think you are better than me. <br /><br />I learned a long time ago that money doesn&#39;t make the person. Nor does it make a Jew a better Jew. When an elderly neighbor of mine lost her husband and then her only child (who was helping support her) she could no longer afford to be Kosher. Her shame and guilt was overwhelming. A few friends and I tried to pick up the slack, but we were all raising families of our own and the monies we were using to buy her food was being taken out of *our* food budgets. I mentioned this to a co-worker. I had been widowed twice, and was working long hours to make ends meet. My co-worker, who had a brother who was a priest, and a sister who was a cloistered nun, reminded me that G-d and religion is in your heart . . . and that (if there really is a) G-d, he/she knows what is in your heart and I should tell this to my neighbor to help her through the hardest part of her ordeal. I did just that. And, lo-and-behold, she discovered that her $0.59 per pound Perdue oven roaster was just as tasty and filling as her $1.79 per pound Empire Kosher scrawny chickens had been. She prayed every day. She lit her Shabbos candles on time. She became my hero. When Astoria was a smaller, perhaps more caring, Community (with a capital C) donations were collected and I helped bury her in a graveside service, next to her son and her husband, with the help of a Rabbi (from the Bronx) who donated his time.<br /><br />I wasn&#39;t raised in a hypocritical home. We were Kosher. Period. No Chinese restaurants, no eating at affairs that weren&#39;t glatt. Even summer camp was Halakha. <br /><br />Today, I practice *my* Judaism in a way that doesn&#39;t interfere with my ability to pay my rent, my medical insurance and provide me nourishment for both my body and soul. But, I sincerely ache for those who still choose to pray in a shul and are deprived of doing so because they would have to beg for the privilege from a group of obnoxiously arrogant gantser k&#39;nackers.<br /><br />I am so ready . . . bring it on. But remember, judge not ye yest ye be judged.<br /><br />Genug iz genug. It&#39;s time to do things for people—not places.

				yah.&nbsp; Relax.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure what warrants the &quot;bring it on&quot; attitude.&nbsp; Nobody is judging anybody.&nbsp; And I, at least, agree with everything you&#39;ve said, and I also apologize for coming across as arrogant (which was certainly not the intention) - the comment about prayer was intended to be informational, rather than me giving YOU instructions on when and where to pray. What I was and am most concerned with is that people reading this thread don&#39;t come away with the wrong idea, namely that Judaism requires payment for prayer -- that is what was implied in a previous post in which High Holiday tickets were compared to indulgences, and I think that it is extremely important to explain that that is not a valid analogy.&nbsp; But I obviously said all of this in an offensive way, so please accept my apology.<br /><br />I don&#39;t necessarily have the most positive experiences with &quot;organized&quot; Judaism either.&nbsp; And if synagogues leave impoverished Jews out in the cold, that is a terrible, detestable thing, and I&#39;m at least heartened by the fact that these people have such vigorous advocates as yourself.<br /><br />You rightly point out many serious problems with organized Judaism (and religion in general), and I don&#39;t have any answers.&nbsp; All I wanted to do was show that there is a reason behind the sale of High Holiday tickets.&nbsp; Nu, what do you want from my life?!&nbsp; :-)

				When I was a little girl, growing up in Astoria, the Rabbi of Beth El (now defunct) told this story in Sunday school, on the 1st Sunday after the High Holidays:<br /><br />[OT]<br />One Saturday morning, the Rabbi noticed little<br />Tovya standing in the foyer of the Shul staring <br />up at a large plaque.<br /><br />It was covered with names with small American<br />flags mounted on either side of it.<br /><br />The seven year old had been staring at the plaque<br />for some time, so the Rabbi walked up, stood<br />beside the little boy, and said quietly,<br />&quot;Good morning Tovya.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Good morning Rabbi,&quot; he replied, still focused on<br />the plaque.<br /><br />&quot;Rabbi, what is this?&quot; he asked.<br /><br />The Rabbi said, &quot;Well, son, it&#39;s a memorial to all<br />the young men and women who died in the service.&quot;<br /><br />Soberly, they just stood together, staring at the large<br />plaque. Finally, little Tovya&#39;s voice, barely audible and<br />trembling with fear, asked, &quot;Which service, Rabbi,<br />Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur?&quot;<br />[/OT]

				shabbat shalom, everyone<br />here&#39;s my contribution to this thread this week (thanks to recycled email from friends)<br />---------------------------------<br /><br />The Atkins Schmaltz Diet<br /><br />Before we start, there are some variations in ingredients because of<br />the various types of Jewish taste (Polish Litvack and Gallizianer).<br /><br />Just as we Jews have six seasons of the year (winter, spring, summer,<br />fall, the slack season, and the busy season), we all focus on a main<br />ingredient which, unfortunately and undeservedly, has disappeared<br />from our diet. I&#39;m talking, of course, about SCHMALTZ (chicken fat).<br /><br />SCHMALTZ has, for centuries, been the prime ingredient in almost every<br />Jewish dish, and I feel it&#39;s time to revive it to its rightful place in<br />our homes. (I have plans to distribute it in a green glass Gucci bottle<br />with a label clearly saying: &quot;low fat, no cholesterol, Newman&#39;s Choice,<br />extra virgin SCHMALTZ.&quot; (It can&#39;t miss!)<br /><br />Let&#39;s start, of course, with the &quot;forshpeiz&quot; (appetizer). Gehockteh leiber<br />(chopped liver) with SCHMALTZ is always good, but how about something more<br />exotic for your dear ones, like boiled whitefish in yoyech (soup) which<br />sets into a jelly form, or &quot;gefilteh miltz&quot; (stuffed spleen), in which<br />the veins are removed (thank God), and it is fried in (you guessed it)<br />SCHMALTZ, bread crumbs, eggs, onions, salt and pepper.<br /><br />Love it! How about stewed lingen (lungs) - very chewy -- or gehenen (brains)<br />-- very slimy. Am I making your mouth water yet? Then there are (grebenes --<br />pieces of chicken skin, deep fried in SCHMALTZ, onions and salt until crispy<br />brown (Jewish bacon). This makes a great appetizer for the next<br />cardiologist&#39;s convention.<br /><br />Another favorite, and I&#39;m sure your children will love it, is pe&#39;tcha<br />(jellied calves&#39; feet). Simply chop up some cows&#39; feet with your hockmesser<br />(handl-chopper), add some meat, onions, lots of garlic, SCHMALTZ again, salt<br />and pepper, cook for five hours and let it sit overnight. You might want to<br />serve it with oat bran and bananas for an interesting breakfast (just<br />joking).<br /><br />There&#39;s also a nice chicken fricassee (stew) using the heart, gorgle (neck),<br />pipick (a great delicacy, given to the favorite child, usually me), a<br />fleegle (wing) or two, some ayelech (little premature eggs) and other<br />various chicken innards, in a broth of SCHMALTZ, water, paprika, etc.<br /><br />We also have knishes (filled dough) and the eternal question, &quot;Will that be<br />liver, beef or potatoes, or all three?&quot;<br /><br />Other time-tested favorites are kishkeh, and its poor cousin, helzel<br />(chicken or goose neck). Kishkeh is the gut of the cow, bought by the foot<br />at the kosher butcher. It is turned inside out, scalded and scraped. One end<br />is sewn up and a mixture of flour, SCHMALTZ, onions, eggs, salt, pepper,<br />etc., is spooned into the open end and squished down until it is full. The<br />other end is sewn and the whole thing is boiled. Yummy!<br /><br />My personal all-time favorite is watching my Zayda (grandpa) munch on boiled<br />chicken feet. Try that on the kinderlach (children) tomorrow.<br /><br />For our next course we always had chicken soup with pieces of yellow-white,<br />rubbery chicken skin floating in a greasy sea of lokshen (noodles), farfel<br />(broken bits of matzah), arbiss (chickpeas), lima beans, pietrishkeh,<br />tzibbeles (onions), mondlech (soup nuts), kneidlach (dumplings), kasha<br />(buckwheat groats), kliskelech and marech (marrow bones).<br /><br />The main course, as I recall, was either boiled chicken, flanken, kackletten<br />(hockfleish--chopped meat), and sometimes rib steaks, which were served<br />either well done, burned or cremated. Occasionally we had barbecued liver<br />done to a burned and hardened perfection in our own coal furnace.<br /><br />Since we couldn&#39;t have milk with our meat meals, beverages consisted of<br />cheap soda (Kik, Dominion Dry, seltzer in the spritz bottles) or a glezel<br />tay (glass of hot tea) served in a yahrzeit (memorial candle) glass and<br />sucked through a sugar cube held between the incisors.<br /><br />Desserts were probably the only things not made with SCHMALTZ, so we never<br />had any. Momma never learned how to make SCHMALTZ Jell-O.<br /><br />Well, now you know the secret of how I&#39;ve grown up to be so tall, sinewy,<br />slim and trim, energetic, extremely clever and modest, and if you want your<br />children to grow up to be like me, you&#39;re in gohnsen meshuggah (completely<br />nuts)!<br /><br />ZEIT MIR GEZUNT (go in good health)... and order out Chinese

				Hello everyone - I am the Rabbi at Congregation Sons of Israel - 33-21 Crescent - The &quot;Little&quot; Shule.&nbsp; I have been here 26 years.<br />A congregant found this web board and asked me to reply to some of your concerns.&nbsp; There are three synagogues left in LIC and Astoria.&nbsp; All synagogues in the area were at one time Orthodox except for Astoria Center of Israel.&nbsp; Mishkan Israel (defunct), Beth-El (defunct), and Beth Jacob (defunct) all fell into Sons of Israel.&nbsp; The only other synagogue left is Adath Israel which recently sold its building and will be joining Sons of Israel after renovations are complete.&nbsp; (If any of you have talents in colors and matching flooring and paneling, etc, please get in touch with us).<br />Our synagogue stopped selling Aliyot (We only did it on the High Holy Days because there were so many people that it was the only way to determine who wanted and respected the honor the most) years ago.&nbsp; I stopped it because people were offering $10.00 and 18.00 to be called up to the Torah which I thought was embarrassing to the Torah.&nbsp; Now, Aliyot are given out to the most active people and regular daveners.<br />We have an interesting mix of Congregants.&nbsp; More of the congregation is young now than old.&nbsp; We have Mexican Jews, Morranos, Puerto Rican Jews, Texan, Guatemalan, and Filipinos.&nbsp; We had a young man from Tenn who just made Aliyah to Neve Tzuf with his Filipino wife.<br />These are really great people and lots of fun.&nbsp; We have lunch together every Shabbat and some people stay to schmooze as late as 3:00 - 4:00 in the afternoon.<br />Dues are $100.00 a year but people pay what they can.&nbsp; If you cannot pay - no one here will ask you for money or tell you that you cannot daven.&nbsp; A young lady, who owns ERETZ foods on Columbus and 93rd in Manhattan supplies the food for Shabbat.&nbsp; We have a kiddush fund and we try to pay her out of that but I think she takes a loss every week.&nbsp; She is extremely generous.&nbsp; If you stop by her store - ask for Yaela and you can meet her.<br />I don&#39;t know why the word &quot;Orthodox&quot; scares away so many people.&nbsp; It&#39;s not a dirty word.&nbsp; We call ourselves traditional.&nbsp; Everyone is welcome to come.&nbsp; Last week a young couple came by and wanted to sit together.&nbsp; We gave them two seats just where the mechitza ends so that they would be right next to each other.&nbsp; I would say that most of the people in the Synagogue are working towards becoming more observant but have not found their way yet.&nbsp; A lot of them become more observant as times passes by.&nbsp; You will find that you do not have to be a Sabbath observer or always eat kosher to be welcome in this Synagogue.<br />We have a large Sukkah which gets filled pretty much all the time.<br />Why don&#39;t some of you come this Friday night for the last meal in the Sukkah.&nbsp; Meet the people and enjoy a quiet evening.&nbsp; Looking forward to seeing you.<br />If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.<br />Rabbi Jay

				So good to see some Jews in the hood.&nbsp; <br /><br />I wish there was a bit more of a presence in the area.&nbsp; Maybe Chanukah is a proper time to start showing that we are here with Menorah in our windows.<br /><br />Although, in the past, I have been a bit hesitant to do it.

				Hey guys,<br /><br />I&#39;ve met some of you before, but if not, hello! I&#39;m a very active member at ACI (synagogue in Astoria) and, since I&#39;m a graphic designer by trade, involved in lots of their marketing. So I finally added the Chanukah party (RSVP is by this Friday, but it&#39;s on the 17th) and a Potluck dinner (this Friday) up on Astorians if you&#39;d like to check it out. <br /><br />They&#39;re both in the Community Calendar area: http://www.astorians.com/index.php?board=2.0 (http://www.astorians.com/index.php?board=2.0) . <br /><br />Hope you can join us! Also, feel free to contact me via Astorians or by emailing the shul directly (info@astoriacenterofisrael.org) if you have questions about ACI. <br /><br />Best, Teresa

				I totally would be interested in seeing some young Jewish activity in Astoria, but sometimes I feel like the only Jew around.&nbsp; Good to know there are others out there.&nbsp; I tried to buy Kosher wine to take to a friend&#039;s Shabbat dinner on the UWS a few months ago at the wine store on Bdway and 34th or 35th and the guy sort of just laughed.&nbsp; He said to try the big store on 30th ave.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t find Matzoh (or any other Jewish food) during passover.&nbsp; Any good grocery stores for that sort of thing?&nbsp; <br /><br />I tried this: http://berniesservices.org/ for free services.&nbsp; It&#039;s in a church on 51st and park, and they ask you to &quot;send it a donation&quot; after and just bring an ID for security purposes.&nbsp; It&#039;s a typical Reform service, with a really good choir and a rabbi.&nbsp; Very much like the congregation I grew up at a few states away.&nbsp; There are a lot of older people, so it&#039;s not younger, but it worked. They even do Kol Nidre with a cello if you&#039;re used to that.&nbsp; I would recommend it if you&#039;re looking for a free, Reform experience in the city (not so far from Astoria).

				We went to the Astoria Center for Israel for Rosh Hashanah, and will be going back on Friday. It is a little desolate, but it&#039;s our local synagogue, and the only way to make it better is to go... <br /><br />and the building is absolutely gorgeous and I am terrified that someone will come along ant turn it into condos!<br /><br />As for the kosher wine... I saw kosher portugese wine (!) at Grand Wine &amp; Liquor on 30th the weekend, so it is out there.
