				Hey there,<br /><br />I&#039;m new to Astorians.com (not new to Astoria itself), so I&#039;m saying hi. <br /><br />And...<br /><br />Does anyone remember that awesome French place that was on Broadway near 44th St, called Le Sans Souci? I was cleaning out my old menus the other day and came across it.&nbsp; I got a bit misty for their salmon and wilted spinach and for their brunch crepes.&nbsp; I keep hoping I&#039;ll hear about them popping up somewhere else but no luck thus far. <br /><br />

				Unfortunately, Le Sans Souci closed &#039;bout 2 years ago. There&#039;s a Middle Eastern/Med place that replaced it, but I haven&#039;t been in a while. I think since they&#039;ve opened they&#039;ve tweaked their menu SEVERAL times and I hardly ever see customers there. It&#039;s more of an American menu with some middle eastern food thrown in. Had great hopes for this place as the owner talked it up about it offering fish. I don&#039;t think they ever really advertised the place and so...it&#039;s just still there. If anyone is ever adventurous to go (they also do a brunch, I believe) please post back here.<br />
