				Does anyone else think we are in desperate need of a crosswalk somewhere between the Ditmars subway exits and Ditmars Blvd? People are crossing that stretch of 31st all the time going back and forth to the businesses and it just seems a matter of time before something bad happens. I know you should go to the corners and cross, but they are far apart and there are so many different businesses as well as the subways in that one area.<br /><br />There are especially so many elderly people who can&#39;t walk much/quickly, and I think that it would be very helpful to them.<br /><br />Does anyone know who to contact about this?<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Teresa<br />

				I totally agree - I personally am not a big fan of jay-walking, but do it on occasion in that specific area. Of course, this probably wouldn&#39;t help as there are moron drivers who still think a red light means go. Too bad they didn&#39;t learn their colors in kindergarten.

				311 maybe?<br />i used to repeatedly call about changing a stop sign on 46th and newtown to a light b/c cars come careening down and there&#39;s a hill making it a blindspot for pedestrians. i had some close calls there. i had moved, and nothing changed, but on a random walk through the old haunts, i do believe i saw my traffic light.<br />&nbsp;:-D

				Definitely. As a pedestrian, I too am guilty of jaywalking ... as a driver, the jaywalkers scare me to death because there&#39;s so much activity with cars pulling out, double-parked, and pillars that limit view. So I try to avoid driving down 31st whenever possible now. I&#39;m afraid one of these days I&#39;m simply going to react too slowly or not see someone in time.
