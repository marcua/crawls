				Has anyone gone to this resturant? My girlfriend and I just moved to Astoria in December, so we are still exploring. Since Cinema Paradiso is one of her favorite movies and it is our 5 year anniversary, I thought I would take her there. Any advice?

				My husband and I had dinner there before seeing a movie, and since it wasn&#039;t too crowded we thought an hour would be enough time to eat before our show. <br /><br />We were wrong. The service was slow, we had to ask/remind the waiter to bring us water, our bread, and our drinks. The salad I ordered mentioned olives on the menu; when my salad showed up without olives and I asked for some on the side, they tried to charge me extra; overall the food was mediocre at best. And expensive!<br /><br />The manager apologized to us on several occasions and chewed out the waiter in our presence, but the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth.

				Iv&#039;e tried this place 3 times before giving up on it entirely.&nbsp; The food is edible but not so good and the service is pretty horrible.&nbsp; It&#039;s also so bright in there it&#039;s hard to unwind.&nbsp; i&#039;m always looking for a great place to go have dinner but this is definitely not the place.

				I actually went to this place for the first time on saturday, the food wasn&#039;t anything special, but I wouldn&#039;t not go there again. The waiter I had was pretty attentive, tho I didn&#039;t understand the decor. They went to the trouble of putting up fake balconies but they couldn&#039;t finish the floor? I don&#039;t know if they were <em>trying</em> to keep a semi-industrial look with the warehouse-esque floor and the unconcealed ducts in the ceiling, but why they would do such a thing is beyond me. but i complain about the floor in old navy so maybe it&#039;s just me. However they had a very talented lounge singer. with very unnecessary amplification. <br /><br />my overall opinon: eh..

				Closed.<br /><br />They had a sign up for a few weeks indicating they&#039;d gone on vacation - now the space is for rent.<br /><br />Not a huge loss.&nbsp; Hopefully it will be replaced with something better.
