				&quot;We pay between $1-$4/item. We PROMISE to make you an offer for your WHOLE collection – everything you have.<br />Our offer usually averages out to between $1 and $4 per item, provided you have all the cover art and the item is in good-to-excellent condition. We pay less for scratched CD’s and if the jewel case is badly damaged. We also pay less for hip-hop and R&amp;B. We pay more for rare Jazz and box sets.We accept all genres, i.e. classical music, opera, jazz, classic rock, latin, pop, indie, alternative, trance, books on CD, spoken word, etc. . As seen in the press (Time Out, Ny Times). <br /><br /><br />We understand that this offer sounds “too good to be true.” Therefore, we can provide you with a list of references and press clippings.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />You can also stop by at our NYC location. <br /><br /><br />All CD’s have to come with the booklet in the front of the jewel case and the playlist in the back of the jewel case. <br /><br />You will need at least 99CD’s to participate in this offer. <br /><br /><br /><br />Which CD’s are eligible for the CD’s-for-Ipod-exchange? We accept most CD’s. We won’t cherry pick your inventory leaving you with ones you cannot sell elsewhere. All CD’s have to be in excellent condition, i.e. without scratches.&nbsp; &nbsp;We might accept a couple of CD’s with minimal scratches.Turn around is approximately thirty minutes (drop off) or one business day (mail in). <br /><br />We buy your whole CD collection for top dollars (cash, money order, or paypal). <br /><br /><br />Small cracks on the CD cases are not a problem. <br /><br /><br />No CD&#039;s with initials or markings, please! <br /><br /><br />We don’t accept CD’s which are stamped “Promotional” on the CD or which have a sticker or stamp on the jacket. We do accept CD’s that have the bar cut scratched out or punched out, which have drilled through jewel cases, or which have promo stickers on the jewel case itself.
