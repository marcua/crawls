				It was around 10:30 last night on the N train and on the other side of the car I was on a woman started screaming &quot;Are you crazy?&quot;, and it seemed like a fight was breaking out that ended up spilling into the 30th Av. platform.&nbsp; Suddenly everyone started covering their faces and rushing to my side of the car and crossing to the next car.&nbsp; My first thought was that someone puked or farted, but people&#039;s reactions were too extreme, maybe someone sprayed something.&nbsp; I moved to the next car too worried about what was going on, but trying to listen on people&#039;s conversations couldn&#039;t figure out what happened.&nbsp; Does anyone here know?

				Dear god why didnt you ask what happened?<br /><br />aside from the less than likely more terrifying prospect that someone sprayed some toxin, maybe someone sprayed mace. <br /><br />

				sounds like somebody got maced.&nbsp; a can of mace is really the best defense anyone can have.&nbsp; take away someone sight and replace it with a burning sensation, and its guaranteed to stop them dead in their tracks, even if you your a 5&#039; 90lb girl and they are 6&#039;6&quot; 300lbs....

				Ever since the string of rapes and sexual assaults going on in the area, I walk with pepperspray every time I walk home. If its late, and I have to walk home I literally have it out and ready. <br /><br />Sad we have to live that way, but if someone was coming at me on the subway I would not hesitate to use it.

				A so-called &quot;string of rapes&quot; is statistically dubious, at best. Certainly, rape (and it&#039;s almost always violence towards women by a known person) is constantly a danger in our society, and it&#039;s unfortunate that more is not done to deter and educate about such problems. However, to broadly claim that there has suddenly been a spike in this behavior is (I think) unfounded. Such crimes easily become headline fodder for the tabloid &quot;papers.&quot; It&#039;s best to be safe -- try to commute/come home with friends, take a cab if you need, and always be aware of one&#039;s surroundings.<br /><br />
