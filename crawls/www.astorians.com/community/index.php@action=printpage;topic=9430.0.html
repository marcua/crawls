				What is up Astoria. I am a motion graphics artist working in midtown and I just moved out here to Astoria last weekend. I am just wondering how many other motion graphics artists live in Astoria. And if anyone would like to get together and discuss design, workflow, techniques, favorite studios, and whatnot. Let me know that I am not alone.

				You&#039;re definitely not alone!&nbsp; And really, who can afford Manhattan on an animator&#039;s salary?&nbsp; I am an Animator, and have done a lot of work for preschool television throughout the years.&nbsp; Most of my work is done in 2D, working traditionally, or in After Effects or Flash.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived in Astoria since graduating college in &#039;98.&nbsp; Lately, I&#039;ve been teaching myself more about flash actionscript and game design.

				Good to see another animator in the neighborhood. Although my traditional animation is pretty weak. I tend to stick to 3D software and After Effects. I checked out your reel and I was impressed. Have you been animating professionally since you graduated?

				Thanks!&nbsp; I spent 7 wonderful years working on Blues Clues right after graduation, which is very much an anomaly in animation.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how similar motion graphics is to character animation, but the majority of work is freelance and you&#039;re lucky if it lasts 6 months!&nbsp; Animation is very much a labor of love&nbsp; :)

				I was doing some freelance 3D work while I was in college and it was the same way. Tough to find consistant work. Also freelancing as a student I couldn&#039;t charge the rates I would have liked so I got sick of freelance work and looked for a full time job when I graduated. I found one with a company that seems like they want to keep me around for a while, which is nice. It is mainly motion graphics work but every once and a while I get to do some 3D character work which I love. I actually went to school fo 3D animation and not motion graphics but the principles trasfer over very easily and I enjoy the work.

				Hey Dan<br /><br />That is awesome that you work at Blue Sky! We should definitely get together some time and talk. <br /><br />What software do you write shaders for? How long have you been at Blue Sky? Do you have a portfolio website up anywhere? <br /><br />I was much more of a 3d graphics guy in college. My interest was in character animation. After I graduated I ended up with a job more centered around motion graphics so I ended up learning a lot of after effects. I still get to use Maya quite a bit but the character work isn&#039;t very frequent. <br /><br />-Mike

				&nbsp; We write shaders in Maya and compile them for our proprietary renderer, CGI Studio.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been at Blue Sky for 5 years.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have a portfolio web site.&nbsp; I plan to put together a show reel some time soon.<br />&nbsp; Our studio uses Maya for just about everything that doesn&#039;t involve rendering.

That was the least crowded meeting I have been to in the last 5 meetings. Usually there are so many people that they stand out in the lobby area and try to peek in through the door. It does suck that they will be getting rid of the free food, but honestly, the pizza is sub par. Last time I went to a street cart outside for food and just brought it in with me.

				I just realized that the Vice Presidential debate is on at 9pm tomorrow and I need to watch it.&nbsp; That&#039;s enough time to have a couple beers if you still want to meet up but I guess I&#039;ll be leaving after just one hour.&nbsp; There&#039;s a possibility I&#039;ll want to come back to the beer garden after the debate too.

				Yeah, I know, darn.&nbsp; Maybe we want to meet up at Bungalo instead?&nbsp; They will be showing the debate at 9pm.&nbsp; See here: http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=12425.msg153092#msg153092<br /><br />I can meet up earlier than 8pm if anyone wants to meet at 7pm.&nbsp; This way we can chat before the debate starts at 9pm.&nbsp; Would that be cool?
