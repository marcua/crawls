				I&#039;m the mom to a 7 week old baby and I&#039;m looking for activities for both of us that take place on Saturday or Sunday mornings.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done some digging around and found a Mommy and baby yoga class at the Yoga Room and the Aardvark music class but both are during the week.&nbsp; By the time Ryan is old enough to benefit from that kind of stimulation, I&#039;ll be back at work full time.&nbsp; Any suggestions?<br /><br />PS - I signed up for the meetup group but again, not sure how much I can participate if all the events are during the week.

				organized weekend stuff once your baby is a little older---<br />it will be tough in Astoria-- other than music for aarvarks and the yoga room- which have both offered to have saturday classes if enough people wanted it.&nbsp; You could ask now if it might be possible in a few months to have that option.<br /><br />do you have a car?<br />you could drive to fresh meadows: my gym? http://www.my-gym.com/franchisee.asp?gymid=293 (http://www.my-gym.com/franchisee.asp?gymid=293)<br />swim classes at the Y in Sunnyside?<br /><br />for meetup-- we could have a standing weekend playdate easily-- you ask for it and it will happen. I bet that if someone suggests it others will want to go.&nbsp; We could rotate where it would be.... The only reason that there isn&#039;t one on the calendar now is that no one has asked for it recently......<br /><br />

				Young babies benefit from time spent with their loving parents....why the need for an outside&nbsp; activity for a 7 week old infant ? Plenty of time for that when they are older.

				I respectfully disagree!&nbsp; Once a parent feels comfortable meeting indoors with other parents and kids (some parents/kids are worried about germs and very young babies, for instance), it&#039;s time to get out!<br /><br />Good for the parents AND the babies!&nbsp; Good for bonding, too......<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t want to speak for anyone else, but I will say that the classes that were discussed so far here (parent and baby at the yoga room, music for aardvarks) could be attended by moms with young babies.&nbsp; The classes at &quot;my gym&quot; are for slightly older kids.<br /><br />Parents need opportunities to socialize, too!&nbsp; The classes are an opportunity to bond in a different way with your child, as well as to meet other parents of young babies/kids.<br /><br />I had a new baby, no family near by, few friends with young kids, and was home not working for the first time in my adult life.......I needed to get out so I signed up for mom/baby yoga class in Williamsburg when my son was about 2 months or 3 months old.&nbsp; It was great!&nbsp; I got to exercise, and got a chance to talk to other people going through the same thing that I was going through, and got to bond in a very fun and loving way with my baby.<br /><br />If the weather is good, it&#039;s nice to find another parent to go on a stroller/carrier walk with when the babies are young.......<br /><br />If I stayed in my house alone with a tiny infant, I would have gone crazy!<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Wow Kathy, I sure hope you&#039;re not suggesting I&#039;m not a loving parent because I want to find activities for my son and I to do together on the weekends once I&#039;m back at work.&nbsp; That would be incredibly ignorant and judgmental on your part so I&#039;m gonna say that wasn&#039;t your intent and save you the trouble of explaining yourself.&nbsp; Good day.<br /><br />Sarah, thanks for the responses.&nbsp; I&#039;m in the same boat.&nbsp; No family or friends near by and I&#039;m on maternity until 10/6.&nbsp; I&#039;m actually loving that it&#039;s just me and him right now since I know the time is limited.&nbsp; We go on walks and play at home but once I go back to work and he&#039;s in daycare, I&#039;ll need indoor activities.&nbsp; Can&#039;t stay home every weekend!&nbsp; I&#039;ll contact the Yoga Room and Aardvarks about trying to setup a weekend series... that&#039;s a good idea.&nbsp; Maybe I can get something going!<br /><br />PS - I requested membership into the Meetup group but I never heard back.&nbsp; The page said the group wasn&#039;t accepting new members but I tried to apply anyway.&nbsp; Do you know more about whether or not they&#039;re accepting new members?

				Hello,<br /><br />I just wanted to reply regarding weekend classes.&nbsp; This is something I&#039;m working on.&nbsp; The issue thus far is that many of the spaces I rent from during the week use their space for their own activities on the weekends.&nbsp; I&#039;m working on one possibility, but am open to suggestions if anyone knows of a space that&#039;s idle on Saturday or Sunday mornings and might want a renter.&nbsp; I realize there&#039;s a real need for family activities on the weekend and am hoping I&#039;ll be able to offer something soon.<br /><br />Best,<br />Allison<br />http://www.musicforqueens.com

				I have a new baby and have been out of the house with her since she was 2 weeks old...and I&#039;m a very loving if not doting mother but I do want her exposed to everything. As a result, at four months she does not freak out at the overhead train or other noises (like the freaking motorcycles) and I appreciate it!<br /><br />If you are outgoing, I find that taking a stroll to astoria park is a pretty easy way to meet other moms and babies. and as the fall starts up, it will be more younger babies and an easy way to get together without too many older children running around.<br /><br />The meetup group at the Freeze Peach isn&#039;t accepting new members, but they are taking pop-ins so that might be a good way to meet some people during the week. I&quot;m going to try and get there as well this week. <br /><br />I completely agree with the need to get out. Doesn&#039;t mean you love your baby any less...if anything, you want to show him off!

				Koko, I admire your motivation and planning.&nbsp; Good for you.&nbsp; We have a two week old at home and took our first big stroll today. Felt good to get out with another couple and baby for a while. I will pass your post on to my wife and maybe we will see you soon.

				Hey Kokowillis (and all other new moms) <br /><br />There&#039;s a new moms meetup this Tuesday 11:30 - 2ish... at Sai&#039;s organics on the cafe side (the one by 31st St).&nbsp; There&#039;s another group that meets sporadically - at Ave Cafe&nbsp; on Mondays (I think) at 11 or 11:30.&nbsp; <br /><br />How long before you have to head back to work? <br /><br /><br />Hope to see you out and about<br /><br />Jen <br />

				Thanks Jen... both are super close to my apartment so maybe I can make one or both this week.&nbsp; How old is your little one?&nbsp; Ryan will be 9 weeks tomorrow and I go back to work on 10/6.&nbsp; I&#039;m dreading it... I think I forgot how to do my job!<br /><br />Oh and I took him on the subway when he was 2 1/2 weeks old and he&#039;s been in taxi cabs too.&nbsp; I don&#039;t believe in keeping babies in a bubble... obviously!&nbsp; Besides, he&#039;ll be exposed to every germ under the sun once he&#039;s in daycare so there&#039;s really no point.

				Yes - Leo has finally made his appearance.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t announce him.&nbsp; But he was announced (by his dad) in the Hello thread: <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=516.msg148283.html#msg148283">Quote from: Little Leo on August 27, 2008, 08:18:55 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hi everybody!&nbsp; New to the neighborhood, mom and dad say it&#039;s awesome!&nbsp; Looking forward to getting out and about as soon as my stroller arrives. I hear the Beer garden can be a blast and that Grand cafe is great for people watching.&nbsp; Are there any good book stores around here?&nbsp; If you see me around please stop by, hang out and say hi, I won&#039;t understand you but that&#039;s ok.<br /><br />Likes: Looking up at people&#039;s nose hair, soft furry things, mommy, burping, napping, girls, hanging out with friends.<br />Dislikes: Poopies, people not paying enough attention to me, scary things, enunciating, the economy.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I was induced Aug 21 - he was born (c-section) Aug 23.&nbsp; We&#039;re all healthy and happy and trying to get some sleep.&nbsp; But definitely wanting to meet-up with other new (and newish) moms in the neighborhood.<br /><br />

				Congratulations on the birth of your baby!&nbsp; Isn&#039;t it hard to find out what&#039;s going on in Astoria when you&#039;re a new parent?&nbsp; Best of luck as you figure out your new life.&nbsp; <br />The meetup group does try to have weekend events for working parents.&nbsp; They are very flexible about creating any events you may suggest (especially if you host something at your house or you suggest a venue).&nbsp; &nbsp;Now that the weather is good I also encourage that you chat up all the parents at the playground, you&#039;ll find they are generally friendly and resourceful.&nbsp; Also there is a new website called astoriafamilies.org&nbsp; It has only just been launched and has almost 50 families on it.&nbsp; I would post on the forums there what you are looking for and see if you have any replies.&nbsp; I&#039;d give that website a little time while people join so that it can work as a resource for you.<br />best of luck<br />
