				Hallo-<br /><br />I&#039;m moving from one place in Astoria to another.&nbsp; Can somebody recommend good movers?&nbsp; As of right now, I&#039;m doing it with the uhaul for money&#039;s sake, but if I get a good, cheap rec, I would reconsider for the ease.&nbsp; Also, it would need to be people who work well on short notice, since I plan on moving this Sat.&nbsp; Any recs are appreciated!&nbsp; Thanks.<br /><br />Also, a public thank you to Handyman, who will be helping me take down a larger item if I decide to stick with the uhaul.&nbsp; He is the man.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)

				Are movers usually good about being kinda careful with stuff? I&#039;m debating hiring people, but part of my hesitation is that I&#039;d rather not have to worry about my bed or desk or other things that don&#039;t fit in boxes getting scratched.

				yeah, they are pretty good. i was worried about my TV, it&#039;s big and older. i even inquired about insurance but they didn&#039;t offer it, which only worried me more.<br /><br />but they were real good about it. if you&#039;re worried about something, just let them know. they&#039;ll take their time with it.<br /><br />a short chair leg popped off during one of my friend&#039;s moves. they came back the next day to repair it.

				We got these guys off a random flyer in the neighborhood, but it worked!<br />Moving Guy Steve:<br />19176866018<br />$75 per guy per hour.<br />They moved both of us into our current apartment from each of our own and also moved some materials for John to a job before we had the car. Steve&#039;s brother supervised all three jobs and he was great. Just tell him what needs to be handled with care and how and in my case he moved those specific items himself.<br />Steve himself supervised my friend&#039;s recent move (actually she&#039;s a board member) and she was satisfied with the results. <br /><br />Good Luck with the move!

				I just hired Rabbit Movers. They gave me a good deal. They considered my move a &quot;studio&quot; apartment move (even tho I have a 1 bedrm, not taking too much furniture with me). <br /><br />Cargo Van, 2 guys, $90/hr. They estimate my move to be 3-5 hours. <br /><br />Definitely worth the money for me since I&#039;m moving into a 5th floor walkup!

				3 guys total for a local move. Don&#039;t know if the rate differs if they are going further. Seems that the guys that come vary with each move. But either Steve or his brother supervise. What I did was, point out to George (Steve&#039;s bro) what I needed to be moved carefully-ie my computer etc and he made sure he was the one to move those boxes himself.<br />They are pretty good. John used them, his former roommate used them, then got them for me, he used them again, I just recommeded to a friend who moved a few months ago and she in turn recommended to someone else we know. <br />Seems like I&#039;m a shill for them but they&#039;re pretty good.<br />And, apparantly Steve himself is a funny dude.

				Here&#039;s the sit.: I&#039;m moving from a one bedroom to another 1 bedroom; a few blocks away in Astoria. I have several big pieces of furniture - queen size bed, 3 cushion couch, standard stuff- and I will have boxes of books and other misc items. (I do plan on moving the smaller items myself so that will change the rates)<br /><br />After contacting a bunch of people, here are my experiences so far:&nbsp; <br /><br />1. Shea Moving- they do seem super nice, but a big concern is that they do NOT use plastic wrap for furniture. They reuse blankets for all moves. You can buy their &quot;paper&quot; wraps for $2.95 a sheet though. They say they fumigate their trucks on a regular basis. I&#039;m just concerned with bed bugs here, people. They cannot reassemble couches, but recommended &quot;New York Couch Doctors&quot; 516-328-8234 (of course that would be an additional cost.) Don&#039;t have an estimate from them yet. A bonus is that they will actually come to my apartment pre-move to do an estimate. Apparently most moving companies should offer the option for an in house estimate, but for smaller jobs like mine it&#039;s not always necessary.<br /><br />2. moving748@hotmail.com / 718-569-2089<br />If you&#039;re on a budget, these guys seem to be the cheapest I&#039;ve found. Very no frills, no nonsense. Flat rate $60/hour, two hour minimum, with two guys. They are not insured. They can disassemble and reassemble furniture if need be, and they also use plastic wraps. <br /><br />3. Rabbit Moving was pricier than expected at $120/hour for 3 guys, plus a travel fee of $60. Considering the short distance of the move, that seemed a bit pricey. But they are insured, and they do use plastic wrap. They said it would be a 4-6 hour job (though I doubt it would be)<br /><br />4. Based on all my considerations, my favorite so far is Schleppers.com. 212-223-4004 Spoke to a great guy named Art Garfink, totally upfront with me, no bs. They also offer 15% discounts on certain days. (check their website) All inclusive with travel time and for an estimated 3-3.5 hour job, using 3 guys, (Rabbit quoted this as a 4-6 hour job) they said $428 for the whole thing.&nbsp; They are insured as well. And he kept giving me tips to save time/money. They&#039;ve been around since 1978. <br /><br />5. Oz http://www.ozmoving.com/ seemed like nice folks but they were not cheap. for a 4.5 hour job (plus one hour travel time) with 3 guys, they estimated $770 ($655 with discount) They are insured, but also seemed a bit pushy. <br /><br />Everyone say &quot;thanks Clarusha&quot; for all the work I saved them.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Seriously, Clarusha, thanks. I&#039;m moving Aug 31 and my primary concern is the bed bugs.<br /><br />I have a question, since you seem to know so much about this stuff!!<br /><br />I was thinking about going with #2. The lack of insurance--what does this mean for me? Obviously, shiat happens and there&#039;s a risk that something might get damaged, but if I was going with a company that had insurance, do I have to pay extra fees for that or is it part of the more expensive prices?

				Actually, I just talked to Steve, and the rate is $75 for 2 men and the truck per hour, or $100 per hour for the three men and the truck. Basically its $25 per man and $25 for the truck per hour. No travel time within Astoria. They will charge for travel time, if your moving out of Astoria, since they are based here in Astoria. <br /><br />

				I used Divine Moving when moving from Rego Park to Manhattan years ago. We moved from a 2nd story house (2 bdrm with tons of junk) to a 5th and 6th floor duplex WALKUP in Manhattan.&nbsp; The guys were great. I think it was 900 something but keep in mind there were 2 of us, and it took them a long time and driving time from Rego Park to Manhattan took awhile. They actually had to wrap up some stuff that we had neglected to do and it was like insane how fast they could tape something up.&nbsp; The guys were nice too. I would totally recommend them. You could always call for a quote I am sure a local move with one person would be way cheaper.<br />Here&#039;s a review on them.<br />http://www.yelp.com/biz/divine-moving-and-storage-new-york-2<br />The guys were hot too ;)<br /><br />On another note, I used Moishes another time and they were horrible; this was a 3 block move that took 7-8 hours and we didnt have alot of furniture. They took tons of breaks, the guys were rude, one showed up DRUNK (not hungover from the night before- STILL DRUNK), and the price was WAY more than we were quoted. Oh yeh, and they broke the martini glasses that my roommate got for Christmas. Nice.
