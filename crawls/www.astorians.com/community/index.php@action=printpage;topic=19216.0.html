				It doesn&#039;t look like she broke the rules of Congress. That&#039;s why just about every member of Congress (including our own) should lose their job.&nbsp; Who knew? Members of a caucus can set up a foundation for scholarships for those who live in the caucus members&#039; district, and then jack up people who want political favors for cash. Does anyone really believe that this s___ is going to be fixed?<br />Fire them all.

				I&#039;m curious&nbsp; about how these members of her family knew to apply for a scholarship.....I can&#039;t imagine this as being totally blind......<br /><br />I can understand her wanting to help......but I don&#039;t think the application was that accidental.
