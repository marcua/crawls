			<strong>Dance Entropy</strong>:
			<br />
			&nbsp;Danspace Project presents Valerie Green/Dance Entropy performing Impermanent Landscape<br />&nbsp;<br />June 1st – 3rd, 2017 at 8pm<br />St Mark’s Church, 131 East 10th St, New York, 10003<br />&nbsp;<br />Impermanent Landscape, choreographed by Valerie Green, is inspired by the ideas of cubism, perspective, perception, and impermanence. Breaking the fourth wall and moving choreography outside of the traditional stage and audience formats, Impermanent Landscape features the geometry and architecture of overlapping bodies, creating its own personal landscape.&nbsp; Music by Martyn Axe creates a sonic terrain highlighted by sound sensors triggered by a live video feed.<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Impermanent Landscape has a mysterious, churning-liquid feel...and keeps the audience curious from start to finish.&quot; - Quinn Batson, OffOffOff<br />&nbsp;<br />“Unexpectedly, architectural… the work’s three-dimensionality, in the way it relates equally to each surface of empty space as it does the floor, in how the shapes and movements cycle through emotions slowly and with the subtlety that marks any wonderful piece of architecture.” - Courtney Escoyne, Stewardship Report<br />&nbsp;<br />Choreography by Valerie Green<br />Performed by Emily Aiken, Caitlyn Casson, Erin Giordano, Frank Leone, Kristin Licata, Jonathan Matthews, Richard J. Scandola, and Hana Ginsburg Tirosh<br />Music by Martyn Axe<br />Text by Stephanie Davis<br />Visual Art by Priscilla Stadler<br />Lighting Design by Joe Levasseur<br /><br />Admission:<br />Advance Tickets: $22 General / $15 Members<br />Tickets can be purchased at the door for $25 (Cash or check only), pending availability.<br /><br />Box Office: (866) 811-4111, www.DancespaceProject.org<br /><br />For more information, please visit: www.danspaceproject.org/calendar/community-access-valerie-green  <br />&nbsp;
