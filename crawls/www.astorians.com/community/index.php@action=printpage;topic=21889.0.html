				Does anyone know what&#039;s going on at the farmers market on 33rd and Ditmars? Walked by today and there were poster boards with CLOSED written on them and a notice from the NYPD. I&#039;m curious as to what happened...

				Last night I walked past the Astoria Farmers Market on Ditmars and noticed that there wasn&#039;t any fruit or vegetables outside and then I saw signs posted on the door saying they were closed and the store was under Legal Possession by the Marshal or Landlord.&nbsp; I was kind of shocked to see this.&nbsp; The lights were on inside and all of the food was in there.&nbsp; I hope this places opens up again. :sad:

				I really miss Top Tomato.&nbsp; I think the produce and fruit is lousy at this place.&nbsp; And it did appear to be a shady operation.&nbsp; I admit this is a harsh and baseless statement, but it&#039;s the gut feeling I got the few times I was there.&nbsp; Then I just never went back.&nbsp; This does not surprise me at all.

				I didnt&#039; get the impression that it was a shady place and I think the fruit and vegetables are better quality than Top Tomato.&nbsp; I never liked Top Tomato.&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s true that they weren&#039;t paying their rent.

				Yeah, I noticed last night it was chained up. I liked it better than Top Tomato, they had more grocery related items.&nbsp; Wonder what will happen to it now...

				It&#039;s funny how some people think this place has/had better produce than Top Tomato, because I think it&#039;s the opposite. How does that happen? To me the produce here is worse than Trade Fair&#039;s and pretty much on the same level as Greenline Organics (who I always want to have nice produce but so much of it just looks awful) and that place under the subway stairs. All these places feel filthy to me. I don&#039;t think I&#039;m that picky, but it would make a big difference if these places took out the rotting/moldy items, didn&#039;t sell vegetables out of dirty cardboard boxes, and did something about the swarming flies.

				Well, the fruits and veggies outside have disappeared, the stock is still on the shelves inside, the lights are on, but nobody is home.<br />There is a paper notice from the City Marshal&#039;s office on the front entrance that the place has been closed down by order of the law.<br /><br />Taxes?<br /><br />Rent?<br /><br />....something else?<br /><br />It seemed to have been run by a Muslim family of various skill levels. I&#039;ve stood in line while one register was open and two young women in veils struggled to figure out the register they were using. That could be it.<br /><br />The Top Tomato lasted longer... this was open...maybe a year?<br />

				I heard from another business owner a block away that it closed because the landlord wanted $23k a month!!! <br />&nbsp;<br />I feel that the Ditmars area is filling up with empty storefronts (i.e. OTB, store next to Rose &amp; Joe&#039;s bakery, etc, etc, etc)!
