				It seems the winds are moving to passage. <br /><br /><br />First off, we know what will happen in the Assembly. <br /><br /><br />In the Senate though, things are moving this week. <br /><br /><br />Concerning the Dems<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 13px;" class="bbc_size">Three wavering Democratic lawmakers in the State Senate have agreed to support legislation legalizing same-sex marriage in New York, several people with knowledge of the negotiations said on Monday, marking a potential turning point for the long-debated measure. The three senators — Joseph P. Addabbo Jr. and Shirley L. Huntley of Queens and Carl Kruger of Brooklyn — all voted against the measure in 2009, when it failed by a wide margin. Their switch to the yes column leaves all but one Senate Democrat supporting same-sex marriage </span></span>quote]<br /><br /><br />http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/13/strategy-session-called-on-gay-marriage-bill/?smid=tw-nytimes (http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/13/strategy-session-called-on-gay-marriage-bill/?smid=tw-nytimes)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Suprisingly, concerning the GOP.....this from the NY Post.....It&#039;s from Albany Insider Fred Dicker....so someone that has his ear to the ground and a reporter that gets the scoop (for those suprised that I am quoting the Post)<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 13px;" class="bbc_size">Seven or more Senate Republicans have signaled Gov. Cuomo that they&#039;re ready to legalize same-sex marriage, more than enough to put the controversial and historic measure over the top this week, The Post has learned. A highly knowledgeable Senate insider said yesterday that &quot;far more of the [GOP] members are in play than anyone realizes, including some surprising names from conservative upstate areas.&quot; Among the unexpected potential Senate Republican &quot;yes&quot; votes, insiders say, are Kemp Hannon of Nassau County, Charles Fuscillo of Suffolk County, Betty Little of Glens Falls, Andrew Lanza of Staten Island, Greg Ball of Putnam County, James Alesi of Rochester, and Roy McDonald of Rensselaer County -- all of whom helped defeat gay marriage when the vote was held in December 2009.</span></span>quote]<br /><br /><br />http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/gop_swings_both_ways_on_gay_marriage_TukBh0X15jkHPNdJZWxQMJ#ixzz1PAdH3KYl (http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/gop_swings_both_ways_on_gay_marriage_TukBh0X15jkHPNdJZWxQMJ#ixzz1PAdH3KYl)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I think one thing to remember that the defeat of Marriage Equality in 2009 is theorized by some the the defeat of the bill started with the no vote of Sen Addabbo. Once he cast his vote that way, not a single Goper voted yes. <br /><br /><br />For those against this and maybe wanting to post that the people should have a vote(which they do by electing their politicians).....the current polling stands as.....<br /><br /><br />58% for<br />36% against<br />6% undecided<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />New York is ready, as a whole, for this change.<br /><br /><br />It&#039;s time to do it.......<br /><br /><br />But, I&#039;ll be on the edge of my seat until it happens. <br />36<br /><br /><br /><br />

				All the Democrats but Rev. Diaz and two Republicans on board, so far.&nbsp; Great news - hoping for more Republicans to come on board today and the Republican conference to allow the bill to come to the floor.

				That&#039;s not necessarily true, Joey C.&nbsp; There have been a number of recent polls that have shown a majority of New Yorkers actually do support gay marriage, here&#039;s the Quinnipiac one:&nbsp; http://www.scribd.com/doc/56921853/060211-Ny-Issues-Bp.&nbsp; The bill passed because it&#039;s about fairness and equality, and there are enough religious protections packed within that those arguments ring hollow as well.&nbsp; If the church doesn&#039;t want to marry a gay couple, they don&#039;t have to.&nbsp; Case closed.&nbsp; There are plenty of heterosexual couples who have no business getting married but they do every day, and the church doesn&#039;t object.&nbsp; A gay couple who love and respect each other have just as much right to marriage and the benefits that gives as heterosexuals do.&nbsp; Besides, even if a majority of people believed in discrimination, it doesn&#039;t make it right.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.gallup.com/poll/147662/First-Time-Majority-Americans-Favor-Legal-Gay-Marriage.aspx<br />

				It&#039;s not discrimination.&nbsp; Homosexuals don&#039;t ride back of bus, get denied jobs, or lie in poverty cause they are homosexuals.&nbsp; &nbsp; It was changing marriage definition to appease a small group with money that is organized.&nbsp; &nbsp;And Cuomo going in direction he sees as&nbsp; beneficial to himself.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Same sex adoption is worse.&nbsp; What if a heterosexual couple into bondage want to adopt?&nbsp; &nbsp;They may nit be gay, but some guy who want to be dressed in&nbsp; a baby bonnet and diapers, have an apple stuffed in his mouth,&nbsp; then whipped by a woman in a rubber suit is not normal.&nbsp; &nbsp;Same for homosexuals.&nbsp; &nbsp;Both should be private.&nbsp;

				It depends.&nbsp; Can they take care of child, do they have a family, or are they rich enough, like her to have help?<br />Most important, are they sane, and well grounded.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think Sandra Bullock is crazy, but she seems stupid.&nbsp; &nbsp; Rich and stupid.&nbsp; So she gets a kid over someone who may be more qualified.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think a homosexual singe person should adopt kid, if that is what you were getting at.&nbsp; &nbsp;Or a religious freak,&nbsp; a leather and chains freak,&nbsp; people who are crazy about politics one way or another--I mean to the right of Rush Limbaugh or left of&nbsp; Nancy Pelosi.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In fact those last two should not be allowed to adopt.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Too extreme on politics, just my opinion.

				I&#039;ve started 3 different replies, and I&#039;m just going to post this, Joey C, you are misinformed, most of NY State, aside from a good part of the the pseudo midwesterners that inhabit various parts of upstate New York (go Syracuse!), and senior citizens don&#039;t agree with the vote. <br />http://hotair.com/archives/2011/06/28/q-poll-ny-voters-back-gay-marriage-bill-52-40/<br />If you want to stomp around citing things that destroy the sanctity of marriage, speak out against divorce, since that&#039;s much more damaging than whining about people who, you know, love each other. <br />And every family has at least one gay member, whether you realize it or not, your antiquated rhetoric may be hurting someone you care about, and I hope you&#039;ve stopped to think about that.<br />
