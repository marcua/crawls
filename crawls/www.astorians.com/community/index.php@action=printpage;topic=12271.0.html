				Please Please Please do not waste your time going to this bar!&nbsp; I live nearby, and while I love the Crescent Lounge and Broadway Station, I thought &quot;Oh look, a new dive bar.&quot;. Yeah....dive if you mean dive off a cliff!&nbsp; All the bartenders are just scantilly clothed women who have never served a drink in their lives.&nbsp; The man next to me ordered a Jameson on the rocks and the bartend-dress looked at him like he had two heads!&nbsp; Obviously the management of this bar has made a choice to hire females with no skills rather than actual talented bartenders. Speaking of which, I had the &quot;pleasure&quot; of seeing the owner and he was a crusty old pervert!&nbsp; All the clientele were older (50&#039;s 60&#039;s) men gauking at these women attempting to pour the correct drinks.&nbsp; It was an embarrassment for our local neighborhood and I left feeling dirty and disgusted.&nbsp;

				Well, at least it&#039;s a real dive bar.&nbsp; Most places being called dives are full of college grads, yuppies, recent arrivals to Astoria who think they are greatest thing to happen to New York since...well, since whatever was greatest thing to happen to New York.&nbsp; &nbsp; I pass it a lot, was interested what it would be like.&nbsp; &nbsp;Empty.&nbsp; &nbsp;Funny thing is, it used to be packed every day, and draw a good night crowd.&nbsp; It was dive, but crowded one.&nbsp; OTB crowd in day, a few OTB leftovers at night, with a few neighborhood lowlifes at night.&nbsp; They started getting Homeboy -do-rag wearing crowd at night, and fights were getting out of control, so the owners got out.&nbsp; &nbsp; New owners look like they are going out of business quickly, and could care less.&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe they can advertise selves as only true dive in Astoria.&nbsp; Or maybe that scares so-called dive bar seekers away.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I was just about to post something similar to what Jiggs said.<br /><br />Not that I like dive bars with half-naked women, but I&#039;ve inadvertently gone into a couple around here, and it&#039;s skeevy all right. But there&#039;s obviously a market for it. I just avoid them.

				You are so right about the owners not caring!&nbsp; I mean look at the signs in the window that are written with a sharpie and sloppy handwriting.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know exactly what the term &quot;yuppie&quot; means, for all I know I AM one and just don&#039;t see it that way, but Broadway Sports Bar doesn&#039;t even take credit cards.&nbsp; You can&#039;t even start a tab!&nbsp; Lame!&nbsp; I can&#039;t speak for people who have lived in Astoria all their lives and watched it change and grow, but I like the fact that it has become a &quot;happening&quot; area to live in because it&#039;s nice to be in a good crowd of fun people and be able to WALK home from the bars and restaurants.

				I just went to the new Broadway Station for the first time.&nbsp; I was impressed!&nbsp; And the crowd was definitely a little nicer than the last time I had been there.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad the place was renovated.&nbsp; It adds a lot to that stretch of Broadway.&nbsp; I&#039;m curious to see how the Sanford Diner will look after it is renovated.&nbsp; I took a peek in, and the entire place was gutted and is being rebuilt.

				Sanford&#039;s is taking their time renovating.&nbsp; I expect something big--the prices.<br /><br />Credit cards in bars is something i actually don&#039;t like.

				Woah... Take this as you will;&nbsp; I was at this place an hour ago. Tonight it was dead, but I had been there once before and it was st ll dead, but had a nice feel to it with a couple of cute bartenders. This evening while watching the end of the Philles Brewers game I was serenaded by a Latino gentleman who was very fond of the Gypsy Kings. Yes the bar tender had a frilly skirt&nbsp; and I needed to hold up my five didgits in order to confirm the cost of my beer, but hey that does not bother me.<br /><br />Consider this: the bar was just completely gutted and the the bar itself looks like it is about 20 years old. I call that character. If you&#039;re into big screen TVs or fancy shmancy hijincs it&#039;s not your place. <br /><br />Social at Broadway Sports Bar? I&#039;m there with a quarter on the <span class="bbc_u">pool table</span>! As for Broadway station... I&#039;ll stop in to see the hot shots on karaoke night or have a magic hat #9, but I&#039;ve had my fill of negative experiences there regarding their poor service.<br /><br />As long as were on the subject; Crestent bar is a gay bar right?

I was all psyched about going in there. I went out to eat with my long haired straight long time friend and afterwards I told him that I wanted to check this place out. We walked over to Crescent Lunge and there were a bunch of dudes all over each other on velvet love seats and no chicks in sight. We felt out of place so we continued on our way to ultimately nowhere. I don&#039;t consider myself homophobic, I would&nbsp; compare that experience to showing up at a bar with my 18 speed bicycle with the flashing hazard light in the back and i walk in the bar and it&#039;s a hard core biker bar. Maybe I&#039;m just antisocial, but I didn&#039;t feel like it was the everyone&#039;s welcome at all hours type of place. Please steer me in the right direction, because otherwise you&#039;re going to find me in there drinking bourbon on the rocks and asking them to put on the ranger game.

				My first post.<br /><br />Crescent Lounge is what it is.&nbsp; I&#039;m straight, and will stop in occassionally because it is the closest bar to home (Broadway Sports Bar is Second Closest).&nbsp; It is a largely, but not exlucively, gay crowd.&nbsp; Sometimes there is overboard gayness, but most times it is a nice place to hang for a few drinks in a casual atmosphere.&nbsp; The greatest bartenders.<br /><br />Broadway Sports Bar is not a dive bar.&nbsp; Ear Inn in the city is a dive bar.&nbsp; Kelly&#039;s on Crescent is divey.&nbsp; <br /><br />BSB is a complete hole.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been to its predecessors, Spinning Wheel and Dillon&#039;s.&nbsp; If you are not originally from Astoria, and even if you are, there is nothing good in this establishment for Astorians readers.&nbsp; The current owners seems well intentioned, but it is one of the bars, that no matter the climate, there is a bad element which hangs there.&nbsp; I guarantee several non-suspecting hipster/yuppie &#039;new to Astoria&#039; types will get hurt in this bar.&nbsp; Be warned.<br /><br />I don&#039;t like the new B-Way Station very much.&nbsp; If only they would do something with that Brazillian joint across for Parisi&#039;s.&nbsp; <br /><br />Gilby&#039;s is good.<br /><br />Back to BSB - who names a bar &#039;XYZ Sports Bar&#039; in this day and age, anyhow???&nbsp; That martketing tactic is remnant of late 80&#039;s/early 90&#039;s.&nbsp; Which is probably about the time its current owners were sentenced.&nbsp; Welcome home.&nbsp; Astoria changed.&nbsp; For better or worse.

				I would classify &#039;bad element&#039; as patrons which, for no particularly good reason, are likely to mess with, or start some nonsense with someone else.&nbsp; Think of someone, or some group that is all banged up, with a criminal, or at least shady past, spending some benefits check at the bar.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have visited 3 or 4 times since it opened and will stay for a beer or two surveying the crowd, or lack thereof.&nbsp; On one visit after work on Friday evening, some shaved headed scar faced young guy with a gimpy arm was harassing otherwise innocent unsuspecting good natured customers by flicking their ears or talking smack to their faces.&nbsp; Naturally, I found this to be funny, albeit messed up.<br /><br />This is not to say that the whole bar is corrupt.&nbsp; But the actual location of the bar has a history of some bad element customers.&nbsp; Time will tell if BSB rids itself of them.&nbsp; I&#039;d love to see it.&nbsp; Oh, they are also Yankees fans.
