				** lets see who they pick later for the general election **&nbsp; :-D<br />** and they have a decent sports section too **<br />** yall need a break as much as I do. Happy and respectful Memorial Day ** <br /><br />New York Daily News - http://www.nydailynews.com <br />Bill Weld is GOP&#39;s best choice <br /><br />Wednesday, May 24th, 2006 <br /><br />When leaders of New York&#39;s Republican Party meet next week to endorse a candidate for governor, they should focus on picking the strongest, most broadly appealing contender - the one best able to carry the banner against presumed Democratic nominee Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. That candidate is Bill Weld.<br />A native New Yorker who went on to serve as both a top federal prosecutor and a successful governor of Massachusetts, Weld is the GOP&#39;s best hope to head off a Democratic tsunami in November and remain a viable opposition party in the years ahead. As a shrinking minority in New York, Republicans desperately need a champion with crossover appeal to the Democrats and independents who dominate the voter rolls. Fiscally conservative and socially moderate, with broad experience and ample personal charm, Weld fits that bill.<br /><br />Weld twice proved that he was a blue-state vote-getter in the Bay State, where he remained popular throughout his tenure. A Republican working with a Democratic-dominated Legislature, he cut taxes and tamed Medicaid spending - lending him credibility when he promises to do the same for New York. His quick wit and crimefighting credentials make him a good match for Spitzer in debates. And, crucially in this reform-minded campaign, Weld carries no taint of association with Albany dysfunction.<br /><br />Weld also falls into the proud tradition of New York Republicans who part company with the narrow-minded tendencies of the national GOP. Like two-thirds of the citizens of this state, including most members of his own party, Weld supports legalized abortion. And he has a healthy respect for same-sex relationships.<br /><br />His GOP rival, former Assembly Minority Leader John Faso, is an experienced Albany hand whom we endorsed for controller in 2002. But his red-state Republican leanings, such as opposition to abortion, will make him a hard sell. And he can forget about collecting many votes in New York City if he sticks with his promise to defy a court order demanding a fair share of funding for the city schools. Weld, by contrast, speaks of avoiding a constitutional showdown by bringing the parties together and working out a reasonable settlement.<br /><br />Party leaders don&#39;t have the final word on who gets the Republican nomination - that will likely be settled in a primary election in September. And we&#39;re keeping our minds open about who ultimately would be the better candidate in the contest between Democrat and Republican. But unless GOP leaders want little more than a speed bump for Spitzer, they should go with Weld.<br /><br />Taxis for all<br /><br />The battle to increase the number of wheelchair-accessible taxis on our streets now moves to Albany as Mayor Bloomberg and Council Speaker Christine Quinn have committed to ask the Legislature for permission to add 150 such vehicles to the yellow-cab fleet. The two should lobby the dickens out of the place.<br /><br />At present, only 29 of the city&#39;s 12,779 medallion cabs are equipped for wheelchairs, putting the odds of hailing one at 440 to 1. Why even try? All 4,463 public buses and an increasing number of subway stations are wheelchair-accessible, but the ubiquitous cab is all but off-limits. And the Taxi and Limousine Commission doesn&#39;t give a damn. <br /><br />The TLC, which has fought introducing more wheelchair-friendly cabs, maintained its callousness in planning the impending sale of 308 medallions. No more than 54 would be dedicated to vehicles that can accommodate wheelchairs.<br /><br />The Council said half the medallions should be reserved for wheelchair-accessible taxis, but Bloomberg called for devoting the bulk of the new medallions to vehicles that burn alternative fuels. Not a terrible idea when America is trying to break its oil addiction.<br /><br />As a compromise, Quinn won Bloomberg&#39;s agreement to seek the legislative okay to add 150 medallions. Assuming Albany goes along, 204 cabs would be able to accommodate wheelchairs, a drop in the yellow ocean and a long way from what Quinn says is the &quot;ultimate goal of making every taxi in New York wheelchair-accessible.&quot; <br /><br />The way to get that done would be to require medallion owners to replace standard cabs with wheelchair vehicles as standard cabs are retired. Councilman Oliver Koppell plans a bill to complete such a phase-in over six years. We look forward to seeing the measure.<br /><br /><br />You can e-mail the Daily News editors at voicers@edit.nydailynews.com. Please include your full name, address and phone number.
