				Anybody else out there love 1980&#039;s music.&nbsp; Groups like the Police, Styx, Mellencamp, Tommy Tutone, Simple Minds, A-ha, Duran Duran, Wham, Styx, Men at Work and too many others to name.&nbsp; &nbsp; I saw the Police, REM and Joan Jet play at Shea Stadium in the summer of 1983. It was an incredible show despite a thunderstorm.&nbsp; I wish there was a place where you could see cover bands playing this music somewhere in the city.&nbsp; Is there one?

				I am forever stuck in the 80&#039;s although my musical tastes are quite different from yours. Madonna, Prince, Debbie Gibson, Tiffany, Beastie Boys, lots of old school like Tribe Called Quest and Nice and Smooth, and a lot of freestyle like George Lamond, Lisette Melendez, and TKA.&nbsp; As you can see, all I did was dance, and still do :)<br /><br />Culture Club has 80&#039;s performers but no Rock.&nbsp; Would be interested in finding a good cover band as well.&nbsp; I like the cover band on Thursdays at Village Underground in the city.&nbsp; But they do a lot of great music, not necessarily 80&#039;s.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Group, <br /><br />Since so many of us are 80&#039;s music fanatics, I was thinking we could plan a 80&#039;s night for Astorians.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how it would exactly work, especially with the space, but I was thinking that members in the group could contribute music through their personal collection and someone with DJ skills and a little too much time on their hands, could make a mix CD for the party.&nbsp; Any thoughts, or it would it be just too difficult to plan/organize?&nbsp; Mods, again, feel free to move this post.

				I would love a get together of Astorians for a 1980&#039;s night.&nbsp; I have a lot of 80&#039;s cd&#039;s I&#039;m willing to bring or share with anyone who wants to copy or upload to their i-Pod.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really know of a good venue so I am not going to suggest one but leave it to others.&nbsp; If we couldn&#039;t get a DJ we could find a place with an internet jukebox and everyone could contribute a few bucks and we could all select songs and listen to 80&#039;s music all night.

				Group,<br /><br />I spoke to Caesar tonight at Break/Clic and he would be down to do a 80&#039;s night for astorians.com at his spot.&nbsp; He heard about the people we brought to Time Cafe and I think he was a little jealous.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, I was thinking of a holiday party sometime in December.&nbsp; We could probably could get a 80&#039;s DJ and all that on a Wednesday night to do something at Break/Clic.&nbsp; What would the interest be in that?&nbsp; Unfortunately, we couldn&#039;t officially have &quot;dancing&quot; as they don&#039;t have a cabaret license, so if people wanted a more dance friendly spot, let me know.&nbsp; I would be down to organize if there was some interest, but if someone with better skills would like to take over, I&#039;m cool with that as well.&nbsp; Caesar took my number and seemed interested, but I&#039;m up for suggestions, if somebody has anything better.

				yeah, the 80&#039;s music was special to me . it was a sound never to be duplicated . 1980&#039;s &#039;&#039;Late in the Evening&#039;&#039; by Paul Simon and 1989&#039;s Dino &#039;&#039;LP&#039;&#039; topped it off for me

				I think our Astorians mixer is taking the place as a holiday mixer.&nbsp; It&#039;s next Tuesday at the Irish Rover.&nbsp; There&#039;s a separate thread about it.&nbsp; I plan on bringing holiday candy, and playing cheezy 80&#039;s music on the jukebox.

				What Daisy jut wrote.&nbsp; :-D <br /><br />I would love, however, to one day do a retro astorians party.&nbsp; There are so many members on the board who share my love of cheesy 80&#039;s (and 70&#039;s for that matter) music, that I think we could eventually organize something.&nbsp; <br /><br />On the topic of 80&#039;s music: next year I am going to my 20 year high school and I heard that the organizers are trying to find the DJ from the local pop radio station to be there.&nbsp; Hey, he was there for our &quot;All Night Graduation&quot; bash.&nbsp; Of course he has to sport the mullet, wear Oakley&#039;s, and an OP t-shirt!&nbsp; Ah, memories!
