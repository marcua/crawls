				KId - think this was covered in another thread - and there has been disparate points of view.<br /><br />But TIPS - to to insure proper service is not mandatory (unless included in bill) and people can not have precognition over restaraunt&#039;s policies and procedures.<br /><br />I think undertipping in case of bad service, rip-offs or overcharging is part of free speech. Don&#039;t you agree ?

				I am well aware of the other threads that have discussed tipping.&nbsp; I am also aware that per American restaurant etiquette, a customer should tip a waitron.&nbsp; <br />There was no indication that the waitron did anything wrong in this case.&nbsp; Moodle disagreed with a decision made by the management, not the waitron, and instead of taking her qualms up with the management, she stiffed the waitron.&nbsp; The waitron has no power over the restaurant charging for bread, water, extra cheese, whatever it may be, so her grievances were misdirected.<br />She then made a boastful post about what she did.<br />Her right to do so? Sure.<br />Tacky? Absolutely.

				What was the bread charge?&nbsp; Was it really that bad?&nbsp; Lots of restaurants are having a tough time right now.&nbsp; Was the service otherwise fine?&nbsp; Of course it&#039;s within your right not to tip based on a bread charge, but I have to agree with KidMurdock.&nbsp; The bragging part is a little tacky.&nbsp; &nbsp;But whatever.<br /><br />And I really don&#039;t get the cat talk.&nbsp; Why write like that?&nbsp; Maybe I should google the use of cat talk language...&nbsp; I&#039;m certainly missing something.

				here&#039;s what happened:<br />My friend ordered a certain dish. Split seconds after his mentioning a certain dish, the waiter said, &quot;what kind of bread did you want?&quot; To me, this is an inference that bread was included with the dish, and my friend had neglected to choose one. He chose one, and then we found it was charged extra when we got the bill. You&#039;re right, we should have complained to management. But, the only dude that seemed to be around was the waiter. And, i thought that I had left at least a 15% tip (what I leave in case of bad service - I usually leave 20). So when the waiter complained about &quot;not enough tip&quot; on the street, I told him why we didn&#039;t leave as much tip. <br /><br />When I looked at the amount as I was getting to my meeting turns out I hadn&#039;t left 15%, and I felt bad about that. <br />But, we were chased down out on the street, my friend had paid his part with a credit card, I didn&#039;t have any more cash, and I was heading to a meeting, so we werent&#039; really able to rectify the situation at that moment. I&#039;m sure I&#039;d have realized I hadn&#039;t left enough tip later, felt bad, and gone back to leave more, or the next time we went, left a bigger tip to make up for it. I didn&#039;t think it was cool for him to ask for more tip. Do you?

				The charge is NOT the point, the point is that the waiter should have let them know that there is a charge for the bread.&nbsp; Yes, these are tough times and flour has gone up like you wouldn&#039;t believe but if the waiter works for that establishment then he should inform patrons of that establishments policies.&nbsp; Some people ask for a 2nd basket of bread and if it&#039;s a lot of people even more.<br /><br />By the way, I&#039;ve never been charged for bread whether it&#039;s a five star restaurant or a diner so most people don&#039;t expect to be charged.&nbsp; What if you have a certain amount of $$ for food and tip?&nbsp;

				oh for god&#039;s sake it wasn&#039;t bragging. I happened to have been talking in LOLcats that day. I&#039;m not proud that I didn&#039;t end up leaving enough tip. I did find it odd the waiter chased us down (nice of him to chase us down to give us my friend&#039;s card back) but I&#039;ve never had anyone chase me down to complain about tip. Is this a New York thing?

				Meow meow Meow meow - where&#039;s meow f&#039;n tip ?<br /><br />Do not do this in the Carnegie Deli as I&#039;ve heard they will send a posse after you. Years ago, I ordered take out there regularly, and one day this waitress started screaming at me that I had not left her a tip or a proper tip.<br /><br />I said I&#039;m just ordering take out, I think you&#039;ve confused me with someone else. The counter people verified and she shlunk&nbsp; off.<br /><br />Hey I even tip my laundry lady - but sometimes there&#039;s a limit.

				This does, however, remind me of the scene in Super Troopers, where the guy is trying to saw meow 10 times while giving the guy a ticket.<br /><br />Foster: Meow.

But you tip the laundry lady? Am I remiss in not doing so? I&#039;ve only been doing drop-off service for a couple of months so I don&#039;t know if this is the norm or not. Enlighten me, please?<br /><br />Also, I never tipped for gas, but then again, I lived in Jersey, where full service was the norm and tips weren&#039;t given for it. I imagine that pump jockeys here would get enough Jerseyans to not always expect a tip. At least I don&#039;t have to worry about this one anymore, now that I don&#039;t have a car...

				I thought the cat talk was funny, but also got the impression that no tip was left.&nbsp; Also, at first it sounded as if you were charged for bread you ordered but didn&#039;t get.&nbsp; <br /><br />If the waiter asked what kind of bread the person wanted it does seem to imply that the bread is included, but if this was an Indian restaurant, then bread often isn&#039;t included.&nbsp; It&#039;s like when you go to McDonalds and they ask if you want apple pie with that or when you tell the White Castle cashier you want the #whatever and they ask if you want cheese on that.&nbsp; It sounds like it&#039;s included in the price, but it&#039;s not.&nbsp; I think it would have been better to tell the waiter that you didn&#039;t know the bread was not included.&nbsp; He might or might not have had the power to remove the charge from the bill, and even if the manager/owner isn&#039;t around the waiter might have phoned him/her.&nbsp; Intelligent management will take off the charge and explain that in the future you&#039;ll know that it&#039;s not included.&nbsp; Better to lose a tiny amount of money that a whole customer! <br /><br />When I go to an Indian restaurant and order bread I always choose naan because it takes more effort to make.&nbsp; You can do chapattis with your eyes closed, and poori is simply chapattis that have been cooked in oil.&nbsp; As for the price of bread in an Indian restaurant, it&#039;s long been a rip-off!<br /><br />
