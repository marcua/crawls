				Pat&#039;s Stationery at 4920 30th Avenue has been there a long time. Pat is still working behind the counter where you can get coffee or toasted English muffins/rolls. Old school.&nbsp; I think Pat could be a good interview, I would like to know his story.&nbsp; It&#039;s definitely frozen in time, I like this place.

				clearview821 ~ my recommendation of a person is &quot;Cadillac Man.&quot;&nbsp; He never gives his real name.&nbsp; He has been around forever and has seen the changes in the Astoria/Ditmars area.&nbsp; He is/was homeless.&nbsp; For years he was stationed under that Amtrak passage when you pass the Park and Ride at the Ditmars Station.&nbsp; Very polite and just about everyone in the area who has lived there long enough knows of him.<br /><br /><br />Lately in the early am you can find him hanging out in front of that Italian sandwich place along 23rd Ave (Sal, Kris, Charlie Deli) .. oh, that&#039;s would make a good collection for the work you&#039;re doing.&nbsp; That place is very very popular.<br /><br /><br />Good luck.&nbsp; C&#039;iao for now ~<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 0.7em;" class="bbc_size"><strong>(Pls remember to be kind to our Planet Earth and all its habitats and creatures!)</strong></span><br /><br />

				Well sadly (ironically?) , a few days after I posted about Pat&#039;s Stationery store, they closed up forever.&nbsp; Evidently they didn&#039;t tell anyone in advance because they knew regulars would be upset.&nbsp; I learned that he started it as an ice cream parlor, hence the counter and bar stools, where people hung out, ate their english muffins, scratched a lot of lottery tickets and shot the breeze.&nbsp; So anyway, am very curious what will move in there now. Am going to miss that place.

				LaGuli&#039;s has been in Astoria since my parents (now in their 80s) were kids.&nbsp; Re Rudy&#039;s Hobby Shop: when I was in high school during the mid 1970s, it was a soda fountain/malt shop.&nbsp; However, it was changed to a hobby shop, I believe, in the 1980s.
