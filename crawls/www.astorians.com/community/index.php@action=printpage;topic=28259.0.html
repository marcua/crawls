				Hey everyone. I&#039;m looking for a clean responsible roommate for a move in this September. The apartment is on the second floor of a house located on 37 ST between 23rd and 24th ave so you are near Ditmars and 30th Ave for fun and drinks. This is a very large railroad style apartment with a nice size room with loads of closet space. The living room is empty so you could do anything you want with that. The living room windows offer a great view of Manhattan. This is also a wonderful area where you&#039;re close to everything but it&#039;s quiet also. There is an actual kitchen where you can actually cook. There&#039;s also a backyard and basement to store some things. Not your whole life&#039;s possessions but it&#039;s good to know its there. The rent is 1250. That would include utilities and internet. I&#039;m an actor in his 30s. I have a cat. Looking for someone reliable, clean responsible. Isn&#039;t going to rip the place apart. This is a really a nice place to come home to after a jaunt through the city. The N and Q are near as well as the M60 bus.
