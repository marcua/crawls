				The last Olympics that I watched with great interest was Barcelona &#039;92.&nbsp; I don&#039;t even remember anything from Athens &#039;04 because I was working 60 to 70 hours a week and drinking my self into a coma when I wasn&#039;t working.<br /><br />I&#039;ve sort of been caught up in the political, social, and environmental issues with Beijing &#039;08.&nbsp; Besides the big names like Phelps, the US basketball team, and that 40-year-old swimmer, I really don&#039;t know about the participants.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure NBC will show the personal side of many of the athletes, but I just want to see them compete!<br /><br />I used to be a big track fan.&nbsp; Whether it was disc or marathon, I was glued to the television.&nbsp; But now we just don&#039;t know who&#039;s taking what or which one of our childhood &quot;heroes&quot; were on the juice.&nbsp; I used to like Marion Jones and Ben Johnson, two of the biggest names in the sport, but we all saw what happened to them.<br /><br />Sorry for being negative.&nbsp; I know that I will probably plop in front of my television and watch like everyone else.&nbsp; I just will never have the same enthusiasm as I did like the &#039;84 LA or the &#039;88 Seoul games.&nbsp;

Not because I don&#039;t like the Olympics or because I&#039;m boycotting, but I just don&#039;t watch them. I might watch them if I had my own place or if I had a TV in my room, but our TV is in the living room and I&#039;m usually doing other stuff unless I really want to watch something. If I were to watch the Olympics, though, I would watch the gymnastics and possibly diving. The Winter Olympics have more events I like watching.

				I refuse to watch it. <br />first of all, its in Beijing, and this Olympics - at least for me - mirrors Berlin &#039;36. The only good things to come out of that were Jesse Owens and the film Olympia. <br />the Olympics are a festival of doping, commercialism, and ridiculous manufactured patriotism. <br />Good riddance to it. I wish it would just go away.

				So don&#039;t watch NBC! The other channels that will be covering the Olympics, including MSNBC, USA, and Oxygen (!), will doubtless have more sports and less fluff. Also, just about every event will be streamed live on nbcolympics.com, I think.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=11677.msg144474.html#msg144474">Quote from: RayG on August 06, 2008, 01:30:06 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">yaawwwnnnnn...

				I&#039;m excited about the Olympics!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I&#039;ve watched them for years and years - I remember seeing Nadia Komenich in the 70s.&nbsp; Have loved gymnastics since.&nbsp; I also lived in LA when the Games where there in the 80s.&nbsp; It was cool and they did a great job with traffic issues, I remember.&nbsp; And Sydney and Athens I thought were fabulous.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be watching the Opening Ceremonies on Friday; swimming, diving (will keep Big Bryan in mind then), track &amp; field, and gymnastics; and if i can, beach volleyball, synchronized swimming, rowing, and triathlon.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure that I&#039;ll catch other stuff if I see it.<br /><br />Although I&#039;m not keen on the Games being in China, I do love the event itself.&nbsp; And that will trump my reservations about China as the host.&nbsp; I will say that I&#039;m super curious to see the new buildings they built for the Games, especially the aquatic center.

				That opening ceremony made Nuremberg rallies look like they were choreographed by a bunch of fourth graders.<br />Fascist fun for the whole family! Whee! No really -- <br />If you visit Mia Farrow&#039;s site about Darfur she is encouraging people to support the athletes by watching the games, but to turn the channel during commercials.&nbsp; That works for my boyfriend; he likes the track and field, and of course, womens volleyball. <br />and another question : if dancing on ICE is an olympic sport, why isn&#039;t ballroom dancing on TERRA FIRMA?<br />Just puttin; it out there. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				I love both summer and winter olympics.&nbsp; I get teary eyed every time they play the winner&#039;s national anthem.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t matter who wins.... I just love it. <br /><br />I don&#039;t care about the corporate bulls..t, I don&#039;t care about the politics while I&#039;m watching the athletes compete. I just look at the amount of training each individual puts into their sport and it blows my mind.&nbsp; Then the pressure each athlete is under &quot;representing their country&quot; also blows my mind.&nbsp; It amazes me that they can perform at all.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like China&#039;s history on human rights but I don&#039;t let that take anything away from the accomplishments of the athletes, including the Chinese athletes.&nbsp; I am so moved by them all, I can&#039;t even describe it.&nbsp; I am the biggest sap when it comes to this stuff.&nbsp; <br /><br />I like winter sports better than summer but I still get into the swimming and diving and gymnastic events.&nbsp; I missed the opening ceremony because I was working.&nbsp; I caught bits and pieces on youtube and nbc.com but it&#039;s not the same.&nbsp; &nbsp;:cry:<br /><br />

				Wow! The Opening Ceremony really was awe inspiring. It was beautiful and intimidating, as the TV commentator correctly stated. At the very beginning I said: &quot;typical fascist spectacle&quot;, but as the ceremony continued I was drawn in to the technical mastery and gorgeous excess of it all! Wonder what the Closing Ceremony will be like.<br />Here&#039;s an interesting observation from the Greek newspaper Ekathimerini:<br />http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_columns_1_11/08/2008_99417<br />

				Yeah, Phelps has been amazing. It always intrigues me when someone is so much better than everyone else in his sport. It seems impossible, yet there it is. Oh, and apparently I lied earlier in the thread when I said I wouldn&#039;t be watching the Olympics. I&#039;ve been watching them a lot at night, particularly the gymnastics, and I found the synchronized diving to be strange and entertaining. <br /><br />But I do think half the Chinese women&#039;s gymnastics team were way under 16. The one girl who did look to be an appropriate age appeared years older than the others, who looked to be about 12. It&#039;s too bad the US team made so many big mistakes, because overall the gymnastics had a much better look to it, especially on the beam. I believe that polished, solid look comes with age. The older Chinese girl had nice form too. The little ones, while technically proficient at jumping and flipping, had no finesse to their movements. I felt similarly about Tara Lipinski back when she beat Michelle Kwan in the Olympics.

				I agree with you about the age thing, essen, and it saddens me. There are good reasons why Elite level training doesn&#039;t start til 10 in a lot of countries. I just worry that some of these girls will have had multiple growth plate injuries before they are even teenagers. <br /><br />But this is what these athletes live their whole life for, I guess....wasn&#039;t it the men&#039;s coach that said that he would throw himself off of Beijing&#039;s tallest building if the men did not win the Gold? Serious pressure.

				I agree Cleo, I get a twinge of sadness too-that&#039;s why even though I think boxing is exciting I can&#039;t really watch it (well-with one eye open while flinching and ducking a lot) because not only does the loser lose, but he gets roughed up pretty bad too, but athletes are different-very competitive, maybe even hyper-competitve.

She was to perform the only solo dance number-the dance number called &quot;The Bird&#039;s Nest&quot; when she leaped toward a platform that malfunctioned. She fell ten feet and now she is paralyzed from the chest down, perhaps never to walk again. :cry:<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/15/sports/olympics/15dancer.html<br />

				Medal Count: 102<br /><br />http://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/beijing<br /><br />It&#039;s almost over. Which is good for the US Track &amp; Field team cause they sucked big time in the competition.&nbsp; &nbsp;:x<br /><br />I enjoyed watching the olympics overall these past two weeks.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)<br /><br />Surprised to see bmx racing and balanced beam jumping in the competition.&nbsp; :-o&nbsp; &nbsp; Fun to watch. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
