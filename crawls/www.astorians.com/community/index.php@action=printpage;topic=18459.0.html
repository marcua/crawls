				I read through the article and I&#039;m left wondering this: 60% of 1,000 apartments are set aside for middle income housholds and this sounds (and is) fantastic.<br /><br />But a total of 5,000 units are planned and unless a portion of the remaining 4,000 apartments are reserved for middle income earners the percentage available to them drops to a measily 12%!<br /><br />But hey, any development for middle earners is better than none I guess.

				I&#039;m also curious if you absolutely must have a family to qualify.&nbsp; If you&#039;re single or have no kids, are you out of luck?

				Thanks Kyle, Thanks 28G. I had lamed. It was &#039;fishy&#039;.<br /><br /><br />I was wondering about this as well. Ideally, any increase in supply should have a beneficial impact no matter level of income. (It depends on how much demand there is.)<br />More so outside of Manhattan. We also should hope the quality of housing is good.<br /><br />I noted that the subsidies are going where developers are less likely to take on the risk.<br />The article raises many points.<br /><br />Some more info -<br /><br />http://www.nycedc.com/ProjectsOpportunities/CurrentProjects/Queens/HuntersPointSouth/Pages/HuntersPointSouth.aspx<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">– A one-person household earning $36,800 would qualify for a studio<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hope that is applicable.

				Thanks for the extra links TRX.<br /><br />According to the video and other links it is indeed 60% of the planed 5,000 units of housing, which is good news.<br /><br />And adding on from your last post:<br />– A one-person household earning $36,800 would qualify for a studio<br />– A two-person household earning $46,000 would qualify for a one-bedroom unit<br />– A three-person household earning $55,300 would qualify for a two-bedroom unit<br /><br />I wonder how this will work in reality since the building will be a mixture of rentals and condos.

				This would be an ideal community for fixed-income, middle class retirees as well.
