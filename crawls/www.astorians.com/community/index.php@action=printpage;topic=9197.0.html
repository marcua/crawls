				It would probably be a good idea to actually tell us what the petition is about, why the petition is necessary and why you support it if you would like to get signatures. If you want other people to back you up, you should really provide an explaination and not just a link. It&#039;s not a very effective way of making a point.<br /><br />Can you tell us more about what the &quot;artists&quot; need to be &quot;saved&quot; from and who, exactly the artists are?

				Also, I went and read your webpage and even it doesn&#039;t make any sense. It says people are being murdered and kidnapped and that these people are artists, but it doesn&#039;t cite any specific instances, where this is happening or anything. I support artist rights, but I&#039;m not signing something that I don&#039;t understand.

				You made some good points ; but if you click (the link @ the SEE CASE NUMBER REF. ) in the body of the petition you will see my personal account w/them, and the case synopsis I sent the The U.S. Attorney Generals in Washington D.C.<br /><br />They have marked many Artists some you may know about, in my experience I would estimate about at least 100,000 American People have been marked by the NY FBI !<br /><br />I think if you link on the link I have provided, this will give you a better understanding about what is happening.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you are interested in our Cause+ and think you could help us improve our petition please tell me how.<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />+JVA+

				Thanks,<br /><br />After briefing yourself on our case LPIII please state if you can make any improvements,<br />in the petition.<br /><br />This is a the link in the body of the Petition I was referring to:<br /><br /><strong>SEE CASE NUMBER REF. <br />[ http://www.thecauses.org/index.php?topic=38.0 (http://www.thecauses.org/index.php?topic=38.0) ] </strong> <br /><br />LP III is a body of evidence from 1978- 2008 Its enforcement ensures our generation success and safety, and the abolishment of &quot;black demonic rain&quot;, which is falling on LA &amp; NY. <br /><br />This Petition by the petitioners is in support of Liberty Project III, and Its enforcement. We want to STOP, and prosecute The Crime Syndicate for the crimes that they committed against Demetrios Poulakas/Us and our generation, which was submitted into various U.S. Law Enforcement Agencies. and are signing THIS PETITION! <br /><br />OUR ADVOCATES ARE PETITIONING TO ENFORCE LP III {A FIVE HUNDRED PAGE CASE AGAINST THIS CRIME SYNDICATE AND THE CRIMES THAT THEY COMMITTED. They must be stopped, and brought to justice! <br /><br />WE WON&#039;T BECOME VICTIMS AGAIN! <br /><br />+JVA+

				So wait... I want to make sure that I understand...<br /><br />You&#039;re saying that FBI agents were attempting to commit these crimes against you while they were part of a covert drug op? The letters you&#039;ve posted and the information contained behind the link is definitely &quot;inside&quot; information. We don&#039;t know the stories or what happened. If you want people to take you seriously, you need to be able to summarize the instances that have occurred in a narrative form.<br /><br />Have you sought legal counsel?

				No, what I am saying is that during the Gorge Bush Jr. administrations the NY FBI is organize crime &quot;a unit which is a crime syndicate&quot;, they have violated our U.S. Constitution, and our generation.&nbsp; We are trying to get the U.S. Government to enforce Liberty Project III (the title of our case), because we have a right to get justice.<br /><br />We are trying to prosecute them for the crimes that they have committed, on me, on us, and our generation, and/or sue them,&nbsp; I am looking for an attorney to take legal action to do just that.<br /><br />We also feel that we have a class action suit, so all people can find justice. <br /><br />Oh and, all people do take me seriously. <br /><br />+JVA+<br />

				You still haven&#039;t explained, specifically, what the &quot;crime&quot; committed against you was. <br /><br />I can&#039;t figure out what you&#039;re talking about.

Don&#039;t say that they&#039;ve &quot;violated our US Constitution, our generation&quot; without saying specifically how.
