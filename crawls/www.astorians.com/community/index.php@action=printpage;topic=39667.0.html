				I am very sad about this loss to the neighborhood. I enjoyed many meals at Wave Thai, as well as take out many times, too. They&#039;ve had the doors open to auction off their equipment, and I had a chance to express my thanks and sorrow to a young woman who&#039;s worked there for a while. They don&#039;t have plans for a relocation right now, but encouraged tracking them on the Wave Thai Facebook page.<br /><br /><br />They provided MANY wonderful meals for me, and certainly never got wealthy in the process. Wishing them well.

				I like Bangkok Tasty, too. I found Wave Thai and Bangkok Thai to be good for different things. Will miss Wave Thai. Curious about Boon Chu 2. I went there once soon after they opened and wasn&#039;t impressed. Maybe I should give it another try? It has always looked empty when I&#039;ve walked by, which hasn&#039;t been encouraging, either.

The food itself is good.&nbsp; We do takeout.&nbsp; Another excellent new Thai place is on 30th.&nbsp; The only issue I had is it&#039;s VERY tight and claustrophobic.&nbsp; Cool décor and space but I prefer more room from my neighbors. https://www.yelp.com/biz/pochana-thai-kitchen-astoria-2

				<br />I&#039;m also sad about Wave, not only because I loved their decor/ambiance (so warm and cozy) but...I discovered their Street Noodles with Beef.&nbsp; OMG...sublime!!&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s also sad because of what this means for the nabe as a whole....yet another small business being forced out due to greed, with little care for how it all changes the character of the neighborhood.&nbsp; I fault the local politicians who are allowing this to happen completely unchecked.&nbsp; Everywhere I turn I see new empty lots being built-up, often with ugly new buildings.&nbsp; Or houses on side streets being sold, and then &#039;built-up&#039; with additional floors ....you know, so the new owners can make maximum profit with multiple rental units.&nbsp; It&#039;s all quite disgusting, as it&#039;s all about pure greed.<br /><br />And then how will our subways handle all the extra people moving here?&nbsp; And then the long-term residents will be complaining about where to park their multiple cars (they can&#039;t park their SUVs in their own garages of course, because their garages are full of junk).&nbsp; Sigh.

				I did some research on this a few weeks ago, and that whole block of 31st from ABC Super Stores to the public library is being bulldozed for new construction, with commercial space on the ground floor and 42 residential units on floors 2-6: https://www.yimbynews.com/2017/03/six-story-42-unit-mixed-use-project-coming-to-21-21-31st-street-astoria.html (https://www.yimbynews.com/2017/03/six-story-42-unit-mixed-use-project-coming-to-21-21-31st-street-astoria.html)<br /><br />That&#039;s an improvement over what I had read before. Apparently, initial plans called for converting the whole block from the library to 21st Ave into 78 units. That would have included Elephant Thai, the 99¢ store, El Olivo, a salon, and Verdi Fresh. The old Sunbright laundromat was part of that, and it has closed already. The same company (RockFarmer) bought all of these spaces, so maybe they&#039;re just building in two phases now?

				I walked by the new Thai Place Sans Aroy yesterday at 1 and it was empty.&nbsp; The Bonny had a line to get in, the bagel place was crowded but this place had no customers at all. It was like this with Bangkok Tasty.&nbsp; If they want this new restaurant to be a success they will have to make some changes to attract customers or they will have the same fate as Bangkok Tasty.

				I ran into Peter, the owner of Wave Thai, this week.&nbsp; He said his nephew started up San Aroy, hence the same menu. But he and his wife are not involved in the new venture.

				<br />Just saw this thread...I hope the new venture offers the same quality?&nbsp; ;-)<br /><br />I too was hooked on Wave&#039;s street noodles.&nbsp; Friends in the nabe introduced me to Wave Thai...they loved their street noodles...I decided to try that dish one time and....WOW!&nbsp; It was so good I went back just a few days later to get the same dish.&nbsp;

				Maybe they should try outdoor seating to attract customers.&nbsp; I have no desire to go there if it&#039;s empty.&nbsp; Also I read on yelp a guy ordered a shrimp dish and they only gave him 4 tiny shrimps.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like stingy restaurants.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be going here.
