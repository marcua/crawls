				As if it wasn&#039;t bad enough that a huge building is being constructed on 30th Drive, there are plans to build a 5-story building on the parking lot space between the Concord and the Asti on 31st Avenue.&nbsp; This space is first of all too small to contain such a large building--there would have to be a very narrow entrance leading to an almost-as-narrow main building--but the proposed structure would also cut off light and air to many of the surrounding buildings on 31st Avenue and Crescent Street.<br /><br />I always feel pessimistic that developers&#039; plans can be stopped, especially given our Community Board, but I hold out a little hope that at least a few of the nuttier ones can be killed or reworked.&nbsp; If anyone&#039;s interested in learning more, PM me or come to the next Long Island City Alliance meeting on Tuesday, April 13 at 6:30 PM at the Quinn Building (35-20 Broadway, 4th Floor).<br />

				Hi<br /><br />Many of us heard of this last year.Nothing surprises me.<br />I do not feel our voices will be heard.Look at our area ..<br />Buildings built apartments are&nbsp; empty.<br /><br />UNLESS the Concord and the Asti residents kick up a fuss and get an injunction in the courts&nbsp; to stop this nothing will be done.Our words mean nothing.<br />I feel for the Owners of the Concord and the Asti.<br /><br />The apartment buildings on Crescent street willl have new neighbors in their back windows.<br />Why has the Community Board not posted this any where to let all know so they can voice opinions?I did hear of it last week again.<br /><br />Will I attend any meeting on this NOPE..why cause our concerns have gone to deaf ears<br /><br />Cassie

				Would you LICA folks also be interested in stopping Mt. Sinai from building a 9 story addition on 30th Road &amp; Crescent Street?

				From what I heard last week...I am not a LICA person..I am a long time resident of the area..We need a new Hospital..Desparately ...I heard there a problem going to 9 stories..<br /><br />Research who sits on the Board of the Hospital and contact them to hear first hand how many stories the hospital will be..I heard 3..<br /><br />Remember this the money to build Must come from the somewhere.Research at State and City level also research the Berger Commission on how many beds are allowed..<br /><br />I know you live near the Hospital ( you posted long ago your concens )but the building is desparately needed. We all&nbsp; should have voiced our opinions more long ago on this when we had empty lots..but Lets be honest Who knew Astoria would be taken over by Huge empty apartment buildings.<br />Seriously call the Administator of the Hospital and see what is said.<br />GOOD LUCK<br /><br />Cassie

				BTDT. I saw their plans. Are you aware that 3 Queens hospitals went bankrupt in the past year? They went bankrupt because they couldn&#039;t fill the beds. What in G-d&#039;s name makes Mr. Sinai think they will fill NINE stories of beds? Queens residents historically use either Manhattan or Nassau hospitals as they are better equipped and offer more services than a Queens hospital can afford. The Mt. Sinai system is barely keeping their heads above water and if it wasn&#039;t for Medicaid as the primary payor, Mt. Sinai would have folded a long time ago. BTW, the CEO sits on CB1 and she doesn&#039;t consider this a conflict of interest. <br /><br />IMHO 9 stories of anything doesn&#039;t belong on a residential block. A NINE story hospital, with ambulances coming and going 24/7, livery cabs coming and going 24/7, no street parking being allowed, insufficient planning on truck deliveries 24/7, and the current drug and alcohol dependent abusers handing around the ER 24/7 will make for a horrendous condition even if one doesn&#039;t consider that Crescent Street is an access route to the 59th Street Bridge.<br /><br />Haven&#039;t you noticed that almost ALL local medical practices also have offices outside of Astoria so that their doctors can have privileges at a major facility?<br /><br />Why do you think that the North Shore/LIJ and New York Hospital systems have avoided Astoria? They could have grabbed the old Boulevard Hospital for pennies on the dollar and invested less than $20M and turned it into a major link in their systems. Now Mt. Sinai is looking for public funding of $75M to add to their $4M and they think that this is going to make them HOT! They need to find a parcel of land and build there. There are plenty of parcels available that they could get, but they would prefer to save money and build on a residential street because they delude themselves that they have the formula for success.<br /><br />I, personally, will fight them until I die.

				HI<br /><br />I just heard who sits on the CB1 and the hospital..agree with you<br /><br />research the parcel of land to why they cannot go to 9 stories..there is a reason..<br /><br />Good Luck in your quest.<br /><br />The way I feel to what&nbsp; has gone&nbsp; on&nbsp; &nbsp;in Astoria why should I even vote any more.<br /><br />Our voices have gone unheard for so so long<br /><br />Again wish you Good Luck sincerely&nbsp; in your quest<br /><br /><br />Cassie
