				http://www.housingnyc.com/html/resources/faq/repairs.html#steps<br /><br />We&#39;ve had trouble with our toilet for years, but it&#39;s been intermittent and would eventually resolve itself.....after much plunging/flooding/washing/repeat a couple more times.<br /><br />The other night, came home to find my new roommate stressed out over it. She called a plumber who used an auger to clear it up, $100 later it was working again.<br /><br />This lasted a day. Then it stopped working the next afternoon.<br /><br />Because neither of us are big-time TP wasters, nor do we flush anything that doesn&#39;t belong in the toilet (besides the occasional cockroach), we got tired of being accused of mistreating the plumbing.<br /><br />While I&#39;ve always figured this was part of the life of a renter, my roommate wasted no time Googling the subject, understandably pissed that we had to wait on and pay for a plumber when there was nothing we did wrong. In the past, we never called a plumber b/c we didn&#39;t want the expense, and it was hard to say WHAT was wrong exactly.<br /><br />We&#39;ll see what happens, but after nearly seven years, it would be nice if the landlords repaired/paid for SOMEthing.&nbsp; :-P The leaky windowsills, refridgerator, and cracks in the floor are one thing.....but we need the damn toilet to work!!
