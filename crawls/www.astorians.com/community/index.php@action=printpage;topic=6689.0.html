				There is a new supermarket , I think it&#039;s on 34th or 35th Ave, it&#039;s where the old Tupelo Bar was. I think it may be 35th Ave and 34th Street, anyway they have yerba mate cocido (not loose) but in tea bags. They had it with the other teas in one of the aisles. <br />You can probably also find it at most Brazilian Supermarkets (theres one on the Corner of Northern Blvd &amp; 35th Ave)also if you go to Jackson Heights i thinks it&#039;s on the corner of Corona Ave &amp; Junction Blvd there is a supermarket (Keyfood or CTown) that has all of Argentinean food.&nbsp;

				One of the best sources of premium organic Yerba Mate is headquartered right in Astoria -- Athelier Tea Workshop.&nbsp; <br /><br />They have fresh green yerba mate, aged yerba mate, as well as over 30 unique flavors, including their famous Mojito (lemon-mint).&nbsp; All of them are biodynamically grown and certified organic to the highest standards (USDA as well as the more stringent Japanese OKO).&nbsp; <br /><br />There is also a large selection of powdered mate (plain and flavored).&nbsp; These are soluble and great for making mate lattes.<br /><br />They recently closed their tea bar in the DKNY store in SoHo are now focused on direct sales and wholesale.&nbsp; However, any of their products can be sampled and picked up (by appointment) at their headquarters on 30th Ave, a few blocks from Steinway St.<br /><br />For more information, contact Xavier Leon, president and founder, at 718-274-7236.&nbsp; Or check out their website: http://www.atheliertea.com
