				I see they will be opening a new bagel place right under the ditmars station where the copycom used to be underneath the back rub place.&nbsp; I think this is a good spot for this

				I saw that from across the street but didn&#039;t notice if a business name was up. Did you see any details? I agree, I think this is a great spot for a bagel place.

				I think they will do great business at that location. People could pick up a bagel and coffee and then get on the train. It&#039;s very convenient

				Great... MORE opportunities for people to drop crumbs and spill coffee on the train. I long for the days when it was actually ILLEGAL to eat or drink on the train. Get on the DC Metro and you don&#039;t have to check if someone left a coffee lid or half a donut on the seat. <br /><br /><br />When Dinkins was mayor, they showed him being &quot;one of the people&quot; taking the train to work while having a cup of coffee and such. Until it was pointed out to him that it was illegal. They changed the rules instead of actually enforcing them.

				I agree w/RayG. A couple of weeks ago I was on the train going into the city from Ditmars. I watched a man and woman board at Ditmars eating bagels - which smelled of garlic and cream cheese&nbsp; - and then put their coffee containers on the seat. <br /><br /><br />They were shocked when, as the train moved, one container fell and spilled all the way down the seat, on to the coat of the young woman sitting at the other end of that seat. &quot;Oh I can&#039;t believe that happened&quot; the woman actually said. <br />Really? <br /><br /><br />Luckily the other woman&#039;s coat wasn&#039;t stained, but a lot of people who eat/drink on the train aren&#039;t always careful or considerate. <br /><br />

				Well I&#039;m sure not everyone will get there food to go and there will be people sitting in there enjoying their food.&nbsp; Like I said before, it&#039;s a great location for this and I&#039;m looking forward to it opening
