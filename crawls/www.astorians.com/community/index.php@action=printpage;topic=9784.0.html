				I never voted for the shmedrick, but somehow I feel an obligation to defend his right to hang in there, although I believe he won&#039;t win another term as it is Bloomberg&#039;s to buy.<br /><br />1. He has not been charged with anything. He was named and publicaly linked to this FBI investigation. However, he has not been charged<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; with any wrong doing by tghe FBI or any law enforcement.<br />2. Many other Politicians - say including Larry Craig have been arrested and charged - and some even pled guilty - and some how hung in&nbsp; there&nbsp; - Unless he is charged with a crime - why not ride this out like others have?<br />3. Of course he&#039;s a hypocrite - Oh is he the 1st hypocritical politician ?<br />4 If being in a sex scandal was cause for losing office or being ostracised - Barney Frank, Ted Kennedy, Clinton, Craig, Newton&nbsp; and <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;so many others (it boggles the mind) would be long gone and forgotten.<br />5. Sorry -- Since when is the FBI on Prosty&nbsp; Patrol ????<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Are there no Terrorists to track, no major crimes, kidnappings, missing Children, Bank Robberies and Federal offenses to investigate ?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Why in this day and age especially - have the FBI checking Escort services to see if they&#039;re legit or not and leaking politician&#039;s names<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; to the public ?&nbsp;

				Actually, the FBI only found out about the escort service when the IRS started looking into Spitzer&#039;s account because of suspicious activity.&nbsp; They thought that he was taking bribes and in the course of their investigation, uncovered the prostitution connection.&nbsp; Ultimately, the Feds will probably file the charge of &quot;structuring&quot; against him, which seems to be like money laundering.&nbsp; The Feds didn&#039;t leak Spitzer&#039;s name to the public, he called his top aides into his office to explain that the allegation would come out that he was involved with an escort ring.&nbsp; The aides leaked this to the NY Times.&nbsp; The Feds released their case against the prostitution ring all the way back on Thursday, and Spitzer was specifically NOT identified.&nbsp; I assume they might have been saving that for the federal charges.

				It seems the Feds were investigating a money laundering scheme. Spitzer knows all about that crap from his previous investigations. That&#039;s why he insisted on paying cash. I wonder if they can get him on aiding a money laundering scheme?

				This is this just the same disheartening crap that has happened throughout history with lawyers and politicians. &nbsp;It&#039;s the kind of crap that gives us a bad name. &nbsp;I&#039;m not naive and admit I can be idealistic but as a lawyer, I do truly believe that we have to always have ethics and professionalism in mind in whatever it is we do. &nbsp;What Spitzer did is just pure hypocrisy. I don&#039;t want to hear that there are levels of bad. &nbsp;That why should we come down so hard on poor spitzer for banging a prostitute when there is a worse crime, a murderer, for example, to go after. &nbsp;A crime is a crime is a crime. &nbsp;And if you were the Attorney General for NY and now the Govenor, you know what, you have a responsibility to yourself and to your profession that should not be taken lightly. &nbsp;I love sex just as much as the next person but really, you&#039;re a former Attorney General who has, in your career, gone after a number of wrongdoers, including those involved in prostitution rings and now you are the Govenor of the State of New York banging a prostitute.&nbsp; If you&#039;re really that horny, why not just wait till your wife goes to bed and jack off to some internet porn.

				I guess I thought it was common knowledge that he was a member of the Tribe.&nbsp; Well, anyways, good riddance to that ass hat.<br /><br />I question whether his wife knew about this, though.&nbsp; It had been going on for 6 years!&nbsp; Perhaps there was a bit of willing suspension of disbelief?&nbsp; I mean, six years is a long time, and $80K isn&#039;t exactly pocket change, well, at least not to me.&nbsp; I have to think she at least suspected something was up.<br /><br />Those poor daughters.&nbsp; Ugh, the s___ they must be dealing with right now.&nbsp; I can&#039;t even imagine it.&nbsp; I hope they have a good group of real friends that will support them through this, cause I just don&#039;t know if they can confide anything in their parents.

I am guessing you don&#039;t have kids because if you did you will know that they are a lot savvier then you think. They hear everything and just because they don&#039;t say anything it doesn&#039;t mean they don&#039;t care or learn from it. I am convinced now as I was back with Clinton that there will be many young girls who will see this and will want to be just like this girl. Look at porn it became somewhat mainstream about 10 years ago with Jenna Jaimeson all over TV and young girls couldn&#039;t wait to turn 18 so they can go into the porn business because it was glamorised. <br /><br />BACK to spitzer<br />Last night i heard a great conspericy theory and this is for you all the Bush haters.<br />Turns out Spitzer&#039;s pending lawsuit against the predatory lending done by the banks was going to hurt the economy and Bush&#039;s billionare friends so the FED started looking into spitzer&#039;s affairs because of that. The day the news about him came out a Spitzer article was going to be published in the washingtom post so the decided to come out with the news right there to get rid of him.<br />the day the news came out the bank stocks jumped...mmmmm.<br />I am not into conspiracies but i got to say this one make some sense to me because I never bought the reason they gave that they thought he was being blackmailed.

Truth is no President should get credit OR attacked for the economy, it&#039;s not reality. President Clinton had little to do with the 90&#039;S economy, he lucked into a&nbsp; surplus as a result of the end of&nbsp; the Cold War. It was helped along with huge&nbsp; cuts in Military, but, we ended&nbsp; up paying for&nbsp; it when we were caught&nbsp; with our pants&nbsp; down. Also, the DOT.COM , ENRON economy was built on paper, not actual&nbsp; growth.&nbsp; The Oil that was to pay for this war can only come about with stability. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I do not believe the Resident has been preoccupied with the war.&nbsp; In fact, I do not think he really is too preoccupied with anything.&nbsp; What in the world would he get credit for?&nbsp; Creating an absolute mess of things?&nbsp; I still cannot understand why we are there.&nbsp; I do not believe that anything good will come of this.&nbsp; It is a bit of a pipedream; a very costly one.<br /><br />I am not referring to any surplus in my post.&nbsp; I am talking about what is going on today.&nbsp; We are receiving resumes from professionals for bellmen positions at the hotel.&nbsp; Something has gone terribly wrong.<br /><br />I recall Bush taking credit for a strong economy.&nbsp; Now that it is going south, he needs to take responsibility.<br /><br />

I think Bush can take credit&nbsp; for not allowing the nation to descend&nbsp; into chaos after 9/11, even as the&nbsp; economy had been slowing down a full year before&nbsp; the attacks&nbsp; and the DOT.COM ENRON economy had many people lose their&nbsp; jobs. I know&nbsp; I had to shift my focus and many more folks who I knew who had a&nbsp; career&nbsp; in the Military were let go in the early 1990&#039;s, even as&nbsp; we were being attacked throughout the 1990&#039;s. We are in Iraq, because&nbsp; Saddam had invaded&nbsp; Kuwait,signed a cease-fire he repeatedly violated, and was threatening&nbsp; the worlds&nbsp; Oil supply&nbsp; in 1991 The signed&nbsp; cease-fire, he repeatedly violated throughout&nbsp; the 1990&#039;s&nbsp; was part of a process&nbsp; of having sanctions&nbsp; removed against him even as he was seeking&nbsp; to rearm himself&nbsp; again. Further, we had just&nbsp; been attacked,although, Saddam had no operational&nbsp; ties with those who&nbsp; attacked us, he did have ties to terror organisations he supported&nbsp; in the region. Saddam, sanctionless, while we were&nbsp; in Afghan and in a base&nbsp; in Saudi would&nbsp; have been a way worse situation, with Iran on one side and Saddam on the other, leading to a larger&nbsp; conflict we couldn&#039;t afford&nbsp; with this downsized Military. <br /><br />Nothing good will come of it, if we leave too soon, and our allies, many Muslims, who want to live&nbsp; a&nbsp; quiet, more modern life, wil be overwhelmed and&nbsp; with Iran and it&#039;s Govt. the main sponsor&nbsp; of&nbsp; Islamic-terror groups, we will have&nbsp; a much larger war. Iraq, Afghan was the least we could&nbsp; do, and it is costly, but, it could have been and could be worse, if we don&#039;t follow up. <br /><br />Every P&#039;Resident&nbsp; likes&nbsp; to take credit for good news, in any part of the Govt, although Bush wil never&nbsp; get credit for anything from a&nbsp; mostly hostile&nbsp; press. Clinton took credit&nbsp; for the &#039;boom&#039; in 90&#039;s, but, certainly was not blamed when it was revealed it was&nbsp; mostly &#039;paper.&#039; Capitalism runs&nbsp; in cycles, if any part of the Govt. can affect the economy it&#039;s&nbsp; Congress. The classic struggle of the Presidents&nbsp; cutting increases&nbsp; in spending, while Congress increase the amount&nbsp; spent. Trillions&nbsp; are spent on civilian programs, certainly far more&nbsp; than the Defense Budget, especially&nbsp; since&nbsp; the 1990&#039;s it was cut in half, but, when a situation like 9/11 or worse comes along, you end up spending more&nbsp; and the Military can&#039;t be built up overnight. The least of our global worries will be the economy, if we abandon our allies&nbsp; in that region, like we did in Afghan in the 1990&#039;s. It will affect us here in ways we couldn&#039;t imagine.

I think Saddam was a terrible dictator and in many ways the Iraqis will be better off when all is said and done, I feel like our time, soldier&#039;s lives and tax money could have been better spent actually going after terrorists that are a bigger threat to the US.
