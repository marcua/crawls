				Hey,<br /><br />I wanted to see if there are any other PS122 parents on the board. We&#039;re newbies to the school and I am curious about a few things:<br /><br />How do you like the school? <br /><br />Do your kids have recess/PE? (our kindergartener seems to only have exercise at the Champions after school program).<br /><br />What do you think fo the principal?<br /><br />Anything to watch out for?<br /><br />I was kind of surprised myself about the recess thing. But I&#039;ve also noticed some hazards on the playground that badly need repair.<br /><br />I&#039;m also much more used to having strong interaction with the school from my son&#039;s preschool. I knew all the kids in his class of 24 and all the parents and the teachers quite well. Here, it&#039;s like we&#039;re dropping him off in a black box.<br /><br />Anyone out there?

				Hey there, I have no affiliation with PS 122, however, I am a teacher with the DOE.&nbsp; You may find Inside Schools (http://www.insideschools.org/fs/school_profile.php?id=877) useful.&nbsp; It is an independent site from the DOE about NYC Public Schools.&nbsp; I do know that the middle school is top notch with most, if not all, students getting double 4s on the State Tests.&nbsp; I am not all that familiar with the elementary program.

				Funny you mention insideschools..<br /><br />We moved here form Hawaii this summer and I used that site and its maps to rent an apartment. So I was aware of 122&#039;s reputation and it was a deciding factor. <br /><br />I also saw there that in the past there have been some complaints about the very tests the kids get double 4&#039;s on. That was a bit off-putting. I taught eighth grade in the public schools in Hawaii, at have seen teaching to the test in action. 122 also has a gifted program, which I can (not so modestly) say my son would be once he&#039;s in second grade. I also know there are some concerns and opinions out there about perceived elitism between the programs.<br /><br />So there&#039;s pluses and minuses. Good test scores, but no warm fuzzies. But hey, it&#039;s two weeks into the year. Let&#039;s see how it goes. I&#039;ll be in the PTA and hopefully there are some frank and honest voices there (not just cheerleading for the principal).<br /><br />

				I&#039;m not a parent but I am a graduate of 122&#039;s Academy (from 6th through 8th grade).&nbsp; I thought it was the best possible experience that I could have had for those years.&nbsp; It truly focused on getting into a good high school and I thought the teachers were some of the best that I&#039;ve had in my whole life.

				Your first impressions are pretty accurate: 122 is great academically, but not so good at&nbsp; what you’re calling “warm fuzzies.”<br /><br />One&nbsp; note about the gifted program: Although it’s located at 122, it’s a district-wide program. This&nbsp; means that a kid who starts out in PS 122 has the same chance of being admitted as a kid from anywhere else in Astoria, LIC, Sunnyside, Woodside, or Jackson Heights<br />

				we&#039;re *just* in their catchment area, and so i was delighted when i saw how academically strong they were. then i heard through the parent grapevine that because they have so many special programs, just because you&#039;re in their catchment area doesn&#039;t mean you get to attend. <br /><br />yeah, yeah, my kid is only three, but i still feel rising panic about the whole education thing...<br /><br />and when i&#039;ve tried emailing questions i have heard nothing back, so i&#039;m really at a loss. a friend who&#039;s a teacher elsewhere in the district said just go in and grab someone by the collar, but i&#039;m shy and don&#039;t want to get a label of being a troublesome parent. (both my in-laws and my mother are teachers. good first impressions are important to me...)

				<br />You won&#039;t hear from anyone. They are not good at the whole &quot;communication&quot; thing that I&#039;ve noticed. They have the supply and there&#039;s a lot of demand, so it&#039;s a little like the whole Lily Tomlin as phone operator thing.<br /><br />If you are in the zone, and you can be sure by calling 311, then no need to panic. Their gifted program starts at grade 2, so you don&#039;t have to worry about programs.<br /><br />If you are looking for prek, tho, i have no idea about any of that.<br />

				My daughter is in 1st grade as PS 122, she started last year for Kindergarten and was in the Champions program.&nbsp; I volunteer at the school as a Learning Leader, as that is the only way to participate in the school day outside of the occasional PTA programs.<br /><br />The school is very rigorous academically, and the teachers are extremely motivated to make sure everyone is up to the state standards.&nbsp; That means there is a lot of support for students who are struggling as well as for the gifted students in the academy. They offer in-school tuturing (that is where I volunteer), and Saturday school to help those who need extra attention to get up to state standards.&nbsp; The curriculum is challenging, and the school seems to get quite a bit of teaching support from Teacher&#039;s college. There is a debate among the parents about &quot;teaching to the test&quot;, but I have to say that my daughter has done very well and loved both her teachers and is reading at the 3rd grade level--and yes, I am bragging.<br /><br />That being said, there is not a focus on physical activity, and I think it needs to be addressed, esp. as the children are pushed pretty hard and have no place to let off steam.&nbsp; This is mostly due to logistics, there are 1500 students in the school, with one lunch room and 2 gyms.&nbsp; The children have one recess for about 20 minutes after lunch.&nbsp; They have three lunch periods to accomodate all the children. Moving 500 students per lunch period up and down the stairs is a lesson in logistics, and so the response has been to keep them in one area as much as possible.&nbsp; <br /><br />When my daughter was in Kindergarten, they took their recess on the small playground.&nbsp; Now that she is in 1st grade, the children play in the enclosed area in the center of the U shape of the school.&nbsp; They are constricted in their play to Duck, Duck, Goose most days, which means even if they are getting outside that day, they are spending most of the time sitting on the ground unless they are the occasional Goose.&nbsp; If the weather is unpleasant--rain, cold or excessive heat--the children spend their recess in the auditorium watching a movie.&nbsp; &nbsp;I had asked about the gyms and having the students move there instead of the auditorium, but again, moving 500 children up the stairs would take up almost all of their recess time and they would have very little time to play.<br /><br />Each class has gym once a week, which means that the children do not get any real physical activity in 6 hours. <br />They can&#039;t make the day any longer in order to comply with the union rules, and I don&#039;t want my daughter to miss out on Spanish, computer, art and music, which are also offered once per week to make more time for gym.<br /><br />Like you, I enrolled my daughter in Champions hoping that she would at least have a chance to run around, but last year the Kindergarten program spent most of the year sitting at tables doing crafts, rather than playing in the gym during their scheduled gym time.&nbsp; The reason given was that they didn&#039;t have enough staff to watch the children in the gym.&nbsp; I did not enroll my daughter in Champions this year, as I work part-time and could pick her up, as it seemed like the main goal was crowd control for the younger grades, as opposed to teaching any of the sports and arts mentioned in the material.&nbsp; I went to all the parent events and picked up my daughter at different times to observe the program, and I do think it is a good choice for the older children, like 2nd grade on up. And, of course, many parents do not have a choice and an afterschool program is a real benefit.<br /><br />I was hoping to bring up the lack of physical activity at the next PTA meeting, but I didn&#039;t want to just focus on a problem without offering a solution--any ideas?&nbsp; <br /><br />RE: communicating with the school--I always get a response if I talk to Judy Thomas or Ms. Aprea.&nbsp; They can be hard to reach, because they spend most of their time in the halls of the school (more so Ms. Aprea), but if I leave a message for either of them, they always call me back. <br /><br />Hope this helps!

Thanks for posting! <br /><br />I&#039;m at all the PTA meetings too. We should bring it up--we can&#039;t be expected to have all the answers, since we don&#039;t know the resources, options or other factors. All we have to do is be nice about it (trust me, I was a teacher once). So I&#039;ll bring it up this Thursday. I am glad they give the chance such great academic activities, but I don&#039;t want him to get out of shape for it.<br /><br />I have to say I am NOT impressed with Champions from what I have seen. My wife also has mixed feelings. We have noticed that the kids copy each other&#039;s homework there and we have to review the material with him again (he&#039;s not copying from the best student). If there were a better after school option that was either at the school or that could be relied on to pick him up, I&#039;d consider it. I would be more forgiving of the school&#039;s lack of physical activity if Champions truly picked up the slack.<br />

				My daughter is in her 3 year at PS122. We have loved the school and she has thrived very well academically. With the reccomendation of her 2 grade teacher, she will be testing in December for the Academy. With that being said, yes there is a problem with the lack of physical activity, and there are a few teachers Im not so keen on.&nbsp; <br /><br />The music program is great, however, the kids are told to get their own instruments as they are short on instruments (again a budget thing unfortunately). <br /><br />My daughter has also attended the Champions program for three years. When the cost is only $300.00 per year and every year they are scrambleing for funding, I don&#039;t know what people expect. Especially when there are no other after school options in the area. Either raise the rates (and I am a single mother.. but would be willing to pay more if it meant a better program), or people need to work harder to try to get funding via fundraisers, etc for the program. I truly believe its everyone trying to make a dollar out of .15. My daughter did Tennis at champions, and they also do an amazing show at the end of the year. Seriously last year, the dance show was like it was straight out of a dance school! I saw first hand the hard work that was put into that show by the children and the teachers and as usual it was amazing. <br />I KNOW if they had the funding, more would be done. Ms. Vazques has been helpful and amazing with us. My daughter absolutely adores her. They really do try so hard to do as much as they can for those kids.<br /><br />Without funding if we lose champions, what are working parents supposed to do? Is it better to have your child either be a latchkey kid or sit at home in front of the tube with a babysitter? Its truly in the best interests of the entire community to make sure champions succeeds.&nbsp; <br />No champions=kids with time on their hands while parents are working which also = trouble. Not to mention the after school jobs it gives to high school kids who work tutoring the children. <br /><br />As with any school, especially a PUBLIC school, it is a joint effort of the parents, the teachers, and the community together to make sure that the child succeeds.

				I think so. Its really a shame. Its sad that programs like champions are always the first to be in danger come funding time. I think they should do a sliding scale based on lunchforms but I think, although Im not positive, that champions cant because its not a public school program. I think its through the Sport and Arts program which is totally seperate. Believe it or not there are parents who complain about paying 300 a year. Insanity. I used to pay that per MONTH for aftercare in my childs old school and it was nowhere near what champions is. I do think if parents worked together to try to get more money to it, it would make a huge difference. Nothing is scarier than on your childs first day of school not knowing if there will be an after school program. And that happened two years ago. Thats how low the funding was. Its amazing what they do with that little money. Lots of parents inthe school work for champions including a few of my neighbors.. They really work their tushies off to get programs together for those kids. <br />

				Champions is not funded by the DOE, it is part of the non-profit group the Sports and Arts Foundation.&nbsp; Their funding comes directly from grants, and I thought they had been approved for a multi-year grant to fund all the PS 122 students for two years for a year-round program, covering school holidays as well as after school.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t heard anything about this grant, did it not come through?&nbsp; I think most parents would be willing to pay more, if it meant additional trained staff for homework help and active play for all students.<br /><br />I agree that Champions fills an immediate need for after school programs and has some very good points, esp. for the older kids, like tennis and the shows.&nbsp; But the dance show you mentioned does not include any of the smaller students, neither does the end of the year musical.&nbsp; The Kindergarten and first grade children do not get tennis instruction.&nbsp; Their only physical activity is the active play period in the gym or outside on the playground, so if they don&#039;t get that, they are adding 3 more hours of sitting down.&nbsp; The truth is that 300 of the 1500 PS 122 students are in Kindergarten and 1st grade, that is not reflected in the Champions programming. <br /><br />I know that the staff works very hard, but one of the main problems I see is there is not active oversight above the onsite program director, Mrs. Vasquez, who created the program (and employs her son as one of the physical education directors) so I would guess feels a huge sense of ownership, justifiably--to create a program from nothing and have to go begging each year requires a considerable amount of dedication.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think any parent wants to take away from the program, they only want a way to be heard.&nbsp; Champions does not answer to the principal or any other supervisor at PS 122, they answer to their CEO offsite. There is not a system to document and evaluate the program from the parents&#039; perspective and therefore have measurable outcomes, and frankly, I have seen a real resistance to putting a system like that in place.&nbsp; The Champions response to any gentle criticism is always that Champions is better than nothing, which only plays on parents&#039; fears. You don&#039;t have to throw the baby out with the bathwater.&nbsp; <br /><br />The truth is there are other organizations that offer free on-site afterschool programs, like the YMCAs, that are also funded by grants, so the choice is not Champions or nothing.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s either PS 84 or 85 that offers a virtual Y afterschool program.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t want to get rid of Champions, I just think that if Champions had a system in place to address parents&#039; concerns or some kind of parent representation similar to the role the PTA plays in the school, that would only help Champions by having dedicated parents for fundraising and other needed roles.&nbsp; And I my suggestion as a parent is that Champions has got to broaden their focus to the younger grades, esp. in homework help and physical activity.<br /><br />I will be at the PTA meeting on Thursday, so I&#039;ll defintely add my voice to the discussion of physical activity for all the students.<br /><br />

				Great!<br /><br />Thanks for posting.<br /><br />Champions did NOT get the grant. A note was sent home about it.<br /><br />Important habits are formed at this age, which is why Kindergarteners get homework. Being active is an important part of childhood as well.<br /><br />See you Thursday.<br />

				I hope you don&#039;t mind me posting - I am not a P.S. 122 parent but a parent who is considering having my 5th grader apply for the middle school Academy at 122.&nbsp; I have heard that the curriculum in the elementary Academy is very intense and one mother has told me that her children regularly stay up until 11 or 12 at night completing homework.&nbsp; I wonder if other parents have had this experience whether in the elementary or&nbsp; middle school Academy?&nbsp; Also is it true that the staff is unresponsive to questions or concerns from parents?&nbsp; I would love to hear opinions from parents.&nbsp; Thank you.

				Hi,<br /><br />I don&#039;t know much about the academy, but I understand it is a rigorous program and prepares kids for the top city high schools like hunter and bronx science, etc. The academy is something that is applied to, so the students don&#039;t necessarily come from the nearby neighborhood. I haven&#039;t met any academy parents that I know of. <br /><br />I have dealt mainly with the parent coordinator at the school, who is friendly and very helpful. <br /><br />That said if you don&#039;t meet her, it is not a particularly welcoming place. No warm fuzzies. If you don&#039;t get involved through field trips, pta or other volunteer work, you will see your kid&#039;s teacher probably four times in the year--two at parent teacher conferences, once on curriculum day and once at promotion ceremony. If you put in the effort, you can get inside and your experience will depend on the teachers your kids get, as is true at ANY school.<br /><br />I have heard some comments from other parents that the school does seem a little more welcoming thus far this year. Principal Mary Kojes retired at the end of last year (somewhat suddenly it seemed). The city hired one of the assistant principals to be principal (over what were probably a lot of very good candidates, given the school&#039;s rep). Among the parents I know, she is well respected.<br /><br />So that might be part of the change in atmosphere.<br />
