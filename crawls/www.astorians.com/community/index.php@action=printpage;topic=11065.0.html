				Now that I have a dog I&#039;ve been exploring many more streets in the nabe on our walks. <br /><br />The past week or so we&#039;ve walked into the most dee-vine honeysuckle scent with no vines in sight! I looked up to realize the fine odor emanates from the tree. I&#039;ve lived here most of my life and never noticed before but now that I know my nose seeks them out. I think it is a Linden of some kind. Does anyone know; I looked at the NYC Parks website but couldn&#039;t tell which are the ones in our hood? In any case, they ROCK.

				I wouldn&#039;t know what type of honeysuckle it is, although I do know that it sure smells great. One of the houses around the corner from me has a honeysuckle vine on their fence, and last week I noticed that they trimmed most of it down to practically nothing. What a waste! If I had seen that being done I would have taken some of it an propagated it to my garden. <br /><br />This is what they have:<br /><div align="center">(http://patsloan.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/honeysuckle.jpg)</div>

				It might be an American Linden (aka Basswood) tree.&nbsp; They are very popular street trees in NYC.&nbsp; We&#039;ve got one out our living room window that&#039;s flowering right now, and the scent is just amazing.&nbsp; Very fragrant - I&#039;d say lighter and more perfumey than honeysuckle -- less honeylike.<br /><br />I&#039;ve looked for a picture online, but I can&#039;t find a really good one.&nbsp; In any event ours is a young one -- the leaves are rather large, and almost rounded, and grow linearly off branches.&nbsp; The flowers are smaller, and yellow, and are kind of under the leaves.&nbsp; Very dense foliage.

				I&#039;ve been getting a particularly sweet whiff of something from a tree near 34th and broadway. Not quite honeysuckle like, but very nice. <br />

				I&#039;ve noticed the lovely fragrance all over the hood, too and was trying to figure out what tree it was. I remember the fragrance from when I used to walk with my Dad as a little girl and him referring to it as lipa (in Russian). Sure enough, I just looked up lipa in Russian and it is a Linden Tree, like Lanseaux thought.

				edava beat me to it...if it&#039;s June it&#039;s the Lindens scenting the air. They&#039;re usually the last of the trees to bloom.

				Wow! I noticed it too this morning when I was in the park. The scent was especially strong while jogging around the track (opposite the Triboro Bridge side). I was jogging, breathing deeply and my head was swiveling around looking for obvious blooms, but there were none in sight. I don&#039;t know what those huge trees are called right next to the track on that side, but they are very healthy looking (not like the plane[?] trees) and perhaps those are the ones in bloom with very small inconspicuous flowers?

				my old lady neighbor used to have the whole gate between me and her yard covered with honeysuckle.&nbsp; i used to love to take one from it, pull the little part of it and gently pull the honey suckle out and eat it.&nbsp; but it ended when she either died or was put in a nursing home and the new neighbors tore it down.&nbsp; oh well.&nbsp; &nbsp;:|

				Yeah it&#039;s the Linden trees, the trees have blossoms every year in June, and you can smell them even from a distance. Enjoy them now, the scent should be gone by July 4th.

				I was trying to figure out that very odor at the little playground behind the Vallone School when I was there with my daughter.&nbsp; The only thing I could figure was a tree that I saw in the Beer Garden.&nbsp; Per AJTNYC&#039;s link, it&#039;s definitely a Linden. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure which one I love smelling more, the Linden or the fryolator... mmmmmmmm

				Yup!&nbsp; We&#039;re just rolling out the little ones!<br /><br />And to keep this on topic, I noted today that there are also Linden trees in the playground near the Astoria Blvd. subway station.
