				So, what little stores in your neighborhood do you love?&nbsp; Greek, Italian, Arab, etc?&nbsp; Those smaller &quot;ethinic&quot; grocery stores where you can get interesting products from around the globe.&nbsp; And what are these fabulous taste treats?&nbsp; I know they&#39;re not all little (Titan Foods comes to mind), but they are smaller than Key Food, for instance.&nbsp; This weekend I went into J &amp; T Greek and Italian Market on Ditmars and had an interesting chat with the owner, whose been at this business for over 45 years.&nbsp; Engaging guy from Turkey, who has a ton of food knowledge in his head, and is happy to share it.<br /><br />I&#39;ve gotten a lot of info from ChowHound, but would love to hear from you all on Astorians.

				That guy has a little cat that rolls around on the sidewalk, usually while he is supervising it. One day I saw it sitting under a car and he wasn&#39;t out there, so I went in and told him the cat was outside and under a car. He asked me to bring it inside. I was amused by this and went out there to attempt to get the cat. He followed me, and by that point the cat had emerged. He yelled, &quot;Thunder! (I think that&#39;s what he said, the cat&#39;s name) Come here!!&quot; And the cat shamefully ran towards him. It was cute.

				Oh my gosh, I want Jonathan to post in this thread. Please give me all the stats on your favorite places on 30th Avenue so I can print it out and put it on my fridge!<br /><br />My only contribution is Mediterranean Foods on 34th St. just south of 30th ave. It took me forever to finally poke my head in there, but when I finally did I loved it. So much cool Greek stuff, cheese, olives (if you like those), etc.

				I like the local bakeries for bread.&nbsp; I have gotten the Country White bread at Joanne&#39;s on Steinway and 28th Ave.........really good.&nbsp; There&#39;s nothing <br />like freshly baked bread........beats the heck out of most of the stuff in the grocery stores.&nbsp; I like the Mango Nectar that you can get everywhere here.......in<br />the midwest, I don&#39;t think I ever saw that stuff.&nbsp; It&#39;s tasty!

				I like the little Bangladeshi place across Ditmars from J &amp; T (which I also like).&nbsp; There are a lot of great finds there for dried spices and herbs, dried beans, that sort of thing.&nbsp; Also Bangladeshi/Indian/Pakistani snacks and condiments.&nbsp; I recently got mango pickle there -- the very salty pickled condiment you get in Indian restaurants - it&#39;s got chili, fenugreek, fennel, etc. in it.&nbsp; Very tasty.&nbsp; (Total aside - I love the translation on this particular jar -- the ingredients are listed in a number of languages, and the French translation comes out as &quot;Mango in gasoline&quot; - they chose <em>p√©trole </em>instead of <em>huile </em>when translating the word <em>oil</em>.)<br /><br />I also love the end caps at Trade Fair (Ditmars/38th).&nbsp; Each one is a different country/region, and you can find some interesting things.<br /><br />Mediterannean Foods II, in the same weird shopping center as Artopolis (31st St. near 23rd Ave.), is also good for all the Greek stuff.&nbsp; They also have frozen quail, for some reason.

				<strong>Heliopolis</strong> is a little deli near Ommonia on Broadway (at 33rd). It used to be dingy but in the last year, these Indian brothers have taken it over and transformed the space into a bright, welcoming interior.<br /><br />Its got lower Astoria&#39;s best selection of belgian ales (all the Lindemann&#39;s lambics!), homemade dips (the tzaziki and baba ganoush are really good), and sandwiches and the Indian brothers make a pretty darn good spanakopita. Of course, a mini olive bar and all the nuts in big jars in the front. There are also exotic condiments like &quot;Heinz Exotic Sauce&quot; on the shelves in the back. Their stock of&nbsp; Mediterranean brand pita is always the freshest, I find.

				I tried the new French bakery/patisserie on Broadway by 34th? &nbsp;Very good baguette. &nbsp;Didn&#39;t not try the desserts. &nbsp;<br /><br />30th ave:<br />Eleniki? for produce between 32nd / 33rd streets. &nbsp;very good selection &nbsp;and price.<br /><br />Grocer/produce corner of 35th and 30th ave. &nbsp;Excellent produce, Some interesting exotic produce choices. Ritter&#39;s chocolates. They are starting to carry some gourmet items such as goat cheese, spreads, soy products, etc...<br /><br />Mediterranean on 34th just south of 30th ave for all things Greek. About 12 feta&#39;s, all types of olives, spreads, dips, smoked fish, tinned items, syrups, honeys, etc...<br /><br />Astoria bakery 33rd/34th streets for great range of breads.<br /><br />Olympus Bagels &nbsp;33rd/ 34th streets. &nbsp;Bagels. very good.<br /><br />Dave and Tony Salumeria for fresh mozz, brick oven breads from &nbsp;Brooklyn, pastas, sausage, ravioli, Prosciutto and Italian cheeses/meats. Ask for Joe or Ralph.<br />by corner of 36th street.<br /><br />Franks bakery for decent croissants, very good Italian bread, very very good pignoli cookies and meringue cookies. <br />corner of 36th street<br /><br />Sai Organics for all things organic, very good coffee, fresh made juicings. And he is a nice man.<br />36th/37th streets<br /><br />Marino and sons for fish. Charlie does the buying at the fish market every morning. If you need something special ask him. All the guys there are one family and Yankees fans (keep it in mind) <br />36th/37th streets<br /><br />International meats. 36th/37th streets<br />John &amp; John are the owners so that makes it easy. &nbsp;They have the cleanest best butcher shop anywhere. &nbsp;They also supply most of the kebob stands/shops in NY. &nbsp;Great selection, very helpful and will cut to order.&nbsp; They also carry Mediterranean brand pita (blue label is best), its the best pita every!<br /><br />Manos papaya corner of Steinway and 30th ave for mango/OJ/banana smoothies.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Family Market on Broadway between 29th and 30th--a Japanese convenience store.&nbsp; They have prepared foods, frozen foods, cookies, crackers, soy sauce, etc., etc., etc.&nbsp; Plus, they have video rentals (all in Japanese, of course)

				Oooh, I love Family Market!&nbsp; I&#39;ve been telling myself I need to stop there for some daifuku.<br /><br />I&#39;ve actually compiled quite a bit of information in the past few days (hooray for google spreadsheets!).&nbsp; It is satisfying.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, this town&#39;s strengths are in Greek, Italian, and Middle Eastern foodstuffs.&nbsp; Mexican is up there, too, but harder to track down.&nbsp; South Asian makes nary a blip on the radar, although I&#39;m curious to check out this Bangladeshi place on Ditmars.&nbsp; And does anyone know if the Spanish grocery on 31st Ave is still in business?<br /><br />And, thinking back to a previous thread, there has been talk in the past elsewhere of International Meat Market having carried organic meats at one time or another.&nbsp; The poster recommended that people who want the stuff should speak up there, and perhaps if enough people ask, more organic meats will find their way there.&nbsp; <br />

				Looking forward to your spreadsheet, Meg!<br /><br />The Bangladeshi place is quite good, if small! They have a good selection of daal, rice, pickle, oil, and a decent selection of spices. They also have frozen chapatis and homemade frozen samosas that are excellent. And I believe they have (frozen) halaal meat. I go there if I&#39;m cooking Indian and need a few things but don&#39;t need to make the trek to Jackson Heights...<br /><br />Speaking of organic meats, the butcher under the Ditmars stop sells organic (Murray&#39;s brand, and cheaper than Key Foods) whole chickens and chicken breast cutlets. I rather like that place, although I found their steaks (New York Strip) to be inconsistent in quality when I was getting them for a while...

				Hey, I&#39;ll take any and all recommendations for food stores, groceries, delis, and the like.&nbsp; <br /><br />A big part of this &quot;research project&quot; has to with my wanting to get to know my neighborhood a bit better food-wise, and connect to the strong ethnic identities that have defined Astoria for so many years, and their established food traditions (and who are the culinary artists/craftspeople out there).&nbsp; It&#39;s very exciting learning where the amazing Greek yoghurt is, where the pastries are, where to get great meat and fish.&nbsp; And if a place does a particular thing <em>par excellence</em>.&nbsp; For so many years, food shopping for me meant going to the supermarket; I&#39;m interested in changing that.

				Thanks, annie!<br /><br />Sneak preview comment:&nbsp; I have discovered some great sounding taco places in more central and southern Astoria, which is pretty cool.&nbsp; <br /><br /><em>[I wish I knew the areas south of 31st Ave better!&nbsp; I think a number of field trips are in my future.]</em>

				Maybe we could use some of this info to start that &quot;official Astoria website&quot; -- a short hand guide of stores and their good stuff?<br /><br />I&#39;d be interested in helping that happen.<br /><br />Stores, restaurants, bars, cafes, grocery stores, cool stuff...

				Megc - Calista was the store in the location before Heliopolis, before that it was El Greco - it&#39;s the same space, though with a slightly different inventory.

				I like Acropolis Meats.&nbsp; When I ask for ground lamb, they take lamb shoulder and grind it fresh right then.

				The mexican place I mentioned is called Lupita Grocery.&nbsp; b/w 31st and 29th Sts on 21st Ave.&nbsp; The butcher at the place by the Ditmars stop recommended Lupita for the Chorizo.

				Thanks everyone!<br /><br />An update:&nbsp; I checked out the Bangladeshi grocery on Ditmars, and wow, is it cool!&nbsp; Lots of spices, whole and ground, different flours, daals, things in jars, and South Asian sweets made locally.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also checkout the place next to Mezzo Mezzo, and yes, they are very nice there.&nbsp; Love the olive selection, too.<br /><br />It&#39;s so great to be learning this stuff.&nbsp; So often, recommendations are centered around restaurants in the area, which is great, but I&#39;m loving learning about the hidden food shopping treasures in town.<br /><br />Keep the info coming!
