				Most politically minded people are at best, slacktivists.&nbsp; For example, in the primary and special run-off election, hardly anyone bothered to show up and vote, even though the primary is when there is real political change.&nbsp; In the general election, everyone votes, but by then, the outcome is already assumed.&nbsp; On average, people do not campaign or donate for candidates they like, or join a political club, or even attend a community board meeting.<br /><br />The local political machine and the local media are in perfect lockstep.&nbsp; Even though print media is dead for anyone with a computer, the base of voters tends to be seniors and immigrants and less likely to be wired.&nbsp; I have said time and again how the Western Queens Gazette has never reported anything critical about the elected leaders, police activities and officials and local organizations in Astoria.&nbsp; It presents a perfect Potemkin village where everything is right and just and we should just be happy to live here.<br /><br />Lynn Serpe and Jerry Khan are earnest, but they have no chance of winning.&nbsp; The problem is that people vote for their favorite team; if they are registered Democrats, they vote Democrat, if they are registered Republicans, they vote Republican and make no real effort to research the issues and the candidates.&nbsp; The irony is that Astoria is overwhelmingly Democrat and generally about as conservative as Republicans. <br /><br />Bill Thompson and his campaign is so anemic that he comes off as an empty suit.&nbsp; Bloomberg&#039;s campaign is a marketing juggernaut and it is likely he will take the third term.&nbsp; A few weeks ago, I asked a Bloomberg campaign worker canvassing inside my apartment building and taking notes of all the names on the mailboxes to leave.&nbsp; I have since received a whole collection of Bloomberg leaflet mailings.&nbsp; It speaks to how money buys political office.<br /><br />

				The word out on the street is that Junior doesn&#039;t even live in the district, though, like most clubhouse hacks, he maintains a &quot;residence&quot; here. Notice that for all the achievements he and Senior are allegedly responsible for, they couldn&#039;t get the Mayor to pressure Con Ed to get the power back on three summers ago, which implies that they are indeed power<em>less</em>. I&#039;m thinking that all the local political offices in this district should be voluntary, much like the old school boards used to be. If they can&#039;t get adequate services for the district, if they aren&#039;t taken seriously at City Hall, why are we paying them?

				Yes, I&#039;d be delighted: Walk up or down 23rd Avenue (it doesn&#039;t matter; since the universe has no center: up may be down, backward might me forward,&nbsp; and vice versa). Notice the graffiti strewn buildings, the cracked sidewalks, the incessant 24/7 traffic jams,&nbsp; and oh yes, one way to know that there are lots and lots of people living illegally in 2-family houses in dorm-like conditions is by the amount of garbage piled outside.

				yo dude, the conditions you describe can fit any given block in NYC.&nbsp; 23ave doesn&#039;t stand out more than any other street in astoria concering these issues.&nbsp; just off the top of my head, i can think of other streets for each condition you describe where each condition listed is worse.&nbsp;

				Thanks for the links in this thread.<br /><br />If I throw out everything, I still wonder when does Manhattan have a blackout like what NW Queens suffered.&nbsp; &nbsp;:|<br />[also we can vote yes on the ballot this election to support energy transmission to help a few upstate]<br /><br />Thank goodness our locale has seen more reliable energy since then.<br /><br />Should I increase my dose of cynicism. For the most part, when voters say they support candidate x, and when the incumbent says he supports the incumbent mayor, I take it in good part at face value. Maybe he likes the administration&#039;s police leadership. Maybe educational policies. Possibly a number of things.<br /><br />And I would agree that Democrats have super home field advantage. Preferred placement on the ballot thanks to the Spitzer steamroller.<br />Still there are, if even a few, activists working hard for their candidates. Maybe there is some paid outreach too.<br /><br />As for conservative democrats, I find quite a few republicans registered Democrat for reasons noted in other threads.<br />But dont you expect this time there will be more Green votes than Conservative votes?<br /><br />No reason to assume that voters are only going to pull levers for just one party - the Democratic party. Do you consider the incumbent mayor to still be a democrat?

Whether PV Jr. had anything to do with it&#039;s location in Astoria, I can&#039;t say either way, but it is one of the few that is not overcrowded and has a principal who knows how to run these programs. <br /><br />It&#039;s great that it&#039;s here, but I wouldn&#039;t say this is a significant achievement on his part.

I&#039;ve enjoyed the give and take, but, because it&#039;s so easy to &quot;rant, &quot;&nbsp; what began as a serious debate has devolved into a sniping match among the computer literate. The loss of a neighborhood I loved and still live in is too serious a matter for the kind of silliness that denies reality in favor of &quot;looking on the bright side&quot; and other assorted cliche&#039;s and stock phrases. Nonetheless, just so that no one accuses me of being a&nbsp; whiner or a &quot;naysayer&quot; I want to relate a conversation that took place this past week between me and a staff member from a local politician&#039;s office regarding a quality of life complaint I filed.<br /><br />Staff person: &quot;I&#039;m calling from .......Office regarding the graffiti situation.&quot;<br /><br />Me: That was a while ago.

I called the local police precinct and they sent a squad car to my apartment, which was embarrassing. <br /><br />Staff person: &quot;When you say &#039;up and down&#039; 23rd Avenue, can you be more specific?&quot;<br /><br />Me. How specific do you want me to be? Why doesn&#039;t he [the politician in question] take a ride up and down the block and see it for himself. It&#039;s bad enough he couldn&#039;t do anything to get the lights back on last year. It seems like the least he can do.&quot; <br /><br />Staff person: &quot;Well, it&#039;s not like we can just go and clean up graffiti, if it&#039;s on private property.&quot;<br /><br />So much for civic involvement.<br /><br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />in this thread:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=16344.msg182830.html#msg182830">Quote from: oliver klosoff on October 17, 2009, 04:51:20 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">can you please explain exactly what about 23 ave you are referring to?&nbsp; i think your description is a little off there...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=16344.msg182835.html#msg182835">Quote from: John b on October 17, 2009, 08:37:29 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Yes, I&#039;d be delighted: Walk up or down 23rd Avenue (it doesn&#039;t matter; since the universe has no center: up may be down, backward might me forward,&nbsp; and vice versa).

				No, not the South Bronx; the <em>North</em> Bronx.<br /><br />And that&#039;s a lovely picture: no doubt it&#039;ll inspire the new urbanists and hipsters from the Midwest who see Bloomberg&#039;s New York and Vallone&#039;s Astoria as theme parks in which to live out their urban fantasies. <br /><br />
