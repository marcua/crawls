				Succession, a full evening retrospective work, channels Ms. Green’s nearly two decades as a pillar of the dance community in New York City.<br /><br />Valerie Green/Dance Entropy presents Succession, an evening-length solo work incorporating both new choreography and past work spanning the past decade. Danced by Valerie Green, who is the artistic director and choreographer for Dance Entropy, this one-women show channels Ms. Green’s own personal life cycle. It also represents her final turn in a full-length solo, after nearly two decades in New York City.<br /><br />Succession is rich in texture, intertwining extreme explorations of human behavior while exhibiting raw power mixed with delicate human vulnerability. To create the 45-minute show, Ms. Green has thread together segments from her body of solo works to create a life cycle journey. Succession starts with Ms. Green channeling the fluid movements of a fetus in the amniotic sac. Ms. Green explores interim life stages by exposing a window into the immediacy of emotions. The cyclical journey continues with a metaphor for transformation, aging, and the disruption of order amidst an installation of hundreds of flowers. Succession concludes in a rite of passion, with a spiritual burial of the past followed by a symbolic rebirth in the planting of oneself. This powerful solo work, executed through cunning sensuality, relies on exposing aspects of the archetypal female, all sourced from the deep recesses of the character&#039;s psyche.<br /><br />&quot;Articulate, fearless, intelligent dancing.&quot; says Chris Dohse, Village Voice<br /><br />Valerie Green/Dance Entropy Presents<br />“Succession” A One Woman Retrospective Odyssey<br />Choreography and performance by Valerie Green<br /><br /><br />March 13 &amp; 14 at 8pm, March 15 at 5pm<br />Green Space<br />37-24 24th Street, Suite 301<br />Long Island City, NY 11101<br /><br /><br />Admission:<br />Presale tickets $17 available at www.GreenSpaceStudio.org (http://www.GreenSpaceStudio.org).<br />Tickets at the door $20.<br /><br /><br />www.DanceEntropy.org (http://www.DanceEntropy.org)<br />www.GreenSpaceStudio.org (http://www.GreenSpaceStudio.org)<br /><br /><br />Directions:<br />N (local) or Q (express) to Queensboro Plaza&nbsp; (one stop from Manhattan)<br />7 to Queensboro Plaza&nbsp; (four stops from Manhattan)<br />After exiting the train, take the NORTH pedestrian bridge.
