			Hi everybody,<br /><br />I ran across freeipods.com today as I was surfing the net at work. Anyway, it is legit - you just have to sign up for one of their offers, and refer 5 people to sign up as well then you get the free iPod.<br /><br />I signed up for the 2 week trial for Blockbuster Online (pretty much like Netflix). You can cancel anything you sign up for at any time (of course after the free trials, etc.).<br /><br />It looked fishy to me at first but then I saw this article on it, and so I am trying it out. I will let you Astorians know if I got my iPod in a few weeks. ;) <br /><br />Here is another article:<br /><br />http://www.nyunews.com/features/campuslife/8427.html<br /><br />If you do decide to sign up please use the freeipods.com link either here or at the top of my posting.
