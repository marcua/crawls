				i just got my new zagat&#039;s today and was looking at some of the entire city&#039;s top listings, and a couple of astoria spots shined through...<br /><br />in best greek for the entire city, taverna kyclades was rated nearly the very best...the only location in queens, as well as one of the best seafood places.<br /><br />in the listings by the location, astoria/lic was broken out separately from the rest of queens, and the top places are (broken out by similar ratings):<br /><br />-trattoria l&#039;incontro<br /><br />-taverna kyclades<br />-piccola venezia<br />-tournesol (in lic - french)<br /><br />-christos<br />-agnanti<br /><br /><br />outside of our nabe, but in queens, sripraphai also did pretty well overall.&nbsp; i thought to mention since i know this is also a fave with a lot of people from this site.&nbsp; actually, in addition to a few of the other categories it&#039;s listed in, in the thai category, it is listed as #1.

				There seems to be a lot of inertia in Zagat&#039;s ratings. None of those listed restaurants have been open for less than five years. Newer places that get equally good reviews from places like Chowhound include Philoxenia and Bistro 33. <br /><br />Is Kabab Cafe listed?<br /><br />

				There&#039;s an intrinsic problem with their ratings, which is that the people who rate Kyklades are NOT the same people who rate Michael Psilakis&#039; modern Greek restaurants in Manhattan. The assumption underlying Zagat is that there is a population of people with opinions and that people go to restaurants randomly. That is empirically false. There is a correlation between the types of restaurants people like and the types of restaurants they go to (and rate). So you end up with noncomparable ratings. <br /><br />They have enough information in their database of ratings to do a much better job. You should be able to log into Zagat.com, rate a bunch of restaurants, and have personalized, predicted ratings for a restaurant *for you*, along the lines of what Netflix does. And they should be able to convert the numerical ratings that they get from everyone to rankings, and then use those to recreate more accurate ratings. The Zagats may be clever entrepreneurs and foodies, but they&#039;re not statisticians...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=12840.msg156612.html#msg156612">Quote from: neo11 on October 30, 2008, 11:36:06 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Elias Corner 22<br />Fatty&#039;s 22<br />Watawa 25<br /><br />Kyklades is actually tied for the second-highest Greek restaurant in NYC with 25 points, something which I feel is a bit inflated.&nbsp; It&#039;s a good restaurant but I think hardly representative of the quality or variety of Greek cuisine.&nbsp; The food is very good there, but I dunno, 25 seems like a bit much, especially when so many other good restaurants were ranked lower.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I feel like the ratings are overwhelmingly positive for every restaurant, to the point of being relatively useless. With sites like yelp, I&#039;m not really sure why Zagat even needs to exist anymore. A hard copy of Zagat is nice if you need to get the address or phone number of a place quickly, but the one paragraph reviews are pretty generic and of limited utility, to me at least.

				i think zagat&#039;s is much more helpful than those online sites.&nbsp; i&#039;ve used both, and in a pinch, the online ones are ok.&nbsp; but i just feel like some of the reviews on the online services are either fixed (with false praise) or not informational enough for my taste.&nbsp; and, usually if i can, i&#039;ll cross-reference zagat&#039;s with the online sites in order to get an even fuller picture.<br /><br />i happen to be someone who will annually submit my reviews and ratings to zagats.&nbsp; in return they send me a free copy.&nbsp; i&#039;ve done it for a few years now.&nbsp; i don&#039;t remember how i got the offer.&nbsp; i must have replied to something and now that contact me every year to see if i want to participate again.&nbsp; i don&#039;t work for zagats and outside of the free copy, and the occasional request to fill out other surveys,&nbsp; i have no other connection to them.<br /><br />the restaurant ratings are totally unsolicited as you are the ones who choose which places to rate.&nbsp; admittedly if you go to some small place where tons of other people aren&#039;t chiming in about, then it doesn&#039;t make the list (which does suck, but how can they rate EVERY single restaurant in the city, every single year).&nbsp; plus, there are some listings that do well, but then there&#039;s something saying that the poll number was so low that it may be somewhat inaccurate.<br /><br />i don&#039;t know.&nbsp; i just feel like you can&#039;t argue too much with some well established &quot;institutions&quot;.

				My family has been using Zagat for 15+ years.&nbsp; And this year the ratings are just horrible.&nbsp; Something happened to this years ratings for they are very inacurate and have become more homoginous.&nbsp; <br /><br />22 for Fatty&#039;s is just crazy.&nbsp; I go for a drink and burrito from time to time, but Fatty&#039;s is not even in the same league as say Agnanti&#039;s.&nbsp; <br /><br />I suggest gettng your hands on the &#039;08 model and hope future editions improve again.

				OT for Zagat in Astoria, but did anyone else notice that some restaurants in Brooklyn seem to get a higher rating that perhaps they deserve. I&#039;ve eaten at a few of the top choices and don&#039;t think they are as good as the places they beat. <br />Examples are Dumont for burgers and Lucali pizza. Good, but not the best in the city.
