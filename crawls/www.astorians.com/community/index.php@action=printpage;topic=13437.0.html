				Is anyone else familiar with Amnesty International, either from membership or otherwise working with them? <br /><br />I&#039;m considering joining and while I know the basics of their mission I&#039;m curious to know more about their effectiveness as an organization before joining up.

				LOL I see this question is no longer fresh... did you join?&nbsp; Or was it a holidaytime spasm of giving guilt?<br /><br />You probably joined... do you mean joining a local group, or just sending a check and joining the membership?<br /><br />I recommend both! I used to work (well, 15 years ago) for their fundraising department!&nbsp; I was for several years also a group coordinator of volunteer response on north africa cases (and got to travel for training and errands of mercy) and was also a member of group 11 in manhhattan, which is still going strong. This group even gets to meet several former Prisoners of Conscience in the past year. One can get alot out of this, depending on the personalities in the local group and what one is willng and interested to put in. <br /><br />Am less involved, but really do recomemend it! <br /><br />Closer to home, Riverside Church Sojourners Program has a great immigrant detainee visitng program as well! <br /><br />

My view is how well do we know Amnesty Intl? I think it is known because it is a courageous organization and sometimes pisses off people when needed.<br /><br /><br />I believe we greatly benefit from the attention they bring and the education they share. Some would say that few really know about much of what Amnesty does. To a prisoner, it matters. If you were a prisoner feeling lost to the world, some abused, some facing death, knowing AI had your interests could mean salvation. Either in spirit or literally.<br /><br /><br />http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-successes/page.do?id=1011281<br /><br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTlrSYbCbHE<br />Declaration of Human Rights
