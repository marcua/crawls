				On what grounds is he to be impeached?&nbsp; As this poll seems to suggest, is it lying?&nbsp; As much as it does suck, lying to the American Public is not an impeachable offense.&nbsp; It has to be treason, bribery or high crimes and misdemeanors.<br /><br />If lying to the American public is an impeachable offense, Clinton should have been impeached.&nbsp; John F. Kennedy as well with his falsified missile gap hysteria he pushed on the American Public.&nbsp; Eisenhower (same), Johnson (Vietnam), Nixon (left us in Vietnam), et cetera.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure every president could have been impeached if such a slim reed was employed.&nbsp; The same can certainly be said about violations of international law.&nbsp; <br /><br />This impeachment business is just impotent anger expressing itself in a very fanciful way.&nbsp; Partly because the American Public and I&#039;d say a majority of people on this board, including myself, either allowed ourselves to be decieved without much exhurstion or were willing participants in our own self-deception.

				para: I hear you, but I think the WMD lying is enough reason on its own to impeach him. Not sure if you are saying that it isn&#039;t or just that there are more/better reasons to impeach than the lying. <br /><br />Frappe: it&#039;s not just that he lied, it&#039;s that he lied about WMDs. It&#039;s that Congress didn&#039;t get the information it needed to make a good decision about going into war and that that lie lead us into a very, very expensive war (in terms of body count, national credibility, and cash). Lying about a bj is something I couldn&#039;t care less about. A lie that changes the entire direction of our country and wastes our resources is something else entirely. <br /><br />The CIA gets a big chunk of blame for this, too. Sometimes you have a dumb boss and it&#039;s up to you to try to keep him from taking the whole company down.

However, violating international law signed by other presidents could be argued as treason against the office and the country. <br /><br />Check out this book: The Case for Impeachment (http://www.amazon.com/Case-Impeachment-Argument-Removing-President/dp/0312360169). It&#039;s a compelling arguement from a legal perspective and whether or not it could or should ever happen, I find that good points are made within it. I would be more than happy to let you borrow it if you&#039;d like.

				While I can appreciate your enthusiasm, the law does not recognize the difference between a BJ or a WMD.&nbsp; Nor does it recognize the damage done by such lying.<br /><br />I am sure that there are some actual legal reasons for which you can impeach Bush.&nbsp; But then we have to ask:<br />1.&nbsp; Are such legal transgressions well above and beyond what we would expect from a president?<br />2.&nbsp; What is the purpose of the impeachment?&nbsp; Is it because of a gross subterfuge of duty?&nbsp; Or is it just to get a guy who we don&#039;t like very much?<br />3.&nbsp; Given the amount of time left in his term and the amount of time an impeachment and then conviction, is it even feasible to undertake such?&nbsp; Are energies being wasted?<br /><br />I don&#039;t like the guy one bit, but to use Ford&#039;s impeachment criterion &quot;Its whatever the House of Representatives considers it&quot; is tantamount to politcal lynching which would only serve to further weaken the republic.

				I am in 100% agreement with you there Enigmacat.&nbsp; Ever since FDR, the office of the President has been increasing its power at the expense of the legislature.&nbsp; We are getting to the point where the checks and balances are in danger of being run over.&nbsp; Until we see a rebalancing of that power discrepancy (as well as the reducing the power of the federal government with relation to the states), things like this shall continue to happen, no matter which party has power.<br /><br />This, of course, results in a slower, more cumbersome form of government.&nbsp; We used to have a democratic tradition in this country to deal with that, but perhaps we no longer have the ability to maintain such.

				Impeach Bush and Cheney becomes president. Think about it.<br /><br />**just to clarify, the House votes on articles of Impeachment; if approved, the person is &quot;impeached&#039;. The articles must then be submitted to the Senate for approval and, depending on the articles (I believe), what punishment is meted out.**<br /><br />Perjury is certainly an impeachable offense, Indeed it&#039;s what got Clinton in the hot seat (not the bj). But unless Bush is brought before a grand jury or court of law to testify that he told the truth about WMD evidence (and thus under oath), he can&#039;t be accused of perjury.<br /><br />We have no provision to impeach an official under international law. I don&#039;t think any country does.<br /><br />He could be impeached on the whole prisoner torture thing, but only if it&#039;s demonstrable that he ordered it, and what he ordered was in direct violation of US law. But he knew that (or rather his handlers), which is why he issued that executive order basically leaving it vague and open-ended about what kind of treatment can be conducted upon prisoners.<br /><br />Bush is merely the straw man anyway. If the Dem controlled Congress wanted to make some sort of statement they can censure the president, but it&#039;s mostly an empty gesture and does not carry any legal penalty.<br /><br />I know censures of Bush were proposed in the House and Senate recently, but I don&#039;t know of the outcome.<br /><br />**OK, apologies for the longish and ramblign post.... Passing an article of impeachment in the House requires a simple majority. Conviction upon the basis of the articles (conducted in the Senate) require a 2/3 majority. So while it might be likely an article of impeachment brought against Bush or Cheney could pass the House, I highly doubt it will garner 2/3 majority. Plus the length of time to conduct a legal investigation <em>prior</em> to Impeachment probably means that the clock will run out first -- ie Bush &amp; Co. will be out of office. Look for citizens to file civil action against them, though.....<br /><br /><strong>U.S. Constitution, ARticle II, Section 4:</strong> <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				What would be the point of an impeachment trial?<br /><br />Bush and Cheney&#039;s term will end in a little over a year. The legacy of the Iraq war and trashing of civil liberties pretty much seals their place in history as one of, if not the worst, Presidents and Vice-Presidents in American history.<br /><br />Instead of looking back, I think we should start looking forward to choose the next President and to cleaning up the huge pile of crap George and Dick left behind

				Every time someone gives a reason why he shouldn&#039;t be impeached, I think of the colossal waste of time our nation had with the Clinton fiasco.&nbsp; I can hardly keep myself from laughing hysterically.&nbsp; And not because it&#039;s funny.&nbsp; It is very nauseating.

				Yes, it was a massive waste of money, and Clinton wasn&#039;t entirely blameless either. His peccadillo could have remained a non-issue if he admitted to it early on, acted contrite aobut it, did his little show for the cameras, etc., instead letting escalate into a full-blown grand jury investigation, in front of which he perjured himself. Even Gore was disappointed in him. Clinton should have known that the Republicans were capable of attacking him on <em>anything</em>. As far as I&#039;m concerned he threw the chum in the water. Anyway, that&#039;s old news....<br /><br />Now, I believe there could be a stronger case against Bush, but for some reason, there&#039;s zero political will among even his most strident opponents in Congress. And thye don&#039;t seem to give a fig that this is contrary to what their core supporters seem to want.<br /><br />Deep down, most of us (Dem and Republican and independent) are just gritting our teeth and counting down the days until January 20, 2009 when at the very least, our blessed Constitution shows him the door.
