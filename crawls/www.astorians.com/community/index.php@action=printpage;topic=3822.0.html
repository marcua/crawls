				Thank goodness people are talking about this. To be honest, it really bothers me to hear anyone, particulary women, buy in to the misconceptions of feminism, as portrayed by people who are threatened by equality. Sure, there are women who take it to the extreme of men-bashing, etc. But I see them as sort of like religious extremists who give other religious people a bad name.

				Andrea Dworkin is a slightly more <em>extreme </em> version of feminism than NYCMacUser&#39;s definition; she&#39;s known for her anti-pornography views, among other things. <br /><br />I like the basic definition posted, although simplified. I was a women&#39;s studies major in college, and it&#39;s always hard for me to understand how women can be so opposed to the idea of feminism, or calling themselves feminists, when I&#39;ve always understood it as a fairly basic, straightforward concept. I do think it gets more complicated once you get into theory, but -- I never understand what&#39;s controversial/negative about &quot;feminism&quot; in general.

				So, there are certain women who do not believe in the pure equality of the sexes in certain contexts.&nbsp; Let&#39;s say, for example, that they belong to a traditional religious community that has placed severe limitations on the extent to which they can participate in certain religious activities.&nbsp; There are some women who, instead of advocating for the overthrow of this system, decide to assert their femininity by applying themselves with zeal to the roles that are traditionally assigned to them.&nbsp; In other words, they operate under the assumption that absolute equality is not the desriable goal in their cultural context, whereas they find it worthwhile to use traditional notions of gender as a springboard from which to explore their femininity.<br /><br />What do you have to say to these people?&nbsp; Are these people feminists?

				My confusion is more with women (or men) who say: &quot;I&#39;m not a feminist, but....&quot; , than with people who actively accept traditional gender roles, fundamentally disagree with equality for women, etc, etc. I think that the former is largely due to misconceptions as to what feminism is. <br /><br />I should modify my post - People are free to choose whatever works for them, whether for religious, cultural, or personal reasons, and as long as someone actually makes that choice, I have no problem with it. I&#39;ve thought about how accepting traditional gender roles fits into the larger scheme of feminism, because I accept some myself, and I think it largely boils down to having that <strong>choice</strong> to decide what&#39;s best for you. <br /><br />

				I&#39;m interested not so much in feminism as in gender overall and how it&#39;s constructed at an individual and societal level.&nbsp; The reason I prioritize gender above feminism is because assumptions about one gender are often accompanied by assumptions about the other gender; in other words, notions of femininitiy and masculinity are interdependent.&nbsp; For example, one might think that boys are better than girls at science, or that girls should play with dolls but not boys; the end result being the assigning of specific social roles as being more suitable for one gender than the other.<br /><br />Having said that, I have to add that I&#39;ve never experienced as much reinforcement of traditional gender roles from the outside world as after I got married, and that moreover, most of it has come from women.&nbsp; It&#39;s always been women who have addressed mail to me using my first name and my husband&#39;s last name; one male friend, on the other hand, addressed a piece of joint mail to my husband and me using my last name!

				Sorry - that second link is to a Maureen Dowd NY Times magazine article that references the article in the first link.&nbsp; As I double checked that now, I finally came across the article I was really looking for:&nbsp; this commentary (http://www.womensenews.org/article.cfm/dyn/aid/2512) on both Maureen Dowd&#39;s article as well as the Times article by Louise Story I linked to (which I believe is the article referred to by mcw).&nbsp; I found this article when I originally read either the Louise Story article or the subsequent Maureen Dowd article, and I found it very interesting as it states:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">[Dowd] refers to a recent front-page story in The New York Times about young women attending an Ivy League college who were planning to reject careers in favor of staying home and raising children.

It was written by a journalism student doing her graduate thesis who based her story on an e-mail survey. Slate media writer Jack Shafer found the &quot;facts&quot; in the story so flimsy that the reporter &quot;deserves a week in the stockades. And her editor deserves a month.&quot; He pointed out that the writer used the word &quot;many&quot; 12 times in place of statistics.<br /><br />Writing in The Nation, columnist Katha Pollitt said she had contacted a number of people at Yale, including professors and students who were interviewed. She said not one felt the story fairly represented women at Yale.

				I feel that <em>real</em> feminism is empowering to both male and female because <em>real</em> feminism has nothing to do with &quot;power&quot; or the &quot;elevation&quot; of one sex in relation to another at all. <em>Real</em> feminism as I understand it is centered around human and gender authenticity. For me it&#39;s not about &quot;equality&quot; so far as &quot;power&quot; over another sex goes, but is more about creating a society in which all human beings can live authentically by balancing their individual roles with that of society. In this way I call myself a feminist.<br /><br />That being said, I also feel like a good number of people who call themselves feminists misrepresent the feminist movement as something that is about the &quot;power&quot; of one of the sexes, about one sex &quot;standing up&quot; to the oppression of the other sex (as in the &quot;victimization&quot; of one sex, and the &quot;abuse&quot; of another sex), and about the &quot;liberation&quot; of one sex from the other. This language is counter-productive and represents an over-simplification of the problem for me. Gender is a more complex issue in my mind, so I believe that some of the &quot;feminist&quot; talk I hear undermines the very philosophy that <em>real</em> feminism is built upon. It also means that sometimes I wouldn&#39;t want to be labeled a feminist.<br /><br />As an example, I have a similar feeling about Christianity. For me <em>real</em> Christianity is built upon a similar philosophy of authenticity, but that most of the systems that have been put in place on top of the spiritual &quot;founder&quot; of the faith (Jesus) actually entirely misrepresent the core philosophy. In the sense of human authenticity, and questioning of power, acknowledging the poor, and being a pacifist I could call myself &quot;Christian&quot;. But because of the current status-quo representation of &quot;Christianity&quot; in the mainstream, and based on the behavior of many religious organizations who call themselves &quot;Christian&quot; I don&#39;t want to be labeled as one.<br /><br />I think the same could be said of many philosophical groups though. <em>Real</em> masculinity, <em>real</em> Americanism etc. But none of these things seem to be manifest in their core form these days. Which is why I can completely understand why someone wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable all the time with the &quot;label&quot; of &quot;feminism&quot; or anything else.<br /><br />And as I understand <em>real</em> feminism, &quot;labels&quot; are out of style anyway.

With one basic difference that makes it almost impossible to overcome. Religion is steeped in tradition. Over 5,000 years of tradition. But, Christianity has only been around for 2,000 years. Please forgive my impertinence, but I really don&#39;t want to see *this* thread corrupted on discussions of the flavors of Christianity or religion. Here is a great article on the subject of <span class="bbc_u">Religion vs Feminism</span> (http://www.tuftsprimarysource.org/issues/23/08/brusco.html). <br /><br />I sincerely feel that the discussion of feminism is long overdue for younger women. Most who really know only of the corrupted form of it and can not even relate to its origins.<br /><br />I grew up in a time when women were not allowed to hold certain professions. I&#39;m not talking about construction work, I&#39;m talking about being an accountant, a journalist, or even a chef. Lots of changes have happened in my lifetime—and I worked very hard to effectuate those changes. Harvard, Princeton, Yale, just to name a few, were all male schools. Not many young women today can even relate to that. When I graduated high school with SAT scores over 1500 I was refused admission to all three schools even though they were accepting males with less than a 900 SAT. When I applied to do my graduate work at Columbia, even though they were accepting women into their graduate programs, I was told that they still didn&#39;t allow any women into their journalism or political sciences programs. Today&#39;s young woman doesn&#39;t understand how and why she is able to avail herself of all the things that her male counterparts do, and takes for granted her right to participate in the American way. <br /><br />Most of the women who fought for women to get the vote died before ever being able to execute that right themselves. There are numerous things women have been denied, voting, access to certain professions, access to higher education, etc., and today women just enjoy them as if they were never an obstacle.<br /><br />Feminism is just starting its third wave. I will not live long enough to see it be successful. But I am grateful that I have lived to see what *I* fought for become the norm. I find it very difficult when I hear a woman say that she is *not* a feminist, or that she is against (rejects) feminism without understanding what it has done for her life(style).

				I found the Louise Story article interesting for many of the reasons that NYCMacUser cites: the different experiences of feminism by women of different generations, and how those different experiences are shaped by institutional and social forces.&nbsp; I had read another article - I now can&#39;t remember where - which seemed to be a response to that article, and which profiled a number of women in their 40s who were trying to re-enter the work force after having taken a number of years off to raise a family, and the difficulties they were facing in dealing with the gap in their resumes.&nbsp; The implication seemed to be that young women in their teens and 20s, who had never faced the kinds of barriers that earlier generations of women did, were not fully cognizant of the realities and limitations of the working world.<br /><br />Regardless of any potential weaknesses in the Story article - and I found the feminist critiques (Rivers/Barnett, Politt) as well as the Shafer critique to have their own biases - it is not difficult to imagine a new complacency among young women today which may result in a misguided belief that a return to traditional values is a valid choice, without understanding, as NYCMacUser says, the history and legacy of the feminist movement.

I have sat through an MBA class discussion on women, the glass ceiling and wage equality, only to find that the majority of the men in the class felt that women did deserve a lower wage because they were going to take time off as mothers. This class was in 2000, not so long ago. <br />I also recently reread an article on cultural competence in the Swedish education system (it was by a professor I had previously worked with) and was struck again how assigned gender roles can differ so vastly across cultures. Specifically, an immigrant father who also happened to be Muslim was upset with his son&#39;s Kindergarten teacher because she had his son participating in activities such as raking the leaves in the yard. The father complained that in his tradition, this was women&#39;s work. The teacher responded the said &quot;chore&quot; was actually part of the mandatory curriculum about being able to work as a team and for each member of the team to complete his assigned chore. (for anyone interested I can post the source). <br />My thoughts are therefore that the reason why there was a Feminist movement to begin with hasn&#39;t been overcome. <br />People should be free to choose if to accept assigned gender roles or to challenge them, but [and this might come off as contraversial to some people] women continue to struggle to attain an equitable role in society. <br />Women leaders continue to be second guessed because they are expected to follow rules that are gender based. <br />To cite a recently published study, &quot;Although females are beginning to make inroads into traditionally male-dominated leadership roles, it is clear that there is still much progress to be made. Taken together, the studies reported here represent an important<br />extension of both the literature examining information processing approaches to leadership and gender bias in leadership. First, to our knowledge, our studies represent the first evidence that gender bias in leadership emerges early on during information processing.&quot; (source: Scott, K.A.&nbsp; &amp; Brown, D. J. (2006). Female first, leader second? Gender bias in the encoding of leadership behavior. <em>Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes</em>, In Press, Corrected Proof, Available online 24 July 2006)<br /><br />So please be respectful and don&#39;t belittle the topic when the party that started the thread stated that she wanted to have a meaningful discussion on the topic.<br /><br />NYCMacUser, hope you find my contributions meaningful, and for what it&#39;s worth, I consider two women in particular to be my personal inspirations: Emma Goldman and Simone de Beauvoir

Two of the better known women of the first-wave of feminism. They laid the foundation, the framework for the second-wave which followed in the 1960s. This wave was very basic in its concept. &quot;. . . to take action to bring women into full participation in society—sharing equal rights, responsibilities and opportunities with men, while living free from discrimination.&quot; And as it was taking a foothold, it became corrupted. The reasons are moot, at this point in history. The more important aspect of its corruption was, that even at *that* time, it laid the foundation for the third-wave. I believe that it is now starting to take shape. <br /><br />mirki2 also mentioned the glass ceiling. I wonder how many of today&#39;s young women have even heard the term. I believe it was coined in the early 1980s. And it is still alive and flourishing around the world. <br /><br />There has been change. Not all of it for the better. For example, I was among the group of women who were vilified in our protest marches against the NYFD when they changed the requirements to allow women to pass their test and become members of the department. That was *never* the intent of the movement. We just wanted women to have the same rights to apply (test) for the job. There used to be a test that required an applicant to carry a dummy weighing a certain weight down a ladder from a third story building. That weight was reduced so that a woman (READ: smaller statue) could handle the dummy. That should never have been done. What women wanted was for them to be able to do the *same* job as a man and get paid the same for doing it. Once that restriction was lowered it became easier for the courts to lower others. After an historical (landmark) case brought by a group of Hispanics, the height restriction for the job was lowered to allow people shorter than the average person to pass the basic requirements of the job.<br /><br />Frankly, I am not comforted when I see 2 uniform cops walking the streets of my neighborhood, carrying guns, and I realize that they are both women and both 5 feet 2 inches tall. There used to be a regulation that no-one under 5 feet 8 inches could even apply to the department. I am not encouraged by these kinds of changes.<br /><br />I still find it difficult to understand the ramifications of the defeat of the Equal Rights Amendment. It would have opened the door to all the other issues that are currently plaguing our Country. <br /><br />1. Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.<br /><br />2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.<br /><br />3. This amendment shall take effect two years after the date of ratification.<br /><br />By adding words after the word sex, in section one, it could have covered all the ills we are experiencing. Sexual preference. Race. Religion. National Origin. And on, and on.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=3822.msg38170.html#msg38170">Quote from: futility on October 17, 2006, 11:56:36 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Easy chicken.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Wrong.
