				&nbsp;I have a question about the auto insurance you should have when you rent a car. I’ve never rented a car before, but I’m going to be in California this weekend and will need to. I don’t own a car now so I don’t have any kind of car insurance. My credit card company (VISA) offers a collision damage waiver if I decline the rental company’s damage waiver policy. The rental company offers other types of coverage – supplemental liability protection and personal accident insurance. I don’t know if I have to decline ALL the insurance offered, or just a damage waiver.<br />Am I better off just getting the whole shebang from the company? I’ve searched the internet and some things I’ve read say the rental company’s insurance is a scam and some say it is the best thing you can do. I just don’t want to end up with added headaches should something bad happen. <br />Any advice would be appreciated!<br />&nbsp;

				Did you happen to book your car through Hotwire?&nbsp; If so, I would look at their policy which covers up to (I believe) $40,000 per person (and is significantly cheaper than what they will try to sell you at the counter).&nbsp; I have done what you are proposing with the Visa when renting in Arizona and had no issues - just have that provider send you a letter (takes them about 10 seconds) stating that your Visa covers it.&nbsp; Then if asked simply show them that letter.&nbsp; We also don&#039;t have a car and I&#039;ve never had any issues waiving coverage.<br />&nbsp;<br />The job of the people at the car rental counter is to sell you more coverage than you need because it adds to their bottom line.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Hope this helps and safe travels!

				I usually skip the damage waiver as I&#039;m covered by my credit card, but I always get the third party liability coverage because I know that one time I don&#039;t get it, I&#039;m going to get in some accident that may be my fault (I&#039;m a great driver, but sh#t happens) and I&#039;m going tobe responsibility for tons of damage.

				I didn&#039;t book the car through Hotwire. I guess I&#039;ll rely on the credit card&#039;s damage waiver and get the supplemental coverage just in case.<br /><br />Thanks C-J and Mer!<br />
