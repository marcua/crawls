				Deffinately consider George D at C21 on 23rd Avenue.<br /><br />Also, I saw a For Rent sign on 26th street between 23rd and 24th Avenue (east side of the street).&nbsp; <br /><br />Now, the sign was actually on the bench infront of the house.&nbsp; So this may imply one of two things.&nbsp; <br /><br />1 - Its the first floor of the 3 fam house for rent which usually has at least 2 bedrooms<br />2 - The bench is for rent and there is no discount for rain.<br /><br />I think its worth it to check it out either way. :-D<br /><br />Good luck!

				There is a woman named Angela who advertises in the AM New York.&nbsp; Her office is on 30th Ave I believe.&nbsp; I met with her, and saw a couple of apts that were pretty nice.&nbsp; She charged a one month fee, which I found to be lower than many.<br /><br />That being said, I found an apartment off a flyer.&nbsp; The few people I know who live in Astoria found apartments by walking around and looking for signs.<br /><br />Good luck!

				Thanks a lot for your advice, we are definitely going to call them to see if we can start setting up appointments. Do you guys know how early can you start looking for a place because I had called a realtor before and they said it has to be less than a month in advance...<br /><br />We also planing to walk around the area looking for postings so if you happen to see anything please let us know it would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks again.

				usually start a month before. so if you want to move in june 1, start looking in early may.<br />thats when legally tenants let the landlords know they won&#039;t be re-newing their leases, so the apartments aren&#039;t usually available before at the most, a month out.<br /><br />if its a new building you may be able to get a jump on it.<br />I would take the next couple of weeks to look around the nabe and figure out the areas you want to live, then may 1st hit the pavement.
