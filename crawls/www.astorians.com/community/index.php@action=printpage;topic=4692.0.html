				Title: <strong>Resume Writing Service?</strong><br />

				So I have decided to embark on one of the 47 resolutions that I made this year and have begin to start to work on my resume. Let me rephrase that statement.... I have pulled out my old resume and stared at it for two hours and have done absolutely nothing.&nbsp; I desperately need to update me resume and look for a new job but I can&#39;t get past the updating my resume part. Its been 8 years since I have updated it. Scary I know, but if there is one thing in the world I hate doing its writing resumes and cover letters!!<br /><br />My question is has any one ever used a resume writing service? How much did it cost? Were you happy with the results? Can you recommend a particular company? <br /><br />Please help me before I pull all of my hair out of my head.<br />thanks. Urrisgirl

				When I was in Syracuse, I had used a career counselor, and it was basically the cost of a &quot;doctor&#39;s appointment&quot;.&nbsp; I have also sent a copy to Resume Doctor, and got their opinion of my resume.&nbsp; I am not sure I agreed with what they had to say.&nbsp; But they will give you &quot;some&quot; feedback, like a free quote.&nbsp; There feedback is vague, but something to work with before you send it on.&nbsp; Try that.&nbsp; www.resumedoctor.com

				This is something I do on the side. I am willing to work on it for you if you would like. My prices are completely negotiable - whatever we both think is fair.

				I actually macked up my resume by using a headhunter service.&nbsp; They&#39;ll take your resume and give you pointers on how to make it look better, since it is in their best interest to have you with the best resume as possible.<br /><br />Since head hunters do not charge you a fee, its a free, professional service.&nbsp; And then if you get a job out of it, thats an extra bonus.
