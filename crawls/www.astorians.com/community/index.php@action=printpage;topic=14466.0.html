				I skated by there once to check it out last year, and the place was deserted.&nbsp; Just a couple of kids throwing rocks around and it looked like there was a giant hole kicked into the end boards.&nbsp; Maybe it was just an off-day, but it didn&#039;t look like anyone had played there in a while.&nbsp; Maybe someone else knows of some games down there?&nbsp; Or perhaps it&#039;s a good place to revive and start using again.<br /><br />You know of anyone else who would be interested in playing?&nbsp; I&#039;ve NEVER had so much trouble drumming up a street hockey game before..!

				Its kinda tough for hockey i guess , basketball and soccer seems to have taken over . Once a few people get together u will see how many more just pop up . We would have small pickup games and then before we knew it we had like 20 people joining in . Ill ask some people i know&nbsp; and hopefully they will have some time &gt; Thats the problem , alot of the people i played with now have kids and have gotten married so its tough to make time .,&nbsp; &nbsp; ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

				The roller hockey rink is still in use.<br /><br />The local YMCA runs a league out of the rink in the summertime.&nbsp; The season hasn&#039;t started yet, which is why you don&#039;t see any games there.&nbsp; The games are usually on the mornings during the weekends.&nbsp; <br /><br />Most of the guys who play in that league are still playing ice hockey in the new L.I.C. Ice Pavillion Rink.<br /><br />Since I don&#039;t live close to that rink anymore, I don&#039;t play there that much.&nbsp; Although I&#039;ll probably start too since my daughter loves the adjacent playground.&nbsp; During the summer, I usually spend my weekend mornings skating in the park next to the Astoria Blvd/Hoyt Avenue train station.&nbsp; The floor is pretty smooth and is easy to get to and find parking.&nbsp; <br /><br />I see a lot of people around there playing pick-up there lately.&nbsp; I even saw one guy there put on full goalie gear!!&nbsp; (I wouldn&#039;t do it though).
