				Hey all!! I just got an apartment on 25th ave and 45th street. I will have my car for now, but was wondering if it would be safe for a young female to walk down 45th/46th street in the early morning to get to the 46th/Broadway stop. I need the R train to get to Jackson Heights. I figure it will be about a 15 minute walk, which I don&#039;t mind, but just wondering if the area is safe to walk alone at say 630am/7am? <br /><br />Also, is it well lit at night? A lot of people walking around or less people around?&nbsp; I know it seems to be more residential and less people as say Broadway/Steinway. Thanks in advance!!

				I used to do that walk down 45th street but from 30th ave. From that point to the train station I would say the only &quot;creepy&quot; area is the entire block taken up by the park and the school on 31st ave. There are less people out there at night. You should be ok. Just be aware of your surroundings as you would in any area. I can&#039;t vouch from 25th ave to 30th as I never had much reason to walk those blocks at night or early morn.
