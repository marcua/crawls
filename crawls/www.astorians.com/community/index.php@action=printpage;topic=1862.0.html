				It&#39;s because prior to 1898, New York City was only Manhattan.&nbsp; So if you lived in Astoria - or Brooklyn, etc., you went &quot;in to the city&quot;.

				Yeah, when people say &quot;the city&quot; they generally mean Manhattan. It&#39;s not just Astoria, it&#39;s anywhere in the outer boroughs. I don&#39;t think anyone says they&#39;re going to the city when they&#39;re going from Queens to Brooklyn.

				I am originally from Brooklyn and from the&nbsp; time I was only enough to go to Manhattan by myself I always called it the city and never Manhattan.&nbsp; I think everybody calls it the city.&nbsp; Everyone from NY knows what you&#39;re talking about when you say you&#39;re going to the city.&nbsp; Also people know you&#39;re going to Greenwich Village when you say you&#39;re going to the Village.

				I&#39;ve been in Astoria for 12 years now and love it.&nbsp; After living in Brooklyn my whole life I never ever thought that I would move to Queens, but I decided to try it and am so glad that I did.&nbsp; The only thing I miss about Brooklyn is the beach being so close.&nbsp; I used to live in Brighton Beach and was 1 block from the beach.&nbsp; Now I just take the train down to Coney Island.&nbsp; I can&#39;t wait for the beach weather.<br /><br />I still think it&#39;s kind of strange to call Queens the city.

				Just to add some further semantics to the discussion- to me &quot;the city&quot; generally refers to Manhattan, but &quot;New York City&quot; means all five boroughs, including, ugh, Staten Island. Actually, I tend to think even just saying &quot;New York&quot; refers to the five boroughs. <br /><br />In fact, as a person who grew up in NYC, I still get very upset at people who say they live in NY, or grew up in NY, when really they mean Hoboke, or Weschester, or Long Island...<br /><br />

				I always correct my friends, who are mostly transplanted from places elsewhere, that they cannot be going to the city from astoria since they are in the city already. i then have to alleivate their confusion by informing them that all 5 boroughs make up the city and if you are in it, then it can&#39;t be your destination. This then starts drunken debates over the subject, but i consistently maintain that i am in the right. (i am never wrong, merely misinformed).<br />as to queens and brooklyn being on LI, geographically i concede that fact, but the essential definition of LI is Nassau &amp; Suffolk. But anyone from queens knows when you cross that border. an eerie, we&#39;re not in kansas anymore feeling washes over you.<br />ooohhh i&#39;m gettin creeped out thinking about it. i think i have to do something inherently &quot;queens&quot; when i return home to shake this feeling. <br />Jenn

I guess it refers to an insular attitude, maybe tinged with racism and/or xenophobia, definitely a culturally-conservative environment. Plus all the exurban sprawl of malls, box stores, etc<br /><br />&nbsp;But what is &quot;Long Island&quot;, though? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that cut and dried. It&#39;s as diverse as any other population dense area -- from Glen Cove gated communities to Riverhead projects. You&#39;ll still find farms, orchards and vinyards, too. In addition there&#39;s a growing immigrant population in both Suffolk and Nassau counties.<br /><br />But I understand the sterotype &quot;Long Islander&quot; (loafers and whatnot). I&#39;ve encounted that certain type. And if you look around neighborhoods in Queens (particularly those closer to the Nassau line, but also right here in Astoria), I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find locals that resemble some sort of idea of &quot;typical Long Islander&quot;.<br /><br />I&#39;m not from LI, but I spent good parts of my childhood there, particularly in the summer, and have fantastic memories of the place (West Islip/Babylon/Robert Moses Beach area). Compared to where I actually lived, LI was heaven. Seriously. I was in an isolated, provincial small town, therefore the LI sprawl represented a cultural mecca of sorts for this early -- and deprived -- adolescent.<br /><br />Anyway, sorry for the digression, but I kind of felt the need to give props to LI, for what it&#39;s worth.

				Is it safe to say that when those of us say we are going into the city (and we are refering to Manhattan) that it not the geographic area we are talking about but rather the cultural area?&nbsp; Manhattan does not feel like Queens or visa-versa.&nbsp; <br /><br />I grew up in the West Palm area of Florida.&nbsp; The people&nbsp; from Orlando south to Key West never refer to themselves as southerners despite the fact that Florida is geographically south of the cultural &quot;south&quot;.&nbsp; We didn&#39;t sip iced sweet tea and say &quot;How ya doin&#39; Ya&#39;ll&quot; to all of the passerbyers while sitting in our rocking chairs out on the front porch.&nbsp; I was too busy hanging out on the beach and drinking rum runners to do all of that.&nbsp; :)

				I also think that my time living on LI is part of the reason why I consider the 5 boroughs (or at least 4 of them - Staten Island seems out of place) as &quot;the City.&quot;&nbsp; I will often say Manhattan over &quot;the City.&quot;&nbsp; I actually like calling the boroughs by their individual names.&nbsp; I don&#39;t mind not sounding like a NY native, because I am not and probably will never totally feel like a native.&nbsp; I have a major California/west coast streak still alive and kicking in me, and will always proudly consider myself a California native.&nbsp; With that said, I wish I could convince people here to NOT refer to SF as &quot;San Fran,&quot; which sounds ugly to my ears.&nbsp; &quot;Frisco&quot; is even worse and just ridiculous sounding, and I will most likely point and laugh at you if I ever hear you say it.&nbsp; :evil:<br />I do approve of &quot;Berzerkeley,&quot; though.

				Goldfish Boy, I think you&#39;re right about London.&nbsp; London is funny because there&#39;s a part called Westminster (and the postal address actually says Westminster, not London) that includes the Buildings of Parliament, Buckingham Palace, and other such places.&nbsp; The rest of it is called London, and the further you go in any direction starts to be called by their local names, like Wimbledon, Motspur Park, Morden, Fulham, etc.&nbsp; I&#39;m more familiar with the southern part of &quot;London&quot; (in quotes because I&#39;m really not sure where the cutoff is) having spent 3 months there a few years ago near the Raynes Park, New Malden area.&nbsp; It seems like it&#39;s similar to here nomenclature-wise, not that there are boroughs, but the outlying areas aren&#39;t really suburbs, and they are referred to by a name and have a specific mailing address (like Astoria), but they&#39;re not truly part of &quot;the city.&quot;&nbsp; I don&#39;t think people who live in Wimbledon, for example, although they are only a 20-minute Underground ride away from Central London, would call themselves Londoners.&nbsp; But for the most part, I don&#39;t know jack about squat; I just felt like throwing in my two-cents.&nbsp;

				I had recently found an old telegram with some photos from the early 1960s, and it was addressed to:<br /><br />Astoria, Long Island, NY.<br /><br />Even though the other 4 boroughs have been part of New York City for decades, Manhattan still has the distinction of being recognized as &quot;the city&quot;.

				Yes, that&#39;s a time-honored outer-boroughs term for Manhattan.&nbsp; I first learned it from a Brooklyn friend, when I lived in Manhattan, and when I became a Queensite by adoption I started using it too.&nbsp; Alfred Kazin named his boyhood memoir <em>A Walker in the City</em>, and if you read it you find he means a walker in Manhattan--Kazin was born and raised in Brooklyn.<br /><br />My mother, a native of the Bronx who lived for a time in Brooklyn, remembers another term.&nbsp; If she was going to Manhattan she said she was going uptown.
