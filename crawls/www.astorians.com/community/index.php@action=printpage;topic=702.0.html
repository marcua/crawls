				Hey everyone,<br /><br />I'm a journalism student at Columbia and my beat is Astoria. I don't live in the neighborhood, but I spend a good deal of my week there trying to dig up some news. I've been going to the CB meetings and the press conferences, but I'm interested in finding more stories within the community (ie, you guys).<br /><br />If anyone has any stories they feel should be written about - local issues, new projects, recurring problems, unusual experiences, etc. - please let me know! I can't promise anything except that I'll take you seriously and look into it.<br /><br />Remember, this is for potential publication, so don't tell me anything you want kept private! :-)<br /><br />Looking forward to hearing your stories.

				How about the rash of explosions around Ditmars and 31st Streets? Others may know more about them, but I believe they were ConEd-related. I seem to recall at least two this summer, one last summer.<br /><br />Also on Tuesday morning I saw police tape cordoning off a section of Ditmars between 28th and 29th streets that included someone's automobile. There was a manhole nearby that had smoke or steam coming out of it. I thought I could smell something burning as well. Did anyone else notice this or hear about it?
