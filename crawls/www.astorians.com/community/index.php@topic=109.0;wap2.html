			Greetings,<br /><br />An easy and fun way to volunteer for the Kerry/Edwards campaign is to donate your free nights and weekends cell minutes and make calls for the campaign.<br /><br />To be clear, you&#039;ll only be calling democrats who have signed up on JohnKerry.com and have expressed an interest in Kerry/Edwards. I&#039;ve been doing this and everyone I&#039;ve talked to has been friendly and has appreciated the call.<br /><br />Iif you go to http://calls.johnkerry.com they give you instructions, phone numbers, and a sample script of what to say when you call.<br /><br />Really, you&#039;re just calling states like Ohio and telling Democrats there that we New Yorkers are supporting them and counting on them to help Kerry get elected. You&#039;ll also have a list of events on your screen to tell them about that are going on in their local neighborhood.<br /><br />It&#039;s a great way to help, to meet new people, and to help get our country back on track.<br /><br />Please consider volunteering even 20 minutes of your time by going to:<br /><br />http://calls.johnkerry.com
