				does anyone go here? it&#039;s on 31st st btw 30th ave and newtown.<br />I had an interesting experience at this dump over the weekend where some regular essentially wanted to fight me because he thought I was trying to scam the bar out of paying $1 for the pool table. <br />the place is a dive and that&#039;s fine, but the locals there are kind of depressing/pathetic.

				That&#039;s funny. I love the place and on the occasions that I go, the local regulars have always been very welcoming and a lot of fun.<br /><br />I decided that I really liked the place after my fourth or fifth time going there. A guy was pretty drunk and trying to pick a fight with just about anybody. The bartender told him he had to go and the instant he refused, four or five big guys seemed to just materialize around him and politely, but gruffly, made sure that he left.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s a great, cheap, close to home place to get a beer, watch a game and just hang out. The bartenders are great guys and while the crowd it a little more &quot;townie&quot; than you usually find in NYC, I feel right at home there.

				&nbsp; &nbsp; I heard a few people refer to it as &quot;Mcaffrey and Jerks&quot;, so I guess it does have a bit of a negative reputation in the neighborhood.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; I have gone there every now and again over the years, and I never had a problem.&nbsp; Some people seem friendlier than others, and the bartenders always seemed friendly and quick with the drinks.&nbsp; There does seem to be a bit of a clique-ish crew that goes there every now and again, they tend to stay near the back of the bar, near the pool table, but I never saw them start any problems with strangers, especially not just for the sake of causing trouble.&nbsp; I would say if a stranger goes in and doesn&#039;t act up, they shouldn&#039;t have a problem.

				I&#039;m in there 5-6 times a month, and concur with the previous posters---great bartenders (who will quickly remmeber you and your drink), lots of regulars (a few of which may seem a little territorial until they recognize your face), and a laid-back, non-trendy vibe.&nbsp;

				I thought so too about this place. I have been there a few times in the past, and thought it was a nice enough local bar. I guess there can be jerks in any bar. I had just never really encountered someone trying to get into an argument over something so stupid as trying to scam a $1 pool game.

While this doesn&#039;t excuse being a jerk about it, I just thought it might shed light on the situation.

				whether or not they are serious pool players has nothing to do with this case: I walk in with my brother-in-law and get 2 beers and ask for a $1 of quarters for the pool table which was totally empty. I put the quarters in and no balls come out. I ask the bartender about it and he comes over and starts fiddling with the table, seemingly this happens with this table. Then this &#039;jerk&#039; comes over and says that he has never seen no balls come out when someone puts in a full dollar. He claims that at least one or two balls come out at minimum and says I didn&#039;t put in a full dollar and was trying to scam the bar. So i laugh it off and ask the bartender for another dollar and it works this time (kind of surprised the bartender made me pay another dollar but whatever). Then 5 minutes later the &#039;jerk&#039; comes over and tells me not to try that scam again or he&#039;ll throw me out of the place. Then goes up to bartender and starts talking about me calling me &quot;slick&quot; and keep an eye out for me. <br />I know this guy was drunk and obviously didn&#039;t like my appearance for whatever reason, it happens. I just thought it amusing that this guy legitimately thought I was scamming a free $1 game of pool, and was prepared to make a big deal about it.
