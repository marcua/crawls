				I read this article today in the NYT&#039;s and got to wondering. <br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/26/nyregion/26dinkins.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion (http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/26/nyregion/26dinkins.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion)<br /><br />I moved to NYC January 2002. At that time, I had been hearing about how Giuliani had been responsible for fixing NYC. I even seem to recall that the revival of Times Square was a trophy of the Giuliani Administration. Yet, according to this article, It was the Dinkins Administration that had gotten Disney to move into the New Amsterdam Theatre. Which was, from what most people seem to say, the turning point of Times Square. <br /><br />And since living here, it seems I keep hearing that many key statistics pointed to as proof started to change in the Dinkins administration. <br /><br />I wanted to ask those who lived here in the 90&#039;s, how much does either argument seem true. When did it seem to turn around in the city?

				Actually, Crime in cities nationwide went down since the early 90s. Some argue that the decrease in crime wasn&#039;t the specific result of one particular mayor, but a nationwide social trend that just has continued since the early 90s. I&#039;m sure a lot of Giuliani fans will say they don&#039;t have any recollection of crime going down during Dinkins, because news coverage during the Dinkins administration may have altered the perception of the public that crime was high even though in all actuality crime was going down. A lot of the police strategies of the Giuliani/Bratton era actually was constructed by Dinkins and Speaker Vallone (both Vallone and Dinkins are the ones who came up with the safe street safe city program). But as I said, many state that there was no individual responsible for the trend, as it was just apart of a larger nationwide decrease in crime.

				Giuliani administered and saw through many of the changes that began in the Dinkins administration, which was overall good, but had a lot of problems finding the right footing.&nbsp; I&#039;d agree with the article that Times Square and the drop in crime began under Dinkins, but much as I disliked Giuliani, he did have a positive effect in seeing these reforms and changes through.&nbsp; The transformation of Times Square was quite drastic - from the start of the 90s to the end of the decade, it was just amazing.&nbsp; While I miss some of the old Times Square, the transformation did some amazing things for the city.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				What I find most interesting in the article you posted is this quote: <br /><br /><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="bbc_size">“If you elect the Democratic mayoral candidate, Mr. Giuliani, the former Republican mayor, warned a mostly Orthodox Jewish audience in Brooklyn, New York could well return to a time when a feckless liberal Democrat let services decay and crime and homelessness run rampant.”</span><br /><br />Why it’s interesting is that to those of us who lived in the city during the 90s know, it’s a not so thinly veiled indictment of Dinkin’s handling of the Crown Heights riot in 1991, which for some reason the piece neglects to mention!<br /><br />Whatever good Dinkins did for the city, and as the article states there were many things, was negated by his actions, inaction really, during the Crown Heights riot – it ended his political career. <br /><br />As for Times Square, the transformation didn’t happen overnight, it was years in the making. Proposals were floated even before Dinkins became mayor. Having Disney come in was a turning point though and a major achievement, which Dinkins deserves credit as does he does for the expansion of the police force.<br /><br />I always thought that much of Giuliani’s success as mayor was due to being in the right place at the right time, as it often is for many people considered successful. His brash, take no prisoners attitude was exactly what was needed to bring the city under control. But as the city changed for the better, Giuliani didn’t and in the end he was just another bully, at least in my opinion.<br /><br />I wish we saw more of the Giuliani of 9/11– I remember asking myself who is this person? Who knew the man had such compassion?<br />

				Giuliani had/has compassion?&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I even saw that after 9-11, though I think he showed great leadership.

				Actually, I think he did Dirk. I think his words and actions were a great comfort at the time. It was his finest moment.

				Is this about Giuliani? Is it about NYC?<br />I dont think much of the NY Times article.<br /><br /><br />I took the article as commentary on the current race for mayor. On that account, I hope all the candidates in this day are not focused on race when it comes to politics.<br />And I hope all the candidates have safety as a key focus. Policing remains a critical issue.<br /><br />I came to NY after Dinkins, in the Giuliani eras. To me, the later 90s were great times for the city and the country. But I would not want to see the whole of the city treated the same way 42nd St was. What effect did the administrations have on education?<br /><br />In this time, Thompson seems to me the best Democratic candidate that we have seen.<br /><br />I agree a lot with what 28Grand wrote.<br />I try to think more of how Rudy was during the 90s, good and bad.<br />He fit NYC and the times. And I think most still hold a fair regard for Rudy.<br />

				I grew up in NYC, from the 60&#039;s, successive and increasingly more&nbsp; &#039;liberal&#039;&nbsp; administrations &#039;well-meaning&#039; polices helped an escalating crime and poverty rate. It all culminated&nbsp; with the hapless&nbsp; Mayor Dinkins&nbsp; who inherited&nbsp; a&nbsp; city already out of control and by the time Guiliani was elected, 2,500&nbsp; murders a year. Parts of&nbsp; this town, like the Bronx were like&nbsp; Beirut, and I had&nbsp; been to Beirut in 1983 during a war, after&nbsp; terrorists&nbsp; had turned&nbsp; it into a&nbsp; shooting gallery. I won&#039;t say any politician can &#039;fix&#039; things&nbsp; totally, but, Mayor Giuliani was and is the best Mayor&nbsp; in my lifetime in New York, with Mayor Koch coming in a close second. I find it awful that Giuliani is attacked&nbsp; as some &#039;divisive&#039; tyrant or&nbsp; even &#039;racist&#039;, many times, by people&nbsp; who supported/support&nbsp; real divisive&nbsp; racial hustlers&nbsp; like&nbsp; the alleged Rev. Sharpton or a real&nbsp; racial arsonist like Charles&nbsp; Barron currently on the City&nbsp; council. Still, a very liberal acquaintance of mine, who came back to&nbsp; NY after leaving in the mid-80&#039;s, conceded&nbsp; that Giuliani&#039;s polices had made a difference&nbsp; for the better of&nbsp; NY. I agree, wish he&#039;d run for Gov.

				Rudy was the first mayor since LaGuardia, not to be beholding to his party, which meant fewer patronage jobs, hired better suited people to carry out his policies. Thus was able to put pressure on the various departments to make large changes in there tactics. Focus on modernizing city government, and quality of life issues, etc. It was difficult for any mayor to make whole changes because many of the city agencies were given away, by the John Lindsay&#039;s Admistration, and future mayors had no direct over site anymore; ie public schools, transit authority, this created public school system with no accountability, bus and subway service that were barely functional. And in return city residences got a new city income tax, higher water rates, plus a commuter tax for area residences. How many jobs did the city lose, how many jobs were not attracted due to the much higher costs of doing business, and lastly how many working class, middle class and upper income families left; the answer is many.&nbsp; Do we want this again, if not there must be a two-party system of government, for accountability. If for no other reason.
