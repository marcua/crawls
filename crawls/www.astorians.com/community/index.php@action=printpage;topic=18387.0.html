				Hello everyone,<br /><br />I just returned from a family trip to Europe and have some photos of great sentimental value that I&#039;d like to get developed - and done right.&nbsp; The last time I did this I just defaulted to the Rite Aid at Broadway and Steinway and was not impressed with how the pictures came out.&nbsp; I&#039;m now closer to 30th Ave.&nbsp; Does anyone have recommendations on where to get photos done?&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t necessarily have to be by 30th Ave.<br /><br />Thanks!

				AdoramaPix.com, pickup on 18th St in the city to avoid shipping costs. They do a great job, a very good selection of quality up to professional-level prints, and reasonably priced. Check their schedule, though, as they observe Orthodox hours.<br />

				Thank you!&nbsp; I&#039;ve walked by there often but never thought to go in.&nbsp; I&#039;ll give them a try.

				If you happen to have a membership, Costco is my go-to photo processing place.&nbsp; The quality is good, they can go it quickly and it&#039;s very inexpensive.&nbsp; &nbsp;I just had a bunch of wedding photos printed and they printed up the same quality as the over-priced developer that my wedding photographer uses for his clients.&nbsp;

				I like Adorama. I&#039;ve used a few other places in the city, but I think Adorama is the best bet for what you need. You can upload online (I am assuming you have digital files) and have them sent, or pick them up, the N travels close to them.<br /><br />(teeny tiny type: I am a photographer by trade :) )

				I&#039;ll also recommend Adoramapix. I send all my clients there, and had my own personal wedding photos printed there as well. And they&#039;re not insanely expensive at all, I&#039;m always 100% pleased.

				Perfect Image Photo Lab, 3705 Broadway. I prefer to support small local stores. <br /><br />The owner is really nice, prints are ready in one hr from any digital media, always happy with the quality and color, and he takes a good passport photo too!

				Thank you for all the recommendations!<br /><br />I went with Adorama and they were fantastic.&nbsp; Just picked up the prints tonight and they far exceeded my expectations.&nbsp; Prices were quite reasonable.&nbsp; FYI to anyone who uses foursquare, they&#039;ll give you a $5 gift card if you show them that you checked in there.&nbsp; Kinda cool!
