				After battling with subpar umbrellas for the last few years, I recently got a Totes Bubble Umbrella and I LOVE it. I don&#039;t care if it&#039;s fashionable or whatever - frankly I always thought they were weird looking when I saw them before, and I&#039;ve never seen a guy use one, if you&#039;re a guy - but it is supremely functional, especially if you&#039;re short and want full coverage without offending those around you by being a short person with a huge umbrella. You can see through it, and the sharply sloped shape of it deflects the wind much better than your average umbrella. It also feels very sturdy. Not sure if you can find them in Astoria, but I ordered mine from target.com (they don&#039;t sell it in Target stores, either). <br /><br />If you want an emergency umbrella, I recommend just going to Kmart in midtown and picking something up in the meantime. I have an emergency backup umbrella that I keep in my bag if I don&#039;t know whether or not it&#039;ll rain. Totes makes a good automatic open one that is sold at Kmart. I stopped buying those $2 umbrellas at the ABC Superstore after they kept breaking in the strangest ways.

				RE: Gustbuster.<br /><br />Check ebay. I bought 2 a couple of months ago from a guy who had several overstocks from an order<br />he had purchased too much for. He was selling them for $19.95/free delivery. The only problem was that<br />you couldn&#039;t specify a color. However, I ordered 2 and ended up with navy blue, which was fine w/me.<br /><br />They ended up having the JP Morgan/Chase logo on them, but I didn&#039;t care. <br /><br />Actually, I just checked ebay and he&#039;s still selling them. Here&#039;s the link:<br /><br />http://cgi.ebay.com/GustBuster-Metro-Folding-Windproof-Umbrella_W0QQitemZ330414324434QQcmdZViewItemQQptZLH_DefaultDomain_0?hash=item4cee3a7ad2#ht_500wt_960<br /><br />Cut and paste that into your browser and it should take you right to his page. <br /><br />Good luck!<br />

				That&#039;s my problem.&nbsp; I refuse to spend too much on an umbrella because they&#039;re so easy to lose.&nbsp; I had a great Totes one for about a month and dropped it somewhere and didn&#039;t find it again.
