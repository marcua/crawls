				I&#039;ve been seeing more and more cars in Astoria with these yellow covers that make the NY license plate look like a West Virginia plate.Anybody know what that&#039;s all about? I was thinking it may be a way to prevent stoplight cameras from taking pics of the plate?

				reissue of old-style plates is happening. The plate is orange/yellow with blue print. Not a cover.

				What&#039;s with NY changing their license plate every 3 years? I cant keep up.<br /><br />The best one was definitely the mid-late 90s white one with the statue of liberty in the middle.

				Yeah, this is a total revenue generating plan, per the <em>Times</em>: http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/11/nyregion/11plates.html &nbsp;Some lady even started an internet petition against the new plates, according to the article.<br /><br />Does anyone else think that there is something &quot;off&quot; about the new plates? &nbsp;The yellow portion of the plate looks to me like the old white plates filled in with marker or something. &nbsp;Maybe it&#039;s just because I am used to seeing the white plates, but they look strange to me.

				Originally, in The Governor&#039;s budget- the new plates were mandatory. BUT you would have to pay an extra $25 for the privilege of getting them. plus if you wanted one of the theme plates, that was another $30 or something, and if you wanted vanities it was ANOTHER $40 or $50. One of the Gov&#039;t lackeys realized that charging for a STATE mandated change in plates was not a good idea. So now it&#039;s the usual charge for theme plates and/or vanities.

				NYS DMV: &quot;The plan to require all current vehicle registrants to obtain new license plates when their registrations expire has been cancelled. This means you will not be required to purchase new plates when you renew your registration.<br /><br />While the mandatory reissuance of license plates has been cancelled, the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) will begin issuing new Empire Gold (blue and gold) vehicle plates in place of the current Empire (blue and white) plates beginning April 1, 2010. The Empire Gold plates will be phased in gradually as the stock of Empire plates is depleted. Even though your Empire (blue and white) plates will still be valid on your vehicle, those plates will no longer be issued by the DMV when current stocks are gone.&quot;<br /><br />http://www.nydmv.state.ny.us/empgold/faq.htm
