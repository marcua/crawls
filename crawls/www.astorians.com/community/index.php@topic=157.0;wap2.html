			<strong>jayme</strong>:
			<br />
			I'm retiring my sad, old, simple bookshelf stereo and upgrading to something better. &nbsp;Only having never bought proper audio equipment before, I need a bit of guidance.<br /><br />I want a component system with options like this:<br />- radio (NPR)<br />- input line for ipod<br />- input line for turntable<br />- cd player (would love to use DVD player as cd player)<br /><br />Now here is where it gets fuzzy. &nbsp;I'm not sure what I need to be shopping for in order to make that happen. &nbsp;Will just a reciever and speakers do it? &nbsp;And who is the name to know in audio parts? &nbsp;And how to I hook it all up and make music?!<br /><br />Can you offer any words of wisdom? &nbsp;Point me in the right direction?<br /><br />thanks,<br />jayme
