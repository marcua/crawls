				I would like to buy a suit, but it seems that my suit options are limited as a woman (especially as a petite woman). Is there some sort of store for women that is similar to Men&#039;s Warehouse where I can buy a suit tailor-made? Or do you have any suggestions for regular stores that carry good suits for women?

				Have you tried Filene&#039;s basement? They&#039;re pretty good about carrying petite sizes. For whatever reason, I have the best luck when I go to the UWS location. I also have pretty good luck just buying regular sizes and getting a tailor to do the hemming.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m petite too, and I bought a suit last year from Filene&#039;s Basement, Anne Klein, for $100. &nbsp;I believe they have a sale right now on women&#039;s suits so that is one place to try. &nbsp;The most important thing, I found, is to make sure that the jacket fits in the shoulders - you can have it altered, but it&#039;s a complicated alteration that costs more than something simple like taking up the pants hem.

				Macy&#039;s Herald Square has a huge Petites Suit selection, my boss swears by it.&nbsp; Find one of the 15% coupons in the paper and go nuts!

				Thanks everybody. I usually make it to Filene&#039;s once every few weeks, so I&#039;ll have to check out that section when I go again. I&#039;ll also have to look at Macy&#039;s...and Bloomingdale&#039;s I would imagine would also have them as well.<br /><br />My main frustration are jackets not fitting properly - but since all you petite women have had success, perhaps I will as well! (crossing my fingers)

				I&#039;m 5 feet and I know it&#039;s hard to find a suit that doesn&#039;t seem like you stole it from your dad.&nbsp; I go to Anne Taylor.&nbsp; They have a petite section and they often have sales.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I ever bought a suit there for over $100.&nbsp; The cuts are really nice and they are pretty classic.

				Back when I worked in NJ and had to go through Penn Station every day (and wore suits!), I was addicted to buying suits at Macy&#039;s on my way home from work.&nbsp; They have an excellent selection of petites in all price ranges, and I averaged about $100/suit.<br /><br />I have found generally that Kasper/ASL make really well-cut petite suits, so anywhere that has an extensive petites selection and carries them should work.&nbsp; I have not had good luck finding suits at Bloomingdales, though.<br /><br />Talbot&#039;s, when they have sales, is a good place to check as well.&nbsp; The quality is excellent and they do a petite cut well, too.

				After checking a couple of places, including Century 21 and Filene&#039;s Basement, I found some good suits at Daffy&#039;s. I am pretty happy with what I got. I did pay more than $100, but well worth it for a good suit.
