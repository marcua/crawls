				<br />Friends who&#039;ve been staying with me have mentioned that over the past few days (when I was in the city at my day job) that there were many helicopters flying in the area...at one point almost directly over our building.<br /><br />Tonight while on a walk towards the Park, we also noticed a few in the air.<br /><br />And now, Thurs night at 200 a.m., I can clearly hear a low-flying helicopter very near by..sounds to be somewhere north of 20th Ave and Steinway.<br /><br />Anyone know what&#039;s up?

				I hear it too, near 40s and Ditmars. It woke me up. Sounds like its right overhead. I can&#039;t find out why...<br />

				There was a massive search last night Astoria Blvd to 21st Ave from 46 to 48 streets. Helicopter and large police presence on the ground.<br /><br />The 114th tweeted this morning that they found and removed a gun from the streets. I don&#039;t know the details.

				Ah....not sure if related but when out for a walk around maybe 1000p last night, on 21st Ave maybe around 28th Street, we saw that cops had pulled a guy over in a car and he was in cuffs.<br /><br />But either way this all sounds like a huge effort (helipcopters everywhere) all to ....retrieve some gun?&nbsp; Sounds like there&#039;s much more to this story that we don&#039;t know about.

				28Grand ~ agree.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Personally, I do know we were awaken by the loud helicopters overhead and it was around/close to midnight, around the time of the incident at LaGuardia.&nbsp; No evening UN Assembly at that hour (that I&#039;m aware of..).&nbsp; I doze and woke up again&nbsp; :angry:&nbsp; close to 2 a.m. still hovering up there.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Who knows?<br /><br /><br />C&#039;iao ~<br /><br /><br /><br />

				<br />Happened again this morning.&nbsp; I&#039;m at 21st Ave/Steinway.&nbsp; 645 a.m. awoken by a helicopter.&nbsp; It was hovering in the vicinity for at least 30 minutes and then I think it would come and go as...when I was FINALLY able to get back to sleep, I must have still be hearing it, because I then had a dream.... a dream that a hydroplane (you know how things can get confused in a dream...) ...that a hydroplane launching pad was just a bit inside the water&#039;s edge from my home (again, I&#039;m not at the &#039;water&#039;s edge&#039;) ...and in the dream I was like &#039;aha!...there it is right there...the hydroplane launching pad...how did I never notice it before!&#039;<br /><br />I really wish we could get to the bottom of this and figure out what these helicopters are all about.&nbsp; If it continues I will write Costa and Melinda Katz (is that her name?) to see what they can do.&nbsp; We already have to contend with LGA planes taking off (though honestly that sound does not bother me) and the waste treatment plant (which often gives off a noxious rotten egg odor) and then of course we have Rikers.... do we really now need to be designated for some type of helicopter activity (which is very loud and intrusive)?!<br /><br />;-)

				Latest might have been the news copters covering yesterday&#039;s Amtrak accident near Hell Gate. I remember the last big derailment on the viaduct, plenty of chopper action that time. I could see it from my rooftop on 42nd.
