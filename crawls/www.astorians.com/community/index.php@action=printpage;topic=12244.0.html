				The Republican party is often referred to as the party of the rich.&nbsp; The Democratic party has become the party of the rich <strong>and </strong> famous.&nbsp; Do you think the celebrity involvement helps or hurts Democrats?&nbsp; I remember Madonna calling a press conference during the last presidential election primary to endorse Wesley Clark.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t stop laughing thinking wow he got the coveted Madonna endorsement.&nbsp; Celebrities live lives that are so out of touch with most of the population I think their involvement actually hurts the Democrats.

				I don&#039;t think it helps, but I would hope it doesn&#039;t hurt. If anything, it might hurt their careers and not actually the people they&#039;re endorsing. But celebrities are just people who are famous. I don&#039;t think they&#039;re necessarily any more out of touch with most of the population than any other individual is. Being artistic-types, they&#039;re likely to be liberal. They&#039;re allowed their opinions like the rest of us, but unfortunately their opinions are blown all out of proportion and seemingly assigned some great importance because everyone knows who they are. But, everyone also knows that being a celebrity doesn&#039;t make you a political expert or necessarily someone whose opinion on politics carries great significance.<br /><br />As a celebrity, you sort of have to assume that if you speak your opinion regarding the presidential campaign, it&#039;ll make headline news, and people will think you&#039;re an idiot or that you should just shut up and do your job. I don&#039;t think that&#039;s fair, but it comes with the territory. Democrats shouldn&#039;t be punished for that. I do agree, though, that the whole idea of Madonna holding a press conference to endorse a candidate is pretty funny.

				Most artistic people such as actors, artists and musicians tend to be more free-minded, and therefore liberal. I believe it&#039;s nonsense that the Democrats be labelled the party of the rich and famous. After 8 years of actor Ronald Reagan as president, and with Arnold Schwarzenegger as current governor or California, and with actor Fred Thompson having run for Republican president nomination, why is the public still buying this argument?&#160; <br /><br />Celebrities have been involved with both parties over the years. Alot of popular classic Hollywood stars had Republican affiliation, more recently celebrities tend to me Democrats. Does it help or hurt? It depends on the person and how they are involved. For instance, Oprah&#039;s support definitely helped Obama. In general I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a hinderance, unless the opposing party tries to spin it that way.

				I have known people who don&#039;t like the Dems because of the celeb involvement in politics. So, I can&#039;t say that it hurts them a lot, but I know people it has swayed.

				Republican celebrities: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Pitchka/Republican_Celebrities_Page<br /><br />I had no idea Britney Spears was a Republican.&nbsp; Huh.&nbsp; <br /><br />With the media attention given Palin, wouldn&#039;t she qualify as a celebrity?&nbsp; What candidate wouldn&#039;t?&nbsp; And since when did money not play a large part in politics?&nbsp; The things that make headlines these days are just such jokes.&nbsp; There are larger issues out there than seizing on a commonly used lipstick reference.&nbsp; What stupidity.&nbsp; I think media attention paid to non-issues is what hurts both parties.&nbsp; Having celebrities in your party is certainly not unique to Democrats.

I can&#039;t imagine not voting for a member of a political party only because more celebrities endorse him/her than the other one. The fact that some people would think of the Democratic party as a party of &quot;the rich AND famous&quot; because of celebrities&#039; general leaning towards that side is ridiculous; these people forget that millions of non-rich, non-famous people are Democrats too, not to mention that, as daisy pointed out, plenty of rich and famous people are Republicans. I really do not understand how the Republican party has recently had the honor of calling itself the less elitist/less &quot;intellectual&quot; (a term used negatively) party, and that so many people seem to believe it, regardless of the policies the party puts forward. Public image is a strange thing.

				essen, the question wasn&#039;t if it made people not be Democrats, but if it affected the Democratic party. I&#039;m not saying these people would ever have joined the party, but some of them are independent and swing voters.

Every election for President in recently memory has been decided by independents.<br />Celebrity endorsements are a double edged sword. It absolutely helps in primaries and it fills the coffers, but it is very difficult to control when it&#039;s time for the general elections. Doesn&#039;t Barbra Streisand know that she is not helping Obama by giving a concert for his benefit? Sure it may please the base, but more will be turned off than turned on.<br /><br />And when celebrities pull this crap (speaking of Madonna) http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b25748_madonna_kicks_off_tour_with_controversy.html<br /><br />It becomes an anti-endorsement

				Well, the question can be asked, would you rather celebs simply make endorsements, or have them run for office?&nbsp; It seems a lot more republican celebs decide to run for office than dems.&nbsp; Reagan, Arnold, Fred Thomson, Clint Eastwood, Lynn Swan, etc...<br /><br />The only celeb I can think of off the top of my head on the dem side running for office is Al Frankin.

It&#039;s the fact that the *way* celebrities endorse the Democratic party seem to give a certain message about the party. It&#039;s not just celeb endorsements that make the party come across this way. There is a large part of America that gets the feeling from the Dems that their rural lifestyle isn&#039;t appreciated or respected and that they are less intelligent because of their choice of lifestyle and beliefs. There is certainly, especially in NYC and on the internet, the seeming opinion that people who are planning to vote for McCain are less intelligent and not educated on the issues and that those who support Obama are the opposite. I&#039;m not saying that there are not counters to this on the Republican side, I&#039;m just saying that it *seems* that way, especially to a lot of people who don&#039;t live on the blue coasts.<br /><br />I think part of the reason it comes across this way is the way the campaigns are run, but it&#039;s also because there are &quot;sheep&quot; supporting each party who do not look at the full campaign logically and the bandwagon Obama supporters claim logic and reason as being on their side. I think celebrities are the worst example of this and I think it puts a sincere distaste in an independent or swing voter, especially if they are of a rural background.

				I guess a similar effect comes from the Christian right and their increased importance to Republican campaigning. That has more to do with issues than the celebrity-Democrat link does, but it probably puts a similar bad taste in my mouth to those who are turned off by celebrity endorsements.

				If it was the conservatives who were the majority in Hollywood, I&#039;d be annoyed too. But the fact is that it&#039;s a bunch of people expressing their opinions about politics, which are just as valid as mine and yours. <br /><br />As far as the &quot;schlockumentaries&quot;, I see one of those every time McCain or Obama run an ad that goes something like, (Ominous background music)&nbsp; &quot;Obama voted to fund terrorism because he hates America.. is that the kind of person you want in the white house&quot;. <br /><br />And now, I can complain that the smear campaign lies from the political camps themselves are more prevalent from the McCain campaign than the Obama campaign, the politicians(Who are supposed to be more credible than Hollywood Actors).

				I was really excited today when I saw I got a letter in the mail from Leonardo DiCaprio! Knowing that I&#039;ve never written him a letter, I wondered how he could&#039;ve possibly obtained my address and, even more importantly, what he could possibly be writing to me about. So I opened it up, and it&#039;s a letter to save the polar bears. Oh, Leo.... Actor, Environmentalist.<br /><br />EDIT: By the way, if anyone has an opinion on the matter of celebrities in politics and hasn&#039;t seen Team America: World Police, I command you to do so.
