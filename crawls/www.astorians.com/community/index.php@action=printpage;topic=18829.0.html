				I notice that, when it comes to judging candidates for political office, there is something of a fetish for &quot;born-and-raised lifelong&quot; Astorians.<br /><br />On the other hand, &quot;Astoria-is-the-most-diverse-community-in-USA&quot; is a frequent meme here.<br /><br />It would be sort of hard to get that diverse without an influx of outsiders.&nbsp; I would like to see more of these transplanted Astorians running for office.&nbsp; Preferably ones who do not own a beachfront summer palace.

Transplanted Astorians will ruin Astoria and once they have more money, they will go and not want to build this place. Just like a hurricane or a severe storm. Most of them are very liberal anyway and not the hardworking blue collar and immigrant place this once way and still is in a way.

				Clearview, I strongly disagree. I&#039;m a &quot;transplant&quot; and I live and work in Astoria and devote much of my free time to community building. I love this community and work hard to get newcomers to care about their neighborhoods and their neighbors. Right now I&#039;m working with one of the owners of Waltz-Astoria, a lifelong resident of Astoria himself, to plan a benefit for our local library. I love Astoria and I won&#039;t be going anywhere.

If you don&#039;t want to go anywhere and help grow this place, fine. But my message is only aimed at those transplants that would want to go to Williamsburg as soon as they can and they are only staying here because there is no other option. I lived and worked here too and my family transplanted here in the 19th Century just like you did.

				If Clearview means neighborhod is getting even more overdeveloped, and more overpopulated, he is correct.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t mind new people at all, I do not like the tearing down of single family homes to build condos,&nbsp; &nbsp;the destruction of some beutiful old homes especialy ones near Astoria Park, the increased traffic,&nbsp; &nbsp;and construction on every block. <br /><br /><br />14 years ago&nbsp; &nbsp;I learned to drive in fairly deserted area, 35th avenue and 38th street. Movie theare went&nbsp; up, Applebees, more places---35th avenue used to be shortcut to take, and that was only 10-12 years ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;Now it&#039;s congested.&nbsp; &nbsp; The same is true for most of Astoria, and Long Island City is worse.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A few more small parks, some parking space,&nbsp; a playground--that would be nice.&nbsp; Even some gas stations were kicked off land to build condos, on 31st off Broadway, and 34th near 35th street.&nbsp; &nbsp;Developers have run wild over area.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For that I don&#039;t forgive anyone in office--Vallone, Oranato, Gianaris,&nbsp; and worst of all, George Delis, former comunity board leader, who let zoning laws be restructured left and right.
