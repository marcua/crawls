				Well, I didn&#039;t really watch when I saw the Fox News logo......<br /><br />But, Once I heard a year ago that Geitner and Sumners was joining the Obama administration, I did not have high hopes for TRUE reform.

				My born-again MIL has been circulating a clip of the Judge doing a speech, and for that reason alone I hesitate to see what it&#039;s about. I suspect it&#039;s well-meaning and doesn&#039;t focus on his religion though.

				<br />Some hopeful transparency.<br />Was it really 2 trillion of support?<br /><br />http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE62I35320100319<br /><br />In a significant victory for news media, a federal appeals court said the Federal Reserve must disclose records on emergency lending programs to banks bailed out by the government in the financial crisis.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;I don&#039;t think it will be do or die for the Fed&#039;s ability to put emergency programs into place.<br /><br />It will force the Fed to be more forthright and transparent to the public about the terms and conditions.&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I think it was a little over 2 trillion. The vast majority of that was secured lending where banks and other large financial entities could borrow for a short term against government, corporate and mortgage securities that they own. If the bank that borrowed the money doesn&#039;t pay it back, then the government keeps the securities they put up as collateral. This didn&#039;t get much press since it was unlikely that the borrowers would go under in 30 days (the max they could borrow for) and even if they did, the government would just keep the collateral so they&#039;d get paid anyways. The only reason it got any attention outside the financial press is because 2 trillion is such an impressive number. Some people misleading use the $2 trillion number and imply that it was just given to the banks to bail them out like the TARP funds. <br /><br />Even the TARP funds had the banks paying fairly high interest on the money. I forget how much but it was somewhere in the 8%-10% range. Most of the banks have paid that back with interest. The main losses on the TARP have been from AIG, Freddie Mac and FNMA. As they split up AIG, they&#039;ll probably get something back on it but it may not be the full amount. I&#039;m not sure if the loans to the car companies were paid back or if GM/Chrysler will pay them back under the terms of the bankruptcy.<br /><br />The debate of the role of a central bank in the U.S. goes back a LONG time.<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_War<br /><br />As far as Ron Paul, I like him for the most part but his economic policies absolutely scare me.

				Ron Paul reminds me of Lyndon LaRouche. Still, his&nbsp; UFO like view of the world aside, he does make some good economic points. Thanks&nbsp; to FOX News folks at least partly conservative. Still, it would be nice to have a real right-wing station to counter all the left-wing noise.

All is good as long as the collateral value holds.<br /><br /><br />What aspects of the economics trouble you? Possible deflation? A world without govt safety nets?<br />I understand some may find topics unusual, but at very least Paul has been elected and his support has been reaffirmed in his district despite opposition from Dems and even much of the GOP.<br /><br />I was surprised to learn Paul supported Reagan back when most derided him as not fit for DC.<br /><br /><br />
