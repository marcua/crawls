				Hi fellow Astorians,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been thinking about opening a coworking space in Astoria. I&#039;m interested specifically north of Astoria Blvd, preferably a walk-able distance from the N/Q (from 31st St). I, myself WFH (work from home) 2 to 3 times a week, but have been mooching off of various coffee shops in the area, but eventually start feeling self-conscious about being a bit of a freeloader. Other people must feel this way too, right?<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">I think that entrepreneurs, freelancers and <span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font">the self-employed could really take advantage of such a business.</span></span><br /><br />There&#039;s another place in the area that I&#039;m aware of, but that&#039;s near 36th Ave. I could serve those in the northern areas. I would offer offices, monitors, standing desks, communal work tables, conference rooms, a shared printer/copy/fax machine, free coffee (and pastries?). Would be awesome to also have this serve as an event space for networking and community events. Wine/cheese tasting, coffee workshops (and GoT screenings!). Maybe even music.<br /><br />What are you guys&#039; thoughts? An inquiring, entrepreneurial mind wants to know. And is excited at the possibilities.<br /><br />Thanks all!<br /><br />John<br />&nbsp;

				There&#039;s room for more.&nbsp; Manhattan is chock full of coworking spaces.&nbsp; Queens has but one.&nbsp; I would love to hear about more spaces in Queens in general, we could really use it.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t be able to join a Ditmars specific one as I live on an R train route, but I welcome competition because it could mean more places might open up all over Queens, a bonus for all us freelancers.

				I&#039;m a freelancer in the Ditmars area and though I probably wouldn&#039;t make it a permanent work space (I&#039;m too much of a homebody!) I think it would be great to have a space like this and I would definitely be interested in events or occasional work there.<br /><br /><br />I did just see a bunch of new signs for a coworking space posted along Ditmars, but I&#039;m pretty sure the actual location was close to Kaufman.

				Hi daisy and litza,<br /><br />Great to hear that there may indeed be people in the community who could benefit from another coworking space in the area. I would love to create a place where people actually <em>look forward </em>to working in. A place focus, to make connections to benefit your business and/or friends to have a drink with.<br /><br /><strong>daisy</strong>, you could always ride your bike over! If you don&#039;t have I highly recommend it! One thing on my must haves in the space is bike storage. I&#039;m an avid biker myself and appreciate businesses who make the extra effort to accommodate those who bike to work. FYI, May is National Bike Month (:<br /><br /><strong>litza</strong>, I actually live on 27th St right off Ditmars and love the area (been here a little over a year now) and &quot;WFH&quot; about 2 -3 times a week. But I&#039;ve been starting to feel self-conscious working from 60 Beans/Ok Cafe/Locus Cafe. As much as I like them, I always feel like a bit of a free-loader, but that&#039;s me. I have a desk at home, but like to get out and see people (if not necessarily <em>talk </em>to people). I get a bit of cabin fever after a few hours. Cafe Bene is <em>okay,</em> but the music is too loud (and too generic, teen/top 40 for my taste) and I dunno, it&#039;s just not <em>great. </em>So I hope that once I get this place up and running, you&#039;ll come down and spend some time there!<br /><br />What other things would you like to see in a new coworking/event space in the area?<br /><br />Do you have an recommendations regarding location and/or specific building that could work?<br /><br />J<br /><br />

				Thanks for the bike suggestion but I&#039;m probably a bit too far away to really do that - I don&#039;t actually live in Astoria anymore.&nbsp; I would suggest though that you look for a large space and give ample room to the general membership.&nbsp; It&#039;s often hard to find a coworking facility with a good balance between noise and privacy.&nbsp; &nbsp;Most of us join coworking spaces for the benefits of getting out of the house, comradery, etc. but we also have to get work done.&nbsp; So quiet rooms vs kitchen/lounge areas are very helpful.&nbsp; It&#039;s also helpful to design the rooms so that the desks aren&#039;t all in the line of constant sight and traffic.&nbsp; Most of us work on non-disclosure agreements so having eyes on visual work isn&#039;t ideal.&nbsp; I would get private office space but it&#039;s out of my budget which is why coworking is a better option.&nbsp; <br /><br />The other items that are great to have is a conference room, telephone privacy rooms, lockers for storage, security, printer/copier/scanner, kitchen.

				I would be VERY into this. I&#039;m a freelancer who works from home quite a bit (also with kids here sometimes) and man have I thought about this a lot. I have been meaning to visit the co-working space already in Astoria, but being closer to Ditmars (60 Beans/NY Coffee &amp; Bagel territory) it just seems like if I&#039;m going to have to hop on the train a few stops I may as well go to Manhattan. <br /><br /><br />For me, the sense of community and networking and stuff is cool -- however, I&#039;d love the option to have quiet space (even a little office, etc) to work in rather than big boisterous open layout. Sometimes just trying to find a decent place to sit and have a professional conference call is really challenging for me. <br /><br /><br />Hope this takes off! Very much needed around here.

				Thanks daisy. Your suggestions are on my list&nbsp; :smiley: <br /><br />Hey giantcookie,<br /><br />I understand the need for screen privacy and will definitely address this by having options of both open layout and/or more traditional cubicle spaces. Interestingly, open layouts (I&#039;ve worked in a few) aren&#039;t as loud and boisterous as you might think. I don&#039;t mind open layouts, as long as people aren&#039;t right on top of each other. That buffer of personal space is efficient for my focus.<br /><br />Like you, I live near Ditmars and so my goal is to find a someplace north of Astoria Blvd and as close to 31st Street as possible. Be on the lookout in the next few months, maybe you can be our first member!<br /><br />

				I would so love to have a great coworking space in Astoria! I was a member of Create NY space last year before it closed (over by Kaufman) and it was a real treasure. Open seating with really interesting furniture in a space that doubled as an art gallery. Great people running it and a fun mix of fellow freelancers and self-employed folks. I made some great professional connections there. Absolutely loved biking there in the morning, putting in a full day&#039;s work, then biking home. Although I can be a homebody and there are certain types of work I prefer to do at home, there&#039;s something about going &quot;to work&quot; that&#039;s a nice feeling. Helps you switch off at home and enjoy downtime when you get back home. <br /><br /><br />I rarely work at coffee shops because I feel awkward about the mooch factor--usually I drop by one only when cabin fever sets in. I&#039;ve been told that Queens Collective is quite good but it is pricey for my budget and seems a bit like a standard office space you might find in corporate land. Nothing wrong with that, but not necessarily what I&#039;m looking for either. If you do open up a coworking space, @itsjohngee, you can be sure I&#039;ll drop by. In the meantime, for those looking, SpareChair is a fun option (they recently did a coworking pop-up at QED) and Freelancer&#039;s Union has free coworking space--but that&#039;s in Manhattan and Brooklyn.<br /><br />

				I actually didn&#039;t like Create NY because they didn&#039;t have enough plugs or a printer.&nbsp; It was casual and the owners friendly but I really needed a place that had grounded plugs and plenty of them.&nbsp; When I went, I had to ask for an extension cord just to plug in my laptop and it ended up being one of those flimsy dollar store ones.&nbsp; One power surge and all my work would be gone.&nbsp; It was also next to a school playground, and hard to concentrate with the screaming children, lol.<br /><br />Queens Collective is actually really great but more geared to those who can afford private work space or dedicated desks. They may expand at some point and perhaps then it&#039;ll have more room for regular freelancers.&nbsp; It&#039;s a bummer there&#039;s only one option in the whole of Queens.&nbsp; Manhattan has them by the dozens and a lot of really good ones too.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck Itsjohngee!&nbsp; Keep us posted!

				Hi <strong>hikaruhana</strong>,<br /><br />Create NY had a great idea, but needed a little refining. Their prices seem a bit too low to sustain itself, which I&#039;m just guessing is why they had to close. Queens Collective has a more &quot;traditional&quot; pricing structure that will likely help them thrive. And it Create NY&#039;s neighborhood, no less.<br /><br />And as <strong>daisy </strong>mentioned about a lack of printer and available outlets, sounds like the may have rushed into things. I spent a couple of days at QNS Collective and quite enjoyed it. I noticed many people come in an out at random day hours, while others spent the entire day there. Offices are rented and there definitely was a sense of community.<br /><br />My goal is to open by the end of the year. I&#039;m thinking a NYE opening party :cheesy: . Where everyone contributing to this thread is invited!<br /><br />In the meantime, please feel free to drop in on this thread with suggestions, comments and any general thoughts that you think could be helpful!<br /><br />John
