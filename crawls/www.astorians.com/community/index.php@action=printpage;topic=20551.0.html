				Good luck in looking for them. It would be much more easier to just get the frozen ones from Chinese supermarket or the new health food store at ditmars sells the Annie Chun&#039;s mini-wonton and cook them yourself. Only takes 10 mins! <br /><br />I wrap my own dumplings since I&#039;d like to know what go into them&nbsp; &nbsp;:-). It&#039;s faster to boil them up than call for Chinese take out&nbsp; :lol:<br /><br />

				Yea there&#039;s no such a thing as soup dumplings in Astoria :(. <br /><br />You definitely can freeze them. You can find them in the frozen section in a Chinese supermarket. Of course it&#039;s not as good as the ones in the restaurants but they are ok for instant craving :). <br /><br />UMMM I wonder if the buffet place on 42nd at Ditmars has it. I think it&#039;s called La Guardia Seafood Restaurant.

				Not sure if this is what you mean but Happy Gathering Feng Garden 32-20 34th Ave, 718.729.4488 has a section on their menu called Noodles Soup Specialties and they have some items like Roast Pork &amp; Shrimp Dumplings Soup; Roast Pork &amp; Chicken Dumplings Soup...etc.&nbsp; Never had it so can&#039;t vouch for them.

Gotta go once a month for them :) I heard the best is in Joe&#039;s Shanghai in Chinatown but I&#039;ve never got the patience for the long line at all time.

				I will second Nan Xiang. The pork soup dumplings are ridiculous. So so so yummy! If you haven&#039;t ever had soup dumplings, you must try them soon. And I do think it is tradition to scald the crap out of your mouth.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D

				Oh soup dumplings aka xiao long bao.&nbsp; Now you&#039;ve done it to me too!&nbsp; I want some!<br /><br />Chinatown or Flushing&#039;s really your best bet.&nbsp; I had them at Joe&#039;s Shanghai (I believe they are a Shanghainese specialty) and loved them there but a Chinese friend said there were better places to go.&nbsp; Oddly (he usually&nbsp; has excellent food radar) the place we went to didn&#039;t work out.&nbsp; I&#039;d go to Chowhound.com and do a search for soup dumplings or xiao long bao.&nbsp; People there are likely to have strong opinions and good recommendations.<br /><br />Enjoy!

				Can you imagine a place like this in Astoria with a kitchen staff like that? I like the slo mo replay of the guy messing up his first attempt at eating the dumpling.<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbMwT3pLP3c<br /><br />He travels to Taipei and gets it right. A four story temple to the soup dumpling! Interesting set up. You order BEFORE entering the restaurant to speed things up.<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kcCpmhnrxM&amp;feature=related<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I second Joe&#039;s Shanghai. The one in Chinatown has 8 for about 4 bucks. Their scallion pancakes are awesome as well, as are their noodle soups. Their entrées are delicious too but a little too pricey compared to their other prices (and they don&#039;t even come with rice.) It&#039;s well worth the trip!

				If you want the real deal and don&#039;t want to have to go all the way out to Flushing, you can also hit up places in Elmhurst down the street (so to speak).<br /><br />Check out this place called Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House http://www.yelp.com/biz/lao-bei-fang-dumpling-house-elmhurst &nbsp;(http://www.yelp.com/biz/lao-bei-fang-dumpling-house-elmhurst).<br /><br />Not only are they authentic but cheap too!&nbsp; They also sell them here frozen so you can bring this cultural treat home and make at your own convenience.
