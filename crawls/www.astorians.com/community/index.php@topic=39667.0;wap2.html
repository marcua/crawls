			I am very sad about this loss to the neighborhood. I enjoyed many meals at Wave Thai, as well as take out many times, too. They&#039;ve had the doors open to auction off their equipment, and I had a chance to express my thanks and sorrow to a young woman who&#039;s worked there for a while. They don&#039;t have plans for a relocation right now, but encouraged tracking them on the Wave Thai Facebook page.<br /><br /><br />They provided MANY wonderful meals for me, and certainly never got wealthy in the process. Wishing them well.

			I like Bangkok Tasty, too. I found Wave Thai and Bangkok Thai to be good for different things. Will miss Wave Thai. Curious about Boon Chu 2. I went there once soon after they opened and wasn&#039;t impressed. Maybe I should give it another try? It has always looked empty when I&#039;ve walked by, which hasn&#039;t been encouraging, either.

The food itself is good.&nbsp; We do takeout.&nbsp; Another excellent new Thai place is on 30th.&nbsp; The only issue I had is it&#039;s VERY tight and claustrophobic.&nbsp; Cool d√©cor and space but I prefer more room from my neighbors. https://www.yelp.com/biz/pochana-thai-kitchen-astoria-2
