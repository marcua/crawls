				Hey All - <br /><br />I met a bunch of you at the Astorians Mixer this week (hi, again!) but for those I didn&#039;t get a chance to chat with, I wanted to share with you a great way to meet fellow Astorians!<br /><br />Playing Dodgeball or 3-on-3 Basketball with fellow Astorians is a great way to meet people in your area.&nbsp; You can join the charity-focused league as a whole team (an Astorians.com team maybe?) or as an individual/small group and we&#039;ll place you on a team.<br /><br />Then after the games, everyone meets up for organized happy hours at local bars!&nbsp; Pretty awesome, huh?<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;d love to see an Astorians team (or at least a bunch of individuals) join the league, so feel free to reply to this post, or email me at alyssa@zogsports.org for more info.&nbsp; You can register for both leagues at www.zogsports.org<br /><br />Hope to see you all out there this winter!

				Actually, it&#039;s not!&nbsp; In fact, I&#039;ll print the prices right here so everyone can see them.<br /><br />For a FULL season of Dodgeball (which is 6 regular season games and more if you make playoffs), it&#039;s $800/team (for a roster of 12 players, which works out to about $66 each) and $75 for an individual.&nbsp; As&nbsp; a member of a team, that works out to <strong>about $11 a game</strong>.<br /><br />For a FULL season of 3-on-3 Basketball (which is 8 regular season games and one scrimmage - more games if you make playoffs), it&#039;s $745/team (for a roster of 6-7 players, which works out to about $106 each) and $130 for an individual.&nbsp; As a member of a team, that works out to <strong>about $11.70 a game</strong>.<br /><br />Hope to see you all out there this winter!&nbsp; Please feel free to write me with ANY questions.<br /><br />Again, you can register at www.zogsports.org.&nbsp;

				$75 to play recreational athletics is a little ridiculous if you ask me, but that&#039;s my opinion. You&#039;re more than welcome to think that&#039;s a fair price, but I disagree.

				Of course, and we are sad that you will not be joining us!&nbsp; <br /><br />For everyone else, it should also be added that a portion of this goes to charity.&nbsp; In fact, it goes to charities our teams select themselves!&nbsp; Each team picks a charity to play for at the beginning of the season.&nbsp; During the season, we cull together a portion of what they pay to be in the league, as well as money from our partner bars where we send teams for happy hours.&nbsp; At the end of the season, that money is given to winning teams in checks made out to their chosen charities.<br /><br />To explain further, the rest of the cost goes to renting field and gym space, paying referees, and obtaining gym equipment.&nbsp; To date we have more than <strong>35,000 people playing with us</strong> in all 4 locations.&nbsp; We have a lot of Astorians who are already planning to join us, many who joined us in the fall for our inaugural season, and we hope many more of you to come!<br /><br />

				it&#039;s really not too bad.&nbsp; zog has to pay for refs and everything, and they give some money to charities.<br /><br />any chance of getting a a kickball league?

				We are definitely considering doing kickball, but that would be in the spring or summer rather than winter so we don&#039;t all freeze standing on the field!

				It&#039;s actually a good price.&nbsp; Let&#039;s not also forget about $ to rent the facilities, and I&#039;m sure a little to take home for the people that actually run it.&nbsp; Those are actually really fair prices.

				I guess I&#039;m just used to living in places where you don&#039;t have to pay fees to play community sports. I&#039;m no athlete; I&#039;m kinda cheap; so I guess that&#039;s where my perspective comes from. I guess I&#039;d rather have someone ask me to buy a ball and bring it with me than pay for a league. I didn&#039;t mean to harp on the program so much (I could have expressed my opinion less negatively), as I do think it&#039;s a great idea and I like playing for causes, I just wish more communal things didn&#039;t cost money. It seems like you have to pay for the friends you make in this city, which has been really bumming me out lately.<br /><br />Sorry about that, Zog!

				i hear you, paratactical, everything is so expensive and it stresses me out, too.&nbsp; i also have commitment issues, which got in the way last time i tried to participate in a zog sports league.&nbsp; i waited too long and it was full, but i felt like if i was paying i HAD to go every week, and i have enough stuff i HAVE to do, i was looking for a more laid back hobby.<br /><br />-the least athletic person ever, who is also cheap.

				That&#039;s a definite consideration for the spring or summer seasons.&nbsp; Are other Astorians interested in softball?&nbsp; <br /><br />In the meantime, consider signing up for this season of 3-on-3 Basketball!

				I can catch and hit but need a lot of work on my throwing skills...&nbsp; I got a little better at throwing last summer from playing catch on the beach every weekend but I am still unpredictable once my arm gets tired :(&nbsp; It&#039;s sad because I use to be really good when I was younger.&nbsp; <br /><br />Are these ZogSports teams really competitive?&nbsp; I would LOVE to play.
