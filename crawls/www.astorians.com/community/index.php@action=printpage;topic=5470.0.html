				Recently, pundit Anne Coulter made the following statement:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I was going to have a few comments on the other Democratic presidential candidate, John Edwards, but it turns out that you have to go into rehab if you use the word &#039;faggot,&#039; so I&#039;m - so, kind of at an impasse, can&#039;t really talk about Edwards, so I think I&#039;ll just conclude here and take your questions</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Edwards responded that her remarks were &quot;Un-American&quot; and &quot;Indefensible&quot;<br /><br />Un-American?&nbsp; When did expressing one&#039;s opinion become un-american?

				I think he was trying not to call her a bigot. <br /><br />And I don&#039;t think Coulter really thinks he is a f***t. So she isn&#039;t expressing her opinion, she is hate-mongering. If calling someone a f***t - as a slur, to insult them - is permissable, how can we say that tolerance is important? <br /><br />I don&#039;t see any difference between calling him a f****t and calling him a n****r.<br /><br /><br />she is just being the anorexic b**tch we all love to hate.

				I&#039;m with Frappe on this one, as unpopular as that seems to be at this point judging by the negative nods.<br /><br />Ann Coulter annoys me greatly... she is indeed an idiot, but all of this media attention is pretty much giving her exactly what she wants, namely, attention. Ignoring foolish comments like hers instead of getting all indignant about it is (in my not so humble opinion) the best approach.

				I don&#039;t see it that way. <br /><br />B* and F* are both &quot;not very nice things to say about people&quot;. <br /><br />But &quot;bitch&quot; generally means &quot;you are a mean woman&quot;. It&#039;s an insult to one woman in particular, not women in general.<br /><br />F* - means &quot;gay person&quot; but is also a slur. It&#039;s basically a way of saying &quot;You&#039;re gay and therefore bad&quot; or &quot;I find you as detestable as a gay person&quot;. <br /><br />I would call someone a bitch if they were unkind/mean/vindictive/selfish, or if they just pissed me off. <br /><br />I would never, ever, under any circumstances, call someone a f*. That is not just saying &quot;you&#039;ve pissed me off/I don&#039;t like you/etc.&quot; you&#039;re also insulting a whole 10th of the population by using that word as an insult. <br /><br />Would it be an American exercize of free speech to call someone a n*, a k*, or another slur? <br /><br />Coulter does not just insult John Edwards and all the gay people of America, she tells us that she really has nothing of substance to say about him. Calling him a f***, in this circumstance, was a way of dismissing him, of NOT exercising her freedom of speech, because she had nothing real to say about him. Coulter could have said something meaningful, intelligent, and well-thought-out about JE. (Stop to &nbsp;:-D &nbsp;:-D &nbsp;:-D) She passed on the chance to say something interesting and instead used a slur that I think most of us here do not approve of and would not use ourselves. <br /><br />I can&#039;t get excited about defending her freedom of speech on this. I wouldn&#039;t approve of her being jailed for it, but for Edwards to call what she said &quot;Un-American&quot; in no way impedes her freedom of speech. He gets to express his opinion too. At least his had *some* thought behind it. <br /><br />Edit after seeing KFF&#039;s post:<br />I agree that she may be best ignored, but I didn&#039;t see that as being Frappe&#039;s point. I suppose you could also make an argument that to ignore extremism is to silently condone it ... but that would be another argument and another post.

				&quot;Bitch&quot;, in its simplest form, is used as a derogatory term for a woman, and some feel that when it is used, it reflects on all women.&nbsp; Some, however, find its use to be somewhat empowering, even when its flung in an agressive way.&nbsp; See:&nbsp; Bitch Magazine (http://bitchmagazine.com), a fabulous periodical highlighting the &quot;feminist response to pop culture&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />I no longer consider it to be a blanket negative term, and I know I&#039;m not the only one here who has used or perceived &quot;bitch&quot; on the flip side.&nbsp; Context is everything.

				What was your original point, Frappe? Are you playing Devil&#039;s Advocate or do you truly believe that Coulter&#039;s freedom to call John E. a f* should be vigorously defended?<br /><br />I guess I don&#039;t see it as a freedom of speech issue, because I don&#039;t see freedom of speech as having the right to say whatever without being called &quot;un-American.&quot; I think being able to call people un-American is an aspect of free speech. <br /><br />I see freedom of speech more as I won&#039;t have my hand cut off (as Elizabeth I did to one of her detractors) or be thrown in jail for expressing my opinions, unless I chose to express myself in a way that harms others. I see using a slur like that one as harmful, and unjustifiable. <br /><br />Then again, it&#039;s Coulter. Very, very easy to take her too seriously.

				This is reminding me of the attack on Noam Chomsky when he defended someones right to say the Holocaust never existed...the bottom line is that you do have the right to say it, and we ALL should defend the right to the freedom to say it. She is crass and obnoxious, but what should we do, provide a list of words that we are not allowed to use or say in the media? Stinks of censorship. <br /><br />Her poor choice of words and opinions we disagree with should be enough to show her for what she is and for us not to pay attention. Some will listen and maybe be colored by her presentation, but that is a consequence of free speech and not right I am willing to sacrifice because someone might hear it and either subscribe to her opinions or get offended. <br /><br />I guess Jtrane put it best. <br /><br />

As far as I can tell, there has been no censorship here.<br /><br />I know, I know - way too much attention for Stick Thing. <br /><br />I do think that the larger issue of freedom of speech is worthy of attention.

				I find it interesting that in this thread there have been now three insults to Ann Coulter&#039;s body type.&nbsp; And her body type or how much she weighs or what she looks like IS NOT the point of this whole nasty, unfortunate incident.&nbsp; <br /><br />I dislike Ann Coulter&#039;s political and social stance on things as much as the next person, but find the criticisms of her by way of her weight completely irrelevant and unnecessary

				Okay, it isn&#039;t censorship, but her saying what she wants is American. Calling it un-american is a distraction to us. Calling anything un-american as far as I am concerned is a distraction from what someone is saying or representing. You want to offend someone, and get the general public to disregard what is said, call it un-american and everyone will rail against it.<br /><br />Why is it un-american? It isn&#039;t. It is bigoted and prejudiced, and uninformed....so far I know a lot of americans like that.

				I guess I don&#039;t think that their are values that are unique to being &quot;American&quot;...this isn&#039;t something that we can define. We are a diverse group, so I would have a really difficult time identifying an &quot;American&quot; value or moral, more so a human one..... <br /><br />Rather, when I hear someone say un-american, I thnk more of an act or an opinion agains the concept of &quot;Amercia&quot; ...therefore the term was incorrectly used with regards to her comment. In my humble opinion. <br /><br />Regarding Coulter, of course we have the right to disagree with her...we disagree a lot, I think more the question was, why is she un-american for saying it...she&#039;s just an asshole.

				I do think Ann Coulter has the right to say whatever she wants, but I think we should keep in mind that she says awful and provocative things to get media attention and sell her books.&nbsp; I think John Edwards called her Un-American in the sense that America, to many people, represents tolerance and diversity, though folks are right that there are many people who find the diversity threatening and who are racists, sexists, homophobes, etc.&nbsp; I am glad that she&#039;s getting some negative backlash, but I&#039;m sure this entire incident is only making her hardcore fans race out and buy that next book of hers.&nbsp; She&#039;s really quite repugnant and I wish her career would stumble, though I doubt that it is happening anytime soon.
