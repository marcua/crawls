				I have two tickets to next Friday&#039;s game against the Brewers (April 17), and I can&#039;t go. <br /><br />It is the first homestand ever at Citi Field. My tickets are in the uppser deck by the outfield, but I went to an exhibition game and the seats aren&#039;t bad. <br /><br />I will sell the 2 for a total of 80 bucks, or best offer. Email me at liman73@aol.com or call me (516) 297-9789. I live in the Ditmars area.<br /><br /><strong>Tickets are Promenade, Section 531, Row C, Seats 8 and 9</strong><br /><br />Let&#039;s Go Mets!!!<br /><br />-Andrew

				Wow, $80 for two tickets that have a $23 face value for a game that isn&#039;t even sold out? Sweet deal! Not trying to kill your deal, but based on what&#039;s available from the team and on stubhub, I would be shocked if someone paid more than $50 for them.

				Haha fair enough. I did say &quot;or best offer.&quot; If someone offers me 50 I would sell them. Just looking to get them to someone who wants to go to a Mets game...

				Does anyone know where you can find out which seats have an overhang for shade?&nbsp; I love going to day games but I really can&#039;t be in direct sunlight for too long due to my extremely fair complexion.&nbsp; &nbsp;Looking at the Citifield website, it&#039;s really hard to tell what&#039;s what.

And the bottom half of secion [whatever] may be in sun, while the top half is in the shade. Yes, it&#039;s a common question, but most people just buy based on price. You can get more specific when you&#039;re on the phone with an actual ticket agent. That&#039;s probably why they don&#039;t have it online.

				I went to citifield recently and we had $23 seats.. we were way towards the top, in a shaded area. I believe most of the cheap seats along the third base line and left field are under the roof thing, protected from rain too.<br /><br />Our tickets were level 500, section 527.
