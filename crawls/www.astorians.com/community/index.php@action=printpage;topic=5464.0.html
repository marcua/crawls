				Hey everyone, don&#039;t forget that:<br /><br />Beginning in 2007, most of the United States begins Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m. on the second Sunday in March and reverts to standard time on the first Sunday in November. In the U.S., each time zone switches at a different time.<br /><br />So check your clocks, computers, and all other devices that you have that keeps time and make sure it actually changes!<br /><br />

				I wonder how this is going to work for the electronics that usually change themselves. I know that my computer will be okay because Apple installed something recently that had to do with DST. But I wonder what will happen to the VCRs. If I change them this weekend, then they will automatically change themselves the way they were obviously programmed to do . . . then I have to change them back? That means 4 times a year per VCR?

				Mama Mac, you could always do what I do.&nbsp; Spend half the year with the time correct and the other half with the clock being one hour off.&nbsp; Truthfully, that&#039;s only what I do with my stupid car clock.&nbsp; I&#039;m really excited to have the correct time this weekend. It drives me nuts.

				The law doing this was passed in August of 2005 so any devices manufactured after that date--or, I imagine a reasonable peroid after--have already had the changes built into their code.&nbsp; Many software companies (including Microsoft and as is stated above, Apple) have already installed patches to account for the change.&nbsp; At least, that&#039;s what I&#039;ve read and hopefully it&#039;s correct.

				You can download patches for Microsoft and Apple software.&nbsp; Just go to their websites, and you should be able to find them.

				I had to manually change the clock on my iBook, but things are fine.<br /><br />I can&#039;t get over how great it feels to have daylight longer!&nbsp; This is one of my favorite adjustments in the year.&nbsp; Getting an hour less of sleep is totally worth it.&nbsp; :mrgreen:
