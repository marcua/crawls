				Thanks for all the replies.&nbsp; A bunch of people are coming over tonight and tomorrow, so this place will probably be taken in the very near future.&nbsp; Astorians.com is the spot!

				Did you ever wind up finding someone to take over the lease?<br /><br />If so, can you tell me how she found the place, and if it was a broker, which broker?<br /><br />We will be looking soon for that exact kind of apartment (we curerntly live in a similar-sounding building near 30th Ave, but the electrical system of the building needs a complete overhaul and is currently a fire hazard...thanks!

				The saga is finally over; after about a half-dozen people came by to check out the place, a few went ahead and tried to get in touch with the management company.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there was some confusion in their office, and people were getting turned away, being told that the apartment was taken.&nbsp; After that was straightened out, it went OK, if slowly; the lease was signed this past Friday.&nbsp; <br />Thanks for all the replies, and best wishes to those still looking for places!
