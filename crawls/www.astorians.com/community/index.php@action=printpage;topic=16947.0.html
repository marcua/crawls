				A couple weeks ago, I went over to Zabb Thai (30th Ave, betw. 33-34th Sts, I think) to order some takeout, and much to my dismay arrived to find them closed, and the dining area completely cleared out.<br /><br />My first thought was that they had closed (Nooo!), but one of the guys (manager/owner?) came out to the door when he saw me sadly peering in. He said that they&#039;re just changing a little-- more sushi-oriented, but they will still have some Thai food as well. He said they should be reopening by the &quot;end of the month&quot;.<br /><br />Just FYI...

				Good to hear.&nbsp; We called the other night and no one picked up.&nbsp; We were worried we had lost them for good.

				Passed by today... the restaurant&#039;s new name is &quot;Matsu.&quot; The stone relief with Thai figures that used to be on the wall is in pieces on the floor and there&#039;s some weird green bamboo pole thingies propped up by the door.<br />

				Funny you should say that... there&#039;s a Japanese place in the city called Go Go Curry, which pays homage to Matsui. &quot;Go&quot; means five in Japanese, hence their name is &quot;5-5 Curry&quot;. :)<br /><br />http://www.gogocurryusa.com/<br />

				Any word if Matsu is open for business yet? Or if they have menus available? <br /><br />I&#039;m really curious to know how much of the menu will be devoted to Thai dishes... (fingers crossed for keeping sweet &amp; sour duck and green curry)

				I think they had the menu in the window when I passed by yesterday. I didn&#039;t look at it, though... there were a bunch of ppl working inside so I felt a little weird about staring in the window. :)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=16947.msg186669.html#msg186669">Quote from: artgirl on December 30, 2009, 11:14:03 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Any word if Matsu is open for business yet?

				I passed by last night and looked at the new menu.&nbsp; It&#039;s a conventional Japanese teriyaki/sushi menu, plus pad thai.<br /><br />They&#039;re going to have to be pretty great to compete in this area glutted with Japanese restaurants (then again, we&#039;re glutted with Thai restaurants, too).

				Well, to be fair, the only sushi place in that immediate area is GoWasabi, which is pretty meh. <br /><br />JJ&#039;s isn&#039;t too far from there either, but when I lived at my old place, it was a schlep if you were looking to get a quick bite or if the weather was crappy.)
