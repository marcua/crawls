				Hey, all.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking for visual artists (photographers, installation, painters, film, sculptors, etc.) for a monthly event that will begin soon at Freeze Peach Cafe (get it? I think the name is funny as hell). We&#039;re going to do what may be the first real art parties in Astoria and I&#039;m really excited about this. This is the Whiskey Dregs expansion that I dreamt up a while ago. Please let me know if you are interested or have friends who are interested. The space is limited but the good times are not. You know how we do things.<br /><br />This is a great opportunity to sell and showcase your or your friend&#039;s work. I&#039;m trying to have mostly Astoria-based artists but I have an open mind. Please submit a copy of your work (pictures of your stuff, silly). You know our style more or less so consider what the Whiskey Dregs do when inquiring.<br /><br />There may also be an opportunity for DJs so take that info, wrap it up tight and put it in your pocket for later.<br /><br />Viva la revolucion,<br /><br />Carlos<br />whiskeydregs@gmail.com

				I am not familiar with the wiskeydregs.<br />Do you have a website?<br />Are you going to do more of these events at the Freeze Peach?

				Yes, we do these events often. The last one was a great success so the momentum is up, up, up. <br /><br />We have another event at Waltz tonight. Go to www.whiskeydregs.com for more info about festivities. Hopefully, you can come and have some drinks with us...some silly Astorian fun.

				there was some good stuff at the previous event at the waltz, but how come there is no whiskey?<br /><br />there was plenty of dregs, but no whiskey to be found. whiskey is a big selling point for me. :rock:

				Yes. I agree but there are plenty of other good wines, a nice variety of beer and sangria (which is f&#039;ing delightful).
