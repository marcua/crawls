				You Tube is&nbsp; a farce. Still, no cop or anyone in authority should do &#039;whatever&nbsp; they want.&#039;&nbsp; Of course, I worked in Newark,part time at the airport, for&nbsp; a couple&nbsp; of years in the late 80&#039;s&nbsp; and&nbsp; it was a &#039;bad&#039;&nbsp; place, so it&#039;s no wonder cops&nbsp; have a &#039;bad&#039; attitude.

				It&#039;s not the reporters in Newark who need to be choke slammed.&nbsp; It&#039;s the relentless drug dealers and gang members.&nbsp; My organization does some work in Newark, and it&#039;s sad.&nbsp; The city is so beautiful, with historic buildings, close to NY, good port access.&nbsp; But always held back by the criminal element.

				I have to agree...I spent some time in Newark, and it was pretty sad to see how a city the state the city is in, and what the city could potentially be.<br /><br />Newark has great connections by road, rail and air, a huge port, a nice downtown area with wide streets, parks, spacious sidewalks, some very beautiful buildings.&nbsp; A clean subway system and a monorail.&nbsp; Seven hospitals...quite a lot for a city Newark&#039;s size.&nbsp; A pretty vibrant academic community.&nbsp; Some nice cultural attractions, museums, concert halls, stadiums.&nbsp; And of course, it is just a few minutes away from NYC.<br /><br />And yet...it&#039;s Newark.&nbsp; Crime, drug and gang-ridden, which has really kept people out and held the city back.&nbsp; Though, if you&#039;re looking for cheap housing, there&#039;s plenty to be found there.&nbsp; It&#039;s quite possible to find a luxury 2BR apartment in a new building right in downtown Newark, with a doorman, parking, gym, etc. for less than $1,000 a month.&nbsp; &nbsp;Great deal, until you step outside and realize there&#039;s no stores and no one walking around after dark.&nbsp; Oh well!
