				Thought it would be fun to list who we&#039;ve seen in our years of living in the city:<br /><br />Susan Sarandon in Soho on Prince Street, last Tuesday. Had to do a double take because she was so casually&nbsp; dressed, big dark glasses (obviously), that you could have missed her.<br />Epatha Merkerson (Law &amp; Order Lieutenant) by Duane Reed on 57th and Broadway, 3 weeks ago.<br />Sean Combs on Broadway and 55th &#039;bout 4 months ago with a bodyguard or friend? <br /><br />Previous years: <br />Jesse L. Martin (Det. Green, Law and Order)*wow* he&#039;s really hot. We just kept smiling at one another as I turned back to look again. :lol:&nbsp; &nbsp;8th and 55th<br />Helen Hunt, 8th and 52nd<br />Maria Bartiromo-she&#039;s gorgeous in person, too. 57th and 7th<br />Isabella Rossallini at a hotel bar on 7th and 56th<br />Barbara Walters on Park and 55th<br />Roy Scheider (police chief Martin Brody from Jaws)<br />Robert Kennedy Jr. on Park and 52nd<br />Wallace Shawn (from Princess Bride) first I heard THE VOICE, can&#039;t miss that, talking on his cell phone, walking down Park and 55th<br /><br />

				I saw him back in &#039;92 with GNR for the Metallica/Guns N&#039; Roses Summer Tour.&nbsp; I just recently saw him last Summer playing with Alice in Chains and Heart (two of my most fave bands) at the Trump Plaza.&nbsp; He looks a lot better these days than he did back in the GNR days.&nbsp; That&#039;s for sure.<br /><br />on topic.<br /><br />I saw Ben Stiller walking by the Ed Sullivan Theater.&nbsp; He seemed like the most laid back normal dude.&nbsp; Even shaking a few hands as he walked by.&nbsp; <br /><br />and not that he&#039;s a big time celebrity, I&#039;d say most people would probably consider him J list, but I&#039;ve seen Christian Finnegan countless times.&nbsp; He&#039;s a comedian (who is HILARIOUS) who does &quot;Best Week Ever&quot; on VH1.&nbsp; He&#039;s been on The Chappelle Show and he does vignettes on VH1 specials, as well as stand-up.&nbsp; From what I understand he possibly lives here in Astoria.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen him at the Broadway Street Fair and I also have seen him numerous times hanging out at the now defunct Cassidys on Broadway.&nbsp; &nbsp;

What it was I have no idea. I&#039;m not always kept in the loop. <br /><br />I don&#039;t often have celebrity encounters where I actually realize it at the time.

				I wish I could see more stars through all the light pollution. Oh how I miss my roof at my old apt.<br /><br />Thread topic related...<br />For those who are truly interested in seeing &quot;stars&quot; - go to gallery exhibit openings. Here&#039;s a brief list of those I&#039;ve seen and/or met while at exhibit openings:<br />Axl Rose <br />Molly Ringwald<br />Meryl Streep<br />John McEnroe<br />Susan Sarandon<br /><br />That&#039;s all that comes to mind at the moment, but there have been more plus my friend who works in a gallery is constantly naming stars who come by.<br /><br />Big pansy was in my surgeon&#039;s office once. I found that sighting very funny for some reason. Maybe it was the painkillers.<br />Munch from L&amp;O<br />Melina K. from CSI<br />A main guy from Veronica Mars at McCann&#039;s last year (don&#039;t watch the show so I don&#039;t know his name, but my friend, a fan, talked to him and confirmed. He has friends in our hood). Random.<br />Cynthia Nixon<br />Al Franken<br />Rosario Dawson<br />Peter Dinklage<br />Ethan Hawke<br />Etc. <br /><br />We all probably come across stars so often that it has gotten to the point where it is not worth mentioning it unless said star does something ridiculous, but since I never listed them out or anything, thought I&#039;d add to the thread. What I find hilarious is when all my friends outside of NYC ask about the latest star sighting. It happens allllll the time. Ugh.<br />
