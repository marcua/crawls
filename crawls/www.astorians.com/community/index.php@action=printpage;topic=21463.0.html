				I am looking for a new daycare for my toddler and also for an infant which will be joining our family shortly. I would need for both of them to be in the same facility, many schools only take 2 or 3 years and up but that wouldn&#039;t work for us.<br /><br /><br />If anyone has any good referrals for daycare facilities in the area that would be great. We&#039;re looking more for a daycare center, open year round, since we really don&#039;t have the ability to keep the kids home all summer or to use a smaller facility where the caregiver might want to take vacation at some point.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve heard of Michele&#039;s Tiny Toes and bluebirds but I would appreciate anyone else&#039;s input. Thanks in advance!!

				Try Learning Odyssey.<br />&nbsp;<br />http://astoriadaycare.com/ (http://astoriadaycare.com/)<br />&nbsp;<br />If you&#039;re willing to bring them into Manhattan - I really like the Bright Horizons centers.&nbsp;

				Bluebird Daycare we were happy with. They have a web cam so you could check in, and Joan, the director is great to work with. If you have any questions or concerns, she&#039;s really attentive.

				Thanks guys! I tried Learning Odyssey but it&#039;s a bit out of our price range. Blue birds is one of the few places that looks like they take infant through toddler ages so it might be the way to go. There is a bit of an issue with parking on the residential street at drop-off and pick-up time but I think I&#039;m going to run into that issue anywhere in Astoria pretty much.<br />&nbsp;<br />I actually looked at Mushroom House too, it&#039;s up off Ditmars and 35th or so, they were perfect but only took kids age 2 and up.

There wasn&#039;t too much of a problem (like you said that&#039;s Astoria...). I believe that they are applying to become a Universal Pre-K provider as well.
