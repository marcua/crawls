				That&#039;s supposed to be permanent? Besides looking like a graveyard, it could turn a minor fender-bender into a major accident - or worse. Another colossal waste of time and money.

				Funny how the city complains that they &#039;&quot;have no money&quot; and more &quot;cuts are in order&quot; yet they fund this crap. Don&#039;t bother fixing roads, just waste it on this garbage. The real kicker will come when the first blizzard hits! Imagine how many plows are going to hit those concrete slabs and send them in to the middle of an intersection. Imagine how many people are going to slip on ice or snow and land on that artsy nonsense. The moron who came up with the bright idea of putting the concrete slabs in should be beaten with one over and over again. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Idiots.

				i noticed these tombstones a couple of months ago. creepy. yes, they are creepy, but i guess it is a suitable &quot;gateway&quot; to the borough of cemeteries. welcome to queens! eco-hipster-press-releases-disguised-as-comment-board-postings notwithstanding, these slabs of garbage-concrete look like tombstones. <br />the new queensboro plaza has puzzled me since soon after it was announced. the space badly needs a re-do, but who builds a park under an above-ground subway train? what what? i guess that for those with passive suicidal tendencies a park in this area might be appeal to dreams of cars hurtling down upon them from the new-and-improved queensboro bridge. <br />i like the new crosswalks, though. i ignored them at first because i&nbsp; assumed these carved-out expanses of roadway were reserved exclusively as bike lanes (for to accommodate the <em>millions upon millions</em> of bicyclists raiding this borough every hour [it will not surprise me if/when those crossings are eventually designated exclusively as bike lanes]) but for now the path from QPN to QPS is way less of an adventure for pedestrians than before. being able to move through that maelstrom of traffic without having to sprint is kinda cool, as is not having to hide from traffic behind those subway pillars. then again, neither of these QP endposts is much of a destination, is it... bah. <br />the graveyard is almost complete. the plaza has looked like a war zone for years and now that the place is starting to take shape our apathetic voting populace is looking at it and saying &quot;WHAT WHAT&quot;. i still can not believe that this city&#039;s voters let The King purchase an illegal third term. all hail the Emperor, and when you&#039;re tired of kissing up to the mayor, hail Sadik-Kahn. i&#039;d like to name a bike lane after each of them, preferably two of the bike lanes that will be removed by the next administration.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

				I&#039;m willing to withold judgement until the entire area is done.....including the tower on the corner.....It may all fit together. But I can see that one photo posted being strange.

				From what I heard, it&#039;s the City&#039;s idea of being &quot;green&quot;, supposedly all those tombstone like decorations are actually acquired from demolished buildings and they&#039;re recycling&nbsp; &nbsp; :lipsrsealed:

				Wow.&nbsp; Good luck to the garbage collectors trying to get all the debris out of the stones.&nbsp; What a pain in the ass.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ll try to withhold judgement, but honestly, it&#039;s going to take a lot before I even &quot;like&quot; Queens Plaza.&nbsp; It&#039;s ugly and loud and I have no idea why anyone would want to live next to all that noise and pollution.&nbsp; If I had money to get a condo, it sure wouldn&#039;t be in that area.<br />

				Let&#039;s not forget:&nbsp; it doesn&#039;t matter what they do to that area because the Riker&#039;s Island bus drops freshly released convicts right on the plaza.&nbsp; Hookers and drug dealers roam around for the next drop off knowing they&#039;ll get business.&nbsp; It&#039;s dangerous and no amount of landscaping or &quot;luxury&quot; condo development is going to change that.

				I agree that it&#039;s &quot;reuse&quot; taken to the extreme when it came to what to do with the broken up old sidewalks.&nbsp; While I hope it cause accidents or loss of life, it doesn&#039;t really bother me.&nbsp; I think I can grow to like it.&nbsp; And I agree that when this entire project is complete, it&#039;s going to an absolutely amazing tranformation of one of the ugliest parts of Queens.&nbsp; For decades it was nothing but a disgusting traffic jam.&nbsp; It is becoming a place that will be people, bike and car friendly.&nbsp; And I think it will be heavily used by people to sit and relax.&nbsp; More pedestrians and bikers will likely cross over the bridge to midtown now.&nbsp; I never would have believed that Queens Plaza would be transformed in this way.&nbsp; I think all the prisoner/drug dealer/prostitute issues are dramatically less than they were even 5 years ago.&nbsp; Hopefully it will keep some of the dark side and not become another Times Square.
