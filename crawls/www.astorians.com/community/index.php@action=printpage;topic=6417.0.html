				http://nycmtb.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1787&nbsp;<br />http://www.flickr.com/photos/37332189@N00/ :lol: 8-) :rock:<br /><br />Ribbon cutting was on Saturday; first official race was yesterday. <br /><br />Features a pump track*, series of multi-level dirt jumps (easier &amp; harder), plus some gnarly trails that snake down the steep cliffside forest&nbsp; :ugly:<br /><br />It was tremendously satisfying to have the NYC Parks Commissioner there, along with other city officials and volunteers who worked to make this happen. The president of our club, CLIMB, worked very closely with the newly-formed NYCMTB to develop the plans and lobby for permission in meeting after meeting after meeting......<br /><br />Now, the inner-city kids have a place to get exercise and blow off steam. There was a DJ and an ambulance on hand, some tents, a kids&#039; race, and some guided rides. I finally got to try out the pump track and was exhausted after a couple of laps. Great workout! <br /><br />Anyway, bring your BMX or mountain bike up that way sometime and give it a try. You can get there by bike by taking St. Nicholas Ave. to the Harlem River Greenway, onto Dyckman and a sharp left up the steep Fort George Hill. Make very sharp left (almost a U-turn) at the traffic light up top, keep going straight &#039;til you see the dirt jumps on the left. Also accessible by the 1 train. By car, it&#039;s the Harlem River Drive to Dyckman St.<br /><br />* a track made with berms and moguls where, if you get enough momentum going, you don&#039;t even need to pedal; you can do laps merely by pumping the handlebars rythmically.<br /><br />
