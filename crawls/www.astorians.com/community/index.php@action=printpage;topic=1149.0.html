				After 1.5 months in this shockingly pleasant neighbourhood called Astoria, here are my favourite eats, in no particular order:<br /><br />Papa Empanadas --rice and beans stuffed empanada, nice and hot out of the fryer, yummm...<br /><br />El Manara --best sujok ever. &nbsp;That's seasoned sausages in a pita, then heated in a hot press thing like a panini. &nbsp;SO GOOD.<br /><br />El Rawsharaja (sp??) --hummus sandwich is delicious and cheap and quick. &nbsp;Excellent babaganoush!<br /><br />Kebob Cafe --pumpkin dumplings, Hawashi (mushroom paste in pita), daily specials...<br /><br />Laziza Pastry Shop --the kanafe (sp), I like the cream one, not so much the cheesy one. &nbsp;Plus all the pastries, and great steamed milk in the coffee... they do coffee just right.<br /><br />Italian Bakery on 45th st. and 30th ave. --excellent pignoli, crossaints, cannoli, and for some reason I love getting toasted bagels with cream cheese and jelly from there. &nbsp;<br /><br />Brooklyn Bagels --lox sandwhich, generous cream cheese, big crusty muffins to pick on, yummy bagel chips<br /><br />China Fun --fast delivery, and a ton of veggies in their soups. &nbsp;And their generic veggie mix includes big savoury mushrooms! &nbsp;<br /><br />Jour et Nuit -tagine is delicious! &nbsp;Soooo good. &nbsp;<br /><br />Baskin Robbins --mocha blast and turtles blast and plain chocolate ice cream. &nbsp;<br /><br />Haagan Daaz --mint chocolate chip ice cream!<br /><br />The Columbian Place outside of the Steinway subway entrance by Broadway --delicious fresh juices with exotic fruits that I cannot remember, mixed with milk or water, I think.<br /><br />Rizzo's --I think I overate their sicilian slices in my first week here, and haven't really been back since. &nbsp;But I can't fault the pizza for my own recklessness. &nbsp;=)<br /><br />Um, that's it I guess. &nbsp;I love Astoria. &nbsp;The end.

				Those are some good choices.<br /><br />It doesn't sound like you've gotten north of Astoria Blvd. You seriously need to check out Ditmars. Some of those places will blow your mind.

				Check out El Boqueron (at 31st St &amp; 34th Ave I think)... <em>wonderful</em> Spanish tapas!

				Actually, the Balkh Shish-Kabob place on 31st Street and 23rd Ave. is pretty good. &nbsp;Afghani food.

				I live around 30th ave. and Steinway as well, and I can walk as far north as Astoria blvd. without the &quot;mental barrier&quot; forming. &nbsp;Any further north becomes a Trip --as opposed to the more casual Stroll.<br /><br />I've never been to the beer garden. &nbsp;Potentially naieve question: &nbsp;doesn't it get sort of chilly in the winter?<br /><br />A few days ago I accidentally wandered into Sunnyside. &nbsp;Sadly, I was aiming for LIC. &nbsp;Even more sadly, it began to pour half way through the Trip and I didn't have an umbrella.<br /><br />Also, to add on to remarkable food places:<br />-the fruit/veggie shop on 30th ave., 2nd closest to the 30th ave. subway stop; the one that's on the corner... that's my fav. &nbsp;good prices, good produce, good variety!<br /><br />As for places in the Ditmars area, I was told that Elia's Corner is no longer what it used to be, and should be avoided (Chowhound forum). &nbsp;I've been to the Peach Pit twice and it was super nice. &nbsp;Oops, I mean the Fuzzy Peach. &nbsp;(I've been telling my non-astorian friends that &quot;Astoria is just like 90210... all the cool kids go hang out at this place called the Fuzzy Peach... you know, just like the Peach Pit!!!)

				should we tell him it's not the &quot;fuzzy peach&quot; either??<br /><br />sass you must live right around the corner from us. &nbsp;Only someone in the near vicinity knows of the pignoli cookies at that bakery on 30th/45th. &nbsp;they are the best. &nbsp;<br /><br />You've got to join in our eating team (i mean dinner group) when we go out again - your taste is excellent

I can't believe how bad my memory is... Freeze Peach! &nbsp;I must've been thinking of fuzzy navel, the drink. &nbsp; :lol: <br /><br />Yep, I live real close to the Pignoli Place --woo, I'd love to be a part of your eating team! &nbsp;That's awesome. &nbsp;The only Astorian friend I've made so far is a short effeminate older man at the Terrizi Bakery on 30th ave., who might be really nice or kind of creepy --he was sort of a border case. &nbsp;And I'm too old to want to investigate the border cases. &nbsp;<br /><br />Also, I'm a girl. &nbsp;But I live with my boyfriend, who is a boy. &nbsp;He's a pretty good eater too, but sort of has a girlier appetite --think steamed veggies and tofu, turkey sandwiches, cranberry juice, trail mix and yogurt. &nbsp; :roll:
