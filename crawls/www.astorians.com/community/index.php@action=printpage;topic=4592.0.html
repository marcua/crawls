				Can anyone recommend a restaurant that can accommodate a group of about 10-14 people. I am looking for a place in the 28th Ave/30th Ave area in the 40&#39;s. Pretty flexible on type of cuisine. Just something good and not super expensive. Thanks!

				It&#39;s not in the 40&#39;s but Jour et Nuit on Steinway and 28th ave serves excellent Moroccan food and very reasonable if you do not order the wine by the bottle.&nbsp; Lots of room for a group.<br /><br />

				For a group that size I would suggest going to Zenon Taverna and ordering all of the meze&#39;s and then a couple of items off of the ala carte menu and that should do it for y&#39;all. We went with eight of us and ordered the three meze&#39;s (meat, fish, veg) and had more then enough left over. Just my thoughts. It is not in the forties, but close enough. <br /><br />Zenon Taverna Restaurant<br />3410 31st Ave btwn 34 &amp; 35 St.<br />Astoria, NY 11106<br />(718) 956-0133<br /><br />Where ever y&#39;all end up, enjoy! -Vin

				A new Moroccan restaurant called Walima just opened on 42nd Street and 31st Ave. I haven&#39;t tired it yet but looks like it would hold a group of your size.

				Would Moroccan food have any/many vegetarian options? I don&#39;t think I have ever had Moroccan food. A few of the people in the group are vegetarians.

				Thai Pavillion on 30th Ave and 37th street is good. Has vegetarian options.<br /><br />I tried Angelos recently. Ordered it to go. Had penne with eggplant, ricotta, red sauce, very tasty, but the pesto dish was very bland.<br /><br />Also, there is Stove on 28th Ave and 45th street. never been there, looks nice but the vegetarian options are very limited, call first and ask.

				Yes I was just rethinking the Stove option because I forgot&nbsp; you were with a large party. I remember it looking small. <br />Maybe they could put tables together, could be nice.
