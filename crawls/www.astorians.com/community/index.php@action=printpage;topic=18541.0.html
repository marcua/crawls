				Kempster,<br /><br />I am very sure there is--I&#039;ll ask Brent Galenberger (VP) and Michael Murphy (Events) who are the point folks for this fundraiser about those details, and post them as soon as they reply.&nbsp; Of course MJM may reply&nbsp; when he reads as well.

				Kick off Gay Pride weekend with Out Astoria by joining us on Friday, June 25 at 8pm at Astoria Brewhouse (2850 31st Street and 30th Ave) for our monthly mixer. We have reserved Astoria Brewhouse&#039;s private upstairs entertainment space for the event!<br /><br />The cover this time will be $10 and here&#039;s why:<br /><br />In honor of Pride 2010, Out Astoria is doing something a little different this mixer. As we celebrate all that is great about the gay experience, it’s important to also remember that, for many younger members of our community, the act of coming out often means rejection from their families. It is estimated that about 40% of homeless youth in New York City are LGBT. Many were thrown out of their homes by their parents when they came out as lesbian, gay, or transgender; they often live on the streets rather than face harassment and abuse in the homeless shelter system.<br /><br />The Ali Forney Center (AFC)—the nation’s largest and most comprehensive organization dedicated to homeless LGBT youth—operates an emergency shelter for homeless LGBT youth in the basement of an Episcopal church here in Astoria. Out Astoria will donate all proceeds from the door to the AFC shelter in Astoria. In addition, we will have a donation box at the door and encourage attendees to bring along items to donate to the shelter—donations such as non-perishable food items for the pantry (e.g., pasta, rice, canned goods) and personal items for the residents themselves (e.g., deodorant, shampoo, laundry detergent). <br /><br />Out Astoria has established an ongoing relationship with the shelter. If you wish to learn how to volunteer your time or to donate food, sundries, clothing, linens (sheets, pillows, etc.), house wares, books, DVDs, or other items, please send a message to vicepresident@outastoria.com with “AFC shelter” in the subject line.<br /><br />So come join us on June 25 as we celebrate Pride in honor of the Stonewall generation and help some members of the next LGBT generation as struggle to blossom into the fabulous gays and lesbians who carry our legacy into the future.
