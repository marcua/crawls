				I got a Zen Player for my birthday so I am trying to organize my music. For Example, I have a Forest Gump CD. I cut this CD to my comp. Then I listen to it and take the songs I like and put them in my Oldies folder with the name of who signs it first. I have my own system for organizing my music so I can find things. So what does my computer do a few minutes later? It moves my forest gump to a folder I do not have created already, it creates it called soundtracks and puts song name first artist second. IT&quot;S DRIVING ME NUTS! My computer keeps doing this to me. <br /><br />Again, I cut have a folder for various artist where I put all my music that I like that is older then 80's and not dance, techno, celtic, country, or whatever. In this folder is another folder titled Aerosmith. I take my cds and cut them and put the songs I like once again in there artist name first. A few minutes later my computer refreshes itself and my computer creates a folder with the cd name and moves them in there name of song first. Even if I try refreshing the computer myself it still does this. How can I make it stop.<br /><br />I want them where I put them not whre my comp puts them. HOW DO I FIX THIS, IT'S DRIVING ME BUGGY.

				The Zen player does have it's own software, but it is not the Zen that causes this. My computer was doing this to me long before that. I think it might be my windows media player that I use to rip my cds to my computer that does it. I will put the music on, and label them the way I like to and then my computer refreshes itself and labels them back and puts them in the folder it wants to. I think I have found a way around it though. I turned all my &nbsp;mp3 from active files to read only so now when i move them my comp asks me if i really want to move them and my comp just can't go moving them and renaming them.

				That sounds to me like a really strange problem. &nbsp;Windows in general does have a tendency to &quot;intuit&quot; what you the user wants to do and just goes ahead and does it anyway willy nilly.<br /><br />What version of Windows Media do you have? Have you tried an earlier version or other alternative players?<br /><br />I have no knowledge of Zen whatsoever, but along a parallel line ran into some similar problems with iTunes.<br /><br />Now that I think of it, I really believe that the Zen player is responsible for reorganizing your music into folders. &nbsp;There must be some setting menu that you can configure to stop it from doing this. &nbsp;For example, my iTunes asked me upon installation if I wanted it to find all appropriate media on my hard drive so that it could consolidate them into one folder. I chose no. Did you choose yes?<br /><br />I'm pretty sure that it's not your computer that is playing games with you, but rather one of the two programs that are handling your music or the files in question for you.<br /><br />----zeno

				Sorry about that,<br /><br />Didn't carefully read the prior post where you said that your computer was doing this little thing &quot;long before that&quot;, that is, before you installed Zen.<br />I am inclined to think that this problem has something to do with &quot;meta-data&quot; or whatever that is. When you right-click on a music file, select properties (I'm assuming you're using Windows), then select the &quot;Summary&quot; tab...what do you...<br />Jesus, I really don't know, I'm stumped.<br /><br />There are far more knowledgable people on the forum about this topic,<br />but I would appreciate it if you ever do find out what is doing this to please let us know. Curious.<br /><br />Yours truly,<br />Technologically handicapped.<br /><br />Uh, this may also have nothing to do with your computer or programs on the computer at all, but rather some sort of read only data or copy-protection material coming from the original CDs themselves. &nbsp;You say that the computer creates new folders, but it does not seem to do this in any consistent way, which would be in line with my view that it is the CDs that are to blame, the CDs having slight differences in format as they do different distributers or dates of distribution.<br /><br />Just a probably way incorrect thought,<br /><br />zeno :?

				Install another media player like iTunes and let it default all the settings. &nbsp;Go back and reinstall the Zen software and customize the settings to your liking at installation time.<br /><br />Better yet, wipe the Zen and get an iPod and use iTunes. &nbsp;I've seen it work for both Mac and PC. &nbsp;It's good to have a variety of friends.<br /><br />Ok, that second suggestion was reaching, but you never know. &nbsp;Your sanity might be saved if the former doesn't work.

				No way man. It's not my Zen because this did this long before I got my Zen. I love my Zen player it is better then an Ipod to me. <br /><br />1) I can change the battery myself without having to pay shipping and $100.00 for apple to change it.<br /><br />2) It doesn't convert all my music to mp4 which is a pain in the butt to convert it back to mp3 for my hubby's mp3 player and other things. He has a sondy disk one and loves it.<br /><br />2) And if my computer ever crashes, I don't have to buy a special program just to get my music back off of my Zen player. <br /><br />4) my 40 gig zen cost a little less then the 5 gig Ipod. <br /><br />I love my Zen, I have no problems with it, it works fine. All my friends who have Ipods, wish they had bought a Zen after they played with mine. And My couple of friends who did by the Zen are very happy they bought that instead of ipod.

I would argue (and I think i would have a pretty strong case - remember the battery debacle?) that Apple makes their ipods to break. <br /><br />I have a new player now (a cowon iaudio X5). &nbsp;It uses open music encoding formats, has an FM radio, lasts about 10-14 hours on the battery, displays pictures, plays AVI movies (overkill, but interesting), and costs about the same as an ipod. &nbsp;I can browse the filesystem with ease. &nbsp;Plus, IMHO, it sounds better than my old ipod did. &nbsp;Do I recommend it to everyone? &nbsp;No, because Itunes makes organizing music a snap - but I would argue that the iaudio X5's quility is a few notches above the ipod's. &nbsp;I miss Itunes a bit, but that's not a huge loss for me.<br /><br />I think the ipod wins in pure convenience, not quality. &nbsp;Hooking up an ipod to a mac with itunes is about as brainless as breathing. &nbsp;Which is great! &nbsp;I just wish that apple could concentrate on making the ipod a little more rugged, a bit more friendly to the power user, and less entrenched in proprietary audio formats. &nbsp;It seems that the newer ipods have better battery power, and they now support podcasting. &nbsp; Unfortunately, apple has already lost my faith and my dollar. &nbsp;I'll give them another look in a few years.<br /><br />-m

				@ cloudnine<br /><br />Welcome to the board. That was an excellent post (I learned a lot).<br />I also agree about the disadvantages of proprietary encodings, this reminds me too much of Sony.<br />But, do you have any idea why KilDaraSidhe's computer is doing what it's doing rearringing the file system and her music?

				Hi zeno, thanks for the welcome :)<br /><br />I think both you and Telesphoros have it figured out already. &nbsp;The way that the files are being rearranged - <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It moves my forest gump to a folder I do not have created already, it creates it called soundtracks and puts song name first artist second</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />- make me think that WMP (or some other nosy windows app) probably 'owns' these types of files. &nbsp;Clearly, something is reading the track information from these mp3 files' headers, rearranging the files by genre, and renaming the files. &nbsp;Does WMP normally organize files by genre?<br /><br />Perhaps KilDaraSidhe can right click on one of her mp3 files, and change what application is responsible for opening mp3 files by default.<br /><br />I'm not too saavy with windows, unfortunately. &nbsp;I can open outlook, firefox, and putty, and thats about it ... but there's my two cents, helpful or not. <br /><br />-m

				HELLO!!!!!! You are not reading my post entirely.<br /><br />I have told you this is a problem that I have had BEFORE I bought my Zen player, before I installed my Zen player, or before I even thought about buying a Zen player. My Zen player DID NOT CAUSE THIS!!!!<br /><br />Your right, I get what I paid for. I LOVE my Zen player. MY ZEN WORKS PERFECT and for the right price too!<br /><br />I have had my Zen for 2 months and it is one of the best things I have ever bought. My computer has been having this problem with renaming my music on me and moving them into folders for over a year now. It just became more irritating recently when I bought my Zen because I am trying to organize my music more now that I have my Zen to put my music on. <br /><br />I repeat Telesphoros, it is not my Zen that caused this problem, I think it is windows media player that I used to actually rip them because this problem has gone on for months before I even though of getting myself an mp3 player. <br /><br />The only thing that could improve on my Zen player is I wish more of the stores would carry more accessories for it. That's it. MY ZEN WORKS GREAT I have had no problems with it, just hours of enjoyment on my four hour commute every day.<br /><br />Also, I am not talking about the software that loads the music into my Zen, I am talking about the folders that are in mydocuments/mymusic. I have my mp3's organized into the folder generes that I want with artist name first then song title. How it acts in the Zen Software when loading isnt the issue.

				I am running windows, windows xp to be exact. For now, to aviod the problem of the computer trying to take my Forest Gump music for example out of my oldies folder and creating a Forest Gump Soundtrack folder and moving it there I have changed all my mp3 to read only files. This way my computer cannot rename them and move them where it likes. <br /><br />I also recently installed a re-tagger on my computer so I can re-tag all the mp3 info. I will be trying that and see if that will help. <br /><br />I never thought about changing the program they are associated with by default. I think I will try that as well and see if that helps.

				When I started ripping my music off my cd's way back when there was no itunes, or anything else, I put them into folders in my documents/mymusic/foldername/...... It is here that I will put say forest gump in mydocuments/mymusic/oldies/........ My comp then refreashes and creates mydocuments/mymusic/forestgumpsoundtrack/....... and puts the music in there. This is the generic my music folders that all windows creates in the my document folders. It has worked well for me in the past so I have always done this. My zen does not have a zen/mymusic directory (at least I dont think it does but I never really checked). The zen software will open up and asks me if I would like to add all the music it finds in mydocuments/mymusic or just some of it, or scan my computer for all music. The Zen works off my music folders as they are.

				If you're not willing to move away from Windows, you can atleast take control of your media player by avoiding WMP and using Zinf instead. It plays mp3, ogg, and can even handle shoutcast streams. Best of all, zinf is Free Software.<br /><br />www.zinf.org
