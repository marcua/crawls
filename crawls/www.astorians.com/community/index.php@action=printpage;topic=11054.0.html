				KEELHAUL OR WHIP &#039;EM ALL?<br />Brooklyn Battles the Queens of Pain 6/28 at Hunter College Sportsplex<br /><br />Manhattan, NY (June 17, 2008) -The Brooklyn Bombshells -- the saucy sailorettes of Gotham Girls Roller Derby -- have their sights set on their cross-canal rivals in black, the Queens of Pain. Brooklyn and Queens do battle on skates on June 28th at the Hunter College Sportplex at Lexington Avenue and 68th Street, Manhattan.<br />After their loss to the Bronx Gridlock on June 7th (126-53), Brooklyn will re-load their cannons to prepare for battle against the &#039;05 and &#039;06 league champions. Queens took down the Manhattan Mayhem in their opening May bout (152-71) and look to lock down league dominance with a 2-0 record.<br /><br />Pivot and co-captain Hela Skelter, otherwise known as &quot;Brooklyn&#039;s wrecking ball,&quot; has already won &#039;team MVP&#039; honors in both of her two bouts this young season. She and her teammates will be gunning after the Queens offensive superstars: Cheap Skate (2007 co-winner of the Best Jammer award), Suzy Hotrod (the GGRD&#039;s all-time scoring leader), and breakout jamming force Scarlett Rage.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Donna Matrix of Queens (GGRD Best Blocker 2006) will be cracking her whip against veteran Brooklyn blockers Hard Anya, Raggedy Animal, league founder Chassis Crass, and energetic fan favorite Lil&#039; Red Terror. This bout will also feature an emotional return by Queens blocker Greta Turbo, who&#039;s spent over eight months recovering from a spiral fracture of her shin and is ready to put the hard rehab work to the test.<br /><br />Get there early to win prizes in pre-bout rounds of Gotham Girls Bingo, and enjoy a demonstration of bicycle polo at halftime.
