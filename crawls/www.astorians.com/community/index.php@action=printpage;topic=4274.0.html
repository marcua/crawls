				Thanks, enigmacat!!!<br /><br />Flooz, thanks for the endorsement!!!<br /><br />Ganache is a heavenly mixture of chocolate and cream.&nbsp; Depending on the ratio of chocolate to cream, it can be super thick and fudgy, or shiny and glaze-like.&nbsp; Magical.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)

				I was thinking about that, NYCMacUser, but startup funds are limited, and I&#39;m really really good at truffles.&nbsp; Cakes and pies need more practice.&nbsp; Plus, to keep it simple, it&#39;s a million times easier to sell just one thing.&nbsp; Once I master certain cakes and pies, I&#39;ll branch out.&nbsp;

				Vegan chocolate is a great idea.&nbsp; Would have to find an alternative for the requisite cream in the ganache.&nbsp; The fat content of the cream is critical to getting the proper texture.&nbsp; I wonder how soymilk or almond milk would work. Hmmm . . . I detect a challenge!!

				JD, I&#39;ve often wondered if Silk creamer would work.&nbsp; It&#39;s a bit thicker than soy milk.&nbsp; Another option might be coconut cream.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#39;d be happy to help you try it!

				Just want to thank all of you who have ordered my truffles.&nbsp; You&#39;ve helped me out tremendously!!!<br /><br />Jennifer, if you&#39;re serious about the elf thing, we can talk ... That sounds like an excellent challenge.<br /><br />Interesting side note: I took an order to my friend at school (a bag of six), and it was laying on the table. The chef came over and picked it up and asked her, &quot;Where&#39;d you get this?&nbsp; Sweet Bliss?&nbsp; Some specialty place?&quot;&nbsp; And she said, &quot;Nope.&nbsp; Michelle made them.&quot; And Chef said, &quot;Michelle made them?!?!&nbsp; Wow!!!&quot;&nbsp; So there ya go, folks.&nbsp; Truffles rule.&nbsp; :-)

				Again, I would like to warmly and sincerely thank all of you who ordered my truffles and made this rather crazy venture a total success! I hope they were as enjoyed in the eating as they were in the manufacturing.&nbsp; Thanks to the enthusiasm and support I received from my fellow astorians, I feel confident enough to keep the candy-making happening, and even to add some more items to my repertoire.&nbsp; Please stay tuned for my Valentine&#39;s Menu.&nbsp; <br /><br />Best wishes for the holidays!&nbsp; Thank you.
