				So tonight my boyfriend and I ended up ordering dinner from CUP. Since we tend to keep strange hours, working late at times, CUP was always a good spot to order from since they delivered later and had a somewhat unique menu from the usual places around us. Basically, CUP was the spot to order from when you just wanted to pig out on really <em>bad for you</em> food and watch some movies for the night.<br /><br />We haven't ordered from CUP for a few weeks now, so tonight when I called in our order I was informed that their menu had changed and some of the items we might want could have been taken off. Some items? Everything we liked was gone. No crab cake wrap, no chicken salad sandwiches with apples and raisins, no mac &amp; cheese. We finally found something they <em>did</em> still offer (Havana corn on the cob &amp; turkey burgers), and they sent over a new menu with the delivery.<br /><br />Now, I am going to assume that the same people that own CUP also own Lite Bites (on Steinway &amp; B'Way) because the menu, except for maybe 2 or 3 items, is <em>completely identical</em>. &nbsp;I understand that restaurants will change their menus to better serve their customers..get rid of dishes not selling, update a bit, etc. But why, why, why, would a somewhat successful establishment just copy and serve the exact same thing that a smaller cafe (known more for take out and only 2 avenues away) has been serving for a few years now? And the kicker? &nbsp;Lite Bites' prices are lower than CUP, anywhere from $.25 to a whole dollar lower!<br /><br />Ugh, it's so annoying. I just want more selection for take out around this area and now having yet another glorified sandwich shop /cafe here is just depressing. I just had to vent....<br /><br /><br />Oh and even though I've only just gotten around to registering here, I've been lurking quite awhile now. I've learned more about Astoria in the past few months than I have in the 6 years I've been living here! Thanks everyone!

				... that CUP is going out of business.<br />&nbsp;I've never heard about a connection between CUP and lite bites. &nbsp;I know there's a connection between CUP and Cavo and I think some sports bar on 31st ave at Newtown (I don t know the name). &nbsp;<br />I don't know if it's the case but I suspect the similar menus might be due to the fact that they probably order lots of perpared foods from SYSCO the HUGE food supplier that supplies most all food joints around and in the tri state area (as far as I can tell). &nbsp;So they just sell what it is that SYSCO is providing. Same stuff that all the other places sell that SYSCO is providing. &nbsp; &nbsp;This is only a theory... but what the heck it sounds good to me. &nbsp;<br /><br />I think CUP opened in that area (as did Starbucks) based on hope (and possible knowledge) of FUTURE development. &nbsp;I think Starbucks has the money to wait it out until the development arrives. &nbsp;I think CUP doesn't have the resources it'll take to wait it out. &nbsp;On the other hand - August is notorieously the WORST month for restaurants if they've made it through this month.... on the other hand - August bills won't come due till Sept.

				I don't know what is going on with CUP, but if you are looking for a good late night dining spot (I think they deliver too), the Sanford Diner on Broadway is great. The menu is a step above average diner food (with a great wine list) and it is open 24 hours. they also claim to have WiFi access, but I have yet to try that out.

				Sanford's is one of three excellent all-night diners on Broadway, the other two being the Bel Aire and Michael's. &nbsp; I like Michael's best. &nbsp;Sanford's menu emphasizes foodie food, while Michael's concentrates on homestyle favorites. &nbsp;The music at Sanford's can be intrusively loud; OTOH I love their tomato soup and lentil soup. &nbsp;I haven't eaten at Bel Aire often enough to talk knowledgeably about their offerings--to far away from where I live.<br /><br />Cup is a trendy, overpriced pseudo-diner, down to the fashionably monosyllabic name; the three on Broadway are the real thing. &nbsp;Still, for the time being, it's nice to have something near the AMMI besides the museum cafe.

			<dd class="postbody">
				I've been to Cup a handful of times, and each experience was underwhelming, at best.<br /><br />But caveat emptor: if you pay by credit/debit card, check your statment later!!!<br /><br />Not once, but twice when I used by debit card to pay for a meal and left the tip IN CASH, someone took it upon themselves to add an exceedingly generous <strong>25% tip on top of my bill</strong>. WTF?! :x :x<br /><br />Thankfully, I alerted my bank and they straightened it out. But the bank rep explained that restaurants 'sometime do this', meaning add the tip automatically. I never heard of such a practice, and I'd worked in restaurant management before.<br /><br />And it wasn't as if I left the 'Tip' line blank and open for interpretation. On both occasions I drew a line across it. To make matters worse, the service was so-so the first time, and completely sub-par the second (and last) time I was there.<br /><br />It's not like I'm a difficult patron or a bad tipper, either. After all, I've been on the other end. But this was too much. And for what? Overpriced, over-greasy food and smarmy, semi-competent waitstaff.<br /><br />I'd rather go to DiNapoli down the block. Service is lousy there, but at least you know what you're paying for and the food's not half-bad.

				I find that some of Cup's items aren't well thought out, also. Their breakfast sandwiches are gross. But eggs and potatoes and coffee, are fine. On weekends that place is packed so I don't know that they'll really go under tho people complain about it incessantly. So maybe. <br /><br />I tend to like the actual place and its wi-fi a lot more than anything I've eaten there or anyone who's worked there. The staff can be downright mean and if they think that has some dinerish-retro-charm they're wrong. <br /><br />The owners of Cup are somehow related to Cavo as well as my beloved Brick Cafe. Makes me sad. Anyway, Lite Bites is actually a small chain, so I don't think they're they same.

				I never thought about Sysco, and you might be right about that. <br /><br />Whatever the case, if there's no relation to Lite Bites, it's still a bit disappointing to see they copied the menu layout and exact item names from another place. <br /><br />I wish someone would either buy them out or another place would open there. It's such a nice spot, I'd hate to see it go unused (if the closing rumors are true) for a long period of time.

				does anyone have information of substance to support this rumor that cup is closing?<br /><br />i don't frequent the place any more because it doesn't fit my schedule -- they quit staying open 24/7 back in december. now i either pack a lunch and head to an after hours pub or get the Reuben Deluxe at Michael's. or i stay home and litter neighborhood message boards with nonsense such as this.<br /><br />i don't know if it's closing (i doubt it) but if you must start trolling around rumors that ~50 people start looking for new jobs then at least offer some substance beyond an introductory ellipsis. <br /><br />i think CUP will endure as do other all-caps places like CAOS, DNA, and CLIC -- which seem similarly incongruous to the neighborhood but do pretty well with the underage tourists and Queensboro strip club crowd.<br /><br />i'm thinking CLiC isn't all caps -- i think there's a blinking dot over the I. i.

				Somebody must think Cup has dinerish retro charm, combined with hi-tech hipness, especially if they come from a place where the only budget restaurant is McDonald's. &nbsp;But as I wrote above, you can go up to Broadway and have the real thing. &nbsp;(There's also the Astoria Diner on Steinway St. but I haven't checked that out yet.) &nbsp;Cup is to a real diner what the score of Grease is to the real rock-and-roll of the 50s (Presley, Holly, Berry, etc.).<br /><br />Cup probably gets the brunch crowd from those who live south of Bway, not just the AMMI crowd. &nbsp;That it is packed on weekends shows that the location is good. &nbsp;Michael's is packed during weekend brunch hours.

				I heard it too that cup may be closing. &nbsp;but ive been a few times recently (my brother loves and drives in from forest hills) It has been ok and better than a year ago. &nbsp;it also seems more crowded than before. &nbsp;Who knows whats going on. &nbsp;The food is eh to just ok. &nbsp;the big cup of orange margarita was very good.<br /><br />Starbucks is a good sign of prosperity for the area or else they wouldnt have opened. &nbsp;And kaufman astoria stages may be taken over by a big hollywood studio. That could mean a lot to the neighborhood as well. &nbsp;<br /><br />if you look above cup you will see that the space upstairs and to the left is for lease. originally cup was planning on a catering hall above and an asian fusion restaurant to the left. obviosly things have changed and for the worse i imagine.<br /><br />So it looks like a waiting game and hrs of good writing on this message board.

				i don't know why i didn't think of this when i posted before, but cup was sold recently, probably corresponding with the change in menu and prices. so the cavo/brick owners are, i assume, not involved any more. i don't know who the new owners are because i don't care any more, but &nbsp;the catering space is still there one of the managers told me the new owners don't do that stuff. and there's an art gallery (or something like it) in the building. the surprising thing about cup was that in my opinion they had the best pint of guinness around, assuming you like it very cold. surprising because it doesn't look like a good beer place. i don't do diners as much these days but i did happen to hit Michael's last night for a 3am reuben and as far as diner food goes i think it's as good as it gets around here. i also recommend their gyro deluxe. <br />the astoria diner on steinway used to be the Modern Age, and either before or after that I think it was called Millennium or something Y2k-esque. the tables were wobbly when i was there, and the interior looks strangely like a cross between Jimbo's on Astoria Blvd. and a Morrison's Cafeteria somewhere down south.

				i'd think that cup's size is working against it, as well. it hasn't been even 50% full there when i've gone in since it first opened, and i'd imagine that the rent on it is really high. (not to mention the utilities.) i went there a few times last fall late (i work nights) and i was the only soul in the place from 4 until 6:30 a.m.<br /><br />i really wanted cup to be good. but every time i have gone there, no matter what i've ordered, i've been disappointed. it's a shame that the more interesting items on the menu seem to be gone, but maybe that will cause the kitchen to focus more?<br /><br />(side note: i'd think that the starbucks' location is more of a function of kaufman being right there -- the one on steinway has fielded a lot of large orders from kaufman-based productions)

				I've never had any issues with them, but then again, I've only been there very early on weekday mornings. In fact, I was there yesterday at 7 am and had the nicest waitress ever - she kept the coffee coming but otherwise left me to work on my laptop.<br /><br />And she didn't complain when I paid for one cup of coffee with my debit card. (She didn't add a 25% tip on there either.) :wink: <br /><br />I'm sure that CUP, like everywhere else, has its moments.

				I have a love/hate relationship with cup. If their mac and cheese is really gone, I probably won't go back, since I love that dish. And I like it for late fall/early spring date night because I like the walk back and the cavernous space is comforting after so many tiny New York restaurants.<br /><br />I would never compare it with authentic diner food, though. If I want that I'll go to Michael, or Tastee Corner (man, I love that place, and the renovation, but why the hell don't they call it Blue Sea Cafe again? So much more dignified).<br /><br />However, here's something funny to do at Cup if you hate them - order the &quot;bottomless tea&quot;. Both times I've done it, the waitress has thrown a snitfit saying I can't have bottomless tea, but it's THERE ON THE MENU, the morons, so I keep ordering it. If they've changed the menu, they might have wised up on that, but if they haven't, TRY it. <br /><br />It's not that I like harassing waitstaff, but if an establishment isn't paying enough attention to realize that bottomless tea is different than coffee, they deserve me taking advantage of it.<br /><br />Hee.

				I work across the street from CUP, at the museum, and sometimes I just want a cup of soup for lunch, so I'll run over there. &nbsp;No joke, more than half the time when I walk in, I'm completely ignored by the entire staff. &nbsp;I'll be standing by the hostess station, or even go directly to the bar/register area and no one will acknowledge my existence until I say &quot;excuse me&quot; really loudly. &nbsp;People will just pass me by as I stand there and wait. &nbsp;Usually I just end up leaving without ordering.
