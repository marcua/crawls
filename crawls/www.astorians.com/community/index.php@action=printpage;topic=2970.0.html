				I&#39;m starting to think that there are more pets than people in Astoria. Almost everyone I know has at least one; most of my friends have 2 or more. I recently met someone who would love to have a pet, but their landlord has the right to refuse them. <br /><br />I can&#39;t help but feel so sorry for those people, whose lives would benefit from having such unconditional love, but being deprived of it by a relative stranger. It is sad. <br /><br />I&#39;ve got 2 dogs. They are the loves of my life. <br /><br />What kinds of pets do you folks have? Are you afraid of being evicted because of them?

				Two cats, and indeed, there&#39;s no way I&#39;d give them up. <br /><br />(http://i54.photobucket.com/albums/g115/lpelosi/siddha.jpg)&nbsp; (http://i54.photobucket.com/albums/g115/lpelosi/taylor.jpg)<br />Siddha&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Taylor<br /><br />It&#39;s awful, really. I had a terrible time finding a place that was nice that accepted pets. I was lucky that I had the luxury of time so I could wait until I found one. And I certainly feel for those people who have no choice to give up their pets in order to live. I made sure that it was in the lease that cats were allowed. I couldn&#39;t live having to hide my pets and worry about whether I might be found out.<br /><br />There have been so many studies that show how having and caring for a pet is beneficial to a person&#39;s physical and emotional well-being, whether the person is young or old. And while I guess I can understand the concern about noise or damage done to property, I have to say, that&#39;s not the animal&#39;s fault, it&#39;s the owner who doesn&#39;t take care of the animal <em>or</em> their home. <br /><br />And frankly, I saw more than my fair share of &quot;no pet&quot; apartments that were absolute holes in the ground ... I found it ironic that these places allowed filthy slobs but not two little cats and a responsible, clean tenant ... :?<br /><br />

				i have ozzy.<br />my red eared pond slider i bought from a bowl by the mall. Actually it was Lewis and Oswald. Sadly, Lewis didn&#39;t make it. Ozzy however is about to turn 5. I get major kudos at the pet store for that...street turtles don&#39;t usually survive b/c the people who buy them when they are all cute and super green don&#39;t bother to find out how to take care of them (ie, get them out of that little plastic carry container and into a tank with water and proper lighting). i don&#39;t have another pic at work to upload, but he&#39;s my avatar. also known as my scaly little man<br />&nbsp;:-D

				turtles are soooo cute.<br />unfortunately he&#39;s at John&#39;s house. when i couldn&#39;t live in my apartment last year b/c of the bad bugs (*shudders at the memory*) we moved him over so he would have constant attention. i get to see him a few times a week. john has assumed step daddy responsibilities quite well (oz has gotten new lighting, a new filter and a new island set up...basically the only thing left that i bought is him, the tank and the heater!)<br />I miss having him on my dresser in my room and &quot;playing&quot; with him.

Luckily I was able to talk my very sweet landlords into letting me have him here (or else I was finding another apartment)!<br /><br />Oh, and rdc, if you&#39;re at all interested in a bengal, a friend of mine knows some folks who were moving out of their offices and had to give up their office cats because their new office building wouldn&#39;t allow it. One of them has been placed, but last I heard the bengal had not been. She&#39;s 12 and apparently a total sweetheart. I adore bengals and would snatch her up in a minute but CJ doesn&#39;t do well with other cats...&nbsp; :-(

				Ayyyyyy! Reading all your posts and seeing your photos has made me long so for kitties of my own. I love them! I am definitely a cat person, grew up with them, and adore them.<br /><br />My lease does stipulate no pets, but that&#39;s not really my excuse since I&#39;ve seen a neighbor taking her dog out for walks and I know it&#39;s not at all enforced. <br /><br />What I&#39;m really a bit afraid of is the commitment - not sure what I&#39;d do when I leave to travel - I don&#39;t really have anyone who could help take care of them conveniently.&nbsp; (And then there&#39;s also the possibility of moving abroad within the next couple years.) How do you all manage when you have to leave for more than a few days?&nbsp; <br /><br />But all these comments and pics are making me re-think. How I would love to have a kitty with me in my apartment!

				I had dogs growing up my whole life, but in NYC cats are much easier to handle (no worries about walking them or how big/ small your apt is for them).<br /><br />These are my two. They look like they&#39;re in lurv but the pic is right before an all out brawl over the best windowsill.&nbsp; <br /><br />Whiskey (male, left w/ the giant tail) and Kitty (female, aka Olive) on the right.&nbsp; Both were rescued from the streets, Kitty 2 years ago and Whiskey just over 1 year ago.&nbsp; They have such polar personalities, but can often be found chilling out watching the action on the street from the windows.&nbsp; Whiskey is a lap cat and will also fetch balls and return them to you.&nbsp; He&#39;s crazy-- also likes to knock over glasses full of liquid if he can&#39;t reach what&#39;s inside.&nbsp; He also likes coffee.&nbsp; Kitty comes by for her head/ neck scratch once a day, but keeps to herself.&nbsp; She likes vegetables, pork and olives.&nbsp; We also take Kitty out on a harness leash every once in a while, but she just sits in the garden and eats things.<br /><br />[attachment deleted by admin]

				if you have a pet for more than 3 months in your residence the landlord can&#39;t force you or the pet out. he/she can try but you can get away with it. especially if you have cool neighbors who are willing to know and keep there mouth shut. something about plain sight. <br />this doesn&#39;t work in private family homes or buildings with less than 6 units.

				Cat owners, please explain to me what you do with your loved ones when you go away on vacation? I&#39;m considering getting one cat, eventhough I know two would be better since they can keep each other company, but how do you leave them if you like to travel for 2 weeks at a time and can&#39;t take them with you....Are there enough catsitters out there? Doesn&#39;t the cat get lonely?&nbsp; :| Would it be wrong to leave them alone for so long? And what about the training, does it really work and they won&#39;t scratch your wood, fabrics, etc...? I would love to have a kitty, but I&#39;m not inclined to cover everything up in the apartment for the love of the cat.

				i love my babies so much it hurts to leave them for lomger then overnight! i cry sometimes from stressing myself out over it. Can&#39;t help you with the 2 weeks out cause i&#39;ve never in my life been able to get that much consecutive time, but the longest i&#39;ve left them was 6 days. I&#39;ve been lucky enough to have great cat loving friends who stop by ever day or every other day and play for an hour or so. i&#39;ve left them for a long weekend (3-4 days) once or twice without anyone and they were ok. they had some shock at our reunion and all, maybe a half hour to start purring again, but nothing bad. i think its actually good to leave them a little bit- they get used to it. but it is very very had to leave them, i keep hearing their cries echo in my head when im on the plane!

Once the 90 day period is over, then you&#39;re good. Usually landlords don&#39;t care about cats -- they&#39;re quiet and tend not to annoy people (unless it&#39;s my cat who annoys everyone); and I can&#39;t imagine anyone getting evicted over a 10 gallon aquarium (unless there&#39;s some sort of vicious, noisy beast living in it). With dogs it&#39;s easier to satisfy the open and notorious requirement -- they get walked and leave the building. With cats it&#39;s a bit more difficult since the only time someone would really know is if they enter the apartment.

				Boy-oh-boy I&#39;m starting to think you cat people have it so much easier than us dog folks. When I go out, even if its just to go to the mailbox, one of my spoiled brats whines like I have sentenced him to a life without hugs! If I need to go away—like an out of town wedding or a hospital stay—I need to bring people in to stay at my place for the duration. There seems to be so much more that needs to be done for dogs than for cats. I don&#39;t even ask my pet sitters to brush their teeth in my absence. But my guys would keep the neighbors up all night if they were ever left alone overnight—even though they have each other for company—they depend on me for everything. Please understand I am *not* complaining. These little guys are my life. I guess I&#39;ve spoiled them the same way I did my children . . . and I don&#39;t regret one single moment of doing that! The rewards are the best thing in life.

				I live in an apartment complex with about 20 apartments.&nbsp; The landlord is old fashioned and pretty strict.<br /><br />&quot;Packs&quot; was a poor choice of words on my part.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t mean a group of dogs under the supervision of one person; I just meant that I saw a lot of dogs when I went for a walk.<br /><br />Someone I know suggested the whole less income in Astoria than in the Upper West Side, and while I know that&#039;s true, I would think that the number of house owners in Astoria would override this theory.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Upper West Side is predominantly apartment buildings run by management companies that set their own rules.&nbsp; From what I&#039;ve seen, Astoria has a lot houses that are inhabited by the owner, meaning they don&#039;t have to abide by other people&#039;s rules.&nbsp; That&#039;s why, when I moved here, I figured there would be a ton of dogs; but surprisingly I have seen very few.<br /><br />I think that as more and more yuppies, such as myself, move into the area, there will be more pet friendly apartment buildings.&nbsp; <br /><br />Until then, I&#039;m totally going to hold a one man protest in my building and stick it to the man.
