			I want to take some time to answer this because Billz1981 and I touched on this in another thread and I want to explain myself in a better way here because I think it is important. <br /><br />I am very upset regarding the irrational attacks, verbal and otherwise, that I see occurring across the nation. And it&#039;s not just the signs of Obama with a Hitler mustache or the ones calling for an armed insurrection that would, I can only imagine, require an attack on Washington DC that will result in the destruction of the government. <br /><br />Yeah, some can consider that bombastic silliness that will never evolve into an actual revolution. And I can understand the feeling there. <br /><br />What upsets me is the reaction of GOP leaders that egg on the teabaggers. One example that jumps out is Sen Grassley talking about how Grandma isn&#039;t ready to die. How in all that is holy can a leading Senator make that statement? This is acceptable conduct? We have seen situations where GOP politicians are forced to apologize to Rush.....WTF? And we also had a GOP leader state that he understood the guy who flew a plane into a building that had IRS employees. Again....WTF. that action by that guy was an act of terrorism. How is it possible to excuse that action? I&#039;m sorry but I don&#039;t effing get it. How is this acceptable.<br /><br />What it seems to me is this. GOP politicians are fanning the flames to suit there own goals such as winning elections. But also, it seems to me that the GOP leadership is afraid to stand up to this insanity and say ENOUGH! <br /><br />But it is more than that. <br /><br />Last night, I watched the news with the examples of death threats, rocks thrown threw windows. And I cried. This is really scaring me. <br /><br />And it really hurts. I support health care reform because I want my fellow citizens to be safe from fear of being denied care. I don&#039;t want to see a single person die because an HMO decided that the operation was to expensive. I&#039;m not trying to destroy the Constitution. And neither is Obama or Pelosi or Reid. <br /><br />Let me end this way and ask this question. What if we don&#039;t survive this? What if someone finally takes the next logical step. What if someone assassinates a politician. I&#039;m sorry, but based on what I am seeing, I can&#039;t help but think that is what is next. How can I not?<br /><br />I&#039;m not writing this as an angry man. I&#039;m writing this as a fearful man. Fearful of the path we seem to be going down at this moment. <br /><br />

			Kemper, I have a modest suggestion. Leave the echo chamber. On a different thread you stated that you couldn&#039;t watch something because it was on Fox News. OK that&#039;s great. I trust very little that I see on talk shows. But by listening to the irrational rantings of Olberman or Maddow, or even worse, the Ed show you are just getting the other side of the marketing coin.<br />There are irrational people on both sides of the political aisle. Both sides threaten violence if they don&#039;t get their way. But, when you reflectively use the term &quot;teabagger&quot; you are contributing to the problem. You are mocking a legitimate concern (the government has too much say in free citizen&#039;s live) by throwing in a psuedo-sexual image to mock them. <br />So how about we address the issue. How much control should the federal government exert over free citizens? If I say that &quot;a government has no authority to mandate that I purchase a product from a third party&quot;, can you refrain from suggesting that I suck balls?<br />

I am not mocking anybody. I meant my post as an honest way of how I see things. Nothing more.....nothing less.
