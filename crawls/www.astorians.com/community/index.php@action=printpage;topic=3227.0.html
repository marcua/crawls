				Mets magic number is now 16....they also have the best record in baseball (82-49, .626) barely edging Detroit (83-50, .624)<br /><br />It&#39;s highly possible they can clinch a berth on 9/11, somewhat appropo considering they did a huge of amount of community service right after the attacks (they also wore those FDNY/PD/PA hats and made an almost miraculous run to the playoffs in Sept. 2001).&nbsp; Speaking of that year, I have to thank the Yanks (which is hard for me to do being a &quot;Yankee hater&quot;) for providing an exciting World Series that year even though they lost.&nbsp; I know it&#39;s only baseball, but I think that series helped the city recover psychologically, or at least provided an escape.<br /><br />man, that seems so long ago....<br /><br />-Rob

				I think the rotation might get better pretty soon.&nbsp; Glavin is back any day now.&nbsp; And this is typical Pedro.&nbsp; He always seems to have &quot;health problems&quot; this time of year.&nbsp; I just see this as a chance for him to get some rest and be in top form for the playoffs.&nbsp; I tend to think the mets really are that much better than the rest of the NL.&nbsp; And with Beltran, Delgado, Wright, etc... getting hot with the bats, the offense is quite potent right now. :-)

				I don&#39;t really follow baseball closely, but I&#39;ve always had an affection for the Mets; they are such cute lil&#39; underdogs. I moved to Queens just in time to jump on the Mets bandwagon&nbsp; :-D Here&#39;s hoping they get to the World Series.<br /><br />Although, now that I&#39;m moving to Chicago, watch we&#39;ll wind up with another Subway Series and I&#39;ll miss New York even more!

				Sunday 9/24 at 2 is the next Astoria Eats thing (I know this because I sadly can&#39;t make it and just responded a little while ago), so maybe Saturday would be better?<br /><br />Oh, and if we get a certain number of people, we should book as a group (I think most places consider anything more than 12 people a group, I used to work in the minors, and that was our threshold), and we can have our name on the videoboard :)

				I was thinking Saturday too since it&#39;s a night game. I love the stadium at night. Anyway, a group is 25 or more. Not sure if we can round up that many Astorians. The only other thing I am worried about is payment. I don&#39;t mind buying the tickets, but I would rather have everyone&#39;s money up front before I buy a ton of tickets. I have paypal, but have only used it for payment and not for being paid. I will look into it today. Glad you are interested in going!
