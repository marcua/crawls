				Merm, Mods, Etc...&nbsp; At our home on both computers we have been having problems with Astorians.&nbsp; For about 4 days now as you go through the site it often loads chopped up. Sometimes it loads in the top third of an Astorians page over the last page I had up like my gmail page or a news page.&nbsp; Sometimes it overlaps itself when looking at peoples postings and you cant tell who wrote what.&nbsp; Etc etc etc...<br /><br />Is it us or is this part of a larger problem?&nbsp; HELP!<br />

				Since the new redirect ads have been in place, I&#039;ve had issues that sound like what you are describing, but they are only momentary. It only happens when I get redirected to the new ad pages. It hangs like that for a second or two, gets choppy and then proceeds normally. <br />I am running Firefox on Windows XP Pro if that helps.

				Are you sure it isn&#039;t your computers? I ask this only because after I saw this post I loaded the site on my PC using Firefox and I.E. and everything was fine- also while not being logged into my account here. I then tried it on&nbsp; both my macs using Firefox, I.E. and Safari and everything seems to be working fine. Perhaps something is preventing it from loading, like some temp files? That&#039;s all I can add at the moment.

				I&#039;m on a Mac and I tried to replicate the problem with a few browsers (Firefox, Safari, Navigator, Flock, OmniWeb, Camino and Shiira) without signing on. Not once did I have any problem either loading the site or any particular thread. <br /><br />For those on Macs, I would suggest the following: <br />1) Empty browser cache<br />2) Restart on Mac OS X disc (hold down the letter &quot;C&quot; while it is restarting.<br />3) Run Disk Utility—both repair disk and repair permissions<br />4) Restart and see if it still happens<br /><br />Good luck.

				with all due respect, i think running disk utility is a little overkill. the choppiness exists right where the google ads are placed in the middle of the topic (see attachment for screen grab). it&#039;s worse when i select a &#039;new&#039; link and am scrolled to an named anchor (sorry for the web jargon). this display issue has been going on for a couple of weeks and i have a sinking suspicion that it&#039;s related to the javascript that places the ads.<br /><br />[attachment deleted by admin]

				Okay. I am going to say it if no-one else will. The requested annual donation to this forum is $12.00 a year. That&#039;s what? Three Starbucks coffees. Or three special teas? It&#039;s probably one night of ordering out instead of cooking at home. Two drinks at the local pub? For all the information obtained on this site about our neighborhood, for all the friendships already and yet to be made, for being part of something that no other neighborhood in NYC has . . . isn&#039;t it worth $12 to avoid the advertising that helps support the server that keeps this place here anytime you want it?

				The server has been having some issues as well lately (disappearing posts). Once we are sure we have those issues resolved I&#039;ll try to figure out why some of you are having loading problems. I&#039;m not sure why it&#039;s slow for some and not for others. I myself see the ads and I&#039;m not finding that the page loads stall on the ads.
