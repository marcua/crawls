				Interesting hypothesis and I&#39;m sure that lack of expendable income does make it more difficult to do right by your body for several reasons...too much work to go to the gym...cheaper to buy inexpensive crappy foods than to take more time (that you might need to spend working) to prepare a healthy meal, ...money and time to go to the gym...Oprah has someone stopping her from putting food in her mouth round the clock, personal trainers, cooks, etc.<br /><br />But... and I don&#39;t have statistics on this, are people broker today than they were 200 years ago? I think more our lifestyle, technological advances, and transportation efficiency are contributing factors. We don&#39;t need to be as active as we were years ago. There aren&#39;t as many natural opportunities for exerise and activity as there were even in the seventies....not sure that monetary is the only reason here...

				I think this article is mostly right. But what it fails to point out is that the reason that junk food in America is so cheap is because our tax dollars subsidize junk foods heavily. How? CORN (http://www.ecoliteracy.org/publications/rsl/michael-pollan.html).

				It&#39;s definitely cheaper to eat badly than to eat well, and it&#39;s certainly easier to lose weight if you make space for it in your budget. Health is a reasonable spending priority, but the writer&#39;s attitude is condescending and tends towards the black and white.

				It has occurred to me....there&#39;s &quot;difficult: and then there&#39;s &quot;impossible.&quot;&nbsp; I feel like the messages we&#39;re getting thrown lately is that if you are poor it&#39;s impossible to stay healthy, which, in some ways, is another way of keeping poor folk down.

				People generally agree with the side that removes blame from themselves...blaming government for keeping the poor man fat, blaming trans fat in the restaurants, blaming Drakes Cakes, Twinkies, McDonalds, removes all responsibility from us and our choices to purchase those foods, take the elevator instead of the stairs, walk to work, circle the block for thirty minutes rather than park a couple of blocks away, etc....but it is easier to blame others, thus making ourselves feel better. I&#39;m not in great shape, but I don&#39;t work out, drink and eat crap of my own volition, and unlike the teen at Commerce Bank, no knife to me...<br /><br />

				Is it really more expensive to eat healthy?&nbsp; I think that healthy <em>convenience</em> foods are more expensive, but if you are doing your own cooking with raw ingredients it&#39;s cheaper to eat better.&nbsp; Certainly for many people there isn&#39;t enough time to seek out produce bargains and cook, but I&#39;d be interested to see the statistics on how many low income households contain one or more non-working adults (i.e. grandparents, adult children)--in my limited experience I have found that it&#39;s pretty common.&nbsp; I think that a public initiative including meal planning classes and food stamp-like vouchers for produce (you can use food stamps for produce, but these would be addtional) would be a great step--heck, I want to be part of that program.<br /><br />I think another big issue that&#39;s going to explode in 5-10 years is the obesity rates in the children of low-income families.&nbsp; It&#39;s a runaway train that&#39;s going to be very tough to stop (wait, is this the cliche thread?).&nbsp; It involves not only the convenience of fast food but the very fact that parents don&#39;t want their children to feel denied and junk food is an affordable luxury.

				there was an interesting article in the NYT yesterday about schools sending home BMI reports to Parents, yet still selling ice cream sandwhiches in the cafeteria.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/08/health/08obesity.html?_r=1&amp;bl&amp;ex=1168405200&amp;en=99069f4d0d3d8b8e&amp;ei=5087%0A&amp;oref=slogin (http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/08/health/08obesity.html?_r=1&amp;bl&amp;ex=1168405200&amp;en=99069f4d0d3d8b8e&amp;ei=5087%0A&amp;oref=slogin)

				The article (I read most of it) was unclear as to why the BMI report was perceived as negative. This child was upset that her Body Mass Index was in the 80th percentile (and while the article made it sound like 5% to 85% is the norm, she was probably a hefty sized little girl) Apparantly she stopped eating...So the question I guess becomes, is this reporting of BMI appropriate? and how exactly is it reported to parents and children. I tend to believe that obesity stems more from lack of information rather than income...so communication with families about their children&#39;s health should be appropriate. My question is, how was it handled that this child was left feeling self-conscious...probably not appropriately.

				I am revising my previous opinion. &nbsp;Obesity is all about money.<br /><br />The BMI reports, as well as the media coverage which accompanies it, is a perfect marketing technique for the Meglocorps (General Mills, Nestle, Nabisco, Messina Foods, McDonalds, Nike, Addidas et al).<br /><br />On one hand, sell the kids the ice cream sandwhiches and greasy breakfast pizza. &nbsp;Then send the kids home with BMI reports. &nbsp;Without any education or grounding on which to use the report, all it shall do is to make parents hysterical, and then they&#39;ll buy health foods and expensive gym equipment. &nbsp;Hysterical Americans make for great consumers. &nbsp;And for the few who develop eating disorders from all of this, there is a pill the companies can sell them.<br /><br />As far as the MC&#39;s are concerned, this obesity thing is a gold mine, and why would they want to stop it? &nbsp;Heaven forfend if Americans (or westerners in general) squeeze themselves into a nice sustainable ecological footprint. &nbsp;As long as we spend money either gaining or losing weight, that&#39;s okay by them! &nbsp;The Violent Acres of the world are just as good to them as the people who have to buy two airline seats to fly. &nbsp;She&#39;s been duped as much as anyone else: &nbsp;Common sense has been replaced by neurotic behavior because our only form of collective realty check is the idiot box.

				Well, maybe one way or another it comes down to dollars and cents. But I don&#39;t think this issue will go away. Rather than attacking the school cafeterias, I think education is the way to go. You know...&quot;teach a man to fish...&quot;<br /><br />You can&#39;t go five minutes without an anti-smoking commercial on the air depicting a hole in a singers throat, a man that had his entire tongue removed, and sidewalks outlined with body chalk...intermixed of course with Dunkin&#39; Donuts, Sizzler, fast food commercials, etc.... When is someone going to start showing the person that can no longer fit behind the wheel of their car, or taking up two seats on the train. , At what point does one become more dangerous than the other? You don&#39;t get lung cancer from eating too many twinkies, but the effects of obesity have serious detrimental health, social, and financial outcomes as well.

				I think education has to go hand-in-hand with accessibility. Of course, if education creates a demand for healthier food - in school cafeterias and elsewhere - that might help. <br /><br />In fact, in the situations I&#39;ve read about where schools do offer nutritious, healthy food, it&#39;s because educated and aware parents got hyper-involved and really pushed for it - and probably volunteered to do some of the actual work.

				That is a situations where money is a factor....the parents that are available, ready and able to be concerned about their children&#39;s cafeteria food are probably not holding down a second job...less invovlement, poor lunch selection, less healthy options...fatter kids? maybe..
