				Hello,<br /><br />I just moved from 36th Ave. and 32nd Street to the above-mentioned area and I was wondering if there was any good diners within walking distance of my apartment.&nbsp; I used to go to the Cup and I guess I could still walk there, but something closer would be a lot better as I like to roll out of bed on a Sat. or Sun. and make a quick dash to get the corn beef hash platter (yum, my mouth is watering just thinking about it!)<br /><br />Your help is greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, are there any good pubs in the area, preferrably not on Steinway &amp; B&#39;way and not named Admirals!

				Wow, thanks for the quick response!&nbsp; I really appreciate it!&nbsp; <br /><br />There was a little Greek diner that I used to go to every Sat. morning on 37th Ave and 32nd Street, but I just can&#39;t walk that far.&nbsp; I love diner breakfast, but not that much.<br /><br />What is your favorite diner, by the way?&nbsp; I really liked the Cup, personally, and Sanfords on Broadway is awesome, but again, I am pretty lazy on the weekends and tend to limit my movement to a five block radius, which actually is pretty good in this area since 48th Street &amp; Northern Boulevard is the center of the universe for the big box stores!

				There used to be Nua on 46? and Broadway but now it&#39;s called Time Cafe? &nbsp;I loved living in that area. &nbsp;So close to all the great big stores on Northern Blvd, and only a 7 min walk to Steinway and a 10-12 minute walk to N train at Broadway, in case the R isn&#39;t running. &nbsp;And in the summer, Cavo&#39;s outdoor garden is open, which is so beautiful and the food is wonderful. &nbsp;It&#39;s not a pub but it&#39;s cool to hang out and have coffee there and fun drinks in the spring/summer. &nbsp;42nd and 31Ave I think. &nbsp;And the Dry Rite laundromat on 48th and 31 Ave is 24 hours, or at least it used to be. &nbsp;Dillingers does have a good brunch and free mimosas!

				Try Michael&#39;s on Broadway at 34th Street.<br />I&#39;ve never understood why people like Sanford.&nbsp; I try it every few months to try and figure out why people rave about it, but have never had a good meal there.&nbsp; I have, however, gotten sick there twice, which may color my view of the place.&nbsp; What are the good items on the menu?&nbsp; Maybe I&#39;m ordering the wrong stuff.

I just wish it was closer to my apartment- its a long walk from Broadway &amp; 29th! Though I would probably never leave the pub if i lived any closer. <br /><br />Why do all the Irish Pubs on Broadway sucK?? I would be such a happy camper if a good pub would open up.

				Sanfords is one of the best diners in Astoria.&nbsp; Try the foccacia sandwiches -- amazing!<br />There is also a really good diner on Northern Blvd. near Best Buy but I forgot its name.&nbsp; It&#39;s a really small building and easy to miss, but has excellent food.&nbsp; They deliver too!<br />But overall my favorite diner in Astoria is the Bel-Aire.&nbsp; Fast, efficient service and big portions of delicious food.<br />

				I like Bel-Aire, I just prefer Michael&#39;s as it&#39;s so close and friendly (and tasty too - though they give you way too much food.&nbsp; Who can eat all that?)<br />I have seen the small dinner on Northern and have thought about going in.&nbsp; Maybe I&#39;ll check it out next time I go to Best Buy.&nbsp; I&#39;ll definitely try the foccacia sandwiches at Sanford on my next attempt.&nbsp; I&#39;ve had burgers there and they didn&#39;t do it for me (though the burgers at Michael&#39;s are nothing to write home about either).

Especially if you get your food delivered. Its a shame too, because they are so conveneint for me- but everytime I order from them the food is cold, soggy or they give me the wrong order!! The food is a bit better when you eat in, but I still don&#39;t think it is anything to write home about. I much prefer New BelAir or Michael&#39;s.

				the best burger I&#39;ve had in Astoria so far was at Aliada, but that&#39;s off the topic....<br /><br />any reports on the Thai restaurant on Broadway in that area (40s) ... Thai Chile I think it&#39;s called... <br />

				On the corner of Broadway and Northern Blvd. (about 6 blocks from where you are) there is a tiny breakfast diner that is always packed. I used to take the subway from that Northern Blvd. stop and meant to try breakfast there but never did. Last Saturday there were about thirty people jammed in there at 11am. <br />
