				I just wanted a bit of advice on possibly subletting my apartment. I need to be overseas this summer for anywhere from 6 weeks to two months. Last year I did a similar thing and ended up boarding my cat with her vet for the period, which ended in costing me rent + boarding fees for the cat (and she was a little overweight when I got her back, due to inactivity). I was thinking that this year instead of doing that, it might be possible to find someone to sublet the apartment AND take care fo the cat for that period of time, helping me out with rent. <br /><br />I have a one bedroom apartment, on 21st street just above Astoria Blvd. The rent has just increased to $1200 per month. The place is close to the park, a short walk to the Astoria Blvd station, and about the same distance to the 30th avenue shopping area. Its a large, airy and bright apartment, nicely furnished. <br /><br />What sort of rates would be a reasonable amount to charge for subletting, given it has the &#39;look after the cat&#39; as a condition of the sublet? how would you go about finding someone you trust around your stuff and your pet? and what would be a good security? do bills get included in the rental rate (I have cable internet, but no cable TV, the landlord pays heat and water)? How do you go about drawing up a &#39;contract&#39; for this sort of thing? is it binding at all if you do so?

				I&#39;m not sure I could trust a stranger with my stuff or my cat, no matter what contract I drew up. Do you have any really close friends who&#39;d be willing to take care of your cat, and stop by your place once or twice a week to pick up mail?&nbsp; Perhaps the cat could go over their place?&nbsp; Perhaps your parents could watch it for you?&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#39;ve never subletted but there might be someone on here who can give you a better perspective and advice on how to go about that.

				I agree, if you&#39;re going to have your cat stay there, I would only sublet to someone you really trusted - if not a close friend, a strong recommendation from a friend. I wouldn&#39;t trust craigslist for that.<br /><br />I haven&#39;t subletted in ages and not in NYC, so I don&#39;t really have suggestions for the other questions.

				I&#39;d first get it in writing that your landlord is okay with you subletting.

				I think that you&#39;d probably find someone easily who would be willing to sublet. Since this is a longer period that you will be away <em>and</em> you&#39;ll need the person to take care of your cat I&#39;d suggest that you meet with the person first. I would also recommend charging most if not the total of your rent (maybe reduce it to $1000 or $1100 because of the cat). On top of this if you are worried about having a stranger stay at the place give one of your good friends a key and have them drop by once a week or so to make sure all is well.<br /><br />Honestly, you can find really reputable people to stay in your apartment through craigslist. There are a lot of people who come to NYC for the same reasons any of us go to Europe or elsewhere - business, classes, vacation, etc. You just have to make sure that you filter out the bad and take the people that are professional, responsible, and safe. A lot of people do this and I&#39;d say the majority have little if no problem.<br /><br />Oh additionally, you should probably ask to see their ID when you meet them to verify that they are who they say they are - and if you have a scanner, scan their ID and print it out just in case.

				In a similar situation a few years ago, my bartender at my local watering hole ended up staying at my place for a month.&nbsp; I had to eat some of the rent, but I got someone I trusted to live in the apartment and take care of the cats, and she had a place far closer to work, without roommates.&nbsp; I&#39;m with Daisy and Melee, I&#39;d want someone I really trust to take care of my kitties (the worldly goods are important too, but they can be replaced...).

				I would LOVE someone I know, or someone who comes recommended (ie: friend or relative of someone I know) to be my subletter/catsitter, however, i&#39;m not sure this is possible. Unfortunately, I&#39;m new in this town/country so parents or a large network of friends are not available to me. Maybe I can convince people to look in on cat occasionally, but over a long period of time, I worry that this becomes onerous. Also it would be really nice to have some help with rent - I dont&#39; expect all of it, but some of it would be a huge relief - not that I have hotel bills to worry about so much (on a grant) but other expenses can add up. <br /><br />I did really just want opinions on this. Cos frankly, I&#39;m feeling pretty nervous about the prospect myself. <br />

				Totally do-able.&nbsp; Post your dates here and ask for recommendations.&nbsp; Get references.&nbsp; Have friends check in on cat.<br /><br />Either suspend phone/cable service or ask for a deposit for bills -- my only real word of warning.

				My two cents:<br /><br />I was a cat-sitting subletter this fall.&nbsp; It was a great chance for me to move to the city and get accustomed to this life without jumping into a lease.&nbsp; I got the apartment/cat-mommy gig thru craigslist and, because I was based in Orlando at the time,&nbsp; never had a chance to meet the kitties&#039; real owners until the day before I moved in.<br /><br />I think what worked for us were some specific things: The owners were up-front in the craigslist ad about their kitties&#039; needs (one was deaf, the other blind...I kid not) and that they needed someone that was going to spend time petting and loving on the cats -- not just dumping food in a bowl.&nbsp; also, they made it clear that I would be getting a great deal on the rent, simply because I was going to be caring for the cat. They reduced the rent from 700 to 500 dollars.&nbsp; It defintiely made it worth my while to prove my worth as an applicant.&nbsp; The other thing that worked for the couple was a $1000 deposit -- essenitailly 2 months rent.<br /><br />As to my part, as part of my inital contact with the couple, I provided them with details about my experiences with pet-sitting and with growing up with several cats.&nbsp; I let them know a little about what I love about cats and that I knew I would be cleaning out litter-boxes as part of my rent-discount.<br /><br />With a phone call and a picture exchange later, we were all set!&nbsp; <br /><br />At the end of the sublet, the couple said that their cats were the happiest that they had ever been with their parents gone for so long! :)&nbsp; We remain friends.&nbsp; They did come back for a weekend during the sublet period and so were able to check on how the cats were.&nbsp; After seeing how happy the cast were and how clean the place was, they were really relaxed.<br /><br />So I guess, my advice is to try the craigslist thing if you must -- it worked for me! But defintely look for someone who has had pets or lots of pet-siting experience...Also, I would suggest having someone drop in once every month to check on the kitties.&nbsp;
