			I used to play at 28st street rink , which was a really nice place to play a while back .&nbsp; They had league games with refs&nbsp; and alot of people showed up for pickup games . Then all of a sudden everyone stopped and the volleyballers took over . What a shame !&nbsp; &nbsp;They built a nice place and all for nothing . Now hoodrats are tagging up on the place and ruining it . I saw two girls walking a huge pitbull and the dog dumped right in the middle of the face off circle and they just left it there .&nbsp; I pass by sometimes to see if anyone ever plays but to no avail . WTF happened to everyone &gt;?<br />&nbsp;
