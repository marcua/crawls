				so, like many of us, i utilize drop off service and get my laundry done each week.&nbsp; i have been going to the same place for almost 2 years.&nbsp; they&#039;re nice, service has been fine, whatever.&nbsp; last week, i found about 12 pairs of mens socks in with my clean stuff, and a bunch of my clothing was missing.&nbsp; i brought the socks back the next morning and said, &quot;so.. um... anyone bring my stuff back.&quot;&nbsp; no one did, but the lady at the laundromat thinks she knows who it ended up with and will get it back.&nbsp; i stop back in every other day, and i am VERY nice, and VERY understanding (my roommate thought i should have made a fuss, i figure.... what&#039;s the point?).&nbsp; <br /><br />so because they&#039;ve always been so nice, and i figure, what are the chances of it happening again, i took another load in this morning.&nbsp; the woman said again that she&#039;s sorry, and will get my stuff back, and leaves a note for her husband to give me a discount when i pick it up that night.&nbsp; when i went to pick it up, he would not give me a discount.&nbsp; he said that if more time goes by and the man who they *think* has my stuff doesn&#039;t bring it back, then he will give me a discount.<br /><br />i decided not to go back there.&nbsp; there is another laundromat with drop off service not too far away, and only slightly less convenient.&nbsp; i didn&#039;t like that i was told i would receive a discount, and then didn&#039;t.&nbsp; <br /><br />am i overreacting?&nbsp; under-reacting?&nbsp; what would you have done?<br /><br />thanks.<br /><br />&nbsp;:|<br /><br /><br /><br />oh yea, and i am predicting the question: it was the laundromat on newtown ave at 30th street.

				I probably would not have been as nice as you were.&nbsp; They were my clothes, clothes are not cheap.&nbsp; I would have been pretty darn pissed probably.&nbsp; Another reason why I do my own laundry.&nbsp; Not only am I anal about my clothes and how they&#039;re washed, I&#039;ve seen these laundromats wash clothes and I wouldn&#039;t trust them with my stuff.

				I get angry enough when strangers empty my clothes out of the machine without giving me two minutes to get them out myself. I don&#039;t trust them to thoroughly make sure all my socks and underwear are out of there. <br /><br />Anyway, I would definitely not go back - losing them is one thing, but then to have the guy deny the discount you were offered is even more disheartening. They should&#039;ve been happy you came back in the first place. Surely the discount wouldn&#039;t have been enough to pay for more than one article of clothing, if even that.

				I would not have gone back, but it&#039;s hard to find a laundromat you like and where you have a good relationship with the staff.&nbsp; I usually use Old Neighbors Laundry on Broadway, but tried out the new Chow&#039;s, which took over for My Beautiful Laundrette.&nbsp; They lost my sheets, and despite repeatedly checking back in, I never got them back.&nbsp; I just moved back over to Old Neighbors.&nbsp; It&#039;s a block further over and they don&#039;t put my white shirts on hangars, but they&#039;ve never lost anything.

				Old Neighbors bleached my clothes once.&nbsp; All non-white stuff.&nbsp; It was a new staff member who didn&#039;t last long.&nbsp; I still go there.&nbsp; The owner didn&#039;t exactly apologize, but he did let me add up the cost of what was ruined and give him a price and he had a check ready for me within a few days.&nbsp; I still had to replace stuff...some of which I couldn&#039;t. But at least he didn&#039;t argue with me over the prices I gave.&nbsp; I figure it could happen anywhere, but at least here, if they screw up they make good on it.

				I had a similar thing happen over the summer but it worked out in the end.&nbsp; I picked up my clothes before work one day and got home only to realize that my whites had been mixed up with someone else&#039;s so instead of my favourite t-shirts I had a bunch of hospital uniforms.&nbsp; I took everything out that didn&#039;t belong and when I went to the laundry place was told that the stacks were next to each other and got put in the wrong bags.<br /><br />I still go to that place and it was the only issue I&#039;ve had with them in over four years.&nbsp;

				I would not have been so nice. I wouldn&#039;t have made a scene, but I would have made my displeasure known. It would also depend on how much the clothes that were lost were worth. <br /><br />I definitely would not have went back with more laundry. Since they are reluctant to give you discount after they said they would, It&#039;s obvious they don&#039;t take customer satisfaction or their responsibility to return laundry to the correct customer seriously enough.

				We are always saying that we&#039;re done with our laundry place because they keep losing our socks (sorry, not men&#039;s... ). On the top of the bag are always a bunch of single socks that we hold onto with the hope that maybe we just forgot to send the other sock and will come across it the next time we get our laundry together. Alas, our bag of socks without partners has now filled a large shopping bag and I do believe it&#039;s time to let go.<br /><br />We use the place on 30th Avenue and 35th Street... they pick up and deliver. If we could find another place that will pick up and deliver to our address, we&#039;d be happy to try them.

				It has occured to me more than twice to have a lost sock gathering.&nbsp; <br />You&#039;d hang all your single socks on a clothes line - and who ever finds a matched pair gets to keep it. <br /><br />Wahoo.&nbsp; The fun.&nbsp; <br />It never occured to me that you should only invite people who go to the same laudromat in order to increase the odds of a match. <br /><br />

				wow, no way would have gone back....especially after the second let down.&nbsp; i also wouldn&#039;t have taken that from the husband.&nbsp; i would have demanded that he speak to his wife...or would have gone back when she was there.&nbsp; if you needed the stuff then i would have paid, and still gone back to her later to complain...and then still not go back.&nbsp; make a fuss if you have to!<br /><br />i always thought it&#039;d be pretty great to use that kind of service, but now i&#039;m not so sure.<br /><br />i guess ultimately though, it&#039;d be ok if you gave them stuff to wash that you wouldn&#039;t care much about losing.&nbsp; but then even still, they should somehow make good if something does happen...even if it&#039;s just a simple gesture like a minor discount on the next visit.<br /><br />you&#039;re lucky to find anywhere with good customer service anymore.&nbsp; it&#039;s just such a shame, really.&nbsp; the customer is always right, and if you don&#039;t get the satisfaction you want, you have to spend your money elsewhere.&nbsp; i mean no offense to the people who work in the laundromat, but how freakin&#039; difficult can it be to keep track of what you&#039;re washing?!&nbsp; load a machine, empty it&#039;s <em>full</em> contents, double-check, load another.&nbsp; i think that&#039;s a really important part of the service you&#039;re paying for.

				after waaay too many incidents like this one, I stopped dropping off my clothes at the laundry about a year ago. Too many times I&#039;d come back with less than I dropped off and always, always, always ended up with other people&#039;s stuff.&nbsp; The only things I drop off now is &quot;big stuff&quot; like sheets and towels.....but I dont trust my clothes to anyone but ME.<br />

				now that&#039;s a great idea about sheet and towels...i can&#039;t stand folding sheets.<br /><br />how much does a typical wash run you (and how much are you bringing in)?&nbsp; i&#039;d think it&#039;s really pricey if they&#039;re going by weight.
