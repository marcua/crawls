				Hi All:<br /><br />I wanted to start a thread where I can post events that are run by Astorians for Peace and Justice. Direct from their web site: www.astoriansforpeace.org<br /><br />&quot;Astorians for Peace and Justice was founded in the spring of 2003 in opposition to the Second Gulf War. Our mission is to bring people together in our diverse neighborhood who share a commitment to social justice and democracy to work locally for a more peaceful world. <br /><br />AFPJ works to build community through education, outreach, cultural exchange, and political action. We are an independent, non-partisan, and non-sectarian organization that believes all people have the right to live in peace and with dignity.&quot;<br /><br />This is a local group supported by volunteers. Meetings are usually held once or twice a month at the Freeze Peach. Support is always appreciated and long-term commitments are not required. Even if you can come support one event and get involved, it is always appreciated. <br /><br />I&#039;ll keep events posted as they come up. To get more involved you can PM me or respond here. <br /><br />For example, there is an event to accumulate information from high school students about army recruiting. Volunteers are sought to interview high school students about the information they are given regarding army recruitment. <br /><br />Hope this thread garners some interest...<br /><br />Think globally, act locally!<br /><br />

				Alexa, can you please post events you come by from AFPJ on the calendar, too?&nbsp; That would be most helpful.&nbsp; I get announcements from them and will try to put them on the calendar, but if you could also consider posting them there, that would be great.

				Sure. I was at the meeting last night and a lot of time was spent reviewing about ten events that occurred in March (very full month). Next meeting will be April 24th (Tuesday) at 7:30 at the Freeze Peach.

				If anyone is interested:<br /><br />There will be a training/information meeting about the &quot;Students or Soldiers? Coalition&quot;. The purpose of this meeting is to provide information and broad training to volunteers who will informally survey students from high schools about the information they are provided about joining the military. The meeting will be held on April 11th in NYC. The coalition is hoping to cover as many high schools as possible and to cover every borough. Queens is a little week on representation. The following is information directly from the Coalition: <br /><br /><div align="center"><strong>Are military recruiters roaming the halls of our schools?<br />Are they interrupting class time to speak to students?<br />Are they coming into our schools uninvited?<br />We know that all these things are happening in many of NYC schools. </strong>&nbsp; </div> <br /><br />The Students or Soldiers? Coalition* has been in discussion with the Dept. of Ed to try to ensure that schools are complying with the regulations regarding the Opt-Out forms and not allowing military recruiters to have more than equal access to students as do college and employment recruiters.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Students or Soldiers? Coalition*, in collaboration with the Office of the Manhattan Borough President, is conducting a large-scale survey of New York high school students in order to find out where, how, and how often military recruiters target their schools. We need volunteers to survey students exiting designated schools in every borough on the afternoons of Monday, April 16th and Wednesday, April 18th at dismissal time.<br /><br />We are asking all volunteers to join us for a training on the evening of Wednesday, April 11th at 6:30pm at the UFPJ office (261 W. 36th Street, 7th Floor between 7th and 8th avenues). Please RSVP to arosmarin@nyclu.org if you&#039;d like to attend the training and/or have questions about the surveying project.<br />

				I went to a meeting to night for United for Peace and Justice, which is a national organization. I posted before, but they are looking for volunteers that are willing to survey college students about military recruitment in there schools. Although I was interested prior to the meeting, after the meeting I was disgusted with some of the information I learned: <br /><br />1. The &quot;No Child Left Behind Act&quot; stipulates that military recruiters have the right to come into schools for recruiting. <br /><br />2. Unless students fill out a form within the first month of school saying they DO NOT want their personal information provided to recruiters, the school provides phone numbers and addresses of these students. By the way, the Opt Out forms are sent home in English while the targets are usually minority groups, many of whom English is a second language (English language learners are provided with web site info, allegedly, so that they can access their own language, but the links and the site are all in English)<br /><br />3. Recruiters are so comfortable and familiar with the school personnel, that in many schools, they do not sign in and out. <br /><br />4. In many schools, students take class time to fill out an armed forces aptitude test, after which they are sought for specific items and told how wonderful they did and then promised specific training in very alluring fields that they cannot make good on. <br /><br />The board of ed is saying that they don&#039;t have any data to support that recruitment is excessive and unfairly distributed in schools with high minority populations, and they don&#039;t have any data to support there isn&#039;t a fair amount of college recruitment going on at these schools as well. <br /><br />UFPJ wants to get data, but volunteers are NEEDED. Are you angry yet? Do you want to do something. I felt very foolish and naive at this meeting that I wasn&#039;t aware of these tactics. Please, please let me know if you are interested in supporting and volunteering. <br /><br />Volunteering is only requiring an hour or two of your time, to talk to some of these kids and find out what they are exposed to in their schools. PM if you want more details or are interested in volunteering, in doing something.

				Here is some more information sent to me by the coordinator. If you aren&#039;t doing anything, and want to actually support a movement, not just posting about it, come and help out. <br />&nbsp;<br />Iraq Veterans Against the War is planning to stage an &quot;Operation First <br />Casualty&quot; action in NYC on Sunday, May 27th. You can learn more about this by clicking on the following links. <br /><br />http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/video/2007/03/19/VI200703190144 <br />6.html <br /><br />http://www.ivaw.org/photos/gallery/Operation+First+Casualty,+Washington+DC,+ <br />March+19,+2007 <br />&nbsp;<br />If you would like to see the IVAW press release about this event or would like the route for Sunday, e-mail maryannlewis@earthlink.net.&nbsp; <br /><br />IVAW is planning to have a dress rehearsal in Astoria Park on Saturday, May <br />26th.&nbsp; They need people to bring food for about 40 participants at around <br />12:30pm.&nbsp; Astorians for Peace and Justice would like to provide support for <br />this action.&nbsp; We are conceptualizing this as a pot luck picnic.&nbsp; If you <br />would like to help out and are willing to bring food, drinks, paper plates, <br />cups, silverware, etc to the park, write to&nbsp; maryannlewis@earthlink.net <br />or call&nbsp; 718-721-3458.

				This group hasn&#039;t gotten involved in the pricing, but I noticed that Heff (a member on the board you can PM) has been pretty vocal with this area. Try him.

				Some of the problems include:<br /><br />Targeting minority populations of lower SES<br />Overrepresentation of military recruitment as compared to college recruitment<br />Misleading students regarding the benefits of joining the military<br />Schools giving out personal information regarding home address, numbers, etc. to aid military recruitment. The groups are not advocating to get them out, rather to monitor how they are involved in our schools. <br /><br />Read up on it to get more information.
