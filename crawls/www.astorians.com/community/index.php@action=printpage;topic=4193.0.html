				Avatars <del>is</del> <del>are</del> is the feature on here that I love the most. For me, well I guess, it&#39;s like waking up in the morning, making a cup of coffee, and walking out to sit on the porch, and finding that someone has planted a new blooming tree in my front yard *every* morning. The view makes it even more enjoyable, sometimes, than the content!

Urbana had a Sweet Corn Festival every August, but most years they had to import the corn from other states! I recall one year the sweet corn was from Colorado! The problem is that almost all of the corn grown in the corn belt is for livestock consumption or to make HFCS and other processed products. So if the timing of the small amounts of sweet corn grown is off by just a little, there&#39;s none for the festival!<br /><br />I do think of Western parts of the upper Midwest as corn country, like Iowa and Southern Minnesota, although not as densely as Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana... Yes, there&#39;s lots of dairy in Wisconsin, and fair amount of land that&#39;s still lakes and forests, especially once you get North of Madison and Milwaukee...<br /><br />Oh, and I still think of Illinois as mostly agricultural. :) There&#39;s only that little corner up there with skyscrapers, factories, and people!<br />

Sources tell Billboard.com the reports are legitimate but would not publicly comment until final details are nearer to completion.<br /><br />This year marks the 30th anniversary of the release of &quot;Roxanne,&quot; the single that broke the Police in the United States. &quot;Discussions have been underway as to how this will be commemorated,&quot; reads a post on Sting&#39;s Web site attributed to an A&amp;M spokesperson. &quot;While we can confirm that there will indeed be something special done to mark the occasion, the depth of the band&#39;s involvement still remains undetermined.&quot;<br /><br />Sources say in addition to DVD releases, A&amp;M is planning another multi-disc collection in the vein of 1993&#39;s &quot;Message in a Box,&quot; which featured the band&#39;s complete studio recordings and a handful of rarities.<br /><br />A Police reunion has been the concert industry&#39;s dream for two decades, as it is believed the band could play stadiums internationally should it choose to reunite. But besides an impromptu set at Sting&#39;s 1992 wedding to Trudie Styler, the Police&#39;s only other post-breakup performance was in celebration of its 2003 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				&nbsp;:-)Thanks guys...and gals...<br /><br />I wentashoppin&#039; for a new one when MY Kitty cat refused to animate and drink his beer and lift his remote. I started a thread of my own about Avatars when I tried to do something creative w/ the PhotoBooth and PhotoShop on my new Mac Laptop. I actually did graphics on a Mac IIci w/ PhotoShop like....1993....<br /><br />Well.....use it or lose it....I&#039;m pretty overwhelmed by the New PhotoShops array of......stuff.....gotta spend time.....like a month locked in a cave with a good light and a chair...to catchup.<br /><br />So, I Googled &quot;Avatars&quot;....found one offering free avatars...I&#039;d never pay for one...puh-leeeeeze.....scrolled around....some are downright graphic.....like psycho-killer graphic...geez......and Spiderman getting the back of his head pumped by a....rascal, as Daisy put it........well, look no further!<br /><br />Again thanks......Merm&#039;s Avatar of the lumbering Teddy Bear gets my vote. Remember the original Ghostbusters where the staypuff marshmallow man was conjured up and terrorized the streets of NYC? That&#039;s what Merm&#039;s Avatar reminded me of....cute...and vaguely menacing.....nice work.<br /><br />So Merm, now that we are on the subject, and you being the techie-pro that you are....how DO these animated Avatars work? What are the limitations to porting over to the Astorians.com site?
