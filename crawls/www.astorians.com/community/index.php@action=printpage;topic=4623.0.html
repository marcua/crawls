				Looking for a female roommate to share a railroad-style 2BR apartment in the Steinway section of Astoria starting in January.&nbsp; Rent is $750 per month, security deposit required.&nbsp; Gas and water are included, but be prepared to split the monthly electric bill (last month’s bill was $75 when my former roommate was here) and household expenses like dishwashing soap, toilet paper, etc.&nbsp; If you want to share the Time Warner Cable (I just have basic channels, no HBO) and Internet or the Poland Spring then we’ll split that too.&nbsp; There is no land line here so you’d have to use your cell phone or arrange for a land line to be installed if that’s your preference.<br /><br />The apartment is in a two-storey building, prewar I’m assuming, with great sunlight, high ceilings and wooden floors.&nbsp; The landlords live in our building and are responsive about repairing things when needed.&nbsp; Our rooms are on opposite sides of the apartment, which is a great setup for roommates because you can be social yet you’ve got your privacy and space when you want to.&nbsp; The living room is narrow and a bit awkwardly sized but the kitchen is really large and spacious, great for someone who loves to cook (I do!) or laze about and enjoy the sunshine while sipping coffee and staring out the window on a Saturday morning.&nbsp; Your room is decently sized (about 10’x10’), looking over the backyard, and has a pretty large closet by NYC standards.&nbsp; Previous roommates have complained about lack of heat in the winter and the landlords don’t seem to be able to do anything about it – we’ve got old steam radiators that don’t seem to distribute heat evenly throughout the apartment. I remedy this with the occasional use of a space heater.<br /><br />It’s only a two or three minute walk to the Steinway R/G/V station and maybe ten minutes or so on foot to the Broadway N/W stop.&nbsp; There are plenty of terrific restaurants right in the general vicinity and you won’t be hurting for access to grocery stores, banks, etc.&nbsp; I’ve been living here for over four years and can fill you in on all the neat places around this area – I’ve got a long list and keep investigating new places as they open.&nbsp; <br /><br />A little about me:&nbsp; I’m in my early 30s doing IT-related work at a nonprofit in midtown Manhattan, friendly and outgoing but also need to regenerate with some alone time after working hard all day.&nbsp; I study Japanese as well as Japanese calligraphy (considering applying to graduate school in East Asian Studies) so if you’re into Japan, we might have a lot to talk about.&nbsp; I also love to cook and am constantly on the prowl for new food discoveries.&nbsp; If you love cooking, so much the better – that kitchen’s just perfect for an afternoon spent experimenting with a new recipe.&nbsp; I’m a journal writer and Trekkie.&nbsp; I’m a social drinker, a non-smoker and I like to party as much as the next person but generally don’t go overly crazy.&nbsp; <br /><br />What I’m looking for:&nbsp; someone who wants to make this a home, not just a place to crash.&nbsp; Accordingly, someone who respects the idea of keeping common areas clean. I’ve never been accused of being a neat freak and I’m pretty laid back but I expect that we will split cleaning duties fairly.&nbsp; I’ve been making some improvements to the house to make it more enjoyable to live in and plan on doing more of the same.&nbsp; If you’re interested in joining me in this venture and creating a real welcoming living space to come home to then that is a big plus!&nbsp; Rent must be paid on time.&nbsp; No pets, please, and no smoking in the house.&nbsp; Overnight guests are fine but not long-term-verging-on-third-roommate arrangements. <br /><br />If you’re interested in learning more about this apartment based on what you’ve read so far then feel free to PM me with questions and some information about yourself and your interests.&nbsp;

				Couldn&#39;t find the option to edit this message so just a P.S. to the above -- apartment is available in January or February.&nbsp; I&#39;ll post again here when it has been taken.

				Hey,<br /><br />Your place sounds perfect for my situation. I just moved to NYC from the Bay Area. I&#39;m living with my brother in midtown Manhattan right now, but am definitely ready to have my own space. I&#39;m about to begin a master&#39;s program at Queens College in Library Science part-time and will be working full-time. I&#39;m into creating a home, sharing meals together on occasion. I also love to cook and have taught cooking for the past 4 years. I was a teacher full-time as well, but am in the midst of a career change. I keep a clean home and respect common space. Grew up in Seattle, college in Israel and Amherst MA... 26 y.o., huge music lover and down to earth, but not too mellow.<br /><br />Let me know if the place is still available. I&#39;m ready to move as early as Jan.24<br /><br />Many Blessings,<br />Daniella (510)421-1581<br /><br />PS- I&#39;m in Paris until Mon. night 1/22:)
