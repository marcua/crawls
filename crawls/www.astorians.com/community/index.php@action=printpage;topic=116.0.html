				Thanks freezepeach for hosting an awesome campaign nite gathering. &nbsp;it really helped to get together with the community to watch the election reports. &nbsp;<br /><br />Still weary from tossing and turning in my bed last night... no, 'twas not from the awesome iced chai, &nbsp;, just the torturous thoughts of four more years...<br /><br />&nbsp;:shock:

				I agree about the campaign event. It was a nice turnout.<br /><br />I also admit that I tossed and turned all night, dreaming that Kerry won, and feeling relief, but waking up and realizing that in reality everything was still up in the air. I am greatly disappointed at Kerry's loss (my co-workers are equally depressed). I only hope that 51% of America hasn't made a grave mistake in choosing Bush to run our country for another four years.

				i now correct the title of my thread to &quot;The Mourning After.&quot;<br />Truly this has been a very heavy loss, and I feel such a heavy sense of &nbsp;grieving around me. &nbsp;Just as with a death, everyone is trying to imagine how the dems/liberals/progressives are going to pick up the pieces after such a loss. &nbsp;<br /><br />but indeed lets not forget thta we have come a long way since 4 years ago and consciousness will expand even further in the next four years. &nbsp;I mean, I remember talking aobout Halliburton after 9/11 only to receive blank stares. &nbsp;Now awareness about this and many other GOP &quot;elements&quot; has been raised. &nbsp; <br /><br />sigh. &nbsp;nothing else to say except that i am not only saddened but also simply incredulous in the face of it all.

				I must've talked to about 10 people that all said they had dreams about the election last night. &nbsp;I myself didn't, but maybe that's because I probably didn't get any sleep.

				been a lurker for the past few weeks.... but here it goes....<br /><br />to George W. Bush:<br />BRING IT ON!<br />I'm gonna call you on all your bullsh** that you have been feeding us these past 4 years. Myself and my clients are going to make your life miserable for the next 4. &nbsp;Do you know how excrutiating it is to be working in a GED program for kids who dropped out of high school b/c your schools have failed them? Do you know how excrutiating it is to hear a first time voting student tell me that voting yesterday was a waste of their time b/c your corrupt administration won? Do you know how much it sickens me to hear from a student that they are fearful of being sent into this war and at the same time furious knowing that you never served?! There will be no 'unity'. &nbsp;There will be people fighting for what they believe in: what is right, something that your administration knows NOTHING about. BRING IT ON GEORGE!
