				Last night I was told by worker at Create on 30th ave (the salad/sandwich place) that they are opening an additional location on Ditmars where Top Tomato used to be. Will be nice to have another salad bar option in the area.

				I just looked at the menu. This place looks great and reasonably priced.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad there are a lot of healthy options on the menu.&nbsp; I wonder when it will open.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t seen them doing any work in that space yet.

				If I remember correctly, one of the reasons Top Tomato sat empty for so long was that the rent was extremely high.&nbsp; I wonder if the landlord finally lowered it or just found someone willing to pay the money.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad it&#039;s finally being put to use though!

And surprisingly, it isn&#039;t THAT big of a space. It has a fairly wide street frontage, but not very deep. But there&#039;s always someone, somewhere who think they can make a go where others fear or won&#039;t go.

				Supposedly, the TT space is bigger than it appears. In a previous thread on Astorians.com (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=15864.0) discussing Top Tomato closing down, a real estate broker said the store is 3,000 square feet if you include the refrigerators in the back and get this, the asking price was 25K per month (or $100 per square foot per year)! Top Tomato was said to have been paying 19K per month. This was back in 2009. <br /><br />According to this listing, it appears to be true, plus the space could be divided. Create wouldn&#039;t necessarily be taking all of it:<br /><br />http://www.cityfeet.com/cont/forlease/ln18276308/33-15-ditmars-blvd-astoria-ny-11105 (http://www.cityfeet.com/cont/forlease/ln18276308/33-15-ditmars-blvd-astoria-ny-11105)<br /><br /><br />In a more recent article (from 2013) average rents on Ditmars were quoted to be in the mid-$50s to mid-$60s a square foot (per year)<br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 14px;" class="bbc_size">http://www.crainsnewyork.com/data-lists/real-estate-deal-watch/details/12/2906079 (http://www.crainsnewyork.com/data-lists/real-estate-deal-watch/details/12/2906079)</span></span>

				I tried it this weekend and was very disappointed.&nbsp; I decided to order what they call the Pad Thai Wrap.&nbsp; I love Thai Food and thought it sounded interesting.&nbsp; It said it had sesame grilled chicken in it.&nbsp; Well I didn&#039;t even taste any sesame taste at all because of the overpowering hot sauce they thought would be a good idea to put on this wrap.&nbsp; It was awful and didn&#039;t have much chicken in it.&nbsp; The best thing about the sandwich was the shredded carrots.&nbsp; Also, it was very noisy in there and the chairs are not comfortable.&nbsp; I&#039;ll give them another try with a salad.

				The two locations are related - at least according to the takeout bags.<br /><br /><br />That said, I ate there twice over the long weekend (takeout both times) and both times the food was delightful!&nbsp; On Saturday I did the &quot;Market Table&quot; with grilled chicken, mac-n-cheese and haricot vert with mushrooms.&nbsp; The owner-type was there and threw in potato wedges and squash for me to try and both were as good as the other items.<br /><br /><br />Yesterday we ate there again and I had the Cuban Bowl with brown rice and grilled chicken.&nbsp; It. Was. Amazing.&nbsp; The portion is huge so I ended up having the second half for lunch today and it was equally as tasty the next day.&nbsp; My husband had &quot;The Skinny&quot; bowl with the turkey burger and he thought it was good as well.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I can&#039;t say much for the atmosphere since I did takeout each time but it&#039;s a nice addition to the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Hopefully people find it more to their liking over time.

Good news since my experience with the 30th Ave location has consistently been very good.&nbsp; I hope the experiences others had was just due to being brand new and working out the kinks.&nbsp; The Cuban Bowl sounds good to me.&nbsp; I&#039;m really looking forward to having them close to home for breakfast (delivery).

				I actually grabbed a protein shake from there on the way home last night and it was also pretty terrific. Was called the Monkey something or other (cant remember) but had peanut butter, banana, etc.&nbsp;
