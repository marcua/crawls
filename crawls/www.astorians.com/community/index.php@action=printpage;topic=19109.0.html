				Thanks Sarah, I am debating between Edna and Adela.&nbsp; I think Adela is more rushed.&nbsp; Does Edna take her time and listen?&nbsp; Have you ever tried Adela?&nbsp;

				A friend at my gym had her color done by Edna - single process, not highlights. But gorgeous color - very shiny, even,<br />healthy-looking. Really beautiful.

				I&#039;ve never tried Adela. Basically, I (stupidly) went to the beauty school for highlights and when they applied the toner it brought all the red undertones in my hair WAY out. I looked like mid-90s Ginger Spice. I immediately ran to SPAce and asked whomever could to fix it. Edna did an amazing job and I&#039;ve gone to her ever since. In the past two years I&#039;ve had everything from hair above my shoulders to halfway down my back, bangs, layers, dark brunette to tons of blonde highlights, Brazilian blowout ... and I&#039;ve been happy with it all. <br /><br />She does take her time and listen, most definitely. Sometimes you&#039;ll come in and have your shampoo done while she&#039;s still finishing up with another client but I never mind because she does such a great job (and is just trying to make sure the other person looks perfect - and she&#039;ll do the same for you an hour later).

				Thats great, thanks ladies.&nbsp; I think I have decided on Edna.&nbsp; I like someone who listens and doesn&#039;t rush me.
