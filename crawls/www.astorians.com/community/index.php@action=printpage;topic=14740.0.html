				I need suggestions for a nice bar in the area. I&#039;m young and not really into the euro bars or sports pubs. Anyone know if a good place?

				Everyone I know likes McAnn&#039;s off of Ditmars ... it&#039;s kind of a Irish Pub / Sports Bar&#039;ish place. Beer Garden is also popular this time of year. You could also try Break Bar on Broadway if your looking for a game of pool. And last but not least, The Irish Rover on 28th St is always chill as well.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know Kavo or Central, but these places are pretty average bar&#039;s with billiards and darts and such ...<br /><br />Hate to show my ignorance, but Euro Bar? What&#039;s a Euro Bar?

				Blackbirds, on 30th Ave and 42nd Street. They have TVs that play sports, but it doesn&#039;t have a &quot;sports bar&quot; feel to it. Decent beer selection and good food. The last time I went, there was a band playing and it was way too loud, so I guess look out for that if you plan on having a conversation.

				Indigo is nice, plenty of sports tv but not overbearing, contemporary atmosphere without being lounge-y (genuine Irish bartenders too!)<br /><br />Cronin &amp; Phelan&#039;s is a good pub, local but not a dive, also good tv w/o being too much.<br /><br />McCann&#039;s can get a little too sports-like for my taste, but I suppose it depends on the night.

				Rapture! It&#039;s on 28th Ave. 35th st. Happy Hour EVERY day 5-8 pm, 2-for-1 on ALL drinks! Everything is reasonably priced anyway though. It has a very chill vibe to it, with couches and big comfy chairs all over. The food is pretty good too. It&#039;s a pretty small place, and gets kind of busy on the weekends, but not crazy crowded (at least when I was there). And if you have a table, you&#039;ll have a waitress so you won&#039;t have to yell over a sea of people to get a drink. I&#039;m actually really surprised that more people don&#039;t go there.

				I&#039;d say Sunswick, Sparrow, Hellgate Social, Rapture, Indigo, and Crescent Lounge are good bars that aren&#039;t sports bars or Euro bars. Good music at all of these and a good atmosphere.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				thanks for all the suggestions. I sort of made up the word Euro bar to describe cavo and central. No insult to the people that go there but its a little too guido for my taste.
