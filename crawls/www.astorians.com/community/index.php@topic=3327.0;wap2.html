			&quot;Strange now to think of you, gone without corsets &amp; eyes, while I walk on<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;the sunny pavement of Greenwich Village.<br />downtown Manhattan, clear winter noon, and I&#39;ve been up all night, talking,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;talking, reading the Kaddish aloud, listening to Ray Charles blues<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;shout blind on the phonograph<br />the rhythm the rhythm--and your memory in my head three years after--<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;And read Adonais&#39; last triumphant stanzas aloud--wept, realizing<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;how we suffer--<br />And how Death is that remedy all singers dream of, sing, remember,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;prophesy as in the Hebrew Anthem, or the Buddhist Book of An-<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;swers--and my own imagination of a withered leaf--at dawn--<br />Dreaming back thru life, Your time--and mine accelerating toward Apoca-<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lypse,<br />the final moment--the flower burning in the Day--and what comes after, <br />looking back on the mind itself that saw an American city<br />a flash away, and the great dream of Me or China, or you and a phantom<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Russia, or a crumpled bed that never existed--<br />like a poem in the dark--escaped back to Oblivion--<br />No more to say, and nothing to weep for but the Beings in the Dream,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;trapped in its disappearance,<br />sighing, screaming with it, buying and selling pieces of phantom, worship-<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ping each other,<br />worshipping the God included in it all--longing or inevitability?--while it<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lasts, a Vision--anything more? ...&quot;<br /><br />- Allen Ginsberg

			Four Seasons fill the measure of the year;<br />There are four seasons in the mind of man:<br />He has his lusty Spring, when fancy clear<br />Takes in all beauty with an easy span:<br />He has his Summer, when luxuriously<br />Spring&#39;s honied cud of youthful thought he loves<br />To ruminate, and by such dreaming high<br />Is nearest unto heaven: quiet coves<br />His soul has in its Autumn, when his wings<br />He furleth close; contented so to look<br />On mists in idleness--to let fair things<br />Pass by unheeded as a threshold brook.<br />He has his Winter too of pale misfeature,<br />Or else he would forego his mortal nature.<br /><br />--<br />Keats
