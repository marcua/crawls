				This probably has been discussed before but I was reading an article recently and it pointed out that if Hilary Clinton wins the presidency in 2008 and is re-elected to second term it will mean that we will have had a Bush or a Clinton in the White House for 34 years, by which time Chelsea and Jenna (or Barbara) will be old enough to run.<br /><br />Now I’ll vote for Hilary if she’s the Dem nominee but this really depresses me.

				I think we&#039;re focusing on the wrong statistic here. Yes, there have been 12 years of Bushes, and 8 years of Clintons. But a more startling fact is that in the last 40 years there have been only 12 years of Democrats in the White House, and 28 years of Republicans. That&#039;s an alarming 3 to 7 ratio! Personally Hillary would be my 3rd or 4th choice for president (after Edwards, Biden, Obama), so I also prefer not to have more Clintons at this point. She&#039;s more the status quo candidate. She would do less in regards to standing up to corporations, fair trade, securing our ports and borders, getting us out of Iraq, and putting forth an aggressive environmental plan, than the other democratic candidates. She&#039;s adapted some of Edward&#039;s plan for health care, but she wants to compromise with the health insurance and pharmaceutical companies, which is the wrong approach. We need a MAJOR shift in direction, and she is unlikely do to so. She would be a marked improvement of Dubya, put that&#039;s mainly because the bar couldn&#039;t be set any lower.

(and one Republican served only for one&nbsp; day)<br /><br />So the Democrats have controlled Congress for most of the time for the past 50+ years. Even longer when you go back as far as the New Deal era. That means control over budgets, legislative agendas, committee appointments, confirmations, etc.<br /><br />To me, that&#039;s far more alarming. If you don&#039;t think so, add up how much you don&#039;t see next time you look at your pay stub. Or next time you want to complain about the direction this country is in.

				The shift I&#039;m referring to is to have the country return to focusing on what&#039;s best for the <strong>people</strong>, and not what&#039;s best for the corporations and the richest 1%. Corporations need to work within the rules of society, and not the other way around, where the corporations dictate to the people by controlling the government. This is the shift that has to be made to bring the country back on track. Without it we&#039;ve become an oligarchy.

				The root of the problem is that government, especially legislators, can be bought to begin with. Corporations do play by the rules -- they happen to have a heavy hand in influencing those who make the rules. As long as the govenrment is allowed to exercise regulation and interfere in the marketplace, corporations are gonig to have something to buy to ensure that that regulation is in their favor.<br /><br />Do away with government&#039;s power to meddle, and corporations will have nothing to buy.<br /><br />And we&#039;ve had this form of oligarchy long before this sitting president was even in diapers.

				Speaking of being bought; what do you guys think of Bloomberg potentially running?&nbsp; I actually am very interested in him as a candidate because of the concerns stated above.&nbsp; While he is definitely not an &quot;average Joe,&quot; he is a huge philanthropist.&nbsp; If I remember, he donated $165 million dollars to charities JUST LAST YEAR.<br /><br />But, the big positive of him, for me, is that he will not NEED any help to get elected.&nbsp; This makes me think that, because he is so wealthy, he will not need any corporate or special interest support to get elected; which means he won&#039;t need to repay any favors down the road.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just curious as to what you guys think and, for those that have lived in NYC for his tenure as mayor, what kind of job he&#039;s done in NYC so far?

				Four years ago Bloomberg raised the property taxes 18.5% for owners of 1,2 &amp; 3 family homes to pay for the budget, saying it was a temporary increase. Becuase they also artificially inflated the property values, I pay close to 30% more. He did <strong>not</strong> increase taxes on businesses or apartment building owners. He has yet to lower these property taxes, and for all intensive purposes never will. Instead he gives a lame rebate. How is putting the added burden only on the struggling middle class not being beholden to the rich and the coprorations? Bloomberg was worth $2.5B when he was running for mayor in 2001, his net worth is now over $6B. MOre than doubling one&#039;s worth in 6 years is quite an accomplishment. $165 million is alot of money, but for him it&#039;s still chump change, since it works within his tax write-offs, so it basically costs him next to nothing, the money goes to charities instead of taxes, and it makes him look good.<br /><br />Even I can balance NYC&#039;s budget by raising taxes, how does that make Bloomberg a good mayor?&#160;

				Bloomberg has been a decent manager, and is surrounded by smart people, many of whom he&#039;s appointed Commissioners, but I still have a hard time liking him.&nbsp; He&#039;s a cold fish, really not personable at all when you meet him, which makes me uncomfortable.&nbsp; I keep trying to like him, but there is just an arrogance and distance with him that makes it hard.&nbsp; His condescension towards Astorians when we lost power and his repeated defense of ConEd and Kevin Burke, their CEO, speaks volumes to his personality.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know that he would be a bad President, but I think we can do better.&nbsp; That having been said, some of his initiatives here in NYC have been visionary, and I applaud that.
