				Ok. There is a super nice blue mountain bike outside my apartment, not chained to anything, just standing there on it&#039;s kickstand. It is on the sidewalk, next to a lightpole, close to the curb, where we always put the trash, but again...not chained to anything. It&#039;s been there for over an hour (going on 2 hours at this point). I live on a busy street, and the only reason it hasn&#039;t been stolen/taken is PROBABLY because people are thinking &quot;oh, the owner is probably right there, in the deli, watching it.&quot;<br /><br />I would LOVE LOVE LOVE to have a bike but I am severely underemployed right now, to the point where I&#039;m putting off getting my hair cut.<br /><br />My question/s: at what point, ethically, can I claim it? How is this that much different from when people leave household items on the curb (my lamp is a trashday curb find)? Obviously, if someone is down there staring at it, it&#039;s theirs....but at what point does neglect (oh, I&#039;ll just leave my bike out here while I go inside and visit my friend) become surrender, or when can I assume it&#039;s fair game?<br /><br />I do not advocate stealing at all...but this bike seems just so blatantly available. It can&#039;t be right, can it? I&#039;m seriously having a real internal debate about this! Can I take the &quot;trash&quot;? Is it even trash, or is it&#039;s owner that adorably naive?<br /><br />I am not opposed to sitting downstairs on a folding chair next to it for a couple hours, as if I own it, to deter other possible takers.

				<em>Two hours?! </em>&nbsp; :-o I say go get it, it&#039;s right next to the trash anyway. <br /><br />If nothing else, go bring it inside, and if you see somebody looking for it, go talk to them.<br /><br />There&#039;s a picture someplace on the internet, a hand-written sign tacked to a light pole that said something like, &quot;If your bike is missing, call me and I&#039;ll bring it back,&quot; with a phone #.<br />

				Ok, so I took the bike. Eek!<br /><br />Turns out it belonged to my across-the-hall neighbors, who are moving out of state. She said that the brakes are kinda messed up, but she bought it at Tony&#039;s (used), so if I wanted it, I should go there and tell them it was from there and see what they can do for me. So I&#039;m gonna see how much it is to get it all fancied up, and if it&#039;s too much, I&#039;ll put it back and let someone else have an ethical debate about it. As we were talking, her friend came up (I think she was helping her pack) and we talked about how leaving the bike out is an interesting experiment, and it totally lasted out there almost 3 hours! (before I snagged it.)<br /><br />Who knew a bike on the sidewalk would turn into such a sociological experiment?

				There is no ethical argument.&nbsp; Unless you know it&#039;s been put out for trash (which you didn&#039;t), then it&#039;s not yours to take.&nbsp; If someone was dumb enough to leave it out there unlocked, it still doesn&#039;t mean you have the right to take it.&nbsp; If someone is dumb enough to leave their wallet on the subway, does that mean you have the right to take it?&nbsp; I&#039;m no Holmes or Wolfe, but I&#039;d take a guess and say that you probably already knew that it would have been ethically wrong to take it, but were trying to look for some justification.&nbsp; That being said, there would have been someone else that would have taken it on the spot and had no qualms about it.&nbsp; That&#039;s a point for you, however, and at least shows that you had some doubts about the situation before you acted.&nbsp; As far as the haircut goes:&nbsp; grow it long and look hip, cut it yourself, or I&#039;ll send you a check if it will help you out, no quid pro quo.

I was on my way out and bumped into her. I&#039;ll admit, I brought the &quot;hey, so there&#039;s this bike outside&quot; conversation up, but she said &quot;oh yeah, it was mine, if you want it, take it.&quot; (So, technically, it was put out as trash, and I did know that when I took it.) And even after the conversation with her when I knew it was up for grabs, I thought &quot;ok, if I run my errand and come home, and the bike is still there, I&#039;ll go upstairs and put my stuff away, and then come back down to take it.&quot; If I had found a wallet on the subway, I OBVIOUSLY would have done my best to return it to it&#039;s owner, and I&#039;ve been known (to my mom&#039;s dismay) to go back into a store when they undercharged me by half (mom: &quot;you lucked out!&quot; me: &quot;the trainee girl rung me up wrong, I don&#039;t want her to get fired!&quot;)<br /><br />I don&#039;t want justification to take other people&#039;s stuff. That&#039;s super crappy. I just wanted to know what the social rule is for this kind of stuff. Even if it may have seemed that I would have taken it, I&#039;m a big believer in &quot;what goes around comes around&quot; so I probably would still be sitting in my window at this moment staring at the bike. But since the owner told me I could have it, I had no qualms about taking it, and I look forward to whizzing around the neighborhood on my awesome new bike :)

				If it&#039;s on the sidewalk by or near where the garbage usually goes, it was probably a safe bet it&#039;s being dumped, and it was left out to be taken. Especially if it&#039;s been there for hours. Almost nobody in NYC would leave their bike outside a the gates of a residential property without it being chained, at least not more than a minute or so. Congrats on your bike.

				I wasn&#039;t justifying stealing the bike; I did mean hang onto it until you could find the owner, and if no owner turned up, consider it garbage picking. <br /><br />I once found a wallet on the ground, and drove across town to return it intact. Seems crazy to just leave stuff that could otherwise be protected.....or put to good use.<br /><br />Glad it worked out! Congrats on the new(ish) bike!&nbsp; :mrgreen:

And then it says Chromium, which just makes me think of Erin Brockovich.<br /><br />I&#039;ve only ridden a bike once in the past 15 years or so! I was on a long weekend in Block Island a couple years ago and we rented bikes. I was a little worried that I would have lost the hang of it, but as I pedaled down the street, I called to my friends, &quot;Hey guys! It does come back to you! It really IS just like riding a bike!&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m super excited, I love riding bikes. I had forgotten how much I enjoyed it until that Block Island bike ride, but since then, I haven&#039;t really been in a position to buy one. But I&#039;m a bike owner again now, yay :)<br /><br />(Also, I just used the word &quot;bike&quot; 9 times, this is ridiculous. Bike bike bike!)

				I once took a very old dilapidated one home that had a &quot;FREE BIKE&quot; sign on the handlebars. Ended up donating it to Recycle-a-Bicycle.<br /><br />My S.O. had a bike &quot;follow&quot; him home last year- an old bike he saw in the trash. Took him two weeks to saw out the seat post (if you don&#039;t grease the seat post, it&#039;ll fuse into the frame.) Eventually, he sandblasted the frame, repainted it, and replaced most of the components with ones he had lying around. Now it&#039;s his beloved &quot;city bike&quot; (for around town.)<br /><br />Wishing you many, many fun and safe rides! Be sure to get a helmet and lock.<br />

				If you have the slightest doubt as to whether an unlocked bike in operable condition (or any other piece of property) may belong to a person who is not discarding that bike, leave it alone. Do not touch other people&#039;s things. Your gut told you that the bike belonged to somebody. You know better. <br /><br />I know that you got the &quot;OK&quot; from the owner, but your thread pushed my buttons. When I was about 4 or 5 some doosh bag picked up my dump truck in the sand box and squeaked &quot;finders keepers, losers weepers&quot;. I don&#039;t remember who kept that truck, but I still despise people who use that argument.<br /><br />Karma, is a very real thing. If you lie, you may be exposed and your credibility will be shot. If you sell drugs, you may be robbed or attacked. If you steal someones bike, the owner may see you rolling down the street and... use your imagination.

				<em>&quot;finders keepers, losers weepers&quot;</em><br /><br />The difference here is that the person taking it wouldn&#039;t keep it if somebody claimed it. A bike left alone for a few minutes is one thing; a bike left for hours near the trash is another. <br /><br />We left our bikes unlocked outside the barber shop last week, and I was paranoid. Couldn&#039;t take my eyes off them. They were right in front of the window near the door, though, so if anybody started scoping them out, it would&#039;ve been easy to stop them.

				We&#039;re all New Yorkers. We can usually tell what is and what is not being put out in the trash. If something is borderline and you want to take a chance in snatching it up, that&#039;s your call. But realize that you are taking a chance and that you may make somebody ( a local barbershop patron, or even a newbey to the hood) weep.<br /><br />There were no &quot;weepers&quot; in the scenario described in this thread, but I got the idea from the get go that that bike belonged to someone and that it was not blatantly in the trash.<br /><br />Maybe the moral of this story is buy a lock or be weary of owned bike missinterpreters or be cool stay in school.

				Holy crizzoly peeps, I didn&#039;t mean to start a whole debate like this!<br /><br />First of all, I would never steal from anyone. That&#039;s wasn&#039;t my intention. I&#039;ve been stolen from, and I know how it feels. We all know how it feels, I&#039;m sure. (When I was around 4, some kids befriended me at a carnival, and stole my beloved Care Bears purse when I wasn&#039;t looking; I had a relative&#039;s friend steal $60 out of my luggage when I was visiting from out of state; the boy across the street who I thought I was friends with stole my pogo ball that I had left on my porch, and lied straight to my face about it; etc etc etc.) It&#039;s a really sucky feeling, and I like to try to minimize sucky feelings all around. Because they suck. I&#039;m a big believer in Karma and good/bad energy too, so to make a conscious choice to steal something is the emotional equivalent of punching someone in the face, which isn&#039;t a very nice thing to do.<br /><br />If I hadn&#039;t have talked to my neighbors and found out that it was trash (in their eyes), I wouldn&#039;t have taken it. (She actually said, &quot;Yeah, we don&#039;t want it. Take it, it&#039;s yours, enjoy.&quot;) Or, if it had still been out there at like 11pm (which I&#039;m sure we all can agree is doubtful), I would have taken it in and left a sign &quot;I found your bike, call me!&quot; and if someone called me, I would have gladly brought it back down for them, no questions asked. Except maybe &quot;what does your bike look like?&quot; just to verify that it&#039;s theirs.<br /><br />And actually, going back to my original question - how is this that much different than other stuff left on the street for hours? My neighbor told me that they paid around $100 for it when she got it. People leave stuff worth more than that on the sidewalk all the time for other people to take. I mean, I guess I can see that the sidewalk isn&#039;t a TV&#039;s natural environment (something else I saw out there last week), so there&#039;s that.<br /><br />Anyway, sorry if I&#039;ve pushed anyone&#039;s buttons (in a bad way!) I wasn&#039;t looking for an excuse/approval to take something that wasn&#039;t mine - I was just genuinely curious about what I should do! If it didn&#039;t seem that way, sorry again. I&#039;ve missed a lot of this thread while it was happening because my browser is doing something weird lately and not showing me unread threads, and I guess it&#039;s for the better :)<br /><br />(Also, yes, I owned a purple and bright green pogo ball in the early 90s, it was freaking awesome.)

				I&#039;ve got a pretty nifty &quot;sidewalk fair game&quot; story:&nbsp; Some years ago, on a Sunday, I was walking though a public seating area in Manhattan (right near MoMA) and saw a small Tiffany bag sitting on a bench all by itself.&nbsp; No one was around anywhere.&nbsp; So, I walked over to the bag and stood next to it (not blocking it from view) for a few minutes thinking maybe someone forgot it but would some come rushing back.&nbsp; Then I decided I would sit on the bench next to it for 30 minutes to see if someone would come back.&nbsp; No one did, so I carried it to the adjacent buildings security desk and left my name and number in case someone came looking for the bag.&nbsp; I was now in a quandry as to what to do (I figured I had something valuable, but I didn&#039;t feel right &quot;claiming&quot; it).&nbsp; Inside were two tiffany jewlery boxes wrapped with their white bows, no receipt in the bag.&nbsp; I still hadn&#039;t opened the boxes.&nbsp; I decided that I would go to Tiffany (only a few blocks away) and have them open the boxes and see if they could somehow trace the purchaser.&nbsp; I told a clerk my tale, she got a manager, and the manager opened the boxes.&nbsp; A silver braclet and a silver ring: small potatoes to Tiffany and no way, she said to trace it.&nbsp; I left my name and number with her in case anyone came in saying they lost this merchandise.&nbsp; After not hearing anything for 2 weeks, I took the braclet and ring back to Tiffany and exchanged them for a gift card whose value exceeded $500!&nbsp; <br /><br />I feel comfortable with how I handled the situation.&nbsp; If I hadn&#039;t picked-up the bag, obviously someone else would.&nbsp; I waited for the owner and left my contact info with two logical sources and really hoped that the owner would get in contact.&nbsp; People have said that I should have gone to the police, perhaps.&nbsp; But I didn&#039;t think of it.&nbsp; By the way, I sold the $500 gift card to an acquaintance for a deep discount and he bought a very special present for his god-son. :-)

				This isn&#039;t exactly sidewalk stuff, but related to the &quot;finders keepers&quot; debate. One time, at one of my old jobs, I was going to the bathroom, when I saw the tiniest ziplock bag of cocaine on the toilet paper dispenser. I figured someone would soon realize they&#039;d left their cocaine in the bathroom and would come back looking for it, so I flushed it down the toilet. Upon leaving the bathroom, I kept an eye out for anyone who looked unusually panicked, and, when I decided I&#039;d spotted whose it was, I laughed to myself. I feel comfortable with how I handled the situation.
