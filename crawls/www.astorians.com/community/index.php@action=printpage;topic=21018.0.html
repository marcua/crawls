				Hi Everyone! <br /><br />Just wondering if anyone knows of any good (and inexpensive) movers in Astoria? We only need to move about 8 pieces of furniture. We&#039;re taking care of all of the boxes and the little things. <br /><br />Thank you!!<br />Courtney <br />

				svenmoving.com ! They are the best. Theyve moved me twice and a bunch of my friends off reccomendations from me. <br /><br /><br />Friendly, fast, hard working and delicate with items that need care.<br /><br /><br />They just moved our studio and all the equipment was really taken care of.<br /><br /><br />They miiight offer a discount to people who were reccomended (i think i remember them saying that) so mention Keith and The Girl (our studio.) They LOVE us because of it and may hook you up.<br /><br /><br />Either way, their really affordable.

				We used Moishe&#039;s and had a great experience.&nbsp; They came and looked at our stuff and gave us an estimate and some tips to make it easier on the movers (had all boxes in one room, boxed EVERYTHING, and to just get out of the way!).&nbsp; We were super prepared and the move went great and was 1/3 under the estimate.

				Not that I&#039;m likely to be moving anytime soon (19 years in the same apartment and holding), but this is a helpful thread.&nbsp; Kevin&#039;s sounds good.&nbsp; I had a terrible Moishe&#039;s experience when I moved here - triple the charge of the estimate, $10 per blanket charges (which was the oddest thing I&#039;d ever heard), I got billed for their 1 1/2 hour lunch break at full wages and was not allowed to pay via credit card - they made me go withdraw cash and give it to them before they would unload the truck.&nbsp; Live and learn.

				Didnt u have some kind of contract ?&nbsp; Or at least some pricelist ?&nbsp; people can charge anything they want when they dont offer you the cost and mostly in writting . I hate any food place that doesnt have their prices on their menu as if they are above that or something . Total BS !&nbsp; &nbsp; you can charge 50 dollars for a steak or 300 and the customer has no say at all after he has ordered it .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wouldve called the cops and on the spot asked for where it says cash only and charges for blankets ????&nbsp; Every company uses blankets so they dont scratch furniture and then have to end up paying for it .

				I wish I had.&nbsp; I was just out of graduate school, young, naïve and, in my case, stupid.&nbsp; I was intimidated and paid up, furious, but not willing to chance losing my furniture.&nbsp; The only reason I went with them over the others who gave me quotes, was that they took credit cards - the quotes were all about the same.&nbsp; No contract - nothing!
