				<br />http://www.ballot-access.org/2006/10/20/connecticut-5-way-senate-debate-appears-to-help-lieberman/<br /><br /><br />On October 18, the 5 candidates for U.S. Senate in Connecticut debated each other. They were the nominees of the Democratic, Republican, Green and Constitution Parties, and incumbent Joe Lieberman, who is the nominee of his own party, the Connecticut for Lieberman Party. The debate drew considerable attention, including a major article in the New York Times that quoted all five candidates.<br />A Quinnipiac Poll was released on October 20. It is the first poll announced since the debate, and it shows that Senator Lieberman increased his lead. The results: Lieberman 52%, Lamont (Dem) 35%, Schlesinger 6%, other and undecided 7%. <br />&nbsp;:|<br /><br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/19/nyregion/19conn.html?ex=1162008000&amp;en=26d3c4edea446b4c&amp;ei=5070&amp;emc=eta1<br /><br /><br />October 19, 2006 <br />Lieberman’s Iraq Stance Draws Fire in Debate <br />By JENNIFER MEDINA <br />HARTFORD, Oct 18 — Facing criticism from all sides of the political spectrum, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman was forced to defend himself in a five-way debate on Wednesday, at times appearing frustrated and repeatedly invoking his experience to fend off the group of opponents who are trying to unseat him. <br />Unlike the situation in the first debate on Monday, which included only the three major candidates and largely steered away from the war in Iraq, Mr. Leiberman’s four opponents spent much of their time this time assailing his support of the war. <br />And this time Ned Lamont, who defeated Mr. Lieberman in the Democratic primary, primarily because of his opposition to the senator’s support of the conflict, was joined by two minor party candidates in sharply criticizing Mr. Lieberman.<br />Alan Schlesinger, the Republican candidate who widely trails Mr. Lamont and Mr. Lieberman in the polls, called for a three-state solution in Iraq, saying: “The problem in Iraq is not the military. The problem in Iraq is political.” <br />Beyond the war, each of the challengers repeatedly turned Mr. Lieberman’s experience in Washington against him and argued that his 18 years in the Senate and candidacy for national office undermined his contention that he could change the culture in Washington. <br />The format of the debate, which included one-minute answers from each of the five candidates, diffused the arguments and muted the messages of Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Lamont, who have been sparring for months. But like the three-way debate on Monday, the challengers seemed to jar Mr. Lieberman, a veteran debater and orator. <br />Indeed, Mr. Lieberman was cut off several times by the moderator, Bob Schieffer, the chief Washington correspondent of CBS news and the host of the program “Face the Nation,” when he ran over his allotted time for answers. The debate was taped in front of hundreds of people at the Bushnell Theater here and was to be broadcast on WFSB in Connecticut at 7 p.m. on Thursday. <br />After all four of his opponents railed against the war — the Green Party candidate Ralph Ferrucci said troops should be pulled out “right now” and Timothy Knibbs, the Concerned Citizens Party candidate, said the United States should get out “immediately” — Mr. Lieberman insisted that any discussion about it in Congress should include those who do not favor immediate withdrawal. <br />“We cannot and will not stay in Iraq forever,” he said. “My commitment to Iraq is not indefinite or unconditional. We need to stay there as long as there is a reasonable prospect with our help of building a free and independent Iraq, which will be a whole different path in the Arab world.” As he went on, Mr. Lieberman was cut short after his time ran out and Mr. Schlesinger responded sharply: <br />“You see this is what happens when you spend six years running for president and vice president of the United States, you begin to believe you are actually in the executive branch of the government.”<br />When Mr. Lieberman repeated his recent call to replace Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, Mr. Knibbs took a jab, suggesting it was because the senator had been on the “short list” to replace him. <br />Still, the overall tone of the debate was far more measured and substantive than either Monday or the primary debate, with questions ranging from domestic issues like social security and gas prices to the threats from North Korea and Iran. <br />Mr. Lamont criticized a bill Mr. Lieberman sponsored that called for “regime change” in Iran. <br />“Reminds us an awful lot of how we got into Iraq,” he said. “I think first and foremost we’ve got to use hard-headed tough negotiations, working in concert with our allies, try sanctions and force as a backup.”<br />Mr. Schlesinger made it clear that he agreed with Mr. Lieberman on that issue, saying that it would be impossible to negotiate with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran. Mr. Lieberman did not back off his support for the legislation, saying it was because “there are some leaders you can’t negotiate with.” <br />“History reminds us in the case of Hitler and Osama bin Laden that they said exactly what they ultimately did,” Mr. Lieberman said. “He wants to wipe out Israel and he has told thousands in the town square of Tehran: Imagine a world without the United States of America. That is possible in our time.” <br />In previous debates, Mr. Lamont has appeared off-kilter and nervous. On stage, he seemed slightly more comfortable, though he often spoke quickly during his answers. Mr. Schlesinger, who gave a dramatic performance in his first debate this week, appeared calmer, though he continued to deliver lines that drew several whoops and laughs from the audience. Even Mr. Lieberman chuckled when Mr. Schlesinger derided Mr. Lamont’s wealth and the millions he has spent in his campaign. But Mr. Lieberman was more often the recipient of the barbs from Mr. Schlesinger, who derided him as a tax-and-spend liberal whom conservative voters should not trust. <br />Later, he said Mr. Lieberman did not understand the “real world” between the “Potomac and Hollywood.” <br />“If you had someone doing a job for 18 years, and after 18 years their record was one of complete failure, what would you do? What do you think should happen with that person?,” Mr. Schlesinger said before turning to Mr. Lamont and asking, “You’re a businessman, what would you say about someone like that?” <br />Quietly, Mr. Lamont responded, “It’s time to go.” <br />Even as Mr. Lieberman hammered the concept of bipartisanship and invoked his credentials as an independent, he spoke of the prospect of becoming chairman of the Homeland Security committee if the Democrats take over the Senate.

				It looks like Lieberman is comfortably ahead, but I still hope he stumbles.&nbsp; I&#39;ve never cared for him, disliked him ever since he took out Lowell Weicker.
