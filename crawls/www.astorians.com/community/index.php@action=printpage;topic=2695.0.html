				I for one feel that we should demand a complete disclosure of all the proposed develoments from our community board, local politians and city planning.&nbsp; We only hear of things in piece meal (i.e.&nbsp; a piece on waterfront development, a piece on the development of Northern Blvd, etc.)&nbsp; I feel it is our right to know what is happening.&nbsp; For work, last week, I had to attend a local community board hearing in the Bronx whose only purpose was to inform residents of what was happening.&nbsp; &nbsp; Why don&#39;t we have meetings like that here? Queens is home to a variety of planned communities and we should be proud of that-Mathews Model Flats, Sunnyside Gardens, Norword Gardens, Jackson Heights, etc.&nbsp; )&nbsp; The key word is planned, not infilling!

				just like to point out jackson hts was a community planned <em>a century ago</em>. the design plans worked yes, but that kind of planning cannot be done unless <em>large</em> stretches of land are open. for example the buildings surrounding the one where i grew up used to be a golf course. unless there&#39;s one of those in astoria, a planned neighborhood ain&#39;t gonna happen.<br />also the heights is mostly 6 story buildings with at least 20 units on each floor (most buildings have 2 wings) i do believe those are the &quot;evil&quot; buildings we should be rallying against. <br /><br />but i do agree that more information to astoria residents is much needed.<br />i just think that those who repeatedly call for action should propose how they intend to go about it. and i don&#39;t mean they themselves, how do you plan to engage the community and the powers that be with your concerns instead of just repeating the same thing over and over again on an online board. which it is doubtful the politicians even read.

				Yes, many planned communities were built many, many years ago.&nbsp; But if you look at their overall plans you will see that infrastructure did accompany those plans.&nbsp; I do not think you need large amounts of land to look at planned communities.&nbsp; I do think our community board needs to stop approving zone variances on an ad hoc basis and look at the entire area. If you look at what is happening in other parts of Queens, you will find that in other communities they are downzoning and demanding this from their local leadership. <br /><br />As far as what I am doing about it, I&nbsp; do attend community board meetings and other civic meetings. Unfortunately, the more I attend these meetings, I find a lot of people either do not have all the information, are misinformed or never really thought about it before.&nbsp; I joined LICA to try to do something about this problem.<br /><br />I think it is good that it can be discussed here.&nbsp; Sharing ideas will only help us to learn from one another and make an even better community.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				There&#39;s &quot;sharing ideas&quot; and then there&#39;s &quot;beating people over the head with ideas.&quot;&nbsp; Guess which one is more welcome or palatable?<br /><br />Delivery style is key. If someone comes to me and implies that I must be stupid or ignorant (used in the perjorative), or that I just don&#39;t care, I know I won&#39;t respond positively.

				I could not agree more.<br /><br />Showing respect to your listeners through your delivery and use of language is the only way to insure that you will still have listeners in 5 minutes. And showing respect is not a throwaway - it&#39;s something that requires a bit of effort.

				I personally think this debate is about money. On one hand you have developers and renters, on the other side you have landowners and long time residents. I think this boils down to supply and demand - other issues are given to &quot;mask&quot; parties financial interest.<br /><br />On the one hand the developers talk about how they are bringing new money into the city, upgrading infrastructure, paying for parks, increasing tax revenue, etc etc. The bottom line is that these guys make a ton of money off these projects.<br /><br />Building new buildings however increases supply for housing congested areas and lowers demand and housing values for home owners. This upsets homeowners because an increase in supply means lower demand on their rental units and homes. Property values go down, rent goes down - this is bad for homeowners who want to be able to charge as much as they can get to rent out their buildings.<br /><br />People who want their communities to stay exactly the same as they were 50 years ago are dreaming. You can&#39;t live in a city and not expect for develoment to happen. Things constantly need to be upgraded and changed in order to sustain human beings. On the other hand though I do think there&#39;s a sustainable amount of development, and an unsustainable amount. Building multiple towers and giant housing projects all in a short timespan might be over the line for me personally. I&#39;m new to this discussion.<br /><br />But, I also don&#39;t buy a lot of the reasons given for pro or anti development. This is about pure money and greed on both sides to me. If you look at who benefits in either scenario those of us who just rent are the last ones in line to benefit.

				Merm - I think you&#39;re right overall, but I think the new buildings actually increase the property value in the neighborhood generally, especially if they are good construction, over the longer term (though I agree that the new units might reduce the cost for renters in the short term).&nbsp; I think better construction and high end work actually gentrifies the area to an extent, which brings other problems.&nbsp; We don&#39;t want to lose the mixed income nature of Astoria and we don&#39;t want to displace lower income people and seniors, who may not be able to pay higher property tax (if they are property owners).&nbsp; <br />I think what happened over the last decade on the Upper East Side is illustrative - the new buildings (many of which, if not all of which, were highrises) increased the housing stock and brought the median rent down, resulting in a larger number of more affordable apartments.

				This debate is *not* over by a longshot!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">(http://graphics10.nytimes.com/images/misc/nytlogo153x23.gif)<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Bloomberg Administration Is Developing Land Use Plan <br />to Accommodate Future Populations</strong></span><br /><br />By SAM ROBERTS<br />Published: November 26, 2006<br /><br />Faced with a shrinking inventory of vacant land, the Bloomberg administration next month will unveil its goals for accommodating the city’s growing population over the next 25 years and the municipal services that nine million or more New Yorkers will require.<br /><br />Chief among the priorities of the mayor’s Sustainability Advisory Board, led by Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development, is how to reclaim as many as 1,700 acres of polluted land—brownfields and other former industrial parcels—and transform them into environmentally sound sites for schools, apartments and parks.<br /><br />Among the other goals being explored by the 17-member board, which Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg appointed in September, are improving commuting times (at 39 minutes on average, now the highest of any big city in the nation), maintaining and protecting the drinking water supply, reducing sewage overflow into the city’s surrounding waterways during stormy weather, and reconciling the region’s growing energy needs with clean-air standards.<br /><br />The board is expected to outline its draft agenda by the end of next month, then place it before civic groups and the public for further debate. In mid-2007, the mayor will present its final goals—and strategies to achieve them.<br /><br />Driven by higher birth rates among Hispanic and Asian New Yorkers, the influx of about 100,000 immigrants a year and a housing boom that is attracting newcomers to each borough, the city’s population hit another peak last year, of 8.2 million. If those trends persist, the population is projected to reach at least nine million in the 2020’s.<br /><br />Responding to the mayor’s pledge in his State of the City address last January to produce a “strategic land use plan” to deal with a city of nine million people, Mr. Doctoroff said: “We have the capacity through rezoning and underutilized land to go well over that number. But you cannot simply divorce the issue of growth from the infrastructure required to support it.<br /><br />“It opens up great opportunities only if the growth is smart,” he said at the time, explaining that growth that fosters economic development could, for instance, help balance the city’s budget.<br /><br />“Growth for its own sake is not necessarily good,” Mr. Doctoroff said. “We have a structural budget deficit. You want to ensure that the growth that takes place helps to ameliorate that deficit rather than exacerbates it.”<br /><br />City officials declined to publicly elaborate on their proposals in advance of the advisory board’s announcement. But some of its goals were foreshadowed by two of the largest rezoning revisions in city history—of the Brooklyn waterfront in Greenpoint and Williamsburg and the Far West Side of Manhattan—both driven by Mr. Doctoroff.<br /><br />The two major zoning changes, coupled with other development proposals, including the Atlantic Yards project in Brooklyn, were aimed at revitalizing underutilized land for economic development and expanding the city’s property tax base. The zoning changes were accomplished, in part, by tying them to the city’s timetable to apply for the 2012 Olympic Games.<br /><br />The city lost its Olympic bid, which included the ill-fated proposal for combining a stadium for the Olympics and the Jets with an expanded convention center on the West Side. But Mr. Doctoroff maintains that he also viewed the Olympics as a vehicle to drive the sort of longer-range planning in which local governments rarely have the resources, or the vision, to indulge.<br /><br />“Ultimately the most important point was to finally create the conditions for the West Side to develop,” he said.<br /><br />The stadium proposal itself generated the most criticism, and even some of Mr. Doctoroff’s supporters said he did not do enough political spadework to see it through. But Mr. Bloomberg, among others, says that Mr. Doctoroff has not gotten his due.<br /><br />“Doctoroff, by the time he gets done,” Mr. Bloomberg said recently, “will have a greater impact on this city, I think, than Robert Moses, in a much more democratic world where there’s a lot more community input and a lot more supervision from the courts and the Legislature.”<br /><br />Planners who were interviewed agreed that the biggest growth constraint that the city faced was accommodating nine million people within its boundaries. Unlike newer cities in the South or the West, New York is not empowered to expand by annexing neighboring communities. But developers are seeing new possibilities for land that was once the site of industry, as manufacturing and maritime uses of the waterfront have declined.<br /><br />The advisory board’s biggest challenge, Mr. Doctoroff has said, is “how are we going to generate the land in a city where land is our scarcest resource to provide for the facilities that will support growth.”<br /><br />“It could be a zoning change, an investment in a form of transportation, it could be park space, working with Con Ed and KeySpan on energy needs,” he continued. “Power plants take acres and acres of land, but if we’re going to grow we’ve got to provide that.”<br /><br />One possible source is the inventory of 1,700 contaminated acres in the city, many of which, consultants to the advisory board believe, can be reclaimed through improved technology. The technology has to be efficient enough, however, to make whatever is built there affordable.<br /><br />If the brownfields were sufficiently decontaminated, those sites alone could accommodate 2,600 schools.<br /><br />“We can’t afford to write off the land,” one advisor to the board said.<br /><br />According to a Department of City Planning survey of land use, one- and two-family homes consume more space than any other category—more than 27 percent—followed by 25 percent devoted to open space and recreation, 12 percent to multifamily housing, 4 percent each to commercial and industrial uses, and a little more than 1 percent to parking. About 7 percent of the land surveyed was identified as vacant.<br /><br />Separately, transportation officials say streets and highways take up about 32,000 acres, which would rank them third in an overall inventory of land use.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Nah, I knew about this study a few months ago.<br /><br />No one takes Doktor-off seriously after that silly Olympics fiasco he tried to orchestrate. <br /><br />With more and more communties taking themselves off the development list, like Rumsfeld in Iraq, his options narrow by the day.<br /><br />Only a few communities in Brooklyn and Queens are left, and (oh the secrets out!) they are chatting with each other.<br /><br />Damn democracy!!!
