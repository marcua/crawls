				having grown up in the grand avenue area, outside of seaburn books on broadway, i don&#039;t think there has ever been a book store in the neighborhood.<br /><br />i think i&#039;ve only been in that store once or twice...and that&#039;s because a friend has been published a few times by their in-house publishing group.<br /><br />my husband who has been in the ditmars area longer than i has said that in the past bookstores don&#039;t do so well here.&nbsp; come to think of it, he might have mentioned that there was a small one in that shopping area adjacent to the train station bridge.<br /><br />i used to work in the book club industry and we were told that reading is a dying field with americans.&nbsp; as a whole, americans tend not to read much, but the ones that do, read voraciously and that&#039;s what keeps the industry afloat.&nbsp; it&#039;s a little hard to believe considering how crowded b&amp;n and borders tend to be, but who really knows?!

				Bookstores are expensive to start b/c you have to buy all your inventory upfront, you can&#039;t get a few things that look nice and expand from there.&nbsp; If you go to a bookstore and they don&#039;t have the book you want, you&#039;re less inclined to return, so it takes a lot of space and a lot of cash to fill that space, all before you open.<br /><br />If you really really want a bookstore like B&amp;N in astoria you&#039;d probably do best to come up with a petition or something that shows a high demand in the area for a bookstore, then send that onto B&amp;N.

				I don&#039;t know why anyone would shop at Barnes &amp; Noble when Borders is here.&nbsp; &nbsp;The difference as someone pointed out is the discounts at Borders, plus the rewards programs.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you Google &quot;Borders Coupons&quot; on the Internet there are always discount coupons posted.&nbsp; &nbsp;A 20% is always available, but those don&#039;t interest me.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are frequently 25% or 30% coupons and occasionally they will have 40% off sales.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t shop at B&amp;N, but I would be over the moon if a Borders opened in Astoria.

				I don&#039;t think bookstores like B&amp;N or Borders will stop opening stores anytime soon.&nbsp; They may reinvent themselves along the way to keep up with the times.&nbsp; They all seem to be making crazy money.&nbsp; I work in Garden City and a nearby B&amp;N which was one level moved over to a new building that was 2 levels.&nbsp; They now also have a Starbucks on the main floor.&nbsp; They seem to be doing well.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if anyone has been to the Atlas open air mall in Glendale but they put in a brand new Borders and also seem to be doing well.

				I agree rnrollgirl! I love Target! Especially after they started selling food products! Their prices on such items as frozen veggies, milk, bread, cheese, yogurts and other food items are so much lower than the supermarkets around here. I usually shop at Best Yet or Key Food. The last time I was at Target the price of Green Giant frozen veggies was 1.29, while at Best Yest the same item is 2.19 and I can go on!<br />Yes! We need a Target so I can buy paper towels, toilet paper, napkins, toothpaste, cling wrap, foil, Downy, Tide, swiffers, etc. all at lower prices than at the Astoria shops.

				yes, familiar with that one too.&nbsp; <br /><br />but for someone who lives all the way by con ed on 20th avenue and 27th street, the steinway train station is still pretty far.&nbsp; might as well drive to college point.&nbsp; parking is free and the store is larger.<br /><br />and besides, i usually prefer driving than using mass transit, but it&#039;d still be nice to have a target in the actual neighborhood (a closer drive).&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)

I HATE border&#039;s layout. I hate both of their prices. It seems to me that they intentionally only keep trade paperbacks where you can see them, and if they HAVE any mass market paperbacks, they hide em, because they want you to pay almost twice the price for no damn reason. prime example: I fell in love with Forever by Pete Hamill, which I read ... sometime in 2007, and I&#039;d never read anything else by Hamill, so I went to see what else he had out! I liked his style you know, so I read the blurb of &#039;Snow in August&#039; and it sounded interesting, not terribly, but readable at least, knowing I like the author. But there was no way in hell I was payin another $15 for it!!! its absolutely absurd. Two days ago I find it in the book bin at my local thrift store for $1.25, AND it&#039;s a mass market paperback. (I like them better for purse reasons.)<br /><br /><br />I think I had a point when I started writing all this ....

				Who knows? I make no predictions about a bookstore coming to Astoria -- perhaps B&amp;N or Borders will set up shop in the neighborhood one day. But I will make one prediction -- the roar of gleeful hysteria upon the opening day will be still ringing in our ears as the waves of the bitchin’ and the moanin’ rise up to complain about how far it is to get to the store -- because the most likely locations, Northern Boulevard or the end of Steinway, are a freaking hike for most Astorians.

				Frankly, I think the poll says it all. Why would they want to make such an enormous investment in a not so certain location as western Queens? I am a voracious reader. And I share this addiction with most of my friends and neighbors. So we simply share the expense of each book. We split the cost among the readers and then usually donate it somewhere. The last reader has the option to keep it. <br /><br />Form book clubs that are not necessarily for the discussion of the books after reading them, but for the discussion of what to buy!<br /><br />If I want a book that no-one else cares to read, I locate an online coupon and buy it for the best price I can find. I have no problem &quot;browsing&quot; through an online bookstore in the comfort of my own home.

So one can&#039;t just say &quot;Who needs Barnes &amp; Noble? Just go to [this store] or [that store]; the selection is great and the people are friendly, and good prices too!&quot; I&#039;m one of the people who voted &quot;Not badly at all,&quot; but I do think this is the reason why people specifically want Barnes &amp; Noble so much. I would guess that the same people would be thrilled if a really great indie book store opened up. <br /><br />28Grand made the best point, though - if a B&amp;N does open here, it probably wouldn&#039;t be any easier to get to for most of us than Strand already is.

I couldn&#039;t read the whole thing, I didn&#039;t have patience for all that language and random \ but I did find the part you were talking about, luckily that was written in plain english for the most part. Here it is:<br /><em><br />So, what happens in the real world? Unless a book gets attention within a few weeks, chain bookstores will return books to the publisher, usually getting full credit if they return the books within a certain period. Indeed, the rate of returns for trade books has risen dramatically in the past few years.<br /><br />The role of the chain bookstore is even more insidious. Chain bookstores negotiate deep discounts with publishers. As a result, books are sold for less and, by extension, some authors receive a smaller royalty. In other words, the very power of bookstores to demand and receive deep discounts has resulted in a depressing of the per copy royalty received by some authors.<br /><br />As the FTC may know, independent bookstores, via the American Booksellers Association, have sued Barnes &amp; Noble and Borders, alleging that the chains are receiving illegal terms of sale, including extra discounts that give them an unfair competitive advantage3. The NWU has notified the plaintiffs that we are prepared to file an amicus brief on its behalf in the action.<br /><br />Furthermore, there is a direct relationship between publishers and the chain bookstores when it comes to the decisions about what books are published. Publishers\&#039; representatives regularly assess with chain bookstores what will sell in the current marketplace or, more precisely, whether a chain will commit to pushing a particular book (e.g., featuring the book in prominent displays or scheduling author readings in its stores). In particular, the coordination is most intense around the selling of books for which a publisher has paid a large advance-a publisher wants to guarantee that the chains will flog those books because of the huge financial investment at stake. </em><br /><br /><br />I gotta say, that totally sucks for those authors, but I guess since I&#039;m not a writer, I don&#039;t think it&#039;ll keep me away from B&amp;N. Because honestly when I go to buy a book I&#039;m not worried about who is making how much money off it. I go cuz I want something to read. But then again, I didn&#039;t stop watching TV during the writer&#039;s strike either. The part I find especially horrid is the bit about the bookstore and the publisher working out which books go on display and whatnot, thats pretty much what I mean when I say I hate their layouts. Yes it&#039;s nice if you know what you are looking for, but otherwise you pretty much just browse the tables, because its really annoying to browse the aisles, since they&#039;re just bookshelves you know? I did it ONCE a long time ago, and I found a good book, but like, its annoying. <br />i dunno. <br />someone should buy out seaburn and organize the damn place.

What other business system even tolerates this?!? Wal-Mart is the only other American company with these kinds of practices and if you don&#039;t tolerate them, how can you tolerate the other?<br /><br />While Starbucks might close local coffee shops, they don&#039;t shut down small coffee bean roasting operations. B&amp;N not only closes local bookstores, they close local presses. Their structure of purchasing destroys the diversity of the publishing industry.<br /><br />I believe that if a person is legitimately interested in written works, especially new, original works by upcoming and avant-guard artists, you cannot support them. They&#039;re crushing the voice of the independent presses. <br /><br />Also, here&#039;s Powell&#039;s (http://www.powells.com/). They get all their listings from small independent bookstores across the country that will do online sales. Truly awesome. I use the site to buy books from my favorite small bookstores in towns I don&#039;t live in anymore so that even though I&#039;m far away, I know I&#039;m still doing everything I can to keep them in business.<br /><br />I just wish the discussion was &quot;let&#039;s get a bookstore!&quot; and not &quot;let&#039;s get a B&amp;N!&quot;. It reminds me of this. (http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.wordpress.com/2008/03/05/82-hating-corporations/)

				I think we agree on this issue. I only wanted to point out that B&amp;N didn&#039;t start the system of &quot;we buy &#039;em, we can&#039;t sell &#039;em, you hafta buy &#039;em back&quot;.

				wow, this topic has become so heavy!&nbsp; ajtnyc i&#039;m sure you&#039;re glad you started this.&nbsp; just kidding.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D<br /><br />although a lot of interesting points have been made in these more recent posts, it doesn&#039;t much deter my opinion about the whole large bookseller thing.&nbsp; as a consumer we have our own choices to make and it&#039;s great that you stand by yours.&nbsp; this is the power of boycotting at its best.<br /><br />as someone who worked on the peripheral of the publishing industry, i don&#039;t feel very sorry for the authors (or publishers) that you&#039;re lamenting about.&nbsp; trust me, they&#039;re making money, and if they&#039;re worth their weight in paper, they stand to make a lot of it through the course of their careers.&nbsp; the longer they&#039;re in the business of getting published, the more they stand to make.&nbsp; it will even get to the point where they can get a guaranteed payment for books yet to be written.&nbsp; then there are promotional appearances.&nbsp; if they&#039;re not getting a direct payment for showing up somewhere, then the logic is that the more promotion they do, the more books they stand to sell just by getting the word out.&nbsp; also, their publishers/agents can sell the rights to book clubs (that&#039;s where i used to work) who pay an advance, as well as royalties on sales.&nbsp; <br /><br />as for the small-scale bookstores, why should they have the same deals as the larger stores?&nbsp; are they buying nearly as much as the larger ones?&nbsp; EVERY business works this way, the more you buy, the better the price.&nbsp; the better the buying price, the better deals they can make to the consumer.&nbsp; and the better the price to the consumer, the more the consumer will buy.&nbsp; sure, it sucks for the smaller bookstores, but that&#039;s just the price of...business.

				Part of my complaint comes not from the damage to established authors, but to new authors and getting new voices out into the community. I would very much like to have a field and system that encourage new voices.<br /><br />But everyone&#039;s got their preferences. It&#039;s the same with clothes and shoes made in America and other consumer choices. I make a big effort to buy green, eat and drink local and purchase things made in America. I&#039;m a big supporter of walking the way you talk and this is how I do it. I don&#039;t hold everyone to my standards (I wouldn&#039;t have many friends if I did!) but I do try to make sure that people understand why I don&#039;t support the businesses that I don&#039;t support. So while I won&#039;t be shopping at a B&amp;N anytime soon, I won&#039;t hold it against you if you do, especially not if you&#039;re willing to understand my choice and my reasons.

				what about target and kmart and jcpeney-mart closing down boutiques? what about c town and pathmark and met foods closing down local grocers? what about macdonalds closing down &#039;joe&#039;s newspaper burgers made with 100% real government cheese!&#039; it happens everywhere there is an oppurtunity to make $$$ capitalisms a bitch. and I don&#039;t remember saying I&#039;ve never shopped at walmart. the place gives me the creeps flat out, but when I was visiting a friend in albany and suddenly needed tampons, I didn&#039;t put up much of a fight when he said hed take me there to get them so he could buy a case of capri-sun and steal sunglasses. business is ugly man. 90% of the small business owners we consider to be awesome perserverists in an age of commerical consumerism, would do the same crap as the evil corportaions if they could. <br />im going waaaay OT and I don&#039;t wanna get yelled at. I agree that some of walmarts business practices are deplorable, I agree thatit would be nice to have a good, clean, well organized book store with a bountiful selection and knowledgeable staff (not that b&amp;n has that) but whether its b&amp;n or para&#039;s books, I would still frequent the place unless the prices are astronomical.&nbsp; btw I guess im less sympathetic to the indie bookstores because theres never been a good one around, much less one that got closed down when b&amp;n moved in to austin st.

				I would like to apologize for my previous post. I am on my phone and I didn&#039;t read the posts after the one where para quoted me and said something about &#039;how can one frown upon walmart but support b&amp;n&#039; and im totally paraphrasing that cuz I can&#039;t quote cuz the mobile version doesn&#039;t support that option. If I had read what was posted in between I probably wouldn&#039;t have gone off the way I did. and btw para I think its awesome that u do that. personally im too cheap to buy things like clothes and books and furniure local, but I refuse to eat at chain restaurants because I believe their fod is insulting to the ppl who eat it. and I should mention I exaggerated my lack of hate for walmart to make my point. I DID buy tampons there without much argument, but that was 4 years ago and I was in foreign waters and didn&#039;t wanna argue with a BOY where im gona buy tampons lol! man that&#039;s funny. every time my bf mentions going to wal mart on li to get motor oil I lecture the crap out of him since I saw that documentary about the russian immigrants that get locked in the store every nite to clean it. but I stand&nbsp; by my sentiment of &#039;business is ugly&#039; does anyone know how to start a busines? maybe some of the more interested parties could team up and open a bookstore. <br />ps im like a secretary so I don&#039;t have much sympathy forppl who can&#039;t be unionized - my boss docs pay in 15 minute incraments, so if ur 5 minutes late, u get docked 15 minutes pay.

				oh! I didn&#039;t mean that comment to be directed specifically to you. I just meant that, in a general way, I think it&#039;s weird that people can dis one but not the other. Wal-Mart does the same thing to their suppliers, forcing them to buy back unsold product.<br /><br />I understand that not everyone can buy they way they want every time. Even I can&#039;t, but I try really hard to make the best decisions that I can and that there are certain luxury items that if I can&#039;t afford to buy the way I think is right, I just won&#039;t buy them. But, hey! That&#039;s me and I&#039;m a bit of a wacko. Ha ha.

Yes, book buyers benefitted in the short run but now in the long run you are paying more for books because of less competition. Aside from best-sellers, does the average book cost less at B&amp;N now as compared to any of the independent bookstores that are left? I&#039;d argue no.<br />

				I know I&#039;m a little late here but I can&#039;t resist&nbsp; adding my 0.02...I&#039;m a voracious reader too. And when I started working across the street from a B&amp;N in the city I thought I&#039;d be in there every day. But I wasn&#039;t, and the reason is Amazon! They discount everything, they have reviews, page views, excerpts,etc. So now I only go to B&amp;N if I have a gift card burning a hole in my pocket. I loved going to bookstores when I was younger (like, a teenager in pre-internet times) but now I can&#039;t be bothered. The annoying music, tripping over people who have planted themselves on the floor in the middle of an aisle,loud cellphone talkers, the odd smelly homeless person, who needs it??I&#039;m so over it. Bookstores may soon be a thing of the past, and surprisingly I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll miss them. Oh and Borders sucks. They have no selection, and the employees are clueless. They have one million copies of the new James Patterson and that&#039;s it. You can tell they&#039;re desperate for business when they email you a coupon literally every week.Online ordering from amazon or alibris is the way to go.

				I think one of the main reasons B&amp;N hasn&#039;t opened here is that so much of Astoria is so close to a train stop that is so close to Manhattan that they figure we&#039;ll just go to Manhattan to go to a B&amp;N, although that wouldn&#039;t explain why there are so many B&amp;N&#039;s <em>in</em> Manhattan....<br /><br />Well, as the years go by and I get more and more injured, I just forget there <em>are</em> stores and shop online, but has anybody ever contacted B&amp;N and asked <span class="bbc_u">them</span> why they don&#039;t open a store here?

				Wow, I can&#039;t believe I missed this before. <br />I work for B&amp;N Corporate, and I have actually discussed this with someone I know in our real estate department. The reason there isn&#039;t one in Astoria is mainly because of space- they have explored the possibility numerous times. <br />The real estate price to potential profit ratio is apparently too narrow to justify opening a B&amp;N store here. We just closed our Astor Place location and our Chelsea location is closing at the end of the month, but we did open up our new Tribeca Store(Come on by, it&#039;s gorgeous). Despite these closures, business is actually doing great, but NYC real estate is so absurd these days that margins get ridiculously narrow when you talk about opening up the type of square footage a Barnes &amp; Noble needs to open. <br />Believe me, I would be a huge proponent of having a B&amp;N in Astoria, and I&#039;m sure if a space that made financial sense were to open up, our real estate department would jump on it in a second.

				Well Casicua, you must be our guy.&nbsp; Thanks for that info.&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine that astoria real estate is more costly than Manhattan (although I know it is quite costly) and you seem to be opening various other stores in Manhattan, so I guess my question would be how you determine the &quot;potential profit&quot; of a particular location.

To the best of my knowledge, part of our new store process involves an entire group of people who&#039;s job it is to research the potential local market, trends, size, foot traffic, etc. So after all that is done, they compare it to the lease terms, calculate if it makes sense to open, and 9 months later, the B&amp;N Stork comes by and drops a store off. (Or something like that)<br /><br />*Edit- And to touch on your point about Manhattan, we have actually closed 2 and opened 1 in Manhattan within the past 6 months, if that is indicative of the real estate issues. And Astoria is most likely not more expensive than Manhattan, but the comparative foot traffic it drives is probably also substantially less.

				Well, B&amp;N&nbsp; (and mets) guy says it&#039;s a no go- how about exploring a different option? B&amp;N is not the only bookstore in the universe...or even in NYC.<br />Did I mention that when I was a kid the landlord told my old boss that as a policy that particular landlord will not lease to bookstores? (The old boss told me she owns a lot of property in the hood...)<br />Maybe this issue is best taken up with the Steinway BID- or LIC BID or whatever similar body exists.<br />If they (landlords) won&#039;t lease the space- the retailer doesn&#039;t have much in the way of options.

				There&#039;s a store for rent on Ditmars right next to the soon to be new Payless.&nbsp; It&#039;s a great size for a new independent bookstore, or a Shakespeare and Company.&nbsp; Come on, somebody.&nbsp; Open one up if you are so inclined.<br />
