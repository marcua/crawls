				Thanks, guys. I am glad the events of last month figured in your calculations. And, um, Eric, putting the poor folks out of sight a half mile away is racism in anyone&#39;s book.<br /><br />--------------<br /><br /><br />http://www.nysun.com/article/37990?access=486062<br /><br />About as big in total space as the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle, Silvercup West is one of several huge development projects now planned across the five boroughs. <br /><br />Developers Alan and Stuart Suna are seeking to build three towers with 2.7 million square feet of studio, office, and residential space on the East River waterfront, just south of the Queensboro Bridge<br /><br />Following community concerns that the development would be a rich, gated-community, the city&#39;s Planning Commission and the local City Council member, Eric Gioia, brokered a deal earlier this summer with the developers to add 150 units of affordable housing, to be located within a half-mile of the site.<br /><br />A senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute who specializes in development, Julia Vitullo-Martin, said part of Long Island City has been &quot;like a cemetery of broken dreams.&quot; &quot;This is one of those cursed sites that looks very good and doesn&#39;t quite work. This is a huge development to put on a site that has a history of problems,&quot; Ms. Martin said. She said the project&#39;s office and residential space could come on the market at a time when demand for real estate had dropped off, and added that she worried what would happen to important low-rise neighborhoods in Western Queens if the waterfront became a wall of glass towers.<br /><br />

				Great discussion going on in another thread.<br /><br />http://www.astorians.com/index.php/topic,3151.0.html<br /><br />It seems as if the city (Bloomberg, City Council (Gioia, Vallone, etc) and City Planning) seems to have learned nothing from last month&#39;s brownout. Passing big zoning changes or issuing reports (on schemes to fit in 100,000s of new people) - to say nothing of approving fat pay raises - while everyone is on vacation is an old trick (but, I have to admit a lot cleaner than doing this at 2 AM some day in January).<br /><br />Forcing Con Ed to pay out money is a shell game. Like a landlord who gets an increase to improve your apartment, they will get a rate boost that will pay for itself many times over.<br /><br />The arrogance towards working people by the machine is evidenced not only by displacement policies (increase zoning so people sell out and move) or allocation of city resources (Con Ed spent most of its resources to new projects like Queens West while the wiring of older communities rotted away), but in beating up on Con Ed, you attack the very people that have lived (and suffered) in Astoria for years.<br /><br />You see, there are scores of Con Ed workers living here who are busy telling their neighbors the truth behind the facade. <br /><br />And stockholders? Public utilities issues have been the cornerstone of many seniors and dependent beneficiaries that depend upon income from estate trusts (who again, live right here in Astoria). <br /><br />So go ahead, beat up on them. You run the risk of not only creating a credibility gap, but push Astoria towards other working class communities (like Richmond Hill or Middle Village) that are starting to lose faith in &#39;the system.&#39;<br /><br />Its funny how no one has yet commented on the campaign contributions by Con Ed, or the wasted time frittered away while Con Ed and the politicians played baseball. <br /><br />Think of the missed opportunities that could have been used to inform the community of impending danger, and to go after Con Ed for a weakened power grid that they now tell us was a problem that everyone (except the people) knew about.<br /><br />Think of the mysterious gap of first three days that the politicians and community boards were MIA while their community burned around them.<br /><br />Yes, I agree. They deserve a 25% raise.

				Almost sounds like the harmonious chorus of elected officials: 25% pay raise: aye! Silvercup private landgrab: aye! Tens of thousands of new apartments thrown on a collapsing infrastructure: aye! aye! and aye!<br /><br />The Taminent Trio staring Eric, Peter, and Michael. Voting at a caucus near you!<br /><br />------------------------<br /><br />And yes, my good friend, taking a shower in cold water, sleeping without a fan or a/c during a heatwave and watching my community bleed because someone made some bonehead choices and hid the facts from the public does make me forceful and passionate about things.<br /><br />So Jonathan, lets work together, and start to ask some tuff questions. I have a bad feeling that we have not seen the last of these problems. <br /><br />Serious comments to the points raised, anyone?

				Just as a matter of fact - while both Peter Vallone, Jr. and Michael Gianaris are both out of the Taminent Democratic Club, Eric Gioia is not. &nbsp;Eric, if you remember, ran against the Queens Machine (they backed the late Matt Farrell for City Council). &nbsp;I could be wrong, but I don&#39;t think Eric is out of any Democratic club.<br />Ditto to everything Jonathan said.

				well...you are right, we are a we ... lots of we&#39;s. This &#39;we&#39; is from this month&#39;s Juniper Berry. <br /><br />Now which one of you brave souls would like to take on our good friend, &#39;Mary,&#39; one of &#39;us?&#39;<br /><br />------------------------------<br /><br />GOODBYE, WATERFRONT<br /><br />Dear Editor,<br /><br />I am writing to you to tell you that I wish we had a civic association and magazine like yours here in Long Island City.&nbsp; If we did, perhaps we wouldn&#39;t be bombarded right now with high-rises that will crowd us - and price us - out of the neighborhood many of our families have called home for generations.&nbsp; Over time, we had formed a quiet, tight-knit community of people who knew each other on a first name basis.&nbsp; We enjoyed our little blue-collar enclave just a stone&#39;s throw from the waterfront, and liked the fact that we were always a mere subway stop away from the excitement of the &quot;city.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Now our lifestyle is threatened by looming towers and big money being forced upon us by the powers that be.&nbsp; First, it was the monstrous and out-of-character Citicorp Tower, followed a decade later by the beginnings of Queens West.&nbsp; The current wave of development is threatening to further destroy the area.&nbsp; We aren&#39;t chic, but we currently own the &quot;view.&quot;&nbsp; While other areas of Queens are being downzoned, we are being upzoned.&nbsp; After the first skyscrapers are built, others will be have to be built taller in order to cash in on the view.&nbsp; Doesn&#39;t the middle class deserve to enjoy the view, too?<br /><br />Unfortunately, we will always lose out to those with the big bucks, especially when we are governed by a mayor who is a billionaire developer from Boston, and a city council representative, Eric Gioia, who made his family&#39;s working class Woodside roots his central campaign theme (&quot;from the neighborhood, for the neighborhood&quot;), yet after being elected, quickly high-tailed it to a luxury waterfront condo at CitiLights in order to better position himself for higher office.&nbsp; Both of them had electrical power in August.&nbsp; We didn&#39;t.&nbsp; But that&#39;s ok, the Mayor sent us &quot;community assistance&quot; in the form of one Matthew Gorton, who couldn&#39;t seem to answer any of our questions or find a way to help us out, and basically just hung around and watched while we stood on line for ice.&nbsp; Then, a melodramatic Gioia made a public display of anger at Con Ed in order to deflect attention away from his promotion of SilverCup West, which will drain even more power from the unstable grid, but give millionaires nice looks at midtown.&nbsp; What a way to go!&nbsp; The legacies of these men are shaping up nicely.&nbsp; <br /><br />JPCA, please keep fighting for your communities.&nbsp; It looks like the working people of LIC may soon end up there.<br /><br />Mary [mod]<br /><br />Long Island City<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I myself don&#39;t mind having &quot;them&quot;&nbsp; :wink: around.&nbsp; &nbsp;They take some of the heat off of me when I say/post stupid things from time to time.<br /><br />And as far as the waterfront goes in LIC....&nbsp; &nbsp;I like the buildings that they&#39;re putting up.&nbsp; Yeah, I guess it&#39;s a shame for the scattered old houses that are hanging on in a neighborhood that in my perception is mostly an industrial eyesore.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sorry if your &#39;view&#39; is being compromise but I believe the word is um...&nbsp; progress.&nbsp; It could be worse... they could be wasting more prime real estate on projects and low-income housing.<br /><br />I quote the very smart and logical Mr Spock...&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The needs of the many, outweigh the needs of the few, so bite me&quot;<br /><br />Ok, I added that last part.&nbsp; It&#39;s ok, I wasn&#39;t expecting an intelligent response anyways, so why not have a little fun.<br /><br />and finally...&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;...have you noticed that an angry man can only get so far.&nbsp; Until he reconciles the way he thinks things aught to be, to the way things are&quot;&nbsp; -Don Henley<br /><br />

				Just a question - where is Juniper Park? &nbsp;Isn&#39;t it somewhere in South Central Queens? &nbsp;Why is a person living in LIC reading local community papers and writing letters for another neighborhood? &nbsp;Is the Juniper Berry a community newspaper or a local newsletter (for a civic association?) &nbsp;<br />The entire thing just strikes me as a bit odd - I think an equivalent would be me reading local papers or newsletters for community groups for either Flushing or Kew Gardens and writing a letter in. &nbsp;Not to say it doesn&#39;t happen, but it strikes me as a bit unusual.

				What is so odd about Hunters Point talking to Middle Village? Astoria has an impact on other neighborhoods. Our manic overdevelopment becomes Woodhaven&#39;s tax bill, and Sunnyside&#39;s traffic jam. So yes, they care deeply what we are doing here.<br /><br />That is why groups all around the city are starting to talk to each other and share info (thank god for the internet). After all, the political system is monothlic. Ozone Park, the Rockaways, Ratnerville, Red Hook, the Village, West Side? Same tent, just a different circus <br /><br />Astoria has quite the little reputation around town, with tearing down 180 year old buildings and putting up, well what shall we call some of these things? Its been said many times before, you guys gotta get out of the neighborhood and see what&#39;s going on around the rest of the city. A big fish in a small pond becomes a minnow in the great sea. Might give you a little perspective and the broader picture. Be happy to introduce you around town.<br /><br />Now some of you newcomers thinking its perfectly ok to bulldoze someone else&#39;s neighborhood after they have lived there for decades? Tisk, tisk, that&#39;s poor form. And something that urban planners stopped doing before many of you were perhaps even born. Love to have you speak face-to-face with those whose homes you think should be leveled. <br /><br />The old gods are dead. There are new ideas being batted around ... i don&#39;t not agree with all of them, and nor should you. But the closed world of Astoria is one of the last places to feel the winds of change. Hate to break the news, but some of these ideas are going to be a permanent part of the picture around the community going forward.<br /><br />As to the hate, and finger and cussing, can&#39;t do much there, You don&#39;t get me upset, I just feel sad. When the developers and landlords were being attacked in another thread, I believe mern instituted some board guidelines. But again, that was perhaps for developers and landlords.<br /><br />When you have calmed down, lets get back to the issues. They ain&#39;t going away and you know, I think most of you would like to examine them. And perhaps give the other 1000 members of this little community (including myself) a chance to learn something.<br /><br />The greater the island of knowledge, the longer the shores of ignorance, they say.<br /><br />Go ahead, challenge the points raised. You learn nothing from &#39;yes&#39; men and a fantastic amount from those who disagree with you. Hell, what we have sent you is only the tip of the iceberg. <br /><br />

				South Central Queens, mcdirk?&nbsp; &nbsp; :?&nbsp; Juniper Park is in Middle Village.&nbsp; The Juniper Park Civic Association represents that area and Maspeth, which is right next door to good old LIC.&nbsp; Membership in the organization and readership of our magazine does extend into other areas of Queens, however.&nbsp; <br /><br />Part of the reason that the civic has generally been successful in our battles is because we are in tune with what is happening in other neighborhoods and put the kibosh on problems before they make their inevitable way here.&nbsp; So when you see Maspeth Maverick taking an interest in the goings on in Astoria or Long Island City, you shouldn&#39;t be puzzled.&nbsp; It makes perfect sense.&nbsp; I am also a member of the Greater Astoria Historical Society and Long Island City Alliance, although I live in Maspeth.&nbsp; It&#39;s a shame that certain folk want to isolate themselves and pretend that there are no other communities in Queens besides their own.&nbsp; We could do a lot more for Queens if we shared info and united instead of ripping each other apart on an internet bulletin board.<br /><br />Many of the industrial buildings down by the LIC waterfront are quite historical, and the neighborhood is one of the last true waterfront communities.&nbsp; Waterfront communities generally were comprised of both housing and industry.&nbsp; Now it will just be high-rises.&nbsp; Talk about urban blight...

				Well, this thread has made it around the city a few times. The vulgar comments has no effect on me, but does make things embarrassing for the community, if my morning emails from my colleagues around town can be believed. <br /><br />I have dismissed their jabs, as your comments, and defended this board as being potentially a very, very, important part of Astoria. <br /><br />The fact that a handful of posters (from what I have heard - yes I get secret IMs too) may have their own reasons to keep some ideas from the rest of the community. By attacking the person, you can divert attention away from their ideas. By substituting others, the conversation can go in nice controlled directions.<br /><br />This was fully expected. New ideas have almost always been greeted by the pitchfork and burning torch crowd - or the anger of those with their own personal agendas that might be in jeopardy.<br /><br />I have been involved with urban issues for decades and have been blessed with a wonderful network of contacts. Several weeks ago I interviewed a Con Ed manhole worker that revealed some eye opening facts - which you may be interested in hearing. A few days ago, I chatted with a Con Ed person who mailed many of your refund checks (and has personal insight on that Con Ed chairman that would make even my friend Jonathan roll with laughter.)<br /><br />Things just need time to soak. <br /><br />Be assured, as long as the following appears in my in basket no one is going anywhere. <br /><br />Get used to it.<br /><br />------------<br /><br />Letter from Woodside (um dirk, its next to Astoria, but still in western Queens)<br /><br />I live in Woodside.&nbsp; Let me tell you a little bit about my commute.&nbsp; Currently, I wait 10-15 minutes for a bus to take me to the subway.&nbsp; When the bus arrives, many times it is too crowded to board.&nbsp; So, I have to wait another 10-15 minutes for the next bus.&nbsp; If I am lucky enough to squeeze onto that one, I end up in Long Island City waiting with a bunch of other poor saps for a train which usually arrives packed like a string of sardine cans - meaning that I have to let a train or two go by before I can take one to get to work in Manhattan.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is stressful, exhausting, and affects my quality of life.&nbsp; Apparently, no one at city hall understands these problems, because instead of talking about fixing what already doesn&#39;t work, they are excitedly planning to pile tens of thousands more people along the train route.&nbsp; I am all for &quot;affordable&quot; housing, however I will no longer be able to afford my own house if I can&#39;t make it to work on time.&nbsp; Dumping more people into an already overpopulated area and forcing our poorly run transit system to absorb the impact will be an utter disaster.&nbsp; <br /><br />Where will the children of my new neighbors go to school?&nbsp; Western Queens school districts are already among the most overcrowded in the city, and our area&#39;s Catholic schools are closing.&nbsp; Will fire, police, emergency services and utilities be able to provide service to all the new arrivals?&nbsp; Who decided that this was a good idea?&nbsp; Certainly not the people.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was at the meeting at St. Mary&#39;s where the plan was discussed, and not one resident of the area thought it was a smart one.&nbsp; The bureaucrats seem to think they know better than us, though, so it will be done.&nbsp; They are supposed to be representing us, not making deals with the devil.&nbsp; <br /><br />While the Mayor and City Council are busy playing SimCity, the people who live here are the ones who are suffering.&nbsp; Neighborhoods where constituents can outspend the real estate industry in political contributions don&#39;t have to worry about rampant overbuilding ruining their lives.&nbsp; <br /><br />So much for looking out for the little people.<br /><br />Joanna [mod]<br />Woodside<br /><br /><br />

I also retract what I said about its nonsensical ramblings because obviously people from Woodside write it e-mails. Also, I am thankful that it validated this board. In an effort to emulate this upstanding quasi-citizen, I too will assume duplicitous identities, pretending I am two different users on an otherwise benign and beneficial board, to warp discussions into my own personal vision of irrelevant and narrow development issues by posting self-righteous and condescending monologues.

				Where to begin?&nbsp; First, MaspethMaverick - I like your website.&nbsp; It sounds like the Juniper Park Civic Association does good work and that&#39;s very commendable.&nbsp; I know I&#39;ve heard of Maspeth, but wasn&#39;t certain where it was.&nbsp; I found this nifty map (posted below) that shows the neighborhoods of Queens.&nbsp; I do concede that Maspeth is in Western Queens, but this map shows it bordering Woodside, not LIC.&nbsp; Of course, this map also combines Astoria and LIC and has Northern Astoria as the Ditmars/Steinway area.&nbsp; I&#39;ve driven to Middle Village, which abuts Maspeth and it&#39;s a 25-30 minute drive, traffic permitting, not really what I would call close, but definitely closer than Forest Hills.&nbsp; I still find it interesting that folks in Maspeth would get involved in Astoria, but then again, I’ve been involved in fights in the Village (both East and West), so maybe it’s not so strange.&nbsp; I would be interested in hearing what the catchment area is for the Greater Astoria Historical Society is, and what the catchment area is for LICA?&nbsp; Is it just Astoria or more expansive?<br /><br />I definitely agree that the subways need to be improved, and should be running more often, both on the N/W, but also the R and 7 lines.&nbsp; I wish they&#39;d figure out what to do with the G - it really seems to get short shrift.&nbsp; <br /><br />I wouldn&#39;t characterize myself as only wanting to isolate myself or pretending that other parts of Queens don&#39;t exist.&nbsp; I go to Woodside, Jackson Heights and Flushing regularly.&nbsp; I get to other parts of Queens much less often.&nbsp; I do, however, follow what is happening in communities throughout the city through the blogosphere and local community papers, though I tend to focus more on the local politics than development issues (just my area of interest).&nbsp; While there are similarities between many neighborhoods, each neighborhood has issues and a dynamic that is particular to itself.&nbsp; <br /><br />For myself, I don&#39;t see overdevelopment happening in Astoria, at least not yet.&nbsp; I see mainly in-fill development, building on vacant lots.&nbsp; I don&#39;t even see that many buildings being torn down, not like they do in Bayside or Staten Island.&nbsp; LIC is a different story entirely, but this is Astorians.com not LIC.com and I, personally, don&#39;t get involved in LIC issues (the Hunters Point area on this map).&nbsp; I walk along the Astoria waterfront sometimes and have been over to the water a number of times this Summer.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t seen any buildings going up along the water in Astoria, though there are some new construction projects a few blocks inland.&nbsp; I think the highrises to which you are referring are in LIC.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#39;ve seen the postings about LICA on the board, and had actually been interested in them at one point, but the entire approach about beating us all up over attending LICA meetings, trying to force discussion of “over-development” in multiple threads (including ones about allergies – I’m still waiting to see over-development brought up in a food thread)&nbsp; and trying to hijack the community response to hate crimes made me uncomfortable.&nbsp; As such, I haven&#39;t checked them out.&nbsp; Their website is interesting, but the approach by the &quot;anti-development&quot; (for lack of a better term) folks on Astorians.com hasn&#39;t made me more interested, it&#39;s actually made me less inclined to check them out.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the result that LICA is seeking.&nbsp; The constant snide remarks, personal attacks, belligerence towards seemingly all of our local elected officials and even other local community groups, just seems really weird.&nbsp; I guess I just don’t understand what people are trying to accomplish by this sort of behavior.&nbsp; It’s really rather off-putting. <br /><br /><br />[attachment deleted by admin]

				well, mcdirk, there is a tincture of truth in what you deliever but it has a disingenious spin that would make Rove blush. <br /><br />Those folks at LICA, as I recalled, did not hijack your anti-bias stuff , but actually put a link into the Astorians site for further information. They got on the bandwagon to add to what you were doing in SAFE because they must have believed it a worthy cause. As I recall, Jonathan&#39;s wife Jennifer attended a LICA meeting as was quite pleased with the info, and the action packet was down loaded and used by your group in that first meeting (also recall the SAFE minutes were never posted, but thats another issue) Its funny how memory can have holes in it, eh?<br /><br />I cannot speak for LICA, but suggest you contact them. You might be surprised. They represent the working class people that have lived here for a long time (and no, if anyone thinks they can be displaced en mass they have a big surprise) as well as newer transplants like many within your group. They have links across the entire city. Your two groups would be natural allies.<br /><br />As to the waterfront development in ASTORIA, well the community board has approved a number of 20 story buildings right next to the power plant. And the Sohmer piano factory, oh well, he he he. All this boldly reported in the press during the past year. Again, memory issues my friend?<br /><br />Your lack of knowledge of the broader landscape of queens is not at all surprising, as it is almost 40% of NYC: about the size of Chicago. It is huge and took me years to cross it and visit its neighborhoods. Many of the issues we brought up came from decades of experience around the city - perhaps issues that many on this board who are new to the community do not yet grasp. And that is understandable,too. Its ok. <br /><br />Things (and new ideas) take time.<br /><br />And as to the politicians, well, we are their best friends for we keep them on their toes. They lead a tough life, believe me. No one I know is planning to run against them. That being said, I do not know one person who is entirely satisfied with the way things are handled last month.<br /><br />Yes, debate can be passionate, but I am just a passionate to others about your freedom to criticise (and insult) everything that I say. Indeed, the amusing childish antics by some of the posters aside (which are for the most part, funny), I stand to learn a hell of a lot more about issues when people disagree than looking at a room full of nodding cyphers. <br /><br />People have told me your name is respected in some quarters. Would love to debate with you here on development issues. We may be in completely separate camps on things, but that should not stop intelligent people from doing some good.<br /><br />(tele, would you stop that #$%^#* snoring?)

				WAIT, I see the problem. &nbsp; Gleasonboy, &nbsp;did you know that this board is not a civic association, development group or political action forum? &nbsp;<br /><br />Did you know that its a place for people to meet, go to fun events, talk about anything and just have a good time? &nbsp;We are not here for anything else. &nbsp;If you wish to start one go right ahead but stop creating your little fantasy world on this board. &nbsp;If you wish to converse with people then converse do not blabber and repeat repeat repeat yourself.<br /><br />At this point i&#39;d like to see more condos and high rises because we could get more people out here to Astoria, make it a better place and oh hey, maybe a nuclear power plant to replace the old con ed plant on the northern tip of Astoria. &nbsp;And ya know what? &nbsp;We live in Astoria not Maspeth, Elmhurst or Rego park. &nbsp;So stick to the program.<br /><br />If you showed up at just one event, tapped me on the shoulder and said hello in a friendly manner, I would sit right down and really enjoy a conversation with you on any of these topics. But the way you always approach it can be so crazed and psychotic, who wants to deal with you?<br /><br />Ive wasted my time hear for sure but it felt good to say it.<br /><br />And i&#39;m voting for Silvercup west.

				Or here&#39;s one for ya...<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Some Bouillabaisse History<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The most famous fish stew of the Mediterranean is bouillabaisse, and its home is considered to be Marseilles, although it is made in every little port throughout the coastal regions of Provence. The apocryphal story of the origin of bouillabaisse that is popularly told by the Marseillais is that Venus served bouillabaisse to her husband, Vulcan, to lull him to sleep while she consorted with Mars. Greek food writers have laid claim to inventing the precursor of bouillabaisse. They argue that when the Phocaeans, Greeks from Asia Minor, founded Marseilles in about 600 B.C. they brought with them a fish soup known as kakavia that was the basis to the future bouillabaisse. This can be said to be true only in the most general (and meaningless) sense. In fact, we have no idea whether such a soup was &quot;brought&quot; to the western Mediterranean. In the culinary writings of the ancient Greeks, especially as represented by Athenaeus (A.D. 170-230), there are many mentions of boiled fish, cooked in unspecified ways, as well as one fish stew made with grayfish, herbs, oil, caraway seeds, and salt. The most likely precursor to the Provençal bouillabaisse is likely to be an Italian fish stew and, in fact, the closest thing to a bouillabaisse that I have found in a medieval text is the brodecto de li dicti pisci that appears in an anonymous fifteenth-century Italian cookery book from southern Italy where sardines and anchovies are boiled in vino greco (a strong Neapolitan wine) with black pepper, saffron, and sugar with a little olive oil. There is also the matellotte du poisson recipe found in Jourdain Le Cointe&#39;s La cuisine de santé published in 1790 that Alan Davidson, author of Oxford Companion to Food believes is a relevant precursor.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The most distinguishing characteristic of a bouillabaisse is not the fish, because all fish stews and soups have fish, but the unique flavoring derived from saffron, fennel seeds, and orange zest. A famous Provençal food writer, Jean-Noël Escudier, called bouillabaisse the &quot;magical synthesis.&quot; Another famous French epicure, Curnonsky, called it soupe d&#39;or, soup of gold. The origin of the word bouillabaisse has been attributed to the abbess of a Marseilles convent (a pun on bouille-abbesse, the abbess&#39; boil?) and, most credibly, to bouillon abaissé &quot;to reduce by evaporation.&quot; One of the earliest uses of the word bouillabaisse was in the 1830s as a term expressing the rapidity of the cooking. Stendhal mentioned bouille-à-baisses, perhaps referring to a fish stew, in his travels from 1806. But the famous French chef Raymond Oliver, writing in the Gastronomy of France, makes some extraordinary claims about bouillabaisse. He tells us that it is first mentioned in a dictionary from 1785, that its heritage is Phoenician via Greek Sicily, and that the rules for the making of bouillabaisse were laid down in the sixteenth century. None of this is supported by any evidence but in any case, I agree with his estimation that in &#39;bouillabaisse&#39;..., it is essential to retain all the delicacy of the fish and never to debase through too much zeal a symphony of tastes which is so hard to achieve.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Strong opinions about the proper bouillabaisse are typical from its proponents such as the French writer and gourmet August de Croze who said it is a culinary heresy to use white wine in a bouillabaisse because wine only changes the nature of the fish. Others, including myself, disagree; it is natural. But I agree with everything else he has to say: live fish in great variety, good olive oil, saffron, and furiously boiling water (the most critical step) are all essential for a successful bouillabaisse. So how did bouillabaisse originate? My guess is that, given all the hallmarks, it was the invention of a nineteenth-century restaurateur of Marseilles. Because of its expense it most certainly was not an invention of the fishermen.

				Vichyssoise<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The finest of all cold soups - and the very best thing invented in the USA! This wonderful, smooth soup can be garnished with a very few finely chopped chives. The chef at the Algonquin (where the soup originated) now sprinkles a very little curry powder, and provided it is a VERY little this can be very pleasant. Enjoy.&quot;<br />Original recipe yield: 4 - 6 servings.<br /><br />Servings:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 5 (change)<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * 2 leeks, chopped<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * 1 onion, chopped<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * 2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * 3/4 cup thinly sliced potatoes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * 2 1/3 cups chicken stock<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * salt to taste<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * ground black pepper to taste<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * 1 1/8 cups heavy whipping cream<br /><br />DIRECTIONS:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Gently sweat the chopped leeks and the chopped onion in butter or margarine until soft, about 8 minutes. Do NOT let them brown.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Add potatoes and stock to the saucepan. Salt and pepper to taste; do not overdo them! Bring to the boil, and simmer very gently for 30 minutes.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Puree in a blender or food processor until very smooth. Cool.

				I like these recipes.&nbsp; I still want links and letters attesting that food processors are a good thing, though.<br /><br />FYI - from SFGate.com.....<br /><br />Food fight <br />Editor -- Calling breakfasts &quot;nutritious&quot; rather than &quot;fresh&quot; -- so food processors can substitute canned, frozen and dried fruit for the real thing -- is a bit like the Bush administration calling its environmental policies &quot;clean air&quot; and &quot;clean water.&quot; <br /><br />The result for the breakfast bill is a boon to agribusiness at the expense of California&#39;s children. Fresh produce is nutritious. Canned is not. Premium fruit is culled from orchards to sell, and the rejects are cycled off to the cannery. There, the enzymes necessary for digestion are destroyed by boiling. The fruit also suffers loss of fiber and vitamins, while retaining the pesticides. <br /><br />Finally, sugar and sometimes coloring, enhancers and preservatives are added to the mix to disguise unpleasant flavors from sub-par fruit. The metal can reacts chemically with acids naturally present in the fruit. It will eventually find its way into the brain, nervous system and other organs. Lead used to solder the seam will leach into the syrup and be consumed with the fruit. The organ of highest concentration for this metal is also the brain. Amazing what our tax dollars can do to help the next generation struggling to develop sound mind and body. <br /><br /><br />MADOLIN<br />Oakland

				And another good recipe:<br /><br />TURDUCKEN<br /><br />Brine: <br />1 cup kosher salt <br />1 cup brown sugar <br />1 gallon water<br />18 to 21-pound turkey, skin intact and boned except for drumsticks <br />House seasoning, recipe follows <br />Cornbread Dressing, recipe follows <br />3 to 4-pound duck, boned <br />3 to 4-pound chicken, boned <br />Paprika<br /><br />To make the brine: Mix salt and sugar with the water. Brine is ready when the mixture is completely dissolved. If the water is heated to quicken the process, make sure it is cooled to room temperature before placing meat in. Let the 3 birds sit in brine in the refrigerator overnight.<br />Preheat roaster to 500 degrees F.<br /><br />Lay turkey skin side down on a flat surface. Dust turkey with House Seasoning and add 1/4-inch layer of cornbread dressing. Lay duck skin side down on top of dressing. Dust duck with House Seasoning and add 1/4-inch layer of dressing. Repeat with the chicken.<br /><br />Begin trussing up the turkey at the neck. Insert metal skewer about 1/2-inch from the edge and up through the other side. Run butcher&#39;s twine between skin and skewer and tighten to draw both sides together. Continue down to legs. With every other skewer, draw together the duck and chicken skin. Tie together turkey legs to resemble standard turkey. Dust turkey skin with paprika.<br /><br />Roast turducken for 15 minutes. Then turn the roaster down to 225 degrees F to finish, approximately 3 hours. Remove turducken from roaster once the internal temperature in the chicken reaches 155 degrees F. Let rest for at least 20 minutes before carving.<br /><br />Cut across the middle of the breast completely through. Plate thin slices containing turkey, duck and chicken.<br /><br />Cook&#39;s Notes: If using a smoker to cook, smoke at 225 degrees F for 5 hours, rotating every 20 to 30 minutes until internal temperature reaches 155 degrees F and external temperature reaches 165 degrees F. Try to keep the flare-ups from the fire to a minimum.<br /><br />House Seasoning: <br />1 cup salt <br />1/4 cup black pepper <br />1/4 cup garlic powder<br />Mix ingredients together and store in an airtight container for up to 6 months.<br />Cornbread Dressing: <br />Cornbread: <br />1 cup self rising cornmeal <br />1/2 cup self-rising flour <br />3/4 cup buttermilk <br />2 eggs <br />2 tablespoons vegetable oil<br />Dressing: <br />7 slices white bread, dried in warm oven <br />Cornbread <br />1 sleeve saltine crackers <br />2 cups chopped celery <br />1 large onion, chopped <br />8 tablespoons butter <br />7 cups chicken stock <br />1 teaspoon salt <br />1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper <br />1 teaspoon dried sage <br />1 tablespoon poultry seasoning <br />5 eggs, beaten<br /><br />Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.<br />To make the cornbread, combine all ingredients and pour into a greased shallow baking dish. Bake for approximately 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool.<br /><br />To make the dressing, crumble dried white bread slices, cornbread and crackers. Mix together and set aside. Saute chopped celery and onion in butter until transparent, approximately 5 to 10 minutes. Pour over corn bread mixture. Add stock, mix well and add salt, pepper, sage, and poultry seasoning. Add beaten eggs and mix well. Follow instructions above to stuff birds.<br /><br />Yield: 8 to 10 servings

Slice the eggplant horizontally about 1/4-inch thick. Place the slices in a large colander, sprinkle with salt and set aside to rest about 30 minutes. Drain and rinse the eggplant and dry on towels.<br /><br />In a saute pan, heat the extra-virgin olive oil until just smoking. Press the drained eggplant pieces into the seasoned bread crumb mixture and saute until light golden brown on both sides. Repeat with all of the pieces. On a cookie sheet lay out the 4 largest pieces of eggplant. Place 2 tablespoons of tomato sauce over each piece and place a thin slice of mozzarella on top of each. Sprinkle with Parmigiano and top each with the next smallest piece of eggplant, then sauce then mozzarella. Repeat the layering process until all the ingredients have been used, finishing again with the Parmigiano. Place the pan in the oven and bake until the top of each little stack is golden brown and bubbly, about 15 minutes.<br />
