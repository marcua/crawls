			I thought I'd separate out the technical and start a thread to coordinate picking up the vegetables from the CSA on Tuesday afternoons.<br /><br />I can drive this afternoon. &nbsp;I'm at the office at the moment, but I think I can make it between 4 and 5 to FP. &nbsp;I'll have a more accurate idea of time in about an hour.

			<strong>RavenswoodCSA</strong>:
			<br />
			Guys, <br /><br />I figured I'd post some of the info for the CSA here, since I don't know that I have an accurate mailing list going right now. &nbsp;So here are snippets from my last email...<br /><br />An email from Emily Maxwell is included at the end of<br />this email. &nbsp;She is holding a Partnership for Parks<br />meeting tonight to talk about a shoreline clean-up in<br />Astoria and LIC. &nbsp;Partnerships does a great job and<br />everyone I've meet at their meetings is fantastic. <br />I'm unable to attend the meeting tonight, but am<br />planning to do the clean-up on the 17th. &nbsp;If you live<br />in LIC/Astoria, you should come out for that and, if<br />you're not already booked, go to the meeting tonight. <br /><br /><br />On to CSA business, we're having a meeting on the 30th<br />of September, so mark your calenders. &nbsp;It's a Friday<br />night at 6:30 at Tara's house. &nbsp;Tara lives on 23rd<br />Street and 31st. Ave, so it should be a short jaunt<br />for lots of you. &nbsp; We need to talk about where to move<br />the CSA distribution for next season. &nbsp;I will be<br />coming with ideas and hope that you will have some,<br />too. &nbsp;Think about your local spots... community<br />centers, churches, not-for-profits, schools. &nbsp;We can<br />approach anyone about hosting our distributions, so<br />don't be afraid to throw out ALL ideas. &nbsp;Let Tara<br />(dramaqueen20@yahoo.com) and I know if you are coming<br />and contact Tara for specific questions about how to<br />find her apartment. &nbsp;She has been very kind to offer<br />her apartment for this meeting.<br /><br />On the topic of events, I'd like to have a potluck<br />dinner... we can do it in the Ravenswood Community<br />Center where our first meeting was, although it's kind<br />of drab, and we'd have to do it during the week. &nbsp;We<br />can have it in my backyard, although it's in Brooklyn.<br />&nbsp;If we're doing it at my house, I'm thinking of the<br />24th of September, a Saturday night. &nbsp;<br /><br />As mentioned in an older newsletter, The New York<br />premier of Deborah Koons Garcia’s film, The Future of<br />Food will be held at the Film Forum on September 14th.<br />&nbsp;“Shot on location in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, THE<br />FUTURE OF FOOD examines the complex web of market and<br />political forces that are changing what we eat as huge<br />multinational corporations seek to control the world's<br />food system. The film also explores alternatives to<br />large-scale industrial agriculture, placing organic<br />and sustainable agriculture as real solutions to the<br />farm crisis today.” &nbsp;One of our members has seen this<br />and said it was great. &nbsp;I'm planning to go, so if you<br />want to have a date with Cara, drop me a line. &nbsp;<br /><br />And Just Food is Calling All Food Enthusiasts! &nbsp;Do you<br />LOVE to cook? &nbsp;Do you or someone you know want to<br />support CSA? &nbsp;Just Food has an opportunity for you as<br />a volunteer Community Food Educator! &nbsp;If you or<br />someone you know would like to facilitate Food<br />Education Workshops at a CSA please contact Elizabeth<br />by email at elizabeth@justfood.org or by phone at<br />212-645-9880 ext 230 to receive an application. <br />Training will last three days. &nbsp;The dates are, Tuesday<br />September 20th, Wednesday September 21th and Friday<br />September 23rd from 6:30 to 8:30 PM at 210 East 51st<br />Street at 3rd avenue. &nbsp;After training, Just Food<br />requires a minimum of 6 workshops from September to<br />November. &nbsp;---- Liz, our cooking demonstrator, came to<br />us via this program. &nbsp;It's a great time.<br /><br />Question? &nbsp;Email, call or post me.
