				A couple of years ago I mentioned that it was my intention to play all the games of Freecell in almost chronological order.&nbsp; What I do is, for every 10 games, I play the game that ends in a 0, then the preceding game that ends in 1, and play the eight other games in between in any order.&nbsp; To keep track of what I&#039;ve played I use an Excel grid, since the left side of the grid has numbers in consecutive order, starting with 1 and presumably going to infinity.&nbsp; I only need it to go to 1,000,000.&nbsp; Originally I decorated the grid with symbols representing the 4 card suits - hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades, in their proper colors, and used a martini glass symbol as a marker next to the actual game numbers that I played (and won).&nbsp; I kept this grid open as a background for the game as I played it.&nbsp; After a while I started making the symbols other colors, and later started making the whole grid a color.&nbsp; (The grid by itself is not considered to have a color.&nbsp; Making it white is different from leaving it &quot;unfilled&quot;.)&nbsp; Every 50 games I change the grid color, and/or the symbol colors.&nbsp; This summer, in sweet remembrance of having seen the Monkees twice, at the Beacon Theater and outdoors at Coney Island, I started making the grid black, representing the darkened theater/night sky, and using red hearts, representing the 6 hearts in their guitar logo, to mark the played games.&nbsp; Often I use a mix of the martini glass and the heart icons to mark the played games, and now, in addition to red hearts I use a psychedelic mix of heart colors.&nbsp; Groovy.&nbsp; The Wikipedia says there are 8 known unsolvable games in the Windows XP 1,000,000 Freecell version.&nbsp; So far I have encountered 2 games that I spent so much time on I had to make a note to come back to and move on in my efforts.&nbsp; I have seen reference to one of the them that confirms it <em>is</em> winnable.&nbsp; Currently I am in the 6500&#039;s, and my grid look like this:<br /><br /><br />(http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll138/Starwind51/Original%20Artwork/AllThePrettyColors.jpg)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
