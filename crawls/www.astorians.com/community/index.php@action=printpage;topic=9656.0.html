				And it&#039;s only the beginning Frappe.&nbsp; Things have been in the works for a while.&nbsp; This is an article from last year that has some info on what&#039;s to come:<br />http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/18/realestate/commercial/18sqft.html<br /><br />Not sure of the exact street but just off of Northern Blvd when you are approaching the 59th Streeet bridge, a low budget hotel went up and another is in construction which is only a block away.&nbsp; In the same area, over by Queens Plaza, they recently leveled an old bank and I have a heard that a hotel is going in there as well.&nbsp;

				Hardly the first tall building to be built in that area in the last couple years.... Will this one take out any classic old housing stock or something? Or is it just replacing an old warehouse or taxi lot?<br /><br />NYC desperately needs more hotels!

				That&#039;s a good article AJTNYC.&nbsp; I knew that south of the bridge was getting hot and now its northside&#039;s turn.<br /><br />39th Avenue was so lovely because it was so empty.&nbsp; So little traffic you can hear the wind whipping around.&nbsp; Last summer kids were playing ball in the street.&nbsp; Now with the two towers going up, that ain&#039;t happening anymore.&nbsp; Progress is inevitable, but it doesn&#039;t mean I have to like it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Even more that is this construction is my new neighbor.&nbsp; They are trying to cut a deal with my landlord to temporarily dump the foundation diggings in my landlord&#039;s backyard (which is mine, since he lives out of town and thats a whole &#039;nother story).&nbsp; Even if I can dodge that bullet, I have a year of noise, mice and vermin which will make the yard unusable.&nbsp; I should ask for a rent reduction.<br /><br />Harlan, it is replacing a two family house, a taxi lot and a garage.&nbsp; Aside from that big tower, on 29th street, 39th Avenue does not have any tall buildings.&nbsp; It seems very inappropriate for the neighborhood.

				It&#039;s definitely only the beginning.&nbsp; See this article today in the Daily News.&nbsp; The big power plant is up for sale.&nbsp; There&#039;s no doubt the area between the Queensbridge Houses and the Astoria Houses will evolve.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.nydailynews.com/services/realestate/2008/02/29/2008-02-29_a_power_plant_homes_and_industry_share_v.html

				Thanks for the article TJT.&nbsp; Iv&#039;e been toying with the idea of buying a place in LIC.&nbsp; It seems like it would be a great investment but there is so much going on over there it makes my head spin.&nbsp;

				Are they really going to get spill over from Manhattan in Queens for a hotel?&nbsp; It just doesn&#039;t seem likely to me.

				the thinking is that tourists on a budget might choose LIC.&nbsp; it really is very close to midtown.&nbsp; better than Brooklyn or Jersey for getting in quick to the heart of the business and shopping district.&nbsp; also corporate travelers who&#039;s companies are looking to save a buck in a tight economy.&nbsp; better to post a temp worker from out of town in LIC than at a much higher rate in midtown.&nbsp; but these hotels need to be somewhat upscale and safe or it won&#039;t happen.&nbsp; i think they will.&nbsp; apparently a marriott is due to go up in the heart of queens plaza.&nbsp; a bunch are in the making.&nbsp; &nbsp;i think people who use them will think of them as a place to sleep and that&#039;s all.&nbsp; not a hotel experience like something posh with spa facilities, etc.&nbsp; basically get out to LIC, go to bed and get up and back into manhattan.&nbsp; if you aren&#039;t mugged, raped or murdered in the process, then it&#039;s a bargain!

				They probably also expect to be convenient for Citigroup, and others with facilities in western Queens, and the businesses that send people to call on them.
