				Very decent food, the service is still working some kinks out. We sat outside which was nice but the interior is beautiful as well.<br /><br />Probably find the same fare done a bit better at a few of the usual &#039;bests of&#039; in Astoria but this was definitely a worth entry into a crowded greek-restaurant field.

				This is our new favorite Greek restaurant! They serve the food tapas style. Three to four plates is more than enough for two people.<br /><br />Here are a few items we ate in our three visits.<br /><br />Ntomatosalata- red,yellow tomatoes with feta, red onions, capers, black olives- We love this salad.<br />Panzarosalata- red &amp; gold beets, cherry tomatoes, romaine lettuce, boiled eggs, potatoes, olives- Good<br />Kolokythakia Tiganita- zucchini chips with yogurt- Yummy<br />Lahanika Shara- Grilled Eggplant,zucchini, yellow squash- Healthy and good tasting<br />Kolokithokeftedes- Zucchini, potatoes, cheese croquettes with yogurt sauce- Our favorite dish. Perfect and not greasy<br />Kotopouol Souvlaki- Chicken Kebab- Chicken is tender and juicy. We order this every time<br />Saganaki- Fried cheese- You can not go wrong with fried cheese.<br /><br />We love this place and hope the food with remain the same quality.<br /><br /><br />

				On the recommendation of flooz and foodista on Joey in Astoria (http://astorianyc.blogspot.com/2008/04/my-2-cents-about-akti.html), we went to Akti last night and had a great meal -- and this was without actually getting any of the &quot;main&quot; fish dishes.&nbsp; In fact, my wife doesn&#039;t even eat seafood, and managed to have enough wonderful food that she wants to go back as soon as possible.&nbsp; We had a wonderful fresh Greek salad and a number of appetizers - shrimp saganaki (I obviously got this one all to myself), haloumi, chicken kebab skewers, and Greek fries.&nbsp; With a glass of wine, it came out to about $60 for the two of us.&nbsp; Great meal, the restaurant is nicely decorated and the wait staff is extremely friendly.&nbsp; Check it out!

				Wow. I am on the Akti kool-aid.<br /><br /><br />Not very familiar with seafood or greek food, but Akti compares very well with my favorite meals.<br />There are a couple of greek places in Astoria that I&#039;d probably eat at more often for more choices other than fish. But I dont know how you top Akti.<br /><br /><br />As another mentioned, the appetizers are also great.<br /><br />With drinks and tip, plan for about $40+ per person. Definitely worth it.

				We ate there a couple of weeks ago and really really enjoyed the food, although by the time we got there they had run out of alot of things.&nbsp; It is a nice change from some of the blander standard fare along 30th avenue.&nbsp; Not such a fan of having to mark down on the menu what dishes I want though...marker kept running out of ink!

				I had lunch here yesterday and I have to say I really wasn&#039;t that impressed.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t bad it just wasn&#039;t anything to write home about.&nbsp; We had the beets - which were nice but not as good as Zenon&#039;s, the grilled squid which was also good but not great, and the chicken kebab marinated in yogurt - which was undercooked and flavorless.<br /><br />they tried hard - the place is beautiful and the staff was very friendly and well trained.&nbsp; I just didn&#039;t think the food was &quot;all that&quot;.&nbsp; Of course, this might be one of those places that is better for dinner than lunch.&nbsp; I would try it again but only if a friend begged me, I&#039;ve had better Greek food all over Astoria.

				Ate at Akti with my roommate on Saturday night...<br /><br />We enjoyed the zucchini croquettes (kind of a crab cake consistency, and delicious!), and the tzatziki.&nbsp; Our waiter was attentive and helpful, although it was difficult to decide on what to order with only one menu for the table.&nbsp; <br /><br />Our waiter recommended the Mediterranean Sea Bass for our shared entree, which was delicious, but slightly disappointing in terms of price and portion size.&nbsp; If I remember correctly, it was $34 for the entree (whole fish and one side dish).<br /><br />We would probably go back, but agreed we prefer Ovelia in terms of seafood pricing, sides, and portions.&nbsp; If we returned, we would stick to the hot / cold appetizers for a tapas-style meal.

				I agree.&nbsp; Second time I went to Akti, I ordered the red snapper, paid more than the first time and was very disappointed.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gotten better fish in the diners.&nbsp; Next time I&#039;m going to make a meal of the appetizers and sides, just as I did the first time.&nbsp; They can&#039;t be beat!

				I can&#039;t think why.&nbsp; Maybe everyone&#039;s going to the more affordable restaurants?&nbsp; If I weren&#039;t so strapped for cash myself, I&#039;d have a meal there.<br /><br />I had a similar question on Super Bowl Sunday, when Flo&#039;s was nearly empty.
