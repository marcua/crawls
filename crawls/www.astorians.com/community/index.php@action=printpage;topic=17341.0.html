				Myself, my husband and our little daughter have very much outgrown our 1br place. If anyone has a lead on a &quot;real&quot; 2br, (2 bedrooms, eat-in kitchen, living room) for springtime, please let me know. We&#039;ve been in the same place for 15 years, and will stay in the next place just as long if the place is right.<br /><br />We can live away from the train. We don&#039;t go into the city all that much, and work at home most of the time. We are willing to wait for the right place and price.<br /><br />Thanks tons!

				Hi , i hve some real 2 bedrooms with bedrooms in the range of 17x13&nbsp; and the 2nd&nbsp; 13x11&nbsp; , each with doubleclosets&nbsp; and all hardwood floors .&nbsp; Eat in kitchens in Astoria arent easy to come by , but i might be able to find some as well .&nbsp; &nbsp;For the price range of $1300 it would lucky to find a 1 bedroom&nbsp; though . Sorry but im just being honest .&nbsp; &nbsp;Do you know of the upper ditmars area ?&nbsp; The apts are much larger and newer and if you dont mind being away from the train it might be a grea fit to raise a family . Ps 2 is also one of the best schools in the Astoria area .&nbsp; Are you flexible with your price range , cuz &quot;real&quot; 2 bedrooms usually are closer to the $2000 price range than the $1000 price range .

				Thanos, the market has really dropped the past few months. $1300 for a 1BR is on the high end, imo. I would also not pay $2000 for a 2BR apartment in Astoria... unless it had a washer/dryer and/or parking spot. Then I&#039;d consider it. (I&#039;m currently debating a move this summer, so I&#039;ve been wasting a lot of time searching for 2BR as of late.)<br /><br />I do agree though, if proximity to train is not an issue, you can definitely get more bang for your buck in Upper Ditmars area.<br /><br />jamiebwolcott, I found a lot of entries on craigslist for apartments in your price range. <br />http://newyork.craigslist.org/search/aap?query=astoria&amp;catAbbreviation=aap&amp;minAsk=min&amp;maxAsk=1299&amp;bedrooms=2 (http://newyork.craigslist.org/search/aap?query=astoria&amp;catAbbreviation=aap&amp;minAsk=min&amp;maxAsk=1299&amp;bedrooms=2)<br /><br />Good luck!

				$1,300 for 2brs is more realistic, in my experience. Might not get you brand-new appliances or shiny floors, but most renters don&#039;t care about &quot;fancy.&quot; Stuff gets fixed when need be, kinda noisy traffic in summer, but it&#039;s not bad overall. Big enough to share with a roommate, so I&#039;ve managed to save money that way.<br /><br />

				Ditmars area if you want something on the new end with nice appliances and possibly granite and or marble in the kitchens an baths its gonna&nbsp; be on twds the 2000 range . If you dont mind it being old and needing repairs , yea you can find it much lower , but again Ditmars is always priced higher . PS 122 is one big reason since the school is ranked very high . If someone doent have kids in school or that school , they might not want that specific area due to that . Also since Ditmars is one of the safest areas in Astoria and its close to Astoria park . <br />Rents are usually lower in the winter and spring time&nbsp; they tend to go up . So keep that in mind cuz most people dont want to move in the winter which means landlords can jack up the prices and have more to pick from .&nbsp; Again im not saying a 2 bedroom in the Ditmars area cant be done , but if u want big bdrooms , eat in kitchen&nbsp; and&nbsp; the place to be newer expect to pay a little more .

				Happy spring to everyone! <br />We definitely don&#039;t need anything new. An older building it what we prefer, we&#039;re in a 1928 and it&#039;s very solid.<br /><br />We&#039;re on a serious lookout for a place, we just keep tripping all over each other in our 1br and it&#039;s really trying our nerves. If anyone wants to take pity on a little family and let us know of a 2br for under $1300, I&#039;d be forever appreciative!
