				Hey all, just wanted to plug a local bakery.&nbsp; The bakery, which is next to the library and Wave Thai on 31st Street, has changed ownership (I guess it was a while ago, but I didn&#039;t notice).&nbsp; Anyway, they had a sign up for Churros with Dulce de Leche, and I had never had that before, so I tried them this morning.&nbsp; Oh. My. God.&nbsp; Seriously transporting -- warm and crusty on the outside and filled with gooey dulce de leche.&nbsp; I can see this is going to be habit-forming and blow my Christmas diet. Ah well. <br /><br />Anyway, I just wanted to post it here because it is a little bit out-of-the-way, and now that I have enjoyed these churros I really want them to stay in business.&nbsp; <br /><br />Rachel.

				Glad to hear they changed owners!&nbsp; The former owners would put cupcakes in the window then when you went in to buy them they would laugh and say &quot;those are for display only - we don&#039;t have any for sale&quot;.

				That&#039;s hilarious!&nbsp; Cupcake Fakery.&nbsp; I&#039;m willing to bet that this part of Astoria has more bakeries per capita than any other area, but I include Dunkin Donuts in that mix.

That was one of my favorite things when I was in Spain.

				I don&#039;t think it&#039;s Spanish, but Latin American.&nbsp; No Churros con chocolate, at least not yet -- but you should ask them!

				I went the other night after work to buy some churros and they were sold out! I guess the word is out, because the girl sad that people are coming in and buying more than usual.

				This is the definition I found of Latin American:<br /><br />the part of the American continents south of the United States in which Spanish, Portuguese, or French is officially spoken.<br /><br />I had asked if it was a Spanish bakery and someone said it was Latin American.&nbsp; I didnt&#039; exactly mean to imply that it was a Spanish bakery from Spain, but I wanted to know if the food was of Spanish origin and from this I see that it is.&nbsp; It could be things from South America.

				Ah! I was distinguishing between Spanish and Latin American because (at least according to Jose Andres&#039; cooking show) there are churros in Spain, and they are served along with thick and rich hot chocolate.&nbsp; Whereas, at this particular bakery, they have churros with dulce de leche, and pan de bono, and pan de queso, and it is my non-scientific impression that these are not foods of Spain but rather foods of Latin America.&nbsp; It is certainly possible that I am incorrect.&nbsp; <br />

				To tell you the truth I really don&#039;t even know what those things are.&nbsp; I&#039;m so used to Italian bakeries.&nbsp; I would like to try this bakery though.

				I bet the owners are from Argentina as I had dulce de leche many times growing up as a kid. Churros originate from Spain,have had them in Barcelona dipped in chocolate. I will have to make a visit there and buy some,after conversing with them I will be able to tell where they are from. For example a Spaniard and an Argentinian both speak spanish,but there are many differences in dialect.<br /><br />I found a review for the place,this must be it.(Vienna Desserts?)<br /><br />http://www.yelp.com/biz/vienna-desserts-cakes-for-all-occasions-long-island-city

				I have been to this bakery very recently- maybe I just went on a bad day- the churros actually heavy and chewy- like they were premade and frozen. They were thick and filled with chocolate or leche-- I wouldnt recommend them based on what I tasted. I believe they claim to be a cuban bakery.
