				Why is this place almost always empty everytime we go? Could be that we tend to go earlier than usual. It&#039;s on Broadway b/w Crescent and 29th, next to Los Portales and Dunkin Donuts/Baskin Robbins; across from Bakeway.<br /><br />Never mind the mouse I saw last time we were there- food is good and cheap enough that we&#039;re not fazed by that (besides, the door was open the whole time, probably just stopped in to check things out.) John got the biriyany lamb (basmati rice w/lamb chunks, almonds, peas, etc.) and I got the balti seafood (fish in some kind of sauce w/white rice and yogurt sauce on the side.)<br /><br />They start you off with a crisp, spicy flatbread and three sauces. We also ordered garlic nan to go with dinner. Just water to drink and for both of us, less than $25 ($30 with tip) and enough to take home (we just mix our leftovers together with the extra rice).<br /><br />Anyway, it&#039;s flavorful comfort food. Wish they&#039;d mix up the CD selection a little more, seems like it&#039;s always the same sitar music.

				I ate there 2 times and thought the food was really good.&nbsp; I&#039;m surprised that they are still in business because it was empty when I went there too.&nbsp; I never saw a mouse there.

				The mouse didn&#039;t rattle me b/c like I said, the door was open and the mouse was near the entrance, so it probably ducked in. To think there are restaurants in the city with zero vermin is naive- bugs and rodents will come and go, the best any establishment can do is take all the necessary precautions to prevent them.<br /><br />I think they do a pretty good take-out business, so even though the place is empty, I do see guys going out with packages, and the phone&#039;s always ringing.

				I ate there once when it first opened, was so excited for Indian on Broadway, as at the time I was not a fan of either place off of 30th Avenue (one of which has since changed names &amp; is vastly improved, but I digress...).&nbsp; Didn&#039;t think the food was very good at all.&nbsp; Not horrendous, but I never went back.&nbsp; I remember trying to get an iced tea &amp; after much negotiating was served a can of Nestea, a blast from my past.&nbsp; That was the highlight.

				That place is always empty!&nbsp; I also assume they survived on take out.&nbsp; Although I believe most restaurants have mice, I do believe that those with mice that appear in the front while customers are in the restaurant have a worse problem than other restaurants.

				we order from mughal at least once a week- their delivery service and food is excellent.<br />the chana masala and vegetable samosas are delicious!<br /><br />ate there once, and it was completely empty. but their phone rang every few minutes with people placing orders. it was kind of quiet and depressing, so now we just stick with the delivery.
