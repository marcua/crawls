				Dear Friends of Seeds of Love,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hello! We are very excited to announce that we are having another fundraising event! The wonderful ladies of Curves in Astoria have been gracious enough to donate their space to help us continue our mission. We can&#039;t thank you enough, Michelle and Maria!<br /><br />On Saturday, January 28th, we&#039;ll be setting up our sale at Curves , located at 36-10 Ditmars Blvd. from 2:00 pm - 6:00 pm. (See attached flyer for more details in jpg and pdf form!) We&#039;ve got lots of new clothes, (even things for your husbands, boyfriends and sons!) ladies bags, adorable air fresheners, cute accessories and even bed in a bag sets!&nbsp; Seeds of Love t-shirts will also be available for purchase and all proceeds go to our cause. <br /><br />Curves members will get a free gift with every purchase. If you are not a member yet, and you&#039;re curious about what goes on inside Curves, come by, make a purchase and get a coupon for a free-week trial at Curves! (Just think of it as our way of helping you get started on your new year&#039;s resolution!)&nbsp; I&#039;ve been a member for a year, and I love it there! <br /><br />As always, we have an important cause to focus on for this event. As Jennifer and I sat down to decide on a cause, we contacted the lovely people at the Child Life Center at Schneider Children&#039;s Hospital. They requested portable DVD players for the children&#039;s oncology department for patients in long term care. Without a doubt, with part of the proceeds of this event, we will fulfill this wish.&nbsp; <br /><br />And then, I received a heart breaking email from a close friend. Twin babies Zack and Kyle were born on December 1, 2007 with a rare and devisating skin disease, Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB). I know that we have a lot of young seedlings on our mailing list, so I will not go into the graphic details of their condition. It is truly horrific. However, it is important to know that this family in New Jersey needs our help. It&#039;s amazing how two working parents with insurance are able to accumulate tens of thousands of dollars in debt in medical bills in just six weeks. If you would like to know more about what the twins are going through, please reply to this email and I will forward more information to you.&nbsp; Details about their condition will be available at the sale. You can also log on to www.debra.org or google&nbsp; images of &quot;Epidermolysis Bullosa&quot; to find out more about this frightening disease.<br /><br />Besides cash donations, there is a wish list of supplies needed for the care of these babies. I have spoken to Rick, a very sweet man, who is the proud grandfather of the twins. He is overwhelmed by our efforts to help his family. If you are interested, we will be collecting supplies needed for the delicate care of the babies at our event.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Supplies needed: <br />Aquaphor healing ointment or Vaseline sterilized ointment <br />Soft Cling bandages made by Johnson and Johnson, <br />Any type of Kerlix dressing products which are similar to Soft Cling <br />En Famil Lipil with Iron – infant formula <br />Huggies diapers – Size 1 <br />Wet Ones – must be hypoallergenic/fragrance free <br />Dreft baby detergent <br /><br />Please feel free to pass this email on to others who you feel may want to help. You can also print the attached flyer and invite your friends and family to come down and shop.<br /><br />Remember to check out our website for updates at www.seedsoflovecares.com<br />or visit our myspace at www.myspace.com/seedsoflovecares<br /><br />I recently heard this quote, and it reminded me so much of what we do.<br /><br />&quot;The true meaning of life is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit&quot; <br />~ Nelson Henderson.<br /><br />&nbsp;Thank your for your time... I&#039;m looking forward to seeing all of you at the sale!<br /><br />:::::Big hugs::::::<br />Danielle<br /><br />(http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2205/2209993531_2b4d930572.jpg)
