				I like to change the scenery for myself a bit, and was curious if there were any other coffee shops south of the Grand Central Parkway other than Kinship and Kickshaw. Ditmars is a far walk, and I&#039;m a little bitch.

				Have you tried Caffino? It&#039;s right by 30th Ave/Crescent. Not sure if that&#039;s an area you&#039;re wanting to go to, but it&#039;s a really nice little place that&#039;s kind of a bright spot in that area. Coffee is great, there are even sandwiches I think, and people working there are very friendly. <br /><br /><br />http://weheartastoria.com/2014/05/caffino-a-new-30th-ave-area-cafe-is-open/

				These may be too close to the Grand Central for you but still on the side you prefer.&nbsp; This French place is nice and has delicious baked goods http://www.yelp.com/biz/noisette-pastries-astoria&nbsp; I also like this place a lot.&nbsp; Bold, robust espresso and also good muffins and even a full breakfast I believe. http://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-via-espresso-astoria-3

				Astoria Coffee is about to open on 30th Street just south of 30th Avenue (same building as the Verizon Wireless store).&nbsp; This is the brick-and-mortar offshoot of the neighborhood coffee delivery service that started up last year.

				Though I&#039;m liking some of these places, my intent was to find a cozy spot that has wifi that would be ok with me sitting with my laptop (and continuously buying food/drink to earn my spot).

				<br />Yeah, Caffino and Astoria Coffee are both great.&nbsp; Caffino has great pastry from er.....that super popular french pastry restaurant place in SoHo that all the tourists have been going to for ages for brunch?...can&#039;t remember name of place but pastry is great.&nbsp; Caffino owners are Sija (SEE-ya) and her husband (forget his name).... very cute decor but very tiny...more of a to-go place...don&#039;t think any WiFi.<br /><br />Astoria Coffee is a good size and maybe seating for 12 and I suspect they have WiFi.&nbsp; Owner is Dennis.<br />

				I didn&#039;t really like Astoria Coffee. The place was really cool looking, and the staff wonderfully nice, but the one beverage I tried -- a regular iced coffee -- wasn&#039;t very good. Had a weird flavor to it. I&#039;ll have to try some of their other drinks to see if maybe it was just the iced coffee that I don&#039;t like.<br /><br /><br />Of the newer little coffee shops opening, I like Madame Sousou on 33rd St. and 31st Ave. Don&#039;t know if they have wifi, but they have some stools and counters to sit at. The first couple of times I stopped, they still weren&#039;t fully up and running, and didn&#039;t have cream for coffee. Next time I stopped in, they only had fat free creamer. Pastries looked good, though they didn&#039;t have a huge selection. Really hope they succeed.<br /><br />

				I hope they&#039;ve improved their coffee in the past few months. The stuff I had there was terrible.

				Sitting down in Astoria Coffee for the first time right now. Not a bad place. Totally picky, but the table&#039;s too high for the stools...and I&#039;m 6&#039;2&quot;! haha<br /><br /><br />Very pleasant place. Maybe too quiet?

I&#039;ve always known (and wrote about) Native Coffee (Brian) and Astoria Coffee (Dennis) as two very separate businesses.&nbsp; Sorry about the confusion about what I hope improved - it would be Madame Sousou&#039;s coffee. Such a cute little space but the coffee was not good, at least what I was served. I&#039;d like to return this fall and see if it&#039;s changed - I know early days in the life can be full of missteps.
