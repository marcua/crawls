				As this is America, and we all have certain freedoms, you have to freedoms to not watch football. &nbsp;But there are a lot of us that enjoy it. &nbsp;And we will continue to watch it with enjoyment. &nbsp;Ain&#39;t that right Cathy? &nbsp;:-) &nbsp;Even though we like different teams, and our teams are mortal enemies (and sadly, my team is on the losing side), we can certainly both agree on our enjoyment of watching football. :rock:

				Um, yeah football rocks. Though I&#39;m an odd one because I really don&#39;t care too much for pro football. But college football...&nbsp; :smitten:&nbsp; It can drag on a bit, Meg, I agree. But if it&#39;s a really great, close game, it&#39;ll just fly by. And if one of the teams is just getting beaten to a pulp, I&#39;ll change the channel. I prefer to watch college ball when I can flip back and forth between several different games. I&#39;m always after the most exciting one. If I try and watch one game, I usually end up dozing off.<br /><br />And on that note, there is NOTHING better than a fall afternoon nap with football on the tele. It&#39;s the best lullabye EVER!&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				You should complain in the rants section.&nbsp; Football is an American tradition.&nbsp; What is really unfortunate is that there are only a couple of bars around Astoria that actually carry all the games (both college and pro).&nbsp; If it were up to me I would submit people to watch football 24 hours a day in order to make up for all the Food Network, Grey&#39;s Anatomy, Oprah, etc. that my girlfriend forces me to watch in the offseason.<br /><br />GO BUCKEYES!!!

				McCann&#39;s?&nbsp; A lot of the Greek cafes seem to have big screens often with sports on them, such as Grand, and Athens.&nbsp; There&#39;s Remote Lounge but I don&#39;t know if anyone actually goes in there, what&#39;s it like?<br /><br />I&#39;m not a big football fan and had the misfortune of dating 3 men in a row, who were pretty damn fanatical about it.&nbsp; Factor that in with the fact that they were major potheads and video gamers, and it made for a pretty lame scene.&nbsp; Kinda turned me off to the whole thing....&nbsp; I prefer baseball myself, or soccer.&nbsp; And I love figure skating but no one usually cares.&nbsp; But I can miss a game or show of anything and my life won&#39;t end.&nbsp; I guess I&#39;m not too fanatical about sports or shows, and there&#39;s always tivo.<br /><br />But people do love their football.&nbsp; And that&#39;s fine.&nbsp; If I don&#39;t want to watch it, it&#39;s pretty simple.&nbsp; I don&#39;t have to.&nbsp; Just leave the room.&nbsp; It&#39;s not that hard to avoid your significant other on a Sunday or Monday in this big city with so much to do.<br /><br />Oh and I realize none of you are major potheads.&nbsp; At least I hope&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; It&#39;s just the combination of the two and the regularity of it that turned me off.&nbsp; My bad luck.&nbsp; Scarred me against normal football junkies for life.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-P

				Irish Rover is an excellent place to watch sports.&nbsp; It&#39;s been awesome and my favorite place to watch Yankee games.&nbsp; When I was there last time, football - multiple games - were all over the TVs.&nbsp; I imagine that would be a good place for you to watch.&nbsp; Good beer selection and super nice bartenders.&nbsp; Healthy buy back policy.&nbsp; No food, though (you can bring some with you, though).&nbsp; But definitely check it out.

				Can you get food delivery to Irish Rover? What&#39;s close and good for sandwiches/burgers/stuff like that? <br /><br />Anyone interested in watching the game with me tomorrow? I gotta see my &#39;boys, even if it means sitting in a bar by myself surrounded by strangers who, I&#39;m just guessing here, won&#39;t be Cowboys fans!

				Oh yes oh yes, my Cowboys dom-i-nated today. Philly better gear up&nbsp; - we are coming to town baby!<br /><br />The Irish Rover was awesome for watching games. I had a blast with Cary119, being a Titans fan she&nbsp; didn&#39;t enjoy the game as much&nbsp; :evil:, and Jtrane, whose Bills played an exciting game and came out on top as well! There were actually a few other Cowboy fans there - I loved it! Look forward to going back there the next time Cowboys aren&#39;t on the East Coast line-up. Ummmm, let&#39;s see that will be Oct. 15, with Houston at home. Then the week after that is a biggggggie, a Sunday night game - Giants AT Dallas! <br /><br />Who saw the almost-spectacular finish to the Jets game? Stunning, really.

				Even though it was only the Texans I&#39;m still glad we pulled out that can of whup-ass!! I&#39;m a little nervous about next weeks game against the Giants though. I would say I am hopefully confident.
