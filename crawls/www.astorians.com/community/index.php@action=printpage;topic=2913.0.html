				I really like Manny from Neon Realty. He was really nice and did not pressure me or show me places that were a waste of time. Neon used to be on Broadway- they are now on 31st Street near 30th ave. <br /><br />I worked with Chantel at Aamen Realty years ago and did not like her at all. They were charging a month and a half commission when most of the other realtors were only charing one month and she showed me places that were completely out of my price range.

				Funny realtor story.. I was looking for an apartment and made an appointment with a broker. (I don&#39;t remember where from). When I walk into the office she greets me and I am like uh oh. She was wearing the shortest mini-skirt and tight shirt and high heels. I was kind of embarrased to go see places.. Anyway, went to see a place and the landlord and her teenage son were there. It was pretty funny becuase the son had a grin from ear to ear. Anyway, she went on to tell us she has a daughter. The daughter doesn&#39;t like hanging out with her anymore.. Geez, I wonder why?

				Thirded. Lisa Teahan is a great agent. I also got my apartment from MQ Realty. Mary Guevara was my agent. She was amazingly helpful and patient (had a roommate situation fall apart) and got me a great apartment. I also know Lisa and the other agents at MQ personally and I can tell you that they look out for your best interest at all times. The office location is 31-87 Steinway, Suite 8 and the phone number is 718-956-3200. <br /><br />I&#39;ve heard stories about that Liz character...she&#39;s like the Loch Ness Monster of the Queens real estate world.

				My roommates and I went through the ringer trying to find a place. We were shown approximately 25 different apartments with several different brokers. Angelica with Capital realty finally found us our new home. She was decently easy to work with. A little skiddish at times. Grace Realty on the other hand was not so helpful...I take that back, the man working at Grace realty was helpful, Grace on the other hand acted as if she&#39;d had a few too many tranquilizers and kept forgetting where she&#39;d put our paperwork/who we were etc. I would not reccommend her.

				Ugh, Capital Realty got me my bed bug infested apartment, and made me pay $100 for a credit report when they only cost $20.&nbsp; I&#39;m sure she pocketed the rest.&nbsp; Then there was the illegal key deposit.&nbsp; I&#39;ll never go back based on my experience with the whole thing. There are some shady realtors out there.<br /><br />I had the same experience with Grace.&nbsp; Her coworker was nice, but she wanted 10-15% of a year and I just refuse to pay that, when there are plenty of other realtors who charge a month.

				i second the non recommendation for angelica at capital reatly. she sucked big time. kept me waiting over an hour for my appointment. made me and 5 other people squish into her car to drive like 2 blocks to all see the same apartments, at the same time. <br />she didn&#39;t overcharge for the credit report at the time (like 5 years ago) but she was hopelessly disorganized. and i swear all the &quot;other people&quot; that she had in her office were fake. she was perpetuating the image of having a team when it was really just her. <br />at grace realty i dealt with mihaela (sp?) who was very nice but couldn&#39;t show me anything within my moving dates.<br />great experience with irene at dynasty, although i stupidly paid 15%, now i know better-21 and needing a place before fordham kicked me out-they give you one day after graduation. i did kind of get screwed by the first apartment i saw and that i put a partial deposit on(the landlord decided to rent it to her neice&#39;s friend or something after i went through everything but signing) she and everyone else there apologized and swore they would never work with her again. don&#39;t know if they meant it but i thought it was a nice gesture. she did find me something else that worked out quite quickly after that little debacle.

				i used grace realty...i give them mixed reviews. they do charge too much (worked out to be almost a month and a half). i&#39;m satisfied with my apartment. a bit of a bullsh*tter like the rest of them when she said there were lots of &quot;young people&quot; in my building. yeah right. more like a senior home - im 31 and have to be the youngest person by far. and i was told no kids in the building - except for the one across the hall who is extremely loud. they guy she works with seems alright, he said my landlord was very good and the building was well taken care of and i have to agree.

				Hi I just moved to Astoria so the whole broker experience is still fresh.<br />Re-Max on Steinway was a total joke driving me and my roommates all over Astoria to see apartments that were either already rented, not in our price range or just plain gross.<br />Grace realty actually took a deposit from us on what we believed was a dream apartment and then kept it for days giving us the run-around regarding the signing of the lease because the landlord wanted to meet us! I have never ever heard of this before, like ever.&nbsp; Then he decided to rent to a friend of one of his tenants in the building. An entire three bedroom apartment for one person? Curious, no? WE got our deposit back but not without having to get a smidge tiffy with them.<br />We ended up with flake-o Angelica at Capital Realty, whom I do not recommend at all if only because her kid is a brat-a-tat-tat and ALWAYS in the office! Doesn&#39;t that kid go to school? <br />Besides, she charges too much for a credit check, wouldn&#39;t tell me the names or address of the people who legally own the building we were to move in, made me go all the way out to Ditmars to get my apartment keys on my move in day where the dudes who were moving out were actually still in the apartment, and the second she got her fee she was of no help. On the other hand, our super is the coolest dude ever, the bulding is well-kept with a good mix of people. Then again...twenty people living in the apartment above us all of whom wear hard-soled shoes at all hours of the night.<br />Angelica is not a recommendation at all! Grace Realty are shyster-esque too.

				I think overall there&#39;s a general feeling among brokers that they are working for the landlords. The &quot;good&quot; brokers realize that they are working for <em>YOU</em>, because you are the one paying them. If you get a broker who isn&#39;t on your side, then fire that broker and go and get one that will work for you.<br /><br />In our experience with brokers we found that nearly all of them work for the landlord (on their side), but of course want you to pay them. I&#39;ve <em>never</em> found a broker I was happy with, though it&#39;s been a few years since we used one. We did end up renting our first apartment through a broker, but once you live here I think it&#39;s much more worth it to spend some time canvasing the streets and talking to locals to see what&#39;s available. How do you think brokers find the empty houses? Just become your own broker and save the money.<br /><br />A friend of mine found an interesting way to put the broker to work for him. After he found out the price of the apartment he wanted he asked the broker to get a lower price, which of course the broker (who is working for the landlord) said that they couldn&#39;t go lower (besides, it&#39;s not in the interest of the broker to negotiate a lower rent for you, the person who is paying them, because they get a bigger commission based on a bigger rent for you [so twisted]). So he said he&#39;d give a 200% bonus commission on every dollar the broker negotiated off the monthly lease. In other words, if the broker lowered the rent $50, then he gets an extra $100 in commissions. Surprise, surprise, the rent was lowered $200/month. Broker got an extra $400, but that paid for itself in no time.<br /><br />The way this city works is really screwed up sometimes. Only in NYC do renters have to pay brokers who work for the interests of the landlord. What a joke.

				I definitely recommend Sarah at Owner&#39;s Club Realty on Ditmars. Also there is an apt for rent on my block - 36th street between Ditmars and 23rd Ave. It&#39;s the first floor of a 2-family, I think someone may live in the basement but I&#39;m not sure. I know the upstairs is occupied. The block is pretty good and the location excellent, have no idea of the rent or condition, but the rental sign is for Owner&#39;s Club.

				MQ Realty, agreed.&nbsp; I can&#39;t remember the name of my broker, she was a youngish black woman, but she found us a place and pushed thru the paperwork FAST.&nbsp; I think my apt is a little on the pricey side (1050 for a medium-sized studio) but she was great.<br /><br />Pluses:&nbsp; Really fast (she showed me a place the afternoon I came in)<br />Lenient on money issues (I don&#39;t have a job because I&#39;m a student so the landlord wanted six months&#39; rent ahead of time; she took me check and started the paperwork before the check cleared)<br />Really good listener: She was concerned about my needs and really social<br />Responsible: No short skirts or other crazy things; she was really professional<br />Deal: She got me a deal and I don&#39;t think that she made money of this (the apt was listed at 1100/month)<br /><br />Complaints:<br />She didn&#39;t charge me a credit check fee because I had a printed form of my own.&nbsp; She did charge a $50 (I think) &quot;application fee.&quot;&nbsp; I also think that she only had more expensive apts as mine was the only one in this price range that was near the N/W.

				I&#39;ve used Halvatzis realty (the one on Ditmars and 28th, next to Everything Bagel) twice now to find apartments. I know Kim well, who handles rentals, and she&#39;s great. She&#39;s from the Ditmars neighborhood and knows a lot of the landlords personally. And George, the owner, seems like a stand-up guy, although I don&#39;t know him as well as Kim. I was also a very good tenant for several years for a landlord who knows Kim and her family well, so that probably puts me in better stead than someone new coming to Astoria. I never felt like Kim was merely out for my fee. She actually steered me away on several occasions from certain rentals because she knew that that landlords there were not the kind people I wanted to rent from. My nephew is looking to move here and I&#39;ve put him in touch with Kim. If I&#39;m in a position to ever buy a property in this neighborhood and want to go through a realtor, Halvatzis will be my first choice.<br /><br />Unlike Grace realty. Grace reality set off alarm bells. I went there to look at an apartment for which I was already in touch with the existing tenant.&nbsp; I think I was going to sublet it or something. The first thing Grace, I guess it was Grace, said was that I had to pay for the credit report. I balked, saying I want to look at the apartment first. Then she raises her voice telling me, &quot;that&#39;s how it&#39;s done here.&quot; I said, &quot;OK,&quot; got up and left. Sorry, there are too many brokers around her to put up with that.<br /><br />Though I don&#39;t exactly like having to pay a broker&#39;s fee because the moving outlay is large enough as it is, I understand the reasoning behind it, at least from my experience with Halvatzis. They&#39;re the ones vetting potential renters, doing the references and credit checks, which is why landlords rely on them. They arrange for apartment viewings, the paper work and so on, stuff that most landlords probably don&#39;t want to be bothered with. If I was a landlord, I&#39;d go through a broker. It doesn&#39;t cost them anything.<br /><br />I also found that it is a business relationship. If the broker believes you are going to be a good customer, I think most will try to get you as close as possible to what you want. If you go into a broker&#39;s office with a bit of a grudge that you have to &quot;deal with these money-grubbers&quot;, then it&#39;ll probably not make the relationship with the broker terribly productive. Yes, some of them are money-grubbers and you can usually tell in the first few minutes of meeting them.<br /><br />For people new to the neighborhood, it&#39;s worth remembering that to a broker, you&#39;re a potential revenue stream and that&#39;s it. They don&#39;t know anything about you and if you happen to become an awful tenant, a landlord may think twice about renting to people that broker finds for them. Take the time to get to know you&#39;re broker, and interview them as well. If they give you the creeps take your business elsewhere, as is your right. If you think they&#39;re worth trusting, let them know that you want to give them your business. They may go that extra yard to help you find what you&#39;re lookign for.<br /><br />This is defninitley a good place to find out about brokers since most of us have had experiences with them at some point or another.<br /><br />Good luck.

				As a compliment to this thread: http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=4086.0<br /><br />we&#39;re starting our search for a new place. I looked up a couple broker recommendations on this here forum, but there were kind of old, so I&#39;m looking for more recent recommendations. We&#39;re not averse to <em>not</em> using a broker, but with both of us working full-time and going to school, we don&#39;t have a lot of time for a long involved search.<br /><br />Recommendations for brokers that have apartments in the Ditmars area, dog-friendly, 1 bedrooms for around $1200? Or if you have a hot tip that would be great too. :-)

				When my roommate and I were looking for a place, we spent a while looking with Martha @ Astoria Park Realty.&nbsp; She really did bend over backwards trying to find us a place, and would stay late working around our 9-5 schedules.&nbsp; We actually did not end up finding our place with her (we had a tall order - a 2BR for $1600 WITH a cat) but she was hard-working, speaks Greek, and seemed to have a good selection of apartments.&nbsp; They seem to specialize on the north side/Ditmars area of Astoria.<br /><br />We found our place (on the south side of Astoria, near the LIC border) through Astor Realty on Broadway.&nbsp; We worked with a woman named Irene.&nbsp; She was very professional and seemed to have good connections - however, when I saw her on the street a couple weeks after the lease signing and said hello, she didn&#39;t remember me.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Oh well.<br /><br />

				I found my place through one of the brokers in Carmela&#39;s office - I think it was Robyn.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t like the first place I saw with her, or the other 3-4 places we looked at (she took me out with another girl who was also looking for a place of her own) but she told me about some apartments opening up in another building that she liked a lot.&nbsp; She called me a couple of weeks later, we saw this one, and I fell in love.&nbsp; <br /><br />One month fee, and I appreciated the fact that she remembered me and did in fact call me when the other apartments came in.&nbsp; Okay, so she was a little confused when she first told me about the location of the apartment (she had my landlord&#39;s two buildings mixed up), but she did have a lot in my range - varying quality, but again, I love the one I wound up with.<br /><br />I&#39;d work with her again if I had to, but I&#39;m hoping not to have to leave this one for awhile.

				We used Liz Finnerty at Metropolis on 23rd ave and 31st street. She was very busy but had overall the best apartments. (we ended up getting our 1br new construction from her). She also was very friendly with the buliding owners and was able to negotiate when necessary.<br /><br />Irene from Astor was a horror. After seeing no less than a half dozen ads on craiglist listed by her, when we actually had an appointment (same day) she told us nothing was availalbe and proceeded to waste our time showing us an overpriced crap apartment behind an alley.<br /><br />DONT USE MQ REALTY. under any circumstances. They are theives and total scumbags. Completley lied to us, we only got out with our money becuase when we went to sign the paperwork on our apt, there were 2 OTHER PEOPLE signing the same lease as well, and MQ was pocketing the security. STAY AWAY at aLL COSTS.<br /><br />Chantal was good from Aamen Realty on Ditmars and 31st street, and Stefan from Patridge has a nice building on 21st ave and 33rd street.. it just depends on what&#39;s available.<br /><br />GOOD LUCK.

				Well, since most apartment hunters are looking with multiple brokers and looking at multiple apartments, and you know you&#39;re not going to pounce until you see The One, I didn&#39;t mind.&nbsp; Since I was looking alone, it was actually nice to have somebody else there so that when the broker and super left the room we could both quickly confer on our thoughts.<br /><br />If we&#39;d hit a real gem on that trip it might have been a knock-down drag-out, but we didn&#39;t.<br /><br />I mean in most cases, you know other people are considering the apartments you&#39;re looking at.&nbsp; To have them physically present didn&#39;t really bother me.&nbsp; You just have to be ready to pounce.<br /><br />In my case, my place opened up about a month after that trip, and I pounced.&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:<br />

				The realtor (or other types of business) posts &quot;disguised&quot; as normal posts around here are definitely annoying. I don&#39;t mind a realtor posting in response to someone&#39;s question, but otherwise, it&#39;s so transparent.

				I have had the same problem with brokers.&nbsp; Metropolis Realty even did the &quot;bait and switch&quot; with us, making us come on down for an appointment with them and told us the apartment we spake of &quot;just was rented out, but my friend, I have others that you will like&quot;.&nbsp; We ended up using Charles at Re/Max. Nice guy, but he didnt help us find the place.&nbsp; I found it by checking Craig&#39;s List like a hawk for two weeks.&nbsp; The crappy places stay on Craig&#39;s list forever, but the really good ones are snapped up within a day.

				Hi everyone,<br /><br />First off I just wanted to say thanks to everyone who has posted on this topic so far. I&#39;ve been using your recommendations to try and find a decent broker and apartment, and for the most part all the things said about certain brokers has been true.<br /><br />I haven&#39;t yet found a place, though, and I was curious if anyone knew anything about the following brokers: Zikos Realty, Astoria Park Realty, and Iazzag Realty. I see a lot of their ads on backpages.com, craigslist, and the Village Voice and I&#39;d like to know if anyone has used them or at least visited them and can provide some feedback. I&#39;m sort of skeptical about them (the fact that they seem to keep reposting the same or very similar ads over and over probably means the places are not so good), but then again I don&#39;t know very much about any of them.<br /><br />Also, I&#39;ve managed to set myself up with a nearly impossible task - try to find a decent studio (i.e. no basements or otherwise illegal living spaces), within a 12 minute walk of the N/W, for $950-$1000 (and that&#39;s pretty much as high as I can go). While I&#39;m dreaming, I&#39;d also like to be up in the Ditmars end of Astoria. Thoughts/comments/help, anyone?

				Check out the Good Realtors to find a place in Astoria thread.&nbsp; Some people with positive experiences there.&nbsp; I think the general concensus is that MQ Realty and Metropolis Realty are sketchy.&nbsp; Its been noted that Buy/Sell show places that they know have beg bugs in them.<br /><br />Give Craig&#39;s List a shot, it can&#39;t hurt.<br /><br />Good luck!

				Long time Astorian, new member as our search intensifies.<br /><br />So far have had little luck (looking for 2+ bd, new or recent renovation, cat freindly, $17 range)&nbsp; &nbsp;Have checked with a few brokers in area and scouring CL and such.&nbsp; We seem to have a good relationship with our current landlord and he is ok with us giving 30 days when we find a place.<br /><br />So far...Chantel with Aamen was nice (as was her husband?), but showed us an apartment that was $200 over, and met few of our criteria, but did offer to negotiate down for us.<br /><br />Re-Max - Teresa was nice.&nbsp; showed us 3 apartments that went from bad to ok as we saw them.&nbsp; However, my real complaint was someone from their office called our current landlord and asked if they could list the apartment we currently occupy!!&nbsp; sleezy<br /><br />Buy-Sell had nothing<br /><br />Grace- had nothing and told me to call him every few days !?!?!?!?!&nbsp; isn&#39;t that their job????<br /><br />Anyway, thanks all for the good advice and realtor exp here.&nbsp; &nbsp;I should have joined this site years ago.

				Hello all, <br />My bf and I want to own real estate and after walking around Astoria for the past couple of months we really like the vibe and the people there.

Is anyone planning to buy in any of these new buildings? We are particularly interested in the new condo building at 23-23 31st Ave. It looks really nice inside and out and the developer seems really nice as well.&nbsp; Does anyone have any info we should know about?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />marsians~

				I also wanted to say thanks to everyone who&#39;s posted to this tread so far.&nbsp; We&#39;ve been looking on craigslist and have used three brokers mentioned here so far.&nbsp; I can&#39;t say that&#39;s it&#39;s not getting a little depressing looking at most of these places.&nbsp; &nbsp;:killme:<br /><br />The apartment we have now is <strong>HUGE</strong> compared to everything we&#39;ve been shown.&nbsp; It&#39;s also cheaper by a few hundred bucks, and that includes heat and water, four large closets, a balcony with a great view, an elevator, trash shoot, and a <span class="bbc_u">heated garage</span> just to mention a few things.&nbsp; Unfortunately we can&#39;t stand anymore that everyone and everything around us is in Korean.&nbsp; Book stores, cafes, bars, grocery stores, everything, and I can&#39;t talk to any of my neighbors. I&#39;ve also gotten the feeling I&#39;m not wanted in a lot of places.&nbsp; The guy at the video place actually yelled at me, waving his hand as if to shoo me out &quot;Only Korean.&quot;&nbsp; I&#39;m guessing he meant the movies, lol.&nbsp; I thought I&#39;d really like it here, but it gets lonely and boring when you can&#39;t go hang out in your own neighborhood.<br /><br />So anyway, we&#39;re moving.&nbsp; And Astoria seems so great, but all the apartments we&#39;ve seen, with one exception, are just awful. :cry:<br />The one exception was nice and clean and well cared for, but so small and a 4th floor walk up.&nbsp; I&#39;m not old, but 4 flights ... wears me out just thinking about it.&nbsp; We may have to settle for it and just put most of my things in storage, starting with all my art supplies. (Even more money,lol. I don&#39;t know how a lot of people do it.)<br /><br />So the search continues for a place.&nbsp; And I&#39;ll keep checking back here for any advice I can get.&nbsp; Thanks everyone.

Recommended again.<br /><br />GEORGE @ Century 21 / 23rd Ave 718-204-0101<br />Patient and non-pushy, and a different selection of listings again. Also recommended.<br /><br />ROB @ F.S Marino was helpful, as was NICHOLAS @ Astor Realty. <br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">The so-so...</span><br /><br />MQ Realty<br />Wasn&#039;t sure about these guys. They seemed nice enough in person, but then they kept advertising places on Craig&#039;s List that had already been taken. Presumably a ploy to show you other stuff instead.<br /><br />Zikos Reality <br />The couple here didn&#039;t seem to be all that interested when showing me stuff.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t take to them at all.<br /><br />Grace Realty<br />Seemed kinda sleezy. And nobody should get away with trying to charge 1.5 months fee here.<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">The rubbish...</span><br /><br />Taichi Realty<br />Call me old fashioned, but I don&#039;t like being either lied to or when realtors don&#039;t turn up when they say they will.<br /><br />Hope this helps walking through the minefield of real estate rentals!<br /><br />Neil<br />Feb 07

				Hi Everyone,<br /><br />This entire topic has been a tremendous help in finding an apartment. <br /><br />I would like to also put in a glowing recommendation for Kim at Halvatzis. I called her, went over a short list of my (rather picky) things I wanted in an apartment, as well as a fairly low budget. We saw a place that evening, and I knew instantly it was right. Kim was pleasant to work with, not pushy or demanding at all, and she truly listened to what we were looking for and would have helped us find it even if the first place was not the one. <br /><br />I also am a big fan of Nick at Metropolis. He helped me get my first astoria apartment 4 years ago, and again 2 years ago when I thought I was going to move. This time around he was also very helpful, attentive, and optimistic that we&#039;d get something within our budget and to our liking. Just the luck of the draw that we didn&#039;t take one of his places :(<br /><br />I would go back to both of these brokers in a heartbeat. Let&#039;s hope I don&#039;t need to!<br /><br />

				Now that i signed my lease (as of today i have a new home to move into in June) I can wholeheartedly recommend Flora from Venus Realty (38th st @ 3st ave) Unlike all the other brokers i dealt with, she was the ONLY one to keep calling me with apartments to see after seeing something that didn&#039;t suit us. Every other one i had to chase down to see something else. She&#039;s not pushy, very friendly, very accomodating and really works with you to find what you want and make it work. <br /><br />New York Marathon Realty, however can suck it and suck it hard.<br />We gave them a budget of $1400/mo and she told us if we went up a couple hundred bucks to $1600 they could find us lots. Well, we wound up raising our budget to $1600 and all of a sudden we needed to go higher to find anything. They took us to a one bedroom at the top of our range for a 2 and tried to push it on us saying we would be lucky to have it and wouldn&#039;t find anything better. But it&#039;s not what we wanted. Then the promised to show us an absolutely gorgeous 2BR. It was totally gutted, there weren&#039;t any walls. Know why? B/c it was a 1BR they were converting to a 2BR. The second &quot;room&quot; was a glorified walk in closet. And for that we would also have to top out or budget AND give the super a key deposit. And that right there is why i will always recommend against them. Key deposits are illegal, and any broker willing to engage in that can, as i said earlier, suck it.<br /><br />Nicholas at Astor Realty was helpful, but we couldn&#039;t go with the place he showed us. (but unlike Flora, never followed up)<br /><br />I contacted Tony from F.S. Marino based on this thread, and although he seems like a nice guy he showed me two apartments that were so atrocious i couldn&#039;t believe anyone one would ever live there. I couldn&#039;t believe a broker would show those to anyone. And then say thats what you get for the price.<br /><br />There were a couple others i met, but they never followed up (those being Nick from Metropolis and George from Century). And once i started working with Flora I really didn&#039;t have time for another broker.<br /><br />I will tell you that every apartment she showed us that we didn&#039;t take was rented in a matter of days. In one case it was hours. So be prepared to take something immediately or you&#039;ll be outta the running fast. <br /><br />On craigslist if you see call Flora or Andy, that&#039;s Venus Realty.

				yeah marathon realty sucked and the women in there acted like the poop dont stink!&nbsp; I found a great 1.5 BR for 1100 people!&nbsp; There is HOPE!<br /><br />To all the shady realtors out there that tell you there is no way you can find a decent 1br for less than 1200, i say bs.&nbsp; Granted it all depends on your circumstances and how much time you have to look and how persistent you are with your search.&nbsp; If you are careful with your planning and know Astoria is where you want to move, start looking at least a month and half before or else you are just gonna have to take whatever you cant get.<br /><br />You cant expect the real estate agents to call you to follow up, because many of these people dont event get much of a cut from the fee they charge you, and they have tons of other people calling them to find a place.&nbsp; I must have met every real estate agent in astoria (seriously), and I made a list and would call them every monday to check what they had, or check on their websites.&nbsp; It took me 3 months and I must have seen about 60+ apartments.&nbsp; If you have the time then you can really find a good deal, craigslist is by far the best source.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sometimes just walking in to the real estate offices on a sat afternoon helps, because something always pops up (like a cute $950 small 1br i saw right by 35th and 30th ave one time).&nbsp; Its a renters market, and if people are paying right up front what the landlords want, then landlords are only going to demand more $$.&nbsp; Also, a good real estate agent will NEGOTIATE on your behalf, most of the time every apartment is negotiable (unless its already under market value and has lots of renovations).&nbsp; However be mindful of the &quot;I can get it down $50 less if you sign a 2 year lease&quot; schemes.&nbsp; <br /><br />People&#039;s experiences will probably vary with agent and agency, important is to find an agent you like, that is patient and that knows what you need and wont waste your time showing you stuff that is not for you.&nbsp; That being said you still have to call them and follow up and cant expect that they are going to be calling you.&nbsp; The early bird catches the worm not the one that was waiting for the worm to pop up.<br /><br />*S*

				I have to say, in looking for a place recently in the Broadway area, City Stop and Global City were great.&nbsp; Astoria Realty and Grace were not.&nbsp; MQ and Metropolis were shady and sketchy.&nbsp; I was really dissappointed in Grace Realty especially when everything I had read about them was how great they were and how committed Grace was to Astoria and making her customers happy.&nbsp;

				MQ Realty are the WORST.&nbsp; Not only will they ask you for alot of personal information prior to even showing you a place, sometimes they require you to leave a deposit at the same time.&nbsp; Not to mention that their finders fee is the highest by far, something like 15% of a years rent or something like. . . a month and a half!

				I would have to recommend Nick from Metropolis Realty. He got both my boyfriend and I on the lease, even though my boyfriend&#039;s credit is BAD and they only ran my credit. At the time, I was still living in California and was in town to apartment hunt, and the job I had lined up was in low-paying retail. Also, he thought he could negotiate the rent down with the landlord and was almost certain he&#039;d win. When the landlord said no, Nick knocked off a couple hundred bucks from his broker fee! It was worth it for us because of the difficult credit and income situation, and he managed to hook us up.

				First post, whoo. Figured I&#039;d toss in my two cents. My roommate and I tried three realtors:<br /><br />Halvatzis: We had Anna show us one apartment that wasn&#039;t very good. She was short and curt with us. YMMV on which realtor you get there, maybe.<br /><br />Carmela at Remax: Didn&#039;t actually meet her (seems like we&#039;re not the only ones to have this experience); we were led around by another lady who was honest but kind of obnoxious. At the last apartment we went to, there was a couple looking with us, and they told my roommate that we didn&#039;t need to go through a realtor. As it turns out, we went back and found the apartment listed on Craigslist under the &quot;no broker&quot; section. Classy move, Remax.<br /><br />Angelica at Capital: We&#039;re going through her to get our apartment. Aside from being a little jumpy, she was fairly helpful.<br /><br />Hope that helps anyone else looking around..

				Regarding Angelica -she charged me $100 for a security deposit once, and it wasn&#039;t until later that I learned they only cost $20-30, and some realtors are ok if you bring your own with you.&nbsp; She pocketed the rest.&nbsp; She also rents for Pistilli, and that was the apartment I ended up with bedbugs in.&nbsp; &nbsp;They both take key deposits which are also illegal.&nbsp; My point - she&#039;s shady.

				I think you mean $100 for a <em>credit report</em>, not security deposit?&nbsp; If so, $100 is criminal.&nbsp; They pay a flat fee for unlimited credit checks per year, usually a few hundred dollars per year.&nbsp; Even charging $20-$30 (which is average) is a huge markup.&nbsp; I have always brought my own credit report and have insisted I would not pay the fee and have never been charged.&nbsp; If you do that, make sure you bring your credit report and FICO score.&nbsp; Most can&#039;t understand the credit report anyway, and simply want to judge based on the FICO number, which you have to order at the same time you get your report and sometimes cost a few dollars more.&nbsp;

				Hi, everyone!&nbsp; :-)<br />I just registered to this site and I must say that I am very glad I discovered it. Like a number of you in this thread, I&#039;m planning to move to Astoria by August 1st and have worried a bit over how to go about it.&nbsp; The advice and references regarding brokers that I&#039;ve read here has been invaluable: I&#039;ve taken lots of notes and have a few names that I&#039;ll be calling first.<br /><br />My initial thought was to avoid going through a broker at all and thereby try to save on the inevitable fee, but I think I just can&#039;t swing that this time. My two previous NY apartments, my current one included, were lucky finds placed by the owners on Craig&#039;s List - but I just don&#039;t think I can make that magic happen a third time. Especially since I&#039;m currently enrolled in an intensive summer language program that has me in a classroom during business hours five days a week, with substantial assignments and weekly exams, the preparation for which dominates most evenings. Hence: I have almost no time at all to go apartment hunting on my own; at least, no time for the persistence needed to find a good, within-budget constraints, no-fee place. If I can work with an honest broker that can find apartments that meet my criteria, I can certainly fit appointments into my schedule: I just can&#039;t go chasing vague, mostly anonymous listings.<br /><br />Some of the other advice I&#039;ve found in here (such as bringing one&#039;s own credit report so as to avoid the &#039;credit check&#039; fee that may or may not be way overcharged) is also great stuff to know about.&nbsp; (One question about BYO Credit Report: Does it HAVE to have the FICO number on it?? I think I got my free credit report without paying the bit extra for the actual score. Do you guys think a broker/ landlord will be likely to accept that?)<br /><br />Perhaps I should include some more info about me in case anyone out there has any leads: I&#039;m a Ph.D. candidate in Art History/ Archaeology looking for a Studio/ 1 Bedroom either near the last three stops on the N/W or the Steinway G/R/V.&nbsp; I will be teaching at Hunter College in the Fall and really need an easy commute to the Upper East Side.&nbsp; I say &quot;really need&quot; in that last sentence because my commute for the last year has been a 1.5 hour trek from Jamaica Queens, and I just cannot live this far away from school/work anymore.&nbsp; 3 hours a day in transit? I know one can read on the bus/ train: but not when you&#039;re packed into an E or F train like a sardine during rush hour!&nbsp; It just doesn&#039;t work.<br /><br />My budget isn&#039;t great: about $1000 max.&nbsp; Some people I have spoken with have said it should be easy to find a studio/ 1br for $1000 or even less, but I haven&#039;t seen much on Craig&#039;s List lately: It has actually been a bit discouraging the last few weeks.&nbsp; I&#039;m crossing my fingers a broker can help me find somewhere clean and quiest without my having to compromise my budget limits. I don&#039;t even really need that much space: it&#039;ll just be me and all my books. OK: So my books need a bit of room...&nbsp; :wink:<br /><br />Any advice or info would be greatly appreciated, especially about that Credit Report question: Do they need the FICO number, or can a clean FICO-less report speak for itself?&nbsp; (I&#039;m sure I have excellent credit, I just don&#039;t know my number) Also: Can I black out some of the more personal information?&nbsp; From what little I know of apartment applications, they ask for your SSN, Mother&#039;s Maiden and all sorts of other stuff that I frankly feel extremely nervous giving out to numerous people during an apartment search. How much of that can I keep private without making the broker or landlord just not want to deal with me?<br /><br />So thanks again, Hello to All, and I look forward to being a part of this community (online and, hopefully soon, in life)!<br />-Rose<br /><br />

				Rose,<br /><br />First of all, welcome to the board.&nbsp; Check out the Hello thread in the Local Chat and say &quot;hi&quot; to.&nbsp; Second, I had a similiar budget and I thought I would never be able to find anything in the area. Despite my initial reluctance and general disdain for realtors, I broke down and went to several agencies.&nbsp; My budget was similiar to yours and even less and everyone I knew told that I would never find a place.&nbsp; Fortunately, I met George at Century 21 on 23rd Avenue, close to the Ditmars train station and he found me a place that was within my range. I saw numerous places under one thousand and I settled on my current apartment.&nbsp; Good luck and let us know how it turns out!

				Dear Astoria Luv,<br /><br />Thanks for the welcome and reply! I will definitely go find the Hello thread: thank you for telling me about it.<br /><br />I have seen that quite a few people here have recommended George at Century 21/ Alexiou; I actually put four little stars next to his name and number on my notepad here! He&#039;s at the top of my list of people to call on Monday.<br /><br />And while I know in my head that everything will work out, my gut is still nervous. I guess there&#039;s nothing calm about moving, no matter what your situation.&nbsp; But in the end I know it will be worth it: I have a number of friends living in Astoria already and all of them rave about it all the time. I&#039;m also especially happy about the family atmosphere it seems to have. Both of my NY apartments so far have been direct from owner with a real family/ familiar vibe, and I&#039;d like to find that sort of small community feel again.<br /><br />And be sure that I&#039;ll be back to inform of any developments.&nbsp; I&#039;ll say again that I&#039;m really glad I found this website: I am a huge fan of community interaction and it is really wonderful to know that Astoria has this resource and is full of people looking out for each other.<br /><br />Cheers!

				I moved to Astoria in &#039;87 and lived in the top floor of a three-family, owner-occupied home on 32nd between Broadway &amp; 34th.&nbsp; &nbsp; One piece of advice I&#039;d give anyone, especially if you plan to stay in Astoria, is get a rent stablized place.&nbsp; &nbsp;I didn&#039;t have any protection and back in &#039;01 when the &quot;Times&quot; ran a big article about how wonderful a place Astoria was to live.&nbsp; &nbsp; The landlords, of course, got greedy and the owner of the place I lived wanted to raise my rent by $800 a month (he was the third owner of the place since I lived there).&nbsp; Rents went through the roof after that article appeared.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I had to move and ended up in a rent stablized place on 34th Street between 28th &amp; 30th, but wished I moved here&nbsp; or at least in a rent stablized place back in &#039;87 when it was easy and cheap (I paid $600 for a two bedroom place and got it the day I looked) to get an apartment in Astoria.<br /><br />I had some interesting experiences when I looked in &#039;01.&nbsp; &nbsp;I specified I wanted a big one-bedroom apartment near the subway.&nbsp; &nbsp; These clowns I went to see showed me places too far from the subway or too small.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some of the stuff I saw was hilarious.&nbsp; &nbsp;There was this one place that had this closet.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I opened the closet I bet it wasn&#039;t even 6 inches deep.&nbsp; &nbsp;I couldn&#039;t figure why they even bothered making it a closet and then what you could fit in there.&nbsp; &nbsp;You couldn&#039;t hang clothes and the shut the door.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was bizarre.<br /><br />Another guy showed me a place right on 31st Street, a little too close to the subway.&nbsp; &nbsp;The front window looked out onto the platform of the 30th Street subway station.&nbsp; &nbsp; I said thanx but no thanx.<br /><br />Another guy, an old timer on Broadway who got me my first apartment in &#039;87, was still there at the real estate place.&nbsp; &nbsp;He sent me to this place on 35th Street a block from where I am now and said &quot;You&#039;ll sign the lease for x amount, but actually have to pay y amount.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;What I would pay would be less than what was on the lease.&nbsp; &nbsp;It had something to do with rent stabilization laws.<br /><br />And the firm who got me the apartment was on the north side 31st Avenue between Steinway and 38th.&nbsp; &nbsp;The broker was actually pretty good and told me he was showing an apartment &quot;in the best building in Astoria and that if that didn&#039;t satisfy me then he couldn&#039;t help me.&quot;&nbsp; He told me to come back the next day a Sunday when he showed it.&nbsp; &nbsp; I get there and get in the broker&#039;s car and there is this other guy with me who is also looking at the apartment.&nbsp; &nbsp; It was kind of awkward to say the least because both us were under the impression that we would be alone with the broker and get the apartment if we liked.&nbsp; &nbsp;To make me feel even worse the guy was looking for a place to live with his father and the father required a building with an elevator.&nbsp; &nbsp; This building has an elevator.&nbsp; &nbsp; We get there and I got the apartment, but from what I understand they were looking at nine or 10 people and I &quot;wasn&#039;t number one on the list&quot; for the apartment.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t know if no. 1 didn&#039;t check out when they did the credit check or if they didn&#039;t want the apartment, but I ended up getting it.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />And did the woman who works in the real estate market lord over the poor broker.&nbsp; &nbsp;Did he suck up to her.&nbsp; &nbsp;She was a little tyrant.

				Hello.<br /><br />I just returned from Astoria, lease in hand, thanks to Kim at Halvatzis Realty. She was only realtor who seemed to realize that she was working for me and not doing me a favor by taking a month&#039;s worth of rent. I don&#039;t even have a full-time job yet, but she emphasized my good credit and my savings and my prior professional accomplishments to the landlord.<br /><br />Prior to my visit to Halvatzis, I met with Angela at Metropolis Realty. She seemed friendly enough, though I never got beyond one apartment viewing.<br /><br />Alexiou Realty was a problem, not because I thought they were shady, but because they seemed sort of old-school. Though I explained that I had excellent credit and enough money in the bank to cover several months&#039; rent up front (with bank statements to prove it), the realtor just rolled his eyes. He even waved off talk of a cosigner. I&#039;m not suggesting you avoid this broker, but unless you have a steady 9-5 gig, it probably won&#039;t be worth it. They seem as conventional as you can get.<br /><br />Then there&#039;s Angelica at Capital Realty. A few minutes before our appointment she called me—and she always calls on this incoherent cell phone; it&#039;s like this jittery transmission from outer space—and asked what my price range was. Funny, I had told her that already. When I repeated the figure, she said there was nothing available. I mean, I had just confirmed the appointment not two hours earlier. I can&#039;t say I worked long enough with her to have a truly informed opinion, but, yep, something felt off about this woman.

				The only way you can get rent <em>controlled</em> is if a family member passes and existing rent controlled unit on to you.&nbsp; There are roughly 50,000 such units in NYC.<br /><br />Since that applies to, like, nobody, it is safe to assume that any apartment presented to you as such is actually rent <em>stabilized</em>, which means that 1) your rent can only increase by a certain percentage each time you renew and 2) you have the right to renew the lease if you want, except in very specific circumstances (like the landlord wants to put his family in the unit).&nbsp; See the Rent Stabilized faq at http://www.housingnyc.com/html/resources/faq/rentstab.html (http://www.housingnyc.com/html/resources/faq/rentstab.html) or, more generally, the entire site at http://www.housingnyc.com/ (http://www.housingnyc.com/) is pretty f-ing awesome.<br /><br />If you are unsure as to whether a broker is telling you the truth about a building, call 718.739.6400 or 212.961.8930 to find out.&nbsp; Please note that some buildings are overall stabilized, but individual units within may not be.&nbsp; So if a broker says &quot;the <em>building</em> is stabilized,&quot; make sure to get clarification on whether the <em>unit</em> is.

In order for you to become the legally recognized tenant of a rent controlled apartment, you must first prove that you are related to the legal (now deceased) renter and that you have lived there continuously for at least six months prior to the death of the original renter.<br /><br />Trust me, you don&#039;t want a rent controlled apartment. These apartments have no leases, the tenants are responsible for defraying the cost of fuel to the whole building, their rents, by State law, increase 7.5% (minimum) every year. <br /><br />Whereas a rent stabilized apartment has a lease, and only has to deal with 3%–5% increases every two years. Many, many of those estimated 50,000 controlled apartments are now paying more than their rent stabilized next door neighbors who have new stoves and refrigerators and totally refurbished bathrooms. <br /><br />I moved into my apartment in 1964 when the rent was $92.16. Starting in 1970 I have received annual increases of at least 7.5% and in some years as high as 13%. You do the math. My apartment doesn&#039;t need to be registered with DHCR, and they don&#039;t have a clue what my rent SHOULD be! <br /><br />Rent stabilized apartments MUST be registered with DHCR and they will protect your interests if it is not. If you live in a building of less than 6 apartments you are at the mercy of the building owner. Check your lease . . . if it says that your apartment is stabilized . . . verify that with DHCR. Someone in my building did that, and discovered that her apartment hadn&#039;t been registered by our unscrupulous landlord. She filed for an overcharge, her rent was formally decreased by 50%, and she was awarded almost $40,000 in overage and damages. She will be living rent-free for the next 5 years!

				Hi, I&#039;ve been living on the LIC/Astoria border for 9 months and have to decide whether to renew my lease by the end of the month. I&#039;d like to move up near 30th ave or Ditmars to be near the nice shops and things. But I&#039;m nervous about giving the 60 days notice I need to give and then not finding anywhere better to live. I can pay up to $1300/month for a 1 bedroom. If I start looking in mid-October do you think I&#039;ll be ok? I don&#039;t want to walk more than 5 minutes to the train. Thanks for any advice you can offer.

				I would think that November and December first move-in dates would be a hell of lot easier to look for than any date in the summer, because you are competing with much less people.&nbsp; Plus $1300 is a good amount of money for a one-bedroom, and I don&#039;t think you&#039;d have any problem finding a place for that price.&nbsp; I would hope you could find something cheaper in the fall.

				Hey guys,<br /><br />The best place to go for apartments in Astoria would be Astoria Apartments. They are located on ditmars and 31 street I believe. They are great. The agent that helped me was John. He was very easy going, and they stand by their apartments. <br /><br />Best thing about the staff is they view the apts and know what they are about before they take you there. Others in Astoria have shown me garbage and waste of my time. <br /><br />Pass by the office ask for John or call him at 917-361-7050 and tell him Tiff sent you. Im sure he&#039;ll be pleased. Im sure its ok that I posted his number on here since Im saying nothing but good things about his services.<br /><br />End result. He found me a great apt and their fee is one months rent. You cant beat that. Others have asked for 2months, thats crazy!<br /><br />Tif

				I want to add my 2 cents about MQ Realty. Horrible horrible experience with them. The broker took phone calls the whole time we were looking at apartments, sometimes talking up the same apartment while we were with him looking at it. We went to one apartment where someone else from MQ was showing another couple the apartment at the same time, and they both told us &quot;Oh, look how popular this apartment is, better put cash down NOW if you want it!&quot;. Totally high pressure sales tactics, always saying &quot;Well, if you like this one, we better go back to the office and put cash down now or it&#039;ll be gone by the end of the day&quot; if we indicated the slightest interest in the apartment. Also tried to upsell us by showing us apartments $150 over our price range. They also charged us a month and a half broker fee. Told us stuff like the apartments we were looking at were pet friendly when they were not. Told us our credit was bad (really, 700 is bad?) and told us we had to put an extra month&#039;s deposit down on the apartment. We had to pay the whole deposit (first month, security deposit, extra month and broker fee) in cash, upfront, before they even let us talk to the landlord. Stay far away.

				I just recently rented a 1 bedroom apt in Astoria, I tried Craigslist first, but there was nothing there at all and it was hopeless. So I then decided to go thru a Real Estate Agency and with the help of this site I was able to pick some. For ANYONE looking for a good real estate, here is what I recommend:<br /><br />1. Mary from <strong>Astoria Apartments</strong> on 31st St and Ditmars Blvd is AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!!!!! Unfortunately I didnt get my apt through her, which I wish I did bc she was wonderful. DEF GO TO HER!<br /><br />2. Nick from <strong>Metropolis</strong> was great at first. But never followed through. I called him quite a few times about an apt he showed me that I was interested in and he never called me back and I never heard from him ever again. I do NOT recommend him<br /><br />3. Kim from <strong>Halvatzis</strong> was great! She knew what she was talking about. Very professional! I recommend her!<br /><br />4. <strong>Grace Realty</strong> HORRIBLE!!!!!&nbsp; I went there to view a few 1 bdrms and they double booked me with another person looking for a one bdrm.<br /><br />5. <strong>Global Realty</strong> was great! I actually got my apt from them. The one day they took me out was the same day I found my apt. They were very professional.<br /><br />All these agencies above charge one months rent for their services. If you ever go to someone who charges more JUST WALK OUT!<br /><br />I heard <strong>MQ </strong>and <strong>ReMax</strong> was horrible from friends that went to them a month ago, so I didnt try them. <br />I had an appointment with Angelica from <strong>Capital</strong> but canceled bc I found an apt already. She sounded nice on the phone, and knew what she was talking about. But then again I never met her so who knows. <br />I visited <strong>Zikos Realty</strong>, left my info, never heard from them. <br />I called <strong>Century 21</strong>, left a message, never heard from them. <br />I made an appt with Jay from <strong>Taichi Realty </strong> to view an apt but he canceled an hour before I was going to go see it bc it was rented already. He called me the next day to see that same apt which he told me was rented already. I had already rented something so I never picked up the phone. <br /><br />I hope this helps everyone! This site DEF helped me! Thanks everyone for sharing their info.

				Am I the only one who didn&#039;t have such a bad experience with MQ?&nbsp; I used them twice - the first time, they were on the pushy side as others have reported, but I figured that&#039;s just how the whole broker thing works.&nbsp; The apartment I got was good, in a great location, but kinda old and after 2 years I had a bigger budget and wanted a nicer place.&nbsp; But overall, I was satisfied with using MQ.<br /><br />The second time I used them, which was this summer, I contacted them after seeing a listing on Craiglist for a place that looked amazing and was within my budget (albeit at the high end of it).&nbsp; I saw the place, fell in love, and put down a deposit that day, with no pressure from MQ.&nbsp; This was 2 months before the lease on my old place was up so I had the luxury of time and knowing exactly what I wanted.<br /><br />I dunno, maybe I just lucked out, especially considering that Craigslist posts are a crapshoot.&nbsp; But with any broker I would give the advice to give yourself time when you look for a place if you can.&nbsp; That way, you are in the driver&#039;s seat and don&#039;t feel as pressured by broker-speak.

				I&#039;m obviously going against the grain here but I absolutely felt duped by Astoria Apartments.&nbsp; He talked up this great, huge apartment with everything brand new that was out of our price range but was all utilities included so it was definitely worth it.&nbsp; I walked into the place and felt like I was in the slummiest of slums.&nbsp; Not one damn thing was new.&nbsp; &nbsp;I felt like I dealt with a used car salesman who tried to pawn off lemons.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t believe he would expect ANYONE to step foot into that dump and become enamored with it even by not looking at it for what it was but for the possible potential it may have.&nbsp; I saw on craigslist that they have it listed as having brand new hardwood floors.&nbsp; Totally not the case as each room I believe had a different type of floor unless they put all new floors in in the past week.&nbsp; <br /><br />They placed a follow-up call to me the other day and said they had something else.&nbsp; Again, talked it up as though it was something of epic proportions and I called him on it.&nbsp; I said I hope it&#039;s nothing like the brand new dump I was shown last time.&nbsp; He basically then said that I wouldn&#039;t like this one then and we called it a day.&nbsp; I doubt I&#039;ll be called again.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to have to go the broker route, but if I&#039;m going to, I rather deal with a genuine broker and not someone out to make commission on me and give me s___ to live in.&nbsp; I was appalled.<br /><br />Kim at Halvatzis is currently looking for us.&nbsp; I hope we have as much great luck with her like I see the majority of you have.&nbsp;

				I know City Stop Realty was mentioned a few times in the earlier thread, but I would like to put in a good word for them.&nbsp; Kimberly was excellent to me and my boyfriend.&nbsp; She found us a 2 bedroom that we wanted, but when the owner/landlord (and his mother) started laying out ridiculous rules (like all windows must be shut when we are out of the apartment, even in the middle of August) and changed the price, she quickly moved us along to another place which ended up being perfect (and cheaper).&nbsp; She always called back when she said she would (a rarity in realtors) and moved everything through with very little hassle.&nbsp; Hope that helps!

				I met the elusive Carmela!!<br /><br />I&#039;m currently looking and have talked to several different brokers but not yet found a place (I&#039;m looking for 2/15-3/1, so I started a little early). Carmela seemed nice, but the place she showed me was definitely not too good to be true (although it was reasonably priced for what it was). I&#039;ll be checking in with her in a few weeks to see if she has anything else.

				I was reading what everyone wrote about brokers and it was very helpful. I am currently looking for a 1 bedroom apartment and have never worked with a broker before so some of my questions may sound silly. I read that some people work with multiple brokers. Do you get charged the fee only if you find a place? Also, how far ahead should you start looking at apartments? I wanted to move in March.<br /><br />Thanks again everyone!

				Hello! First time poster. I find it funny how there&#039;s been some talk of a Liz at Metropolis. I wonder if this is the same broker that just found my place? Although the Liz I recently worked with was not at Metropolis. Is she a blonde? Also had some fishy experiences with Zen Realty. If only I had discovered this website earlier! What a great site!

				I had a legitimate recommendation for John at Astoria Apartments from a friend of mine. I really liked their place, too, but ended up finding something before he could show me anything. <br /><br />You very well might be turning brokers off by telling them you&#039;re not ready to move for a while. The real estate market here is so quick, you can&#039;t start looking two months in advance, or even one month. It&#039;s a waste of their time (and yours) to have them take you around to places they know you won&#039;t take because you&#039;re not ready to move. <br /><br />As for who you should call next, I recommend Kim at Halvatzis (she found my last place), Jay at Tai Chi (he found my current place) and Soula at Buy-Sell (she showed me a place I LOVED but my then-roommate shot it down because parking would have been awful).

				I&#039;d also recommend Jenna from Astoria Apartments. Not only does she have a great attitude, but she really listened to what I was looking for and didn&#039;t waste my time showing me &quot;crap&quot; places. Jenna really worked to get my move in date pushed back, and because of her great relationship with the landlord, it was successful. She also stayed late to show me places on her husband&#039;s birthday, and was also late to dinner with her husband as she was making sure I had all my questions answered about the lease. The process was smooth and easy, and Jenna is a RARE find in Astoria brokers (trust me... I&#039;ve been thru MQ - horrible, Metropolis - eh, Capital - terrible, Astor - unreliable, etc). <br /><br />Jenna. Astoria Apartments. Go. <br /><br />And no - I&#039;m not a spammer. Tell her Melissa sent you.

				I just have to second the last post about Nick from Metropolis. Total sketchball. The last time I moved, he showed my roommate and I&nbsp; a 2BR that we loved and immediately put a deposit on. He told us the rent was $1600, which was the most we were willing to spend (in 2005). As our moving date got closer and closer and we didn&#039;t hear anything more from him, I called a couple of times to find out when we could go sign the lease, pay the rest of the 1 mo + security, etc. He assured me not to worry about it, said the apartment was definitely ours, he has known the owners forever, we&#039;d do all the paperwork and money stuff a few days before we were supposed to move. We went in to do all of that 4 days prior to moving, and lo and behold, the landlords were actually charging $1800, not $1600. Nick claimed he had no idea they were charging $1800. The landlord claimed he had never agreed to rent for $1600 and that Nick knew that when he showed us the place and took our deposit. When we refused to pay an extra $200/month, he &quot;negotiated&quot; to $1700. We said 1600 or bust and walked away from the apartment. Nick was all apologies, claimed it was a terrible misunderstanding and promised he would find us something else wonderful within the week. Never heard from the guy again. My gut feeling was that he thought he&#039;d be able to talk us up the $200 knowing that we had only 4 days to find another place. Lucky for us, we did find a great place that week, for even less $$, with Chris from Realty 2000.<br /><br />I also want to agree with all the posters who said that Kim at Halvatzis was great. She was incredibly helpful and very patient, unfortunately, she just didn&#039;t have anything cat friendly at the time. The next time I move, she&#039;ll be the first one I call.

				I have nothing but great things to say about Kim from Halvatzis. I just got an apartment through her and she was very honest with me, which I appreciated. She only had two things in my price range at the moment and told me that, and said I likely wouldn&#039;t like one as it was basement. The apartment I ended up taking is MUCH better than I thought I&#039;d be getting for $1400, and although it&#039;s a no pet building, since Kim is friendly with the landlord,&nbsp; I was able to get my lease amended and didn&#039;t even have to pay a pet deposit for my cat! She also took the time to drive me around to show me the train, the grocery store, the closest yoga studio, etc. I brought all my needed paperwork, and the entire leasing process took less than an hour -- Kim was very efficient. I think she&#039;s excellent.

				Lurker, first-time poster here. Decided that I should reply since I used the criticisms and advice from this thread to fuel my broker search. I&#039;m moving back to NY with my husband and cat, and have settled on Astoria. We went up a couple of weeks ago and met two brokers (saw four apartments). Since returning home and haunting this thread, we&#039;ve changed our minds and are working with Mary from ReMax. Here&#039;s our story:<br /><br />NY Finest Real Estate (Forest Hills) - Cute office, cute lady. Bad attitude and no change. We had to supply our own quarters to pay for her daily rent-a-car to park. Tacky in my out-of-state opinion. She introduced us to Lionel of J C Management or Coco Realty. That&#039;s about the only good thing she did. She advertises herself as a realtor, but operates like a broker - being that her main source of income is Craig&#039;s List.&nbsp; :-(<br /><br />J C Management (31st Ave Astoria) - Nice office, sarcastic employees but fun atmosphere. We are working with Lionel who seems fairly reputable with just about everyone in Astoria. So far has been pleasant to work with, but I&#039;m getting tired of hearing sentences with the word &quot;tomorrow&quot; in it. We have to move by July 1 and the sands of time are flowing . . . I got nervous and fell to the mercy of this thread and Mary of ReMax.<br /><br />ReMax (Astoria) - Seems to know her stuff. Very nice and willing to work with out-of-staters, which is a blessing since I&#039;d lose my lunch if I had to fork over more money for another rape date with LaGuardia. <br /><br />Will post an update once I have one. Waiting on promised email, which Lionel told us we&#039;d get &quot;tomorrow&quot;.&nbsp; :x

				I&#039;ve seen a couple of people here vouch for <strong>Mary</strong> from <strong>Remax</strong>, and I couldn&#039;t agree more. This was my very first experience hunting for an apartment here in New York City. I found one of her listings on craigslist and called her. She&#039;s a really, really nice person, knows her stuff, doesn&#039;t seem like the stereotypical pushy sales-person that&#039;s only looking for their own interests at all. When we first spoke, she said she would make everything painless, and she totally delivered on that promise.<br /><br />Like I said, this was my first experience looking for a place to live, and she made it so easy! I don&#039;t know how it goes with others, so my experience is limited, but seriously, if down the road I&#039;ll need to find some other place to live, she&#039;ll be the first one I&#039;ll call. Fully recommended.<br /><br />Mary (Remax): 917-596-3671

Rosa from NY Finest Real Estate had the audacity to send us an email complaining about having to work with us for a day when she didn&#039;t have anything in Astoria to show us. Lionel with Coco/JC couldn&#039;t pull through. After giving the man $200 cash, then more credit check/deposit checks totaling $600 and STILL had no budge on a lease approval, we gave up. The last excuse was that his boss got in a fight with the boss of the management company and he wasn&#039;t able to submit our app and deposit. If we don&#039;t get the cashier checks back made out to Dermot (the mgmt co), you can bet I&#039;ll be picketing outside of their office on 30th and 31st. The silver lining is, Dermot is a POS company anyway. After tens of failed craig&#039;s list attempts and broker calls, we discovered a listing on CL from Angelica at Capital Realty. Yeah, we called her at 1 p.m. and had the apartment by 4 p.m. So, uh, yeah, all those other brokers sucked.&nbsp; :evil:<br /><br />(except for Mary from ReMax who didn&#039;t have what we were looking for, but she was very courteous and prompt regardless.)<br /><br />I can&#039;t wait to be more than a visitor!&nbsp; :lol:

				Okay, finally we&#039;re Astorians. Jeez, ya&#039;ll have this place Fort Knox&#039;d.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />Angelica Capital Realty got us the place with one month&#039;s broker fee. I found a short Craig&#039;s List ad with two ridiculously small pictures, so don&#039;t discount those oddball CL posts that may not give you all the information you want. I&#039;d rather be told nothing than to be spoken to in hyperbole. <br /><br />3510 Broadway Ste 2-201<br />Long Island City, NY 11106-1150<br />Phone: (718) 278-0200<br /><br />Surprisingly enough, she has bad Citysearch reviews but I sometimes chalk those up to people not getting what they want when they want it. NYC apartment searching is hard. I was told it was hard, but didn&#039;t realize how hard until I started. It&#039;s nearly impossible and the only reason I think I was able to do it at the last minute is because we have family here that looked at our apt for us. It works out for the best when it works.

				Interestingly enough when we were searching for a place 4 years ago, she was the one who we used, because of the fact that she only charged a months fee, but also because she said she would find us what we wanted, and she did. We saw the place, which needed a good scrubbing, sort of fell in love with it, and signed the lease less than an hour later. One of the big plusses is that it has two pretty damned big semi walk-in closets. And an eat in kitchen. And a backyard. Angelica is quirky to say the least, but at least she is honest.

				Historyteacher, it depends on your price range if you&#039;ll be able to afford the places Mary has to offer. My top was $1650 and she was telling me all apartments with elevator, laundry and live-in super were 1800+. Well, that wasn&#039;t true because I had just looked at a place for $1550 with all of that and then some. We wanted something around 30th, close to trains and she had mostly Ditmars. It&#039;s possible we were a mismatch. I would make more than just one appointment. I made that mistake when I came up mid-June. You really really need to be there to place the deposit and see the place you&#039;re signing off on for a year of your life. I had to rely on family and while it&#039;s not everything I had hoped for, it was well under my price range and in an awesome location. Good luck! Oh, and make sure you have all the proper documents with you! Ask each broker what&#039;s required.

				I&#039;ve only been inside JC Management, which uses Coco Realty&#039;s paperwork?!? There are plenty of people inside that building on 31st and 30th. We never had a problem reaching him, even when all Lionel had was bad news. The guy definitely hustles. <br /><br />I had a very easy, hassle-free time with Angelica Capital Realty. She charges just one month. No BS. I like my building, my super and my landlord. It&#039;s quiet and in a great neighborhood off Broadway. It depends on where you are looking. It seems like they are so many brokers that they must have a secret association meeting where they discuss who takes what block to pimp on Craig&#039;s List.<br /><br />Good luck. You&#039;ll find the right apartment at the last minute. My husband and I had packed all of our stuff in FL, had guys coming to move our stuff on Monday and we got an approval from Angelica on the Friday prior. It was nerve-wrecking to say the least.

				Hey<br />I&#039;m a total Astorians.com newbie, having lurked for a bit, and then built up the courage to post.<br /><br />I&#039;ll just throw out some of my experiences, to add to the mix.<br /><br />Angelica at, what is it, Capital? Or Angelica Realty? I don&#039;t know--I think the place is hers.<br />I had a tough time with her. It&#039;s probably a personal thing, but I&#039;m a pretty patient lady, and her flightiness was too much for me. She made an appointment with me to see a place a couple blocks from my current apartment, had me come to her office only to find she forgotten our appointment. After an hour and a half of waiting, (she actually sent me home, since the wait was going to be so long) she finally picked me up at my apartment (which I thought was very nice, actually), and took me to an apartment she had listed as being on Broadway, but was in truth between 30th and 31st Avenues. <br /><br />She then drove me back to her office, claiming that we would be seeing another apartment, but when we arrived she felt tired (it WAS 8:30 at this point) and offered to show it to me another day. This would have been fine, except that I was frustrated that she drove me away from my apartment, only to cancel the next viewing when we arrived at her office. I mean, I don&#039;t mind the walking, I just thought it was very strange, and rather annoying. <br /><br />She also kept forgetting which client I was, what I was looking for, and what my price range was. At one point she became &quot;playfully&quot; pushy and said &quot;go higher, go higher!!&quot; in regards to my upper limit for a one bedroom. She continued to pressure me to spend more, and was really unprofessional. It was a bit too much for me, although I suppose if she has a place you like, and you can handle her personality for a short time, she might be useful.<br /><br />Grace Realty is not quite my cup of tea either. I actually had a lovely conversation with Grace (once she found out I was studying to become a therapist) during which she disclosed some surprisingly personal information. She was very sweet, trusting, and certainly has a lot on her plate, but when it came to actually finding a place, she showed me one apartment and I never heard back from her again. My feeling is that she&#039;s not a malicious person by any means, but real estate might not be her biggest strength. Which is tough when the Realty is named after you.<br /><br />I&#039;ll keep you folks posted as to whom I next encounter! Or I may very well just vent--I make no promises&nbsp; :evil:<br /><br />&nbsp;

				hey all...i just found a place with carol constant on astoria blvd. and 28th street and she was fabulous! she worked her tuchis off to get my roommate and me a place and stayed within our price range, and was a joy to work with. she is a little brash [what one may call a &#039;broad&#039;, but we liked that kind of attitude] but didn&#039;t give us the run around and was completely straightforward with us. we didn&#039;t have to constantly call her to check up and she kept in contact with us the entire time, and even talked our new landlord down in his initial asking price. <br /><br />on the other hand, trying to work with andy @ venus realty on 31st ave. and 38th street was a really disappointing experience. he never returned my roommate&#039;s numerous phone calls, and once i finally pinned him down to show us an apartment, he never showed up [the entire office was deserted when i arrived for my appointment] and didn&#039;t even bother to call me until an hour and a half later to say he was available to show me a place then...no apology at all. yuck.<br /><br /><br />

				We&#039;ve had a number of experiences with various brokers in Astoria. We did the whole apartment search thing back in April and it took a lot of looking with lots of brokers to find a place we loved. The broker we used was George Rivera at East Hudson Realty. I think he branched off and started his own realty/brokerage so it&#039;s just him and he&#039;s very committed to finding you a place you&#039;ll love. He was flexible with us on viewing apartments and also in trying to find the amenities we were looking for. I highly recommend him, if/when we decide to move to a bigger place we&#039;ll definitely call him back.<br /><br />George Rivera<br />East Hudson Realty<br />31-19 30th Ave, 2nd Fl.<br />Astoria, NY&nbsp; 11102<br />(718) 956-0884<br />www.easthudsonrealty.com<br />

				From what I would assume, that is crazy Liz, formerly of Metropolis, now with Millennium. She&#039;s an absolute nightmare. I actually called her because I thought it might be a different Liz, and as soon as I met her, I realized she had switched companies.&nbsp; When I was looking for apartments, she was an hour and a half late to our appointment, showed me places that were not at all what I asked for, and that weren&#039;t pet-friendly when I specific told her I was ONLY interested in pet-friendly places, which we had discussed, at length, on the phone the day before.&nbsp; She&#039;s AWFUL. Even if she had showed me a place I liked, I never would have paid her a broker&#039;s fee because she did nothing to earn it.&nbsp; Seriously, avoid her at all costs.

				Thanks - I will make sure to stay away! While we&#039;re on the topic, another one to watch out for is Flora from Venus. Unless you enjoy being talked to like a four-year-old by a total moron who thinks she&#039;s some kind of celebrity, don&#039;t deal with this woman. She was the first broker I spoke to in Astoria and talking to her for 5 minutes was such a horrible experience that if not for all the other nice things I heard about the neighborhood, I would&#039;ve never kept looking for a place here.

				I recently found my first apartment in Astoria. Here&#039;s what I learned from the experience:<br /><br />1. Have all the documents you will need to rent a place prepared before you start searching. Including: W2s from past 2 years, two or three pay stubs, a letter of employment, bank statements, divers license (or other form of photo ID), references (phone numbers of friends, old landlords, etc.), and guarantor&#039;s info if necessary. You may also want to run your own credit report for free from one of the credit reporting websites to avoid this fee.<br /><br />2. Take some time to familiarize yourself with the neighborhood on google maps, or by walking around. Go all the way up and down 31st street, from LIC to Ditmars. <br /><br />3. It is possible to rent from owners, and anyone who has some time to search should begin this way. The by owner section of craigslist should do the trick, or look for open house signs in the neighborhood.<br /><br />3. If you are short on time, or cannot find any by owner rentals, using a broker is a reasonable choice. The STANDARD RATE for brokers in Astoria is one month&#039;s rent (~8% of a year&#039;s rent). If anyone charges you more than that, you should neotiate them down before signing a contract with the broker.<br /><br />4. We met with several brokers. I would recommend using multiple brokers, as they don&#039;t all have access to the same listings. Ask about specific details from their postings to make sure they aren&#039;t bs-ing. Be sure you don&#039;t sign any statements saying you cannot use other brokers in the area when you initially meet with brokers.<br /><br />- Angelica, whose office is on 36th and broadway, is a hot mess who consistently forgets important details (eg. how much we were willing to pay for an apt.) She posts exact locations, but her apartments are usually far away from where she says they are. <br />- Buy Sell Realty had excellent customer service, and was clean and professional. I wish we could have rented an apartment through them, but unfortunately they didn&#039;t have what we were looking for.<br />- We ended up using R&amp;R Realty (Richard and Rashida). They were very good, but tried to charge 11% for a broker&#039;s fee. We negotiated it down.<br /><br />5. See as many apartments as you can, even if they don&#039;t sound like exactly what you&#039;re looking for. You&#039;ll have a better idea of what is overpriced and what isn&#039;t if you just look at many apartments.<br /><br />In general astoria is safe, beautiful and a really nice place to live. I&#039;m happy with our decision to live here, and I hope these tips ease the stressful process of finding an apartment.<br />

				Well after posting on here about searching for a 3 bedroom, I began my horrid search on my own and with brokers.&nbsp; I have 2 dogs so this within itself is a nightmare&nbsp; :lol:.<br /><br />Now, I can 100 percent warm all Astorians and others as well to stay away from AIDA &amp; company from ....<br /><br />AIDA REALTY <br />44-06 30th Avenue<br />718 956 8000<br /><br />We walked in, no one spoke to us and then she walks in and looks at us.&nbsp; She is rude, cold and downright rude.&nbsp; We explained our situation and she precedes to give this face.&nbsp; She then starts flipping through her book and calling landlords.&nbsp; Without speaking to us, she starts telling them how we are willing to put down one an extra months&#039; deposit on an over 2K rent.&nbsp; <br /><br />I explained to her that I was born and raised here and as much as people may feel that Astoria is worth 2500, 3000 etc etc... we don&#039;t.&nbsp; She goes on to explain to me how it is, because it is &quot;clean&quot;.&nbsp; I explain to her that I understand why it is so much, but I don&#039;t agree and I don&#039;t want to go over 2K.&nbsp; After my husband heard her say about the extra deposit, we could hear that the landlord was objecting and she was pushing it.&nbsp; So my husband tells her that it is ridiculous.&nbsp; I questioned whether the landlord was Greek (since I am) and explained that most of the Greek landlords are old school and they will not want dogs in a private home in Upper Ditmars.&nbsp; <br /><br />I wanted to stay in the PS 70 vicinity which is around&nbsp; 42nd street and 30th ave. <br /><br />She called my husband &quot;thickheaded&quot;... he didn&#039;t appreciate it.&nbsp; I had him walk out with our son and I apologized because she is up the block from my home and I wanted her to keep us in mind.&nbsp; In any other scenario I would have told her where to put her apartments.<br /><br />She also told me how PS 70 is not a good school and the schools in Upper Ditmars are good.&nbsp; For myself, I check a school&#039;s stats not racial demographics.&nbsp; Keep in mind my daughter attends this school!&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br />My point is that she is rude and speaks down to you as if she is God&#039;s gift to all brokers.&nbsp; STAY AWAY!!&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I wish more realtors would take a cue from you.&nbsp; We have our suspicions about a few on here, and wish they&#039;d just be straight about it.&nbsp; Thank you!&nbsp; Someday when I win the lotto and I can afford a condo around here, or the market goes so low that a 200-300K 2 brm condo is common again (because I think this is a reasonable amount for a mid class single person to pay without bankrupting themselves), I will give you a call.&nbsp; Until then, I&#039;ll still be the lowly renter&nbsp; :cry:

				I dealt with the manager at Astoria Apartments (forget his name). I called about an apartment I had seen, but wasn&#039;t sure if I wanted it. He literally screamed at me over the phone and told me I had to come in immediately if I wanted it, and couldn&#039;t wait until I got out of work. The apt was pretty nice, but I still feel I was being pressured into it, and once I got to the office to put down a deposit, it turned out someone had put down a deposit the night before! (BEFORE I even spoke to him on the phone!) Huge waste of time, and I got no apology. Now I&#039;m glad it didn&#039;t work out and I&#039;m happy they didn&#039;t get any of my money.

				I had a very bad experience with the owner of that place when she used to work for a different agency.&nbsp; She was the official agent for a building I moved into.&nbsp; Let&#039;s just say she is no longer the agent for the building.&nbsp; She rented me an apartment without leaving her desk.&nbsp; Made me go to the building and told me to &quot;ring buzzers until someone let me in&quot; then I was told because my intended apartment was being renovated I could just walk in as there was no lock on the door.&nbsp; Of course, that apartment was already rented I later found out, I was sent back to con my way in again, and see another apartment, when...you guessed...that apartment was also not available when I said I wanted.&nbsp; I eventually got an apartment, went to her office to sign the lease which she handed me, took my deposit and went home for the day, telling me to leave the signed lease with the receptionist AFTER I made photocopies for myself on the office copier.&nbsp; I then found out, I had to go back to the building myself and ask the supers for the apartment key.&nbsp; I&#039;m leaving out the various lies she told about some situations in the buildings.<br /><br />After all that, I can&#039;t recommend her on principle.&nbsp; I feel bad for the agents working under her, but agents like that shouldn&#039;t be rewarded with a fee when there are harder working agents in the same neighborhood who deserve it.&nbsp;

				for the record, i worked with nick from metropolis.&nbsp; he was straightforward - he was showing me a crap apartment and he said it.&nbsp; i still had to check it out because it was in my price range and PERFECT location, but it really was a dump.&nbsp; <br /><br />i ended up getting the apartment through chantal at aamen realty... the broker fee is 10% of annual rent, which was higher than i wanted to pay, but honestly the apartment was such a great price that for the extra 200 dollar broker fee - it was worth it.&nbsp; she was extremely nice and honest and felt very comfortable.&nbsp;

				I just found my apartment using Astoria Apartments (couple doors down from Pizza Palace) on Ditmars.&nbsp; Jenna is who showed me apartments. I couldn&#039;t possibly say enough good things about my experience.&nbsp; She was very kind and understanding. She was really patient with me and my flaky 2nd roomate that never showed up. She kept me in mind for the apartments that were realistic for me.&nbsp; I felt like I made a friend more than met someone who just placed me in an apartment. It was really a pleasure to have met everyone in their office. Astoria is a great neighborhood, so if you are looking to move here, try Astoria Apartments and see Jenna!!!

				I would not recommend Astoria apartments realty at all. I have heard horror stories about their bait and switch tactics. From what I have heard from&nbsp; 5 differnent friends who used them they tell landlords one thing to get a tenant in and the tenant something different just to get them to sign, Then the terms change when it comes to sign everything from deposits, fees and terms.I would go with the Halvatis that sounds more consistent

				I just found a beautiful apartment with Jenna from Astoria Apartments... This was the second time I&#039;ve used her and I think if I ever have to move again I am going straight to her. I spent a long two weeks going through various craigslist posts, trying to avoid a broker&#039;s fee. Some were actually pretty decent but for the most part it was a nightmare. Even the decent ones just weren&#039;t good enough.. Either the neighborhood wasn&#039;t all that great or the landlord looked like a tight-ass. Anyway, my roommate and I decided to finally give up and go through a broker. I figured since I had used Jenna before, she would be our first try this time. We told her our budget and exactly what we were looking for (smoke/pet friendly, etc). She singled out the apartments she thought we would be interested in and showed us only three. All of them were great and we ended up taking the first one shown. We even got a nice little discount on the broker fee for being a second time customer&nbsp; :-) <br /><br />on a side note - when i found my last apartment through Jenna i also posted in here somewhere... There was a lot of talk about how so many people were &#039;one-time posters&#039; and there was suspicion that these mysterious one-timers were employees of Astoria Apartments. So I come back to the broker section of the forum again today (about a year and roughly 10 posts later) only to notice that people are still being warned about the post count of the people posting positive things about Astoria Apartments.. I just don&#039;t get it. I&#039;m not trying to be a poster boy for any broker or company or anything, just posting my experience and what I went through. Good luck house hunting everyone

He took his time to show me numerous apts. He even gave me a tour of astoria, lol , just so I can see what is around the apartment that I was interested in. Now if that is not a quality broker, i dont know what is. TWO THUMBS up for John from Astoria Apartments! And to the person that said astoria apts has apts far from the train , that is NOT TRUE!!

				I haven&#039;t moved in a few years but am looking for a new place....How negotiable are brokers fees these days. I really can&#039;t see paying one but maybe I&#039;m not being realistic?

				Hi, jr4266,<br /><br />Based on my recent experience studying the rental housing market in Astoria, the approach a person uses to procuring an apartment can be dictated most dramatically by how much time as well as money he or she has. For example, since we live in Pennsylvania and I work full-time, I searched the Internet late at night for leads on apartments and roommates that we could check out during a one-day blitz visit to NYC. I lined up six apartments for us to see through a broker for convenience. If we had chosen one of the apartments shown to us by the broker, we would have paid the equivalent of one month&#039;s rent to the broker and one month&#039;s rent as the security deposit immediately, and the first month&#039;s rent by August first. That is the price of convenience (!).<br /><br />If I had had more time, I would have tried lining up properties for which there was a &quot;middleman&quot; (locator company) because I figured that the company would have a vested interest in dealing with reputable landlords. (I know that that assumption may be naive.) My understanding is that you would have to contact the landlords directly and make appointments to see the apartments, but the locator companies provide a service by listing some properties that are exclusive to them and you can type in your criteria for location, price range, etc., so they are saving you the trouble of combing through the ads and making a list. Below are two companies that I found during my research (I am sure that there are more). I corresponded briefly with RDNY (rent-direct.com) and liked their tone and willingness to please. <br /><br />http://www.rent-direct.com/ - The last time that I checked their fee was $179 for 30 days&#039; complete access, but I think that they have raised it since then.<br /><br />http://www.nycapartmentlocators.com/ - $39.99 for six months unlimited access to database with LANDLORDS PHONE NUMBERS UNBLOCKED which is updated 24 hrs a day 7<br />days a week in real-time<br /><br />Of course, you can always make a list of broker-free apartments from craigslist and comb the on-line ads. Our ultimate &quot;winner&quot; was an apartment we found through an on-line ad with The Village Voice.

				For whatever its worth:&nbsp; My name is Chris and I rented in Astoria for something like 7 years before buying a 3 family building also in Astoria.&nbsp; Employment took me out of NY, but I still keep and rent the building.&nbsp; I first had experience with George Halvatzis when buying the building, and found George to be good and very reputable - he is a great guy.&nbsp; I&quot;m posting this now because I recently worked with Kim (I was looking for new tenants) @ halvatzis and I was really impressed with her work and professionalism.&nbsp; I strongly recommend Kim and encourage you to talk to her, if you are looking for a broker.&nbsp; <br /><br />Disclaimer: I&#039;m not being paid for this feedback and she doesn&#039;t know I&quot;m posting it.&nbsp; It is refreshing when you find people that are good at what they do...&nbsp; you want to tell people.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Chris

				K so finally posting...Im looking to move soon and I have noticed most of the realtors in the area do not have web sites, and certainly dont keep them maintained. (Its probably too much hassle?) So...have been walking around and I see so many realtors I cant find any information about. <br /><br />ie: Page Realty<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; and Evans Realty..<br /><br />Anyone have any info on either? They have signs up everywhere but I never hear about them?<br /><br />My wife and I have been in Astoria a year, Love it. Near 30th ave. (although I cant figure out why some of the restaurants are so ridiculously expensive) But&nbsp; with the economy, and our professions..we&#039;ve decided we need to get a smaller place.<br /><br />I was hoping not to pay a brokers Fee. Ive got 6 weeks..Does every realtor here charge a broker fee? I ask because i Brooklyn a lot of my friends went through Realtors but did not get charged a broker fee..the landlord pays that fee. (happened with 3 different people recently) That is also what I thought it was supposed to be prior to coming up here...LOL.<br />&nbsp;

				Re: Page Realty<br /><br />Not recommended from my experience. They managed (owned?) the building where they rented me an apartment and though the building was originally a lovely, solid building, it was terribly neglected. My upstairs neighbors regularly got leaks when it rained (the roof needed repairs), pipes burst and it took days to get cursory repairs and they wouldn&#039;t hire an exterminator. Oh, and the super was incompetent.

				wow the exterminator thing would piss me off to no end. It&#039;s such a simple and basic requirement. It&#039;s also the law.<br />Thanks for the heads up.<br /><br />Well, I dropped by Evans, they seem relatively new, at least their office is and their signs are up throughout the area. <br />It definitely had that salesman quality to it, but that&#039;s to be expected. Immediately all the notices that were recently made on craiglist from them for them seemed to have been &#039;already rented&#039;. Most likely bogus &quot;bait posts&quot;. Sure, also unfortunately, to be expected.<br /><br />The guy I spoke with was very up front, didn&#039;t want to waste our time or us to waste his. which I&nbsp; can also appreciate, I don&#039;t want to waste time myself, either. Anyrate, we agreed that I was looking a little too early before my move out if I was unwilling to throw a lot of the money down and seal it up. After all, August 1st is rolling around and its a good rent month. So we will resume communication in the near future. It may work out, and would be great if it does. But they do charge a broker fee. (1 month). Im confused about that, and really don&#039;t want to pay it. So still looking for an alternate route.<br /><br />I thought Id go ahead and share some of my EXP from my previous year if it helps others. <br /><br /><strong>Grace Realty</strong>: I read a lot of bad comments and a few neutral ones. I personally did not have any problem with them. Its true their fee was high, but when it came down to it, we needed what they just happened to have and we were in a situation where we had to take it. They were nice, and I thought it was a fine experience. If I have to pay another broker fee Id prefer to just go with them, but I would hope/expect for it to be less. If you know what you want (with any broker) then they can help you. <br /><br /><strong>MQRealty</strong> - they like to act like they are some high class Manhattan outfit. Sorry, Its Queens and I don&#039;t feel the requirements should be the same as far as income requirements and various other documentation. Their fee is also high. They do have a busy office though and they do get people places. We almost got a place with them in woodside last year, glad we didnt. It happened to be waaaaaaaaaay overpriced, which I now understand even more. That alone makes me suspicious. But things may have changed.<br /><strong><br />CraigsList</strong> - I gotta tell you, Its very very rare to actually find a listing that is actually true. So much BS on there these days. If you see something that turns ut to be false please Flag it. Generally though, I can honestly say after all the listings Ive ever searched and found on Craigslist for apartments here, Ive never seen one in person.&nbsp; I sincerely wish it wasn&#039;t so, it&#039;s just gotten worse with brokers posting listings. So do us all a favor and flag the ones you learn to be bogus. I do. Maybe it will be a useful resource again.<br /><br /><strong>Realtor websites</strong> <br />I guess its too hard for realtors to actually keep their websites updated? Or even have one?<br />As pleasant as the idea is to find it all online, your best chance is to walk in. Literally. Walk in to a realtor office if you are interested. you&#039;ll know pretty quickly if you want to work with them or not. And, don&#039;t be afraid to just get up and politely leave. ;)<br /><br /><strong>RentDirect</strong> Rent Direct was pretty cool service when I signed up for it, Last year. Unfortuately, I knew too little about the neighborhoods at the time to get as much use out of it as I can now. Unfortunately, I cant really afford the fee right now for it otherwise Id give it another go. It supposedly cuts out the middle man and has listings not found on craiglist and some the same as brokers. I may still give it a try, I dunno. I sure wish they would lower their fee..&nbsp; <br /><br />I may give ApartmentLocators a try..similar but cheaper (and less organized) than Rent Direct. Since Ive been here a while now I may find it useful.<br /><br />There are many realtors in Astoria, Im looking into more of them and hopefully will find a good match. I also hope to find a no Broker Fee or at least split fee APT.&nbsp; Im also trying to approach landlords myself and keeping an eye out for the &quot;For Rent&quot; signs.<br /><br />~---Crosses fingers and closes laptop..--

GOOD LUCK!!

				Since I mentioned id try them...<br />nycapartmentlocators is such a scam. Don&#039;t bother.<br /><br />I tried it out real briefly, within 5 minutes I could tell most (if not all) of it was bogus. <br />(and indeed called a few of the landlords listed who also told me the same)<br /><br />I knew I had paypal protection though. I will get my money back. Obviously, the service is not as advertised.<br /><br />RentDirect I know to be legit. However, you can try a free search first to get an idea of whats in the area you are looking for. <br />I haven&#039;t found stuff in the area I&#039;m looking for so it wouldn&#039;t make sense for me to use it this time..but that could change.<br /><br />and back to <br />Craigslist..well you are right so much sorting through BS (BullSh!t and Bait and Switch).<br />But gotta take that chance. If it gets down to the wire i guess its broker ville. But we are really going to try not to.<br />Im like looking for moving vans everywhere i go and they are prominent this time of year!&nbsp; :lol:<br /><br />

				oops-<br />nyrentsource.com is the one that&#039;s &quot;scammy&quot; I DID NOT even bother with nycapartmentlocators because I thought they were the same. Thought Id clear that up though. The pricing is different. Still if you decide to use anything similar Id recommend Rent-Direct, but only if you feel there are things in your neighborhood (through the free search).<br /><br />meanwhile we renegotiated with our landlord.

				I&#039;ve actually used MQ and really had no complaints about them but I guess I&#039;m in the minority.&nbsp; Admittedly, I was not price shopping in terms of broker fees so I didn&#039;t realize that they are more expensive than other brokers.&nbsp; When I move again I wouldn&#039;t be against using them again, but if another broker meets my specific requirements, I&#039;ll go elsewhere.&nbsp; It all comes down to meeting my needs.

				Hi folks,<br /><br />Just adding to the reviews here.&nbsp; My recent apartment search went a little something like this: was living in the Steinway area and wanted to stay around here but move into a place of my own. <br /><br />Based on the rave reviews for Kim at Halvatzis I figured I should call her first.&nbsp; She was organized and professional but it soon became clear she didn&#039;t have much inventory around the Steinway area - mostly Ditmars instead.&nbsp; I called Global City hoping to speak to Dina, who helped get me my first place in Astoria, but she no longer works there.&nbsp; I then called George at Century 21.&nbsp; He was nice as others have said but distracted at times and I got the sense that apartment rentals weren&#039;t his/their main business.&nbsp; Someone said he wasn&#039;t pushy and I can certainly back that up.&nbsp; Not pushy at all but kind of on the opposite side of that spectrum.&nbsp; <br /><br />The apartments he showed me were in the right neighborhood but it didn&#039;t quite work out so I called Aly from Aly&#039;s rentals and left a message.&nbsp; She never returned my call.&nbsp; Also called Astoria Apartments and got Awilda on the phone.&nbsp; She and I saw a host of apartments the next day. They did fit the criteria - right price range, right part of Astoria, also mostly prewar with high ceilings and wood floors.&nbsp; I saw two solid apartments that I liked very much, one that I flat-out adored. I&#039;m hanging out in it now having moved in two weeks ago and happy as can be.&nbsp; <br /><br />Overall thoughts/impressions? (A) Be clear on what you want (B) Be willing to call around a lot and see a lot of places - I&#039;m so glad I followed my friends&#039; advice and didn&#039;t just take the first place I thought was all right (C) Be organized and keep detailed notes of the financial transactions you engage in so you can make sure everything you&#039;re doing is within the budget you set out.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck to anyone who&#039;s apartment hunting now. Glad I don&#039;t have to go back out there for a while!

				Any thoughts on MQ REALTY?<br /><br />Any leads to Brokers who actually read and respond to e-mail?<br /><br />My friend would like to check out apartments Saturday near Bway and 31st train stops.

				yeah, stay FAR FAR away from MQ realty.&nbsp; I am not sure who is worse MQ or Evans Realty but I would avoid both like the plague.&nbsp; <br /><br />Take a look at Craig&#039;s list and see how they spam the site with pictures of the same apartment but with different rents/locations.&nbsp; &nbsp;They have been using the same pictures for years now.&nbsp; those apartments don&#039;t even exist.&nbsp; <br /><br />The only normal broker that I encountered and would even consider dealing with was Andreas from Steinway Realty.&nbsp; <br /><br />Millenium realty was a joke too.&nbsp; I had some lady (who was glowing orange) show me a place that was just starting to be gut renovated.&nbsp; I asked her what the rent was prior to going to the place and she wouldn&#039;t tell me.&nbsp; flag #1.&nbsp; She then told me that I should sign the lease on the spot b/c if I even waited an hour it would be gone.&nbsp; This was also on a sunday afternoon.&nbsp; what stupidity.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />These brokers are the true scum of the earth.&nbsp; It makes me want to open a real estate office and take all their money.<br /><br />oh and don&#039;t expect a single one of them to follow up and call you back.&nbsp; they are too lazy to even think about doing their job properly.&nbsp;

				Thanks. I&#039;ll give it a shot this weekend. I&#039;ve seen a total of 5 apartments and the majority were mis-represented by a long shot.&nbsp; I dont like liars or wasting time.&nbsp; I was in the process of selling my car and such so that took up time as well. <br /><br />I guess in reality Brokers dont send you addresses or pictures of the apartment via email before scheduling an appointment. <br /><br />Thanks again<br />

				I&#039;ve just gone through the process of renting a new apartment.&nbsp; Here&#039;s my story:<br /><br />I initially tried the craigslist route.&nbsp; I intended to find a no-fee apartment by sifting through the nonsense and seeing places with the owners.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived in Astoria for a number of years so I had a pretty solid list of &quot;must haves&quot; for a new place.&nbsp; Even though some places I saw were OK, none really fit the bill.&nbsp; And some were a complete waste of time (like places for 1750 with roach traps all over the place, filthy living space, awful building, just plain scary).<br /><br />Eventually I had to break down and go with a broker.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t have a lot of time to waste &amp; I needed someone who could narrow down the choices for me based on my list of &quot;must haves.&quot;&nbsp; In talking to brokers, I made it clear that if they wasted my time showing me places that didn&#039;t fit my criteria, then I&#039;d drop them instantly.&nbsp; This generally isn&#039;t something most brokers want to hear, so it didn&#039;t surprise me that some didn&#039;t call back at all.&nbsp; <br /><br />One of the brokers that didn&#039;t call back was Tasos from Astoria Apartments.&nbsp; In his case, I barely got a chance to tell him my criteria because he just kept talking right over me &amp; wouldn&#039;t allow me a chance to speak.&nbsp; He was throwing things at me left and right (&quot;I got a great place for you; I&#039;ve got the keys right now&quot;).&nbsp; When I&#039;d explain that I wasn&#039;t interested in, say, a fifth floor walk-up and why, he just kept on talking.&nbsp; When he figured out that I wasn&#039;t going to have the patience for his nonsense, he said &quot;I&#039;ll call you later&quot; and I never heard from him again.&nbsp; So, I wouldn&#039;t recommend this guy.<br /><br />I saw an apartment with a broker named Richard (of R&amp;R Realty, I believe - the one partnered with Rashida).&nbsp; Richard was an extremely nice guy &amp; wasn&#039;t pushy at all.&nbsp; I never met Rashida (who I heard isn&#039;t so nice).&nbsp; He showed me a place off 30th - great location, nice place, but it was missing a couple of vital things I needed.&nbsp; Afterward, I didn&#039;t get the sense that he had anything I was looking for &amp; he said he&#039;d pass my info along to his associates.&nbsp; Again, never heard from him again.&nbsp; I figured I&#039;m being picky, which I&#039;m allowed to be, and my being picky was going to make things more difficult for me.&nbsp; Alas, I kept trying.<br /><br />I saw another nice apartment off 30th, but after seeing it, there were a few things that bothered me &amp; I wanted to see it again.&nbsp; I saw this with a broker named Jamie (from Rutenberg Realty - which has hundreds of brokers so it&#039;s hard to judge the whole company based on this one guy).&nbsp; Jamie was very pushy and it was obvious that he was saying whatever he could to get me to take the place.&nbsp; He made it very difficult and confusing, and pushed for me to put down a $500 deposit on the apartment before I was anywhere near sure.&nbsp; I wanted to see the place a 2nd time to look at some of the things that bothered me &amp; he tried everything in his power to keep me from doing so.&nbsp; I finally put my foot down and said I&#039;m walking away unless I can see it, so he begrudgingly made the arrangement.&nbsp; After confirming that the little things that bothered me were deal-breakers, I told him that I was uninterested &amp; stopped communicating with him as I knew he wasn&#039;t the type of person I wanted to deal with.&nbsp; Sneaky, shrewd, pushy, dishonest - unfortunately common traits for many brokers, but this was to the nth degree.<br /><br />I spoke with a few other brokers on the phone, but none were especially helpful.&nbsp; They were either loud &amp; pushy, or just didn&#039;t have anything in the area I wanted.<br /><br />I spoke with one broker named Maria (from Aidonis Realty) who also didn&#039;t have anything in the area I wanted, but was very nice and helpful.&nbsp; She basically coached me - at length - on how to get what I wanted and how to deal with brokers.&nbsp; She absolutely didn&#039;t have to take the time to do this, but she did because she&#039;s nice.&nbsp; We both knew that she wasn&#039;t going to be able to find a place I wanted, but she helped anyway.<br /><br />The broker who finally got me a place was Peter Horowitz, also from Charles Rutenberg Realty.&nbsp; Although I see he&#039;s posted on this thread, I didn&#039;t find him here.&nbsp; He just happened to be representing a place I found on craigslist.&nbsp; In his case, I liked the place so much that it wasn&#039;t necessary for me to see anything else.&nbsp; It had everything I needed, and after looking at close to 30 places, I was sure that this one was a rare breed.&nbsp; Peter was never pushy, and he didn&#039;t try to give me standard broker lines like &quot;this is the best building in Astoria&quot; or any other line of crap that most brokers say just to get you to sign.&nbsp; He basically just let me look around &amp; was there to answer questions.&nbsp; He was friendly and helpful in mediating my &quot;interview&quot; with the landlords, and has helped me with things (like asking the super to put in some window screens that were missing) even after I signed the lease.&nbsp; This surprised me because most brokers, once they have their fee, will be out of your life forever.&nbsp; With Peter, I can&#039;t speak for how he&#039;d be if I needed to see place after place with him b/c the first apartment I saw was a winner.<br /><br />I hope this info helps.&nbsp; I can&#039;t guarantee that your experience with all of the people I mentioned will go exactly the same as they did with me.&nbsp; The best I can do is describe exactly how my story went &amp; you can make your own judgement from there.<br /><br />Good luck.<br />

				First of all I want to say thank you to everyone for posting their experiences on here. I had to move to New York (better job) from Michigan within two weeks, while finishing out my two weeks at my current company. Needless to say, I didn&#039;t have the time (or money) to come apartment hunt after two flights for my interview. This board, and thread, saved my life.<br /><br />Based on all the reviews, I decided to set up appointments with Neon Realty, Kim at Halvatzis and Mary at ReMax. Here are the results:<br /><br /><strong>Neon Realty:</strong> Called these people first. I could barely understand the person who answered the phone. He asked me a few questions (when I needed the place, price range, etc.), took my number and said he&#039;d call back. I finally received a call from him... yesterday. They were about a month late. Needless to say, this company didn&#039;t care.<br /><strong><br />Mary at ReMax:</strong> Oh, Mary. I apologize. I called her, and she asked me a lot of questions (all useful), and set up an appointment. She called to confirm later in the week, and unfortunately I&#039;d already found a place the day before. I had to cancel on her, but she seemed extremely friendly and trustworthy.<br /><br /><strong>Kim at Halvatzis:</strong> Needless to say, Kim got me the place. She was great all the way through. Called her up, she asked me some brief questions about price-range, area, pets, etc. and said she had a place in mind. Extremely friendly and had an immediate report with her (someone mentioned it was like working with a close friend.) She was very professional and quick the whole way through. When I met with her, she had 10 places lined up and we hit them all within about an hour and a half. She drove me around, gave me some tips on the area, and had everything ready to go. I think the best thing about working with Kim is that she is HONEST. She told me right off the bat, &quot;I&#039;m going to show you this place first. It&#039;s by far the best one I&#039;ve got and I think you&#039;re going to love it. I&#039;ve got others lined up with different price ranges and sizes so you can compare, but each one has its good and bad.&quot; Then she told me the positives and negatives of each place while we were there. <br /><br />I absolutely love my place. I got a two-bedroom place in an awesome neighborhood and complex, for the price of a one-bedroom, because the landlord told me he trusts Kim, and needed to move the place quickly (I signed the next day, only because the banks weren&#039;t open the day I viewed). My super is great and I couldn&#039;t be happier. Totally worth the price of one month&#039;s rent.<br /><br />Basically, go with Kim. You won&#039;t regret it.<br /><br />PS. If you&#039;re in a situation like I was, Craigslist is useless. Don&#039;t even bother. Those places are gone the same day they&#039;re posted.<br /><br />PPS. Don&#039;t worry about the cash deposit thing. Just make sure they give you a receipt. <br />

				It took me three months to find an apartment.&nbsp; I met some real winners and some real losers as far as brokers goes.<br /><br />I highly recommend:<br /><br />Irene Drettakis with Realty Executives 917 686-7345 (She landed me the apartment I live in now.&nbsp; Awesome)<br />Angela at Metropolis - So nice<br />Carol from Carol In Real Estate - 718-744-8764 an independent broker<br />Karen Shipsey/Astoria Park Realty - 917 414 9311&nbsp; Super cool group of realtors working in a very laid back, friendly, professional environment.<br /><br />Stay away from AIDA Realty.&nbsp; She showed me two dumps, and admitted she hadn&#039;t prescreened them. she also lists her apartments under &quot;Owners&quot; on craigslist which is very dishonest. <br /><strong></strong><br />Also had bad experience with Evan&#039;s Corner.

				I&#039;ve read through this thread and noted down a couple names. I plan to start with craigslist to get an idea of what is out there, and then contact some brokers. I&#039;m wondering though...<br /><br />I will be in NYC in a month, and I have a place to stay until I can find a place, so Im not in too much of a rush.<br /><br />How soon after getting in contact with a broker should I expect to be shown places? Under a week? Or will I have to make appts a couple weeks in advance?<br />Should I start contacting brokers before I move?

				We looked at an apartment with Awilda at Astoria Apartments on 31st and Ditmars. She is a sweetheart and thank god we saw this beautiful apartment with her, otherwise we would have walked away immediately. The reason being TASO - the total scammer who owns the company - completely took over the deal and stole it from Awilda - after we had told her we only wanted to deal with her cause he was so needlessly agressive the second we walked in the door. He wouldn&#039;t listen to what we wanted from a place and kept listing off places in different neighborhoods and saying how we don&#039;t want to miss out on the place and all this nonsense. This was all while we were trying to discuss our needs with Awilda.<br /><br />When we were going over the apartment Taz started pulling out folders from previous apartments he had rented to show us how &quot;great of a deal&quot; we were getting. He was showing us drivers licenses of people who rented the places and telling us there back story. We tried to get him to stop cause we realized how messed up it was for him to be showing us this private information that people assume is confidential but he kept insisting that he just wanted to make us understand that we were getting a good price. This was after we paid the overblow $50 per person credit check fee for both me and my husband. Looking back it doesn&#039;t make sense for us to have both paid the fees, especially since we both have great credit. <br /><br />After a series of back and forth&#039;s with the landlord about what the place actually included our rent got lowered a few hundred dollars. Taz decided that he wanted his fee to be one of the higher numbers - not 1 month rent like we had discussed. We said we could discuss that when we came to sign the lease with the landlord. He made us write the check for that higher amount in front of the landlord - even though we repeatedly asked him if we could please wait till the landlord left so we can discuss this matter in private - to which he yelled &quot;this fee is non-negotiable&quot; Non-negotiable??? We weren&#039;t trying to negotiate, we just wanted to pay the 1 months rent we understood we would be paying. <br /><br />When we first sat down with him he asked us to give him a good review on here.... so here you go taz! All for $100 you get another mark on your reputation. Enjoy. <br />&nbsp;

				A few people mentioned Kim at Halvatzis and at first i was excited to try her, so i phoned her up.&nbsp; The folks at her office were super nice and got me in contact with her but boy oh boy, it wasn&#039;t a great experience.&nbsp; Maybe i caught her on an off day or something but needless to say, she basically told me that she had nothing for me in my price range $1300 and that i was better off looking in LIC (an area which she said she didn&#039;t service).&nbsp; I guess if you don&#039;t have the green, this lady is not for you.&nbsp; Anymore recommendations?

				In our apartment search, we probably saw at least 8-10 different brokers (I took the Craigslist approach, but all of the properties we were interested in were through brokers). <br /><br />We would up getting ours through <strong>Elena from Barskaya Group</strong>. She was non-pushy and very responsive. She was very hands off - she just allowed us to look around as much as we pleased and said nothing to sway our opinion one way or the other. Her fee was only half a month&#039;s rent, which was a very pleasant surprise! <br /><br />My favorite of the brokers we worked with was <strong>Yvonne of Castle Realty</strong>. She was just such a genuinely nice and caring person. She was able to see me with very little notice, numerous times in a day, to show me an apartment. She also very willingly negotiated with the landlord for me, since there were some very specific requests I had, and I feel she really gave her all to try to get me the apartment. It didn&#039;t work out (which was for the best, since the one we got is nicer!), but I feel she really went the extra mile. She even called me back a week or two after we found out the landlord had decided to give it to a family friend to see if I had found anything.

				How could I forget to rant about this one...<br /><br /><strong>Nick from Pari Passu Realty</strong> (apparently now <strong>Level Group</strong>) - I found an apartment on Craigslist that he was showing that I was extremely interested in. I called to set up an appointment. I called to confirm before I went, as instructed, and got voice mail. I went anyway and arrived at the building at that time, rang his bell as instructed (he lived in the building), and got no answer. Again I rang and got no answer. I called his cell phone and also got nothing. So, I left. Then he called back the next day saying he was at the grocery store when I called (as if that was excusable...?) and that we could set up a new time. He left me a message saying he would call the next morning to touch base with me and that his wife would be home to show the place to me since he&#039;d be out showing another place. Next morning, I hear nothing from him, so of course I don&#039;t just drop in on his wife. I called him that afternoon to see what happened, and he claims his wife was home waiting for me all day. However, she&#039;s still home and I can go over now to see it. So, I do. I ring the bell and the wife answers saying that she&#039;s ill and cannot come down, but she&#039;ll buzz the door and I should go up to the apartment to look around, as it was left unlocked for me. I go up, and, brig surprise... it&#039;s locked. At this point I left and said &quot;screw it&quot; to the whole ordeal. Clearly not worth it.

				Do not go with brokers on Craigslist. I called one named Alicia for an apartment ad on Craigslist, I knew she was a broker. She tried talking me out of the apartment that I wanted and she wanted to show me like 5 other places. I said no I just want to see that apartment and maybe a few other ones within my price range. Then she proceeded to list a bunch outside of my price range and kept getting more expensive. Then she started asking me a lot of personal questions and I ended up hanging up on her she was so rude and so mean I can&#039;t even describe what a freak she was. Please if you&#039;re on Craigslist and see the name Alicia on anything in Astoria avoid a getting high blood pressure and flat out avoid her.

				I recently dealt with Astoria Apartments LLC on 31st st and Ditmars.&nbsp; DO NOT use them!&nbsp; Their business practices are shady and unethical.&nbsp; The owner wanted me to pay a broker fee before ever meeting my prospective landlord, signing a lease, etc.&nbsp; <br />They are more interested in closing a deal as quickly as possible and putting your money in their pocket than making good tenant/landlord relationships that would lead to repeat business.&nbsp; <br />They have also had the name Maximum Exposure Realty LLC in the past which makes me wonder why the name change?<br /><br />On a positive note, Liz Realty on Ditmars and Steinway has been very professional, warm and listens to your needs.&nbsp; Try them.&nbsp;

He asked me a lot of questions and described a lot of apartments that he had available. I was really excited and he sounded really excited to help. He said he could show me apartments that day (this was this past Tuesday) and he didn&#039;t call me back and didn&#039;t pick up when I tried calling him later that day. Either he took down the wrong phone number or he&#039;s a flake.<br /><br />So on the recommendations from this board (thank you so much!) I called Kim at Halvatzis and she showed me one apartment on the day I called. And it ended up being the one. Huzzah!<br /><br />The last time I dealt with a realtor was two years ago with MQ Realty (who I also discovered from this board). I had a wonderfully sweet Eastern European lady, Niki, show me about six apartments in Astoria and Jackson Heights - three of which were huge and amazing for my price range. She&#039;s not with MQ anymore. I think MQ is barely holding on, as their office phone is not in service any longer. They did make me pay a $250 application fee, which in hindsight, I realize was a total jack.

				I had a good experience with Astoria Apartments. Awilda was nice and showed me apartments that were within my price range and the area I wanted to live.&nbsp; I found one I liked, but when I went to put the deposit down, I found out they had just gotten a deposit for it!&nbsp; I was disheartened at first but they continued to work with me. Taso took me and showed me another apartment, and I just loved it!&nbsp; He was nice and took extra time to drive me around the neighborhood to show me the area.&nbsp; Also, he seemed to have a good relationship with the landlord because he negotiated my rent down and was able to have the landlord come in that day to sign the lease so I could get all the paper work and everything settled on the same day.&nbsp; They helped to make my apartment hunting experience pretty simple and quick.&nbsp; And now I can&#039;t wait until I get to move into Astoria!

				Hello. After 6 years in my Astoria apartment, I must move. I was hoping to get some advice from my neighbors here on the board. Does anyone have updated information about recent dealings with real estate agents in Astoria? I have followed up with a few agents recommended in earlier parts of this thread, but I was hoping to get some more suggestions that are from 2011. I have only started my search but I am already discouraged by the lack of response or rude responses from agents in the area.<br /><br />Thanks for your help!

				After a couple of months looking via Craigs list and a couple of really bad experiences. There were two instances where I put down a deposit and filled out all of the paperwork and run the credit report only to find that the apartment wasn&#039;t available or, in the second instance that they didn&#039;t take cats after I&#039;d made it clear that I had one. These were both with the same guy - I don&#039;t think he was a Real Estate agent, I think that he was a runner.&nbsp; It was all very unprofessional.<br /><br /><br />I walked into Page off of the street. They showed me 5 apartments and the last one was the charmer. Unlike the experience of an earlier poster who used to live in a Page building, all of the apartments that I saw were in pretty decent condition. I saw some horrible places during my previous searches. <br /><br /><br />They don&#039;t officially manage my building but do go-between me &amp; the landlord and employ people who have worked on my apartment (I don&#039;t know how that works).&nbsp; Everything gets taken care of in a pretty timely manner. My biggest problem was with my upstairs neighbor who wouldn&#039;t allow access to her apartment so that a water leak could get repaired and there was a strange gas smell but they did their best to work around her. Fortunately, she moved and the issues have been resolved. I don&#039;t have much of a roach problem since she moved out either, so I can&#039;t speak to that.

				I&#039;m from Manhattan and just found a great place in Astoria, that we&#039;ll be moving into in June. My gf and I did a lot of searching on the internet while looking for our apt. I have experience in real estate, so my goal was to <strong>not use a broker/agent at all</strong>. My advice is to contact management companies directly, thus cutting out the <strong>broker and any fees that they think they deserve</strong>. This is usually easiest with newer buildings. We were able to get into this awesome brand new 2BR right off the Astoria Blvd N train.<br />&nbsp;<br />I wish you luck my new neighbor.<br />JF

				Jason F - I&#039;ve been using sites such as nybits.com to look for management companies - but can you recommend any others? I find the postings on nybits.com tend to be in the higher end buildings overall.<br /><br />I wanted to see if anyone specifically had a recommendation for a broker that tends to specialize in the &quot;lower&quot; end of rentals in Astoria? I&#039;m mostly interested in Ditmars, but 31st street subway stop area is ok too.&nbsp; I know a lot of people recommend Kim at Halvaltzis, but I&#039;ve also read she does not tend to specialize in anything lower priced.&nbsp; The cheapest overall I&#039;ve found on a broker&#039;s site seems to be Century 21 Triboro and Zikos Realty (but I hear Zikos is fairly inflexible on the 15% fee?).&nbsp; Is there any that you&#039;ve had a good experience with trying to find either a studio or 1 bed place in the 1100-1200 range?

				jayhawk, I got a pretty good 1BR near Ditmars in January this year for $1200. I can&#039;t make any promises but the broker I used was Peter Horowitz who runs this website: http://myastoriarealestate.com/ (http://myastoriarealestate.com/)<br />A lot of the stuff he posts is higher end, but he may have some other things to show you that are perhaps not quite as glamorous with their remodeled kitchens and everything. Worth a shot.<br />I had tried calling Kim at Halvatzis during the same time period, and she had nothing to show me under $1400 and sort of acted like lower priced apartments didn&#039;t exist and wasn&#039;t interested in my business unless I would pay $1400.<br /><br />Peter showed me a wide range of apartments and I was happy working with him. He&#039;s a broker where I feel like he actually takes his job seriously and puts a lot of time and effort into it. I&#039;m shy with dealing with random landlords and stuff and so I definitely appreciate a friendly person who does that legwork for me. YMMV. I personally don&#039;t mind using a broker for that reason, although yeah, the fee is painful on top of all the other costs involved in moving.<br /><br />Another broker you can try is Jenny at Avanguard, who got us a cheapo 3BR a couple years ago but I didn&#039;t have any luck with her this time around: http://www.avanguardrealty.com/ (http://www.avanguardrealty.com/)<br /><br />Good luck!

				You have to work with Astoria Apartments on ditmars &amp; 31st st. Ask for Dave or Taso. OR to be honest any realtor there. My roommates and I got an apartment in the Acropolis (don&#039;t move there fyi..my opinion) and it was infested with roaches. Our realtor, Dave, along with the help of literally all the realtors got us all of our money back and we got out of the lease. They even helped us find another place within a day and made sure we had priority on the apartment.<br /><br />These guys really care about their renters! They are the best!!! As long as I live in Astoria I will always go to these guys<br />

				Hi everybody,<br /><br /><br />I have had so much trouble getting into Astoria! I love the neighborhood, and I&#039;ve had three apartments fall through for various reasons over the last three months, for reasons as varied as a moldy floor disintegrating under my feet (I&#039;d seen it furnished, and they&#039;d hidden a standpipe under a bed--avoid any basement apartments going for under a grand on 21st-24th ave!!) to an agent getting offered more and deciding to make up some lies about the owner changing his mind..:(<br /><br /><br />Luckily I recuperated all my money but was still on the hunt for a good place. I called Cesar at MQ realty late one night and he was all business. He showed me a place that was right in my budget and was considerably nicer than what I&#039;d seen before. His realtor fee was closer to a month and a half, but I can&#039;t say I regret the expense. He really must get the best stuff. He was professional and courteous the whole way through. Not to mention funny and friendly.<br /><br /><br />I couldn&#039;t recommend him more. Not sure this is the right place for it, but he had asked me to put in a good word if the experience was a good one. And it sure was. I&#039;d ring him now. Don&#039;t be afraid of the professional looking website. You&#039;re not getting some sharky agent who&#039;s never been around the block.<br /><br /><br />Best,<br /><br /><br />K.

				ok, I had a bad experience with that realtor not showing up to an appointment, or notifying me to cancel or even apologize for not showing up. That is probably one of the things that annoy me the most, is when someone makes an appointment and then doesn&#039;t show up. It&#039;s like saying their time is more important than mine.<br /><br />Needless to say I wouldn&#039;t recommend that broker (although quite a few brokers have the habit of just not showing up to appointments if they are no longer interested or have something else to do)

				We haven&#039;t sold anything with a local realtor, but here are my experiences: I&#039;ve had Bianca Collasuono show us a few things. She seems very honest and down-to-earth and showed us the types of places we wanted to see. I&#039;ve also heard very good things about her from many other people. We didn&#039;t buy from her, but it was more a case of wrong place/wrong time. <br />I&#039;d stay away from any RE places near the train-they are all shysters. I went through them all pretty quickly and was completely turned off with many after just a quick phone conversation because they were trying to TELL ME what I WANTED. Since they didn&#039;t seem to GET IT, they got crossed off my list quick.<br />Years ago we were looking into purchasing a rental property. I can only remember that the agent&#039;s name was Tiffany and she was pushing my husband really hard when I wasn&#039;t there to buy, buy, buy. She even met with him for coffee to encourage him on the &quot;deal of a lifetime&quot;. She even lied to us and told us she knew cousins of ours (which I guess would make her seem more trustworthy), which I later found out was not true. I got the sense that it was a bad deal, she knew that I was gonna screw it up for her and she encouraged my husband to meet up with out me to see the building a few more times. She had her own mortgage people, etc. Fortunately, our own banker put the final knife in the deal and gave it to us straight-NO GO. We would have been eating ramen noodles for the rest of our lives on that one, so I tell people to just stay away from her.<br />I will also say that while I did not do business with Paul Halvatzis at Amorelli, he was so helpful (spent time to help me out when he clearly wasn&#039;t getting paid to do it) and a really nice guy. I used another realtor at Amorelli for a rental-and she finally found what we were looking for when I got nasty with her. She was doing the typical-showing us stuff way out of our price range. <br />We purchased our latest apartment from an agent at Douglas-Elliman and I have to say that they were way more professional than any of the other realtors I&#039;ve met with. Maybe that is because they aren&#039;t Astoria-based.<br />&nbsp;<br />OK, hope that helps, not confuses. Good Luck!

				I haven&#039;t used these realtors but have talked to them on the phone.&nbsp; Worth a try:<br />&nbsp;<br />Peter Horowitz at http://myastoriarealestate.com/ (http://myastoriarealestate.com/)<br />&nbsp;<br />Maria Aidonis at http://aidonisrealty.com/current-rentals/ (http://aidonisrealty.com/current-rentals/)&nbsp; Maria generally helps owners sell their places but does have some rentals.<br />&nbsp;<br />Both realtors are very nice on the phone and there website list their rentals with good photos and floor plans.<br />&nbsp;<br />Next, I would try Craig&#039;s list.&nbsp; Although you have to be careful, I did find two women realtors on there who were on the up and up and showed me some nice places. <br /><br />What you have to watch out for is a lot of &quot;realtors&quot; on Craig&#039;s list are independent and basically don&#039;t have the properties they say they do.&nbsp; I got one who made an appointment to show me an apartment but when we got there, it turned out he didn&#039;t have the keys and the super wouldn&#039;t let him in!&nbsp; If I have the time, I&#039;ll try to find the two women advertising on Craig&#039;s list who were good and post them here.<br />&nbsp;<br />I got my apartment 4 yrs. ago from Taso (can&#039;t remember the name of his rental agency) at 347-461-3378.&nbsp; He&#039;s on 31st Street between Ditmars and 21st Avenue.&nbsp; Not saying he&#039;s the greatest but you may find something.<br />&nbsp;<br />Good luck!

				Hi guys I wanted some advice Im looking to move to Astoria and have been looking at 3brs (also 2brs the 3rd roommate is willing to move but not in a rush) anyway I recently saw a 3br appt in Ditmars area which was a little under 3000 however it included no utlities. Esentially its a house with 2bth 3brs. Now my question is is it worth it? How much on avg would all utlities be gas, heat, hot water and gas. I know that there is diff factors (usage, a/cs, etc) I know this is not normal and I feel the apartment is really nice but has been on the market for two weeks which is kind of a long time. I feel that there has to be the catch. If utlities are on avg 500 I think it would be a good deal and same price as apartments that are 3000 with heat and hot water included but 3x bigger. Any advice is much appreciated. <br />

				Hi -- hope it&#039;s cool to revive this thread. I&#039;m finding the Astoria broker world sort of baffling. We have been looking for a condo, co-op, or house with a decent amount of private outdoor space. We already own a co-op. I&#039;m on the mailing list of a few brokers, but when I reply to their e-mail listings, I get nowhere: &quot;Oh, I&#039;ll be in touch&quot; or &quot;Maybe we&#039;ll have keys next week.&quot; Days and then weeks go by with nothing.<br /><br />Am I doing something wrong? We&#039;re not in any special rush to buy a place, but we do have the cash and will be ready to jump when we see the right home. Any tips? Anyone else experience this weird lack of help from brokers? We&#039;ve looked in Brooklyn and Manhattan in the past and brokers were practically harassing us with listings, e-mails, etc. So strange.

I thought Manhattan brokers did no work, but Astoria&#039;s brokers take that to a whole new level.&nbsp; It&#039;s definitely not you!

				Bumping this for new suggestions/experiences. I&#039;ve compiled a list of brokers based on your recommendations already, but I was wondering if anyone had other names? I&#039;ll be looking for a 3BR with a balcony, patio, or yard and near the N/Q trains for upwards of $2700, if that makes any difference to what brokers I should work with.

				Hi folks, I&#039;m bumping this again, hoping to hear of anyone&#039;s positive experiences with brokers in Astoria.&nbsp; Would like to work with someone who is very honest about apartments, conditions, supers, etc. and will work hard to help us find the best place that meets what we&#039;re looking for. Thanks!

				I don&#039;t think highly of most brokers and have yet to meet an honest one. But have you tried reading reviews on Yelp? some might be fake if they are all too good, but you should be able to weed through them

				only advice I can give anyone is to stay away from Astoria Home Realty on 38th and 31st<br /><br /><br />http://www.yelp.com/biz/astoria-home-realty-queens-2<br /><br /><br />Just have a read! <br /><br /><br />They have scammed friends of mine and left them with virtually nothing.
