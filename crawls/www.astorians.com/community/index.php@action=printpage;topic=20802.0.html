				Its about time for me to go pediatrician shopping before the lil fella arrives. My insurance is either making it easy or very difficult given that there are 4 pediatricians I can use in all of astoria and they are all in the same practice it seems. Does anyone know anything about either of the 4 doctors listed below? I don&#039;t drive so getting to a doctor outside of astoria is going to be somewhat difficult for me. as it is, 23rd ave from 34th ave is going to be somewhat difficult for me. Any info would be appreciated. As well as when you first met with your particular pediatrician before baby&#039;s arrival.

				Check to see if your insurance will accept Dr. Elsa Cruz, Pediatric Clinic at Steinway - she&#039;s on Steinway between Broadway and 34th Ave. (closer to 34th).&nbsp; She also works in the pediatric ER at Elmhurst Hospital.&nbsp; I know she accepts many different kinds of insurance.&nbsp; We are really happy with her, as are several of our friends.&nbsp; I&#039;d be happy to discuss her further via PM.&nbsp; We live closer to Ditmars and it&#039;s worth it for us to make the trek to her.<br /><br />3278 Steinway St<br />Ste 1, <br />Astoria NY - 11103 <br />718-204-8448

				thanks for the recs, but unfortunately those 4 docs are the ONLY ones in all of Astoria my insurance will cover. sucks to have such limited &quot;choice&quot; but it&#039;s all I have to work with. <br />on a slightly related point...at what point during pregnancy did you go and meet/interview (which in my case won&#039;t be much of an interview so much as desperately hoping they are taking new patients) your pediatrician? I&#039;m heading into week 32 so i know i need to jump on this stat as I need to have it sorted out before he arrives.

				Heh, I still didn&#039;t have a pediatrician when he was born - and he was a week and a half late, so I had no excuse.&nbsp; When we went home from the hospital, he had a touch of jaundice (<em>very</em> mild) and they almost wouldn&#039;t release him because I didn&#039;t have anyone to call for a follow-up visit two days later.&nbsp; I had two friends who were using Dr. Cruz at the time, and one of them called her for me and she fit us in.&nbsp; I liked her so much from that visit I never called anyone else on my list as I was intending (Astoria Pediatrics was on my list and much closer to me, but I&#039;ve never bothered).<br /><br />I do know several people who bring their children to Astoria Pediatrics, and they are happy with the doctors there for the most part.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen Dr. Mike and Dr. Chris mentioned positively a few times, but I&#039;ve never met any of them so I can&#039;t speak from experience.&nbsp; Good luck!

				I can pretty much say, &quot;what Lanseaux said&quot; -- we also go to Dr. Cruz (on her recommendation) and have also heard good things about the Dr&#039;s at Astoria Pediatrics.<br /><br />And also didn&#039;t meet the doctor until after our son was born, though I did make an appointment beforehand so that we could be sure she was taking new patients. It was truly weird to make an appointment in the name of someone who didn&#039;t yet even *have* a name ;)

				We go to Dr. Mike.&nbsp; I think he&#039;s good, but I don&#039;t &quot;love&quot; him.&nbsp; No complaints.&nbsp; I&#039;m actually thinking about switching because it is a long walk from Broadway, and like I said, I don&#039;t &quot;love&quot; him.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also seen Dr. Chris once or twice.&nbsp; He was good too, but I think Dr. Mike is warmer.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen Dr. Stanley twice too.&nbsp; Loved him the first time.&nbsp; He was a bit standoffish the second time.&nbsp; He probably was just really busy.&nbsp; I actually believe he left that practice, though.&nbsp; You should check where he is now.&nbsp; Maybe he still takes your insurance but works closer to 34th Ave.&nbsp;

				Also, I saw Dr. Mike just a couple weeks before my daughter was born for an interview.&nbsp; There are some excellent interview questions in the book Baby 411.&nbsp; I just basically asked those.&nbsp; My husband and I were impressed with Dr. Mike&#039;s answers, and we looked no further.

				My children go to Astoria Pediatrics.&nbsp; The primary dr they see is Dr. Mike &amp; I am happy with him.&nbsp; After my daughter was born, he came to the hospital for the 2 days we were there (She was a little jaundice after birth)&nbsp; I like that I can see any doctor if my children need to when they are sick.&nbsp; I can call that morning &amp; get an appointment to see any dr.&nbsp; They are open 6 days a week &amp; stay open late.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dr. Mike is warmer than Dr. Chris.&nbsp; I was not too keen on Dr. Stanley the few times my kids saw him.&nbsp; I felt like I was being talked down to.&nbsp; Also in that office is Dr. Denise, my daughter saw her once &amp; she was great-freindly, kind &amp; took her time with us.&nbsp; <br /><br />Overall, I am happy with them.&nbsp; I actually switched to Dr. Mike after my son was about a year old.We use to go to a dr. closer to 30th Ave.&nbsp; I am close to B&#039;way &amp; still trek up to 23rd Ave.<br /><br />Good luck with your decision!

				Thanks for the info moms!<br />I was leaning a bit towards the one female doctor in the practice. I looked up the other docs and DH has a bit of an issue with none of them having graduated from an American medical institution. I do also like that she&#039;s been practicing for 7 years so i would hope she&#039;s up on all the newer information and procedures and such while still having the other doctors available who have been practicing for a long time to consult with. Lil fella has some wierd kidney thing going on. Don&#039;t know the specifics other than each ultrasound the kidneys come up dark (I joke he needs to pee, they say, yeah basically). The docs say don&#039;t worry about it, it&#039;s common and will most likely resolve itself before or just after delivery. But if after it&#039;s something for his pediatrician to look into. I&#039;m not worried about it but kind of thinking I should have the doctor lined up in case it becomes a post delivery monitoring issue. <br />I&#039;m also relieved to hear some of you didn&#039;t line up a pediatrician until after your little ones arrived...makes me feel less like i&#039;ve dropped the ball. I really wouldn&#039;t begin to know what to ask a dr before the baby is here (other than the kidneys) I don&#039;t have strong feelings on immunization shots. He needs them, he&#039;s going to get them and as long as my insurance covers the necessary visits it can happen as needed, whether bunched up or spread out. Sucks to get so many shots, but I don&#039;t remember getting them and he certainly won&#039;t either!

				&nbsp;Hi! I am a maternal child Rn who has worked with Dr.Chris and Dr.Mike from Astoria Pediatrics.They are both excellence pediatricians .What some of the other posters have said is true.Dr.Mike is warm,smart and responses well to all children.Dr.Chris is more serious but very capable. I have been going to AP since my daughter was born (12 years old) I usually stick with Dr.Chris and Dr.Mike since Ive worked with them.My daughter have not had visits with the others two MDs so I can not relay any information about them.One very importance point is that these mds have admitting rights to Long Island Jewish Hospital (Schneider Children&#039;s Hospital) which is a excellent hospital for children. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; It sounds like your son has hydronephrosis which is more common in boys.After you deliver at the hospital,the nurses and&nbsp; mds will watch your son closely to see when he urinates&nbsp; and will most likely do a sonogram to see if there is urine backflow into his kidneys.Hopefully it will resolve before he is born.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;There are many doctors who have graduated from &quot;foreign &quot; medicals school who are just as talented as a American graduates.As a nurse I can honestly say that isn&#039;t a special consideration for me&nbsp; and I don&#039;t base my choice of doctors on whether they went to an American school. That being said&nbsp; ,I can tell you Dr.Bloom and Dr Costin are also excellent pediatricians but I would stick with the group that covers your insurance.If any problem arise with your son ,it could become very expensive if you are &quot;out of network&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I wish you good luck and a safe happy delivery.

				we just started going to Astoria Pediatrics and have been seeing Dr. Yael Robson, who has just rejoined the practice after maternity leave.&nbsp; We like her very much so far.&nbsp; She is very communicative and seems quite knowledgeable.&nbsp; We are very pleased with the care and the responsiveness of the office.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Another vote for Dr. Robson - my daughter (4) loves her.&nbsp; I like that the office always manages to get us in if there&#039;s an emergency and they have evening hours to accomodate working parents.

				Thanks for more great info!&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br />And super kudos to suzyq for explaining the kidney thing. The docs have been so unconcerned by it that they said its only worth getting into if it gets worse as my pregnancy progresses. His kidneys appeared to have decreased their swelling the last scan, but they really couldn&#039;t get a good look. Have another on May 9th, so hopefully he&#039;s all squared away by then. Little more than a month to go before there&#039;s a new astorian in town.

				<br />Fiorentinos, Dionysia, DO<br /><br />is Dr. Denise at Astoria Pediatrics.&nbsp; We bring our daughter to her (and have since birth) and like her just fine.&nbsp; I like the practice too, since we have no trouble getting day of appointments.&nbsp; Dr&#039;.Denise is really great with babies and I feel like she&#039;s very accepting of various parenting ideals (at least the things I discuss with her)&nbsp; She is a bit saccharine, which I love for my daughter but for me its a bit much, but hey, if the lady is too nice, that&#039;s the least of all our problems.
