				Hey Folks,<br />If community supported agriculture is something that&#039;s important to you, then PLEASE VOTE IN THE CITY COUNCIL ELECTION THIS TUESDAY!!&nbsp; It&#039;s super important that the entire Astorian Community gets out and votes on Tuesday, Nov 3rd.&nbsp; We&#039;ve got a choice between the incumbent who has done little to support green initiatives and community agriculture, and the Green Party challenger, Lynne Serpe, whose platform is based on the concept of a green, sustainable community.&nbsp; But don&#039;t let her opponent&#039;s negative campaign literature fool you, she&#039;s strong on many other issues as well, including community safety and safe streets.&nbsp; Check out http://www.SerpeforCouncil.com (http://www.SerpeforCouncil.com) and vote for Lynne this Tuesday!

				They&#039;re both good people - but I think Peter is the clear choice based on his record.&nbsp; Once you get past the rougher exterior, he&#039;s very friendly.&nbsp; He is not your typical glad-handing politician, and I think it actually is refreshing.
