				I actually live around the corner from there and notice that there are always a lot of taped up mattresses out on trash day (which takes over the entire sidewalk).&nbsp; I always get nervous when I see taped up mattresses (with covers) as it&#39;s a sign of either A bedbud issue, or enough of something that people feel like they need to protect their beds.

				I walk past the Acropolis Gardens on my way to the train everyday.&nbsp; The sidewalk on the 21st Ave side is always covered in dog crap. (That is only the stretch of sidewalk right next to that apartment building- so I assume it comes from a lazy dog owner in that builsing.)<br /><br />There are beds always being thrown away on trash day.&nbsp; I looked at an apartment there when I first moved to Astoria and the inside of the 2- bedroom I was shown was nasty.&nbsp; All of the open windows faced cement walls and the rooms were tiny.&nbsp; The bathrooms were filthy and everything was old and decrepid...<br /><br />There are so many nice places in Astoria.&nbsp; I would avoid this place if I were you- I did.

				I think everyone that thinks of moving to astoria checks out the Acropolis Gardens - however, the vast majority (including me) who look at it decide they will never live there. It&#39;s been a couple years though since I looked at an apartment in there - but I&#39;ll not be living there any time soon.

Please email me for more details if you have questions.Astoria Acropolis Gardens ForeclosedResolving Defaults in Converted Co-ops <br />By THOMAS J. LUECK <br />Published: June 16, 1991 <br />EIGHTEEN months after the first reports that the sponsors of co-op and condominium conversions were defaulting on their bank loans and maintenance payments, the problem has spread steadily and now involves more than 400 buildings and thousands of apartment owners in New York City and its suburbs. <br />Experts say the problems are being aggravated by the region&#39;s prolonged real estate slump and tight credit. New York area lenders, reeling under steep losses from their loans to commercial developers, home builders and others, are refusing to finance apartment purchases in buildings that hold the slightest risk of sponsor defaults. <br />&quot;I don&#39;t think we can be sure the worst has passed,&quot; said Frederick K. Mehlman, the deputy New York State attorney general in charge of the state&#39;s Real Estate Finance Bureau. At a June 5 public hearing at City Hall, he criticized banks and thrift institutions in harsh terms, saying they were &quot;redlining a certain category of co-ops and condominiums.&quot; <br />Despite the alarm over the growing number of troubled buildings, most co-ops and condominiums -- even among those converted during the real estate boom of the 80&#39;s -- remain untouched by the sponsor defaults and are on firm financial ground. Mr. Mehlman said the defaults that have surfaced so far represent slightly over 10 percent of the 4,000 conversions of rental properties authorized by his bureau in the last decade. <br />Nor are all the defaults proving intractable problems. They have spawned an enterprising new field of legal arm-wrestling in which lawyers have found ways to avert large-scale bankruptcies and foreclosures while transferring the assets of the ailing sponsors to their worried fellow shareholders. <br />Along the way, some co-ops and condominiums may be emerging stronger than ever. <br />&quot;We are going to have one huge celebration,&quot; said Lillian Rodriguez, treasurer of the board at Hyde Park Gardens, a complex of 747 garden apartments in Kew Gardens Hills whose sponsors, holding 500 rent-regulated apartments, went into default last year. The complex was one of New York City&#39;s most severely troubled co-ops. <br />Now the problems appear to have been resolved through a sequence in which banks foreclosed on the co-op&#39;s sponsors and took back their unsold, rent-regulated apartments. The banks, with little desire to become landlords, then offered the apartments at steep discounts to their tenants or other shareholders. <br />As a result, the defaults at Hyde Park Gardens have been paid in full, more renters have invested in home ownership and many of the landlords of the remaining rental apartments are themselves Hyde Park Gardens residents. <br />Despite such happy endings, public officials are expressing alarm over the extent of the defaults. One reflection of their concern was the sponsorship of the City Hall hearing by all five borough presidents, who called it a forum on the city&#39;s &quot;co-op and condominium financial crisis.&quot; It attracted a standing-room-only crowd of more than 300 to the public hearing room, formerly the Board of Estimate chamber. <br />&quot;There is a real possibility of people losing their homes,&quot; said Claire Shulman, the Queens Borough President, whose staff has counted 20,000 co-op and condominium units whose owners are threatened by sponsor defaults. <br />In one case, at the Acropolis, a 617-unit co-op complex in Astoria, the apartment owners have received notice of foreclosure from the Bank of Tokyo, which holds a $25 million underlying mortgage on the complex. <br />&quot;The good news is that every problem has a solution,&quot; said Stuart Saft, a Manhattan lawyer who represents the Hyde Park Gardens board and more than a dozen others. He estimated that 75 percent of the cases of sponsor defaults that have emerged since the end of 1989 have now been cleared up or are near resolution. <br />But others talk in bleaker terms. Mr. Mehlman said he did not believe more than half the cases of default reported to his staff were resolved or even close to resolution. And in some, solutions are proving elusive. <br />At the Acropolis, 388 of the 617 apartments are occupied by rent-stabilized tenants who elected not to buy when the complex was converted into a co-op in 1988 and whose rents are less than the monthly maintenance. Some renters of two-bedroom apartments pay under $400 a month, even though the maintenance on their units is over $700. <br />The sponsor of the conversion, Martin Tepper, defaulted beginning in 1989. In an effort to resolve the problem, he auctioned 353 of his rent-regulated apartments in September. But because of the gap between the rental income on the apartments and what they are charged in maintenance, they sold for only $1 apiece to a New York investor, Daniel Weinberger. <br />Now, according to Don Novitt, the attorney for the Acropolis shareholders, Mr. Weinberger is himself in default, and the co-op is 12 months behind in its mortgage payments to the Bank of Tokyo. Others involved in the negotiations say it has taken pressure from Peter F. Vallone, the City Council majority leader, and Ms. Shulman, who has met repeatedly with officers of the bank, to forestall foreclosure. <br />Foreclosure would make the shares in the co-op worthless while leaving the shareholders in debt to other banks that extended them individual mortgage loans. <br />In some buildings, layers of legal complexity have added to the frustration of shareholders trying to sort through their sponsors&#39; financial problems, sometimes with little access to financial records. <br />One unresolved question is the the role of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal Agency charged with disposing of the assets of insolvent thrift institutions. In taking over more than a dozen New York-area lenders, Resolution Trust said has gained ownership of 1,000 occupied rent-regulated apartments in converted co-ops and condominiums. The agency expects to take over 1,000 more apartments through foreclosures on investors and sponsors. <br />In an intricate legal battle, the Federal agency has threatened to evict its rent-regulated tenants, saying that vacant co-ops and condominiums are worth much more than occupied rentals, and claiming that its mandate authorizes it to bypass New York State rules protecting renters. <br />The state, through Mr. Mehlman&#39;s office, has responded by suing Resolution Trust, and experts familiar with the case say it will take months and perhaps years to work its way through the courts. Resolution Trust, meanwhile, said it has stopped trying to sell its occupied apartments, even to investors who might buy them on the condition that they abide by rent-regulation rules. <br />A more immediate problem, according to co-op and condominium board members and state officials, are the lending policies of New York area banks and thrifts, which they say have tightened mortgage lending just when co-ops and condominiums need it most. <br />The lenders &quot;are contributing to a sense of panic,&quot; said Theresa Racht, attorney for a 24-unit co-op on West 83d Street that was was converted from rentals in 1984. Its underlying mortgage was due to be refinanced on Dec. 31, but a lender willing to approve the loan has not yet been found. <br />Ms. Racht said 18 units in the building are owner occupied, it has no defaults or other financial problems and its reserve fund is ample. <br />The problem, she said, is the six unsold units, which have been retained by the co-op&#39;s sponsor, Francis Greenburger, president of Time Equities, a major converter that, in December 1989, became the first to disclose serious financial problems. <br />Even though the financial condition of the building is &quot;very good,&quot; she said, &quot;we&#39;ve been turned down all over town.&quot; <br />Experts say tight credit policies have come at a critical time because many co-ops, like the one on West 83d Street, must now seek refinancing. The reason is that most buildings were financed with short-term &quot;balloon&quot; mortgages -- most commonly requiring full payment in five years. Since 1986 was the peak of the conversion boom -- state records show that 457 New York City buildings with 41,324 apartments were converted in that year alone -- lenders are now receiving a surge of applications for refinancing from co-op boards. <br />More widespread, according to Mr. Mehlman, is the problem faced by individual buyers and sellers of co-op and condominium apartments. In a real estate slump that has already reduced the value of most apartments, many would-be buyers are finding it hard to get mortgage loans if the apartment they have chosen is in a building where a sponsor still owns many -- or even just a few -- apartments. <br />The lending policies were what Mr. Mehlman referred to as redlining, a term that gained widespread currency in the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s to describe the illegal practice of arbitrarily denying mortgage loans in designated neighborhoods, usually populated by minorities. <br />Mr. Mehlman said he had found no legal grounds to challenge the co-op and condo lending policies, but added they resembled the illegal racially drawn guidelines in that &quot;a certain category of property is arbitrarily denied&quot; financing. This category, he said, includes buildings where sponsors hold more than a predesignated proportion of the apartments, as well as small buildings regarded as a greater credit risk than large ones. <br />The lending policies, although subject to change on a daily or weekly basis, were documented in a recent report by HSH Associates, a mortgage information publisher in Butler, N.J. It surveyed 24 of the largest lenders in New York on May 16, and found that almost all had adopted strict rules for co-ops and condominiums. <br />In most cases, the survey found, lenders that were willing to finance sales in buildings where sponsors retained a large interest limited themselves to large buildings. Those that required the smallest sponsor interest were willing to deal with a bigger variety of buildings, including brownstones, rowhouses and others buildings with fewer than 10 apartments. <br />In one example, Bank of New York said it would consider financing sales in co-ops where sponsors retained up to 49 percent of the shares, but would consider only buildings with a minimum of 20 apartments. In contrast, Greater New York Savings said it would finance sales in small building -- with a minimum of two apartments -- but would reject any application from a building where a sponsor held more than 30 percent of the shares. <br />Only three of the lenders in the survey -- East River Savings Bank, Lincoln Savings Bank and the Williamsburgh Savings Bank -- said they would finance apartment sales in buildings where sponsors retained more than 50 percent of the co-op shares. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Wow, I&#39;m suprised by some of the negativity....I&#39;ve seen a few places there that were newly redone and really nice....though clearly the building is old and the hallways and stairwells seemed on the dirty side. Does anybody have any specifics about what its like to live there?&nbsp; Are there really bug problems?<br /><br />Also, I&#39;ve seen these ads about the bankruptcy issues on craigslist - but the article is from 1991.&nbsp; Is this at all relevant anymore?<br /><br />Thanks for the reponses - if anybody who lives there or has lived there previously could help I&#39;d really appreciate it.<br /><br />Thanks

				I have a friend who lives there,&nbsp; just bought in a few years ago, and got a great deal.&nbsp; The article was written in 1991 and since then, they have been taken over by a new management company, which is trying to improve the image through renovation, etc. They have no board to go thru as they&#39;re mainly looking for buyers.&nbsp; I looked there myself once, and they were nice but yes very old and you don&#39;t get much of a view.&nbsp; But my friend&#39;s apartment is really nice, and he fixed up the place.&nbsp; He&#39;s not a member of this board though.

				My boyfriend bought his place there a little over a year ago and is very happy with it. He renovated the apartment and takes very good care of the place. The outside of the builing isn&#39;t the greatest, but the location and the price are excellent. If you want to buy a co-op/condo in the ditmars area that is near the train this is the only option. Any other place is at least a 10 blocks or more away from the train.<br /><br />The building was in financial trouble in the nighties, but since then they are doing much better financially and have a good management company. I don&#39;t know all the details but I can ask him if you&#39;re interested.

				Since the building is a co-op things can change if you chose to get involved. I&#39;m sure my boyfriend would partcipate more if he wasn&#39;t working all the time. The more people that buy into that building the better it can become. <br /><br />If you want to buy something there check with the management office. He found his place by contacting them and was able to avoid realtor fees.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=4590.msg47198.html#msg47198">Quote from: merm on January 09, 2007, 07:02:25 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It&#39;s good to hear an inside perspective that&#39;s positive.

				This sounds like something I might actually be interested in as well, owning that is.&nbsp; Everything is sooo expensive up here...so I kind of stopped even considering it after awhile.<br /><br />I owned my own home for 7 years and it makes a huge difference in so many ways.&nbsp; Especially when you want to improve your place.&nbsp; You really know your investing in yourself instead of giving your money away for something temporary.<br /><br />I&#39;ve have friends who have had problems with their co-ops, so it would be nice to hear some honest facts about owners experiences with the management and the other owners.&nbsp; I&#39;d rather hear the bad points, know what to expect, and honestly judge if it&#39;s something I can deal with then to get into a situation that is bad not only me, but the other owners as well.<br /><br />Can any owners drop us a few lines when they have a minute or two?<br /><br />Thanks Cyberia and Daisy for the tip and all, I&#39;ll definitely check this out.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m surprised by all the negative comments about the Acropolis. I&#039;ve been there over 3 years and I don&#039;t think it&#039;s as bad as so many people say it is. No place is ever perfect but I think it&#039;s a nice place to live overall. <br /><br />They are trying to renovate all the older apartments when people move out. The grounds are well cared for. Lots of flowers and trees in the courtyards. <br /><br />I will admit that they have a problem with people picking up after their dogs. It&#039;s one of my gripes. It&#039;s a big problem there.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve never had a problem with bed bugs and don&#039;t see all of these mattresses that people say are on the sidewalk. Unfortunately because it&#039;s such a big complex, when garbage day comes, the sidewalks are overflowing at times with garbage. If they had dumpsters or something, I think it would be better. <br /><br />You can&#039;t beat how close you are to the train, restaurants, shopping, etc. They have their own security which is a bonus. <br /><br />I would recommend people to check it out if they are interested.

				I&#039;ve lived in Acropolis Gardens since 2003 and have never had a problem. We bought our one-bedroom and completely renovated. The location is fantastic, the grounds are constantly being maintained, a new much-needed laundry room is under construction and we have never had bed bugs. A definite plus is they allow dogs, although some owners don&#039;t care enough to pick up after them. The only drawback is the size of the apts -- most are on the smaller side. But with such a short commute to the city, you don&#039;t mind after awhile.

				Just my 2 cents here because I have no friends who rent or own there. While it&#039;s great that the management has changed recently, what will always be an issue in a HUGE coop complex like that if there is no board to go through, even for renters, is the people living next door to you.

				A friend of mine just moved into the Acropolis two weeks ago, and I was really disappointed when I showed up to help. I&#039;ve always loved peeking in through the gates at the gardens and was happy to see that they cleaned up and started the fountain once it got warmer. But UGH the inside of the place was gross! The stairs were filthy and not in great repair. The apartment was tiny and dark, the kitchen was unbelievably cramped (with no cupboard space, but a washing machine!!), and his room was small, oddly shaped, and with a weird wooden frame set up over the door and along the wall instead of a closet. The whole thing looked like a tenement I lived in in Manhattan several years ago. I had considered looking there when I was hunting for my place but ended up finding something so quickly we never looked further, but now I&#039;ll never bother.

				Just to add, I rent a 2 bedroom in the acropolis. It was newly renovated when I moved in a little over a year ago, it is owned by a realty group, not related to the management company there. It is definitely not a luxury building, but it really isn&#039;t that bad either. My apartment, which is on the H line, is actually quite spacious, and has a lot of closet space. Some of the apartments I looked at there were really small. While the hallways leave a lot to be desired, overall living there is nice. I find that it is pretty quiet at night, and the maintenance people usually come in a timely manner if you have a problem. We had a leak once, and they came at 11:30 on a Sunday night. The dog crap on the streets is definitely a problem, but I usually just walk on the other side. I am not looking to buy the place, so I can&#039;t help with that. I definitely see apartments being renovated all the time.

				We looked at a place there this weekend.&nbsp; The owner claimed (swore, even when asked outright) that it was originally a 2 BR apartment, but it had obviously been sliced into one from a 1 BR or even a studio -- interior walls were hollow, inexplicably-shallow closets in the dividing BR wall.&nbsp; Remodeling was chintzy as well.&nbsp; Caveat emptor.

				Hi SeminoleB, Do you still have that listing from CL or do you remember the contact info? The reason I came to this forum was a deceptive owner/subletter who owns aprox. 9 units in the Acroplis Gardens.&nbsp; According to the management office she tried to rent a 2 bdrm as a 3 bdrm and argued with the office even though there was no 3rd bdrm! We are now taking her to Small Claims Court for a list of reasons and could use any help we can get. Has anyone had problems with this building or it&#039;s apartment owners?&nbsp; I just want to add that so far the people in the&nbsp; office has been very nice. TNX&nbsp;

				Hey, first-time poster&nbsp; :-)<br />I&#039;m thinking of buying a place in Astoria and just looked at a 2BR in the Acropolis last night. -- Kind of fell in love with it. I can see how the complex is pretty rough around the edges, but I was impressed by how aggressively the management seems to be working to improve things.&nbsp; At least that&#039;s the impression I got. Supposedly all the stairs will be replaced over the next year. That&#039;s a serious improvement. And the feeling of community was pretty strong (although I gather that&#039;s a feature of all of Astoria).&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought I&#039;d bump this thread in case anyone had anything else to add. I can&#039;t find much else online about the AG. <br />Cheers~

				We saw a handyman special for about 250. Have you had much experience with the place? <br /><br />I figure any development with over 600 units is going to be a mixed bag, especially since it obviously had such a rough time in the 90s. Bedbugs/vermin could be an issue anywhere- If you see mattresses piled on the street (gross, I agree) at least it&#039;s a sign that the problem&#039;s being dealt with..&#160; Anyway, I got a good vibe from it. I also have sort of an aversion to shiny new condos. I&#039;d rather fix up a place and make it my own.&nbsp; If the whole place is on the up, it seems like a good way to go IMO.

				We&#039;re renting from Acropolis a really beautifull renovated 2 bedroom. We really loved it, it was really clean and well-kept. Maybe the tenant before did all that, but it was definitely the best thing we&#039;ve seen for the price in a long time. I&#039;d rather have smaller rooms but renovated kitchen and bathroom. Some places feel like even if you clean it, it&#039;ll still look dirty. This place was pristine.<br /><br />And a lot can change even in a year. After we move out of our current apartment, they are completely rennovating it. So my opinion of my experience in my ex-building will no longer be applicable.

				As a two year resident of the Acropolis, I&#039;ll offer my insight on day-to-day living for those interested.<br /><br />The Acropolis is not a horrible place to live.&nbsp; I have heard that there are great variations between apartments, but having just seen my own, I can&#039;t say for certain what others look like.&nbsp; For my roommate and I, this has been a good <em>starter </em> apartment.&nbsp; We were both moving from far away, so having to conduct our apartment searches over Craig&#039;s List, and at the time, we got what we thought was a somewhat decent deal in paying $1800 for a two bedroom and no broker&#039;s fee.&nbsp; The market has changed a lot over the past two years and I have now seen our equivalent unit going for $1550 on Craig&#039;s List, and if we do in fact stay, plan to renegotiate our rent.&nbsp; In general however, we probably could have found better deals even two years ago, but we were on a time crunch and searching from afar, so we ran with our first offer.&nbsp; Now that I have been in Astoria for two years and seen a good deal of other people&#039;s apartments, I&#039;ve realized that we could buy more for less and do not intend to stay here once our lease expires.<br /><br />My biggest gripe with my current apartment is the size. My bedroom has a full size mattress.&nbsp; It touches three walls.&nbsp; If there were no other furniture in my room (and if the radiator didn&#039;t monopolize a whole other corner), there would maybe be room for one other full-size mattress next to it.&nbsp; Of course, that&#039;s not the case, as I have a dresser and nightstand in my room, meaning that all in all, I have about a 2x5 patch of clear space, and half of my closet is inaccessible.&nbsp; My roommate&#039;s room is a little larger with a different layout so she&#039;s got some more room (perhaps a 7X5 patch, with full access to her closet, and radiator in a less obstructive spot).&nbsp; Our kitchen is just a row of cabinets.&nbsp; It standing at the kitchen counter, if you take one step back, you&#039;re in the living room.&nbsp; Our stove&#039;s door cannot be opened the whole way without hitting the cabinets behind them.&nbsp; The bathroom is teeny tiny as well.&nbsp; We&#039;ve just quickly outgrown the space.&nbsp; The novelty of our &quot;cute tiny apartment&quot; was worn off.<br /><br />Our apartment was allegedly renovated before we got here, but there were still random holes in the wall which we had to caulk and tape over.&nbsp; When we first moved in, we had roaches.&nbsp; Thankfully, after the first month or two, I believe the building hired an exterminator and now we say maybe one every two months, which I kind of feel is inevitable in this city.&nbsp; While I have seen the mattresses out my the curb, we have NOT had any problems with bedbugs.&nbsp; <br /><br />Other daily gripes include the noise.&nbsp; The stairwells here absorb noise like no other I&#039;ve heard.&nbsp; Every footstep sounds like a bowling ball being dropped and you hear every word of conversation when someone is going up and down.&nbsp; Thankfully, in each building I believe there are only 10 apartments, but still, that can get tiring.&nbsp; Similarly, the walls and ceiling and floors are quite thin.&nbsp; Just hope that you don&#039;t get a neighbor with little kids, because those little feet running around above you get old really quick.&nbsp; There is also the street and courtyard noise.&nbsp; The usual apartment building shenanigans of drunk girls yelling, music blasting, and kids skateboarding every once in awhile.&nbsp; Summer weekend evenings are especially bad.&nbsp; <br /><br />I personally have also found the management company and super to be very unresponsive.&nbsp; <br /><br />Overall, in spite of the gripes there are plenty of good things about the apartment.&nbsp; It is pretty secure, requiring multiple keys for entry and now with a video buzzer system.&nbsp; It is also in a terrific location, just a five minute walk to the train station.&nbsp; Basically, it&#039;s an <em>okay </em> apartment for an <em>okay </em> price (now that they&#039;ve dropped it).&nbsp; I think most people who can afford to live here can do better, but they could also do a lot worse.

				Stay away from this place! I lived there 3 years. The grounds just got worse and worse while the cost went up and up. If you see their management offices, you&#039;ll see where all the money goes. It took 2 years to sell. I lost buyers because banks won&#039;t loan to them. Their words, not mine. Their finances are allegedly a mess. The management is allegedly corrupt. I have no proof, just heard from lawyers, banks and locals. Worst mistake I ever made. Stay away!

				Acropolis has a lot of problems. Aside from not taking care of the property, to being unresponsive to the residents. There are a group of drug dealers who go up on the roofs to scope out apartments for break-ins. They tried to crowbar my upstairs neighbor&#039;s apartment. One of our security guards was beaten up so bad he did not come back to work here.<br /><br /><br />We have a crazy elderly woman who spreads poison on the ground to kill animals including the cats that are kept on the grounds to deal with rodents. A dog died from poisoning. Trash is left to pile up in the alleyways which leaves flies, mosquitos and standing water to collect. <br /><br /><br />It&#039;s beyond ridiculous. They hide these things so that people coming in just see a facade of a potentially convenient place to live... in reality it&#039;s very stressful to live in a place where there are criminals and crazy people and a management company who could give two fucks about the people who live here.
