				I didn&#039;t see this anywhere but figured it might be worth mentioning that Mezzo Mezzo was shut down by the City.&nbsp; They are cleverly hiding this fact by propping open the door during the day and putting a sign up about being closed due to plumbing issues.&nbsp;

				I would have thought it was the Comedy Union that would shut them down. The &quot;Comedy&quot; nights with people impersonating comedians are looked down upon. Especially unfunny people impersonating comedians.

				I saw the sign this morning -- quickly looked in and the owner was sitting inside by the window, drinking his coffee. <br /><br />What&#039;s the real issue? I&#039;ve eaten there many times and always had a great experience.

				You asked, they got shut down by the health department for scoring a 63 (gross!) for these violations. It has to be VERY bad to get shut down.: <br /><br />Sanitary Violations<br />1) Cold food item held above 41ยบ F (smoked fish and reduced oxygen packaged foods above 38 ยบF) except during necessary preparation.<br />2) Raw, cooked or prepared food is adulterated, contaminated, cross-contaminated, or not discarded in accordance with HACCP plan.<br />3) Evidence of mice or live mice present in facility&#039;s food and/or non-food areas.<br />4) Personal cleanliness inadequate. Outer garment soiled with possible contaminant. Effective hair restraint not worn in an area where food is prepared.<br />5) Sanitized equipment or utensil, including in-use food dispensing utensil, improperly used or stored.<br />6) Facility not vermin proof. Harborage or conditions conducive to attracting vermin to the premises and/or allowing vermin to exist.<br />7) Plumbing not properly installed or maintained; anti-siphonage or backflow prevention device not provided where required; equipment or floor not properly drained; sewage disposal system in disrepair or not functioning properly.<br />8) Non-food contact surface improperly constructed. Unacceptable material used. Non-food contact surface or equipment improperly maintained and/or not properly sealed, raised, spaced or movable to allow accessibility for cleaning on all sides, above and underneath the unit.<br />

				Oh, c&#039;mon! That&#039;s not THAT bad!<br /><br />Just kidding. That&#039;s pretty awful. I&#039;ve still never had a bad meal in the almost eight years I&#039;ve been going there,&nbsp; but I think I&#039;ll definitely wait for them to pass inspection before visiting again. (Like I have a choice?)<br /><br />Blech.

				I know a couple of people that got sick after eating there. <br /><br />It&#039;s rare to know more than one person that has gotten sick after eating at the same restaurant, so I guess it&#039;s not a huge surprise to me.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m addicted to the NYC DOH inspection information site.<br /><br />They got 63 points on the 14th. Health inspector came back on the 25th (the second visit is not really a surprise, they tell the management they come back within two weeks) and they still didn&#039;t call an exterminator. The health department visited them for a third time three days later and still no exterminator, but it looks they tried to use some illegal pesticide and they still had rotten food around. Maybe they were using the pesticide on the food to try to make it last longer.

				No one wonder I got sick both times I ate there. I had grilled swordfish the last time and I called out of work two days in a row afterwards. I have not been back in 5 years and do not understand how they have stayed open for so long especially as Taverna Kyclades which is vastly superior is just one block up.&nbsp; The food was bland, the service, minimal at best. I feel bad for anyone who loses a job or money because of this, but this place is beyond hideous and deserves to be closed.

				Not that it&#039;s relevant to their health violations, but I went to breakfast at Mezzo Mezzo about 5 years ago and ordered waffles. The food took forever to show up, and when it finally did I was disappointed to find out my waffles were nothing more than cold soggy Eggos. I never went back.

				I&#039;ve probably eaten there every few months since I moved to the Ditmars area in 2003. Never had a bad meal, never been sick, never had bad service. I&#039;ve brought groups as big as 10-12 people there, nobody got sick, many of them returned on their own (and also did not get sick). And no, I don&#039;t have any financial stake in the restaurant, nor do I know anybody that works there (although the owner comes over during most meals to see how things are).<br /><br />For whatever it&#039;s worth.

				I hear those DOH fines can go up to the tens of thousands. (Note that I have no idea how much fines are for what infractions. I only know a coffee shop in Brooklyn got a B [16 points] and still had to pay $5k to the city ontop of what it cost to fix up their place). I wonder why he sat on heels to get a (relatively) cheap exterminator.
