				Hey guys! I&#039;m a graduate student working on a story about health insurance coverage in the neighborhood. Specifically, 20-something Astoria residents who do not have health insurance, and how this issue might affect their&nbsp; decision to vote this November. What do both candidate&#039;s health care plans offer that might affect your situation? <br /><br />If there is anyone out there who fits this criteria who wouldn&#039;t mind being interviewed for an article, please let me know! Any thoughts or opinions would be appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks!&nbsp; :-)<br />Jeanmarie<br />&nbsp;jeanmarie.evelly@journalism.cuny.edu
