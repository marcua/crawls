				I&#039;ve had good salads at Lite Bites on the corner of Steinway and Broadway. There is also a Panera Bread on 34th Ave that might make salads, although don&#039;t quote me on that since I have never been there.

				Not exactly what you were asking for, but the salads at Aliada are fantastic.&nbsp; My favorite is the Horiatiki with grilled chicken.
