			Hi all,<br /><br /><br />I am on a board of a condo building in Astoria (30 units) and we are looking for a new building management company. We&#039;d like to go with someone local but are open to suggestions. We are a young building (10 years) but need a company with experience. <br /><br /><br />Please reply to thread if you have any recommendations and thank you for your time.<br />Sincerely, Anita
