				HOLY CRAP<br />There are soooo many new folks roaming around here - Who knew? So the blackout did do some good.&nbsp; <br /><br />Options:<br />Beer Garden - Friday.... starting around 5??&nbsp; (Jonathan thinks it might be too crowded)<br />Hell Gate Social?? - could be great.&nbsp; (but it&#39;s so.... inconveniently located)<br />Other ideas that include outdoors (though it might be raining again by then)<br /><br />who&#39;s in<br /><br />If it&#39;s just the two of us... we can sit in our backyard and stare at each other (and that&#39;s getting a bit old actually)

				i like this idea. Sunswick, Irish Rover and Hell&#39;s Gate all sound like good options. And there&#39;s always my favorite - Crescent Lounge. <br /><br />I do think BG is likely to be crowded on a Friday night.

				Hell Gate has that nice outdoor place. <br /><br />I still have BAAAAAD memories of the drink I had at Crescent Lounge.&nbsp; Not inclined to go back in the near future.<br /><br />Sunswick has good food, which is cool, plus the 24 taps of mostly awesome beer.&nbsp; And the jukebox is mostly at a level where you can have a conversation.<br /><br />Just plain love the Irish Rover.&nbsp; Good beer.<br /><br />Also, Stini Yiamas, a new lounge place on Ditmars, which looks nice, and mostly empty.&nbsp; We could totally take it over!<br /><br />Rapture?

				hmmmm.... decisions.... decisions....<br /><br />i&#39;m all about meeting half way (could be that we live in midtown).&nbsp; Ditmars is too far for the downtowners and Sunswick is just as far for those who live uptown.&nbsp; Rover and Rapture are pretty centrally located - though neither has outdoors.&nbsp; Rover doesn&#39;t have food - but ordering in is always an option.&nbsp; <br /><br />the other issue...<br /><br />time check??<br />who&#39;s on summer hours - who&#39;s not??<br /><br />If I head out at 5 I&#39;ll be done by 9 .... no.... stamina anymore.... <br /><br />an idea....<br />how many have bikes... or other transportation to get to water taxi beach???<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I love these ideas, but I don&#39;t have a bike or summer hours. <br /><br />Um... can&#39;t we get in trouble for bringing liquor into the park? I am a big fan of booze on the grass, but won&#39;t a big crowd of us whooping it up attract some attention? Or am I just paranoid?

				I&#39;ve always thought of 30th Avenue as the Center, but I could be wrong.<br />I do think bringing alcohol in open containers (including bottles) into the park is likely to result in tickets.&nbsp; I know people do it, I just think you take the risk of the fine if you do.

				Greetings Astorians,<br /><br />The Gates normally open at 7pm, but we would be more than happy to open our doors at 6pm to host your mixer.&nbsp; Although we do not serve food you are welcome to order something and enjoy it here. $4 beers and $4 HGS martinis and cocktails from 6-8pm.<br />DJ Skizz from NYU radio is having his b-day party here at 9:30. The party is open to everyone but we would need to clear the food by 8:30pm.<br /><br />We hope this information was helpful.<br /><br />
