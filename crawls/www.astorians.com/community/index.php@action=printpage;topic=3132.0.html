				I did a juice/water cleanse in the spring... I was trying to do it for several days, but only ended up lasting a day. I felt really great afterwards, and it was much easier than I thought, but again, only one day, so would like to do a longer one. There&#39;s tons of information about different types of cleanses online, recipes for juices, etc. I might have some info/receipes at home if you&#39;re interested.

				I&#039;ve started day 4 of the Master Cleanse - it&#039;s the lemon, maple syrup, cayenne pepper cleanse.&nbsp; And I have to say.... um.... <br />not sure what i have to say - but I think it would be a lot easier to do WITH someone. <br /><br />It&#039;s not that I&#039;m hungry - but I WANT TO EAT.&nbsp; B/c that&#039;s what I like to do... I like to eat.&nbsp; I&#039;m not out for a birthday dinner right now - didn&#039;t go out to happy hour after work - will not be going to the staff end of the year party - or the astorians mixer or or or... it doesn&#039;t matter -&nbsp; there will be MANY MANY more food opportunities ahead of me (3 - 5 a day for the next 50 years at least)... but ... it&#039;s BORING. <br /><br />I&#039;m a bit light headed and don&#039;t really feel like doing anything.&nbsp; I dont want to be around people eating ... I could go walk manhattan... maybe tomorrow.&nbsp; I thought about trying to work out - they say you can do it... but... I don&#039;t know.... <br /><br />I don&#039;t have the burst of energy that some say they get -nor am I falling over faint or anything like that - I just want to put some food in my mouth and chew and swallow.&nbsp; Instead I drink this lemonade (which IS delicious) and then look forward to sipping my tea later on this eve.&nbsp; <br /><br />Please - give words of encouragement - especially those of you who have done this.&nbsp; <br /><br />thanks<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Are you unable to concentrate at work, feel sluggish and out of whack? If so, you might benefit from a cleanse. Here are some other symptoms to look for:<br /><br />1. Headaches<br />2. Skin problems<br />3. Bad breath or body odor<br />4. Candida overgrowth<br />5. Depression<br />6. Mental dullness or poor memory<br />7. Stomach bloat or gas<br />8. Poor digestion<br />9. Weight gain or unnecessary weight loss<br />10. Constipation<br />11. Premature aging<br />12.

				it is BRUTAL, but nothing eliminates excess water/fat from the stomach like the South Beach Diet. If you follow it strictly, and I mean STRICTLY, it does work. Of course, like all diets, it is not a permanent way to weight losss, but I saw results in the 1st week. Sorry, do I sound like a late-night infomercial????&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br />Anyway, cut out sugar, dairy (with very minimal low-fat exceptions), coffee, alcochol, simple carbs (potatoes, carrots, beets, all fruit) and breads (including whole wheat and other grains) for the 1st 2 weeks. Low-fat protein, vegetables, eggs, ricotta, and nuts (in moderation, of course) are allowed.<br /><br />So, the upside is losing 2-8 lbs a week, depending on if you&#039;re a man or a woman and how much you have to lose. Yes, a lot of this is water weight, but you&#039;ll lose actual fat, too. The downside is because you&#039;re not eating carbs, by the end of the 1st week, you will feel your entire body and muscles aching, you will feel like an old granny walking up the stairs. But, it does work.<br /><br />I&#039;ve done this 3 times now and with each time, I have less and less enthusiasm for sticking to it. But if you can follow the plan for the 1st two weeks, you&#039;ll be amazed and how much excess you lose in the stomach area, (that&#039;s where I saw it first, anyway).<br />

				I really like cleanses but they are hard -- and difficult to do without support.&nbsp; It&#039;s only a few days and you&#039;re doing so awesome!&nbsp; You have really good reasons going in.&nbsp; Have you thought about &quot;chewing&quot; your lemonade?&nbsp; Weird but possible.&nbsp; Not terribly satisfying but you might try it with a few sips and see if it helps with the need to chew.<br /><br />I&#039;d tend to say skip food related outings for the next few days while you finish this up.&nbsp; Food is a very social activity which is why I think cleansing can be so hard alone.&nbsp; It&#039;s strangely isolating in unexpected ways.<br /><br />-j

				Jennifer!&nbsp; <br />I&#039;ve done master cleanse and a bunch of other juice-fasts of my own design.&nbsp; I try to do two a year.&nbsp; Juice-fasts are a little easier for me because you can change flavors.&nbsp; They are brutal but mostly because you will be invited to more food and drink-related events than ever before and can&#039;t go and feel lonely.&nbsp; And god, you miss chewing and tasting things.&nbsp; You feel great afterwards, though.&nbsp; I think I once compared it to working overtime at a crappy job: it sucks while you&#039;re there but it&#039;s great when you finally get the paycheck.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hang in there.&nbsp; You&#039;ll be glad you did.&nbsp; Be careful with the salt water flushes.&nbsp; Don&#039;t do it every day.&nbsp; They can be rough on the system.<br /><br />Oh, and LOTS of people will tell you you&#039;re crazy.&nbsp; Eating is natural so people are uncomfortable with the idea of <em>not</em> eating.&nbsp; It&#039;s easier to do it with a friend, for sure.&nbsp; You can think of un-food-related activities together.&nbsp; The other thing is to drink lots of water in addition to the lemonade.&nbsp; (I mean, don&#039;t pound water like a psycho but always be sipping water or the lemonade throughout the whole day.&nbsp; You know what I mean.)&nbsp; GOOD LUCK!&nbsp; PM me if you have any questions.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve also ranted about juice-fasting on my blog, if you&#039;re interested: <br /><br />http://plasticbraintrain.blogspot.com/2007/01/fast-track-to-popularity.html<br />http://plasticbraintrain.blogspot.com/2007/01/fast-and-curious.html

				I&#039;m really curious.&nbsp; Is this a practice many doctors recommend, or is it something unpopular with them like an old wive&#039;s tale that&#039;s&nbsp; been going around a long time?&nbsp; What are some web sites you recommend where one can read up more on this?&nbsp; Many nutritionists don&#039;t seem to recommend crash diets like Atkins, etc., but rather learning how to eat better in general.&nbsp; Because once you&#039;re off the diet, you gain weight again.&nbsp; And Atkins had problems with credibility.&nbsp; Don&#039;t know about South Beach Diet.&nbsp; Does cleansing have the same controversy?&nbsp; Are doctors who recommend them considered hacks?&nbsp; I realize all this sounds very ignorant of the practice, but I am ignorant of it.&nbsp; I&#039;m the type who if I don&#039;t eat breakfast or anything first thing in the morning, I get listless, no energy, and a huge headache the rest of the day.&nbsp; I doubt I&#039;d even be able to drag myself to work.&nbsp; How does one get past that?

				Thanks MagicPie.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t want to have a big debate either.&nbsp; I was just curious about something I understand very little about.&nbsp; If I&#039;m going to do something like this, I like to know exactly what I&#039;m doing to my body, and if it&#039;s the wisest decision for me.&nbsp; It&#039;s all about research.&nbsp; Thanks for providing the websites.

				Oh, okay, you&#039;re welcome.&nbsp; &nbsp; :-)&nbsp; There are also about a million books on fasting.&nbsp; There&#039;s no <em>one way</em> to do it right.

				Daisy, here are a couple of more links I found. <br /><br /><br />http://www.happynews.com/news/532007/master-cleanse-garners-praise-criticism.htm <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Medical authorities say they have yet to see any evidence of harm from the Master Cleanse, though experts generally caution against extended fasting and other extreme diets. <br /><br />They say those who try the Master Cleanse to lose weight will just gain it back. And they dispute the claim that the Master Cleanse or any other diet can &#039;&#039;detoxify&#039;&#039; the body from the effects of red meat, sugar, fried foods or alcohol — or that the body needs to be detoxified at all. <br /><br />&#039;&#039;We have organ systems such as the liver, spleen, lungs, skin and digestive system that we have all been given that do that,&#039;&#039; said David Grotto, a dietitian in Chicago and a spokesman for the American Dietetic Association. <br /><br />Dr. Ed Zimney, the medical director of HealthTalk, a Seattle-based Web site where a lively debate about the cleanse has flourished, said: &#039;&#039;Your gastrointestinal tract does not need to be cleaned out because it is constantly in motion. This whole idea of cleaning out toxins from the colon is a complete myth and unnecessary.&#039;&#039;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Cleanse<br />This is one of those wikipedia articles that has a note saying some info needs to be verified. <br /><br />I think I found a resource for looking up things in medical journals a while ago, but I have to hunt for it.

				and here&#039;s something about colonic irrigation at quackwatch. <br /><br />http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/massage.html<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The procedure is said to &quot;detoxify&quot; the body. Its advocates claim that, as a result of intestinal stasis, intestinal contents putrefy, and toxins are formed and absorbed, which causes chronic poisoning of the body. This &quot;autointoxication&quot; theory was abandoned by the scientific community during the 1930s. No such &quot;toxins&quot; have ever been identified, and careful observations have shown that individuals in good health can vary greatly in bowel habits. Proponents may also suggest that fecal material collects on the lining of the intestine and causes trouble unless removed by laxatives, colonic irrigation, special diets, and/or various herbs or food supplements that &quot;cleanse&quot; the body. The falsity of this notion is obvious to doctors who perform intestinal surgery or peer within the large intestine with a diagnostic instrument. Fecal material does not adhere to the intestinal lining. Colonic irrigation is not only therapeutically worthless but can cause fatal electrolyte imbalance. Cases of death due to intestinal perforation and infection (from contaminated equipment) have also been reported [5].</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Also at quackwatch ...<br /><br />http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/detox.html<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The detoxification theory can enable con artists to gain great power over their customers by diagnosing and curing &quot;potentially fatal&quot; (but nonexistent) illnesses. &quot;They have to invent the idea of toxins,&quot; says Peter Fodor, president of the Lipoplasty Society of North America, &quot;because that gives them something to pretend they can fix.&quot;<br /><br />It can be terrifying to believe that one&#039;s body is being poisoned by toxins from within. But if this were true, the human race would not have survived, says Vincent F. Cordaro, M.D., an FDA medical officer. &quot;A person who retained wastes and toxins would be very ill and could die if not treated. The whole concept is irrational and unscientific.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				one more link ... when I browsed a few sites on cleansing/fasting i saw comments about feelings that reminded me of the response to anorexia that was described in this article:<br /><br />http://www.slate.com/id/2164436/entry/2164437/<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">More importantly, once someone has been restricting food for a certain amount of time, she discovers advantages, not appearance-related, in the way that her mind and body respond to starvation. After this point, the anorexic is motivated by a cost-benefit analysis that sounds very much like the calorie restrictor&#039;s: &quot;This is worth the effort/pain/fighting with my parents, because of X benefit.&quot; In my case, there were several noticeable pluses. Being hungry gave me energy. It helped me focus on my work. It made me feel emotional and creative in a way that I enjoyed. At the time, in fact, I believed I was eating as I did much more for the intellectual and creative edge it gave me than to look thin.<br /><br />Now I understand what happened better: My starvation triggered the release of endorphins. In evolutionary terms, this is designed to give humans heightened coping powers in an emergency. In my case, it gave me a sense of well-being and made me feel sharp and energetic. This feeling became an addiction, so that I pursued it even as my tolerance level rose and the same amount of endorphins no longer produced the same effect, at which point I became quite depressed.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

I&#039;m not seeing it.&nbsp; Though I do look pretty good if I may say so myself.&nbsp; MC or end of the school year happiness or new hair product or 5k training or or or... so many possibilities.&nbsp; <br /><br />I certainly don&#039;t think I&#039;m hurting myself by doing this.&nbsp; It&#039;s been an interesting week of food avoidance, food discussion avoidance, food picture (moving and still) avoidance.&nbsp; If you know me beyond this board - you know that these are all very difficult things to avoid in my home.&nbsp; <br /><br />And then there&#039;s something else to look forward to - when its all over we&#039;re celebrating at Pure Food.&nbsp; Yum<br /><br /><br />
