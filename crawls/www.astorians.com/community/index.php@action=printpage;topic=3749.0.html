				Yesterday I was walking along a crowded subway platform and I heard someone say, quite sincerely, &quot;I love New York.&quot; I immediately knew she was not from New York and probably does not live here. If she has lived here, she&#39;s probably been here for under 3 months. <br /><br />What do you think are the tell-tale signs of NYers and non-NYers?

				Eh, what? I&#39;ve been here for more than three years and have been known to make such sappy statements (often even sincerely)! <br /><br />I think one difference is that non-NYers and NYers like different aspects of the city. I don&#39;t think many long-time NYers have fond feelings for Times Square, particularly the new Disnified version, for example. Also, I think that people who live here have a stronger appreciation for the multi-cultural aka melting-pot aka cosmopolitan yet grungy diversity of the city, while people who don&#39;t just like the big buildings and the places to go shopping.

				I&#39;ve been here for over 3 years, too, and I say it sometimes - sincerely, but always with a &quot;but&quot; in my voice. Except when I&#39;m returning from a visit to oklahoma - then my statement is pure. <br /><br />I&#39;ve never heard anyone who grew up here say it, though. Not saying that they don&#39;t, but I haven&#39;t heard it.

				Off the top of my head, I can think of three native New Yorkers who have told me numerous times that they love NY.&nbsp; Additionaly, when my friend Jessica was alive, she used to tell me how much she loved NY.&nbsp; Toward the end of her life she especially loved it.<br /><br />I love NY.&nbsp; I&#39;m not a native.&nbsp; But I don&#39;t think that matters.<br /><br />I am also proud of my Californian roots.&nbsp; And as a former resident of the Bay Area!

				I love New York ... even when I&nbsp; hate it. When I &quot;hate&quot; it, I simply see it as being akin to complaining about a family member ... you still love them, but they have that special ability to annoy you in a way only they can ...<br /><br />As for what &quot;makes a New Yorker&quot;? Well, I was originally going to write something snarky like, &quot;the ability to survive here.&quot; But, that&#39;s not enough, so, therein lies what I believe to be the answer to your question: there is neither one nor one hundred things that make a New Yorker. (<em>And isn&#39;t that the reason why most folks move to this city? Because they believe [right or wrong, romanticized or not] they can be anything they want here?</em>)

				I agree with Dulouzcats.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been here over 15 years now and I really love NYC.&nbsp; I may get aggravated with aspects of it from time to time, but they don&#39;t lessen my love for the city.&nbsp; I can&#39;t imagine living anywhere else.&nbsp; There is just so much vibrancy, energy and excitement here, so many opportunities to see, taste or hear things you would not be able to elsewhere.&nbsp; NYC is an incredible place and I consider myself lucky to live here (though I wish people would be more polite and the trains would run better, and that we had a decent Chinese restaurant and bookstore in Astoria)&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)

				And of course, it took me about 15 seconds after moving here to figure out that nobody ever calls 6th and 7th Aves &quot;Avenue of the Americas&quot; or &quot;Fashion Ave.&quot; It took me a bit longer, perhaps a few days, to realize that no one here calls subway lines by their colors, as they do in other places.

				For me, what characterizes New Yorkers and New York in general, is the pace of life and the hustle of people trying to make their way in the city and get ahead.&nbsp; <br /><br />And what definitely doesn&#39;t characterize New Yorkers is being so impressed with the subway that one performs pole dances around the handrails.&nbsp; Those types of folks usually get off the train at 34th or 42nd.

I also do hear other New Yorkers refer to the different subway lines by their color as well.

				Okay, I didn&#39;t make this up. I was forwarded this in an email 5 years ago, and I loved it so much I kept it. Perhaps others have already seen it.<br /><br />YOU ARE A NEW YORKER IF......<br /><br />1. You say &quot;The City&quot; and expect everyone to know that this means Manhattan.<br />2. You have never been to the Statue of Liberty or the Empire State Building.<br />3. You can get into a 4-hour argument about how to get from Columbus Circle to Battery Park at 3:30 on the Friday before a long weekend, but can&#39;t find Wisconsin on a map.<br />4. Hookers and the homeless are invisible to you.<br />5. The subway map makes sense to you.<br />6. You think the subway should never be called anything prissy, like the Metro.<br />7. You believe that being able to swear at people in their own language makes you bilingual.<br />8. You&#39;ve considered smacking someone just for saying &quot;The BigApple.&quot;<br />9. Your door has more than two locks.<br />10. The most frequently used part of your car is the horn.<br />11. You consider eye contact an act of overt aggression.<br />12. You call an 8&#39; x 10&#39; plot of patchy grass a yard.<br />13. You consider Westchester &quot;Upstate.&quot;<br />14. You cried the day Ed Koch took over for Judge Wapner.<br />15. You walk faster than some people run.<br />16. You see nothing odd about the speed of an auctioneer&#39;s speaking.<br />17. You&#39;re paying $1,200 for a studio the size of a walk-in closet and you think it&#39;s a &quot;steal.&quot;<br />18. You&#39;ve been to New Jersey twice and got lost both times.<br />19. You pay more each month to insure your car than most people in the US pay in rent.<br />20. You haven&#39;t seen more than twelve stars in the night sky since you went away to camp as a kid.<br />21. You go to dinner at 9pm and head out to the clubs when most Americans are heading to bed.<br />22. Your closet is filled with black clothes.<br />23. When foreigners ask directions, you are nice to them. When other NewYorkers ask directions, you ignore them.<br />24. You pay $5 without blinking for a beer that cost the bar 28 cents.<br />25. You take fashion seriously.<br />26. When you pass a celebrity on the street, you don&#39;t go to pieces.<br />27. You have 27 different menus next to your telephone.<br />28. Going to Brooklyn is considered a &quot;road trip.&quot;<br />29. America west of the Hudson is still theoretical to you.<br />30. You&#39;ve stopped thinking about how many hands touched the subway pole.<br />31. You&#39;re suspicious of strangers who are actually nice to you.<br />32. You haven&#39;t cooked a meal since helping Mom last Thanksgiving.<br />33. You take a taxi to get to your health club to exercise.<br />34. Your idea of &quot;personal space&quot; is no one actually breathing on you.<br />35. $50 worth of groceries fit in one paper bag.<br />36. You have a minimum of five &quot;worst cab ride ever&quot; stories.<br />37. You don&#39;t hear sirens anymore.<br />38. You&#39;ve mentally blocked out all thoughts of the city&#39;s air quality and what it&#39;s doing to your lungs.<br />39. You live/work in a building with a larger population than some American towns.<br />40. Your doorman is Russian, your grocer is Korean, your deli man is Israeli, your building super is Italian, your laundry guy is Chinese,your favorite bartender is Irish, your favorite diner owner is Greek,the watch seller on your corner is Senegalese, your last cabbie was Pakistani, your newsstand guy is Indian and your favorite falafel guy is Egyptian.

				Loved the top 40 list - Most amusing and how true. I do have 2 slight disagreements:<br />Harlan - Though I&#39;m a native NY&#39;er - I love Times Square. I have many fond memories of Broadway and having worked there while still a teen for The David Frost Show as a page/production assistant. I really enjoy the new Disneyfied version more, anyone who really like the hookers and syringe filled 42 ST of the past is more cynical than I can imagine or putting you on.<br /><br />Benny - My dad (also a native NY&#39;er) and most of his generation always gave directions (drove me nuts) on subways by referencing the IRT, BMT et. all as that was the way it was when they were originally seperate private companies .<br /><br />To me a New Yorker is someone born and bred here - 15 years ! you&#39;re just getting your feet wet.<br /><br />

She had to explain it to me. Never ever occured to me that people would use the colors.<br />-I know how long the flashing &quot;walk sign blinks&quot; before going solid &quot;dont walk&quot;. 10 seconds.<br />and the solid &quot;dont walk&quot; gives you 5 seconds before the light turns green and you get smooshed.<br />-Everyone knows the city or NYC is Manhattan only.<br />-Doesnt everyone fold the pizza that way?<br /><br />

				HA HA HA!&nbsp; The is the second time in recent memory that I singlehandedly derailed a whole thread by making a comment about pizza.&nbsp; I guess I just have mozz on the brain!<br /><br />As regards New York vs. Chicago pizza:&nbsp; I lived in Chicago for four years, and I have lived in new York for five, and I have been a student much of that time- so let&#39;s just say that I know something about pizza.&nbsp; But I want to make a point that is often overlooked.&nbsp; There&#39;s a book written by the Russian literature scholar George Steiner called _Tolstoy or Dostoevsky: An Essay in Contrast_ or some such thing.&nbsp; My favorite professor in college always used to say, &quot;Why write a book like that- Tolstoy OR Dostoevsky?&nbsp; We don&#39;t have to pick one.&nbsp; We can have both!&quot;&nbsp; I feel the same way about New York and Chicago pizza - they&#39;re totally different pies, but why argue about which is better- in their ideal form, they&#39;re both excellent in their own way, and we can have BOTH!&nbsp; Stuffed pizza at a place like Giordano&#39;s or Connies or Eduardo&#39;s or Gino&#39;s East is a beatiful thing - nothing like it.&nbsp; And thin-crust pizza at Lombardi&#39;s or a Sicilian slice at DiFara is heavenly.&nbsp; And, I would also say, that old school New Haven a-beets needs to be thrown into the discussion as well. But let&#39;s face it, folks- there&#39;s no shortage of pizza, and no shortage of us to enjoy it.&nbsp; <br /><br />And Chicago architecture does rock the house, eh Harlan?<br /><br />bennyt

				I like to think of myself as being made up of a little bit of everywhere I&#39;ve lived -- California, Oregon, New Jersey, New York. <br /><br />I think the biggest adjustment for me when I moved here almost 4 years ago was getting used to the incredible convenience of New York. In most cases, ANYTHING you could possibly want is within walking distance and/or a short cab/subway ride away. Or better yet -- it can be delivered. My non-native friends and I refer to New York as &quot;the bubble,&quot; because it really is its own little world. The concept of getting into a car and driving long distances to reach a destination is lost on a lot of native New Yorkers, and yet, this is how (most of) the rest of the country lives.<br /><br />I think my first taste of New Yorker-ness came after I had been here for a year or so and went home to Cali to visit my parents. I was shocked and appalled that the lone Chinese restaurant in the neighborhood 1) closed at 9 p.m. 2) didn&#39;t deliver.

				Its when you are lame enough to order a big fat bagel but still sticking to your low-carb diet and so you instruct the hapless bagel person to literally cut-out (or &quot;scoop out&quot;) the doughy fluffy bready goodness that is the innards of the bagel. They then pack the pace in with a kilo of cream cheese, thus maximizing the bagel&#39;s caloric load. Genius. I&#39;ve ordered one, I&#39;ll admit. But I&#39;m not a real New Yorker by any stretch of the imagination so I did it with impunity.

				<br />Oh this thread is too funny!! First it derails into pizza discussions, then some people try to get it back on track into the &#39;what makes a new yorker&#39; topic, and now it derails into bagel analyses. It just. can&#39;t. stay. away. from food! What will be next, I wonder... <br /><br />Typical Astorians - all you can think about is food! ;-) Though I suppose it could be argued to all be on-topic, since bagel and pizza analyses are very New York!<br /><br />Anyways, I agree with Flooz - if you identify with New York and feel like you&#39;re a New Yorker - then you are. <br /><br />

				Not to stray too much from the topic of conversation (bagels), but I just thought of one more thing that is very New York - &quot;youse&quot;.&nbsp; Of course, people in other (East Coast) cities say this too.&nbsp; But if you hear someone in New York say this, chances are, they&#39;re not NOT a New Yorker.<br /><br />Also, I tell you one funny story about bagels.&nbsp; One time when I was visiting my parents, I woke up in the morning and went downstairs to the kitchen.&nbsp; And what did I see?&nbsp; My sister sitting in the breakfast room eating a bagel sandwich with something unrecognizable on it.&nbsp; Upon closer inspection, I realized that it was the leftover cashew chicken from our Chinese food the night before.&nbsp; Let me say that again.&nbsp; My sister was eating a cashew chicken sandwich on a bagel for breakfast.&nbsp; Unbelievable.&nbsp; It sounds so wrong and yet so New York and yet so wrong (but so good?).&nbsp; It&#39;s another one of those New York things run-amock.<br />

				Wow, off the boards for a few days and all hell breaks loose!<br /><br />As for the scooped out bagel: The only people ive ever seen do that (and not talking upper east side) are the old guys.&nbsp; And it wasnt to save on carbs it was to stuff the bagel even more with bagel filling goodness like cream cheese, smoked salmon,, sable, chopped herring, etc...&nbsp; &nbsp;MMM&nbsp; extra goodness....<br /><br />And Essa bagels rocks! Right on Annie! Just about the best around.&nbsp; Used to love Bagels on the square (village) but they changed hands years ago.&nbsp; H+H just aint what it used to be.<br /><br />And to be fair, ive never had real Chicago style pizza so I dont know how it is. But New york pizza eaten by the slice is easiest folded.&nbsp; Is there a place to get good Chicago pizza in NYC?&nbsp; Not that it would be better but would still like to try it.<br /><br />And doesnt all of this commentary just add to the notion that this is what makes a NYer?&nbsp; <br /><br />I wonder where to find the best falafal....<br />

				yeah, there is soooooo much more great and cheap Mexican food in Chicago than there is in New York (MUCH bigger Mexican population there). &nbsp;And the best thing about it is that it&#39;s not limited to the predominantly Mexican neighborhoods (e.g. Pilsen). &nbsp;You can get great Mexican on the South Side, the North Side, the West Side. &nbsp;It&#39;s fantastic. &nbsp;Next best thing to California &nbsp;:-)<br /><br />And two more things- Lombardi&#39;s might be the first, but Frank Pepe out of New Haven claims to have invented his own style of coal-oven pizza, and like I keep saying over and over on this thread, it&#39;s DA BOMB. &nbsp;Respec&#39;.<br /><br />And regardless of Chicago pizza being a spin-off of the earlier New York pizza, it has certainly evolved into an entirely different animal, which can&#39;t even begin to be compared with its East Coast cousin. &nbsp;Stop ragging on each other&#39;s pizza. &nbsp;Go to friggin Giordano&#39;s or Gino&#39;s East and let a properly executed Chicago stuffed pie put you into permanent shock and awe. &nbsp;

				You know, after rereading all of this and seeing all the opinions.&nbsp; I would have to say that Yes a true NYer likes to claim that its because you were born here or lived here forever. But it really seems like what makes a NYer is one who has adapted one way or another to the way of life here.&nbsp; It is a very unique and harrowing or exciting life for some and its not for all.&nbsp; <br /><br />For example if you make your way through the crowds without slowing others down or getting frustrated you are probably a NYer.<br /><br />Or if you dont fold your pizza in half and are not afraid to argue other wise.<br /><br />You get the point.
