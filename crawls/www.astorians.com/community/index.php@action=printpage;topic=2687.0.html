				Queens Democratic Chairman Thomas Manton Dies<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />WASHINGTON (1010 WINS)&nbsp; -- Queens Democratic Chairman Thomas Manton, a former congressman who for years wielded his influence to shape New York City&#39;s political landscape, has died. He was 73.<br /><br />The seven-term congressman died Saturday, said Rep. Joseph Crowley, who took Manton&#39;s Queens congressional seat when he retired.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Elected 20 years ago to his post as county party chair, Manton was known as a behind-the-scenes politician who fostered the careers of City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and other local political figures.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />When he announced his retirement from Congress in 1998, he successfully hand-picked Crowley, then a state assemblyman, as his successor, and he played a role in the selection of the two most recent City Council speakers.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />``He was a great man and a great friend and he&#39;ll be terribly missed,&#39;&#39; Crowley said Sunday. ``He&#39;s left the Queens Democratic party in a very strong position.&#39;&#39;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Manton served 15 years on the New York City Council before taking over Geraldine Ferraro&#39;s congressional seat when she ran for vice president in 1984. As a congressman, he had little problem getting re-elected, winning with 87 percent of the vote in 1994.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />He said his years as a city councilman made him sensitive to the needs of constituent service and set the tone for his congressional career, which was focused on local concerns and New York City politics.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />As the head of the county party, he helped choose the city&#39;s leaders and, Crowley said, helped open up the party leadership to minority groups.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />``He was a steady rudder of the ship who brought the Queens party back from its lowest ebb. He diversified the leadership of the county, welcoming minority leaders,&#39;&#39; said Crowley.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Born in 1932 to Irish immigrant parents in Manhattan, Manton carved a colorful career path, serving as a New York City police officer, an IBM salesman and a flight navigator for the U.S. Marine Corps. He worked as a lawyer for decades, reportedly retiring from that work just months before his death.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Many expect that Crowley will again follow in Manton&#39;s footsteps to assume the county leadership post, but the congressman said it was too early to discuss possible successors.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />``It remains to be seen what the void will mean,&#39;&#39; he said.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Manton and his wife, Diane, raised their four children in Woodside, Queens. They eventually moved to Astoria.&nbsp; <br />
