				News alert: Trump won. The way the system works is the president is decided by the electoral college vote. <br /><br />The popular vote was essentially a tie with Hillary winning by .5%. The electoral college looks at the whole country and recognizes that every state has different needs, and it respects state power. Plus, we are the United STATES of American, not the United STATE. Most importantly, 52.2% of American voters voted for someone other than Hillary (Trump, Johnson, Stein). So, voting FOR her was not the popular choice.<br /><br />I think rethinking the electoral college is legitimate but not now. It needs to happen before the next election. You can&#039;t change the rules just because you are upset Hillary lost.

Nobody is asking for rules to be set aside in the above petition, the petition is for the electoral voters to vote not for the candidate of their party but for someone else. In most states they have the right to do so, in some states their votes won&#039;t be counted if they do, and in some states there&#039;s a moderate fine as a result. But if they vote differently than they said they would it isn&#039;t a change of the rules.<br /><br />So, while that petition might &quot;sicken you&quot; it&#039;s far far worse and far more sickening that someone whines about the petition without fully understanding just how the system works AND presumably having the right to vote.<br /><br />Maybe there really should be a &quot;drivers license&quot; for voting.

				And the right answer is that this whole conversation belongs in <strong>Random Gabble </strong>and I hope the moderators will move it there ASAP.&nbsp; While we can argue that nearly any issue affects local residents, such as the fact that the sun rose today, this is not a local issue.&nbsp; It has already become divisive, which goes against the core mission of this entire site.

You may not like what he did during his presidency but saying he did nothing is a lie. Start with his Wikipedia page to refresh your memory:<br /><br /><br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama#Presidency_.282009.E2.80.932017.29<br /><br /><br />If you have specific objections to what he did, highlight them. Think critically, express yourself intelligently. As an aside, I did not like everything that Obama did, but I would be fooling myself - and frankly, sound ignorant and uninformed - if I made a blanket statement like &quot;Obama did nothing for 8 years.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Just because Trump is a liar doesn&#039;t mean we all have to be.
