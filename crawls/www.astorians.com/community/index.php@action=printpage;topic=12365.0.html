				There was a fire at the flatiron-shaped apartment building on the corner of 41st St and Newtown Rd this afternoon.<br /><br />I do not think anyone was injured.<br /><br />There is clearly serious damage to the upper floor of the building: smoke and flames through the roof.

				We live across the street from the fire location. We got home around 5:30pm to glass on the street, part of a tree cut down and lots of boards stacked up for covering windows.&nbsp; Apparently a woman was at home on the third floor taking a nap. A fire started somewhere in the apartment and she was trapped. Her husband was downstairs (street level) and never smelled or heard a thing. Neighbors say the same.&nbsp; She wanted to jump out the window to safety but fire department not there yet. Some neighbors came out with a big drop cloth and some other neighbors grabbed a mattress.&nbsp; They held the drop cloth tight over the mattress and she jumped. Totally fine from the jump but went to the hospital for smoke and shock(?). Same for her husband.&nbsp; This is all second hand but it&#039;s from two neighbors who were there and one of them got the drop cloth.&nbsp; Sounds like a bunch of Heroes living on our block.&nbsp; Anyway, looks like they will be boarding up the third floor for a demo job. No one said anything about the 1st or 2nd floors so not sure of their status. <br /><br />
