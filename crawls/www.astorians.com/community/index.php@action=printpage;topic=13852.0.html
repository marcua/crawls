				Has anyone taken a class? Which one? How was online compared to in person? Was it worth the money?<br /><br />For those who did take a class, who are you? Why did you take the class? Just for fun or aspiring writers? Working writers honing skills?<br /><br />I see the boxes everywhere and I&#039;m intrigued, but I&#039;d like some real testimonials (other than on the website) before I sign up.<br /><br />thanks!

				I tend to be of the opinion that those things are nearly always a rip-off. Any really good schools or workshops are usually identifiable by the availability of scholarships.

				I haven&#039;t taken Gotham, but I&#039;ve taken writing classes through the University I work at.&nbsp; They were all non-credit and I think fairly comparable in size, structure and price to Gotham&#039;s.&nbsp; The general consensus is they are helpful, but not THAT helpful.&nbsp; So the question becomes, does what you get from the class justify the cost?<br /><br />Online classes versus in person classes don&#039;t vary too much.&nbsp; You ultimately are paying for feedback from the teacher.&nbsp; Maybe there&#039;s a few exercises you can do in class, but you don&#039;t really get anything out of writing in a class setting.&nbsp; Live classes do give you feedback from other students and perhaps networking opportunities.&nbsp; So this depends on the type of writing.&nbsp; Screenwriting might be a better candidate for online since you&#039;re not going to get usable feedback from students by reading 3 pages of a screenplay.&nbsp; While, comedy writing is better suited for live classes so you can hear if something&#039;s funny.&nbsp; <br /><br />Both classes I&#039;ve taken were a diverse mix of students.&nbsp; There was always a couple of &quot;serious&quot; writers, an 18 yr old fresh out of HS, a bored housewife, a couple young professionals, and a few people just there on a whim.<br /><br />The best advice I can give is figure out what class you want to do, find out who the instructor is and research them.&nbsp; What are the credentials?&nbsp; How long have they been teaching?&nbsp; And keep in mind this information will probably not be easy to come by.&nbsp; Also, shop around.&nbsp; We&#039;re in one of the greatest cities in the world for this.&nbsp; There&#039;s a decent amount of competition.&nbsp; For honest testimonials and review, do some extensive google or blog searches.&nbsp; People (especially aspiring writers) always blog about this stuff.&nbsp; &quot;I&#039;m taking this workshop at so-and-so and the teacher sucks cause they say everything is &#039;great&#039;...&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Ultimately, if it&#039;s something you really want to do, you might just have to roll the dice on it.&nbsp; Worse comes to worse, what a class does do well is it forces you to write.&nbsp; You become a better writer from instruction, but more so by practice.&nbsp; Being required to produce new material once a week is sometimes enough of a kick in the butt to get people motivated, and start taking it more seriously.<br /><br />
