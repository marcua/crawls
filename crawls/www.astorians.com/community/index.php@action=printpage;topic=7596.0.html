				A few years ago there weren&#039;t any sushi places around Ditmars and now there are too many.&nbsp; There are 4 sushi places on Ditmars Blvd. and a new one opening on 23rd Ave. right near Fresh Start. I don&#039;t know how they will all stay in business. :-o

				Has anyone tried the new place just up the block from Watawa?&nbsp; If so, is it worth checking out?&nbsp; We have walked by a couple of times but it never looked like anyone was in there.&nbsp; I love Watawa and eat there a lot so just wondered how this new place compares.

				I just today saw the sign for the one where Christos was... They&#039;ll have hibachi too, it said, so maybe that&#039;ll be a nice change from the pure-sushi places. But yeah, I can&#039;t imagine all of these restaurants will still be in business 12 months from now. Hopefully it&#039;ll be the better ones that stick around, not the ones that use the cheapest fish...

				What bugs me about the plethora of sushi/Japanese places on Ditmars is none of them seem to be Japanese-operated. Not sure if any are Japanese-owned or not, but I don&#039;t see a whole lot of Japanese people eating in them or waiting tables in them, or making the sushi. I haven&#039;t been to Nebuta yet, but it seems that might fit the bill.. but Astoria Blvd is far for me to go for take-out. I could be wrong and maybe even a bit silly, but I&#039;m already getting a non-Japanese vibe from Sakura, solely based on the sign outside.&nbsp; :|

I just like having Japanese food made and served by Japanese people sometimes. Anyone who&#039;s ever been to Japan, and to the truly Japanese restaurants in the city, will know what I mean. It is a different experience. I just think it&#039;s funny to have so many Japanese food places open up on Ditmars, and to not have even one of them actually <em>be</em> Japanese. <br /><br />As for Sakura, it&#039;s hard to explain. It strikes me as a place that&#039;s trying to look Japanese to Americans, but not to Japanese people. I could be wrong, but that&#039;s the impression I&#039;m getting.

				Wow, talk about misconstruing what I said. <br /><br />I don&#039;t believe, nor did I say, &quot;All food of foreign origin must be served by people of matching origin.&quot; While you accuse me of being ignorant, I think it&#039;s ignorant to say that there is never a reason to want a restaurant where the food is made by people who grew up with said food. The attitude and atmosphere of the place changes with this as well. Go to another country and eat at an &quot;American&quot; restaurant run by people of that country and tell me you don&#039;t see differences in how they run it from how it would be run here, and even subtle differences in the ingredients used and the things served. Did I say one is inferior to the other? No. It is different. If you can&#039;t see a difference or believe it&#039;s somehow wrong to notice a difference, THAT is ignorant.

Harlan pretty much hit the nail on the head with what I&#039;m saying: often it seems places just read a how-to guide on Japanese food and restaurants. The food might be good, but it&#039;s generic -- primarily sushi and teriyaki, with a few yakitori items and a couple noodle things thrown in for good measure, and a standard miso soup made with tofu cubes and seaweed -- and the atmosphere plays to what Americans (or maybe foreigners in general?) think Japanese restaurants should look like: plain but elegant, with lots of pretty wood and references to cherry blossoms. <br /><br />Bringing up JJ&#039;s Fusion and Lil Bistro doesn&#039;t really fit in this, though - JJ&#039;s Fusion may serve sushi, but it doesn&#039;t claim to be a &quot;Japanese restaurant&quot; and neither does Lil Bistro. I don&#039;t believe the Japanese have a monopoly on sushi, and I love creativity with food.

				first i am not a big sushi fan so i have to take your word for it because you have been to Japan and you saw what a real Japanese place looks and feel like.<br />Second, I think a big reason for most places not being authentic is because sushi only exploded on the scene in the past 5 years, right now most people do not know the difference between good and bad sushi, once this go through a few cycles and people will learn to understand the difference you will see more authentic sushi places open up. <br />I think Mexican food has gone through the cycle and now you see the new places have a more regional and authentic feel to them.

Most of these guys leave the raw fish out in the open for a long time and use coloring or&nbsp; MSG. <br />fake = bad<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />First, not all sushi contains raw fish. If one is squeamish, simply go the salmon route. It is never supposed to be served raw because it is too unsafe to do so (so it is a major flag if you see raw salmon on a menu in a restaurant), but is instead smoked, grilled, etc. Unagi is usually barbecued as well. Then there are, of course, all of the vegetarian rolls around. <br /><br />As far as coloring, that is true. You have to be careful of places where the tuna is bright red - that usually indicates that it has been dyed, which means that the restaurant can get away with using older fish, which is not as safe, and definitely not as tasty. Also, given the amount of people in the US with allergies to MSG, it&#039;s getting more and more rare to find restaurants that use it in their food.<br /><br />Proper sushi chefs know how to handle fish properly. If one purchases sushi grade seafood, stores it properly, and uses sanitized utensils that don&#039;t commingle with cookware used for other dishes in the restaurant, than there is no reason why the sushi should be unsafe. Granted it takes many, many years to become a properly trained sushi chef, but that&#039;s why you have to pay what you do to get the good sushi.&nbsp; Watch the sushi chefs at the sushi bar - the chefs should only be touching the ingredients, knives, and a towel. Nothing else (unless of course they have a running tap back there to keep the chefs hands moist so the rice does not stick to them). <br /><br />So all in all, yes, fake is bad. However, good sushi is not fake and that&#039;s what one should search for anyway. (Can you tell I&#039;m a sushi fan?&nbsp; :lol:)
