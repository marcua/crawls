				Does anyone else feel, especially the regulars, feel like this day is the slowest in a while for board activity?!&nbsp; Work sort of slowed down so I&#039;ve been spending more time on the board, but there&#039;s really nothing new.&nbsp; I wonder how this day breaks down statistically.&nbsp;

				wait wait wait. Not to get all serious, but doesn&#039;t it depend on the pie and the cake?

				what about pie-cake or cake-pie. I merged them once for a baking contest and it acutally came out pretty good. the sheer caloric volume prevents me from making it again. Mostly because I&#039;ll eat it. &nbsp;:evil:<br /><br />Graham Cracker/Shortbread crust with pudding pie filling. Let that bad boy set in the fridge. <br />Bake an angel food cake in a 9inch round cake pan. Once cooled slice it in half so that it&#039;s still 9inches, just not as thick. Place that on top of your set pudding pie and then add frosting and curled pieces of chocolate. <br /><br />Proceed to devour about 1000 calories.<br /><br />Holy god, I think I want one. <br />

I use a delicious pound cake sliced lengthwise into three equal layers. Top the first layer with macerated raspberries and softened chocolate ice cream; place on the second pound cake layer and top with 3 very thin sheets of melted dark chocolate and slightly softened raspberry sorbet; after placing on the third pound cake layer place the whole thing in the freezer for 1–2 hours; remove and cover the whole cake with fresh,&nbsp; sweetened whipped cream and serve in thin slices immediately. And I am not, nor have I ever have been a tripod.
