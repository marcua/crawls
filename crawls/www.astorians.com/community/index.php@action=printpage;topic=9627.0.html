				Looking for some fun, social people for co-ed, social, charity-focused <b>DODGEBALL</b> league in Astoria and <b>Touch Football</b> in Long Island City. <br /><br />We have a blast every Tuesday night at a school gym reliving those carefree elementary school days by throwing red foam balls at opposing teams! Then, unlike grade school, we got to a nearby bar and drink after! <br /><br />Not into Dodgeball? Want to get outside this spring? On Saturdays or Sundays we play awesome games of co-ed <b>Touch Football in Long Island City</b>. Never played before? No problem - we&#039;ve got a division for that! Ditto for competitive players! Then we party after the games! <br /><br />The best part? It&#039;s all for charity since each team gets to pick a charity to play for. Plus the league has different divisions of play so if you think you&#039;re an expert player you can join the Players Division or if you want to keep it low-key you can join the Extremely Casual Division or any in between! <br /><br />You can join as a full team or as an individual or small group and we place you on a team. It&#039;s a great way to meet new people! <br /><br /><b>All the info is at www.zogsports.org but registration ends next week, so sign up soon!</b><br />
