				Well, It&#039;s time and I blame Obama. &nbsp;:-(<br /><br />Seriously though, he signed into law banning mail order cigarettes. Which means my access to 25 dollar cartons is coming to an end. So my partner and I have a choice (he smokes too). Either spend 20 to 30 dollars a day on smokes or quit. <br /><br />It&#039;s something we have talked about. And quite frankly, I am 43 and probably nearing the end of when I can quit and my body can still heal itself. <br /><br />And it won&#039;t be easy for me. I smoke 1 1/2 to two packs a day. Which is down from my three packs a day back in the army. In fact, my mom once commented that she couldn&#039;t find a single picture of me where I wasn&#039;t smoking. And my friends joked that when I died I would be buried with a few cartons of cigarettes just like vikings of old who was buried with their most valuable possessions. <br /><br /><br />So, I am asking everyone who has gone through this for tips hints etc. I think I am going to set a stop date of August 1st. Fortunately, my partner is with me. So we can suffer together. <br /><br />

				Many people have quit smoking successfully. It&#039;s a combination of good planning and being properly motivated. The first thing you need to do is cut back to a more acceptable amount of cigs a day. Try to knock it down to 20 a day, and then 15 and then 10. It will be easier to stop if your body is used to taking in less nicotine. Some people find the nicotine patch a good method, others don&#039;t. Once you do stop, replace your bad habit with a more acceptable one like chewing gum or hard candies. <br /><br /><br />It is doable if you really want to stop. Good luck and keep as posted on your progress.

				Good luck Kempster!!! (and your partner)&nbsp; My parents still smoke and it worries me to no end.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not a day goes by where I don&#039;t wish they would quit, but not even a health scare managed to get my father to successfully quit.&nbsp; I think he stopped for a few weeks and my mom cut down but as soon as she caught him sneaking one, it was back to full time smoking.&nbsp; I hate it so much, it&#039;s so upsetting.&nbsp; Not only do they hurt themselves, but they hurt their children and their grandchildren.&nbsp; I am not looking forward to their old age, they are only in their 50&#039;s.<br /><br />Please do everything you can do to quit now.&nbsp; &nbsp;I know it will be hard, but it would be the best thing you could ever do for yourself.&nbsp; And those who care about and love you would be forever grateful.

				Here&#039;s what I&#039;ve heard to be an effective method: <br /><br />Smoke when you normally wouldn&#039;t, and DON&#039;T smoke when you normally would, such as while having a drink or coffee.<br /><br />This breaks the psychological associations (&quot;I always smoke while having coffee&quot;) while keeping the body from craving nicotine, since you&#039;re smoking at other times (while in the shower, for example&nbsp; :lol: )<br /><br />Order a carton of sugar-free lollipops in the meantime.&nbsp; :mrgreen: <br /><br />I think NYCMac has tried Rx meds for this, but they can have unpleasant side effects.

				The last time my brother quit (he quits frequently), he used those cigarettes that are supposed to help you step down the nicotine.&nbsp; They didn&#039;t work the way they were supposed to, but they did work - he said they tasted so terrible that he got to a point where he didn&#039;t even want to smoke.<br /><br />So, perhaps aversion therapy? Good luck!

				Thanks everyone.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to make an appointment with my doctor tomorrow and check out the med side of things. <br /><br />I think I&#039;m going to need to do a combination of slowing down first and maybe the patch or a med like Wellbutron. <br /><br />Has anyone heard if hypnosis really works?<br /><br />

				Hypnosis only works on those who are hypnotizable to begin with. Guess a reputable hypnotherapist (I&#039;m sure there are plenty in NYC) would be able to ascertain your degree of hypno....bility(?).<br /><br />Loads of luck, they say it&#039;s the hardest thing to quit, but so worthwhile.

				Good luck Kemp. It&#039;s really tough, but not impossible, and having the want to quit is half the battle! It&#039;s good that you and your partner are quitting together. I quit for a while, but when a smoker friend started spending weekends with us while he was in between homes... well... there went my will power. I&#039;m now what I call friday/saturday smoker, but I know I should just quit again all together, especially after offering advice online! (Perhaps this will motivate me...) So, I personally found, especially in the beginning, that it&#039;s necessary to avoid situations that prompt me to want to smoke. This meant not hanging out with smoker friends, avoiding drinking outside of my home for a bit, and so on. If you find yourself in a situation where you are totally freaking out, just remove yourself from that situation all together. Go for a walk. Eat something healthy. Do something good for yourself. The craving will pass and each day is better. Best of Luck!

				Good luck! Would e-cigarettes be an option? And don&#039;t forget NY Smoker&#039;s Quitline (http://www.nysmokefree.com/)--they offer free starter packs of gum, patches, etc. Maybe that would help you figure out what works best for you. Cold turkey ultimately worked for me, but I didn&#039;t smoke that many.

				I quit a while back. I don&#039;t know what the site is like now, but register on quitnet.com and put your stats in. It keeps track of how many cigarettes you haven&#039;t smoked, how much money you&#039;ve saved, etc. It&#039;s quite motivating. I remember when I quit, really wanting to reach the &quot;you haven&#039;t smoked 100 cigarettes&quot; milestone. I smoked close to a pack a day, so it took about a workweek to get to that.<br /><br />(I just checked my stats for the first time in ages, and I&#039;m gonna hit the &quot;you haven&#039;t smoked 50,000 cigarettes&quot; milestone this summer, which is just FREAKING RIDICULOUS. Fifty thousand!! I don&#039;t know that I&#039;ve done fifty thousand of anything!)<br /><br />As someone who never though she wouldn&#039;t be a smoker, I can&#039;t imagine smoking now. I hate preachy non/ex-smokers, and I refuse to lecture people (DUHHH we all know it&#039;s not a healthy activity), but if you&#039;re ready to quit, you can do it! :) :)

				This is probably one of the best things you can do for yourself. I quit almost 2yrs ago after smoking 10yrs. I quit because I was becoming disgusted with myself physically.<br /><br />I turned to sports and cut down drastically only smoking a few a day. Then finally one day, I said, it would be my last day and it was. You have to be hard on yourself, you shouldn&#039;t say, August, you should say now.<br /><br />I feel better than ever and now get disgusted by the smell of smoke. Here are some tips that might work for you:<br /><br />Get into sports to keep your mind of smoking and doing it with a partner to help each other during week moments<br />Indulge yourself in other ways (cake, candy, sex) to keep yourself sane during a craving (cravings will kick in, but will go away)<br />Drink a lot of water (especially when you get a craving)<br />Don&#039;t give yourself excuses (oh, it&#039;s just ONE smoke, no! that is how you go back)<br />Don&#039;t think about a year, month or week from today. Just make it a day at a time, eventually it gets much easier<br />Stay away or cut back from activities that makes you smoke (drinking is usually one of those)<br />If you messed up one day, move on, consider it a big mistake and go back to being 100% smoke free<br /><br />Any other help I can provide, just ask, I&#039;m glad I quit when I did<br />
