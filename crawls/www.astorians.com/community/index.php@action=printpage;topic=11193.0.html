It was first sung by Iggy Pop and appeared on his debut solo album &quot;the idiot&quot; in 1977 when he and Bowie had their &quot;Berlin years&quot;. It was not popularized until several years later when Bowie decided to put it on his album &quot;Let&#039;s Dance&quot; in 1983 and let Pop collect the half the royalties from it.

				there are not that many concerts worth going to anymore.<br /><br />Anyone remember the Schaefer Music Festival in Central Park at the Wolman Rink where you could see your favorite bands for next to nothing as long as you didn&#039;t mind waiting in line for the whole day?<br /><br />Check out the line-ups:<br />&nbsp;<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schaefer_Music_Festival<br /><br />http://rateyourmusic.com/list/JohnBuckWLD/schaefer_music_festival_performers__wollman_skating_rink___central_park__ny_1968_1976/<br />

				Yea well, when I was growing up on L.I. the guy who came around to us, did so for 15 years or so. Then in the early 80&#039;s we stopped seeing him. I saw him at a custom car show about 12 years later. There he was with his 50&#039;s Chevy custom Good Humor truck, and yes he was selling ice cream out of it!! The one in the pic is not his though.
