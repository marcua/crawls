				This is a letter I am distributing to the neighbors on my block (38th St between 31st Ave and Broadway) after the DOT said it would only repair curbs and driveways it damaged when it resurfaced the road if owners filed Notice of Claim with the City. If you own a property on my block please file, especially if you have a curb cut for a driveway, because the City generally sees that as the homeowner&#039;s responsibility. If you are not on my block, but you are left with dangerous crumbling curbs you might want to follow the same procedure now that I have found out what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;Dear Neighbors:<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As you will have noticed, the curbs the length of our block were damaged by the milling of the road surface on July 7, 2016. I made a complaint about it to the Department of Transportation via 311 that same day, requesting that they repair the curbs which they had damaged. When they responded belatedly on September 20th, they told me they may repair them in the next 2-3 years and referred me to our local community board. I complained to the Community Board that if the curbs are not repaired for three years not only is the danger of residents tripping but with the poor road drainage the sidewalks are likely to be undermined and damaged. Ms. Florence Koulouris of Queens Community Board 1 contacted the Department of Transportation about this and was advised today that anyone whose curb has been damaged has to file a Notice of Claim with the City Comptroller within 90 days of the damage and they will then have the milling contractor make repairs. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The deadline to file notice of claim is OCTOBER 7, 2016 if your curb was damaged and needs repair. Apparently the city agency which damaged the curbs was the NYC DCC milling contractor.&nbsp; If you have a curb cut for a driveway the city will likely expect you to repair it unless you file a claim to make them do so.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The notice of claim form can be downloaded from https://comptroller.nyc.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/property-damage-loss.pdf. A copy is enclosed in the hand-delivered copies of this letter also.&nbsp; Please fill in the form, have it notarized and send it before the deadline expires.&nbsp; Ms. Koulouris would appreciate it if you would let her have a copy of the form also and let her know that you need a repair so that she can make sure that the Department of Transportation takes care of it. Ms. Koulouris can be contacted QN01@cb.nyc.gov or (718) 626-1021. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hopefully if enough of us file complaints, the City will fix the curbs before the winter weather hits. <br />&nbsp;
