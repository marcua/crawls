				I had seen the video on facebook but hadn&#039;t realized it was a local story.<br /><br /><br />http://abc7ny.com/society/must-see-octopossum-runs-through-astoria-yard-with-clinging-joeys/1346535/<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve seen raccoons and possums near the Amtrak embankment on the Astoria-Woodside border. Has anyone else had an unlikely wildlife encounter on the mean streets of Astoria?

				I saw a big raccoon on crescent st. a few years ago and a family of raccoons down by the river by Astoria Park.

				I actually had a possum in my apartment a couple years ago. Had to call in an animal control guy to get it out. Cost me some bucks that I could not really afford to lay out when I was out of work.<br /><br />

				Walked right into the path of a giant raccoon in Boulevard Gardens at 1 am. He didn&#039;t even flinch when he say me. I hear they can be quite nasty.

				A year ago, there was a mamma possum with her babies walking the lattice in our back yard (27th Street).&nbsp; Our three dogs were going crazy!&nbsp; She was an ugly possum for sure.&nbsp; And the theory that &quot;all baby animals are cute&quot; was pushed to the test.

				I read that possums are harmless and eat bugs and they are good for your garden

				I have also seen them in my yard sitting on the shed getting some sun.&nbsp; But the strangest encounter by far was<br />about two years ago, there was a Possum in the engine of my husbands car. It was in the late winter-still cold out.&nbsp; When he would pull his car out of the driveway, he would notice garbage underneath his car - plastic bags, leaves, etc.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t think much of it until he opened the hood one day to put more washer fluid in and saw two eyes staring at him.&nbsp; He thought he was going crazy!&nbsp; There was a small cavity in the engine that the Possum would go to since it was warm.&nbsp; &nbsp;Luckily the Possum didn&#039;t do any damage to the car.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I&#039;ve seen several possums around Astoria over the last couple of years. Most times they run away when they see a human approaching. I&#039;ve also seen several raccoons as well.

				FYI - the Opossum/Possum are harmless and are related to the kangaroo/koala family.&nbsp; They will NOT attack you.&nbsp; If you hear them hissing at you and/or showing their teeth, it&#039;s only because they are FRIGHTENED&nbsp; &nbsp;They are solitary mammals and prefer to be left alone and try their best to avoid confrontation with humans.

				FYI:&nbsp; they are harmless and will not attack.&nbsp; Should you hear them hissing at you and/or showing their teeth, this means they are FRIGHTENED and may even play dead by foaming from the mouth (at times) and even secrete a foul smell.&nbsp; They will lie in a comatose state EVEN IF YOU TRY TO MOVE THEM - remember that!!!&nbsp; They try avoid confrontation with us humans and are active at night.&nbsp; So the video that circulated with the mom carrying her babies on her back may mean that &quot;someone&quot; or something threatened her during the daylight hours.&nbsp; I actually felt sorry for her when i saw that video because she most likely was headed to a new shelter for her family.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 13px;" class="bbc_size">They are non-destructive.
