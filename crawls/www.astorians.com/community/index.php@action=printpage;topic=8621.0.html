				I have a macbook as well as a two year old desktop which runs on windows XP.&nbsp; I wanted to get an external hard drive to start backing up my files for the both of them.&nbsp; Can I get a single external hard drive to take care of both, or do I have to get two seperate ones?<br /><br />Also, any suggestions on relatively simple to use external hard drives?&nbsp; I&#039;ve been fooling around with a Western Digital My Book Home Edition external hard drive, and it is confusing as all hell (and its not working either.&nbsp; Western Digital easily has some of the most horrendous customer service in the business).<br /><br />Thanks!

				Usually, you only need one hard drive that works on both Mac and PC.&nbsp;

				I haven&#039;t used an external HD in OS X, so my mac advice is very YMMV. Having said that, pretty much any external HD should do the trick. For win XP you shouldn&#039;t even have to load drivers. I&#039;m not sure what you mean by easy to use? Are you talking about the software that comes with it? I&#039;ve had a few externals over the years (have 2 ATM) and it really seems to be 6 of 1 half dozen of the other. The only thing I would pay extra for might be a longer warranty or a different connection (say Firewire instead of USB 2).

				I think you can do it but you might want to set up the hard drive with a partition. I think xp uses a NTSC format and OSx uses something else. Are you using it strictly for storage or are you going to be loading applications on it?

				You will need a driver on your Mac to use the drive if it is formatted by Windows.<br /><br />Windows uses NTFS by default, but you could use FAT32 (which I&#039;m pretty sure OS X can read/write) by choice. Problem with FAT32 is you can&#039;t have files over 2gb (like ripped DVDs etc.) OS X uses HFS+, which Windows 2k supported, but XP does not. <br /><br />Format the drive on your XP machine, and install NTFS-3G (http://macntfs-3g.blogspot.com/) on your Mac. Once you have that installed, you can attach the external drive to your Mac and should be to read and write to the drive. Make sure you properly remove the drive (using the &quot;Safely Remove Hardware&quot; option in XP, or drag to trash in OS X) before unplugging from the machine or there may be problems mounting the drive or (worst case) you could lose data.<br /><br />Good luck!

I have had WD&#039;s fail in the past (about 10 years ago), IBM, Quantum, Seagate too. The only real difference I have found is if you use enterprise drives, they seem to be made much better. The Raptors are, and I was running a SCSI system for awhile where over about 6-7 years I had 1 drive failure, and in that&nbsp; case it was questionable whether it was the drive&#039;s fault or not. Unless I am buying something specific (like the Raptors) I generally buy whatever is the cheapest these days...
