				2 new supermarkets - Mi Tierra on 34th Avenue just West of Crescent and Foodtown on Steinway between 34th and 35th Avenues.&nbsp; Anyone check them out yet?

				Went in Mi Tierra briefly, it&#039;s nice. Produce is cheap and looks really fresh. Store is incredibly clean, hope it stays that way. Looks like a good addition to the hood.

				I&#039;ve been to the one on Steinway twice,&nbsp; the first time I got $20 cash back with my purchase and I asked to have the $20 broken up.... The girl said, &quot;ok, how would you like it?&quot;&nbsp; I said a ten, a five and singles.&nbsp; She then handed me a ten, five said &quot;wait, how many singles?&quot;&nbsp; <br />The next trip, different cashier was ringing me up when she came across two produce items I guess she had never seen before and asked me if I knew what they were so she would be able to ring them up.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Overall the store seems alright, but they may be in the market for new cashiers in the future.&nbsp;

				A Food Bazaar is opening up in the old Pathmark location on Northern Blvd by 44th street. They have an COMING SOON sign up, but no date was given.

				Berry Fresh is nice, except for the meat department.<br /><br /><br />I just dipped into Best Market quickly yesterday and they have an amazing beer selection where you can build you own six-pack.

				Another one of the many reasons a Trader Joe&#039;s should open in Astoria is because of their returns policy. I had purchased some kind of gummy penguins because they were out of my favorite gummy bunnies and didn&#039;t like them too much. I mentioned this to the cashier and he told me if I don&#039;t like any item I can return it for a refund or exchange. I was surprised. I checked their website and yes, it&#039;s true. 99.9% of their products are awesome, but it&#039;s nice to know. Is there any other supermarket around that has this policy?

				That would be great&nbsp; :grin:&nbsp; even though I get lost in there and then feel like a rat stuck in a maze with no escape. They should build one around the 20th Ave area-lots of open space, easier driving and parking than around Northern Blvd. <br /><br /><br />I STILL want a Trader Joe&#039;s in Astoria! :cry:
