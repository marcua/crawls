				So I made Indian food for myself last night. Some puff pastry potato samosas (baked puff pastry is an excellent substitute for the usual deep-fried wrappers!), and some cabbage and carrots with various spices. Quite tasty. I make a fair amount of Indian food, probably every couple weeks or so. <br /><br />A bit after I finish eating, and settle myself down in front of the DVD player, my landlady downstairs calls. This is usually a bad sign, as she only calls when she&#39;s angry, but the cat&#39;s not running around on the kitchen floor, so it&#39;s hard to say what&#39;s up.<br /><br />Here&#39;s what she had to say (paraphrased): &quot;Harlan, what are you cooking? Are you making Indian food? I can&#39;t have you cooking Indian food! The spices get into the house and they don&#39;t get out. I won&#39;t rent to Indian people, and I can&#39;t have you cooking Indian food. You must open the windows and get rid of the smell! And this summer, don&#39;t run the air conditioners [they&#39;re hers -H] when you&#39;re cooking Indian food, because the smell gets into them and you can&#39;t get it out! You can&#39;t cook Indian food!&quot; <br /><br />Argh. I&#39;m tempted to cook Indian every day for the next week. She has no right, legal or otherwise, to keep me from cooking what I would like. And saying she won&#39;t rent based on ethnicity? Not a classy move on her part...<br />

				Harlan,&nbsp; That sucks.&nbsp; The problem is simple.&nbsp; You live in the same building as your landlord (a crabby , &quot;this is her home&quot; landlord.)&nbsp; MOVE and soon.<br /><br />At my first apartment in Astoria, the landlady was born in it (my apartment no less).&nbsp; She would actually call to say things like:<br /><br />Land lady &quot;I had to let the exterminator in. you should clean your room and make the bed. &quot;<br />Jonathan &quot; why didnt you let me know about the exterminator, i should be there&quot;<br />Land lady &quot;because its my building and I can go where ever i want, I was born in your room you know&quot;<br /><br />Landlady &quot; You have to lower the music, you are keeping my daughter in law awake ( her sons family lived below us) <br />Jonathan: &quot; its 11am on a saturday and its the news on tv:&quot;<br />Landlady &quot; they had a late night and I need you to lower the music&quot;<br />Jonathan &quot; when will you tell your son not to practice electric guitar at night?&quot;<br />Landlady &quot; Jonathan, this is my building, my family has lived here since the 20&#39;s, you ared just a tenant.&quot;<br /><br />Harlan, get out and save your sanity.&nbsp; family owned buildings just dont understand tenant rights.<br /><br />

				Holy crap Harlan. Holy crap. What effing nonsense. Especially when you have a hankering for some samosas. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=2174.msg14500.html#msg14500">Quote from: Harlan on May 21, 2006, 08:35:40 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Well, she&#39;s Greek, her first husband was Italian, and she&#39;s now with an Arab guy (who I wish was the landlord! Nice guy.)</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Which makes it even WORSE on her part! Arab? Come on landlady person - don&#39;t you know Middle Eastern food can get into the draperies and sheetrock?<br /><br />Our last apartment was pretty annoying too. Our landlady was pretty nice, and she and her husband lived in Florida for most of the year, so we didn&#39;t have to contend with them very much. But the lady who lived in the apartment below us was a real piece of work. I remember one occasion after we had a good snow...<br /><br />Matt and a visiting friend went out to shovel the sidewalk, then decided they wanted to go grab something to eat really quick from Trade Fair or something, so they just left the shovel (which was owned by our landlady) out in front of the apartment.<br /><br />Meanwhile I get a knock on our door and our conversation went something like this...<br /><br />Easily irritated neighbor lady: You shouldn&#39;t leave the shovel outside.<br />Me: I didn&#39;t leave the shovel outside - Matt and our friend were shoveling.<br />Easily irritated neighbor lady: Well, if you leave it out there someone will steal it. You should go get it.<br />Now irritated me: They are going to be back soon. It should be fine.<br />Easily irritated neighbor lady: You should go get it and bring it back inside. I am not paying for a new shovel.<br /><br />So I finally went out and got the damn shovel to get her off my back. But HELLO, if the stupid shovel gets stolen, we can easily go and buy another one. It isn&#39;t like this was a gold-plated shovel. $20 ma&#39;am. $20.<br /><br />Now we live in a one-apartment building. Thank God.<br /><br />Yes. I agree with Jonathan - keep your sanity, find a better apartment. Or make a complaint to the city. I am not sure if you can make an official complaint over not being able to make ethnic food when you want, but you could as sure as hell try.

				I think I&#39;m just going to ignore her. I&#39;ve made Indian food probably 50 times since I&#39;ve been in the apartment, and this is the first complaint. I&#39;m on a month-to-month lease, so if she wants to evict me for it, she can try. Make my day.<br /><br />But I don&#39;t want to move! It&#39;s a great apartment in a great location. And I hate moving.<br /><br />Besides, I think she only calls me to complain about things when something else in her life is making her angry. By and large, she&#39;s an OK landlady for one who lives downstairs. I&#39;d rather have her as a neighbor than someone playing loud rock music in the middle of the night...

				If you&#39;re month-to-month, then unfortunately she can terminate your tenancy with 30 days&#39; notice (30 days from the beginning of the rent period; in other words, if your rent is due on the 1st of the month, if she tells you on May 25 that she wants you out, you have until June 30).<br /><br />You have a right to cook any food you want in your apartment, but if you really love the apartment and want to stay, you&#39;re probably better off making nice.

				Not to play devil&#39;s advocate, but I can kind of see where she&#39;s coming from. It&#39;s probably not racist so much as she has noticed that Indian food is particularly pungent and the smell lingers, though she is being a bit ridiculous by going off on you so much about it. <br /><br />As a sort of compromise, keeping in mind that Indian food has a very strong smell, is it possible to just burn a candle when you cook it and keeping windows open? (obviously the latter is not an option for the winter, but I&#39;m just wondering.) I mean I would do the same if I were cooking something with a lot of garlic so as to not bug the roommates with the strong smell.

				I don&#39;t know. In the last place I lived I had a racist landlady too. I think that some of the old time &quot;Astorians&quot; that live here don&#39;t want anyone but certian races/classes living here. I think they&#39;re afraid of how diverse it&#39;s becoming.<br /><br />A while back I had an African American friend visiting and they stayed at my apartment for a couple days. My landlady came up and talked to me saying, &quot;so [they] are not going to be your roomate right?&quot; And I was like &quot;no, the person is just a friend who is visiting,&quot; and she said, &quot;that&#39;s good, because I&#39;ve had some neighbors come and talk to me about not wanting any blacks on this block.&quot;<br /><br />?!?!?!?!?!?!?! <br /><br />I said &quot;WHAT?!&quot; She said, &quot;well, I don&#39;t have any problem with them, but just some of the neighbors do and I don&#39;t want to cause any trouble.&quot;<br /><br />I&#39;m glad I don&#39;t live there anymore.

Based on my personal experience there are indeed <strong>some</strong> old time Astorians who are vocal about not wanting certian races or colors in their neighborhood. It&#39;s clear to me that there are many long resident Astorians who love the diversity (as I do - and one of the main reasons I moved here), and you&#39;re clearly one of them. I just meant to convey to Harlan that I&#39;ve experienced this attitude before in Astoria on more than one occasion and that I&#39;ve had conversations with a few property owners here that have said similar things. I even had a broker tell me that a friend of mine might have a harder time finding a place to rent here because of her race. This broker is a long-time Astoria resident and grew up here.<br /><br />Maybe it&#39;s just the block I lived on, but evidently the neighbors of my landlord on that street are okay with diversity, as long as it means a certian color. But like I said - it&#39;s happened more than once while living here 5 years. And in some cases, I&#39;ve discovered that my old broker was right - sadly it is harder for some people to rent here because of their race.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: TRX</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">... but I tolerate property owners rights to be bigots ...</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>It&#39;s illegal (http://www.dhr.state.ny.us/fairhousing.html) for landlords to discriminate based on race (among other things).

I recently nearly got into an argument with a libertarian who is totally opposed to zoning, another property-rights issue. I said, &quot;hypothetically, what if Wal-Mart wanted to buy out all those cute landmark-statused row houses in the charming West Village, knock them down, and put in a Supercenter with 15 acres of parking. Would you have a problem with that?&quot; He said &quot;no, if they buy the land, they can do whatever they want with it.&quot; I nearly slugged him. :)<br /><br />Incidentally, fair housing laws don&#39;t apply to anyone with whom you share living space (say, a bathroom and kitchen). So it&#39;s totally legal to refuse to rent your spare room to someone for any reason whatsoever, including race.<br />

				Yes, what the lawyer said. :) My apartment was advertised, as I got it through a broker. It would thus be illegal for her to refuse to rent to an Indian person based on race (although landlords often claim inadequate income or credit). <br /><br />I don&#39;t have a problem with racists not being forced to rent rooms to people they hate in a single dwelling, incidentally. Free association, and the right not to associate with people you don&#39;t want to associate with, is an important principle...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=2174.msg14781.html#msg14781">Quote from: lanseaux on May 23, 2006, 12:34:28 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I agree that it&#39;s absolutely unethical, but state (http://www.dhr.state.ny.us/fairhousing.html#WHAT%20HOUSING%20IS%20COVERED) and local (http://www.nyc.gov/html/cchr/html/housing.html) Human Rights Laws do not necessarily cover two unit owner-occupied dwellings.&nbsp; In other words, &quot;The Law does not extend to residents of two-family houses if the owner or a member of the owner’s family resides in one of the housing accommodations and the available housing accommodation was not advertised.* In addition, you are not covered by the Law if you rent a room or rooms in non-government assisted housing where the owner resides.&quot;<br /><br />*The non-advertised restriction to the exception is not covered by the NY State Division of Human Rights, only the NYC Commission on Human Rights (where I worked in 1995 and 1996).<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Everything I&#39;ve heard, including from a real estate broker, is that the traditional ethnic groups of this neighborhood are rather prejudiced against African Americans specifically, even as they&#39;re at least somewhat tolerant of Hispanics, Middle Eastern people, and South Asians (except perhaps when they cook). <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: jonathan</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I choose to think its simple as for some reason Indians, Pakistanis, Brazilians, Greeks, Italians, Koreans (for example) have chosen this part of Queens to emigrate to and Africans chose Jamaica, parts of Brooklyn and other places. <br /><br />...<br /><br />So go out and hug an African American or a Pakistani or a Serb (maybe not a Serb, some of those guys scare the heck out of me) <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Jonathan, I suspect that your point about self-selection is part of it, yes. People tend to want to move somewhere that&#39;s comfortable, and if you can move somewhere where people won&#39;t yell racial insults at you all day, but that is just as nice in other ways, you probably will. (If you make a lot more money than any of us do, you&#39;ll probably move to the Upper East Side, regardless of race!) <br /><br />And your joke about the Serbs made me laugh! One of my co-workers is Serbian. Brilliant guy, but he does look like a thug. Heavy-set, buzz cut hair, goatee, and in the winter he sometimes wore a long black leather coat. He looked like a bodyguard for Ratko Mladic (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratko_Mladic)... You&#39;d never guess he&#39;s a science nerd like me...<br /><br />
