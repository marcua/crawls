				I&#039;d like to take a weekend trip to Boston. I know next to nothing about what the city has to offer. I like historic sites, neat restaurants, and walking around. I have a limited budget, so cheaper activites are good. I know some of you guys have lived in Boston: do you have any recommendations?

				I love Boston, lived in Boston, visit Boston, etc.<br /><br />The MFA there has the largest exhibition of Ed Hopper&#039;s stuff ever put together. I will def be going to that.<br /><br />My two favorite bars in Boston:<br /><br />http://boston.citysearch.com/profile/4742908/allston_ma/sunset_grill_tap.html<br /><br />http://boston.citysearch.com/profile/4728127/boston_ma/bukowski_s_tavern.html<br /><br />Bukowski&#039;s does awesome burgers and dogs and at great prices after midnight. The Sunset&#039;s food is mediocre to okay, but if you want some good eats on Newberry St there&#039;s always the Trident, the restaurant I worked at in college:<br /><br />http://boston.citysearch.com/profile/40860182/boston_ma/trident_booksellers_cafe.html<br /><br /><br /><br />Sunday nights this place has the awesomest show--<br />For $5, it&#039;s a poetry night with a jazz band that improvs with the poets. If you&#039;re brave enough, you can perform there too. Good band, good people, good beer.<br /><br />http://boston.citysearch.com/profile/4745814/cambridge_ma/lizard_lounge.html<br /><br /><br />These two restaurants are a bit off the beaten path (think going to Arthur Ave. for a deli-30min on the train to goooooood eats) but worth it.<br /><br />Red Bones BBQ: (lunch or dinner)<br />http://boston.citysearch.com/profile/4751824/somerville_ma/redbones_barbecue.html<br /><br />Renee&#039;s (best. breakfast. eva.)<br />http://boston.citysearch.com/profile/4751809/somerville_ma/renee_s_cafe.html<br /><br />Those are both in Davis Sq in Somerville. That area is really cool and has a great vibe. Davis Sq also has a JP Licks and it is a sin to go to Boston and not have JP Licks ice cream. They are, by far, the best ice cream I&#039;ve ever had. (Coldstone is gross compared to this stuff). There are several locations around the city.&nbsp; This is the one right downtown, near the Trident. There&#039;s also one in Davis by Redbone&#039;s.<br /><br />http://boston.citysearch.com/profile/4728088/boston_ma/j_p_licks.html<br /><br /><br />One of the best things to do in Boston is go wander around the North End. There are only three things that I would say Boston does unequivocally better than NYC: 1) Beer, 2) Baseball &amp; 3) The Italian &#039;hood.&nbsp; The North End wallops Little Italy in every sense imaginable. Go there. Walk around. Get a canoli at Mike&#039;s and espresso at Gio&#039;s. There are some great cigar shops, old men love to lounge about outside and they speak Italian when they do. Hanover Street is *the* street to be on in Boston. Here&#039;s a map of the North End.<br /><br />http://www.northendboston.com/art/Parking.gif<br /><br />How long are you going to be in Boston? I have lots of day by day recomendations--lemme know. Day of the week is key. Boston is all about the weekly events.<br /><br />Any other questions, send &#039;em my way! <br /><br />PS--will you have a car? If so, there are some of the best. beaches. ever. just south of the city. I&#039;ll send directions if you will.

				Just and FYI.&nbsp; If you choose to look at some of the historic areas to Boston, the ship where the Boston Tea Party was held, is no longer there. My brother recently went to Boston and he told me it burned down about a year a two ago.&nbsp; I never knew this as I never saw it in the news.&nbsp; It is a sad moment in US History as that was a major point in our history. I think they are rebuilding it so at least we will have some sort of monument eventually.

				I spent a weekend in Boston once, it was a lot of fun.&nbsp; If you like walking around, historic sites and not spending a lot of money, let me recommend the Freedom Trail to you.&nbsp; Its a red line painted or sometimes a red brick line along the the sidewalk that runs continuously through the sity to all sorts of historic sites.&nbsp; I did it with a friend when I went, took us most of the day, she wasn&#039;t into going into all the individual locations so much.&nbsp; But we did see the Old North Church, famous for the one if by land etc etc, Faneuil Hall, the Bunker Hill Memorial, site of the Boston Massacre, the USS Constitution aka Old Ironsides and a bunch of other sites.&nbsp; Takes you through a lot of Boston&#039;s neighborhoods too.&nbsp; You can look up the Freedom Train here (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Trail).<br /><br />Have fun and avoid driving in the city if you can, its a mess.

				This is tough.&nbsp; It&#039;s like if someone says, &quot;what is there to do in NYC?&quot;&nbsp; Good suggestions up there, though.&nbsp; Walking by the Charles River along the Esplanade is cool.&nbsp; There are free concerts at the Hatch Shell.&nbsp; Schedule is here: http://www.celebrateboston.com/events/hatchshell/hatchshellconcerts.htm (http://www.celebrateboston.com/events/hatchshell/hatchshellconcerts.htm)<br /><br />There are a bunch of bars and stuff over by Fenway on Landsdown Street if you&#039;re looking to go out and have some drinks.&nbsp; The Science Museum is cool and the Swan Boats in the park are a big tourist thing.&nbsp; Interesting to see even if you don&#039;t want to sit on the boat.<br /><br />Ok... I think I&#039;m done... for now.

				The Hatch Shell is pretty cool. There are a couple of big events there. I actually used to live in a building where I could see the Hatch out of my window!<br /><br />Also, this summer the MFA is having one of the largest collection of Ed Hopper&#039;s work ever put together. I don&#039;t know if you like his stuff, but I&#039;m excited to get up there and see it.<br /><br />http://www.google.com/maps?q=Nantasket+Beach,+Hull,+MA,+USA&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;om=1&amp;ll=42.29204,-70.867653&amp;spn=0.116569,0.156898&amp;z=12&amp;iwloc=addr<br /><br />best. beach. eva.

				Well there&#039;s Legal Seafood, which is regularly priced for a chain seafood restaurant... but you&#039;ve probably heard of it before right?&nbsp; Everyone in Boston seems to love this place (I&#039;m not big into seafood so I had the chicken&nbsp; :lol:).&nbsp; It&#039;s in the Prudential Center.

				Legal Seafood has different branches, some of which are better than others, in my opinion.&nbsp; I&#039;ve found the one near MIT to be the best.<br /><br />There&#039;s also a seafood restaurant near Faneuil Hall whose name I can&#039;t recall, but they are supposed to be the oldest continuously-run restaurant in the U.S.

				We went to a place called the &quot;Barking Crab&quot; on Sleeper Street. I liked it pretty well.<br /><br />Boston is pretty cool - I only had about five hours to see anything so most of that time was taken up walking the Freedom Trail. I was impressed by how clean the city is. I noticed that (in Charlestown, at least) they only sweep the streets once a <em>month</em>. That furthers my theory that NYC&#039;s street sweeping is pretty much useless.
