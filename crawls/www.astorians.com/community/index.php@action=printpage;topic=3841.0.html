Tag is just a crypto-fascist cloak for the victimization of the IT. The game centers around the victimized group attempting to place the stigma upon another and join in the safety of the collective norm. Ultimately the impure weak will be left unable to shed their inherent inferiority. However, in our society, all are equal and there is no room for this kind of subliminal manipulation of our children. I salute it. No more tag. Or wire hangers -- ever! (Yay, Joan Crawford).

They are going to rot from boredom before the 4th grade. I can&#39;t believe the parents are allowing it. Why don&#39;t they just make the parents sign a release form and let the kids get on with being kids.

				Well, if you can&#39;t find a turkey for thanksgiving, maybe you could find a plump 3rd grader that has been fattening up from sitting in front of the tv or computer or video games.&nbsp; Probably as tender as veal.&nbsp; I figure, exercise is clearly not important anymore in our society.&nbsp; It&#39;s more important to not get sued than to be healthy and physically active.

				what the hell are they supposed to do during recess then?<br />i thought my old grammar school was strict, but we could still play dodgeball, kickball (got hit square in the face and split my glasses in half...had to wear tape in the center until my mom could get me new ones-and its not like we sued the school to replace my glasses)tag you name it. we were even allowed to go off and play our own made up games, just as long as someone knew where we were and not fighting.<br />when i went back as a volunteer if they didn&#39;t play the organized game (from the meanest teacher to walk the planet...and i never even had him, he had no business working with small children, high school maybe but not little kids. i think he got off on making them cry) they couldn&#39;t play at all. <br />now schools are taking away the organized sports? because they&#39;re afraid someone will get hurt? that&#39;s insane. s___ happens. parents and schools need to get over it and learn that accidents happen. accidents aren&#39;t worthy of a lawsuit, and your kid will be super cool sporting that cast.

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> from the article:<br />&quot;I think that it&#39;s unfortunate that kids&#39; lives are micromanaged and there are social skills they&#39;ll never develop on their own,&quot; said Debbie Laferriere, who has two children at Willett, about 40 miles south of Boston. &quot;Playing tag is just part of being a kid.&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What she said. I&#39;m only 8 years or so older than my peers at school (I&#39;m almost 28, they&#39;re 20-21-ish), and even I see a huge discrepancy between me and them when it comes to certain things that could be derived from overprotecting kids and treating them like precious, breakable eggshells. Like, when I was a kid, we had concrete and steel playgrounds...they had plastic and foam. They&#39;re so used to being protected, and when something bad happens to them, they&#39;re always looking for someone else to blame. No one takes responsibility for themselves. I actually heard someone say in the B&amp; darkroom once, &quot;ugh...when I slip in that water,&quot; [that SHE spilled!], &quot;I&#39;m gonna sue school for not cleaning it up.&quot; God forbid they should take responsibility. I ended up getting paper towels and handing them to her. She looked at me like I was nuts and I said, &quot;Oh, I grabbed them for you so you could clean up that water you spilled.&quot;<br /><br />Of course I know that not everyone is like this, and that girl I mentioned is an extreme case...but if you don&#39;t allow kids to hurt themselves or make mistakes, how are they ever going to survive on their own? I have a big dent on my chin from kickball when I was 8 (my shoes were untied and I tripped on a pretty big crack in the pavement, landed straight on my chin...I&#39;m lucky I didn&#39;t break my jaw when I tripped)...my mom probably could have gotten away with suing, but instead she said, &quot;see? That&#39;s what happens when you run with untied shoes.&quot;
