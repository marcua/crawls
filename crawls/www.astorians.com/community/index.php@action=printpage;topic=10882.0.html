				Ok, so I have to admit it. I&#039;m totally addicted to this show. I mean it isn&#039;t normal for a straight 42 yr old male to like design shows where people design totally fabulous rooms just so that they can beat out their competitors and get their own show on television. Anyone else out there?

				I just started watching it this season.&nbsp; It seems like a lot of fun, though that woman who threw her team under the bus looks likely to be the cause of much drama.&nbsp; I like the cop/designer - I&#039;m still hoping he&#039;s gay and single (and moving to Astoria? - a guy can hope!)

				I think I&#039;ve pretty much come to terms with sounding gayer than I&#039;d expected, not that it&#039;s a bad thing, but one eventually has to say, &quot;this is me&quot; and run with it.&nbsp; Wanting bigger arms is always a plus in my book - for all folks.

				Don&#039;t feel bad, I have my b/f addicted to HGTV but the truth is there are some really good shows.&nbsp; How they take a space and make something that looks like a setting from one of the SAW movies and make it look so fab.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken a lot of their ideas on different things and incorporated them in my own apartment, especially the space saving tips.<br /><br />

				Just saw this subject and wondered if any one heard there is a rumor that the guy you are mentioning (the hot cop!) had been in a porn film and was placed on administrative leave from him position as a cop in Florida...don&#039;t know if it is true or not (Perez Hilton was the source I think...) but thought I would mention it since he had been discussed on the board.

				I couldn&#039;t get through the day without HGTV, it&#039;s my tranquilizer.&nbsp; All those shows with happy endings - people end up with the home of their dreams, a beautiful landscape, fabulous furniture, their home improvements pay off big dividends!&nbsp; <br /><br />And then there&#039;s a few &quot;what were they thinking&quot; episodes.&nbsp;
