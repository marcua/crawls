				Have you noticed that there&#39;s a window-frame store on Broadway that always has some kind of superpatriotic display or signage?&nbsp; It&#39;s latest sign says that if you display a foreign flag, or if you don&#39;t love President Bush, you&#39;re not welcome there.<br /><br />I can&#39;t imagine anyone who at this time can merely take or leave President Bush, but if you&#39;re one of those people you&#39;re not welcome--you gotta LOVE him?&nbsp; As for displaying foreign flags, a number of Astorians do that out of ethnic pride (esp. the Greek flag).&nbsp; More importantly, can any small business in Astoria afford to forfeit the business of such a sizable part of the population?

				Yes - I&#39;ve seen it a number of times.&nbsp; It&#39;s actually been toned down, it was quite racially charged for a while.&nbsp; The owner seems to really not like anyone but his (or her) brand of Republicans.&nbsp; All the &quot;Love it or leave it&quot; signs and anti-immigrant materials seem out of place in Astoria.&nbsp; I&#39;m surprised no one has damaged their property or protested it.&nbsp; I just glare at it as I walk past.

				That store totally amazes me. I always wonder how they can stay in business alienating so many people like that - I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen some random store display their GWB-love like that. If for some reason I was suddenly desperate for window frames, you couldn&#39;t pay me to shop in there.

				Speaking of the store in question, if you look closely you will see some military photos and family photos,&nbsp; all white american. SO that should anwser your question of the owners ethnicity.&nbsp; I bet its one of those cases where they own the building too, been here forever and dont worry about cash flow. They do and say what they like.&nbsp; Free speech yes, Over the top, certainly.<br /><br />The most patriotic person in Astoria is a mentally challenged man who on mice days waves an American flag walking up and down broadway around 41st street.&nbsp; Just walks and waves his flag.&nbsp; I always wave back or honk the horn.&nbsp; I think it just makes him happy.<br /><br />

				The Dole/Kemp sign has been there for so long - I think it&#39;s still a Republican club that has the space in that building, but they aren&#39;t very active.&nbsp; The local Republicans had hopes of picking up the local Assembly seat when former Assemblymember Butler was facing primaries from Kimon Thermos every two years, but since Assemblymember Gianaris won the seat, they haven&#39;t really been fielding candidates, not really for anything.&nbsp; I do wonder why they don&#39;t at least update the sign - they could have had Bush/Cheney up, though I don&#39;t think that would be very popular in Astoria (maybe that&#39;s the reason?)<br /><br />I don&#39;t know the background of the window/frames shop owner, but there are a lot of white faces in his window.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure that means anything though, he could be a person of color who just likes to have white faces in his window.&nbsp; I&#39;ve found the displays so tasteless over the years that I&#39;ve never gone in the store.&nbsp; I don&#39;t mind his pro-military stance (in fact, that I agree with) and his support for Bush is his own business, though I disagree with him (or her) there.&nbsp; What I find offensive is his general nastiness to immigrants and the jingoism, all the &quot;Love it or leave it&quot; sloganeering really turns me off and some of the stuff he&#39;s had in the window was worse.&nbsp; Considering how many immigrants live in Astoria and how hard they work to acclimatize and be productive, I just think he&#39;s being rather callous and mean-spirited.&nbsp; He certainly has the right to say it, but I think the rest of us have the right to be offended and to refuse to patronize his store.

				My building is predominately immigrants and the kids all speak English and all seem to want the same toys that any other American kid would want.&nbsp; The people next door to me are Brazilian and work long hours - they&#39;re very dedicated people, friendly too.&nbsp; You&#39;ll always see some people who want to cause problems, but that&#39;s true of any group, people born and bred in the States as well.&nbsp; I&#39;ve always found that most immigrants move to the US in order to find more opportunities and have greater freedom.&nbsp; Personally, I&#39;ve always been a big fan of immigration - it draws many of the best and the brightest to the US where they contribute to the American dream.

				Of course he has a right to state his opinions--anyone has a right to be stupid in public. &nbsp;And while I don&#39;t think it&#39;s good business sense to alienate so many people, business owners have the right to run their business stupidly.<br /><br />I&#39;m thinking of singing antiwar songs as I walk by, even if they&#39;re left over from the Vietnam War.<br /><br />As for &quot;love it or leave it&quot; in its usual context, that doesn&#39;t even make sense. &nbsp;If parents don&#39;t approve of everything their children do, does that mean they don&#39;t love their children? &nbsp;Oops, I can think of some parents who&#39;d say yes. &nbsp;You know the type, the ones who let their kids run wild.<br /><br />Labor Day revision:&nbsp; In this age of givebacks, that&#39;s another thing that makes no sense, to say that unions are running the country.

The nature of online communication is that often people&#39;s arguments are taken to extremes and so it&#39;s hard to have an intelligent conversation because most of us (myself included) tend to focus on polarity rather than the gray in between. It&#39;s easier to assume someone is arguing from a position of linear extremity and then pitch one&#39;s self as an intelligent &quot;moderate&quot;, then the other person does it back to you.<br /><br />Really, most of us I think are more alike than not, and most of us are not extreme in our ideas. It&#39;s just that the lack of nonverbals that I think makes dialog difficult on some issues sometimes. I think we&#39;d all say that we fall in the middle somewhere on most issues.<br /><br />My point is just that I don&#39;t think your ideas are too radical or uninformed for the board, but maybe that there are nonverbals at play here that accentuate differences in unrealistic ways.

But I decided to respond based on what I&#39;ve learned as a social worker both in the classroom and also out in the field...<br /><br />The truly disabled are not just people on wheelchairs and they are not just people injured while on the job. Take people that randomly suffer a car accident for example (I choose them both because their numbers are on the rise and because they are not what you think of commonly when you think dissability): <br /><br />what if they suffered a head injury that has left them with a neurologic defect that is virtually undetectable to the human eye (for example, as is common among car accident victims, reduced motor ability leading to no longer being able to quickly add numbers, or no longer being able move one&#39;s hands or feet at a &quot;normal&quot; pace without a huge amount of effort).<br /><br />Those people don&#39;t get very much in the way of disability insurance, public or private, if they weren&#39;t well off to begin with. In fact, they have to go through (excuse my language) hell and then some to get public dissability assistance, which in most states also adds up to very little (since in 1980 one of the first things Ronald Reagan did was severely cut funding for disability). <br /><br />Unions are for the most part the only way many people are guaranteed a decent form of protection (since most people can&#39;t afford or don&#39;t think of even purchasing disability insurance) so that they won&#39;t have to go on public assistance (which in this day and age is only temporary) <br /><br />as an asside, in NY State, one has access to only if one&#39;s income is less than $600 a month. anyone that has worked with DSS (department of social services) in NYC knows that it&#39;s not a fun picnic trying to get PA in any case.<br /><br />so sorry for the mini social welfare lecture but my point was that every topic is more complex than one line opinions, whether that&#39;s Unions (and yes the Teamsters are an example of a corrupt union, but the California Healthcare Worker&#39;s Union is an example of a wonderful supportive group that helps people out) or corporate American (which more and more is offering workers less and less benefits due to the rising cost of such benefits, in particular health insurance).

				since it&#39;s nearly impossible to get dissability through &quot;the system&quot; (or at least the public one) because you have to have medical records to back up your claims and the rules have been super stringent since 1980 (following the aformentioned reforms from the Reagan era),<br />I can only assume that they are collecting dissabilty through their union (which might also explain why you think unions are corrupt. it&#39;s something I wouldn&#39;t put past a teamster, for example, faking dissability that is)

				I&#39;ve heard of, and seen documentation, that some people have been able to game the system to get disability when it wasn&#39;t needed, but it&#39;s important to make sure the system exists for those who do need it, though catching people who are abusing the system is important too.&nbsp; The system is there as a safety net for people and their families.&nbsp; Every system gets abused by dishonest people, but it&#39;s the dishonest people one should be upset with, not the system or the unions or agencies that run the systems.&nbsp; You just need more people investigating fraud.

				oh, and when I continued reading up on the subject, I discovered a really interesting economics journal article on the topic<br /><br />THE RISE IN THE DISABILITY ROLLS AND THE DECLINE IN UNEMPLOYMENT ,&nbsp; By: Autor, David H., Duggan, Mark G., Quarterly Journal of Economics, 0033-5533, February 1, 2003, Vol. 118, Issue 1<br /><br />&quot;our paper analyzes the impact of the supply of disability benefits on the responses of low-skilled workers to adverse labor market shocks. The rationale for this focus is that nonemployment is a de facto precondition for disability application, making the opportunity cost of seeking DI benefits higher for employed workers than for job losers and nonparticipants. Many potential beneficiaries will therefore seek benefits in the event of job loss but not otherwise. We call these potential beneficiaries &quot;conditional applicants.&quot; As our conceptual model demonstrates, the size of this conditional group is likely to be relatively elastic to program and labor market conditions. By contrast, direct employment to disability transitions will be relatively inelastic. Our framework therefore implies that reduced DI screening stringency, rising replacement rates, and slackening demand for low-skilled workers should have raised the propensity of workers facing an adverse demand shock to exit the labor force to seek disability benefits.&quot;<br /><br />in plain English, in the threat of lay-offs, more people will jump on the bandwagon for disability (in other words, getting on dissability was not as tough as I though it&#39;s supposed to be...)

				&nbsp;PIZZA STONES -&nbsp; &nbsp;A baking stone should be placed on the lowest oven shelf and preheated with the oven. Once pre-heated, the stone evenly transfers intense heat to the food being cooked, ensuring a particularly crisply baked base.<br /><br />As to if it might crack, this I do not know, as I have never had it happen. I always place the cold pizza stone in a cold oven. I then turn on the oven to 400 degrees F. to preheat oven and stone. Once the stone is hot, I do not remove it from the oven. I place the pizza on the hot stone in the oven. Following is my tip that I use when making pizza and using the pizza stone: <br /><br />&nbsp;PIZZA TIP - A common problem is that the topped pizza sticks to the baker&#39;s peel. Giving the peel a quick jerk may work, but it may also jerk your toppings off the pizza as well. A helpful hint is to put a piece of parchment paper on the peel instead of using cornmeal. I place the rolled-out pizza dough on the parchment paper and then add the toppings. The parchment goes into the oven with the pizza. This makes it easier to slide the pizza off the peel and onto the hot baking stone.<br /><br />CLEANING PIZZA STONES - Think of your pizza baking stone as a sponge; it will soak up everything put on it. These &quot;stones&quot; are actually molded sand, tightly compacted under high pressure. Like sand on the beach, they will suck in any liquid exposed to the surface. Anything else in the water -- including soap -- goes right into the stone. Manufacturers warn you to use only clear, plain water to clean a baking stone.<br /><br />First, completely submerge your baking stone in warm, clear, plain water for 15-20 minutes. This should thoroughly saturate the stone with clean water and dilute the soap residue. Next, remove the stone from the water and place it on a pie cooling rack on your kitchen counter. Allow the stone to dry completely overnight.<br /><br />Repeat the same soaking and drying process five or six nights in a row. After the last round, bake some pizza dough on the stone. If the pizza stone still smells, I&#39;m afraid your stone is destined for the trash<br /><br />Does pizza have to be a circle?&nbsp; -<br />You can make them triangular, square,&nbsp; &nbsp;diamond, or anything else you can imagine. Just change the shape of your pan to the shape of a crust that fits your imagination.

				Hi all,<br /><br />I&#39;m noticing a new trend on this board that I&#39;d like to comment about. It&#39;s that whereas we used to be able to have intelligent conversations on the board, lately people have started using personal attacks and name calling to try and get their point across. People are calling each-other trolls and it appears that they actually think that they are &quot;right&quot; enough in their opinions that it makes it okay for them to act immature and name call.<br /><br />I want to be clear on what a troll is: it&#39;s <em>anyone</em> that resorts to name calling and provocation in an attempt to try and make themselves look right. What does that mean? It means, that if you read someone&#39;s post and interpret it as a personal attack on you, that this <em>does not</em> give you a license to mimic what you see as their immaturity. Yet on three separate occasions in the last week we&#39;ve had conversations go from normal, intelligent, adult conversations, to immature high-school level shouting matches.<br /><br />What makes this worse is that the normal even-tempered and intelligent people of this board are chiming in from the sidelines and provoking people to go even further into their rants. We have already lost more than one member in the last week because of this and it is of concern to me.<br /><br />It seems to me that if we are to foster a sense of community, both online and offline we&#39;re going to have to cut people a little slack. That also means that those of us that are the most intelligent, and who most loudly shout the values of tolerance and inclusiveness are going to have to start practicing what we preach a little better. It means that if you perceive that someone is attacking you personally that you are going to just have to try and be the bigger person and let it slide, and respond NOT in kind, but in kindNESS and in the context of reason and intellect.<br /><br />Moderating this board is becoming a burden because as a group we are sliding into intolerance and immaturity. The moderators shouldn&#39;t be having to get &quot;resignation&quot; letters from members, and &quot;reported posts&quot;, and &quot;moderation requests&quot; so often from adults.<br /><br />I&#39;d like to request that we all take it up a notch or two and try and do three things:<br />1. Give each other the benefit of the doubt, don&#39;t assume someone is &quot;attacking&quot; you and you have to defend yourself or lose your reputation - you lose your reputation through your immaturity and by mimicking troll-like behavior, not through your ideas.<br />2. Do not think that just because someone else &quot;started it&quot;, that you somehow have a license to lose your sanity and lay into someone. Responding in-kind to a troll doesn&#39;t fix the problem, it makes two trolls. If you can&#39;t engage someone in intelligent and restrained conversation then don&#39;t.<br />3. Do not egg people on, or otherwise <em>enable</em> people who have lost their mind and started slinging mud. Posting to simply say that you agree with one of the trolls is like standing on the sidelines yelling &quot;fight, fight&quot;. Please don&#39;t do it. If you have something intelligent to contribute please do so however.<br /><br />Overall I&#39;d like to remind people that this site isn&#39;t a &quot;club&quot; or a clique, it&#39;s a community. You may not get to choose your neighbors in a community, but you do get to choose what kind of neighborhood you create. I prefer a tolerant and intelligent one.<br /><br />That being said it&#39;s important also for me to express that I&#39;m going to personally be looking at ways I may have contributed to this atmosphere, and will be trying to address any ways that I can help prevent it in the future.<br /><br />Thanks.

				I&#39;m glad that message was sent, merm. I&#39;m pretty new to this board, and reading some of the ugliness and name-calling in the politics/rants section makes me really uncomfortable, and clearly not why I want to spend time participating on this board.

				Thanks, Merm.&nbsp; I really am uncomfortable with confrontation.&nbsp; And as enigmacat said, changing the subject is a defense mechanism for me.&nbsp; And while I really enjoy some of the heated debates on here, I really dislike when namecalling takes place.&nbsp; While I admit to some borderline tactics with gatorboy/gleason a while back, I generally try to stay clear of those conversations.&nbsp; I have really enjoyed being a part of this online community for the last year, and hope that it continues to be the great community asset and social builder that it has been, at least for me.<br /><br />I can understand when someone might lose their cool when seeing questionable tactics used in discussions, or hijacking of threads, as I have myself.&nbsp; But the thing we have to understand, as has been stated many times, reading words on a page puts a barrier between us.&nbsp; It&#39;s quite easy to attack someone when you aren&#39;t looking them in the face.&nbsp; As merm properly stated, it&#39;s best to give the benefit of the doubt on here, as it&#39;s 100% impossible to fully understand someone&#39;s purpose by only having the words on a page to form a judgement.&nbsp; Sarcasm is undetectable in most cases.&nbsp; Sexual innuendo can often be completely lost, as well.&nbsp; :-o&nbsp; So I think a good practice is to step away for a moment.&nbsp; And think reasonably and logically about the person on the other end.&nbsp; Chances are, they don&#39;t hate you.&nbsp; And in most cases, probably are in general agreement with your oppinion, but semantics get in the way.<br /><br />OK, that&#39;s my $.04.3333.

				Lack of paralanguage (facial expressions, etc.) isn&#39;t enough of an explanation for abusive exchanges.&nbsp; After all, letters have no paralanguage, and even smilies are rare in a letter.&nbsp; The difference, I think, is in the pace of the exchange.&nbsp; The pace of letter writing discourages flame wars.<br /><br />Not that angry letters don&#39;t get sent in the heat of passion (I&#39;ve been guilty of sending at least two), but the time it takes to read a letter, compose a reply, address, seal, stamp and mail it works against simply firing off an obscenity or two.&nbsp; And laying by an angry message until passions have cooled seems a more natural act in letter writing than saving an angry e-mail to the Drafts folder.&nbsp; <br /><br />Moreover, greater brevity is expected in e-mail.&nbsp; What I&#39;ve just written is considered longish for an e-mail post, but it would be considered shortish for snailmail.
