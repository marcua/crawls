				Don&#039;t forget the Run-off election today (Tuesday, September 29).&nbsp; Polls are open from 6 a.m. until 9 p.m. tonight.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m proud to be supporting my dear friend John Liu for NYC Comptroller and Bill DeBlasio who is running for Public Advocate.&nbsp; All four candidates are smart and good people - so get out there and vote (if you&#039;re a registered Democrat, if not, sorry - November will be here soon enough!).<br /><br />

				Voted. I had to yell at a campaign volunteer for one of your preferred candidates, Dirk, who was electioneering too close to the voting site!

				Glad you voted - sorry to hear someone was too close to the site.&nbsp; Delighted with the results tonight.&nbsp; I&#039;m most excited about John Liu - he&#039;s going to be a superstar.&nbsp; &nbsp;Such a wonderful man - truly one of the best people I met in my time in government.&nbsp; I was impressed by DeBlasio&#039;s margin too - shocking how badly he beat Green.

				As you&#039;re a big-D Democrat, Dirk, I wonder what you think about the growth in influence of the Working Families Party recently? I&#039;ve seen articles arguing that the Liu and DeBlasio victories are more about the WFP than the Democratic base...<br />

				While I see how it could be problematic at times, and often WFP and I are backing opposing candidates (they helped end my best friend&#039;s bid for City Council in Brooklyn by strongly backing his opponent), I think WFP pushing Democratic campaigns overall is a good thing.&nbsp; It tends to push the Democratic Party in a more progressive direction and I like that, usually.&nbsp; Knowing too many of these candidates personally, sometimes the candidate who is the most progressive, or who looks good on paper, is just not a good person and then I usually find an alternative.&nbsp; WFP sometimes goes in the same direction I do, othertimes they do not - just like the voters.&nbsp; <br /><br />It is, though, weird to have an outside party so involved in another party.&nbsp; The system of fusion slates in NYC really encourages this and helps act as signifiers to a certain extent - if the WFP is with someone they are more likely to be pro-labor, if the Independence Party is with them they are more likely to support transparency in government and be friendly with real estate interests, the Green Party, which for some strange reason does not seem to cross-endorse much, could signify a good approach to the environment.&nbsp;

				Would you care if Fusion were eliminated?<br /><br />The WFP has a few thousand party members in NYC. <br />It is still up to Democrats to choose their candidates.<br />Didnt hurt that the candidates had also supported term limits.<br />TERM Limits. Yeah.<br /><br /><br /><br />It strikes me that Liu and Yassky had about the same relative turnout and that Liu had support in all 5 boroughs.<br />More on the Runoff later.<br /><br />Would the WFP be a factor in 2010 if there were a Dem primary?<br /><br />I would respect the WFP more if they ran their own candidate for Governor, but I take it they are more practical.<br /><br /><br />

				I really like fusion and wish more parties used it.&nbsp; I&#039;d be more likely to support Green cross-endorsed candidates than a Green candidate running against a Democrat.&nbsp; I like knowing if someone seeks the Right-to-Life or Conservative Party endorsements (and gets them) - makes me avoid them and support other candidates in contested primaries usually.&nbsp; <br /><br />I bet WFP will play a big role in 2010, and a positive one, in my opinion.

				I voted last night on the way home but was kind of sad to see that I was the only person there to vote at 7pm.&nbsp; I was happy with the results of the runoff though!
