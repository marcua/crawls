Steven will share the lessons<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;he learned and the insights he has gleaned, and will pass on, to this<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;meeting&#039;s attendees. Quote Bob Weaver, United States Secret Service .<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Task forces, in general, are not a new concept to law enforcement,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and have been with us for some time. What makes the NYECTF so<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;unique is the diversity of our membership and the personal, trusted<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;relationships that develop between our members. Today, the task<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;force consists of over 250 individual members representing federal,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;state and local law enforcement, the private sector, and academia.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our members include the largest financial services,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;telecommunications, and technology companies in the country. It<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;also includes computer science specialists from 18 different<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;universities. Among these partners, most of whom are strong<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;competitors in the consumer marketplace, there is an unprecedented<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sharing of expertise, information and proven solutions, all of<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;which have been employed in our common mission to prevent the<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;disabling or compromise of critical systems and infrastructure.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Gives an insight to the role of the NYECTF, and our speaker&#039;s<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;background. Steven is also an author, his I.T. forensic book is<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;entitled, &quot;High-Tech Crimes Revealed: Cyberwar Stories from the<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Digital Front,&quot; via Addison Wesley Press. One of our esteemed book<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sponsors.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; Book Description:<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Stories about hacking, stolen credit card numbers, computer viruses,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;and identity theft are all around us, but what do they really mean to<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;us? The goal of this book, quite simply, is to help educate people on<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;the issues with high-tech crimes. &quot;High-Tech Crimes Revealed: Cyberwar<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Stories from the Digital Front&quot; demystifies the risks and realities of<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;high-tech crimes.

Steven Branigan shares the<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;inside details on real cases he worked on in his various roles in<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;law-enforcement, information technology, and security. The result is a<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;comprehensive, accessible look at how digital crimes are discovered,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;what techniques the criminals use and why, and (in some cases) how<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;they can be brought to justice. Inside, you&#039;ll find extensive<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;information on Actual hacker investigations, including the harm caused<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;and how the criminals were tracked and caught, plus the ins and outs<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;of identity theft, a rapidly growing crime with potential for serious<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;damage. Use of criminology and hacker psychology to detect and deter<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;attacks. The risks associated with various technologies Do&#039;s and<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#039;ts for high-tech criminal investigations. This easily<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;understandable book will take you beyond hearing about high-tech<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;crimes to actually understanding how and why they happen--and what can<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;be done to protect yourself.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; For More Information Visit (see http://nylug.org/):<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* &quot;High-Tech Crimes Revealed: Cyberwar Stories from the Digital<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Front&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* NYECTF<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* Steven Branigan Web Site<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; About Steven Branigan:<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Steven Branigan is President and Founder of CyanLine LLC.
