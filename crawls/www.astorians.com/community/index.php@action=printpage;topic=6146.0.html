				Were there any other Astorians.com members lurking at the above-mentioned event?&nbsp; I got there around 8 or so and only stayed for about a half an hour because it was getting a bit too crowded.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve attended a couple of his events and was a volunteer for his primary staff pre-9/11.&nbsp; I find the events interesting because I like seeing the ethnic, racial, and social diversity of our LIC/Astoria/western Queens community.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, I just wanted to find out if anyone else last night and if it party got crazy after I left around 9:00!

				I was supposed to make it, but got tied up at another meeting.&nbsp; How was it?&nbsp; His events are usually amazing.&nbsp; I&#039;m a big Eric Gioia fan.

				I get to most of his fundraisers, the one at Water Taxi beach and the last few in Manhattan.&nbsp; I did send in a check.&nbsp; I am confident Eric will be an outstanding Public Advocate!&nbsp; He&#039;s very community oriented and responsive.<br /><br />I was the dork wearing a suit at the Water Taxi beach fundraiser.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)

				McDirk or anyone out there (TRX), there was a guy at last night&#039;s event who was promoting a Drinking Liberally event in Sunnyside on Sunday.&nbsp; He was wearing a suit with sneakers, I believe, and I think he was Indian.&nbsp; Does anyone know who I am referring to?&nbsp; Is it a fellow astorian.com?&nbsp; Just curious.

				There are a bunch of Drinking Liberally chapters in NYC.&nbsp; The Queens one goes back and forth between Woodside, Sunnyside, Astoria and Bayside, though it&#039;s in Astoria more often than the others.&nbsp; The main one is in Manhattan and meets at Rudy&#039;s.&nbsp; I am one of the hosts of the gay one - Drinking Liberally Steps Out.&nbsp; They&#039;re all fun and you meet great folks - talk politics and drink!

				In general, I don&#039;t like associating my politics with my vices&nbsp; :-D, although I was seriously considering going to the event at Bohemian Beer Garden.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I don&#039;t like to drink on weeknights, having had issues in the past with the whole &quot;overdoing it&quot; and then going to work the next day.&nbsp; <br /><br />McDirk, I think he would be a great public advocate, as well.&nbsp; Does anyone know how Betsy Gottbaum (sp?) is doing?&nbsp; She doesn&#039;t seem as prolific as Mark Green, but then again, will we ever have as prolific PA as Green was?
