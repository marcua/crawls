				HI Rudy,<br />I was here last night mith my husband. We had gone to dinner with a friend who is looking to meet people he can hang with. We ended up going to 718 then went to check out CAOS on Bway once there we decided to go across the street to NUBAR. it was early and the DJ sucked. Sorry but my husband is a DJ and I have filled in at times and can get annoyed when a DJ just throws somthing on without not blending it right on beat.<br /><br />I'm so happy my husband Rob tried the PeachFreeze. Our first time was last week nd he picked up an article on NanoTechnology. Someone came over and dpoke with him about it for a bit and he liked the interaction. I think I got him interested in the whole idea of the community feel to Astoria. Since we out for the evening and didn't want to end our evening we dropped in to check out the vinyl nite. I love the idea and will see what I can do about brining in our DAT tapes of old Cuban music. &nbsp;<br /><br />Anyhow, I overheard you were preparing food for folks here and I would love to prepare my version of Cheviche. I think it's great because it's a great dish for Veggies and very economically friendly for ceviche.<br /><br />Count me in.
