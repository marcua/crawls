				Sexual-Device Sale Ban in Texas Left Intact by Top U.S. Court <br />By Greg Stohr<br /><br />Oct. 2 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Supreme Court refused to question a Texas law that bars the sale of dildos and other ``obscene devices,&#39;&#39; turning away an appeal by a store clerk facing prosecution.<br /><br />The justices made no comment in rejecting the appeal, which argued that the law violated a constitutional right to sexual privacy. The court last year turned down a similar challenge to an Alabama law.<br /><br />Texas is one of a handful of states that ban sexual devices. Courts have upheld laws in Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama and Texas and struck down restrictions in Colorado, Kansas and Louisiana.<br /><br />Texas bans the manufacture, sale, distribution and promotion of ``devices including a dildo or artificial vagina, designed or marked as useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs.&#39;&#39;<br /><br />Ignacio Sergio Acosta, a clerk at Trixx Adult Bookstore in El Paso, was arrested in 2003 for selling a vibrator to two undercover police officers. A state trial judge threw out the case, saying the law was unconstitutional. An appeals court overturned that ruling and said the prosecution could go forward.<br /><br />In his Supreme Court appeal, Acosta pointed to a 2003 Supreme Court decision that said states can&#39;t ban private homosexual conduct.<br /><br />The case is Acosta v. Texas, 05-1574.<br />http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=at3r24qB4.Ug&amp;refer=us

				why does the government have to care what people are doing with their sex lives, as long as those folks don&#39;t force it on to others.<br />maybe this is why some lawmakers are so uptight. they need to get some.

				Wow - this is both disturbing and a bit shocking.&nbsp; I guess living in NYC I take it freedoms that don&#39;t exist elsewhere for granted, but I think this law shows the right-wing and moralists for the control oriented busybodies they are.&nbsp; It&#39;s pretty shameful and the people who pushed this law are probably the type of hypocrites who use sex toys in the privacy of their own home.

				Um, ahem, as a Texan (that is, former resident of the state, potential future one), I&#39;m pretty damn sure I&#39;ve seen dildos for sale down there before. As for why I would know, it may have had something to do with a bachelorette party, and that&#39;s all I&#39;m going to say about THAT.<br /><br />But, again, speaking as a proud Texan, it&#39;s definitely not a place where you can&#39;t find, um, stuff. Hell, there was a triple-x video store directly across from my college campus! Right next door to the Taco Cabana. Awesome.&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				Cathy, would you care to comment please??&nbsp; I need another Texan&#39;s experience here.<br /><br />Where did you go to college Manda?&nbsp; I wonder if this law is old and outdated yet they try to enforce it every once in a while like they do here with the caberet law for dancing in bars.&nbsp; Just take it off the books already, it&#39;s such a stupid law!

				Wow I&#39;m so behind on the boards, maybe I&#39;ve been spending too much time trying to figure out this dadgum contraption called a Rabbit.....HAHAHAHA, just kidding.....it wasn&#39;t that hard to figure out.....ahhhhahaha! <br /><br />What a bunch of f**king morons! It&#39;s so much easier for <del>idiots</del> politicians to deal with BS like this than the real issues. What&#39;s even more sad is that the voters don&#39;t see through the smokescreen.<br /><br />In Amarillo there are plenty of XXX spots though recent legislation requiring so much distance between them and housing/schools/churches has forced most of them to the outskirts of town. One holdout is &quot;The Music Box&quot;, the local &#39;head&#39; shop which has been in business as long as I&#39;ve been old enough to go there&nbsp; :-) They sell everything from incense and rocker-type clothing to every type of smoking accessory (50 kinds of rolling papers!) to top-of-the-line bongs and a myriad of self-pleasuring devices. The blow-up dolls, dildos, lotions etc are all sold in the &quot;Adult Gag Gifts&quot; section, a name that always cracked me up since they sold S&amp;M stuff. I couldn&#39;t look at that sign without imagining someone with a big red ball stuffed in their mouth and strapped to their head with shiny black leather. <br /><br />One of the more popular places was an old farm/grain elevator come adult bookstore/strip club, that besides the hermaphrodite pornos and large rubbery forearm/fists actually wasn&#39;t <em>that</em> sleazy. Nice, very bright decor, the employees weren&#39;t too weird. It&#39;s a pretty funny thing to see, especially at night, driving east on I-40 and just as you are leaving town you start to see three big, glowing red X&#39;s and as you get closer you realize the X&#39;s are atop grain elevators. On the high plains of the Texas Panhandle you can see this place for quite a ways, it&#39;s impossible to ignore. There is a huge parking lot, usually filled with 18-wheelers and pick-up trucks! Long before I was married I had been there a couple of times with a boyfriend/girlfriends and I actually have a funny/creepy/funny story that I think I will save for another time and place.....<br /><br />Yes, behind this innocent facade of mine are some daaaaark secrets....... :evil:<br />

				Another former Texan here -- I lived in Midland (hometown of GWDumbass) -- and you could buy &quot;self pleasuring devices&quot; at the MALL people, the MALL.&nbsp; In addition to a myriad of &quot;other&quot; sexploration toybox items (dildos, vanity condoms, whips, edible unmentionables, etc), were also for sale in the non-XXX novelty gift store chain called Spencers.&nbsp; Again in the MALL.<br /><br />This was also almost 10 years ago though so perhaps things have changed.

				Some Spencers are, um, more &quot;outgoing&quot; than others I think.&nbsp; Ours was particularly well stocked though items were not particularly grouped together.<br /><br />Our mall was also full service.&nbsp; You could go to the dentist, ice skate, buy a motor home, attend a recital, pierce your ears, buy your sex toys, invest in a new lawnmower, visit the local radio station, and shop the department store cosmetic counters while you waited for them to detail then new car you just bought -- all in the mall.<br /><br />Not to mention, shop for hot tubs, go to the movies, ride the only public escalator in town (the sears was 2 stories), play video games, visit santa, and eat some blue bell ice cream at the soda fountain.<br /><br />

				(http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/us/nt/ma/ma_nws_1.gif)<br /><br />Wed Oct 18, 11:08 AM ET<br /><br />Israeli police say they are on the lookout for 40 vibrators and a 200-dollar dildo after thieves plundered the automobile of a noted sexologist in Tel Aviv.<br /><br />&quot;Thieves broke into her car and apparently stole from her a caseload of vibrators,&quot; police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told AFP. &quot;It&#39;s difficult to say the exact value of the items stolen, but obviously we&#39;re searching for these items just as with any other incident of theft.&quot;<br /><br />The thieves were likely surprised by the contents, Rosenfeld said Wednesday.<br /><br />The two metal cases stolen from Shelly Pasternak&#39;s car Friday resembled those used for expensive audio-visual equipment, but instead contained massage oils, dildos, whips, Chinese balls and handcuffs, as well as vibrators.<br /><br />In all, the thieves made off with about 2,000 dollars worth of sex toys, Pasternak said, adding that the most valuable item was an elaborate vibrating dildo that sells for 200 dollars.<br /><br />&quot;It&#39;s a very unique one because it gives very high pleasure to women,&quot; she said.<br /><br />However, Pasternak said she was most concerned about a book of receipts inside the case which contained the names of customers who purchased sex toys, many of whom prefer to remain anonymous.<br /><br />Pasternak, 32, is a sexologist who hosts a sex program on Israeli television, holds workshops and lectures at bachelor and bachelorette parties.

				I missed the El Paso bit.&nbsp; El Paso is one of my least favorite places ever.<br /><br />Geographically it&#39;s right next to Warez which is another pretty awful place.&nbsp; Really it seems like a giant dirty city divided by two countries.&nbsp; Half is in Mexico (Warez) and half in Texas (El Paso).&nbsp; There&#39;s a walking bridge and a car/checkpoint if you want to go between the two.&nbsp; Warez is entirely full of strange boarder town awfulness -- drugs, cheap alcohol, prostitution, tacky souvenirs.&nbsp; El Paso doesn&#39;t fare much better but they do continually try to legislate the dividing line and the common place vices of Warez are definitely illegal in El Paso (save for the tacky souvenirs -- those are everywhere).<br /><br />Warez has also been in the news sporadically in the past few years as a high number of prostitutes have been killed.&nbsp; Like 200 or so (yipes).<br /><br />

Mexico is such a beautiful country with a lot of great places to visit and if someone goes to Juarez they will be too afraid to go anywhere else in Mexico. And it&#39;s not just because it&#39;s a border town, we&#39;ve been to lots of Mexican border towns and not one of them has been the pit that is Juarez.
