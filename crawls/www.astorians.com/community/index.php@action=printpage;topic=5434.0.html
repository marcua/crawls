				I can also recommend just getting a good bread baking book and a bunch of flour and yeast and make bread a lot. There are any number of great books. This one (http://ecookbooks.com/products.html?ref=286386562&amp;sid=21404820070305082602&amp;action=det_34292) just won a James Beard Award, but I haven&#039;t read it. If you happen to have a heavy ovenproof dutch oven, you might also try Mark Bittman&#039;s 24-hour no-knead bread (http://kitchen.apartmenttherapy.com/food/news/bittmans-noknead-bread-phenomenon-014744). Bread machines are a bit dorky, but they do let you play with different types of flours and flavors (sesame semolina bread -- yum!) without having to spend as much time as making bread from scratch. I have one, but I also make bread from scratch from time to time too. As for ingredients, King Arthur bread flour is available at, say, Key Foods. Good yeast is harder to find, for some reason. Mostly what you find is expired packets of very overpriced yeast. But I&#039;ve found that Whole Foods, at least some of them, carry 1-pound blocks of professional-grade yeast for about $5. That&#039;ll last you for a long, long time. (Heck, I&#039;ll give you some. There&#039;s no way I&#039;ll use the whole pound before it expires!)<br /><br />If you do go to a class, though, please let us know how it went and what you thought of it!<br />

				I agree - just baking lots of bread is a great way to educate yourself.&nbsp; I come from a family of bakers, and my mom used to bake bread every week when I was a kid.&nbsp; I thought it was kind of dorky when I was little, but now I realize just how lucky I was to have homemade bread every week.&nbsp; &nbsp;I first started baking bread because I wanted to get over my fear of handling yeast, which I though could be killed rather easily (it&#039;s hardy, resilient stuff!).&nbsp; My mom&#039;s challah was my favorite, and that&#039;s what I started with.&nbsp; It&#039;s a very forgiving bread and makes THE BEST french toast.&nbsp; And it only takes four hours or so, compared to some breads I&#039;ve made, like sourdough, which takes longer and is more persnickety because of the crust.<br /><br />I tasted the no-knead bread yesterday, which was tasty and very interesting.<br /><br />So, yes, just start baking!&nbsp; Get a good book, start reading.&nbsp; I think you&#039;ll find it will be easier than you think.&nbsp; :-)

				Meg is right ... as someone who has gone through baking classes, I can tell you for certain that no one can really teach you how to make bread; it&#039;s all experience and getting used to how it looks at each of its stages.&nbsp; A lot of trial and error, but it&#039;s so worth it.&nbsp; Challah bread is definitely a good one to do in the beginning, but the dough can be sticky so it might freak you out a bit.&nbsp; In school we started with French bread, and white Pullman.&nbsp; I&#039;d suggest getting a book that has bread recipes you&#039;re interested in trying and just dive in.&nbsp; Helps to have a Kitchenaid with a dough hook, but bread dough can certainly be mixed and kneaded by hand (that was our midterm two quarters or so ago - whole wheat bread by hand!!).&nbsp; Even baking time and doneness can&#039;t be taught; you just need to do it and see it.&nbsp; Best of luck to you, Newtownian.&nbsp; Few things rock more than eating bread you&#039;ve made yourself!&nbsp; If I run across recipes I particular found enjoyable, I&#039;ll post them here for you.

				This was a really good recipe from last weeks NYTimes. &nbsp;I made it and was surprised how tasty it was. &nbsp;I was a bit skeptical just looking at the ingredients, but texture was more like a muffin, than a yeasty bread. &nbsp;I have a convection oven and time to bake was only about 30 minutes, so watch the timing closely for doneness. &nbsp;<br /><br />Recipe: Quick Whole Wheat and Molasses Bread <br />Time: About 11/4 hours<br /><br />butter for greasing pan <br />1 2/3 cups plain yogurt <em>(I used the full fat strained Greek yogurt)</em><br />2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour <br />1/2 cup cornmeal<br />1 teaspoon salt<br />1 teaspoon baking soda<br />1/2 cup molasses.<br /><br />1. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Grease an 8-by-4-inch or 9-by 5-inch loaf pan, preferably nonstick.<br />2. Mix together dry ingredients. Stir molasses into yogurt. Stir liquid into dry ingredients (just enough to combine) then pour into loaf pan. <em>(I found this needed to be turned onto the counter and kneaded by hand a bit to mix it completely and shape it into a loaf.)</em> &nbsp;Bake until firm and a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Cool on a rack for 15 minutes before removing from pan.<br /><br />Yield: 1 loaf<br />

				True about the stickiness of challah compared to french bread.&nbsp; My mom used to make that, too!&nbsp; I love how the dough gets smooth and with that unique sheen that comes with dough that has been kneaded enough.<br /><br />I do all my kneading by hand.&nbsp; I do have a KA, but have never used the bread hook.&nbsp; Does it really work well?&nbsp; I love getting my hands in the dough and working with it.&nbsp; And if I have some anger or stress to get out, kneading is a great way to do it!&nbsp; Then there&#039;s the comforting smell of baking bread and then the yummy taste...mmmm...very soothing.

				We actually have a bread machine and make bread at least once a week. While it isn&#039;t as authentic or &quot;hands-on&quot; it saves us a ton of money and it tastes far better than store-bought bread, plus it is far simpler than store-bought bread in the sense that it has less ingredients.<br /><br />I think when I have more time I may make an effort to make bread without the machine, but for now this is a really good solution for us.<br /><br />But as far as your original question goes - no I don&#039;t know where you could take some classes. I wonder if any bakeries in the neighborhood wouldn&#039;t mind you shadowing them for a couple of hours? You may be able to just call around and ask if you can do that, or if you can get some hands on experience on a slow day.

				There have to be tons of options around.&#160; New York has a number of cooking schools, and I know that many of them offer short-term classes for the non-professional cook.&#160; Just googling <em>nyc bread baking classes</em> brings up loads of options.<br /><br />Sullivan St. Bakery bread baking classes (http://www.worldtable.com/blog/06.09.25.html).&#160; The ones listed have obviously passed, but you can call them and find out when they will be offering more.<br /><br />The French Culinary Institute (http://www.frenchculinary.com/jump_amateur.htm) has a number of expensive bread making courses (look for them on the left hand side).<br /><br />And here&#039;s (http://www.cookingschools.com/cities/new-york-cooking-schools-institutes.html) a list of cooking schools in nyc, with many links, and some bread baking notations.<br /><br />I also like wasabisam&#039;s suggestion of contacting local bakeries.

				I can second harlan&#039;s suggestion. One summer when I was a kid and was bored, I decided to learn to bake bread. I got a book out of the library (Beard on Bread) and made bread just about every day. I had some flops, but some really good loaves too.

				I was inspired by this thread and did some bread-making-related activities today:&nbsp; I reinvigorated my sourdough starter given to me a year and a half ago by jayme, and I baked challah!&nbsp; It turned out great!&nbsp; I even used yeast that was waaaay old.&nbsp; Some pictures of the process are here (http://flickr.com/photos/mcotner/sets/72157600003604411/).<br /><br />I&#039;ve never used yeast other than the stuff in the packets (Fleishmanns, Red Star, etc).&nbsp; Can anyone tell me how professional-grade yeast can change my bread baking life?<br /><br />I&#039;m excited about working with the sourdough starter again, too, which has a lovely clean sour-winey smell to it.&nbsp; I made bread with it many months ago and it turned out great; I believe some astorians even had a taste then.&nbsp; I use the master sourdough recipe from the Cheese Board, an awesome bakery and cheese shop in Berkeley, CA.<br />

				Nice pics, Meg! I don&#039;t think the yeast itself in the big cube of yeast was any different (although I&#039;m not sure, now that I think about it, whether it was normal or quick-rise), but it actually works&nbsp; :lol:, unlike the last several packets I&#039;ve tried&nbsp; :x !

				Frank Bruni&#039;s blog has some thoughts about bread at restaurants (http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/03/23/our-nightly-bread/). His last paragraph talks about a bread that&#039;s gotta be like 30 times more complicated than anything I&#039;ve ever made:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">As I combed my mind for other memorable bread experiences during the last year of dining, I realized that at least one other bread shout-out was in order. It goes to L’Atelier de Joel Robuchon.<br /><br />It’s funny: the first time I dined there, in its opening days, the bread wasn’t distinctive. The restaurant was having problems with its ovens and getting it from an outside bakery.<br /><br />The situation was soon fixed, and L’Atelier was producing its petit baguettes in house, starting with a fermented mixture of Evian, apples, raisins and lemon juice, then adding rye flour in stages to make the dough. The whole process, according to the restaurant, takes nine days. The results are terrific.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yikes. I&#039;m humbled.<br />
