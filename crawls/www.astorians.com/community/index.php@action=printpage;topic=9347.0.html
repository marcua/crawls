				I&#039;ll be at the parade.&nbsp; I work right on Broadway just south of Wall.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be in the thick of it, and I&#039;ll be out to enjoy it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have to make one observation about the game.&nbsp; As a Bills fan, I was naturally rooting against the Pats.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t like Belicheck.&nbsp; And I think it was absolutely classless that he left the field before the game was officially over.&nbsp; Yeah, there was only 1 second on the clock, and all that was going to happen was the Giants take a knee.&nbsp; But come on, take it like a man, show some freaking respect, and wait till the game is officially over.&nbsp; Absolutely no class.<br /><br />Go Giants!!!
