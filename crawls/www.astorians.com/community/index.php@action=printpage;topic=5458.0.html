				Since this is a Astoria based web community I feel I would be remiss if I didn&#039;t point out that while they call the city by its Ottoman name &quot;Istanbul&quot; they still call the building Hagia Sophia by it&#039;s greek name (the turkish would be Ayasofya)...<br /><br />but, hey, I don&#039;t want insite century old conflicts...

				With my last job I traveled all the time.&#160; Like the idea of the Neuschwanstein Castle, as it was used in the movie &#8220;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&#8221;, and how I love that movie.&#160; Truly Scrumptious.&#160; Corcovado in Rio really is magnificent. <br /><br />Personally, I would suggest The Great Barrier Reef in Australia. It is the largest in the world.&#160; And I would also have to say the Amazon Rain Forrest. It truly is one of the most amazing things, and has been referred to as &#8220;The Lungs of the Earth&#8221;. Funny how that term never seems to be used in the preservation ads.
