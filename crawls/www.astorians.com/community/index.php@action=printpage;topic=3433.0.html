				I like the Broadway pick-up and delivery laundormats more than the one on 30th avenue because they have newer machines, more flexible delivery hours and my clothes come back clean, soft and if it&#39;s a gentle cycle item, they will gentle cycle it as requested (their machines, if you walk in you&#39;ll see, also allow you to set temperature)

				We&#39;ve been using the pick-up and delivery from Grand Avenue Laundromat on 35th St. and 30th Avenue and have had no major problems (except the one time a pink t-shirt turned a bit blue). The guys are really nice and the prices reasonable.

				We use Rocket Laundry (I think?) on 31st St. and 24th Ave. They have free pick up and delivery, though we&#39;ve only used the delivery once.<br /><br />How much do the other ones charge?&nbsp; They charge $.85 a lb and I went to another laundry on 24th Ave. that was $.65, but they didn&#39;t fold so well and it wasn&#39;t worth walking the extra 3 blocks out of my way on the way to work.&nbsp; &nbsp;I just can&#39;t bring myself to have them pick up or deliver when they&#39;re around the corner....

				well, that&#39;s tough to say.&nbsp; It depends upon how often you bring it in and how many people it&#39;s for.&nbsp; We have 2 1/2 of us now and I have about 25 lbs weekly (or maybe bi-weekly?).&nbsp;

				I go to a place on 31st ave between 34st and 33st.&nbsp; There is a very nice woman there and she takes wonderful care of my clothes.&nbsp; She loads up on the softener and they smell nice when they are done. <br /><br />She charges 50 cents/lb which seems very reasonable.&nbsp; There is a 10lb minimum.&nbsp; She also launders shirts and irons them for $1.

				That laundromat is full of bad attitudes.&nbsp; I used to go there and the woman was horrible too.&nbsp; I think it must be a requirement in laundromats, that the staff be rude and grouchy. I&#39;ve never met any nice ones except at the huge 24 hour DryRite place on 31ave and 48th st years ago. Does anyone knows if it&#39;s still there and is it any good anymore?
