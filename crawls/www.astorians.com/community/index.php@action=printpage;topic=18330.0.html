				Whats up all?! I&#039;m looking for an apartment in Astoria. Do most of the apartments come with wood floors? I&#039;ve had a broker tell me if I&#039;m looking for non-wood floors then Astoria may not be for me.<br /><br />Practically every apartment that I&#039;ve looked at had wood floors that were old and not well maintained. They squeak, enhance sound (neighbors above and within my own apr), warp/shrink/stretch with age leading to resonance whenever the Home Theater is played, have &quot;repairs&quot; done with yellow filler material, etc. <br /><br />I&#039;m looking for good ole cheap tile sitting on top of concrete.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If anyone has leads or knows what types of buildings to look into please let me know. Thanks<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve seen a couple apartments that had non-wood or mostly non-wood floors. One had carpet with tile in the kitchen and bath, and was in a large building but was newly remodeled. Another had tile throughout with brand new hardwood in two bedrooms, and was in a private home, pretty new. Hope that helps!

				Why not just buy a rug and put it down?&nbsp; It&#039;s not like it has to be a full rug that you install.&nbsp; Just go to the store, buy a rug, put it on the floor.&nbsp; Problem solved&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />There may be a lot of wood floors around but most leases actually ask you to put down a rug.

				Yes, I have a rug, the issue is when the wood gets old and warped&nbsp; and doesnt &quot;seal&quot; tight.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for more of a solid foundation. Looks like a private house, first floor rental may be the best route.

				Our place has both carpeting and tile - carpet in the living room and bedrooms and tile in the kitchen and dining room (oh, and bathroom).&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t sure how I&#039;d feel about the carpet, after living for 20 years with wood floors, but so far I like it quite a bit.&nbsp; We replaced the living room carpet shortly after we moved in and watched the installation process - there are wood floors underneath but they are in pretty gnarly condition and it would have taken quite some time and $$$ to bring them up to an even &quot;passable&quot; level.<br /><br />So yes, there are apartments out there that do not have wood floors and use alternate floor coverings, here in Astoria.

				I used to live in a 1 bedroom &quot;garden apt&quot; (and it really was - I had my own backyard patio) with stone tile in the entire place except the bathroom. It was awesome - easy to clean and it kept the place so cool in the summer that I never needed AC.

				Most coops will have requirements of 70% floors covering with carpeting.&nbsp; Most coop owners i know usully not follow that rule unless a cosomeome complains.&nbsp; If you are an owner but have decided to rent out your unit it would be the wiser to carpet the floors so as ti avoid complaints about your tenants. There are plenty of apartments with laminate flooring out there but rarely see carpeting. <br /><br />Outside of vinyl tiles tiling can be as expensive or even more expensive thay hardwood flooring.&nbsp; Ceramic or porcelain&nbsp; tiling is more expensive labor wise than hardwood floors.&nbsp; Obviously a hardwood floor will typically look more attractive but thats because most people are afraid of artistic designs on flooring.
