I&#039;m not 100% sure about this but that building I think was part of Finkelstein&#039;s tire dealer and looked underused/unused until the building was renovated and the Zodiac opened in the 1990s.&nbsp; &nbsp; There are actually apartments about the Zodiac that are supposed to be quite nice, at least that is what the &quot;New York Times&quot; said when they wrote about them when the building was remodeled and the Zodiac opened.<br /><br />The northeast corner now features a candy shop, not yet open, that replaces an Internet cafe that seemed to open and close in about a New York minute.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I walked by a week or two ago the Internet cafe had closed and the food was still in there mouldering.&nbsp; &nbsp;The place had been a print shop that had been there since I moved to Astoria in &#039;87.&nbsp; &nbsp; There is another little convenience store on the block called &quot;The Himalaya&quot; and that just closed and I think they are moving operations to the corner where the print shop/short-lived internet cafe was.<br /><br />The southeast corner is currently under renovation and, according to this board anyway, a bank is moving in.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I first moved here the place was a Volvo dealer or a Saab dealer or a repair place for a European auto manufacturer.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can no longer remember if it was even open when I moved here or opened and then closed.&nbsp; &nbsp;In any event, a cafe opened (I forget the name) -- roughly at the same time as the Zodiac opened -- and I thought it did well, at least in the warm weather months when the tables were moved to the sidewalk.&nbsp; &nbsp; At one point the cafe closed and renovated and reopened but the renovation didn&#039;t work and the place went under.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />There are a number of residential developments are Newtown between 31st and 21st.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are at least six under various stages of construction or completed that I can think of off the top of my head.<br /><br />There is an Italian restaurant on Newtown, two blocks east of 31st on the north side of the street that I don&#039;t think was open when I moved here.&nbsp; &nbsp;Right next door was a steak house that I assume was owned and run by the folks who run the Italian place.&nbsp; &nbsp;That has closed fairly recently and the Italian place took over the space.&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;ve never been to the Italian place and never went to the steak house.&nbsp; I would like to go to the Italian place, though.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Before Zodiac came in 1997 or so, the building was actually closed for many years, but I believe it used to be a parking garage.&nbsp; It was not used for anything though as far as I can remember in the late 80s and up to the mid 90s.&nbsp; Across from Zodiac, the cafe that was there was called Byzantio.&nbsp; That&#039;s gone and a bank is going to come in.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Italian restaurant that you are talking about is named Momento, and I believe the same owners have it which previously had Amici Amore and the Butcher Bros. Steakhouse, which were at the same location.<br /><br />Long before that, the place was a Greek lounge which offered low-key live music and appetizers.&nbsp; It used to be named &quot;Akroama&quot; but then changed its name to something else which I can&#039;t remember now.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_77872">The Zodiac building was a large auto repair type place and later expanded into RV sales. The owner Mr. Manginello was shot dead in front of his house near Bryaant HS.It was quite a shock. I recall the police said it was some woman who shot him, loke it was acrime of passion. Others said it was a mafia hit. I don&#039;t think the killer was caught. The business tried to make a go of it with his son running it I believe, but it sunk. The building was empty for a while till Zodiac. </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_77916">One quickie:&nbsp; On the east side of 35th Street, between 31st and 30 Avenues (but close to the corner of 31st), is a Baptist Church or some sort of evangelical church.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I moved to Astoria is was a synagogue.&nbsp; &nbsp;One day I walked by and it was a church.<br /><br />Another intersection that is changing is what someone told me was the &quot;old center of Astoria&quot;&nbsp; the intersection at 21st Street where Newtown Avenue and Astoria Blvd. converge.<br /><br />The southeast corner hasn&#039;t changed as far as I can recall.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is some sort of no-name fast food joint on the corner, but that side of the block is interesting.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you walk east on Newtown there is one new apartment building that has gone up and that is occupied and what was a car repair shop on the corner of Newtown and whatever the street is that runs parallel to 21st (one block east).&nbsp; The business closed and no doubt the building will be knocked down to make way for an apartment building.&nbsp; &nbsp;One other interesting tidbit of information about that block -- or that side of the block -- is that the other auto repair shop on the block -- located mid-block -- years and years ago (long before I moved here) was a movie theatre believe it or not.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can still see the projection booth above the entrance.<br /><br />The southwest corner of the block has changed.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I moved in and for years after there was a general store or convenience store called Fishbein&#039;s, which closed.&nbsp; &nbsp;I never went in there so I am not 100% certain what kind of store it was.&nbsp; &nbsp;Next to Fishbein&#039;s was a liquor store or &quot;bottle shop&quot; as New Yorkers call them.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think the bottle shop relocated further south on 21st Street, just above 30th Avenue, into a building that was a tire repair shop.&nbsp; &nbsp;The tire repair shops on 21st Street are rapidly disappearing.&nbsp; I am not sure what the business is that replaced Fishbein&#039;s/the bottle shop, but it might be a medical facility.<br /><br />The northwest corner of the block is a now closed gas station.&nbsp; &nbsp;I assume they will throw up another apartment building.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is an apartment building currently being constructed next door to the closed gas station.&nbsp; A single-family wood-frame house was there.<br /><br />On the northeast corner of the block was until very recently a gardening shop.&nbsp; &nbsp;That closed and has been replaced by a convenience store.&nbsp; &nbsp;There used to be a butcher shop and a Korean deli/green grocer, among other businesses, on that block fronting Astoria Blvd.&nbsp; &nbsp;When the gardening shop closed I thought they were going to take the building down, but I guess not.&nbsp; &nbsp;Right next door on 21st is a relatively new senior citizens housing complex.&nbsp; &nbsp;That was a parking lot/used car dealer when I first moved here.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />On the west side of 21st, between Astoria Blvd./Newtown, is a real interesting looking building.&nbsp; &nbsp; The property is shaped like a pie wedge with the skinny end facing east.&nbsp; &nbsp;That affected the design of the building so it is kind of interesting looking.&nbsp; &nbsp; There is a Chinese take out place and a convenience store on the first floor.&nbsp; I assume apartments are located in the apartments above.&nbsp; &nbsp;On the western end of that block is a new apartment dwelling.&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought it was an odd place for an apartment building because that area isn&#039;t exactly the most aesthetically pleasing part of Astoria.&nbsp; &nbsp;But there is much development in that part of Astoria.<br /><br />And on the east side of 21st, between Astoria Blvd/Newtown, is another odd piece of property that houses a used furniture store on the western end and what was a parking lot on the eastern end of the block right across from the Catholic School/Church complex.&nbsp; &nbsp; There is another apartment building going up on that site as I write.</div>

I do recall going in there when it first opened. It was just a regular pizza place. Not fancy at all. Same good food though.<br /><br />Oh and there was an exterminator across 29th st. from it. They had some funny name I can&#039;t recall... I think...<br /><br /><br /><br />All of them fallout shelter signs... I have one from my parent&#039;s building here. There were survival rations in the basement. Drums of water and boxes of crackers. I think they cleared it out in the late 80s...<br /><br />The movie theater on 35th av. was a parking lot for Kaufman studios. There was apparently an old army bunker under it (small, nothing too fancy) with a ping pong table (relative worked there and found it)<br /><br />RR running on the el... Then the R... Then the B during rush hours... then the switch to the N and actual clean graffitiless trains that didn&#039;t break down every single day.<br /><br />Hell Gate getting painted for the first time since it was built, mid 90s. <br /><br />Peter Vallone Sr.<br /><br />114th pct. at 30th av in what became the hanac building west of crescent. <br /><br />Astoria General.<br /><br />261 (well, they were closed just a few years ago). <br /><br />Typin Steel (now CostCo). <br /><br />L.I.C. H.S. &amp; those new houses land as one huge empty lot with scattered abandoned cars and trash.<br /><br />&quot;Yonkers Construction&quot; and that ridiculous project on 31st av where they dug a huge hole for miles in either direction (or so it seemed) taking up parking spots and attracting bugs and rats and trash. <br /><br />Vigilante neighborhood people setting the yonkers construction trailer on fire july 4 night @ 31st av and 30th street. (it was like 3 or 4 AM...)<br /><br />the old houses at 31st av and 30th street. then the empty lot, the demo of the house next door... (and now them new fancy ones put up there...)<br /><br />The &#039;Slayer&#039; abandoned house, 31st. av south of crescent...<br /><br />I&#039;ll think of more later...</div>

Best damn gyros I ever had...<br /><br />the apartment building at Bway and 30th having a &#039;rent strike&#039; - with rent strike signs in all the windows. guess the landlord wasn&#039;t fixing things so the tenants banded together and refused to pay until he did. I can&#039;t imagine something like that happening today...<br /><br />the gang hanging at the corner of bway and 31st, or the dunkin doughnuts, or that parking lot - during the crack years...<br /><br />ah... if i don&#039;t stop I&#039;ll be here all night.<br /></div>
