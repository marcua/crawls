				Those are macarons.&nbsp; They&#039;re French cookies.&nbsp; It&#039;s a meringue-like chewy cookie with&nbsp; a filling.&nbsp; They&#039;re awesome!<br /><br /><br />Or here&#039;s a better description: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaron (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaron)

				I wrote to Groupons to ask about the colorful little cakes.&nbsp; It turns out they&#039;re a stock image to represent the kinds of things you can get discounts on.&nbsp; If we want those particular delicacies, we&#039;re gonna have to work harder to find them.&nbsp; They&#039;re not necessarily in the New York area.&nbsp; So now we have to track down the photography studio, the photographer, maybe a photostylist...oh, little cakes, will you ever be ours?

				If you’re after French macaroons, Laduree is the best:<br /><br />www.laduree.fr/public_en/historique/histoire_macaron.htm (http://www.laduree.fr/public_en/historique/histoire_macaron.htm)<br /><br />Unfortunately you’ll have to fly to France, London, Japan or Zurich to sample their wares. Macaroons are delicate and need to be eaten on the day.<br /><br />You can get them in New York at La Maison du Chocolat www.lamaisonduchocolat.com/en/#/creations/macarons/1 (http://www.lamaisonduchocolat.com/en/#/creations/macarons/1)<br /><br />And some recs from Chowhounder&#039;s:<br />chowhound.chow.com/topics/666030?tag=search_results;results_list (http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/666030?tag=search_results;results_list)<br />http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/695959?tag=search_results;results_list (http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/695959?tag=search_results;results_list)<br />

				Also, Le Financier has them.&nbsp; They have six locations in the city and the closest location they have to us is in Grand Central Station.&nbsp; &nbsp;Their pistachio maracon is so, so awesome!&nbsp; &nbsp;I have to say I prefer theirs to La Maison du Chocolat.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.financierpastries.com/ &nbsp;(http://www.financierpastries.com/)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I used to work at the Park Ave. branch of Fauchon, where they were flown in from their Paris HQ on a regular basis. Best cookies in the world. Small were $2 each; large $4....and WORTH it!! They are difficult to make due to the careful timing of the cooking and balance of ingredients, otherwise I&#039;d never leave the kitchen.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />Haven&#039;t found a version better than Fauchon, but Le Financier was pretty close. If somebody suceeds in getting them at a discount, by all means let me know!

				Article in todays am nVive la France!<br />Tuesday July 6, 2010 5:12 PM By Ya-Roo Yang <br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Looking for a sweet way to celebrate Bastille Day? Try macarons.. No, not macaroons — the dense almond or coconut cookies seen around Passover. French macarons —<br /><br />The colorful, delicately crunchy and slightly chewy cookies held together by creamy granache — are arguably one of France’s greatest contributions to the culinary world.<br /><br />A little history<br />The almond cookie part of macarons made its first appearance at Catherine de Medici’s wedding to Henry II in 1533, but its popularity didn’t catch on until the French revolution. At the turn of the 20th century, the Parisienne baker Laduree started putting granache between two almond cookies. Voila! The modern macaron was born.<br /><br />Macarons today<br />MToday, macarons are now showing up everywhere, from online shops like MadMac.com to Starbucks. There’s even a Macaron Museum in Montmorillon, France.<br /><br />“I love the texture of the shell, the crisp, thin outer ‘crust’, the just-a-tad chewy innards and the slight roughness of the craggy little foot that forms on the bottom of a perfect macaron,” said Dorie Greenspan, author of Chocolate Desserts by Pierre Herme and the forthcoming My French Table.<br /><br />Greenspan ought to know. After all, her painstakingly detailed recipe of Pierre Herme’s chocolate macaron is considered the gold standard of macaron recipes and made macarons possible for home cooks.<br /><br />The perfect macaron<br />Aside from the delicate eggshell like sheen in the crust, Ms. Greenspan said she looks for beautifully made macarons with great flavor combinations. “Macarons by their very nature are sweet, so the skill is in finding the perfect flavor combinations that can contrast with the sweetness or use it to its advantage,” said Greenspan, who has a special affinity for the chocolate variety.<br /><br />MACARONS IN NEW YORK<br />Most macaron recipes span several cookbook pages, so thankfully in New York, there is City has no shortage of ready-made, great macarons. So celebrate liberty, equality and fraternity in high style and give a toast to France.<br /><br />Kee&#039;s Chocolates SoHo <br />80 Thompson St., 212-334-3284<br />One of New York’s premier chocolatiers makes handcrafted macarons. Box of 8 ($22.40); bag of mini macarons ($4).<br /><br />We recommend: The Rosewater Lychee Macaron — it&#039;s the closest to Pierre Herme’s<br />macaron in Paris<br /><br />La Maison Du Chocolat <br />30 Rockefeller Plaza., 212-265-9404, <br />1018 Madison Ave., 212-744-7117<br />63 Wall St., 212-952-1123<br />An all-time favorite among NYC gourmands, LMDC’s macarons come in 2 sizes: $2.50 each for the small macaron and $5 for the large macaron. A box of 6 is $15; a box of 12 is $30.<br /><br />We recommend: What else? The chocolate macaron, of course. 6pc box $15<br /><br />Bouchon Bakery<br />10 Columbus Circle, 212-823-9364<br />The macarons from Sebastian Rouxel, executive pastry chef of the Thomas Keller Restaurant Group, also come in two sizes: $12 for a package of 6 minis or $2.75 each for the regular ones. Current seasonal flavors include pistachio, lemon and strawberry.<br /><br />We recommend: Lemon<br /><br />Dessert Club Chikalicious<br />204 E. 10th St., 212-475-0929<br />The macarons here aren’t as colorful as other places in the city but they are just as delicious! $1.95 each.<br /><br />We recommend: Rose<br /><br />La Maison du Macaron<br />132 W. 23rd St., 212-243-2757<br />Formerly known as Madeleine Patisserie, this French-style bakery (whose name means house of macarons) carries an average of 15 flavors of macarons, sold individually for $2.50 each.<br /><br />We recommend: Salted caramel<br /><br />Almondine<br />442 9th St., Brooklyn, 718-797-5026<br />One of Dorie Greennspan’s favorite spots for macarons, this DUMBO bakery sells macarons individually for $1.25 each.<br /><br />We recommend: Coffee<br /><br />MadMac<br />madmacnyc.com/<br />Can’t get to a store? Order macarons online from Florian Bellanger, the Paris-trained former chef of Fouchon’s in NYC. $18 for a tray of 12.<br /><br />We recommend: The Tea Box, a sampler box of 12 tea-flavored macarons<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />y paper about macarons.
