				Yay for overcoming the fear of baking! (I totally get what you say about it being like chemistry)<br /><br />I was once afraid of yeast, thinking I&#39;d kill it no matter what I&#39;d do.&nbsp; That stuff is much more reslient than I first suspected.<br /><br />I *heart* baking (and baked goods)!<br />Now I&#39;m craving making and eating homemade donuts.<br /><br /><br /><em>We should really have an astorians baking conclave some weekend.</em>

				Im in for the conclave, maybe more as a taster.<br /><br />Prepared the walnut muffins tonight, sort of heavy and a little densely chewy with&nbsp; a hint of baking soda or powder????&nbsp; Better with butter.&nbsp; Not that bad really but not great.<br /><br />Strawberry rhubarb jam turned out much better.&nbsp; I will try it next time with orange peel.<br /><br />We fell asleep so did not yet try Jens version leek/white bean soup with sausage. Her prep work for the red lettuce, chive, tomato, goat cheese salad looks good too but now its too late to eat.

				Aw, poor Jonathan. I&#39;m the opposite. I&#39;m afraid of anything that <em>doesn&#39;t</em> have precise measurements. I love baking because it&#39;s so exact.. and therefore, I assume, harder to mess up. Of course, then, I still don&#39;t bake that much because then I would EAT everything I made. But I&#39;m definitely more experienced with that than with cooking anything else.

				Baking conclave - so when should we do this, and where?&nbsp; Sounds like we have Harlan, Jonathan, and myself on board.&nbsp; MandaT? Others?&nbsp; What do you think about it being more than just potluck, but sharing technique and knowledge?<br /><br />This could be loads of fun!&nbsp; I love baking.<br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; Great baking resource:&nbsp; &quot;Baking With Julia.&quot;

				When: Well, I&#39;d certainly suggest a chilly, rainy day! It&#39;s going to be too hot to bake in anything other than a toaster oven soon... Hm, looking at the weather forcast, today seems like the best option for the forseeable future. Anyone wanna skip work this afternoon? :) (Kidding, but tempted...) <br /><br />Where: I have a large eat-in kitchen with a large oven, I like guests, and the scratch-happy cat that some of you have met has moved on to live with her mother... <br /><br />What: We could have a properly-balanced meal, with a quiche and four desserts... :)<br /><br />For baking, I like Rosie&#39;s (http://www.ecookbooks.com/products.html?ref=286386562&amp;sid=12249020060608114913&amp;action=det_21651&amp;searchvalues=rosie%27s&amp;searchlogic=simplesearch) and Joy (http://www.ecookbooks.com/products.html?ref=286386562&amp;sid=12249020060608114913&amp;action=det_23434&amp;searchvalues=joy%20%3DAND%3Bof%20%3DAND%3Bcooking&amp;searchlogic=simplesearch). In my mother&#39;s kitchen, it was years before I realized that &quot;Joy&quot; was not the name of the cookbook author, as she would always say &quot;Let&#39;s ask Joy&quot;, or &quot;Let&#39;s look it up in Joy&quot;...<br />

				I have &quot;Beard on Bread&quot; if you&#39;d like to borrow it, Jonathan. <br /><br />I also am willing to test and I believe I have an advantage over other tasting candidates in that I am closer and can make it to your place before things have time to cool off. I am sure this important to you, as the real test of any baked good is how it tastes fresh out of the oven with a little smudge o&#39; butter - right?<br /><br />

				Robin, thanks for the offer but ive got about 30 cook books.&nbsp; If I cant find what I need then your book would be welcome.<br /><br />Going to avoid traditional breads for now and focus on sweet desserts and maybe some foccaccia.<br /><br />Now as for being a taster close by, thats a good point.&nbsp; BUT even better, invite them to bake at your place like Harlan and you dont have to budge!&nbsp; Harlan smart.

				First of all, Jonathan - if the chef gig doesn&#39;t work out for you, you should write for TV!&nbsp; Your &quot;Bakers anonymous&quot; scene was awesome!&nbsp; (But your food rocks, so perhaps you shouldn&#39;t leave cooking just yet...)<br /><br />And please please please let me join your baking conclave!!&nbsp; I feel I have just recently mastered the art of the Danish - pinwheels, pockets, snails, vol-au-vent . . . you name it!&nbsp; I make a mean cherry filling, apple filling, and frangipane (almond).&nbsp; I would also like to volunteer my services as a taster.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is a great idea.&nbsp; I&#39;d love to participate.&nbsp; My custards could use some help, anyway.<br /><br />Anzubird - where in Italy were you?&nbsp; I love Italy!!!

				Harlan, your place sounds like a good idea.&nbsp; What say the rest of you?<br /><br />Josh, I&#39;d love to taste your tarte tatin again.&nbsp; And Marta, foccacia sounds great!&nbsp; I&#39;ll have to think about what to contribute (maybe sourdough bread again, but maybe a genoise with fruit).<br /><br />I&#39;d like to think we each have something unique to contribute, so I look forward to learning from each of you.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />On Preview:&nbsp; glad to see JD is on board! BRING ON THE DANISH.&nbsp; I bet we&#39;d all be happy tasters for that.&nbsp; Hey Jonathan, what baking books do you have, if any?&nbsp; Might be fun to bring baking books we each like, too.<br /><br />P.S. flooz, I was at San Antonio Bakery yesterday and thought of you while eating their delicious bread.&nbsp; I love that place.<br />

Since the Diabetes I&#39;ve obviously had to cut out the sugar but I do treat myself to some chocolate or a bite of something if I&#39;ve eaten extra veggies. Y&#39;all are all so knowledgeable about food, half the stuff you talk about I have never heard of but I&#39;m always willing to learn! I&#39;ve tried Splenda in a few baked things and it isn&#39;t TOO bad. I am a simpleton at heart I guess because my all time favorite sweets still are No Bake Cookies....yumyumyumyum....I haven&#39;t tried making them with Splenda yet, but now that they are on my mind I might have to try.

(Strap in folks; it&#39;s gonna be bumpy ride!)<br /><br />Mostly just the laminated doughs are time-consuming (like puff pastry, croissant dough, or Danish dough).&nbsp; Laminated doughs are tricky because you&#39;re not just mixing butter into the dough, you&#39;re actually placing it on top of your dough and folding it like a package, then rolling it out and folding 4 more times.&nbsp; The butter in between the microscopically thin layers of dough then melts during baking, and the steam rises to create small pockets of air, hence the flakiness.&nbsp; It can definitely be done in one day, but temperature is such an important part of it.&nbsp; If it&#39;s too hot (as our kitchen tends to get), the butter that you&#39;ve so carefully rolled in starts to melt and leak out the sides of and into the dough and then you don&#39;t get the proper flakiness (it ends up having a more brioche-like texture).&nbsp; <br /><br />Since Danish and croissant dough include yeast, you need to let the dough retard in the refrigerator at least overnight to get good fermentation (which means flavor).&nbsp; Plus, Danish dough is particularly sticky (lots of eggs and some sugar), so it should stay in the fridge at least overnight to get a good chill on it which makes it infinitely easier to work with.&nbsp; <br /><br />Then, once you start rolling in the butter, the dough has to rest 15 minutes to half an hour (longer if it&#39;s hotter, or if you&#39;ve taken a long time to roll the dough) in between turns, and properly lamintated Danish dough will require 4 separate turns.&nbsp; <em>Then</em>, once you&#39;ve got all your turns into the dough, it should rest in the fridge another hour or so to make it easy to cut and shape, and so that it won&#39;t shrink so much as you work with it.&nbsp; <br /><br />After that, you have to fill the Danish shapes, egg wash them, proof them (which can take 20 to 40 minutes depending on heat and humidity of your kitchen - for those of us without a proof box).&nbsp; Then they get baked in batches since I don&#39;t have a commercial sized oven with commercial sized sheet pans.&nbsp; Once they come out, each piece gets brushed with clear glaze.&nbsp; Whew!!!&nbsp; <br /><br />People take Danish for granted, but it&#39;s very time consuming and must be made with love and care.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;:-D<br /><br />Sorry, this is all very long-winded and Alton Brown-ian, but once I got started, there was no stopping till I fully extolled the art that is Danish making.&nbsp; &nbsp;8-)&nbsp;

Land at Dallas and drive 3hrs to their home.&nbsp; Having never been to Texas I&#39;m excited to see; big open spaces, big horn cattle, cowboy hats, lots of BBQ, hell I even saw oil wells, BUT then we come across this little Czech community??? It was quaint it was cute it was delicious!&nbsp; Signs for danish everywhere... Klapchen???&nbsp; Apparently its quite the famous town for danish.&nbsp; People drive hours to go there.<br />Do you know what I&#39;m talking about?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I may not know the specific town you&#39;re talking about, but I <em>definitely</em> know of these little Czech towns scattered around that are known for their kolaches. There was a little town right on I-35 between Dallas and Waco called West, and as it was right on my way between home and college, I was always stopping in to pick up a few. Everyone knows West and stops in. It&#39;s known as the Czech-stop of Texas! Ha!<br /><br />Speaking of the wonderful joy that is kolaches, here are a few Texas-based kolache recipes:<br />http://www.texasmonthly.com/food/kolache/kolache.6.php<br />(I&#39;m too lazy to turn that into a neat and tidy link.) <br /><br />Yeah, Kolaches were a big part of growing up in Texas. On the weekends, instead of going out to get donuts, we&#39;d go get kolaches. YUM.

I&#39;ve never had the British version of the sausage roll, but the ones at Busy B consisted of a half a piece of sausage (sliced lengthwise) and baked inside what is essentially a sweet dinner roll. So the sausage sorta permeated the taste of the bread.. oh my gosh my mouth is watering! I&#39;m not sure if they used the same dough for the kolaches or not, but that would be a most excellent experiment.

				I still want to make it but things don&#39;t look good right now.&nbsp; If I am able to come, I know there have been requests for my apricot souffle with chocolate creme anglaise.&nbsp; My original intent was to make the chocolate creme anglaise ahead of time, and bring the apricot base for the souffle, so all I would have to do was the final step of egg whites and baking for the souffle.&nbsp; It may not happen, and the best I can do is let you know Friday whether I&#39;ll be coming at all.

				I agree with moving the meeting.&nbsp; I&#39;m loving Meg&#39;s ice cream or drink idea.&nbsp; If Jonathan can&#39;t go, lanseaux might have a conflict, and Harlan&#39;s not digging the infernal weather made worse by ovens, then I think moving the meeting makes the most sense.&nbsp; And, if I&#39;m being perfectly honest and selfish, I will not be in the mood (or proper creative state of mind) to bake or cook anything after a long-ass traveling day back to New York on Friday.&nbsp; (I was not fortunate enough to score a non-stop flight).&nbsp; <br /><br />So there&#39;s my unsolicited opinion.

				OK, I also agree with re-scheduling! As host, I hereby declare Saturday&#39;s Baker&#39;s Anonymous Meeting rescheduled. Perhaps September or so will be more inviting for baking... Mmm, focaccia with roasted tomatoes...<br /><br />I also like the ice cream idea for this weekend, but, honestly, I&#39;m not that enthusiastic about Emack&#39;s. If none of our ice cream experts feels like making their own, I&#39;d actually be perfectly happy hanging out in someone&#39;s backyard with a tub of Edy&#39;s (or a case of Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s) and some iced mint tea... <br /><br />Oh, sorta OT.

All you wanted to know about kolaches in Texas, including some info about the little town of West:<br />http://www.texasmonthly.com/food/kolache/<br /><br />Reading this (plus all the little pictures of them) made me want a kolache something fierce. Does anyplace in the NYC area sell these little gems?<br /><br />And Michelle, if you ever attempt to make these, I will SO be your helper in exchange for the privledge of stuffing my face.&nbsp; :mrgreen:
