				Has anyone else living around Ditmars noticed the increasing frequency of a sewage smell infecting the air?&nbsp; Sometimes it&#39;s very subtle and others it&#39;s downright offensive.&nbsp; Last weekend I was riding my bike around and came across a small baseball field near the water and the smell was so strong that I started gagging.&nbsp; I can&#39;t imagine what it was like for the poor folks trying to play ball out there.<br /><br />It seems to be getting worse from week to week, and I&#39;m sure that summer&#39;s hot air will not bode well for the smell subsiding.<br /><br />Does anyone here know the cause of this, and if it&#39;s due to some kind of pollution or industrial actions, is there anything that can be done about it?

				Yeah.&nbsp; I&#39;ve noticed it too.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been up by Ditmars for over 2 years, and a few weeks ago was the first time I really noticed it.&nbsp; I hope the sanitation dept. can resolve it.&nbsp; It&#39;s particularly offensive at night, I&#39;ve noticed.

				I&#39;ve been noticing it too, and it has been around for more than just a few weeks. I noticed it a few months back when there was a particularly strong wind from the north. I kept checking the bottoms of my shoes because I was convinced that I had stepped in something.<br /><br />This can&#39;t be healthy, and it&#39;s becoming a pretty strong reason to move. Sure, there&#39;s air pollution everywhere, but how often does it smell like sewage? We won&#39;t be able to keep our windows open in the summer or go for walks around the neighborhood if this continues.

				I smell it when I go walking up in Astoria Park. Or rather, the extension of it along the water that goes all the way up to the power plant. I only really smell it during those last 10 blocks or so, and some times I smell it, others I don&#39;t. I&#39;m sure it has something to do with the direction of the wind. <br /><br />Is that the same thing or is that power-plant related? I remember thinking it would probably suck to live up there if it smelled like that all the time.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-(

				I first noticed this smell &nbsp;2 &nbsp;summers ago, &nbsp;when I lived over on 23rd Ave and 32nd street.<br />Always late in the evening in the summer. And I would need to close my bedroom window because the smell was <strong>so </strong> strong and toxic. And Nobody else ever noticed it though.<br />&nbsp;One day bike riding, I came to a baseball field along the water and noticed the smell there as well, just like&nbsp; beedee said, but I couldn&#39;t tell what it was coming from. I wonder if this is where the sewage treatment lanseaux describes is. It&#39;s in the vicinity of LaGuardia.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;It smells so toxic, I can&#39;t imagine this is safe. &nbsp;Maybe it&#39;s badsmelling but harmless?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

				I&#39;ve been noticing the smell too, it&#39;s more pronounced in the morning, and more obvious as you approach the Ditmars area. To me it&#39;s smells a bit like a bug that gets zapped, or a fly that burns when it falls inside a lighting fixture. <br /><br />I was wondering what the origin was, I just knew it wasn&#39;t something that was healthy to the environment. Some mornings I open my window only to close it right away because of the smell.&nbsp; :x&nbsp;

				This ran in today&#39;s NY Post.<br /><br />BIG WHIFF OF ANGER <br /><br />&nbsp;By ANGELA MONTEFINISE <br /><br />&nbsp;May 13, 2006 -- This place stinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;That&#39;s what furious Queens residents are saying about a city sewage-treatment plant in Astoria that&#39;s been emitting an &quot;intolerable&quot; stench for months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&quot;It smells like 20 dogs took a dump in my yard,&quot; said Nick Arakas, 35, who lives two blocks from the plant. &quot;You can&#39;t keep your windows open. You can&#39;t stay out more than a minute. I have a 3-year-old, and my wife doesn&#39;t take him outside.&quot; <br /><br />&nbsp;The city has been aware of the problem since November, when the plant&#39;s boilers - which heat sludge and reduce odors - were destroyed in a fire. <br /><br />&nbsp; But it has taken months to order parts and prepare for the repair, and a contractor defaulted on the project, said Charles Sturken, a spokesman for the city Department of Environmental Protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&quot;How long are we supposed to wait?&quot; asked Sandra Martin, 55, who lives near the plant. &quot;It&#39;s been months already. &quot; <br /><br />&nbsp;Sturken said the boilers would be fixed in the next month.&nbsp;

				Okay, now I have smelled it -- all the way down at 30th AVE! I thought maybe I was hallucinating it because I&#39;d been reading about you guys complaining about it. But I smelled it when I got off the train tonight, then went into Key Foods and when I came back out, it was really clear, and really there: it smelled like poo. Guess maybe it was the direction of the wind?<br /><br />Anyway, if I can smell it way down here, I really feel for you guys in &#39;uptown&#39; Astoria.&nbsp; :-(

				Just got off the phone with Vallone&#39;s office.&nbsp; Apparently he&#39;s pretty pissed about the smell himself, as his office is right in the thick of it.&nbsp; He has been hounding the EPA to resolve the issue ASAP.&nbsp; The woman I spoke with said the smell will be gone within 2 weeks.&nbsp; They are waiting for new boilers to arrive and go back online to, yes, heat up the waste, which gets rid of the smell.<br /><br />So, 2 weeks more...

				http://www.greeknewsonline.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=4953<br /><br />New York.- Astoria residents were not pleased to find that the aromas wafting from the dozens of eateries in the neighborhood have recently been replaced by a stench emanating from a sewage treatment plant on Berrien Avenue, state Assemblyman Michael Gianaris (D- Astoria) said Tuesday.<br /><br />The assemblyman, who said he could smell the odor as far as 78th Street near LaGuardia Airport, said there was a malfunction at the Astoria plant in November, during which a fire destroyed some of its boilers. He said there has been no contingency plan to deal with the emissions and that the boilers still have not been repaired. <br />&quot;It is like a giant stink bomb exploded in the neighborhood,&quot; he said. <br /><br />In a letter sent to Emily Lloyd, Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, Assemblyman Gianaris stated: <br /><br />Dear Ms. Lloyd,<br />I write regarding a situation that concerns the sewage-treatment plant located in Astoria as it relates to the residents living in the nearby community. <br /><br />Recently, as the New York Post reported in a May 13th 2006 article, noxious odors have been emanating from the sewage-treatment plant located on Berrien Avenue in Astoria causing a number of residents to contact me regarding the disturbing stench. As a resident of the area, I personally observed the stench and can attest to its foulness and detrimental effect to the community. <br /><br />While I understand that the odors are caused by the destruction of odor reducing equipment in a November 29th 2005 fire, there has been no contingency plan initiated to deal with the odor emitting sewage. Now, the odor is more potent than ever and is threatening the quality of life in our western Queens community. <br /><br />The smell is too much to bear for western Queens residents, who already suffer from the many industrial facilities located in our neighborhood. The pollution emitted from local power plants already makes breathing difficult. The last thing we need is this rotten stench as well. <br /><br />Accordingly, I ask that you make every attempt to remedy the situation as soon as possible. <br /><br />I appreciate any assistance you could provide regarding this situation. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please call me if you have any questions”. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				Well, as said elsewhere, Astoria has the dirtiest streets in Queens (according to stats published by the mayor&#39;s office) but when we try to discuss it here conversations shift to ... bakery smells!!<br /><br />So you were promised that the sewage plant&nbsp;&#39;problem&#39; would be solved --&nbsp; was the problem taken care of?&nbsp; <br /><br />Hey, maybe its Donald Rumsfeld&#39;s fault. Money spent in Iraq instead of Astoria&#39;s infrastructure (despite the great efforts by our local elected officials to keep our taxes stateside.) :x<br /><br />

				I still smell the sewage pretty regularly. It gets worse late at night.. not sure why that would be, but it is something I&#39;ve noticed. Every few nights I have to burn candles in my room just to get rid of the sewage smell.

				There are all different smells. Coming from the East River is the odor of warm garbage from the sanitation switching point on Randall&#039;s (or is it Ward&#039;s?) Island.&nbsp; Coming from the area by the Elm-Jac little league fields near Rikers is the sewage stank.&nbsp; And of course, coming from Con Ed, the smell of bullshit.

				I&#039;m confused here.&nbsp; What does low tide smell like and what does it come from?&nbsp; What I smell is - for lack of a better word - poop.&nbsp; Now I know poop is natural, but I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s what Megc meant, and if it&#039;s what low tide smells like.&nbsp; Is the smell &quot;poop&quot; because of low tide, or does low tide just smell like poop but it&#039;s not poop?<br /><br />I smelled it this morning too, and if I have to smell this every morning, I don&#039;t know if I want to run anymore.&nbsp; It&#039;s nauseating.

				I smell this rank smell driving by laguardia on non-windy evenings. I always thought that it was a lack of movement in the water and the stink was just building up. Isn&#039;t there also a sewage plant across from the park?<br /><br />I love new york, and I&quot;m not ready to say that we live on a toxic waste planet, but when this smell rolls in, I run into the house and close the windows.

				I may be thinking of a totally different smell.&nbsp; The low tide smell has to do with the mud, salt water, algae dying because of the high nitrogen levels...it&#039;s very earthy yet acrid, and smells vaguely like the sea.&nbsp; That is not what I would consider poop to smell like.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never felt nauseated from that low tide smell.&nbsp; My guess is that the smell you&#039;re referring to is coming from the sewage treatment further east; I once caught a whiff last summer while walking east on 23rd Ave - it really DID smell like 100 dogs had crapped in the yard next to me!&nbsp; Truly nasty.&nbsp; I ran down by the park this morning and didn&#039;t smell anything bad.&nbsp; I don&#039;t run right up against the water, though, on the concrete (concrete bad for megc&#039;s knees).&nbsp; Maybe my nose was protected where I was?&nbsp; I dunno.&nbsp; I did have to cut it short because it was too cold and I had no hat on.&nbsp; Stupid pseudo-winter temperatures.&nbsp; :x

I know the poop smell of which you speak, I think its from the sewage treatment plant. Its super pungent, and I&#039;ve occasionally smelled it &quot;inland&quot;, like around Steinway Street. Usually, low tide smell is only noticeable if you&#039;re right near the water, and it doesn&#039;t last for very long because, well, tides change. (I live further from the water now than when I was a kid, and I never smelled low tide at my parent&#039;s place, so that&#039;s my super non-scientific explanation.)<br /><br />I kind of wish computers had smell-o-vision so I could demonstrate what low tide smells like. (or, on preview, what meg said about mud, salt water, etc. But smell-o-vision would still be fun :) )

				Yup,&nbsp; it must be different then.&nbsp; Thanks for clearing that up for me!&nbsp; I do run near the water from 19th Ave to the park, and then in the park.&nbsp; I smell the poop smell closer to the water, but I have smelled it all over Astoria on some days.&nbsp; If there&#039;s a sewage treatment plant right there, I guess that&#039;s what it is.&nbsp; I wonder if the sewage empties into the water.....
