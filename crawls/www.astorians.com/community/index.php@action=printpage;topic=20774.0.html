				I&#039;m surprised no one has mentioned this place yet. I&#039;m lurv with it--tiny little Moroccan-French cafe with hip jazz and a very sweet chef-owner. The menu is crazy cheap for what it is (organic eggs!). His omelette with french fries and merguez is genius--it&#039;s open face, and the fries are scattered on top, kind of cooked in to the omelette. Also, the brik are delish--nice Moroccan-spiced meat in crispy-fried phyllo. Everything else I&#039;ve had has been really yummy too.<br /><br />Oh AND: the guy sells Balthazar croissants and baguettes!&nbsp; (Truly, this is the real reason I&#039;m lobbying for him--it is freakin&#039; fantastic to have a source for great French bread and pastry right around the corner from me, and I&#039;d cry if he closed.)<br /><br />The only drag is that he doesn&#039;t open till 10am, so you can&#039;t cruise by early for a croissant. But he&#039;s open way late into the evening usually.

				Tried this place out last weekend.&nbsp; We got the lamb tagine and a chicken kebab sandwich and everything was terrific.&nbsp; The lamb tagine was part of their daily special that included soup, salad and bourek.&nbsp; The bourek was very unique with eggs and steak.&nbsp; The soup was a choice between lentil and chicken.&nbsp; We chose the chicken and it was rustic and really hit the spot.&nbsp; The lamb tagine was also very homestyle with peas and two plump artichokes.&nbsp; It was an excellent dish, especially for the price.<br /><br />It&#039;s a tiny place and even though there&#039;s some nice jazz playing, there isn&#039;t much ambiance.&nbsp; Service was prompt and kind.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a link to their yelp reviews:<br /><br />http://www.yelp.com/biz/harissa-queens<br /><br />And here&#039;s a link to their menu through seamless:<br /><br />http://www.seamlessweb.com/food-delivery/Harissa-Cafe-NY-Metro.16681.r<br /><br />Great cafe food at a very affordable price. :mrgreen:

				I have been following Harass since they opened last year and it is one of my favorite spots around my place.&nbsp; Their chicken soup is superb, the lamb is nice tender and the lamb couscous platter is my preferred choice, light, nutritious and healthy.&nbsp; The manager has brought a genuine&nbsp; taste to the area and the jazz music puts a good note on the atmosphere.&nbsp; Give it a try and don&#039;t underestimate the place bc of its size, the food makes it all !&nbsp; &nbsp; :mrgreen:
