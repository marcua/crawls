				Funny, people always talk about shopping at mom &amp; pop stores and supporting small businesses, but no one wants to pay the prices that smaller business need to charge to make a profit. <br /><br /><br />There are plenty of small, independent pharmacies in the neighborhood that have survived, even as Rite Aid, Duane Reade, and CVS have sprouted up all over the place.

				It&#039;s really hard for a small business to stay open from morning till night because it means paying two shifts of people. If they close early and open early or open late and close late, that means the owner (which it usually is in small businesses) or the one or two employees can work the whole shift. Finding someone to come in and work for a few hours to make one long shift and one short one to cover the hours it would take to be open from 9-9 (one 8 hour shift and one 4 hour shift) is hard. Staffing a small business and figuring out schedules is not easy.

I called her emergency number and asked if she could call in a prescription to Crescent Apothecary.&nbsp; Well she did that and within an hour I had my antibiotics.&nbsp; The pharmacist is a very nice guy who gets to know your name and says hello and your name when you walk in.&nbsp; Now I see why having this pharmacy close to where I live is a very good thing.&nbsp; I had 101 fever and it would have been difficult for me to walk to CVS.&nbsp; Also, this pharmacy delivers.&nbsp; They are a welcome addition to the neighborhood.&nbsp; Also I would like to say that many times I see he is open later than 7, which is the closing time during the week.

				As AB described the pharmacist is the owner he had plan to turn it in&nbsp; pharmacy from two years and gave a notice to the previous owner. They do carry more individual brands than CVS and the owner can make arrangements.<br />I find the CVS on Ditmars to lack&nbsp; most of what other CVS in Manhattan carry. CVS&nbsp; in ditmars also has a monopoly and bought Rite Aid on&nbsp; other side of the road which explains the&nbsp; prices/lack of items and lack of competition.
