				My wife, my dog, and I are looking to move to the Broadway/30th Ave area.&nbsp; After doing some research, I&#039;ve concluded that I need to find a 2 bedroom apartment for $1500~$1700.&nbsp; We&#039;re looking for something over 750sq ft and a Feb 1 start date.&nbsp; Do you think it&#039;s possible that we&#039;ll find something like this or are we dreaming?<br /><br />Also, we&#039;d REALLY prefer a laundry machine within the facility.&nbsp; Are laundry-inclusive apartments a common amenity in Astoria or is it more rare?<br /><br />I&#039;m looking to call Amorelli and Neon realty companies by end of week to see if they can help me find something.&nbsp; Can anyone else recommend another awesome broker?

				I&#039;ve been reading through the posts and it&#039;s actually pretty tough to find all of the info aggregated, I figured I&#039;d try and summarize and blog my experience.&nbsp; Feel free to reply or post comments.<br /><br />Info about me: Married couple + 1 10lb dog moving from Manhattan to Astoria<br /><br />Move in date: Feb 1<br /><br />Working with the following brokers/realty companies:<br /><br />Chantal @ Aaman<br />Mike @ Astoria Park<br />Manny(?) @ Neon<br />Aura(?) @ Amorelli<br />Chris @ Millenium<br />Kim @ Halvatzis<br />Maria @ Century 21<br /><br />First Impressions: All brokers seem to be pretty good so far.&nbsp; The poorest impression I got over the phone was from Neon, who seemed a little bit &quot;old school&quot; and pushy.&nbsp; But he did ask all of the right questions.<br /><br />I was also told by a couple of brokers that because I have a dog, finding an apartment in the Broadway/30th Ave area would be tough because most landlords don&#039;t like pets over there.<br /><br />This has me a little bit concerned, especially since my dog is very well-trained and never goes to the bathroom in the apartment unless it&#039;s a true emergency, in which case he&#039;s trained to only go in the bathtub.<br /><br />Anyway, that&#039;s all I have for now.&nbsp; My wife and I will be walking around the neighborhood on Saturday looking for &quot;For Rent by Owners&quot; signs.<br /><br />Until then...

				Also, I was told just now that finding an apartment that allows pets in the area I want is only doable with a starting price at $1,800.&nbsp; I wonder if this is true or just something brokers say to jack up the price...<br /><br />To be continued...

				People in Astoria (especially Greek landlords) don&#039;t want pets.&nbsp; It&#039;s basically a fact of life with a pet (especially a dog) in Astoria that you are going to pay a premium to find a nice place that allows pets.&nbsp; As an owner of two medium sized dogs, believe me, I know.<br /><br />Good luck finding a place!

				I would say that the pet issue also goes beyond how the animal is trained.&nbsp; It can be much more work to clean an apartment after animals have lived on the premises...

				OK, so this whole process has gotten me a little bummed to say the least.&nbsp; The dog is proving to be a back-breaker.&nbsp; There are actually tons of availabilities in the exact size, price, location, everything that I&#039;m looking at.&nbsp; But they don&#039;t take dogs and there&#039;s nothing I can do to convince them otherwise.<br /><br />I actually had a pretty lengthy talk with George at Halvatzis Realty yesterday.&nbsp; He seems to be a very honest and experienced guy.&nbsp; Anyway, he said that landlords only now are starting to warm up to the idea of a dog and it&#039;s only because they know they can get away with charging more rent trying to take advantage of Manhattaners moving into the area.&nbsp; This mentality is more prevalent among the newer generation of landlords as the older generation is still fixated on renting to local Queens residents who typically don&#039;t have dogs.&nbsp; (What can I say?&nbsp; Perhaps more Manhattaners have pets because they are more lonely and most have no families in the area?)&nbsp; Either way, I understand both mentalities and don&#039;t necessarily appreciate Manhattaners (me included) &quot;gentrifying&quot; the area.&nbsp; I specifically love Queens (as opposed to Brooklyn) for its ethnic diversity and don&#039;t enjoy more &quot;yuppy&quot;-type settings.<br /><br />In general, units that I&#039;ve found in the Broadway/30th Ave area are much smaller and much more run down.&nbsp; Nothing seems to meet my space requirement and most of them don&#039;t take dogs anyway.&nbsp; Lastly, quite a few sources, including locals in the area, have informed me about a widespread bed bug infestation in this area that seems to be spreading rampantly.&nbsp; Yuck.<br /><br />Moving on: the units that I have found that will accept dogs that meet my criteria are REALLY far from the subway.&nbsp; The brokers keep telling me it&#039;s a &quot;10 minute walk.&quot;&nbsp; Well, I walked it several times.&nbsp; It&#039;s either the longest 10 minutes in history or it&#039;s closer to 20 minutes each way (according to my stop watch anyway).&nbsp; It&#039;s not so much of a concern for me, but my wife has got a really lengthy commute to her workplace in Manhattan in this case.&nbsp; She tells me she&#039;ll be fine with it, but I know she&#039;s saying that to make me feel better.&nbsp; I found one unit that fits all my criteria except distance to transportation (15 minute walk) but it&#039;s smack dab next to Con Ed, which makes me feel very very uneasy.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I can in good conscience say that I feel comfortable staring at smoke stacks out of my window especially when I work from home and will have to look at it all day long.&nbsp; On a side note: I don&#039;t want to freak anybody out, but I did some research on the Con Ed plant and it&#039;s actually a little bit frightening.&nbsp; Not only does it generate tons of electricity and blatantly violate all air pollution standards (by a lot), but it also is a storage and transfer hub for highly dangerous and hazardous toxic waste material.&nbsp; You can read all about the local government petitions to reduce this activity (to no avail) online.&nbsp; I somehow think that if I lived on the east side of 31st Ave, I can have some more peace of mind because I don&#039;t have to look at it 24/7 (ignorance is bliss, right?).<br /><br />It&#039;s also important to note that landlords seem to be adamant about staying firm with their pricing +/- $50 per month.&nbsp; They don&#039;t think the economic recession will affect their property (and pricing) or at least are taking a very conservative &quot;wait and see&quot; approach.&nbsp; I&#039;ve run into quite a few owners who would rather have a vacant space, in some cases for a couple of months now, hoping to rent it at a much higher price.&nbsp; I even ran into an owner who seemingly wanted to get in a fight when I asked him about how long the listing had been on the market.&nbsp; Not only was he ultra defensive about the price and vacancy, he immediately retorted with the fact that he &quot;takes great care&quot; of the unit, has his own set of bills to pay, and &quot;doesn&#039;t want to rent it out anyway.&quot;&nbsp; He forced upon an application that he basically filled out by himself on behalf of me (although I never said I wanted the unit, especially because it was too small and more expensive than I thought it was worth by at least $300/mo) and told me to go home and fax it back to him that night.<br /><br />I&#039;ve started to re-think my strategy a little bit and am considering staying in Manhattan now.&nbsp; 1) There are significantly more places that allow dogs -- again, this has really proven to be the biggest obstacle in my search thus far.&nbsp; 2) There are some pretty great deals out there with tons of wiggle room to negotiate as brokers tell me it&#039;s an &quot;extremely soft market.&quot;&nbsp; 3)&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for distance to transportation that&#039;s &quot;reasonable&quot; so that my wife can more easily commute to work.&nbsp; In order to save money, I&#039;m considering living on the Upper East Side (ugh, that&#039;s always been absolutely the last place in NYC that I want to live) and doing a reverse commute to Astoria to do all of my grocery shopping and dining.&nbsp; Of course, and I say this with all sincerity, this leaves me extremely heartbroken.&nbsp; My wife and I have been really excited about the move for some time now, we&#039;ve spent a lot of time getting to know the neighborhoods.<br /><br />That being said, I will continue looking in Astoria earnestly until the 22nd.&nbsp; I know a lot more listings are coming up after the 15th, so I&#039;m encouraged by that.&nbsp; I know that there are tons of listings out there that fit my criteria.&nbsp; Again, it&#039;s the @#%^!# dog (I somehow find myself secretly and ashamedly resenting the poor fella more so everyday).&nbsp; If I don&#039;t find something by the 22nd, I will probably resort to staying in Manhattan.<br /><br />I also thought I should mention that I have, indeed, met the gamut of Brokers.<br /><br />Kim at Halvatzis is decent so far and is willing to take the time to listen.<br /><br />I just called Richard at R&amp;R and he seems to be responsive.<br /><br />I met a woman at Page who seemed to be awesome except she didn&#039;t have any listings.<br /><br />Mike at Astoria Park is definitely a little pushy and tries to get you to pull the trigger on an impulse buy.<br /><br />Jenny at Avangard tends to bend the truth quite a bit.&nbsp; She tells a bunch of &quot;white lies&quot; to convince you to go with her.<br /><br />I called Eleni but worked with her partner, Carl, instead.&nbsp; He is by far the most arrogant, completely egotistical broker that I&#039;ve ever met.&nbsp; It&#039;s funny because I never thought I&#039;d say this: to top it all off, he smells really bad and his car wreaks of stale, greasy takeout.&nbsp; He should definitely consider losing weight because his car is about to cave in when he drives; I don&#039;t think cars of that size can handle that type of capacity.&nbsp; Oh, if you ever meet him, he&#039;ll also go on and on about his &quot;glory days&quot; as a top level executive at various Fortune 100 companies, his ability to sell you sand in a desert, and he&#039;ll also try and pry as much personal info from you as possible.&nbsp; Seriously, what a sleeze.<br /><br />Chris, Orly, Chantal, Marie, and Laurie never got back to me with a listing, so either I can&#039;t comment on them or it says something about their service.

				I told myself I&#039;d take a break today so I&#039;m canceling all of my appointments.&nbsp; I&#039;ve basically been going from viewing to viewing for 6-8 hours a day now for the past 5 days so it&#039;s starting to wear a little on me, especially since commuting back and forth has been a real strain (I live all the way downtown in Soho right now, so riding the N/R/W line has never felt longer).&nbsp; <br /><br />Carl&#039;s partner called today and I told her: &quot;I&#039;d rather give my broker fee to a guy on the street than to her partner.&quot;&nbsp; She apologized and said that she appreciated the feedback.&nbsp; She asked if I&#039;d consider working with her and I told her that I would as long as Carl doesn&#039;t receive a dime of my money if I choose to rent through her.<br /><br />I saw two decent places last night both in the Ditmars area.&nbsp; There&#039;s one place under construction.&nbsp; They&#039;re asking $1,800 with no utilities included (I have to pay for heat, water, gas, and electric).&nbsp; It&#039;s located close to Ditmars and pretty close to the subway, which is cool.&nbsp; But there&#039;s a very VERY small kitchen.&nbsp; When I say small, I mean you can&#039;t stand in the kitchen and cook at the same time.&nbsp; You literally have to stand outside of the kitchen to use the stove.&nbsp; It&#039;s kind of funny but if you open the refrigerator door, you can&#039;t be in the kitchen at all.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think the owner thought about the logistics of the layout.&nbsp; Oh well.<br /><br />The other place has a HUGE kitchen, the biggest one I&#039;ve ever seen in Astoria and has OK sized room, including a so-so sized living room (definitely on the smaller side).&nbsp; But it has zero closets, not a single one.&nbsp; And it has the ugliest, most depressing carpeting that I&#039;ve ever seen throughout the entire apartment.&nbsp; In order for this to work, I&#039;d have to turn the smaller bedroom that I&#039;d otherwise use as an office into a closet.&nbsp; The bathroom is located in the kitchen.&nbsp; There are no light fixtures at all, meaning that the room can only be lit using lamps plugged into the wall, which isn&#039;t the end of the world.&nbsp; It&#039;s located across the street from two abandoned buildings.&nbsp; Yay.&nbsp; It&#039;s also 15 minutes to the subway, which is fine.&nbsp; By default, I think this is probably my best bet thus far.<br /><br />Overall thoughts thus far: it&#039;s been so long since I&#039;ve looked for an apartment that I forgot how stressful the entire process is.&nbsp; I find myself constantly doubting whether I&#039;ll ever find anything decent or if I&#039;m better off just staying put.&nbsp; Sometimes at viewings, I get wrapped up and obsessed with a place even if it sucks.&nbsp; Only a day later can I objectify the unit and look at it from a more realistic perspective.<br /><br />For example, last night I was ready to put my money down on the unit with the tiny kitchen.&nbsp; I really had convinced myself that we would be living there.&nbsp; In fact, I think I was ready to put in an application even though the unit was still under construction and was at least 2 weeks at best from being done.&nbsp; I&#039;m not even sure if it will be ready in time, quite honestly.&nbsp; I talked about it with my wife for a while and she told me that I needed to take a step back and relax.&nbsp; This morning, I realized that that unit just makes no sense.&nbsp; I cook a lot.&nbsp; Part of the reason we&#039;re moving to Astoria is to save money.&nbsp; And the only way to do that is to eat at home.&nbsp; So if I&#039;m going to cook a lot (which I will be), then it only makes sense to have a place where the kitchen is at least usable.<br /><br />Anyway, it&#039;s nice to be taking a day off.&nbsp; It will certainly give me some perspective on the whole process and situation.

				Oh, I will comment on this:<br /><br />The pricing in Astoria doesn&#039;t seem to be all that advantageous at all especially when compared to a soft Manhattan market.<br /><br />Asking prices for 1 bedrooms in decent areas in Manhattan run the same price as small two bedrooms that require a hike to get to the subway in Astoria (due to having a pet).<br /><br />Astoria landlords are staying firm with their high prices while Manhattan landlords are willing to negotiate as much as 20% off a month&#039;s rent.&nbsp; Think about it: that&#039;s a LOT of wiggle room.<br /><br />Reasons to stay in Manhattan (1 bedroom):<br />Most places accept pets (and don&#039;t charge/want something extra)<br />Building and units are maintained very well and they usually come with a lot more amenities<br />Landlords are desperate for tenants<br />Easy access to transportation<br /><br />Reasons to move out to Astoria (2 bedroom):<br />Significantly lower cost of living -&nbsp; markets, living necessities, everything is cheaper by about 50%, which definitely makes a difference.<br />Larger space (by about 100 to 200 sq ft)<br /><br />So my set of trade offs seems to be this: take a much nicer, smaller place that has much better location or a bigger place with a lot longer commute (because I have a pet) but I get to reduce my cost of living.<br /><br />Also, just to make it clear: if I were to stay in Manhattan I&#039;d try and shop at cheaper areas by reverse commuting to Queens, so it&#039;s a bigger hassle but I can still save money this way.<br /><br />The answers don&#039;t seem that obvious once I lay it out like that.

				I have to say that it&#039;s refreshing to see someone who wants so badly to be an Astorian for more reasons than financial.&nbsp; I hope that you are able to find something soon!<br /><br />That said, I know it&#039;s not the best option in the world but have you looked at the Acropolis on Ditmars?&nbsp; I know a lot of people have dogs there and there are some decent apartments to be had there, just depends on the individual owner.&nbsp; It may at least be an option to get you out of your current lease and allow you to look for your dream apartment at a slower pace if you found a place there that does a month-to-month lease.<br /><br />Also, check out the Pistilli property near Astoria Park (Pistilli Riverview East).&nbsp; I think you are allowed to have dogs there.&nbsp; While it&#039;s been surrounded by &quot;controversy&quot; for years a friend of mine has a fantastic loft there and seems to be happy living there.<br /><br />Just a couple of suggestions.&nbsp; Good luck on your search and an early &quot;Welcome to the Hood!&quot;

				I really have nothing to add/offer (I&#039;ve always lived in roommate situations, never dealt with a broker), but thanks for sharing all of this. It really makes me think wether I want to get my &quot;own place&quot; after all (when I can afford to, which who knows when that&#039;ll be :) ).<br /><br />But...from my friends who have done the broker thing....it really seems like it&#039;s just a matter of luck/timing. You only need to see one good place. Sure, you might see 50 bad places first, but you just need that one good place. And they&#039;re out there!<br /><br />(Sort of on-, sort of off-topic: I was talking to a neighbor at my laundromat a few weeks ago, and she told me that the new buildings up Steinway from us (near the corner of 20th Ave, a 15-20 minute walk to the N) were 1BR apartments for $3,000. I was all&nbsp; :-o She could have been mistaken/exaggerating, but gah. And no wonder they seem mostly vacant, despite having been completed over a year ago.)

				I can&#039;t believe they want that much money for those apartments.&nbsp; It&#039;s not near transportation at all.&nbsp; And I don&#039;t consider the Steinway street bus transportation - it seems like it runs every half hour.

				I spent the day looking for apartments in Manhattan today just for the sake of price comparison.&nbsp; I figured it&#039;d be a good idea to see how Astoria&#039;s market is impacted if at all by Manhattan&#039;s and took a look at some units within my price range.&nbsp; As it turns out, Manhattan&#039;s market really is very soft and the units that are available are actually top notch when compared to the things I&#039;ve seen in Astoria.&nbsp; Although asking prices in Manhattan are still very high, landlords have actually catered to me (gasp!) and are tenacious with their follow up to try and rent to me.<br /><br />Starting at the top:<br /><br />I met with a Citi Habitats broker today, Norm, who said that the Manhattan market is literally dead.&nbsp; There is little if any movement and inventory of apartments is at an all time high.&nbsp; He can&#039;t remember the last time he had so many units.&nbsp; Nor can he recall any transactions that he&#039;s done in the past couple of months.&nbsp; He was extremely flexible with his broker fee as well, citing as low as $800 if I do indeed find something I like.&nbsp; Clearly, the days of 20% of annual rent are over.<br /><br />When I later called up another broker, Stalin (what were his parents thinking with that name?), he told me that this year he had made one placement in Queens, one in Brooklyn, and zero in Manhattan.&nbsp; It&#039;s obvious that everybody in Manhattan is getting out.<br /><br />I saw two places, both 1 bedrooms, that had good space.&nbsp; One was located in the 60s, the other in the 80s, both on the Upper East Side.&nbsp; One was almost a 1.5 bedroom, as a matter of fact.&nbsp; Both units had an asking price of $1,900, which if you&#039;ve been following my adventures, is out of my price range.&nbsp; I asked if the owners were flexible with price and I got a very quick &quot;Oh yea, you can submit an application with whatever number you want and they&#039;re willing to work with you.&quot;&nbsp; I asked how long the apartment&#039;s been on market.&nbsp; Their response: &quot;Over 6 weeks.&quot;&nbsp; Not ever have I heard of a unit in prime &quot;entry level yuppyland&quot; been on market for 2 weeks nevermind 6 weeks.&nbsp; Each unit was 600 sq feet or more.&nbsp; One was on the second floor, the other on the third.&nbsp; Both were pet friendly and had a full kitchen (albeit small stove), closets, and a decent bathroom.<br /><br />Aside from working with brokers, I also did quite a bit of walking in the area, which was good because I found a lot of &quot;For Rent&quot; signs but bad because it was soooooo freakin freezing cold.&nbsp; In fact, all of the ink in my pens froze and I had a hard time writing information down.&nbsp; But I did end up calling a good number of these people.&nbsp; Half the time I got brokers, but the other half were indeed owners and/or the management company.&nbsp; Never in my life have I felt this much like a VIP, especially with landlords.&nbsp; I must have heard the phrase &quot;We have BEAUTIFUL granite counters&quot; over 20 times.&nbsp; I had landlords chasing me down, taking down my phone number, sending pictures to my email address, trying everything in their power to convince me to move into their units.&nbsp; Of course, a lot of them were over my price range and the ones that were in my range were way too small (300 sq feet).&nbsp; But that being said, a lot of them have promised me that they&#039;ll follow up in the morning to see what else they have.&nbsp; And these are the landlords!&nbsp; Not the brokers!&nbsp; WOW.<br /><br />Of course, some of these places I inquired about gave me a really snooty attitude.&nbsp; &quot;Our 1 bedrooms start at $3,500, sir.&quot;&nbsp; That was a lady at a management office of an old, semi-run down doorman building.&nbsp; My response: &quot;Well, of course you&#039;re entitled to ask for whatever price you want.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;ll get it,&quot; I would say.&nbsp; In general, I saw quite a few units today.&nbsp; Everyone was very courteous to me and I think deep down they all wanted my business very badly although it&#039;s hard to tell for sure since no one wants to seem desperate.<br /><br />Jenny from Avanguard called back today as well.&nbsp; She had showed my wife and me an apartment that I didn&#039;t mention earlier because we had a fundamental conflict with the landlords.&nbsp; Not only were they smug, but at the viewing they had told us that we would get the apartment &quot;as is&quot; without renovations.&nbsp; It was very large 2 bedroom unit, but the catch was that they were unwilling to put any work into it after a couple of girls had moved out and left the place a little bit run down, including holes all over the walls, and a ton of rust on a refrigerator that was falling apart.&nbsp; Also, the unit is located in a part of Astoria that I&#039;m not familiar with.&nbsp; In fact, I still don&#039;t know the address of that place because we saw it so late at night and it was a hike from the R train, a part of Queens that I haven&#039;t done my homework on.&nbsp; Regardless, Jenny informed me that the landlords &quot;liked us so much and really wanted us as their tenants that they&#039;ve agreed to paint the walls and lower the price by $50/month.&quot;&nbsp; That&#039;s great and all, I&#039;m very grateful, but I still don&#039;t know the location.&nbsp; This weekend I&#039;ll take another look at that unit and figure out if it&#039;s in a doable area.&nbsp; If it is, it will certainly come down to a nice, large 2 bedroom in Astoria-ish area or a decent 1 bedroom on the Upper East Side.<br /><br />As of right now, I&#039;m still leaning towards Upper East Side because it&#039;s what I know and the quality of apartment in terms of renovation and construction is very high.&nbsp; But if everything is good with the 2 bedroom, then I&#039;ll certainly consider that as well.&nbsp; Of course, it&#039;d help a lot if the 2 bedroom was actually in an area that I had originally wanted...<br /><br />Deep down, I know that if I had found the 1 bedroom unit that I saw today but in Astoria for a reasonable price ($1,400 ~ $1,500 or thereabouts), I would have jumped on it in a heartbeat.&nbsp; Instead, I&#039;ve seen a whole bunch of small, run down units with terrible maintenance for $1,600+, which is just a silly deal, in my opinion, especially when I think I can get a much better unit in Manhattan for roughly the same price.<br /><br />To be continued...

				If you continue to look in Astoria, check out the east side of Steinway St (if you haven&#039;t already) south of Astoria Blvd.&nbsp; Rents are generally somewhat cheaper and it might feel a bit out of the way... but it&#039;s worth it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived in a couple of places that were closer to stops on the R/V line (Steinway St &amp; 46th St) but were still close enough to use the N/W when coming home from Manhattan and wanting to shop for dinner on 30th Ave.&nbsp; There&#039;s also the added bonus that when one train line isn&#039;t working you can easily get to the other line.&nbsp; <br /><br />If I was going to settle for a place that was a haul from the train I&#039;d make sure I was spitting distance to Astoria Park.&nbsp; I think that&#039;s a decent trade. <br /><br />It&#039;s a bummer that Astoria landlords are living in 2007 - but also a bummer that people are moving in and paying these ridiculous prices!!!<br /><br />Good luck with the hunt.&nbsp;

				The Steinway Street bus (the Q101) is actually pretty ok. It runs every 10-15 minutes during the morning/evening rush, every 15ish minutes outside of that during the week. Once every half hour on weekends, and once an hour late nights. Schedule here (http://mta.info/busco/schedules/q101cur.pdf) (pdf file).<br /><br />I know once every 20-30 minutes sounds like a long time, but if you know generally when you need to be at the bus stop, it&#039;s better than getting to the subway platform as a train pulls out of the station and having to wait for the next one.<br /><br />It never, ever, ever runs every 5 minutes. She was mistaken, or lying.<br /><br />BUT. I will say that it&#039;s very reliable (going southbound), and it&#039;s nice to have when I don&#039;t feel like walking to the N, since I live on Steinway. I can take it south to the R/V Broadway stop. The only time it didn&#039;t come when I was expecting it was during a snowstorm at 8pm on a Saturday evening. If you&#039;re going north, it&#039;s not as reliable since it has to come over the Queensboro Bridge, and there&#039;s frequently traffic. Northbound, I&#039;ll see no bus for over an hour, then a few back-to-back.<br /><br />(Also for current Astorians, if you&#039;re coming home from the city on a weekend night and have Q101 Queens-bound schedule in the back of your head, it&#039;s easy and SUPER quick to take the 101 from 2nd ave &amp; 58th. Screw those $25 cab rides! :) ) And if you miss it, you&#039;re right by the bridge, so the cab ride would also be on the cheap side/quick.)

				Here&#039;s my latest update:<br /><br />For the past couple of days I&#039;ve been looking for apartments exclusively in the Upper East Side, Manhattan.&nbsp; There are a ton of deals floating around.&nbsp; In fact, the deals are so good that people in other parts of Manhattan are voluntarily breaking their current lease to snatch up the massive price drops.&nbsp; Listings that easily were $2,500 a couple of months ago are now going for $1,900 with some wiggle room to bargain.&nbsp; In fact, my friends tell me that most of their friends who currently reside in Astoria are moving into Manhattan due to the rental market crash.&nbsp; It seems like quite a few people are really trying to capitalize on this opportunity to get into the city.<br /><br />That being said, I&#039;ve actually found something in the UES that I like.&nbsp; It is a 3rd floor, large 1 bedroom in the 80s on First Ave.&nbsp; It is roughly 700 sq feet with modern appliances and the entire unit is in pristine condition.&nbsp; The asking price is $1,900 although the broker said that the landlord is flexible and will most likely take $1,800.<br /><br />On the other hand, I&#039;ve also found something I like in Astoria just east of Steinway by Astoria Boulevard.&nbsp; It is a 2nd floor, large 1 bedroom, approximately 700 sq feet with modern appliances and the unit is in very good condition.&nbsp; AND it accepts pets!!!&nbsp; The asking price is $1,575 and the broker said that the landlord probably won&#039;t budge too much on the price.&nbsp; &nbsp;Herein lies my dilemma...<br /><br />Although you would think the UES apartment has a shorter commute to my wife&#039;s workplace, it really isn&#039;t that obvious.&nbsp; You have to walk 3 avenues over to Lexington (8~10 mins), take the train down to 51st Street (3~10 mins, depending on the wait), walk and switch to the N/W/R (3~10 mins, depending on the wait), and ride for another 4 stops (5~10 mins, depending on the wait).&nbsp; That&#039;s somewhere between 20~40 mins.&nbsp; Waiting for 2 trains can really throw off the commute time, and the 6 train is notoriously packed and slow.<br /><br />Meanwhile, living near Steinway means a solid 10~11 minute walk to the N/W and a 25 minute ride to her workplace.&nbsp; Although the commute at best will take 30~40 minutes, she&#039;ll only need to sit on one train.&nbsp; Because it&#039;s the second stop, it most likely will mean that she can sit as opposed to stand.<br /><br />So the difference is essentially $225 a month to live in UES vs Astoria.&nbsp; Living in UES means the so called &quot;prestige&quot; of being a Manhattaner, which I&#039;m not completely enamored with, and technically a shorter commute when there&#039;s no wait for the multiple trains.&nbsp; Living costs are of concern with Manhattan groceries getting out of control -- a small can of Starkist tuna in my neighborhood now costs $2.50, milk is now $5.69 for the &quot;generic&quot; brand.&nbsp; I have to admit that trading in the shorter commute for the $225/mo I pocket living in Astoria along with my living costs being reduced in half is very enticing.&nbsp; Also, swapping the &quot;yuppinized,&quot; UES restaurants for the authentic and ethnic dining in Astoria makes the choice even more compelling.<br /><br />We shall see...

				Deals that I know for a fact that I missed out on so far in Manhattan that I was interested in:<br /><br />Upper East Side<br />$1,945 - 700 sq foot 1.5 bedroom on 86th and 3rd Ave with fireplace and 2 huge closets, 4th floor elevator.&nbsp; The &quot;normal&quot; price for this unit, I was told, was $2,400.&nbsp; The unit rented at $1,900.<br /><br />$1,550 - 600 sq foot 1 bedroom on 84th and Lexington, 3rd floor walkup.&nbsp; The unit was a little older and had older appliances.<br /><br />Upper West Side:<br />$1,800 - 800 sq foot on 82nd between Amsterdam and Columbus.&nbsp; Did not accept dogs.&nbsp; Large 1 bedroom, 4 year old appliances, 3rd floor walkup.<br /><br />Union Square<br />$1,600 - 600 sq foot studio on 4th floor elevator.&nbsp; Modern appliances, 13th and 3rd Ave.<br /><br />Soho<br />$1,850 - 750 sq foot 1 bedroom in elevator on 6th Ave and Houston.<br /><br />There have been tons of availabilities overall, but these were worth mentioning so that others can monitor the rental situation in Manhattan.

				I agree that the N/W train is probably a lot nicer ride compared to the 6 train.&nbsp; By far, the 6 line has always been my most dreaded train for quite some time now.&nbsp; In fact, it is the sole reason why I&#039;ve historically avoided living in the east side of Manhattan for all these years.<br /><br />I think deep down my mind is already made up.&nbsp; I&#039;ve &quot;clocked out&quot; of being a Manhattaner for the past couple of years but have only waited till now to make the move.&nbsp; Last year around this time I was already looking for apartments.&nbsp; At that time, I was seriously considering moving to Sunnyside or Woodside, but the prices were so inflated back then I just couldn&#039;t justify it.&nbsp; I remember looking at a small 2 bedroom in far Woodside for $1,900 and that was a hike to the subway and relying on the notorious 7 train (my other least favorite train).&nbsp; This year was really &quot;Part II&quot; of &quot;Operation Get the Hell out of Manhattan&quot; so I hope I meet some success.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to take a walk on Steinway during the day today.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only seen it at night so far and it&#039;s always been very quiet, so I&#039;d like to see how lively it gets, but also acquaint myself with the laundry/gym/grocery situation there.&nbsp; If all goes well, I hope to report some good news.<br /><br />Also, I wanted to get a chance to report on my Manhattan broker experiences (listed from Best to Worst):<br /><br />Norm at Citi Habitats (Upper East Side) was amazing.&nbsp; Very respectful, quiet, and experienced.&nbsp; I&#039;d definitely love to work with him if I ever get a chance.<br /><br />Stalin at Citi Habitats (Upper East Side) was energetic, helpful, and fun.&nbsp; He also didn&#039;t give me any pressure.<br /><br />Steve at Fleet Realty only showed me one unit, a 5th floor walkup.&nbsp; He&#039;s in really good shape for a 69(!) year old guy who rides his bike to meet his clients.&nbsp; Bravo, Steve!<br /><br />Daniella and Beatrice and Manhattan Connections were respectful and attentive although they ultimately didn&#039;t show me anything that I wanted.&nbsp; In one situation, it got pretty embarrassing.&nbsp; Daniella couldn&#039;t find a building with address she had written down.&nbsp; Somehow, she kept saying that the building had miraculously &quot;disappeared&quot; when in reality she wrote the address down incorrectly.&nbsp; She didn&#039;t have her phone either so she couldn&#039;t confirm it with her office.&nbsp; On the next viewing, she took me to a building where the management company required her to call ahead of time to arrange for the Super to be there.&nbsp; Well, he wasn&#039;t.&nbsp; The sign outside said for brokers not to bother the tenants.&nbsp; She went ahead and rang every tenant&#039;s bell anyway and ended up getting into a shouting match with one of the tenants.&nbsp; They ultimately didn&#039;t let us in, so it was a waste of time and downright embarrassing.<br /><br />Rory at Key New York was an arrogant, conceited 20 year old who took jabs and insulted other brokers at every chance he got.&nbsp; He definitely had a &quot;better than thou&quot; attitude although he was helpful in getting his 19 year old assistant to show some units (all not what I was looking for).&nbsp; In every way, I could not believe my ears at just how arrogant a 20 year old could be.&nbsp; He asked me what brokers I was working with and I mentioned a couple.&nbsp; He seemed to know one of them and said, &quot;Oh, Linda?&nbsp; Yea, she doesn&#039;t know what she&#039;s talking about but she&#039;s a good kid.&quot;&nbsp; The Linda he was referring to was 35 years old.&nbsp; Rory&#039;s assistant, Angelina (?) was also clueless.&nbsp; We were looking at a unit in Gramercy.&nbsp; After she had finished her spiel about how much she walked the city and knew about real estate and Manhattan, I asked her about the Con Ed plant in the area (Union Squre).&nbsp; She had no clue what I was talking about and said that I must be kidding her.&nbsp; Umm...it&#039;s that really big fenced off complex that takes up a city block that generates power, is always stirring up controversy in the newspaper, and says &quot;Con Ed&quot; all over it.&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty hard to miss if only because it&#039;s a really ugly white building that sticks out like a sore thumb and has security all around it...<br /><br />Sasi at Citi Habitats (Upper West Side) was awful.&nbsp; He showed me a bunch of things I didn&#039;t want and utterly wasted my time trying to show me what he had in inventory regardless of my needs.&nbsp; It was a wild goose chase with no end.&nbsp; I ended up seeing a whole slew of apartments that were way too small for way too much.&nbsp; I&#039;m not even sure if he knew what my criteria was.&nbsp; What shocked the hell out of me was when other brokers had told me that he was a &quot;Top Performer&quot; at his company.&nbsp; I had a chuckle deep down and asked myself if standards had really gotten so low that Manhattaners are so desperate to work with *anyone*.<br /><br />Dave, the other superstar at Citi Habitats had a link to his personal site with all the accolades he won being the &quot;2007 Mann Award Broker of the Year.&quot;&nbsp; I called him about a listing.&nbsp; He told me he&#039;d call back in 30 mins with a viewing time.&nbsp; He never called back.&nbsp; I called him again a couple of hours later.&nbsp; He told me that he wasn&#039;t in the city and that&#039;d he call and arrange as assistant to do the viewing.&nbsp; He never called back.&nbsp; I eventually called him later that night and left a message saying that I was sorely disappointed in him for his terrible follow up.&nbsp; He called the next morning and said he had arranged a viewing that day and that he&#039;d call back and confirm the time.&nbsp; He never called back.&nbsp; I never called him back either.<br /><br />And by far the absolute worst broker was Ashley (male) at Century 21 NY Metro, or &quot;C21&quot; as he liked to call it.&nbsp; Over the phone he told me to go in to see the many listings that he thought would be perfect for me that we could look at that afternoon.&nbsp; I slotted 2 hours for him because he made it sound like he had an entire library of availabilities.&nbsp; I went in, completed the forms, and stepped inside his office.&nbsp; He instantly reminded me of all the slick-talking, SUPER obnoxious, arrogant, completely conceited salesmen of those Fortune 100 companies when they were at their so-called height.&nbsp; He talked down to me, wanted to make sure I wasn&#039;t wasting his time, and asked about why I hadn&#039;t pulled the trigger on the apartments I had seen yet.&nbsp; He said that C21 has 98% of the total listings in Manhattan (which is absolute BS, they&#039;re lucky if they have 40%) and that what I was looking for was impossible.&nbsp; He went through his listings and said that there was nothing in the city that matched my criteria and that I would have to up my price or take off.&nbsp; I listed a couple that I found and told him to re-search.&nbsp; He eventually found one listing that matched my criteria and arranged for a viewing the next day.&nbsp; I told him to forget it and thanked him for wasting my time.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think I worked with a total of 15 brokers in Manhattan.&nbsp; A lot didn&#039;t make this list because they weren&#039;t memorable or didn&#039;t have anything that I wanted but were OK.&nbsp; What has become obvious to me is that the barrier to become a licensed real estate broker/agent is so embarrassingly low that a lot of under-qualified people are giving the true brokers a really bad reputation if only by stereotype.&nbsp; Some brokers have been excellent but the vast majority are underwhelming at best, a nightmare to work with at worst.&nbsp; What&#039;s obvious is that the market has boomed for so long that a lot of people try and get into the action to turn a quick buck when in reality they should be doing something else with their time and not wasting the time of their clients.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=13565.msg164607.html#msg164607">Quote from: lanseaux on January 21, 2009, 10:02:06 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I have close friends who have lived in the 80s by 1st Ave (variously 81st, 82nd, 83rd and 84th Sts.) since the mid-90&#039;s, so I have made that trek many, many times.&nbsp;

				Also, while I do love Astoria, if the dog is turning out to be that much of a deal-breaker and you&#039;re really not thrilled with any of the apartments you&#039;ve seen, take a look at Inwood. There are some cute areas near beautiful parks, and the apartments are huge for Manhattan, as well as generally being more lenient about pets than Astoria. Also, the A train to midtown only takes about 25 minutes and offers an easy transfer to the D if that helps. Check out www.moresquarefeet.com and get in touch with Erin if you&#039;re interested.

				So the terms are pretty much set in stone.&nbsp; It looks like I will be moving to Astoria after all.&nbsp; I will be applying for the apartment tonight.<br /><br />I&#039;ll document the final details and will supply my &quot;post-carnage report&quot; upon successful signing of the lease along with other thoughts.&nbsp;

				The aftermath:<br /><br />Unit: 1 bedroom<br />Size: 580 sq feet<br />Price: $1,550<br />Location: Steinway near 28th Ave<br />Notes: Modern appliances, squeaky clean unit, 200 sq foot living room, small bedroom, dining room, large kitchen, good-sized bathroom, 2 closets<br /><br />The unit ended up being smaller than I had hoped especially after I measured with a measuring tape.&nbsp; What&#039;s funny is that it looks much bigger based on first impression.&nbsp; I had sworn it was near 650 sq feet the first time I saw it.&nbsp; It&#039;s actually a very nice unit although I do wish it was bigger.&nbsp; The bedroom ends up being the casualty here as it is big enough for my bed and dresser, but probably won&#039;t be able to hold a good amount of my bedroom furniture.&nbsp; I&#039;ll likely be selling my nightstands and other furniture in the very near future.<br /><br />The price is spot on and even fell under my budget.&nbsp; The original listing price was $1,700 with a one months broker fee but I&#039;m a pretty tough negotiator (that was my profession for many years at a Fortune 100) and eventually lowered the price.&nbsp; I&#039;m not going to post the final broker fee amount because I feel really bad for them.&nbsp; I think they do deserve the one month&#039;s fee for all the work they did and don&#039;t want anyone else trying to take advantage of them the way I did.&nbsp; Note about broker fee: it was a very low number and they proved to be very flexible with me (in fact, the broker went on record as saying that they had never done a broker fee that low before).<br /><br />About the broker:<br /><br />I rented through Jenna at Astoria Apartments Realty.&nbsp; She actually is quite a good broker: helpful, hardworking, really nice and friendly.&nbsp; She talks a bit much and a little too fast for my taste, but she came through in the clutch, showed me more qualified listings than any other broker (by a lot), and is someone I really enjoyed working with.&nbsp; In fact, she worked so hard that in the end when I was negotiating down the broker fee, I actually felt bad because I really thought she had earned her money.&nbsp; My hard-lined negotiating was definitely giving her and her boss heartburn and I could see it on their faces.<br /><br />I highly highly recommend her.&nbsp; She quickly became my favorite broker because she was honest, extremely hard working, and never ever gave up on finding a unit for me.&nbsp; And I really appreciated that last fact.<br /><br />Other brokers I recommend:<br /><br />Kim at Halvatzis was very good the first day but I never heard from her again from Day 2 on.&nbsp; So although she was great and made a great first impression, she definitely has to improve her follow up skills.&nbsp; That being said, she did show me a few units that I was interested in.&nbsp; I&#039;d recommend her although I&#039;ll also recommend that you follow up with her instead of the other way around.<br /><br />Jenny at Avanguard was also decent.&nbsp; Her biggest problem is that she&#039;s emotional and tells quite a few white lies to get you to sign through her.&nbsp; She comes across as a little &quot;car salesy&quot; -- specifically telling you how bad her competitor&#039;s listings are...then she&#039;ll go around and end up showing you the exact same listing this time telling you how good they are (as long as she shows them to you).&nbsp; Overall though, she showed me quite a few good, qualified listings.&nbsp; She worked very hard and had tremendous follow up, almost too good as a matter of fact (I swear she was stalking me sometimes).<br /><br />Brokers to avoid:<br /><br />Eleni Moustakis and/or Carl Nieto.&nbsp; I actually went on a rant about Carl in an earlier post.&nbsp; The reality is that because Eleni has chosen to partner with Carl, the quality of service you receive is a clear downgrade, well below average.&nbsp; Eleni herself is a bit scatterbrained and relies on Carl to do the negotiating.&nbsp; And therein lies the rub.&nbsp; He is the worst negotiator and has a fundamental lack of respect for his clients.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather burn my money in front of his face than pay him a broker&#039;s fee, even if he found me the Taj Mahal at $100.<br /><br />The rest of the brokers:<br /><br />Most of them had very very poor follow up and/or made very little to no impression whatsoever, which is a bad thing as a salesperson/broker.&nbsp; Only Mike from Astoria Park Realty ever called back to check up on my progress.&nbsp; Kudos to him.<br /><br />I will mention that Julius at Exit had follow up skills.&nbsp; His one problem was that he didn&#039;t have qualified units.&nbsp; He ended up showing me a lot of things that wasted my time, but he was honest, sincere, and tried hard.<br /><br />Other broker-related notes:<br /><br />One measuring stick that I love to use to gauge a broker is to ask them about their own living situation.&nbsp; If they are renting, I want to know that they have a SICK deal.&nbsp; If they themselves are getting ripped off, they&#039;re less likely to find you a good deal.<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br /><br />I&#039;m excited about my new apartment.&nbsp; I feel a little bit awkward but intrigued about living in the &quot;Middle East/North Africa/Egypt&quot; part of Astoria.&nbsp; I can honestly say that I&#039;ve always been curious about these cultures but never thought I&#039;d be living in one at this stage in my life.&nbsp; I wish the walk to the train was closer, but I&#039;ll make do.&nbsp; I also wish RCN or Verizon FIOS serviced my building and will be endlessly pursuing this in the near future.<br /><br />Am I absolutely ecstatic about my apartment?&nbsp; Yes and no.&nbsp; I do love the fact that I&#039;m moving to Astoria.&nbsp; I got the apartment under budget and didn&#039;t have to pay much for it, so I know I got an excellent deal.&nbsp; The unit itself is good, clean, new, and services all of my needs.&nbsp; I met the landlord last night and he seems to be really nice and responsive.&nbsp; AND IT ACCEPTS DOGS!!!!!&nbsp; That being said, the location could be closer to the train and the unit itself could be bigger.&nbsp; But I feel fine with it for now because I reason to myself that at least I&#039;m in Astoria now.&nbsp; The next move I make in Astoria to go after my dream apartment will be so much easier than going from Soho to Astoria every time I want to check out a unit.&nbsp; As long as I&#039;m in the vicinity, my options will open up and I&#039;ll be aware of more deals.<br /><br />I hope you guys have enjoyed this thread and I will be posting from time to time to update and maintain it.&nbsp; You&#039;ll likely see me being a much more active member on other threads now that I&#039;ll officially be an Astorian instead of a wanna-be.&nbsp; &nbsp;:lol:

				Thanks for all the great tips!<br /><br />The one thing I absolutely can&#039;t complain about are my dining and grocery options.&nbsp; I&#039;m a BIGTIME foodie and an iron chef in training.&nbsp; I&#039;m just thrilled with this opportunity to work with so many ethnic ingredients.<br /><br />I plan on doing a good amount of grocery shopping at the C-Town on 28th Ave and 41st street.&nbsp; For olive oil and meats, I&#039;m going to try hard and purchase mostly from the local, ethnic small businesses because I want to support the local trades as much as possible.&nbsp; For seafood, I hope to be purchasing from the local fishmongers near 30th Ave.<br /><br />I actually passed by Luna de Jaurez last time.&nbsp; I believe they had a buffet for $9.95 if I&#039;m not mistaken.&nbsp; I ate nearby last time I was checking out apartments at Little Morocco.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m surprised that there&#039;s an American restaurant nearby.&nbsp; When I walk out of my apartment, all I see are the aforementioned Egyptian/Moroccan/Middle Eastern eateries.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be sure to check out Stove especially when I&#039;m craving a burger.<br /><br />My recommended restaurants in the area thus far are (in no particular order): Agnanti, Tierras Colombianas, Zenon Taverna, Last Stop Restaurant, and Arhan Thai.&nbsp; I already have a huge list of other places I want to try and am excited.&nbsp; I&#039;m not excited about all the hours that I&#039;ll be spending at the gym (NYSC) in order to burn off all this good food.<br /><br />My wife has already complained to me that there&#039;s a lack of good Chinese restaurants in the area.&nbsp; I envision myself making the trek out to Flushing on a semi-consistent basis for both produce and good eats.<br /><br />All this talk about food has actually made me hungry...doh!

				Welcome to the neighborhood and to Astorians.com, Riteus.&nbsp; I&#039;ve really enjoyed reading your posts and I&#039;m so glad it worked out for you in the end.&nbsp; Finding an apartment in NYC is truly an ordeal.&nbsp; Perhaps if more people posted such lengthy broker reviews and apartment hunting experiences on the net, brokers and landlords would come around to realizing how hard and frustrating they can needlessly make the process be.&nbsp; It is truly a shame that a good amount of landlords here would rather see an empty apartment or storefront than bargain with renters in this dire economy.&nbsp; Best of luck to you Rireus!!!

				Well, as you&#039;ve read from my posts, it&#039;s pretty clear that landlords are asking for approximately $1,800 give or take for decent 2 bedroom apartments.&nbsp; Obviously, the pet situation was quite a curve ball.&nbsp; But I will say this: landlords seem to be a lot more tolerant of cats than dogs.&nbsp; So at least you have that on your side.&nbsp; <br /><br />Given the economic meltdown we&#039;re facing, I anticipate rent to continue dropping over the next 6~12 months with perhaps a flat curve or even a slight price increase during the summer.&nbsp; I know a lot of landlords are trying to &quot;make it past&quot; the winter and spring and hope that movement will pick up during the summer.&nbsp; In my amateur estimation, I&#039;d try and time the market to rent in March/April and resist the urge to move during the summer from May~September.&nbsp; After things cool down and depending on whether or not the economy picks back up, I&#039;d start to go apartment hunting again.<br /><br />Also, and I&#039;m sure that many of you guys are well aware of this, Astoria rent has really skyrocketed over the last two years.&nbsp; If you&#039;re living in an apartment that you locked into a lease from 2005, your rate is most likely going to seem incredible compared to current market prices.<br /><br />Case in point: my wife&#039;s friend has a 1 bedroom for $1,100/mo.<br /><br />I hate her guts.&nbsp; &nbsp;:evil:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=13565.msg165245.html#msg165245">Quote from: Mer on January 27, 2009, 11:40:21 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Riteus, I have to also jump in and say welcome to the &#039;hood and that I also loved your posts.&nbsp; &nbsp;But, wow, now my fiance and I are a bit frighten off about the idea possibly upgrading from a 1br to a 2br within Astoria.&nbsp; Which is all probably for the best in this economy.<br /><br />Also, I love your area of the neighborhood.&nbsp; I&#039;ve just recently spent some time there when I had to find a vet who could see my cat with a moment&#039;s notice.&nbsp; We took her to the Astoria Veterinary Group (on Steinway btw 25th and 23rd Aves) - they&#039;re awesome, however a little pricier than my normal vet. but I may switch to them despite the cost and distance.&nbsp; Also, if you ever need any reupholstering or re-stuffing of pillows (like I did recently), there&#039;s a great shop called LIS Upholstery Decorators (on Steinway btw 28th and 25th Aves).&nbsp; That&#039;s my extent of my experience in that part of Astoria, but I thought I&#039;d pass it along.&nbsp; Oh, but I will be venturing back to finally check out The Kabab Cafe. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Yeah, you&#039;re totally one block from my favorite bar in Astoria (the Irish Rover, 38th St &amp; 28th Av, as paratactical mentioned). Awesome! Also, Luna de Juarez (steinway &amp; 28th av) is pretty tasty Mexican. If you order chicken fajitas, you&#039;ll end up with a mountain of chicken, and be able to take a bunch home for leftovers.<br /><br />Congratulations, and welcome to Astoria!<br /><br />(also, I should start reading the rest of threads before I comment, since Luna de Juarez was already mentioned. But who cares?)<br /><br />Oh, and like I said upthread, taking the Q101 bus to the R/V is PERFECT for those days when you just don&#039;t feel like walking. Not sure how many minutes you would have to add to the schedule for it to get from Hazen to 28th Ave, but look it up and time it. It doesn&#039;t hit too much traffic before 28th Ave.

				Riteus,<br /><br />First at all, thank GOD for your amazing apartment-hunting tale. You have no idea how just reading you have made me feel less alone and vulnerable in the midst of this journey trying to find an apartment within the 5 Burroughs. <br /><br />Inexperienced as I am in the NYC real state market, I began with high hopes, dreaming about finding a one-in-a-life-time opportunity in Manhattan. But, my dreams were crashed early on, as I discovered that despite the fact of finding many posts of available 1BR decently located throughout Manhattan, most of them were simply a lie. Just as it happened, just for example, with Manhattan Apartments were I went trying to find a wonderful 500Sq Ft 1BR located in 96th and Lexington for just $1182/per month because it was a rent-stabilized apart. Little did I know that once I went to the realtors office in Manhattan I was going to be told that the apartment was rented that same afternoon, only to find out later, thanks to the honesty of another realtor at the same company that the apartment as happens with many others they advertise, didn&#039;t exist. IT DIDN&#039;T EXIST, as you read it.<br /><br />I truly wanted to believe that the prices in Manhattan were going down, but it was hard to. Despite of finding one or two other REAL apartments through other realtors, once I checked the units I realized that although they were asking a lower price for what otherwise would have been WAY out of my budget, the apartments in the city were nothing else than closets with inside bathrooms. I can even tell you about a studio that had such a small kitchen that if I ever decided to cook a chicken in it, I would have had to make a decision: It was either the chicken or me, because we both couldn&#039;t have fit in that kitchen.<br /><br />So, following a friend&#039;s advise I decided to look into moving to Astoria. I have been in the neighborhood several times and have always loved it, so the suggestion did seem very reasonable. Since then, (a week and so ago) I have been exploring opportunities in the area through craigslist. I have found every kind of apartment/broker there is under the sun, and I am ready for a full-day of &quot;showings&quot; tomorrow. Beginning at 10am and having my last appt at 6pm I think I will be checking out about 10 units in the area. The price seems pretty much the same (which is great) they are all in the $1200-1300 range which happens to be what I have budgeted. However, (here is the deal) even though I have been in the area several times, as I said, I have no sense of orientation WHATSOEVER. I don&#039;t know where is East, South, North or West and with all the avenues and streets in the area having the same numbers and crossing each other, Astoria has become very confusing to me. <br /><br />At this point I don&#039;t know what areas are best, where is more convenient or safer, where is more hectic or quiet. I know Nothing, Zip, nada and wouldn&#039;t want to go to my appts falling desperately victim of my own ignorance. So, I decided to ask for your help, hoping you don&#039;t mind me to.<br /><br />I am a single young professional who will be working in lower manhattan, so I will be commuting back and forth everyday. Thus, I want an area that is pretty convenient transportation-wise. Also, being single and living by myself I would like an area that is really safe but that also has something to it, whether are restaurants or cafes or even little grocery stores or bodegas that are going to make my life not only easier but more pleasant. When it comes to the apartment I am looking for a comfortable 1BR with a nice kitchen and bathroom and (GOD PLEASE) some decent closet space. <br /><br />So, what would you recommend? What areas in Astoria would you suggest me to look into? Do you have the number of this girl Jenny that you recommended in one of your most recent posts as a great realtor? I&#039;d love to find someone honest, not-pushy, hard working and considered to work with, because I am not good at negotiating and I will be checking apartments, negotiating and closing the deal on my own and I just don&#039;t do well with numbers. ;-) <br /><br />Again, thank you for your interesting posts and please know that any piece of advise will be highly appreciated. <br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Camuri.<br /><br />PS: By the way, I&#039;ve been in the Middle Eastern part of Astoria several times and can tell you that there is a little corner store, I believe around 28th St. (but don&#039;t trust me on that one because as I said I never know where I am) that has a sign outside that reads &quot;THE BEST MERGUEZ IN NYC&quot; by the NYTimes..You need to check that place out..HANDS DOWN the best MERGUEZ I have ever tried. I am also a foodie so you can trust me on that one. Also, I don&#039;t remember where but around Astoria there is a north African restaurant that has a mean couscous that you need to try. I will find out the address if you are interested. Let me know.

				Camuri--<br /><br />After living in Astoria for a while, I had a little &quot;box&quot; of Astoria where I would like to live when I looked for my most recent apartment.<br /><br />I tend to prefer the N/W to the R/G/V because I often take the train alone late at night and being a 5&#039;1&quot; girl, I feel like the N/W is safer. I know lots of people on the board disagree with me, but it&#039;s my preference.<br /><br />I made a box that had a western border of 21st St, an eastern border of Steinway or 45th St (if I had found the perfect place east of Steinway, I would have taken it, but it would&#039;ve had to be *perfect*), a northern border of 21st Ave and a southern border of Broadway. While it&#039;s perfect safe to live south of Broadway, I tend to prefer the 30th Ave or Ditmars areas. Ditmars is a little more &quot;town-y&quot; with lots of tree lined streets and it gets pretty quiet at night. <br /><br />I ended up moving off of the 30th Ave N/W stop, though, because I prefer to be around places with restaurants and convenience stores that are open late at night.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the map I made for my search: http://maps.google.com/maps?q=astoria&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;split=0&amp;gl=us&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=image<br /><br />Go to that link, click &quot;My Maps&quot; and look for &quot;Astoria Apartment Search&quot; to see the borders I made for myself.

				Dear Paratactical,<br /><br />OMG!!! God bless you for your reply. I find&nbsp; all the info very useful and even though I couldn&#039;t somehow see your map, I am going to print out a street map of astoria and create a box using your suggestion, so I can&nbsp; bring it with me tomorrow.. If by any chance you have the possibility of sending me the link again for your map, in a message I will highly appreciate it.<br /><br />Thank You, Thank You very much!!! <br /><br />Best,<br /><br />Camuri.

				Like Paratactical, I also prefer that box of area of Astoria (although, I think I could stretch my Southern border to 36th Ave.).&nbsp; When I first moved here I lived in the Ditmars area on one of those cute tree-lined street in an apt. that was part of a private home.&nbsp; It was great, but when I moved out from that share to get my own place I looked for apartments in rent stabilized buildings.&nbsp; And although I wanted to stay in the Ditmars area, I ended up just off of Broadway because the apartment was exactly what I wanted.&nbsp; &nbsp;Broadway is much livelier than where I use to live but I like that there&#039;s a whole lot more around me (Ditmars had a lot of stuff too, but I felt it was more disconnected from the rest of Astoria) and I have easy access to the R line (which comes in handy for those Target trips or when the N/W are down) and I&#039;m much closer to the big commercial stores like Cost-co (in one direction) and Home Depot (in the other direction).&nbsp; That said, I do miss Ditmars and would definitely look for places there if my fiance and I decide to upgrade to a 2br.&nbsp; Oh, and one huge advantage to Ditmars, you always get a seat on the train. Speaking of which, I&#039;m also a youngish professional (at what age do you stop being a young professional?) and work in lower Manhattan (Rector St. is my stop).&nbsp; The subway trip is around 35 -45 mins but, it&#039;s mostly a relaxing trip since I always get a seat by at least the 49th St.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gotten a whole lot of reading done over the past 6 years.

				Camuri--<br /><br />I can&#039;t figure out how it works! Sorry!<br /><br />But I will say that I sincerely think anything in that area is safe. I&#039;m a big fat wuss, too, so you might even be comfy with areas outside of that.<br /><br />I like hanging out in the 36th St area, but the clubs and the industrial buildings give me heebie jeebies at night (like I said, total wuss).<br /><br />There&#039;s pluses and minuses to Ditmars, Astoria Blvd, 30th Ave and Broadway, but I like 30th Ave because I&#039;m in the middle and will walk to everything!

				I just got my place through Jenny at Avanguard. I thought she was great - after seeing tons of awful places through Craigslist and a couple other brokers, we gave her a call. She showed us some nice places in our range, and then we actually got the one we wanted most. :? Jenny&#039;s number is 718-545-0595. I know two other people who used her too, and all are happy. <br /><br />Seriously, after this I am never using Craigslist again to find an apartment. It was great for finding roommates, but when you&#039;re looking for an entire apartment to rent, the bulk of the stuff up there is either fake listings from legitimate brokers who just want to get you in their office, listings that are a blatant scam from people who just want to steal your money, or legitimate, crappy, overpriced apartments that nobody wants.

				Occasional board lurker.&nbsp; First time poster.<br /><br />To me the sweet spot of Astoria, south of the Ditmars area, is between 28th Ave and 35th Ave from North/South and Crescent St to Steinway St West/East.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived right off of 31st Ave for the past two years and really enjoy it.&nbsp; I&#039;m an equal walk from the restaurants and cafes on 30 Ave and the more generalized businesses on Broadway.&nbsp; Plus 31st Ave has some very good restaurants - Brick, Zenon, Il Bambino and my laundromat and gym are right around the corner.&nbsp; (My gf lives in a Manhattan high rise with on-premises cleaners and it takes her longer to get there than I do.)<br /><br />All that said, I&#039;m looking for a new place now.&nbsp; I&#039;m in a 3 BR with 2 roommates, lease expires at the end of Feb.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to move into a 2 BR apt close by to where I am, but I want to keep my options open with the economy.&nbsp; Anyone know of good leads or openings?

				Thank you all for your words of advice. It is highly appreciated.<br /><br />I went today to my apartment-hunting marathon and it went pretty well. I first started with Grace Realty right on Broadway. They showed me some units around the area, but I wasn&#039;t thrilled by any of the 4 apartments they showed me. Most of the units were between 36th Ave and the Broadway area and were almost all 4 or 5 walk-up units which didn&#039;t make it very appealing to me (especially when thinking about the logistics of the moving process and the weekly grocery shopping). However, they had a very nice unit near the Visual Arts Museum and future Frank Sinatra school that was in the highest end of my budget but that was really nice. It had a renovated bathroom, a nice kitchen and some decent closet space. Nevertheless, I didn&#039;t feel very attracted to the area (Although it well could have been because I wasn&#039;t pretty sure about where I was ;-) - as usual)<br /><br />Then, I met with Shantal from Aamen Realty. She first showed me a horrible and very ran down unit located on crescent and 28th St. The area didn&#039;t seem very convenient transportation-wise and to be honest the apartment was in terrible shape. After that, She showed me two very very nice units (The ones I have liked the most so far) on 31st Ave. between 28th and 29th Streets. The area looked really good, the buildings were very well kept and the units were just really really really nice. They both had renovated bathroom and kitchen and some decent closet space. However, they are asking a little more than $1300 for the first one and $1300 for the second one (although the second one seemed bigger). She said that the landlords would like to rent them by the 15th and I am not sure about that because if I leave my current apartment before March 1st I will most likely lose my security deposit. Nevertheless, I am planning to talk to her again on Monday and see what she can do to convince at least one of the landlords to accept a March 1st moving date. Let&#039;s see.<br /><br />However, I wanted to ask for your advise about the area. What do you think? Is it a good area? Is it easy to find parking around that area? I couldn&#039;t get to walk from the building to the subway so I couldn&#039;t check how long it will take to get to any of the subway stations (She said that both stations, Broadway and 30th, are at about the same distance from the building) Is it fair to say that it will be a 5-10mins walk?<br /><br />Overall, I liked dealing with her. She was not pushy at all. She seem knowledgeable about the area and willing to negotiate. Of course I didn&#039;t try to negotiate the broker&#039;s fee yet, but I am planning to go there once we finish negotiating the terms of the contract.<br /><br />After that I met with Peter from Century 21. He seemed pretty honest, knowledgeable and nice. Although, he attempted to show me a unit and once we got there he realized he didn&#039;t have the keys to the front door for which we had to abort that plan and continue on with another unit he has near Ditmars. The one apartment he did show me was in a family house around 24th st near Ditmars. It was a really nice unit, only that the kitchen was not independent from the living room and I didn&#039;t like that. But the people living there seemed pretty happy about the place and were really nice answering all the questions I had about parking, electricity bills, the landlord, etc.<br /><br />Then I called JAY, who I didn&#039;t know happens to work with Eleni whose posts I have seen but never felt like calling her, especially after I read that Riteus didn&#039;t find her to be that good of a realtor. I met with Eleni (Jay was not available) and she showed me a very ugly so-called ground apartment (which is an euphemism for basement apartment) right on 35th St. off Astoria Blvd. (near the police station). I was not happy with the area and didn&#039;t like the unit at all. After that, she told me she had a nicer unit she could show me. We went and saw this&nbsp; nice little apartment on 32nd St between Astoria Blvd and 28th Ave. The unit has been renovated a little, it was on the first floor which makes it very appealing, and it had three very nice closets (I am a closet-dependent person, so this meant a lot to me). The only thing was that the bathroom tiles are in this periwinkle-aquamarine shade that I don&#039;t know if I would be able to stand without having a nervous breakdown after a month or two of seeing it every day. Other than that, I walked to the station and it seemed like a good 5mins nice walk (despite the weather). However, I am not very sure about the area. It didn&#039;t seem as safe, attractive and upcoming as the rest of the areas I saw today. I may be totally wrong on that, I could has just been too tired to see things clearly, but that&#039;s what I felt as I walked towards the Astoria Blvd. Subway station. Although, it is important to note that they are asking $1250 for this apartment as supposed to $1300.<br /><br />Now, can anyone tell me, which of the apartments I described has the best location? which one would you recommend me to go for?<br /><br />Thanks in advance!<br /><br />Best,<br />Camuri. :-)<br /><br /><br /><br />

				OOps! As usual I made a mistake with the address of the apartments I liked the most. They are not located on 31st Ave. between 29th and 28th, BUT on 31st Ave. between 29th and 30th St. Sorry! ;-)

				Camuri,<br /><br />None of those apartments (even the 28th Ave and Crescent location--which happens to be where I live) is more than a 10 minute walk to the subway.<br /><br />The apartment on 32nd St between Astoria Blvd and 28th Ave doesn&#039;t have the prettiest walk to the subway, but you&#039;re the second to last stop and you will almost always get a seat on the train. Also, you&#039;re very close to grocery stores on 33rd St and 30th Ave and to lots of bars and restaurants on 28th Ave.<br /><br />It really is up to your personal taste from here!

				So I thought I&#039;d give an update after making the move.&nbsp; I just got my internet connected today, so I wasn&#039;t even aware that some Astorian neophyte (yay, I&#039;m not alone in this club) needed my help.&nbsp; First with the update:<br /><br />The move went relatively smoothly although the apartment lost electricity on the first day I moved in.&nbsp; Yay, NOT.<br /><br />The tub was re-glazed the day I moved in, meaning that I couldn&#039;t shower for the first two days unless I wanted to ruin the glaze job and risk them re-glazing again some other time.&nbsp; Yeah, that sucked, I really needed a shower and shave.&nbsp; Needless to say, I took an extra long/thorough shower job when I finally could jump in the tub.<br /><br />I&#039;m 90% unpacked but now need to do a thorough cleaning of the apartment.&nbsp; There was a good layer of dust on the floor.&nbsp; And since I&#039;m pretty much a neat person, expect a good dousing of Tilex and Clorox in the near future.&nbsp; Ahh...nothing quite like a good strong waft of bleach to guarantee the area is nuked of dirt and germs.<br /><br />I needed to sell some of my stuff in order for the apartment to fit my furniture, including two TVs.&nbsp; I just sold 1 today and I have a potential buyer for the second one lined up.<br /><br />Overall, it&#039;s taking a little while to get adjusted to the area.&nbsp; I&#039;m blaming it on the transition, but being in Queens when most of my friends are in Manhattan has made me feel somewhat isolated.&nbsp; And since I work from home, it&#039;s just really really quiet.&nbsp; Also, my dog is going on a peeing spree in the streets since he&#039;s completely unfamiliar with the area and needs to mark his scent everywhere to make sure he finds his way home.<br /><br />I&#039;ve made two meals so far:<br /><br />1. Lamb shank tagine (cinnamon, ginger, tomato sauce, white wine) + couscous (raisin, cucumber, red onion, tomato, mint, lemon zest)<br />2. Chinese stewed pork (dark and light soy, sugar, star anise, wild pepper, garlic, cinnamon) + green beans (made with the leftover tomato sauce I had with the lamb tagine) served over rice<br /><br />I don&#039;t have a dish rack yet and I&#039;ve been eating on my coffee table since I don&#039;t have a dining table either.&nbsp; As I mentioned earlier, I finally got connected with cable and internet today.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t met many of my neighbors yet.&nbsp; My wife bumped into a young girl from Miami, I&#039;ve seen a fellow asian girl come out of my building, and two girls welcomed us to the neighborhood the other day.&nbsp; I introduced myself to the landlord.&nbsp; Oh, it&#039;s worth mentioning that my next door neighbors seem to do quite a bit of shouting.&nbsp; They&#039;re either really rowdy or there&#039;s definitely some occasional inter-family &quot;miscommunication&quot; going on.&nbsp; Also, a hispanic/latino group of guys had a really loud Superbowl party till wee into the hours of Sunday night.&nbsp; Although I introduced myself to them and then asked them nicely to keep it down, they eventually pumped the music back up after about 5 mins of lowering the volume (there&#039;s nothing quite like Latin honkytonk blasting at 3AM preventing a good night&#039;s sleep).&nbsp; That&#039;s when my next door neighbor stepped in.&nbsp; I heard some shouting going on, not really sure what was said.&nbsp; But after that, the music just stopped abruptly.&nbsp; Although I haven&#039;t met my next door neighbor yet (and I&#039;m not sure that I really want to), I am sure he is VERY convincing when he starts yelling.

				As for help, Camuri -<br /><br />From my experience, Astoria pretty much breaks down into the following areas:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Broadway/30th Ave: young, fun, lots of dining, is the area most similar to Manhattan.&nbsp; This area also features a lot of relocated Manhattaners.&nbsp; In general, the rent here seems to be the highest in all of Astoria.&nbsp; If you&#039;re on a budget, either expect a smaller or more run-down unit, or you&#039;re going to have to pay more for a nicer unit.&nbsp; Also, this area seems to be less pet friendly.&nbsp; Ethnic makeup seems to be predominantly Greek, Italian, general Caucasian, and some traces of Hispanic and Asian.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Ditmars: More families, quieter, very new and semi-upscale area with good restaurants.&nbsp; Housing seems to be larger here, but not necessarily cheaper.&nbsp; This area has lots of nice restaurants as well.&nbsp; Also a lot of relocated Manhattaners.&nbsp; Ethnic makeup seems to be largely general Caucasian with some Greek.<br /><br />Both the above areas either east or west of the N/W are nice (read: more affluent).&nbsp; On the west side is Astoria Park and the Beer Garden.&nbsp; On the East side is Steinway street and access to the R/V/G trains which are a good backup in case you need added transportation options.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Steinway: Busy, lots of shops, eateries, lower end stores, very ethnic with lots of mixed ethnic minorities.&nbsp; East of Steinway street seems to be the cutoff point between local Queens natives and relocateed Manhattan young professionals, although I&#039;m not sure of this.&nbsp; Ethnic makeup seems to be mostly Hispanic and Middle Eastern with some traces of Greek and Italian.<br /><br />Based on this assessment, I&#039;d say that as a young professional, you&#039;re most likely going to be attracted mostly towards the Broadway/30th Ave area, Ditmars (in terms of North-South geographic border), or the area west of Steinway including perhaps Steinway itself and a few blocks east (in terms of East-West), but not more.<br /><br />There seems to pretty much be decent dining options on every street, but most of the best (or at least more well-known) eateries are closer to the N/W train.&nbsp; There also seems to be a convenience store and laundromat on every corner.<br /><br />As for brokers, I&#039;d recommend:<br /><br />Jenna at Astoria Apartments 917-698-6398 (still have her # on my phone, hehe)<br />Kim at Halvatzis http://www.halvatzisrealty.com/Nav.aspx/Page=/Forms/ContactForm.aspx<br />Jenny at Avanguard http://www.avanguardrealty.com/aboutus.php<br /><br />I recommend these three because they most consistently showed me better units that were what I was looking for and didn&#039;t waste much of my time.&nbsp; Their listings, for my needs anyway, are generally better than the rest.

				I know you found a place, but if anyone is in a similar situation...<br /><br />Ralph at Astoria Realty just helped me find a nice, clean one bedroom -- pet friendly!. The price had just gone down to $1450 (from $1550) but I got it for $1350. He was really honest and straightforward. I had told him we couldn&#039;t go over $1300, so he wasn&#039;t going to show us this place and didn&#039;t try to push anything out of our price range on us. But I insisted he show us this one, and the other places couldn&#039;t even compare. <br />His number: 516-924-9860

				Apartment in review:<br /><br />So I guess I felt like I was on top of the world after I managed to get a lease.&nbsp; After moving, it&#039;s taken a little bit to settle in.&nbsp; This being my second week at this apartment, I thought I&#039;d give some impressions:<br /><br />The unit itself is in good condition, not great but not bad.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Uneven flooring - it&#039;s hard to notice until you start setting things up but this wood floor, as glossy and new as it looks, is in pretty bad condition.&nbsp; The heat from the radiators is wreaking havoc on the wood, causing it to expand and contract, warping the floor and making the apartment un-level.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard to notice to the naked eye, but looking around, you notice that everything is always at a slight slant.&nbsp; I recently bought a leveler at the hardware store and it was fun applying it to everything and seeing just how uneven my desk, bed, TVs are.&nbsp; More importantly, the wood fractures and splinters easily forcing us to walk around in slippers for fear of getting splinters in our feet.<br /><br />The uneven floor also extends to the bathroom.&nbsp; The tile in the bathroom seems to be unlevel as well, perhaps because it rests on top of warped wood floor.&nbsp; The bathtub is at a slight slant.&nbsp; Whenever water gets on the rim of the bathtub (everytime we shower), the water then flows onto the ground, causing a semi-substantial amount of water to be all over the floor.&nbsp; Imagine filling up 3 large cups of water and dumping it on the floor everytime you wash.<br /><br />The water temperature in this building is actually out of control.&nbsp; In the middle of showers, the water suddenly becomes boiling hot.&nbsp; I actually had to jump out of the shower (and into the pool of water on the ground) the other day.&nbsp; I thought the water was actually going to leave a mark.&nbsp; I adjusted the water and then it steadied.&nbsp; I jumped back into the shower and then the water dropped to freezing cold.&nbsp; It left me gasping for air.&nbsp; I had to jump out of the shower again.&nbsp; My skin was definitely confused going from boiling to freezing in a matter of seconds.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The neighborhood is actually pretty fun for a foodie.&nbsp; The halal butchers and Middle Eastern delis are starting to recognize me.&nbsp; The people are actually quite nice.&nbsp; I do wish their stores had a more neutral smell when going (it always has such a strong smell of spices), but in general I&#039;ve found my way around.<br /><br />The coffee shop on Astoria Blvd called Soliel is really great.&nbsp; They have good coffee and excellent pastry.<br /><br />I also seemingly bought out the Middle Eastern pastry shop, Lazizzi(sp?), last time I went.&nbsp; They have one donut-like dessert that&#039;s just flat out amazing.<br /><br />The hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant on Astoria Blvd is also fun.&nbsp; It&#039;s SUPER cheap and it serves, good, honest, authentic food, something I appreciate very much.<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br /><br />I still wish my apartment was a couple of blocks closer to the train.&nbsp; I&#039;ll work on that for my next move.&nbsp; There are still logistical issues here and there, but at least my apartment is coming together slowly.&nbsp; I have to find a solution to the water on the bathroom floor, however.

				Camuri --<br /><br />What ever happened w/ the apartment on 31 ave bet 29th/30th? I live right in that area, and see lots of open units; my two cents -- bargain down the price as much as you can, it will help all the rest of us!<br /><br />Good luck if you didn&#039;t sign anything yet.

				So here&#039;s my latest update:<br /><br />I discovered the Tri-borough beverage distribution/wholesaler on Astoria Blvd.&nbsp; Oh boy, life as we know it is over :)<br /><br />I&#039;m actually adjusting pretty well to the area.&nbsp; After 3 weeks of being in my apartment, everything is going quite smoothly.&nbsp; I wish there were more bodegas in my area, however.&nbsp; Being a die-hard supporter of local shops, I hate having to walk to 30th Ave and 32nd street.&nbsp; It&#039;s a 20+ minute hike each way.&nbsp; Walking there is less of a pain, but walking back with two handfuls of groceries sucks.&nbsp; It makes me just want to go to C-Town instead.&nbsp; In general, I find C-Town&#039;s variety to be fine, but the quality of produce can be very inconsistent.&nbsp; At best, it&#039;s decent, at worse the vegetables are going bad on the shelves.<br /><br />I discovered Jackson Heights for the first time last weekend.&nbsp; It was amazing.&nbsp; I can&#039;t believe there is a mini-Bollywood in New York.&nbsp; Against my will but because it was a &quot;you just gotta do it once&quot; kinda thing, we ate at Jackson Diner.&nbsp; It ended up being decent.&nbsp; The tandoori was great but the masalas were very average.&nbsp; Next time we&#039;re going to try a more local place.<br /><br />My neighbors have actually knocked on my door several times.&nbsp; Apparently, I&#039;m causing quite a commotion in my apartment building because they love the smells emanating from my kitchen.&nbsp; I get complimented on a semi-consistent basis even though nobody has tried my food...yet.&nbsp; It&#039;s very surprising and I&#039;m very flattered.<br /><br />I&#039;ve started to build a little report with the Middle Eastern/Egyptian vendors in the area.&nbsp; They know me as the Asian guy always buying their super ethnic things.&nbsp; Some of it is quite good actually.&nbsp; Some of it can be not quite to my taste.&nbsp; For example, the Istanbully feta is quite tasty, but the tea biscuits are actually pretty dry and lack flavor.&nbsp; I still haven&#039;t had a hookah yet.<br /><br />I invited my coworkers to my place this past weekend.&nbsp; Most of them are already in Astoria.&nbsp; But after seeing my place, two more of them are seriously considering moving here.&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; Welcome to the dark side!

				I have worked and know Eleni very well, and all the stuff you write about her is untrue.<br />She is honest , hard working, and will find you the best place in Astoria.<br />She has lived the area for over 20 years, and knows the area very well.<br />She does not work with Carl. <br />I think of anyone wants to find the truth about any agent/broker in the area, it is best to find out themselves. <br />It is useless to rely on someone who has no life, and nothing better to do than make up stories!
