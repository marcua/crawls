				Brick Cafe? 31st Avenue and 33rd Street. I&#039;d say that place is casually romantic, but at night when the candles are lit, it feels really cozy and quaint.

				The most romantic restaurant in Astoria would be &quot;Cafe Lizluv&quot;.&nbsp; Its located in Astoria Park, where the seating is a simple blanket overlooking the East River.&nbsp; Cafe Lizluv goes through all the efforts to make a romantic evening, including candles, proper glasswear, cloth napkins, chilled white wine and a supercharged Ipod which plays the owners favorite romantic music (if suggestions are taken, nothing beats Jobim on the stuffy wonderful summer evenings as tonight shall be).&nbsp; Fare is simple yet elegant, with smoked meats from the areas salumerias, greek cheeses and fresh fruit (getting hand fed grapes while reclined is cliche, but still so fabulous) from the 30th Avenue fruit markets.&nbsp; Dessert is topped off by the humble, yet brilliant soft ice cream with sprinkles provided by the Mr. Softie truck.<br /><br />

				In the Ditmars area, I think the most romantic atmosphere is at 718.&nbsp; I like the round corner booths - they allow you to sit close to each other while still being sort of cross from each other.&nbsp; I wish they would update the menu, but I still find the food to be pretty good.&nbsp; <br /><br />I agree with Harlan that the decor at the new Philoxenia is very attractive, if not quite romantic.<br /><br />I&#039;ve only eaten at Locale once, but I think it could be considered sleekly romantic, with exposed brick and tall paned windows.&nbsp; I have not been to Stove, but from what I&#039;ve heard it might be romantic.&nbsp; Perhaps someone else can confirm or refute that.&nbsp; Also, Malagueta - Brazilian on 36th Ave. is cute and I think it could be described as romantic-ish, if a bit cramped.

				&nbsp;:rock:<br /><br />Well, to paraphrase the NY Times (http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/07/01/travel/01weekend.html), Jolson&#039;s is a convenient place not to pick up a decent bottle of wine.&nbsp; And of course, there are more and more bodegas and delis selling some really great microbrews you won&#039;t get.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Bobolink&#039;s neighbors can supply you with fruit and dessert, and then, since alcohol is not allowed in the park, be sure not to stop by 67 Wine and Spirits for a bottle of shiraz to go with the cheddar. If it&#039;s Sunday, there&#039;s a Greenmarket at 77th and Columbus, near Nancy&#039;s Wines for Foods, another perfect spot not to pick up a bottle.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
