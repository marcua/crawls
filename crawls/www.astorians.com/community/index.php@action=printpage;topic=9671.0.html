				Yes that&#039;s the place.&nbsp; It&#039;s on the corner of Broadway and 34th.&nbsp; I just peeked inside and it looks like the atmosphere is pretty nice.&nbsp; They have a menu posted outside which looked good too.&nbsp; Don&#039;t know anyone who has been there yet.

				The early 20&#039;s crowd doesn&#039;t scare me unless they are acting like it&#039;s spring break in Cancun or something....i&#039;m going to hold out a bit to see if anyone has tried this place out.&nbsp; If not...i&#039;ll be the sacrificial lamb

				I think that space is trying to contend for the title of Astoria&#039;s new &quot;cursed corner.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D<br /><br />Nothing there seems to have lasted more than a few months or a year in recent memory.

				nope, and most everything there is pointless (indistinguishable from other spots in the neighborhood).&nbsp; I almost wish the 99 cent store was still there, at least it was well organized.

				Hopefully it will be something nice.&nbsp; I just learned that the old NuBar/Ultra space is going to be an Indian Fusion restaurant.

				and I&#039;m thrilled about that!<br /><br />I hope it&#039;s good Indian as well.<br /><br />I suspect a restaurant will probably take the Cellar 34 space as well, it&#039;s becoming a mini-restaurant row along Broadway, which is a lovely development.

				The sound of an Indian fusion restaurant makes me drool....I hope it&#039;s good too.&nbsp; And you&#039;re right McDirk....the variety of restaurants coming to Broadway is a good thing.
