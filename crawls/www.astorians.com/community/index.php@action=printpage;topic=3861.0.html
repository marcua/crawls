				<br />http://www.getliberty.org/commonsense/index.php<br /><br />Two Good to Be True?&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />10/20/06&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />Color me skeptical. Both major-party candidates for New York governor have agreed to serve only two terms at most if elected chief executive of the state. They both also agree that lawmakers of the rust-encrusted state legislature should be term-limited. <br /><br />The candidates noted their support for term limits during a meeting New York State Associated Press Association. Spitzer says, &quot;I really believe that if an executive can&#39;t achieve in eight years what needs to be done, then give someone else a shot. The new vitality you get with a change is also important.&quot; <br /><br />It&#39;s fine that these guys feel a political need to voice support for term limits in an un-term-limited state like New York. There, governors often serve three terms...and lawmakers often even longer. <br /><br />And it&#39;s nice they&#39;re at least mentioning term limits, the most systematic method of cleaning house. It&#39;s good to see public acknowledgement of the only sure way of regularly countering the advantages of incumbency and promoting genuine electoral competition. <br /><br />On the other hand, term limits are hardly being pushed as a major issue in either campaign. It&#39;s not even noted on the &quot;issues&quot; pages of their campaign websites. <br /><br />If these two gentlemen, John Faso and Eliot Spitzer, are serious about changing state government, term limits are the way. But they won’t get it done simply by being for term limits. They’ll have to confront the powerful lobbies in Albany and use the bully pulpit. &nbsp;<br /><br />Starting right now...as candidates for governor. <br /><br />This is Common Sense. I&#39;m Paul Jacob. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

				I think Spitzer has national aspirations, I don&#39;t see him lingering in Albany past 8 years.&nbsp; I hope he gets to reforming on day one!&nbsp; I have a heck of a lot of faith in him.
