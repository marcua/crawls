				I've eaten good Thai, Brazilian, o.k. sushi, good Middle Eastern, Great Mexican. &nbsp;My problem is that I can't find good Chinese? &nbsp;Can anyone help me with this problem. &nbsp;The Chinese restaurants that I have been to in Astoria are mediocre at best, its horrible when you taste the old oil in your food - yuck. &nbsp;Please advise.<br /><br />&nbsp;:shock: &nbsp;:shock:

				There is none. &nbsp;I think all Chinese restaurants in Astoria SUCK a big time. &nbsp;Well, it's hard to find any decent Chinese restaurant in NYC in the first place. &nbsp;IMO, Chinese food, especially take out place in general, is a &quot;McDonald's of Asian food&quot;. &nbsp;<br /><br />Stick to Japanese here in Astoria and you'll do fine. &nbsp;I'm not saying just because my background is Japanese.<br /><br />NS

				The only place I know of that you can get half way decent Chinese food is in China Town. I don't really eat Chinese food much, especially after I got sick eating Chinese from a place not to far from the Freezepeach cafe. I prefer Japanese food now. Better tasting and more healthy for you.

				There's one good brasilian place that I personally chastise alot because their service can be TERRIBLE and their prices are a little too high for typical brasilian fair.<br /><br />However, being brasilian, I can vouch that Sabor Tropical on 30th avenue and 36th street (which seems to be a small enclave of Brasil on 30th to begin with) is pretty damn good food.<br /><br />My only major complaints with them are: They do that thing where they include the &quot;suggested&quot; tip in the amount of the bill (which you can totally change when they swipe your card, they only imput the correct pre-tip amount), which I think is cheeky beyond belief. They don't speak enough English for the non-Portuguese speaking clientele, which as a result stays away. Also, they only do black beans on the weekends, sticking to the less-typical (northern) red beans during the week. <br /><br />This all makes them sound bad. They're NOT. I keep going there, even THOUGH I'm frustrated with the service sometimes (and I SPEAK Portuguese) because their food is really, really good, and gives me a little taste of home.<br /><br />Order the pastels - you won't be disappointed.

				I really like Sabor Tropical, too. &nbsp;Although we live by Ditmars, we go out of our way to go there. &nbsp;Although I understand a little Portuguese, I don't speak it (although my grandfather was Portuguese), but I've never had a problem communicating.<br /><br />I noticed, I think last winter? they started including the tip in the bill without informing customers, and I let them know that we didn't appreciate it. &nbsp;They didn't used to, so I felt it was particularly sly just to start tacking it on. &nbsp;I think they may have started doing this when they started accepting credit cards.<br /><br />The best hole-in-the-wall Chinese-American joint IMO is Golden Chopsticks. &nbsp;They're next to Trade Fair on Ditmars between 37th and 38th. &nbsp;They're no more real Chinese than the next place, and sure, it may be a Chinese McD's, but their veggies are always really fresh, and I don't think I've ever got a dish that was really off in probably 12 years of ordering from them.

				The closest thing to decent Chinese food here in Astoria is Wah Fung on Steinway at Ditmars. Nothing a native would consider authentic, I'm sure, but &nbsp;they make everything fresh to order, and seem to use good ingredients.

				I suppose all the Chinese places around here taste like typical Chinese takeout, but I've just fnished some shrimp and mixed vegetables from Lilly's on 30th Ave., and the crunchy freshness of the veggies was a happy surprise. &nbsp;Esp. two big bias-cut slices of celery.
