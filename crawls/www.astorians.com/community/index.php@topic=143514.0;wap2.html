			Hello Astoria!<br /><br />* Do you want to rid our communities of sexual and intimate partner violence (IPV)?<br />* Are you 21 years or older, living in Manhattan, Queens or Brooklyn? <br />* Do you have two 6-hour slots of time per month available to visit the Emergency Department (ED) and support a survivor of this violence? <br />* Are you available to train for 40 hours with experts in the fields of trauma and social justice in October? <br /><br /><br /><br />If yes, please join the Mount Sinai Sexual Assault and Violence Intervention (SAVI) Programâ€™s roster of volunteer ED patient advocates. A video on this opportunity is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a0OiVLXx7s&amp;<br />We are currently recruiting for our Fall 2019 SAVI Volunteer ED Patient Advocate Training. For information, please go here: http://www.tinyurl.com/savirecruit. <br />Questions? Please call 212-423-2140 or email savi@mssm.edu now. <br />YOU can be an early positive support for those on the path towards healing.
