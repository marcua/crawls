				I&#039;m going to the MOMA tomorrow, it&#039;s free Friday.&nbsp; Has anyone ever been, is it a madhouse?&nbsp; It&#039;s open from 4pm to 8pm for free, so how long does one need to spend at the MOMA?&nbsp; Is it too long for a 3 hour time period, or is 2 hours a better estimate?&nbsp; I was going to go at 4pm, but a friend thinks that&#039;s too long for her to spend in a modern museum.&nbsp; I&#039;m just wondering if it&#039;s doable in 2 hours, or will I feel rushed?&nbsp; I can always tell her to meet me later.

				I think 2 hours is about right - after a while it all becomes a blur. There&#039;s a lot to see, but you can always come back another time.

				If you&#039;ve never been to MOMA, I would like to seriously suggest not going tomorrow.<br /><br />The museum is really beautiful with lots of interesting stuff but right now there is a Dali exhibit there and the already packed to the brim free Friday last week was doubly obnoxious because of the extra influx of people coming because they know Dali.<br /><br />Free Fridays aren&#039;t usually too bad, but when you get a big name like Dali as the special exhibit, it draws so so many people.

				Well, that sucks because that&#039;s why I want to go is to see the Dali exhibit.&nbsp; &nbsp;I know what you mean though, I went to see the Pixar exhibit there 2 years ago or so, and paid the $20 to get in, but never enjoyed it due to the enormous amount of people there.&nbsp; It was a rip off.&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;ll just suck it up and go on Monday.&nbsp; At least I can use my student ID now.

				Yeah, I hate to say it, but it was a wreck last Friday. <br /><br />I saw the same Dali exhibit in Cali when I was there for Thanksgiving. It&#039;s an awesome exhibit, but with the crowd that was there last Friday, it was not worth it. I walked in and practically turned around and walked right back out. You couldn&#039;t get anywhere near to any of the paintings or set hangings there, let alone spend the kind of time looking at a Dali like you want to.<br /><br />If you&#039;re going for the Dali exhibit, absolutely, positively, go Monday. Even free is too much to pay when it&#039;s that packed.<br /><br />Now... if you can get there right at 4 and go straight up to Dali, you might have time before it gets crazy. I work on 53rd and Lex so I walked over at 5. Too too too crowded. Maybe earlier or later would have been better.

				Thanks for the insight, Para and Enigma.&nbsp; I think I&#039;ll be going during the week for sure.&nbsp; Crowds are no fun.

				The museum was a mad house with the Dali exhibit and that was on a regular week day. Friday will be packed!&nbsp; The photo exhibit was fantastic and there is also a housing exhibit featuring prefab ideas.&nbsp; Make time to sit in the courtyard garden. Very serene. Pay the $20 and go at an off time. Stroll and enjoy, don&#039;t forget to look around at the interesting architecture of the museum itself.&nbsp;

				just a reminder that the PS1 Warm Up is during the summer saturdays and they offer &quot;complementary admission plus one guest. Must bring government issued I.D. or mail with proof of L.I.C. residency.&quot; but they base it off your zip code and I remember there being quite a few Astoria zips included.<br />http://www.ps1.org/warmup/ (http://www.ps1.org/warmup/)

				dakota,<br /><br />I got around the Astoria/LIC thing by mailing myself a post card with the right zip, but it says LIC instead. I live up at Ditmars and it works every time!

				I live by the Con Ed plant by Ditmars and zip code is 11105.&nbsp; License says Astoria, and I got in free at PS1.&nbsp; If you have a license with that zip, Para, I would just bring that.
