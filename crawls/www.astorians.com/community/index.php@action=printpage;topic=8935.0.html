				I was walking up 21st Avenue yesterday and realized after walking past 26th Avenue that the Irish Famine cemetery is no longer there. Instead there are construction fences and the ground is all dug up. I didn&#039;t have time to search for the permits, but according to Property Shark it still belongs to the RC Mt. Carmel church.<br /><br />Does anyone else have any info?

				Uh, I think you have the wrong spot? If you mean the Mt. Carmel&#039;s cemetary on 21st st its still here and just fine - the construction is just down the road (towards Astoria Blvd) from it, on the other side of the bodega. You want to keep going towards the park, and you&#039;ll see it.

				You mean place on 27th street, just before Astoria Boulvd, if you are coming from Astoria Park.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was gone fast, months ago.&nbsp; I did not know it was Irish Famine Cemetary, you sure?&nbsp; I do know Chuch sold it, which sucks.&nbsp; I used to go in there, took my nephews once, to give&nbsp; them idea of history of area.&nbsp; They had tombstones in horrible shape, some as old as late 1700&#039;s.&nbsp; &nbsp;Most people buried there died around Civil War time.&nbsp; &nbsp;There were&nbsp; family plots, with several generations goig back to farmers from 1820&#039;s, and a few people who died in this century.&nbsp; 95% were from pre-1900.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some tombstones could not be read, some were kept up by family&#039;s.&nbsp; A few were knocked over, a few were sinking way into ground.&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought it would be fixed up by historical society, it was amazing when you realize these people lived here when it was like--well, woods??&nbsp; Farms?&nbsp; <br /><br />So I&#039;m driving&nbsp; of Astoria Park 5 or 6 months ago to show it to a friend, and I see it&#039;s gone. <br />It was there a couple of weeks earlier, then BAM!&nbsp; Developers started building.&nbsp; Nothing in newspapers, just gone.&nbsp; Don&#039;t know what they did with bodies.&nbsp; It should have been made a landmark.

				Ooohkay- either there were two of these in Astoria, or again, you have the wrong place. This one: http://www.astorialic.org/topics/cemeteries/irish_p.php is still just fine - pass it every day, in fact I can see it from my window as I type this.

				It is possible that I&#039;m wrong - esp. if you are seeing it from your window!<br /><br />The construction I&#039;m seeing that is new is right next to our &quot;triangle&quot; building (on the north side of it) - the tall white one with the onion dome. I know that construction fence wasn&#039;t there November 11 when GAHS gave their Old Astoria tour. Seeing it threw me off as it is a really big site.

				Yeah that&#039;s the old gas station - down the road a bit - walk past the construction fence and the bodega and the cemetary is still there. <br /><br />Lots of construction in the area - like the rest of Astoria, I suppose.

				Thank you for clarifying all of this, everyone!&nbsp; I was sad to think the Irish Famine Cemetery was destroyed.&nbsp; Glad to know it&#039;s still here.

				The Irish Famine cemetery that is still around is on 21st STREET at the corner of 26th Avenue.&nbsp; It is almost equidistant between the Triboro Bridge and Astoria Blvd.&nbsp; It is the one that is in the link Melee posted.<br /><br />Bentleys Dad, are you talking about the tiny, closed-off cemetery that is on 20th Road and about 35th St.?*&nbsp; There is no cemetery on 21st AVENUE between 37th and 38th Streets -- that block is completely taken up on the north side by IS 141 (http://www.schoolsk-12.com/New-York/Astoria/IS141STEINWAYSCHOOL.html), and across the street it is residential.<br /><br />This page (http://www.forgotten-ny.com/STREET%20SCENES/Astoria/astoria.html) on Forgotten NY has pics of a couple of Astoria cemeteries, including one that is described as &quot;St. George&#039;s churchyard on 12th St between Astoria Blvd. and 27th Avenue&quot;.&nbsp; It sounds like it is St. George&#039;s that is gone.<br /><br />*ETA:&nbsp; Here (http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE2D81038F934A2575AC0A9669C8B63&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/C/Civil%20War%20(US)%20(1861-65)) is an article about that cemetery.&nbsp; The article mistakenly says that it is on the corner of 20th Road and 35th Avenue; it is at 20th Road and 35th STREET.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; Another bit (http://www.forgotten-ny.com/CEMETERIES/queenscems/morequeens.html) on the Lawrence Family Graveyard.
