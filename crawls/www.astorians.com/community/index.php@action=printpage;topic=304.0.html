				Greetings All!!!<br /><br />My coven is hosting Long Island's Pagan Beltane Festival on April 30 in Wantagh Park, Long Island. &nbsp;Save the date, as we have many workshops and lectures planned in addition to dancing the maypole, a drumming circle, and more to yet be arranged. &nbsp;<br /><br />We still need vendors and speakers !!! If you would like to vend or speak please let me know. &nbsp;Here is the website:<br /><br />http://www.geocities.com/nancyvenus/Beltane2.html<br /><br />More on Beltane here:<br /><br />http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/7280/beltane.html<br /><br />++++++++++<br />Annwyn

				:twisted: <br />As Jethro Tull said in &quot;Cup of Wonder&quot;<br /><br />May I make my fond excuses<br />for the lateness of the hour,<br />but we accept your invitation, and we bring you Beltane's flower.<br />For the May Day is the great day, sung along the old straight track.<br />And those who ancient lines did lay<br />will heed the song that calls them back.<br />Pass the word and pass the lady, pass the plate to all who hunger.<br />Pass the wit of ancient wisdom, pass the cup of crimson wonder.<br /><br />Ask the green man where he comes from, ask the cup that fills with red.<br />Ask the old grey standing stones that show the sun its way to bed.<br />Question all as to their ways,<br />and learn the secrets that they hold.<br />Walk the lines of nature's palm<br />crossed with silver and with gold.<br />Pass the cup and pass the lady, pass the plate to all who hunger.<br />Pass the wit of ancient wisdom, pass the cup of crimson wonder.<br /><br />Join in black December's sadness,<br />lie in August's welcome corn.<br />Stir the cup that's ever-filling<br />with the blood of all that's born.<br />But the May Day is the great day, sung along the old straight track.<br />And those who ancient lines did lay<br />will heed this song that calls them back.<br />Pass the word and pass the lady, pass the plate to all who hunger.<br />Pass the wit of ancient wisdom, pass the cup of crimson wonder.

				Hey all!!<br /><br />I would volunteer to take any interested parties but I have to get there at an ungodly hour and stay until an ungodly hour<br />(set up and clean up). &nbsp;<br />I think if you come with me you would probably regret it later!<br />&nbsp;:( <br />Not sure if you all are thinking of vending, but here is the info if you are. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />If you wish you may share a table if you know somewone else who has things to sell. &nbsp; But we do not sell half tables. All checks received must be for $50.<br /><br />Please send a Check for $50.00 to: Nancy Callow, PO Box, 158, Valley Steam, NY 11582. Make check out to Nancy Callow/Copper Cauldron. &nbsp;Please state your name(s) / name of business(es) , what you will be selling. &nbsp;You will be sent a vendor # upon receipt of your check.<br /><br />Just some &nbsp;additional info because I know i will forget: &nbsp;If you do attend remember to bring water to drink, sunscreen, and wear layers. &nbsp;The park is on the water. &nbsp;Bring some food to share...there is a HUGE potluck feast afterwards. <br /><br />)0(
