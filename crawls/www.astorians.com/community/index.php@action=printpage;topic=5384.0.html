				i&#039;m convinced the blind accordion guy can see...he always walks around my feet without hitting them with his stick. arguments about being used to the train cars can be made as to why he always knows where the poles are, but my feet?<br /><br /><br />

				I seriously did hear he had a foot fetish, not sure from who though.&nbsp; &nbsp;Apparently in the summer, he sits down next to women and has tried to touch their feet.&nbsp; Or something like that. All I know is he is creepy, and I try to stay out of his way.

				I don&#039;t&#039; know about all that foot stuff, but I do believe he is blind. I have done some work with blind individuals and he exhibits the behaviors of someone that has been taught how to maneuver in a sighted world. Also, he may have some sight that helps him get around even if it isn&#039;t functional sight. Either way I appreciate his music as the effort is there, he gets my buck.

				There is a guy an who sings songs from the 40&#039;s and 50&#039;s on the N and W line, usually later at night.&nbsp; His voice is very unique, almost sounds like an old record, complete with scratches!&nbsp; He does this interesting &quot;wind-up&quot; thing with his arm, sometimes, right before he sings!&nbsp; Does anyone know who I am referring to?&nbsp; Maybe he&#039;s just in my imagination!&nbsp; I&#039;m usually coming from a heavy night of drinking in Manhattan when I see him&nbsp; :idiot: :crazy:

				There&#039;s a really great group I&#039;ve heard both in the Union Square station and I think near Times Square as well. Lots of brass instruments - I think they even have a tuba, if I&#039;m not mistaken. I always stop to listen to them. <br /><br />I heard a male vocal group in the 53rd/Lex station on the E/V platform the other night. They had incredible harmony.

				Humm not to sound like a grouch but I really don&#039;t want to listen to someone sing or preform while I am on the train or in the station. <br /><br />There is however a doo-wop group that I heard at 59th Street and Lexington avenue that was quite good and they weren&#039;t really loud which was nice.

Since 1985, MTA Arts for Transit has managed the MUNY program presenting quality music to the commuting public. At present, more than 100 soloists and groups participate in MUNY providing over 150 weekly performances at 25 locations throughout the transit system.<br /><br />***<br />&nbsp;:|<br />Hey grouch, I can appreciate that. Lots of times I wish the musicians would go away. And amplification underground really bothers me.<br /><br />But more often, I feel beastly soothed by the surprising music work found below ground.&nbsp; :angel:

				The Blind guy on the N is definitely blind. I saw him slam into the side of the train when he mis calculated the location of the doors. He doesn&#039;t have an uncanny sense about other things though. Who was that super hero that was blind but had some sonar or something like that? Anyway, I like the Peruvian pan flute guys and I saw the Saw lady once. She was pretty good.
