				You know, I usually empathize with the noise complaints here, but it&#039;s the 4th of July, and 11:30 on a Saturday night isn&#039;t even all that late, particularly on a day like the 4th of July. I live near Astoria Heights Playground and, at 2AM, am still hearing a firework here and there, but whatever.. it&#039;s the 4th of July. As long as they&#039;re not shooting fireworks into my window, I don&#039;t mind the revelry for tonight.<br /><br />I watched the legal fireworks display from a rooftop on the lower east side and, as usual, got a full view of all sorts of illegal ones being set off from rooftops all over the city. At one point, there was a helicopter circling overhead with a searchlight shining down. Not sure if they were trying to catch/scare the fireworks culprits or if they were looking for something else.

				one (or more) of my nice considerate neighbors along the Broadway corridor (near 34th Street) is setting off fireworks, every 15 minutes or so.&nbsp; I keep getting almost to sleep, then woken again with an agitated cat.&nbsp; It&#039;s 3 am for god&#039;s sake - go to bed and let your neighbors get some rest too.

				I lived in Washington Heights for about 4 years. What I heard and saw last night was nothing in comparison to what I endured in years past. <br /><br />I&#039;m not unsympathetic because I know how it is when you&#039;re tired and need to go to sleep because you&#039;ve got something to do the nest day, but trust me, we&#039;ve got it good out here ...

				I do remember it being a lot worse up near 125th Street in the Northern end of Morningside Heights when I lived there - but the fool setting off fireworks until close to 6 a.m. did not bring back nice memories.

				it was about 2 pm to 11 pm or so here, with a few leftovers at about 1 am up in ditmars.<br /><br />some folks on my block were having a grand old time. i was more concerned about the hitting trees and damaging the street light - or my wife&#039;s car - and related idiocy than the noise. it didn&#039;t seem like anyone lost any fingers, at least.<br /><br />i figure it&#039;s a bit like the whole bass car thing - it lets you know who still lives with their moms. :)

				Around 1 a.m. there was someone shooting stuff off in the backyards between 33rd St and 34th Street (bet. 30th and 31st Aves). People were yelling out the windows, arguing with whoever was shooting the stuff off (sounded like a kid). Threats to call the police. About 10 minutes later, started hearing police sirens, and then no more fireworks.<br /><br />There were sparks flying right outside our windows -- definitely not safe in the narrow backyards where there&#039;s laundry hanging and open windows.

				I wonder if those were some of the ones I was hearing.&nbsp; I think the ones I heard were coming from 33rd Street between Broadway and 34th Avenue.&nbsp; I heard some yelling - folks were not pleased to get the &quot;treats&quot; all night long and from folks who probably did not have to go to work or church in the morning.&nbsp;
