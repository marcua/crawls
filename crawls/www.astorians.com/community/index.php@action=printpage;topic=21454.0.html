				WABC ran a story about two little girls who were confronted by a sexual predator in the elevator of one girl&#039;s building yesterday in Astoria.&nbsp; 911 was called, and the 114th <strong><em><em>failed to show up</em></em></strong>-even after 3-4 calls! The little girl&#039;s mother finally walked down to the precinct to file a complaint! This is beyond outrageous, especially after seeing how brazen the attack was from the building surveillance video: <br />http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news%2Flocal%2Fnew_york&amp;id=8296344 (http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news%2Flocal%2Fnew_york&amp;id=8296344) <br />Way to go, 114th. Glad to know we can <del>always</del> <strong><em>never</em></strong> count on you!<br />I already called Vallone&#039;s office, for whatever good that will do.&nbsp; We need action, and fast!

				There is picketing all over NYC and there is a groper in Manhattan as well.&nbsp; Regardless, the 114th comes down the street every single morning looking for expired registrations.&nbsp; I believe very much that priorities have changed.&nbsp; It is all about traffic these days.

How many of you don&#039;t contribute a penny towards your health care like Verizon workers - I know I have to contribute?&nbsp; Read the article that I am linking below from the liberal NY Times and let me know how many people would love to have such a poor contract in these times<br /><br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/08/business/in-verizon-strike-landlines-and-fios.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc

(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJhPLGMhRuQ&amp;feature=related)<br /><br />As to something that actually relates to the thread topic, there is no excuse for slow response time in the case of a sexual predator.&nbsp; I had just the opposite experience tonight.&nbsp; I was on my street and there was a guy passed out covered in vomit as I was walking to the gym.&nbsp; Some people were conferring about how to help the guy.&nbsp; I came back two hours later and he was still there.&nbsp; Called 311 to ask what, if anything, I should do.&nbsp; They put me through to 911, 911 put me through to FDNY, and within a minute there was a firetruck, ambulance, and cruiser from 114.&nbsp; Go figure.

				Bill I called you out on your comment because I found your post to be offensive. So how is it that I am the one that is out of line or mean spirited?

				&nbsp; Let&#039;s get this thread back on track folks.&nbsp; We were discussing the girl who was attacked and the response by the 114.&nbsp; This is too important to the well being of our community and its residents.&nbsp; Let&#039;s ease up a little on attacking each other over something as unimportant as one&#039;s comments and choice of words.

				Way to hijack a thread - I agree with hellgateviking, let&#039;s get back to the topic at hand. <br /><br /><br />It doesn&#039;t surprise me that they never responded. In late spring I had called 911 twice to report an intoxicated man who was in the middle of Broadway trying to hail cabs by basically jumping in front of them.&nbsp; :shocked:&nbsp; The police never showed, even after I had called them back to report that the same man had been clipped by a cab speeding away from him. The poor guy was laying in the road until a few passerby&#039;s finally helped him to his feet and escorted him to the bus stop nearby. <br /><br /><br />I would&#039;ve went out to help him myself but I was in my apartment at the time I witnessed all of this. It was also really late and my nephew was asleep in the next room. Thank goodness for the good Samaritans who helped him out of the road, who knows what would&#039;ve happened next otherwise!<br /><br /><br />Whatever the case, what the 114th did was utterly unforgivable! If there is ever a time that the police should be prompt it&#039;s when a child is in need! I can&#039;t imagine what those poor girls and their mothers are going through after this incident....&nbsp; :sad:

				Can we get any important info here? Like, where was the video taken. The video image is good enogh for recognition but is there more video? The 114 not responding should be a career ending event. Unfortuntely, we don&#039;t do that anymore. If this scumbag is caught by anyone but the police, it should be him BEGGING that the cops be called.
