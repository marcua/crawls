				I have heard that there is one in the area. I haven't bowled in ages either, and would love to go sometime. I'll see what I can find out about where one might be.

				Indeed, there is a bowling alley in Astoria. &nbsp;Never been there, but I've walked past. &nbsp;I believe there's a cafe in there too -- I see people sitting down and eating. &nbsp;Don't quote me on this, but I think it's on Steinway Street VERY far north, around 20th Avenue somewhere. &nbsp;Truly the middle of nowhere, but a tolerable walk from the Ditmars stop.

				I been in there last week.<br /><br />Maric Lanes. It's near the road to Rikers (Hazen).<br /><br />http://www.mariclanes.com/<br /><br />Kind of a long way to go for the more riverside Astorians. It's a (non-Rikers Q101) busride to what feels like nowhere. To go this far you might as well take the Q66 to the 34th Avenue Lanes in Jackson Heights/Woodside, or else the Q104 to those lanes in Sunnyside. <br /><br />http://34thavenuelanes.amfcenters.com/

				I don't know if it's open. &nbsp;I rode by it on my bike a month or so ago. &nbsp;I THINK it's on 31th ave just on the other side of the BQE. &nbsp;I suppose that's NOT Astoria... but it wasn't far. &nbsp; Does anyone know the place I&quot;m talking about? &nbsp;Is it an operating alley?

				there had been bowling on Broadway recently before i moved here in 1997. there is still a BOWL sign on Broadway, near Crescent. you can see it above and between the Famous Brands place and the Pastry place next door:<br /><br />http://sorabji.com/exp/bowl_astoria.jpg<br /><br />i have seen the doors to the old bowling alley open of late and there appears to be some sort of construction type activity down there, so maybe bowling on Broadway is coming back! i would think the lanes are still there, unless they're turning the space into something different.<br /><br />i think my average was a 180 or so, high game a 208. <br /><br />-mt

				i've never spent much time there. a couple of times, while wandering around that area looking for other things, i walked in to maric lanes and then left. i remember looking for one of those megatouch game consoles so i could feed my photohunt and/or tai play addictions. can't remember if maric lanes has one of those megatouch things or not but there are a couple of nice new flatscreen ones at the poolhall nearby.

				I would love to go bowling. Haven't gone bowling in a long time. I used to go bowling every weekend when I lived upstate in ithaca, We would start at about 10 and bowl till 2pm and the drinks where free and the disck ball played with your eyes while you tried to bowl. Good times. Miss that. I just finally settles down my dart craze two weeks ago. Hmmm, I think next time I go upstate in Septemeber I am going to go bowling again. Yeah. Thats an Idea. But hey if you guys find a inexpensive place to go bowling and want to go as a group or something I'm game for that to.
