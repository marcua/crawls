				This may sound like a dumb question, but is it an unrealistic expectation to get an apartment in Astoria that is free from rodents (mice, rats, bed bugs, roaches, etc)?&nbsp; Even really nice apartments...?<br /><br />Thanks! :)<br /><br />

				Yes.&nbsp; Apartments in Astoria are notoriously vermin-ridden.&nbsp; As you noted, we even have species of rodents such as bed bugs and roaches that are found nowhere else on earth, except perhaps in the Fire Swamp.

I can tell you that my 2k +/mo apartment (my old place) had its fair share of bugs (apart from bed bugs the very extremely rare roach and occasionaly a silverfish) and our last few months there was a war against a persistent mouse. doesn&#039;t matter how much you pay, you have to keep the place clean and so does your neighbors and landlord/super. this is nyc, those bastards are everywhere.

				Wifey and I have lived in Astoria just over two years now, and we&#039;ve only *seen* (they could be lurking in the walls, under the bed, etc.) one roach and, only last week, our first mouse (we live in the basement of a three family house).&nbsp; Of course now that I say this, we&#039;ll have an onslaught of filthy vermin, but I just wanted to let you know that not all of Astoria is crawling with pests!&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)

				There are also never any sort of bugs in the country either, no spiders, no silverfish, no mosquitoes, and definitely no beetles.<br /><br />Seriously though, bugs and rodents are everywhere.&nbsp; Keep a clean apartment or move to a private house with no dirty neighbors, including yourself.

				I think the age of the building has a lot to do with it.&nbsp; If you live someplace old and leaky, the dampness is going to attract vermin, probably moreso than messy neighbors (although I&#039;m sure that doesn&#039;t help matters).&nbsp; I had a roach problem in my old place, which was full of leaks.&nbsp; Now I am in a brand new building and have yet to see anything, although I figure it&#039;s only a matter of time before I will.<br /><br />

The only other apartment on our floor (bottom floor) belongs to the landlord&#039;s son and daughter-in-law. They definitely keep their apartment clean - they leave their door open all the time so I can see just how clean it is. However, we definitely have a bug problem of some sort. We&#039;ve tried boric acid and such, but it seemed to only made a dent for a short while - never eliminated the problem. However, the building behind us is being renovated as are both buildings on either side of us. Our building was just renovated, so it sucks to think that construction in those other buildings could be the cause of the problem.

				Your best bet is to rent a brand new apartment in a brand new apartment building. (They&#039;re popping up all over Astoria).<br /><br />If not, you will have search for all the little holes where your walls meet your floors &amp; ceilings AND beneath all your sinks where the pipes enter the room AND where all the cables come through your walls AND all along your windows and CAULK them closed.<br /><br />This way, the bugs cannot enter your apartment.&nbsp; This has worked for my &amp; my roomates place.<br /><br />Good Luck!

				You can buy the large size roach traps &quot;Combat&quot; I think they are called. Just the right size for water bug entry. Sometimes we get one or two in the basement during damp summer weather. There isn&#039;t any food down there for them to be attracted to. I think it&#039;s just the slight dampness-or the jumbo size roach traps that they&#039;re attracted to. I heard they come up through the pipes and drains. I usually see them dead, so I think the traps work. I change them before the warm weather arrives.<br />Bartunek on 23rd Ave might sell them.

				Im a native floridian, where we have cockroaches/waterbugs LITERALLY 4&quot; long. terrifying. 1 There ARE ways to stop them...namely<br /><br />1) get steel wool and plug up ALL your pipes leading to and from the radiators and under all your sinks. Shove the steel wool in the holes. 9 times out of 10 this is where they come from. <br /><br />2) have either you or your landlord caulk all the seals of your apartment, including along the windows, baseboards, underneath sinks and behind toilets. COMBAT makes a caulk/insect repellent that worked pretty well in my old apartment. once my landlord used it in the bathroom, we saw considerably fewer bugs (they werent eliminated entirely but we maybe had 1 a month) <br /><br />3) NEVER EVER EVER LEAVE ANY water whatsover in sinks or tubs! Get a squeegie for your shower and wipe down the water when you leave the shower.&nbsp; Keep your sinks DRY; wipe down with a towel when not using! Do dishes IMMEDIATELY and NEVER EVER let them sit in the sink! <br /><br />4)make sure your screens are tight and fit your windows properly. Use that weather stripping to seal up any cracks (thsi will also help to keep heat in)<br /><br />5) COMBAT TRAPS. Everywhere.&nbsp; Use boric acid...but only if you dont have pets (toxic!) <br /><br />6) never ever keep any cardboard in your house; bugs DO hide in there. Curb it immediately. Get rid of any cardboard you may be using as storage and switch them out for clear plastic containers or duffell bags. <br /><br /><br />good luck...<br />
