				So what&#039;s with the slew or &quot;reporters&quot; on here lately wanting people to contact them on various topics???<br /><br />Are they legit??&nbsp; &nbsp;Has anyone contacted them??<br /><br />Seems suspicious to me that there are multiple &quot;reporters&quot; here all of a sudden.

				Hi everybody,<br /><br /><br />It&#039;s not a scam. I am a grad student reporter from the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism and am just trying to use all the means available to me to get in touch with locals and folks from Astoria. In addition to posting on here, I attend community board meetings and speak with district leaders about issues that are important to those in your community and am only trying to lend an objective local voice on bigger topics, be it trash, bedbugs, smashed car windows, or transit issues (I am actually working on an article on the QM22 bus line right now). <br /><br /><br />I appreciate any feedback you guys give me, and of course if you don&#039;t want to give out a name I can honor that. But I can&#039;t guarantee you&#039;ll make it into my article.<br /><br /><br />If you have any additional queries you&#039;d like to speak about personally, please let me know! I promise, I&#039;m not trying to get money from you guys or scam anybody. Just a journalist trying to make it in the world :) <br /><br /><br />tchao@journalism.cuny.edu<br /><br /><br />Best,<br /><br /><br />Terry

				I was only really bothered by Terry&#039;s initial post, which asked for a compelling, poverty-related story.<em> That </em>seemed pretty lazy to me. Go pound the pavement and talk to locals face-to-face. After walking a few blocks you&#039;re bound to find a story, instead of going about it backwards--deciding what the story is and trying to find sources.&nbsp;

				You guys make good - and humorous points.&nbsp; But I do indeed have my suspicions about the lazy pseudo budding journalist who will be the one in the coffee shop tapping on his laptop instead of being out in the community working for the story.&nbsp; But it&#039;s true - talking to us about issues is a good way to help formulate a story.&nbsp; So long as it&#039;s not the only basis for information.&nbsp; Maybe Astorians.com should consider adding a media area to the site so journalists can post issues they&#039;re researching and Astorians &quot;members&quot; can go at will and help out with information?&nbsp; &nbsp;It does seem to interfere with our discussions of Joe Journalist is going to pop into every thread and ask that he be contacted to discuss this or that further.&nbsp; But I can see how making these communications possible can benefit both a serious journalist and the community at large.

				I really like the idea TJT just posited about a dedicated section for journalists. I am 100% not in favor of just using forums as a means for a story, I use it only as a supplement to generate ideas and perhaps lead to real connections. I have no intention of interrupting your forums (though I can see that it does disturb the thread a bit when I interject. Such it the risk I must take.) If there was a specific section we could use, I would restrict my posting to that area.<br /><br /><br />Thanks so much! This discussion was a great way to talk about how we as journalists should interact. As the field is changing, so must we adapt to using technology at our advantage. Like I said, that doesn&#039;t mean I am spouting comments here and there as the only sources for stories. <br /><br /><br />PS: for the poverty story, I was assigned the topic, so me getting to choose what issues I wanted to focus on was not up for discussion. Otherwise, I would no question be on the streets finding out what stories needed to be covered. <br /><br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br /><br />Terry

				They are&nbsp; not lazy, I think they want people to pm them so they can meet them to talk to them, or set up phone conversation.&nbsp; &nbsp;They are just&nbsp; using internet community group as a start.&nbsp; Most are still students, they can&#039;t show up at city hall and ask to see mayor.&nbsp;
