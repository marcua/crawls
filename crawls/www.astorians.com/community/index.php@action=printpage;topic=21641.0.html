				The only way to stop them from coming in is to use caulk and foam.&nbsp; Use it in every single crack you see..pipes, underneath the sink etc.&nbsp; Once this is done get the exterminator in there.&nbsp; You will never see a water bug or a spider again.&nbsp;

				I saw one over the weekend for the first time in several months.&nbsp; We had a horrible run of them in the early summer despite spraying and taking other preventive measures.&nbsp; I generally expect I may see one or two when the weather changes seasonally, especially when it rains.&nbsp; Given the weather last week (lots of rain, cooler temps), I wasn&#039;t surprised.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t have pets you can put down boric acid in the areas you suspect they&#039;re entering from.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t kill them instantly, but they will die if they walk through it.&nbsp; Also try to plug (steel wool works well) or caulk any holes/gaps along baseboards/walls/radiator pipes.<br />

				Waterbugs have been here for a loooong time , this amazing weather we have had wont stop them . Maybe when it freezes up , but thats not anytime soon .&nbsp; &nbsp;You should invest in some bug spray , dont expect your landlord to do it unless you have a super . If you wait for others to take care of the problem , you might wait a long time while those roaches are making roach babies .

The two times this summer I forgot to plug a drain up, THAT&#039;s when I saw the bugs. So, I am convinced they travel via pipe. They are awful! Every now and then I think I&#039;ll spot one out of the corner of my eye, and I bolt up, and scan the room. I always feel on alert in the summer. Even when I come home, I do a little &quot;floor scan&quot;.

				When did the weather get colder, at least from a bug&#039;s perspective?&nbsp; We haven&#039;t dropped lower than the 60s yet, except, IIRC, one or two nights when we dipped into the high 50s.<br /><br />It&#039;s still bug weather, and with all the rain we&#039;ve had, it&#039;s GREAT bug weather.<br />

				No matter how much research I&#039;ve done through the years, I still can&#039;t tell the difference between waterbugs and roaches. Whatever - they&#039;re both disgusting. I had a pretty big problem with roaches last spring. (An exterminator said that they were, in fact, roaches.) Once he came through and dusted, caulked up some gaps around cabinets and whatnot in the kitchen - I was free of them. <br /><br />I was hoping to be free of them this season, no such luck.&nbsp; The sticky strips really do work - I manage to catch quite a few. I leave two or three strips under both the oven and the fridge. I killed one with spray just last night. And killed another a few weeks ago. The other two apartments in the house don&#039;t have issues with them. I&#039;m OCD clean - not sure why they keep coming back, and to MY apartment. They&#039;re repulsive.&nbsp;

				We never had roaches in my house growing up (Ditmars area), other creepy crawlers yes, but not roaches or waterbugs. <br /><br /><br />But about 15-20 years ago, waterbugs appeared and now everyone I know has them in their house or apartment to some degree. It&#039;s less a problem in the colder months but when it gets warm and humid, they tend to go inside buildings.<br /><br /><br />One time, I was out all day and when I returned home late on a particularly hot and very humid night and flicked on the light, there were about 10-12 of them flying around my bedroom. I&#039;m not usually freaked out seeing one or two but 10+ was really gross.

				<br />I&#039;ve lived in NYC for 15 years now.&nbsp; Never saw any waterbugs at my place in Harlem for 7 years.&nbsp; In Glendale, Queens, in a REALLY nice totally gut reno&#039;d house, I saw one waterbug in 5 years.&nbsp; Was in a new luxury bldg. on 21st Street in Astoria for 2 years and had no waterbugs.<br /><br />Now...I&#039;m living by Steinway and 21st Ave in a small apt building that is pretty nicely kept BUT I suspect the LL who lives on the first floor has lots of &#039;stuff&#039; in his apartment and I also know the basement levels garages are FULL of stuff...which I&#039;m sure doesn&#039;t help matters.&nbsp; Here in this building I&#039;ve noticed that in the summer months, we seem to get waterbugs.&nbsp; I&#039;d say over a three month period in the summer, I might see a total of 10 or so in the hallways.&nbsp; I think I saw one in my own apt last year, and I saw one about a week ago.&nbsp; Otherwise it&#039;s not a real problem in my particular apt. as I paid a handyman guy last year to seal up all the tiny cracks along floor/baseboards, under sink, behind stove, behind fridge, etc.&nbsp; I also put grey felt weather strips under my apt. door to help fill the space.&nbsp; I think all this helps.<br /><br />I also keep my place super clean.... though I understand that when it comes to water bugs they will often show up regardless...

It&#039;s less a problem in the colder months but when it gets warm and humid, they tend to go inside buildings.<br /><br /><br />One time, I was out all day and when I returned home late on a particularly hot and very humid night and flicked on the light, there were about 10-12 of them flying around my bedroom. I&#039;m not usually freaked out seeing one or two but 10+ was really gross.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Flying waterbugs are really scary. I hope I never see one
