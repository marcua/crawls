				I am not a beer drinker either (love cocktails and drink specials!) but I feel it would be nice to be outside, and also at a place that is easily accessible by train or walking for everybody. I like the Hells Gate Social, though it might be more convenient to meet at a centrally located place since we probably wont all be coming from the same area in Astoria. What do you guys think?<br /><br />Love the Duality piece J!

				Thanks, Sambarella. Glad you like piece. My other stuff is on my website and I hope to add more work soon&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />I like the idea of meeting outside since the weather is really nice. i was out by some outdoor cafes near 30 ave..that have a lot of outdoor space and don&#039;t seem crowded on a weekend afternoon. i think one of them is called Raza Cafe. i&#039;ll scout it out this weekend and get the name. I read about Hells Gate but it might be harder to really chat if there&#039;s a lot going on...and it sounds like a pretty lively place! probably a great place to meet after the first meet-up.

				today i scouted out those places as promised and i found two possible venues near 30th avenue. <br /><br />The first one is Park Kafe, on 30 avenue and 30 street and is right across the street from Athens Square. they have outdoor tables but the inside has a lot of loungy chairs and the space is nice and wide open. it wasn&#039;t crowded at the time and they were blaring any looud music and looked pretty relaxing. the outdoor section probably isn&#039;t as nice as the indoor section; it seems kind of cramped the sidewalk. <br /><br />The second place that is pretty much across the street and is also across from Athens Square is Plaza Lounge. It has a better outdoor cafe scene and a better view of the plaza. It&#039;s also pretty roomy out and has a nice relaxing atmosphere. It looks pretty conducive to chilling out and talking. that&#039;s on 30th avenue and 29th street. <br /><br />Let me know what you guys think and then we can set a date!

				I&#039;d vote for Plaza lounge.&nbsp; They&#039;ve got good service and a nice vibe there.&nbsp; The customer service at Park is a bit lacking, but the place is comfortable.&nbsp; I&#039;ll meet ya wherever :)

				Hey I&#039;m up for a casual gathering. Just to chat about art and its various incarnations would be, I think, ideal for the diverse group we have on here. I nominate Waltz for the spot, too.. They already have a meeting there (or used to) every first Thursday (I think) called BQWAK, or something like that, that was a gathering of artists from the bk/qn areas- where medium or skill didn&#039;t matter, just a sense of collaboration of ideas or offering of constructive criticism.<br /><br />That&#039;s what I feel the meeting should be all about. Diversity rules.

				Hey Preston!&nbsp; A casual gathering is just what I am thinking.&nbsp; It would be nice to meet other artists in Astoria, regardless of skill level and not for critcism of each others work.&nbsp; The poin is to make new connections and look for ways to collaborate.&nbsp; Get to know eachother and get ideas brewing about what we can do together to get our art out in our neighborhood&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; <br /><br />Diversity does rule!&nbsp;&nbsp; I been to Waltz its really cute and cosy in there, I like it. I am always up for exploring new spots as well as I am trying to get acquainted with my new &#039;hood&#039;&nbsp; :wink:&nbsp;Have you been to the Plaza spot already?

				Hey Sambarella-<br /><br />No, I haven&#039;t been to the Plaza yet.. I&#039;m just a fan of Czech beer :) Plus they have the cocktails and liquor for the non-beerlovers. Sitting outside at one of those picnic tables under the huge trees just makes me feel aaaah.

				For some reason, I thought we were meeting up this Sunday at 2pm.&nbsp; &nbsp;I read the posts wrong.&nbsp; I have a function to go to around 5pm, but I can still make the mixer if it&#039;s before that (like 2pm&nbsp; :-))&nbsp; But if that&#039;s not convenient for everyone, don&#039;t worry about me.&nbsp; I&#039;ll see you at the next one&nbsp; &nbsp;:-(

				Hey Daisy and Newell!&nbsp; We just missed each other!&nbsp; It dawned on me that we should have had a sign so we could have known how to find eachother.&nbsp; Where you wearing a backpack Daisy and Newell were you tall with glasses?&nbsp; I told the waitress that we were waiting for people that might show up in case anyone asked her but she just gave us a look as if that was too much of a task&nbsp; :-P.&nbsp; I am glad everyone had fun although we missed eachother. <br /><br />J its was nice meeting you girl!! Newell I checked out your flickr page, I really dig your photographs&nbsp; :-) Daisy nice animation skills woman!!<br />

				Thanks, Sambarella!&nbsp; &nbsp;Yup, that was us!&nbsp; We asked a couple people if they were from Astorians, but got a lot of weird looks.&nbsp; Oh well, there&#039;s always next time.

				Hi hi,<br /><br />I :smitten: being creative and am trying to get back into making art - mainly painting, detailed colored-pencil drawings, photography - and I figured you all would be the best people to ask: Where do you get your inspiration?!&nbsp; I want SO badly to get back to how I was in high school, when I made some artworks that I am truly proud of, but I don&#039;t know where to start??&nbsp; Help me, please!?&nbsp; What do I draw, paint? I know you can&#039;t tell me exactly what to paint, but how do I even go about finding something?&nbsp; How do I know what I need to buy, as far as types of paper (for oil-based, or acrylic, or pencils), textured paper, or canvases?&nbsp; High school was great because we generally were given the projects and all the supplies we&#039;d need. <br /><br />Any advice is very very welcome.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks&nbsp; :-D

				Good question. I too had fallen into a slump and felt I&#039;d never recover and be able to photograph again. Then I started reading &#8220;The Artists Way&#8221;, and slowly began frequenting museums, going to plays, concerts, watching more movies, reading more and buying more music. It was right there, in front of me. So close, yet so far.

				my sister loved the Artist&#039;s Way. she thought it was very helpful and inspiring. <br /><br />one thing might help is to take an art class at a community college. that&#039;s how i got into watercolor. i learned what materials i needed to buy and how to work with the paint. if you take a class or two, you not only get some techniques down but being with other students can be very inspiring. <br /><br />the other thing that really helped was when i bought a digital camera. i take it everywhere and always find subject matter for painting.
