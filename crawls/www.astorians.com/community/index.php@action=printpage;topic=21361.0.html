				hi! I am currently renting a 1bdrm within the Central Astoria LLC complex on 21st ave, closer to the water. I have actually been here for 2 years however I feel the area is changing. I know the reputation it had (or may still have) ie, being low income families, a little gritty, etc, however, the area is safe despite some instances in the neighborhood.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />All apts are renovated for new tentants and they seem to take care of the properties, so no complaints there. My apt is very nice, clean, and haven&#039;t had any problems. The prices are reasonable, still in line with the astoria market but I do see a decent amount of turnover.&nbsp; I largely think it is due to the noise levels from &quot;kids&quot; and older greek men hanging out all day and all night on the street corners. It is a little obnoxious in my opinion but harmeless.<br />&nbsp;<br />The management company doesn&#039;t interact much and frankly, they have awful communication skills - Are there any other tenants that feel the same way? Most of my neighbors have been there for decades but they do not have a lot of great things to say. Essentially they stay for the cheap(er) rent.&nbsp; Thought I would post to see if anyone had similiar experiences or additional thoughts/feedback. <br />&nbsp;<br />I love living by the park and do not mind the walk to the train but I have been toying with the idea of moving.&nbsp; Apartment rental prices are getting higher and higher though!

				Has anyone experienced problems with safety issues of their maintenance crew driving around in the golf carts. They drive on sidewalks and drive in opposite directions to oncoming traffic. They are not legal to drive on city streets and so they should be following traffic laws unless they want to risk having them taken away from their property management. Its for their convenience but it should not be placing the community residents in harmâ€™s way.
