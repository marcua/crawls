				Agnanti opened up a cafe across the street on Ditmars. They&#039;re having an opening party right now, there&#039;s a huge spread of food for everyone. I chatted with a woman behind the counter named Faye about the plans for the place. They have a menu of pastries, panini, bureks, coffee, and they&#039;ll have a liquor license soon. They&#039;ll be opening at 7am, which makes it a great new breakfast stop. I think this is such a great addition to the neighborhood. And with all the foot traffic that heads down Ditmars towards the park, I think they&#039;ll do well. I&#039;m really excited about this!

				Here&#039;s a google streetmap view: (http://bit.ly/PQhHve) They are in the location that used to be &quot;Istra&quot; in between the car service and pet store. 19-23A Ditmars Blvd appears to be the address.<br /><br />I also snapped a crummy phone picture of the menu this morning: (http://bit.ly/RscJrJ)<br /><br />I went in this morning and ordered an iced coffee. &quot;Would you like a Greek iced coffee?&quot; asked the girl behind the counter. &quot;Sure,&quot; I said, &quot;what&#039;s that?&quot; She said, &quot;It&#039;s stronger.&quot; Oh man, she wasn&#039;t kidding. It&#039;s like iced espresso with lots of foam. I&#039;m completely wired right now. I&#039;m not sure I can drink one of those everyday. My husband got a croissant and said they were good.<br />

Very cool that they&#039;re baking their own croissants, and I&#039;m also very interested in their mini boureks.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">I wonder if their &quot;Greek iced coffee&quot; is a frappe.</span>

I don&#039;t really know what a frappe is, so I googled it. It looks just like what they made, just with espresso instead of (or in addition to) instant coffee. That was definitely some caffeinated stuff in there.<br /><br />I had the boureks at the opening last night. They&#039;re really good.

				Stop in this afternoon. Had a panini and the mini boureks. Everything was delicious, which isn&#039;t surprising considering how great Agnanti is. They are still getting things together, but off to a good start.

It is clear that they&#039;re a newborn business and are not out of the starting gate fully conceptualized like a corporate chain franchise. The place looks great, and they&#039;re apparently expecting some additional tables and chairs to be added as well.<br /><br /><br />Very happy to have this new cafe in the neighborhood.

				I stopped by last week and wrote up my experience - it was very nice. I think it will be a great option for people living closer to the park. Plus, we can always have more coffee options, IMO. BTW, Faye is the owner.<br /><br /><br />http://queensnyc.com/2012/09/agnanti-cafe-opened-in-astoria-and-we-liked-it/

				Just visited this weekend as well. Cute little spot. Had some burek, the fig and prosciutto sandwich and a salad. Everything was good, salad was on the small side for the price I felt. But overall enjoyed the meal and the place.
