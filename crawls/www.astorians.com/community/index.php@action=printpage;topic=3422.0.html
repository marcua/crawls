				Tapered leg pants only look good on a small percentage of women.&nbsp; Tapered leg pants tend to accentuate the fleshy parts that are natural in most women, though there is a small population that has very low body fat and a narrow frame, including Audrey Hepburn (and she&#39;s dead!), models, some atheletes, and pre-pubescent girls, which generally have narrower hips and lower body fat percentage.&nbsp; These pants look fine, if not great, on them, and I have a handful of friends who will look smashing in these pants. <br /><br />However, I think it&#39;s awful that the fashion industry is encouraging this look in the general female population.&nbsp; It&#39;s like the ultra low rise jeans, rarely does it flatter on most.&nbsp; Stupid fashion industry!! :ticked:

				I love Audrey Hepburn but got so mad at that commercial!&nbsp; I too agree that you have to be a size 0 or 2 to be able to wear those pants!&nbsp; If you have hips, forget about it!&nbsp; I am so glad someone brought this up.&nbsp; I was telling my fiance this after the commercial aired, but he had no idea what I was talking about.

				Well, I once owned a pair of tapered leg jeans.&nbsp; I always found that I looked a bit out of proportion in them, but didn&#39;t know why.&nbsp; Then I watched a number of episodes of &quot;What Not To Wear&quot; and listened to what they were saying, and dang if they weren&#39;t right about the tapered legs and avoiding them at all costs.&nbsp; Such BAD fashion, those tapered legs.&nbsp; A straight leg or flared is much more appealing looking.&nbsp; A much nicer line overall.

				I am a huge fan of flared jeans...<br /><br />anyways, nothing about Gap surprises me anymore. their style went downhill as soon as they moved away from jeans and tshirts to &quot;trendy upsclale&quot; blah blah blah....

I don&#39;t think ANYONE looks good in those.

				Okay yeah that video was seriously disturbing. I usually like Gap ads, but Audrey Hepburn is royalty - and nobody should turn her into a kaleidescope and make her dance to rock music.&nbsp; :x
