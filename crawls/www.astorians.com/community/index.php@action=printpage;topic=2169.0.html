				28th ave. btw 37th/38th sts, not far from the Irish rover.<br /><br />I stumbled across this place this afternoon and I was very glad I did!&nbsp; It&#39;s no Freezepeach--it doesn&#39;t have that homey vibe--but for us mittel-Astorians, I think it can partially fill the same need--it&#39;s a nice little coffeehouse with good coffee, outdoor seating, free wireless and no Eurodisco.&nbsp; &nbsp;The pastry prices are a little high, but the coffee drink prices are very reasonable.&nbsp; It was pretty empty, though, and running into flooz and xahc later they confirmed that it&#39;s usually empty there.&nbsp; Too bad.&nbsp; The pretty young server said they&#39;d been open about a month.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, I like it and unless someone knows of a reason that it doesn&#39;t deserve support, I&#39;d like to see the place get some more business, so I&#39;m letting youse know about it in case you don&#39;t.

				I just noticed Wassi for the first time the other day as well. It piqued my interest, but I didn&#39;t go in. I ended up at my old standby, Himalaya Teahouse (34th Ave. &amp; 34th St.), which is possibly my favorite spot in Astoria. But based on your review, I will give Wassi a try.

				I went to Wassi yesterday, and got a decaf iced americano. The person working behind the counter was new, and had to get help from her superviser, which is fine. The decaf espresso was from a bag, not freshly ground, and was merely fair. I did enjoy the environs, though...

				I agree that himalaya is a mystery to walk by. the chalkboard suggests coffeehouse. the linen and glass tableclothes - a sit down restaurant.&nbsp; &nbsp;but they are not really either.&nbsp; The food I&#39;ve had there was good, but has never gotten me to return for it. only to have tea with a friend. and rarely at that.<br />lose the table service, get some more sweet munchies and give us bare tables. I&#39;ll be there every day. <br />of course opening in the morning would help.&nbsp; but maybe I am willing both places to be what they were not going for.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />does it often seem like so many places open up just two steps in the wrong direction of perfect?&nbsp; <br />

				Hey, people from Astorians.com...<br /><br />I&#39;m the one in charge of Wassi, and guess what... You are not the only ones confused about the place - we are confused too! <br /><br />When we first opened the place, in April, it was suposed to be a coffee house. But things started to change, and now we want the place more as a lounge than anything else. We do have liquor license - but only for wine and beer. The full liquor license is in its way, but it&#39;s hard to predict when exactly we&#39;ll have it. Our hours now: 4pm to 12am on, depending on the crowd. We don&#39;t really serve food. Our menu has&nbsp; paninis, desserts, coffee, wine, sangria, beers.<br /><br />We started with live jazz and bossa nova (I&#39;m Brazilian and my fiance is Peruvian) but now we are trying new things to see what is better for the place. I have movie nights now, every Tuesday. Karaoke any day, DJ on Fridays and Saturdays.<br /><br />And YES, we&#39;d love to have a meeting for Astorians.com over there - just let me know in advance. I already had some meetings over there and they worked.<br /><br />I built our website last week - www.wassilounge.com (http://www.wassilounge.com) and I&#39;m really expecting that people start to give their suggestions for the place. We have all kind of people hanging out over there, but the place doesn&#39;t&nbsp; have a <span class="bbc_u">face</span>. I try my best, but I have 2 jobs and I&#39;m charge there because I really like my fiance&#39;s place and I know it has a great potencial. <br /><br />Well... sorry if this post is sooo long, but people keep wondering what the heck we are doing there... I hope it&#39;s a little bit clear now! :mrgreen:

				Thanks for clarifying. I was kinda hoping that Wassi was going to go in the coffeehouse direction myself - since that&#39;s sorely lacking south of Ditmars - but perhaps it makes better business sense not to go that route. The few times I went I was looking for a coffeeshop and thought Wassi was too <br />loung-y. Oh well, still a nice spot...<br /><br />Now when is an actual coffee/teahouse (i don&#39;t think himalaya counts) going to open near the Broadway/30th Ave area already?!

				Say what you want about Starbucks, the one on Steinway is probably the closest thing we&#39;re going to get to a south-of-Ditmars coffeehouse in the foreseeable future.&nbsp; Sadly.

				I agree about Wassi, I walked by and was turned off by it&#39;s non-coffee-shopness.<br /><br />The awning over on 42nd &amp; 31st ave now says &#39;moroccan catering&#39;.&nbsp; I&#39;m excited to be trying some new food, but don&#39;t have high hopes for a coffee shop.&nbsp; Wish I had the capital to open one myself.

				Wassi&#39;s great, it has changed from the way it used to be in the summer to the way it is now. I&#39;m a regular there but the fact they don&#39;t have food(paninis) anymore has turned me off a bit, but im still a big supporter of the guy and gal running the place ;)<br /><br />If you&#39;re looking for a great drink spot, Wassi&#39;s def. the place. ;)<br />

				Hi Astorians,<br /><br />I am looking to open another coffee house in Astoria, one that caters to the caffeine-addict artist like me. I am getting pretty discouraged by the rents and the the lack of spaces that would work. I want any place close to the major avenues and trains. I can convert but it has to have windows. Any ideas will be greatly appreciated. Let me know if you see a place that you think would work. The market drives alot of people to do different business (like Wassi doing the lounge) than the one they love just to pay the rent.&nbsp; I came to this site from looking at Wassi thread. Are they still open?

				People keep mentioning spaces available for rent on this board, can&#39;t remember them offhand. The Broadway/36th Ave area definitely needs a coffeeshop!! I&#39;d look there over Ditmars, since (besides my selfish reasons&nbsp; :-), Freeze Peach is already there, much less competition.
