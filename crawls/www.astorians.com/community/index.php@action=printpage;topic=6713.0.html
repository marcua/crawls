				<strong>Every Tuesday Night </strong> at <strong>McLoughlins</strong> starting at 8:00 PM sharp we are now starting <span class="bbc_u"><em><strong>Ballroom Dancing with Starlite Karaoke&#039;s own Tara Martinez.</strong></em></span> For the next 5 weeks starting tomorrow Tara will be teaching <strong>East Coast Swing in Triple Time</strong>. I know it sounds complicated but it is really going to be a BLAST! Tara is a classically trained dancer and has many years of experience as well as numerous competitions awards under her belt. I promise this will be the most fun you will have and you will get in great shape doing it and not to mention you will be able to kick ass on the dance floor at your&nbsp; next wedding or engagement...<br />Classes are only $5.00 a person or even better yet you can pay $20.00 for the 5 classes.&nbsp; After the 5 classes Tara will go on to teach another series of dance based on Ballroom Dancing.<br />For more info contact Tara at her Myspace (She is in our top favorites) account or just show up at McLoughlins around 7:45 PM...<br />Afterwards we will start Karaoke at 9:00 PM which I will now be doing 2 for Tuesday Karaoke which will mean everyone will get to sing 2 songs in a row all night long... Also I will be playing the same dance music that we just learned how to dance to in between singers to let our dancers practice and strut their stuff... It&#039;s a great way to get in shape have fun meet new friends and just get out of your house for some excitement!!!<br />Hope to see you all there!!!!<br /><br /><br />McLoughins is located on Broadway and 31 Street just off of the N line train station in Astoria<br /><br />No Cover just the same old cheap drink prices!!! <strong><strong><strong></strong></strong></strong><br /><br />http://www.myspace.com/astoriadreams (http://www.myspace.com/astoriadreams)<br />http://www.youtube.com/astoriadreams (http://www.youtube.com/astoriadreams)

				You can come down any Tuesday. Tara is always willing to teach new students that show up. We are 2 weeks into East Coast Swing but you can still join up any Tuesday. Tara said we will learn as we go and is always willing to do what ever we want to do. The class has about 8 people in it right now and the age&#039;s range from early 20&#039;s to early 40&#039;s but we are open to all ages and look forward to meeting<span class="bbc_u"><em><strong> NEW PEOPLE</strong></em></span>!!! I have to say it&#039;s been fun and you definitely sweet so getting in shape for me has never been so much fun!!!<br />Hope that answers some of your questions...<br />See you all there!!!<br />Richard<br />Starlite Karaoke<br />PS. Show up around 7:45 PM and just ask Tommy the Bartender who Tara is and she will do the rest.
