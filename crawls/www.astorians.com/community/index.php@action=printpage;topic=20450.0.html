				My wife and I are fed up with going to the laundramat and pumping quarter after quarter in the washing Machine then the dryer then sometimes having to wait for a table to fold clothes also not knowing who and what was in the dryer before us, WWe just ordered a great solution to the washer dryer problems inherent to apartment Living a washer dryer combo&nbsp; that uses normal household electric outlets , no special water hookups or vents for drying, they are on the pricey side but well worth it when you consider how much we spend at the laundramat.<br /><br />http://www.compactappliance.com/Combo-Washer-Dryers/Appliances-Laundry-Combo_Washer_Dryers,default,sc.html<br /><br />http://www.lg.com/us/appliances/washer-dryer-combos/index.jsp

				With the cheapest machine, and not including the electricity, it would take me over 4 years to break even.&nbsp; Plus wear and tear on the machine, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;Granted, I&#039;m a bachelor, but still... that&#039;s a lot of quarters.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				We&#039;ve had a similar unit since 2001, made by Equator.&nbsp; The dryer crapped out a few years ago, but we still use it as a washing machine.&nbsp; It&#039;s in our kitchen - we hooked it up to the sink drain under the sink.&nbsp; We still go to the laundromat for big items like sheets and towels, but it&#039;s <em>really</em> convenient to be able to throw a load of clothes in whenever we feel like it (especially in weather like this).&nbsp; For us, the convenience of having it, although technically not measurable, factors into the calculation of making it worthwhile.

				Most landlords i know , including myself dont allow their tenants to have these machines . With the cost of water adding up&nbsp; plus many insurances like the one i have dont cover any water damage to the apt by a washer .&nbsp; If you have an apt that allows it , more power to you .&nbsp; I know some people sneak them in as well .

				I have had something similar for years. My landlord actually gave me advice on which to purchase and told me that he has insurance that covers water damage caused by BOTH washing machines and dishwashers. He has the reputation of being one of the City&#039;s worst landlords. I also discovered that my renter&#039;s insurance covers any damage. In this day of the bed bug I believe that any landlord not agreeing to the personal use of a washer is rapacious and an uncooperative person or entity. All but the 2 or 3 family house owner is dealing with an aging population and must respect their tenants as they want to be respected. As far as the use of water, any front loader uses so little water as to be rendered negligible.

				I had one of those before I moved to Astoria, and it was okay (definitely better than schlepping crap to the laundromat) but as thankos said, the landlord wouldn&#039;t allow it. Someone recently moved into our building and brought one and I spoke to the landlord and she was none too pleased. Regardless of whether a landlord has insurance to cover damage caused by washing machines / dishwashers the damage can be problematic to the point of losing tenants, so I completely understand landlords not allowing them.

				Yea its pretty much know , if you rent , you will have to lug your laundry to the laundrymats . Unless you rent out a first floor that might come with a basement in a private home . Then they should have the hookups for the machines
