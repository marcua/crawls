				The meetups that I know of are these - they are during the work week and for moms only<br />There&#039;s a new moms meetup on Mondays at Ave Cafe 11ish - 2ish or whenever<br />at Sai&#039;s cafe (the one just west of 31st St) on Tuesdays 11:30ish - until whenever<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering if there is interest in starting either another regular meetup - or maybe just a one-time thing and then maybe take it from there... for moms and/or dads and possibly on the weekend so those who have gone back to work can make it.&nbsp; Though I don&#039;t know if those who are back at work have any time to spare or the same need/desire to find other new parents like the stay-at-home folk might.&nbsp; <br /><br />Personally I&#039;d like to have a option for every day of the week.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t always make it - but it&#039;s nice to know that the support and social aspect is always there.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyone have any thoughts on this - <br /><br />Or - if you know of any more meetups in the area for new parents... please post them. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;ve been going to both meetups at Ave Cafe and Sai&#039;s Organics since I was pregnant.&nbsp; Both are very welcoming and will help you to feel supported in the neighborhood.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never been to the one at Freeze Peach.&nbsp; It&#039;s geographically challenging for me.

				If you are interested in making an online version of your group ning.com is a nice website and it&#039;s free (unlike meetup).&nbsp; If you make a ning group be sure to link it at astoriafamilies.org (a ning site) so that you can get the word out.&nbsp; Best of luck as you figure out a solution that works for you.&nbsp;
