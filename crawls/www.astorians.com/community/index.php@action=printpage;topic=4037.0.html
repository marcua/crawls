				So yesterday (Sunday, November 5th) was a non-important birthday for me. That simply means no expensive gifts, no big surprises, definitely no party—just a nice dinner out with that old gang of mine. <br /><br />Yep. Two months to pick a restaurant. Emailing back and forth. Telephone calls galore. We&#39;re kind of jaded. We always have a tough time picking one place everyone can agree on. No more ethnic food. We&#39;ve all had enough. Okay. How about a steak house that we *haven&#39;t* done? (I hate the way people get treated at Peter Luger&#39;s.) And, let&#39;s stay out of Manhattan.<br /><br />Morton&#39;s. Sure. They&#39;re in Great Neck. That&#39;s only 20 minutes away. Dinner service starts at 5:00, so if we get an early reservation we can be home before 9:30.<br /><br />WHAT A BIG MISTAKE! Or should I say misteak!<br /><br />We arrive in 2 cars. &quot;No, thank you, we don&#39;t want a booth. A table would be fine.&quot; At a table we can all see each other. (We talk throughout our meals.) We had reservations for 10 and there were only 8 of us. What&#39;s the big deal? Well, they made of big deal out of it. But, they accommodated us.<br /><br />This was the start to the very worst restaurant experience I have ever had. Coke, not Diet Coke served to a diabetic—and you could drop dead trying to get your servers attention for the free refills! <br /><br />We always try to get different things and we share. We ordered a half dozen appetizers. Crabcake. Shrimp cocktail. Lobster Bisque. Tuna Tartare. Bluepoint Oysters. Spinach Salad. Okay, the crabcake was superb. The shrimp were over-cooked. The tuna was bland. The oysters sour. WTF? But, we were having fun. so we let it all pass. MISTAKE! We should have gotten up and gone elsewhere at that point. <br /><br />Wait it gets worse. This is a steak house. You would think they know how to do steak. Yea, right. They got rare correct, but they think everything needs to be rare. So, we send 6 out of 8 steaks back FOUR TIMES to get them cooked the way we wanted them! WTF?<br /><br />Over-salted mashed potatoes. Sand in the spinach . . . sand in creamed spinach! WTF? Someone told the server, and those items were removed from our table and we were asked what we wanted in their place. So we ordered sautéed mushrooms, sautéed onions, baked potatoes and steamed asparagus with hollandaise sauce. Now let me ask a question here: if a 5 year old can microwave a baked potato how can a professional chef send one out of their kitchen that is practically raw? And was he blind that he couldn&#39;t see that the hollandaise was curdled? <br /><br />By now we knew we wouldn&#39;t be coming back to this place. But, being gluttons (for punishment) we decided to order dessert.<br /><br />We perused the dessert menu, and chose 8 different things. What we usually do is have a plate put in front of each of us, take a bite, and pass the plate to the person on our left.<br /><br />The chocolate soufflé was like rubber; the center was congealed like a pudding that had gone bad. The hot upside-down apple pie had one lousy sliver of apple. The crème brûlée was burnt—not scorched—burnt.<br /><br />I was so pissed. I asked the server to send over the manager. &quot;No, I don&#39;t want to speak with the maître d&#39; I want to talk to someone who doesn&#39;t make their living from tips!&quot;<br /><br />So, they got a new person in the kitchen. Wonderful. The meal was a disaster. Most of it was either sent back or just not eaten. <br /><br />Another question: what makes people think that after such a crappy experience someone would want to go back for a free meal? Hell no. Not gonna give you a second chance to make me this upset. &quot;How about you don&#39;t charge us for all the crappy things we ordered and *couldn&#39;t* eat?<br /><br />He cut our bill is half. The original bill was over $800.00. He cut it to $350.00. We&nbsp; left a tip based on the bill we paid instead of the original cost.<br /><br />Morton&#39;s The Steakhouse—UGH!<br /><br />Next year, Nathans. No-one can eff up a hot dog!

				Wow does that suck.&nbsp; At least you were with friends.&nbsp; Your waiter must have had the worst night of his life dealing with that bullshit kitchen crew.<br /><br />Hate to say it but eating somewhere high end on Sunday and Mondays are always a toss up.<br />Head chef is probably off till Tuesday.<br />Seafood is from Friday and not delivered again till Monday or usually Tuesday.<br />Pastry chef was probably in last on Tues or Wed.<br /><br />I think Nathans next year is a superb idea. Or maybe Chinatown?
