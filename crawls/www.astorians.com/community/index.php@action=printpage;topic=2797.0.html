				I&#39;ve been dying for Mister Softee all day, and I seem to never be able to locate a truck when the time is right.&nbsp; I see them around my neighborhood all the time, but when I am in the mood....no luck.&nbsp; Anyway, I wrote to Mister Softee today with a brilliant plan to revolutionlize the ice cream truck industry.&nbsp; I think my letter speaks for itself, so I will post it below.&nbsp; Who&#39;s with me??<br /><br />----------------------<br /><br />Dear Mister Softee,<br /><br />I had a brilliant idea for you.<br /><br />It all started earlier today when I had an uncanny craving for the luscious creaminess and otherworldly delights of a vanilla cone with rainbow sprinkles.&nbsp; I walked over to the local playground where I have often found one of your beautiful trucks.&nbsp; Alas, no truck.&nbsp; Dismayed, but not discouraged, I walked back to my apartment until an hour passed when I felt it safe to venture out again.&nbsp; Once again, my silky goddess evaded me.&nbsp; Thrice more did I attempt this voyage in vain.<br /><br />As if to add salt to my wounds, I later heard the distinct toll of the ancient Softee hymn.&nbsp; I ran outside my gate but found it impossible to locate the source of my calling.<br /><br />Mr Softee, wouldn&#39;t it be grand if every child (and 26-year-old man, as in my case) could unlock the mystery of the location of a Softee truck at any given moment?&nbsp; I plead with you to begin installing GPS locators into every truck and connecting them to the glorious home of Mister Softee on the world wide web, mistersoftee.com.<br /><br />I hope you take my story to heart and follow your dreams and mine to a more perfect world...a world where Mister Softee ice cream is always just a click away.<br /><br />God Bless,<br />Your friend Adam

				It seems like Mister Softee comes down 36th street between Ditmars and 23rd Avenue about 40 times a day, and at least twice after 10 p.m. That dang music is driving me crazzzzzy.&nbsp; :-)

				Softee MUST go.&nbsp; I get it, you sell ice cream AT 11PM!!!!&nbsp; Turn of the music and let the others that do not want overpriced ice cream sleep.&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe, with less notification the over weight people that I see eating it will be forced to walk down the street to get their cream fix and get some excercise at the same time.

				^thanks - my camera is 6.1 megapixels.&nbsp; it&#39;s a digital SLR though (not point-and-shoot), so the light sensor is considerably larger.&nbsp; i bought an ice cream cone from him, so he was cool with me taking the shot.
