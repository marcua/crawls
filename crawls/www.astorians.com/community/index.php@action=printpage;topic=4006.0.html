				Title: <strong>vote for change (what kind?) Re: nobody's body but mine</strong><br />

				<br /><strong>Vote for Change</strong><br /><br />Next Tuesday, November 7, is Election Day. There’s a lot at stake, including control of Congress and the direction of our country. While journalists and elected officials wonder what the impact of the election will be on the war in Iraq, few are talking about what the impact will be on America’s longest running war: the war on drugs. This war-–a war on our own people--has destroyed millions of lives. And the casualties continue to mount. The total cost to taxpayers is approaching a trillion dollars.<br /><br />It&#39;s time for a change. But nothing will change without your help.<br /><br />http://www.drugpolicy.org/homepage.cfm<br /><br />Here is what you can do:<br /><br />1) Vote. And get your friends and family to vote. The election is Tuesday, November 7, but in some states you can take advantage of early or absentee voting. It&#39;s none of our business who you vote for, just vote. This website is a good resource for finding out where to vote. Many Congressional races are going to be very close. Your vote matters.<br /><br />2) Educate yourself on where candidates stand on the issues. For instance, our 2006 Congressional Voter Guide lets you know how your member of Congress voted on drug policy reform issues. Vote Smart is a good non-partisan web site for finding out where candidates stand on a variety of issues. <br /><br />3) Volunteer for a campaign, especially in close races.<br /><br />4) Support ballot measures that reform drug laws, such as measures in Colorado (Amendment 44) and Nevada (Question 7) to eliminate criminal penalties for small amounts of marijuana, and a measure in South Dakota (Measure 4) to legalize medical marijuana. Oppose ballot measures that escalate the war on drugs, such as a measure in Arizona (Proposition 301) to deny drug treatment to people arrested for possession of methamphetamine. <br /><br />5) Help people exercise their right to vote, and make sure every vote is counted. Volunteer for organizations assisting voters and monitoring voting. Get more information here and here.<br /><br />For too long politicians have scapegoated people with substance abuse problems, used the war on drugs as an excuse to lock people up, and wasted our tax dollars. For too long they have shortchanged treatment and stood in the way of campaigns to reduce drug overdoses and the spread of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis and other infectious diseases. For too long they have been allowed to punish people simply for what they put into their own bodies.<br /><br />On Tuesday you can make your voice heard. And you can help other people make their voices heard. The choice is clear. Do nothing and allow the war on drugs to continue. Or vote for change. Do nothing and allow 1.8 million Americans to be arrested for drug law violations every year (700,000 just for simple possession of marijuana). Or vote for change.<br /><br />You can’t afford to stay home on November 7. The Drug Policy Alliance Network can&#39;t afford for you to stay home. And your country cannot afford for you to stay home.&nbsp; So vote. And get your friends and family to vote. You can find out more about where to vote in your area here.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Ethan Nadelmann<br />Executive Director<br />Drug Policy Alliance Network<br /><br />*** Enjoy yourself. RESPONSIBLY. I still prefer non-smoking, drug free environments ... as long as there is caffeine and sugar available ***<br />
