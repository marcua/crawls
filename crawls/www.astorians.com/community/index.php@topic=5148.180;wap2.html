			I have a bunch of tote bags and keep one in my messenger bag or my bass bag just in case I make an unplanned stop at a store.&nbsp; Hmm.. maybe I&#039;ll unload some for free on here if my collection keeps growing.<br /><br />I just got two 500-page bagasse sugar paper reams (80% sugar cane waste/20% cert. plantation fiber) I&#039;d ordered from ecopaper.com.&nbsp; While looking for tree-free printing paper, I came across hemp paper, banana plant paper, cotton fiber paper, and paper made of.. yes, elephant crap.

			I don&#039;t have anything to attach them with. They&#039;re just long plastic boxes that fit on the windowsill.&nbsp; I had them out on the stoop last summer and grew lettuce in them.&nbsp; I had one on my kitchen window sill for a while and grew onion shoots and herbs in it. contact me off-list if you want them - margotlev at gmail<br /><br />

			Hey I haven&#039;t been able to read every comment in this feed as it&#039;s pretty long but it seems that a lot of people are taking some really important steps in the right direction. Seriously, congratulations! It&#039;s important to show that you care for your community and your body. They&#039;re both pretty irreplaceable and have a huge impact on one another. <br /><br />For those of you doing a lot of cooking with fresh, local or maybe organic produce have you considered composting your kitchen scraps? There are several drop off sites in the surrounding area including, the actual markets that you may buy your produce from. <br /><br />Check out the site for drop-off times and locations<br /><br />http://bignyc.org/drop-sites<br />
