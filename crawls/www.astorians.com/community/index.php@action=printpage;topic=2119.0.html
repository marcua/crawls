				This is just shamless self-promotion.<br /><br />I say if you want to write about something then write it here, don&#39;t put a link to your business website, then make us scroll to the bottom of that page and click another link to make us see what you are talking about.

				I sent you all to the blog via the site, not as shamless self promotion . Which by the way I have absolutely no problem with . But because I couldn&#39;t remember the blog address at the time.<br />I did not write it here I blogged it.<br />That is indeed the purpose of a blog.<br />http://waltz-astoria.blogspot.com/<br /><br />

				why such negativity merm? All she(song) ( or is it bill?) is doing is sending people to see a blog which concerns our neighborhood(ASTORIA) which is why we are all here to begin with.<br /><br />&nbsp;That being said i think Waltz rocks and they have cute little comfortable seating outside to boot!( especially since dogs aren&#39;t allowed-such is life)- anyway better to blog than rant, or is a rant a blog or is a blog an e-rant? you figure it out :mrgreen:

				I&#39;m not meaning for any negativity to be directed at all at Waltz. I&#39;ve heard nothing but positive things about the cafe and support it as a local business and venue. I don&#39;t have anything against Bill&#39;s blog either - just that this advertisement for it was posted in this category.<br /><br />However, a post that simply says to the effect &quot;I posted something very interesting on my blog so visit my website&quot; I would say is a shameless self-promotion; an advertisement meant simply to drive more traffic to your site. If the poster had written about whatever it was they were wanting to talk about, and then said &quot;I&#39;ve also written about this in my blog&quot; and provided a link that would be another thing. That&#39;s just where I&#39;m coming from, maybe others disagree.<br /><br />I personally see a difference between posting simply in an effort to promote your own website and business and not contributing any content here, and in genuienly contributing content to an online discussion (which is what this board is for).<br /><br />I&#39;d say the same thing for any other blogger or business who did the same.

				Merm has a point.<br /><br />What I should have done in order to follow His Rules on using the Board <br />was either blog here or skip it.<br /><br />Again, I am not at all above shameless self promotion when it comes to the cafe&quot;<br />And again, his point is well taken ( no offense is taken either ) that this kind of promotion has its time and place. <br /><br /><br />I have made the decision after reviewing the rules and regs to his board <br />to delete our account. I respectfully requested that for my personal account as well, as I <br />feel this board is not the place and that now is the time.<br /><br /><br />And as a famous man once said.<br /><br />&quot; May the good Lord , shut your mouth and open your mind &quot;<br /><br /><br />

				There&#39;s one key difference between the two posts you reference and Bill&#39;s.<br /><br />That is that we&#39;ve had an ongoing issue with Waltz posting dupes and advertising on the board without contributing to the community dialog, and we had messaged them about it on more than one occasion.<br /><br />While the above two users did indeed post links to their blogs (perhaps in bad taste), it was far from an ongoing issue, and different than just plain business advertising.<br /><br />I don&#39;t think the rule of thumb for this board is too hard to understand. There is a tolerable ammount of self-promotion that is okay, but there comes a point where it crosses the line and just becomes spamming.<br /><br />I think there&#39;s a distinction between posters that simply use the board to spam or self-promote (i.e. the Waltz/Bill posting series), and a regular contributer and participant to the board who announces their personal website once among other posts (see the posts of the two you linked two who mentioned their blog.) Even so, Walt&#39;z posts were self-censored, not deleted by me or anyone else. I&#39;d say that&#39;s pretty open.<br /><br />&quot;Open discussion&quot; does not mean anarchy or free for all for me. You may be comfortable allowing a community board to have more blatent advertising on it (i.e. look like a &quot;classified&quot; bulletin board for &quot;listings&quot;, or look like craigslist), but this board is structured more for conversation rather than classifieds or advertisements. &quot;Open discussion&quot; is what this board is about, spam is not the same as conversation.<br /><br />If you have a hard time telling the difference, or you think our rule of thumb is too difficult to understand, please feel free to share your thoughts either here or in a private message.
