			Bumping this for new suggestions/experiences. I&#039;ve compiled a list of brokers based on your recommendations already, but I was wondering if anyone had other names? I&#039;ll be looking for a 3BR with a balcony, patio, or yard and near the N/Q trains for upwards of $2700, if that makes any difference to what brokers I should work with.

			Hi folks, I&#039;m bumping this again, hoping to hear of anyone&#039;s positive experiences with brokers in Astoria.&nbsp; Would like to work with someone who is very honest about apartments, conditions, supers, etc. and will work hard to help us find the best place that meets what we&#039;re looking for. Thanks!

			I don&#039;t think highly of most brokers and have yet to meet an honest one. But have you tried reading reviews on Yelp? some might be fake if they are all too good, but you should be able to weed through them
