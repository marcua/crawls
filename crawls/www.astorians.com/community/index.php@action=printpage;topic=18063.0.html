				Michael, I sent this information to Dirk and will try to paste it here.&nbsp; Would be interested in going to it, and will think about a church trip, but OUT Astorians might like it.&nbsp; What you think?<br /><br />My name is Carol Carpenter and I&#039;m a playwright, a gay woman, and a Christian who re-found the love of God through the support my evangelical parents -- who stood up for me and my rights in our small conservative town after I came out of the closet. I&#039;ve written a play about my family struggling through these issues: a play that examines issues of faith and love while celebrating the strength of family to overcome. I would like to invite anyone in your congregation who may be interested to attend.<br />The show runs from June 4 - June 26. Tickets for $18 can be found at: http://www.planetconnectionsfestivity.com/shows/good-lonely-people or at http://www.mtworks.org.<br /><br />Blessings,<br />Carol<br />I&#039;d be interested, know nothing about it, but interested none the less.<br />Pastor Paul B Milholland - Trinity Lutheran - The Welcome Place

				Hi Paul,<br /><br />We discussed that event but we feel it doesn&#039;t fall under our purview since it isn&#039;t happening in Astoria, LIC, or Sunnyside (our area of operations) nor is it being staged by an Astoria/LIC/Sunnyside-based institution. Additionally, I had personal reservations due to the explicitly religious content--though that was not the prevailing opinion among the other board members. I appreciate the suggestion though and hope you will continue to keep us in mind.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Michael

				Obviously it is of interest to me, given my profession!&nbsp; LOL<br /><br />How can I be of help to folks?&nbsp; I am not looking to prosyletize (spelling) but to be friends with folks and fellowship with people as well.&nbsp; If someone needs/wants to chat about spiritual matters, that is beyond the organization and I am free to do it at other times.<br /><br />My son, Kell, is also gay and very interested in connecting with other young adults in the area.<br /><br />Please keep us informed and let us know about events, etc.&nbsp; We REALLY are excited about being here.<br /><br />Peace<br />Paul

				You and your son are always welcome at any OA events, Paul. And we&#039;d love to hear any (secular) suggestions for community service opportunities. I&#039;m sure many of our members will appreciate your religious guidance outside OA&#039;s realm and I know several are members of your church.<br /><br />If you&#039;re on Facebook, I suggest connecting with us there to keep up with our latest goings on: http://www.facebook.com/OutAstoriaPage<br /><br />You can also email our Communications Director, Chap Day, at communications@outastoria.com to receive our monthly newsletter.<br /><br />Best,<br /><br />Michael

				I would love to see a hosted art exhibition and sale.&nbsp; Jackson Heights and Long Island City has an established arts community and it would be fun to see local Astoria artists display and sell their work.
