				Maybe I&#039;m just being overly sensitive but I&#039;m getting kind of sick of the &quot;up its own ar$e&quot; attitudes about how Queens is finally getting as cool as Brooklyn and Manhattan.<br /><br /><br />Queens has always been awesome - it has always had great food.&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying I&#039;m not enjoying all the new restaurants that have opened around here - I&#039;m just saying the condescending attitude about it is nauseating.

				MagicPie, I went to the Astor Room with some friends a couple of months ago.&nbsp; It was good - I would like to go back, but if anything I found the food to be a bit too restrained.&nbsp; Food like steak tartar that has a very distinctive seasoning was a bit flat.&nbsp; The oysters were delicious (although that certainly has less to do with preparation!).&nbsp; Friends had the warm bacon salad, the Caesar salad and the salmon entree and said that everything was very good.&nbsp; I tasted the salmon and it was really nicely done.&nbsp; The desserts were over the top in a good way (and tasty), and the drinks were good (and the bartender mixed us drinks on the spot based on what we said we liked and didn&#039;t like in a drink).&nbsp; <br /><br />All in all, it was fun and I think it would make a good date night.

				Sounds good.&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait to try it.&nbsp; I think I&#039;ll start with brunch (as that is my obsession and slightly cheaper than dinner).&nbsp; I feel like I&#039;d never heard of it and then it was suddenly all over the press.
