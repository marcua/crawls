				Being a transplanted Southerner, I&#39;m absolutely miserable when it gets this cold and try to stay indoors, though I&#39;m having little success today.<br />What are people doing to stay in from the cold weather?&nbsp; Board Games?&nbsp; TV?&nbsp; Anyone have a fireplace?&nbsp; Cooking?&nbsp; (Maybe some folks are out enjoying these frigid temperatures?)<br />I&#39;m off to two meetings tonight, not exactly the best way to stay warm, and neither is close to a subway, brrrr!

				I just walked two miles (giving my new roommate a walking tour).&nbsp; I walk around during the day and then come home and hibernate.&nbsp; I&#39;ve lived in the cold for years so i&#39;m used to it.&nbsp; I usually watch tv-on-dvd or play word racer on yahoo.

				I am freezing, and carrying over from the &quot;where do you live vertically&quot; thread, have lost all control over the heat, so i&#39;m sitting on the couch, three blankets, a scarf wrapped around my neck and mouth, lap top, and flipping between bad movies (dominion, who&#39;s that girl, you&#39;ve got mail) all of which I kind of enjoy...too cold to leave to go to meetings, so props to you McDirk...

				two miles is a lot of walking in this weather!&nbsp; where all did you go?<br />I suspect a lot of folks are spending quality time on Astorians.com too - especially given how many new posts and threads have emerged today.&nbsp; We&#39;re over 1,000 posts on day 5 of the month!

				I think it is great! It is about time winter has arrived and we are all bundled up, red noses, who wearing what this winter season, Baileys Irish as a nightcap (YUM!) and most of all, it has killed all those germs that have been floating, multiplying, spreading during our up and down days of the months past. I enjoyed the warmer weather we had during October, November, December and January, but my body just could not handle the fluctuations, my head, my head!!! Now if we could just have a good ol&#39; Noreastern I would be one happy chap.

				I&#39;ve always liked the frigidly cold weather over the brutally hot weather.&nbsp; &nbsp;When it&#39;s like this, you keep moving and wear lots of layers while when it&#39;s oppressively hot, there&#39;s only so much you can do to cool off.<br /><br />I&#39;m on the fourth floor of my building with a southern exposure.&nbsp; &nbsp;I get the sun beating down in my apt all day so it&#39;s nice and toasty when I need it to be.&nbsp; &nbsp; I have risers in my rooms only except my bedroom which I haven&#39;t opened more than three times in the 2 years I&#39;ve been here.&nbsp; &nbsp; I have to replace a radiator on the 5th floor and I&#39;m thinking of giving them mine, just so I won&#39;t have to lug one up from the basement.<br /><br />My sympathies tho to those of you with heat issues in your apts.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are days when I wish I could use that as an excuse to bundle up and do nothing.&nbsp; &nbsp; (I do that anyways, I just like to have an excuse sometimes to avoid the guilt)<br /><br />

				You know, I try to be positive when it gets cold like this. &quot;Oh, it&#39;s 4 degrees out? Look at how pretty the sky is!&quot; &quot;Aaah, at least I&#39;m not sweating through my clothes by the time I get to the subway,&quot; etc etc etc.<br /><br />But you know what? Screw it. I HATE HATE HATE cold weather. Anything below 40 is annoying, anything below 20 is un-freaking-bearable. And the wind! My god, the wind. The constant static electricity! The runny noses! I can&#39;t stand the fact that I can&#39;t throw the windows open and get fresh air flowing through my apartment, or through classrooms, or in my car (on the, like, one day a week that I drive somewhere, which is an epic journey because if I don&#39;t let my car warm up it&#39;ll stall). I simply can not deal.<br /><br />And all you people from colder places, thanks - you&#39;ve just given me a reason never to visit those places except in July.&nbsp; :wink: And for what its worth, I&#39;m from New England, so I *should* like this, but...gah! It&#39;s HORRIBLE. Horrible, horrible, horrible.

				There is a reason I go to Mexico not only in the winter, but also in the summer -- and it&#39;s not a love of cold weather!<br /><br />(Truthfully, I&#39;d be happy if we got a couple of feet of snow.&nbsp; To me, the only justification for cold weather is snow.&nbsp; I think the winter of 1996 was the happiest winter of my life.)

				Hey, look at it this way when its freezing you can add more layers, drink warm beverages (Hot Whisky- woo hoo!) and snuggle up with someone to keep warm.<br /><br />When its hot there are limits to how much clothing you can legally remove in public!!&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />Bring on the snow!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; <br /><br />

Yeah, when its 95 degrees with 90% humidity, I&#39;ll whine about how I&#39;m sweating my *bleep!* off, but I still prefer summer to winter in a HUGE way. Ask me next time we have a heat wave, and I&#39;ll say the same thing. Walking into a heated home/room on a super cold day feels nowhere near as good as jumping into a pool or going into an air conditioned room on a hot day. Or, another example - I took a really hot shower this morning in an effort to warm up (I actually woke up shivering, because I had thrown the covers off and we keep the heat lower at night), and it was nowhere near as awesome as the cold shower I took when I woke up at 5 AM all sweaty and gross on Day 1 of the blackout.

				I&#39;m sorry, I missed all of this thread because I&#39;ve been under at least 5 blankets, 6 sweaters and 2 beanies at ALL times since this hit. People live in this effing climate? and worse? yer all nuts. Someone send me home please. And summer here sucks too. &#39;Proper&#39; summer is hotter, but without all that nasty humidity. Hot and dry. Ohhhh yeah.&nbsp; :-o<br /><br />
