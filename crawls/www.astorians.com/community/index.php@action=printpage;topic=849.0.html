				@ lanseaux<br /><br />To tell you the truth I wasn't fully convinced on my position regarding non-US citizen voting rights. I do have dear family that falls into this category btw (not that that necessarily strengthens my argument). My first instinct tells me that this right could subvert American policies (more than it already is!) for the express benefit of foreign powers. It only makes sense to me that when I visit a foreign country that I should not be allowed to vote on issues that don't concern me and be respectful of different forms of government when I am a guest. If I cared so much about a country and wanted to make a home there, then I would become naturalized and swear fealty.<br /><br />Now I am having second thoughts about this issue. There are a &nbsp;number of points to consider that could be made for non-US citizen voting rights... so thanks to you lanseaux I am now undecided! Thanks alot! (for getting me to think :idea: &nbsp;:-) )<br /><br />I am <em>for</em> however all other rights as applied to non-US citizens or visitors to this country (except the right to run for President... well... only if he or she was French!, no one else.) IOW <em>Human Rights</em>, due process, etcetera, etcetera which [WARNING: <span class="bbc_u">Affective</span> Writing Ahead] the U.S.A. P.A.T.R.I.O.T. would seek to obliterate.

				tough call. Maybe Kahn. I'm not sure yet. The Council is not a Federal position and getting along with the other councilfolk is clutch here. If you're a jerk and every hates you, your district (us) is what suffers. <em>You </em>still get paid. Also, the council doesn't determine much of federal issues like the patriot act, but thier positions are still relevant. Even so, I really freaking hate the war and I also hate the current NYC development frenzy characterized by this past term.<br /><br />If Kahn were a pastafarian, it would be a no-brainer. =)

				Thanks lanseaux, i'll alert our beloved Big Brother about his non-mistake... that responsibility falls to me (Yikes!). Also, I have the highest respect for your desire to maintain privacy. Too much these days people let it go to the wind without a second thought. However, I still encourage people to vote on the poll, as it may give us an inkling of where the frequenters of the board stand on this issue in any case.<br /><br />-z320<br /><br />[Later:]<br />Whoops!, I guess BB isn't omnipotent as well, being that he can't even get enough rights to correct the spelling or manipulate the poll.

				Thank you for providing the links to Vallone. I also believe in dispassionate analysis and equal exposure. Fairness is a virtue. Plus, some of us soon will be headed to his office later in the week to ask his endorsement for the &quot;Astorians for Hurricane Relief&quot; events.

				@ Daveed,<br /><br />Well....I do <em>some</em> of the time, when I'm not absolutley blasted and sh*tfaced. <em>That</em> thread was a mistake, but at the same time it did make me feel a little bit better during a moment of crisis and weakness.<br /><br />The motivation behind it, however was heartfelt. Too many people are too ready to support the War and have no first hand knowlegde about it's <em>effects</em> or have even seen such a photograph of the Iraqi children as I have posted. If you are going to go to war (hopefully as a LAST resort) then you should at least bear in mind the consequences of what happens when dropping bombs on civilians. IOW, WADR (With all due respect), I stand behind that thread and my position on the War.<br /><br />:-) Zero.

				And speaking of dispassionate analysis and equal exposure, when was the last time that we saw (without censor) on T.V. what the Iraqis (who we are supposedly <em>helping</em>) actually want? &nbsp;Coming from an actual Iraqi? You remember a little news organization called Al-Jazeera? The so-called &quot;Voice of Bin-Laden&quot; by Rumsfeldt? Why are <em>they</em> not given &quot;equal exposure&quot; when they air footage or opinions that are deemed too <em>sensitive</em> by our corporate (yes, <em>Corporate</em>) media?<br /><br />We can only fool ourselves for so long until we actually see the fruition of our violence against the world in the name of Oil and profits, right here, right now, right in front of our face. And then we deny anything ever happened.<br /><br />btw, those babies that I so unconcientiously used in my post Are real.
