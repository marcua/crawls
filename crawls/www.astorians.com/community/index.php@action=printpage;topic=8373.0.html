				Hi Everyone!<br /><br />I looked at a place here today and was wondering if anyone could offer some feedback on the complex/management company.&nbsp; Also, do you know if you can rent directly through aris?<br /><br />Thanks!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				We rented directly through Aris after mentioning to them that we saw the apartment on Rent-Direct.com (which we sorta did... a friend gave us a print-out of the listing, but they never asked to see the print-out). Saved us a heck lot on commission, but we couldn&#039;t get out of the $350 application fee.<br /><br />Call them at 718-777-8212 and ask to speak with Trish, who manages this apartment complex.<br /><br />We love the apartment, and the price when we signed the lease was market price (alright, but still high). We just got our lease renewal forms (way ahead of the time like the rent stabilization laws required) and rent&#039;s going up $100 from last year thanks to preferential rent. I left a message last week with them to see if we can negotiate a little bit. To this day I haven&#039;t heard from them... so I&#039;ll try calling again tomorrow.<br /><br />But all in all... great apartment, great location, very quiet on our side of the buildings (the side facing the bridge). There are a few rare bugs... small roaches mostly, but Aris just contracted exterminators who came in today, and they&#039;ll be working on the public areas of the buildings every other Saturday. So hopefully that&#039;ll take care of it.<br /><br />Hope this helped, and good luck!

				I wrote a really long post about this but it got deleted after the server on here crashed!<br /><br />Basically, i love living here. But a few problems: I live on the street side and it&#039;s loud (especially with the school kids). <br /><br />We didn&#039;t have any bugs for a whole year...now we&#039;re infested with roaches. The building has an exterminator come by once a month, but for the past 2 months they haven&#039;t sent anyone because they&#039;re in the process of hiring a new company. Hopefully this will be solved the first saturday of the month (when the new exterm starts).<br /><br />Also, my windows face one of the &quot;garbage&quot; alleys that the building uses. Constantly people slam the gates shut, and it&#039;s very loud. Even with our windows closed. Try to get an apartment on the other side of the buildings.<br /><br />All that being said, it&#039;s a good building. I love that my apartment is totally renovated and that the rent only increased $25 this year.<br /><br />

				Thank you so much for the info!&nbsp; I spoke to the managment company today and am glad I can avoid using a broker - but $350 for the application fee? -Isn&#039;t that illegal?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Wow, that is high?&nbsp; What could they possibly use that money for? Credit reports only cost 20-30 dollars, so it&#039;s not that!&nbsp; Key deposits are illegal.&nbsp; Definitely look into the whole preferential rent thing, it&#039;s not the first time I&#039;ve heard someone&#039;s rent shoot up due to some loophole like that.
