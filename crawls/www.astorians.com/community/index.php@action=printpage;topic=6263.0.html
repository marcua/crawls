				My coworker has a bunch of old photos she found at her mom&#039;s who recently passed away. A lot of them are bent and cracked and whatnot. I know there are places to restore old photos, though i haven&#039;t used one myself (and i have a few of my grandmothers photos i would like to restore as well). Does anyone have any recommendations of photo places that restore and enlarge old photos?<br /><br />Thanks!

				I&#039;d like to find a place like that too.&nbsp; What i did when my dad passed away.&nbsp; I had a friend scan his fotos and photoshop them.&nbsp; If you have photoshop you can play around with it a bit and fix the cracks at least.&nbsp;

				I got it done in the Macy&#039;s on 34th Street...if I recall correctly, it cost me about $80. Well worth it though. They did a gorgeous job.
