				In 1993 I was using my former employer&#39;s intranet to view an oversea&#39;s site and approve of the use of the Corporate logo, when I got a phone call from the IT administrator who asked why I was on so longâ€”then he put me on hold in order to pick up another call. When he came back he told me that he thought he had me confused with someone else, and was I one of the NYC Macintosh Users from headquarters? Yep.
