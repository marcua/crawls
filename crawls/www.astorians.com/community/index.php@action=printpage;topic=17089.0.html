				The first poem, I recall writing or at least that I remember the words I had written was at the age of 19. Then, even as simple as the message was, sounded beautiful to me-however,&nbsp; I was at that point not fully able the identify with all that it stated.<br /><br />“As the creatures of the earth hurriedly mottled through life entangled in all its’ confusion, they fail the see the beauty that surrounds them in so many forms”.<br /><br />This is one of the lines that resounds so deeply, amidst what I see in the masses of society everywhere; a society of which I was once a member.<br /><br />Recently, although it has been journey; even longer probably than I can fathom; I have decided to withdraw myself from society.<br /><br />I consider being part of society, and conformity to it; as that of being engrained within the grooves of a record that just got smaller and smaller as the record moved on. Of course I do move throughout society now, without becoming distracted by all the influences. Without my self-centered focus on my hopes &amp; dreams—society would be all to inviting to suck me back in, but I am in control of my entire life and chose not for this to be. I did not run away from society, nor did I turn my back on society. I focused only on being what I want to be, and beautiful things come to me out of that, which keeps me happy. So I just keep perpetuating that. I am addicted to happiness.<br /><br />I have always been concerned with the happiness of others, especially those that I care for or those who pass through by life. I see some of them “hurriedly mottling” through life. Pursuing what they think makes them happy, yet many are still not satisfied, worried &amp; fearful, stressed out! Why is that? I believe, based on my life experience--that there are many things that we think we want because we are ingrained to believe that we want, need and must have all the material things that will bring us happiness. So what do we DO? Without cognition, we enslave ourselves to relationships (jobs, personal, financial) in pursuit of money or other material things to gain what we want. This is largely due to media and propaganda. More often we get entangled in the dreams or dramas of other people’s existence, and get sidetracked from concentration of our own existence; our own imaginations from which materialize our dreams.<br /><br />People are always doing things- I’m trying to Relax, I am going to exercise, I’m working, I’m shopping, I’m bringing the kid’s somewhere, I’m meeting clients……………but somewhere the joy about doing these things in the pursuit, eludes us for later. But someday (later never comes-or is fleeting to the next dreaded thing). Why does joy and happiness elude us, when it is right in front of us? All we have to do is look in the mirror and realize our magnificent being.<br /><br />Examine your conversations, how many times do you find yourself saying I AM……, professing what you believe about yourself, beside how tired you are? Do you tell yourself good positive things to reinforce your endeavors? Many people are tired, although; they do not know how to break this cycle. One day blends into the next. Our lives become a chore.<br /><br />I know how I broke this cycle, I realized that I AM a Human-Being, and not a Human-doing.<br /><br />I AM!<br />YOU ARE TOO!<br /><br />www.askjourneyintowellness.blogspot.com (http://www.askjourneyintowellness.blogspot.com)<br />http://www.facebook.com/pages/Astoria-NY/Journey-Into-Wellness-Integrated-Healing-Holistic-Products/214856675145 (http://www.facebook.com/pages/Astoria-NY/Journey-Into-Wellness-Integrated-Healing-Holistic-Products/214856675145)<br />
