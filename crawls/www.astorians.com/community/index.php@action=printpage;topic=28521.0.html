				Sad news:&nbsp; Frankie&#039;s has closed.&nbsp; I always thought Frankie&#039;s was rock solid - I loved their slices, rice balls and (a long time ago) veal cutlet heroes.&nbsp; <br /><br />Another casualty of sky-rocketing rents and radical changes taking over Astoria.&nbsp; I personally hate to see the Mom and Pop stores close.&nbsp; I love Astoria because of its authenticity - which seems to be disappearing rapidly.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for the memories.<br />

				I agree it&#039;s sad.&nbsp; So many of the old places are gone only to be replaced by sushi bars, nail salons, back rub places, etc.&nbsp; Pizza Palace is still around.&nbsp; I don&#039;t go there anymore because I refuse to pay $3 or more for a slice.&nbsp;

				Noooooooooo!!! This was my fave &#039;stumble off the train for a slice&#039; spot. I always enjoyed it (maybe because I was drunk?) I thought they made a mean veggie slice. There were always people in there, at all hours - it appeared to do decent business. Lets hope ole Frankie is retiring as opposed to being pushed out for some reason.<br /><br />p.s. Pizza Palace blows. (last I tried them anyway)

				I definitely disagree with those that compare Frankie&#039;s to Pizza Palace.&nbsp; Frankie&#039;s was standard new york pizza - nothing special, but it was saucy, cheesy and good for a late night snack- the quality remained the same until the very end in my opinion.&nbsp; <br /><br />Pizza Palace is awful.&nbsp; Bland sauce, bland cheese and too pricy.&nbsp; Somehow, it&#039;s always crowded though, and I don&#039;t begrudge them for any reason, I just don&#039;t eat there.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

				I think pizza palace is still around because they have a lot of other types of food besides pizza.&nbsp; They have gyros, burgers, wraps, etc.&nbsp; I just think they charge too much.&nbsp; I don&#039;t go there anymore

Mine happened to be watching a pizza guy knock a pizza (in the box) off the oven while getting it ready for delivery. Just picked it up and handed it to delivery guy, and out it went. I just thought- well, if that didn&#039;t bother the guy, then how far would it go? I got off the line and got a sandwich from a deli.
