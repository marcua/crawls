			I always seem to get the same two songs stuck in my head. &quot;Forever Young&quot; by Alphaville and &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot; (various singers). Does anyone else have this problem? What songs seem to get stuck in your head?

			Where I come from, we call this &quot;the jukebox from hell&quot;.<br /><br />Right now it&#039;s &quot;Maniac&quot; from Flashdance!&nbsp; However, I hear both the melody and my own countermelody simultaneously in my head, which makes it a little more interesting.&nbsp; :D

			My sticky song changes every once in a while, but right now is Andy Gibb&#039;s &quot;I just want to be your everything&quot;.&nbsp; :-o

			So I actually got to catch the last JackFM song yesterday - got out of work early, and while I was driving home on the GCP, they played the last song - Journey&#039;s &quot;Don&#039;t Stop Believing&quot;. It&#039;s only, oh, my very favorite car song. (Car song = a song that is awesome to sing along with while you&#039;re driving.) Yes, I was singing along at the top of my off-key lungs. (I never said I wasn&#039;t a dork.)<br /><br />And now it&#039;s stuck in my head.<br /><br />Also, yes, JackFM pulled a Sporanos to end their run. Kinda cute, but the joke is old.

			Awesome topic, Urrisgirl. <br /><br />Recently, I have had &quot;Forthnight&quot; by musiqsoulchild playing in my head and sometimes I actually start singing it outloud.&nbsp; I really only know the words to the chorus and I&#039;m not even sure I have those 100% correct.<br /><br />In addition, I have &#039;Lazy Lover&quot; by the Brazilian Girls frequently popping up in my head! <br /><br />I&#039;ll come up with more as they come into my head.
