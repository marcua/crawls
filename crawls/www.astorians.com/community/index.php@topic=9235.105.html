								<div class="inner" id="msg_110418">It started with a few people in a homeowners&#039; group, who decided to clean up 2 blocks of Skillman Av. Interest in the project mushroomed, and pretty soon it was covering most of Sunnyside. If you can make the effort part of an existing organization, that would be easier than starting from the bottom up. <br /><br />To get started, I suggest getting a small core of people - a half dozen or so. Scout out an area in which graffiti is a problem, but not something unmanageable. I suggest a few blocks of a merchant strip. <br /><br />There are several government agencies that will help out.&nbsp; The Mayor&#039;s Anti-Graffiti Task Force was really helpful to us, as was the Post Office&#039;s Adopt a Mailbox program. <br /><br />I have an idea.&nbsp; Go to <a href="http://www.sunnysideunited.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.sunnysideunited.com</a>. Send an e-mail to their contact address.&nbsp; I&#039;ll see to it that somebody gets in touch with you. <br /><br /></div>

One of the problems here is that the N train runs above ground all the way down 31st Street, so people are spraying all the rooftops they can manage to get up to all the way down the line, for maximum visibility and longevity. I know the 7 is above ground by you, so did you guys have this problem? </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_110446">Actually, we stayed away from roof tops, not only because of their inaccessibility but because of the risk of injury.&nbsp; Keep in mind we&#039;re an all-volunteer outfit with a small budget. <br /><br />I suggest starting with easier targets, like walls, store gates and mailboxes. Although mailboxes are not the biggest targets in the world, vandals love to tag them, and they are highly visible. <br /><br />The Post Office has a great program called &quot;Adopt a Mailbox.&quot; They give you the paint and brushes; you supply the elbow grease. It&#039;s a great way to get started, and the small size of the mailboxes makes them good for kids and seniors. Only use regulation postal paint on mailboxes. <br /><br />SUNN is always ready to discuss its experiences.

								<div class="inner" id="msg_110455">See, my main problem is with the rooftop graffiti. I actually don&#039;t think the graffiti is nearly as bad on the ground, though obviously there is some, and the &quot;adopt a mailbox&quot; thing is a good idea that I might look into. But it&#039;s the ridiculous amount of rooftop/construction yard graffiti that bothers me most, since no one seems to be doing anything about it and it sticks out so much. Also I&#039;m concerned as a resident to know that random A-holes are running around on everyone&#039;s roof, vandalizing things. These could be the same people breaking in through the fire escapes.<br /><br />As you mentioned, it isn&#039;t reasonable for a small volunteer group to attempt to clean up the graffiti in such cases. Any ideas on how this can be dealt with?</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_110498">Can you photograph the graffiti? We found that a very effective way to pressure property owners into cleaning up is to send them a &quot;photo letter.&quot; Here&#039;s what we do:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; We take a digital picture.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; We write a formal letter, and print the picture directly onto the document. We don&#039;t attach a photo, which could get lost, and can&#039;t be faxed or scanned so easily.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; In the case of a business, we look up an upper-level manager&#039;s name, and address it to them.&nbsp; Not to the CEO, but some regional VP or whomever. <br /><br />4.&nbsp; We print the letter on a good quality color printer and send it. <br /><br />This worked very well on several occasions, including with a GM dealership. It&#039;s especially effective with big business chains.&nbsp; Often senior officials in a company have no idea that their local branches are covered with graffiti, and when they find out that local management has allowed it, boy do they get mad! <br /><br />With smaller properties, just look up the owner and send it to them. Always try and get a name. That shows that you are resourceful, and you know with whom you are dealing. <br /><br />Hope this helps. </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_110514">I think it’s agreed that everyone would like to see Steinway spruced up but to complain how “horrible” it is -- is nonsense. Some see “horrible” as not being able to buy a book and others see “horrible” as not being able to shop at the stores that once existed. “Horrible” in my mind would be empty storefronts, burned-out buildings, and crime-ridden – it’s all about perspective.<br /><br />Yes, Steinway <strong>should</strong> be cleaner. Yes, newer stores <strong>would</strong> be welcome but it appears that most storefronts are rented and in business. Just because one may not frequent some of the stores, or that they appear to cater to a particular customer, does not make the business they transact any less valid.<br /><br />Appearances do matter. In terms of cleanliness of the street, it’s more than apparent that Steinway is lacking. But in terms of general atmosphere, for lack of a better word, I don’t really care if Steinway put off new-comers because it puts off longer-term residents as well. If a newcomer can’t look beyond Steinway to see what great things the neighborhood offers then I’m sorry, they should consider living somewhere else.<br /><br />It occurs to me that the perception of who lives in Astoria and how they identify themselves is the crux of the matter. <br /><br />The price of real estate cannot be the sole indicator to determine the “type” of person who lives here. A 600-700K house was worth 250-350K ten years ago. I doubt very much the people living in them saw their salaries increase by as much, so as a measure of affluence, price of real estate is limited indicator. <br /><br />Astoria is changing but it’s not yet entirely changed. We still don’t know what the area will become. I am concerned that it’s becoming a place where people come and stay to a place where people come and stay for a couple of years. <br /><br />No offense to those who don’t intend to live here long-term, but the percentage of short-term as compared to long-term residents matters in regard to community stability. And I agree with a previous poster that it seems that LLs no longer care who they rent to -- both residentially and commercially.<br /><br />Our newest immigrant group, may be college-educated, many with advanced degrees, but they are also younger, have the debt that goes along with those degrees, and do not necessarily work in jobs that pay all that well. Not everyone works on Wall Street or the finance industry.<br /><br />What bothers me is that in the criticism of Astoria shopping in general, Steinway in particular, there appears to be a hint of elitism and snobbery that I find disturbing (and I admit that I may be a tad oversensitive).<br /><br />To me, there seems to be an attitude, which I think is becoming more prevalent, that if something you desire is not within 5 minutes or 1.5 blocks of your apartment you somehow live in a ghetto.<br /><br />And why is it that some retail chains are “good” and some are “bad”? It often seems to me that the criticism here and elsewhere has less to do about the quality of product offered and more to do with the type of people who buy those products.<br /><br /><br />I often point to Forest Hills as an area considered more affluent because it’s more reasonable than comparing Astoria to the Upper East Side or brownstone Brooklyn, which really, are on another planet.<br />&nbsp;<br />“Immigrant” Forest Hills is a relatively new phenomenom with many people moving in from the former Soviet republics in the 90s after the Iron Curtain fell. In my memory, Forest Hills always had the reputation of being upscale but maybe it&#039;s just my perception.<br /><br />The biggest difference to me between Astoria and Steinway and Forest Hills and Austin Street, is that Austin Street had a driving force, property owner and developer Heskel Elias, who specifically set out to re-make the shopping street. It was Elias who brought in more up-scale stores, including chains, and restaurants, starting as far back as the early 80s. Manhattan-based developers followed. <br /><br />Steinway has no equivalent “angel” (or “devil” depending on your perspective). I suppose the BID was expected to provide some sort of leadership in this area but as we can all see they haven’t been doing a great job at it.<br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_110612">Neo -- I wasn&#039;t trying to rebuke your posting and I&#039;m sorry if it came across as such. I was trying to make a&nbsp; general comment about what Astoria is and who Astorians are then about what it might or could be because not everyone has the same perception and &quot;reality&quot; depends the individual.<br /><br />It wasn&#039;t my intention to say you labelled Steinway as &quot;horrible,&quot; in fact I thought in your previous post you provided an even-handed evaluation of the current situation on the street, much of which I agree with. But you can see in this thread and many others regarding retail, stores, restaurants in Astoria that other people exaggerate and in other threads the word ghetto has been bandied about many times and all too casually -- at least it so seems to me.<br /><br />I was simply trying to frame the argument from a different perspective. It&#039;s often chains vs. independents or mainstream vs. &quot;ethnic&quot; when in fact it could be the stores we currently have and empty storefronts. As a longer term resident you know that was a real possibility at one time in this city and not all neigborhoods fared as well as Astoria has over the years.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_110645">also, i just wanted to add that i think neo11&#039;s points in this thread have been spot-on. i&#039;ve lived in astoria for nearly six years and steinway&#039;s experienced a notable decline since even then -- the number of vacated storefronts is definitely higher than ever, and it&#039;s also a lot dirtier now. (also, i didn&#039;t realize that the kay-bee space was partially rented out. not good.) but shouldn&#039;t the landlords be more culpable here? why are they allowed to rent to, and profit from, businesses that don&#039;t care about the overall quality of life on the street without being cited in some way?&nbsp; </div>

Growing up we had two toy stores (Valco and Playworld [I think that&#039;s what it was called]), there was a Lerner&#039;s shop on the corner of Steinway and 31st Avenue that had adults and kids clothing (I believe that company ultimately turned into NY &amp; Co.), there was the Wiz for electronics (and they had a great music selection downstairs), there were two independent record stores, LTR for jeans, and Yogi Lala was the head shop it was meant to be (I remember buying a black Jim Morrison jersey with the white sleeves and thinking how freakin&#039; cool I was). The crappy stores that people think are a blight on the street have only cropped up in the last 10 years or so -- these stores aren&#039;t really the &quot;stuff that was here before.&quot; <br /><br />If the stores want to succeed in this neighborhood, they will have to adapt to the changes in the neighborhood&#039;s population. A bookstore would be a great start and the PC Richard location would be a great place for a Trader Joe&#039;s or Whole Foods. You mention the &quot;the 24-30 50k+ people&quot; that have moved in, but not all of those people have just moved into the neighborhood -- some of us have been here for a long time and would love a decent place to shop again and Steinway, unfortunately, ain&#039;t it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ah the good old days. Valco used to let you do layaway, right up until Christmas Eve. And Playworld was awesome, especially the 6 months my mom worked there in the 80&#039;s.</div>
