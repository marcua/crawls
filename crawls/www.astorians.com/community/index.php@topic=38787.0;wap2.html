			Launched in spring 2014, the LIC Art Bus is a free summer shuttle bus service that runs on weekends from May 9 through September 13, 2015. The initiative aims to promote and connect Long Island City’s cultural institutions, while linking the Western Queens waterfront to a major transit hub at Court Square.<br />The LIC Art Bus is free of charge.<br />The bus, which stops at the entrances of Socrates Sculpture Park, The Noguchi Museum, SculptureCenter, and MoMA PS1, runs on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, from May – September, from 1PM to 6PM at approximately 45 minute intervals. Passengers are seated on a first come, first served basis. Each Museum is open until 6 pm, Socrates Sculpture Park closes at sunset. SculptureCenter will be closed from August 4–September 13. Warm Up at MoMA PS1 takes place on Saturdays from June 27–September 5. Warm Up admission is mandatory for museum entry on these Saturdays, and galleries close at 3 pm.<br />For further information and schedule visit: http://socratessculpturepark.org/visit/bus<br />
