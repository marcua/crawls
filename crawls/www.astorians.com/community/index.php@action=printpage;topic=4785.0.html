				One of my bike buddies just posted the following on our club board......I know this is an artsy community, so I&#39;m posting it here:<br /><br /><em>I will be giving a party and would like to have a small classical/ chamber player type ensemble. Maybe 3-4 players... Does anyone know anyone who knows anything about hiring such an item? I would even consider accomplished &#39;young people&#39;, college students... <br />This will be a birthday party for a 90 year old relative...since she can&#39;t get out to see/hear live music, I want to bring it to her.</em><br /><br />I can ask him for more details if anybody&#39;s interested.

				I&#39;ll let him know. So far one baroque piano player&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />Not sure how much he wants to pay/how much people charge. I think he simply wants to support young artists/students without giving loads of moolah to professionals when he just wants something simple.

				My bike pal just posted the following:<br /><br /><em>Subtle change of plans. A discussion with my mother-in-law (recipiant of the &#39;gift&#39;), shared how much she loves classical guitar...this puts a slightly different spin on the situation. I can &#39;hire&#39; a classical guitarist, he/she can perform, but also continue to play as we socialize though the day. This will reduce the cost and allow for more live music time. My hunt will now be for a versitale classically trained guitarist...Should be a tad easier.</em><br /><br />

				More live music time equals more cost, actually.<br /><br />Good luck finding a guitarist!&nbsp; I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t be difficult.

				Hmmm, good point, surprised he didn&#39;t consider that. Maybe they can figure in a break or two with free food?
