				Who's the most interesting Astorian you know? Is it your best friend? Your neighbor? That weird guy who plays chess in the park?<br /><br />I'm curious - who are the fascinating people in the neighborhood and why? (And you can't say yourself - we already know you're cool.)

				For over 12 years I have admired Daisy, the Proprietor of the former Newton Cleaners which was located on Ditmars Blvd near 31 Street. &nbsp; Daisy always had a friendly smile. &nbsp;She listened to whatever you said. &nbsp;I would bring tons of dry cleaning and it was never a problem. She always had a rack of really nice clothing that no one picked up for a long period of time. &nbsp;A good quality blouse for $2.00 was the best bargain ever. I was really sad when the store closed. &nbsp;I was surprised and glad to see her again at the Dry Cleaners across from ABC Dept store on 31 Street. &nbsp;<br /><br />Stacey

				Then, maybe we can turn it into a game and try to take pictures of them in compromising situations. &nbsp;Just kidding :wink: &nbsp; But yeah, I agree about the AM New York guy. &nbsp;He's always upbeet.<br /><br />Also, is the heroin guy from Broadway not around anymore? &nbsp;I lived on 33rd street off of Broadway for about 3 years and always saw him. &nbsp;I've been up at Ditmars now for about a year and a half, and forgotten about him until he was mentioned here.

				And I 2nd (or 10th or 100th) on the AM New York guy. I have never accepted a newspaper from him (I always have a trusty novel for reading), but he definitely seems like a great person. I always wonder what he does in his non-Am NY life because he seems to be a little bit too dressed up some days to just be handing out newspapers. He seems like somebody with lots of aspirations.<br /><br />I also like the check-out lady with glasses and short grey hair (but not super short) at Key Food on 31st street. She is the best one there, and she reminds me of one of my aunts. (Another good one at Key Food is the lady with long grey hair and heavy makeup.)<br /><br />And then there's that guy across from CVS - &quot;We've got books today!&quot; Haven't bought anything from him either, but one of these days I probably will.

				LOL!<br /><br />That's not exactly what I had in mind, but hey, I know a good idea when I see one (or when it's handed to me on a silver platter)...<br /><br />I'm surprised that no one has mentioned anyone in their families - usually, the first person people think of as an inspiration is their mother. <br /><br />Or God.

				Anna at Zorba's -- she's the older waitress that's wonderfully maternal and always pleasant. &nbsp;Her Saturday morning pancakes are a little like going to grandma's for pancakes.<br /><br />Salvador, the chef at Michaelangelo's, is fantastic. &nbsp;He's a great cook but he's got a sort of undeniable psychic food sense. &nbsp;He knows what you want before you know what you want.<br /><br />Also cool, the old chinese dude who gives the tai chi lessons in Astoria Park every morning. &nbsp;He's at the top of the big grassy area almost daily (except for monsoon season) leading a group through movements around 7am.

				The drunks by the Ditmars train station are certainly an interesting bunch, but I have to say me greatest admiration is for all the shopkeepers in Astoria, who really show us what it means to live in a multiethnic community. <br /><br />You have to admire all the people who have come here from other countires and learned not only to communicate in English, but also in the languages of many of their employees and customers- from the Palestinian furniture store owner who also speaks Hebrew, Spanish and Italian to the Chinese hardware store owner who is learning Greek so that he can communicate with the neighborhood landlords.

				The owner (?) of the Astoria Natural Center on 31st Ave at 41st St is not only cool, but really nice too. He has a remedy for any ailment you may have, whether it be an herbal tea or a supplement. He will special order any health item you may need and is very responsive to any special dietary needs. He also suggested open apartments when I was looking to move to Astoria. Definitely check out his store.

				Yeah, he's a good businessperson, but how that qualify him as the &quot;Coolest&quot;? I think the Palestinian store owner <strong>anzubird</strong> mentioned definitely qualifies as cool. It's something out of the ordinary, unexpected, that is a mark of &quot;cool&quot;...<br /><br />I second <strong>jayme's</strong> nomination of Salvatore at Michaelangelo's. He's always super friendly and charming, and will try to accommodate just about any order. He really makes the experience of eating there (and the food definitely holds its own) warm and inviting.

				My favorite Astorian at the moment besides my mother who always is chitchatting with the store owners around the 30th avenue and steinway area is Barry at a bar called the Quays on 45th and 30th ave because he let me have a wonderful birthday party there yesterday, and even though the place was packed he somehow managed to scrounge up a table for about 12 people and a birthday cake hehe. :)

You couldn't get an <br />appoinment there around prom time unless you were a regular client. <br /><br />Ethel Merman was born and raised in Astoria. She was then Ethel <br />Zimmerman. She graduated with honors from the old Long Island City <br />High School.<br /><br />George Chakiris was the first famous Greek from Astoria.<br /><br />Joan Crawford owned a house on 37th Street to live in while she worked <br />on films at the studios in Astoria.<br /><br />As a teenager, I used to hang out with a group of same-aged friends at <br />the studios on 35th Street to collect autographs. we thought it was a *big* <br />deal then. <br /><br />Just a little trivia about the place we now all call home!<br /><br />Lorrie

				the guy who sells books for $1.25 (used to be a buck) on 31st just shy of Ditmars. &nbsp;The way he treats you let's you know he treats everyone well. &nbsp;I've been buying books from him for 6 years and he's always referred to me as &quot;my friend&quot; but I don't think he retains who I am the moment I leave. &nbsp;Oddly, it doesn't seem like an insult. &nbsp;somehow actually, I prefer to remain the guy who buys his more literary selections (6 books out of a hundred, always in the same part of his table on the far right end) who will never be more than a fleeting customer. &nbsp;No matter how many books I buy from him, no matter how many years. &nbsp;Makes him seem more like a mythological character in my life than a person. &nbsp;Like years from now I'll mention him to a fellow Astorian and they'll look at me and say, &quot;There was never a guy selling books there.&quot;
