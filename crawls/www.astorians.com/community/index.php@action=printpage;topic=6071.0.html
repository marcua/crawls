				Consider training for one this summer with Team in Training - you can achieve your goal while raising money for the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society at the same time.<br /><br />An informational meeting will be held at 7:00 PM on Tuesday April 24th:<br /><br />Citibank Building<br />Citiview Room, 50th Floor<br />1 Court Square (intersection of 44th Drive &amp; Jackson Avenue)<br />Long Island City<br /><br />I completed my first triathlon with TNT last September, &amp; this year I&#039;m going to be one of the mentors for the Westchester Triathlon team.&nbsp; My season with TNT was one of the best experiences of my life.&nbsp; If you have any questions, or if you can&#039;t make the April 24th meeting but would like a list of other informational meeting times/places, please contact me!<br /><br />AND, if anyone wants to support the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society but doesn&#039;t want to actually run a race, consider donating to my fundraising effort:<br /><br />http://www.active.com/donate/tntnyc/angledger<br /><br />Many thanks!<br /><br />Angela.

				There are different lengths of triathlons, just like there are different lengths of running races or swimming races.<br /><br />The Westchester Triathlon is an Olympic-distance triathlon, so the distances are:&nbsp; 0.93 mile swim, 24.8-mile bike, &amp; 6.2-mile run (1.5 km/40 km/10 km).<br /><br />There are sprint triathlons that are shorter &amp; half-Ironman, Ironman, &amp; Ultraman distances that are longer.<br /><br />As always, Wikipedia knows all:<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon#Standard_race_distances

				Thanks for the info.&nbsp; The biking and running don&#039;t worry me, its the swimming.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure the doggy paddle is not the best way to cover a mile of open water.

				If you can complete 50 meters, you can join the team.&nbsp; The coaches work intensively with novice swimmers to make sure everyone can finish the first leg of the race.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you&#039;re considering Team in Training, here&#039;s a link to the remaining information meetings for the Fall 2007 season:<br /><br />http://www.teamintraining.org/all_page?item_id=209487

				<br />Angela- <br /><br />I came on to post in the hopes of finding some folks to do some long rides with up to State Line or Piedmont!&nbsp; I did TNT in &#039;03 (Montauk -Olympic) and I&#039;ve done the bike leg of the Westchester Tri as part of a relay.<br /><br />I live in Astoria and was looking for someone to ride to CP with in the mornings before work; I do the 9-5 thing in Manhattan so I&#039;d have to get to CP by 615 or so. I&#039;m running on my own to improve speed (11 min mile right now). I&#039;m not committed to a race at the moment, but I&#039;m looking for someone to meet with once maybe twice a week to run or bike with just keep me honest.&nbsp; Let me know if you want company on your non TNT days.<br /><br />All the best,<br />Andrea<br />&nbsp;

				Andrea,<br /><br />I&#039;m not much of a serious biker but there are some other folks on the boards who are.&nbsp; EmiliaJCrotty is my mentor buddy &amp; a much more active biker than me.&nbsp; Do a search of the forums on bicycle &amp; see who you find.

				Thanks much, EmiliaJCrotty&#039;s email is hidden, so if you are talking to her and think to mention my interest<br />I&#039;d greatly appreciate it.&nbsp; Jayme [mod] is a friend and recently forwarded something to me about a more<br />relaxed bike thang happening this sunday, so I&#039;ll see if Emilia will be part of that!<br /><br />All the best,<br />Andrea<br /><br />[moderated to remove my last name -- thanks :) ]
