				As we all know, the big city real estate types are now looking beyond Manhattan (and Brooklyn to some extent) to Queens in general and Astoria in particular.<br /><br />Much of the media attention so far has been focused on the Astoria Cove project, which has become the poster child in the Mayor’s battle to secure more affordable housing for the city.<br /><br />But there are several other projects in the pipeline including another Alma mega block in LIC and now the Durst family. <br /><br />From the link in the NY Times article below:<br /><br />“Times are changing,” said Douglas Durst, a third-generation developer. “Large-scale office development opportunities are sparse and Manhattan land is cost-prohibitive to build rentals. It is time for the family to go deeper into residential and to cross the ocean to Astoria.”<br /><br />I’m a pragmatist, these project will go ahead and I don’t think there’s much anyone can do to stop them, there’s too much money involved.&nbsp; Plus, I’m not certain they should be stopped. The city needs more housing.<br /><br />But, I do feel that the developers need to give back more to the communities they build in. For this project, 20% of the units are labeled as affordable and Durst is building what appears to be senior housing in a deal with the NYHA on a portion of the Astoria Houses. In addition, the NY Times article states that this new complex &quot;will open up the waterfront to local residents with an esplanade and include a supermarket, retail space and a school. The city has promised better bus service, and there is talk of a ferry to Manhattan&quot;.<br /><br />But I’m left wondering, is this enough? What do other people think could be done to benefit the neighborhood as a whole?<br /><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font"><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/27/nyregion/in-new-york-real-estate-shift-commercial-developers-leap-into-residential-market.html?_r=0 (http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/27/nyregion/in-new-york-real-estate-shift-commercial-developers-leap-into-residential-market.html?_r=0)<br />http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2014/09/27/durst_family_buys_megaproject_site_at_hallets_point.php (http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2014/09/27/durst_family_buys_megaproject_site_at_hallets_point.php)<br /><br />http://therealdeal.com/blog/2014/09/27/major-office-developers-look-to-residential/ (http://therealdeal.com/blog/2014/09/27/major-office-developers-look-to-residential/)</span><br />

				It seems as though the &quot;help&quot; is only for that immediate area, and neglects that waterfront development affects the entire town...more than just those first two blocks from the river. Constraint on public transit, busier streets, congestion along the water, where we ALL want to enjoy whether we live a block away or not, the blocking of skyline views for those further in town, and so forth. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				I find it disheartening that we accept new housing developments that have only 20% affordable units as being reasonable. By allowing a 20/80 ratio of units as &quot;affordable&quot; we are not resolving the issue of affordable housing in NYC, we are compounding the problem. Some of the new apartment complexes even have alternate entrance doors (poor doors) for the poorer residents. Long time Astoria residents will be eventually squeezed out by unaffordable rents.

				I heard about this on WNYC this morning and immediately thought that the 20/80 ratio was disproportioned compared to the number of people who really need affordable housing and are getting squeezed out of Astoria.<br /><br /><br />And, as another poster pointed out, I wondered if these buildings are also going to have the &#039;poor door&#039; separate entrances for the affordable housing dwellers. These are a disgrace. Period. <br /><br /><br />I like the idea of developing an under- or non-developed area, but would like to see things that benefit the community more as a whole. A new school is fine&nbsp; - I think that was mentioned as part of this project. <br /><br /><br />I have to say though, just walking around Astoria, I think a lot of the new construction that&#039;s gone up over the last 10 years or so is incredibly ugly and cheap-looking. I sometimes wish builders had to follow the guidelines like I&#039;ve seen in some small towns at the Jersey shore, where you can&#039;t just put up anything without regard for other residents and the architectural look/character of the area. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				I don&#039;t mind new developments, usually, but their concept of &quot;affordable&quot; and mine are radically different.&nbsp; They should just stop saying affordable and admit it would all be luxury housing.&nbsp;

				UPDATE<br />This thread is old but there’s been recent news about the Durst Organization’s Hallet’s Cove mega-development (not to be confused with it’s neighbor, Alma Realty’s Astoria Cove).<br /><br />A couple of weeks ago, ground was broken on Hallet’s Cove, which, if you believe the hype will transform every Astorian’s life for the better. I’m a skeptic.<br /><br />Yes, there will be scads of “affordable” housing made available and I’m glad the project will have some environmental street cred with its micro-grid energy generation and a wastewater treatment system that will reduce run-off into the East River. (How “run-in” from the East River into the development during the next Sandy will be averted and the wisdom of building in a Zone 1 flood zone is entirely another matter.)<br /><br />It’s a done deal so no use cryin’ about it but enough about the ferry already! Every time I read about the stupid ferry, this comes to mind: “Gretchen, stop trying to make fetch happen! It&#039;s not going to happen!”<br /><br />More interestingly (to me) though is according to this article in the Queens Tribune, Hallet’s Cove next door neighbor, Astoria Cove, the mega-development which kicked off the affordable housing debate and called the 421-a tax abatement into question may be stalled.<br />http://queenstribune.com/the-cost-of-modesty-affordable-housing-coming-to-hallets-point-but-will-it-kill-astoria-cove/ (http://queenstribune.com/the-cost-of-modesty-affordable-housing-coming-to-hallets-point-but-will-it-kill-astoria-cove/)<br /><br />I’m sure it will get started sooner or later. I recommend you all get down to Shore Boulevard real soon and admire the view before it’s too late because the skyline will be blocked by these towers.<br /><br />More here about the Hallet’s Cove groundbreaking<br />http://www.timesledger.com/stories/2016/4/halletspoint_2016_01_22_q.html (http://www.timesledger.com/stories/2016/4/halletspoint_2016_01_22_q.html)<br />https://www.multihousingnews.com/post/new-affordable-housing-heads-to-astoria/ (https://www.multihousingnews.com/post/new-affordable-housing-heads-to-astoria/)<br />http://inhabitat.com/nyc/nyc-breaks-ground-on-its-first-off-grid-affordable-housing-development-at-hallets-point/ (http://inhabitat.com/nyc/nyc-breaks-ground-on-its-first-off-grid-affordable-housing-development-at-hallets-point/)<br />http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2016/01/14/astorias_hallets_point_project_finally_gets_its_groundbreaking.php (http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2016/01/14/astorias_hallets_point_project_finally_gets_its_groundbreaking.php)<br />&nbsp;

How many people can or will want to spend that every day? There&#039;s also a matter of how convenient it will be for people to get to work from wherever it docks, and whether it will be worth it for many folks.

Not just the Apple Tag building disgrace but remember the overhaul of the other building that now houses the Social Security offices near 36th?&nbsp; Another Alma endless job that barely looks even mediocre.&nbsp; And there was a bad fire soon after it was done.&nbsp; I have no doubt Alma is just looking to sell to a &quot;Durst&quot; just like Lincoln Equities did by selling to Durst.&nbsp; There&#039;s no way Alma can build that development.&nbsp; They&#039;re in it for the cash.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would be the 421-a compromise will wind up being another mess.&nbsp; de Blasio was accused by Cuomo of putting together &quot;a sweetheart deal for developers&quot;.&nbsp; Of course, they&#039;re both in it for the backing of the real estate moguls.&nbsp; Lets see what actually happens and how embarrassing it is for one or both of them.&nbsp; Construction comes to a standstill without it so they have to do something soon.&nbsp; Of course, it&#039;s not immediately noticeable because a phenomenal number of projects were fast track approved just before the expiration, including Durst&#039;s first tower at Hallet&#039;s Cove, which just broke ground.

				Maybe Alma will use the 421A thing as an excuse to pull out. It would really be better for them to get out before they start a project that sits half completed for years while they wrangle with legalities. I have to think that a more competent group would have had the Apple building up and running by now, there is a real demand for office space, a lot of companies are looking outside of the insane Manhattan prices. <br /><br /><br />I thought DeBlasio and Cuomo were supposed to be showing party unity in an election year, but I think they&#039;re both looking at a presidential run in 4 years, so they&#039;re getting a head start on the negative ads.

A new UES.<br />When i moved to Astoria 15 years ago, I never would have imagined it would have become the over priced Midwestern suburb that it has become but it has. Remember that change is inevitable and its coming to Astoria very soon. The developers are already gentrifying Jamaica.

				Thanks for the clarification TJT. <br /><br /><br />I thought the entire project was stalled since the major sticking point in the negotiations to extend the 421-A program was the developers rejection of union demands to pay prevailing union scale wages, not abatement of property taxes, at least that&#039;s how I understood it.<br /><br /><br />To be honest, it&#039;s all really depressing. You say that there will be a decline in projects aimed at all income levels but in reality, the only income come levels that can afford to live in what is being built currently are very, very high earners, who are able to pay market rates or very low earners who are lucky enough to win the lotteries for subsidized housing.<br /><br /><br />Everyone else, i.e. average earners, have to lump it and pay through their taxes to for housing that they will never ever have a chance to live in. <br /><br /><br />The whole system stinks. Maybe someone who has an economics degree may be able to understand and explain why even in this market, no development can proceed a without tax payer subsidy. It&#039;s madness.

				Let&#039;s just call it &quot;A Streetcar Named Boondoggle&quot;<br /><br /><br />Blanche Durst-bois: &quot;Well I declare that I had no idea that the 421A program had an expiration date. We&#039;re just powerless developers. Now we&#039;ll just be forced to build luxury condos. We&#039;ll have to find a nice tax attorney who knows how to write off the whole project as a loss until the city builds that $2.5 billion dollar streetcar for us. My, I hope we can find some foreign gentleman callers with money that needs to be sheltered from taxes. We&#039;ll have to rely on the kindness of strangers&quot;
