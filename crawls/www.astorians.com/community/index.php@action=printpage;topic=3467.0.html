				February 28 marks the return of ANTM. Last season was a bit boring, in my opinion. Here is a teaser: http://fourfour.typepad.com/fourfour/2007/02/top_schmop.html#more<br /><br />Maybe this time around we can have a semi-regular viewing. You know, drink every time one of the girls cries or something fun like that!?<br /><br />OT: My friend met Caridee at the Heatherette post-runway show party last night and said she was super nice and friendly. Glad she didn&#39;t let her ANTM win go to her head.

				My original favorites (Kathleen, Felicia and Caassandra) are all gone at this point. &nbsp;I like Dionne and Jael and Brittany and Jaslene, though. &nbsp;Natasha is really annoying, although the last episode with the baby issue kind of humanized her. &nbsp;In the earlier episodes she just seemed dumb as a rock--she hasn&#039;t seemed as dumb to me lately. &nbsp;The mail-order-esque situation is really creepy, though. &nbsp;Robin is so horrible. &nbsp;She&#039;s the worst mean one ever, I think. &nbsp;<br /><br />I love ANTM. &nbsp;:-)

				I guess it did humanize her, but she still annoys me - I can&#039;t even figure out why, it&#039;s just a visceral thing.&nbsp; I&#039;ll check out the fourfour summaries - they did such a great job on Project Runway, I can only imagine what they&#039;ll say about ANTM!&nbsp; I feel bad for Jaslene that they keep calling her a drag queen in every situation.&nbsp; I love drag queens, but I don&#039;t think she looks like one at all.

				Oh, don&#039;t get me wrong--Natasha annoys me too.&nbsp; I know what you mean about that visceral annoyingness.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s a combination of being kind of dumb, and oddly delusional, and sort of detached from reality, or something.&nbsp; Plus she only has one look--all &quot;blue steel&quot; and no &quot;le tigre&quot;.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think their calling Jaslene a drag queen is meant entirely as criticism.

				I do wish Kathleen had lasted longer - she was entertaining though very dense.<br />The recaps at fourfour are amazing.&nbsp; I&#039;d forgotten how much I&#039;d enjoyed their recaps of Project Runway.

				Britney&#039;s personality is a little ehn, but I think she photographs really well.&nbsp; She has a natural talent for it the way Michelle from last season did.&nbsp; Or Danielle who one the season before that who was my favorite ANTM ever.<br />Brit photographs like a young Jackie Kennedy.&nbsp; I think she&#039;s great looking.

				I don&#039;t know about Brit.&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine anyone wanting to work with Brit.&nbsp; She&#039;s very difficult from a photographer&#039;s standpoint, and I think she will be next to go.<br />I think Jaslene, Renee, &amp; Dionne will be the last 3, but I think Natasha is a better model than the rest.

				Thoughts on last night&#039;s episode?<br /><br />I did like Brittany in the beginning, but I was glad to see her go last week.&nbsp; She finally just got too annoying.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t like Renee at all in the beginning, but she has grown on me a lot.&nbsp; Jaslene is still my favorite, though.<br /><br />I wish the judges had kicked Natasha off--she is so creepy and weird!&nbsp; Some weeks she seems kind of sweet and spacy, and some weeks she seems kind of creepy and alarming.&nbsp; I suppose that&#039;s the editors doing their job...

				Last night&#039;s episode was cool. I just don&#039;t like Brittany. She&#039;s all &quot;blah blah this dancing thing is whack whine whine whine&quot; and then she tried just as hard as everyone else. C&#039;mon, girl, don&#039;t belittle that s___. Just own up and do it!<br /><br />Part of me kinda likes Natasha, but probably because if I were ever on a reality TV show, I would be the weird one too.<br /><br />Renee is my favorite to win, but her personality is a little irritating. Oh well.

				I think you mean Dionne re the dancing--Brittany got kicked off last week.<br /><br />I would think that maybe Natasha&#039;s just misunderstood, the language barrier, etc., but the phone conversations with her husband-or-whatever are too creepy for words.

				Ha ha. Yeah, that would be Dionne. Whoops.<br /><br />The phone thing was creepy, but I still think she&#039;s kinda of cool in a really bizarre way. Like, oh what was her name weird blonde girl from a season or two ago?

				Who is the favorite to win this season?&nbsp; Jaslene? Rene (aka Nene)?, Natasha (aka Nata)?<br />I think Natasha was a mess this week, but didn&#039;t think her picture looked any worse than the others.&nbsp; <br />I think Jaslene looks strongest to me right now, but my boyfriend is convinced Rene is going to win.<br />Anyone following the commentary/recaps on fourfour?

				I kind of feel like last week was building Renee up to win. I can&#039;t decide if I think they&#039;re tricky and want us to think it will be her and then have it be someone else or if they&#039;re not and it will be Renee.
