				Hello,<br /><br />I just changed sections of Astoria, I am looking for all kinds of suggestions for my new neighborhood, 41st St and 34th Ave.&nbsp; <br /><br />Laundry, nail places, food places (restaurants for take out, which delis have the best prices), and anything else! <br /><br />Thanks everyone!

				My suggestion is to start walking around the neighborhood and just pop into places to try them out on your own.&nbsp; You&#039;ll find out what you personal like verses what other people suggest. Oh, and don&#039;t forget you have the &quot;search&quot; option on this site - well worth spending some time looking around.<br /><br />On that note...you may need to walk over to Broadway since 34th Ave doesn&#039;t have quite as many commercial places.

				Hi Neighbor!&nbsp; I live at 42nd St &amp; 34th Ave.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a very &quot;local&quot; start for you:&nbsp; The Brazilian by the pound place on 34th Ave at 45th (or so) is great even for a non-meater like myself.&nbsp; Cafe Bar (currently closed for revovation), my home away from home, is on 34th Ave at 36th St is my go to place for brunch, drinks, dinner, hang-out.&nbsp; The dry cleaner at 34th Ave &amp; 42nd St is reliable.&nbsp; Pathmark is just up the street at 42nd &amp; Northern Blvd.&nbsp;

				I also live nearby on 46th.<br />There are 2 laundromats on the same block on 34th ave btwn 44th and 43rd. i use the one with the blue awning since its the closest to me.<br />the gyro place on 45th street is pretty good. i don&#039;t want to see them close! it&#039;s kind of a random stretch. <br />i usually get my haircut at studio 34. they don&#039;t take plastic but mina (or mila...i forget) is good. <br />only place i&#039;ve ever had my nails done is angel spa on steinway just off 34th ave.<br />pathmark is just up the street, but there&#039;s also the shopping center on 48th with the stop and shop (in addition to the marshall&#039;s, old navy, aj wright, conway, closeout paradise etc). typically the stop and shop tends to be cheaper. so i check their circulars online weekly like the uber nerd i am. <br />time cafe on 45th and bway isn&#039;t super great, but its pretty good. <br />I wish we had a good diner nearby but bel aire delivers this far. well, there&#039;s a new one on norther blvd btwn 45 and 46 but i&#039;m a little scared since the last one was pretty sucky.<br />if i&#039;m going to get pizza/past delivered i get it from lentini&#039;s. i have frequently been disappointed in gino&#039;s which is much closer.<br />if you like indian, seva delivers in this direction. a lot of places don&#039;t seem to like to deliver to 34th ave. <br />King Garden on 43rd and 34th ave has all your chinese and japanese food needs met.<br />that&#039;s what i can think of. feel free to ask anymore about this end. i was beginning to think i was the only person on this board in this neck of the woods.

				You know about the Entenmann&#039;s outlet for bread (and delicious baked goods) right? It&#039;s not exactly a &quot;hot spot&quot; but I&#039;ve saved a ton of money buying my bread there since I make my lunch every day. They sell them 3 loaves for $3 - I take it home and freeze what I&#039;m not using since bread freezes well. They get deliveries Wed - Sat. I actually just came back from there and their bread shelves were full, and they had additional carts that they were stocking. It&#039;s not just boring/unhealthy white bread either - I got a couple loaves of whole grain and one of seedless rye.<br /><br />I made the mistake of going there a couple times on a Tuesday and they had barely anything. But if you go later in the week, you should be good.

				I&#039;m in this neck of the woods also.&nbsp; I would add to the above:<br />San Remo&#039;s on Steinway Street if you need a really good tailor.&nbsp; It&#039;s right around the corner from you.<br /><br />I love the Bravo Supermarket on 34th Ave.<br /><br />The Museum of the Moving Image is just a few blocks away!<br /><br />For take out places that are nearby I usually do Guacamole, Lite Bites, Pollos Mario, Happy Gathering Feng Garden, Il Bambino.<br /><br />There are many, many very good restaurants in these parts.
