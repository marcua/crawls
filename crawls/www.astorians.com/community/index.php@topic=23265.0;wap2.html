			Got my Board of Elections VOTE notice today, and my normal election pollsite has been changed from my usual PS10 to St. Joseph School. Plus, upon opening it up, all the pages were glued together. Not what I usually expected. You practically have to tear every page apart and there are still some stuck together. Anyone else experience this? I&#039;m wondering if this is legit.

			Wow, Bob, it&#039;s a good thing you brought this up.&nbsp; I checked my mailing and it does give a new polling site, which is crazy.&nbsp; I live in Ravenswood.&nbsp; Why wouldn&#039;t the entire housing project have the same polling site? I have to look into that.&nbsp; The error cited in the New York Times article is beyond belief.<br /><br /><br />The low-tack glue on my packet was just around the perimeter, to keep the many multi-lingual pages together.&nbsp; It came off in clean stringiness.
