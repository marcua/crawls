It was, in a sense, the AOL of it&#039;s day. A second service, more serious (or a lot duller) was The Source. The Source was the first service I paid to use.<br /><br />Access was through modem on a telephone line from a dumb-terminal, or a PC with a terminal emulation program. 2400 baud was high speed access. Everything was text - no graphics, unless you count :-)<br /><br />Each service had modem pools in some major cities. A couple of X.21 network providers offered wider coverage - Uninet and Tymnet were two of them. You would dial the local Uninet or Tymnet number, and when it answered, you&#039;d request to be connected to Compuserv, or whomever.<br /><br />Services offered were e-mail, special interest document libraries, and bulletin-boardish things, organized around interest groups. People edited and moderated these things in exchange for free usage, and for the opportunity to push people around.<br /><br />Compuserv also had an online chat thing called &quot;CB&quot; (after citizens-band radio, popular around the same time.) CB felt sort of like IRC, but there were a limited number of channels, and they were numbered rather than named. After a week or two, you&#039;d learn what peculiar interest found a home on which channel.<br /><br />Minicomputers got cheaper, and Uninet and Tymnet were looking for more business, so other services appeared. Many targeted individual consumer and small group use as a primary product. Delphi was one of them.<br /><br />I joined Delphi as a lower-cost alternative to The Source - a handful of Source users jumped ship around the same time. It was a real bargin. I think $6/hour when I started, later falling to maybe $4.50. The Source cost a lot more, maybe $12.00/hour, or $10.50at the lowest, and really expensive during business hours.<br /><br />One month on the Source, when I fell in love with some other user, my bill was around $650.00. Not as expensive as Spitzer&#039;s love life, but it seemed an awful lot at the time. After that, I learned to logon, download everything of interest, and log off to read it.<br /><br />Delphi offered special-interest message boards, e-mail, and a good online chat system. The chat was better than Compuserve&#039;s: named, user-created channels. And it had a smaller, and (so far as I could tell) more intellectually sophisticated user community.<br /><br />Delphi kinda fell apart from fragmentation - competing services for specialize interests appeared - and from the rise of the internet. I didn&#039;t realize it had become an internet site.<br /><br />That is a probably more than you or anyone wanted to know - a real Abe Simpson answer.<br /><br />I will now resume rocking in my chair, grumbling, and whittling toothpicks.<br /><br /><br />

				&nbsp;A good f___ costs nothing, but gives much. It reaches those who receive without making poorer those who give. It takes but a moment, but the memory sometimes lasts a lifetime.

				A horse and a chicken were playing in a meadow.&nbsp; The horse fell into a mud hole and was sinking.&nbsp; He called to the chicken to go and get the farmer to help pull him out to safety.&nbsp; The chicken ran to the farm but the farmer couldn&#039;t be found.&nbsp; So he drives the farmer&#039;s Mercedes back to the mud hole and ties some rope around the bumper.&nbsp; He then threw the other end of the rope to his friend, the horse, and drove the car forward, thus saving him from sinking.<br /><br />A few days later, the chicken and horse were playing in the meadow again and the chicken fell into the mud hole.&nbsp; The chicken yelled to the horse to go and get some help from the farmer.&nbsp; The horse said, &quot;I think I can stand over the hole!&quot;&nbsp; So he stretched over the width of the hole and said, &quot;Grab for my &#039;thingy&#039; and pull yourself up.&quot;&nbsp; The chicken did and pulled himself to safety.<br /><br />The moral of the story?<br /><br />If you are hung like a horse, you don&#039;t need a Mercedes to pick up chicks.

				There was a young girl who lived up in the hills of Tennessee. She was about to turn sixteen, and couldn&#039;t wait to get her driver&#039;s license.<br /><br />She had been subjected to much ribbing from her older brother, telling her that she was too dumb to get her license.<br /><br />When the big day came around, she passed the test with flying colors.<br /><br />She rushed home and asked her father if she could use the car that night so she and her friend could go in to town where all the cool kids were at.<br /><br />The father said, &quot;Sure honey, but you&#039;ll have to give me a blow-job first.&quot;<br /><br />Wanting to go to town real bad, she agreed.<br /><br />As she went down on her father, she suddenly jumped up an said &quot;Dad your dick tastes like s___&quot;<br /><br />Oh yea, her father replied, &quot;I forgot, your brother&#039;s got the car tonight.&quot;<br />
