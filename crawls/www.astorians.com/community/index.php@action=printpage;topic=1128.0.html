				the best dish in astoria was at kebob cafe last week. &nbsp;the garlic stuffed chicken made me cry it was so good. &nbsp;Something your perfect grandma cook would have made if she was Egyptian. &nbsp; Ali may be one of the best cooks around.<br /><br />Best meal in astoria: Last year at lil' bistro 33 chef gary served up some amazing sushi and then served seafood soup, followed by a perfect tasting menu including some great wine and amazing sake. pink peppercorn ice cream too. very original and unique food served up by a real character and lover of all things food.<br /><br />best meal in NYC??? &nbsp;Thats hard to do. &nbsp; right now I think back to my post wedding meal with Jen at cafe des artiste. &nbsp;a full on traditional french tasting menu with paired wines followed by a carriage ride in the park. &nbsp;A bit corny maybe but we were just married and it made for a wonderful evening.<br /><br />this post is a great idea!

				As far as Astoria goes, I haven't taken full advantage of the cullinary delights it has to offer. &nbsp;But the greek food is high on the list. &nbsp;As far as in NYC...<br /><br />Peter Luger. &nbsp;Period.<br /><br />I'm a huge steak fan. &nbsp;And all I can say is amazing. &nbsp;Lived up to the hype.

				It's hard to say I've had an amazing meal here in NYC simply because I haven't really been here very long. &nbsp;But there are incredible elements of meals that I can highlight:<br /><br />The black beans at Churrascaria Tropical. &nbsp;I still remember how smooth and savory and wonderful they were.<br /><br />A lamb and pomegranate dish at Kabob Cafe. &nbsp;My housemate Laura had it after we signed the lease on our apartment, and I got a taste of that dish and boy was it amazing!<br /><br />The vegetables in the tagine at Jour et Nuit during our first astorians dinner.<br /><br />The pastries at Laziza.<br /><br /><br />D'oh, I just reread it and these are all places in Astoria!

				Best meal I ever had was at Aquavit. We must've had about 6-7 courses, all small, but with such an exquisite variety of flavors and textures.<br /><br />Best meal in Astoria was Mombar, the Egyptian place on Steinway St. (you can't miss the Eye of Horus decor on the front of the building.)

				A new one...<br /><br />Balthasar on Spring Street. &nbsp;My brother was visiting, and we dropped $275 between the two of us...<br /><br />Worth every penny.

				I like the chicken/rice plate guy with a cart at Steinway and 34th ave.. and also the Punjabi taxi stand on Houston and 1st. &nbsp;Super cheap, and as above, worth every penny.

				Best ever: &nbsp;Bite tasting menu at Aquavit. &nbsp;Twice.<br /><br />In Astoria: &nbsp;you mean I have to choose? &nbsp;Some selections:<br /><br />-Ostrich &quot;filet&quot; at Trattoria L'Incontro<br />-Picanha fatiada (sliced sirloin with garlic) at Sabor Tropical<br />-foie gras, smoked duck breast and seared scallop app at 718<br />-my own cooking (seared duck breast; strip steak; seared scallops)<br />-the uni sushi at Go Wasabi the last time I had it. &nbsp;It's not consistent, but the last time it was simply the best uni I have ever had.

				my favorite meals thus far in nyc by cuisine.<br /><br />Chinese: Nu Green Bo<br />Japanese: Tomoe (possible best meal to be had in world.)<br />Pizza: Grimaldis/Patsy's/Lombardi's<br />Steak: Lugar's<br />French: Boulet, but Im hoping to get to per se this winter<br />Italian: Hard to say, Lupa's or Tratoria l'contre (in astoria no less). Might make it to po this winter though.<br />Greek: Stamatis (I prefer the newer one on broadway)<br />Indian: Jackson hole diner (jackson heights stop on 7. Awesome and dirt cheap.)<br /><br />I read in another thread someone complaining about chinese in nyc... You are crazy; while in astoria there is nothing, take a cab to flushing sometime.

				Has anyone been to Agnanti over on Ditmars and 19th (right at the corner of the park)? It's the best Greek food I've found in the 'hood.

				Favorite in Astoria... El Boqueron, hands down.<br /><br /><br />In all of NYC... that's a tough one. I've also had great dining experiences at Aquavit and Balthazar. (Aquavit gets my vote for one of the most inventive and unexpectedly delicious desserts I've eaten-- raspberry-yellow bell pepper sorbet. Sounds a bit odd, but the flavors were perfectly matched.)<br /><br />For great pasta... Massimo al Ponte Vecchio, on Thompson St. They have an appetizer of grilled portobello, creamy buffalo mozzarella &amp; eggplant that is wonderful-- the portobello just melts in your mouth. And what's great is you can order their pasta dishes by the half order, so dinner for 2 people you can sample 4 different ones. I was especially impressed by the rigatoni with grilled shrimp &amp; curry cream sauce, and the spaghetti with an egg yolk sauce and bits of crisp bacon.<br /><br />Perhaps my most extravagant dinner experience in NYC was at Daniel... the tasting menu with wine pairings. It truly was a food-gasm :-)

				it's just so hard to answer! &nbsp;:-)<br /><br />Trattoria L'Incontro - I have never been disappointed<br />Po-just ate there once but i want to try it again<br />Khyber Pass - I just had some amazing Afghan food there tonight<br />L'express - I've had lots of good experiences there, nothing incredibly fancy but a nice onion tart<br />Pearl Oyster - so far the best caesar salad I've ever had.<br /><br />My neighbor makes the best dolmas in the world<br /><br />Pita hot makes the best lamb pitas. &nbsp;drrooool.<br /><br />there's a morrocan place that I really like but can't remember the name of - it's near Astor place.<br /><br />And there's Al Omda. &nbsp;I went there with a friend one hot summer day, one of those days when it's almost too hot to breathe. &nbsp;The place was nearly empty except for a few Egyptian guys at the back. &nbsp;We asked for the fish to share, and the waiter said that they didn't have fish that day. &nbsp;I said, &quot;Oh, but it was on the specials board&quot; and with no more fuss he left the restaurant and came back a few minutes later with a fish from the market. &nbsp;They cooked it with lemon and tomatoes and spices. &nbsp;We had foul madama, pita and other stuff. &nbsp;It was delicious. &nbsp;At the end he brought us mint tea. &nbsp;I was hesitant to drink hot tea in the hot weather but to my surprise it cooled me off.<br /><br />More recently i went there with a crowd of friends and got an amazing shrimp tajine and smoked hooka.

				The best meal I ever had in New York (or anywhere) was not in a restaurant, it was just an impromptu group of young folks eating paella on the floor of an East Village storefront in the 60's.<br /><br />Best meal in Astoria: &nbsp;I can't say.
