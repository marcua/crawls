				Couldn&#039;t disagee more J trane. But I thought you hated the show, so why are you watching ?<br /><br />Neighbor, you are right. David Archuleta is absolutely mesmerizing as a performer. The fact that he is without conceit, with such a humble aw shucks personality makes him all the more endearing.&nbsp; I think this year&#039;s goup is more talented than ever and I like that for the first time they are allowing the singers to play instruments as well.&nbsp; <br />

				I was disappointed to see how Randy, Paula and Simon criticized his performance.&nbsp; It probably has something to do with the fact that Archuleta, by far, stands out in terms of talent in comparison to the other contestants.&nbsp; The Idol producers wouldn&#039;t want the show to get too boring if everyone is raving about one particular contestant.&nbsp; Anyway, that&#039;s my theory.

				The male contestants are so much more plastic, ultra-stylized and made up than I&#039;ve ever seen, and they are just such a bunch of cheese balls.&nbsp; Archuleta is the most talented, but he should be doing broadway.

				<br />what are you watchin if not American Tool?<br /><br /><br />No matter how much you like Cyndi Lauper, I think she is still underrated.<br />When will a surprise like that appear?<br /><br /><br />You could put any of these folks in a lineup with their namecards, and I still could not pick out any stars.<br />I think I just like the time machine element of the song choices.

				I always watch American Idol even though hardly anyone on it ever appeals to me. My musical taste goes more toward the alternative and slightly odd. I like that they&#039;re finally allowing instrument playing, even if no one appears to be a stellar instrumentalist. And maybe I&#039;m jaded, but I&#039;m not all that impressed by David Archuleta. He&#039;s a talented singer, but so far he&#039;s kind of boring. Of all of them, I like the Amanda Overmyer the most. Her voice isn&#039;t perfect, but I think it&#039;s interesting in a good way. Plus I like her personality; she&#039;s obviously not conditioned for this sort of thing. I imagine she&#039;s not going to win. None of the guys interest me much. I was especially not happy with the guy who tried to imitate Jeff Buckley&#039;s version of &quot;Hallelujah&quot; (1.5 minutes of it, anyway) and the fact that the judges gushed over it.

				I admit it, I watch it.&nbsp; This season though, I haven&#039;t been as into it.&nbsp; It&#039;s too much of a time investment for me when it starts out when it seems like it&#039;s dragged out over three days a week, two hours a night.&nbsp; This season, I watched a tiny bit of the auditions, and then caught none of Hollywood week, but have been sporadically watching the semifinals on TV, and those that I didn&#039;t catch, I watch on YouTube.&nbsp; <br /><br />No one&#039;s really blowing me away at the moment.&nbsp; David Archuleta is good and will make it really far I&#039;m sure.&nbsp; I think the guys in general are better than the girls this year.

				ADDICTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I cannot miss an epi! I vote too! Call me a loser, go ahead! LOL<br /><br />I do not like David A! I think he is conditioned for this sort of thing more than the other contestants. I also think they are focusing on him a little too much. My faves...David (the rock one), Brooke (anyone else think Simon wants her? LOL) and Jason Castro.<br /><br />I didnt like this weeks too much but I will never stop watching. I am also a Simon LOVER...he, the show and everything surrounding it, is my guilty pleasure!!!

				I think they&#039;re conditioning David Archuleta for one of those big dramatic vote-offs where everyone boos and the judges blame America.

I feel like he is trying too hard and is boring. Each week I don&#039;t get it. The judges LOVE him. I keep waiting for Simon to agree with me. <br /><br />YES! I think Simon wants Brooke. I really like Jason Castro too. I fear he won&#039;t win, but I really like him. His &quot;Hallelujah&quot; was amazing.<br /><br />My faves - Brooke, Amanda and Carly.<br /><br />Chikezie kicked arse this week. Who knew?

				O.K., so who is going home tonight?<br /><br />My choice:&nbsp; Kristy Lee Cook<br /><br />She really stunk up the place last night, and that comment from Simon about her sounding like Dolly Parton on helium was right on the money.&nbsp; She needs to go...and fast!

				Home tonight...<br /><br />Either Kristy, country gal or Amanda, cannot stand her voice!<br /><br />Amanda is the votefortheworst.com candidate so I doubt she is going anywhere. So bye bye Kristy!<br /><br />At this point, who do you truly feel may win american idol? <br /><br />I think top 2 will he Jason Castro and David A.

				These are my favorites in order of preference:<br /><br />Carly Smithson - amazing strong voice<br />David Cook<br />Michale Johns<br />David Archuleta<br />Brooke White<br /><br />I think it&#039;s too soon for me to narrow it down to the final two.&nbsp; For the past few weeks I&#039;ve really liked Archuleta, but I was not impressed by his performance last night.&nbsp; IMHO, Archuleta&#039;s voice just doesn&#039;t seem to lend itself to more upbeat music making him a bit vulnerable.&nbsp; I&#039;m a rocker fan, so I like Cook and Johns.&nbsp; Amanda Overmeyer sounds like she&#039;s screaming.&nbsp; I like Brooke because she reminds me so much of Carly Simon.

				I didn&#039;t think stripper David deserved to go home this week, but at least it&#039;s one less David to keep track of.&nbsp; Kristy should&#039;ve gone home, but I have a sinking feeling that she may be the token less talented but pretty girl who goes much further than she should in the competition.<br /><br />I too think that Simon wants Brooke.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s usually pretty clear when Simon has a favorite and Brooke is definitely one of this year&#039;s for him.&nbsp; I like her a lot actually.&nbsp; She&#039;s a little different from the other contestants.&nbsp; <br /><br />I thought Chikezie kicked butt this week.&nbsp; I was surprised he even made the top 12 and thought he was surely going to be a goner within the first two weeks, but wow was he good.&nbsp; I still don&#039;t have any real favorites at the moment.
