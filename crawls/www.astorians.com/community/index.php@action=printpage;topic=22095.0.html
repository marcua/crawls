				If you ever need to stop in one of the free standing T-Mobile locations, for your own good, steer clear of this one. I stopped in to transfer my contact list to my new phone, and regret the decision immensely. Not being a tech person and slightly behind the times, I finally decided to upgrade to an android from a flip. I have never had any problems at any other free standing T-Mobile locations, so I had complete confidence as I walked through the door. There was only one other person they were finishing up with, so during the bulk of my stay, I was the only non-employee there. As soon as they found out I was not going to buy a 4g device, I was ignored. One of the staff went as far as to pick up my old phone from the counter look at it, toss it back, and went to staring at her own cell phone. The person who finally did help me was clueless and permanently lost 50% of my contact list. His only comment was &quot;It happens.&quot; It seems a simple &quot;I&#039;m sorry&quot; is too much for this apathetic group. Conversely the T-Mobile on 36th and Ditmars is wonderful. They have a great informative and helpful staff. As far as 3808 Broadway is concerned, buyer beware!

				Why would anyone go to these &quot;Authorized Retailers&quot; when there are actual locations owned by T-Mobile both on Steinway and Ditmars/31st Street?&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;

				I went for convenience because I was meeting someone and was closest to that store. When I was near the 31st street store, it was extremely busy, and I was in hurry.&nbsp; I have worked with in the Steinway store in the past and have had mixed experiences. While your point is noted, the authorized retailer on 36th and Ditmars has extremely good customer care and a great staff.
