				Happy summer to all.<br />Appreciating many posts and considering it will take me a little time to catch up on other news. The Astorian activists are inspiring.<br /><br />(If any direct comments or questions, feel free to send me messages.)<br />Some quick highlight notes<br /><br />- Team Gioia has an event this weekend by the &quot;beach&quot; in Queens<br />http://www.ericgioia.com/ <br /><br />- Congresswoman Maloney and an encouraging number of her colleagues look for Iraq to be defended by Iraqis rather than by US troops. I would call this a vote for peace.<br /><br />http://www.congress.org/ <br />congressorg/issues/votes/?votenum=288&amp;chamber=H&amp;congress=1092<br /><br />http://www.votersforpeace.us/<br /><br />- more candidate announcements in the race for Governor<br />http://www.ny.lp.org/news/2006weldreplaced.htm<br /><br />( I will be curious to see what primary contests there may be this year among other parties.<br />The GOP has FASO as their candidate. Maybe this means the activists of the GOP reject the hopes of voters like myself.<br />If you somehow dont know, the Democrats have SPITZER hoping to win the office of Governor.<br />When will it be known who are their candidates for Senate?)<br /><br />&gt;LIBERTARIAN PARTY OF NEW YORK (LPNY) www.ny.lp.org FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br />&gt;Richard Cooper (contacts deleted)<br />&gt;<br />&gt;LIBERTARIANS NOMINATE WELD REPLACEMENT<br />&gt;<br />&gt;Westbury, NY 6/20/06 By nominating John Clifton for Governor and Donald <br />&gt;Silberger for Lt. Governor, the Libertarian Party of New York (LPNY) will <br />&gt;restart its campaign for statewide ballot status which stalled when William <br />&gt;Weld dropped out of the race on June 6th, according to LPNY State Chair <br />&gt;Richard Cooper. John Clifton is a Navy submarine veteran, a social worker <br />&gt;against the welfare state, and a former drug counselor against the war on <br />&gt;drugs. The Jamaica, Queens resident of NYC says he is for freedom both <br />&gt;personal and economic across the board. Clifton is expected to emphasize <br />&gt;privatized educational options, property rights and marijuana legalization. <br />&gt;Clifton, who is African-American, terms big government, eminent domain <br />&gt;abuse, gun control and the welfare state forms of &quot;neo-slavery.&quot; Clifton <br />&gt;endorses Weld&#39;s proposal to exempt from NY income tax those who earn <br />&gt;$75,000 a year or less. He plans to visit Albany on Monday, June 26th to <br />&gt;campaign.<br />&gt;<br />&gt;Donald Silberger is a SUNY-New Paltz math professor, whose primary focus is <br />&gt;uniting the supporters of gun rights and drug legalization. He is troubled <br />&gt;by our rising prison population of those who have done no harm to others. <br />&gt;Both Clifton and Silberger have run for US Senate previously.<br />&gt;<br />&gt;Weld withdrew his candidacy in a fax to Chair Cooper. &quot;..., I am unable to <br />&gt;pursue further the gubernatorial nomination of the Libertarian Party of New <br />&gt;York (LPNY).... I am grateful for LPNY&#39;s support and look forward to <br />&gt;continuing to advance our mutual message of lower taxes and smaller <br />&gt;government in the months and years to come.&quot; Cooper responded &quot;I thank Mr. <br />&gt;Weld for his encouraging words and hope that we will be able to work <br />&gt;together again. Now, Libertarians will go forward with the message that <br />&gt;what America and New York needs is to remove the Empire State from our <br />&gt;lives.&quot; -30-.<br /><br />For a couple of examples of candidates that speak to my hopes, take a look:<br /><br />http://www.russellforsenate.org/<br /><br />http://www.lesczynski.com/<br /><br /><br />A number of candidates will require voter signatures to be on the ballot.<br />You can help decide currently how many choices we may have in our democratic process.<br /><br />(For another candidate for nonviolence:<br /><br />http://www.serve.com/ecobooks/voterachel/ )<br />
