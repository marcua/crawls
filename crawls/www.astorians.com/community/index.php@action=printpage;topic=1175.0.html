				I'm in need of a simple power adapter, and have, after several unpleasant experiences, vowed never to patronize Radio Shack again. The quality is poor, the customer service is arrogant and patronizing, and sin of all sins, they put me on a direct marketing mailing list when I specifically and explicitly told them not to. :x<br /><br />Is there any other electronics gadget store in the neighborhood? Specifically, I'm looking for a USB2 cardbus power adapter, so any computer supply stores may have what I need as well...

				I don't know if PC Richard (35th &amp; Steinway) carries what you're looking for, but you could try them.

				I hadn't thought of them. They seem to have more consumer goods than electronic equipment. Next time I'm down thataway I'll see what they have...

				Seems like Best Buy would be another good place to look and they are located in various locations in the city... There's one not too far from Astoria, I think.

				If it's computer stuff you're looking for, I recommend Digitcom Technologies at 53 - 05 Broadway http://www.digitcomtech.com. It's not a big place, but it's geared toward computer do-it-yourselfers, so they have a good selection of items at very reasonable prices. The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly, and is happy to order anything you want if it's not in stock. I've been there about four or five times, and have had nothing but good experiences with them. They even have a decent selection of Mac compatible components, and add-ons, which for me is a big plus.
