				I&#039;m 5&#039;2, and right now I&#039;m staring at a 12&#039; high, 6&#039; thick, and infinitely wide red brick wall with an electric barbed wire fence on top.<br />Can anyone recommend a headhunter? It&#039;s time I got a real grown up job. I don&#039;t want to turn this into a rant about how my job sucks, because truthfully, its not that bad. But I do need to give my resume to someone who can get me a real job. I&#039;m not sure if &#039;headhunter&#039; is the correct term. Any recommendations will help. :)

				http://www.decorum-ny.com/<br /><br />These guys were a good temp-to-permanent agency. I got my current job through them, recommended my roommate, and he got a permanent job through them. When I was temping way back when, they had a nice range of different opportunities. I recommend them highly.

				temp to perm scares me. not having a job frightens me a lot.<br />To be honest, I do want a perm job in one field where I have experience, I just happen to be fkexible since I have experience in serveral different fields. The problem, is that I&#039;m a total doormat. I&#039;ve tried to stick up for myself, but since I&#039;m scared of being unemployed I don&#039;t. My last job I got hired for purchasing, but for the first year I worked there, I got bounced between other positions &#039;filling in gaps&#039; My current job, hired me as a file clerk with the understanding that I&#039;d be assisting the purchasing department, but instead I&#039;m answering phones! I was told 2-3 weeks but it&#039;s been 10. :( <br />I appreciate everyones responses. anyone want m resume? :D

				I frgot to mention, I am now reluctant to check craigslist. I was very blatantly lied to about this job, (which I got thru craigslist) and now I&#039;m rather hesitant to interview with small business owners checking craigist because it&#039;s cheaper to post a want ad on craigslist than monster &amp; careerbuilder. I rather like the idea of a headhunter who knows the companies that they deal with. I&#039;m not totally anti-craigslist, and certainly not anti-small business, but for my next move, I would rather stay away from both initialy.

				Try Advantage (http://www.advantagestaffing.net/). I got my first decent gig in NYC through them and was hired on as a permanent employee. <br /><br />In my experience it&#039;s much, much easier to get a temp job than to get a permanent job. And most places I&#039;ve temped at have wanted to hire me.

				KidMurdock, thanks for the clarification.<br />Well, in an ideal world, I&#039;d be entertaining recently rescued kittens, or helping out recently &#039;rescued&#039; women who had been trafficed into this country and forced to prostitute themselves while being held as basically slaves, but in a world where I have bills to pay and no interest in becoming sucidal or homicidal, I would like a job maintaining already existing databases, such as inventory files, or something similar in the purchasing field, such as as position as a buyer or returns coordinator. I have experience doing all of that. I actually do have some management experience, but I&#039;m not interested in persuing it.<br />I would like to apologize for all my spelling mistakes and typos, as well as my lack of expressive language (emoticons and italics) I am on my phone so it makes things difficult.

				i don&#039;t know.&nbsp; no offense to anyone in the business, but i just don&#039;t trust employment agencies.<br /><br />in my experience, it seems they just want to get as many people into their ledgers that they can so that they can tell their clients that they have all of these people to choose from.&nbsp; a long time ago, i went to a ton of agencies and filled out a bunch of applications.&nbsp; they would give me a typing test, and say, &quot;thanks, we&#039;ll call you when we have something.&quot;&nbsp; then i never heard back from them.&nbsp; i guess it was this experience that left such a bad taste in my mouth for these places.<br /><br />granted, this was a long time ago...before i had any real work experience...but i have a feeling that it also had something to do with the fact that i&#039;ve never fit into this conventional fortune 500 look.&nbsp; now years later, i&#039;m in-between jobs, and i refuse to even consider the agencies as a viable job-hunting option.<br /><br />today, i&#039;m pretty much mid-career and my experience is basically in trafficking for ad/direct mail agencies.&nbsp; i don&#039;t want to do secretarial work and ideally, i&#039;m looking to go from the print medium to video/tv/film/radio/internet/etc.<br /><br />is there anyone that can make a suggestion of some sort...especially someone who may work at an employment agency?

				I&#039;m not much of a fan of recruitment agencies either, but, sadly, they&#039;re a necessary evil.&nbsp; Unless, you have ins through a network of people, those agencies are part of the game that has to be played to get corporate jobs in the city.&nbsp; I just wish they didn&#039;t test me at every damn place.&nbsp; It&#039;s so demeaning. <br /><br />I&#039;m not looking at the moment but I may have to depending on how my company&#039;s situation turns out.&nbsp; Just in case, does anyone have any good legal recruiter (specifically, paralegal recruiters) recommendations?
