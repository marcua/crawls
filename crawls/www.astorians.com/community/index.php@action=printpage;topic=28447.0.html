				Anyone know what happened? I live above the bar and it&#039;s always drove me batty-its so loud and never tried to be nice to the upstairs neighbors...so I&#039;m pleased...but curious!

				I&#039;m not sure when that happened, or even how official it ever was. I just know that every time I went in there, that there was a heavy gay representation to the point where I just figured that was the theme. Maybe I&#039;m wrong?

				I don&#039;t think Sissy McGinty&#039;s was ever officially a gay bar - just had a gay clientele, but it was always pretty mixed when I was there, maybe 40% LGBT, and 60% straight.&nbsp; I do think they did a few gay nights when bars in Astoria were experimenting with that.

				I went to Rapture a few years ago and it didn&#039;t seem to be a gay bar to me.&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s changed since then.&nbsp; It was definitely a straight place

				Too bad. It was the only bar in Astoria that I know of that was perfect for getting a date all worked up for a little sumthing sumthing ;) Just the darkness and cozy sofas made it so intimate. The Sangria special on Saturdays was a good deal too.
