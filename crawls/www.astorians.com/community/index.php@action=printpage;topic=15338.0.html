				The Renaissance Charter School in Jackson Heights, a highly successful K-12 school with excellent graduation rates and test scores, is opening a &#039;sister school&#039; that will serve grades 9-12. This new high school, called the Renaissance Charter High School for Innovation, will be located in District 30, which covers Astoria, Long Island City, Sunnyside, Woodside and Jackson Heights. Innovation will serve about 125 students per year, a size that is big enough for increased programming opportunities but small enough so that, as a parent once put it, &quot;a kid can&#039;t get lost in the shuffle if he tried.&quot; <br /><br />Just like the original school, Renaissance Innovation will continue to develop leadership and provide amazing support and opportunities for its students. We have a three tiered educational model of core classroom instruction, portfolio-based annual individual projects and hands-on, experiential learning. Our College-Bound program is top-notch, featuring a college prep class, portfolio-building and internship opportunities. We have very strong inclusion models for Special Education students and English Language Learners.<br /><br />As a former student of the Renaissance Charter School, I can honestly say that a second school with the same model would highly benefit the young people in our neighborhood. Western Queens is in need of a quality public high school option that allows its teachers to tailor instruction to the needs of its students, and our charter status allows us to do just that. The current Renaissance Charter School (TRCS) is at capacity. We need this new high school to further provide an empowering education to the many other young people in our communities.<br /><br />Renaissance Innovation plans to build and sustain a strong relationship with the neighborhood and the community. We would love to discuss our plans and hear your thoughts. Please feel free to email me at rchsi.info@gmail.com or post your questions and comments up on this thread. If you would like more information or to meet with us, don&#039;t hesitate to ask.<br /><br /><strong>If you like the sound of this school, we need YOUR HELP to make it happen!! If you are the parent of a current 7th-grade student, your child is eligible to be a part of our first freshman class and we need your name on a petition of support. You can find it at www.renaissanceinnovation.com - print it, fill it out and mail it to the address provided. We have until JULY 1 to collect these - please help us if you can, and pass the information on to any 7th-grade parents you know. The petition is not an application or a commitment of any kind. It is simply a statement of interest.</strong><br /><br />Thank you!<br />Emma Wisniewski<br />The Renaissance Charter High School for Innovation

				I have visited and applied for the Renaissance Charter School for my child in the past and I think it would be a great idea to create a sister school so that more students could have a chance at getting accepted.&nbsp; Is that link correct?&nbsp; I am having trouble with it.
