				Dear gc nyc &amp; MTW:<br />I signed up this morning and our old share partner joined with us again, but if one of you is a member, maybe you can both join together. . . .the vegetable and additional fruit share came to $628 for the season . . . it&#039;s worth it for the quality you get.

Some people split 6 ways and said it was too much, others split between 2 people and found it okay... I got 14 solid meals for 2 people a week out of my full share.

Some shares have both parties volunteer, others just one volunteers, others split a shift. 4 hours is one distribution day, helping plan an event, etc. It goes by really fast.

				Hi!&nbsp; I&#039;m interested in being someone&#039;s partner for a vegetable share and either sharing the fruit share or paying for the whole thing myself.&nbsp; I&#039;d like the tomato and strawberry shares (whole or half, either way) as well.&nbsp; Is anyone still looking?<br /><br />Thanks!<br />Sandra <br />646 421 5755

				Hi! I&#039;m a current member of the 2008 season for the Astoria CSA and I am looking for anyone interested paying me for a half share of the veggies! (I&#039;ve also signed up for tomatoes, and fruit, plus the three week fruit extention if you are also interested in half of the tomato share or fruit.) A full veggie share will, according to their website, be able to feeds 3-4 non-vegetarians.<br /><br />Please email me at (email address is written out here to avoid spam):<br /><br />regina_furens at yahoo dot com<br /><br />Contact me if you are interested!<br />

				Hello all-<br /><br />I am moving out of Astoria and must look for a good home for my 1/2 Hellgate fruit/veggie share (pick up at Freezepeach).&nbsp; Must be available for Tuesday evening pick-ups, as I had promised my share partner I would do that.&nbsp; A half share is perfect for one or even better for someone who already has a share but just wants a little more.<br /><br />Thanks!<br />-darcee

				I&#039;m selling my share as I now have something every Tuesday that keeps me from getting there.&nbsp; My share has always been plenty for two people for a full week and my share mate is great.&nbsp; PM me if you&#039;re interested and we&#039;ll set it up.&nbsp;
