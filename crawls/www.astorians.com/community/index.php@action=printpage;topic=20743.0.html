				I was there over the weekend.&nbsp; Here are some details:<br /><br />They’ll be open from 7:30am-4:30 on weekdays, 9am-4:30pm on weekends.<br /><br />Their bread comes from Balthazar Bakery, as do their pastries.<br /><br />Their coffee is from Coffee Labs Roasters in Tarrytown NY.<br /><br />They use Hudson Valley Fresh milk, which comes from cows in Dutchess and Columbia Counties, so it’s pretty local.<br /><br />Their soda syrups are from P&amp;H Soda Company, based in Queens.<br /><br />A number of their cheeses (mozzarella, feta) originate in the neighborhood.<br /><br />Craft beer and kombucha are coming this summer, along with extended hours.<br /><br />The space is rife with visually engaging, beautiful and sturdy reclaimed materials.<br /><br />They’ll do espresso drinks, coffee brewed over ice, pour overs, and are considering doing their iced coffee in a cold brewed system.&nbsp; Sodas are simply soda water and syrup.<br /><br />Food is all made in house.<br /><br />Everyone involved is super nice!<br /><br />More here:&nbsp; http://weheartastoria.com/2011/03/the-queens-kickshaw-is-awesome/

				The coffee was excellent.&nbsp; The &quot;flavor profile&quot; was quite different from anything I&#039;ve ever had.&nbsp; They do use some serious coffee lingo, so unless you&#039;re fluent be prepared for a bit of head scratching.

				Went there yesterday at around 2.&nbsp; Got a lovely coffee (Ethopian Yirgacheffe) and croissant.&nbsp; The line was long - they were totally slammed by that point.&nbsp; Part of the way someone let us know that the kitchen had temporarily run out of food, which was a bummer but not too surprising.&nbsp; What impressed me was how they handled it.&nbsp; They clearly took that seriously and passed out business cards with a handwritten note from co-owner Jennifer Lim offering $2 off for us to come back another time so they could make it right. I appreciated that.&nbsp; So I&#039;ll be back all right.&nbsp; I think they&#039;re a fabulous addition to the neighborhood and, judging from the comments on their Facebook page, so do a lot of other Astorians.&nbsp; :-)

				really cool space. very rustic. has an ambiance similar to sweet afton, which is good.<br /><br />best tomato soup in the hood. grilled cheese was really good but maybe a little too greasy.<br /><br />probably a coffee snobs heaven. serious coffee, but not fast since they brew each cup individually.<br /><br />everything they serve is probably in that book &quot;Stuff White People Like&quot;.&nbsp; :-D<br /><br />my only complaint is the soda is a little overpriced. $3.50 for a medium sized glass.<br /><br />all the other prices are reasonable.

				Re: wi-fi, laptops at Queens Kickshaw: I asked Ben (one of the owners) how he felt about laptop hanger-outers, and he said, &quot;oh that&#039;s fine, we want people to feel comfortable here.&quot; And he mentioned that he envisioned the back &quot;communal table&quot; as places where people could work (to that end there are four plugs along back side) and all four other back tables have plugs too. No plugs up front though. <br /><br />If you&#039;re like me (and a freelancer) you don&#039;t feel guilty about camping out at local Starbucks, but WOULD feel guilty camping out all day at neighborhood haunts. BUT. Things are a bit dead after about 1:30 at Kickshaw and I have had my pick of tables here the past few days I&#039;ve worked here. <br /><br />So I think the moral is, if you bring your laptop, be kind and hang out at communal table, leave other tables for groups to sit on. :)

				Hey thanks for the info, Moodle.&nbsp; It&#039;s good to know there&#039;s an option like this in Astoria.&nbsp; I work from home and sometimes the internet is out, or there&#039;s noise construction going on, or I just need to get away and work somewhere else for awhile.&nbsp; The Starbucks on Ditmars royally sucks for this - it&#039;s way too busy and loud and they make it extremely uncomfortable to want to work there.&nbsp; The library is ok but the hours can be tricky and you can&#039;t eat or drink.&nbsp; Panera&#039;s cool if you like having your wifi cut out every 15 minutes by that stupid wifi agreement page.&nbsp; Options are limited.&nbsp; I&#039;ll def try out Kickshaw - the communal table is fine with me!

				no problem daisy! Another option in the afternoon is Cafe Bar. They are also pretty empty in the afternoons, have plugs and wi-fi, and the owners don&#039;t seem to mind if you hang out and work for a few hours (if you get coffee and/or some food, that is!)

				Just want to add that I had my first meal there today and I was more than impressed. The gouda sandwich was fantastic, the iced coffee, which is normally never something I get too excited about, was some of the best damn iced coffee I&#039;ve ever had (probably because of the blend and that it was cold brewed a barista friend told me).<br /><br />The owners were also incredibly warm and welcoming, eager to talk about how they make some of the drinks. When they realized my friends and I had never had matcha before they brought over a free glass to try out and it was quite good.<br /><br />Really excited to have this place in the neighborhood, can&#039;t wait until they are open later/start serving beer.

				IM IN LOVE.<br /><br />I hit up the Kickshaw with a friend after yoga last Saturday, you know, so that we could fill the void of any calories that we had burned previously....and I couldn&#039;t have been more happy with how I choose to fill my belly.<br /><br />We both stayed traditional and got the cheddar and mozz sandwich, that&#039;s served with a cup of tomato soup.&nbsp; The bread was toasty, like any good grilled cheese, but amazingly moist and chewy at the same time.&nbsp; Melted to perfection.&nbsp; The tomato soup was a wonderful compliment and had a hint of indian spice.&nbsp; $8 very well spent.&nbsp; They do cold-brewed iced coffee too.&nbsp; While it was delicious, I wish it had been bigger for $3.50

				We stopped by early for breakfast yesterday morning, and it was great. We tried two different kinds of coffee, and both were exceptionally well made, and clearly high quality.&nbsp; They were both strong without being bitter. My Panamanian something or another was the stronger of the two, and it was really nice.&nbsp; My better half got the Mexican Biosphere Reserve, and was definitely more mellow, something you could sit there and drink a few cups, as opposed to mine, where I felt one cup was definitely enough. <br />Then there were the egg sandwiches.&nbsp; For $3, I can&#039;t think of another place, really anywhere, that I can get an egg sandwich that good.&nbsp; Perfectly prepared eggs, toasted brioche, parmesean crisp for the cheese, and to top it off a maple hot sauce, that I wanted to drink straight. It was the prefect combination of savory and sweet with a hint of heat without being overwhelmingly heavy, as egg sandwiches can be. As soon as I was done, I wanted another.<br />They also got the OK to serve beer, so they had a good number of bottles stocked in the fridge, but at 9.30, I wans&#039;t quite ready for a beer.&nbsp; Had it been after 10, that would have been a different story. I do plan on heading back soon, though, to try some of the other grilled cheese sammiches and beers.&nbsp; Of all the new places to open up in Astoria, I&#039;ve been most impressed with this place.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if it was that I went in with low expectations or what, but I&#039;ll certainly be returning.

				Finally got &quot;real food&quot; today (i.e., not coffee).&nbsp; I enjoyed the manchego and ricotta sandwich, but actually found it too rich because the bread had soaked up a <span class="bbc_u">lot</span> of butter.&nbsp; My partner had one of the open-faced sandwiches (I think the feta one) and that seemed to be less greasy.&nbsp; I do have one quibble with the beer list: while they have some very esoteric offerings, very few are under $10.&nbsp; And they&#039;re not large bottles either (except for the 2 hard ciders); they all seem to be the standard 16 oz. or less.&nbsp; At least the drafts, when they come in, will be slightly cheaper.

				I could eat a whole bucket of those curried pumpkin seeds. That said, there needs to be more bacon on the menu.

				I was there on Saturday night and had a great time. I had a Rose and my boyfriend had a beer which is either Yin or Yang. While the prices of the beer were slightly higher, my boyfriend loved it and said it&#039;s so good it gave him a buzz for hours with just one beer. So quality wise it&#039;s definitely better than budlight or corona I&#039;d imagine (not a beer drinker at all). The rose was the best wine I ever had. All I need is one glass to get tipsy :). Had the Cheddar and Mozzarella which is another one of the best things on earth. I totally agreed with <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 14px;" class="bbc_size">juanahoya. The chef Chip needs to mass produce those curried pumpkin seeds! </span></span><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 14px;" class="bbc_size">I talked to the wife owner Jen and she&#039;s super nice and sweet. I&#039;m so glad that they open til late now that I can have dinner over there. I&#039;m going back to hang on Wednesday on my day off :D. Can&#039;t wait!</span></span>
