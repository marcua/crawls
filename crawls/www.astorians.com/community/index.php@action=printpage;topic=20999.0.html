				On Sunday my husband was walking through Astoria Park when he saw a cardboard pet carrier sitting open on the ground near the pool. The only reason we can think of for it to be there is that someone abandoned their cat or dog in the park. I guess I&#039;m posting this to ask people to please be on the lookout for a stray cat or dog in the area, and maybe bring it to a shelter or a vet if you find it. <br /><br />Can anyone else think of a reason someone would leave a pet crate lying open like that? DH and I are so upset at the thought of yet another person abandoning their pet. I know a lot of people are doing it these days because of the economy, but the thought of letting a critter go in the park like that just makes me sick...<br />

				I&#039;m DH :)<br /><br />I like the theory that the pet container was for beer, but it was lined with newspaper and both the box and the newspaper were dry when it had been been raining not 10 minutes earlier.&nbsp; I suspect beer would have sweat and made the newspaper wet.&nbsp; <br /><br />It could just have easily been a way to stash/transfer drugs anonymously, who knows?&nbsp; But I think you&#039;d want to keep an abandoned pet carrier out of sight of possible pet lovers.<br /><br />Very strange at any rate.

				So the other day, I walked into my house and the cutest black and while kitty was sitting on my sofa!&nbsp; He is truly the friendliest, most adorable little cat.&nbsp; I have not seen any signs anywhere.&nbsp; Well, this guy has made himself at home.&nbsp; He has been following my older cat around, who is showing him the ropes and he is also making friends with my two dogs.<br />&nbsp;<br />How did he get in?&nbsp; Well, I have one of those swinging doors in my basement which allows my cat to go in and out.&nbsp; It seems that the little guy figured it out and followed Charlie back home.<br />&nbsp;<br />It is a long shot, but I do live across the street from the park.&nbsp; In any case, we have another member of the family!
