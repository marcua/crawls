				A number of brokers have started advertising with us and the moderators have noticed a rise in negative comments towards their postings.&nbsp; See the comment by Oliver for a more blatant example.&nbsp; Brokers listings are entirely welcome on Astorians.com and we try to foster non-confrontational dialogue.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some of the comments towards business and broker listings are really unhelpful and unnecessary.&nbsp; &nbsp;The advertising section serves those communities and negativity can really discourage businesses from posting, if they see our site as unwelcome towards them.&nbsp; The Acropolis is a huge complex and the bed bug question has been addressed by NYC Native in other threads of his.&nbsp; &nbsp;The building I was in did make a concerted effort to eradicate the problem, and there is no evidence that the Acropolis is not doing the same.&nbsp; Anyone can get bed bugs.&nbsp; An entire complex should not condemned because of that fact.&nbsp; To say he is oblivious to the issue is highly accusatory without evidence to back it up, and it&#039;s no wonder he reacted the way he did.&nbsp; Still, it is a genuine concern and perhaps he has not adequately addressed it.&nbsp; Luis, have you spoken with management about these issues, and what steps has the building done to eradicate the problem?&nbsp; I do not want to derail this thread, so let&#039;s address it and get it out of the way.

I bought a bedbug mattress protector and also pillow covers. (http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/search/search.aspx/bedbugs/?order_num=-1&amp;sstr=bedbugs&amp;dim=1&amp;nty=1&amp;) I used all my 20% off coupons and saved a real bundle. <br /><br />Then you need to clear caulk (http://www.homedepot.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/THDProductCompare?prodComp_3=100024624&amp;prodComp_0=100173080&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=10051&amp;catalogId=10053&amp;remProdId=100657595&amp;prodComp_1=100662614&amp;errorURL=ProductAttributeErrorView&amp;keyword=clear%20l) all around the floors in your apartment. Between the floor and the baseboard, and if you have high molding in a room, get up there and do the same to the top side. You will need a caulking gun (http://www.homedepot.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Search?keyword=caulking+gun&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=10051&amp;catalogId=10053) but as they tend to be expensive, try to borrow one. <br /><br />I have two small dogs and I was VERY concerned about the use of the following item. I did my research and suggest you do the following in specific locations around your apartment. Buy human grade Diatomaceous Earth (http://www.earthworkshealth.com/detail.php?id=1) and a plastic applicator bottle (http://store.hello-gorgeous.net/apbowimesc6o.htmlsmall) from any of the local beauty supply stores. Lay down a small line of this stuff all around the bed, the doorway, electric outlets, telephone jacks, on shelves and floor of all closets and kitchen cabinets. Repeat this as the dust disappears. <br /><br />While my neighbors have had repeated outbreaks of bedbugs, I have not seen any. The exterminator checks my apartment when he is in the building doing extermination in other apartments and he gets down on the floor to look under bedroom furniture and still finds nothing. This was all recommended to me by another member of this message board (RB) and I will be eternally grateful to her.<br /><br />Interestingly, I haven&#039;t seen a roach or a mouse since doing this.

				Thank you, it was not my intention to cause trouble or make you feel undermined in any way.&nbsp; BB&#039;s are such a big problem in Astoria, NYC, nationwide, and I think it just goes back to my own personal experience in a similar, multi-family building, and wanting to spare others.&nbsp; Really wish someone had warned me.&nbsp; I realize now that I should not have said anything unless I had firsthand, current experience at the Acropolis.&nbsp; Word of mouth can be vicious and inaccurate. The government really needs to figure something out and fast.&nbsp; This is not the kind of problem that will go away on its own.&nbsp; It they are spreading like wildfire.&nbsp; All the best to you Luiz.&nbsp; I trust that you are an honest agent and would never rent a unit to someone if you knew or thought there could be a problem.&nbsp; Be well.

				A thought just occurred to me: When an apartment is rented or sold wouldn&#039;t it be nice if the broker or agent gave a &quot;How To Avoid Bedbugs&quot; flyer/spec sheet/printed advisory to the buyer/renter. If moving in to a newly refurbished place that is protected by the use of prophylactically applied essentials Astoria might be able to rid itself of this problem.

				Yes, this is a fantastic idea.&nbsp; I also think there ought to be a law that requires landlords to disclose to new potential tenants if the apartment they are moving into had been infested prior, or the building for that matter.&nbsp; I understand why they do not, because nobody would want to rent under those conditions and landlords usually shell out a lot of money to treat apartments, particularly landlords who own multi-family buildings.&nbsp; And it&#039;s not their fault that one of their tenants somehow, unknowingly brought a bed bug in.&nbsp; the problem is there is nobody to blame here and everybody loses. <br /><br />
