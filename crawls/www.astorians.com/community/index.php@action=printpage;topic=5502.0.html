We are calling upon our Congressional representatives and Senators to take action for:<br /><br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; an immediate withdrawal of all<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; U.S. forces from Iraq;<br /><br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; an end to the funding of this war except for the<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; safe withdrawal of all our armed forces;<br /><br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; no military attacks on Iran;<br /><br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; full funding of veterans benefits;<br /><br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; aid to reconstruct Iraq under Iraqi control;<br /><br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; the redirection of our tax dollars<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for social programs at home.<br /><br />This march is part of United for Peace and Justice’s national call for a massive outpouring of opposition to the war in locally based, decentralized actions throughout the U.S.

				I&#039;m curious how the NYPD will handle this one. They&#039;ve had a tough week. The last mega antiwar rally had given them a bit of a black eye with the bottling up of large groups of people who were not allowed to move freely, were openly video taped and detained/arrested w/out:<br /><br />habeas corpus |ˈhābēəs ˈkôrpəs| noun Law a writ requiring a person under arrest to be brought before a judge or into court, esp. to secure the person&#039;s release unless lawful grounds are shown for their detention. • the legal right to apply for such a writ. ORIGIN late Middle English : Latin, literally ‘you shall have the body (in court).’<br /><br />&nbsp;:mrgreen: I put that definition in specifically for any watching government &#039;lurker&#039; to ponder...<br /><br />Dress warm, bring appropriate ID, be safe and be peaceful.<br /><br />Rock on!

				Just got this e-mail from Ann, who is the big cheese of the APJ<br /><br /><strong>We will start gathering on the Manhattan Bound platform of Queensboro Plaza at 12:30 and leave for the demonstration at 1:00. If you are not able to meet us at the platform, the Queens contingent will be assembling on 36th St. between 5th and 6th Avenues. Look for our flock of peace doves.</strong><br /><br />I&#039;m not sure how many from APJ will be there.<br /><br />We do need bongos<br /><br />

				I met up with the astorians for justice and peace along with Frappe, Book Minstrel, Perachori, but I don&#039;t know if there was anyone else from the board with our group. The doves looked fantastic and there were about twenty of them flying along. <br /><br />The group was very welcoming to supporters and we had quite a strong contingent. The march was okay, very organized, not very loud. The boys in blue were out in full force but nothing necessitating any action was observed. It was a nice civilized march, but not reminiscent of days of yore, unfortunately.

				I also met up with the AFPJ group at Queensboro Plaza.&nbsp; TRX was there, too.&nbsp; Alexa and Frappe, we must have met!<br /><br />The doves looked great, and Ian the Dove Dr. helped me fix my ailing, floppy dove.&nbsp; The march was less colorful than ones I&#039;ve been to in the past.&nbsp; The energy was kind of muted. I was still happy to be there.<br /><br />I was tired and hungry by the time we arrived at Dag Hamarskjold (sp?) Plaza.&nbsp; I took a bunch of pictures, and will post them up on flickr tomorrow if I can get my computer up and running.&nbsp; <br /><br />We did have a beautiful day.&nbsp; Thanks to AFPJ for organizing the meeting up at QB Plaza and for the events approaching the march (vigil yesterday and the talk on the Iraq War on Thursday).&nbsp; Was nice to see some familiar faces out there today - just wish I had been able to recognize other astorians (except Bookminstrel and TRX, who I already knew)!<br /><br />Will post the link to the pix I took as soon as I can.

How many are listening? **<br /><br /><br />

				Hey, Meg, I&#039;d love to get a copy of that picture. Here&#039;s what I&#039;ve found online so far:<br /><br />The AFPJ group...<br /><br />http://www.flickr.com/photos/tecpatl/426325143/<br />http://www.flickr.com/photos/tecpatl/426323519/<br />http://www.flickr.com/photos/tecpatl/426323485/<br /><br />Lots of people appreciated my favorite sign! Here it is...<br /><br />http://www.flickr.com/photos/tecpatl/426320895/<br /><br />(phrasing nailed down as: &quot;I can&#039;t believe I&#039;m still [expletive] protesting this [expletive]!&quot;)
