				Need a little assistance fellow Astorians... I&#039;m thinking of taking the trek on the N to Coney Island before it closes (I&#039;ve never been).&nbsp; Has anyone done it?&nbsp; The only directions I&#039;ve seen are take the N to Stillwell Ave - then what?&nbsp; Is it worth it?&nbsp; Any recommendations?&nbsp; Thanks!

				You can make the trip quicker by taking the Q express part of the way. I usually get on the Q at 57th Street and then get off in Brooklyn at Atlantic Avenue and then take the N the rest of the way. It makes the trip considerably shorter. Have fun!!! :mrgreen:

				Alternatively, you can take the Q all the way to Brighton Beach and then walk to Coney Island on the boardwalk. It&#039;s a fairly short walk and you can enjoy watching the sea and the beach.

				This is why I love Astoria and Astorians - everyone is so helpful!&nbsp; I love the idea of walking along the beach for a bit so I think the Q is the way to go.

				It&#039;s better to come in on the Q, you get a nice view after you make the turn into West 8th Street station.&nbsp; If you look to the right, you can see where Luna Park used to be, and where the Aquarium is, that was Dreamland.&nbsp; I rode the Cyclone a few times and went on the Wonder Wheel.&nbsp; It&#039;s probably the last year for Astroland, what with Thor Equities jerking the place around.&nbsp; This might be the last chance anyone has of seeing Old Coney before the place is...upgraded, as they say.&nbsp;

				I went to Coney this past Labour Day. Rode the N, left me off at Stillwell and wow did they do a nice job fixing up that station. I hadn&#039;t gone down there in probably eight or nine years. I didn&#039;t think to change for the Q at 57th, that would have saved a little time, but I just brought a book for the ride and found a comfy spot to sit for the ride down. It didn&#039;t feel as long a ride as I thought it would.<br /><br />
