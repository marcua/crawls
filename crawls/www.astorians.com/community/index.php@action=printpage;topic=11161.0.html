				We just went on Friday, and loved everything.&nbsp; I highly recommend the stewed rooster, leek pie (not on the online menu; started with a P), mussels in wine sauce (with stewed tomatoes and feta), grilled sardines, Greek sausage, and the zucchini &amp; cheese croquettes.

				awesome, awesome restaurant. <br /><br />be aware though, they really try to talk you into getting more food at this place....&quot;upgrading&quot; to their larger sizes. <br /><br />like the cod cakes....the appetizer size is probably plenty as an entree....but they really hard sell you into ordering more, which of course you end up taking home. <br /><br />:mrgreen:

				The Greek Salad literally makes you believe in God.<br /><br />Also the Shrimp appetizer than has baked feta cheese on it is amazing. Those are the two best things on the menu.

				hm, I&#039;ve never had a problem with them trying to sell me more than I already ordered. My favorite stuff to get there is of course the Greek salad, and also the aforementioned shrimp appetizer with the tomatoes and baked feta. The stuffed kalamari is excellent, nothing like your usual fried calamari rings. One time I got the pasta with rooster. All very good.

				I always like to go small plates style at agnanti. my favorites are the stuffed calamari, herb and cheese croquettes, the app. size baccalo and there is this salad that is called cretan rusk, it is amazing, tomatoes, feta and capers on this crusty bread, so good! Though I have had pretty much everything on their menu, and really have never been disappointed.

				Ok I went to Agnanti the other day and we got the stuffed kalamari. It sounds delicious, but BEWARE! If you are squeamish about weird looking food then do NOT get this. <br /><br />It actually tasted pretty good, but it is not the calamari Americans are used to. It is a huge piece of calamari that looks like a mini version of Jaba the Hutt. And when you cut it, all of the &quot;stuffing&quot; (that looks gross but tastes good) comes oozing out in a very unappetizing manner.<br /><br />Overall it tasted fine, but it really looks nasty. Not only were we grossed out by the way it looked, but two other tables ordered this dish and they reacted the same way. Luckily that kind of stuff doesnt bother us too much, because we got past it and enjoyed the appetizer. But we were with a friend who almost vomited when we cut into it. It was funny.

				hm.. I never thought it looked weird. Have you ever had any kind of stuffed fish before? I mean it&#039;s just a grilled calamari steak with some &quot;stuffing&quot; in it.

				A friend and I just ate there we had small plates: <br /><br />Santorini fava spread: Very light dip, went well with pita<br />Grilled Octopus: Very big and meaty portion. If cooked right, it will be very tender<br />Baccalo: Very good fish fritter with a lethal garlic dip&nbsp; :evil:<br />Kefte: Meatballs with yogurt sauce. Which was awesome.<br /><br />All very good. The bill came out to 64.00 and that included a carafe of wine.

				Why is this place packed???&nbsp; &nbsp;I need to rant a little about our dinner there....<br /><br />I took my in-laws there based on all the praise, but they hated it.<br /><br />There were flies buzzing all over, which is pretty gross (I know it is open to the outdoors, but still!).<br /><br />My MIL order a fish special ($32!) and it was good, but that is crazy especially since all it came with were some cold greens.<br /><br />All of our food was pretty greasy.&nbsp; The apps were ok, but small portions.<br /><br />And somehow the prices of the 3 drinks ordered by the table almost doubled.<br /><br />For 4 people we spent almost $140 and we were still hungry!<br /><br />I would definitely NOT recommend this place.

Haven&#039;t been there in about a year, so it&#039;s possible it&#039;s gone downhill, but I&#039;ve only ever had excellent experiences there as far as the food is concerned (service was always a bit spotty, never being sure if the waitress got our order down and things sometimes coming out at strange times). Love the Greek salad, stuffed kalamari, shrimp giouvetsi. Haven&#039;t had a problem with flies. Sorry you had a bad experience. Agnanti is one of my favorite restaurants and I&#039;ve taken friends and family there, all have loved it.
