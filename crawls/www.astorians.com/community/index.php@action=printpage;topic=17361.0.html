				Does anyone know anything about getting into Section 8 housing in Astoria.&nbsp; Through age and disability, I&#039;ve become eligible to apply for Section 8 but I&#039;ve been in Astoria for almost 15 years now and I don&#039;t want to leave the neighborhood.&nbsp; Does anyone know if they let you pick a location or do they just send you where they want to?:)

				Section 8 allows you to choose if the landlord is aprroved and willing to accept section 8 as opposed to public Housing where you go where they say with some exceptions
