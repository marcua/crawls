				&nbsp;<strong>For more information please click here.</strong> (http://www.usaid.gov/locations/asia_near_east/tsunami/ngolist.html)<br /><br />Hi Friends,<br />&nbsp;<br />As you know Asia got hit by the biggest tsunami we have ever seen. &nbsp; Thousands of people have been taken by it. &nbsp;It is the biggest natural disaster that we have ever experience and the numbers of lives taken keeps on rising two fold everyday since it hit. More people could die from diseases and hunger. &nbsp;<br /><br />This is a disaster that we can't ignore or depend on other people to give. &nbsp;This is a world wide disaster that is going to effect us all. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />I've provided a great link (see below) for the Relief Organizations that are or will be working in the disaster areas. &nbsp;Please check out the page and do your own research on the organization and please please give to the organization of your choice. &nbsp;Any help is welcome but in this case money is the best and most effective donation you can make. &nbsp;Because it's more direct and can be put to work faster. &nbsp;Unlike food and clothing which have to be ship out to the disaster area. &nbsp;That can take weeks even months plus money to ship supplies to the disaster area. &nbsp; The American Red Cross lets you make a donation as little as $5 and you can use your credit for it. &nbsp;It's easy by phone or online. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Thanks for taking the time to read this.<br />&nbsp;<br />Happy safe and healthy New Year &nbsp;to you all.<br />&nbsp;<br />Fidel Ramirez<br />&nbsp;<br />http://www.usaid.gov/locations/asia_near_east/tsunami/ngolist.html

				Just did it, relatively painless with a credit card....probably the fastest way to help. I heard this morning on NPR that $100 will pay for the shipment of $1000 of medication and water putrification! <br />I chose AmeriCares...no specific reason...there must be more than a dozen other charities to choose from..................just do it!<br />(I wonder how much more $ will come from private americans than from our 'kinder, gentler government?)

				I don't know about you but I'm a little dissapointed to see that the U.S. has only pledged $350 million for the disaster relief efforts. Japan has pledged $500 million, I think we can do better.<br /><br />Especially when you consider that the total estimated cost of our fat-boy belly flop in Iraq will cost over $100 BILLion. Seems like we could at least afford $1 billion in aid.<br /><br />Seems like our &quot;compassionate conservative&quot; president really isn't that compassionate at all, although when it comes to helping others he sure is being quite conservative.<br /><br />To email the president: president@whitehouse.gov<br />Vice-Pres: vice-president@whitehouse.gov<br />Senator Clinton: &nbsp;http://clinton.senate.gov/email_form.html
