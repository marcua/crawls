				I&#039;m having trouble with my Time Warner cable box and was wondering if anyone here might have had the same issue. Yesterday my cable started responding really slowly, then got worse until it froze up completely. The unit was running pretty hot, so I unplugged it overnight to see if that was the issue. Today I tried to reboot and it didn&#039;t seem to want to. I got the Mystro &quot;initializing, please wait...&quot; image on the screen and it won&#039;t go anywhere from there. I&#039;ve tried several times now and gotten nothing.<br /><br />Anyone else had this issue before or know how to fix it? Given my past experiences with TWC, I&#039;d rather not call it in until I have to.

				I&#039;m actually having a different problem with Time Warner Cable. For about a week now, several channels that should be part of my free package (Fox Movie Channel and AMC, for example) are now displaying the message &quot;To receive this channel, call customer care at...&quot; I haven&#039;t called TWC yet, hoping this problem would go away on its own. Has anyone else had this problem?

				I had that problem with my old TWC box as well. I exchanged it for a new one at the Queens Center Mall. I asked for a different brand and got a Scientific Atlanta to replace a Samsung, and I haven&#039;t had any problems with this one. <br /><br />As for the other issue, I have seen that message before, but the picture has come back if I switch to a different channel and then switch back.

				<br />I&#039;m just chiming in to say that I just today canceled my TimeWarner cable service and the digital phone service, which I only had installed because their great &#039;deal&#039; was to get cable/internet/phone for $99/month.&nbsp; I never even plugged in a real phone to the newly installed socket.&nbsp; Come to find out that the $99/month deal was really a $140/month deal since DVR, wifi, etc., is not included in the triple play package.<br /><br />I had been waiting for Fios to come to the neighborhood before I canceled, but that larger-than-I-feel-comfortable-with-paying bill coupled with the fact that I barely watch any actual cable television (Yankees games are, unfortunately, a big exception) but rather spent most of my TV time w/ Netflix discs and Xbox made me finally just completely cancel cable altogether.&nbsp; I&#039;ll watch the few cable shows I DO enjoy over the internet.&nbsp; Or wait a few months &#039;til the DVD comes out.<br /><br />Screw &#039;em.&nbsp; TW has taken way too much of my money.&nbsp; Once a competing internet provider arrives I&#039;ll cancel RoadRunner, too.
