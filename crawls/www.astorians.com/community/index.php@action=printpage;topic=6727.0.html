				Did folks see that the New York State Assembly Judiciary Committee voted along party lines yesterday to support the marriage equality bill?&nbsp; It proceeds to the Rules Committee today and may have a vote late this afternoon.&nbsp; It&#039;s likely to be a tight vote, but hopefully we prevail.&nbsp; Our local Astoria Assemblymember, Michael Gianaris, is a co-sponsor of the bill, as is Assemblymember Cathy Nolan, Assemblymember Jose Peralta and Assemblymember Jeff Aubry.&nbsp;

				In my capacity as Political Director of Marriage Equality New York, I&#039;ve been in daily contact with Assemblymember Daniel O&#039;Donnell, who is carrying the bill in the Assembly.&nbsp; He&#039;s optimistic about the vote today, but one never knows until the vote takes place who holds to their promises.&nbsp; Debate should be starting in about 10-15 minutes, if they start on time!

				If you go to the Assembly website, they&#039;re live streaming it right now.&nbsp; Some beautiful and moving testimony and some real jack-ass stupidity (sorry for the language).&nbsp; I am so ashamed of my friend Assemblymember Michael Benjamin and feel so sorry for the people represented by Assemblymember Townsend, I think he might be the least intelligent elected official I have ever heard speak.&nbsp; It&#039;s just shocking how dumb and inarticulate the poor man is.<br /><br />http://assembly.state.ny.us

				It just passed the Assembly - 85 in the affirmative, 61 in the negative, which means 4 did not vote.

				The Governor had the bill introduced and strongly supports gay marriage.&nbsp; For it to become law, it next has to pass the State Senate, but the Senate Majority Leader, Joseph Bruno, despite having an openly gay brother, has declared he will not allow a vote.&nbsp; We probably don&#039;t have the votes in the Senate yet (especially with bad folks like the Reverend Ruben Diaz serving as a Democratic State Senator), but when the Senate flips next year, we will pass the bill.&nbsp; I would expect same sex marriage in NYS in 2009.
