				I get a few channels basically 1-13 and local access ones through a cable in my apartment that comes out of the wall.&nbsp; &nbsp;The same channels you would get with an antenna, but I&#039;m not using one.&nbsp; Is the signal that comes through the cable out of the wall an analog signal or a digital one?&nbsp; When the switch from analog to digital happens, will this signal disappear because I don&#039;t have a box? Is my solution to buy this digital converter box with those coupons?&nbsp; I&#039;m just wondering if I need to get this box, or if I will continue to get channels through the cable in the wall.&nbsp;

				you&#039;ll either have to get digital cable or get that converter box. I have a very nice flatscreen HDTV and even it won&#039;t work. I got the free gift cards from the GOV but none of the stores carry the brand and style I want that works with the &quot;coupon&quot;. It sucks because I can even pick up the Food Network for free now (and TBS!) so I&#039;m pretty much set. :D<br /><br />https://www.dtv2009.gov/ (https://www.dtv2009.gov/)<br /><br />

				Thanks, Kerrigan.&nbsp; So I&#039;m assuming the signal coming out of the wall through the cable is an analog signal?&nbsp; I can&#039;t find that info anywhere.<br /><br />Assuming I have to get this converter box, has anyone had experience with the ones Best Buy sells:<br />http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?_dyncharset=ISO-8859-1&amp;id=pcat17071&amp;type=page&amp;st=converter+box&amp;sc=Global&amp;cp=1&amp;nrp=15&amp;sp=&amp;qp=&amp;list=n&amp;iht=y&amp;usc=All+Categories&amp;ks=960<br /><br />Hopefully if it doesn&#039;t work well, they would accept a return.<br /><br />

				Yeah, I didn&#039;t believe it either until my husband did all but make a PowerPoint presentation to explain that the digital part of cable has to do with hardware and has nothing to do with service, wires, antennas or airwaves.<br /><br />I&#039;m no technological dummy either, but I thought I was sitting pretty during this conversion because I had a new tv that used cable for feed.<br /><br />I think I&#039;m just going to end up with a box from Timewarner. I think the cheaper thing to do would be to get one of the coupon boxes and see what I get for free. PC Richards has some. The Gov programs gives you $40 in gift cards, and I thought that was pretty generous. Free stimulus checks, free digital cable converter boxes, a big expensive war . . . when you think about it, we&#039;re all rich mo&#039;fos. <br /><br />

				Ok, cool beans.&nbsp; I have the $40 coupon already, so I&#039;m going to go to Best Buy tomorrow and see what I can get.&nbsp; I would go to PC Richards, but in my experience, they are awful on returns and customer service, and in this case, I want a good return policy.

				I&#039;m pretty sure that KK is incorrect on this one. The analog/digital transition in 2009 refers to over-the-air signals only. The analog signal you&#039;re getting from your wall for free is almost certainly the basic cable service from Time-Warner. Do you get NY1? That and local access are on cable, not over the air. The number of channels that you can get will continue to decrease, as TWC transitions more and more to digital signals. (RCN is already all-digital.) There are two types of converter box here. The ones at Best Buy that are linked to will convert the over-the-air digital signals to a signal you can plug into your TV, for free. That will do nothing at all for the cable coming from your wall (assuming it&#039;s a TWC cable.) You can also get a digital cable box or a Tivo with a Cable Card (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CableCARD) slot, which will allow you to purchase cable TV from TWC without using one of their converter boxes. But you have to rent a card from TWC, which costs $40/month or whatever.<br /><br />Does this make any sense...? It&#039;s pretty complicated...!

				Well, that&#039;s the question.&nbsp; Is this signal coming out of my wall an analog signal?&nbsp; Will I lose it once TWC goes all digital?&nbsp; If so, it&#039;s helpful for me to get the converter box either way, because if I do lose that signal, it&#039;ll mean I won&#039;t get any channels.&nbsp; I don&#039;t wish to purchase a whole cable package as channels 1-13 are fine for me.

				Thanks Daisy for starting this discussion. &nbsp;I&#039;m totally old school (using rabbit ears) and have been ignoring the impending change. &nbsp;I hate all things technological. &nbsp;But after reading the posts, I got my behind in gear and ordered my coupon. &nbsp;

				Hey Daisy,<br /><br />Since you don&#039;t know what that cable coming out of your wall is from, I&#039;m going to hazard a guess that it&#039;s the same thing as the cable coming out of the wall in my bedroom.&nbsp; I realized relatively early on that it actually goes up to the roof and is (or was) attached to a big antennae up there.&nbsp; Chances are you have the same thing unless, like Harlan said, you&#039;re getting NY1.&nbsp; That would be a sure sign it&#039;s cable.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, I&#039;m guessing, yes, you&#039;ll need the converter box.

				Okay. What happens if you don&#039;t have rabbit ears; have a hole in the TV to plug in rabbit ears; don&#039;t have anything in a wall that looks like some kind of roof antenna and want not to use a cable company? Will the converter box work without the rabbit ears?

				To clarify on all points:<br /><br />1. The switchover that is taking place in February 2009 affects over-the-air signals ONLY.&nbsp; Cable (and satellite, and Verizon FIOS) will be completely unaffected, regardless of whether you have analog or digital cable and regardless of whether your television set is DTV or HDTV-ready or not.&nbsp; The switchover will only affect those that have over-the-air reception.<br /><br />2. The converters that are being sold are *only* if you currently receive your signals with an antenna, over-the-air, and *only* if you do not have a television set that is DTV or HDTV-ready (an older model, most likely).<br /><br />3. Analog cable will eventually disappear, I&#039;m certain, and when that happens, the white cable entering your apartment will not work anymore in the way you are using it now (connecting it directly to your TV and getting the channels that are not scrambled by the cable company).&nbsp; But whenever that does happen, it&#039;s completely unrelated to the over-the-air analog to digital switchover that is taking place, and the converter boxes being sold currently for over-the-air purposes will not help you get those digital cable signals.&nbsp; At most, your cable company will install a new digital cable box for you.&nbsp; Connecting the cable line to the analog-to-digital converter box *will do nothing*, because it is not over-the-air reception and it is thus unaffected by the February 2009 switchover.<br /><br />4. The converter boxes have an input in the back where your antenna (rabbit ears or rooftop antenna) can be connected.<br /><br />5. The converter boxes can be connected to your TV either through regular coaxial cable (the ones that have a thin, needle-like point at the end, most likely like the cable wire coming into your apartment), or through the newer AV cables (the ones that have a thicker point at the end and are color-coded red, white and yellow).&nbsp; Some older TV&#039;s only have the coaxial cable inputs, some TV&#039;s have both, and I&#039;ve seen some newer TV&#039;s that only have AV inputs, but the converter box will work with all of the above.<br /><br />6. If you don&#039;t have rabbit ears or a &quot;hole&quot; in the TV to plug in the rabbit ears, you can simply buy rabbit ears (or a rooftop antenna, if you are able to put one up in your location) and connect those to the converter box, which you can then connect to the TV with AV cables (supplied when you purchase the converter box).&nbsp; Without rabbit ears or a rooftop antenna, your converter box *may* work *if* you are in a location that receives a really strong signal...some possibilities would be on the upper floors of a relatively tall apartment building, or perhaps if your apartment/house has a clear shot of the Empire State Building and the Conde Nast Building (where the DTV signals originate).&nbsp; Since digital reception is an all-or-nothing proposition (you will either get a clear picture, even if your signal strength as measured by the converter box is fairly low, or you will get no signal at all if the signal strength is very low or nonexistent),&nbsp; if there is a strong signal where you are, you may be able to get, at the very least, the major NYC signals without an antenna of any kind, or even by improvising with a paper clip or wire hanger.&nbsp; Otherwise, you can purchase a simple pair of rabbit ears from RadioShack or BestBuy or even Eckerd or CVS for around $10 and that will do the job.<br /><br />One final thing:<br /><br />A surefire way to determine whether or not the cable entering your house/apartment is for cable TV or just connected to a rooftop antenna would be to scan the stations to see if any non-broadcast stations appear...NY1, the QPTV public access stations and a few others would likely appear on random channels.&nbsp; The rest of the channels likely will not have static or &quot;snow,&quot; but a scrambled picture, if it is a cable line.&nbsp; If it is an antenna, you will get static/snow on the rest of the stations.&nbsp; Some rooftop antennas will only give you a good picture for channels 2-13 (VHF), while others will get you channels 14-69 (UHF) as well.<br /><br />The reason for this is because many older buildings have VHF-only master antennas, whose elements are not tuned to receive the higher frequency signals of UHF.&nbsp; They were probably installed back in the days where there was nothing at all on UHF.&nbsp; Most rooftop antennas, however, have VHF and UHF elements and will get both kinds of signals.&nbsp; Why is this important?&nbsp; Because many DTV over-the-air signals will be broadcasting on the UHF dial.&nbsp; For instance, Channel 2 actually broadcasts on Channel 56, Channel 4 actually broadcasts on Channel 28, etc.&nbsp; However, the DTV converter box (and DTV or HDTV-ready TV&#039;s) will &quot;map&quot; those channels to their familiar locations...meaning your box will tune to those channels when you tune to 2, 4, 5, etc.&nbsp; However, if your house/building has a rooftop antenna that is VHF-only, you may have problems with many of the DTV signals, since most of them will be on UHF.&nbsp; (Rabbit ears that are sold will receive both VHF and UHF, so no worries there).

				Awesome, Neo.&nbsp; Thank you, that was very helpful.&nbsp; Considering I will be losing my channels no matter what I do, I&#039;ll be purchasing that converter box, and hoping I get a signal for at least 1-13.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t want to purchase cable service, as I don&#039;t have a need for a 100+ channels when I don&#039;t even watch that much tv.&nbsp; Netflix makes up for what I don&#039;t have in cable.

				neo11, thank you so much. I finally understand the whole thing. Although I currently get cable, I am not sure how long I will be able to afford it. Now I know that I need to cash in those coupons for converter boxes so that when I do give up cable, I will still get a signal. When that time comes, I guess I will also have to buy some cheap rabbit ears! What was Congress thinking? Although the coupons are worth $40 each, the Best Buy boxes are selling for $59.95. So, as I see the math (which I seriously suck at doing) $59.95 + $5.02 = $64.97 - $40.00 = $24.97. That means that with 2 TVs it will cost $49.94 out-of-pocket. That plus the potential cost of two sets of rabbit ears . . . just not effing fair!

				You&#039;re right, and I think that as we get closer to the deadline and the many millions of people who do receive television the old-fashioned way and are still unaware of the change find out what&#039;s going on, it&#039;s going to become a huge issue.&nbsp; <br /><br />Personally, I think the real issue behind this is not &quot;improved picture&quot; or any of the other supposed benefits of DTV (which, by the way, is not HDTV in most cases, with a few exceptions, like CBS2...because most stations split up their frequency to broadcast several sub-channels which reduces the amount of bandwidth available to each one)...but the fact that once the switchover is complete, the lower VHF frequencies as well as the UHF frequencies above 51 will be decommissioned entirely from television usage, and will be auctioned off, which is sure to bring in billions of dollars to government coffers.&nbsp; Telecommunications providers, companies like Google, etc. are already clamoring for a piece of that action, to expand cell phone networks, set up nationwide wi-fi, etc. <br /><br />Wilmington, North Carolina, actually became the first television market in the country to go &quot;all-digital&quot; as of a few days ago.&nbsp; The analog signals are all broadcasting text informing viewers that programming will only be available via DTV, and will continue doing so for another month before going off the air completely.&nbsp; This is supposed to be a &quot;test&quot; case leading up to the full switchover in February.<br /><br />It&#039;s also a sign of the times in many other parts of the world:&nbsp; the EU countries have a directive of their own to fully switch to digital television broadcasting by 2012, and some countries are already well on their way towards having phased out analog completely.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, our neighbors to the north and south will probably be sticking with analog for a little while longer.&nbsp; Even here in the states, analog TV itself won&#039;t die completely for a few years.&nbsp; Low-powered TV stations are not covered by the February 2009 switchover, and there is no switchover date set for them yet, though it is more or less inevitable that they will make the switch within a few years.&nbsp; Locally, there&#039;s a few LPTV&#039;s that will continue broadcasting as a result, such as Channel 6, which actually operates as a radio station, Pulse 87, broadcasting from &quot;the top of that big blue building in Queens&quot; (the Citicorp Building in LIC).&nbsp; If you&#039;re wondering how this is possible: in the NTSC television system used in North and South America, Channel 6&#039;s audio always comes out on 87.7 on the FM dial.

				Ok, so I just bought the Insignia converter box from Best Buy to test it out.&nbsp; It&#039;s a bit tricky to figure out the connections, and I got about 18 channels, although you don&#039;t get PBS at all.&nbsp; No NY1, no TBS, no Food Network.&nbsp; Dem&#039;s the breaks!&nbsp; For some reason, you get 3 channel 4s, 2 channel 5s, 3 channel 7s, and so on.&nbsp; And they&#039;re not all the same.&nbsp; And if you have a weak signal it gets all distorted and choppy until you move the rabbit ears again.&nbsp; Reminds me of Direct TV when a cloud moved in the way.&nbsp; <br /><br />Best Buy&#039;s return policy is a full refund until March.&nbsp; I&#039;m putting the box away for safe keeping until I lose all signals, then I&#039;ll hook it up again.&nbsp; &nbsp;To be honest, it&#039;s a big pain in the ass to have all these wires all over the place, and yet another something to plug in, and yet another damn remote.<br /><br />And it doesn&#039;t work well with VCRs at all.&nbsp; I read that you actually have to turn the box to the channel you want to record, even if it&#039;s pre-programmed in your VCR.&nbsp; So that means if I want to tape Lost every week, and have my VCR set to tape it automatically, I will have to remember to keep the channel on ABC, negating the whole purpose of pre-programming!&nbsp; &nbsp;:-P

				In my apartment I have rabbit ears = converter in my kitchen and the TV in the living room hooked up to the cable in the wall (it gets NY1, Food, etc).&nbsp; The kitchen TV is probably 15 years older than the living room TV, but with the rabbit ears / converter combo the picture is like a thousand times better.&nbsp; Unfortuantely, no NY1, no Food.&nbsp; The last time we had cable, I found out that Spike was unscrambled if you had a TWC box with no service, but it is not the case without said box.&nbsp; That means no UFC, boo-urns.&nbsp; Are there converters out there that will help with the digital switch if you&#039;re getting your TV from the cable?<br />I also went through all the experiments when I get my converter, first hooking it up to the thing in the wall, which resulted in nothing, and then trying it out with the rabbit ears, which worked like the charm.

				As far as reception goes, they should all more or less be the same.&nbsp; I&#039;m using the Insignia tuner, but I don&#039;t think there&#039;s major differences in the sets that are available.&nbsp; Remember, with digital broadcasting, you&#039;re pretty much going to get a clear picture or nothing at all, and as long as you have a decent pair of rabbit ears, or a rooftop antenna, or, if the signal is strong enough where you are, even a paper clip (!), you should have no problem getting all of the stations.<br /><br />Most likely you&#039;ll be able to receive 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 25, 31, 41, 47, 50, 68 plus the subchannels that some of them are operating.

				As bstewart also posted, some people may have trouble getting PBS (Thirteen) until the switchover, because they&#039;re still operating at low power on their digital signal, to save money.&nbsp; Come February, they should be operating at full power just like all the other major stations.&nbsp; Specifically getting the box with the analog pass-through shouldn&#039;t really be necessary, since you may still be able to get Thirteen in digital now anyway, and if not, the switchover is in two months.&nbsp; <br /><br />The box I have (an Insignia) has options for both an RF cable (antenna cable) and the AV cables (red/white/yellow)...most boxes should, with the knowledge that many people with older TV&#039;s will be buying them.<br /><br />Also as pointed out, some stations are operating subchannels and others aren&#039;t:<br /><br />4 - has Weather Plus (which I think will soon become an all-news channel) and Universal Sports (track meets, swimming, volleyball, etc.)<br /><br />5 - For some reason, is wasting its bandwidth rebroadcasting My 9 (co-owned) as its subchannel.&nbsp; Channel 9 is doing the same thing rebroadcasting Fox 5 as its subchannel.&nbsp; Not sure what the point of this is, as it takes away bandwidth from the main channel.<br /><br />7 - Has WABC+ (infomercials and rebroadcasts of Eyewitness News and some public affairs shows) and WABC Now (the same one also shown in Yellow cabs around the city, with news, weather, traffic and sports)<br /><br />11 - Has a station with Spanish-language music videos, LATV<br /><br />13 - Has an all-children&#039;s subchannel and one in Spanish<br /><br />25 - Traffic cameras, usually with really poor picture quality and tons of electrical noise.&nbsp; Leave it to the city of NY to have something this shoddy on the air.&nbsp; Their radio station, WNYE 91.5, was on the air but inaudible for two weeks...last year the analog Channel 25 went off the air for over a month.&nbsp; They just don&#039;t care at all, it seems.<br /><br />31 - One of the subchannels is qubo, with all children&#039;s programming, there&#039;s another one with gospel and religious stuff, and another one with infomercials, I believe.<br /><br />50 - If you can pull in NJN, there&#039;s two subchannels with additional PBS programming.&nbsp; They&#039;re trying to move their antenna to 4 Times Square, so it may soon be easy for everyone to get a signal from them.<br /><br />63 - If you can pull in WMBC from New Jersey (main channel has ethnic programming and a &quot;cult&quot; local newscast straight out of the 70s), the subchannels feature more ethnic programming in Korean, Chinese, Spanish, etc.<br /><br />The other stations, as of yet, don&#039;t have subchannels.&nbsp; CBS, for instance, apparently has a company-wide mandate *not* to add subchannels, and to instead broadcast a full HD signal over the air instead.<br /><br />There&#039;s also some low-powered stations that one might be able to get on digital, like the bible-thumpers on Cornerstone TV (Channel 3).&nbsp; I actually have never gotten a signal from them in digital!&nbsp; In the next couple of years, some more low-powered stations that are now analog and aren&#039;t bound by the switchover this February will eventually go digital.&nbsp; Nothing too exciting though, most likely...the likes of HSN, infomercials, paid programming, etc.

				It&#039;s really not too confusing at all once you actually experience it...I know it sounds a bit complicated.<br /><br />Once you have your converter box installed, you can pretty much tune your TV just as before...&quot;2&quot; for CBS-2, &quot;4&quot; for NBC, etc.&nbsp; You&#039;ll notice the subchannels if you start pressing &quot;channel up&quot; or &quot;channel down&quot; when tuning.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, if you are not interested in any of the channels...whether regular stations or subchannels...most converter boxes let you add and remove stations from the memory, so you can just tune to what you want and block out everything else.

				So I picked up a converter box the other day. I went to PC Richard&#039;s on Steinway. <br /><br />They only had the Zenith in stock so I ended up settling for it. It cost me $24.99 with the coupon. Not to shabby. <br /><br />I set it up. Everything is smooth only thing is that a lot of the channels lag (stutter, skip) kinda like TWC. That sucks...<br /><br />It never happened over analog.<br /><br />Overall the picture reception is decent due to the fact that I don&#039;t have to get up and move the bunny ears for individual channels. However, I noticed that there is this black line thing the constantly runs up the screen. It&#039;s not noticeable but annoying when on certain color backgrounds. Close thing to comparison is like when you camcord your TV or computer monitor and the video shows some kind of fuzz going up the screen. Just not that harsh....<br /><br />Here&#039;s my Pros and Cons:<br /><br />Pros: Coach Potato Friendly, TV Menu (TV Guide-like, shows description of show, time and next show), More sub-channels.<br /><br />Cons: Shotty image lags, weird black thing running up the screen, static can be heard at high volumes. <br /><br />All in all, the digital switchover isn&#039;t a work of genius whatsoever. Just a hassle and a means for people to go out and splurge more money to boost the economy. <br /><br />I would&#039;ve been better off with my regular analog. <br />

				I think a lot of the problems that you are having are likely avoidable:<br /><br />1. The image freezing might indicate that you need a better antenna to pull in a stronger signal<br />2. The black line might be the fault of your TV or the cable you are using to connect the box to the TV. <br />3. The static at loud volumes might be due to the difference in volume between your box and your TV, since the box has its own volume control.&nbsp; ALSO...another thing you can try is switching the audio output for the converter box from stereo to mono.&nbsp; A lot of older TV&#039;s do not have stereo speakers, and thus the stereo setting will give you a weak, staticky sound quality, whereas you&#039;ll get the full range of audio with mono audio.

				We may be the only people left without cable TV, but we just switched over from rabbit ears (on top on the TV, not rooftop) to a Digital converter box. Generally, we are fairly satisfied with it, but there seems to be one problem. For some reason, we no longer pick up PBS/Thirteen. Has anyone else noticed this?

				Yes, as was posted on the other thread, Thirteen has been operating its digital signal at reduced power, primarily to save money as they don&#039;t have the financial resources that the major networks do.&nbsp; They will switch to full power when the analog signal is shut off (which means one less electric bill for them to pay!).<br /><br />Something else that should be known about the switchover is that channels 7, 11 and 13 are going to be changing frequencies when the switchover takes place.&nbsp; I&#039;ll attempt to illustrate this as simply as possible:<br /><br />Right now, the DTV channels are operating on frequencies (channel numbers) other than the ones we are used to.&nbsp; For instance, Channel 2&#039;s digital frequency is 56, Channel 4&#039;s is 28, etc.&nbsp; Your DTV tuner, however, &quot;maps&quot; these stations back to their familiar locations, so when you press &quot;2&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, etc. on your remote, you see what you expect to see.<br /><br />7, 11 and 13 have been operating their DTV signals in the UHF (14-69) band as well, but once the switchover takes place and the analog signal turns off, they have chosen to move back to the 7, 11 and 13 frequencies.&nbsp; Also, Channel 2&#039;s DTV is going to move from 56 to 33, since, after the transition, the TV frequencies above 51 will begin to be used by other services (cell phones, wireless internet services, etc.).<br /><br />What this means is that your DTV tuner may need to be &quot;retuned&quot; to find these stations again.&nbsp; If, come February 17th, you have a DTV tuner or converter box and you are not receiving 2, 7, 11 or 13 anymore, that is going to be why.&nbsp; Retuning the box is as simple as going into the menu and selecting the option to run a scan again.<br /><br />Just one more thing to add to the confusion of this transition!

				Anyone out there already make the switch to a digital antenna?&nbsp; I know they pushed back the analog to digital transfer to June but I was wonder what people thought of their digital reception.&nbsp; &nbsp;Do you have better reception? More channels?&nbsp; A report on NPR said that many households have had so so results with the antenna including bad reception and the loss of channels.&nbsp; What is it like Astoria?

				I&#039;ve been using a digital converter since September. The channels that you can get are: 2,4,5,7,9,11 and some few others that I never watch. The quality is great, whenever there&#039;s signal. The reason why I don&#039;t always have signal, is that I&#039;m not using a real antenna, but just a piece of wire, sticking out of the antenna port of the receiver. It works very well most of the time, but I&#039;m sure that with a real antenna it would work perfectly all of the time.<br /><br />By the way, the antenna is exactly the same one that you&#039;re using to get analog TV, it&#039;s just that you need a converter box between it and the TV.

				We&#039;ve had the digital converter box for about a month and still use our old analog rabbit ears. We get<br /><br />2 - CBS<br />4.1 - NBC<br />4.2 - A weather-channel style (all weather all the time thing from NBC)<br />4.4 - Universal sports (which basically has nonstop downhill skiing)<br /><br />Two copies of FOX and My9 (5 and 9)<br /><br />7 - ABC <br />7.2 - same weather-channel style thing only by ABC<br />7.3 - what seems to be an all infomercial channel<br /><br />11 - PIX (old WB)<br /><br />sometimes we get 25 - (local NYC channel)<br />25.2 - a live feed of various traffic shots<br /><br />31 - ION (sometimes)<br />31.2 - QUBO (kid&#039;s channel - rarely comes in)<br />31.2 - ION Life (looks like a cheap knock off of &quot;Fine Living&quot;, again rarely comes in)<br /><br />a few Spanish channels and a &#039;Worship&#039; channel.<br /><br />We no longer get Thirteen/PBS for reasons people have cited above. I really hope they don&#039;t wait until June to transition too.&nbsp; :oops:<br /><br />Our reception has been spotty. We get frequent freezing and pixelation, which may be because we have a ground level apartment and no rooftop antenna. Our rabbit ears are actually hanging from the wall because this is where they get the best reception. Unfortunately, we&#039;ve noticed that whenever a train goes by, we suddenly get terrible reception. I finally realized that the train was shaking our building slightly (we are 1 block away from the 36th Ave stop on the N/W). This shaking made the rabbit ears shake as well and totally screwed with our reception. We had no idea how many trains came through during rush hour until this started happening.<br /><br />So it&#039;s been a mixed bag for us. The quality of the channels is clearer, but when they freeze or get garbled it can be incredibly annoying. I don&#039;t know if getting a digital antenna will help us, but I&#039;m going to look into it.<br />

				a big part of the reception problems with dtv is the fact that the digital transmitters are not running on full power yet , they wont be untill the switch over in June when the broadcasters shut down the analog transmitters
