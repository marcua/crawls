				I&#039;m not too up on the whole racetrack issue...but it seems that over the last few years the place has cropped up in the news.....and not in a good way. <br /><br />It sounds like the usual Albany crap......which will not get fixed this year as the machines pretty much kowtowed to the powers that be. <br /><br />Just wondering what others think.....A few Democrat leaders seem prominant in the investigation but it seems bipartisan in that one GOP Assemblyman was mentioned at length. <br /><br />A few quotes<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Those include: leaking of confidential bidding information to a favored company, potential bid-rigging, pay-to-play campaign donations, arm twisting by dozens of lobbyists and an indifference to facts that all resulted in a &quot;political free-for-all&quot; across the highest reaches of state government.<br /><br />To cap it off, on the night the lucrative contract was awarded, a who&#039;s who of Democratic lawmakers partied at a &quot;victory&quot; bash at the home of one of the winning bidder&#039;s lobbyists, who also happens to be a former state senator.<br /><br />The inspector general sharply rebuked the actions of Gov. David A. Paterson, Senate Democratic Conference Leader John Sampson and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver for their handling of a massive contract award in January to locate a casino at Aqueduct racetrack in Queens.<br /><br />Singled out for much of the stinging criticism — and possible criminal problems — are key members of the Democratic leadership of the State Senate, at a time when Democrats are struggling to hold onto their razor-thin majority in the Nov. elections./quote]<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">The investigation portrayed a disinterested and uninformed Paterson being fed misinformation from top staffers. The staffers left out such key information as fiscal experts in the governor&#039;s own budget division, as well as regulators at the state Lottery Division, advising that AEG was not qualified to get the contract worth potentially billions of dollars to the winner over the next three decades.<br />/quote]<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Fisch said Sampson was among the most active cheerleaders for AEG, and that at one point he demanded that a real estate developer friend and a group from Brooklyn, where Sampson lives, be a part of the AEG project.<br /><br />After the AEG deal was scuttled by the Paterson administration earlier this year, Fisch said Sampson told AEG that it should sue the state to get the contract restored./quote]<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Here are the two articles I found..<br />[url]http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/22/nyregion/22aqueduct.html/url]<br />[url]http://www.buffalonews.com/city/politics/article226640.ece/url]<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
