				Hi all! <br /><br />Is anyone out there interested in starting a craft &quot;collective,&quot; possibly even a branch of the &quot;Craft Mafia&quot; in Astoria?<br /><br />If something like this already exists here, let me know. I don&#039;t think we need to trek out to Brooklyn (where they have these sorts of things, it seems) to get some fun workshops/craft gatherings going.<br /><br />I make jewelry, but I&#039;m new to sewing and I would love to practice in a group with others who share the interest!<br /><br />Let me know,<br /><br />Morgan

				Oh i make jewelry too! Right now just earrings. And i&#039;m still learning the hard stuff.<br /><br />There&#039;s the astoria crafty knitters who mostly do just that, but they&#039;re open to other crafts.<br />But i like the idea of a craft mafia...especially if it was closer to my lazy ass than the ACK.

				Definitely, well I live around 30th Ave., so that&#039;s cool for me, too!<br /><br />I saw there was a knitting group, but I thought it was exclusively for yarns. I figured this would be more of a general collective, where people could bring all sorts of skill sets and interests to the table. Maybe even put on a few events!<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Are there any places you ladies would recommend for a get together to discuss this?

				hey dudes!<br /><br />a craft mafia would be awesome!<br /><br />until then, i run the ACK -- Astoria Crafty Knitty Group and it is held every Thursday at Freeze Peach Cafe. check out the calendar! mostly it&#039;s been knitters and crocheters, but we welcome all kinds of crafts and would love to see others come out for this.<br /><br />please join us next week if you like so we can discuss craft mafia things.<br /><br />i&#039;d really like to have some kind of workshops where we can learn, let&#039;s say, jewlry making, or collage, or sewing. not just knitting. i&#039;ve been offering knitting and crochet b/c that&#039;s what i know how to do. if someone else wants to step it up, by all means. <br /><br />let&#039;s continue this discussion. i&#039;d love to do this. keep in touch. <br /><br />Rosemary

				That sounds awesome, Rosemary, thanks for letting us know. I didn&#039;t realize there was more to it than knitting (also fun!). I say we all meet up at your next gathering and throw some ideas together about fun workshops/events we could plan.<br /><br />Does that work for everyone? <br /><br />I&#039;ll also bring some info about the Craft Mafia along.<br /><br />Let&#039;s make Astoria the hottest craft capital in New York;)

				hey everyone! we&#039;d love to have you next week. membership has been a little low in the past few months... some new ideas and new people would be awesome!<br /><br />i will warn you, i&#039;m moving next saturday, so i might be a little frazzled on thursday nite, but i will be there.<br /><br />if anyone wants to be put on the ACK email list, PM me and you&#039;ll be set. <br /><br />just some things i want to throw out there -- ACK has always been a very community oriented group. people drop in, drop out, come in when they can. people who have just been sitting in the cafe see us and join, or tell others to join, and that&#039;s awesome too. i have always offered to teach knitting or crocheting for free. i&#039;d like to keep everything at ACK for free as well.&nbsp; we have done other small things like make valentine&#039;s for each other and people would bring construction paper, scissors, glue, etc to share with the group.&nbsp; but i always ask that you purchase something from the venue (drink, snack, etc).&nbsp; <br /><br />now, please dont get me wrong, i&#039;m not knocking Freeze Peach, but sometimes i feel other crafts may not be conducive to the location. it&#039;s a bit tight.... so things like painting, maybe even sewing, can be cumbersome in that space without a good table, lighting, maybe even some patrons may become a little frustrated if they are close by needles or paints, or other crafty substances.&nbsp; that&#039;s why the yarn and needlecrafts have been doing well there i suppose.<br /><br />i am not going to cancel ACK. but i would welcome discussion of craft mafia like things and participate in them, so long as it doesnt conflict with ACK dates.&nbsp; a location that might have more space, and bigger tables where we can spread out would be awesome.&nbsp; when i read all this, i immediately thought of that other thread that is going around about &#039;hanging out space&#039; if that ever comes about, that would be awesome place to do things like this.&nbsp; (or at least, it seems like it...) <br /><br />yes, i do agree that there&#039;s a lot of crafty stuff going on in brooklyn, and not enough here in Astoria/LIC.... i KNOW there&#039;s lots of crafty people here.... let&#039;s all get together and make stuff! yay! <br /><br />can i get a show of hands (hahahah) of how many of you are planning to come out next week? if you could just post up by next wednesday (or pm me to let me know if you want) that would be great! that way i can try to give a heads up to Freeze Peach and see if we can clear out a space..... thanks!<br /><br />Rosemary

				I agree with the fact that things like sewing would be hard to do in a confined area. <br /><br />I know there are some studio spaces in the area, like the Women&#039;s Studio and some places in L.I.C. and something like that would definitely be a great place to craft, I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s possible or if they would be open to the idea of a group using a space as opposed to one person renting a studio, but that&#039;s something to consider!<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if anyone has heard of Etsy Labs (based on the Web site) over in BK, but that&#039;s sort of what I was thinking along the lines of. I realize they have a lot of start up capital and an established business-- but on a lesser scale, I know we could have some really cool workshops and events and such right here in Astoria.<br /><br />I&#039;ll head on over to the meeting Thursday and whoever else would like to come and brainstorm, that would be great! Unless, Rosemary, you feel it will be a conflict of interest with your group? (In case people there would rather be knitting instead of finding themselves in the middle of an unwanted meeting!) If so, we could designate another day this week just to get together and throw ideas around.<br /><br />Let me know what everyone thinks! I&#039;m excited for warm weather and crafts!<br />

				oh pfft... i believe jayme started the group to welcome all sorts of crafts. just an open community to come together you know? i will email the group, but i do not believe that anyone would object to this.<br /><br />yes, i&#039;ve heard of etsy labs (i was selling some of my items on that site, but took it down b/c of low inventory, and...life) and i&#039;ve seen the workshops that they are holding and they are great! but alas, i dont feel like trecking all the way to brooklyn and having to come back to astoria late at nite....<br /><br />i&#039;d love to have something similar to turn to here in astoria.<br /><br />yes, i&#039;ve pondered the Women&#039;s Art Studio, but i cannot afford the membership at this time. if you wanna start some discussion with the studio, that would be great. would it be open to males to join in activities over there? i&#039;d like to be part of a group that is open to all.&nbsp; <br /><br />ok, adornedbymorgan will be attending on thursday, who else is in?<br /><br />Rosemary

				Ditto. I knit, but can&#039;t make the Thursday evening meeting. Something earlier would work better for me too - I teach, so I&#039;m home by 5:00 most nights and go to bed early to wake up early. 8:00ish isn&#039;t <em>too</em> late, but earlier would be better...

				One possibility is to expand ACK- there is a new cafe Tell Astorya on 28th ave (where Waltz used to be).&nbsp; I&#039;m sure they would welcome the business.&nbsp; We could choose another night/time and agree to meet weekly, biweekly, or monthly.<br /><br />Just throwing ideas out.

				Darcee, that&#039;s a great idea as well. For those who cannot make Thursday to introduce ourselves, what about Wednesday next week at Tell Astorya? What times work?<br /><br />Also, I contacted two established art centers in the Astoria-LIC area, and I&#039;m afraid they both (don&#039;t know if I can mention names) turned down the idea of sharing their space, and one saw it as a conflict of interest to host a craft group in their studios.<br /><br />Maybe everyone can start racking their brains as to places you know of that would allow us to regularly meet, host workshops, enable larger projects with more materials (sewing/printing/metal/painting) and possibly even let us store supplies (for free or a small fee)? I would be happy to contact them if so. <br /><br />Although I think it would be really cool for all of us to get together first in person and discuss crafty group things, it can&#039;t hurt to start thinking of places that might allow for an expansion into other types of projects-- and wide, open spaces! (or something like that!)<br /><br />What about a craft session in Astoria Park? Can that happen? Like painting or screening or those types of things.<br /><br />This warm, summer weather has gotten my brain back into idea mode. I also gathered the necessary info about starting a Craft Mafia, and I will bring it on Thursday (and to any meetings next week, as well!) If anyone wants to check this out in the meanwhile: http://craftmafia.com/startyourown.html (http://craftmafia.com/startyourown.html)<br /><br />Enjoy the warmth and can&#039;t wait for tomorrow :-)

				hey morgan... i think these are great ideas. i look forward to reading stuff on the craft mafia... i read a little about it on the page you posted up, i dont know if i want to start a business, or sell lots of my stuff, my crafting has been slow going lately.&nbsp; <br /><br />i&#039;d totally be down for crafting in the park!!! that would be awesome! <br /><br />we can discuss about different locations. but freeze peach has been the home for ACK for the past 3 years, so we are always welcomed there for meet ups... <br /><br />so, who can i expect to see tomorrow nite?! post up here, or private message!<br /><br />Rosemary

				I could do Wednesday after 6.&nbsp; (Also could do Mondays).&nbsp; <br />I live close so I can check to confirm that they won&#039;t mind if we&#039;re there.<br /><br />Park crafting might be fun weekend adventures or uniting of Astoria crafty groups!&nbsp; I&#039;d even love crafting sessions in Socrates Sculpture Park after Saturday morning free yoga.&nbsp; <br /><br />As far as one connection, I know my sister Jayme has recently made CSA contacts with a friendly church in the Astoria Park area, not sure of the name but it could be worth a shot.<br />

				Hey everyone. I live in Astoria and I am a member of the NYC Craft Mafia. The New York City Craft Mafia has signed an agreement with Austin to be the exclusive craft mafia within the 5 buroughs of New York. We may be taking in some new members in the near future, If you are interested in membership, please visit our website www.newyorkcitycraftmafia.com.<br /><br />Last weekend we did a supply swap at etsy labs in Brooklyn. How great would it be to do something like that one day in Queens? The two we have done so far have been a huge success!<br /><br />It would be awesome though to get a craft group together in Astoria. Even if it isnt the Craft Mafia! I would totally be game for craft get togethers or mini labs. I sew and make soap and dabble in other things. <br /><br />My website is www.bejessie.com. Anyone intersted, lets figure something out!<br /><br /><br /><br />
