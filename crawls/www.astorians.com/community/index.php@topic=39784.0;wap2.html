			Looks like activity at the Voodoo Lounge as well. Plywood shelters up in front.

			Vogue you mean? On Ditmars? Fingers crossed they make something good happen in this spot, finally. I&#039;ll be asking the first worker I see on site and report back.

			<br />
			Yes, Right- VOGUE.. not voodoo. Somehow &quot;voodoo&quot; sounded better in my head.<br /><br /><br />The old Rosarita&#039;s(SP?)... The pizza place that took 3 years to open and closed within 6 months.

			Vogue Lounge didn&#039;t last long at all.&nbsp; it was very mysterious to me, with the dark curtains hanging in the windows. I&#039;m glad it closed and hope something good opens up in there.

			<br />I was told by someone in the nabe that it&#039;s going to be an Irish Pub, opened up by folks who are actually FROM Ireland....
