				I find this (http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/11/nyregion/11traffic.html?ex=1289365200&amp;en=cbfe92f02c7ca75b&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss) intriguing:<br /><br />It is an idea that has been successful in London, and is now being whispered in the ears of City Hall officials after months of behind-the-scenes work by the Partnership for New York City, the city's major business association: congestion pricing.<br /><br />The idea is to charge drivers for entering the most heavily trafficked parts of Manhattan at the busiest times of the day. By creating a financial incentive to carpool or use mass transit, congestion pricing could smooth the flow of traffic, reduce delays, improve air quality and raise the speed of crawling buses.<br /><br />To be sure, it is far from being a reality, or even a complete proposal - when pressed, the mayor's spokesman said it was not on his second-term agenda. Yet the Partnership's work suggests a plan that, if carried out, could profoundly alter the way New Yorkers and those visiting the city use their cars. &nbsp;<br /><br />[goto article for more]

				I also think delivery trucks should only be allowed to make their runs at night. Even Mexico City has this rule.

				someone has to be at the stores to receive them though? The CVS on 31st street gets all of their deliveries in the middle of the night as it is now, but I'm sure they have to have someone employed there to let the delivery guys in, right?

				I too am for banning all traffic from Manhattan. Create giant parking garages for the commuters OUTSIDE the city, and express subways that go into the city centers.<br /><br />Change all streets to one ways, single lane, then have one lane for delivery vehicles, give the rest to pedestrians (widen the sidewalks), and personal vehicles (bikes, electric scooters). If you need to drive, you pay some insane tax.<br /><br />Cars are not sustainable in their current form. It's time we as a society move beyond Henry Ford's vision and embrace a future that's not in the interest of big oil and Detroit.

				I do not think all cars should be banned from Manhattan. &nbsp;<br /><br />I agree that the current system is unsustainable, but there are a few things to consider. &nbsp;I have a friend who cannot go up and down stairs, so she cannot take the subway. &nbsp;The bus is similarly impractical (she can walk, so trying to convince the bus driver, even with ID, to activate the kneeler is almost impossible.) &nbsp;She lives in Manhattan. &nbsp;The only way she can commute or get around in general is to drive. &nbsp;(Disabled drivers are exempt from the congestion toll in London, btw.)<br /><br />I bought a washing machine from a guy who lived in Chelsea. &nbsp;The only way I could get it home was by car. &nbsp;(Timarimba, I hear you! &nbsp;I've shlepped drum kits to and from gigs on the subway - NOT fun.)<br /><br />Bloomberg proposed this four years ago as well, and it was shot down. &nbsp;I think one reason for that was his proposals were not sufficiently researched or based on needs of New Yorkers. &nbsp;There are valid reasons to have cars in Manhattan. &nbsp;There is also a very serious need to change the current system, but advocating a complete ban will not work, nor should it. &nbsp;I'm not offering a solution because I think the only tenable one will require a great deal of urban research and planning.

				While this idea sounds intriguing... I have to ponder what Lanseaux has brought up. From my personal point of view, I know that if I did not own a car for driving to Manhattan I would simply stop using services or goods from Manhattan. I've got a disabled family member and 2 small children. Imagine us trying to schlep on the subway to the city for a doctor's appointment? It would simply be too stressful for me and damn near impossible. Why should I be penalized for using the easiest and most economical mode of transport for me and my family? Perhaps if the transit system improves, we get elevators and handicapped access this can become a reality.... but it will be a LONG time and alot of money before that happens. Remember that the Underground in London is leaps and bounds ahead of what we've got here. That, my friends, is the sad reality of things.

				A ban on cars won't prohibit you from picking up a washing machine from Manhattan, you'll just have to pay a tax in order to drive your car into the city.<br /><br />Also, I'm fine with allowing disabled people to have an exemption from the tax. However, honestly I'd rather focus on making our public transportation systems more accessible, than put up with an unsustainable infrastructure (cars). We can put some money into making the city more accessible for those few people that are disabled.<br /><br />Cars aren't worth the trouble in Manhattan just so that we can make a trip into town a couple times a year to run an errand.

				We'll do away with all private vehicles. &nbsp;We'll put the garages on the other sides of the river. &nbsp;Only a limited fleet of yellow taxis will be allowed in Manhattan and only if they are electric or fuel cell technology. &nbsp;The busses will be replaced with trolley cars.<br /><br />A limited number of luxury licenses will be available for the fabulously wealthy who don't mind paying tens of thousands of dollars per year for the privilege of driving in the city. &nbsp;My transportation minister will crunch the numbers and advise me on how many we should allow and what the exact cost will be.<br /><br />Diplomats will not be allowed vehicles other than taxis. &nbsp;No accountability equals no privilege to drive and hence no special permits will be granted to them.
