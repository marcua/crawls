				As someone who was born and raised in Virginia, has a brother who goes to college in southern Virginia and who went to high school with people currently at Virginia Tech, this is particularly strange for me. <br /><br />I find it fascinating that there have been so many school shootings in the past ten years.&nbsp; It&#039;s as if Columbine started a trend.&nbsp; But I guess I&#039;m wondering: why now?&nbsp; Why has this trend developed?&nbsp;

				this is something i posted up on my blog:<br /><br />Virginia Tech <br /><br />after hearing about what happened at Virginia Tech, i became very sad. <br /><br />just as Columbine tragedy shocked myself and my classmates as it was just a year after i graduated from high school, this Virginia Tech tragedy saddened me as i attended, and graduated from a university 5 years ago. during my high school years and my college years, i never feared that anything like this would ever happen to myself or to anyone else, while attending classes.&nbsp; it&#039;s horrifying and shocking to hear about what happened today. <br /><br />i just watched the evening news... there were 2 young men who were talking on live television about being in the same classroom while the gunman shot their professor and classmates, and one of the young men was actually shot in the arm (he seems to be alright now).&nbsp; i just cant imagine what that is like. <br /><br />i feel sad for the students and everyone on campus, all of them. and i actually feel sad for the gunman. something was probably troubling him very much and...and i dont know. no one knows. <br /><br />so in an effort (a small and simple one) to prevent this from happening, i&#039;m reaching out to you all to pass on this information in whatever way you can to whomever will listen or actually needs it. or store it away and if you need it at another time, that&#039;s fine too. <br /><br />In NYC:<br />dial 311 and ask for Lifenet or call<br />1-800-543-3638<br />--serves all languages<br />1-877-AYUDESE (1-877-298-3373) for Spanish speaking callers<br />1-877-990-8585 in Mandarin, Cantonese, and Korean dialects<br />^^^^these operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.&nbsp; can call to talk and to receive information on places where one can receive mental health in your area (NYC area).<br /><br />Hopeline -- www.hopeline.com <br />1800SUICIDE / 1800 784 2433<br />connected to a crisis center near the caller&#039;s location, 24 hours a day<br /><br />Suicide Prevention Hotline<br />1800 273 Talk / 1800 273 8255

				What a horrible tragedy, I didn&#039;t expect that I would ever hear about another school shooting that would dwarf what happened in Columbine High School 8 years ago.&#160; There was a searious lapse of judgement after the first shooting at the dorm; the campus should have been notified immediately and locked down. The failure to be pro-active may have contributed to the later shootings over 2 hours later.&#160;

				Lockdown, from what they were talking about in the news, would have entailed shutting down all classes, essentially getting to all the buildings that had classes and keeping those students in the rooms, keeping the doors closed (locked) so no one could enter until the situation was resolved, somehow getting information to all students to stay in their respective dorms and to not leave. Cancelling the rest of classes (they hadn&#039;t done this). <br /><br />There was a lot of criticism about the campus security, but working at a university, I can see how this is incredibly challenging. I don&#039;t necessarily check in when I teach a class. Security would have had to identify all the classes that were in session across the campus and notify the classes of a lockdown. However, much of the security would probably have been focused in apprehending the first shooter. I think it is easy to criticize the way it was handled, but logistically, how could the information have been disseminated faster? There is no intercom, there are no departments necessarily congregating in the morning that could have then relayed the information to their students. Email must have been the most consistent methods. <br /><br />Maybe what could have been done would be a call to every R.A. on campus to notify all the students in the building that they needed to stay in their dorms, but what about the commuter students? I&quot;m sure there could have been a more effective way, but on the spot, this must have been challenging to troubleshoot.

				The gunman&#039;s been identified: http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/04/17/vtech.shooting/index.html.<br /><br />I remember that when I woke up around 7:30 yesterday morning, we put on the news on the radio and heard about the shooting deaths of 2 students. &nbsp;But, students at Virginia Tech didn&#039;t receive that news by email until 9am. &nbsp;There were clearly problems in disseminating information. &nbsp;Why did they wait so long to notify students that there was a gunman loose on campus?? &nbsp;Especially if campus security hadn&#039;t yet apprehended the gunman in the first incident.<br /><br />In my experience, students don&#039;t necessarily check their email in the morning, especially if they are on their way to class. &nbsp;The best way to notify students would have been to notify dorm and building personnel first and ask them to lock the doors and keep students inside. &nbsp;How difficult is it to lock a door? &nbsp;I mean, that&#039;s what the gunman himself did.

				Well, to be fair, the gunmen didn&#039;t simply lock the doors...he was prepared with chains and locks for some of the doors. I agree that the information was disseminated late, but it would have still been difficult to get everything out there. This isn&#039;t exactly the kind of protocal that campuses are usually ready to handle. Some of the students on the news even reported that if in the past there had been an increase in security this would have frustrated them, and although it would have helped in this situation, I also would be put off if on my campus the was an infiltration of police and security everywhere. <br /><br />I think the situation was poopie enough without running around blaming security that weren&#039;t prepared for a situation like this..the question more approrpriate is, what will be done in the future to avoid the situation, and what IS the best protocol for dissemination of information.

				Bomb threats are pretty commonplace, in my experience. We had several threats when I was in high school. They never came to anything. I don&#039;t really expect campus security to leap to action every time a few kids get drunk and stupid and find a payphone. <br /><br />I think it&#039;s hard to judge the situation without knowing more (did campus security have guns? what kind of training did they have? how many people were on duty and how quickly could backup be summoned? what&#039;s the &quot;best practice&quot; when a crazed gunman is methodically shooting up a school? do you try to take out the gunman at whatever cost or try to get him without getting students?) I doubt they had been trained for this situation or had any kind of plan for communicating information in any such event. Though I imagine they will have one by the end of this week. <br /><br />

				My first reaction was the &quot;Why the heck wasn&#039;t the place locked down?&quot; question as well.<br /><br />But then I started thinking about it. Can you imagine &quot;locking down&quot; a city of 25k residents? Because that&#039;s what such a &quot;lockdown&quot; would entail. That&#039;s no easy task, I imagine. I figure that while, in hindsight, such a lockdown would appear necessary, at the time they probably did the best they could with the information they had.

				There are photos on CNN of state police and SWAT team members with weapons drawn. &nbsp;The gunman shot himself when police reached the floor he was on. &nbsp;Several students interviewed said that when they saw police on campus, they initially thought it was because of a bomb threat. &nbsp;IMO, the real issue is still how the university dealt with the first shooting incident. &nbsp;Notifying students and locking down campus buildings then would have prevented more than 30 deaths.

				I&#039;m watching the Primetime special on this now, and they just said that *most* of the guns used in crimes in New York City are purchased in VA.<br />&nbsp;Also the same store that sold the gun to the Virginia Tech shooter, sold guns used in 4 prior murders.

				That&#039;s got to be one thing I do like about Bloomberg, his gun control advocacy.&nbsp; The majority of guns used in nyc are obtained out of state.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think this trajedy has something to do with gun control.&nbsp; This guy was nuts.&nbsp; But that doesn&#039;t mean that just anybody should be able to walk in and buy guns with no sort of background check.&nbsp; Guns kill.&nbsp; That&#039;s their function.&nbsp; Yes, it&#039;s the person who pulls the trigger, but they wouldn&#039;t pull it if it wasn&#039;t there to pull.&nbsp; And why anyone would have them around the house with curious children and their friends that come over to play with them, is beyond me.

				Interesting you use the phrase &quot;disowned them.&quot;&#160; I was listening to All Things Considered on NPR this afternoon, and asside from this strange nationalistic concern by the Koreans that one of their countrymen is responsible for all this death and destruction in another land, the other idea expressed from there is that the two parents are thought to have distanced themselves from the old country.&#160; This young man may not have had strong cultural ties to the nation and ethnicity he left at age five, but he also had trouble dealing with what he encountered in suburban Virginia (1 hour outside D.C.).
