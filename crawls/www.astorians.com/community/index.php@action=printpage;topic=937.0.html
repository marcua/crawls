				You're cordially invited to attend a special presentation entitled:<br /><br />DESTRUCTION OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER:<br />A CHRISTIAN THEOLOGIAN SPEAKS OUT<br /><br />Sunday, Oct. 16th<br />St. Marks Church<br />2nd Avenue &amp; 10th Street<br />New York City<br />6:30 PM, doors open 6:00<br />Suggested Donation: $5<br /><br />Sponsored by NY 911 Truth, WBAI, &amp; the Muslim-Christian-Jewish Alliance<br /><br />Is it possible that the official story of what happened on 9/11 is an implausible theory unsubstantiated by the facts? Since the government's theory has been proven flawed and their investigation is widely<br />recognized as being misleading and inadequate, shouldn't we objectively analyze and question it?<br /><br />Christian theologian and author David Ray Griffin will present compelling<br />evidence that challenges much of what we have been told about the<br />horrific attacks of that day. Dr. Griffin will include new research especially for the New York audience based on recently released oral histories of firefighters and medical workers at the World Trade Center as well as<br />video footage which clearly supports this research.<br /><br />Why should you attend? Because Dr. Griffin's presentation comes in the<br />wake of more issues in the news that continue to put the official account of 9/11 into question. In late August a surveillance program called Able Danger was revealed giving us information stating that four of the<br />alleged hijackers were being tracked as early as 1999. A few weeks ago we saw the forced resignation of NY Fire Department Chaplain Intikab Habib for questioning the government's explanation of 9/11. This occurred even though a Zogby poll released on Aug. 30, 2004 indicated that half the citizens of New York don't believe the official story.<br /><br />This event will bring a new level of clarity to the reality behind 9/11<br />as well as urgency for Americans to call for justice and accountability from<br />their government.<br /><br />David Ray Griffin is the author of &nbsp;&quot;The New Pearl Harbor: Disturbing<br />Questions About the Bush Administration and 9/11&quot; and &quot;The 9/11<br />Commission Report: Omissions &amp; Distortions&quot;. Dr. Griffin is Professor of Religion and Theology at the Claremont School of Theology where he taught for over 30 years, retiring in 2004. He has authored or edited over two dozen books including &quot;Deep Religious Pluralism&quot; and &quot;Two Great Truths: A New Synthesis of Scientific Naturalism and Christian Faith.&quot; Dr. Griffin is one of 60 people listed in a global list of leading Christian theologians.<br /><br />See &lt;http://www.NY911Truth.org&gt;www.NY911Truth.org or call 212-714-7147 for background on our organization.
