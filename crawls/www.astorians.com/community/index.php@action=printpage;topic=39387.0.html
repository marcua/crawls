				I saw they put up the sign for Flattops on Ditmars.&nbsp; This used to be the Sushi place.&nbsp; I think this is supposed to be the place with burgers and pinball machines.&nbsp; I have a feeling this will be a fun place.&nbsp; I wonder when it will be open.

				didn&#039;t notice on Wednesday if they opened at 5 or not. But they sure weren&#039;t open yesterday at 5 and looked even less &quot;open&quot; on the inside than they have recently.

				I was really looking forward to this place opening, but when I hear things like they don&#039;t open at the time posted on the door it makes me wonder how serious they are about running their business.&nbsp; I&#039;m still waiting for them to have lunch hours.&nbsp; Maybe that will never happen.
