			hi all, I was wondering whether there was a nice quiet place in the neighborhood that does D&amp;D, like a comic shop or something to that effect.

			I know of at least one comic book store, but it doesn&#039;t look big enough to host games.<br /><br /><br />If you&#039;re looking to play, I might be interested in a neighborhood game.&nbsp; When we can get everyone together, I&#039;ve been playing with friends via Google Hangouts.&nbsp; It&#039;s good, but I do miss the same-table interaction.

			I think that&#039;s a great idea. I work a pretty conventional 9-6 Monday-Friday, but have not real recurring obligations outside of that. I would love to get something set up -- I&#039;ve been trying to get my wife to give it a go for a while now!

			I saw this and thought you might be interested.&nbsp; The new bookstore in Astoria, Enigma, plans to host regular gaming sessions.&nbsp; While I like gaming at home just fine, I could do with a change of scenery now and then.<br /><br /><br />http://weheartastoria.com/2013/07/we-heart-astoria-gets-to-know-enigma-bookstore/<br /><br /><br />P.S., I&#039;m still interested in finding other players in the neighborhood.
