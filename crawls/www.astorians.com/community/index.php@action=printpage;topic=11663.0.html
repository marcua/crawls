				I know this is on very short notice, but if anyone is free to do so, go see <em>Stealing America: Vote by Vote </em> at the Quad Cinema.&nbsp; It&#039;s running through Thursday.&nbsp; If it does well in this initial tryout run in selected cities, then national distribution will be much more likely.<br /><br />You can probably guess what it&#039;s about; this is the issue without which all other political issues are just noise.

				Here&#039;s the link to the site and the trailer.<br /><br />http://www.stealingamericathemovie.org/ (http://www.stealingamericathemovie.org/)<br /><br />The exit polls at closing time in Ohio during the 2004 presidential election had Kerry winning 51% to Bush 48%. Strangely enough the percentage flipped immediately after. Exit poll discrepancy are almost never more than 1%, and yet they flipped drastically after voting ended. Astoundingly this happened mainly in Democratic majority districts. Election fraud by tampered Diebold voting machine was suspected. Various independent audits made afterwards concluded that the odds of such a dramatic about face for Republican presidential candidate by those having cast their votes for Democratic local positions are almost astronomical. All investigations conclude that there was voting machine software manipulation. Alot of Republicans leaders have been advocating against voter fraud, and are pushing for voter ID requirements at the polls, which would greatly disenfranchise minorities and senior citizens. Many people who fall into these categories are living on a limited income and do not have the accepted photo ID, such as a drivers license, a state issued ID, or a passport, and are unlikely to go through the expense and the sometimes difficult process of obtaining one. In reality, true instances of voter fraud are scarce. The truth is <span class="bbc_u">election fraud</span> is what we as citizens have to be seriously alarmed about.

				I recall reading that NYT article. Democrats have also been involved in voter fraud and even election fraud, it&#039;s not necessarily an political affiliated crime. I just want to point out that voter fraud is a drop in the bucket in comparison to the hundreds of thousands and sometimes millions of voters effected by Election Fraud. As many as 3 million voters are estimated to have been disenfranchized in the 2004 presidential election. Pales in comparison to voter fraud, doesn&#039;t it? <br /><br />I saw the film Stealing America today, it reconfirmed to me how much all the shenanigans regarding election fraud have been on the rise. The discrepancies between the exit polls have increased along with technology improvements in the voting machines. It&#039;s alot easier to succeed in election fraud when there is no paper trail. Without protection of the first amendment, the rest of the constitution basically means nothing, because the citizens of the USA are no longer choosing their leaders.

				FZ, since you automatically denigrate the film as a &quot;schlockumentary&quot; instead of a documentary, even though you haven&#039;t seen it, and don&#039;t know anything about it, you obviously have no intention as discussing the film or the topic of election fraud seriously. The film did in fact discuss the military, and showed several lists that were obtained of &quot;african american only&quot; military who we purged from system even though they were legal registered voters. As for illegals aliens voting, that&#039;s less likely to happen than even legalized residents, who can&#039;t vote either. Voter fraud is not a rampant problem, but election fraud is. <br /><br />Exit polls were accurate for over 40 years, and used as a gage used to keep check on whether something fishy was going on with the actual election results. The fact that there has been a soaring discrepancy between exit polls and official voting count since 1996 should have everyone concerned, including FZ. Remember, the ends do not justify the means when it comes to voting in a democracy.

Now, that we got that out of the way, let&#039;s&nbsp; look at voter fraud&nbsp; vs. election fraud. :-)<br /><br />You assume I don&#039;t know anything about it. I have spent 12 years working elections, city, state and federal.&nbsp; I read reviews&nbsp; about this so-called documentary, who praised it, looked&nbsp; at the &#039;interview&#039; list and it was the usual suspects that call anything won by Republicans or Non-Leftists fraud, stealing. <br /><br />It is telling that&nbsp; they include the usual charge of &#039;racism&#039;, instead of focusing on some&nbsp; malarkey about some &#039;African American&#039; list, what they didn&#039;t ask for a list of &#039;spanish-sounding&#039; names?&nbsp; :wink: Thanks for&nbsp; confirming who and what is&nbsp; behind&nbsp; this nonsense. Felons&nbsp; voting was looked&nbsp; into in Florida, and only&nbsp; 8, count them, 8 were found to be registered&nbsp; &#039;legit&#039; voters. Some happened&nbsp; to be&nbsp; African American and had served&nbsp; in the Military,but, were felons. The NYT, no &#039;right-wing&#039;&nbsp; arm of the dreaded&nbsp; FOX News, looked at extensive studies&nbsp; of both Govt and civilian agencies and found even with over votes and mistakes the outcome would be the same. <br /><br />I wonder, did they include, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel which initiated an investigation of the 2004 presidential election in Wisconsin, which had one of the closest results, with Kerry winning the state by only 11,000 votes. The newspaper investigation resulted in a probe by U.S. Attorney Steve Biskupic and Milwaukee County District Attorney E. Michael McCann that found clear evidence of fraud in the election, including more than 200 felons who voted illegally and another 100-plus people who voted under bad addresses or false names or who voted twice. You know the rampant voter fraud&nbsp; that doesn&#039;t exist? One of the most comprehensive studies of the 2000 presidential election, &#039;Democracy Held Hostage,&#039; was conducted by the Miami Herald ,it found that 400 votes were cast illegally in heavily Democratic Broward County when poll workers allowed voters to vote who were not on the precinct voting rolls. And another 452 were cast illegally by felons in Broward. In Volusia County -- which supported Gore -- 277 voters voted who were not registered, including 73 voters at predominately black Bethune-Cookman University, which voted heavily for Gore. Not to mention the tactics of ACORN, who when questioned about voter fraud in minority communities&nbsp; just shout &#039;racism&#039; knowing that the &#039;unbiased&#039; press&nbsp; will join in so no inquiry can be made to&nbsp; investigate the&nbsp; rampant voter&nbsp; fraud in large cities by democrat&nbsp; machine&nbsp; organizations.<br /><br />The Herald review of votes in 22 counties (with 2.3 million ballots) found that 1,241 ballots were cast illegally by felons who had not received clemency. Of these voters, 75% were registered Democrats. And the Herald study counted only those who had been sentenced to prison for more than a year.<br /><br />One of the most recent well-publicized voter fraud cases occurred in the Washington State governor’s race in November 2004 in which Democrat Christine Gregoire allegedly defeated Republican Dino Rossi by 129 votes after weeks of vote counting. The Washington State Superior Court found that 1,400 felons voted illegally, along with illegal votes cast by 53 dead people, two non-citizens and 27 double votes. Since Washington State does not have party voter registration, there was no way of proving exactly how they voted, so the judge ruled there was not enough proof to void the election.<br /><br /><br />There&nbsp; were extensive studies&nbsp; done by news media and govt. and besides human error that has happened&nbsp; for all time, there was no more extensive&nbsp; irregularties&nbsp; than any other election, the main cases&nbsp; of fraud&nbsp; were on the registration and permitting of&nbsp; Illegals&nbsp; and voters who were nonexistent and the majority of those&nbsp; were done in cities run by democrats, where they would drive busloads&nbsp; to polls with no ID, or as in the case of Former Gov. Spitzer, giving illegals&nbsp; license&nbsp; ID&#039;s, all in the name of being &#039;fair.&#039; <br /><br />Yeah, I&#039;m concerned&nbsp; at the way people like me are knocked&nbsp; about the head&nbsp; and ripped&nbsp; off, by so-called&nbsp; documentaries and folks who aren;t&nbsp; concerned&nbsp; with any &#039;election fraud&#039;, but, hiding the extensive&nbsp; voter&nbsp; fraud&nbsp; behind&nbsp; charges of &#039;racism&#039; and &#039;disenfranchisement&#039; every time someone tries&nbsp; to investigate it. What happened&nbsp; in 2006? Well, Democrats &#039;won&#039;, no fraud there, right?&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br />Oh Yeah, Exist Polls&nbsp; are always&nbsp; spot on, especially&nbsp; in close elections for President. :wink:<br /><br />(http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x96/FZ81/image.jpg)<br /><br /><br /><br />

				FZ, since you worked in elections, you know the difference between polling people before an election and polling people after they voted (exit polling). The Truman/Dewey headline relied on the former, as there was no nationwide exit polling being done back in 1948. The Obama and McCain polls will continue to fluctuate until Election Day. Exit polls were always spot on with almost no exceptions, until recently. As for voter fraud, I recall having read about the examples you gave, and I agree they should have been prosecuted. <br /><br />Again, the big problem isn&#039;t voter fraud, it&#039;s election fraud. Why are there almost no indictments let alone convictions on election fraud? Because it&#039;s being done by insiders who leave no clues as to what they have done in the computers. Scripted codes can disappear after they are run, leaving no trace, let alone a paper trail. In Ohio in 2004, because of overwhelming evidence of election fraud, a judge gave a court order to have all the voting results saved and sealed for a possible recount, and yet 70% of them were lost or destroyed. Oops, no way to have a recount now is there? A former Diebold programmer was approached by a Republican official and requested tyo write a code that would flip votes after the polls closed. He reported the information to the FBI and the DOJ. It didn&#039;t matter, since they obviously got other programmers to do the job anyway. The voting servers went down and were blacked out just as the polls closed on Ohio with Kerry leading 51% to Bush 48%. A few hours later when the servers were back up, the percentages flipped. Cute, huh?<br /><br />

				No Paper Trail Left Behind: The Theft of the 2004 Presidential Election<br /><br />http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Project%20Censored/Theft_2004_Pres_Election.html (http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Project%20Censored/Theft_2004_Pres_Election.html)<br /><br />13. There was no fraud in Cuyahoga County, Ohio where the number of recorded votes was more than 93,000 larger than the number of registered voters and where they admitted counting the votes in secret before bringing them out in public to count.<br /><br />14. CNN reported at 9 p.m. EST on election evening that Kerry was leading by 3 points in the national exit polls based on well over 13,000 respondents. Several hours later at 1:36 a.m. CNN reported that the exit polls, now based on a few hundred more-13,531 respondents were showing Bush leading by 2 points, a 5-point swing. In other words, a swing of 5 percentage points from a tiny increase in the number of respondents somehow occurred despite it being mathematically impossible.&quot;<br />

				Black Box Voting is a nonpartisan, non-profit oprganization funded by citizens. Their objective is to protect and defend citizens against deceptive election fraud practices such as voting machines which don&#039;t have independent audits and do not have paper trails. There&#039;s a whole list of investigative articles going back 4 years, alot of them have to do with the Diebold voting machines.<br /><br />http://www.bbvforums.org/forums/messages/1954/1954.html (http://www.bbvforums.org/forums/messages/1954/1954.html)

				Don&#039;t believe the voter fraud claims just yet.<br /><br />http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/13/election-acorn-voter-fraud (http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/13/election-acorn-voter-fraud)<br /><br />The Republican voter fraud hoaxDonald Duck and the Dallas Cowboys won&#039;t steal the election for Obama.

Despite the screaming wall-to-wall coverage of &quot;Democratic voter fraud in 11 swing states&quot; as seen on Fox News and even the once-respectable CNN, none of it&#039;s true. None of it.<br /><br />In just the last week, we&#039;ve had a phoney stunt raid in swing state Nevada (where Acorn had been cooperating with officials for months, concerning problem canvassers they&#039;d long ago fired); a Republican election official in swing state Missouri tell Fox News that she&#039;s being beseiged with fraudulent registration forms from Acorn (in a county where they&#039;ve not done any registration work since August); a Republican sheriff in swing state Ohio, who, the very next day, suddenly requested the names and addresses of hundreds of early voters (with evidence of exactly zero wrong doing, but lots of Democratic-leaning college student in the particular county, and John McCain&#039;s state campaign chair as a partner in the investigation); and a screaming front page headline in Rupert Murdoch&#039;s New York Post about a guy who claims he was somehow tricked by Acorn into registering 72 times (but read the article closely to note he says he registered at the same address each time, which, even if true, would allow him - you guessed it - precisely one legal vote.)<br /><br />It&#039;s an old Republican scam, but it&#039;s never been carried out with more zeal than this year.
