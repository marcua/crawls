				Hi! I&#039;m moving to the Astoria area and I have a child entering kindergarten this fall. <br /><br /><br />Could any parents share any insights into the G&amp;T programs at PS 122, PS 150, PS 166 and PS 85? (I know the district program at 85 is a new one.)<br /><br /><br />I&#039;d love to hear thoughts about the quality of teaching, whether the kids are happy and engaged, whether the schools put too much pressure on the kids or pile on too much homework, and any thoughts about how the schools compare to each other.<br /><br /><br />Also, if anyone has any opinions on the likelihood of admission in kindergarten with a 98 on the G&amp;T test, I&#039;d be grateful! I&#039;ve heard rumors that it&#039;s impossible to get into 122 with less than a 99.<br /><br /><br />Thank you!

				Welcome!<br /><br /><br />All the programs are very similar.&nbsp; My daughter is at 150 and is very happy.&nbsp; The program at 150 moves the kids ahead by a full grade in math, offers them chess in the second grade, and has a full complement of art, music and drama.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I encourage you to tour all the schools and see which seems to be the best fit for you and your family.<br /><br />

				The city wide G&amp;T will start at PS17-Henry David Thoreau School, starting in Sept. the G &amp; T kindergarten class at 85 now is the last one. I think 17 will be accepting 2 classes for kindergarten. Definitely go on the tours you will get a better feel for the schools.

				I heard a rumor that the departing citywide G&amp;T at 85 was being replaced by a district program, but no confirmation - is that a done deal now?

				Litza - yes, the citywide program is definitely moving out of P.S. 85.<br />&nbsp;<br />Another option for parents looking for an extra challenge to consider is dual language programs.&nbsp; The one at 150 offers incredible enrichment - incorporating dance and music into the curriculum.

				Yes, I knew about 85&#039;s STEM program moving to PS17, but the OP said &quot;the district program at 85 is a new one&quot; and I&#039;d also heard rumors that the extra space left by the vacating program would be replaced by a district-level G&amp;T program (like 122&#039;s). Just wondering whether there was any more information about that!

				For those interested, P.S. 150 has posted some additional information about their G&amp;T program online:<br />&nbsp;<br />http://ps150qpta.com/2014/04/08/the-gifted-talented-presentation/ (http://ps150qpta.com/2014/04/08/the-gifted-talented-presentation/)<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

				Sure enough, District 30 announced several new G&amp;T classrooms today (depending on demand):<br /><br /><br /><br />Q166 – Two kindergarten and two 1st grade classes (4 sections total)<br />Q150 – One kindergarten and one 1st grade class (2 sections total)<br />Q122 - One kindergarten and one 1st grade class (2 sections total)<br />Q085 – One kindergarten class (Districtwide, not STEM, 1 section total)
