A century later, it strikes a wonderful balance by remaining both a respected and studied piece of literature, as well as a favorite with audiences.<br /><br />&quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; is a play built upon a pun over the name &quot;Ernest.&quot; John Worthing is &quot;Jack&quot; in the country and &quot;Ernest&quot; in the city. He has met his true love, Gwendolyn, in the city, which he thinks will work out very well for she will only marry a man named Ernest. But what happens when Gwendolyn unexpectedly visits him in the country and finds out who he really is? As Oscar Wilde wrote, &quot;The truth is rarely pure and never simple.&quot;<br /><br /><br />The EARNEST Artistic Team<br /><br />Arnie Kolodner, Guest Artist: Arnie Kolodner is an actor and magician who has performed professionally in New York since 1983 after earning his BFA in Drama from NYU and studying at the London Academy of Music &amp; Dramatic Art. Over two decades Arnie has established his own international children’s theater company presenting interactive performances that seamlessly weaves amazing magic illusions into classic tales.&nbsp; Arnie was an original company member in Charles Busch&#039;s Theater in Limo having debuted at the Limbo Lounge in VAMPIRE LESBIANS OF SODOM in 1984. He quickly became Mr. Busch&#039;s leading man in such classics as THEODORA, SHE-BITCH OF BYZANTHIUM and KISS THE BLOOD OFF MY CASTINETTES OR PARDON MY INQUISITION. Arnie transferred with the Off Broadway production of VAMPIRE LESBIANS… and it soon became the longest running Off Broadway Comedy. For years he lead a double life performing magic at high society birthday parties during the day and becoming a Vampire Lesbian at night!&nbsp; Theater audiences will remember Arnie&#039;s &quot;Hollywood leading man&quot; turns in many of Busch&#039;s subsequent Off-Broadway shows, most notably PSYCHO BEACH PARTY at The Players Theater (the Off Broadway transfer of GIGET GOES PSYCHOTIC at the Limbo Lounge), THE LADY IN QUESTION at the Orpheum Theater, RED SCARE ON SUNSET at the Lucille Lortell and TIMES SQUARE ANGEL at the Provincetown Playhouse. Kolodner and Busch also performed the first ever Drag Illusion act on Broadway at Night of 1000 Gypsies at the St. James Theater. They comically (but faithfully) recreated Harry and Bess Houdini&#039;s legendary escape illusion &quot;Metamorphosis”. Currently, Arnie is featured in the documentary film “The Lady in Question is Charles Busch.” www.arnieparty.com <br /><br />Ken Neil Hailey, Director/Designer: Ken Hailey, Director – Ken began his “directing direction” working as an directing intern at Kansas City’s Midland Theatre on the “pre-Broadway” run of James Kirkwood’s LEGENDS with Carol Channing and Mary Martin.

He has directed regional productions of THE MYSTERY OF EDIWN DROOD, FIVE FINGER EXERCISE, VANITIES and a long-run Provincetown, MA production of VAMPIRE LESBIANS OF SODOM. He has worked with such artists as Dawn Wells, Woody Harrelson, Edward Gorey, Christina Aguilera (at age 7) and “artists” as Joe Namath and one of Norman Mailer’s ex-wives. He has performed in national companies of GODSPELL, THE BOYS NEXT DOOR and THE BEST LITTLE WHOREHOUSE IN TEXAS and in the mini-series THE BLUE AND THE GREY and has worked at with such regional companies as City Theatre (Pittsburgh), The MUNY (St. Louis), Okoboji Summer Theatre, Arkansas Rep, Arkansas Theatre Festival and Cape Cod’s AdHoc Stage and Cape Rep companies.

Canon Chasuble, D.D.<br />Mister Zachary Koval as Algernon Moncrieff<br /><br />Oscar Wilde (1854-1900) was a prolific writer, a brilliant satirist and a celebrated public figure. His collected works - which are filled to capacity with his trademark epigrams, paradoxes, and puns - represent some of the finest literature in the English language to have been written during the 19th century. He was the first and greatest proponent of the new philosophy of &quot;art for art&#039;s sake,&quot; and his life was a vivid testimony to his beliefs. He led the life of a &quot;bohemian,&quot; wearing his hair long and his velvet breeches to the knee. His rooms were filled with various objects &#039;d&#039;art, flowers, and other extravagances (he once claimed to aspire to the perfection of his china), and he loved nothing more than to tweak the noses of the cultured and complaisant. In 1895 (later in the same year of &quot;Earnest&#039;s&quot; premiere), Wilde became the center of one of the most sensational trials of the century. Convicted on moral grounds for sodomy, he was sentenced to two years of hard labor in prison. &quot;Earnest&quot; ran for another month with Wilde&#039;s name removed from the playbills and programs. Having served his time, he emerged financially bankrupt and spiritually downcast. He spent the rest of his short life in Paris, where he was received into the Roman Catholic Church shortly before he died of meningitis at the age of 46. Some of his better known works include: &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; (1891), &quot;Lady Windermere&#039;s Fan&quot; (1892), &quot;A Woman of No Importance&quot; (1893), &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; (1895), &quot;The Ballad of Reading Gaol&quot; (1898), and the posthumously published &quot;De Profundis&quot; (1905).<br /><br />
