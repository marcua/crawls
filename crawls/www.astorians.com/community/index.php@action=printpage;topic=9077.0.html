				Hey there,<br /><br />I am not a CSA member but would like to be. How does seasonal membership work and at this point what&#039;s the likelihood of us getting in? It seems like everyone has a wait list! <br /><br />Does anyone know anything about the South Bronx Coop or CSA?<br /><br />Aside from it seeming like there&#039;s no room for new members, I am also concerned because I don&#039;t want a Saturday pick-up as we are trying to be in some way Shabbat observant. I am a vegetarian and my fiance is kosher so also we would want to sign up for any dairy packages but not meat. Do you know if this is an option?<br /><br />Any thoughts or advice are most welcome.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />sbkastoria

				sbk- I did a small search and found this link&nbsp; http://www.hazon.org/go.php?q=/readingroom/00-hazonInTheNews/20040528-TheJewishWeek_-_TheGreeningOfAnscheChesed.html (http://www.hazon.org/go.php?q=/readingroom/00-hazonInTheNews/20040528-TheJewishWeek_-_TheGreeningOfAnscheChesed.html)&nbsp; it seems to be on the UWS. If you don&#039;t mind the trip it might be worth it.<br />

				Thanks! I guess it make sense that membership is seasonal and that we can&#039;t just sign on when we want. I wrote Hazon about it. They are a good group.

				Hey sbkastoria - <br /><br />If it doesn&#039;t sell out after the initial registration day, the Astoria CSA would probably be a good one for you.&nbsp; One share is enough to feed 4 people and then some.&nbsp; You can also up your membership to add a fruit share (one price to get fruit for all the weeks of the share) and then you can, on a order by order basis, order dairy or meat from I think the Lewis Waite Farm . . . all organic.&nbsp; The website is ASTORIACSA.COM.<br /><br />You can also let them know if you only want a half share and I think the organizers will try to hook you up with another member.&nbsp; The pick ups this past year were on Thursdays and they were at Cafe Bar.&nbsp; Don&#039;t know where they will be this year.<br /><br />Oh ya . . . and you have to volunteer to work the co-op one day out of the season, which isn&#039;t bad - it lasts from May to November!<br /><br />Take Care.

				Astoria CSA will open for new members in March. We&#039;ll also hold an information session, hopefully by Mid-March, for new members and those looking to split shares. We have about 50 more shares open for next season (a handful are being set aside as low-income shares), so hopefully we&#039;ll be able to make more in the community happy. As said, our website is www.astoriacsa.com. Our pick up next year will be at ARROW Community Center in lower Astoria. Our vegetable providers are Golden Earthworm Farm in Long Island.<br /><br />In the area, there is also Hellgate CSA, which picks up near the Ditmars area. I think they are www.hellgatecsa.com. Hellgate receives vegetables from Green Thumb (I think in upstate NY?).<br /><br />Both offer pick ups on Thursdays. Astoria CSA&#039;s season is a little longer and the shares are twice as large (which means twice as expensive). Both offer CSA Pastures, which links with Lewis Waite Farm and other farms upstate. CSA Pastures offers organic bread, jams, honey, cheese and grass-fed/ pastured meats (chicken, beef, pork, lamb and goat). Both offer additional fruit shares (for a price) and Astoria CSA will be expanding some of their other add-ons next season (we&#039;re hoping to partner w/ Bierkraft in Brooklyn for local beer and cheese as well as Hot Bread Kitchen for some &quot;ethnic&quot; breads-- fresh hand-ground tortillas, lavash bread, baguettes and more.)
