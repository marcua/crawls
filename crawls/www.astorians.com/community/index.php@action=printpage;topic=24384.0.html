				Hi!<br /><br /><br />I got a pair of nubuck shoes for my birthday and I want to stain and waterproof them, professionally.&nbsp; A friend mentioned it will change the color, darken them a little, so I want to go to someone great who can estimate ahead of time how much the color will change (I may just opt to only wear them on really good weather days and stay away from everyone, but that would be a shame). <br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve got a couple shoe repair/cobblers I like in Manhattan near work, but I&#039;d rather get a guy in Astoria if I can match the quality... I&#039;m near Broadway &amp; Steinway.

				I&#039;ve had success with Jack&#039;s Shoe Repair on 25-40 Broadway. Really nice guy, been there forever.

				I also go to Jack and have for many years.<br /><br /><br />He&#039;s also a straight shooter. I recently went to him with a couple of pairs of older shoes and boots and asked<br />him if they were worth repairing. He was totally honest about being able to patch them up temporarily, but <br />explained how each one wouldn&#039;t really last and that I&#039;d be wasting my money. <br /><br /><br />I really appreciated his honesty - someone else would have just made the repair and been glad to take my money. <br /><br /><br />He does really good work at fair prices. I wouldn&#039;t go anywhere else!<br /><br />

				Apologies for hijacking this thread but was wondering if anyone had the same recommendations for the Ditmars area?<br />&nbsp;<br />I have a couple of pairs of shoes that need new soles and the only place I know about is by the train but I don&#039;t know how their service is.<br />&nbsp;<br />Thanks.

				The guy on 28th Street &amp; 23rd Ave does good work, and is pretty inexpensive.&nbsp; Check him out on Yelp.

				I echo blue34. I brought him several pairs of leather and suede boots with worn out heels, and he fixed them right up. Even cleaned parts I thought were stained for good. Very nice, and reasonable prices.

				Around Ditmars, we used to go to the guy under the train (near Frankie&#039;s), and he was always good. Because of shifting routines and walking patterns, more recently, we&#039;ve been going to the guy on Ditmars just past Steinway, more or less next to Envee Hair Salon. He&#039;s done a great job on numerous pairs of shoes, and he&#039;ll make a small repair on the spot. He once replaced the heels of a pair of boots while I waited.
