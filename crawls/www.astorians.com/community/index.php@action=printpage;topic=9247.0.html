				Hello!<br /><br />My elderly neighbor has moved away and his property here in Astoria has been sold. Over the last 40 years, my neighbor had planted and nurtured four trees that will be discarded in the demolition of his property unless I find them a new home. <br /><br />There are two peach trees, one magnolia and some type of evergreen tree. I will post photos later today. I want to see these trees find new homes; I do not have room in my yard to plant them. <br /><br />Any takers? I don&#039;t have a car, but I will gladly help anyone willing to give them a good home to get them out of the ground.<br /><br />Michelle in Astoria near Broadway @ Steinway<br />mronda@rcn.com

				Are the peach trees fruitbearing? Edible fruit I mean. We have a peach tree in our backyard, but it is old (over 40yrs) and wasnt taken care of much before we moved in almost 4 yrs ago. So we are looking to possibly replace it.<br /><br />

				Yes definitely fruit bearing! I had some as recently as this past summer and they were good. One tree had grown so heavy with fruit last summer that my neighbor had to trim it, so some of the branches were cut back making it easier to transport.<br /><br />The trees have been in his family for 60 years and he was a fastidious gardener. The last few years were hard on his gardening as he reached his 90th birthday but he hired people to tend the trees the past few years.

				First of all, very cool on the conservation of the trees!&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen: :mrgreen:<br /><br />Second, I am very interested!&nbsp; Though I&#039;d love the magnolia tree, I&#039;d imagine I do not have the room for it, so I&#039;d be interested in a peach tree if still available.&nbsp; If you have pics that would be really helpful or I&#039;d be willing to swing by to gander at the trees.<br /><br />

				Yes, sorry I haven&#039;t responded earlier, but a pic or two would be great. Also wondering what the height is of the peach tree(s)? Or I could also swing by to take a look and see if they will suit our backyard(size wise).

				I realized too late that current photos do no justice to the beauty of these trees but I am going to take some anyway and will send ASAP. Meantime, the trees are in the yard at 32-20 42nd Street and you are welcomed to pass by anytime and take a look from the street but if you want a close up, I am happy to take you into the yard to see them. I will be around over the weekend and will PM you my phone number.

				I am going to respond for mronda since I am not sure how actively she has been checking these posts.&nbsp; Michelle is my oldest and dearest friend, thus, I am intimately familiar with the situation.&nbsp; Yes the trees are still there although the builder seems be there often and I am not sure if he has set a date for the demolition.&nbsp; Just to be clear, the trees have all been in the ground for many years and I don&#039;t know how difficult it will be to uproot them and transport.<br /><br />Frappe, the magnolia tree is actually not that big.&nbsp; You should check it out.&nbsp; If you ever want to pass by to check it out, it is the very first tree in the side yard closest to the chain link fence. <br /><br />Nosillak I will let Michelle know you are interested in the peach tree.

				Interested tree friends,<br /><br />I have found homes for the magnolia and peach trees. A woman who traps, neuters and returns feral cats did just that for the cats that were living in this same neighbor&#039;s yard. She does all of this for free and although we gave her a donation to cover food and transportation costs, I was happy that she wanted the magnolia as another way to thank her. By the way if you want her contact information for any local feral cats who are generating more feral cats she is great and I can give you her contact info.<br /><br />Socrates Sculpture Garden will very likely be new home to the peach trees. This pleases me to no end as that way plenty of people can enjoy a fresh peach this summer.<br /><br />None of this has happened yet as spring has barely sprung; should take place within the next 2 - 3 weeks. If any of the plans fall through I will be sure to let those interested in the trees know. And thanks for considering tree re-homing.<br /><br />AJT is right - the trees have been in the ground for many decades. I think it will be no small feat to see them survive transplant but Socrates is working with professionals in this regard, so fingers crossed.
