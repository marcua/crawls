				Does anyone here employ the use of a digital phone?&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking of signing up with Vonage but I&#039;m wondering if having a digital phone slows down internet surfing speed?&nbsp; I can&#039;t seem to find a straight answer online.&nbsp; <br /><br />To that effect, does anyone use Vonage and have good or bad things to say about it?&nbsp;

				I have a friend who has been using one for a couple of years now and has been very satisfied with the connections and service.&nbsp; I think she uses Vonage but I&#039;m not sure.<br /><br />I actually want one, but I am not willing to give up my land line.&nbsp; In cases of severe emergency or a blackout (or whenever your cable goes out), a digital cable-based (VOIP) phone will not work.&nbsp; There&#039;s cell phone backup, of course, but on days like September 11 (don&#039;t know if cable was out that day because we didn&#039;t have it), the cell phone circuits were jammed, as they were on the day of the larger blackout in 2003.&nbsp; Land line circuits were also overloaded on September 11, but they cleared more quickly.&nbsp; In 2006, the Astoria blackout was so long that people&#039;s cell phones were dying.&nbsp; I brought my chargers into work, but it was still a hassle.&nbsp; Then, my cable/modem went out for a week sometime in the past six months or so.<br /><br />Does it happen often?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; But it does happen often enough, and in situations where I specifically want to know that I have a way of getting in touch with people.

				I know a bunch of people that have it. You won&#039;t notice the phone slowing down your internet, BUT if you do a lot of downloading or file-sharing that might affect the call quality.

				I don&#039;t do a lot of downloading or file-sharing.&nbsp; (The feds made that unfun.)&nbsp; I signed up with Vonage so hopefully it will be good.&nbsp; There&#039;s a 60 day trial dealie so if it ruins my life, I can disconnect it with no financial loss.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I have had vonage for a few years now, and overall I am happy.&nbsp; It&#039;s cheap, it does not affect internet speed, and it&#039;s cool to get your voicemail emailed to you.<br /><br />lately, there has been some spotty service and with Vonage&#039;s financial ackwardness and legal issues, I don;t know that it will be around much longer (probably be bought out).&nbsp; I think TimeWarner (if that is who you use for internet service) also has a VoIP service that might be better (but more expensive).

I &#039;ve managed to do it on a 5mbit and 7mbit connection. Granted it requires a few simultaneous Bittorrent downloads from <strong>a lot</strong> of peers, but it is feasable. I would say for the average person this isn&#039;t an issue, though.

				When I used to do a lot of downloading, i.e. 20 or more at once it never affected my call quality on&nbsp; Vonage. It also has to do with bandwidth. If it affects a 7mbps line, then you&#039;ve got a problem somewhere on that line which isn&#039;t related to the&nbsp; voip, but probably to the computer and/or modem.&nbsp; But granted , the average user shouldn&#039;t be worried about either one affecting the other.

				I&#039;ve used a lot of different VOIP providers through the years. Vonage, Lingo, SunRocket, voip.com. But I recently started using ViaTalk (http://affiliatecenter.viatalk.com/idevaffiliate.php?id=5199) and I&#039;m very happy with them. The call quality is just as good as Vonage, and they have a pretty good promotion going right now (2 years for $199, or you can pay by the month). They also give you a 2nd phone line free. I switched to them recently after SunRocket went out of business.<br /><br />ViaTalk (http://affiliatecenter.viatalk.com/idevaffiliate.php?id=5199)
