				I think this service is a great idea, but although the website says it&#039;s free to join, it doesn&#039;t say what other fees are associated with using the service.

				Its a brand new website so there is no income at this time. However, hopefully in the future advertisers may want to show their ads on the website. Which intern can help produce revenue. Hope you sign-up. Thanks

				If it&#039;s free, why is there a refund policy? Is there payment required for membership? Confused.<br />https://chooseafamily.com/refund_policy.php<br /><br /><br />&quot;Our site operates a no-refund policy. However, membership can be cancelled at anytime. If you feel that our services have been defective in any way, please contact us at customerservice@Chooseafamily.com with your user registration details and your complaint, and we will take any and all steps to ensure your satisfaction.&quot;

				The ultimate goal for the website is to help those in need. There are many who are blessed with a wonderful family and then there are those who are less fortunate... perhaps they have no one. Chooseafamily helps people find family element that is missing in their lives. Everyone deserves a chance at having a family experience...best wishes
