				I&#039;m not sure if this is the right place to post, but I&#039;m sure the Mods will fix it if I&#039;m wrong.&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />My boyfriend brought his cat down to NYC to live with us in September when we finally moved into our own apartment sans roommates. The kitty is doing well, but he&#039;s been incredibly hyper and seems to be missing his old kitty friends.<br /><br />So we&#039;ve been thinking about getting another cat. I&#039;ve browsed craigslist, but I feel like I would rather go to an actual, reputable shelter or meet one via Astorians.com. <br /><br />I know everyone here is super-knowledgeable about all kinds of things so I thought I would check in here.<br /><br />1) Where are the reputable shelters in Astoria that would let me meet a few cats and see if any felt like a fit?<br /><br />2) Our cat is a 4 year old male. He&#039;s a bit territorial, but has gotten along wonderfully with males younger than him. He likes to be the boss and can be a bit aggressive at first, but softens up very quickly to other cats. Any advice on how to best find a match for him? Previously, it&#039;s been the dumb-luck-with-roommates&#039;-animals kind of thing.<br /><br />3) Any other suggestions from people who&#039;ve done this before?<br /><br />Thanks guys!

				When I adopted my second cat, I went to Animal Care and Control: http://www.nycacc.org (http://www.nycacc.org).&nbsp; This is the municipal shelter, which is required to take in every animal that someone brings in, so they do euthanize animals.&nbsp; It was important to me to be saving a life as well as finding my new buddy.&nbsp; It&#039;s probably also the most cost-effective way to adopt, unless you get a &quot;free kitty&quot; from craigslist or something.&nbsp; I went to their Manhattan shelter, which is in a slightly scary neighborhood but nobody bothered me.&nbsp; There are usually volunteers there on weekends to help out adoptors.&nbsp; <br /><br />Some friends of mine found their perfect kitty at the North Shore Animal League, which I believe is in Nassau County, so I don&#039;t know if traveling there is a possibility for you.&nbsp; According to their website though, they&#039;re waiving adoption fees for cats in October:&nbsp; http://www.nsalamerica.org/ (http://www.nsalamerica.org/).&nbsp; They are a no-kill organization, and my friends had a very positive experience there.

				One of my friends has adopted several cats from North Shore and always had a good experience.<br /><br />When we expanded our family in February of this year we went to the Petco in Union Square which is run by a nonprofit called Kitty Kind.&nbsp; They were incredibly helpful and thorough in the screening process which was reassuring for us.&nbsp; We ended up with a brother and sister who are simply amazing (and couldn&#039;t be separated). Their one caveat though is if you are adopting a kitten they require you to adopt two so they aren&#039;t lonely.&nbsp; Older cats you can adopt by themselves.<br /><br />If you go on a weekend ask for Davy and tell him I sent ya.<br /><br />Good luck!

				I adopted my kitten through Pet Finder (http://petfinder.com/ (http://petfinder.com/)). They have all ages of cats (I had to get a kitten to get along with my existing 2 yr cat to avoid total confrontation).<br /><br />You can browse a number of available adoptable cats/ kittens in the area by picture, short description and any background info if known. Most cats on Pet Finder were on the euthanize list at shelters and picked up through &quot;foster parents&quot; until full-time parents are found. They ask for a donation to cover shots/ neuter.<br /><br />I had a great experience. My kitten was so sweet (he&#039;s even on the website!). After I adopted him they sent someone a few weeks later to check up on him to make sure he was well provided for. I can give you the name / email of the woman I went through if you PM me.

				belle --<br /><br />What made you decide to go with a kitten? Our cat has lived with other cats, but they&#039;ve always been a lot younger than him.<br /><br />In those situations, however, it was always multiple bedroom apts, whereas we have a 1.5 bedroom with lots of room, but I feel like it&#039;s different when each cat has their own room by virtue of their owners having their separate spaces.

				I&#039;ll put in another good word for North Shore Animal League. My roommate and I got our awesome cat Wuzzle from there. My roommate actually grew up in that part of Long Island and volunteered for the shelter in high school. She said it was full or really great people who seemed to take really good care of the animals, etc. It&#039;s also a no-kill shelter, if that makes a difference to you. <br /><br />When I was a child my family adopted a kitten from North Shore Animal league. As someone mentioned previously, some kittens must be adopted in pairs. But, my family really could only adopt 1 more cat (we already had one at that point) and there was a man there who also only could adopt 1 cat so they let us. I think if you already have a cat then they&#039;ll let you adopt just 1 kitten - they just need the kitten to have someone to learn to socialize with. <br /><br />We drove there, but I remember the website sying that there was an LIRR station within walking distance. <br /><br />Good luck!<br />

				I found my kitty on the Petfinder website (she was being fostered with Francis&#039;s Friends in Astoria).<br /><br />They were super nice-- when I called to inquire about the cat, the woman who was fostering her (Laura, I believe) brought her over to my place, and said I could keep her for the weekend so we could try each other out. If I decided not to keep her, she would have come back to get her no questions asked, but luckily it was a good match... I&#039;ve had her almost 5 years now, and she&#039;s my bestest little buddy :)

				I found Nancy Larkin through Francis&#039; Friends and she was amazing. She and her cat rescue friends have contacts EVERYWHERE! I was very specific about what I wanted (two older companion cats who were lovey-dovey) and she completely hooked me up. I now have brother/sister 8-year-olds who were locked out by the landlord when their owner died, but continued to sit in front of the door. They were brought to the Staten Island AC&amp;C and were unfortunately on the euthanasia list for the following week. Nancy was there for something else rescue-related, thought of me, and once I approved, got the whole process in motion. She fixed it so that I didn&#039;t owe a cent, and contracted with another rescuer to have the cats driven from Staten Island to Astoria, right to my apartment. She&#039;s the best - really listens to what you want/need and finds it, doesn&#039;t try to just pawn cats off on you. I&#039;m happy to provide her # to anyone who wants to PM me.

				I adopted my first cat from North Shore Animal league.&nbsp; They are a wonderful shelter and very well run.&nbsp; I also adopted my dog from them years ago.&nbsp; We actually went to adopt two kittens, but totally fell in love with Noogie.&nbsp; He was six months- technically a kitten, but bigger.&nbsp; We adopted our second cat 6 months later from Francis Friends here in Astoria.&nbsp; They were great as well.&nbsp; Pooh was a kitten when we got him, and Noogie took to him immediately.&nbsp; They are best buddies.&nbsp; Noogie was able to establish his dominnance without being &quot;nasty&quot;.&nbsp; in 6 years, they&#039;ve never even hissed at each other.<br />I also used to volunteer at the ASPCA on 92nd &amp; 2nd, and can recommend them as well.&nbsp; Their cats are very well taken care of, and all of the volunteers can give you definitive insight into their personalities.<br />Good Luck!

				I&#039;m partial to the shelter I&#039;ve been volunteering at for about 20 years (on and off), but it&#039;s over one hour east of NYC. <br /><br />I&#039;m glad there are so many good places in NYC, since I grew up on L.I. and am attached to the shelter out there, I&#039;m not familiar with the ones out this way. But if you ever find yourself out east (or have friends out that way who want to adopt), just Google &quot;pet finders grateful paw cat shelter&quot; and the site should come up. It&#039;s a no-kill, very cheery and well-organized place where the cats are in open rooms.

She had been a solo cat her whole life and was independent, but lonely when we left during the day (she was always waiting at the door when we came home and circle us and stick by us all night). We decided to get a second cat for her to play with.<br /><br />We went to a few shelters and spoke to people and most everyone recommended we get a kitten. We had an adult female at home and people told us females are more territorial and dominant. A kitten could acclimate to this more easily and the older cat could dominate (or become motherly) to a kitten more easily.<br /><br />We were also told to get a male. Again b/c of the territorial thing and b/c male cats are more often less dominant. Basically they said combos of male-male or male-female (as long as they&#039;re fixed) work best.<br /><br />From Pet Finders I got our kitten from Zani&#039;s Furry Friends: http://www.petfinder.com/shelters/NY606.html (http://www.petfinder.com/shelters/NY606.html)<br /><br />This is my fur ball who came complete with a severe eye infection (he was really weak when they took him in) and herpies for our other cat! He turned out to be a Main Coon breed and is totally sweet and more like a dog.

				The two fabulous cats I live with were also gotten at The Humane Society.&nbsp; They were about 4 months old when they came into our lives and are now about 4 years old.&nbsp; The Humane Society did a great job socializing them and preparing them and us to bring them home.&nbsp; The Humane Society is no joke when it comes to the adoption process.&nbsp;

				Bravo to you for wanting to adopt from a shelter!&nbsp; Please continue to seek out reputable shelters and rescue organizations and do NOT purchase from a pet store.&nbsp; <br /><br />NSAL, Humane Society, Kitty Kind/PETCO, and ACC are all great places to find wonderful animal companions.&nbsp; Animal Care and Control is a very harsh place, as they are a kill shelter, and you will probably see animals who are about to be put to sleep there - but from what I am told, the staff there is great and very helpful.&nbsp; <br /><br />If I can give a recommendation for the non-profit, no-kill animal shelter I volunteer with, it&#039;s OLLIE&#039;S PLACE www.olliesplace.org - located in Murray Hill (26th St and 3rd Ave) and filled with wonderful, loving cats waiting for their forever home.&nbsp; You can visit any evening from 6-8 and they are open all day on weekends.&nbsp;

				Hmmm...that&#039;s a tough one.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s probably unlikely a place will let you adopt a cat on a &quot;trial&quot; basis but I&#039;m sure any staff member or volunteer can give good tips on how to integrate a new cat into an already-cat living household.&nbsp; Typically, cats don&#039;t play nice for the first couple of weeks but once the alpha cat figures out the other one isn&#039;t going away, they&#039;ll get over it and start getting along as best they can.&nbsp; <br /><br />And just because they&#039;re not playing or cuddling together doesn&#039;t mean they don&#039;t get along!&nbsp; In turn, just because they&#039;re fighting often and/or avoiding one another entirely doesn&#039;t mean they hate one another.&nbsp; Cats are finicky but can definitely adapt to new situations very easily.&nbsp;

I&#039;ve had her almost 5 years now, and she&#039;s my bestest little buddy :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s great, artgirl! Sorry I missed that detail before.

				On a related topic, one of our fellow Astorians recently rescued a cat from the Acropolis Gardens. She&#039;s cute as a button, estimated at a little under a year old, with a clean bill of health, and is already spayed. <br /><br />The craigslist ad is here: http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/pet/881449791.html or PM me for more info.

				I got my little guy from Francis&#039; Friends almost a year ago. The foster mom found him on the streets of Astoria and raised him by hand (very dedicated work, let me tell you)<br /><br />I actually saw him on Petfinder before he was old enough to be adopted, so I got to meet him through this awesome lady Pat and &quot;visited&quot; him several times before we actually brought him home. They are really great people, and because they are Astoria based, Pat was able to visit me a few times at home to give my kitten all the shots he needed (she was a former vet. assistant). <br /><br />Oh, and I got a free cat carrier with it! They are great, what can I say.&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				Each day invariably I pass Animal Clinic of LIC.&#160; They&#039;ve got an adoption cage right in the bench seating area, and there was an attractive four-legged pal in it just last night.&#160; One wishes that clinic would avail itself of Astorians as a way to show us who&#039;s there.<br /><br />- Cannibal<br />whose respiratory tract will no longer allow him to house these blessed creatures
