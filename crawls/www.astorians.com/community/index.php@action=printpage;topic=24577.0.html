				Hi There!<br /><br />I&#039;m Kait =) I&#039;m a 23-year-old, young professional female looking to move into Astoria. Currently, I work 9-7ish as a Publicity Assistant. Anyway, here are some things about me that would probably be helpful for you to know...<br /><br />- I&#039;m a liberal<br />- Open to a good party, but by no means a party animal<br />- Would love to be friends, but I can totally be quiet and keep to myself also<br />- I like to drink but not excessively<br />- I don&#039;t smoke cigs or weed, but if that&#039;s your thing on occasion I&#039;m not opposed.<br />- I&#039;m very tidy and would like you to be the same<br />- I&#039;m okay with overnight guests as long as they&#039;re not too sassy and pick-up after themselves- Though I am straight, I&#039;m 110% in support of the LGBTQ crowd<br />- I have a great boyfriend, who would stop by from time to time (NOT incessantly) <br />- I&#039;m the &quot;creative type.&quot;<br />- Very likable, friendly, fun, kind, responsible, and courteous. Just all around pretty rad. =)<br />- Also, I work a lot but I like to keep myself active when I&#039;m not.- I have two kitties that would be joining us in our new apartment venture. They&#039;re short hair, declawed, and sleep 95% of the time.<br /><br />Let me know if you&#039;d like to get a cup of tea/coffee/drinks and discuss!<br /><br />Also, please be prepared to show me links to facebook, linkedin, and/or twitter!<br /><br />Hope to hear from you =)<br />Kait

				Hey Kait--I&#039;m also looking for an apartment/roommate in the Astoria area for May 1! $800 budget but hoping to find something a little cheaper...<br /><br />Anyway, you sound so fun and I think we&#039;d get along! I am a nanny and art student and I&#039;m clean and generally pretty quiet, but definitely looking for a roommate I can be friends with. I also have a boyfriend who would be over occasionally, and I love cats ;) I&#039;m a big tv/movie buff, he least judgemental person you&#039;ll ever meet, and I like to bake! <br /><br />Let me know if you&#039;re still looking! I would love to meet up for a chat (: you can email me for more info at 3mma5ue@gmail.com

				<span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue;" class="bbc_font">Hey there!</span><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue;" class="bbc_font">My current roommate and I are looking for a third person to join us in our quest for a 3 bedroom apartment in Astoria.&nbsp; We have been looking on craigslist and meeting a ton of brokers and have finally zeroed in on two apartments that are affordable, in absolutely great locations and seem worth our while. </span><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue;" class="bbc_font">We are 2 working professional men in our mid twenties with busy schedules looking for someone similar (happy to consider a female roommate as well). We are looking at a March 31st/April 1st move in date. </span><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue;" class="bbc_font">The rent The apartments we have looked at involve a broker&#039;s fee and a security deposit in addition to the first month&#039;s rent.
