				I&#039;m looking to take a nice, long, leisurely walk somewhere in NYC either today or tomorrow for a bit of solitude and reflection. What would be your recommendations for a pretty vista, unusual scenery, great architecture, a place to sit for a spell and read a little JA, or even the possibility of a delicious light nosh? Ideas for Brooklyn or the other boroughs would be welcome, too. <br /><br />Thanks!

				There&#039;s the street closures Saturday in Manhattan. It won&#039;t be quiet, but will be unique.

				How&#039;s about the Brooklyn Bridge.&nbsp; I recommend taking the train to the Brooklyn side then walking to Manhattan and to South Street Seaport.&nbsp; You&#039;ll be abe to see the waterfalls.&nbsp; Its great!

				The Bronx Botanical Gardens is a nice place to get away from it all. Even when it&#039;s crowded for an exhibit, you can nearly always find a quiet space.

				I don&#039;t think there&#039;s quiet anywhere in the NYC area, but there are parts of Central Park, up in the 70s and 80s, that feel slightly secluded-ish and faux-woodsy.<br /><br />When I lived in Cobble Hill I used to like to take long walks around CH and Brooklyn Heights to enjoy the quaintness and the promenade.&nbsp; Not quiet enough for Austenizing but a bit of a peaceful vibe.&nbsp; It&#039;s a long ride, though.

				Prospect Park and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden (http://www.bbg.org/). <br /><br />Start in the Botanic Garden.&nbsp; As you leave, you can duck into the Brooklyn Museum if the mood strikes you.&nbsp; Wander through Prospect Park and down 8th Street in Park Slope -- my favourite street anywhere and the winner of Brooklyn&#039;s 2008 Most Beautiful Street contest.<br /><br />If you do this tomorrow, you can head down 7th Ave. and hit Cafe Steinhof (http://www.cafesteinhof.com/) for brunch.&nbsp; It seems that my other go-to place for brunch has closed.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-(&nbsp; That said, there are tons of places on 5th Ave.<br /><br />

				How about Governor&#039;s Island? The ferry there is free, and you get the added benefit of wind blowing all over your face.<br /><br />http://www.govisland.com/

				Governor&#039;s Island is also quiet and even if the ferry is chock full of people, there&#039;s plenty of room to spread out. Rollerblading and biking around the island is awesome, too.

				<br />I really really love the north end of Central Park.&nbsp; It&#039;s not nearly as crowded as the south end.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve never been to the north east corner go check out the Harlem Meer and the conservatory gardens.&nbsp; If not this weekend - before you leave the city.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Roosevelt Island and the tram isn&#039;t a bad way to spend some time.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Randalls Island is a bit big to do on foot - But if you&#039;re in East Harlem and you take the pedestrian bridge across - it&#039;s much more ped friendly than the Triboro.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I also really like walking around in Battery Park it&#039;s esp nice at sunset.&nbsp; &nbsp;The waterfront parks in battery park city are pretty quiet too.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />My bicycle is dying to be ridden - if you want to borrow it - I don&#039;t see myself needing it for the next few weeks. <br /><br /><br />

				I walked from Avenue A through the east and west village and ended at Chelsea piers...the walk was definitely thoughtful and lots of eye candy and then the piers were lovely and quiet...a few picnics and several people reading...I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />I was in Central park on Tuesday and I agree parts are quieter, but overall, not too difficult to find pensive places.

				Thanks so much for all the replies. What great, thoughtful ideas!&nbsp; I ended up going to the Bronx Zoo with my sister. Definitely no solitude or reflection going on there, but loads of fantastic animals. We were looking at the bats when the torrential downpour started, but it only lasted a few minutes.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to work up the energy to go somewhere else today, but walking around the zoo for four hours yesterday wiped me out!<br /><br />However, this is a wonderful list of things to do in New York before I head west.<br /><br />

				I know I am a bit late for this one, but if for the future, I find walking around the industrial areas armed with an iced coffee and a pack of smokes to be very nice.&nbsp; They are often deserted right in the middle of the day on the weekends.&nbsp; Quiet enough that the only thing you can hear is the wind in yoiur ears.&nbsp; They have interesting architecture, with great old buildings they would never build nowadays.&nbsp; They are also often located near the river, so a waterfront view is never far away and finally they are often have some pretty hip hoods nestled up next to them, so you can get good refreshments after spelunking.<br /><br />My favorite is the industrial neighborhood in Red Hook.&nbsp; Take care not to wander directly into the middle of the housing projects (an easy thing to avoid, but they are pretty nasty).&nbsp; Get off at the Smith &amp; 9th Street stop on the F/G (which on its own is something any New Yorker ought to see) and then work your way south and then to the west along the water.&nbsp; There are neat parks and piers and warehouses that smell of cinnamon.&nbsp; In the heat of the summer that peculiar smell of brackish water washes over the area, which some find revolting but I find comforting.&nbsp; When you are all done, work your way back up Van Brunt to Carroll and make a right and go over to Court Street.&nbsp; That will put you right in Carroll Gardens for a great lunch!<br /><br />p.s.- I haven&#039;t done this since the IKEA has been put into Red Hook and I am not sure how the hood has been affected by it.&nbsp;
