				Yeah, Bill Moyers&nbsp; should know about living at the public trough, he has made a career&nbsp; out of it.&nbsp; :wink:&nbsp; Seriously, there is&nbsp; no &#039;leader&#039;&nbsp; of the Tea Party movement, anymore than when Communists&nbsp; who organised the&nbsp; so-called &#039;anti-war&#039;&nbsp; movements from the 60&#039;s&nbsp; on can be all catagorised as being Communists.

				I guess this is how it works. Bill Moyer&#039;s does a hit piece on Dick Armey, but addresses none of the concerns brought to the table. By showing that Dick Armey has been a long time recipient of public health care, all of should naturally be in favor of everyone receiving public health care.<br /><br />
