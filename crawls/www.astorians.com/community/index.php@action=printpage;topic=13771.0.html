				&nbsp;The interent has certainly given more&nbsp; than 15 minutes of fame&nbsp; to many wacky folks. You run across&nbsp; all types, sure, some&nbsp; of it based on fact, but, most like Black Helicopters, FBI agents&nbsp; watching everyone&nbsp; are like&nbsp; UFO&#039;s&nbsp; cause&nbsp; you really don&#039;t need &#039;proof&#039; just&nbsp; some official saying it may be true. It&#039;s&nbsp; sad&nbsp; that things&nbsp; have gotten so crazy in our political&nbsp; world, some of it is&nbsp; no doubt pushed by people with an agenda other than truth. I didn&#039;t&nbsp; vote&nbsp; for President Obama, but, I don&#039;t &#039;hate&#039; him, even as I am concerned of how&nbsp; he may do things&nbsp; that are not so good for us. But, I can&#039;t say&nbsp; the same for&nbsp; many who opposed President Bush, even a few&nbsp; who are elected&nbsp; officials. I would&nbsp; hope we could disagree without criminalising differences. Otherwise,&nbsp; we will descend into a 3rd world&nbsp; nation where&nbsp; leaders come and go&nbsp; and no one ever does anything except enrich themselves.

				While conspiracies (and conspiracy theories) are as old as civilization, I think it took a dangerous turn during the Clinton years. I was working in rural GA for about 9 months and some of the people I were working with were real separatist types. Cash only, lots of guns, Government is setting up intern camps for Christians and a host of other ideas. It was amazing to me how you could take seemingly unconnected facts (or near facts) and weave them into a narrative that defies common sense. And with Y2K it really took off into new areas. But than it got so much worse. The 2000 elections was the grand kick off for a new level of conspiracy theories. And then, of course 9/11. The difference now, is that the separatists are treated with disdain, while writers for The Atlantic wax eloquent on the maternity of Trig Palin. <br />The real problem I have with conspiratists is that by digging a hole so deep they obscure the real issues. They will warn of the dangers of a shadowy organization bent on World domination, while the Council of Foreign Relations www.cfr.org puts out position papers that will accomplish the same thing, and is lauded by the media which make up a substantial part of the organization.
