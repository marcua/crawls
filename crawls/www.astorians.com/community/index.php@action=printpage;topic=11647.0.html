				Just out of curiosity, does anyone know if these types of incidents are matters of public record? Could one go into a police station and find out at least the bare minimum details? (Not that it would make a difference, I don&#039;t think that the 114th could tell you where the Triboro bridge was if they walked out of the station and looked to the left.)

				The way that some of the incidents are listed, I always assumed that someone was getting the info via police scanner.

				Not these issues are linked, but there is a real crappy apartment building on the east side of Crescent Street just north of 31st Avenue.&nbsp; &nbsp;I worked on the census in Astoria in &#039;04 (when Astoria was one of two locations in the country where the Census Bureau was beta testing hand-held computers) and that apartment was a real sh*t hole.&nbsp; &nbsp;I had the unfortunate pleasure of having to go in there and there were all these sinister or at least tough-looking characters sitting in front of the building or in the courtyard on lounge chairs.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think there were some mean-looking dogs too.&nbsp; &nbsp;I knew someone who lived over there who didn&#039;t even like walking by the place.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was odd because two or three of the nicer apartment buildings in Astoria are located right near (the buildings on the east side of Cresenct on each corner of 31st Avenue, right across from Kelly&#039;s Bar.
