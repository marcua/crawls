				I wear a size 15 1/2 men&#039;s shoe and buying shoes has always been a nightmare.&nbsp; Back home, there was one select Modell&#039;s and then a Nordstrom Rack, which were the only stores that had more than two or three pairs in my size.&nbsp; The Modell&#039;s here in Astoria (and the one by my job at Sixth/17th) have got nothing, and the nearest Nordtrom Racks are in Paramus, NJ or out at Roosevelt Field.&nbsp; Any help?&nbsp; I could always turn online, but with shoes, I really like trying them on and get annoyed at the hassle of having to send them back if need be.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for some sandals right now in particular.<br /><br />As a note, this does not have to by any means be in Astoria.&nbsp; I&#039;m willing to travel anywhere accessible by public transit.&nbsp; The closer the better of course.

				Try this place... http://www.eneslow.com/&nbsp; I need wide shoes and they always have what I need.&nbsp; They specialize in special shoes so I would think they would have large size.&nbsp; They have 2 locations in Manhattan and their prices can be high..but to me you get what you pay for.&nbsp; Hope this helps.

				Eneslow is very good - a former co-worker of mine used to get her shoes there. <br />She had the opposite problem - very tiny feet!<br /><br />Another place to try is Harry&#039;s Shoes at Broadway &amp; 83rd. They&#039;re supposed to have a <br />large selection and supposedly do special orders. <br /><br />They also have a website to browse:<br /><br />http://harrysshoes.reachlocal.net/<br />
