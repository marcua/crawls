				I&#039;m looking for an <strong>UNFURNISHED</strong> room in Astoria in a cat-friendly, gay-friendly household. I&#039;m a financially-responsible gay woman, single, friendly and a non-smoker.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got a great sense of humor and I&#039;m fairly laid back. I know how to be sociable while also being respectful of your privacy in a city where private space is at a premium.<br /><br /><strong>Workwise:</strong> I&#039;m currently a literary agent at a small but well-respected agency in Manhattan. I work primarily with science fiction, fantasy, pop culture and gay/lesbian writers. I also work a second job doing production at a magazine, which is dreadfully dull but keeps me in expensive coffee.&nbsp; :-D<br /><strong><br />When I&#039;m Not Working: </strong>I work about 80-100 hours a week so lately I haven&#039;t had much of a social life. I&#039;m pretty quiet when I&#039;m at home. (Mostly reading books or editing manuscripts.) But sometimes I&#039;m too busy for my own good. I like to spend time enjoying the city. I confess to being a big nerd; I love board games like Scrabble and Risk. <em>(Although occasionally I get Monopoly and Risk confused, thus resulting in the unfortunate placement of hotels in the Ural Mountains while my army unwittingly invades Park Place. Tragic!)</em> I enjoy movies and cooking for friends and - when I&#039;m not too lazy to drag my ass out of bed in the morning - lifting weights. I play pool <em>(badly)</em>, and I&#039;m a big fan of just relaxing on the front stoop with a book in the summer. In fact, books are my livelihood and my life; you&#039;ll never lack for something to read if I move in.<br /><br />Some things for you to know about me:<br /><br />* I have furniture to contribute to the common space, and kitchen things if you need them. If not, no worries!<br /><br />* I love Astoria; have lived there for ten years. I was recently priced out of my awesome one-bedroom, thus the move back into a roommate situation. I prefer the area around the Broadway N/W stop but am open to anything really.<br /><br />* I have two cats. They&#039;re affectionate, very friendly, well-behaved and don&#039;t scratch furniture (they use a cardboard scratching post) and have lived with other cats in the past. <br /><br />* I really like to cook for other people so if you&#039;re around and up for trying one of my experimental dishes, awesome! I make great oatmeal chocolate chip cookies and the world&#039;s best three bean vegetarian chili. (But I&#039;m biased, of course.)<br /><br />* I&#039;m extremely tidy and respectful of common areas<br /><br />* This is a big one for me: I have asthma, which is pretty much under control. But I really need to live in an apartment that&#039;s totally smoke-free. <em>(That includes no 420 in the house. Although you&#039;re always welcome to bake it into your brownies.) </em><br /><br />* Bonus points if you don&#039;t mock my dreadful fashion sense and total addiction to <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>.<br /><br />Anyway, let me know what you think. :-)<br /><br />Thanks very much for your time. <br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Colleen<br />(cell phone) 917-312-1612
