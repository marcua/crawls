				Yes actually I need this info too!!<br /><br />There are lots of stylists around here but I have not ventured into one yet. I still go into the city. <br /><br />If anyone has references for men's haircuts as well I will pass it along.

				A fellow cafe-goer recommended &quot;SPAce&quot; to me. &nbsp;it's just across the st from freeze (well, on the other side of ditmars btw 31st and 29th).<br /><br />i got a shampoo and cut for 22.50. &nbsp;i said no to the blowdry so they gave me a hand drier and let me dry it myself.

				uhhh, i'm new to this whole &quot;getting a haircut&quot; thing. &nbsp;it's an experience i've had fewer than 10 times. &nbsp;you've seen the pics. &nbsp;so i don't know how things are supposed to go. &nbsp;but i've compared notes with women who are more accustomed to haircuts and have expectations based on years of experience, and they (well, she) tells me that they usually blow it dry and just don't style it when you say &quot;just a cut and shampoo&quot;. &nbsp;so, yeah. &nbsp;i sort of wish they'd taken the time to dry it for me. &nbsp;<br /><br />i'm certainly not complaining about the cut because the girl did exactly what i said i wanted, but now i think i want something i didn't know that i wanted before. &nbsp;i should have taken in a picture and said 'make me beautiful, dammit!'

				I've tried a few salons and I can recommend Friends Hair Design, yep the one with all the guys in it on 3116 Ditmars Blvd (718) 274-0060. &nbsp;Also for a good men's haircut, I recommend Allie, my husband loves him. Anyway, they do pretty well with haircuts. For a good blowdry, I have tried them and they are good but not the best I've had but better than most in Astoria.

				Allie is one of the guys at Friends Hair Design. I can officially say he cuts all kinds of hair very well. He just cut my brothers hair as well. &nbsp;Really good job, takes his time and even did his moustache. Awesome! &nbsp;Friends Hair Design is very close to the Ditmars Boulevard subway last stop on the N/W line. If you get off the subway, walk towards Commerce bank on the corner, take a right on Ditmars and you cannot miss them just past the bus stop.

				I found out about SPAce on citysearch<br /><br />i went the first time and asked for a cut ($20). &nbsp;The stylist also &quot;styled&quot; my hair - which I hadn't asked for - I didn't realize that blowing curly hair and scruntching it with gel was &quot;styling&quot; and for this extra I was charged another $16. &nbsp;I was bugged - b/c I always go home and rise my newly cut hair to get all the hair off my body - and my curly doo doesn't require much &quot;styling.&quot; &nbsp;<br /><br />Anywho - I went back to SPAce yesterday - and was more clear that i only wanted a cut. &nbsp;I finished up drying under the dryer. &nbsp;Great place to read those girly magazines you'd never actually buy. &nbsp;the Cut was $20 plus tax. &nbsp;Great price. &nbsp;<br /><br />Adela is the 2nd stylist I went to there - I think she was better than the first (don't remember he name). &nbsp;Just remember to be clear about what you want. &nbsp;Talk the the stylist before you get your hair washed so you can show her/him what you want. &nbsp;<br /><br />and remember - it will always grow back.

				I was also pleased with SPAce. &nbsp;I got my hair cut there in March to go to a wedding, and was very pleased. &nbsp;They actually may have convinced me to leave my long-time Park Slope hair stylist. &nbsp;I like them much better than Linda &amp; Gina's (never know how to spell their names, because the lettering on the window is different from the lettering on the awning), although I haven't been to Linda &amp; Gina's in years, so they may be better now.<br /><br />For reference, my hair is primarily straight and very thick, but sections of it have a definite wave. &nbsp;This gives me a cowlick in the back that a lot of stylists struggle with. &nbsp;The woman at SPAce, whose name I unfortunately forget, did a good job with it.

				I visited SPACE but just to get a wash and a blow. I arrived and asked them if they could do it and the receptionist said yes. &nbsp;I sat and waited a bit and asked about the blowdry (which was my main concern) and the hairdresser said, No it's too late for that, all we can do is wash your hair. &nbsp;I thought, duh, I can do that myself, it's more the blowdry I wanted, I have long hair and need a good blowdry for it to hold. &nbsp;They were going to let me sit down, wash my hair and then tell me, oh sorry we can't blow your hair. &nbsp;I just said never mind and left.

				I have been going to SPAce, formerly Giorgio's, for about 8 years.<br />I always use Edna. &nbsp;I think she does a great job. I am always very pleased with the color, (I get highlights,) as well as the cut. <br />To save money I do not get the blow dry, they charge a lot for that, I think at least $25 if not more. &nbsp;I guess that got so expensive because having the straightening/blowout type of drying got to be such a big thing.<br />&nbsp;My hair is thin and blonde and she does a good job with it. She also does a lot of men's hari <br />&nbsp; Usually she will dry my hair anyway, but not style it, just pass the dryer over it so that I'm not leaving the shop with a dripping head. &nbsp;I would be happy if they just passed me the dryer, because I thought technically if I said no to the blowdry, that means, no dryer at all.

				Maybe I will give SPAce another chance, and ask for someone a little more experienced next time. &nbsp;This Edna sounds like she might be able to deal with my hair successfully. &nbsp;I am thinking of growing it long again, so we'll see.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: tuesday</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I have been going to SPAce, formerly Giorgio's, for about 8 years.<br />I always use Edna. &nbsp;I think she does a great job.
