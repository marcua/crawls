				Sorry for this being so random... The other day I remembered this movie I watched as a kid and I can&#039;t recall anything about the title... One part of the plot I remember is there&#039;s a little boy who loses his hair for some reason, so he and his friends find and concoct this hair-growth paste which they spread all over his bald head... after that, his hair won&#039;t stop growing, at a fast rate.&nbsp; Even in school, the kid sitting behind him in class is cutting his hair, and it doesn&#039;t even matter because it&#039;s several feet long.&nbsp; I also remember one scene where he&#039;s in some sort of landfill or standing on top of a large pile of rubble... It was a dreamy/magical kind of movie (obviously) and it HAS to be at least 15 years old.&nbsp; Any help??

				I loved that movie, but never thought anyone else saw it. I love how they painted with his hair after he grew it and it was these beautiful painting s that you could walk into. <br /><br />He had lost his hair from being scared...it was a fright.
