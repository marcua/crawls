				Yankees single game tickets go on sale February 29th, but ticket packages are on sale now.&nbsp; Mets tickets probably go on sale in late Feb as well.&nbsp; You can always check Stubhub too, a lot of season ticket holders put their tickets up.<br />Speaking of season tickets, I still don&#039;t know if mine come with the All Star Option.&nbsp; They effing better.

				I have the 43 game package, and I&#039;m an idiot, because I didn&#039;t realize that the last game at Yankee Stadium was a Sunday like 2 weeks before the season actually ends, which is why I don&#039;t get it (and incidentally, I don&#039;t get the saturday game, as my tickets are during the week only).&nbsp; Me am dum.

				Last regular season game at Yankee Stadium is a super premium. There is currently a drawing to have the CHANCE to buy one of the last three games, Mets games, Opening Day, Red Sox games and Old Timers day. Season license holders (except those with full seasons) will have their chance to buy their tickets around the 15th or so. But only as many as your license currently covers. (In my case 2 tix) If you win the chance in the lottery (drawing is the 25th) you can buy up to 4 tix for those games.<br /><br />My 8 game plan includes a Red Sox Game and an inter-league game but NO Met games. (this year it&#039;s San Diego)

				bumping!<br /><br />Got &#039;em!<br /><br />Last regular season game at the &quot;Cathedral of Baseball&quot;, &quot;The House that Ruth Built&quot;, aka Yankee Stadium.<br />Sept 21st @ 7pm. Tier Box, 5 rows up in sec 669- Upper Deck HR territory. Who knows, I may catch the last HR in The Old Stadium!<br />And I will say now, that if I do catch it, I won&#039;t sell it to the highest bidder. It will go to the Yankees and Baseball HOF. For a few token items of course... Big screen HDTV, Season tickets, and an Maldives Boat trip!

				this might be wishful thinking on my part -<br />Girardi around for 10+ years with 5+ World Series championships.<br /><br /><br />I think the Yankees are making enough profits. No worries there. And the payroll is starting to stabilize.<br />So it is just a question of whether they have quality seasons and strong in the playoffs.<br />I count on them doing that. If not, maybe he could be gone given all their resources. <br />Not sure who could do better.<br />And he has the support of the players so far. Hope that continues for years.<br /><br />[ would love to see how Coach G would handle a Reggie/fiery player ]<br /><br />Basicly, he should have at least 4 years or until the Red Sox could win another Series.<br />Damn.<br />&nbsp;:angel:<br /><br />

				Oh man. Last night&#039;s game was so much fun to watch. <br /><br />It&#039;s funny how much more angry and anti-Boston Yankee Stadium was. When I went in August last year, it was all fun and games and no one really game me that much trouble. But last night, they were &quot;spilling&quot; beers, throwing peanuts and really screaming at us. And it&#039;s only April!<br /><br />I think it just goes to show that now that we&#039;ve got two WS wins in the recent past, it wasn&#039;t just a fluke and we&#039;re going to be real competition for the Yanks from here on out.<br /><br />Moose, here we come!

				So the Yankees are jerks with their ticketing again.&nbsp; All Star tickets went on sale today.&nbsp; If you have a big plan, you have to buy all the dates (not just the All Star Game or HR Derby) and if you have bleacher seats (aka the best seats) you&#039;re sitting somewhere else, somewhere less good.<br />So while I will be watching the derby and the All Star Game live, I will have blown a load of cash on it, to likely sit in the worst section of Tier Reserve...

				<br />Saw the Mets recently on the road.<br />Not a happy ending for the team.<br /><br />The Yanks may be about as good as the Twins right now. Which is not saying so much.<br />Still, I think they will win the most games after the all-star break.<br />I have to think that, given circumstances.<br /><br />Let&#039;s Go<br />Yan - Kees<br /><br /><br /><br />Not for casual baseball fans, but there is incredible profiling and reporting about pitching with Mussina &amp; Glavine called:<br />http://www.amazon.com/Living-Black-Pitchers-Season-Remember/dp/0316113913<br /><strong><span class="bbc_u">Living on the Black:</span></strong><br />(if the title has no meaning for you, should best skip it, or it works very well as a doorstop)<br /><br />Product Description<br />Pitchers are the heart of baseball, and John Feinstein tells the story of the game today through one season and two great pitchers working in the crucible of the New York media market. Tom Glavine and Mike Mussina have seen it all in the Major Leagues and both entered 2007 in search of individual milestones and one more shot at The World Series-Glavine with the Mets, Mussina five miles away with the Yankees. The two veterans experience very different seasons--one on a team dealing with the pressure to get to a World Series for the first time in seven years, the other with a team expected to be there every year. Taking the reader through contract negotiations, spring training, the ups of wins and losses, and the people in their lives-family, managers, pitching coaches, agents, catchers, other pitchers--John Feinstein provides a true insider&#039;s look at the pressure cooker of sports at the highest level.<br />

				Congrats to Met fans on the acquisition of Francisco Rodriguez. It&#039;s always fun to watch him pitch&nbsp; :lol:<br /><br />Now then-even though Cashman supposedly hasn&#039;t made an offer to Mark Teixeira I&#039;m keepin my fingers crossed that the Yankees are interested in him and have a few million set aside for him. He&#039;s definitely worth pursuing.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be really upset if he ends up in Boston :x

				If the Yanks have no limit to payroll, which might be the case, then it would be nice to have Teixeira. But most teams would not have an all-star at each position.<br />But Rays showed you can win with the right team roster.<br /><br /><br />Thankfully the Yanks did get a pitcher like CC, and more pitching is needed. Boston already has pitching, they can look at other positions.<br /><br /><br />If Melky is gone, that makes me a bit sad. But they would know if they needed a change..

However, I&#039;m pretty disappointed that he didn&#039;t also apologize for lying on 60 Minutes. I&#039;m no fan of A-Rod&#039;s, but the man would&#039;ve earned a lot of respect from me if he&#039;d also &#039;fessed up to lying and apologized for it.

				Tampa really should be the team to beat in the al east this season , since they won it last yr and should get some respect . Problem is with the yankees roster being so stacked as it is , hard for critics&nbsp; to not favor them . Yes sox do have a solid team ,&nbsp; solid pen and very good starting rotation . I do think they come up a little short in the hitting dept with Ortiz slipping a little and no Manny means no matter what , he wont be replaced .&nbsp; Ofcouse injuries happen and no one knows the future which is what makes sports so great .

				tonight it is baseball ^2<br /><br /><br />the first of many more battles. Yanks and Boston, neither in first place yet, with 9 wins out of 16 games which sounds about right.

				Money doesnt buy you a win in the playoffs .&nbsp; Redsox had a 160 MIL payroll last season and lost in the postseason to the Rays who had a 50 mil payroll .&nbsp; IN the end&nbsp; its whos hot at the right time and ofcourse injuries have alot to do with it .

				This yr isnt over yet , we still have the postseason to look fwd to , unless you are a mets fan .&nbsp; Then u basically pray&nbsp; reyes makes it back next spring and wait to see if they trade beltran or david wright .&nbsp; Neither have gotten the team into the postseason with the highest payroll in the nl yr after yr .<br />I also dont think it has to do with health or being hot enough ,&nbsp; &nbsp;when u get swept by the nats&nbsp; &nbsp;theres no excuses . The nats might be one of the worst teams ever created in the history of baseball .&nbsp; Frankie Rodriguez allowing 5 runs in the 9th last night , has no excuse as to say well Delgado or Reyes werent in the lineup /&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Its basically called laying down like a dog /

They played Their Game yesterday, running circles around the Yanks.&nbsp; Home runs by Jeter, Rodriguez and Damon, but in the end it&#039;s about pitching, I guess. The warm weather thawed out Girardi&#039;s brain a bit too much it seems.

				<br />I know the All Star reference was a bit random. When I think of so many great players, I imagine they are the top 2% of all players.<br />And half of them are unlikely to get into the HOF.<br />So I find it helpful to compare great players with others of their generation, like the all stars.<br /><br />I would have Edgar as midrange when it comes to other greats of his time.<br />But if Mariano says he should be in the HOF, voters should consider that.<br /><br />This cold wont last forever.

				Edgar as midrange in his generation in comparison to other greats ??? So basically you are putting him in the middle of the pack .&nbsp; &nbsp;Well comparing him wth every single player would be kinda impossible but if u wanna compare him to the players from that allstar game in 1992 i would say he clearly is in the top part of both total rosters&nbsp; AL &amp; NL .&nbsp; Its hard to compare players from different positions , but as a pure hitter edgar was very good . His career obp was .418 , career slugging .515 .... a guy like kirby puckett had a career obp of .360 and slugging of .477 /&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not&nbsp; even close to edgar . <br /><br />A guy like Joe Carter who was known as a big slugger and a threat at the plate everytime , doesnt come closeto Edgar in raw hiting numbers . Carters career obp was .306 and even with his hrs&nbsp; his slugging is .464 .&nbsp; &nbsp; Edgars career OPS+ is an outstanding 147&nbsp; !&nbsp; Carters is 105 , pucketts is 124, ...guys like R. Alomar and R.Sandberg are 116 and 114 .&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Ofcourse everyone is entitled to their opinion&nbsp; but id like to know which players of that allstar game , career wise as pure hitters do u think are better ?&nbsp; Hope u dont even name guys like Bonds and Mac , cuz i dont like to even include them in any baseball convo .<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Good article ,but gardner who is also an above avg outfielder can do just abt the same exact things winn can do , and u get him for even cheaper than u got winn . He can bunt , hit for singles and an occasional extra-base hit or hr&nbsp; and plays a very good outfield .&nbsp; Losing damon&nbsp; means you have lost 24 hrs and a guy who can get on base and run and take extra bases . Yea he is aging but so is everyone else .&nbsp; I kinda wished damon would take 7 mil per for 2 yrs , despite the good season he had last yr&nbsp; thats still a huge paycut from 13 mil . So i cant blame damon much for not jumping on that offer originally and waiting it out a little . Boras is the big problem in all of this . He did the same exact thing with Jason Varitek last yr&nbsp; &nbsp;and eventually Varitek caved in and took the redsox offer but lost out on millions cuz he listened to Boras . <br /><br />Winn can be a late inning plug in and play great defense , yea&nbsp; fine , but come july if the yankees arent in 1st or very close to it&nbsp; and Winn isnt playing to hot&nbsp; , fans and owners will miss Damon and Matsui alot .&nbsp; &nbsp; Remember the player is still getting paid regardless of where he goes , the team though in the end is the one who suffers if they dont win .

				<br />T, curious whether you think either/ Joba and Phil both should be in the bullpen.<br />As Sherman wrote, it would be nice to have someone who could fill-in in part for Mariano. But I dont see how a setup reliever means as much as a 5th starter. Or is that these days starters have trouble staying healthy and going for later innings.

				I think overall Joba would be better off in the pen , cuz he doesnt look like a starter to me (&nbsp; he barely gets out of the 4th or 5th inning )&nbsp; &nbsp;.&nbsp; &nbsp;I know he is young and has time&nbsp; , but this yr he needs to prove alot .&nbsp; As for Hughes , while he might have better starter stuff but last yr in the pen he was totally dominant and played a huge role on our team and pen . <br /><br />Yea Mariano is getting older and even the greatest closer of all time&nbsp; has to eventually slow down , even though he had another amazing season in 09.<br />Lets see how spring goes , but i&nbsp; guess one of two have to end up in the pen .

				Phillies won in 1980 but they are a team that is over 100 yrs old and won only twice /&nbsp; They had only made the postseason like 10 times , which is unbelievable . So when they won in 2008 it was pretty huge cuz alot of the newer fans and even the 20-30 yr olds dont remember 1980 well .

				Hola Mets fans, when the trophy goes your way one of these decades, it should be very very sweet.<br /><br /><br />Pinstripes fans and Thanos, it would be great to meet someday.<br />I have been reading and wondering how it can be said it is so hard for the Yanks with Jeter being so &#039;old&#039;.<br />So if, when they win, they are proving that wrong.<br /><br />I am happy that the Yanks have Granderson, happy to have younger tools, and less of a bloated budget.<br />The focus is certainly on 2010 and the challenges of the division. It will be interesting though to see future negotiations with Jeter. Will he remain shortstop and for how long.<br />I dont care how old they are, wouldnt you want to have old players like (Damon), Jeter, ARod, Posada, Rivera, Pettite, ...<br /><br /><br />

				Teams change all the time and theres a famous saying that says &quot; you cant fall in love with your players &quot; /.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is said more twds the manager or GM cuz players get old or hurt and sometimes you have to let players you love go .(damon ,matsui) .&nbsp; Yankees re-stocked this offseason but also lost some big players . Key issue is who gets hurt and who doesnt . Last season the Yanks had no big injuries other than Wang being out for the season . Arod and Posada both started on the shelf but came back strong really quick .&nbsp; Cant wait for the season to start&nbsp; cuz the div looks very strong as usual.

				Many people think that the Rays will win 90 games this season making the AL East the best division in baseball , as it has been for the last 10 years.

				AL east by far is the best div in baseball . It was bad enough the Yanks and Redsox had to fight it out almost every year for the div title&nbsp; ,but now TB is a superpower as well . Even Tor is a good team that might have a shot in other divisions .&nbsp; Its gonna be very hard for any team to win over 100 games when you&nbsp; dont have any pushovers other than Balt in that div .

				Theres plenty of Mets bars around but&nbsp; they usually get over taken by Yankee fans for obvious reasons .&nbsp; Mets are gonna have a very very tough time getting fans again this yr and filling those seats . We all know they need the money .&nbsp; <br /><br />Difference with Yankee fans and Redsox fans&nbsp; is&nbsp; , Yanks fans arent obsessed with the redsox soooo badly they have be die hard haters and root against their every step .&nbsp; Redsox fans on the other hand despise the Yankees so much , they even chant &quot;Yankees suck&quot; in their football parades . They sign players with clauses in their contract saying they can never be on the Yankees even if traded from the redsox down the road .&nbsp; Paranoid maybe ??? Seems like they have a very big insecurity about themselves and their team .&nbsp; I know waiting 90 yrs to finally win&nbsp; especially after the Yanks ruled baseball for so long mustve been so tough .

				Yes, you are completely right. Yankee fans do not root against the Sox and their every step at all. :) I&#039;m always greeted with smiles and hugs when I go to Yankee Stadium in Red Sox gear. <br /><br />I&#039;m not insecure about myself of my favorite baseball team. It was tough not winning a WS (although I was not alive for all of those 86 years, not 90) for a while, perhaps that made it sweeter in &#039;04 when the Sox had the greatest comeback in sports history. As a group, Sox fans are pretty passionate, we follow the team through thick and thin.<br /><br />Looking forward to the season, should be a good one. IMO, Opening Day should be a national holiday. Greatest day of the year!
