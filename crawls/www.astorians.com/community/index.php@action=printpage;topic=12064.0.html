				Are they any local 5K runs that you know of that occur in or around Astoria ?<br /><br />A group of us are committing to do the couch to 5K program this Fall/Winter and need to find 5Ks to participate in&nbsp; ....<br /><br />I know there are many in Manhattan.. just curious about over here...<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />

				Out of curiosity, what is the benefit of training for a 5K by running in other ones, rather then just running 3 miles on your own or as a group?&nbsp; I just figured with having to run on someone elses schedule and all of the hub-bub in enrolling in an official 5K, its just simplier to do it on your own.

				I am NOT a runner.<br /><br />I have been a couch potato for&nbsp; a long time.&nbsp; &nbsp; The couch to 5K program is something that will actually get me out there and doing this.&nbsp; &nbsp; I gained a ton of weight since being a very in shape soccer player in HS.&nbsp; &nbsp;My body has since had 3 knee surgeries, a gall bladder surgery and produced and birthed 2 babies.<br /><br /><br />The goal of the C25K program is to motivate the sluggards like me.&nbsp; &nbsp;The 5K is the goal... the training is all done on your own... but it is a 2 month timetable to get from the couch to particpating in your first 5K<br /><br />: ) <br />

				Very cool then and good luck!<br /><br />And please forgive me if you know of this already, but go on down to Union Square or Park Slope to Jack Rabbit Sports.&nbsp; They&#039;ll videotape your gait and get you into a sneaker that is good for you (and they do not try and sell you their most expensive type either).&nbsp; When I first started running, my shins and ankles always hurt.&nbsp; After I got my sneakers from them, those pains are nearly non-existent.&nbsp; I think if I never got those new sneakers, then I probably would not have kept up with running.<br />

				I did the couch to 5k, starting from ZERO running, and in April I ran a half-marathon.&nbsp; If you stick to it it really does work.<br /><br />When I started, I had trouble running for the first 60 seconds.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t run a block.&nbsp; I found a few runners at approximately my level through this board, and we would meet in the mornings and do the program together.&nbsp; I also pursued it on my own later.&nbsp; I worked up to running to the track in Astoria Park and back, and then added distance by adding laps.&nbsp; Sometimes on Saturdays I do long runs through Astoria, going anywhere I feel like.&nbsp; If you&#039;re running in the streets and want to calculate distance, you can use Google Ped (http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/), or if you want real-time data, something like a Garmin Forerunner (http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_e?url=search-alias%3Delectronics&amp;field-keywords=forerunner&amp;x=0&amp;y=0).<br /><br />I agree with Frappe about buying good running shoes.&nbsp; Jack Rabbit Sports is good, or you can go to Super Runners Shop (http://www.superrunnersshop.com/Lex.htm) on Lex and 89th.&nbsp; They also take your time to check your gait and recommend shoes based on that.&nbsp; The first pair they had me try on turned out to be perfect for me, and I&#039;ve been using the same brand/model ever since.<br /><br />There is a running club based out of Astoria Park - Hellgate Road Runners (http://hrr-online.org/).&nbsp; The google cache of their site says they sponsor a 5k race every June, but I can&#039;t find any information about it on their site, so they may not have done it for the past couple of years.<br /><br />Otherwise, check out New York Road Runners (http://www.nyrr.org/).&nbsp; They have the most races, and a lot of 5k races.&nbsp; Occasionally they have races in Queens, but I&#039;d recommend sucking it up and going to one of their races in Central Park one weekend morning.&nbsp; It&#039;s really not far, and it&#039;s so beautiful running through Central Park early in the morning.&nbsp; No matter how I do in the race, it always makes my day to be running, and then walking, through the park so early before the city wakes up.&nbsp; It&#039;s just beautiful.<br /><br />I&#039;m still not a fast runner, and I never will be.&nbsp; But I get the job done, and as I&#039;ve qualified for the 2009 Marathon, that is my next goal.

				Hey all,<br />&nbsp; I just wanted to chime in about the couch to 5k program.&nbsp; I&#039;m having a blast following it.&nbsp; The best way for me to follow the program was to download a podcast where a guy plays music to keep you moving and tells you when to speed up or slow down.&nbsp; It&#039;s located here: http://www.ullreys.com/robert/Podcasts/&nbsp; .&nbsp; There&#039;s another one that I found with more techno music but without the voice instructions.&nbsp; I prefer the voice instructions.&nbsp; It&#039;s a lot like having a personal trainer there with you.&nbsp; I&#039;m on week 5 and I still love it.<br />&nbsp; I had knee and ankle pain when I started out, then I went and got fitted for a better pair of running shoes at a place in White Plains called Westchester Road Runner.&nbsp; After getting the new shoes I have no pain after running.<br />&nbsp; Anyway, I&#039;ll check out the Road Runners groups and maybe see some of you out on the road.&nbsp; I usually run down 20th Ave from 33rd st toward the park and run around the park.&nbsp; It&#039;s a beautiful run but sometimes the fumes from cars and the cigarette smoke make me gag.<br />Cheers,<br />Dan

				nyc8675309, running in fall and spring is a lot easier than winter and summer for obvious reasons-like ready made excuses for the weather, especially if you&#039;re just starting out. If you start now, I believe the program is 9 weeks long, you can actually be prepared to run a real 5K for a good cause. I think I might be aiming for the below run myself and maybe the NYRR&#039;s Midnight Run on 12/31 again.<br /><br />http://www.kintera.org/faf/home/default.asp?ievent=269832 (http://www.kintera.org/faf/home/default.asp?ievent=269832)<br /><br />this is 4 miles:<br />http://www.nyrr.org/races/2007/r1231x00.asp (http://www.nyrr.org/races/2007/r1231x00.asp)

				Just passed, but every August the Federation of Italian Americans of Queens hosts a 5K run here in Astoria. This was the first year I ran the race and it was a lot of fun. Another way to connect to the Astoria community. <br /><br />On the topic of why to find a 5k race rather than run the 3.1 miles on your own...community and motivation. Although running in a tight pack of runners takes some getting used to, it&#039;s definitely inspiring to run among others that probably started running for similar reasons to get in shape. One of the perks of running is that you can do it on your own and on your own schedule, but if you haven&#039;t done so, I strongly suggest throwing an organized race into the mix every now and then. It will help keep your running energized.<br /><br />Also, if you plan in running outside, it will be difficult to start running during the winter, but not impossible. The colder weather and short days are the main challenges. If you run on a treadmill, you can avoid the weather and light issues, but for some treadmills can be incredibly boring. It&#039;s all about knowing yourself and what your &quot;excuses&quot; are, then you can stay motivated and start to really love running.<br /><br />Best of luck to you!<br />Bryan

				Add me to the group of folks who loves C25k! I HATED and feared running before I started it, but decided to give it a shot b/c I had packed on some extra poundage. I nearly died doing W1D1, but kept at it and it got easier. I finished C25k about 2.5 months ago and am now in the middle of Week 8 of One Hour Runner (ran 4.75 miles on Friday -- that&#039;s a big number for me). I f&#039;n LOVE running now and even crave running during my rest days. I feel stronger and healthier and also dropped 20lbs. :D <br /><br />To anyone out there who is interested in running but thinks its &quot;impossible,&quot; I really can&#039;t recommend C25k highly enough. It&#039;s seriously changed my life.<br /><br />I&#039;m running my first race on 9/28. To answer Frappe&#039;s question... I&#039;ve been able to run a 5k on my own for months now, but this will be the first time I&#039;ll be experiencing running as a &quot;communal&quot; event. I&#039;m really looking forward to feeling the energy of the thousands of participants and spectators that will be there that day. Quite a departure from my usual solitary plod down the street at the butt-crack of dawn. :) They also say that you see the most measurable improvements in your first year of running... I&#039;ll be interested to see if I can&#039;t kick up my pace time a little bit by then!<br /><br /><br />EDIT: Oh, and Jackrabbit is great. I bought my shoes there and I&#039;ve been running pretty comfortably. They&#039;re pretty kind to newbies as well... I was nervous they were going to somehow &quot;judge&quot; me when I walked in, but they were very nice.<br /><br />

				It is heartening to hear how many are sharing running as well as couches.<br /><br />It was long ago that a few blocks seemed too far, then got up for a 5k, and then many distances further.<br /><br />For NYRR, a couple of events to note.<br />Sept 21 is the Fifth Ave mile in Manhattan along Central Park.<br /><br />And this weekend, Sept. 14 is the Queens Half (13.1 mi) around College Point.<br /><br /><br />Run strong.

				I&#039;m just throwing this out there....why not have a 5k sponsored by Astorians.com???<br /><br />I see a lot of people in the neighborhood who run.&nbsp; And it would be a great way to get everyone in the community involved, as well as provide some general promotion to this board.&nbsp; An entry fee can be charged (naturally), and a T-shirt can be given away with the fee.&nbsp; Maybe something where you can put your board name on the shirt?!?!?<br /><br />I&#039;m just saying...it&#039;s an idea that kinda makes sense.&nbsp; At least to me it does.&nbsp; I just wouldn&#039;t know the first place to start organizing an event like this.&nbsp; Not to mention it would need the support and blessing of the people who own/operate this board.&nbsp; It&#039;s no small undertaking.

				Coming soon is one of my very favorite runs.<br /><strong>Run for the Parks</strong><br />in central park.<br /><br />It is a great location, a good cause, wonderful time of year and a 4 mile distance. <br />Though an early run at 8am.<br />Kids races ages 2-12 are at 9am.<br /><br /><strong>Sunday April 5th </strong> <br /><br /><br />http://www.nyrr.org/races/2009/r0405x00.asp<br /><br /><br />How about a group of joggers from Astoria?<br /><br />&nbsp; http://www.cityparksfoundation.org/

However, I got rid of my gym membership, so it&#039;s running outside or nothing (as far as running goes) once the weather is a little better. Does the proper sneaker in any way help account for this? I know good running shoes are supposed to absorb something like 2.5x your body weight, but does it depend on the fit?

				Yes, good sneakers that are supportive and are a good fit will help, but if your doctor has advised you not to run outside because it&#039;s too high-impact, then there are no shoes that will cushion your feet enough to guard against your knees. I avoid running outside for this very reason and I don&#039;t even have knee problems. Astoria Park has a great rubberized track, though, which you should definitely check out.

I wish my old boxing trainer was as practical as you. I will definitely check out the track, though. Thanks!

Jun 3rd is National Running Day.&nbsp; Perhaps we can create an event in Astoria Park?&nbsp; &nbsp;It is a weekday.. so maybe plan a 6 or 7 pm run?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How do people use the track there?&nbsp; do they need a permit?&nbsp; Is it open certain hours???<br /><br />

				I didnt know before about June 3.&nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=54437847134<br />&nbsp;I wonder if Hellgate runners would have usual or special plans.<br /><br />http://www.hrr-online.org/workout.asp<br /><br />If I am around, I would be up for meeting folks at Astoria park that evening around 7pm, otherwise perhaps at Athens Square.<br /><br />For the Astoria park track, anyone can and does use it, most any time. <br />Sometimes you will find many folks there. <br />Use regular caution. Sometimes the lighting is good, sometimes not.<br /><br /><br />Happy trails.<br /><br /><br />This morning was a cold but beautiful one in Central Park. It seemed like thousands more, but a bit over 5000 NY RRC runners for the parks foundation.<br />Realized that I am not really set for running up hilly grades. But somehow I beat my slow times from recent years. Maybe I should give up a few more donuts.<br /><br /><br />Also, those moms off the course pushing baby strollers seem quite fast.<br /><br /><br />I mope about NYC in winter, but then I go amnesiac and love the city again on a spring day like today. Wow. <br /><br />http://www.centralparknyc.org/site/PageServer?pagename=virtualpark_southend_themall<br />Central park has the lovely mall/walk with rows of arching elm trees. So beautiful any season, and certainly so now.<br /><br />(http://www.centralparknyc.org/images/content/pagebuilder/10918.jpg)
