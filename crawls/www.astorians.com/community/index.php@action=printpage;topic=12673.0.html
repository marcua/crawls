				Granted, it&#039;s annoying when people don&#039;t take it upon themselves to find the proper resources to give away their stuff. But sometimes it&#039;s harmless.<br /><br />Noticed a paperback left out on somebody&#039;s wall the other night, with a Post-It saying simply, &quot;TAKE.&quot; It was a NY Times #1 bestseller, and in very good shape. <br /><br />The BF had some furniture in excellent shape to unload, and we drove it around town to no avail. One item we were finally able to exchange at an antique store; the other had to go out on the sidewalk with a sign. With a little online advertising, it finally went.<br /><br />I once took a bike that had a &quot;FREE BIKE!&quot; sign on it to Recycle-A-Bicycle in LIC. Wish that the owners had thought to do that themselves. But the BF recently found a 20-year-old mountain bike frame in the trash and has since turned it into his pet project, saving a couple hundred $$$ on a decent around-town bike. <br /><br />As long as it&#039;s done right, I think there&#039;s some good to be had with this process.

				The lady that leaves the book on her wall with the post it &quot;take&quot; is very nice. I see her leaving books at least once a week. She must be an avid reader! I think it is nice that she leaves them there!&nbsp;

				Really? Cool! That is pretty awesome of her. I&#039;ll have to keep an eye out the next time I need some reading.<br /><br />That wall&#039;s just the right size for a big long bookshelf, how funny would that be!
