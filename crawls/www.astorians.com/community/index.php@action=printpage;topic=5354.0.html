				I found this previous thread started by Java, which no one responded to at the time.&nbsp; I was wondering if anyone knows of a good GI specialist in the area, who also takes Aetna Choice POS II.&nbsp; I checked with my PCP, but everyone he refers is out of network and I really can&#039;t afford them right now.&nbsp; The Member Services at Aetna keeps on giving me specialists in Long Island and Westchester.&nbsp; Thanks for your help.

				I have no one to suggest, but I feel your pain. I eventually found a specialist for my own health issues but it was definitely a hassle.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t do this, but I wonder if you could call up one of the other gastros that aren&#039;t on your plan and ask them if they have anyone that they could recommend? It seems that if you find a friendly doctor who knows that you can&#039;t go to them because of insurance issues, they may be able to point you to some good ones. <br /><br />One thing my PCP noticed was that my now-endocrinologist was in a larger office of several endocrinologists, which implies that they are set up, both machine-wise and logistically, to take care of my issues. Perhaps you can also research groups of doctors in the same practice and find one that way.<br /><br />Anyway, good luck to you - hopefully you can find a good one.

				Another thing I just remembered is that I went to my insurance company&#039;s website and was able to research a list of specialists based upon my plan, print them out, and take them to my PCP. He then was able to scan the list and see if he recognized any names. I don&#039;t think those lists are entirely up to date, but sometimes you can luck out.

				Did you try the MDInfo site?<br />I have used it for referrals with very good results.<br />First link is for Manhattan, second for Queens. <br /><br />Personally, a few years ago I used Eileen Colligan (Greenwich Village) but truth be told, she is NOT for everyone. Read the reviews to see why.&nbsp; <br />Good luck!<br /><br />http://www.mdinfocentral.com/mdinfo/Redirector?LAST_NAME=&amp;FIRST_NAME=&amp;SPECIALTY=24&amp;GENDER=NONE&amp;REGION=100&amp;LANGUAGE=-1&amp;ACTIVE_ONLY=&amp;SORT_BY=7&amp;SORT_ORDER_ASC=false&amp;PAGE_NUMBER=1&amp;ActionID=DoctorSearch&amp;target_doctorSearchResults=&amp;x=21&amp;y=11<br /><br /><br />http://www.mdinfocentral.com/mdinfo/Redirector?LAST_NAME=&amp;FIRST_NAME=&amp;SPECIALTY=24&amp;GENDER=NONE&amp;REGION=140&amp;LANGUAGE=-1&amp;ACTIVE_ONLY=&amp;SORT_BY=7&amp;SORT_ORDER_ASC=false&amp;PAGE_NUMBER=1&amp;ActionID=DoctorSearch&amp;target_doctorSearchResults=&amp;x=24&amp;y=15<br /><br />The links are long, sorry I donâ€™t know how to make them shorter.<br /><br />

				Is Gastrointernest a fancy way they say Proctologist nowadays?&nbsp; &nbsp; The ASSMAN (Sienfeld fans know him)&nbsp; was supposedly the best. :-D<br /><br /><br /><br />I had to take an elderly reletive to sea proctologist 3 years ago, went to guy on 31st avenue. I thingk she had hemmeroids, but could not find out exactly, she is old, and embarressed talking to a male about that.&nbsp; &nbsp;So I take her, and all guy wants to do is send her for expensive tests, one which involved anastesia.&nbsp; &nbsp; She was mad that he barley examined her.&nbsp; &nbsp;So I called Lenox Hill in Manhattan, and was lucky enough to get&nbsp; refereals, and was lucky enough to get receptionist who was good, understood situation, and sent her to proctologist (or gastro if you prefer) who was not afraid to look up her...<br /><br />Problem solved.&nbsp; She just had a blister from sitting too much, some cream cured it.&nbsp; No expensive tests, no anastesia.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just her telling me how embarresed she was for me to know about it.&nbsp; She was in 80&#039;s, different era.<br /><br />If problem is stomach, or intestinal, then naturaly go with the tests of course.

				I think a proctologist is now called a rectal or colorectal surgeon.<br /><br />Gastroenterologist or GI is someone who deals with the entire digestive system, so all the way from esophagus to almost the end where proctologist would take over. I think that is the difference between the two but don&#039;t quote me on it. <br />

				I have the same Aetna plan and I know you can search based on zip code, hospital affiliation,etc. <br /><br />I&#039;ve done what the above poster suggested - I needed a pulmonary specialist and wanted one with<br />NYU Medical Center. I searched based on that criteria, got a slew of names and&nbsp; my doctor actually<br />knew 6 of them. <br /><br />But most docs now seem to have banker&#039;s hours. The only time I&#039;ve had a doc take weekend appointments<br />were local ones here in Astoria. Sometimes though, if you get a nice receptionist, you might talk them into<br />an early morning or 5:30-ish appointment. <br /><br />Good luck.
