				Today I was walking down 31st Ave from 31st Street, headed towards 36th Street.&nbsp; I was on the South side of 31st Ave.&nbsp; Maybe around 33rd Street, I looked to the right and on that side street...whether it was 33rd or 34th Street?.... on the left side of the street (or the East side) I could see a charming restaurant just beyond the corner of 31st Ave....looked a teeny bit upscale...had outdoor seating....I think a dark green awning...and I tried to look at the name (but had no pen or phone on me to write it down).&nbsp; I think it was Italian?....maybe something like Gallino?...maybe started with a &quot;G&quot;?&nbsp; ;-)<br /><br />Any ideas?<br /><br />Tx!<br />

				I&#039;m surprised by negative comments as well. I love Cafe Bugatti.&nbsp; Every single item I&#039;ve had has been absolutely delicious.&nbsp; I most often get the special of the night.&nbsp; We also do a lot of take out from there.&nbsp; The owner and staff couldn&#039;t be more friendly and accomodating.&nbsp; I can&#039;t say enough about the place.&nbsp; One of my favorites in Astoria.

				The first time I went, I had an excellent meal.&nbsp; The second time, we had weird server issues, especially after they found out that we had a Groupon.&nbsp; There are so many Italian restaurants in the neighborhood, including the new one on Broadway, that I don&#039;t feel the need to go back.

				The Groupon complaint is a recurring theme in reviews of this place - reports of smaller portions and lesser treatment.<br /><br />Even though that clearly should never be the case, I have avoided Groupon for that very reason - I just keep hearing similar stories over and over for a variety of restaurants, in Astoria and Manhattan<br />

				I don&#039;t remember the first time we went, but I do remember that it was just ok.&nbsp; The second (last) time was the most bizarre restaurant experience I&#039;ve ever had.&nbsp; Our server asked us what drinks we wanted before we even had our jackets off, or giving us the wine list.&nbsp; Then we had to ask for bread.&nbsp; Then it took forever for him to take our order.&nbsp; That all is forgivable, but we ordered a $14 shrimp &amp; risotto and it came with FOUR overcooked (charred) shrimp and the risotto was gross.&nbsp; I also ordered an endive/beet salad and the endives were soft and browning at the edges.&nbsp; I don&#039;t even remember what my companion ordered, but it was lame.&nbsp; They were also blasting some really terrible music.&nbsp; There&#039;s more that was wrong, I just can&#039;t remember it (or am repressing it).<br />

				We&#039;ve only been once, not too long after it opened, but it was such a bizarre server experience that I would be very reluctant to ever go back.&nbsp; There was no one to complain to, since our server made sure we knew he was the restaurant manager, too.&nbsp; We had been waiting for our table at the bar area, perusing menus while we waited.&nbsp; When we were seated at our table, they never brought the menus over - and we could NOT get someone&#039;s attention to get menus.&nbsp; We waited 10 or 15 minutes before succeeding in getting our menus back.&nbsp; We asked for a beer list, only to be told that they didn&#039;t really serve beer, but if we wanted, we could have Heineken from the staff fridge.&nbsp; Then, when the server brought lamb chops we had ordered medium-rare, he announced as he was setting them down in front of us, &quot;these are overcooked.&quot;&nbsp; First, if they knew they were overcooked before the left the kitchen, they never should have left the kitchen.&nbsp; But failing that, there was not even an offer to redo them.&nbsp; Yes, we could have refused them or asked them to be redone, but we were already late for another event that night and didn&#039;t have time.&nbsp; I&#039;d never, ever been told in a restaurant that the food was improperly cooked but still served it!
