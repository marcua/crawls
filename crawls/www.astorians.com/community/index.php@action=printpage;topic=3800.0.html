				Okay so despite my landlord helpfully labeling this a &quot;NO MENUS&quot; building, I keep getting menus shoved under my door by enterprising delivery men, no doubt.<br /><br />Now on a normal week when I have free time it&#39;s not a big problem, but this week I&#39;ve barely had time to come home, sleep, make breakfast and head back out, and they&#39;ve piled up.&nbsp; My entryway is a mess and I&#39;m quite frankly annoyed.<br /><br />Should I put a sign down there on my door?&nbsp; I was thinking along the theme of &quot;NO MENUS.&nbsp; STICK A MENU UNDER HERE AND YOU WILL BE BOYCOTTED BY THIS APARTMENT.&nbsp; LITTER AT YOUR OWN RISK&quot;.<br /><br />Thoughts?&nbsp; Anybody else absolutely hate getting &quot;junk mail&quot; from these places?&nbsp; If I want your menu, I&#39;ll pick it up when I pass by your restaurant.&nbsp; Don&#39;t clutter up my apartment on the inside.&nbsp; <br /><br />I mean, it&#39;s enough of a mess already.

				Like noise, litter, and graffiti, there is absolutely nothing you can do about it. Everyone has been aware of this problem for years and outside of the odd attention grabbing headline, nothing changes. <br /><br />Ever.<br /><br />This is another of those chronic problems we all complain about that don&#39;t seem to get much attention from the powers that be .... <br /><br />... unless, of course, you wanted to put up a building, well, then everyone would line up to &#39;help&#39; and the machinery of the city would be at your disposal.

				I see the &quot;No Menus&quot; signs up all the time, but they never seem to have any impact.&nbsp; Do you know for certain the delivery people read English?&nbsp; I know in Manhattan they had the signs in multiple languages to try and get the point across.&nbsp; I had a guy hand me a menu on the sidewalk the other day - no, really, I&#39;m in a rush, this is a bad time.&nbsp; What was he thinking?&nbsp; In the middle of a residential block, blocking the sidewalk.

				I think I read about someone in Philly who accumulated stacks of menus from one particular restaurant then &quot;redelivered&quot; them to their restaurant of origin in a none-too-tidy manner.&nbsp; She might have got fined for littering or maybe her case was thrown out, I&#39;m not sure.&nbsp; But it must have been very satisfying.

				My house put up a big all caps no soliciting sign in 2 places near the door.&nbsp; It is ignored for the most part.&nbsp; Sometimes I save the menus sometimes I don&#39;t.&nbsp; I just wish they would be neater about it, instead of throwing them on the floor.

				Most of the delivery guys arent fluent in English and besides their boss tells them to do it.&nbsp; <br /><br />How about a sign in Spanish saying whatever you want.&nbsp; At least they will understand and perhaps be scared off.<br /><br />

				Wave Thai has done it and so has the Elephant.&nbsp; They&#39;re good restaurants so I can&#39;t say I won&#39;t keep going.&nbsp; Sometimes I only find out about a restaurant from the flyers, so I can&#39;t say it&#39;s all bad.&nbsp; &nbsp;But the sheer quantity can add up especially in apartment blgs.&nbsp; And the flyers being passed out on the street always end up all over the sidewalk anyway, because people don&#39;t know how to use garbage cans.&nbsp; So I can understand the frustration.

				A few times I&#39;ve only found out about a restaurant because they handed me their menu on the street or it got slipped through the mail slot, but I do think it&#39;s silly if they keep dropping menus in the same apartments. I don&#39;t think the act of handing menus out on a residential sidewalk is a big deal.. if you&#39;re in a hurry you don&#39;t have to take one, or you can just take one as you walk by. It only starts to bug me if they&#39;re always in the same place and do it all the time. Are there any specific places you&#39;re referring to with making menus pile up in your doorway?

				Fresco Tortilla Taco is a big offender.&nbsp; So is some sushi place - I don&#39;t really eat much sushi so I don&#39;t pay attention, but I feel like I&#39;ve thrown the same menu out about eight times now.

				if the biggest offenders were to receive oh.... 1000 or 100 notes shoved under their door and put on their counter and left on their answering machines... from some 1000 or 100 members of a local group (like Astorians maybe)... perhaps they might chill a little bit.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know how many people they would need to hear from... but they don&#39;t want to piss off their customers.... <br /><br />so pick a restaurant.... let us know... and maybe it&#39;s time to start an anti flyer campaign.&nbsp; <br />

				Nice idea, but it will not work. Like advocates of guns who hide behind the Bill of Rights, this litter that masquerades as advertising is a &quot;freedom of speech&quot; issue. Recall newspaper articles going back several decades on this problem. <br /><br />As said before, nothing ever gets done.<br /><br />In NYC everything is geared to commercial interests. If you open a McDonalds, you get a traffic light. If you complain that a crossing is dangerous, nothing happens until a kid gets run over. If you a fighting noise from a cafe, or a builder who bricks up your windows, you will almost always lose. <br /><br />Apathy from our leadership and stubborn bureaucracy from the city is honed to wear you down every time. Every rare victory that you read about is eclipsed by a torrent of unsung failures.&nbsp; <br /><br />Someone has to ask our leadership why, despite all our glaring problems that the posters on this board notice, nothing gets done (except the odd reassuring headline). As long as our community is shy in taking its leadership to task, nothing, I repeat, nothing will ever change.<br /><br />And these problems are just getting worse and worse with each passing season. Recall a quote from Ovid, &quot;add little to little and soon you have a great pile.&quot;

				Anyone bothered by this should simply relocate the offerings to an area of the lobby where everyone has access. Of course, those who are interested will take from the pile and those who are not will leave the items in place. Eventually, this will become an issue for the landlord to deal with.
