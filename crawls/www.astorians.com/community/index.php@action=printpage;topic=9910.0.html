				Hi new to the site but would love to pick people&#039;s brains here. Does anyone know of a tennis pro that gives lessons at the astoria park courts? I&#039;m a beginner and I would like to at least be good enough to show up at the park and ask random people to play with. Tennis would be a good way to meet people in astoria, wouldn&#039;t it? So if you know of any instructors that would be nice and not cost too much I would love to know their information. I have no idea how much it would cost anyway- so that might be a good thing to tell me. Thanks so much for your help! Maybe I&#039;ll see you on the courts after I learn how not to suck. :-)

				Hi Suzykins,<br />Wilson Morales has been teaching tennis at Astoria Park for 20+ years.&nbsp; My daughter and I took lessons from him last summer and he&#039;s a great teacher for beginners.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know exactly when he starts back up in the spring, but his phone # is 646-552-9692.&nbsp;

				I did this last year.&nbsp; Think I paid $500 for 15 one hour private lessons.&nbsp; That&#039;s about $33 per lesson.&nbsp; Awesome price for what you get.&nbsp; He will also help you meet up with other similar skilled students for practice and will even have them share a lesson with you to work on partner skills.&nbsp; Really can&#039;t recommend him enough.&nbsp; Go talk with him in person and let him test you out and go from there.<br /><br />Good luck and let me know if you want to practice sometime.

				I took lessons from Wilson Morales as well and he&#039;s great. He&#039;s like the Mr. Miagi of tennis instruction. If you&#039;re looking to learn the basics, he&#039;s the guy. His friend Mo, this moroccan pro, is younger, with the same skill level. It depends what you want. I&#039;d interview both.<br /><br />Btw, I&#039;m looking to get a tennis network started, so spread the word....

				Mr. Wilson Morales has left Astoria Park for good.&nbsp; Now I hire Yoshi as my hitting partner and instructor.&nbsp; Yoshi has been the tennis racket stringer for Wilson&#039;s clients for the last 3 years.&nbsp; He is also a certified tennis pro with several years of teaching experiences.&nbsp; I wanted to work on my consistency on ground strokes, and he was just perfect for that.&nbsp; He hit all the balls back to you. He charged me only $25 for one hour hitting session.&nbsp; &nbsp;I highly recommend him.&nbsp; Just in case, you want to contact him, his # is 718-777-7555 and email is tennisastoria@gmail.com<br /><br />Enjoy the game of tennis!<br /><br />jeff

				Hey people,<br /><br />It&#039;ll be only my second time to play tennis at Astoria Park. I&#039;ve played less than a handful of times in the past 12 years, but I used to be a nationally ranked junior from Texas. Depending on how I fare (I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll be fine), I might be up for giving some super cheap lessons mostly for fun than anything else. Will keep everyone posted.

				All the luck to you riteus! Atleast you won&#039;t have to hear an earful if you give a lesson at the park now that Se√±or Morales is no longer with us. But, be careful because if I&#039;m not mistaken BumbleBee Tennis or whatever they&#039;re called is scheduled to take over.<br />I hope your prices are competitive and you make a killing this summer! :mrgreen:

				Haha, I won&#039;t be looking to make a killing. As I said, it&#039;ll be more for fun than anything else. Plus, I&#039;m now much older and 20lbs overweight. I look to get some exercise and maybe use the proceeds to purchase some balls and a ball hopper, strings, maybe a new racket, etc. Nothing fancy going on here.

				Well, I got to hit yesterday afterall. I&#039;m a bit sore today but have lined up another hitting partner this afternoon. Am excited about that.<br /><br />I still &quot;got it&quot; in terms of muscle memory and strokes, but man, I got a little more tired than I thought I would have. And my footwork needs work as I find myself to be lazier than I should be. It&#039;s times like these when I get nostalgic and remember how much of an exercise machine I once was.&nbsp; Alas, no longer...<br /><br />I wanted to take today off and rest these aching muscles but when somebody txt&#039;d me today I immediately and emphatically responded &quot;YES!&quot; I wonder if I bit off more than I can chew...
