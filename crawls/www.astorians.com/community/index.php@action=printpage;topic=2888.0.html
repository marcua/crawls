				I find that when I tell people I live in Astoria, I often get the reaction &quot;Oh that&#39;s where all the yuppies are moving.&quot;&nbsp; I have been here 6 years, and I haven&#39;t really noticed many &quot;yuppies.&quot;&nbsp; I find Astoria to be a very diverse place.&nbsp; There are many rent stablized apts and there are also expensive apts.&nbsp; From what I can tell, many people in the expensive apts actually have roomates.&nbsp; I see mostly working class people and some middle class people.&nbsp; I just haven&#39;t seen many yuppies.&nbsp; I wonder why this perception exists about Astoria.&nbsp; &nbsp;Have you heard this before?&nbsp; Do you agree or disagree.&nbsp; If you disagree like me, why do you think this perception about yuppies in Astoria exists?&nbsp;

				I think new groups come into Astoria all of the time but because it&#39;s so wonderfully diverse it can never be overwhelmed by one group.&nbsp; There may be more yuppies, hipsters, gays, milkmen, etc. every year but it would take a lot to really change the population--basically because <em>everyone</em> is here.&nbsp; I think it&#39;s awesome to live in a neighborhood where noone looks out of place.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />Emily

				^I agree with you.&nbsp; I feel like I see more and more young people out on the streets.&nbsp; Nobody is really out of place (well, except if you don&#39;t speak Greek), however, for the most part, my Manhattan and Brooklyn friends still don&#39;t feel compelled to visit the forgotten borough of Queens&nbsp; :-(

				Words like &quot;yuppie&quot;, &quot;hipster&quot;, etc.&nbsp; Are all sort of vague, really.&nbsp; Technically, I suppose I&#39;m a yuppie, since that&#39;s a &quot;young urban professional&quot;.&nbsp; At 34, I hope I still qualify as young.&nbsp; My wife teaches at Tisch at NYU and lots of the graduating students are looking to move to Astoria/LIC.&nbsp; The neighborhood might not be filled with.... let&#39;s just go with &quot;young people&quot;... right now, but they&#39;re coming.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to take away from the diversity of the neighborhood.&nbsp; The families that have been here for years ain&#39;t goin&#39; no where, the percentages just might change a bit.

				Funny that this should be brought up-when I was looking for a place, my realtor said exactly that, and that Astoria was the up and coming, trendy area for young professionals.<br />That was the first that I had heard of it-I moved here because of the comfort of the neighborhood,&nbsp; diversity (and yes, I speak Greek) and proximity to to midtown by train.<br />I find it very interesting, but not trendy.

				They&#39;ve been saying Astoria&#39;s up and coming, trendy, etc.&nbsp; for about 5/6 years now.&nbsp; Astoria&#39;s been stubborn though, and thankfully hasn&#39;t turned into another Williamsburg yet.&nbsp; I like the diversity here, and the home-town feel, and I hope it stays that way for a long time to come.&nbsp; &nbsp; For a long time even the rents held on, but that&#39;s been changing.&nbsp; The last 2 years have seen a significant increase in rents, and the arrival of chain restaurants and stores.&nbsp; I assume that many locals looking to open their own&nbsp; businesses will find it hard to afford the rents, which is probably why the chains so easily get the storefronts.&nbsp; I do like that astoria is more popular now, i just wish that this whole yuppification/gentrification/whatever process didn&#39;t push everyone else out, because usually the rents and prices in the area for food/etc. just rise too much and things just aren&#39;t affordable anymore.&nbsp; &nbsp;I specifically cannot afford Brooklyn which is why I&#39;ve always stayed on in Astoria.&nbsp; I&#39;ve come to love it though and can&#39;t imagine leaving now.<br /><br />And prime example of rising prices:&nbsp; Beer Garden is now officially $14 per pitcher, and overly crowded every weekend.&nbsp; &nbsp;I remember when those pitchers were $10, and when it was actually a relaxing way to spend your evening.&nbsp; We&#39;re apparently trendy enough for non-Astoria folk to come here on a regular basis.&nbsp;

				I think the upward trend is really obvious east of Steinway and Broadway. &nbsp;In the past few years more bars and restaurants have opened. &nbsp;Some are obviously geared towards certain communities (like Albona is frequented by some flavor of former Yugoslavian) but others seems geared towards new residents such as Le Sans Souci (a French Bistro w/ Garden) or Thai Chili, now under it&#39;s second or third management and doing well. &nbsp;Or how about the quite popular Dandanna Egyptian Cafe right on my block! &nbsp;And accross the street the Greek Social club has been replaced by an Acupuncture Clinic.<br /><br />The tenants in my building have gotten much younger too. &nbsp;When my neighbors who had been in their place since the early &#39;60s moved to the Long Island I tried to convince them to keep quiet and let me pay their rent ($300 for a 2 bedroom!) &nbsp;They didn&#39;t go for it &amp; the place was gutted, turned into a 3 bedroom (and let me tell you, those bedrooms are tiny) and rents for about $1700 now. &nbsp;last time around the Leases all had riders stating that preferential rent would now longer be given.<br /><br />I don&#39;t think the upward pressure is that severe yet though. &nbsp;I posted before about an attempt to raise rent way up in one unit. &nbsp;It turns out the increase was the difference between preferential and the &#39;rent stabilized&#39; rent. &nbsp;When the tenant decided they weren&#39;t having the rent increase they went ahead and found something in Spanish Harlem and gave notice. &nbsp;In the meantime the owner has come back with offers that split the difference. &nbsp;So there is still some hope!<br /><br />

				I can&#39;t say that i&#39;ve heard anything about Astoria other than its rich diversity. I avoid using the word &quot;gentrification&quot; because to me it seems to equal &quot;upper middle class white folk pushing everyone else out.&quot; I think it&#39;s a dirty unfair word.

				My friend&#39;s mother lives in a rent-controlled (not rent-stabilised) apartment in Clinton Hill, and has been there since 1968.&nbsp; Her rent is $150/month.<br /><br />According to the NYC Rent Guidelines Board (http://www.housingnyc.com), the maximum change per every two years for a rent-controlled apartment is still 7.5%, according to the Fact Sheet #1: Rent Control and Rent Stabilization (http://www.housingnyc.com/html/resources/dhcr/dhcr1.html); however, that 7.5% raise is only up to the Maximum Base Rent limit.&nbsp; The Maximum Base Rent Program that is used to calculate rent-controlled rents is explained in Fact Sheet #22 (http://www.housingnyc.com/html/resources/dhcr/dhcr22.html).<br /><br />In general, that website has a lot of good information, although it can be a bit tricky to navigate.&nbsp; There&#39;s even a stabilised building list by zip code (http://www.housingnyc.com/html/resources/zip.html), although the site warns it is not complete.

				I love it here and I&#39;m glad it hasn&#39;t changed quickly, but I&#39;m still puzzled when people say to me oh Astoria is where the yuppies live.&nbsp; I guess when I think of yuppie... I don&#39;t just think of young professional but I think of people who are also very well off financially.&nbsp; I more see middle income (who may be professionals) and working class people.&nbsp; Maybe of notion of who is well off financially has changed. I still wonder where this idea comes from that this is where the yuppies have moved to.&nbsp; I think they move to Park Slope, Manhattan, Forest Hills, Greenpoint, Williamsburgh, etc more than here.&nbsp; I agree with what a lot of you have said.&nbsp; I&#39;ve heard Astoria is up and coming too.&nbsp; I&#39;m glad that&#39;s going very slowly.&nbsp; I hope it doesn&#39;t turn into Williamsburgh.

				I come from a middle working class neighborhood in CT (yes, they do exist, I&#39;m from Bridgeport), and one of the reasons I moved here is because it reminded me of my neighborhood back home, so I knew I&#39;d be comfortable here. I&#39;ve been here a year next week, and I wasn&#39;t wrong :)

				Jane, what you may be seenig is the roots of gentrification, because it surely is happening here.&nbsp; I wouldn&#39;t use a silly term like &quot;yuppies&quot; -- but it surely isn&#39;t working-class folk moving in here when studio apartments are going for upwards of $800.<br /><br />I got a bad jolt the other day by using one of those real-estate appraisal websites, which shows housing prices for any given street address.&nbsp; I typed in my address, and on my block, which is all &quot;two story with a basement&quot; rowhouses, the average price of a house is $750,000.&nbsp; Back in 1995, a friend of mine bought a house just north of Astoria Boulevard for $150,000.&nbsp; In the past decade housing and rental costs have gone through the roof here.&nbsp; Again, back in mid-90s, I had friends here renting two-bedroom apartments for $800 -- this was the going rate for a long time.&nbsp; My first apartment, in 1997, was a one bedroom near 23rd and Ditmars for $600/month.<br /><br />You&#39;re going to continue seeing plenty of working-class folks for awhile, as many of them are lucky enough to own the houses they live in.&nbsp; But as time goes on, you&#39;re going to notice more and more younger professional white folks moving in -- I&#39;ve noticed it a lot in the past five years, and a radical change in the type of stores/restaurants/bars that are moving in.&nbsp; Places like 718, or even a Starbucks, wouldn&#39;t have existed here 10 years ago.<br /><br />I remember a few years back, when that worker got shot in the Trade Fair supermarket, there was a hue and cry in the neighborhood that this happened &quot;because all of those people from Manhattan are moving in here.&quot;&nbsp; I had a few neighbors express that sentiment and read it in a few of the news stories at that time.&nbsp; (Turns out one of his ex-coworkers was doing a simple robbery, and he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.)<br /><br />It&#39;s instructive to look at places like Park Slope and Williamsburg.&nbsp; A friend grew up in Park Slope in the early 70s -- it was basically a gritty, crime-ridden neighborhood.&nbsp; Fast forward to the mid-80s, when that neighborhood really caught on, and he couldn&#39;t afford to live there anymore.&nbsp; I remember Williamsburg in the late 80s and early 90s -- it was a ragged little Polish neighborhood, rough-edged to say the least.&nbsp; Now?&nbsp; I couldn&#39;t afford a closet there.<br /><br />Gentrification rarely happens overnight -- it generally takes a decade or so to truly kick in.&nbsp; Real estate prices skyrocket, and only people willing to pay very high rents start moving in.&nbsp; Businesses spring up to cater to these new crowds.&nbsp; As real estate goes up, people with homes, especially older people, consider selling them -- which is a no-brainer when you buy a house in 1968 for $35K and someone offers to buy it in 2006 for $700K.&nbsp; You&#39;ll have a core working-class neighborhood for awhile, but by simple attrition, this will whittle down over the course of years.&nbsp; Next time you&#39;re in Park Slope, walk around and realize that in 1975, that area was a hard inner-city neighborhood.<br /><br />I think when you hear people saying stuff like &quot;all the yuppies are moving here,&quot; they&#39;re telling you that the people they know who are moving here do, indeed, have money to burn and are quoting rents that may appear good to (insane) Manhattanites, but are far above the neighborhood standard -- much more than the people already here are paying.&nbsp; And a depressing glance at any bulletin board in a real estate agency window verifies that.<br /><br />Will the oncoming national real-estate slow down affect this?&nbsp; Christ, I hope so.&nbsp; But I would be surprised if it wiped out the boom completely.&nbsp; From what I&#39;ve seen, gentrification works over the course of years in any given neighborhood, it&#39;s not an overnight transformation.&nbsp; And it&#39;s surely happening here, for better or worse!

				I would not call rents reasonable here.&nbsp; Maybe compared to Brooklyn or Manhattan, but considering it used to be easy to find a one-bedroom here for $950 and now it&#39;s closer to $1200, well that&#39;s not reasonable to me.&nbsp; I suppose if you want a 2/3bedroom for 1600 and then split it which is what most people here do, then yeah, it&#39;s better than Manhattan.&nbsp; But for lower-to middle working families and people who would like to live on their own, no, not reasonable.&nbsp; I&#39;ve seen many a family with at least one kid in the realtors office looking for a one-bedroom, because they can&#39;t afford anything else here.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can get steals but I would say they are few and far in-between.<br /><br />But welcome to Astoria.&nbsp; The neighborhood feel is particularily why I like it so much here.&nbsp; :-)
