				I know this isn&#039;t in Astoria but this organization really got to me.&nbsp; Not only do they find forever homes for puppies and dogs but they provide a hospice for those dogs that are too ill for anyone to want them.&nbsp; If you go to their website and read the stories you will see.<br /><br />Why am I doing this?&nbsp; Because there are many organization that save these little guys and do a wonderful job in fostering them and eventually finding them forever families but there are very few organization that have an onboard hospice and take on the responsibility of taking care of these poor dogs that have either been abandoned because their owners found it&#039;s too expensive to keep them, or left out in the street, or placed in a shelter to be killed.&nbsp; <br /><br />This organization gives these animals a second chance and for those too far gone, at least their days left on this earth is filled with love and they&#039;re cared for.&nbsp; Just because they&#039;re animals doesn&#039;t mean they don&#039;t deserve a second chance or to die in a humane way.&nbsp; No creature, whether it be human, canine, feline, whatever should be left to die alone.<br /><br />A small donation, even if it&#039;s $5.00 anything would help for them to continue caring for these hospice dogs and take on more.<br /><br />I know these are tough times, but because of these tough times these guys depend on us, they can&#039;t get jobs even when the jobs start coming back, they totally depend on us.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the link, please find a place in your heart to donate something http://www.lffrescue.com/hospicedogs.htm (http://www.lffrescue.com/hospicedogs.htm)<br /><br />Here&#039;s one of their Hospice Dogs<br /><br />TWINKLES<br />Twinkles was on the euthanasia list in a NYC shelter.&nbsp; She has a slipped disc whihc does not allow her to walk on her hind legs.&nbsp; This was an old injury that could no longer be surgically repaired.&nbsp; Twinkles is a loving 7 year old pekingese who needs her bladder expressed on a daily basis.<br />

				This one touched my heart.&nbsp; Someone very dear to me (Human) in his senior years had to have a colostomy bag, he was in so much pain, and so much discomfort ... but he could talk, he could pick up a phone and call someone, he could call for help.&nbsp; This little guy can&#039;t do that, I can just imagine what it must be like.&nbsp; Thank God for good people that choose to dedicate their life to taking care of these innocent babies (even when their old, they&#039;re still babies).&nbsp; I know quite a few people here that have pets and those pets are so fortunate to have mommys and/or daddy&#039;s take care of them, I know one person in particular that does everything she can to take care of her babies.&nbsp; Some are not so lucky.<br /><br />Call me a sentimental mush but when I read these stories I cried my eyes out and just donated&nbsp; :cry:.&nbsp; Even though I&#039;ve been laid off for two months now I still dug into my pocket and gave something, not much but something and since I can&#039;t give more financially I&#039;m doing the next best thing and that is spreading the word.<br /><br />Please moderators don&#039;t get angry at me, but this broke my heart and I know there are a lot of caring people here.<br /><br />Thank you all for taking the time to read this and going to the site.<br /><br />
