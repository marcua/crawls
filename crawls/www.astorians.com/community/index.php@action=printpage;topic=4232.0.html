				I recently read this Nation article &nbsp;(http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060911/mello) about organic farming.&nbsp; I like to buy organic food for various personal reasons, some of which I&#39;m sure I share with many people reading this.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been aware that on some organic farms - usually the very large ones like Earthbound Farms - it is not the utopian atmosphere that one often associates with organic farming.&nbsp; Workers are not necessarily treated better (apart from lacking in the direct contact with pesticides, although there is pesticide drift) at some organic farms than at conventional farms.&nbsp; However, circumstances behind the treatment can be different.&nbsp; A question:&nbsp; should this matter to us as consumers?&nbsp; <br /><br />This is not to say that all workers are mistreated on organic farms.&nbsp; See Swanton Berry Farm &nbsp;(http://www.swantonberryfarm.com/) (most amazing strawberry jam I&#39;ve ever had).<br /><br />Some of us are becoming more concerned with animal treatment, perferring to buy a &quot;humanely grown&quot; chicken or beef.&nbsp; Labeling helps us in knowing how an animal was raised before slaughter.&nbsp; One suggestion in the article has to do with labeling an organic product in a similar vein, with regard to the workers.&nbsp; From the article:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In the spring of last year, researchers at the University of California published a study showing that organic farmers widely oppose requirements that they pay benefits and allow farmhands to organize. <br /><br />Nonetheless, there is a small but growing campaign, backed by some of organic agriculture&#39;s staunchest supporters, for a new kind of food labeling, one that would guarantee that food is produced in ways that benefit workers as well as the environment. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br /><br />Anyway, it was an interesting and throught-provoking article.&nbsp; I&#39;d love to know what others think, too.

				Not sure if you&#39;ve read this or know about the WorldNews series on organic farms.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=2674213&amp;page=1

				I&#39;ll check them both out - it would be nice to be able to buy organic, but also know that you&#39;re doing the right thing vis-a-vis proper treatment of the workforce.

				P.S.&nbsp; if anyone wants to go in on a case of strawberry jam from Swanton Berry Farm, let me know/PM me.&nbsp; It is so super tasty and they ship!&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)

				Sadly the thing about organic is that it isn&#39;t always sustainable - and I would think that this would include unsustainable labor practices as well. You can&#39;t always be entirely aware of farming practices, and it does seem like bigger companies like Earthbound would have less than ideal practices.<br /><br />That&#39;s why it is good to try and buy local (and in season) as much as possible, and to check with organizations like Just Food (http://www.justfood.org) to verify that local farming practices are up to par. Farm Aid (http://www.farmaid.org/) is probably another good resource (and one that I think I heard about from you Meg :)).<br /><br />What is interesting is that until a year or two ago I didn&#39;t really think about organic not always being sustainable. It adds another layer of personal challenge for me because it means that when I go to the store and look at the organic Earthbound lettuce I have to ask myself - Was this farmed satisfactorily? Should I support an organic product that traveled thousands of miles to get to me or should I try to eat a salad that was farmed closer by? And to be honest, I don&#39;t always address those things, but when I do - oh frustration ensues! :-(
