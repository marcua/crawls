				I&#039;ve been poking around on Craigslist just for fun to see what Astoria apartments are going for these days and I&#039;m pretty shocked. It seems like in the 6 months that I&#039;ve moved, prices have gone up dramatically. I am paying $1250 for a one bedroom and haven&#039;t seen anything decent under $1500..In fact, I&#039;ve barely seen any apartments under that. Maybe I was just lucky, but when I was looking over the summer, I found a lot of apartments in the $1200-$1300 range. I wanted to move again in July, but I can just imagine how much a one bedroom will be by then. I love Astoria and I know it&#039;s appeal is growing every day, but part of the appeal is affordability...and it seems like that will soon be gone.

				A lot of the postings on Craigslist are crap. There is the occasional diamond in the rough, but I found when looking for apartments on there that a lot of them are overpriced, if they are even real ads and not junk put up by brokers to get you into their office. Some brokers will tell you they don&#039;t have anything under $1400, but keep looking, and don&#039;t be afraid to try to negotiate either. I&#039;m not sure what your idea of decent is, but you can definitely find a good 1BR for under $1500.

				I dont think anyone says Astoria is affordable . Yea its a great place to live&nbsp; but its also a pretty expensive place to live when you compare it other nearby places in queens or bklyn .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Price i think are slowly going back up&nbsp; but you can still find&nbsp; a decent apt for under $1500.&nbsp; You might not get that granite kitchen or really nice hooked up bath ,&nbsp; but it all depends on what you want and can spend monthly .

				I wouldn&#039;t bother looking on Craigslist for apartments.&nbsp; Most of it is crap, Essen is right.&nbsp; It&#039;s also way too overwhelming.&nbsp; I know you may not want to, but going to a broker will probably garner more results than the internet.&nbsp; I&#039;d recommend using Metropolis Realty on 23rd Ave.&nbsp; My boyfriend worked with all the brokers there and they were all honest and hard-working - staying within his stated budget, and working with him as long as it took to find a place.

				I list all my apts on craigslist because i find that most people dont want to go thru brokers and pay a fee , esp one as expensive as the ones in Astoria .&nbsp; All my listings are true , pics are true and ive never had a problem finding a tenant .

				The 1br that was just posted for $1700 also got me thinking, WTF?! <br /><br />When I first moved to Astoria 10 years ago, it was $1000 for a 2br (that I split w/a roommate). Granted, it was FAR from fancy, but still worth renting. The town was no further from the city back then, and still had plenty of restaurant options, but many fewer choices.<br /><br />Weird how prices are still so high while the pseudo-luxury units remain overpriced and unsold....

				Yea seems kinda high for a 1 bedroom , but alot of landlords have really updated their apts knowing they can get a good extra chunk of change with Astoria being so hot now for the last couple of years . Granite kitchens ,all wooden floors and new baths will really boost up the rent .

				What is rate increase rate for apartments?&nbsp; I think a 2 year lease and a 3 year lease have different caps on how much landlord can raise everytime lease is up.&nbsp; &nbsp; Not counting those other increases they add on, MRB&#039;s, or whatever they call them.

				Joey Landlords can charge whatever they want as long as its not stabilized . If the lease ends they can up it to what amount they want , but risk losing the tenant . A good way to get someone out though .&nbsp;

I hate brokers that was my first and last experience with one.

				Yup brokers all lie . You see all those pics they show on real estate sites and you can totally see how they stretch them out to make everything look bigger .&nbsp; Now im sure some owners lie as well , but&nbsp; it seems brokers lie just to get that fee . If an owner lies he is wasting his own time and loses money along the way .
