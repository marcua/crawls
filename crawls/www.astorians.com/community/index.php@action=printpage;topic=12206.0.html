				Okay, here&#039;s the deal. I&#039;ve tried looking for jobs online for like 2 years now - nothing do. In stores, fill out applications, do this and that - and still never got any call backs :(<br /><br />It seems like every job has certain requirements which I seemingly am not qualified for. So here is a brief rundown on what I do have under my belt and my &quot;experience.&quot; Think of it as a brief summary to my resume.&nbsp; <br /><br />- Summer Volunteer Service at Mt. Sinai Hospital of Queens<br />- Summer Volunteer Service at the Salvation Army<br />- Summer Volunteer Service at Steinway Senior Center<br />- Volunteer Service at a local Pharmacy <br /><br />Like I said before, I&#039;m a college student enrolled at LIU, 20 years old. I have no criminal background. The only thing that prevents me from certain jobs like UPS and FedEx etc, is that I cannot lift any heavy packages or anything of that nature. <br /><br />If anyone knows anyone who&#039;s looking for an employee and is willing to pay at least $9 an hour . PLEASE LET ME KNOW! I am willing to travel if necessary (even to Jersey if I have to...) I am a punctual individual. All my grades are top notch. And to throw in an incentive...<br /><br /><strong>I WILL GIVE WHOEVER CAN GET ME A JOB - MY FIRST WEEK&#039;S PAYCHECK! </strong><br /><br />I&#039;d prefer a simple job/task maybe something like mailroom for an office or hotel, etc because I am also studying Pharmacy in school and don&#039;t need more stress added onto the workload. But really....anything is fine, I just need employment somewhere!<br /><br />I really need the money BADLY and don&#039;t see myself being able to live any longer without $$$. I need to pay off my bills. <br /><br />My apologies if this post seems disorganized but I really am desperate and typing this post in a haste. <br /><br />I will email my resume to whoever is interested. <br /><br />PLEASE HELP ME&nbsp; :cry:<br /><br /><br />

				Those are minimum paying jobs though. I need at least 9 bucks, maybe $8.50 an hour to get by. <br /><br />Plus, I don&#039;t think my pride will ever allow me to work there b/c of society&#039;s impression on working at fastfood restaurants. That&#039;s why I wanted a job that I can just do what I have to do and get out. <br /><br />Something in the background like a mailroom clerk or at a factory or somewhere &quot;nonpublic.&quot; Am I being to picky? I don&#039;t know....

				What hours are you available to work? <br /><br />Call some temp offices - I would call as many as I can find and try to get as many appointments lined up as possible. Wear a nice suit, paste on a smile and don&#039;t let them have any idea how desperate you are. Let them know you&#039;re very eager to find work and you are a hard worker and learn fast (assuming this is not too far from the truth). <br /><br />Then call them every morning and ask them if they have an assignment for you. <br /><br />If you want to pm me with the text of your resume, I&#039;ll look over it for you. If you want, you can X out your name, phone and address to protect your privacy.

				Have you tried anything at colleges? Look at the online employment stuff for the many colleges in the city. Since you&#039;re a college student, it&#039;s possible they might be nice to you. I dunno. I haven&#039;t had any luck with colleges myself, but it&#039;s worth a look around. Are you willing to do some basic cleaning work, provided there&#039;s no heavy lifting involved? Maybe even a cashier at Whole Foods? I know it&#039;s not &quot;nonpublic&quot; but it seems like a job that you can just do and go home without any heavy lifting, and they could probably be flexible with your college schedule. It&#039;s worth considering, since you are desperate and you&#039;ve never had a paying job before. I don&#039;t know what they pay, though.<br /><br />Staffing agencies might be able to help, too. If you want to do relatively low-paying mailroom type work, that could work to your advantage. I would guess a lot of people going into those places are looking for higher paying stuff.

				Good luck with the job search. &nbsp;I was unemployed for awhile and I know how frustrating it can be, especially when &quot;well-meaning&quot; people toss off &quot;solutions&quot; and advice.&nbsp; Which I note isn&#039;t the point of your post but which people love to give anyway.&nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps a pharmacy owner or a hotel manager or a office manager/HR manager or business owner or the like on the board will read you post and give you an interview opportunity. &nbsp;That&#039;ll be great and very community minded. &nbsp;

				Yes that would be great and I was kind of hoping that would be the case. It&#039;s getting harder and harder now to the point of excruciating. Even my own friends who are Managers and Assistant Managers for AT&amp;T on Steinway can&#039;t seem to get me a position - which makes me question our friendship in the first place...long story...Anyway...<br /><br />I&#039;ve been volunteering my services at a local Pharmacy on Steinway, which I had to pull teeth just to get. But in the long run, I figured it might as well help me and build up my resume. And they are packed with paid employees, that I would feel embarrassed to even ask to get paid. <br /><br />But with incoming bills, books to pay for and high costs of living - it&#039;s almost necessary at this point. I can&#039;t keep living off my family.

				Stop by City View Pharmacy on Astoria Boulevard between Crescent &amp; 21st and see if they have any paid positions open.<br /><br />See if LIU has tutoring center and if they can use someone with your background to help tutor other students. &nbsp;I did this quite some time ago when I was in college and earned a clean $10/hour paid through the college. &nbsp;It was also great because it was right on the campus so I would arrange hours around my classes. &nbsp;Even if LIU doesn&#039;t offer this, you might want to consider advertising tutoring services on your own...<br /><br />Lastly, minimum wage is $7.15/hour which may be less than the $8.50-$10 target you set for yourself, but if you&#039;re in a min wage job even for the short term, you&#039;d be at least earning something. &nbsp;Maybe time to get over the &#039;I need to earn...&#039; and just start getting out there &amp; earning :roll:

No student loans to cover for them and the only option left thereafter is Private Loans; which are hard to get without a cosigner.

Here&#039;s the honest truth. Some money is better than no money of course that&#039;s true but at this point in my life, I can&#039;t go to a fastfood job and throw on a cap and tee while serving food. I won&#039;t b/c my pride will never allow me to do that. <br /><br />I&#039;d prefer a suit attire job or casual wear over anything else.

I&#039;m not looking for a Class A job but I&#039;m also not looking for a low class one b/c I am majoring in a Pharmacy degree (which I may or may not transfer out of), how does it look if I&#039;m working at the Golden Arches. <br /><br />Surely someone can understand me right? <br /><br />

				When I was in college I waited tables, diapered baby butts, cleaned toilets, and worked in an un-airconditioned bakery (during the summer). It was a huge relief when I got a job at the campus library. And even better when I finally scored a summer office job (temping) that paid more than minimum wage. <br /><br />Even after graduating, I found myself sometimes doing crappy work just because it was the work that I could get when the economy tanked and I didn&#039;t have the experience on my resume to get a better job. Telemarketing, data entry ... a really hideous marketing job for Disney that involved hyping AIDA wares to theater-goers. Happily I&#039;m now in a very good job, and very happy. But until I had the degree and the experience, I had to do whatever I had to do to bring in the cash. <br /><br />Jobs have nothing to do with how good anyone is.

In college, I worked several really crappy jobs. I did manual labor; I collected garbage; I waited tables. <br /><br />If you need money and you need to support yourself, you could do a lot worse than flipping a burger. Try working for the highway department in the south in the sweltering summer. Or ditch-digging. <br /><br />While McDonald&#039;s isn&#039;t glorious, working there doesn&#039;t say anything about who you are other than the fact that you&#039;re responsible enough to accept that you need money to survive and are capable of living on your own.<br /><br />I like to think that a good deal of what little maturity (ha ha) I have comes from the fact that I&#039;ve been working since I was 11 and that a decent day&#039;s pay has never been &quot;below me&quot;, no matter the job. This work ethic has made me more valuable to my employers than my liberal arts degree has.

				You know what you guys are right....<br /><br />And as much as I&#039;d have to dread it - the reality is that those are the only jobs available for inexperienced people. <br /><br />However there is a certain etiquette I have to maintain as a Pharmacy student. I&#039;m in my 4th year (of 7 years) and the majority of the students my age already have decent jobs by now in the Pharmacy/Pharmacology field - which is my fault b/c I didn&#039;t jump on it from day 1. <br /><br />So I&#039;d be downright embarrassed if someone I knew came in and seen me. It seems silly but people talk and quite frankly I don&#039;t want to have to deal with people looking at me as an inferior person just because I&#039;m working at a fastfood chain. <br /><br />If it comes down to it - I would accept the job (money is money right?) but it would have to be isolated and as far away as possible from Astoria and BK completely.&nbsp; <br /><br />All I can ask from here on out, is that if anyone knows of any opening in an office or medical facility or any type of factory job - Please please let me know. And if you can give in the good word - I WILL gladly give you my first paycheck and treat you out to a nice meal or something (sounds like the Seinfeld episode right? lol)<br /><br />

				hello there! when i first went to college, i was a pharmacy major too! (and then i changed my major and my parents disowned me.) in between semesters i was a &#039;pharmacy tech&#039; back when you didnt need the certification. i would definitely pay the money to take the classes to be a pharmacy tech. it pays well, and it gives you experience of being in a retail pharmacy, and you can schmooze with the pharmacist.<br /><br />private loans-- be careful. after 4&nbsp; years of undergrad, and 2 years of masters work in my field, i&#039;m neck deep in private loan bills. you are SMART for trying to pay off your tuition now rather than taking loans. keep your chin up. i hope it works out! you wont regret it when you get your first Pharm D. job!!!

				Not sure if they are currently hiring but it wouldn&#039;t hurt to check with the CVS and Rite Aid at the Ditmars stop.&nbsp; Sure it&#039;s a bit of a commute since it appears you live around 35th Ave (based on an earlier post) but I feel like I saw a &quot;now hiring&quot; sign there recently.&nbsp; Even working checkout at a place like that at least gets your foot in the door for when there is an opening in the pharmacy.<br /><br />Good luck with your search!

				Hey Scribbles, <br />I just searched in craigslist for pharmacy and there are quite a few job listings for counter/sales/reception/etc on there right now....even a few small family run places. It might be worth a look. Also, the person who said CVS is hiring was correct. It seems they are having a recruiting open house...info also on Craigslist.<br /><br />Good luck!

				People are telling you where to look, but nobody is really telling you how to get the job.&nbsp; Sometimes it&#039;s hard to get a meaningless part-time job while you&#039;re in college--I&#039;m sure most of us have been there!&nbsp; Just last summer, I graduated with a master&#039;s degree and needed something before my full-time job started and had trouble finding it.<br /><br />So, here is an idea:&nbsp; Go to Queens Center Mall.&nbsp; Now is the time that they should be hiring holiday help.&nbsp; Most places are probably accepting applications, and employees are colecting them, but you need to take the extra step.&nbsp; Ask to speak to the manager and hand it personally to them and ask interested-sounding questions (do not ask about things like time off until you get the job!)&nbsp; If they don&#039;t set up an interview on the spot, or there is not a manager available at the time, ask when the manager will be there and go back in a few days to follow up on the status of your application.&nbsp; When you go in there every time, dress nicely.&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying to run around the mall in suit, but maybe wear a nice pair of black pants, nice shoes and a nice sweater.&nbsp; Oh, and be sure to come there prepared.&nbsp; You know that there will be questions on the applications about references, former jobs, etc., so be sure to have those references, addresses and phone numbers with you when you come.&nbsp; If you have that resume, it couldn&#039;t hurt to bring it.<br /><br />And as said above, don&#039;t give out your first paycheck!&nbsp; You need the money.&nbsp; And don&#039;t waste your time commuting out to Jersey for a job, because if you&#039;re not making that much, it is not worth the time and expense to get there.<br /><br />Good Luck!

				Noone told you the most important thing: lie. Not on your experience or skills, etc., but on the fact that you don&#039;t plan on working at said gas station/restaurant/pharmacy/department store/etc. for the rest of your life. They&#039;re more likely to hire you if they believe (regardless of the truth) that you&#039;re going to stick around for awhile. And don&#039;t worry, they won&#039;t cry when you tell them you&#039;re leaving. Trust me. Just make sure you give them the appropriate two weeks notice.<br /><br />Other people on here might try to tell you that if you&#039;re honest about not planning on staying at said crappy job for the long-term the manager or person doing the hiring will appreciate the honesty and still give you the job. While this is true in rare situations (when the manager is desperate), the vast majority of the time the manager will have several other candidates they believe will stick around longer and will give them the job as opposed to you.
