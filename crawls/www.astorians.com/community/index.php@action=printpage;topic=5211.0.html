But the State of New York is telling many of us that our love doesn’t count.<br /><br />Across New York , lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender couples in loving, committed relationships are being denied the same fundamental protections that heterosexual couples receive from the government through marriage.<br /><br />The time has come to put an end to this discrimination once and for all.<br /><br />Now that the new legislative session in Albany is underway, we must push our representatives to pass legislation that makes New York ’s marriage laws truly fair.<br /><br />Take a few minutes this Valentine’s Day to email your representatives in Albany urging them to end the discrimination.<br /><br /><strong>Because all New Yorkers should have access to the same protections of marriage – no matter whom they love.&quot;</strong><br /><br />Please contact your lawmakers today!<br /><br />http://www.nyclu.org/<br /><br />http://ga1.org/campaign/MarriageEquality<br /><br /><br />

				Thank you for posting this.&nbsp; If I were straight then I probably would have been married. <br />But I&#39;m not and we weren&#39;t. And really, what&#39;s a domestic partnership? And he never bothered with a will. My family accepted him/us, but his side didn&#39;t. Then the worse case scenario happened: He had the aneurism and died.&nbsp;

				yes, indeed. but if i&#39;m able to help one person/couple alleviate that drama/stress from their life, it&#39;s worth it then to tell people about what has happpened. not to sensationalize it, but to use the experience as a tool.

				Govt. should not be involved in marriage. We got our certificate from the state but our non-religious/non-authoritarian ceremony was more meaningful to me than the piece of paper. Our anniversary is not the state&#39;s but our own. I&#39;m sorry about your partner and your sadness right now. I imagine you really encourage people to do living wills and power of attorney/executor? I think if I were gay, the most important issues would be to be recognized as a couple for reasons of health/money/and children.
