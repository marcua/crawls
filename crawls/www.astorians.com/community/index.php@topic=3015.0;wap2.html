			Fine, I admit it.&nbsp; I was peer-pressured into seeing the premiere 10PM showing last night.&nbsp; And yes, it&#39;s just snakes that are on an airplane.<br /><br />

			This is about the dumbest idea I&#39;ve ever heard of for a movie.&nbsp; <br /><br />But is that why people will go see it?

			well, to be honest - when that above picture (in my first post, if it&#39;s loading) was circulating, with blatantly fake/rubber snakes, I felt like it was a must-see.&nbsp; but, unfortunately, there&#39;s simply tons of CG-generated snakes, and it&#39;s a tough film to watch close to 100% sober.

			Hell, you couldn&#39;t make me watch it even if I was blowing a 3.5 on the breathalyzer!
