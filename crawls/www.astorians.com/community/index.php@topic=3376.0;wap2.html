			The day after Primary Day, looking to start with a forward look to baseball playoffs!<br />It is September which ideally should mean October is coming with shining moments by Jeter.<br /><br />A number of NYers could win special prizes, but none of them matter as much as winning the World Series.<br /><br />Glad to hear from the Coach that Melky Cabrera will have his trust in the playoffs.<br />Matsui comes back, was he really hurt?, gets 4 hits.<br />Welcome back Godzilla.<br /><br />Thanks Moose for getting the job done.<br /><br />Welcome Boston soon to the stadium; enjoy the off-season in a few days.<br />Play ball.<br />&nbsp;:-D

			Really hoping Wang will show some more mastery this evening.<br />(got that telly)<br /><br />Getting close to a cy young year for him.<br />And Yanks are heading towards 90+ wins.
