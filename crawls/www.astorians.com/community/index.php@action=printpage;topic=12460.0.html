				<br />McD, how is this election looking for you?<br />Any special results and campaign promises that you might be following?

				I think it&#039;s looking great, personally.<br /><br />I predict a big Obama win, as well as a Democratic take-over of the State Senate.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been spending my time working on Joe Addabbo&#039;s campaign for State Senate, and I feel confident.<br /><br />Any races other people are following?<br /><br />I especially hope Saxby Chambliss loses his US Senate Seat down in GA.

				Would a change of NY Senate make the Assembly perform better as well?<br />If yes, how about some Brennan reforms.<br /><br />I am curious who will be Senator in NC and MN, AK,... However, I hope Dems will not have a filibuster proof 60.<br />49-59 would be just fine.<br /><br />http://www.progressivepatriotsfund.com/<br /><br /><br />http://www.progressivepatriotsfund.com/candidates/<br /><br /><br />Will the next President support voluntary campaign funding or push incumbency protection?<br />What about NYC term limits? 3 peat for Quinn and Bloomberg???

				I think the Democrats sweep all three seats, but I&#039;ve also learned not to trust polls!<br /><br />Personally I think the Assembly functions just fine.&nbsp;

				More OT<br /><br />I was reading some possible election surprises. None of which were really surprising.<br />I am curious what the next 12 months might be like. I do not expect them to be very bold.<br /><br /><br />However, one dream surprise in the next 4 years would be to see a thaw in relations with the people of Cuba. And freedom of travel to Cuba.<br />Not a priority. But on the list of 4000 wishes for the next administration.<br />
