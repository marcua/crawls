				i know its probably a bad time for some of us to even think of life after the holidays and strike, but im really dead at work. so i thought i would get the talks started for a new date and place for our next dinner outing! YAY!<br />before starting the poll i thought we could throw out some ideas for places. try to keep a vegetarian thought in mind as well, there may be more people on the boards who may want to hang with us loverly peeps but are turned off by some of our meatier excursions. and as for dates-do we want to try to stick with the friday nights at 8 slot? if so, i can say as of right now i am open all fridays but the 13th. k, here we go:<br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>Mundo</li></ul>http://mundoastoria.com/<br />[li]JJ&#39;s Fusion[/li] http://www.myjjs.com/review.asp<br />[li]Fatty&#39;s[/li] http://www.fattyscafenyc.com/home.html<br />[li]Elia&#39;s Corner[/li] http://www.queenstribune.com/archives/diningguide/reviews/eliascorner.htm<br />[li]Just Arthur&#39;s[/li] http://www.nyc.com/restaurants/Just_Arthurs_Restaurant.25030/editorial.aspx<br />[li]Meghna[/li]<br />[li]El Boqueron[/li] http://www.nynewsday.com/entertainment/dining/45089,0,1545220.venue<br />[li]Himalayan Teahouse[/li] http://www.nyc.com/restaurants/Himalaya_Teahouse.30113/editorial_review.aspx?fromhome=true<br />[li]Istria Sport Club[/li] http://www.nynewsday.com/entertainment/dining/108567,0,6668523.venue<br />[li]Opa![/li] <br />http://www.qgazette.com/News/2001/1031/Dining_review.html<br />[/list]<br /><br />...to name a few.

				Jim took me to Just Arthur&#39;s the day I finished the bar exam, so it&#39;s been awhile.&nbsp; Like, more than a decade.&nbsp; If I recall it was pretty old-school Italian plus steaks.&nbsp; Knowing me, I probably had a steak.&nbsp; I think I passed out after one drink, I was so utterly exhausted.&nbsp; I&#39;ve always been surprised that they&#39;ve managed to hang on as the neighbourhood has changed.&nbsp; Here&#39;s (http://www.qgazette.com/News/2002/0828/Dining_review/) a review of it that&#39;s a few years old - no idea if that&#39;s before or after the renovations.<br /><br />What about Amici Amore?&nbsp; I&#39;ve been to Butcher Bros. (their steakhouse), which was good but not outstanding.&nbsp; The two restaurants share an entrance and a hostess, and you may be able to order from either menu.&nbsp; Jim took me there for Valentine&#39;s Day last year, which was rather amusing.&nbsp; I guess they assumed that the &quot;ladies&quot; would prefer lighter fare, and so were only offering a selection of Italian dishes.&nbsp; Well, Jim had taken me to a steakhouse on purpose.&nbsp; They did allow us to order from the steak menu after I complained, but it was funny.&nbsp; Of course, the Butcher Bros. side wouldn&#39;t have many vegetarian dishes, but I think Amici Amore does.<br /><br />I really would like to go to El Bouqueron again.<br /><br />A couple of other possibilities:&nbsp; Piccolo Venezia (haven&#39;t been; heard it&#39;s good); Kebab Cafe (can&#39;t resist putting it on there).&nbsp; I&#39;ve heard some not so good things about the Himalayan Teahouse, although I really wanted it to be good.&nbsp; Has anyone had a good experience there?

				Amici Amore was pretty good. And from the 2-3 times we&#39;ve been to Amici and Butcher Bros. i gathered that its all one big melting pot. They gave us both menus each time. I had the prixe fix for $25. an app (i think i got clams) the ravioli of the day (can&#39; complain) and desert (some killer chocolate thing) we ordered a bottle of decent merlot around $20-25. its cute and small. i had a great steak over at Butcher Bros. no complaints for either place but nothing really sticks out as an &quot;i need to get back there&quot; experience.

				I think the only worthwhile Italian food in the area is at Trattoria L&#39;incontro, but the atmosphere has gotten way out of hand. <br /><br />I would be willing to try Rizzo&#39;s Italian Village just fot the kitsch factor, but I might spend a lot of time grimacing at the food.

				I really love the food at L&#39;incontro, too, but I know what you mean about the atmosphere.&nbsp; If you can get seated in the little side area, it&#39;s a bit better, I find.&nbsp; Once, we complained about a woman&#39;s perfume, and they took us into their banquet section and we ended up having basically a private dinner.&nbsp; It was very nice.

				I would imagine a decent italian restaurant would have many veg options. at the very least pasta with something veg.<br /><br />speaking of steak houses, what is the place on 23rd ave low 40&#39;s greek sounding name.&nbsp; my butcher likes it.&nbsp; (its become obvious to me that i am bad with names but good on the food, sorry about that)<br /><br />Some scungili with linguini and sliced garlic sounds good.&nbsp; anybody else like that dish?<br />

				I&#39;ve heard it said a few times that Christos Hasapo Taverna rivals Peter Luger.&nbsp; I had a discount coupon from restaurant.com to Christos Hasapo once, but ended up never using it.<br /><br />It&#39;s funny, but I&#39;ve never had scungilli (conch) Italian style, only ever Haitian, called <em>lambi</em>.&nbsp; I&#39;d eat sliced garlic on rubber bands, though, and I love lambi, so I&#39;m sure I love scungilli with garlic. :yum:

				its an old dish that most places dont make anymore. but its a classic simple dish.&nbsp; I love conch chowder from the islands.&nbsp; <br /><br />My butcher says that Christos Hasapo Tavern has huge portions and good basic red wines.&nbsp; A rival of peter lugers is hard to believe but thats an amazing review and a good reason to go.&nbsp; Im sure they have plenty of veg options like salad, creamed spinach and potatoes.&nbsp; that should do it right?<br /><br />

				Kebob cafe is one of my all time favorite places. it can be small, slow and more expensive than you think.&nbsp; cant really fit in a party bigger than 4 or maybe 6 people.&nbsp; anyone who has not been there really should make the time.&nbsp; Ali is worth meeting at least once, a real character and great chef.<br /><br />Mundo is very good.<br /><br />

				Well, maybe when we have a smaller group, we should consider it!&nbsp; There are dishes that are less expensive, usually vegetarian choices.&nbsp; I know I can eat there for less than $20 w/tax and tip, if I restrain myself in my eating choices!&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)&nbsp; But even a little bit of his food is worth it.

				I am all for a veg friendly place but where?&nbsp; <br />Mundo is probably the best bet for something new and something vegetarian.<br /><br />I would also say that czech food is probably as veg friendly as freshly butchered cow on a feed lot smothered in cream sauce.&nbsp; Delicious yes, veg friendly no.<br /><br />Sorry if ive killed anyone with that visual but czech food is kinda of heavy and meat centric.<br />For anyone turned on by that visual, I vote for a steak house for our next outing!<br />

				Balkh Shish Kabab is pretty decent, although their food seems drier than it used to be.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t been in awhile, and I&#39;d enjoy going again, though - they have a particularly good version of plain sweet lassi.&nbsp; I agree with the linked review&#39;s opinion of manto - very light, almost lacy meat dumplings.&nbsp; Their palows are also good, as I recall.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the weak link is atmosphere - heavy on the fluorescent lighting.&nbsp; And there&#39;s no alcohol, and I don&#39;t think you can byo.
