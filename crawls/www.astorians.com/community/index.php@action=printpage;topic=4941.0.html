				Seriously, does anyone actually know anyone who approves of Bush right now? I don&#39;t. I know people who voted for him, and they&#39;re all horrified by now. I find it incredible that even 30% would still approve of his job as a president. I would love to hear the reasoning of an average citizen (i.e. not a government official) who thinks he&#39;s doing a good job. I won&#39;t even make fun of you, I just want to know why. <br /><br />I realize I&#39;m preaching to the choir by posting this on astorians.com, but as this is the politics/rant forum maybe there&#39;s a chance someone can answer this for me.

				I think a lot of them are folks in the South, people who just like the tax breaks and don&#39;t think about anything else, and some folks out West, Utah and Idaho come to mind.

				I would love to find out if some good friends of my family still worship the ground he walks on, but I&#39;m afraid to ask.&nbsp; They live an hour and a half north of here and are hard-core Republicans and read Ann Coulter.&nbsp; And according to my Mom, hardly in the minority up there.&nbsp; I basically don&#39;t mention politics as it can lead to long heated arguments that go nowhere and are utterly pointless.&nbsp; They are not going to change their minds.

				I know that a lot of people in finance are Republican, since they get richer faster while Republicans are in office and when Democrats are in office they get poorer while the economy balances itself out as a whole. We have a very good friend who has been in finance for a number of years and who has always stood up for Bush. It has meant for a lot of interesting conversations (I mostly listen to husband and him debate politics). It&#39;s rather interesting.<br /><br />A lady at work is a hard-core Republican and she is also a fairly religious person (Catholic - not to say that all Catholics lean towards the right). She is always saying things like, &quot;I hate Hillary Clinton. She is just a two-faced idiot. I would never vote for her&quot; and &quot;I don&#39;t respect people who don&#39;t respect our President.&quot; She just seems like one of those people that is a Republican because that&#39;s what she&#39;s always been, so she stays faithful no matter what.<br /><br />We have other good friends who are very religious and buy into the religious dogma that basically says &quot;all people are children of God, but you&#39;re his favorite.&quot; So they have a hard time with the whole Islam thing (it&#39;s us vs. them, etc.), and they think that we&#39;re doing our duty by being in Iraq and Bush is right to have us there, etc.<br /><br />So I think it boils down to a lot of finance-focused professionals and religious fanatics - and people who are generally just afraid so they vote for the President that can be a cowboy and supposedly save the day. They&#39;re probably looking for a good drinking buddy, too.<br /><br />Crazy people! (But some of them are our friends, so I won&#39;t call them all crazy! :-D)

				Most fair minded Republicans have serious doubts or issues about Bush by now. Those who still support him would march in goose-step behind him off a cliff if he told them to.
