				I have one of those foam mattresses from IKEA that I bought a little over two years ago. I got a firm mattress, and it was nice for a little while, but now it has a permanent dent in it and my hips just sink down into it and it seems to be hurting my knees if I sleep on my side. Is there some kind of hard flat board I could put on it, or do I have to buy a whole new mattress? I have a nice mattress pad, so I could put that on top of the board as long as the board is big enough to fit over my bed. I have also flipped it over, but it&#039;s gotten to the point where it&#039;s about the same on both sides.<br /><br />This seems like a stupid question, but I don&#039;t feel like spending hundreds of dollars on a good mattress right now, and this is a twin mattress and whenever I do get a new mattress I want it to be a full. But I can&#039;t do that in my current apartment.. so... anyone have any ideas of ways to amend this without getting a whole new mattress?&nbsp; :|

				By foam, you mean the memory foam type? That are heat sensitive and form to your body and are more expensive.&nbsp; Or the regular foam type that run really cheap?

				Go and buy an Aero-Bed.&nbsp; <br />They&#039;re available in variety of sizes. <br />You can get one at Target or Bed, Bath and Beyond.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.thinkaero.com/<br />

				Bed bugs?&nbsp; Are you kidding?&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure.&nbsp; Have never experienced a bed bug.&nbsp; <br />Years ago I experienced crabs, having slept with the wrong person. <br /><br />Here&#039;s a bed bug info page from the Harvard School of Public Health <br />http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/bedbugs/<br />

I think this cost around $100. In other words, cheapo, but I didn&#039;t buy an $800 mattress for a reason, and that is because I am poor. The Aerobed thing might be a good temporary solution for me.

				I see, if it was the memory foam I would have suggested it was a defect and probably still under warranty as they should last for quite a while.&nbsp; Sounds like 2 years is about average for a typical foam mattress. I&#039;ve heard the air ones are pretty good.&nbsp; I buy stuff like that at bed bath and beyond using those 20% coupons that are everywhere.&nbsp; Good luck...
