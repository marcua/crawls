				Definitely a trek from broadway - but Stove on 28th avenue and 46th street is a nice brunch spot on sundays.<br />Bob I think you should definitely try the Eggs Benedict there - I&#39;m a big fan of the dish and its never disappointed me at Stove.<br /><br />

				The best eggs benedict (and eggs florentine, my personal fav) I&#39;ve had in the area is all the way over in the LIC: <strong>Tournesol</strong> on Vernon Blvd. Like a block down from the 7 train Vernon Jackson stop. GREAT French bistro fare and the seating is so sunny and genial and the service is tres bien. Their brunch is about $10-$12 (not including drinks, sadly) but its really fresh and tasty. I like stopping by the LIC Farmers Market afterwards too!<br />

				I would definately not recommend the Sanford- the service has been going down hill for the last year or so along with the food! Brick cafe has a good Brunch as does Michael&#39;s restaurant (Broadway- just before 34th street).&nbsp; :-D

				Yeah, after few too many coffees....I wish I could dance like that without a bear suit...ah well.<br /><br />&nbsp;An interesting point about Brunches. What makes a really good Brunch.....price point....quality of drinks...variety......ENDLESS drinks....the food.....classic brunch fare or eclectic...location.....ambiance......seating/view/staff....combinations of all....I met a friend at Sunwichs on 35th and 35th...nice bar...lottsa TV screens....Chemay belgian ale on tap...don&#39;t know anywhere else that has that....but &quot;Brunch&quot; was a sad diner fare with nothing added, all a la cart...not much of a Brunch for me.<br /><br />Anyone...anyone....Buhler.....Buhler.....

				Might be slightly outside a 5 block radius, but Cup delivers pretty solidly with the brunch (and is also a fun - dare I say it, hip atmosphere). My only squabble is the $7 mimosas, which make it more expensive than, say...<br /><br />Locale (33rd St/34th Ave) which is doing a 10.95 brunch special lately, which INCLUDES the mimosa.&nbsp; For some reason an entree and mimosa at Locale is cheaper than the same at Cup, which doesn&#39;t seem right.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#39;ll vouch for Cup&#39;s being tasty though I haven&#39;t gotten to Locale yet.

				Add me to the list of those who don&#39;t like the Astoria Diner. I had eggs benedict there back in April of this year - figured I&#39;d try them out. It was pretty bad. The sauce tasted vinegary!<br /><br />Actually, I&#39;ve tried that diner several times over the years when it&#39;d changed owners a few times. I kept hoping someone would take it over and do it right, but that&#39;s yet to happen.<br /><br />I have a theory the location is cursed since about twenty years ago when a set of new owners wrecked the gorgeous classic original Art Deco exterior (it used to be called the Modern Age Diner then) when they did a cheap tacky faux Mediterranean remodeling job. It broke my heart when I saw what they did to it! How I regret I never shot some photographs of it while it was still in its original Art Deco glory.<br />The only bigger crime against Art Deco is what happened to the old Narden Fragrances factory down by the railroad tracks at 42nd Street.<br /><br />Anyway, I flat out refused to set foot in that diner out of principle while the people who wrecked it were running it. When it was later taken over by new management about eight years ago, I gave it another try and was not impressed. Now the newest owners seem to be keeping right with the new tradition of not very good food.<br />It&#39;s cursed, I tell ya! &nbsp;:?

				I don&#39;t particularly like to feel like i am promoting myself, but i am too lazy to retype my last meeting with the astoria diner, so here&#39;s what i wrote about it (and a few comments about the preceding modern age diner, and milennium diners)&nbsp; http://inastoriany.blogspot.com/2005/12/astoria-diner-is-disaster.html#links<br /><br />Blech! is what i will say now

				Great blog, Firelight.&nbsp; I agree wholeheartedly with your take on Michael&#39;s.&nbsp; They are the best - the older Greek waiter in the back is the best waiter there, at least in my opinion.&nbsp; He is so kind, attentive and friendly, and the food is good and comes quickly.

				Mezzo Mezzo&#39;s egg benedict was awful in my opinion. First they served it with a side of sauteed &quot;spinach&quot; which was basically a pile of frozen mushy chopped spinach with a few onions mixed in. Who wants to eat that with the eggs? Some mixed greens would have been better. The eggs were ok, except the hollandaise sauce was piled on and was so thick.<br /><br />My boyfriend had the eggs and bacon, but the bacon was a blob of it stuck together no strips, and it had a funny taste to it. <br /><br />

				I like Cafe Bar for brunch.&nbsp; I used to think unlimited mimosas/bloody marys were a good idea--until the 5th or 6th time I slept all day after such a jaunt.<br /><br />Incidentally, my favorite brunch of all time is at Essex in Manhattan.&nbsp; The food is novel and it comes with 3 drinks which is excessive but perfect if you want to get flirty over the newspaper for a couple hours. http://nymag.com/listings/bar/essex/index.html

There were 6 of us and our bill came to $68, not including tip. The brunch special is $9.95 per person and included two drinks (we had mimosas), coffee or tea, and an entree. There were a ton of omelets to choose from, burgers, salads, wraps, etc. It is definitely worth the price! The special runs until 3pm and even though we got there at 2:50pm, they honored the brunch prices.

				Not to be repetitive or anything, but yep...I love me some Michael&#39;s for brunch. I took my parents and sister when they were visiting a couple weeks ago, and it was my first time there - I was so surprised at how much they had on their brunch menu! The french toast that I had was excellent.

				John highly recommends the irish breakfast. it&#39;s even better than the pseudo irish diner in sunnyside.<br />but not as good as in ireland. but it is a good substitute.<br />better than me making it (blood pudding, eeeeeewwwwww)

				Gustavino&#39;s is amazing - the space is huge and incredible.&nbsp; You have to visit it to really appreciate it - reviews just won&#39;t do it justice.&nbsp; The food is pretty good as well, though a bit pricey.&nbsp; The overall experience is well worth the visit.

				I took the advice of many on this board and went to Dillinger&#39;s for brunch last Sunday.&nbsp; It was fantastic!&nbsp; Not only are there unlimited mimosas/bloody marys, but they give you a free basket of bagels for the table.&nbsp; Our waitress was great, very friendly, and the food was delicious.&nbsp; Unfortunately, everyone at my table is boring, and we all ordered Eggs Benedict, so I didn&#39;t get to try anything else.&nbsp; The food was so good and filling, that I was full for the rest of the day.&nbsp; Full in a good way.&nbsp; Thanks for the recommendation!
