			i dont know about indian around ditmars, but there is a smelly, dingy, little hole of a bangladeshi curry joint down on 21st and astoria blvd called roti boti that makes fresh naan all day and night, has veg curries and a roti oven... knows what i mean when i say i like spicy food... coriander, anise, cumin, cloves... a little bit of a walk, but by bike like five minutes. definately worth the trip. oh, and i forgot. CHEAP.

			On 30th Ave there are a couple of places - Gandhi is so-so.. I've had their lunch special and it's alright. &nbsp;Meghna is awesome though.. it's on 34th street (I think) and 30th ave.. it's actually around the corner from 30th ave. &nbsp;It's great Indian Food. &nbsp;Takes them a really long time to cook it though - but well worth the wait.<br /><br />And also - it's not Indian food, but there's a guy with a cart on Steinway and 34th ave that makes the best Chicken and rice plate ever!

			There&#039;s a thread on Chowhound you might want to check out. &nbsp;They mention Gandhi and Megna, but also some others:<br /><br />http://www.chowhound.com/boards/outer/messages/51652.html
