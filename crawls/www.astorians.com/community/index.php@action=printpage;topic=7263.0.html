				Is anyone else signed up for this? I&#039;ve been on their list for a few months now and i am really impressed with the amount of discounted and free events they have listed. Their weekly email list is massive. It runs the gamut of sailing around NY harbor, comedy shows, theatre, wine tastings and more. No I don&#039;t work for them, and i am not getting paid to be a shill. I just know that a lot of us are always on the lookout for fun, cheap/free things to do in NYC and since checking this out I thought folks might be interested.<br />you just sign up for a weekly email from them. I haven&#039;t noticed any increase in spam or anything like that, in case anyone was worried. you have to be on the list and a registered member, which costs nothing, to view all the details of the events offered, but i am telling you the two minutes to sign up is really worth it for all the nifty things they tell you about. I get 2 emails from them a week: one detailing what is being offered for the week which like i said is massive and the other called roar of the crowd which just lets you know what events are popular with other members. once in a while they will email a featured event, but i have never received something that was a straight advertisement for a non event. <br /><br />while i am at it another great resource for fun cheap/free things is the Mann About Town newsletter that also comes out once a week. It&#039;s a list compliled by a woman named Wanda Mann who i believe is an event coordinator of some sort so she gets all these cool happenings and shares them with her readers.&nbsp; Recently she partnered with goldstar, which i thought funny since i&#039;ve been getting goldstar events for the past few months. No spam from her either.<br /><br />For anyone interested signing up is easy. do so here:<br />www.goldstarevents.com<br />and here:<br />www.mannabouttown.com<br /><br />Now you know all my cheapy activity secrets. This is a testament to how much i love this forum...i&#039;m giving you ammo to beat me out for really cool stuff. <br />Most if not all is more Manhattan-centric but hey it&#039;s awesome to enjoy it on the cheap.<br /><br />Now, don&#039;t go telling everyone and their mother about this.&nbsp; :wink:
