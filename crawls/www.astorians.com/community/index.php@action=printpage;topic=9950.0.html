				It&#039;s great that they have it - just makes sure to wear bug repellent as I was eaten up by no see ums. Also, wear sunscreen.<br /><br />Where are you doing yoga?

				I&#039;ve done the yoga in Socrates, although not as often as I&#039;d like.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had a problem with bugs or the sun.&nbsp; A lot of times you can position your mat under the shade of a tree.&nbsp; I&#039;d say there are usually around a dozen people.&nbsp; It&#039;s more or less beginner or advanced beginner level, so it&#039;s not particularly challenging, but it&#039;s accessible to people of all levels and very relaxing.&nbsp; I really love it - there&#039;s something about doing yoga outside on a beautiful summer morning that I can&#039;t really explain.

				Thanks for posting, Pineapple!&nbsp; I&#039;m excited to check out the Yoga and Tai Chi!&nbsp; <br /><br />They are also offering Pilates, Tai Chi, and Capoeira.&nbsp; I&#039;m way too out of shape for Capoeira, but it&#039;s amazing to watch.

				I&#039;ve done both the Capoeira and the yoga. I think there were usually 30+ people in the yoga class, but since you are outside there is tons of shape. Bring your own mat or a towel. I really enjoy the idea of outdoor yoga but I definitely needed some allergy meds once the flowers/trees were in bloom. <br /><br />The Capoeira class at Socrates was really interesting. I had only done it once before at NYSC, but found the class to be really fun. It also never hurts to have a bunch of hot Brazilians teaching you.&nbsp; :mrgreen:
