				Interesting thought. I saw a clip of him defending the war in Iraq and saying it<br />was a noble and just cause.<br /><br />I think I&#039;d ask him to fully explain the nobility and justice of:<br /><br />- the many young lives, American and Iraqi, that have been sacrificed<br /><br />- destroying the good will that much of the world felt for us post 9/11<br /><br />- decimating what was a fairly good economy. I find it shameful that the<br />dollar is so reviled now around the world that travelers are being advised to change<br />money here because even cash exchange bureaus don&#039;t want US dollars.<br /><br />I&#039;d also ask what he&#039;s had to change/sacrifice since prices of everything from gas and groceries<br />to even your local laundromat and public transport have increased. I signed over my ENTIRE federal<br />tax refund check to pay off a credit card rather than spend it or sock it away. <br /><br />And finally, I&#039;d ask him if he approves of Dick Cheney&#039;s &quot;so what&quot; response when asked what he<br />thought of the fact that the majority of Americans now want us out of Iraq. &quot;So what&quot; from someone<br />who got five deferments. <br /><br />Sorry, didn&#039;t mean to go off like this but once you get going......

				Sorry, but the good will that people had for the US post-9/11 is long gone. <br /><br />We have more enemies and the &#039;friends&#039; we still have are not the allies that<br />stood with us pre-9/11.<br /><br />And regarding greed and the economy, check out cnn.com, the money section.<br />They&#039;re running a series, asking people to send in their stories about their<br />economic woes.<br /><br />When you read these peoples&#039; situations, your heart breaks. Losing their homes,<br />their 401k&#039;s, their kids&#039; savings, etc. makes me ashamed.

				My &quot;worthless&quot; liberal arts degree landed me quite a nice job in said field soon after I left school.&nbsp; But I guess anything is worthless if it isn&#039;t math or science related, if you ask certain people.&nbsp; Oh well...I feel sorry for you if that&#039;s your outlook on life, just as I feel sorry for you if you feel your degree has been &quot;worthless.&quot;&nbsp; If what you have studied has been &quot;worthless,&quot; then perhaps you haven&#039;t tried hard enough.&nbsp; However, if I had to go back and do it all over again, I would do my &quot;worthless&quot; degree over, and over, and over, and over again, and I&#039;d take all those other worthless classes for my major that I didn&#039;t have a chance to take the first time around.<br /><br />Guess that makes me a pretty worthless individual around these parts.

				When I spend four years in school working on a &quot;worthless&quot; degree that got me the job that puts food on the table, only to read such ridiculous, ignorant, narrow-minded comments...sorry, but I take offense.&nbsp; At least my &quot;worthless&quot; degree taught me to have an open mind and to be more respectful of others, something which they seem to have skipped in your major.

I saw a clip of him defending the war in Iraq and saying it<br />was a noble and just cause.<br /><br />I think I&#039;d ask him to fully explain the nobility and justice of:<br /><br />- the many young lives, American and Iraqi, that have been sacrificed<br /><br />- destroying the good will that much of the world felt for us post 9/11<br /><br />- decimating what was a fairly good economy. I find it shameful that the<br />dollar is so reviled now around the world that travelers are being advised to change<br />money here because even cash exchange bureaus don&#039;t want US dollars.<br /><br />I&#039;d also ask what he&#039;s had to change/sacrifice since prices of everything from gas and groceries<br />to even your local laundromat and public transport have increased. I signed over my ENTIRE federal<br />tax refund check to pay off a credit card rather than spend it or sock it away. <br /><br />And finally, I&#039;d ask him if he approves of Dick Cheney&#039;s &quot;so what&quot; response when asked what he<br />thought of the fact that the majority of Americans now want us out of Iraq. &quot;So what&quot; from someone<br />who got five deferments. <br /><br />Sorry, didn&#039;t mean to go off like this but once you get going......<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No question, the tens of millions&nbsp; freed in Afghan and Iraq are hoping this noble cause&nbsp; succeeds. The lives, both young and old &#039;sacrificed&#039; with inaction would&nbsp; be&nbsp; a far worse&nbsp; action.<br /><br />I could do without the &#039;good-will&#039; of our allies&nbsp; arming Saddam even as we were headed&nbsp; to Afghan and we were flying&nbsp; over Iraq enforcing the ceasefire for 12 years. So, when the world loved&nbsp; us we got 9/11?&nbsp; This goodwill&nbsp; myth&nbsp; is just not true. This world&nbsp; has&nbsp; zero to do with good will.<br /><br />The dollar faced&nbsp; the Euro, again from our wonderful allies in Europe, who were plotting on bringing down our economy even as Uncle &#039;Sap&#039; helped&nbsp; free Eastern Europe&nbsp; after 50 years of keeping troops there. The Euro did not exist during the 1990&#039;s, we should&nbsp; have built up our economy during peace time. <br /><br />Americans&nbsp; can at least &#039;sacrifice&#039; some money furing the war, something we have not done. It hurts me alot, I lost my job after 9/11, and&nbsp; this followed&nbsp; a Defense Contractor Job I&nbsp; and nearly 3 million lost&nbsp; when the Military was cut in the 1990&#039;s.<br /><br />It&#039;s not true&nbsp; most Americans&nbsp; want us to win and leave Iraq in an orderly fashion. As for deferments and all that, while the bodies of&nbsp; our Armed&nbsp; Forces were being dragged through Mogadishu and Bombing runs&nbsp; over&nbsp; Serbia, a nation that had&nbsp; really done&nbsp; nothing to us, President Clinton who&nbsp; wasn&#039;t even in the Boy Scouts, was busy&nbsp; chasing the intern.

				Thanks for the mess...I can&#039;t help but ask, before you became president, when you drove that company into bankruptcy, did you honestly think you could be an effective president of the US of A?<br /><br />How does it feel to have everything you ever wanted in life handed to you by your father?&nbsp; The fact that all you achieved was virtually handed to you at the expense of an entire nation...does that not bother you at all?<br /><br />Was it all just a game to you?&nbsp; <br /><br />Isn&#039;t it a fact that all you want is a library?

				For the longest time, I didn&#039;t even look at the thumbs.&nbsp; I am still learning my way around this thing!&nbsp; Anyway, once I discovered it, I did use it a couple of times but only on the most divisive comments I have read, which are not Billz&#039;s.<br /><br />Sorry folks, but I had very little respect for George Bush going in, and I feel that what little I had is completely gone.&nbsp; If you had a boss who you felt lied, stole, showed preferencial treatment to a few, could not speak coherently, etc. I am pretty sure you would lose respect for that person.&nbsp; Also, there is no &#039;Human Resources&#039; to go to in this case and for those of you &#039;my country right or wrong&#039; people out there, no I am not leaving the country.&nbsp; I am however counting down the days - 300 left to go!

The problem is that when some people get on their political soapbox, liberal, conservative or otherwise, they feel entitlement to be snide and condescending. There is this self-righteous attitude that comes across because some people talk about politics like they have ultimate truth, and any detractor is an idiot. <br />My disagreement with FZ has never been his own political views(although I don&#039;t agree with many of them, that is not where my disagreement with him lies), it&#039;s been the blanket attacks and presumptions about my political views. Lumping in lefties as terrorist supporters is, to me, disgusting. It&#039;s just the plain disrespect that I don&#039;t agree with.<br />I don&#039;t care who it comes from, if you expect respect from people, give them the same. <br /><br />As far as this &quot;Mob Mentality&quot; accusation, If I were to go into a room and knowingly piss off a group of strangers, would I expect some of them to like me and others to not?

But with the media and the nation so focused on those tense hours in Washington, another story about American soldiers in Iraq went largely unnoticed.<br /><br />On Tuesday, President Bush posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor - the highest military decoration awarded by the United States - to Petty Officer Second Class Michael A. Monsoor.&nbsp; A Navy SEAL who served in Ramadi in 2006, Monsoor was killed when he threw himself on a grenade and saved the lives of the other members of his team.<br /><br />http://www.iava.org/component/option,com_/Itemid,116/option,content/task,view/id,2721/<br /><br />Sometimes it&#039;s easy for us to forget the individual stories of exceptional courage behind these wars. But it&#039;s incredibly important that we take the time to remember them- not as a way to politicize the war, but as a reminder of the amazing sacrifices being made every day by our troops on the battlefield and their families back home.<br /><br />Michael Monsoor was a true American hero we can all be proud of. <br />Please forward his story to your friends and family and remind them of the brave men and women serving our country.<br /><br />Thank you.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />http://www.iava.org/component/option,com_/Itemid,116/option,content/task,view/id,2721/<br />

				Mentioned before that I dont see much point here.<br /><br /><br />But I would like to understand from Hagel whether Congress did the right thing in giving the President war options against Iraq. It seems they gave war powers - Y - trusting that Bush would use all other alternatives including diplomacy - X -.

Saddam had murals&nbsp; in his palace praising the attacks, and was seeking to get Nukes, Iran seeking to have Nukes is bad enough, to have Saddam sanctionless while our troops are&nbsp; in the region, would have the same critics&nbsp; who say we shouldn&#039;t have removed him ,saying we are appeasing him by leaving him in place. The President acted on the two&nbsp; nations, one who was at war with us and violated the cease fire repeatedly in Iraq, and the Taliban which harbored&nbsp; Al Qeada and Osama&nbsp; in Afghan. I see no &#039;disgrace&#039; in those limited decisions.
