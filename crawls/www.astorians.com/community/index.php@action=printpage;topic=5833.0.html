It also noted that there already is a woman in Sweden with Metallica as a middle name.<br /><br />The tax agency appealed to a higher court, frustrating the family&#039;s foreign travel plans.<br /><br />&quot;We&#039;ve had to cancel trips and can&#039;t get anywhere because we can&#039;t get her a passport without an approved name,&quot; Tomaro said.

				If this was Gwyneth Paltrow they&#039;d let her.<br /><br />Reminds me of the scene from 30 Rock where the receptionist tells Tina Fey she was thinking of naming her daughter table, but that it was really more of a boy&#039;s name.

				People should be able to name their babies any old name they want.&nbsp; It&#039;s just strange that Sweden would feel the need to regulate that.&nbsp; &nbsp;:?
