				there is a petition going around for the Obama family to adopt a pet.&nbsp; apparently he made some sort of statement that once the election is over, he plans on getting a pet for his family.&nbsp; the akc has suggested some pure breeds for them to choose from, and this petition suggests their other option...adoption.<br /><br />see below for the link to where the petition can be found (and the story behind it).<br /><br /><br /><br />http://obamafamilydog.com/<br /><br /><br /><br />this isn&#039;t a political issue, it&#039;s a humane one.&nbsp; please sign the petition, and pass it on to as many people as you can.&nbsp; thanks.

				not sure why it&#039;s so silly?!&nbsp; <br /><br />a petition is nothing more than an open letter signed by a group of people.&nbsp; <br /><br />sure in the grand scheme, it has no real meaning, but it shows mass support for a particular cause.&nbsp; depending on that cause, it could persuade someone to at least think differently if they see that a large enough group is in support.<br /><br />and, for a politician, it may have extra special meaning...power of the masses, and whatnot.<br /><br />you think it&#039;s silly, don&#039;t sign it.&nbsp; but no need to criticize it either.&nbsp; thousands of people have already signed it...that&#039;s not too small of a feat.&nbsp; doesn&#039;t sound silly to me either.

				It would be great if he adopted a dog, it would also be great if he bought one. What&#039;s silly is the dissection of his private life to such a degree as to inspire a petition. What kind of dog should he get? A poodle? A pitbull? A dalmation? Let&#039;s vote on that instead!<br /><br /><br />

				Petitions are a good way to shine a little light on the cause...if he adopts or not, it could get a little mention in the press...<br /><br />IMO it would be &nbsp;a good opportunity for him to set a great example for his girls. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				I have a suggestion. If Obama wins the election he can adopt McCain and walk him along Pennsylvania Ave. If McCain wins Obama can adopt bush and walk him in the streets of Chicago.&nbsp; :wink: :evil:
