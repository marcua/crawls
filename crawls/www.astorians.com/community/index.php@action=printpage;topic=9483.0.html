			<dd class="postbody">
				There’s been several threads on Astorians discussing the state of shopping in the neighborhood, especially on Steinway.<br /><br />At times it seems to me that the discussion seems to overly focus on what Astoria doesn’t have instead of what it does. I’d like to point out that Astoria has four, prime, diverse retail strips: Ditmars, Grand, Broadway and Steinway. As well as big box retailers on Northern Boulevard and smaller shopping areas scattered throughout the area.<br /><br />How many other neighborhoods in this city can lay a similar claim? How many of people come from places with no “downtowns” or one’s that are empty?<br /><br />As an FYI, at the end of this post you’ll find a census of the stores on Steinway prime: the blocks between Broadway and 30th Avenue, in order from north to south (west side of the street in blue and the east side in red).<br /><br />Steinway between 30th and 28th Avenues was, in my opinion, considered to be of lesser importance than the prime blocks, though you can find some varied businesses, including restaurants, clothes shops, nail salons etc., and a few of Astoria’s long-time enterprises including Schtaz’s paint, She Goes to Your Head hair salon, Joanne’s Bakery, and Gyro Uno.<br /><br />Though this may be debatable to some, Steinway between 28th Avenue and Astoria Boulevard has actually improved with the rise of Arabic-owned businesses, though it looks like this stretch is again in transition. I counted approximately 8-9 empty storefronts, which I find troubling.<br /><br />I deliberately left out Steinway between Broadway and 34th Avenue because it was never prime and always a bit of a hodgepodge (and a mess).<br /><br /><br />Though I think it’s important to support local shops, I make no moral judgments as to how and where people shop. And I’m not advocating&nbsp; that one must shop locally to be a “good“ Astorian. I’m only hoping people enjoy what is on offer and perhaps think twice before making a complaint and maybe give Steinway merchants a chance at capturing some of your disposable income.<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font">STEINWAY (north from Broadway)</span></strong><br />West side&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;East side<br />Commerce Bank&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lite Bites<br />Camouflage (clothes)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folya (clothing)<br />Steinway Electronics&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Communication<br />Claires (accessories)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jewelrama<br />Vital Dent (dentist)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I-sight Optical<br />Pretty Girl (clothes)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fashion Accessories<br />Sports Lane (sports goods)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bank of America<br />Poleberg (sports goods)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99 Cent Store<br />Foot Locker&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool Jeans<br />Steinway Formal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payless Shoes<br />Game Stop&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McDonald’s<br />Dental Office&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Top Gun (leather coats)<br />AT&amp;T Cell Phones&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GNC<br />VACANT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FYE &nbsp;<br />USA Pets&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fabco Shoes<br />The Gap&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GM Variety<br />FedEx Kinkos&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Children’s Place<br />Starbucks&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Star Pizza<br />Queens County Bank&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motherhood Maternity<br />Steinway parking lot&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Index (clothing) <br />Vitamin Shoppe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[unsigned store] (sneakers/shoes)<br />Natura Spa&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haagen Daz<br />Jimmy Jazz&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VACANT (was The Image)<br />Perfumania&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victoria’s Secret<br />[unsigned shop] (clothes)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VACANT (was Ginzo)<br />Xtreme (clothes)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easy Pickins<br />Marty’s Tuxedo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verizon<br />Jays&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VACANT (was Bath &amp; Bodyworks)<br />Gap Kids&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Universal Fragances<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benetton&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sagapo Jewelry<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lane Bryant<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zales Jewelry<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sketchers (shoes)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Express (clothing)<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font">STEINWAY (north from 31st Avenue)</span></strong><br />west side&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;east side<br />Northfork Bank&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RiteAid<br />Strawberry Jam&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Esparks Coffee Shop<br />Matrix Sportswear&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wendy’s<br />Feel Beauty Supplies&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haynes (clothes)<br />Jewel Licious&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beach Bum Tanning<br />Modell’s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bottom Line Discount<br />VACANT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VACANT<br />Roberts (Sneaker)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zig Zag (clothing) <br />Que Cossa (clothing)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diva<br />1-800-Mattres&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queens County Bank<br />Bakers Shoes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Express Optical<br />Payless Shoes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shoetique<br />Liberty Travel&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moon Electronics<br />Venezini (clothes)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AT&amp;T<br />GNC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J.H.

				Unfortunately, I believe this list will be shorter in less than a month or so. I was walking from 30th Ave to 34th Ave last Saturday and at least 4 of the clothing/jewelry stores had &quot;LOST OUR LEASE&quot; signs in the windows.

				I noticed that too. I compiled the list this past Monday (and man was it cold!), but not all signs said going out of business, just huge markdowns, at least by what I saw. I was freezing so didn&#039;t study all in detail.<br /><br />I&#039;m not surprised by this, it was a tough Christmas and some business probably won&#039;t make it through the year. I&#039;m hoping if some do go out others will take their place quickly.

				Of course, it could also be those stores using a tactic that I&#039;ve often seen employed in the past by some stores on Steinway Street...using the &quot;everything must go&quot; or &quot;lost our lease&quot; banners to bring in more business to the store, which &quot;surprisingly&quot; happens to remain open.&nbsp; I remember LTR Jeans used to do this quite often, as well as a similar jeans store that was on 31st Street by the Ditmars train station.<br /><br />Of course, with today&#039;s economic conditions and the current state of Steinway Street today, however, I would not be surprised if these businesses, unfortunately, are going out of business for real.&nbsp; There&#039;s so many vacant spots on Steinway, too many for a shopping strip that is supposed to be the heart of Astoria and one of the most vibrant in Queens.

				By the way, 28Grand... thanks for compiling that list. It must have taken you all day to get all of the stores listed. It is unfortunate that ten of the store fronts on your list are vacant. I don&#039;t go over to the Ditmars shopping area often, but wonder if there are lots of vacancies over there as well?

				Thanks for the list 28 Grand.

				No offense to anyone, but I think shopping for a lot of things (especially clothing and shoes) in Astoria is a bit of a joke.&nbsp; I&#039;m personally an advocate of &quot;you get what you pay for&quot; and a lot of the stores in the neighborhood don&#039;t cut it for me qualitywise (ie: easy pickins or all of the 99 cent stores).&nbsp; Sure there&#039;s a gap or a foot locker, and some other chain stores, but not much else that urges me to spend my money there.&nbsp; With manhattan so close, there are so many more viable options.&nbsp; and because it&#039;s queens and the options are more limited, the sales are generally better in the city (i almost never buy full retail price for name brand stuff).

				People - I just believe that this neighborhood is more poor than middle class and the stores on Steinway reflect it.&nbsp; Also greedy landlords who must be charging insane rents that no one can afford to pay and still make a profit worth making.&nbsp; Hmmm - will Steinway ever be &quot;great?&quot;&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived here more years than I care to admit and back in the old days it was Mom and Pop type stores that may have had quality but hardly at the cutting edge of fashion.&nbsp; Now there&#039;s an attempt to be more fashionable but the quality . . . where is it . . . anybody ever here of silk, wool, cashmere . . .nope . . . it&#039;s a polyester jungle out there . . .although &quot;Area&quot; does a good job of mixing quality and style.

				28Grand - I think that compiling this list was a tremendous effort, so thank you for that.&nbsp; I also agree it is important to spend your money locally to keep the area thriving.&nbsp; I just wish they sold better quality clothes on Steinway. I usually shop for clothes in Manhattan or online.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t shopped on Steinway in a long time.&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;ll check it out when the weather warms.&nbsp; <br /><br />The last time I drove around there, I was so surprised that all the places I went when I was younger were gone - the movie theater, the Wiz, Cagney&#039;s.&nbsp; :wink:

To say that there are no options for clothing or shoes in all of Astoria is like saying that there are no options for restaurants in Manhattan. Astoria is a pretty big neighborhood, in case you didn&#039;t notice. Plus there are plenty of &quot;acceptable&quot; clothing stores here in Astoria. But are they good enough for you should be the question. On 31st Street between Ditmars and 21st Ave you have Mimi&#039;s Closet. A small boutique granted, prices can be a bit high, but all of her dresses are one of a kind designs, as well as her handbags and shoes. Vintage and vintage style is what she sells. She also sells handmade jewelry, which are well within the price range of practically anybody living here in Astoria. Further down on 31st street we have The Blooming Co., located right past that Mexican restaurant whose name I forget at this moment. They also are a sort of vintage style, but they also have shoes, boots, hats handbags, gloves and both of these places would fit in perfectly in a neighborhood like Soho or the West Village, but chose instead to plant their roots here.<br /><br />&nbsp; On 31st Ave you have the Love boutique ( I think it&#039;s called) another fine establishment in the same sort of style. There are several others whose names and locations escape my mind at this very moment, but I&#039;m sure if you googled &quot;vintage boutique-astoria ny&quot; you might come up with several hits. <br /><br />If you consider Foot Locker to be a &quot;quality establishment&quot;,that&#039;s funny ,considering that their salespeople couldn&#039;t sell a pair of ballet shoes to a ballerina. Granted I&#039;m not against shopping in Manhattan, but when we have such hidden treasures here in our own neighborhood and how Manhattan has &quot;many more viable options&quot;, it makes me wonder if people actually know anything about their own neighborhood.<br /><br />&nbsp;Ok so Steinway may not have the best pickins&#039; for &quot;quality shopping&quot; as you put it, but maybe people who shop here either<br />a) aren&#039;t looking to get quality all the time <br />b) can&#039;t afford it<br />Just explore your neighborhood a little more before saying that all that is available here is &quot;a joke&quot;.

The shop owner was simply wonderful, and always gave a great cut at a very reasonable price. The last time I was there, though (about three months ago), he told me he would be closing the shop and moving to Jackson Heights because the landlord for the shop had boosted his rent to the point where he&#039;d be losing money if he were to stay at his present location - WHERE HE&#039;D BEEN FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS!<br />You would think that a landlord would want to hold on to a long-time tenant who&#039;d been dependably paying rent for twenty years. I know I would! So now the shop has been gated up and vacant for the past three months with NO income for the landlord. All I can say is that that type of thinking on the part of the landlord is stupid and short-sighted. He lost a good dependable tenant - and for a still developing commercial strip like 36th Avenue to have one less successful business on it, it will only discourage other good entrepreneurs to choose the location as a place to start a business.

				Yes in hindsight, my statement about the clothes and shoes selection in Astoria being a &quot;joke&quot; was completely overgeneralized, I will fully admit now.&nbsp; Instead (you&#039;re right), I should have said, <strong>to ME</strong>, shopping in Astoria is a joke.<br /><br />I am not a girly-girl in any way shape or form and do not wear cutesy little boutiquey-type dresses...nor is my style &quot;vintage&quot;.&nbsp; My style is immenesly casual...jeans, sweatshirts, tshirts, etc.&nbsp; However as casual as I am, I will fully admit to being a BIG &#039;ol namebrand snob...Lucky Jeans, Levis, Carhardt, Ralph Lauren/Polo Sport, etc.&nbsp; As for shoes the girliest shoes I own are platform Steve Maddens....but for the most part you can see me rockin&#039; my Uggs, Birkenstocks or Clarks&#039; Wallabees (or &quot;kicks&quot; (sneakers)....Vans, Adidas, etc).&nbsp; As for accessories, I usually have something Hello Kitty (as cutesy as I get) or Paul Frank&#039;s Julius.<br /><br />But my biggest thing is that I won&#039;t pay full retail either (rarely at least).&nbsp; I will usually head for the outlets or more likely, stores like Marshalls or Century 21 or the discount racks at department or retail stores.&nbsp; I would rather have a name brand than something some local designer has manufactured.&nbsp; And to pay a premium for something that&#039;s not a brandname, isn&#039;t my thing either...but again, that&#039;s just me.&nbsp; With my description above, you might be able to see how there is very little in Astoria to my liking.&nbsp; <br /><br />With the exception of my time in college and living abroad, I have lived in Astoria ALL of my life, and have never found Astoria to be a place where I would think about buying clothes (with the exception of the gap, or in jhs when benetton was the place to shop).&nbsp; I think I might have bought something in easy pickins once but that was a total fluke as I was in the 6th grade.&nbsp; Being in this community for as long as I have, I think I am pretty aware of what&#039;s around, and am more likely to spend my money here than anywhere else.&nbsp; But at the same time, for these type of things, I can&#039;t think of one place where I can find something I would want to wear.<br /><br />Shopping for jewelry is an idea though....that could be kinda cool...and something I wouldn&#039;t have normally thought about.&nbsp; And I do agree with you about sales people in some stores...they are pretty clueless sometimes.&nbsp; I find that to be a retail problem in general...not just in Astoria or in a chain store...customer service lacks in a lot of places.&nbsp; And, for the record, I don&#039;t think Foot Locker is necessarily a &quot;quality establishment&quot; but based on my taste, if I am looking for something for my feet, and I don&#039;t feel like going into the city, it is one of the only places in the neighborhood I can go.

				i appreciate the effort put forth by listing all the shopping options on steinway; sad to say that looking at it really provides an overview of how little *variety* there is in the shopping options. as an example: there&#039;s not much for women that falls in between the super-cheap polyester crap that isn&#039;t even all that of the moment (a la pretty girl, cool jeans, and easy pickins) and wayyyy overpriced clubwear. i do like the boutiques that have been listed earlier in the thread; it&#039;s interesting that none of them are on steinway. <br /><br />one thing that also worries me (and further underscores the lack of variety on the strip) is the number of businesses with two outlets that are within a block of one another. two at &amp; t stores, two payless outlets, two rite aids (one&#039;s not on the list because it&#039;s across broadway from the corner where this list starts -- and at least one is going to be vacant within the next few months if the thread about the new rite aid at 34th and steinway is any indication), two sprint stores that are a few storefronts apart from one another! and there are a couple of fabcos as well. surely those outlets are ripe for consolidation soon?&nbsp; <br /><br />that said, i would like to add that madeline hosiery, the corsetiere on steinway and 30th, is GREAT for bras and other foundation garments, a hidden gem that any woman looking for a bra should definitely check out.

				Yeah, I wouldn&#039;t say that Astoria is a prime shopping destination -- especially Steinway. Even the Gap on Steinway, which I would normally browse through, is the worst-stocked Gap I&#039;ve ever been to. <br /><br />There are lots of great things about the neighborhood, but quality shopping is not one of them. Sure, the shops on Steinway serve their purpose for a large part of the population, and yes, there are a few cute stores scattered here and there (not on Steinway), but still, the shopping leaves much to be desired, imo.

				Few of the mom &amp; pop stores have gone, that&#039;s what gave Steinway a unique and pleasant shopping experience. Chain stores and high rents have squeezed all the good store owners out.
