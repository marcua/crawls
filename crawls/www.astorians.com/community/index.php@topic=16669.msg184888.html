								<div class="inner" id="msg_184530">(disturbing article... the Festival was great, btw - in spite of this)<br /><br />by Willow Belden , Editor<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Several people who have been duped out of thousands of dollars are saying that Marie Castaldo, the founder and executive director of the Queens International Film Festival, is a scam artist.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The festival, which opened Nov. 12 in Astoria, is in its seventh year, and numerous individuals who provided labor and equipment the past several years say they weren’t paid and are owed big bucks. According to published news reports, Castaldo, who has a string of aliases, has also been sued for failing to pay workers at a film festival she ran in Narrowsburg, NY in 2000, and for breach of contract after bouncing a $35,000 check for a private party in Los Angeles in 1997.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Castaldo did not respond to repeated requests for comment before the Astoria festival and during the opening ceremony. When reporters from Fox News began questioning her Thursday evening at the opening, she took off running down the block.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Among the individuals and businesses Castaldo allegedly stifted is Ballyhoo Central, a Queens advertising agency which provided programs, posters and other promotional materials for QIFF in 2007.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The president of Ballyhoo, who declined to be named for fear of retribution, said she ended up fronting the majority of the bills at the printer’s and wasn’t reimbursed or paid for her time. The month before the festival, having already shelled out several thousand dollars, she pressed Castaldo for payment.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;“She gave me a sob story that she was going through a nasty divorce and her soon-to-be ex-husband had wiped out her account,” the Ballyhoo president said. “She kept saying she’ll give me a check later. ... It never happened.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Dan Nuxoll, the program director at Rooftop Films, which provided projection equipment to the festival in 2007, had a similar story, though with a lower price tag. Nuxoll said Castaldo promised to pay half of the $2,750 fee they had agreed upon on the first day of the festival and the other half on closing night.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Nuxoll was reluctant to sign up without a down payment but finally agreed, since the festival had a legitimate-looking website, a five-year history in Queens and support from various elected officials.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The first night of the 2007 festival, Nuxoll said, Castaldo told him she had forgotten to bring a check but would pay him the following day. Each day she had another excuse, he said, and on closing night she disappeared. When he tried calling, her voicemail mailbox was full, and eventually the phone was completely disconnected, Nuxoll said.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Nuxoll said he then talked with other member’s of the festival’s supposed advisory board, but many told him they had nothing to do with the festival, and others said they were also having trouble tracking down Castaldo. Nuxoll’s assistant eventually tracked down Castaldo at a restaurant in the city where she worked.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;“She said her father died and she had a nervous breakdown,” Nuxoll said.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eventually, Nuxoll gave up, but the following year he got an email advertising the festival, so he called the number on the website, told the intern who answered the phone his story and asked for Marie. She returned the call at around 1 a.m.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;“She’s furious that I called and is flipping out,” Nuxoll said. “She said: ‘Let me tell this: if you come down here tomorrow, I have some men here who are going to make you regret it.’”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The following morning, she called, apologized and said she’d work out a payment plan, but Nuxoll said the checks never came, and her phone was eventually disconnected again.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Nuxoll isn’t the only person who claims to have been verbally threatened by Castaldo.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;James Hill, the head projectionist at the festival last year, says Castaldo owes him $1,000. Hill said Castaldo agreed on a price — $250 up front, and $1,000 on the final day — but she wouldn’t sign a written contract. By the end of the first two days of work, Hill says he hadn’t seen a cent of money and still didn’t have a contract, so he threatened to quit. Eventually, Castaldo signed his contract and presented him with $250 in cash, but the remaining $1,000 was never paid, hill said.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;A week after the festival ended, Hill called Castaldo and threatened to contact the press if Castaldo didn’t fork over the rest of the money. Castaldo’s husband, Richard Castellano, who was sentenced to a year in prison in 2001 for scamming residents of Monticello, NY out of several thousand dollars, then allegedly called Hill.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;“He gave me veiled threats,” Hill said. “He said: ‘You’re not to talk to anybody. Do you understand that?’”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Hill and Nuxoll told of numerous other “victims,” including one single mother from Erie, PA, who allegedly wired $5,000 to Castaldo and came to New York to work for QIFF, thinking she would be reimbursed and paid an additional $1,000 — only to be left high and dry for the full $6,000.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The ploys appear to be recurring this year. Kerry Wallum, who is in charge of organizing the closing night musical performances and tribute to Levon Helm, said he is owed approximately $15,000. According to Nuxoll, several big-name singers and actors slated to appear on the festival’s final evening were misled by Castaldo and are considering not showing up. That claim could not be verified at print time.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Castaldo also seems to be avoiding reporters. The Chronicle received no press releases or phone calls announcing the festival, and Castaldo did not respond to repeated calls and emails requesting interviews and information prior to opening night.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;On Thursday, about an hour before the festival was set to open, Castaldo flashed a winning smile but said she had to work with her volunteers, so interviews would have to wait. About half an hour later, she said she had to pick up someone, so interviews would still have to wait.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Castaldo didn’t speak — or even appear on stage — during the festival’s opening ceremony. It is unclear whether or not her absence was planned, but in the back of the auditorium, one festival worker whispered to another that some reporters had started asking questions and Castaldo had taken off running.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The reporters, from Fox News, confirmed that when they asked Castaldo about the allegations against her, she took off down the block. They followed her for several blocks and said she denied all queries.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Later in the evening, upon request, an assistant called Castaldo and reported that the festival chief was “in meetings.” She did not reappear at the festival within the next hour and a half.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;It might seem surprising that the alleged con artist would be able to pull off the same scams seven years in a row in Queens. But her self-described victims say she’s just that skilled.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;“She’s good at what she does,” Nuxoll said. “She moves around a lot. ... She moves her venues each time, and she gets different supporters.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The Ballyhoo president said she considered suing Castaldo but has not done so because she fears legal expenses would be prohibitively high.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Hill said he and several colleagues contacted the district attorney last year about pressing charges against Castaldo but were told their claims were too small for the DA to handle. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.zwire.com/site/printerFriendly.cfm?brd=2731&amp;dept_id=574907&amp;newsid=20388240" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.zwire.com/site/printerFriendly.cfm?brd=2731&amp;dept_id=574907&amp;newsid=20388240</a> :?</div>

Hundreds of independent films from around the world would be shown, stars were set to appear on closing night, numerous networking programs were planned and a youth filmmaking project was in the works. Elected officials had endorsed the event, and major news organizations were supposed to cover it. The festival was in its seventh year and was in for another great run.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Or so it seemed.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;But dozens of people involved with QIFF this year and in the past say the person who runs it, Marie Castaldo, is a scam artist and has duped them out of thousands of dollars. Several reported her to the Queens District Attorney’s Office, and others plan to sue.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Those who claim to have lost money to Castaldo include filmmakers, projectionists, ad agencies and institutions providing space for the festival. Many say they were not paid for their services, and some allege that they were conned into giving Castaldo up to $20,000 for film distribution deals which turned out to be phony.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Castaldo, who has a string of aliases, has also been sued for failing to pay workers at a film festival she ran in Narrowsburg, New York in 2000, and for breach of contract after bouncing a $35,000 check for a private party in Los Angeles in 1997, according to published news reports.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The QIFF organization, which bills itself as a nonprofit corporation, is not on the IRS list of tax-exempt entities.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Castaldo did not respond to repeated phone and email requests for comment. On opening night, when reporters questioned her, she took off running down the block and did not return to the festival for the opening ceremony.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;On the festival’s final evening, when asked about the allegations against her, Castaldo grabbed a Queens Chronicle reporter by the arm, told security, “It’s a private event and she’s not allowed,” and rushed out the door. When pressed for comment outside, she said “I am not very happy. I have a press release on its way, and I have no comments.” The press release had not been issued at print time, three days later.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Among the individuals and businesses allegedly stiffed is Kerry Wallum, who was in charge of putting together the closing night festivities this year, including a tribute to musician Levon Helm.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Wallum said he flew up from Texas, expecting to be paid for his services and for the $21,000 he had shelled out for bands and other festival expenses. After he arrived in New York, Castaldo allegedly said she didn’t have the money.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Outraged, Wallum canceled the tribute to Helm, took his bands up to Woodstock and held a concert there instead. The show was a success, he said, but didn’t make up for the thousands of dollars he lost.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;“They’ve tarnished my name, and they’ve done me dirty,” Wallum said of Castaldo and any associates she may have.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Wallum said he plans to sue — and he’s not the only one.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;A New York filmmaker who served on the advisory board of the first QIFF and has worked with Castaldo on and off for the past several years, said he was conned out of $20,000 this summer.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The filmmaker, who wished to remain anonymous as he is negotiating a big movie deal, said Castaldo offered to distribute a film he and his partner had made earlier this year. According to their agreement, the filmmaker allegedly paid Castaldo $20,000, with the understanding that she would take the film to Cannes.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;“She never went to Cannes,” he said. “It was one total ripoff. ... Everything was phony.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Castaldo allegedly tried to convince him that she had been to Cannes, showing him a website with video footage of her there. The filmmaker said he soon discovered that the footage was doctored. The website offers to Photoshop anyone into Cannes, he said.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Before he realized the Cannes trip hadn’t happened, the filmmaker said Castaldo convinced him to enter his movie in the Latino Film Festival in Manhattan. She organized an elaborate party, told him to fly in his actors and had him pay for a private table in the lobby. The money he and fellow filmmakers fronted for the event totaled about $10,000.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;When the festival opened, the filmmaker said, he discovered that his table was shared with five other people, each of whom had paid Castaldo for the same space.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Castaldo allegedly got the filmmaker to give her $700 cash for catering bills — money which he says she pocketed, as she had gotten much of the food for free and “paid” the remainder with a bad check.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;“Oh my God did I get conned,” the filmmaker said. “She’s like a midget Bernie Madoff.” He added that he plans to sue.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Ripping off a single individual for tens of thousands of dollars isn’t necessarily the norm for Castaldo, her self-described “victims” say; often, the sums are much smaller — which is one of the reasons they say she has slid by without lawsuits in Queens for the past seven years.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;A spokeswoman for the Museum of the Moving Image, where the festival was held in 2007, said the institution is owed $3,650. The city’s Department of Education did not respond to inquiries about whether Castaldo has paid for use of the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts, where the festival was held this year.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;James Hill, the head projectionist at QIFF last year, says Castaldo owes him $1,000. She allegedly agreed on a price — $250 up front, and $1,000 on the final day of the festival — but wouldn’t sign a written contract. By the end of the first two days of work, Hill says he hadn’t seen a cent of money and didn’t have a contract, so he threatened to quit. Eventually, Castaldo presented him with $250 in cash, but the remaining $1,000 was never paid, he said.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;A week after the festival ended, Hill threatened to contact the press if Castaldo didn’t fork over the rest of the money. He soon got a call from her ex-husband, Richard Castellano, who was sentenced to a year in prison in 2001 for scamming residents of Monticello, New York out of several thousand dollars.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;“He gave me veiled threats,” Hill said. “He said: ‘You’re not to talk to anybody. Do you understand that?’”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Others also claim to have been threatened.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Dan Nuxoll, the program director at Rooftop Films, which provided projection equipment to the festival in 2007, said his company is owed $2,750.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The first day of the festival, Castaldo allegedly told him she had forgotten to bring a check. Each day she had another excuse, Nuxoll said, and on closing night she disappeared. When he tried calling, her voicemail box was full, and eventually the phone was disconnected.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Nuxoll then talked with other member’s of the festival’s supposed advisory board, but, he recalls, many told him they had nothing to do with the festival, and others said they were also having trouble tracking down Castaldo. Nuxoll’s assistant eventually found her at a restaurant in the city where she worked.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;“She said her father died and she had a nervous breakdown,” Nuxoll said.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eventually, Nuxoll gave up, but the following year he got an email advertising the festival, so he called the number on the website, told the intern who answered the phone his story and asked for Marie. She returned the call at around 1 a.m.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;“She’s furious that I called and is flipping out,” Nuxoll said. “She said, ‘Let me tell you this: if you come down here tomorrow, I have some men here who are going to make you regret it.’”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The following morning, she apologized and said she’d work out a payment plan, but Nuxoll said the checks never came, and her phone was eventually disconnected again.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;It’s unclear how many people have been left high and dry after this year’s QIFF. Some of the festival workers, including the projectionists and the couple running the youth initiative, are volunteers and were never promised compensation. Some, including one box office worker, say they have been paid. One individual, who described himself as Castaldo’s second in command, said he has worked with her for three years and has never had problems.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Many of the filmmakers whose work was showcased also said they were pleased with the festival, praising the films and networking events.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Others say they feel QIFF was poorly organized and made false promises about the nature of screenings and film advertisements. At least eight DVDs were lost, leading to last-minute cancellations in screenings.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;One filmmaker said the screening of his film was unacceptably amateurish.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;“The screening room was just a hotel conference room with a bunch of chairs,” he said. “A tiny projector was set in the front of the room and the screen was smaller than a widescreen TV. ... I came all the way from Japan for the special event and am so embarrassed since I brought a lot of media attention in Japan.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Howard Nash, a filmmaker from Fresh Meadows, said sub-par screenings aren’t new this year. Nash said the projection machine broke on the day his movie, “PJ,” was set to be shown at the 2008 festival.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;“This is every filmmaker’s worst nightmare,” he said. “I was mortified.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Nash added that the equipment QIFF was using seemed “like 1990s Walmart home DVD players from God knows where.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;QIFF staff never apologized, he said.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Concerns weren’t limited to technical problems, though.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The filmmaker from Japan said he paid $100 for the festival’s “filmmaker package,” which was supposed to give him four all-access passes, 20 screening passes for guests, a link on the QIFF website and a one-third-page ad in the festival’s program. The program was never printed.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Another filmmaker named David Wenzel said he also sold 15 ads to local businesses, which were supposed to appear in the nonexistent QIFF program.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;“These are businesses in Astoria,” he said. “I go to their restaurants all the time. I have to face them every day.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;It might seem surprising that the alleged con artist would be able to pull off the same scams seven years in a row in Queens. But her self-described victims say she’s just that skilled.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;“She’s good at what she does,” Nuxoll said. “She moves around a lot. ... She moves her venues each time, and she gets different supporters.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The filmmaker who was allegedly conned into the $20,000 distribution deal agreed, adding that Castaldo often plays the victim to get money out of people.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;“She comes into a meeting, she starts out with a nice business plan and then she will talk about being victimized by her last festival,” he said.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Others who claim to have lost money to Castaldo say she told “sob stories,” claiming to be going through a nasty divorce or saying she was disfigured in an auto accident.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Castaldo has been in court elsewhere in New York but so far seems to have escaped being sued in Queens.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Hill and the president of Ballyhoo Central, a Queens advertising agency which is allegedly owed more than $8,000 for programs, posters and other promotional materials it provided to QIFF in 2007, both said they contacted the district attorney’s office last year about possible legal action.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;A spokeswoman confirmed that several people have come to the DA about Castaldo but said, “None of it rises to a criminal level. ... If you work for somebody, and they owe you money ... that’s a matter for civil court.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The Ballyhoo president, who declined to be named for fear of retribution, said she hasn’t gone to court because she fears legal expenses would be prohibitively high.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;It looks as though Castaldo may be facing charges soon, though — if she hasn’t skipped town.</div>

If the festival isn&#039;t a scam it&#039;s at least poorly organized, my screening was going on the same time as a screening 10 feet away across the hall, that had a screening in that room just before so of course that was packed. Now after reading those articles I&#039;m unsure if I should feel upset or duped/angry.</div>
