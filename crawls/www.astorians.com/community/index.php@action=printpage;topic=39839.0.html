				I read an article that said citibike in astoria would begin 9/12/17.&nbsp; There were supposed to be bikes on crescent and ditmars.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see anything.&nbsp; I&#039;m wondering if they changed their minds about using that location.&nbsp; Does anyone know?

				Yeah it&#039;s not a bad thing.&nbsp; Maybe we will never see these bikes.&nbsp; They are not needed in Astoria.&nbsp; I doubt many people will be using them.&nbsp; These are for tourists.&nbsp; Most people who ride have their own bikes.

				The only place I&#039;ve seen them is right near the entrance to the 59th Street Bridge, which is really LIC.

				The locations for the Astoria/CB1 bike stations was finalized and published at the end of July. The plan was to <em>start</em> installation of the stations in September and complete by the end of the year. Bike stations are also being expanded in LIC, Harlem, Crown Heights and Prospect Heights.<br /><br /><br /><br />http://a841-tfpweb.nyc.gov/bikeshare/2017/07/28/final-map-released-for-bike-share-expansion-in-astoria-queens-cb1/<br /><br /><br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2017/pr17-065.shtml
