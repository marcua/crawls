				33rd street, right off of Ditmars Blvd. by the Key Food parking lot...anyone try it yet?&nbsp; I walked by last night but it was too late for a coffee for me.&nbsp; The place looks really cool and they have a Japanese style slow drip coffee contraption that I&#039;m looking forward to trying.&nbsp;

				I know the owners and was invited in this week to take photos of the cafe and try the coffee. The space is lovely and the coffee is delicious. Their soft opening is today from 4-7pm.<br /><br /><br />http://weheartastoria.com/2014/07/a-sneak-peek-at-ok-coffee-a-new-cafe-coming-to-the-ditmars-area/

				&nbsp;This places is great!&nbsp; I stopped in yesterday for a Kyoto cold brew (the type that uses the fancy contraption) and today I popped in for the New Orleans style cold brew which was also really good.&nbsp; Yesterday I also had a pain au chocolat and it was lovely.<br /><br /><br />It&#039;s nice to have a locally-owned place in the &#039;hood for my morning coffee.&nbsp; :)

				Tried this place today, and was so charmed by the decor, the latte and the nice service. Was pleased that even though it&#039;s small, there were even some spots to sit with my laptop and work a while -- the staff even brought me a glass of ice water and offered me the wi-fi password. I&#039;ve been spending a lot of time at NY Bagel &amp; Coffee and have been so thrilled to have that, but this is kind of a pleasant, quiet, lower-key alternative. They didn&#039;t have much in the way of pastries and things to eat when I was there -- but everything else was so solid, and I imagine things will just be getting better. Very happy to have this in the &#039;hood!

				I&#039;m curious to know if the opening of Caffe Bene has hurt the business of OK Cafe.&nbsp; I noticed that they put out a chalk board with specials to attract customers.&nbsp; They didnt&#039; have those specials listed before

Just on the Ditmars side of the corner of the building. Originally it was just there to let people know it existed. But they have since put various specials on the board.

				<br />No way would OK Café &#039;lose&#039; customers simply cuz Bene moved in&nbsp; around the corner.&nbsp; &nbsp;If anything, the only reason they&#039;d &#039;lose&#039; customers would be due to their small size and fact they can&#039;t accommodate many people size wise.&nbsp; But if folks are looking for indie coffeehouse ambiance, OK Café and Bene are in two totally different categories.&nbsp; I would always pick OK over a chain place like Bene....
