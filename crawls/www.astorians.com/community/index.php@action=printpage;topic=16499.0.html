				The Astoria Moms Meetup Group would love to see you at our Second Annual Clothing Swap/Bake Sale!<br /><br />Entrance is FREE with clothes/baked goods, $5 without.<br /><br />• Baby, toddler, and kids’ clothes are welcomed... Maternity clothes are appreciated... Gently used toys and books would be a treat!<br /><br />• This year, we are pleased to be donating all the proceeds from our sale to the Steinway Reformed Church! The church donates space to our group as well as many other organizations in our neighborhood.<br /><br />• Everyone participating is asked to bake at least one treat, serving 10-20 people. It can be anything—cookies, breads, brownies, muffins, cupcakes, etc... be creative, use what you have! Original recipes are preferred, but boxed mix items are welcomed as well (no ready made treats, please).<br /><br />• Everyone baking is asked to make a sign for their treat with the ingredients clearly listed (for allergy concerns).<br /><br />• You don’t have to be the one to bake! If you don’t have a nose for cooking/baking, anyone in your family can help—husbands, grandmas, aunts, uncles, etc.<br /><br />• Everything doesn’t have to be a sweet. You can go savory and sugar free, as well. No “main course” food or appetizers, please.<br /><br />• Sweets and treats can be individually wrapped or served “a la carte.” Napkins, plates, and baggies will be provided at the site, or you can wrap your treats in advance.<br /><br />• Please spread the word! The swap/sale will be open to everyone in the community!<br /><br />If you&#039;d like to contribute to the bake sale or swap, email mrscunning14@gmail.com.<br /><br />Hope to see you there!
