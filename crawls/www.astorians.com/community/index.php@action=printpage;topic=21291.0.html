				My cat got out of my apartment on 36th St between Ditmars and 23rd yesterday (6/5) morning. He&#039;s very large with long orange fur and green eyes. He&#039;s very friendly with people and chatty. He&#039;s not wearing a collar, but his name is Catticus. <br /><br />Please call or text me at 904 434 2128 if you&#039;ve seen him, even if he&#039;s not there anymore so I can get an idea of where to look.<br />(http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j71/lisaherring/DSC00652.jpg)

				Still missing. I&#039;m offering a reward to anyone who has information that leads to me finding him. I believe he may also be hiding in a basement, garage, or shed.

				After frantically searching the area for 5 days at all hours of the night I got a call from neighbors across the street that he was in their yard and had been coming by for a few days. Presumably he was yards away the entire time. He was pretty shaken up and dirty when I brought him home, but he seems to have adjusted by now. Ultimately, the thing that ended up working was just relentless flyering.<br /><br />I also have to say the amount of people that called offering info was astounding. There are some really great people in this neighborhood.

				I am so happy that you&#039;ve found your kitty! I don&#039;t know what I would do if either of mine were lost - I would be a wreck.&nbsp; :sad:
