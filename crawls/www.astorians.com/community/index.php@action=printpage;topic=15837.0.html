				Hey fellow Astorians,<br /><br />A question here:<br /><br />I moved into my current place seven years ago.&nbsp; At that time I signed a lease and paid a security deposit of one month&#039;s rent like most people do.&nbsp; I&#039;ve stayed on since then without renewing the lease and all has been well - have had a good relationship with my landlords, who own and live in my small building.<br /><br />I&#039;m moving this month and wondering whether or not I&#039;m likely to be able to get that security back (minus, of course, any charges for wear and tear I incurred over the time I&#039;ve spent here).&nbsp; Am I still entitled to it despite the lease having expired some time ago?&nbsp; Any advice would be appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks!

				Yes - we had a similar situation when we moved from our old place earlier this year. Hadn&#039;t been on a lease in years, but we promptly got our deposit back without even having to ask.

				Yes, you are definitely entitled (and not only to the return of your deposit, but also to interest if the building has more than six units), but that doesn&#039;t mean it will be easy. <br /><br />When you move out, take a lot of pictures of the apartment and if at all possible, do a walkthrough with the landlord before handing over the keys. Give them your new address to send it to. The landlord has 30-60 days to return your deposit. After 30 days, you could send a polite letter inquiring as to the return of the deposit. After 60 days, you should contact the Attorney General&#039;s office and file a rent security complaint form--they&#039;ll do most of the work beyond that. If they don&#039;t return the full deposit, they owe you a list of damage and cost to repair, and if they don&#039;t give you that list within 60 days you are owed the full deposit regardless of damage. <br /><br />I&#039;ve always had my deposit returned, but I&#039;ve always had to follow up, be persistent, and show that I know my rights. Some landlords are shady and some are lazy or busy and forgetful, but if you stay on top of it and be polite, you should easily get your deposit back.

				Ah, now that&#039;s some sage advice as well.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I will do as you suggested and take full photos of the space when I move to document what&#039;s going on.&nbsp; They&#039;ve been perfectly lovely but I&#039;m not assuming things are going to go smoothly where money&#039;s concerned and I want to cover my bases.&nbsp; Your advice helps me with that, so thank you.&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:

				As for this part:<br /><br />&nbsp;&quot;(minus, of course, any charges for wear and tear I incurred over the time I&#039;ve spent here). &quot;<br /><br />I don&#039;t know exactly what the tenant laws are, but I&#039;m fairly certain that you&#039;re entitled to the full security deposit despite normal wear and tear. The landlord cannot withhold any of your money for things like paint jobs, normal amount of wear &amp; tear on the floors, minor things like that. If the wall is bashed in, or there&#039;s fire damage in the kitchen or something, that&#039;s another story.

				An update here: I spoke with my landlord yesterday and he said he would definitely give me my security back.&nbsp; But I&#039;m going to follow the advice above and photo-document everything as I leave just to cover the bases.&nbsp; Thanks to you all for your sage advice.

				The best way to ensure you get your money back is to just not pay the last months rent.&nbsp; Speaking of which, I ran into a rent issue with my landlord and didn&#039;t do what I suggested and wish I did.&nbsp; He is holding half of the rent because he spent my deposit on his trip to Italy.&nbsp; I am not sure whether to file or wait here, so I am currently seeking legal advice.

				I agree with this.&nbsp; I do have a question though on what you would do:<br /><br />We moved out of Astoria and we couldn&#039;t give the landlord month notice, so he said he would only give us &quot;half&quot; our security deposit back.&nbsp; We moved out, the place was in better condition when we left than when we arrived.&nbsp; Our lease ended and we werent notified of a new lease agreement or anything.&nbsp; Obviously the landlord is bitter as he cannot find any renters as the place is a dump and he does not take care of it so he is trying to keep half of our security deposit.&nbsp; How would you handle this?&nbsp; Who do I go to? Where do I go to?

				I believe when your lease ends, you in effect go into month to month tenancy, meaning that either party (you or the landlord) can cancel the lease with 1 months notice.&nbsp; By not giving a months notice, you actually give up your right to the security deposit.&nbsp; The fact that he gave you half of the notice, well I&#039;d say you were lucky.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=15837.msg180265#msg180265">Quote from: brodch01 on August 28, 2009, 03:23:44 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I agree with this.&nbsp; I do have a question though on what you would do:<br /><br />We moved out of Astoria and we couldn&#039;t give the landlord month notice, so he said he would only give us &quot;half&quot; our security deposit back.&nbsp; We moved out, the place was in better condition when we left than when we arrived.&nbsp; Our lease ended and we werent notified of a new lease agreement or anything.&nbsp; Obviously the landlord is bitter as he cannot find any renters as the place is a dump and he does not take care of it so he is trying to keep half of our security deposit.&nbsp; How would you handle this?&nbsp; Who do I go to?

Legally, the landlord now has a right to keep your security deposit because you breached your lease and has the right to report you to a collections agency to get back that last month&#039;s rent. The rent and the security deposit are two separate agreements. I would really caution anyone against this since your credit rating could end up suffering.

				Thank you for the advice, first thing though is I didn&#039;t breach my lease.&nbsp; It was agreed upon that we were only living there for 1 year, hence why we signed a 1 year lease.&nbsp; Also, the monthly agreement is not in any writing on the lease.&nbsp;

In localities without rent regulations, tenants who stay past the end of a lease are treated as month-to-month tenants if the landlord accepts their rent. (Real Property Law § 232-c) <br /><br />A month-to-month tenancy outside New York City may be terminated by either party by giving at least one month&#039;s notice before the expiration of the term. For example, if the rent is due on the first of each month, the landlord must inform the tenant by September 30th before the October rent is due that he wants the tenant to move out by November 1st. The termination notice need not specify why the landlord seeks possession of the apartment. Such notice does not automatically allow the landlord to evict the tenant. A landlord may raise the rent of a month-to-month tenant with the consent of the tenant. If the tenant does not consent, however, the landlord can terminate the tenancy by giving appropriate notice. (Real Property Law § 232-b) <br /><br />In New York City, the landlord must serve the tenant with a written termination giving 30 days notice before the expiration of the term. The notice must state that the landlord elects to terminate the tenancy and that refusal to vacate will lead to eviction proceedings. (Real Property Law § 232-a)</em> <br /><br /><br />Also, without a lease you have very little protection from the landlord jacking up the rent for no reason<br /><br /><br />http://www.housingnyc.com/html/resources/faq/leases.html#month<br /><br /><strong><em>I don&#039;t have a lease, so I am a month-to-month tenant - what are the allowable rent increases? </em></strong> <br /><br /><em>You may want to double-check with the NY State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR), the state agency which administers the rent laws, at 718-739-6400, to see if your apartment is rent stabilized. If you rent a stabilized unit, your landlord must offer you a lease. Your rent cannot increase until you receive a lease, and may only increase according to the annual rent guideline increases voted on by the Rent Guidelines Board. Information of rent increases can be found here.<br /><br />If you are not a stabilized tenant, there is no limitation on the amount of rent increases. If you have no lease, or if your lease has expired, you are considered a &quot;month-to-month&quot; tenant. According to the NYS Attorney General&#039;s Office, a New York City landlord may raise the rent of a month-to-month tenant with the consent of the tenant. However, if the tenant does not consent, the landlord can terminate the tenancy by giving appropriate notice (Real Property Law ß232-b). Further details are available in the New York State Attorney General&#039;s Tenant&#039;s Rights Guide section on Month-to-Month tenancy.</em>
