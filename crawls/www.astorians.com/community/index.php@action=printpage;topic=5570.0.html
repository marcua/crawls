				MIAMI â€” A man who reportedly jumped from a cruise ship off Florida&#039;s coast early today was rescued eight hours later by the Coast Guard. The 24-year-old man ran through a Carnival Cruise Lines ship cabin window and fell into the water off Fort Lauderdale, a witness told Coast Guard Petty Officer Dana Warr. It was unclear whether the window was open at the time.<br /><br />The witness said the man was intoxicated, Warr said.<br /><br />The man waved his arms at crews when he was spotted at about 8:45 a.m., Coast Guard Petty Officer Jennifer Johnson said. She said he was airlifted to a hospital, but she didn&#039;t know his condition.<br /><br />The man was aboard the Carnival Glory, which operates out of Port Canaveral east of Orlando, according to the cruise company&#039;s Web site.<br /><br />The cruise ship alerted authorities at 12:45 a.m. The ship and another cruise nearby stayed to assist with the search but have since left the area, Warr said.<br /><br />Carnival spokesman Tim Gallagher confirmed the Coast Guard report but said no additional details were immediately available.
