				Hi - What is the opinion of the Steinway/23rd Ave area? I found an apartment there I like very much, but I&#039;m not sure about the neighborhood. I live off 36th ave now and want desperately to move to the Ditmars area. Really, I&#039;m interested if it&#039;s relatively quiet. It&#039;s a big apartment, renovated and very nice, but I don&#039;t know if I should wait and see if something else comes up. I really hate decisions!&nbsp; &nbsp;:lol: Thanks so much!

				I have friends who used to live in that area and it never seemed out of the ordinary to me - even late at night.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s also nice that it&#039;s only a block from Ditmars!

				23rd Ave up by 31st St is becoming quite the bustling hotspot, with tons of restaurants opening up and some bars.&nbsp; Besides the pigeon infested amtrak train tracks, it&#039;s a nice area to be around.

				I live around there- nice section of town, quiet at night, really close to Ditmars.&nbsp; Stay in your place long enough to see how loud the trains are inside before you sign the lease!

				I&#039;m on 37th st and 23rd ave, right next to the train. Literally my bedroom window is 20 feet from the trestle, and the train never bothers me. It sounds like a Mack truck going by for 10 seconds a couple times a day, no big deal at all. I think Steinway/23rd Ave is fine, certainly going south a couple blocks from Ditmars it&#039;s a little &quot;grittier&quot; for lack of a better word, with some empty storefronts and not-as-nicely manicured homes, but I never feel unsafe. My vet is down there. I think it&#039;s a great area. Plus if you have kids there&#039;s a playground right there.

				Thank you for your replies. I signed the lease today, so I&#039;ll be moving up there soon!

				Its a cursed corner in that the store fronts on each corner of the intersection have been unoccupied, some of them for years.
