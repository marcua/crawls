				I think&nbsp; this show is brilliant in its simplicity. Favorite so far: &quot;If that&#039;s what you&#039;re into&quot; followed by a close second &quot;most beautiful girl in the room&quot;<br /><br />But I know lots of people that don&#039;t &quot;get&quot; it.

				YES! So glad to have fellow FOTC-lovers on the board!&nbsp; I am constantly on youtube trying to search for unseen episodes or clips or anything I can get. Their random humor is exactly what I look for, and I love that not everyone &quot;gets&quot; it as well... because generic comedy gets kinda old. yayyy Bret &amp; Jermaine!&nbsp; :mrgreen: :lol:

				I like the episode where Bret is harrassed by the woman he&#039;s dating. nice role-reversals. <br /><br />Germaine: &quot;You don&#039;t want to show so much skin, she&#039;ll think you want to sleep with her.&quot; <br /><br />(bret changes) <br /><br />Germaine: OK, but you need to show a little skin to keep her interested.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Question for all you Flight of the Conchords fans. I just signed up for Net Flix and put season one in my que. There is apparently a long wait for this disc. Is it imperative that we start with season one in order to follow the series? I am dying to see it- but bummed about waiting. Would I be lost if we started on Season 2? <br /><br />Thanks!

				My bad. There is only one season. For some reason on my netflix queue it is broken down as season 1, disc one is not available but season 1 disc 2 is? I guess I will just wait for season 1, disc 1. <br /><br />
