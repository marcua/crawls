				Happy birthday Charles Darwin!<br /><br />CHARLES ROBERT DARWIN<br />February 12, 1809 to April 19, 1882<br /><br />Darwin&#39;s 200th Birthday will occur on February 12, 2009; it will also be the 150th Anniversary of the publication of his famous book, On The Origin of Species. So, together we can evolve a truly international Celebration to express gratitude for the enormous benefits that scientific knowledge, acquired through human curiosity and ingenuity, has contributed to the advancement of humanity. The objective of Darwin Day Celebration is to encourage existing institutions worldwide, such as municipalities, public and private schools, colleges and universities, libraries, museums, churches, private organizations and individuals to celebrate Science and Humanity every year, on, or near, February 12, Darwin&#39;s birthday!<br /><br />http://www.darwinday.org/<br /><br />Evolution Sunday (http://www.butler.edu/clergyproject/rel_evol_sun2007.htm) just happened, too.

				Dumbing down evolution to kill it. (http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-oe-humes12feb12,0,7128781.story)<br /><br />As a kid learning about evolution in the 70s, I never though that evolution would become such a political issue, polarizing people like it does today (quote from the article: &quot;...teachers across the nation tell me they feel compelled to downplay or skip evolution lessons to avoid controversy; one L.A.-area high school instructor said she is the only one of five science teachers on her faculty to even mention evolution in class, notwithstanding a clear state mandate to teach it.&quot;).&nbsp; I always took it in as legitimate, as solid science.&nbsp; The first time I met someone who rejected evolution and genuinely believed in creationism was when I was in my 30s, from a young man raised in rural northern Texas who came from a fundamentalist religious home.&nbsp; I don&#39;t believe that one must pick religion over science or vice-versa; I&#39;ve known scientists who go to church or synagogue, and religious people who find evolution to be real, solid, and truth. And, just to be clear, intelligent design doesn&#39;t appeal to me.&nbsp; From the article:<br /><br />&quot;Real evolutionary theory explains how life forms change across generations by passing on helpful traits to their offspring; a process that, after millions of years, gradually transforms one species into another. This does not happen randomly but through nature&#39;s tendency to reward the most successful organisms and to kill the rest. This is why germs grow resistant to antibiotics and why some turtles are sea animals and others survive quite nicely in the desert, and why dinosaurs — and more than 99% of all other species that have ever lived on Earth — are extinct.<br /><br />&quot;The environment changes. The recipe for survival changes with it. And life changes to keep up — or it dies. Darwin&#39;s signature insight is both brilliant and elegantly, brutally simple.<br /><br />&quot;The real theory of evolution does not try to explain how life originated — that remains a mystery.The truth is that many scientists accept evolution and believe in God — and in a natural world so complete that it strives toward perfection all on its own, without need of a supernatural designer to keep it going.&quot;<br />

				Oh, and in case it wasn&#39;t clear, I believe strongly in evolution and that it should be taught in the schools.

				Kansas Board Boosts Evolution Education (http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17132925/)<br /><br />Updated: 9:16 p.m. ET Feb 13, 2007<br /><br />TOPEKA, Kan. - The Kansas state Board of Education on Tuesday repealed science guidelines questioning evolution that had made the state an object of ridicule.<br /><br />The new guidelines reflect mainstream scientific views of evolution and represent a political defeat for advocates of “intelligent design,” who had helped write the standards that are being jettisoned.
