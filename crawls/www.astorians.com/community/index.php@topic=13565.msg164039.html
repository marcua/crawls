								<div class="inner" id="msg_163910">OK, so this whole process has gotten me a little bummed to say the least.&nbsp; The dog is proving to be a back-breaker.&nbsp; There are actually tons of availabilities in the exact size, price, location, everything that I&#039;m looking at.&nbsp; But they don&#039;t take dogs and there&#039;s nothing I can do to convince them otherwise.<br /><br />I actually had a pretty lengthy talk with George at Halvatzis Realty yesterday.&nbsp; He seems to be a very honest and experienced guy.&nbsp; Anyway, he said that landlords only now are starting to warm up to the idea of a dog and it&#039;s only because they know they can get away with charging more rent trying to take advantage of Manhattaners moving into the area.&nbsp; This mentality is more prevalent among the newer generation of landlords as the older generation is still fixated on renting to local Queens residents who typically don&#039;t have dogs.&nbsp; (What can I say?&nbsp; Perhaps more Manhattaners have pets because they are more lonely and most have no families in the area?)&nbsp; Either way, I understand both mentalities and don&#039;t necessarily appreciate Manhattaners (me included) &quot;gentrifying&quot; the area.&nbsp; I specifically love Queens (as opposed to Brooklyn) for its ethnic diversity and don&#039;t enjoy more &quot;yuppy&quot;-type settings.<br /><br />In general, units that I&#039;ve found in the Broadway/30th Ave area are much smaller and much more run down.&nbsp; Nothing seems to meet my space requirement and most of them don&#039;t take dogs anyway.&nbsp; Lastly, quite a few sources, including locals in the area, have informed me about a widespread bed bug infestation in this area that seems to be spreading rampantly.&nbsp; Yuck.<br /><br />Moving on: the units that I have found that will accept dogs that meet my criteria are REALLY far from the subway.&nbsp; The brokers keep telling me it&#039;s a &quot;10 minute walk.&quot;&nbsp; Well, I walked it several times.&nbsp; It&#039;s either the longest 10 minutes in history or it&#039;s closer to 20 minutes each way (according to my stop watch anyway).&nbsp; It&#039;s not so much of a concern for me, but my wife has got a really lengthy commute to her workplace in Manhattan in this case.&nbsp; She tells me she&#039;ll be fine with it, but I know she&#039;s saying that to make me feel better.&nbsp; I found one unit that fits all my criteria except distance to transportation (15 minute walk) but it&#039;s smack dab next to Con Ed, which makes me feel very very uneasy.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I can in good conscience say that I feel comfortable staring at smoke stacks out of my window especially when I work from home and will have to look at it all day long.&nbsp; On a side note: I don&#039;t want to freak anybody out, but I did some research on the Con Ed plant and it&#039;s actually a little bit frightening.&nbsp; Not only does it generate tons of electricity and blatantly violate all air pollution standards (by a lot), but it also is a storage and transfer hub for highly dangerous and hazardous toxic waste material.&nbsp; You can read all about the local government petitions to reduce this activity (to no avail) online.&nbsp; I somehow think that if I lived on the east side of 31st Ave, I can have some more peace of mind because I don&#039;t have to look at it 24/7 (ignorance is bliss, right?).<br /><br />It&#039;s also important to note that landlords seem to be adamant about staying firm with their pricing +/- $50 per month.&nbsp; They don&#039;t think the economic recession will affect their property (and pricing) or at least are taking a very conservative &quot;wait and see&quot; approach.&nbsp; I&#039;ve run into quite a few owners who would rather have a vacant space, in some cases for a couple of months now, hoping to rent it at a much higher price.&nbsp; I even ran into an owner who seemingly wanted to get in a fight when I asked him about how long the listing had been on the market.&nbsp; Not only was he ultra defensive about the price and vacancy, he immediately retorted with the fact that he &quot;takes great care&quot; of the unit, has his own set of bills to pay, and &quot;doesn&#039;t want to rent it out anyway.&quot;&nbsp; He forced upon an application that he basically filled out by himself on behalf of me (although I never said I wanted the unit, especially because it was too small and more expensive than I thought it was worth by at least $300/mo) and told me to go home and fax it back to him that night.<br /><br />I&#039;ve started to re-think my strategy a little bit and am considering staying in Manhattan now.&nbsp; 1) There are significantly more places that allow dogs -- again, this has really proven to be the biggest obstacle in my search thus far.&nbsp; 2) There are some pretty great deals out there with tons of wiggle room to negotiate as brokers tell me it&#039;s an &quot;extremely soft market.&quot;&nbsp; 3)&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for distance to transportation that&#039;s &quot;reasonable&quot; so that my wife can more easily commute to work.&nbsp; In order to save money, I&#039;m considering living on the Upper East Side (ugh, that&#039;s always been absolutely the last place in NYC that I want to live) and doing a reverse commute to Astoria to do all of my grocery shopping and dining.&nbsp; Of course, and I say this with all sincerity, this leaves me extremely heartbroken.&nbsp; My wife and I have been really excited about the move for some time now, we&#039;ve spent a lot of time getting to know the neighborhoods.<br /><br />That being said, I will continue looking in Astoria earnestly until the 22nd.&nbsp; I know a lot more listings are coming up after the 15th, so I&#039;m encouraged by that.&nbsp; I know that there are tons of listings out there that fit my criteria.&nbsp; Again, it&#039;s the @#%^!# dog (I somehow find myself secretly and ashamedly resenting the poor fella more so everyday).&nbsp; If I don&#039;t find something by the 22nd, I will probably resort to staying in Manhattan.<br /><br />I also thought I should mention that I have, indeed, met the gamut of Brokers.<br /><br />Kim at Halvatzis is decent so far and is willing to take the time to listen.<br /><br />I just called Richard at R&amp;R and he seems to be responsive.<br /><br />I met a woman at Page who seemed to be awesome except she didn&#039;t have any listings.<br /><br />Mike at Astoria Park is definitely a little pushy and tries to get you to pull the trigger on an impulse buy.<br /><br />Jenny at Avangard tends to bend the truth quite a bit.&nbsp; She tells a bunch of &quot;white lies&quot; to convince you to go with her.<br /><br />I called Eleni but worked with her partner, Carl, instead.&nbsp; He is by far the most arrogant, completely egotistical broker that I&#039;ve ever met.&nbsp; It&#039;s funny because I never thought I&#039;d say this: to top it all off, he smells really bad and his car wreaks of stale, greasy takeout.&nbsp; He should definitely consider losing weight because his car is about to cave in when he drives; I don&#039;t think cars of that size can handle that type of capacity.&nbsp; Oh, if you ever meet him, he&#039;ll also go on and on about his &quot;glory days&quot; as a top level executive at various Fortune 100 companies, his ability to sell you sand in a desert, and he&#039;ll also try and pry as much personal info from you as possible.&nbsp; Seriously, what a sleeze.<br /><br />Chris, Orly, Chantal, Marie, and Laurie never got back to me with a listing, so either I can&#039;t comment on them or it says something about their service.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_164032">I told myself I&#039;d take a break today so I&#039;m canceling all of my appointments.&nbsp; I&#039;ve basically been going from viewing to viewing for 6-8 hours a day now for the past 5 days so it&#039;s starting to wear a little on me, especially since commuting back and forth has been a real strain (I live all the way downtown in Soho right now, so riding the N/R/W line has never felt longer).&nbsp; <br /><br />Carl&#039;s partner called today and I told her: &quot;I&#039;d rather give my broker fee to a guy on the street than to her partner.&quot;&nbsp; She apologized and said that she appreciated the feedback.&nbsp; She asked if I&#039;d consider working with her and I told her that I would as long as Carl doesn&#039;t receive a dime of my money if I choose to rent through her.<br /><br />I saw two decent places last night both in the Ditmars area.&nbsp; There&#039;s one place under construction.&nbsp; They&#039;re asking $1,800 with no utilities included (I have to pay for heat, water, gas, and electric).&nbsp; It&#039;s located close to Ditmars and pretty close to the subway, which is cool.&nbsp; But there&#039;s a very VERY small kitchen.&nbsp; When I say small, I mean you can&#039;t stand in the kitchen and cook at the same time.&nbsp; You literally have to stand outside of the kitchen to use the stove.&nbsp; It&#039;s kind of funny but if you open the refrigerator door, you can&#039;t be in the kitchen at all.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think the owner thought about the logistics of the layout.&nbsp; Oh well.<br /><br />The other place has a HUGE kitchen, the biggest one I&#039;ve ever seen in Astoria and has OK sized room, including a so-so sized living room (definitely on the smaller side).&nbsp; But it has zero closets, not a single one.&nbsp; And it has the ugliest, most depressing carpeting that I&#039;ve ever seen throughout the entire apartment.&nbsp; In order for this to work, I&#039;d have to turn the smaller bedroom that I&#039;d otherwise use as an office into a closet.&nbsp; The bathroom is located in the kitchen.&nbsp; There are no light fixtures at all, meaning that the room can only be lit using lamps plugged into the wall, which isn&#039;t the end of the world.&nbsp; It&#039;s located across the street from two abandoned buildings.&nbsp; Yay.&nbsp; It&#039;s also 15 minutes to the subway, which is fine.&nbsp; By default, I think this is probably my best bet thus far.<br /><br />Overall thoughts thus far: it&#039;s been so long since I&#039;ve looked for an apartment that I forgot how stressful the entire process is.&nbsp; I find myself constantly doubting whether I&#039;ll ever find anything decent or if I&#039;m better off just staying put.&nbsp; Sometimes at viewings, I get wrapped up and obsessed with a place even if it sucks.&nbsp; Only a day later can I objectify the unit and look at it from a more realistic perspective.<br /><br />For example, last night I was ready to put my money down on the unit with the tiny kitchen.&nbsp; I really had convinced myself that we would be living there.&nbsp; In fact, I think I was ready to put in an application even though the unit was still under construction and was at least 2 weeks at best from being done.&nbsp; I&#039;m not even sure if it will be ready in time, quite honestly.&nbsp; I talked about it with my wife for a while and she told me that I needed to take a step back and relax.&nbsp; This morning, I realized that that unit just makes no sense.&nbsp; I cook a lot.&nbsp; Part of the reason we&#039;re moving to Astoria is to save money.&nbsp; And the only way to do that is to eat at home.&nbsp; So if I&#039;m going to cook a lot (which I will be), then it only makes sense to have a place where the kitchen is at least usable.<br /><br />Anyway, it&#039;s nice to be taking a day off.&nbsp; It will certainly give me some perspective on the whole process and situation.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_164039">Oh, I will comment on this:<br /><br />The pricing in Astoria doesn&#039;t seem to be all that advantageous at all especially when compared to a soft Manhattan market.<br /><br />Asking prices for 1 bedrooms in decent areas in Manhattan run the same price as small two bedrooms that require a hike to get to the subway in Astoria (due to having a pet).<br /><br />Astoria landlords are staying firm with their high prices while Manhattan landlords are willing to negotiate as much as 20% off a month&#039;s rent.&nbsp; Think about it: that&#039;s a LOT of wiggle room.<br /><br />Reasons to stay in Manhattan (1 bedroom):<br />Most places accept pets (and don&#039;t charge/want something extra)<br />Building and units are maintained very well and they usually come with a lot more amenities<br />Landlords are desperate for tenants<br />Easy access to transportation<br /><br />Reasons to move out to Astoria (2 bedroom):<br />Significantly lower cost of living -&nbsp; markets, living necessities, everything is cheaper by about 50%, which definitely makes a difference.<br />Larger space (by about 100 to 200 sq ft)<br /><br />So my set of trade offs seems to be this: take a much nicer, smaller place that has much better location or a bigger place with a lot longer commute (because I have a pet) but I get to reduce my cost of living.<br /><br />Also, just to make it clear: if I were to stay in Manhattan I&#039;d try and shop at cheaper areas by reverse commuting to Queens, so it&#039;s a bigger hassle but I can still save money this way.<br /><br />The answers don&#039;t seem that obvious once I lay it out like that.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_164136">I have to say that it&#039;s refreshing to see someone who wants so badly to be an Astorian for more reasons than financial.&nbsp; I hope that you are able to find something soon!<br /><br />That said, I know it&#039;s not the best option in the world but have you looked at the Acropolis on Ditmars?&nbsp; I know a lot of people have dogs there and there are some decent apartments to be had there, just depends on the individual owner.&nbsp; It may at least be an option to get you out of your current lease and allow you to look for your dream apartment at a slower pace if you found a place there that does a month-to-month lease.<br /><br />Also, check out the Pistilli property near Astoria Park (Pistilli Riverview East).&nbsp; I think you are allowed to have dogs there.&nbsp; While it&#039;s been surrounded by &quot;controversy&quot; for years a friend of mine has a fantastic loft there and seems to be happy living there.<br /><br />Just a couple of suggestions.&nbsp; Good luck on your search and an early &quot;Welcome to the Hood!&quot;</div>

You only need to see one good place. Sure, you might see 50 bad places first, but you just need that one good place. And they&#039;re out there!<br /><br />(Sort of on-, sort of off-topic: I was talking to a neighbor at my laundromat a few weeks ago, and she told me that the new buildings up Steinway from us (near the corner of 20th Ave, a 15-20 minute walk to the N) were 1BR apartments for $3,000. I was all&nbsp; :-o She could have been mistaken/exaggerating, but gah. And no wonder they seem mostly vacant, despite having been completed over a year ago.)</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_164237">I spent the day looking for apartments in Manhattan today just for the sake of price comparison.&nbsp; I figured it&#039;d be a good idea to see how Astoria&#039;s market is impacted if at all by Manhattan&#039;s and took a look at some units within my price range.&nbsp; As it turns out, Manhattan&#039;s market really is very soft and the units that are available are actually top notch when compared to the things I&#039;ve seen in Astoria.&nbsp; Although asking prices in Manhattan are still very high, landlords have actually catered to me (gasp!) and are tenacious with their follow up to try and rent to me.<br /><br />Starting at the top:<br /><br />I met with a Citi Habitats broker today, Norm, who said that the Manhattan market is literally dead.&nbsp; There is little if any movement and inventory of apartments is at an all time high.&nbsp; He can&#039;t remember the last time he had so many units.&nbsp; Nor can he recall any transactions that he&#039;s done in the past couple of months.&nbsp; He was extremely flexible with his broker fee as well, citing as low as $800 if I do indeed find something I like.&nbsp; Clearly, the days of 20% of annual rent are over.<br /><br />When I later called up another broker, Stalin (what were his parents thinking with that name?), he told me that this year he had made one placement in Queens, one in Brooklyn, and zero in Manhattan.&nbsp; It&#039;s obvious that everybody in Manhattan is getting out.<br /><br />I saw two places, both 1 bedrooms, that had good space.&nbsp; One was located in the 60s, the other in the 80s, both on the Upper East Side.&nbsp; One was almost a 1.5 bedroom, as a matter of fact.&nbsp; Both units had an asking price of $1,900, which if you&#039;ve been following my adventures, is out of my price range.&nbsp; I asked if the owners were flexible with price and I got a very quick &quot;Oh yea, you can submit an application with whatever number you want and they&#039;re willing to work with you.&quot;&nbsp; I asked how long the apartment&#039;s been on market.&nbsp; Their response: &quot;Over 6 weeks.&quot;&nbsp; Not ever have I heard of a unit in prime &quot;entry level yuppyland&quot; been on market for 2 weeks nevermind 6 weeks.&nbsp; Each unit was 600 sq feet or more.&nbsp; One was on the second floor, the other on the third.&nbsp; Both were pet friendly and had a full kitchen (albeit small stove), closets, and a decent bathroom.<br /><br />Aside from working with brokers, I also did quite a bit of walking in the area, which was good because I found a lot of &quot;For Rent&quot; signs but bad because it was soooooo freakin freezing cold.&nbsp; In fact, all of the ink in my pens froze and I had a hard time writing information down.&nbsp; But I did end up calling a good number of these people.&nbsp; Half the time I got brokers, but the other half were indeed owners and/or the management company.&nbsp; Never in my life have I felt this much like a VIP, especially with landlords.&nbsp; I must have heard the phrase &quot;We have BEAUTIFUL granite counters&quot; over 20 times.&nbsp; I had landlords chasing me down, taking down my phone number, sending pictures to my email address, trying everything in their power to convince me to move into their units.&nbsp; Of course, a lot of them were over my price range and the ones that were in my range were way too small (300 sq feet).&nbsp; But that being said, a lot of them have promised me that they&#039;ll follow up in the morning to see what else they have.&nbsp; And these are the landlords!&nbsp; Not the brokers!&nbsp; WOW.<br /><br />Of course, some of these places I inquired about gave me a really snooty attitude.&nbsp; &quot;Our 1 bedrooms start at $3,500, sir.&quot;&nbsp; That was a lady at a management office of an old, semi-run down doorman building.&nbsp; My response: &quot;Well, of course you&#039;re entitled to ask for whatever price you want.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;ll get it,&quot; I would say.&nbsp; In general, I saw quite a few units today.&nbsp; Everyone was very courteous to me and I think deep down they all wanted my business very badly although it&#039;s hard to tell for sure since no one wants to seem desperate.<br /><br />Jenny from Avanguard called back today as well.&nbsp; She had showed my wife and me an apartment that I didn&#039;t mention earlier because we had a fundamental conflict with the landlords.&nbsp; Not only were they smug, but at the viewing they had told us that we would get the apartment &quot;as is&quot; without renovations.&nbsp; It was very large 2 bedroom unit, but the catch was that they were unwilling to put any work into it after a couple of girls had moved out and left the place a little bit run down, including holes all over the walls, and a ton of rust on a refrigerator that was falling apart.&nbsp; Also, the unit is located in a part of Astoria that I&#039;m not familiar with.&nbsp; In fact, I still don&#039;t know the address of that place because we saw it so late at night and it was a hike from the R train, a part of Queens that I haven&#039;t done my homework on.&nbsp; Regardless, Jenny informed me that the landlords &quot;liked us so much and really wanted us as their tenants that they&#039;ve agreed to paint the walls and lower the price by $50/month.&quot;&nbsp; That&#039;s great and all, I&#039;m very grateful, but I still don&#039;t know the location.&nbsp; This weekend I&#039;ll take another look at that unit and figure out if it&#039;s in a doable area.&nbsp; If it is, it will certainly come down to a nice, large 2 bedroom in Astoria-ish area or a decent 1 bedroom on the Upper East Side.<br /><br />As of right now, I&#039;m still leaning towards Upper East Side because it&#039;s what I know and the quality of apartment in terms of renovation and construction is very high.&nbsp; But if everything is good with the 2 bedroom, then I&#039;ll certainly consider that as well.&nbsp; Of course, it&#039;d help a lot if the 2 bedroom was actually in an area that I had originally wanted...<br /><br />Deep down, I know that if I had found the 1 bedroom unit that I saw today but in Astoria for a reasonable price ($1,400 ~ $1,500 or thereabouts), I would have jumped on it in a heartbeat.&nbsp; Instead, I&#039;ve seen a whole bunch of small, run down units with terrible maintenance for $1,600+, which is just a silly deal, in my opinion, especially when I think I can get a much better unit in Manhattan for roughly the same price.<br /><br />To be continued...</div>
