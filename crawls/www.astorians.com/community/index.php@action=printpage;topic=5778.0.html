				I just wanted to get my say in there quick. &nbsp;Anti-gay s___ (look I cursed to be open minded) is something I have a hard time tolerating, its the same as racism as far as this lily white straight boy is concerned. &nbsp;But now that its degenerated into name calling I&#039;m like a foreign car, audi.&nbsp; Get it?&nbsp; Thats a freebie.<br />

				Hi guys,<br /><br />Please read the guidelines of this board (http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=3945.msg39282#msg39282) if you need clarity. We&#039;ve all been through this before about how offensive behavior by one member is not license for any other member to mimic that behavior or disregard community guidelines. Being a long-time member of the board does not exempt any of us from the rules.<br /><br />I&#039;m not against censorship in all cases, namely the ones spelled out in the guidelines.<br /><br />Incidentally, if anyone feels that the guidelines need to be revised, or disagree with the guidelines in their current form, they are open to community discussion and modification.
