				Okay, I&#039;m not a young and spritely fellow anymore, but I used to play roller hockey in the day and it was a fun way to keep in shape.&nbsp; I have all the gear for ice hockey, but dragging it all the way to Chelsea Piers is well, a drag.&nbsp; Anyone know of any roller hockey leagues in Astoria?&nbsp; I see people rollering around with sticks from time to time, I assume they are playing and not trying to enact some Kevin Smith movie.&nbsp; I seriously want to get back into it.

				I used to play too, but don&#039;t have any gear except skates with me.&nbsp; The only place I can see playing around here is in the park next to the Astoria Boulevard N train station.&nbsp; I see some kids there playing sometimes.&nbsp; Let me know if you find some people to play and I&#039;ll get a stick.

				I&#039;m interested if we can find a place.&nbsp; I have ice hockey gear that I lug up to Central Park in the winter time which is fun, but would love to play during the summer months as well.

				I actually found a Roller Hockey Rink in Astoria!<br />I rode by the other day on my bike.<br />It&#039;s Across from the Holmes School on 28th Street between 36th and 37th Ave.<br />I don&#039;t know what the deal is to get on there, but I can see that it is a full on hockey rink with boards &amp; everything.

				Hey NYC goalie,,, i know this thread is very old but I just joined the Astorians,&nbsp; it brings me back to my young years so much, I was born and raised in Astoria and started playing hockey at the age of 4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where/whom did I play for???&nbsp; Yep u said it yourself Most Precious Blood.&nbsp; Hockey was very HUGE in Astoria as u said.&nbsp; I remember our schoolyard with the boards going down only one side of our yard, during the all star games every year I remember going down into the cafeteria where they would serve us hot chocolate between periods. Wow such wonderful memories,, when we first started, ages 4-6 I remember we would get sweatshirts as our jersey with a little guy with a hockey stick on front,, as we got older our first real jersey were Flyer jerseys,,, we were the MPB flyers,, we had much talent on our teams,, coach (mr. Myers) was a great influence on all us kids At the time,, we were a great organization that brought many championships to MPB,,, miss that time so much,,,,, ohhhh and yes I&#039;m gonna go back to schoolyard to check out those faded circles, etc,,, thanks again

Me and a few guys have been playing weeknights at Dutch Kills rink...we&#039;re playing this Saturday morning if you&#039;re interested. No nets, just been shooting into cones, decent rink though (semi poopie asphalt, but at least you can wrap the puck around the boards)
