				This might seem like a silly question, but I honestly don&#039;t know...<br /><br />If I need to file charges against someone in a non-emergency situation--can I do this any time at the precinct? Are there like office hours for things like this? Or can I just go down there tonight after work and ask to talk to an officer?

				Yeah, go into the office, it&#039;s probably the best option. Oh, btw, be prepared to stand at the counter for a good 15 minutes until someone acknowledges your presence. Once they see you, they will look down at their desk for a while, then play some sort of pen flipping game for 10 minutes, followed by talking to their buddy about the game last night, then they will look at you again. After they look at you again, they will continue to putz around the station, then if you are lucky, in about 20 minutes, someone will come up to you and ask if you need help.

				Wow, you guys sure are cynical. I had to go once, it took me only a few minutes to talk to someone, and then maybe less than 1/2 an hour before I sat in front of an officer who asked questions to file a report. I believe it all depends on how many officers and assistants are available, and how many people they are helping at the time. I don&#039;t know what the more appropriate time to file a non-emergency report would be, but I&#039;m sure someone will assistant you regardles of the time of day or night.

Also, if you do file a complaint, and they want ot brush you off, you get told to call in&nbsp; afew days to check. Then you are told computers are down, or that person you need to talk to is not arund.&nbsp; Then if you ask who that is, name is not available at moment.<br /><br />One Luitenant there will never get hemmeroids, since he is a perfect asshole. He is tall, &#039;Goober&quot; type, like Gomer Pyle&#039;s grandson or something. Pressed shirt, all white and clean, he sits, does nothing.&nbsp; Shuffles folders, and gives an occasional &quot;Cover my own ass&quot; order to cops, like &#039;Watch your prisoner!&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; That order is so prisoner in cell does not hang self, escape, or turn into a werewolf on them.

The article addresses the suicide issue.&nbsp; Of particular interest is the following:<br /><br />&quot;Psychologists and correction officials say potential suicides tend to fit a pattern. They are usually young men from the ages of 19 through 25, first-time offenders - many charged with driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol - with histories of psychological instability and trauma at home or work. Many of those being held are awaiting arraignment or trial.<br /><br />Upon entering a jail or prison, officials say, prisoners are routinely searched for objects with which they can harm themselves. Shoelaces, neckties and belts are taken away to prevent hangings, and prisoners showing signs of depression or erratic behavior are secluded and kept under constant or periodic watch. Such prisoners are also sent to psychiatric facilities as quickly as possible for evaluation.&quot;

				^<br />Wow that&#039;s actually a shocking article there. <br /><br />It amazes me how/why people panic though. Do people not understand the judiciary, laws and procedures? Then again....the stats say 19-25 yo...<br /><br />Still...As NYC residents, we all know the groundwork to the laws here like the back of our hands. Nonetheless, it is sad to see that people actually do commit suicide in a Pct. Cell.

				Thanks, Handyman. I hope it helps, although the police did tell me there wasn&#039;t much they could do beyond starting a paper trail at this point (understandably, I don&#039;t want to go into a lot of details here). <br /><br />I understand why everyone made the comments they made--while I didn&#039;t have to wait 45 (or 40) minutes, it was a bit long and things seemed a little chaotic. I was treated brusquely until one of the officers noticed I was on the verge of tears and then she was a little nicer to me. I know they deal with stuff like this every day and it starts to not bother them, but I&#039;ve never had to do this before and I&#039;m upset enough that it&#039;s a step I had to take without them treating me like it doesn&#039;t matter. <br /><br />That said, it wasn&#039;t a <em>bad</em> experience, so I guess I&#039;m glad it&#039;s over.
