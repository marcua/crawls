				Hi all,<br /><br />I&#039;m new to the forum and trying to wrap my head around the rental scene in Astoria so please bear with me =)<br /><br />A little background: I&#039;m planning on moving to the area with my cofounder/roommate as we begin developing a startup.&nbsp; Since we&#039;re trying to keep costs as low as possible, I&#039;m trying to see if Astoria is even within reach for us.<br /><br />So two questions: <br />1. Is a 2BR for &lt;$1400 possible at all? I&#039;ve seen some listings here and there on CL but they don&#039;t always seem very trustworthy.<br />2. Is a 1BR with a decent living room for &lt;$1200 possible at all?&nbsp; If it comes down to it, I&#039;d rather take that arrangement with one of us using the living room as a BR instead of going to Jersey City or someplace like that.<br /><br />Please let me know if I&#039;m totally off base here!<br /><br />Thanks :)<br />

				Have you looked at Sunnyside or Long Island City? I fear for the conditions you&#039;d have to endure for those prices. Those alternatives are right next door to Astoria, without the over-inflated rent, ConEd generators, water treatment smells or motorcycle gangs.

				Sorry, xenowang, but I think you&#039;re looking at a pretty small 2BR. You should look in the Acropolis, I&#039;ve seen 2BR Rentals in the $1600 range there, but they&#039;re relatively small. As far as $1200, it would take a lot of looking, but odds are you&#039;d end up with a studio at that price range. <br /><br />Christine, where in LIC are you talking about? From what I&#039;ve seen, rent in LIC is equal or higher than Astoria for comparable space. <br />As far as Sunnyside, I agree. It is much better value for space.

				Thanks for the replies, all.<br /><br />Casicua, how small are we talking here?&nbsp; We&#039;re only a couple of years out of college so we&#039;re fairly used to small, cramped spaces :P<br /><br />Is anybody here familiar with rent ranges in Brooklyn and how they compare to Astoria?&nbsp; Perhaps that&#039;s not an appropriate question to ask, but it seems overall that BK is cheaper (depending on the neighborhood, of course).

				As far as BK goes, and any of the neighborhoods close to Manhattan - ie Williamsburg, Park Slope, Brooklyn Hts, Carroll Gardens, etc, they have been far higher than Queens for quite some time.&nbsp; Further out, yeah they may be more on par with Queens but your commute will be longer.&nbsp; I&#039;d say you&#039;re better off doing an all area search in Astoria, Long Island City, Sunnyside, Woodside, and Jackson Heights. You&#039;re bound to find something you like if you expand your search.

				The Historic Landmark District of Jackson Heights is a beautiful neighborhood with reasonably priced apartments.&nbsp; It is possible that you can get a huge one bedroom at 1,200 to 1,400.&nbsp; I don&#039;t do rentals, but I have a colleague that does.&nbsp; The trains that are available within a few blocks are the E, F, G, R, V and 7 trains.<br /><br />Best,
