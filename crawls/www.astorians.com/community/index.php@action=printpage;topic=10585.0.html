				I am moving my grad school daughter to NYC, preferably Astoria because she has friends there.&nbsp; We will have one week to find her an apartment and to expedite this process I want to come as prepared as possible. What type of paperwork do most landlords request?&nbsp; I hope to have everything I need to make the process as simple as possible.&nbsp; My daughter is searching listings and watching for info on brokers.&nbsp; Any suggestions on who would work with us.&nbsp; I plan on making appointments before we arrive.&nbsp; This is a really nerve wracking process from everything that I have read.&nbsp; All the info you can give would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks

				While I recommend meeting with as many brookers as possible to find a place, my experience has been many are rather shady, so just be sure to turn over your info / $ only after you have settled on the place with the landlord.<br /><br />Are you going to be guarintor for your daughter?&nbsp; Depending on her credit report, and income that level that she can prove, a landlord may require one.&nbsp; I would bring any documentation on finacial aid (student loans / scholarships) that she has to show she wil have some level of income.&nbsp; One other thing to consider, is a lot of people move in with others when first moving to NYC.&nbsp; Look at craigs list for apartment shares, this is genrally more economical for people, with fewer requirments by the potenail roomates for proof of income, plus it can make things move a lot quicker.

				thanks for the info about student loan info,I hadn&#039;t thought about that.&nbsp; I will co-sign with her.&nbsp; Should we bring a copy of her credit report or just let the brokers do the credit check?&nbsp; I still am wary of brokers from all I have read on this site.&nbsp; Are there truly any good and honest ones out there?&nbsp; Please help with this question.&nbsp; We are from central Illinois and don&#039;t have to deal with brokers even in Chicago.&nbsp; This is a whole new thing.

				Historyteacher, random coincidence - I&#039;m also moving from central IL to (hopefully) Astoria this summer and also will only have a week to find an apartment.&nbsp; We&#039;re heading out to look for an apartment in the 2nd week of July for a hopefully 1 August lease date.&nbsp; The process feels daunting to me, to say the least...

				Yeah, don&#039;t get me started.&nbsp; Granted I knew that I&#039;d never see anything like my $400/month, 2bdrm apartment in central IL again, but I lived in Philly for nearly a decade and even that can&#039;t even maybe hold a candle to NYC.

				I could only wish my daughter was going to Chicago.&nbsp; I guess it is a case of knowing the town and not knowing NYC.&nbsp; But she is going to grad school at NYU and lots of her friends from Syracuse U live in Astoria so she is kind of set on it.&nbsp; I may grow to love NYC as much as I love Chicago.&nbsp; It will be a hard sell though.

				Historyteacher<br /><br />Remember that you are reading rants, complaints and sour grapes.&nbsp; For better or worse, this part of the website has evolved into a complaints bureau.&nbsp; While I am no fan of most brokers, it is really not that daunting to find a decent place in Astoria.&nbsp; And, it is a great neighborhood.&nbsp; I bet your daughter will be very happy here.&nbsp; <br /><br />That said, you would probably do well to check Craigs list.

				I might be a little late to the party but I just moved recently so thought I could add something.&nbsp; This is what I always had with me:<br /><br />1. Drivers license (they&#039;ll need to photo copy it)<br />2. My 2 most recent pay stubs<br />3. My own credit report from freecreditreport.com (most brokers will insist they run one for you but if you find a place by owner this might be useful).&nbsp; <br />4. A letter of employment with salary, title and how long i&#039;ve been working there. <br />5. $1000 cash.&nbsp; I hate having that much cash on me but when I found the place I liked it was great to pull out the $&#039;s and put a deposit down on the spot. <br />6. Most recent bank statements.&nbsp; <br /><br />Having all this stuff on me made my life easier when I decided to take a place.&nbsp; Some brokers will ask for less info but its never bad to be prepared.&nbsp; <br /><br />Like others mentioned, visit a lot of brokers.&nbsp; They do almost nothing for their fee- usually just drive you and unlock the door to an apt you&#039;ve already probably seen pictures of on craigslist - but thats the game here in Astoria.&nbsp; if you can find a place you like &quot;by owner&quot; then good on you but I didn&#039;t have any success.&nbsp; <br /><br />Most brokers won&#039;t follow up with you.&nbsp; Just go in to a bunch of realty places, fill out their basic info form and try to get them to show you places right then and there.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t like anything you can probably walk about 2 blocks, find another realtor and do the same thing.&nbsp; Of the roughly 12 brokers I worked with this time around only 2 followed up with additional apartments after my initial visit.&nbsp; It seems like they want to show you 2-3 apt&#039;s that day and hope you take one.&nbsp; After that they wait for the next walk in customer... just my experience.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck&nbsp;
