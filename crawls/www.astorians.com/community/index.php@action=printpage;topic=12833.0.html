				<strong>I provide computer/network/security services within the immediate Queens/Brooklyn/Manhattan area.<br />Unlike most individuals claiming to be “experts”, I stand behind what I say in with my credentials and my work. I will not “milk” time out of my customers. My time is very important, and so is yours.<br />I charge a fair fee relative to my experience and the level of complexity of the work. Since I have come across countless issues, there will be no surprises and my estimates of how long the work will take are VERY accurate. Most of my clients find that overall, I am less expensive than other consultants, because I do the job right and on time. Again, I will not stretch out my hours on the job. <br /><br />No job or contract is too big; I have extensive relationships with very large partners and resellers.<br /><br />A little bit about me:<br /><br />Professional Engineering background with extensive business training Many years of experience in virtually all market verticals, financial, government, education, small business – I have personally engineered large projects for large financial institutions, pharmaceutical companies, law firms, public schools, marketing/public relations companies to name a few.<br /><br />I also have satisfied customers that own small businesses.<br /><br /><br />What I offer:<br /><br />My engineering background and mindset allow me to tackle virtually anything thrown at me. My experience further adds to my expertise.<br /><br />*Networking – setting up networks<br /><br />*Basic computer troubleshooting – is your computer running slow? Virus? Spyware?<br /><br />*storage solutions – I’ll help you set up storage systems either stand alone or network accessible<br /><br />*remote access – access your computer/network from any location<br /><br />*vulnerability/penetration testing – I will test your network/computer and determine how to break in using non destructive methods, and help you make everything on your network secure<br /><br />*training – I am also a professional trainer, so if you have an office I will help get all employees trained quickly<br /><br />*tutoring – studying for any computer specific class or exam? I can help you.<br /><br />Contact me with a number to reach you along with details on what you are expecting.<br /><br />I look forward to doing business with you. <br /></strong>
