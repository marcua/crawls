I would be interested in knowing why you don&#039;t think that this is a civil rights issue. It would help me to know where you are coming from.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />First, I said your action&nbsp; of comparing plight of Black people with gay rights was despicable.<br />You say I am a smart guy----o.k., I&#039;ll give you that one. :-)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I am not religious sort, I just don&#039;t think gay marriage should be allowed.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it&#039;s normal--but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s evil either.&nbsp; No one&#039;s going to hell for it (I hope not)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I think people into S&amp;M are same, a little nuts, but not in a way that hurts anyone (Well, they do hurt each other, but I guess it&#039;s in fun, or whatever)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t want to see men kissing&nbsp; on street.&nbsp; I have, I think they&#039;re nuts. But i don&#039;t attack&nbsp; them, faint, scream, clutch my chest or call a priest.&nbsp; Same for women, by the way. I am not one of those guys who think lesbians are greatest thing since the motorcycle.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I know it will lead to more adoption by gays, which I think is child cruelty. And yes, I know kids are not well off as orphans, but issue is not related.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s no good to have to explain to kids why two guys/two women&nbsp; are holding hands, kissing,&nbsp; or whatever.&nbsp; &nbsp; Kids copy what they see,&nbsp; I don&#039; t want to find my son playing house with some boy he&#039;s friends with because he&#039;s seeing more and more gay&nbsp; stuff on television shows and movies. I don&#039;t like that high schools all have gay &quot;Support groups&quot; which are a tricky way of taking confused kids and steering them in that direction<br />I think homosexuality is&nbsp; abnormal.&nbsp; So do many others.&nbsp; So does most of the world. However, I&#039;m not a &#039;Let&#039;s kill them!!&quot; type, or into beating them up.&nbsp; <br /><br />Two guys on my team in pool league are gay.&nbsp; They know my opinion. One I get along with, other stopped talking to me for long time, till we agreed to both not bring subject&nbsp; up.&nbsp; <br /><br />I said before in another post, clearly, that public should vote on it.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s like Obama. I did not want him as President, but since he won, he&#039;s now my president and I accept it.<br /><br />I don&#039;t consider marriage of gays a civil rights issue.&nbsp; It&#039;s my opinion.&nbsp; If peole wanted to marry in threesomes, I&#039;d be against that too. <br /><br />I could go on, but I&#039;m not getting paid for this, and my fingers are tired of typing. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></div>

There is example-upon-example of hard evidence, citations of fact, and recent polls, yet rather than reading any of that, you choose instead to make things personal for some reason.&nbsp; You are a smart guy.&nbsp; I have enjoyed reading your posts on Astorians.&nbsp; Your knowledge of local history is interesting to read. I would be interested in knowing why you don&#039;t think that this is a civil rights issue. It would help me to know where you are coming from.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />First, I said your action&nbsp; of comparing plight of Black people with gay rights was despicable.<br />You say I am a smart guy----o.k., I&#039;ll give you that one. :-)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I am not religious sort, I just don&#039;t think gay marriage should be allowed.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it&#039;s normal--but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s evil either.&nbsp; No one&#039;s going to hell for it (I hope not)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I think people into S&amp;M are same, a little nuts, but not in a way that hurts anyone (Well, they do hurt each other, but I guess it&#039;s in fun, or whatever)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t want to see men kissing&nbsp; on street.&nbsp; I have, I think they&#039;re nuts. But i don&#039;t attack&nbsp; them, faint, scream, clutch my chest or call a priest.&nbsp; Same for women, by the way. I am not one of those guys who think lesbians are greatest thing since the motorcycle.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I know it will lead to more adoption by gays, which I think is child cruelty. And yes, I know kids are not well off as orphans, but issue is not related.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s no good to have to explain to kids why two guys/two women&nbsp; are holding hands, kissing,&nbsp; or whatever.&nbsp; &nbsp; Kids copy what they see,&nbsp; I don&#039; t want to find my son playing house with some boy he&#039;s friends with because he&#039;s seeing more and more gay&nbsp; stuff on television shows and movies. I don&#039;t like that high schools all have gay &quot;Support groups&quot; which are a tricky way of taking confused kids and steering them in that direction<br />I think homosexuality is&nbsp; abnormal.&nbsp; So do many others.&nbsp; So does most of the world. However, I&#039;m not a &#039;Let&#039;s kill them!!&quot; type, or into beating them up.&nbsp; <br /><br />Two guys on my team in pool league are gay.&nbsp; They know my opinion. One I get along with, other stopped talking to me for long time, till we agreed to both not bring subject&nbsp; up.&nbsp; <br /><br />I said before in another post, clearly, that public should vote on it.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s like Obama. I did not want him as President, but since he won, he&#039;s now my president and I accept it.<br /><br />I don&#039;t consider marriage of gays a civil rights issue.&nbsp; It&#039;s my opinion.&nbsp; If peole wanted to marry in threesomes, I&#039;d be against that too. <br /><br />I could go on, but I&#039;m not getting paid for this, and my fingers are tired of typing. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Joey, for the first time, I do not condemn you. I hope that You realize that I am not trying to force anything on you. To me, at this moment, this is between me and the state. <br /><br />That having been said.... I really feel that you have been honest in your last post. I, myself, cannot condemn anyone for being uncomfortable with the concept of me marrying my boyfriend. I must admit it is strange.......and for me perfectly natural. Joey, I want to defend him in the same way you would want to defend your wife. <br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></div>

I did not want him as President, but since he won, he&#039;s now my president and I accept it.<br /><br />I don&#039;t consider marriage of gays a civil rights issue.&nbsp; It&#039;s my opinion.&nbsp; If peole wanted to marry in threesomes, I&#039;d be against that too. <br /><br />I could go on, but I&#039;m not getting paid for this, and my fingers are tired of typing. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Firstly, you called the comparison of gay people&#039;s troubles to civil rights(NOT slavery, Civil Rights) despicable, yet you gave no indication or framed argument about how they are different. I, and a few others, cited actual facts and similarities between the gay marriage issue and civil rights issues (NOT slavery, Civil Rights- just so we can be clear here)<br /><br />Secondly, I think everything else you wrote in this response is despicable, and here is why: Your argument against homosexuality in all of these examples leads me to believe that you think of homosexuals as lesser-beings. <br /><br />You have a guy in your pool league who is gay and your agreement was that you would not bring it up? Wow- that is like me telling my black friend we can be friends as long as the subject of his being black does not come up. Gay is who the guy in your pool league is- and I find that low and despicable that the only way you can get along is if his being gay is not talked about. <br /><br />And do you know anything about gay support groups? You talk about them like they&#039;re a conspiracy of people trying to turn teenagers gay. Do you remember high school at all? Teenagers are cruel and abusive and torment anyone who&#039;s different(Clearly, from what I&#039;ve been reading on this thread some adults are as well). These support groups are there to help people having to repress who they are because people like you will only be friends with them if they don&#039;t tell you they&#039;re gay, and they get classified as lesser people.&nbsp; <br /><br />And the only thing in this past post that I can even consider close to what would resemble an argument is &quot;It&#039;s not normal&quot; and &quot;I don&#039;t want my kids to be gay&quot;. Really well-rationalized argument there...&nbsp; :roll:</div>

This is not a place to vent, it&#039;s an ongoing dialogue. It&#039;s a public discussion, and things like that that get posted will and should illicit a response. <br />For example, if someone posted something like &quot;I detest anyone who believes in Jesus Christ because I think it&#039;s abnormal and sickening&quot;, I would certainly expect people to react negatively and respond. And if you are someone who either believes in Jesus, or support people&#039;s rights to believe in Jesus, of course you would take offense to it. I am not gay, but I certainly believe in gay people&#039;s rights to live their lives without prejudice just like any other person should. <br /><br />And Billy, I can appreciate your viewpoint. I don&#039;t like anyone&#039;s sexuality forced upon me, but I&#039;ll be damned if I tell them how to live theirs. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=14620.msg173489.html#msg173489">Quote from: billyboy on May 15, 2009, 11:27:59 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Been thinking about this topic a good bit lately, with a friend whose son just came out to her (think he&#039;s 20 or 21) after a few years of suspicion, and her reaction has been just short of someone wearing a pilgrim&#039;s hat with a buckle.&nbsp; Hasn&#039;t kicked the kid out, but has laid so many weird spiels and head games on him that his only choice by staying in the situation is to be miserable and confused.&nbsp; She doesn&#039;t seem to realize she&#039;s on the verge of alienating him forever and creating a lose/lose situation for everyone involved, which she claims would kill her, but anyone can see this is the one button that could be pushed in her life that would send her over the edge, and God, in His infinite wisdom, pushed it.&nbsp; I guess we all have special buttons like that, but, boy, it&#039;s been an eye-opener seeing an otherwise level-headed woman go completely berserk over an issue that, as I&#039;ve noted above, is really none of her concern or business.&nbsp; I suspect she&#039;s more worried over what people will think about her &quot;as a mother&quot; as opposed to anything to do with her son&#039;s well-being, which she doesn&#039;t seem to realize she&#039;s attacking routinely.<br /><br />I think I support gay marriage simply in terms of creating the option of normalcy for people who crave it, who&#039;ve never felt &quot;normal&quot; in any sense and now want that sense of stability.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see it as a civil rights issue either, although you could surely frame it that way.&nbsp; This has been my ongoing problem with the left and why I stopped calling myself a liberal roundabout 1990 or so -- just got tired of the cultural strong-arming and &quot;all or nothing/with us or against us&quot; propositions being laid on me routinely, and it&#039;s only grown worse since.&nbsp; Life just isn&#039;t that clear-cut -- at least mine isn&#039;t.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That story is terribly sad about the mother and child. To me, this is the danger of the whole anti-gay thing-some kids grow up mentally (and sometimes physically) damaged from this stigma against homosexuality. That, to me is one of the main reasons it needs to be an ongoing battle to preserve gay rights. Until they do have equal treatment, they cannot start to be considered by society as equal people- which is particularly why I perceive it to be a civil rights issue. <br /><br />In regards to your not labeling yourself liberal any more, I can see where you are coming from. To be fair, however, the cultural strong-arming is a byproduct of the bipartisan system, not the liberals or conservatives. This country has been down such a path of &quot;You&#039;re either red or blue since there&#039;s no in-between&quot;, that it&#039;s sad. </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_173550">I have been thinking, over the last two days, of an important element to this debate that seems to come up over and over again. And that is the comparison of the LGBT rights struggle to the African-American rights struggle. <br /><br />First off, I want to say this. I have come to the realization that there are two key elements in my fight for marriage equality. They are the personal fight and the societal fight. Everyone who has been reading this thread is aware of the personal stake I have in this. Tonight, I want to address the societal stake in this. <br /><br />A few weeks ago, when the Maine Senate held their hearing regarding marriage equality, I heard a comment from a gay teenager that struck home to me and put into words what I instinctively knew. <br /><br />He said that (and I am paraphrasing) as long as Maine writes discrimination into their laws, they are giving permission for the citizens to discriminate against me. <br /><br />This is how I see it and why I think it as parallel to the Black civil rights movement. Civil unions and domestic partner registries are second class systems. They seek to address something that I desire. But, in a way that is discriminatory. The laws create a parallel system that is not equal to what heterosexuals have. And by doing so they are allowing people to think that we are less than them. I remember about three or four years ago when 3 gay men were attacked in Astoria. These attacks occurred during the same month that Congress was considering a Constitutional amendment to make marriage only between a man and a woman. I recall that year as the year that Karl Rove et al decided that same sex marriage was the wedge issue that would win Bush a second term. I am not saying that it is an exact correlation, just that the trends in gay bashing rose during the period the Congress was debating. <br /><br />Now, Why do I think this relates to the Black civil rights movement? Because ultimately, they were trying to erase the same type of laws that created a second class system that dehumanized them. The government back then gave permission to whites to abuse and even kill blacks. Every separate drinking fountain and separate bathroom and separate dining areas perpetuated the separate but equal myth that we now know is false. And perpetuated the dehumanizing treatment of Blacks. <br /><br />As has been discussed previously, I am unaware of any claim of the LGBT rights movement being the same as the Black civil rights movement. It is my belief that there are differences. For example, I know that not a single gay person was denied the right to vote, as long as they were white. However, I am stunned that there are African-Americans that cannot see the relation between my struggle and what they struggled for. <br /><br />As I said in a previous post, a member of the New York State Assembly said what I believe to be true; &quot;I believe that Matthew Shepard was Lynched, they just didn&#039;t use a rope&quot;.<br /><br />Ultimately, as long as society thinks that I am less than equal, they have permission to hate me, discriminate against me, and yes, even kill me. <br /><br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_173637">We went to the rally this afternoon -- great turnout, the usual political cast of characters, celebs, performances, etc. The message -- the single most important message that they tried to get out -- was to contact our state senators. It&#039;s disheartening, though, to know that the person who represents our district is so opposed to it that all the calling, e-mailing, and letter writing will do nothing to change his position. <br /><br />My family has been in Astoria since the 50&#039;s. My mom and uncle graduated from Bryant H.S. After my mom got married, she returned to Astoria and raised her family here. I was born here at the old Boulevard Hospital on 31st Avenue. I graduated from PS 17 and IS 126. I spent years as a girl scout in the basement of the Methodist Church on Crescent Street. I still live here, now with my partner. We&#039;ve been engaged since 2006. My 93 year old grandmother still lives 4 blocks away. She adores my partner and is completely accepting of me and my life. So when people talk about what the native Astorians want vs. the newcomers, well, I *am* a native Astorian. My grandmother is a longtime Astorian. And we want marriage equality and we want it now.<br /><br />My mom was an Onorato supporter and I vividly recall when he first ran for state senate. But that was 26 years ago. Things have changed around here, Onorato has not. What was once a constituency primarily of immigrants and blue collar workers is now a neighborhood of young professionals -- educated, and progressive. That he&#039;s so unaware of who he represents is bad enough, but that he&#039;s so uninterested in finding out is downright appalling. I&#039;m sure he&#039;s not concerned about reelection -- the man is 80 years old. He&#039;s not voting against this because of what he believes his constituency wants, he&#039;s voting against this because it&#039;s what HE wants. That&#039;s not why we elected him. I&#039;m sorry to say I voted for him. Like many Astorians, I voted on name recognition, not on the issues.<br /><br />It would be a shame if Onorato&#039;s legacy of a committment to serving the people of this community is marred by a single vote on the wrong side of history.</div>
