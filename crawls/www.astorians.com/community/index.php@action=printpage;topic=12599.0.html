				What part of Astoria are you in? It seems like each area has different kinds of hot spots.<br /><br />Some of my favorite places to hang:<br /><br />1. 30th Ave east of Steinway - You&#039;ve got Blackbird&#039;s, Dillinger&#039;s, the Quays all right there. These places have lots of very friendly people and are easy to go to alone. I recommend these most strongly for weekday nights, though.<br /><br />2. 28th Ave around 36th St - Rapture and the Irish Rover are right there. Also, on 28th Ave across Steinway is Stove. See what I wrote about number one. The reason these spots are better is that most of the younger crowd likes to go to Manhattan on the weekends.<br /><br />3. Sunswick on 35th Ave and 35th St - This place is good any night of the week and has lots of events. <br /><br />4. HellGate Social near 21st St and Astoria Blvd (forget the exact spot) - Very VERY social, especially during Sunday movies and Wednesday night Rock Band.<br /><br />5. 30th Ave - the cafes between 31st St and Steinway can be a lot of fun to hang out at, but they&#039;re more fun if you have friends. Not good to go alone.

				Awesome!!!<br /><br />Thanks for the feedback guys - I have 2 other roommates - so i think as long as we find the right place - we&#039;ll have a blast!<br /><br />We didn&#039;t move in yet - we&#039;ve been looking for about two weeks so far - hopefully we find a place this weekend and move in on the 1st!&nbsp; can&#039;t decide between the ditmars area, or closer to the broadway subway stations... any suggestions?

				I&#039;ve lived in both the Ditmars and 30th Ave area and my impression, in terms of the &quot;scene&quot; is that Ditmars is more upscale and mature. There are wine bars and Mojave and even the sports bar there--McCaan&#039;s--is very nice (clean bathrooms, new TVs, cocktail list, nice menu, etc). Ditmars is also a much quieter, darker, tree-lined neighborhood.<br /><br />While there are trees on some Broadway streets, Broadway and 30th Ave seem more urban. After spending a year and a half on Ditmars, being back at 30th Ave is nice. Lots of places are open a lot later. Heliopolis and the Taco Truck are great. Most of the bars seem to be more divided than Ditmars (i.e. you&#039;re either with other 20-somethings or it&#039;s more of an old townie place--I like &#039;em both, personally). Broadway has more clubs and late-night spots.<br /><br />I guess what I&#039;m saying is that from Broadway to Ditmars, there really isn&#039;t an area that I think you can go wrong with. Pick the apartment that suits you and you&#039;ll find that walking from B&#039;way to Dit isn&#039;t really that far at all.&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				Ditmars is the place to live and broadway/30th ave is the place to party and hang out .&nbsp; U will find out in reverse it wont be as nice , since nights u might want to sleep&nbsp; in order to go to work the next day others will be loud,drunk and very unthinking at 4am outside the social establishments which can be by your apt . Ditmars is also much safer and prettier .

				I also think that a lot depends on yours and your roomates&#039; jobs. Are you coming home really late most nights of the week? I&#039;ve felt safer on 30th avenue coming home at 11 when I first moved here than I do walking around Ditmars and above at 9p.m. Yeh, it&#039;s all residental up there, which means quiter which means people tend to mind their own business as opposed to walking around a louder and brighter area where there are 24/7 grocery markets and late night bars. Of course, once you move into a neighborhood, you get comfortable and used to it and you look at it differently from say just exploring it initially. I&#039;d say, don&#039;t narrow your scope if you&#039;re still looking . I&#039;d look anywhere from Broadway to Ditmars and ask yourself how long of walking commute do you want to have from your apartment to the subway? Where are the grocery stores, laundromat (if there isn&#039;t one in your house or building) because over time, those two things, if they&#039;re not convenient to your apt, are going to be a pain in the ass to deal with, unless of course you and your roomies have money enough for Fresh Direct and paying someone else to do your loads.

				One so far unmentioned plus of the Bway/30th Ave area is that with a little luck you might find a place with relatively easy access to both the N/W and the R/V subways. This is very nice when one line is down.

Ditmars is tree-lined, full of families, surrounded by schools and churches, has groceries (w/parking), yards for dogs, and residents that have been here since the 40&#039;s who will hang out and chat while we all rake our yards ,garden, or shovel snow. When we went on vacation for 2 weeks, neighbors checked in on our cats and collected our mail and others put out our recycling.

I couldn&#039;t ask for better neighbors who take packages when we aren&#039;t home and vice versa, shovel our sidewalk in the winter, and even sweep the sidewalk in fairer weather. The above statement just sounds like mere jealousy, or just a gross misrepresentation of a lovely and serene&nbsp; part of Astoria. In any event, Jess, wherever you guys choose to live, I wish you luck in your search.

				Like i said , ditmars is the place to live and it is the most wanted to be in area in astoria , for its safe quiet&nbsp; and biggest sized homes in astoria .&nbsp; U wont have drunks leaning against your car&nbsp; leaving bottles in front of your yard every sat night . check out the homes on ditmars and 28th street ,some of the biggest since the bedrooms rnt on the same floor as the living room /dining room (duplex).a hop away&nbsp; from the train yet no train noise&nbsp; and guaranteed a seat every morning.

				wow - thanks so much everyone for the responses!<br /><br />We fell in loveeee with a 3 bedroom, pet friendly apartment yesterday on ditmars/35th.<br /><br />it was exactly what we were looking for.&nbsp; 2 full bathrooms (one of which is in my room), everyone was okay and happy with their bedroom sizes (a huggeee challenege we had while searching), large living room, decent size kitchen, tons of storage space, and all brand new paint and floors.&nbsp; <br /><br />we saw a tonnn of apartments yesterday on ditmars, and on 30th ave/bway area and we agreed that ditmars was where you want to come home to, and bway was where we&#039;d want to go party.<br /><br />We&#039;re 3 blocks to the subway and laundry is directly across the street.&nbsp; We&#039;re going back today to do a quick walk through and hopefully sign!!<br /><br />has anyone had any experience with a security deposit in cash - not a cashier&#039;s check, but cash?&nbsp; with a reciept of course... but i just thought it sounded a little sketchy...
