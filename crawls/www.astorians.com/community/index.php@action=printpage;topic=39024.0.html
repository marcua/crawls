				This is typical of most coffee shops. Customers that stay for a lengthy periods of time nursing a coffee cup that has long gone cold or empty while they engage on their electronic device or chat away with friends. The owners can&#039;t just ask them to leave, that just the way cafes are. This is more of a problem at the smaller stores of course because prospective customers either have to take their order to go or just go someplace else. This basically comes down to how considerate the sitting customers are about overstaying their welcome.

				It&#039;s happened to me twice at 60 Beans before the expansion. Haven&#039;t been there since so I can&#039;t verify if the seating situation has improved.
