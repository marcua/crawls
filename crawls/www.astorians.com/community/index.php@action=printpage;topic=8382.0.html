				Hi Everyone!<br /><br />I apologize if I&#039;m posting this in the wrong place. I&#039;m working on a &quot;Renter&#039;s Guide&quot; blog that relies on comments from readers in order to be successful.&nbsp; Basically I wanted to create a site that centralized/organized information that would be helpful to astoria renters, like me. I&#039;ve set it up so it&#039;s easy to comment on brokers and would love to start including apartment buildings so people could comment on them as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve just started working on this and would appreciate any feedback you have about the project before I continue.&nbsp; You can access it at http://astoriarentals.blogspot.com<br /><br />Thanks<br />Andrea&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				That&#039;s quite ambitious and handy.&nbsp; Maybe there could be a way that certain brokers get &quot;votes&quot; and then those brokers are listed first.&nbsp; Or show which ones get the most comments.&nbsp; Right now, it seems pretty random.&nbsp; And I would also suggest that you leave a place to recommend whom to see when going to a realtor, because there are good brokers and bad brokers working at the same place.&nbsp;

				Great! Thanks for the feedback!&nbsp; I have a lot of time on my hands right now since I don&#039;t start my new job for another week.&nbsp; I think the site is something I&#039;d really like to invest my spare time in because I&#039;m sure it could be helpful to a lot of people.&nbsp; Plus, I love to research and gather information. I&#039;ll look into how to incorporate ratings/rankings and individual agents.&nbsp; Thanks again. <br /><br />Andrea&nbsp; &nbsp;

				This is fantastic! I moved to Astoria this spring and I will be moving within Astoria sometime next year, so I definitely want to keep tabs on it. <br /><br />For some reason, my Bloglines aggregator does not recognize the link as publishing an RSS feed. Is this a setting you can change? (I&#039;m not familiar with Blogspot). It will be much easier for me to keep up with it if I can read it in my aggregator.<br />

				It seems you will need a whole section on Pistilli:<br /><br />http://queenscrap.blogspot.com/2007/11/miss-heather-on-this-side-of-creek.html<br /><br />Good luck on your blog! A great idea.
