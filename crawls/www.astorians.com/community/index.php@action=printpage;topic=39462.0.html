				The other day at about 6:30 in the morning I was crossing the street at crescent and ditmars and saw and smelled a lot of garbage that had probably fallen off a private garbage truck. It was really disgusting, consisting of chicken feet and lot of feathers.&nbsp; Now this morning I saw a black bag of garbage in the middle of the street on Ditmars with lots of food garbage next to it.&nbsp; Then further down on Ditmars in front of La Guli Bakery I saw a guy shoveling food garbage into a box.&nbsp; This is really disgusting.&nbsp; Whatever sanitation company is doing this should be more careful when picking up garbage.&nbsp; I hope they find out who is doing this and gives them a fine.

				I agree, Braun, it&#039;s disgusting.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are times when areas of Astoria are indistinguishable from the third world with our rotting seafood and poultry carcasses strewn about on the streets.<br /><br />Taverna Kyclades is a repeated offender - on most mornings I see a mixture of squid parts and ammonia being broomed into the street.&nbsp; Blech.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=39462.msg255774.html#msg255774">Quote from: braun on July 28, 2016, 07:55:53 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The other day at about 6:30 in the morning I was crossing the street at crescent and ditmars and saw and smelled a lot of garbage that had probably fallen off a private garbage truck.

				Probably the slaughter house on 20 avenue next to Con Edison. The dumpster outside said business will have the carting company&#039;s name and phone number.
