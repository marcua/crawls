				Hi everyone!<br /><br />My husband and I are considering a move to the Ditmars area from our current apartment on 30th Avenue near the hospital. We love where we are but we&#039;re ready to spread out a little bit and recently found an amazing-looking apartment in the complex of buildings run by the Atlantic Management Co., near the ConEd plant. So far we&#039;ve been dealing with the current tenants, who are really lovely, but we&#039;ve been a bit discouraged by what we&#039;ve found on the management company. Does anyone have any experience with them or info to share? The current tenants seemed positive but haven&#039;t been in the apartment long (they&#039;re leaving NYC unexpectedly for other reasons, nothing to do with the building) and mentioned that they hadn&#039;t dealt with management very much.<br /><br />Thanks in advance for your help and for all the other wonderful advice on these boards!

				I was wondering the same thing about them. Also do they allow dogs? I know a lot of people have them but I was told by someone that use to live there that they do not permit them but that they essentially turn a blind eye toward it.

				Hello again,<br /><br />We ended up taking an apartment in the building complex, so I thought I&#039;d follow up to share our experience in case anyone else might find it helpful.<br /><br />First of all, I misspoke in my original post: Atlantic Management Co. does not run the building complex, rather they are the broker for the buildings, which are run by Central Astoria LLC. We&#039;ve been very happy with Central Astoria so far. They take great care of the grounds and the building where we live and the one maintenance issue we&#039;ve had was handled quickly. Everyone we&#039;ve spoken with at the office has also been really lovely.<br /><br />Unfortunately, we did not have a good experience with Atlantic Management. The broker we dealt with, Pearl, was -- I&#039;m sorry to say -- unbelievably awful. We had heard and read quite a bit about her before we met in person (a quick Google search will give you an idea) but, still, we were unprepared for the woman herself. In 10+ years of living in NYC and dealing with our fair share of brokers, my husband and I were both convinced that someone must be playing an elaborate prank on us. (No joke, at one point we considered whether Pearl might actually be a performance artist!)<br /><br />To give two brief examples, in my very first phone conversation with Pearl, she immediately demanded a broker&#039;s fee for an apartment she had not shown me and persisted even after it became obvious that she had no idea who I was or what I was calling about. Later, in our first meeting, she arrived significantly late and never called/emailed/texted to let my husband or I know, even though she knew we were both missing work in order to fit her limited availability. When she did arrive, the very first thing she said was so unexpected and rude that, as she continued walking into the building, my husband and I literally just stood there with our mouths open staring after her.<br /><br />Most importantly, though, Pearl misrepresented several key facts about the apartment, some that we directly and specifically asked about (like amount of rent and the building&#039;s bedbug history) and failed to mention some amenities (like laundry) that would have helped sell the apartment. In general, she seemed confused and/or unfamiliar with the building complex, as well as basic real estate laws (like rent stabilization).<br /><br />I can honestly forgive the attitude, because you never know what someone&#039;s intentions or personal situation/challenges might be, but I am still upset that she withheld important information which could have caused a lot of serious problems. Thankfully, we were able to sign the lease with another broker, which saved the entire experience for us. I can’t emphasize enough that that is the ONLY reason we felt comfortable enough to move forward with the apartment.<br /><br />I now think that Atlantic Management and Central Astoria&#039;s bad reputation, the subject of my original post, is due in large part to Pearl. It&#039;s such a shame, too, because Central Astoria really seems to have good people who care about doing a good job. And they should get credit for that. We are very happy here and we love our new home, the neighbors we&#039;ve met so far, and the neighborhood as a whole. Please just be careful if you end up dealing with Pearl: do as much research as possible beforehand, don&#039;t go to meetings alone and make sure to get everything in writing. Of course, if you can, ask to work with another broker. Even knowing how much we enjoy it here, we would not have signed the lease if we had dealt with Pearl exclusively, and I stand by that 100%.<br /><br />To answer the question about pets, we were told by the second broker and it says in our lease that there are no pets allowed, though there are a lot of dogs and cats around. I really like it! But I&#039;d guess that you are right, that they make exceptions or just ignore it if it&#039;s not a problem. <br /><br />Last but not least, I’m sorry for all the negativity -- and it’s worth mentioning that I don’t know Pearl personally at all -- but these are the kinds of things my husband and I were wondering going into the process and so I hope it can be of use to someone else out there.<br /><br />Thanks for reading!
