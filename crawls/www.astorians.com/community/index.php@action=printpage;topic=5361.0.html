				Interesting. I like your thought about the changing economy. If you&#039;re not going to be working in a low-skilled unionized factory job, but are going to be a specialized worker instead (be it lawyer, chef, or dental hygienist), you clearly feel that you have more value as a result of your skills. <br /><br />I also wonder if the population of people in college has changed. College enrollment is way, way up from 30 years ago, and the demand has raised selectivity a lot too. Perhaps different cohorts of people are going to college now than in the past? More money-oriented students and relatively fewer liberal-arts-oriented students? Also, in a point related to above, the cost of college has gone way up. If your education now costs $100,000 instead of $10,000, doesn&#039;t that make you more feel more special?<br /><br />

				I read an article in NYMag online a few weeks ago (and which I now cannot find) about a study which involved two groups of elementary school students. &nbsp;The ones who were told that they were smart remained at about the same level when tested on academic skills at the end of the study; the ones who were complimented on how hard they worked, on the other hand, raised their scores. &nbsp;The results seemed to draw a distinction between fostering a sense of entitlement based on innate ability, and reinforcing the importance of effort and work ethic.

				Though I have a tendency to dismiss the differences between the generations, in this case I&#039;ll take what&#039;s behind door number 3.<br /><br />In my opinion, it represents a general conciousness which has been moving in the direction of individuality and self importance since the mandated conformity of World War II and the attached social conformity of the 1950&#039;s (both of which were movements away from the increased individuality/narcissism of the progressive era, 1920&#039;s).<br /><br />I see the output of media, as well as the change in labor management (the greater autonomy needed to give gen Xer&#039;s and gen Yer&#039;s in order to maximize productivity), as symptoms of this, rather than the cause.&nbsp; Eventually we&#039;ll see a swing back in the other direction.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />

				I definitely feel that students today believe that not only are they entitled to a college education, but that they&#039;re also entitled to/expect an A grade.&nbsp; What&#039;s interesting to me is that the students I&#039;m teaching now will ask &quot;What should I do to receive an A?&quot; whereas in my home institution, the attitude is more along the lines of &quot;Give me the (damn) A!&quot;

The tests are supposed to be measures of narcissism. As you say, they&#039;re doubtless biased in such a way that they&#039;re not perfectly measuring narcissism. (I assume you do agree that narcissism is at least a reasonable approximation to a personality attribute that we might want to be interested in.) Whatever they&#039;re measuring is presumably at least somewhat like that personality trait, however. So I&#039;m not sure that the measure creators can necessarily be faulted too much for trying to get at least some useful data. A more interesting question to me is whether the respondents react to the questions in the survey the same way. Maybe society has changed our understanding of concepts like self-esteem such that a participant who lived in the cultural context of 1975 might respond one way to a question about the way they feel about themselves, while the same person, with the same internal state, might respond differently to the same question now? That is, perhaps the language -- the meaning of the terms used in the test -- has changed in such a way that it&#039;s not functionally the same test any more?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />

				Y&#039;all might be interested in the author&#039;s website: http://www.psychology.sdsu.edu/new-web/facultystaff/twenge.html.<br /><br />This is what she has to say about her research methods:<br />In short, because it has hard data on how the generations really differ. Most books on generations throw around ideas about social trends and pop culture, but don&#039;t have much data on the actual characteristics of people from different generations. This book has the data -- it summarizes thirteen years of my research on the responses of 1.3 million young people. I found research reports on children and college students who completed questionnaires measuring everything from anxiety to sexual behavior. Many of these questionnaires have been used since the 1950s or 1960s, allowing me to see how today&#039;s young people differ from Baby Boomers and previous generations. Every chapter is built around a research result, with lots of pop culture analysis and examples to bring the differences to life. To find out more about how I collected this data, click here.<br />
