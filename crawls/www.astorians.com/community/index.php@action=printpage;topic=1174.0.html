				I had Frankie's pizza just yesterday. It's OK, and unlike Pizza Palace, their slices are still 2 bucks. Stuff tastes pretty good, except for their sicilian, which was bland. &nbsp;But the pizza always looks kind of stale and old every time I've been in there. And the environment, like the food, looks tired, for lack of a better word. I don't think the owner has put a dime into renovating the place since 1983.<br /><br />John's on the corner of Crescent and Astoria Blvd. is another old-school joint, but the za is much tastier. They've upgraded their act recently -- the guy behind the counter seems to have refrained from smoking on the job, and they all wear clean shirts. I think it's b/c of that Papa John's chain that opened next door and the place is worried about losing business. Why anyone would patronize a McPizza joint in this city is beyond me, but I digress...<br /><br />Back to Frankies, if you're in the area, Michael Angelo's on 23rd Ave and 29th Street (next door to Zorba's and the new health food store) is the best za in town. And their prices are very reasonable -- I think a cheese slice may actually be <em>under</em> 2 bucks. Not sure.<br /><br />Pizza Palace has fallen out of favor with me b/c they've raised their prices. I know it's only what a dime, but it's kind of the principle of it I guess, especially since PP isn't all that outstanding. Good, not great. Alba's on 37th and Ditmars is my second fave pizza joint in the area.<br /><br />And now for the refrain, which always comes up when I or someone else here waxes poetic about za: &quot;God I miss 31...&quot; &nbsp;:cry:<br /><br />e: I crossed with Mr. Coltrane, who said it far more economically than I. &nbsp; :D
