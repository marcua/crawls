				Because they were horribly overpriced? I only ate there once and the hamburger was mediocre at best. Not worth the $15 or however many dollars it was. I never thought twice about going in there again.

				I went once for lunch and I thought the food was good.&nbsp; Not great but good.&nbsp; It was way overpriced though my burger, soda and fries cost me about $25 with tax and tip.

				It&#039;s not my kind of food, but they were pretty busy most times I passed by. <br /><br /><br />I bet their rent has gone up since all the development in that area w/the Kaufman Studios outdoor lot<br />expansion on 36th Street, the Queens Council of the Arts opening an office nearby on 37th St., etc.<br /><br /><br />The landlord can probably get more for that corner spot and they probably can&#039;t afford it.

				They had good happy hour specials.&nbsp; $2 sliders and $4 beers (good beer too - Racer 5 IPA).&nbsp; I had their signature burger once or twice and thought it was just ok but I loved their happy hour deals.&nbsp; I hope something decent takes its place but that may be a cursed corner.

				It always seemed busy when I walked by and I ate in there a few times, with mixed results. One time they had only one bartender on duty and I waited and waited and waited until I left to go across the street to Pizzera Uno.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Another time, more recently, I thought the bartender was rude and cold. She and the others seemed to spend more time talking to one another than they did tending on their customers. I had been in the 5 Napkin Burger on the corner of Second Ave. &amp; 14th St. in Manhattan and they had Stevens Point on tap. I asked the bartender if they had it at the Astoria location and she said &quot;I have no idea what they serve in the other locations. I have never been in one.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />So, while that place came in handy for a bite, I have very mixed emotions about its demise.

				Noticed today that, as far as I can tell, there&#039;s nothing else left in that building that 5NB occupied- I know their used to be an insurance agency, a sports collectibles store, and a spa- and they all appear to be gone. Makes me wonder if the owner has bigger plans for that property? Anyone have any idea?

				I walked by on Sunday and the place has been completely empty. Kind of sad to see.&nbsp; First the Cup and then Three Napkin Burger has occupied that site for a number of years.&nbsp; I was sort of surprised to read about the demise of TNB because it seemed to be crowded everytime I was in there. With the multi-plex and AMMI in that area, I&#039;m surprised so many businesses on that stretch of 35th Avenue have had trouble making a go of it.&nbsp; There were at least two restaurants on the same block as TNB that also failed. And that frozen yogurt place across the street on the next block across from the multi-plex also closed.
