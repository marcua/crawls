			Hello,<br /><br />I have already purchased a fruit and vegetable share for the 2014 Hellgate CSA season (http://www2.hellgatecsa.net/) . I have been a member for a number of years and I love it but by myself it is a lot of fruits and veggies. Ideally I would be able to alternate weeks and split the cost with someone else. Anyone who is interested please email me at caroline.abella (at) gmail.com for details. <br /><br />Thanks!<br />
