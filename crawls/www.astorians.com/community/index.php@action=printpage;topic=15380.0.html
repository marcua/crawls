				http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/26/nyregion/26bennett.html?hpw<br /><br />Tony Bennett sings about leaving his heart in San Francisco. But when he talks, it seems to have remained in Astoria, the western Queens neighborhood where he grew up.<br /><br />Times Topics: Tony Bennett“The finest place to live,” Mr. Bennett, 82, said as he showed a reporter his favorite haunts. “I’ve been all over the world — Paris and Florence and Capri — and yet I come back here and I like this better than any place I’ve ever lived.”<br /><br />Mr. Bennett lives on West 57th Street in Manhattan now, but visits his old neighborhood regularly, and it seems to transport him back in time to when he’d stare longingly at the shimmering skyline of Manhattan across the East River. It is only a 15-minute subway ride away, but to a young Anthony Dominick Benedetto, the son of an Italian immigrant grocer, it loomed large and distant like Oz.<br /><br />“When you’d see this big city, you’d say, ‘Boy, someday wouldn’t it be great to become famous in that great city there?” he said, standing where Astoria Park meets the East River and overlooks the skyline. Heading back down 21st Street, he pointed out Riccardo’s by the Bridge catering hall and said, “I worked as a singing waiter there.”<br /><br />He had come on this drizzly afternoon to tour a sleek new building that, in September, will become the new home of the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts, a public school of 640 students that has been operating in nearby Long Island City since 2001.<br /><br />Mr. Bennett, his wife, Susan, and their Exploring the Arts foundation helped open the Sinatra school, using his Astoria connections — Peter F. Vallone Sr., who also grew up in the neighborhood, was then the speaker of the New York City Council, and George Kaufman, of Kaufman Astoria Studios, donated the land. On a lovely rooftop area in the new building that connects through sliding glass doors to the student cafeteria, Mr. Bennett spoke of his own education at the High School of Industrial Arts in Manhattan: Great school, crummy building.<br /><br />“We went to lunch and the ceiling fell down on the desks,” he said. “We would have been smashed — that’s how terrible the building was.” He surveyed the space with a satisfied look and announced, “That won’t happen here.”<br /><br />Although Sinatra’s Class of 2009 attended classes in less impressive spaces, their commencement on Friday will be in the new building — in the Tony Bennett Concert Hall, where Mr. Bennett will sing for the students. Bruce Willis is the keynote speaker (previous commencement headliners have included Jerry Seinfeld, Kevin Spacey, Wynton Marsalis, Harry Belafonte and Mario M. Cuomo). <br /><br />On Wednesday, Mr. Bennett tested the acoustics in the impressive space, which were designed with the help of Tom Young, a longtime sound engineer for both himself and Sinatra. From the stage, Mr. Bennett barked a husky note — “Bah!” — out into the empty theater. Then he clapped his hands repeatedly to show how the notes leap out into the space but do not echo and linger long.<br /><br />“It’s a perfect concert hall,” he pronounced.<br /><br />The school offers drama, dance, music, film and fine arts programs, selecting students through highly competitive auditions; many of them are destined for elite colleges, conservatories or art schools. The sleek new five-story building, designed by the prominent Polshek Partnership architecture firm, has state-of-the-art classrooms, a media center with film editing equipment, two dance studios and music studios with a recording booth.<br /><br />Touring the school, Mr. Bennett greeted construction workers, cleaners and painters putting on finishing touches. He shook hands and signed a hard hat. He scuffed his loafers across the floor of the two black-box theaters. He constantly pulled out his camera to take pictures.<br /><br />He stopped in at the sculpture studio, with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Astoria rooftops toward where Mr. Bennett grew up in a meager two-story house on 32nd Street near Ditmars Boulevard during the Great Depression. <br /><br />Young Anthony, who had two siblings — one died when he was 10 — raised pigeons on the roof and played in Astoria Pool, where synchronized swimmers would perform to the Glenn Miller Orchestra’s “Moonlight Serenade.” Even as a child, he sang whenever and wherever he could, including next to Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia during the 1936 opening ceremony for the Triborough Bridge.<br /><br />He worked Astoria clubs and, after serving in World War II in Europe, studied vocal technique on the G.I. Bill and began performing at small settings in Manhattan, where he was discovered by Bob Hope, who suggested that he use the name “Tony Bennett.” Among his many albums is “Astoria: Portrait of the Artist,” a 1990 retrospective.<br /><br />On Wednesday, Mr. Bennett drove past the quaint row houses and headed down Steinway Street, then made a left on 28th Avenue and stopped in for lunch at Piccola Venezia, a mainstay here for 36 years. Ezio Vlacich, the restaurant’s gregarious owner, hugged Mr. Bennett and the bar crowd turned to say hello. Mr. Bennett took his usual corner table, marked with a shiny metal plate that says “Tony Bennett Corner.” <br /><br />Luke Gasparre, 85, a bar patron who lives around the corner, brought in a class photo from Steinway Junior High School’s class of 1942, with a smiling Anthony Benedetto on the far left. He recalled working with Mr. Bennett in a local nightclub when they were teenagers.<br /><br />“Right under the El,” he said. “I tap-danced and you sang.”<br /><br />

				Nifty article!<br /><br />Sounds like they are going to have fully outfitted sculpture studios.&nbsp; I wonder if they&#039;ll ever offer after school hours pottery classes.&nbsp; I&#039;d love to have a place nearby to take classes.

				I think the school should be renamed the Tony Bennett School.&nbsp; He did a lot more for Astoria then Frank ever did.

				I lived around the corner from Tony growing up in Astoria at 23-20 32nd St. in the 40&#039;s and early 50&#039;s. The article says he lived on 32nd but it was actually 33rd St. between 23rd Ave. and 23rd Rd., 23-16 if the Google Earth map is correct.<br /><br />Tony had a lot of family in the area and I was good friends with his younger cousin Frank. Frank&#039;s father had been a vaudeville dancer and I saw an article where Tony credited his uncle with encouraging him to become a performer. <br /><br />Tony&#039;s brother John would take us fishing in Whitestone for flounder or blues. My uncles hung around with his older cousins.<br /><br />After WWll Tony had a job singing in a place called Walsh&#039;s on 31st St. right at the foot of the West side exit stairs from the el. He used the name Joe Bari, Bari being the town in Italy his father had been from.<br /><br />He was a local hero to all the kids in the neighborhood and was always a nice guy who said hello and joked around with the us when we saw him. He was the first person we ever saw with mirrored sunglasses and we thought he was definitely the sharpest guy in NYC. Nice memories.&nbsp;

				He lived on the first floor of 23-07 32nd street in the first apartment to the right with windows facing 32nd street. You can see a photo of it if you look at Tony&#039;s album called &quot;Astoria&quot; where he&#039;s posed in front of the building as a young man and an old man.
