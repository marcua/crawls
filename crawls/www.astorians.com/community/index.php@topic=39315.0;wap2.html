			Queens Council on the Arts LAB presents a workshop hosted by QCA grant-winner Shervone Neckles, providing a behind-the-scenes look at preparing for solo exhibitions: from negotiating, grant writing, balancing work commitments, studio time, refining an editing work all while using the current project to leverage other opportunities. Shervone also will screen the first iteration of the &quot;Give and Take&quot; animation and request audience feedback in preparation of the final stage. <br /><br />The concept and title of the &quot;Give and Take Project&quot; derives from a rare tree species native to Central America. The tree contains both a powerful toxin and its own antidote. The works in the exhibition takes viewers on a creative expedition on the complex cycles of nature and the ineffable spirit of the black woman&#039;s body.<br /><br />Friday, April 8th, 6:30pm<br /><br />Queens Council on the Arts<br />37-11 35th Ave, Entrance on 37th St<br />Astoria, NY 11101<br /><br />Register Here: http://www.queenscouncilarts.org/calendar/2016/3/16/artist-solo-exhibition-preparation
