				So, in the most recent negative nods thread, it was suggested that we have another meetup.&nbsp; Our January dinner at Koliba was a lot of fun, an it would be great to gather again.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to put out there <strong>Sunday, March 21</strong> for brunch.&nbsp; We can always choose another date, too. Any suggestions as to where?

				I can&#039;t make any of those dates, but you&#039;re awesome for setting this up, Meg.<br /><br />I remember the Dillinger&#039;s brunch; I had a great time but I thought there were some people who had complaints about the setup (not the food).&nbsp; I don&#039;t remember the specifics; I had no complaints.

				Arg.. I won&#039;t be able to make it that weekend. :-( I&#039;m sorry. For those who go, I recommend the Ovelia sausage as well as the whole wheat banana pancakes.

				I&#039;m sure Megc is starting a new list in order to give an accurate count to Ovelia.&nbsp; Usually about a quarter to a half will have to cancel due to work and other obligations, so it&#039;s best to get an accurate count.&nbsp; I definitely won&#039;t be able to make it as I got the call to jury duty out in lovely Jamaica this morning, and therefore will have no life due to everything being backed up because of it.&nbsp; Have fun though, Ovelia&#039;s food is really good.

				The Ovelia Sausages OMG, delicious!<br /><br />oh and p.s. regarding the raw milk, the dairy is F &amp; C Brooks and sons, on the list they&#039;re listed as being in Kingston but no, they&#039;re in Stone Ridge.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a link the lists all the dairy farms selling raw cow/goats milk.<br /><br />http://www.wapf-stwny.org/Raw_Milk_NY1.pdf<br />

				Was great to see everyone yesterday!&nbsp; Really nice to meet Mer and catch up with those I knew already.&nbsp; Ovelia&#039;s brunch was delicious - especially loved the house-made sausage.&nbsp; June will hail our next event - suggestions are welcome!

				It was great to see you all we definitely should meet again.&nbsp; I was thinking of something different...why don&#039;t we plan a picnic in Astoria Park?&nbsp; That way those of us that have pets can take our doggies, all of us make something and bring it to the picnic and just enjoy the company and views and summer.&nbsp;

				Sure. You bring the tables and the chairs, and the rest of us cook. I prefer meals where someone else cooks and cleans up, just like I prefer hotels with 24/7 room service. Or to put it another way, my idea of a really great picnic is in the living room with take-out and disposables (plates, cups and utensils)!<br /><br />But thanks for the great idea, Liz!<br /><br />&nbsp;:-D
