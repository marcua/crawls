				Does anyone have any thoughts on the food selection on 36th ave around 33rd street?&nbsp; Would a high -end gourmet soup sandwhich take out work in that neighborhood?&nbsp; Is there the clientele for an excellent chef opening a small place and building a reputation?

				A nice soup and sandwich place would be very nice!&nbsp; A good Chinese restaurant would be even better.

				A vegetarian restaurant around the 30th Ave stop would do even better as there aren&#39;t many veg options and there are a lot of us up here!&nbsp; Or even a nice cozy cafe with sandwiches and a bunch of couches to relax in.

				I thought Sai is opening a veg restaurant on 30th ave?<br /><br />36th...I finally took a walk down there last weekend and it doesn&#39;t look like there&#39;s a market for gourmet ANYTHING.&nbsp; That street looked pretty crappy.&nbsp; Maybe 34th or 35th.

				Sai is opening a veg restaurant??&nbsp; what?&nbsp; do elaborate...<br />is that what is going on with keystone diner?&nbsp; <br /><br />I think the takeout choices around 36th ave stop are pretty crap, but I&#39;m not often there.&nbsp; I can promise to check it out, if you go for it (and have trekked further for tasty things, that&#39;s for sure!)&nbsp; &nbsp;good luck!<br /><br />

I&#39;d say dinner service is probably going to pay more bills than lunch.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck.&nbsp; <br /><br />How about a burger joint with good music (see other threads) on the jukebox and occasional live bands?&nbsp; I&#39;d go<br />

				Yes, I&#39;d check it out.&nbsp; I just recently moved to the 36th Ave stop and often find myself wishing that there were more resturants and food shops like the ones I&#39;ve found on Broadway.&nbsp; Good luck!
