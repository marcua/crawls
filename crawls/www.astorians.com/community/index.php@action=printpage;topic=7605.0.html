				I vaguely remember something like that in a thread where someone was complaining about the trash/snow/slipperiness of the stairs at the Ditmars station. (?)&nbsp; I&#039;ve done several searches but haven&#039;t pulled it up, but maybe that will help you or someone else find it.

				Woo hoo!! Thanks guys for all the info.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been riding the 6 lately coming home from work and have ridden with this subway driver who is horrible. He jams on the gas, and jams on the breaks over and over again all the way up the 6 line. On 5 (five) separate occasions I&#039;ve walked to the front of the train to verify that it&#039;s the same guy and it is. What is most disturbing is that if you walk to the front of the train and look in the driver&#039;s window <em>every time</em> I&#039;ve done that the guy is sleeping (full on eyes closed, slumped over)! Then the buzzer goes off (from the conductor) and he sort of half wakes up and jams on the gas. Last week was the last straw for me, so I&#039;m calling to complain about him - I just don&#039;t think the guy is safe.

				I recommend noting the date/time as well.<br /><br />Maybe reporting it via 311? Or better yet, contact your local City Council person. Like Vallone or something.....<br /><br />There&#039;s also the &quot;If you see something, say something&quot; hotline. And after all, a sleeping train operator is a safety issue. :|<br /><br />http://www.mta.info/mta/security/index.html<br /><br />Somethign tells me you&#039;ll get better results by filing a complaint outside the MTA.<br /><br />Let us knwo what happens.
