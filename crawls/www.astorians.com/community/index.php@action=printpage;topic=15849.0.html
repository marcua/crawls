				<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><em>Thank you, Mr. President, for the most humbling honor of my life. You have nominated me to serve on the country&#039;s highest court, and I am deeply moved. <br /><br />I could not, in the few minutes I have today, mention the names of the many friends and family who have guided and supported me throughout my life, and who have been instrumental in helping me realize my dreams. <br />I see many of those faces in this room. Each of you, whom I love deeply, will know that my heart today is bursting with gratitude for all you have done for me. <br /><br />The President has said to you that I bring my family. In the audience is my brother Juan Sotomayor — he&#039;s a physician in Syracuse, New York; my sister-in-law, Tracy (ph); my niece Kiley — she looks like me. <br /><br />My twin nephews, Conner and Corey. <br /><br />I stand on the shoulders of countless people, yet there is one extraordinary person who is my life aspiration. That person is my mother, Celina Sotomayor. <br /><br />My mother has devoted her life to my brother and me. And as the President mentioned, she worked often two jobs to help support us after dad died. I have often said that I am all I am because of her, and I am only half the woman she is. <br /><br />Sitting next to her is Omar Lopez, my mom&#039;s husband and a man whom I have grown to adore. I thank you for all that you have given me and continue to give me. I love you. <br /><br />I chose to be a lawyer and ultimately a judge because I find endless challenge in the complexities of the law. I firmly believe in the rule of law as the foundation for all of our basic rights. <br /><br />For as long as I can remember, I have been inspired by the achievement of our founding fathers. They set forth principles that have endured for than more two centuries. Those principles are as meaningful and relevant in each generation as the generation before. </em> &nbsp;</span> <br /><br /><div align="center"><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><em><strong>FELICIDADES SONIA!!</strong></em></span>&nbsp; &nbsp;(http://images-partners-tbn.google.com/images?q=tbn:m7a3La_RROPGqM:therealrevo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/sotomayor_nz_0526.jpg)<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IegH8S8QM5M (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IegH8S8QM5M)</div>
