				Why all this divisiveness, Jtrane?<br /><br />Call me a pervert, call me a sicko, tell me I&#39;m the greatest threat to family values in America today ... but I like Emack&amp;Bolios - AND La Guli - AND Cones (the yogurt gelato rocks my world! &nbsp;and I like to go to &quot;fish&quot; right down the street... but I digress). &nbsp;<br /><br />Yes, I love them all. &nbsp;At the same time. &nbsp; &nbsp; :evil:<br /><br />(only in small amounts because sugar makes me weird. &nbsp;like those M&amp;Ms i just finished off.)<br />

				Sorry.&nbsp; Didn&#39;t mean to be divisive.&nbsp; I was just being a little self indulgent and explaining what I prefer.&nbsp; I just get overwhelmed by all the stuff Emack&#39;s puts in their ice cream.&nbsp; But I do love me the rice crispy treat dipped waffle cones they have.&nbsp; I&#39;d just love to see some simpler ice cream flavors there.&nbsp; That&#39;s all.&nbsp; Oh shoot! I forgot that they have cookies and cream!!!&nbsp; That&#39;s my jam.&nbsp; I dig on the cookies and cream at Emack.&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				Ive never been to emacks before and its looking real good.<br /><br />Never had gelato at la guli (after italy im not sure if anyone has the good stuff here)<br /><br />La guli does have the very best in cannolis anywhere and that includes brunos bakery on laguardia or bleeker street pastery.<br /><br />I am a purist with gelato. Gelato is great alone because you have a small amount.<br />But great quality ice cream studded with chucks of something rich makes it 10x better. &nbsp;Ice cream alone is smooth, the addition of texture really does it for me. &nbsp;Texture baby!<br /><br />Enigmacat, As for your comment about yogurt gelato, Ill talk with you about this at another time. &nbsp;You may have some serious issues...<br /><br />My nephews are here for dinner tonight so I may have to take them for ice cream.

				I&#39;m going to have to give Emack &amp; Bolio&#39;s another try before I make a final decision as to how I feel about their ice cream.&nbsp; What I did have there I thought was just ok -- very tasty, but it didn&#39;t make me go &quot;wow!&quot;.&nbsp; However, I really like the gelato at La Guli, though, and I&#39;ll just say that their carrot cake is the best (I&#39;m eating a piece right now, yum!).<br /><br />It&#39;s nice to see people get so excited about ice cream/gelato, whether it&#39;s E&amp;B or La Guli.

				I can understand being an ice cream purist, having too much stuff in my ice cream can be annoying (ahem, COLD STONE, cough cough).<br /><br />Emack&#39;s Peanut Butter Cup ice cream is so delicious. &nbsp;Its chocolate icecream with peanut butter in it. &nbsp;I don&#39;t think there are actual peanut butter cups in it. &nbsp;I&#39;ve had peanut butter w/ choco ice cream at other places, and it would be too rich. &nbsp;But at Emack&#39;s it is a perfect balance. &nbsp;<br /><br />The grasshopper ice cream is my second emack favorite. &nbsp;<br /><br />(and I also love moosetracks!)<br /><br />March 1st can&#39;t come soon enough.

				I love their nonfat chocolate yogurt, it is so rich and yummy! but they don&#39;t always have it :(<br /><br /><br />And Jonathan, I actually have to agree with enigmacat about yogurt gelato, though I&#39;m not sure we&#39;re talking about the same thing. I&#39;ve only ever had it in Italy... and it is just plain yogurt flavored gelato... with that nice tangy yogurt flavor<br /><br /><em>mmmm.... a cone of chocolate and yogurt gelato from Cavassa.... mmmm</em> ahh summer dreams!

				Peanut Butter cup ice cream on a peanut butter cup cone ... <em>plus</em> hand roasted coffee? All across the street from a terrific Thai restaurant less than 60 seconds from my front door ... I may have just died and managed to make it to heaven after all ... <br /><br />March 1 can&#39;t come soon enough is right! Was on their website looking at all their flavors ... mmm ... <br /><br />http://www.emackandbolios.com/icecream2.htm<br /><br />Is this list accurate or do they offer only certain things at certain locations?
