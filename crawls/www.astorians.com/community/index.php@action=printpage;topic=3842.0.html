				For me, it&#39;s not about the attitude, it&#39;s about the designs and what they can do with so little time. I&#39;ve been hating the extra forced drama this season.<br /><br />mcdirk, I think it&#39;s between Jeffrey and Uli. I wasn&#39;t a fan of either this whole season, but I love their final collections.<br /><br />I&#39;m not particularly angry about last week&#39;s episode. I think Laura did the right thing to speak her mind sooner rather than later. I also don&#39;t think Jeffrey cheated and he shouldn&#39;t have anything to worry about. It was just edited for the drama. I read somewhere that Jeffrey went over to Laura&#39;s place to watch the reunion episode with her, so it&#39;s not like things ended badly between them.

				Schmennifer - I hope you&#39;re right.&nbsp; I think she had a right to raise the issues, I just don&#39;t think she handled it properly.&nbsp; Go to him first, and from the editing, they made her look so hostile to him.&nbsp; I&#39;d actually disliked Jeffrey until the next to the last episode and had been rooting for Laura, but their actions/reactions turned me around at this point.&nbsp; <br /><br />Artstart - I think Uli and Jeff seem to have really strong collections - I can&#39;t wait to see how they it all turns out.&nbsp; There are things about all four of them I like, I&#39;m don&#39;t really dislike any of them, though I think Laura handled this in a bad way (at least from the way it got edited - I suspect Bravo is just feeding the flames to get ratings).<br /><br />NYCMacuser - the Key Food is good for attitude, but no one gets voted out!&nbsp; If they would vote out the worst cashier each week, I&#39;d be more excited (especially if they said something witty, &quot;In grocery store, one week you are employed, and one week you are out.....&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;anything along those lines would do it for me.

				I can&#39;t wait for the next season of America&#39;s Top Chef, though Dave was ROBBED last season, robbed I tell you.&nbsp; I tried to like Tiffany when watching them over, and I just can&#39;t warm to her. <br /><br />Jeffrey&#39;s neck tattoo is very odd - what was he thinking?&nbsp; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very attractive and he&#39;s generally a handsome man.&nbsp; I like Uli, though I&#39;m routing for Jeffrey.&nbsp; When they told her story of coming from East Germany, I think it helped give some insight into her background and made me like her style more.&nbsp; Michael has been great all season, but youch, his current collection looks pretty weird from what they&#39;ve shown.&nbsp; Laura&#39;s looks seem nice, but very similar to what she&#39;s been doing.&nbsp; Where in NYC is her loft?<br />

				HMPF!<br />Ok, I pased by last Wednesday, and basically, there was nobody there. Sad, because this is a nice place with a nice mood setting. Seems like Bungalo better get their s___ together and learn how to promote, or die like the other smalls clubs in Astoria did. You can pump all the specials you want, but if you&#039;re not drawing a crowd, you won&#039;t sell liquor;hence, you won&#039;t be a profitable establishment that folks enjoy. If your consistently inviting just your friends, then that&#039;s what will be there begging for another free drink, until you close down.....<br /><br />Recall when it was Amnesia? or some of the other club closing like KRASH, and bars along Steinway?<br /><br />WTF....<br /><br />GET WITH IT!<br /><br />Get the right DJ&#039;s, and promote!!! Where&#039;s Rob the DJ? what did you guys do to change it up, and just not draw people?<br /><br />ughh, I&#039;m so frustrated there no places left for us Astorians to really have fun, gay fun that is..<br /><br />If you guys need help with you Wed night thingie, send me a note:<br />ErikAviance@aol.com, or my Mother, mother.juanAviance@verizon.net<br /><br /><br /><br />

				It does seem that Bungalo isn&#039;t really happening these days.&nbsp; Their bartender left, as did Rob.&nbsp; Caos, Clic, Bungalo, Cave, something needs to last on that strip.&nbsp; They just don&#039;t promote it well and don&#039;t work get a crowd coming in regularly (plus it being one night a week sucks).

				I have said this all along, and I&#039;ll say it one more time.&nbsp; What is needed in Astoria is another gay owned and operated bar that caters to the GLBT community seven days a week.&nbsp; No more &#039;nights&#039; at a straight establishment on their slow nights (hoping they can make a fast gay buck).<br /><br />Anyone have the capital or desire to open a bar?&nbsp; Be a trailblazer, I dare ya!<br /><br />xoxo<br /><br />CS

				I guess Astoria is so close to Manhattan that most just choose to get on the train when they want to go out, I&#039;m guilty of that ;)

				We all are guilty of that, but that&#039;s why we live in Astoria.&nbsp; Cheaper rent so we can afford to go out in the city.&nbsp; Still, it would be nice to have a couple of different watering holes here just a hop skip and a jump from home.<br /><br />

				I just always take the train anyway.&nbsp; Where do you like to go out of the places around now?&nbsp; I don&#039;t mind Albatross, but wouldn&#039;t go out of my way to go there either.&nbsp; I know that Brick, Cafe Bar and Crescent Lounge have a big mixed crowd, but what about other nearby places?

				I get to all three locations periodically, less so now that I&#039;m in a relationship, but if they were gay all the time, I&#039;d go there at least once a week, if not more, to be supportive.

				Crescent Lounge is pretty gay nowadays, at least the handful of times I&#039;ve been there. I&#039;ve always had fun there and met new people, unlike bars in Chelsea or even the East Village. Last Friday night was mixed, but I&#039;d guess more than 50% gay.

				Crescent is a great place, very gay friendly too.&nbsp; Are some nights gayer there than others?

				Anytime I&#039;ve been there I would say every guy was gay except for maybe one at the most.&nbsp; There are a lot of women too, mayguess would also be about half the crowd as noted below.&nbsp; I would say it&#039;s more a matter of what nights (and at what time) there are people there.&nbsp;
