				The Autumnal Equinox was today at 12:03am.&nbsp; It&#39;s really fall now!<br /><br />Vern will be back in 6 months or so.&nbsp; Can&#39;t wait.&nbsp; He says that he&#39;s looking forward to coming out of hiding next spring.

				I prefer hot to cold weather anyday (I&#39;m a Texan, after all), but I must admit fall is my favorite season.&nbsp; :-) It means xmas is around the corner and the trees get so lovely and football on the tele and my favorite holiday (Thanksgiving) and it&#39;s cool enough to bake again and Starbucks rolls out all those &quot;spice&quot; special drinks. Eeee!<br /><br />My love for fall has gotten even bigger since I moved here because, well, it&#39;s actually a season up here! With lots more color in the trees and such. In Texas, fall is like one week in late Oct/early Nov.

				Spring has typically been my favorite season, but lately I have had some conflicting thoughts about Fall. I am afraid that I may have to cheat on Spring and enjoy my time with Fall this year. Lovely sweaters, hay rides, harvest time, beautiful leaves, hot tea, curling up with a good book...all good things.&nbsp; :smitten:

				I like Spring and Fall equally.&nbsp; As for winter?&nbsp; Forget it!&nbsp; I hate it so much.&nbsp; I am just glad that it doesn&#39;t snow as much in the city as it did upstate!&nbsp; Now, if we didn&#39;t have that cold wind, I&#39;d be okay with the season.

				I agree with MandaT.&nbsp; I like hot weather, Summer is my favorite season, though Fall and Spring can both be nice.&nbsp; My Georgia roots keep me from appreciating Winter.&nbsp; I still am not a fan of snow.

				Love fall, love love autumn - my favorite season. September and October I think are my favorite months. When I lived in Ecuador with no real seasons, I missed fall the very most.<br /><br />Cool crisp air, but not too cold, not too hot. Perfect for taking walks amidst trees of orange, yellow, red. The golden hue of late afternoon, the sun slanting down on fallen leaves. Apple cider, pumpkin picking, harvest season. Ahhh, autumn.
