				GS 300, fully loaded, 75,500 miles, excellent condition, Gray exterior, black leather interior, second owner: $11,215<br /><br />I bought this car in October 2007. It&#039;s a great car, total luxury, and has balls. I moved to Astoria in June and never use the car. <br /><br />If you are interested pm me.<br /><br />P.S. $11,215 is a steal! I just pulled it from Kelly&#039;s Blue Book. Prior to gas going up and the economy slumping I would have asked for way more.

				Don&#039;t take this bad but I don&#039;t think that you&#039;ll get too many offers if you&#039;re not willing to at least e-mail the vin so that the interested party can run a CarFax report before bringing any money to the table.

				Current kbb.com value on a 2001 gs300 fully loaded is $11,085 in excellent condition, good condition is $10,360. I would also suggest giving the vin number, unless you&#039;ve got something to hide. Not that I&#039;m looking but I&#039;ve never even looked at a car without first checking out the carfax first and that is what was advised to me years ago by a dealer.

				For the past 6 month I have been looking to replace my aged Lincoln Continental with a similar luxury, full-packed sedan. I&#039;ve been using <span class="bbc_u">eBay Motors</span> (http://search.ebay.com/_W0QQtZvbQQsofindtypeZ21QQsacatZ-1), <span class="bbc_u">Kelley Blue Book</span> (http://usedcars.kbb.com/fyc_kbb/index.jsp?address=11102&amp;LNX=KBBATHPUCFYCSF), and haunting the used car dealers on Route 46 in New Jersey. But I won&#039;t even look at any car until I know the VIN and look at the <span class="bbc_u">Carfax</span> (http://www.carfax.com/) report! In fact some used car dealers let you get the report on their account so you don&#039;t have to pay for it.<br /><br />NO VIN = NO DEAL!

				No vin = no deal, as has been said several times already, and I will add that the price seems a bit excessive to me.&nbsp; Higher, obviously, than even the blue book value as pointed out by Bentley&#039;s Dad.

Perhaps it would have been easier if you had told us exactly what options there are. Does it have a cd changer? Does it have a navigation system? Etc etc. I selected all of the the options that I know a gs300 to have had in 2001. Fully loaded can mean many things depending on options, obviously. The price in gas and the economy have NOTHING to do with the price of a sale of a vehicle to a private buyer. The value of a vehicle will always be less as time passes, unless it is a 30 year old Pontiac GTO or the like, which a Lexus gs300 certainly isn&#039;t.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Obviously I would give the VIN number to an interested buyer.

How did you intend to even get an &quot;interested buyer&quot; if they aren&#039;t even able to check on the history of said vehicle before contacting you to see what they going to see to begin with? FYI, a vin # cannot be used to track you nor can someone find out any personal information about you through it. This must be the first time you&#039;ve sold a car privately judging from how you&#039;ve gone about it so far.<br /><br />

				Golly, why&#039;s everyone up in AAPA&#039;s grill? &nbsp;There have been other cars for sale on this board without posted VINs (like http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=12963.0 and http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=10940.0). &nbsp;Why harass this person?
