				Has anyone ever been to small claims court? We are filing due to an issue with our former landlord and our security deposit.&nbsp; Any info or advice would be appreciated!

				Did you read the tip sheet provided by the court? I actually found it useful.&nbsp; Since it is your word against the landlord&#039;s document everything you can to remove as much doubt as you can and avoid problems over who really said what and how things could be interpreted by each party.&nbsp; Also, narrow your argument down to only what is really relevant to the issue, and explain it in the simplest terms possible.

				definitely have ALL paperwork for the judge/mediator to look at and organized.&nbsp; <br />dont talk about ANY other topics other than what you are suing for.&nbsp; the landlord will try to drag other issues irrelevant to your matter into it in order to &quot;smear&quot; you - dont let them do it! <br />best thing is to lieterally write down talking points that you can read from. dont deviate from the &quot;Script&quot; as you dont want to talk yourself into a corner. <br />photos help too, if the issue is re: property damage<br /><br />good luck!<br /><br />

				My former roommate and I took our old landlord to small claims court. I&#039;m not going to lie - it was a pain in the ass but we did get our money back. She withheld about $600 from our deposit after telling me on the phone that the apartment looked great and she would put our checks in the mail. Meantime, weeks go by and no checks. My former roommate, a bit of a difficult person to put it kindly, promptly got on the phone and left harrassing messages about our money. I firmly believe this is what caused the landlady to go crazy and not return the money.<br /><br />So my old roommate (RM) threatens to get a lawyer and take her to small claims. All of a sudden the apartment was referred to as &quot;trashed&quot; with a broken window, moldy tub and shower, broken ceiling fans, and filthy kitchen. It was ridiculous - all lies. I personally scrubbed, on my hands and knees, the entire kitchen and bathroom. And I stood on a ladder to clean the ceiling fan. It was insane. Oh yeah - to top it off the landlord (LL) and our lawyer (RM&#039;s boyfriend) began a series of crazy phone wars with the landlord saying that everyone complained about us, our place was filthy and that my roommate cleaned more than I did. Then she made a comment about being in our apartment several times without us being present. Can you believe that s___?<br /><br />So onto small claims - first date, she didn&#039;t appear and didn&#039;t send a lawyer. Second date she sent a lawyer who got schooled for not having her there. Third time she shows and gives a song and dance about having cancer and never received the court notices b/c she was getting chemo. The judge was pissed that we both had lawyers. She came with pictures and phony receipts. Pictures were of stuff my roommate threw in the trash. We ended up getting all of our money back. My advice - go for it, but be prepared that it won&#039;t be resolved quickly, and while we were lucky and she ended up sending us our checks shortly after the judgement, that is not usually the case. For us, it turned into a matter of not letting her get away with lying, even though is was only for a small amount of money.

				I&#039;m not even being funny here: Watch and listen to People&#039;s Court on Channel 5 at 4 in the afternoon and Channel 9 at 9 in the morning.&nbsp; If you&#039;re at work, which most of us are, tape it!&nbsp; I&#039;m being totally serious here.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t have the theateratics and BS law that Mathias does and because it&#039;s actually in NY, you sometimes learn the relevant small claims law.&nbsp; Also, listen to the questions that Judge Milian asks and how people respond.&nbsp; When I wasn&#039;t working for an extended period, I watched that show religiously and actually learned a little something. <br /><br />Good luck!

				thanks for the tips!&nbsp; I read you couldn&#039;t have a lawyer in small claims court, but we didn&#039;t plan on getting one anyway.&nbsp; Our landlord was nothing but decent to us until this point so I&#039;m really upset about it.&nbsp; We were perfect tenants and he didn&#039;t want us to leave... but as soon as we said the words &quot;security deposit&quot; he started making up stories and charges.&nbsp; We have a very good case so I am hopeful, but I&#039;m just so frustrated that this happened to us.&nbsp; &nbsp;It sucks!

				I&#039;m having the same issue with my former landlord. Out of curiosity, did you file with the attorney general&#039;s office prior to this? That&#039;s my next step, I think, unless the advice of my lawyer-dad is just to sue them.

				we sent certified letters that gave him a deadline to come up with a more reasonable estimate and that stated we would file for small claims court if he didn&#039;t.&nbsp; After two letters and a half-hour argument with my husband in which my husband made it clear he would never win in court, he agreed to $1000 out of the $1200, which we just accepted.&nbsp; He had charged us $150 for a plumbing job (which was due to normal wear and tear) but we decided not to fight that.&nbsp; So send some certified letters first--- email me for a sample of mine if you&#039;d like.

				I&#039;ve sent certified letters as well, and have received the paperwork from the attorney general&#039;s office to file a rent security complaint. My issue is with more than just non-payment of the deposit--they &quot;lost&quot; it after we paid it, so they haven&#039;t been keeping it in an interest-bearing account as they&#039;re required to by law, and they never cashed my former roommate&#039;s last month&#039;s rent payment (they cashed mine though). The attorney general&#039;s office has actually been very helpful, but I&#039;d like to talk to someone who&#039;s gone through the process (successfully or unsuccesfully) to see what to expect. <br /><br />Did you have any costs related to filing in small claims court? I&#039;d definitely like to see the letters you sent. I&#039;ll shoot you an email in a minute.<br /><br />
