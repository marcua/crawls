				I did not get email notification of a PM that was sent to me yesterday.&nbsp; Like mcdirk, I noticed the notification on the board today - for me, both in the &quot;My Messages&quot; section of the grey bar under the photos, and in the upper right corner &quot;you have xxx messages, 1 is new&quot; section.

				I haven&#039;t gotten e-mail notices of forum replies since June 14.&nbsp; If they&#039;re coming in recognized as Spam, then being automatically deleted - though Yahoo lets in so much spam, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s the case.

				I think this time it was a problem with my own email. So hopefully it&#039;s working for everyone now.
