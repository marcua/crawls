				Hello all,<br /><br />Thanks to the recommendations of the Astorians, I purchased a digital camera and I couldn&#039;t be happier with it!&nbsp; And now I am asking for your advice on buying a smartphone.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had a really nice phone, but I think it&#039;s time to upgrade after settling for whatever AT&amp;T was trying to get rid of!<br /><br />That being said, I am intrigued by the AT&amp;T Blackberry Bold (http://www.blackberry.com/blackberrybold/), but I&#039;m wondering if I should wait until my contract expires in June 2009 and get the Verizon Wireless Blackberry Storm (http://www.blackberry.com/blackberrystorm/).<br /><br />Are there any other brands that you can recommend?&nbsp; I should add that I am looking for a phone last, and more for the added extras.&nbsp; Heck, I could keep the piece of crap I have now if I just needed a phone&nbsp; :-D<br />

				There is another well-known option offered by AT&amp;T that&#039;s made by a company named after a fruit, which you&#039;ve maybe heard of. I have a suspicion said company and product will lead to a long bickering thread similar to any mentioning of the &quot;h-word&quot; (h*pster).<br /><br />From the bit I&#039;ve paid attention, most reviews at this early point find the Bold a better choice right now. Lots of complaints of the Storm software feeling unfinished or worse (slow, freezing, etc.). <br /><br />Overall though, it will depend on what your primary usage is likely to be. If you bang out a million emails/sms&#039;s, you&#039;ll probably want to stick with a physical keyboard. If you&#039;re likely to do a lot more web-viewing, music/video watching and game playing, full touch is probably a better bet. <br /><br />Are you eligible for a phone upgrade discount? Otherwise get ready to fork over a good pile of money whatever you choose...<br /><br />

				On the news last night, they showed a long ass line outside some store selling the new Blackberry.&nbsp; Some reports say it&#039;s $200, the one this morning said $250.&nbsp; It&#039;s directly competing with the Iphone.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have a smart phone, my phone is just a C average student.&nbsp; But it works and the plan is cheap so I have no complaints.&nbsp; I can&#039;t recommend the blackberry, and have no idea why one would wait all hours in the cold for one.&nbsp; But the news did make it look cool.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t have the funds for either the phone or the plan, and I&#039;m afraid of the inevitable addiction I might have to it.&nbsp; I value my time away from the computer and from the job.&nbsp; It&#039;s like a rabbit hole I&#039;m afraid to fall into, even though I know I would love it.&nbsp; That&#039;s the problem.<br /><br />So maybe you should try that Blackberry.

				It really does depend on what device you are trying to retire. I will end up with the storm because my company uses the Blackberry enterprise, but if I cared more about browsing than e-mail I would definitely go with the Iphone. From what I understand the Storm comes with DataViz which allows you to edit Word, Excel&nbsp; and PowerPoint, just like Palm does. If stuff like that is not so important, than there is definitely better and cheaper plans than the Blackberry.<br /><br />I plan on checking out the Storm today.

				the BB Storm is $250 with 2-year contract. there is a $50 rebate for everyone. if you are on a VZW &quot;new every 2 plan&quot; and up for renewal, you can knock another $100 off it.<br /><br />TAG - are you up for renewal? the Bold (sans contract renewal) is probably $3-400. it looks pretty sold though. reviews have called it the best BB.<br /><br />i don&#039;t have a BB, but something similar - the ATT Blackjack. it&#039;s similar in form to a BB, but it runs Windows Mobile. i am pretty used to a physical keyboard, i dont think i could make the switch to the iPhone or BB Storm. <br /><br />i&#039;m getting 2 BB Storms at work sometime early next week to play with.

There was, fortunately, a fruit store nearby and my contract ends in December, so it was time for an upgrade.<br /><br />Granted, I have only had it a few days, but I really enjoy the thing and it&#039;s completely intuitive.<br /><br />I think what matters is, if you&#039;re buying it for extra features, what features are they?<br /><br />If you want it for work, it seems like the Blackberry products are the way to go. For me though, I like the idea of being able to find a restaurant when I&#039;m out and don&#039;t know the neighborhood I&#039;m in. I like having my music, I like being able to watch youtube. It depends on what you want.

				Thanks for all of the recommendations.&nbsp; I just bought the Bold on Steinway at the official AT&amp;T store.&nbsp; I initially went to Arjays, the authorized AT&amp;T dealer store, which is on Steinway, as well, but closer to Broadway, but they had some ridiculous price for my plan.&nbsp; Anyway, I will be spending the rest of the day playing with my new phone.

Rumor has it that next year they will introduce a hybrid type of Bold- with a touch screen AND a keyboard.

				I got HTC Touch with Sprint.&nbsp; <br /><br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#039;s&nbsp; fully customizable and there are a lot of free software for it<br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don’t have to pay for Blackberry service which&nbsp; is extra (Exchange server&nbsp; as fast as blackberry)<br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SERO Plan is the best bang for buck.&nbsp; &nbsp;$30 gives you&nbsp; 500 minutes&nbsp; +&nbsp; unlimited everything else<br />
