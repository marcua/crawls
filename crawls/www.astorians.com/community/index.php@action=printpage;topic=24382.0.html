				<br />I learned about Mealku a month or so ago from an article in the NYTimes.&nbsp; It may sound a bit odd at first, but I think folks who are into the whole social networking/couchsurfing/meetup/CSA/Food Co-op thing might like it.<br /><br />Basically it&#039;s a locally-based website for people who love to cook and share their food with others.&nbsp; Each person creates a profile.&nbsp; You pay $10 per month to be a member.&nbsp; The website then has their own &#039;currency&#039; called Ku.&nbsp; You earn Ku by offering up a home-cooked meal on the site for others to &#039;order&#039;.&nbsp; Mealku then has their own delivery people who go between the people who cook (to pick up the meals) and the people who ordered the meals (to deliver them).&nbsp; I think from the time the meal is picked until it&#039;s delivered is about two hours.&nbsp; (Most people generally order a meal 1-3 days in advance.)&nbsp; The food is kept in a foil-lined sealed bag.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway I think it&#039;s a really cool concept and so far I myself have gotten and given a few meals.&nbsp; The delivery charge (also based in the &#039;Ku&#039; currency) is based on the distance between you and the cook.&nbsp; So the website gives you the option to search for cooks/meals within a 3, 5 or 10 mile radius.&nbsp; Naturally if you prefer to spend less Ku, you want to find a cook that lives nearby.<br /><br />And this is part of the reason why I&#039;m here talking about how great Mealku is.&nbsp; It would be great if more people in the Astoria/LIC/Sunnyside areas were to become members....then I and other Astorians on Mealku would have more options to pick from.&nbsp; Right now I suspect most of their members are from Manhattan.... ;-( ...as there were a number of meals I wanted to order, until I saw that the cook was more than 4 miles away and so the delivery charge would be higher.<br /><br />People leave reviews after they&#039;ve received a meal, so in this way you can get a sense of whether they are a good cook or not.&nbsp; And I HAVE seen some constructive criticism in some of the reviews, which is a good thing IMHO.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather that than people giving fake raves for food, when in fact they didn&#039;t like it at all.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway check it out....it&#039;s a great alternative to traditional takeout ...and they will also be hosting periodic gatherings where you&#039;ll get a chance to meet other cooks.<br /><br />I think if you love cooking, and especially cooking for others and then receiving nice feedback on your meals, that Mealku will be right up your alley!<br /><br />Note that the website just went through an update so they are still working out a few kinks, but overall the system has been workikng well for me...<br /><br />https://www.mealku.com/<br /><br />
