				So in one of my visits to the doctor, she tells me air quality in Astoria is really bad.&nbsp; In the last few years of living here I seem to be developing allergies/breathing issues.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what the root cause of this is, but have you guys experienced developing or worsening breathing/allergy related issues after living in Astoria for a while?&nbsp; I live in 23rd Ave and the low 40s and never really thought about the traffic/fumes of the GCP/LIE/BQE but after the doc had her say, I am getting more conscious.&nbsp;

				Air quality does SUCK here and I live by the park. I started developing allergies when I moved back to Astoria from Monterey 15 years ago. I have sinus problems, itchy eyes, sore throat pretty much year-round. Still it hasn&#039;t stopped me from outdoor activities like tennis, jogging. The only thing that helps me is Claritin non-drowsy, but I don&#039;t take it regularly because it takes a toll on me after prolonged use.

				I dont think its just Astoria, its more like NYC as a whole has bad air quality....+ more and more blocks are cutting down trees and not replacing them, i had 4 big trees on my block and now we are down to 1 - so i am sure this plays a role + as soon as you leave the city, you take a deep breath and you can feel the diference and how much better it feels to breath out there than over here in the city.

				I think one of the main air quality issues in Astoria/LIC is the abundance of the power plants in our area.&nbsp; According to a NY Daily News article, &quot;Queens has more toxic chemicals pumped into its air than the other four boroughs combined.&quot;<br />http://stopthepowerplant.org/documents/environment/queens_air.htm (http://stopthepowerplant.org/documents/environment/queens_air.htm)<br />In fact, the area of Astoria near the power plants is known as &quot;Asthma Alley&quot;:<br />http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/25/con-ed-backs-out-of-astoria-land-sale/?pagemode=print (http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/25/con-ed-backs-out-of-astoria-land-sale/?pagemode=print)<br />Although I am having trouble finding the statistic, I believe that Astoria produces an extremely disproportionate amount of the City&#039;s power.

To the best of my knowledge, those plants are all natural gas-fired, which is much cleaner than even well-scrubbed coal. (Excepting carbon dioxide of course, which doesn&#039;t have immediate health effects.) I&#039;d be much more inclined to believe that the heavy truck traffic on the GWB, cross-Bronx, Triborough, and Astoria Blvd, are the causes of high particulate air pollution. Particulates are what cause asthma and such. (Ozone&#039;s bad for health too, but NYC doesn&#039;t get much of it, unlike say LA.)<br /><br />Still, I&#039;d arguably rather live here with our heavy truck traffic than in, say, Greenpoint, where ungodly toxins ooze out of the ground... At least the truck pollution will be easing a bit in the next few years as new Federal diesel requirements and local garbage-hauling methods (barges) kick in...!

				The further away you are from the power plants and the bridge/highways, the better your air probably is.

				I absolutely have had more allergies and breathing issues in the past few years (I moved to Astoria 4 years ago).&nbsp; I&#039;m not feeling so hot today.&nbsp; I suspect the air around here is pretty bad to begin with but allergy season is not helping.&nbsp; And once you get those hot summer days when the ozone levels are high, it&#039;s even worse.&nbsp; <br /><br />For some reason, Claritin doesn&#039;t really do much for me.&nbsp; Zyrtec helps a lot, especially with my itchy throat, but it&#039;ll zonk you out all day.

				I believe Claritan does not work for allergies unless you start taking it before symptoms start.&nbsp; Once histamines are realeased, it just drys you up, but itchy eyes and nose don&#039;t get cured.&nbsp; <br /><br />Air quality in New York is awful, the whole city.&nbsp; Auto emissions are big problem, I wish we had electric cars already.&nbsp; &nbsp;I had cousins from rural part of Florida visiting, several could not take air here.&nbsp; They had allergy symptoms, but don&#039;t have allergies.

				An air purifier helps for sleeping. At least you can &quot;breathe easier&quot; at night. We have one with a HEPA filter that has to be changed once a year.
