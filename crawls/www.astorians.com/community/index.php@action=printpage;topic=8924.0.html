				I&#039;m with paratactical. Whenever I see them with the tables checking bags, I brace myself to say &#039;no&#039; and prepare to use another entrance. (I apply the same thing to searching my car on the highway.) The only thing that scares me is that guy in England that got shot running away. It&#039;s not like I&#039;d run away, but if they thought I &quot;appeared dangerous&quot; and shot me for some oddball reason (I wouldn&#039;t put that past &#039;em), would anybody care? Probably not. That&#039;s pretty scary.

				I&#039;ll agree also.&nbsp; It&#039;s silly.&nbsp; As far as getting shot, what happened in England was that the guy was being tracked all the way from his apartment, so it wasn&#039;t exactly the same situation (totally unjustified any way you slice it, however).&nbsp; <br /><br />It is absurd, however, to expect that these random checks will really stop any potential terrorist, when all one will simply have to do is go to a different entrance or a different station where there are no random checks being conducted, and enter from there.&nbsp; The same is true with the random checks of cars and trucks entering bridges and tunnels.&nbsp; I still see it fairly often on the entrance to the Triborough Bridge on Hoyt Ave., causing even more traffic chaos than usual in the mornings.&nbsp; It&#039;s so silly, because anyone could just get on the Grand Central Parkway a couple of miles down and continue on to the bridge without a problem.<br /><br />Even if we can say that &quot;we don&#039;t know what the NYPD knows,&quot; it&#039;s not hard to figure out that anyone that wants to commit a crime of any kind won&#039;t sit around and subject themselves to a search when they could easily avoid it and cause the damage they want by getting on somewhere where they won&#039;t be subjected to a search.

				I&#039;ve walked past several subway bag checks with large knapsacks, shoulder bags, etc, and never been stopped. (Maybe I just don&#039;t fit a profile?) On the other hand, security checks everyone when I go to a concert, and they take all of five seconds to poke inside the main compartment of my bag. If I wanted to keep something hidden, it would be no problem whatsoever. <br /><br />Bag checks, car stops, whatever else: it is all more for appearance&#039;s sake than anything else. Keep the public calm and prevent panic. Also, avoid spending money that is not readily available on large infrastructure changes.

				I don&#039;t understand why people are saying no to these people. Is it not the law that they&#039;re allowed to check your bags? and is it any better to lie about working for the MTA? (assuming Frappe doesn&#039;t work for the MTA since he owns a dog biscuit business; sorry if I&#039;m mistaken.) I&#039;m pretty sure the bag checks aren&#039;t simply for the idea of catching a terrorist in action, but of preventing a terrorist from attempting to go forth with it just because he might get caught going in. Whether this will work or not, who knows, but if they want to check my bag it doesn&#039;t bother me unless I&#039;m running late for something.

				BTW, the lawyers on this board, or people who have a better grasp on the Fourth Amendment, can probably cite the law better than I can.&nbsp; <br /><br />My experience involved investigating allegations of police misconduct, which included Search and Seizure violations.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you ever want to have a better understanding about your Fourth Amendment rights, at least how it relates to New York, check out this book: Gould&#039;s New York Search and Seizure for Law Enforcement Officers, 4th Edition<br /><br />http://bookstore.lexis.com/bookstore/product/50412.html<br /><br />

				I&#039;m not a huge advocate for police, however, let&#039;s not kill the messengers either. It is a systemic issue. <br />cops don&#039;t decide to check bags of their own volition.<br /><br />I have been pulled over for stops with my car when running late. I drive a pathfinder (possible why they pulled me over) and detained me for work by about 15 minutes as they did the check on the cars. Why? Why? it was a check point...however, how easy is it to avoid a check point? pretty effing easy, so like other posters, I wonder what the point is when you detain those that didn&#039;t try to avoid the point.

				I&#039;m not sure which way I go on this bag check issue.&nbsp; As most of you who are regulars here know, I am somewhat conservative, and I strongly support law enforcement.&nbsp; However, as a conservative, I am an ardent defender of individual liberties.&nbsp; And I am not a big fan of government intrusion into our lives.<br /><br />What people miss is that the cops are not literally trying to catch someone in the act of holding explosives.&nbsp; They&#039;re creating a disruption and monitoring the behavioral cues of people in the area of the check point.&nbsp; Also, they make every effort to be as noninvasive as possible.&nbsp; I have been checked I believe twice since the program started.&nbsp; The most recent time, the cop ran a swab over the outside of my bag and ran it through a machine to check for the presence of explosives.<br /><br />While searching through a bag might be a violation of my civil liberties, swabbing my bag for explosives is not.&nbsp; There is no defensible reason why I would have been handling explosives without a good explanation.&nbsp; Being swabbed slowed me down, which was an inconvenience, but convenience is not a civil liberty.&nbsp; Also, as has been said above, there is a real demonstrated security rationale for such a program.<br /><br />I am surprised that no one on this site has commented (to my knowledge) on Operation: Lucky Bag.&nbsp; (Which you can read about here: http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0751,gardiner,78677,2.html)&nbsp; Again, I am a big NYPD fan, but even I see this program as a civil liberties problem.&nbsp; This is a much more clear cut violation of civil liberties than the bag search program.&nbsp; Though I am still undecided on that one.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying this to be sarcastic, but I wish that those of you who defended personal liberty were also interested in the second amendment.&nbsp; That one tends to get lost here, and we are the poorer for it.

				You make some very good points, but if I were that hypothetical person with the explosives in the backpack, I would simply just not get on at that station.&nbsp; Some subway stations have multiple entrances, so I&#039;d go to one where there is no checkpoint, or I&#039;d walk to another station.&nbsp; The point is that it&#039;s silly, and I&#039;d like to know how many people they&#039;ve actually caught with explosives as a result of searches like those.&nbsp; These searches are also taking away manpower and resources that the police and law enforcement can use to more effectively fight crime in a different manner.

				Easy: because *every* passenger boarding the plane is being checked, for starters, and also because there&#039;s *no other way* to board the plane.&nbsp; Same with a concert or sporting event.&nbsp; Everyone entering the facility is being checked, and all the ways to enter that facility are secured in that same way.&nbsp; There&#039;s no picking and choosing.&nbsp; It&#039;s wildly different from random checkpoints in the subway, where someone who is hell bent on causing harm can easily avoid the checkpoints and walk to another entrance or another station with no security checkpoint.<br /><br />Ethically I don&#039;t think it&#039;s bogus, and I never said it was ethically bogus.&nbsp; My position has been, and is, that it is not an effective deterrent because it is so easy to bypass, and that as a result, the amount of law enforcement resources that are dedicated to it by the police is probably better used in other ways.&nbsp; Instead of sitting around and sorting through people&#039;s backpacks, those officers could be on active patrol instead, and actually serve as additional eyes and ears against crime of any kind.&nbsp; I think that would be far more effective, and if you want to bring intrusion into people&#039;s lives into this, yes, that would be less intrusive as well.<br /><br />See, this is not a black and white issue.&nbsp; Being against random checks doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;re against law enforcement.&nbsp; In my case, I feel it&#039;s ineffective law enforcement and a very ineffective use of resources, that just merely serves as &quot;reassurance&quot; to the public that something is being done to protect them, even if the benefits that arise from it are few, if any, and even if they are not really any more secure as a result of those measures.

				The thing that annoys me about the bag checks the most is that they do not actually make us any safer.&nbsp; They are one of those things the government does to give people the illusion of safety.&nbsp; Anyone could attack the subways at any time, the bad checks do nothing.&nbsp; <br /><br />The bag checks are a violation of civil liberties, plain and simple, but as one poster put it, we are all going to have to get used to it, as the government has already taken so much away in the interest of &quot;public safety.&quot;<br /><br />I was searched once on 125th street after taking the M60.&nbsp; The funniest thing about this is that there was a fight beetween 3 bums above ground, two officers to break it up, but they needed 3 officers to look through a guy in a suit&#039;s briefcase.<br /><br />Question for those who might no more about it?&nbsp; Can you refuse the search, what happens then?&nbsp; I let them search my empty bag as i was running late. I feel bad about it as i feel like i should have taken a stand.

Depending on how vocal and/or physical you are about it, you can possibly be arrested for disorderly conduct.&nbsp; If you didn&#039;t do anything too outrageous and was just a little boisterous, you can probably fight that charge and maybe win, as the charge has been challenged in NYC courts with mixed results.<br /><br />2. I believe they can charge you with &quot;refusal to comply to a lawful order.&quot;&nbsp; Again, you can take it to the courts and fight it.&nbsp; Heck, you might even set a precedent with your challenge.&nbsp; However, as I pointed out previously, this issue has gone to two courts and has been upheld as constitutional.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are a whole slew of obscure laws and regulations that they can hit you with, if they really wanted to.&nbsp; I would suspect, though, that most of them would be tossed out.

				I&#039;ve refused twice citing Article 2 of the NY state constitution as protecting citizens from unreasonable searches. Since there is no reasonable reason to search me I refuse. <br />The simply don&#039;t let you enter at that entrance. Depending on the station, you just walk to another entrance (since not all of them are manned at the same time) and enter there. <br />It&#039;s just 5 minutes of your life you lose. <br />Until every single person entering every entrance of every train station is searched (which I hope never happens) I will continue to refuse to be searched.
