				Well since the first dinner, not the name!<br />Last August (before my time&nbsp; :cry: ) Foodies came together to enjoy each others company and for the love of food, we have kept it up this whole year and i think thats super&nbsp; :-D <br /><br /><em>Here&#39;s the last year in dining:</em><br /><br /><strong>Jour et Nuit</strong>- August 26, 2005<br /><strong>Malagueta</strong>- September 9, 2005<br /><strong>Churrascaria Tropical</strong> - October 18, 2005<br /><strong>Sabor Tropical</strong> - November 11, 2005<br /><strong>El Basurero</strong> - December 16, 2006<br /><strong>Tacos Mexico</strong> - January 20, 2006<br /><strong>Balkh Shish Kabob</strong> - February 24, 2006<br /><strong>Beer Garden</strong> - March 24, 2006<br /><strong>Zenon Taverna</strong> - April 22, 2006<br /><strong>Bulgara</strong> - May 19, 2006<br /><strong>Agnanti </strong>- June 10, 2006<br />and sadly July fell off because&nbsp; well its the middle of summer and ConEd sucks?<br /><br />So i think we need to go all out for August...granted we can find a date where the majority can make it. I&#39;d like to toss in that a weeknight might help in getting more people in it, i have more weeknights available then weekends and i assume the same for you guys too. Any places for a big group? Any good dates open? <br /><div><br />YAY FOR FOOD!</div><br />

				I cannot believe it&#39;s a year!&nbsp; Well, it&#39;s been a great one - and we cannot let a little thing like a blackout from stopping us now.<br /><br />I don&#39;t have any suggestions for the moment, but I think the idea of a weeknight is a good one.<br /><br />Oh!&nbsp; I do have one possibility.&nbsp; Jim and I went with my parents to Mombar last week (we were headed for Kebab Cafe, but Ali lost his refrigeration in the blackout so was closed - but turned up of course helping out his brother Mostafa at Mombar).&nbsp; I mentioned to Mostafa that I was part of a local eating group, and he said that with a few days&#39; notice he could provide a great assortment of food at a prix fixe.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t get into details as to how much, but that might be one possibility.<br /><br />It&#39;s been a long time since I had been to Mombar, and everything was just wonderful.

				Mombar sounds like a great choice!&nbsp; The last half of August is better for me, except the 26th, but we are talking a weeknight anyway.<br /><br />I remember fondly the first astorians eating event.&nbsp; Was much fun!<br /><br />I hope the evening might also include a stop at Laziza.&nbsp; Mmmmm.......

				If not for Astoria EATS, I would know almost no one in Astoria.&nbsp; Happy anniversary.<br /><br />I&#39;ll be out of town Aug. 19-28 (except possibly the 23rd), but if I&#39;m in town, I&#39;ll be there...wherever it turns out to be.

				Well, he does have one window a/c.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; If you sit right under it, there is a marginally cool thin stream of air washing over you.<br /><br />It was a pretty hot evening, and it was tolerable inside.&nbsp; There was also a big group in the restaurant while we were there, so they were cooking up a storm.

				Re Kabab Cafe, I was walking by on Saturday and saw that he was closed and his kitchen was completely gutted and torn up. Anyone know what&#39;s up? Is he getting a new kitchen?<br /><br />I also still want to attempt Spicy and Tasty sometime -- maybe for a random evening or weekend event, vs an official EATS function.

				so lanseaux and i stopped by Mombar yesterday on our way to the PSC meeting to speak with Moustafa. we asked him for a prix fixe for 15-20 people and he gave us $30 for a 5 course meal. he does have beverages but we can bring our own wine (me likey) we would be set up in a few smaller tables (also not a big deal cause the place is cozy) and have dips and pita like hummus babaganoush and foule and the likes all around. then he mentioned a lamb plate a chicken plate and i think a fish? also to give him notice of veggies coming cause he&#39;d whip up something for that too. he let us know that if it looks too $$$ that he could take it down a notch to a 3 course deal for like $25 or something like that.<br />i know people weren&#39;t too into the prix fixe for zenon last time but i&#39;d really like to urge everyone to go for it here. i&#39;d love to give these guys a ton of business and show them how much we appreciate them here in our neighborhood. i think $30 is a great price for this delish food anyway-everytime im over at Ali&#39;s its a $20-30 meal just for my one meal, so for us to be able to experiment with a few different dishes sounds great.<br />So peoples, let me know what you think. lets go lets go!!!!!!<br /><br /><em>welcome Rachel780 and all you other future foodies!</em>

				Hi Everyone - it&#39;s Stacy. <br />I finally got past the &#39;big&#39; road block of coming up with a sign-in name -- settling on the name assigned to me in my 8th grade Spanish Class. It was so nice to meet everyone last night and the dinner was delicious -- I am still full! <br />Great job at recalling the menu too!<br />Look forward to seeing you all again!

				Love the idea of Ali&#39;s for September!<br /><br />Yes the meal was yummy.&nbsp; I think I liked the quesadilla type items (courses 2 and 3) best.&nbsp; the quail was interesting.&nbsp; Loved the couscous and rice.&nbsp; Really liked everything.&nbsp; So glad to be able to support a great local restaurant.
