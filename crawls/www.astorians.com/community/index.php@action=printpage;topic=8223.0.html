				Due to expressed interest it seems appropriate to have an official poll to address the question of whether or not the site could benefit from a &quot;singles&quot; section (sub category). Previous opinions have been stated here and here (http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=4875.0) and here (http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=8199.0) among other places.<br /><br />This thread is in response to a call for a vote. Please note that a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer doesn&#039;t mean that we&#039;ll add a singles board (sub category). Just want to see what everyone thinks.

				I agree.&nbsp; I&#039;m married, so it makes no difference to me if there is a singles site.&nbsp; I do like the idea that there would be a separate subcategory for it.&nbsp; This way if someone isn&#039;t interested, they don&#039;t have to see it.<br /><br />While it&#039;s being thought about, maybe there can be another forum for more personal issues in general.&nbsp; Not necessarily a neighborhood thing, nor a category where everything else goes to get lost in the shuffle (ie: &quot;random gabble&quot;)<br /><br />For example, this is where that recent thread about the woman who needed to get rid of her dogs can go.&nbsp; That wasn&#039;t really a neighborhood issue, but it was certainly interesting enough to get some solid response (good and bad).&nbsp; I can fully understand the need for that woman looking for an avenue to get some third-party advice, and whether she liked it or not, she got it.&nbsp; I think that&#039;s great (I&#039;d post something like that too if I needed the same).&nbsp; I&#039;m just not sure it belonged in that category of topics.

				I&#039;m quite happily attached (to someone I met through an astorians.com meetup event, not through any sort of &quot;singles board&quot;), but just a thought... Postings here on astorians.com are archived literally forever, right? If not by the board itself, then by search engines. (Try a google search with &quot;site:astorians.com merm&quot;, for example!)

				It&#039;s quite obvious by the vote, that people feel this sub board would be asset. It also seems that those who voted for it are looking askance at this thread by the disproportionate votes to posters. I think we should just do it. It is going to take on a life of its own anyway!

Many Astorians.com users share enough info about themselves to be identified. <br /><br />Personals, on the other hand, are deliberately anonymous. Dating sites are password-protected/members only, and you can change or remove your profile. Craigslist posts expire after a week or so, and use protective anon accounts. With newspaper ads I think you&#039;re supposed to respond to a mailbox or voicemail or something. <br /><br />I&#039;ve never seen an ad that says &quot;Hi, I&#039;m Jane Smith and I&#039;m looking for Mr. Right.&quot; Because then it&#039;s in black and white forever.

				Under absolutely no circumstances should anyone be posting personal details on the internet for the public anywhere at any time - no matter if it&#039;s a singles site, myspace, or this site. That being said, many people still choose to post all kinds of personal information out there for the public to see and search engines to spider (and archive.org to permanently archive). It&#039;s totally their choice, and the same would be true for the singles board.<br /><br />That being said, I personally feel that the dynamic of the board, and it&#039;s community-centered-dialog may actually make for a unique singles experience. If you&#039;re just looking to post for &quot;hot sex&quot; for example I have a feeling astorians might not be the place for you - but there&#039;s lots of sites out there that serve that demo well.

				I wonder if the new board could be something not immediately accessible. Not highly restricted, but not something anyone could surf in and see/post in - you&#039;d have to join astorians first and then request access. I don&#039;t know about the rest of you but when it comes to astorians and dating sites, I have different &quot;security levels&quot;. I want people who might be dating me to have access to information that I don&#039;t want the general public (via astorians) to have access too. etc etc<br /><br />are we talking about posting profiles and contacting other singles via pm, or just talking about being single and setting up mixers etc? <br /><br />

				I&#039;m not familiar with the BB software used here but I know with vbulletin you can make it so that some forums can&#039;t even be seen by guests or certain user groups. (which I assume would include search engine spiders). This would help protect people&#039;s privacy a lot if it is decided to allow people to posts ads of sorts. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know if it is possible, but maybe having it so that only the OP can respond would be good as well, letting any interested parties communicate through e-mail or PM.

I think merm&#039;s intent was to guage interest and open dialogue, and so far it looks like we&#039;ve got lots of good dialogue :)

				I don&#039;t see it ever becoming an ad board. Y&#039;all know what I mean? <br /><br /><em>SWF seeking very wealthy, married, well-hung man for expensive afternoon delights!</em><br /><br />I truly believe it will take on a life of its own once it gets off to a good start. We have a lot of singles in the area who seem to have an interest in meeting other singles in the area. This sub-board might just prove to be a benefit to both the forum, in terms of memberships, and to those specifically interested in singles activities.

				For the question enigmacat raised about what the singles board will end up being, it would be great to hear from people who voted &quot;yes&quot; about what they want from the board.&nbsp; That way, I think it would be easier to gauge issues of internet privacy, etc.<br /><br />

				I for one am not necessarily thinking that it would have to be like the &quot;casual encounters&quot; section of craigslist. But there are quite a few topics that center around being single; conversations about dating in Astoria, advice in general, and people wanting to talk about or plan singles related activities. It doesn&#039;t have to be a &quot;dating service&quot;, just that there could be a specific area of the board that focuses on being single in Astoria. For people looking for an anonymous and private way to find an adult friend there&#039;s adultfriendfinder.com. This is a community site, and singles are themselves a large &quot;group&quot; in the community as sports fans, foodies, parents etc are.<br /><br />The dialog is great, it&#039;s good to hear everyone expressing their ideas about this.

				bring on a singles board - just like the &quot;out&quot; and &quot;parenting/families&quot; board... I think the more you can cater to specific segments of your audience the more user friendly this board becomes.&nbsp; When Astorians was small all the child boards weren&#039;t necessary - but as membership grows I think diversifying is helpful. <br /><br />That said - I know of three couples who met on Astorians without the help of a singles board - one of those couples just tied the knot.&nbsp; CONGRATULATIONS!!! <br /><br />

				I&#039;m new to the board and just finding my way around, so sorry to be bringing back an old thread. Just wondering if anything ever became of this? <br /><br />Almost all the dates I&#039;ve had since moving this city have, for some weird reason, been with guys who lived in Brooklyn. (I have no idea why this is, I don&#039;t exactly consider myself a hipster :roll:) It would be great if there was some kind of sub-board or way to meet new people who don&#039;t end up being such a long train ride away!<br /><br />thanks!
