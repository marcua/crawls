				If you haven&#039;t seen it yet, check out Google Maps new feature:&nbsp; StreetView.<br /><br />Click on StreetView next to where you would normally choose among Map, Satellite, or Hybrid.<br />Then click in the middle of the blue-lined streets.<br /><br />I think it is pretty cool!<br /><br />I have also noticed that Google Maps now has exit numbers along the highways.&nbsp; That is fairly new, too.

				And again we&#039;re getting into the &quot;privacy while you&#039;re in a public space&quot; thing - there&#039;s no such thing! See the thread about cameras in the subway stations (http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=5927.0), and the one about taking pictures of Christmas decorations (http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=4257.msg44908#msg44908), every argument against paparazzi (I have some issues with them, but only very specific issues), various photojournalist cases, etc etc etc.<br /><br />As a photographer, I&#039;m siding with Google on this. If you&#039;re in (or even within view, as that lady&#039;s cat was) a public space, its fair game if it&#039;s not for advertising or commercial gain. If you don&#039;t want the inside of your house to be visible/photographed, do something so that it can&#039;t be.<br /><br />Basically, if it can be seen from the street (where these pictures are being taken from), which is a public place that anyone in the country has access to, then what the heck is everyone freaking out about?<br /><br />And as an aside, if I know when my block was being photographed for this (it hasn&#039;t been yet, but I live on a busy/main Street in Astoria, so it will probably be shot soon, if it hasn&#039;t already), I&#039;m totally hanging a sign out my window. Maybe have people over and be doing something bizarre in my room (which faces the street). Maybe I&#039;ll do something now anyway! ha! What should my sign say? Alison Rules? Astorians.com is the shiznit? I need suggestions, people!

				I agree, don&#039;t see what the big deal is. Although if I were photographed sunbathing I wouldn&#039;t be too thrilled if millions of internet users were looking and talking about it....(as if!!&nbsp; :roll: )<br /><br />.....though the Astoria sunbathers up top don&#039;t seem to mind.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D

				i was looking at this feature and notice that if you zoom in close on a picture is gets blurry.&nbsp; Even from afar it is hard to make out faces.&nbsp; So why are people worried about this??&nbsp; And&nbsp; Doubt that the woman would have seen the cat through the window.

				Yeah, they had the story about the woman and her cat on NY1 earlier today and you saw everything.&nbsp; Her house, her window, her cat sitting in the window...it was as clear as crystal.<br /><br />My Aunt, who was down from Albany and watched the story with me was curious about her house.&nbsp; I put in her address and it didn&#039;t give me the option for street view at all.

				Seems like legislatures are concerned that some of the images of airports and high security areas are too clear, making it easier for terrorists to scope out locations from their laptops.&nbsp; I read they want google to blur them.

				Terrorists would do better to visit a site in person. Everything these days is, &quot;What if the terrorists....&quot;&nbsp; :roll: <br /><br />I find this feature pretty cool and harmless. Although I&#039;m sure among the millions of people using it, somebody will discover something like their girlfriend&#039;s car in front of their brother&#039;s apartment or some such nonsense.

				Yeah I think its a bit of an overreaction on behalf of legislators looking for something new to be tough on, although I guess the evil doers could use it as an intial scope out before arriving in person.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see google maps increasing terrorism though.&nbsp;
