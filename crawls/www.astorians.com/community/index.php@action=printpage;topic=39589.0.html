				<br />I only learned yesterday that apparently 60 Beans has stopped their dinner service, as of a few weeks ago.&nbsp; I am so sad, as I loved their dinner offerings and the charming ambiance there.&nbsp; Granted there are other good places nearby to eat, but 60 Beans was my hands-down favorite place for dinner, and I&#039;d often take myself to dinner there after a long day at the office.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m guessing/have to wonder if the chef has decided to maybe branch off and open his own place??

				The last weekend of service was November 5th.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; The waiter thought they might try to launch a brunch in the spring.&nbsp; If this pans out, it will give The Ditty a serious run for their money as their brunch is TERRIFIC!&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />That said, we are really bummed that 60 Beans did this as it was the best kept secret on Ditmars.

				<br />Yup, I too considered it one of the best-kept secrets...under the radar of most... I was always a bit surprised that I didn&#039;t see more diners there on a regular basis, considering how good the food was.<br /><br />I think I heard the end of dinner service was &#039;sudden&#039;.&nbsp; I have to wonder (pure conjecture) if the chef decided he wants to do his own thing...maybe open his own place?&nbsp; Or maybe they weren&#039;t getting enough dinner traffic/revenue to warrant staying open late each night and paying all the dinner staff?&nbsp; Maybe they think brunch (which is always popular) is a better way to automatically get more diners, and then maybe from there they will try and hope that some of the brunch crowd then patronizes them for dinner as well?<br /><br />
