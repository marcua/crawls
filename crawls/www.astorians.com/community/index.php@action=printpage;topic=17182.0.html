				I have moved several times in the 9 years I&#039;ve lived in NY and have never had such an aggressively rude experience with a mover as I had with Kevin.<br />For starters, I was moving a 2-bedroom apartment 2 blocks away. I had a lot of stuff and Kevin said that, due to the size of his van, we would need to make at least 2 trips. Fine. I still had bedding to throw in a bag and pots and pans to toss in a box so figured as the guys were taking care of all my furniture and the 25 boxes that had already been packed, I could do these couple things. <br />Kevin let me know he should be at my apt around 12:30 and that he always calls 30 min in advance of his arrival. When 12:30 came and went, I called him to find out his earlier move had gone long and he was waiting on his helper to assemble all of the furniture (why he couldn&#039;t help I don&#039;t know) and would it be possible to postpone my move to the following day because he had a birthday party in Long Island to get to early that evening. I said no, this was the day I needed to do it because I had arranged for my baby boy to be out of the house and everything was packed and....well, this was the day and time I had reserved several days prior.<br />Kevin finally showed up around 2pm without having called 30 min in advance to let me know when he was coming. If I hadn&#039;t stuck out my hand to shake his, blocking his blazing trail into my apartment, I don&#039;t think he would&#039;ve even stopped to say hi. He just raced right into the apartment, picked up the first box he saw and started down the stairs with it proclaiming &quot;ok we&#039;ve got to do this fast&quot; and then advising me that once all the furniture and very large items were moved to my new place, he would be leaving to get to his party and his helper would finish moving me into my new place. &quot;And I&#039;ll pro-rate this accordingly&quot;, he said, to reflect for one man helping instead of two. I had a problem with this because I did not reserve one man, I reserved two. So clearly his timeline was important but his client&#039;s was not. He then walked into the bedroom to see my bedding that needed to be thrown into a garbage bag and shouted &quot;OH MY GOD!!&quot; When I asked what the problem was, he said &quot;It&#039;s an absolute disaster in here! This is ridiculous!&quot; Among the 10 boxes that were ready and packed, there was literally only a comforter and 3 pillows that needed to be packed. This was the &quot;disaster.&quot; <br />Long story short, while clearly in a rush (which could be considered a pro when moving for those who don&#039;t care about how their things are handled), he was very aggressive, made several negative comments about the move, planned on bailing out early to go make his party and...when I asked him to please calm down, that I didn&#039;t appreciate his demeanor or rude behavior and if he couldn&#039;t please be a bit more professional then he could leave...he did leave, exclaiming &quot;I don&#039;t need this stress!&quot; They had already brought several of my boxes down to the ground floor and just left them there. From my 4th floor apt I could hear him whining to his helper outside &quot;I wasn&#039;t negative! I didn&#039;t make any comments! I don&#039;t need this stress!&quot; <br />He was the most dramatic unprofessional mover I&#039;ve ever had the displeasure of attempting to do business with. Luckily I was able to find someone (Sven&#039;s Moving) to move me the following day and they did a great job. Were very friendly, courteous, professional. Another company I would also recommend in the Astoria area is Shea Moving. While I did not use him, he was prompt at returning my calls and was friendly, respectful and professional.

				What a horrific experience. Moving itself is stressful enough. Having to deal with this type of crapola is ridiculous. Did you pay Kevin for the work he did?

				thanks for these postings, am moving in a few weeks and will give sven&#039;s, shea&#039;s and mudanza&#039;s.&nbsp; it has been 4 years since i moved and i&#039;ve never hired professionals- is it usually priced by the job or by the time?

				They&#039;re usually priced by time. Sven charged $65/hour for 2 men and a large truck (that fit everything in my well-stocked 2-bedroom apartment) and that included everything, no hidden charges for walk-ups (mine was a 4th floor walk-up to a 2nd floor) or large furniture or anything. If I had to move again (which I don&#039;t plan on doing ever. My great-grandchildren are going to have to drag my dead body out of here), honestly I would probably go for Shea&#039;s just because I really liked his attitude on the phone and it seems they have some sort of nifty way of carrying several large boxes at once which looks to be pretty efficient and time-saving.<br />Best of luck on your move!

				I have to defend Kevin since I just moved a few weeks ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;Although I did also find him abrupt and he was sort of yelling at his helper throughout the move he did give me excellent advice beforehand and took his time with me on the phone to get all the details beforehand.&nbsp; &nbsp;He was also very late and didn&#039;t call beforehand to say he was going to be very late, which was really stressful for me.&nbsp; He was very careful with all the stuff though.&nbsp; I guess you just have to call to check on how he is doing with the time...

				I used Sven for my move last March.&nbsp; His crew was exactly on time, they charged me exactly what the quote was, did the work efficiently, and were pleasant to deal with.&nbsp; Needless to say, I was pleased and would recommend them to anyone who wants a budget mover.&nbsp; They are probably not the best choice if you&#039;ve got antiques or delicate furnishings or are high strung about scratches and things.&nbsp;

				My partner used Flat Rate when she moved from her 5th floor walkup in Brooklyn Heights into my apartment here in Astoria. They were quick, it was pretty painless, and they put whatever they had to take apart back together. It seemed pretty reasonably priced too.

				I just moved on Wednesday -- a long, stressful move of a 3br apartment we&#039;d been living in for 7 years. We used Shea&#039;s (http://www.sheamoving.com/) and they were a bright spot in a very hard process. They came by to look at the apt. in advance and give us an estimate, which is capped -- if it takes less time you pay less, if it takes more time you only pay the estimate. Our move took longer than expected so we ended up paying about $250 less than the hourly rate would have been.<br /><br />The movers were upbeat, friendly, courteous, and honestly seemed to love their jobs &amp; like each other. They wrapped every piece of furniture in cardboard/blankets, paid attention to what was fragile, disassembled &amp; reassembled the furniture, and even remembered where things went when I didn&#039;t. They were extremely gracious when some things that were out of their control slowed us down -- like a living room we couldn&#039;t enter because the paint was still drying (ack!).<br /><br />They&#039;re also just amazing to watch -- they loaded that truck like a puzzle and carried most things on their backs w/straps. And they lowered our sofa off the balcony as though it was a piece of cardboard.<br /><br />I can&#039;t even think of a negative thing to say about them. I don&#039;t know if they&#039;re the cheapest, though honestly this cost a lot less than I expected it to. But if you want a stress-free process, call them.<br /><br />One tip that we should have thought of far in advance: load up on lots of bottled water before the movers get there. We had to make several runs to the deli throughout the day!

				What litza said! We moved with Shea on Saturday, and they were awesome. Granted, we did most of the moving ourselves over the past two weeks (small stuff in liquor store boxes and fragile stuff), but they came in under the estimate and re-wrote the contract when they were done, to reflect the revised time and price. I wasn&#039;t the least bit worried about their skills or honesty. <br /><br />The owner and two guys were efficient and professional the entire time. Very cool and easy to work with, plus they know about bikes and cats.&nbsp; :mrgreen:
