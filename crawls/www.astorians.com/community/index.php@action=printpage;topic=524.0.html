				Title: <strong>ICE - In Case of Emergency</strong><br />

				Greetings,<br /><br />Someone recently sent me an email and let me know about something that I personally think is a good idea for anyone who carries a cell phone.<br /><br />I looked this up on the internet and found an interesting story (http://www.eastanglianambulance.com/content/news/newsdetail.asp?newsID=646104183) talking about how in an emergency (let's say you are in an accident, or get hurt in some way) it's helpful for emergency personel, or other people that are trying to help you in an emergency to be able to quickly get ahold of someone in your family, or notify your next of kin to advise them of your condition or ask about your medical history, or let them know what hospital you might be in. They do this by looking at an ICE contact on your cell phone.<br /><br />Basically you just create a contact in your cell phone called ICE (or ICE - Parents, or ICE - Wife). That way if you were ever in some situation where someone needed to get ahold of an emergency contact for you it would already be in your phone. They would know that this is the person who can make medical decisions for you, or who will notify other family members or friends what hospital you are in or whatever.<br /><br />The reason I thought this was a good idea is because just last week an aquaintance of mine died in a car accident. The trouble was that the ambulance and police personnel couldn't find any contact information for the girl's family to notify her next of kin that she had died. The media was aware of her death before her own parents or siblings were.<br /><br />Anyway - I just wanted to share this idea in case someone else thought it would be worth doing. I did it in my phone.
