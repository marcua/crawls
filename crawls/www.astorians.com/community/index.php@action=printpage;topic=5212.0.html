				I am thinking of taking a vacation to South America in the spring/early summer. Since I am traveling alone, I am strongly considering a tour vacation. I have traveled alone in the United States, but I am more comfortable as a female in a group setting when traveling abroad. The problem is I want to avoid spring breakers, recent graduates, singles pick-up tours, and senior citizens tours. (I am in my late 20s) Does anyone have any suggestions? I am trying to avoid tours like Contiki which I have heard to be more party tours than sightseeing tours.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am not limited to South America, so all suggestions are welcome.

				If you want an active tour (hiking, biking, walking), Backroads (http://www.backroads.com/ (http://www.backroads.com/)) has a great reputation, and I think they&#39;ve got a pretty good mix of people on most of their tours.

				Thanks for everyone&#39;s input so far. I am not sure if I really want to do a backpacking tour, although I am open to an active tour. Someone at work suggested a kayaking trip which would be fun, but I am sure I would be sore after 5 straight days of kayaking. I am also totally open to a fully pampered, luxury tour... budget permitting.&nbsp; :-P<br /><br />Aquaecny, I am trying to avoid Contiki. I have heard it is like a crazy spring break for college grads. It would have been exactly what I was looking for about 5 years ago, but not now. Thanks though!

				If you still have less luck with the tours and consider vacationing by your lonesome, Aruba is an excellent place to go.&nbsp; Despite the negative publicity, it is an extremely safe island, its beautiful and reasonably priced.&nbsp; Has all the activities, can go four wheeling up and down the terrain, clubs, casinos, beaches and the cutest old portuguese town.&nbsp;

				If you decide to go the backpacking route, these are <span class="bbc_u">friends</span> (http://www.adventureplus.org/) of mine. They take tour groups all over the world and are always off on another great adventure. Personally, if there isn&#39;t great room service, a 5&quot; feather quilt, 3+ swimming pools, two 4+ star restaurants, latex foam pillows, a 24-hour concierge and a partridge in a pear tree . . . I&#39;m not going!

				there are often scuba diving trips to some great places.&nbsp; i highly recommend Bonaire.&nbsp; Even if you went there yourself it is very easy to join a diving group and do excursions with them.&nbsp; divers are usually friendly people too.&nbsp; go to bonaire, get certified and swim with the fishes, turtles and whales...it is a blast
