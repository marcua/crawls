It was a franchise system set up by Joseph Lancaster. There were ultimately 98 Lancaster Schools in New York City alone before they were taken over by the state and regulated by the Board of Education.<br /><br />More information on The Lancaster System can be found at http://www.spinninglobe.net/lancsys.htm<br /><br />John Chodes is a free-lance writer who specializes in the subject of education. His articles have appeared in the New York Times, Reason Magazine, The Freeman, Chronicles, and many other publications as well as TV and radio editorial replies.<br /><br />Doors open at 7:00 p.m. for conversation, announcements and food service. <br />Speaker begins at 7:30 p.m.<br /><br />Ukrainian East Village Restaurant<br />140 Second Avenue<br />( between 9th Street and St. Mark’s )<br /><br />This event is free and all are welcome<br /><br /><br />http://manhattanlp.org/<br />

Since the loss of the election in November conservatives and libertarians from across the nation have started to think about the road back not only to power, but how to return the country to believing in free-market principles. Have libertarians and conservatives found their voice? With a plummeting economy, do free market ideas stand a chance? Have Republicans discovered a comeback strategy based on ideas and principles that libertarians and conservatives can support? What is the road back to capitalism?<br /><br />Joining us for this discussion is Megan McArdle of The Atlantic, <br />Brian Carney of the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board, <br />and Ron Moore of the Manhattan Libertarians.&nbsp; <br /><br />Moderating this discussion will be David Kirby, Executive Director of America’s Future Foundation.&quot;<br /><br />This will be held at Open House Gallery (201 Mulberry Street) in New York City.&nbsp; <br />roundtable discussion will begin at 7:00 pm.&nbsp; <br />To RSVP to this event please email Kathleen <br /><br />** Have libertarians been in power? **
