				Just want to warn you all that the new place on 30th, Baru, is awful, and insanely overpriced. Has anyone else tried it out yet?

				ok, so we went. &nbsp;we went for a walk and ended up sitting outside for drinks.<br /><br />Our waitress was the standard attractive useless type with loads of (wink wink) experience. &nbsp;When my wife asked for a cider, the waitress wanted to know if that was the appetizer cider? &nbsp;and then when my wife said it was a drink, she asked which one we wanted, (they only have one kind).<br /><br />I asked for a makers mark and she wanted to know what that was. &nbsp;I said a bourbon. &nbsp;she left with our order and came back to ask me what kind of bourbon i wanted. &nbsp;<br /><br />I will say that it was a good pour for a decent price. &nbsp;looked over the menu and saw the crazy prices. the average dinner was 20, apps 12 and salads 12. &nbsp; thats just nuts!

I have to check it out, some of us have been saying Astoria could use a veggie /veg friendly place.<br />&nbsp;i looked for your review of Baru, but couldn't find it. Did you delete?<br />&nbsp;i live on 30th but don't recall seeing this place. Is it east of 31st street?

				Is the food good?<br /><br />For me it is not about being pricy. I have a favorite restaurant of mine in Manhattan called Roy's NY where appetizers run about 12 and dinner is 20 to 30 per plate. However, the service is phenominal and so is the food. Especially the chocolate suffle they serve for dessert. My mouth is watering just thinking about cutting into the chocolate delight and getting to the melted chocolate in the middle. We get treated like stars when we go there. We go to this place on special occations, birthdays, anniversarys, and when we are celebrating something. We even have our own special server. Over the years she has come to be our friend and she knows what we like. If the food is worth it then the price is too. <br /><br />Has anyone actually ate at Baru and tried the food?<br /><br />Colleen

				I'm saying, the food and service both suck. So do the prices.

				I don't think Baru is doing so well.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I popped in there two weekends ago on a whim, since we only heard about the place. It was deserted. According to the over-eager bartender the menu had been expanded. I don't recall being blown over by the prices, though. I was looking more at the entree items which seemed a little too sophisticated for our palates at that time (we were on the hunt for some good comfort food, and eventually wound up at Keystone.)<br /><br />I think the last place the neighborhood needs is an overpriced Eurostyle cafe. &nbsp;I miss the old Rainbow.

				My husband and I ended up there on a night that I'd worked until 10 PM and seriously needed some pampering, wine, and mood lighting. They've got the mood lighting down, the wine was alright if overpriced, and the pampering, well. Our waitress was like Elizabeth Shue on SPEED. <br /><br />My husband had the yellowtail tuna, he really liked it. Said it melted in his mouth. My sirloin was very well prepared and tender, and medium rare just like I like it. The mashed potatoes were a little stiff, not quite moist and buttery enough. The dessert was delicious - a warm chocolate cake.<br /><br />Look, we spent a hundred bucks on that meal, I won't lie. It was expensive but it was also pretty good. It's a typical greek mafia eatery and I expect the service and quality will only go DOWN over time and the music was a little too loud (although she turned it RIGHT down when I asked, granted, there were only three other tables). The service wasn't rushed, but probably not too knowledgable either.<br /><br />They're the same people that own Plaza Cafe, down the street across from Athens Park, so it's basically what my husband and I lovingly refer to as the Greek Mafia - they won't ever need to close their doors so they don't have any impetus to really hit top marks with their non &quot;community&quot; customers.<br /><br />But I will have to say, our meal was probably a 7/10.

				I've eaten a few times at Baru and I found their food to be very nice. Yes, they are pricey, but I think its nice to have a better quality restaurant with a different menu in the neighborhood. We usually have to go to Manhattan for that sort of thing. Their seafood was amazing and their desserts are succulent. This is a nice restaurant to go to on a special occasion. I'm suprised to see so many bad reviews.
