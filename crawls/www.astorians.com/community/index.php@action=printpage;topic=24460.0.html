				I was wondering if anyone knew of any boutique-type stores in Astoria. I&#039;m a recent transplant from nj and I am missing some of my mom and pop shops that I loved. I usually shop at places like h&amp;m, American eagle, and urban outfitters, but I also love to shop at local places and support local business. I haven&#039;t seen any stores really around but maybe I just haven&#039;t found them yet? And I&#039;m open to clothing stores as well as household goods too for suggestions.

				Check out Kristees on 23rd Ave for clothing. <br /><br />Inside Astoria is a boutique-y gift shop on Ditmars.

				For home goods and also some apparel and accessories, check out Site on 34th Avenue between 36th &amp; 37th Streets.<br />To be honest, I&#039;ve never gone in, but their window display is always bright and colorful and they&#039;ve got some really cute items.<br /><br /><br />Also, for vintage clothing check out Loveday 31 on 31st Avenue between 33rd &amp; 34th Streets. They just got their website going - <br />loveday31.com.<br /><br /><br />And you might want to look in Boro magazine, which usually given out by the train stations. Boro focuses on businesses in Astoria and <br />Long Island City. It&#039;s mainly about food/restaurants, but they do spotlight other local businesses. <br /><br /><br />Site and some other local businesses also participate in a shopping event at holiday time&nbsp; - they usually have it on a weeknight at <br />Brick Cafe. Several places participate and it&#039;s a good way to see what the locals have on offer. <br /><br /><br />Happy Shopping!<br /><br />
