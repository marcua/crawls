			Not sure if anyone is really checking out these boards anymore, but I just started getting a new CSA and thought I&#039;d share. You can check it out at https://theconnectedchef.com/groceries/<br /><br /><br />Here&#039;s the description from their website:<br /><br /><br />Since April 2020, The Connected Chef has been providing free grocery packages to Queens families out of work and disproportionately affected by COVID-19 through our Lifeline Grocery Program.<br />[/color]In an effort to strengthen our communityâ€™s food supply and ensure that all Queens residents have access to local, nutrient-dense groceries, we are excited to announce our new community-based grocery package.This grocery package is open to all Queens residents.It is the first grocery package with the mission to ensure we all have access to the same quality food, regardless of our income.The payment for your grocery box will be on a sliding scale based on what they feel capable of spending, to ensure equal and quality food for all Queens residents.[/font]
