				Hello<br />I am a beginner runner who lives about a mile from the park. I like to run there and then do a bit more once i arrive. I can run a mile and 3/4 now and i am looking to run a 5k eventually and then we&#039;ll see. I generally run after work around 6:15, but i could do a bit later. I am looking for running friends.<br /><br />

				how many times a week do you run?&nbsp; i&#039;m trying to get motivated to run as well.&nbsp; I have ran to and in astoria park in the past but need motivation to stick with it.&nbsp; maybe a running partner would help.&nbsp; I can do 7pm the earliest.&nbsp; maybe just a couple of nights a week to begin with.

				Hellgate Road Runners meets in the park 4x a week. I just moved here a few months ago and joined up with them. There are some pretty intense runners in the group (not me) but they are completely open and accepting of beginners. They have a website where you can find out where they train and how to contact the coach. I really like running with them because its motivating to know that there are a bunch of people out there, its much safer than going by myself or with my roommate (she and i run with the group together), and they don&#039;t care if you dont show up... they are just happy when you do! <br /><br />to get involved you can either just show up at a practice or email Jared, the coach. I just happened upon them during a walk in the park and thats how we started running with them. Good Luck!<br /><br />http://www.hrr-online.org/
