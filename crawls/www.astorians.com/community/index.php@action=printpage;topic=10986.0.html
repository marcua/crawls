				This place has been opened for a few months now and I&#039;m giving it a big thumbs up.&nbsp; <br /><br />As the name implies, the food is fresh and deelish!&nbsp; They say the food contains no artificial sugars, fats, carbs, chemicals, additives or preservatives.&nbsp; They use food that is &quot;all natural, organic, antibiotic free, heart healthy...&quot; etc.&nbsp; They have a great menu.&nbsp; They have really good food and smoothies and they deliver.<br /><br />http://www.freshnyjuicebar.com/

				I had an awesome breakfast there a few weeks back: a wrap with egg whites with mushrooms and spinich and amazing potatoes on the side.&nbsp; It was delicious and so was, much to my surprise, was the coffee.&nbsp;

				The front is so unassuming - I expected that the place was the size of a phone booth (remember phone booths?) and just did juices and such. From the web-site I see there is quite a bit more. Thanks for the heads-up!

				It&#039;s gonna have to be delivery when I try this - another place with the damned euro-techno-disco music and the treble turned up to 11. Do people actually like that stuff, or is it there to keep the staff from thinking, and to keep the customers from lingering at their tables?<br />

				I go here after workouts sometimes. I was disappointed to find that they use mystery fruit purée to make their smoothies UNLESS you ask for fresh fruit. I feel that the fiber and juicy goodness of a fruit can only be enjoyed with the entire, whole fruit being tossed in a blender, not using some purée (of which I don&#039;t know the ingredients, maybe there&#039;s added sugar, who knows.)<br />But overall the smoothies are great and made-to-order. I don&#039;t find the people at the Natural Food store to be very friendly so I prefer Fresh for my smoothies.

				I tried their burger and one of their wraps.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t hugely impressed with either but I wasn&#039;t terribly disappointed either.&nbsp; I found the vibe a little weird, sort of like they were mainly in business to serve their friends, but that may just be because they&#039;re new.<br /><br />Anything juice bar-y, frankly, I would go to Sai for even though it&#039;s a little farther away.&nbsp; Regarding the friendliness comment, for some reason it seems to be that the employees are friendlier at the 31st st. location than the 36th street location, <em>even though the same employees work shifts at both locations.</em>&nbsp; But this thread is about Fresh, so...yeah, see first graf.

				So far, I think I like their paninis and wraps best.&nbsp; And the smoothies are real good.<br /><br />Bstewart, I&#039;ve never actually been inside the place although I&#039;m a member of NYSC.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only ordered in.&nbsp; The delivery service is pretty good and everything comes well packaged.

				One look at their menu and I can safely say that their claim of not offering fats or carbs, two nutritional buzzwords that man people don&#039;t seem to be able to truly comprehend, is untrue.&nbsp; While egg whites are low in fat and cholesterol, they still contain some of both (and this is saying nothing of the offer of beef sausage), and all fruits contain carbohydrates in the form of natural sugars.
