				It was made public today that the government is keeping a database of all (if not all, then a good chunk at least) phone calls (see: http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/05/11/nsa.phonerecords.ap/index.html). While I realize that there are specific phone companies that provide customer information to the government (per the article) I am curious to know if this would include VOIP (voice over ip - Vonage is one)?<br /><br />And, if they are not currently monitoring VOIP users but eventually will, then do you think that VOIP companies keep the same types of records as regular land line users?<br /><br />Additionally - what about other Internet-based &quot;phone service&quot; such as Google Talk or Skype?<br /><br />I guess I am just confused as to how the government is handling their records when not everyone uses the same technology when communicating with people. Of course, if they are just not telling us about it, then my confusion may only have to last for a very long time...&nbsp; :roll:

				I must start having more interesting phone conversations. Whining about my job just isn&#39;t going to cut it anymore.<br /><br />This could be the groundwork for a whole new art form - the fictive phone call, which entertains, enlightens and perhaps embarrasses. (I wonder what would make a CIA official squirm and blush?)

				NO, what would REALLY be funny is if EVERYONE started having the SAME conversation!<br /><br />Like Rev Billy getting all these people to pull out their cell phones and recite the first amendment at 5.00 every evening at the wall st station (I&#39;m probably screwing up some details here but you get the idea).<br /><br />If a substantial number of people picked up their phones at a certain time everyday and made exactly the&nbsp; same call ... yeah, I know it wouldn&#39;t change the world, but I think it would be cool.

				How about 4:20, to make a different point? Oh, wait, nevermind...<br /><br />Seriously, though, according to the press reports, the system doesn&#39;t record phone calls at all, it just basically stores and analyzes everyone&#39;s phone records (which is bad enough in the hands of the government). Unless you happen to regularly call people who the government thinks (probably wrongly) is a terrorist, they won&#39;t bother to wiretap you. And hopefully any actual wiretap still requires a court order through FISA, but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me too much if the administration has chosen to ignore that too...<br />

				<br />http://www.qwest.com/index.html<br /><br />http://www.nydailynews.com/news/wn_report/story/417020p-352316c.html<br /><br />** unskilled superlong hyperlink **<br /><br />10 things you should know about phone scandal <br /><br />1. What is the National Security Agency doing? <br />The government spy agency is collecting the telephone records of ordinary Americans and building a massive database of nearly every call made within the country. We&#39;re talking 200 million phone lines across the U.S. and billions of calls, including an untold number just in New York City. <br /><br />2. When did this start? <br />Shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, according to USA Today. The bigger question is, where does the NSA snooping stop? Because if they can track our calls, there&#39;s little to prevent them from reading our e-mails, text and video messages. Even Internet phone services that encrypt their calls could be vulnerable to Big Brother. <br /><br />3. Why is the NSA doing this? <br />Identify potential terrorists by tracking who talks to whom in personal and business calls, whether local or long distance. It&#39;s a process known as &quot;social network analysis&quot; that aims at identifying previously undetected connections between people. <br /><br />4. Are the feds listening in to our phone calls? <br />No. But they are keeping track of who we call. The NSA records don&#39;t include names and addresses. But critics say identifying a caller from a phone number is a snap. They also question the government&#39;s rationale for doing this because terrorists can easily get off &quot;the grid&quot; by using pay phones, calling cards and Internet cafes. They can also cover their tracks by using disposable - or a variety of - cell phones. <br /><br />5. Which telephone companies turned over their records to the NSA? <br />Verizon - with 7 million landline users just in New York State - AT&amp;T, and BellSouth Corp. cooperated with the feds. They are the nation&#39;s biggest telecommunications companies and provide local and wireless phone service to more than 200 million customers. But Qwest, which has 14 million customers in 14 mostly Western states, refused. <br /><br />6. What&#39;s President Bush&#39;s position? <br />Bush insists the feds are not &quot;mining or trolling through the personal lives&quot; of Americans. He says the NSA&#39;s actions are &quot;lawful&quot; and that he has briefed members of Congress. <br /><br />7. What does Congress say? <br />Many Democrats and some Republicans are outraged and are demanding answers. They suspect it may be unconstitutional and violate privacy rights. Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) has vowed to grill phone company honchos about the NSA snooping. But Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) is defending the program as a necessary tool for fighting terrorism. <br /><br />8. What is the potential political fallout? <br />It could stall the confirmation of Bush&#39;s pick to run the CIA, Air Force Gen. Michael Hayden. He was already taking flak for spearheading the NSA&#39;s electronic eavesdropping program on telephone calls and e-mails from within the U.S. to suspected terrorists overseas. <br /><br />9. So that&#39;s different from what we&#39;re finding out now? <br />Yes. That program involved the NSA tapping telephone calls and e-mails from within the U.S. to suspected terrorist overseas - without warrants. This NSA program keeps tabs on all of us - also without our knowledge. <br /><br />10. What happens now? <br />Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) warned of a &quot;major constitutional confrontation.&quot; The debate over civil liberties and the legal underpinnings for the Bush administration&#39;s actions has already begun. But the public is divided over how much privacy should be sacrificed in the name of safety from terrorism. <br /><br />&nbsp;(I am not divided&nbsp; :| )<br />Corky Siemaszko <br /><br />What the administration has said <br />about domestic surveillance: <br />Jan. 23 <br />Gen. Michael Hayden, deputy director of national intelligence: &quot;This is not about intercepting conversations between people in the United States. ... This is focused. It&#39;s targeted. It&#39;s very carefully done. You shouldn&#39;t worry.&quot; <br />Jan. 25 <br />President Bush: &quot;This is a targeted program to intercept communications in which intelligence professionals have reason to believe that at least one person is a member or agent of Al Qaeda or a related terrorist organization. The program applies only to international communications.&quot; <br />Feb. 6 <br />Attorney General Alberto Gonzales: &quot;Only international communications are authorized for interception under this program. ... To protect the privacy of Americans still further, the NSA employs safeguards to minimize the unnecessary collection and dissemination of information about U.S. persons.&quot; <br />Yesterday: <br />President Bush: &quot;The privacy of ordinary Americans is fiercely protected in all our activities. We&#39;re not mining or trolling through the personal lives of millions of innocent Americans.&quot; <br />NSA spokesman Don Weber: &quot;The NSA takes its legal responsibilities seriously and operates within the law.&quot;

				Thanks, TRX. SusanG at DailyKos has a rundown of why people should be quite concerned about this program (http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/5/12/123644/354). (I, for one, am not necessarily against data mining of phone records, I just would rather the phone companies do it themselves upon specific requests from the NSA, with court supervision. That&#39;s certainly not what&#39;s apparently happening here.) Briefly:<br /><br />1. It&#39;s inefficient.<br />2. It&#39;s costly.<br />3. It&#39;s been lied about.<br />4. It&#39;s illegal.<br />5. Subcontractors have access to the data.<br />6. The data might be shared with other agencies and corporations.<br />7. Corporations could have contact information leaked for political purposes.<br />8. Email, IMs, and SMS may also be being tracked.<br />9. Blackmail opportunities are ripe.<br />10. It&#39;s un-American and there&#39;s no oversight.<br /><br />(Numbers 6-9 are distracting, but the other issues are important, I think.)<br /><br /><br /><br />

				An article (http://news.com.com/2100-1028_3-6071780.html?part=rss&amp;tag=6071780&amp;subj=news) from CNET news will hopefully clarify and enlighten.<br /><br />It&#39;s probably a good time for us to write our representatives and let them know how we feel.&nbsp; Hopefully the 60some percent people who have no problem with the government keeping tabs on us is not a representative sample of our society.&nbsp; I&#39;d hope we don&#39;t throw away our liberty and privacy so easily.

				One person&#39;s experience questioning their provider about this issues (Verizon) (http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/51530#1306213):<br /><br />Today I called Verizon customer support to protest my information being divulged to the NSA. First I got the operator who wanted to direct my call. I said that this morning I read in the paper that Verizon was sharing my call records and personal information with the NSA, that this directly violates their own declared privacy policy, and asked the operator if she thought that was wrong.&nbsp; She hesitated at first, and then said that Yes, while she&#39;s just the operator, and she doesn&#39;t use Verizon, she lives in Alabama, she did think that was wrong, and that she&#39;d gotten a lot of calls about that today, and she would be upset too. I thanked her, and she directed me to customer service. <br /><br />I said the same thing to the woman I talked to at Customer Service, and she directed me to someone higher up. The higher up got on the phone, and I said the same thing. She put me on hold for a second and then came back and read robotically from a script -- a statement to the effect that Verizon takes privacy concerns very seriously, but that because the NSA is a highly classified program they are not allowed to comment. Then she asked if I wanted to know her personal opinion, not Verizon&#39;s opinion, but hers personally. I said yes, surprised. <br /><br />She said that she&#39;s just an average American, she pays her bills on time, she doesn&#39;t do anything illegal, and you know what, if the government wants to listen to her phone calls, it doesn&#39;t matter to her at all, because she&#39;s confident that there&#39;s nothing in there that the government could hold against her, and besides, we don&#39;t even know if the article is accurate. Then she said that the media is sometimes a good thing, but it&#39;s a bad thing when it dwells only on the negative - and all they report is bad news. The government can do what it wants if it means protecting us. We had a lively debate. <br /><br />I said that eavesdropping on Americans violates the 4th amendment, specifying the need for probable cause and a search warrant, that this violates the Constitution. I asked if it made sense to give up the freedom we&#39;re fighting for. I asked her how Verizon sharing my calls with the government was any different from the behavior of a totalitarian police state. She asked if I thought I was taking that a little far - after all, there are no concentration camps. I brought up the CIA secret prisons in Eastern Europe and Guantanamo Bay, where thousands are held without trial, without a lawyer, indefinitely, and by all accounts routinely tortured. She said she&#39;s a passive person, there&#39;s nothing she can do about all this. I said that&#39;s what the Germans said. She laughed. <br /><br />She had a good sense of humor about it all, and argued her case pretty well - perhaps the most cogent example of comfortable middle class complacency I&#39;ve ever heard. She repeated the No Comment script Verizon gave her a few times, interspersed in our discussion, and reiterated that her personal opinion had nothing to do with Verizon. She said that she thought going into Iraq was wrong, but it&#39;s over, it&#39;s done with, we&#39;re there, we just have to keep moving forward. I said It&#39;s not over, there are people dying every day. She said her son is going into the service this August, and while she doesn&#39;t know if she agrees with that, who is she to stand in the way of his decision? &quot;Every person has the right to live as they choose.&quot; &quot;Not every person, unfortunately,&quot; I said. &quot;In America they do.&quot; &quot;Do I have the right to not have my personal phone calls listened to by the government?&quot; &quot;Well, you don&#39;t know that the government is doing that.&quot; &quot;Yes, but don&#39;t I have the right? How do I know that right is being respected?&quot; &quot;Again, we can&#39;t comment on whether or not the article is accurate.&quot; &quot;Well, I believe you&#39;re directly violating my contract by going against your own stated privacy policy. Do I have the right to charge you $200 for violating my contract?&quot; She laughed. &quot;No, you don&#39;t.&quot; &quot;See, well, not everyone has the same rights.&quot; <br /><br />She thanked me and said that she&#39;d written my name and phone number down. &quot;Good, give it to the Pentagon,&quot; I said. She laughed and we parted amicably.

				Do they really think that &quot;we can&#39;t comment&quot; crap is going to convince anyone that they&#39;re <em>not</em> sharing our phone records? I mean, if they weren&#39;t sharing phone records, we&#39;d get an emphatic &quot;no&quot; from them, right? What am I missing?

JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer<br />Mon May 22, 10:58 PM ET<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />A lawsuit filed Monday on behalf of author Studs Terkel and other professionals seeks to stop AT&amp;T from giving customer phone records to the National Security Agency without a court order.<br /><br />The plaintiffs, who also include a doctor and a state lawmaker, said they rely on confidentiality in their work and are worried their clients will be less likely to phone them if they think the government collects lists of the numbers they are calling.<br /><br />USA Today reported on May 11 that AT&amp;T and other phone companies complied with an NSA request for the phone records of millions of ordinary Americans after the Sept. 11 attacks.<br /><br />San Antonio-based AT&amp;T said Monday it&#39;s obliged to assist government agencies responsible for protecting the public, as allowed within the law.<br /><br />The six plaintiffs, whose legal team includes lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union, claim the telephone giant violated the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which prevents phone companies from releasing records to the government unless there is an emergency.<br /><br />The lawsuit, filed in federal district court, seeks to include all Illinois AT&amp;T customers as plaintiffs in a class action. The plaintiffs are not seeking monetary damages.<br /><br />&quot;Having been blacklisted from working in television during the McCarthy era, I know the harm of government using private corporations to intrude into the lives of innocent Americans,&quot; Terkel said in a statement. &quot;When government uses the telephone companies to create massive databases of all our phone calls it has gone too far.&quot;<br /><br />Harvey Grossman of the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois said the NSA program could interfere with the ability of lawyers to deal with their clients and doctors to communicate with patients.<br /><br />The plaintiffs besides Terkel are State Rep. Barbara Flynn Currie, D-Chicago; Rabbi Gary Gerson of Temple B&#39;nai Abraham Zion in Oak Park; Diane Geraghty, a Loyola University law professor; attorney James Montgomery, former corporation counsel for the City of Chicago; and Dr. Quinten Young, a doctor and advocate for health care reform.<br /><br />The action follows similar lawsuits filed in other states.<br /><br />The Bush administration has urged a judge to dismiss a similar case, saying it threatens to divulge state secrets and jeopardize national security. The government argued in briefs that the courts cannot decide the constitutionality of the president&#39;s asserted wartime powers to eavesdrop on Americans without warrants.<br /><br />___<br /><br />On the Net:<br /><br />http://www.aclu-il.org<br /><br /><br />

				I for one don&#39;t buy into this B.S. Listen to people yammering on their cellphones all day! People doing business at the office; chatting with family at home.......honestly, how the HELL could the gov&#39;t pull this off?<br /><br />Personally, I feel the bigger issue is monitoring personal e-mail at work. While people should definitely be banned from visiting porn sites, the idea that personal e-mail can be scrutinized is highly disturbing. <br /><br />Since I don&#39;t have a cell phone, I often use the internet to keep track of what&#39;s going on with my friends/family. It&#39;s not intrusive like a phone call, doesn&#39;t disturb co-workers and is thus more efficient. If I want to bitch about my boss, shouldn&#39;t I be allowed to do so without fear of repercussions (assuming of course there are no death threats involved!!)??<br /><br />THAT, to me, is the greater concern, a more realistic invasion of privacy and 1st amendment violation with direct consequences.
