				I&#039;ve never taken advantage of NYC Restaurant Week before.&nbsp; Is it really a good deal?&nbsp; It seems like at least some of the places on the list would cost that amount without the special price, no?<br /><br />Any particular tips?<br /><br />Thanks.

				Yes!&nbsp; It&#039;s a great idea, I always take advantage of Restaurant Week NYC.<br /><br />Here is my suggestion:<br /><br />I can&#039;t afford to eat at most of these restaurants under normal circumstances, so I like to find the special restaurant week menu online (not always available for every place, but usually you can find it) and then go to menupages.com or something and compare prices.&nbsp; You will see that sometimes it&#039;s not that great of a deal, and sometimes it&#039;s an incredible deal.&nbsp; I remember being really impressed with a Restaurant Week lunch at Smith and Wollensky last time around.&nbsp; Oh, and Tao, I had a really good Restaurant Week experience there.<br /><br />Oh yea, one more tip: keeping it down to one glass of wine is best because at most of these fancy places, they&#039;re pretty expensive.<br /><br />

				Most of the time, the Restaurant Week menu is so limited that it&#039;s actually not worth it, because you may not find anything you like and/or you may not experience the true flavors of the particular restaurant.<br /><br />That being said, I wish some restaurants in Astoria would participate!

				The impression I&#039;ve had is that they plan a specific set of options for the Restaurant Week menu, which often leaves us vegetarians out, and may be smaller portions for each of the three courses than three courses order off the menu - so not so much a bargain.&nbsp; Is mine an incorrect assumption?

				In the little experience that I have had with NYC Restaurant Week, your assumption has been correct. The menus dont usually reflect what the restaurant is like most of the time. I think that can work for them or against them. <br /><br />Generally there are 2 to 3 options for appetizer/entree/dessert and most of the time, none of those options encompass what the place is known for.... a meat dish, a poultry dish, a seafood dish.... the menus seem (my opinion) to be items that are easy for them to mass assemble.<br /><br />But I can see how if someone was going to the theatre or some event, that you would take advantage of this kind of prix fixe. They can get you in and out and on to the next reservation pretty efficiently during this time.<br /><br />I am probably not the norm though....I like to go somewhere and order whatever that restaurant is know for...i like to try things that I dont know already know what it is going to taste like. Does that make sense?<br /><br />

				I did restaurant week at Rosa Mexicano a couple years ago with a group of 8 people. Most of them just ended up ordering off the regular menu. It wasn&#039;t all that much more expensive than the restaurant week deal, anyway. It wouldn&#039;t really behoove many Astoria restaurants to do it, since at most of them you can spend under $35 for a good dinner (before drinks) as it is.

				I&#039;d suggest trying a more upscale restaurant on the list than those anyway.&nbsp; Some places do have a specific menu that week to choose from and also don&#039;t forget it&#039;s for an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had great meals at Arcos and La Fusta from Rest. Week.&nbsp; Keep in mind many restaurants want to get on the list because its good advertising for them, not because it&#039;ll be a great deal for us at $25.&nbsp;

				I actually just ate at Le Cirque for lunch today. it was $25 with an appetizer, entree, and dessert. The food was all good, but to be honest with you, if I was paying more than $25 for the food I got, I would have been a little irritated. But for $25, I got a good meal at a restaurant that I wouldn&#039;t normally go to.

				I went to Spice Market for lunch today with a friend. Great looking place and the food was fantastic. I was expecting a lot less but it was surprisingly filling. Definitely not a place I would normally go to but it was a nice experience and I&#039;m glad I went. Appetizer, entree, and desert for under $30 in the Meatpacking District.. can&#039;t go wrong.
