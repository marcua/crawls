				<br />The Queens Historical Society is offering a walking tour of <strong>Forest Hills</strong> this coming <strong>Sunday, November 8</strong>, in conjunction with its exhibition &quot;Six Outstanding Women of Queens.&quot; One of those women is Helen Keller, who lived in Forest Hills for 20 years! The site of her former residence is on the tour, along with all other Forest Hills highlights. <br /><br /><br />If you&#039;re not familiar with this neighborhood, this is a great opportunity to get to know one of Queens&#039; nicest neighborhoods. And if you already know Forest Hills, here&#039;s a chance to gain insights into its history and culture.<br /><br /><br />Go to walkingtourforesthills.eventbrite.com (http://walkingtourforesthills.eventbrite.com) to register for the tour, or call the Historical Society at (718) 939-0647, extension 17.<br /><br /><br />From Astoria, take the R to Forest Hills, or the N/Q to the 7 then transfer in Jackson Heights for the E, F or R.<br /><br /><br />Here are some more details:<br /><em>Forest Hills, one of NYC&#039;s most desirable residential neighborhoods, has a rich heritage. Its centerpiece is Forest Hills Gardens, an enclave of beautiful freestanding houses and village greens that was designed on the &quot;garden city&quot; model and has influenced urban planners to this day. Other sights on the tour include historically significant locales of Forest Hills, along with landmarked buildings, abundant Tudor and Art Deco architecture, and gathering spots that have remained popular for generations in the community. In addition, the tour will visit places associated with local ethnic populations as well as those with a connection to various celebrities who&#039;ve lived in Forest Hills -- including author/activist Helen Keller, one of the &quot;Six Outstanding Women of Queens&quot; celebrated in the Queens Historical Society&#039;s current exhibition.<br /></em><br />The tour will be led by Adrienne Onofri, longtime Queens resident, licensed sightseeing guide and the author of <em> Walking Queens: 30 Tours for Discovering the Diverse Communities, Historic Places, and Natural Treasures of New York City&#039;s Largest Borough</em>.
