			Hi Everyone,I&#039;m writing because starting Sunday, 1/28 at 6:30pm I&#039;m going to be hosting monthly storytelling home concerts in Jackson Heights, Queens and hope you&#039;ll come.If you&#039;ve never been to a storytelling home concert, it takes place in the living room with about 15 people sitting around (without a campfire), sipping beverages, and listening to 3-4 performers tell stories (usually non-fiction, but sometimes folktales). We have a sofa, chairs, meditation cushions, and pillows; coffee, tea and some refreshments; oh, and a cat (Milo, he&#039;s very sweet) and bird.I created this event, &quot;Come Over For Coffee,&quot; because it&#039;s the kind of evening I&#039;d like to attend, and I thought it would be a good way to bring neighbors together.As you plan your month and are thinking about ways to keep warm, this will be a friendly and toasty evening. I&#039;m asking for $15 donations to pay the performers but it&#039;s just a suggestion.&nbsp; Please let me know if you plan on coming since seating is limited.&nbsp; &nbsp;Email me at heightshub@gmail.com for reservations and our address.<br /><br />Also, thanks for any help you can provide spreading the word.<br /><br />Nancy Goldman<br />
