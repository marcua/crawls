				Alright, I&#039;m not at all masking my anxiety about coming up with the PERFECT exciting, fun, interesting, entertaining Queens &amp; New York activities to make my sister, niece &amp; nephew from North Carolina fall in love with this place when they&#039;re here for a short visit this week.&nbsp; I had generally thought it would be easy, but now as I&#039;m trying to make specific plans, I&#039;m finding it more difficult than I&#039;d expected.<br /><br />My niece is pretty mellow, and my nephew loves heavy metal and skateboarding.&nbsp; So - not easy finding things they&#039;d both like.&nbsp; Plus, my sister wouldn&#039;t be happy with any content or environment that isn&#039;t appropriate for them (understandably).<br /><br />Me and my sister would be in heaven with just a food and cultural diversity exploration of the city, but my niece and nephew are both difficult eaters.<br /><br />Anyone have any ideas, pointers, resources to recommend, guidance to offer?&nbsp; Be assured that all thoughts will be greatly appreciated!

				There are some suggestions for visiting kids in this thread (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=10651.0).&nbsp; Those kids were younger, but there might be some overlap.&nbsp; The Queens Hall of Science/Zoo/Flushing Meadows Park/Unisphere/Fairgrounds might be fun - your nephew could even bring his skateboard.

				Thanks!&nbsp; I think some of this does help, though you&#039;re right, some is geared to younger kids.&nbsp; My niece and nephew did enjoy the whole Hall of Science, Unisphere, etc. experience when they were here about a year ago.
