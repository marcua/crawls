				Went there this weekend, and am really curious what others who&#039;ve tried it thought. The people sitting around us all seemed totally enchanted, but we were like &quot;ehhh&quot; on some things (but some stuff was nice). Admittedly, I am from Texas, so I have a lot of feelings about Mexican food... and am on a constant search for something in the city to soothe that homesick spot.<br /><br /><br />Pros: Drinks were good (and strong). Preferred the frozen mango margarita to the fancier one with hibiscus or whatnot (which came with a flower floating on it). Decor cool, energetic vibe, more people than I&#039;ve seen in that spot in quite a while. Interesting entree involved skirt steak, an enchilada and some potatoes. Pretty solid, though I&#039;d say a notch below Rosa Mexicano -- to compare it to other &#039;fancy Mexican food&#039;. I think it was a bit better than Mojave, though. And a nice alternative to Mojave&#039;s dim, sexy-cave-dweller spa vibe, which sometimes is too cheesy for me to take. <br /><br /><br />Cons: Not a chip/salsa in sight, though we didn&#039;t ask. Queso appetizer even came with flour tortillas instead of chips, which still was good. Different, though I like that crunch with my tequila buzz. My dining partner (a big &#039;enchilada guy&#039;) wasn&#039;t too excited about his enchiladas, and the flavor of the beans just didn&#039;t seem quite right either. Also, pretty loud -- made me sort of long for the quiet vibe of Pachanga Patterson. And strange, grumpy tall blond porn star hostess in crazy heels (borrowed from a Euro cafe on 30th ave I guess?) makes for a weird first impression, though rest of staff seemed friendly and on-the-ball.<br /><br /><br />Overall, glad we went and am happy to have this option before seeing a movie, though we&#039;d probably stick more with Pachanga Patterson or more hole-in-the-wall spots (not sure the $$ was totally worth it -- will try other stuff, though). Will always miss the ol&#039; Cup, though!

				I went on opening night and liked most of what I got. We ordered tableside guac and they said there were 2 avocados in it, but I didn&#039;t see them crush up 2 avocados, so that was weird. One thing I liked quite a bit was the octopus and chorizo taco - another tasty octopus dish to add to the roster of good octopus in Astoria. We were also served chips and salsa.<br /><br /><br />giantcookie, are you looking for Tex-Mex or actual Mexican food? As a California native, after a while of living in NY I had to give up the idea of finding great Cal-Mex food here (some are close but no cigar). The Mexican immigrants in NYC are from more southerly Mexico (mostly Puebla), whereas US border communities/states are used to the influence of immigrant food from the northern reaches of Mexico. Once I understood that, I came to understand that the Mexican food here in NYC is quite good, just different.

				For those who&#039;ve been, did the menu have decent vegetarian options and/or were they willing to modify items to make them vegetarian friendly? I looked at the menu online, not sure if that&#039;s the final menu or not, and it looked like there were few options. We were very excited about the possibility of a good, nice Mexican place (the places on Broadway -- Las Magaritas and the former Guacamole were awful), but without veggie options, the wife won&#039;t go.

My vegetarian friend who went loved it. I just looked at the menu and spotted over a dozen veg-friendly items. The service is so that I imagine they&#039;d make adjustments if asked.

				Went there last Friday and loved the food.&nbsp; We had both Chicken and Shrimp Empanadas, Lobster tacos, Carnitas Tacos, and the Carne Asada.&nbsp; Loved all of it.&nbsp; We will definitely be going back.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Regarding vegetarian options, are grasshoppers vegetarian??&nbsp; They have grasshopper taco!&nbsp; Hmmmmm.&nbsp; We didn&#039;t try those.<br /><br /><br />As for the tall, blond and very young hostess, she did look a little out of place but we found her to be very sweet and helpful.

				Nice place, solid service, good food but really small portions for the price.&nbsp; They give you 2 tacos with each order but they are mini tacos.&nbsp; Not sure i&#039;ll be back except for their happy hour specials at the bar.&nbsp;

				my yelp review...lil long<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue;" class="bbc_font">well other reviewers were pretty much right on.&nbsp; your hostesses provide the first impression and they help set the tone.&nbsp; if she rolled her eyes one more time, i don&#039;t know what i was going to do.&nbsp; we were seated at a deuce and we preferred a booth, it was a monday night and we took that into consideration, not being unrealistic to ask for a table of four.</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue;" class="bbc_font">the owner/chef was sitting at the bar. he owns 8 other restaurants in the city, different names.our waiter was from the restaurant on 92nd st.&nbsp; he&#039;s going back in a week. he was training others.&nbsp; i was disappointed that he wasn&#039;t going to be a staple as he had the sincerity and interest that i look for.the margherita didn&#039;t have enough alcohol in it.&nbsp; i rarely finish an entire drink and well, i did this time and felt nothing, even the bf was surprised.&nbsp; his sangria was pretty good though.we ordered, the baked empanadas, ceviche, guacamole, carne asada and carnitas tacos and two drinks, $100, with tip (lil pricey)the shrimp empanada is not to be missed, nice chunks of shrimp in a creamy sauce.&nbsp; the beef empanada wasn&#039;t memorablei love ceviche. it&#039;s mixture wasn&#039;t anything i had ever had before.&nbsp; the lime was the same but the coche and rocoto was different for me.&nbsp; it didn&#039;t add or take away it just wasn&#039;t anything i would order again. wasn&#039;t exciting. it was also surprisingly too spicy for me.the guacamole was in a word, fresh, no one flavor overpowered, really good.both tacos were good, i&#039;d have to say i&#039;m partial to the carne asada. great flavors.i will definitely be back and i sure hope they find hostesses that make a favorable impact.</span>
