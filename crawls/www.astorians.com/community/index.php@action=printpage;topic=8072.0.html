NYC Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) Commissioner Jonathan Mintz wants business owners and consumers to know that licensed unenclosed sidewalk cafés can now install approved outdoor heaters. By extending the sidewalk café season, restaurants are now able to truly offer patrons the quintessential al fresco New York dining experience - all year round. <br /><br />&quot;Together with the restaurant industry, we have found a way to hold off winter,&quot; said Commissioner Mintz. <br />Read the full press release from DCA: http://www.nyc.gov/html/dca/html/pr2007/pr_092407.shtml (http://www.nyc.gov/html/dca/html/pr2007/pr_092407.shtml)<br /><br /><strong>How can restaurants install approved café heaters?</strong><br />To install approved portable natural gas heaters, restaurants must first have a license to operate a sidewalk café from DCA, and then must receive clearance from both the New York City Department of Buildings (DOB: http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob (http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob)) and the Fire Department (FDNY: http://www.nyc.gov/fdny (http://www.nyc.gov/fdny)). With all required plans and paperwork in order, the City has committed to completing the application process in no more than 18 days. Restaurant owners can access a simple Q&amp;A (with a sample floor plan from the Department of Buildings) that walks applicants through the process, step-by-step.<br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/dca/downloads/pdf/Sidewalk%20Cafe%20Heaters%20FAQ.pdf (http://www.nyc.gov/html/dca/downloads/pdf/Sidewalk%20Cafe%20Heaters%20FAQ.pdf)<br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/dca/downloads/pdf/cafe_heaters_sample_plan.pdf (http://www.nyc.gov/html/dca/downloads/pdf/cafe_heaters_sample_plan.pdf)<br /><br /><strong>About NYC sidewalk cafés</strong><br />Restaurants with sidewalk cafés are at an all-time high, with approximately 900 legally operating throughout the City. Interested in opening a sidewalk café? Download a license application here, or to find one near you, browse DCA&#039;s full list of legally operating sidewalk cafés citywide.<br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/dca/downloads/pdf/swc_lic_app_final.pdf (http://www.nyc.gov/html/dca/downloads/pdf/swc_lic_app_final.pdf)<br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/dca/downloads/pdf/091607_online_list.pdf (http://www.nyc.gov/html/dca/downloads/pdf/091607_online_list.pdf)<br /><br />For more information, call 311 or go online to the DCA website:<br />http://www.nyc.gov/consumers &nbsp;(http://www.nyc.gov/consumers)<br /><br />Here&#039;s to Warm Sidewalk Dining!<br />

				Cool.&nbsp; I like sitting outside.<br /><br />I mean, I&#039;m torn because it&#039;s kind of a waste of energy but the French do it and therefore I&#039;m in favor.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve noticed that several sidewalk cafes seem to have had these outdoor heaters for the last year or two.&nbsp; Were they being used illegally?&nbsp; This press release makes it seem like the city has only now approved the use of these heaters.
