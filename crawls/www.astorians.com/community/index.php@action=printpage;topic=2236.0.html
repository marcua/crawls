				I&#39;m sure the Greeks will be watching! Were you here a year or two ago when Greece won the Euro Cup? You would have thought the War was Over and the Boys were coming Home! Cars honking, flags everywhere!<br /><br />I was definitely hoping to see a couple games myself! Here&#39;s the TV schedule:<br /><br />http://www.soccertv.com/wc-us.cfm (http://www.soccertv.com/wc-us.cfm)<br /><br />ABC, ESPN, and ESPN2...<br />

				I would absolutely be up for watching World Cup games in the &#39;hood. Even if they&#39;re at completely odd hours. If I see anyplace advertising that they are showing matches, I will let folks know. I have a nice memory of watching the U.S.-Germany match four years ago at a pub in Murray Hill at about 8am. Don&#39;t worry, I was on vacation and so didn&#39;t go to work that day. See? I DO have a responsible bone in my body! <br /><br />BTW, when Greece won the Euro Cup, it happened to be July 4th. I never thought I&#39;d see about three times as many Greek flags that day as American flags. Wild.

				What&#39;s ironic is not only Ecuador made it, but is in the same bracket of teams with Germany, Poland and Costa Rica..<br /><br />Twelve days from now USA will face Czech Republic to hopefull prove that they&#39;re ready to rock and roll with the big boys.<br /><br />I also hear that there are bars in Corona that will show the game when Mexico goes live.<br /><br />That as well as some Ecuadorian bars as well that will show it one way or another.<br /><br />La Oficina- 104st. and Corona, just one block away from the train to your left.

				ok, i&#39;m a slacker, and i&#39;ve only begun to look at the schedule today. <br /><br />all the games are at <br />8:55am<br />9am<br />11:55am<br />2:30pm<br /><br />um................ when the hell am i going to be able to watch a game? i&#39;m working during those hours?<br /><br />remember when the world cup games were played at like the ass crack of dawn? Coca Cola made the loveliest commercial where hardcore fans got themselves waaaaaaaaaay early in the morning to watch the games together.&nbsp; it was beautiful.&nbsp; well, that&#39;s what me and my parents did. we&#39;d go to bed early then get up at 3am to watch a match. then go to sleep again. <br /><br />but this year.... i dont think bars and other venues are open at 8:55am for matches.<br />nor are many of us able to get to places as we are on the trains getting to work at that time. or already in work at those hours.&nbsp; and 2:30pm is like the middle of the day. it&#39;s not like you can just cut out at 2pm to watch a match. well, at least i dont got it like that.<br /><br />ok... i&#39;m whiny.<br /><br />does anyone have solutions to this problem? it would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Rosemary

				Wow!&nbsp; Today&#39;s Czech Republic vs. USA game was awesome!&nbsp; Wonderful playing by all, though.&nbsp; Beer Garden was perfect for this game.&nbsp; A little testosterone heavy, but it was ok.&nbsp; Women like the sports, too! Especially soccer and baseball. Hot!<br /><br />Edited to eliminate results, b/c of complaint.&nbsp; (how do I make text invisible???)

				Sorry Josh, but it&#39;s not like it&#39;s going to be played again!&nbsp; This is not a tape delay issue.&nbsp; Games are only showed once, at least according to soccertv.com.&nbsp; So that&#39;s why I commented like I did.&nbsp; Maybe I&#39;l go back and color the text white or something, though.<br /><br />

				I have a DVR, Meg!!!!&nbsp; I&#39;ve been recording all the games, and have been doing a good job of avoiding the scores and results.&nbsp; If you put a result down, just hide it with a white color type.&nbsp; This is the game I&#39;ve been looking most forward to!&nbsp; I&#39;m sure there are others that might be in the same boat that have to work, but still want to watch the game without knowing the results.

				Sorry, Josh.&nbsp; DVR hadn&#39;t even occurred to me (too poor to afford such technology)&nbsp; - I wish someone had warned about that possibility.&nbsp; Saw that other wins had been posted and no one complained so I thought it didn&#39;t matter to anyone.&nbsp; I tried white colored type but you could still see it.&nbsp; Not sure how to do that font coloring thing.&nbsp; I hope a lot of people didn&#39;t see it (except you did, and apologies again)<br /><br />Oh well, now I&#39;ve learned from my mistake at least.

				depends on what you mean by &quot;watch&quot;<br /><br />BG is cool if more interested in studio 57 meets BBQ meets beer garden atmosphere instead of the actual game...viewing conditions not ideal any way you slice that mellon....<br /><br />most typical sports bars will offer the better viewing capacity but there&#39;s the specter of frat party debauchary if the wrong team wins........ or looses......<br /><br />on the other hand, i hear Paris has a massive outdoor screen in front of the Aifel tower so you might want to check that out...<br /><br />on a less serious note, i am going to do everything in my power to avoid the BG on Sunday you guys....it&#39;ll be tough...i hope i persevere :-)<br /><br />but really, i expect mostly celebratory moods everywhere, should be mardi grass all over...<br /><br />

				sparrow -- across the street from BG, is also advertising viewing.&nbsp; I&#39;ve never seen a TV in there but perhaps worth investigating.<br /><br />BG is a little less than ideal but good enough for my casual watching.&nbsp; if you do want to SEE the game, be there by 1:30 to secure a spot and avoid the line.&nbsp; don&#39;t plan on bbq either as that line was the first to have an &#39;extended wait time&#39; due to madness.&nbsp;

				i think we should all admit that we are powerles over the Beer Garden...that our WC lives had become unmanageable...and only the power of a Zinadine Zidan last minute goal could restore us to sanity.....i say 1:30 is a pretty safe bet for one of the good tables...i&#39;ll try and save some seats......

				Hey all --<br /><br />Just so you know, for those of you planning to go to the BG - since I live right next door to the Beer Garden - just now there was a line longer than any I&#39;ve ever seen before to get in.&nbsp; Of course that was partly because they weren&#39;t opening the doors until 12noon so they hadn&#39;t let anyone in yet.&nbsp; But it was a line not only up to the corner of 31st St (which I&#39;d seen before), but then wrapped around about a half street block up 31st St!!&nbsp; I&#39;d say that if you can, get there earlier than 1:30 because it looks like everyone&#39;s heading there for the game!<br /><br />I still haven&#39;t decided if I should brave it or go for a more manageable option like Sparrow or Irish Rover (where&#39;s that, MegC?).<br /><br />Maybe I&#39;ll see some of you somewhere!&nbsp; If not at the game, then at post-game-gelato-celebrations!<br /><br />-Abby

				Having it in Africa is pretty cool.&nbsp; I thought, though, that the WC always alternated between Europe and South America.&nbsp; When did it change to include Africa (which I wholeheartedly support)?

				it alternated according to the special interests that operate within the FIFA governing system.....and as with any mega-corporate affair the WC requires an obsene amount of infrastructure investment and cosmetic prep.......for the past 30 years mostly wealthy countries could afford it and the S Africa thing is a welcome transition culturally and historically although the last thing poverty around the world needs is bigger/fancier footbal stadiums, but that is a rant for another topic...anyhow FIFA has only recently gone to a continental rotation but only on a pilot basis, which means that while we all think it&#39;d be a good idea for Brazil to host it in 2014 they wont hesitate to go to bed with someone else with a fatter bank account (Australia??)...so $$$ is a major factor

For these clubs the premier tournament (on par with the world cup) is the transnational Champions League (only Euro teams) and it takes place from September to May annually. <br /><br />so 2 new tournaments to follow :wink:: champions league and Euro cup<br /><br />and to preempt your next question, though i&#39;m sure some other places around town show CL games, Nevada Smiths is pretty much the epi center http://www.grahamecurtis.com/nevadasmiths/wc2006_fixtures.html <br /><br />
