				<strong>lanseau</strong>: thank you so much for the link to the Eliot Elisofon photograph of Gloria Swanson. I remembered the shocking pink boa so vividly, and of course the pose. I believe the picture was either in Life (Magazine) or The Saturday Evening Post (my favorite magazine ever). I really took a good guess based on that memory. <br /><br /><strong>aquaecny</strong>: do you perhaps have a link to the place? I&#39;d love to see it, especially since I got fed up with the show and stopped watching it long before the final!<br /><br /><strong>megc</strong>: Gotta tell you a funny. I clinked on your original posting because when I saw the acronym <em>MUG</em>, I thought it stood for Mac Users Group! I really though I would be finding a Macintosh test of sorts!<br />&nbsp;:-D
