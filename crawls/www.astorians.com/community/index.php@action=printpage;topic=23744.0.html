				Hello! My roommate and I live in a 3 bedroom/2 bathroom two floor apartment on 31st between 34th &amp; 35th. <br /><br /><br />Full kitchen, living room, &amp; dining room. Hardwood floors, AC&#039;s installed, WiFi, &amp;&nbsp; cable (w/ showtime &amp; hbo package). Cat friendly!<br /><br /><br />2 late 20-something working girls. We split everything evenly financially. Bills range between $80 - $120 depending on electricity use. In the summer they go up obviously. <br /><br /><br />We&#039;d like someone financially responsible who can pay rent &amp; bills on time (unlike our last roommate). Someone who will clean up after themselves as well, especially if they cook or have company over (unlike our last roommate). <br /><br /><br />I can send pictures via email or you can come see the place yourself, just reply/message me!

				Hi, <br /><br /><br />my name is Boris,<br /><br /><br />I am looking to move to Astoria from Rego Park.&nbsp; A professional male with good job and references.&nbsp; I travel on monthly basis, so I&#039;d be away most of the time.&nbsp; Clean, tolerant, respectful, quiet, and almost not there.<br /><br /><br />I hope it works out for Paul, but if not, please, let me know if the room is still available.
