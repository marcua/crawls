				Channel 7 news just reported&nbsp; there were 19 shooting victims this weekend.&nbsp; I hope this isn&#039;t a trend but I do notice more violent crime in NYC being reported by news sources in the last month or two.

				It was 19 non-fatal victims with an additional 4 dead. These numbers are actually low for NYC. If we keep the homicide number under 500, which is low, that&#039;s almost 10 dead per week. Don&#039;t let the alarmist media give you the impression crime is on the rise when it&#039;s not.

				The number of people shot was well within average for the city over the past few years meaning very few shootings relatively speaking. Plus, the types of people involved in these shooting won&#039;t be deterred by stop and frisk as for the most part these are people that don&#039;t consider consequences.

				I really hate saying this, I would bet that a measurable number of the victims were people that placed themselves in a bad situation by participating in drug/gang crimes/violence themselves.

				Re-read my post. I never said someone isn&#039;t more likely to overreact if they are carrying. I said stop-and-frisk is unlikely to deter someone from carrying. Especially considering most of the offenders are very young 16-25 and do not consider consequences before they act. Also, the increase of 10% in shootings is minor considering last year was at a almost historical low. Actual homicides are down over 10% for the year-on-year. In addition, S&amp;F is unconstitutional so I don&#039;t understand how anyone can defend it.

I grew up in the BX in the 90s and know a lot more about bullets flying around than you do for sure. A vast majority of these 14 and 15 year olds do not know how the criminal justice works. You clearly don&#039;t understand the mentality. I do and that&#039;s why I moved out at the earliest possible opportunity. I got sick of being thrown up against walls by the NYPD claiming I looked like a suspect. Read the post by &quot;mm&quot; for the stats that clearly contradict everything you&#039;re saying. Good day.
