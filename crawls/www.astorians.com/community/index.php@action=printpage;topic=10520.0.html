				Hey all,<br /><br />So I&#039;m hoping to move out of my current apartment for Sept 1st and get my own place--a one bed or a studio.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got some time and some money to spend but need somewhere that will take a cat.<br /><br />My question (and what makes me think I deserve my own topic) is if anyone lives in/knows of any buildings with nice, recently remodeled apartments and would give me the contact info for the management.<br /><br />I&#039;m hoping that if I contact them now, I might be able to get into an apartment without the broker&#039;s fee. I&#039;m able to go up to 1800, but am hoping for a 1500-1600 place. <br /><br />So, anyone have any management contact information I can use? <br /><br />You know I love you all.&nbsp; :-)

				Wow, with that budget you should be able to get a two bedroom if you&#039;re real lucky.&nbsp; That&#039;s an awful lot to pay for a one-bedroom in Astoria.&nbsp; If that&#039;s the current trend, us long-timers are all f334r45ed if we ever have to move.&nbsp; &nbsp;Most of us already are as it is.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; I miss unpopular Ass-toria.<br /><br />Try the complex on 28th St and 21 Ave.&nbsp; They take pets and have no fee.&nbsp; Rent stabilized too.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)&nbsp; They have a waitlist you might be able to get on now.

				I was gonna suggest on 21 St and 21 Ave&nbsp; there is a rental office for what used to be called Marine Terrace. It&#039;s in good shape and well maintained.
