				<strong>PERMISSION TO CROSS POST<br /></strong><br />For quite some time, there have been rumors that the Louisiana Attorney<br />General had plans to investigate complaints filed against the HSUS for<br />misuse of donated funds in connection with rescue of pets from the<br />Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita ravaged areas of the southern<br />states.&nbsp; It&#39;s now official.&nbsp; Complaints and reports have indicated that<br />supplies (beds, blankets, toys, crates, x-pens, etc.) and food were<br />never allowed to be used to help the animals housed in the rescue<br />centers.&nbsp; Although thousands of pounds of top-quality food were donated,<br />many volunteers have complained that they were only allowed to feed the<br />rescued animals the cheapest, poorest quality foods they received.<br />Allegations have been made that purebred rescue groups were turned away<br />by the HSUS and not allowed to pull their own breeds from the rescue<br />centers, unless they were willing to take &quot;X&quot; number of &quot;others&quot; as<br />well.&nbsp; Additional reports indicate that at least 700 &quot;bully&quot; breed dogs<br />mysteriously disappeared from the HSUS rescue centers, never to be seen<br />again.&nbsp; It has also been widely reported that some pets were sent to<br />far-away locations, quickly adopted out, and that no real efforts were<br />made to reunite these lost pets with their original owners.<br />&nbsp;<br />If you personally volunteered in the post-hurricane rescue effort (or if<br />you know someone who did) and may have firsthand knowledge of the pet<br />rescue situation in the aftermath of the hurricanes, please contact<br />Attorney General Foti and provide him with all pertinent information to<br />assist him in his effort to ensure that funds and/or supplies donated by<br />the compassionate pet owners of the U.S. were and **will be** used for<br />the purposes for which they were donated.&nbsp; Press release and contact<br />information follow:<br />http://www.ag.state.la.us/ViewPressRel.aspx?RelID=451 (http://www.ag.state.la.us/ViewPressRel.aspx?RelID=451)<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Attorney General Charles Foti Opens Inquiry into <br />Humane Society of the United States </strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><em>March&nbsp; 27, 2006: (Baton Rouge, LA)<br /></em>Attorney General Charles C. Foti, Jr., announced today that<br />his office has opened an inquiry into allegations involving funds raised<br />for pet /owner reunions by the Humane Society of the United States<br />(HSUS). The Attorney General&#39;s Office is asking the HSUS for an<br />accounting of all funds HSUS raised for the purpose of pet rescue and<br />reunion with pet owners in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.<br />&nbsp;<br />The Attorney General&#39;s office has received numerous complaints from pet<br />owners about problems many are having finding their pets following<br />Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Through its association with other animal<br />welfare organizations nationwide, HSUS has documented and placed animals<br />in shelters around the country, often resulting in the displaced pets&#39;<br />adoption. In some cases, pet owners claim that those who are currently<br />caring for the displaced pets are refusing to reunite the pet with the<br />proper owners.<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Once again we will be on the lookout to make sure that those who seek<br />to raise money for Hurricane victims in our state, do exactly what they<br />claim to do when soliciting funds,&quot; stated General Foti, &quot;While I<br />commend the work of the many wonderful charitable organizations that<br />have come forward to help us in our time of need, I also want people to<br />know that they cannot take advantage of our situation in any way,&quot; added<br />General Foti.<br />&nbsp;<br />The Attorney General is asking anyone with information about<br />questionable fundraising activities by animal groups or any other groups<br />to please contact the Attorney General&#39;s Consumer Protection Section at<br />1-800-351-4889 or visit our website at http://www.ag.state.la.us (http://www.ag.state.la.us).<br /><br /><hr /><br />I was personally involed in the evacuation of pets from New Orleans and surrounding affected/devastated cities when HSUS allowed the North Shore Animal League to bring 200+ dogs to New York and adopt them out *before* ANY search was done to find their lawful and grieving owners. Many of those owners have been left believing that their beloved pets died by either starvation or drowning when they were forced to leave them behind because pets were *not* allowed to be taken into rescue sites. HSUS asked no-one for permission and the NSAL did their dirty little deed right here in Central Park.<br /><br />NYCMacUser

				I donated money, my mom donated money and I also secured corporate matching for my portion.&nbsp; So I&#39;m interested in following this. I wanted to go down there and help myself.&nbsp; I watched videos on the HSUS website as well as news coverage of the animal rescues.&nbsp; I can&#39;t imagine doing this work in that heat, and trudging through toxic flood water. I read a lot of sad stories about the animals that were not found in time, some dead in their locked pet carriers left by people who thought they were returning soon. <br />Anyway I&#39;m interested in following this story and visited HSUS to see their response to the investigation.<br />http://www.hsus.org/hsus_field/hsus_disaster_center/recent_activities_and_information/the_hsus_katrina.html<br /><br />It says they are cooperating with the investigation.<br />MacUser did you have your own transporation when you went down? I read that they wanted volunteers with their own cars or vans to help, and I don&#39;t have either.

				<strong>Tuesday</strong>: <br />I am disabled. <br /><br />As I was unable to make the trip, my volunteer activities were on the computer. I picked up emails from people desperate to find their pets, and helped match them up with descriptions and pictures of pets located in sanctioned shelters. We reunited hundreds upon hundreds, but were stymied when HSUS came onboard. I sent people (I knew) monies to pay for gas who were drving down to help. I made my deductible donation to The Louisiana State University—School of Veterinary Medicine who set up a huge shelter and scanned each and every pet brought to them. Those *without* chips were chipped by them to prevent HSUS from taking them. Zeno even helped me make a plea on astorians.com for feeding dishes because the staff were forced to put dog food on the ground because they had so many dogs and not enough dishes. If it were left to PETA and HSUS all those animals left behind would have been euthanized at best, tied to a post and shot in the head, at worst.<br /><br />They refused releasing dogs to breed rescues. That in itself was a travesty we couldn&#39;t oversome. Breed rescue has always been at the forefront of this kind of disaster. It makes rehoming purebred dogs so much simpler. HSUS didn&#39;t even have a scanner on hand. Most purebred dogs are microchipped. They refused the scanning of those dogs in *their* shelter. The conditions there were deplorable. I forwarded all those pleading emails that I received from LSU and displaced pet owners to Congressional representatives and to the Attorney General of LA.<br /><br />HSUS has been catagorized by the Federal Government as a terrorist organization, along with PETA because of some of their tactics. They scare me to death.<br /><br />I have been involved in animal welfare (and civil rights) since my teens. Now that I am a senior my animals are more important to me than ever before. I am not one for anthropomorphizing, but my children are all grown and gone off to find their own way, and I am left with a new set of babies—with 4 legs each—who help keep me alert and stable.<br /><br />If you have the time, please read this:<br />http://www.animalliberationfront.com/News/2005_9/HSUSvsVolunteers.htm (http://www.animalliberationfront.com/News/2005_9/HSUSvsVolunteers.htm)<br /><br />Lorrie

				That was nice of you to help them out like that and facilitate reunions. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks for the link, I just read it. I&#39;m sure it was totally hellish down there. <br />I&#39;ll wait and see what the outcome of the investigation is.
