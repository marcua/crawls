				So yes, I just moved here and have discovered wonderful Astoria Park. Since I am still looking for freelance work, I am taking my time on longer jogs/runs around this wonderful area. I love going around the park and back from where I am located (off 21st ave about 2 block from the Ditmars station).<br /><br />However, I am wondering about other kinds of runs I could take? I just took one that was about 4 miles. I ran to the park and then ran down to 30th ave and to 1st Street then back to 31st street and up 31st street to where i live. <br /><br />it was fun to say the least. anyone else have some recommendations?<br /><br />thanks<br />dun<br />

				I&#39;ve often considered running to Roosevelt Island and then taking the F to Manhattan for pancakes/diner food or just coming back to Astoria.&nbsp; I&#39;m currently getting back into shape with my running (I&#39;m a brand new NYRR member!), since I&#39;ve gotten over my injuries from autumn, and will be looking for longer runs as spring approaches.&nbsp; Right now I&#39;m trying to get through 3 miles.&nbsp; It&#39;s a struggle, but not impossible.&nbsp; I recommend plotting routes with the gmap ped hack:<br /><br />http://www.gmap-pedometer.com<br /><br />Enjoy!

				Ooooh, I&#39;ll take a look at WalkJogRun.net (oh, I just looked at the home page - looks cool!).<br /><br />Do you know coolrunning.com?&nbsp; I use their running log, and they also have forums and tips and such.&nbsp; It&#39;s great!<br /><br />A few of us here run on and off and I heard &quot;pancake run&quot; in the air recently.&nbsp; We run on the weekend down to the park, either around it or on the track, and then join up for pancakes at a local place.&nbsp; Maybe not this weekend (if it&#39;s raining) but soon.

				Yea, wow. This weekend isn&#39;t looking so great for much of anything outside.<br /><br />I am up for running with your crew, that sounds like fun to me. Have you ran in Central Park? Aside from the, &quot;Hey, I just ran in Central Park. How cool!&quot; factor... is it worth getting on the train, going in the city, running, coming back? I would hate to be all sweaty on the train. It doesn&#39;t bother me, but I am sure it would bother someone else.<br /><br />I just checked out coolrunning.com. I will give it a more thorough look-see.<br /><br />Looking forward to running around with you and your crew :)<br /><br />dun<br />

				I LOVE running at the CP reservoir!!&nbsp; It is my favorite place to run around here.&nbsp; A few of us would go there in the evenings and run 2-3 loops (so, 3 - 4.5 miles), stop for hot chocolate if we could find a place open, and then get on the train going home.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think we were stinky offensive to anyone on the train.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; I&#39;ve also run along some of the streets in CP, but always with people who know their way around (I don&#39;t know CP that well).&nbsp; I have always run the reservoir at night.&nbsp; In a couple weeks, I&#39;d be up for going to run there again.&nbsp; Maybe we could get some of us back together to run?&nbsp; Fun!

				I&#39;m down with the Res. and ready for pancake.<br /><br />I also want to run astoria park to 59th street bridge.&nbsp; I&#39;ve done a few runs on the triborough and that&#39;s cool but a bit smelly (car fumes).<br /><br />-j

				Hm, Saturday is supposed to be clear but cold -- high of 34.&nbsp; I&#39;ve never run outside when it&#39;s been that cold, but I could give it a try.&nbsp; I do have cold weather gear.&nbsp; I won&#39;t go if it&#39;s raining or drizzling, though.
