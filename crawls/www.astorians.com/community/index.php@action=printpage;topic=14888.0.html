				Anybody hold or attend an event @ the catering hall inside the Renaissance apartment building? Seems very nice, apparently it&#039;s been around for eight years. However, there&#039;s a surprising lack of reviews anywhere on the internet.<br /><br />Thanks!

				From what I see driving by they look like they are opening soon, a steak house with a variety of dishes. Good luck to them hopefully they will accommodate well behaved under 18 year olds. The future of an establishment depends on a young clientele that will eventually bring their kids their. :mrgreen:

				I held the afterparty of my daughter&#039;s Christening there two years ago.&nbsp; <br /><br />The space was nice...much bigger than you&#039;d imagine from the outside.&nbsp; It&#039;s two levels with two large staircases on opposite sides of the space.&nbsp; They even put candles down the sides of both staircases to make it look really nice!! (of course, we asked them to take down the candles after the first few minutes since our party was full of kids; kids and let candles don&#039;t mix well).<br /><br />The service was fine.&nbsp; The food was good...not spectacular but certainly not bad.&nbsp; The prices were reasonable, but not exactly cheap (&quot;market price&quot; for lack of a better term).&nbsp; <br /><br />The main problem with them is that they have no parking facility.&nbsp; &quot;Valet&quot; parking is an extra fee; and all they do is hire an outside company to take care of the parking for you.&nbsp; So you&#039;d have to take that into consideration.<br /><br />otherwise, not a bad place to hold an event at all.&nbsp; If they do the new &quot;steakhouse&quot; right, I&#039;d definately choose them.&nbsp; But as far as steakhouses go, it&#039;s going to be tough as Christos is a great steakhouse and is not that much further away.

				Is the steakhouse open yet? I&#039;m curious as it&#039;s so close by.
