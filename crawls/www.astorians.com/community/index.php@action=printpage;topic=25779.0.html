				So, I had been very excited when the news about Single Cut Brewery made the rounds.&nbsp; &nbsp;I had some guests in town over the holidays so I decided to take them over to Single Cut.&nbsp; What a mistake.&nbsp; &nbsp;The attitude of the staff there was so better than thou that we left half filled beer glasses and walked out.&nbsp; &nbsp;The beer was not very good either which made the decision to leave that much easier.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />We all got flights of various beers.&nbsp; &nbsp;2/5 were flat, and the other 3 were just pretty much tasteless and watery.&nbsp; Not one beer had lacing.&nbsp; I should add that the bartender (if that is what you call the guy there) spilled almost every glass and just handed us a dripping wet tray of beer.&nbsp; &nbsp;the whole experience was a joke.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was like they were doing us a favor by serving us their beer.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />To top it off, we took their tour which was rather lame but the kicker was when the tourguide started knocking local breweries (Kelso in particular) and saying that they had inferior product.&nbsp; &nbsp;So unnecessary.&nbsp; &nbsp;These places should support each other not knock them.&nbsp; Kelso is far superior to Single Cut anyway.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />If you pay attention on the tour you will see that they do not use proprietary yeast like they say they do and they order hops (non-fresh, compressed pellets) as needed.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is basically a beefed up home brew operation that uses poor/cheap ingredients.&nbsp; They store their lager barrels in the hot main room when they should be in refrigeration.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />The prices for the growlers are through the roof too and work out to $4/beer.&nbsp; directly from the brewery??<br /><br /><br />We left and went to MP Taverna where they had far superior beer and friendly bartenders.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />This place does not know what they are doing or how to make beer and their customer service sucks.&nbsp; It exudes pretentiousness and...I hate to use the word but it fits...is complete hipster garbage.&nbsp; This is Queens, not Brooklyn.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				To each his own. I&#039;ve been there (too many times) and haven&#039;t had a bad experience, and I find the prices reasonable. They&#039;ve been pretty successful. Sorry to hear you had a bad time- did you bring up any of your concerns to them while you were there?

				I&#039;m not a fan of them either.&nbsp; I agree with everything Yaxpac said.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />I had a conversation with the owner (or maybe one of the owners) and he was pretty much a huge dick. <br />&nbsp;<br />I really wanted to like their beer and support them... oh well

				Interesting- those prices at Barrier are really good. I&#039;ve only had one of their beers, but liked it, and will give them a shot too.<br /><br /><br />One thing we can all agree on, I hope, is that it&#039;s a great time to be a beer fan and the fact that there are multiple breweries in the area is pretty great.

				Capt Lawrence in westchester also has really reasonable prices if you buy from the brewery.<br />&nbsp;<br />Barrier is great.&nbsp; Their daddy warbucks DIPA is gooooood. its basically a beefed up Money IPA<br />&nbsp;<br />I use beermenus also and noticed that a growler of Singlecut at Triboro is $10 cheaper than the actual brewery where the beer is made.&nbsp; &nbsp;ha

				Yes, i was referring to the &quot;Full Stack&quot; double IPA.&nbsp; &nbsp;If I walk in to Singe Cut I will pay $46 for a 64oz growler.&nbsp; I can get the same exact thing at Top Hops for $23...exactly HALF price.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I spoke to the guys at Crescent and Vine and they will NOT be moving when Fatty&#039;s does.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thankfully, all is well with Crescent and Vine staying put.&nbsp;

				I like Singlecut. Mainly because it&#039;s close, laid back and not crowded and there&#039;s no TV.<br /><br /><br />The bartenders do run a little hot and cold or come off as snobbish, but are pretty friendly once you show them you are friendly. I know that you shouldn&#039;t have to prove yourself to get good service. I&#039;m glad they are in the neighborhood. I like to support local stuff.

				I have zero interest in experimental beers like Big Alice and Single Cut does nothing more &quot;experimental&quot; then Barrier. <br /><br /><br />Experimental has nothing to do with good beer.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />What would you say about Alchemist Brewery then?&nbsp; &nbsp;They make one beer and it is widely considered the best beer in the country.&nbsp; &nbsp;Is that &quot;safe&quot; as well.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br /><br />To me, when comparing side by side...IPA to IPA Barrier is far better then Single Cut.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is not even close.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />Hey Creed...What i find laughable is this...<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxuwXczWQC0 (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxuwXczWQC0)</span><br />

				My current favorite business model is Flo the Progressive Insurance lady. Hachi Machi!<br />And in the spirit of this thread, when I first tried Singlecut at their opening I was unimpressed. The last time I went back I felt that their beers had gotten significantly better, and my impression of the brewery on whole. As far as their business model, the parts i want to know about are how they affect the overall local economy and from where they source their ingredients. That sort of stuff is important to me as a consumer. At times as important as how good their beer is.

				Was at Singlecut last night and they lowered their prices on a lot of things.<br /><br /><br />-64 oz. growler deposit is now $10 and 32 oz is $5.<br />-Cheapest beer to fill it is $14.<br />-The pretzel is now $6.
