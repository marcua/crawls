				Astoria and LIC is going through major changes and being here since 1991 I have liked many of the changes. <br />The only problem i see is that Steinway st. has not been part of it. I know that in the last 6 years Steinway has gotton more then its share of national chain stores but that is not enough. If you look at other neighborhoods in Brooklyn or forest hills the main shopping street is intergrated into the growth of the neighborhood.<br />Here in Astoria Steinway doesn&#039;t have any shops that appeal to the new people who moved here. If i have to guess I would say 24 to 30 single making over 50K a year. That customer spends alot of money on restaurants here because they have taken the next step and opened new and exciting places to eat that rival manhattan.<br />Now that there are more stores then I ever saw for rent on steinway and 4 are closing down by next month I think the change will come on the retail side of the new Astoria. The rents are still very high but they will start going down in the next 12 months when there are more vacancies and then you will have a new kind of retail in the street. <br />

				I am not between 24 and 30 (not any more) but I agree that apart from the chain stores, there isn&#039;t much to shop for on Steinway.&nbsp; The women&#039;s clothing stores are either &quot;old lady&quot; stores or stores with clothes that appeal to 15 year olds who are a size 2 (or less.)&nbsp; There is NY &amp; Company which has some passable items but not really that much.&nbsp; There are plenty of men&#039;s clothing stores, but even those - how many tacky suits does one person need.&nbsp; <br /><br />On top of this, Steinway is ugly - there is always garbage at the base of the trees, a lot of the trees are dead, and if you walk through Steinway in the AM, the garbage is everywhere.&nbsp; The Ditmars area is much more attractive, however the shops aren&#039;t much better (for women&#039;s clothing anyway.)&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve always wanted to form an urban task force where we could beautify Steinway.&nbsp; Anyone with me????

				This post made me think of things that Astoria lacks-in my opinion- and these things are easily changed! I&#039;ve lived here for about 2 years and this is what I would love to see:<br /><br />a BOOKSTORE - completely dedicated to books (honestly, even a chain would make me happy)<br />a quality butcher/fish market in the Ditmars area<br />an electronics store that is not radioshack<br /><br />Anything else?

				I think the OP brings up many good points.&nbsp; Astoria has gone through many changes in the past 10-15 years, many of them for the better (in my opinion anyway).&nbsp; However, it seems to me that Steinway has regressed during that same period.&nbsp; Sure, some large chain stores have come in, but the overall quality of what you&#039;ll find on Steinway has gone downhill.&nbsp; I remember a time when Steinway still had true mom-and-pop stores which sold quality clothing, shoes, etc., nice little boutiques and so forth with products that didn&#039;t look like they fell off the back of a truck.&nbsp; Now, most stores really just seem to be really tacky, whether they are name-brand chains, or independent.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s also noteworthy to see how many vacant stores there are on Steinway Street, and also, after a decade-plus of extraordinary growth and change for Astoria, how it&#039;s suddenly far easier to find, say, a parking space on Steinway Street.&nbsp; Honestly, the whole street also seems much less busy and crowded than it used to be even 10 years ago, and the quality of its establishments surely has something to do with it.

				The portion of Steinway street between Astoria blvd. and 28th ave has become quite the interesting section you have to admit.&nbsp; It&#039;s like a trip to Arabia.&nbsp; They have done a good job of adding real atmosphere to the street.&nbsp; It is exciting to walk in, smell and see all the amazing products, foods and people. Some of the cafes, restaurants and hooka lounges are terrific.&nbsp; <br /><br />As for the rest of the strip, in a year or so we will see some solid changes as the shops turn over.&nbsp; With the arrival of Panera, Applebees, Pizzeria Uno and Starbucks, there should be an influx of other serious outfits coming along any day now.&nbsp; Maybe those new stores will act as anchors on Steinway and then it will fill out nicely like Austin street in Forest Hills.<br /><br />Right now the strip is a pit and the Steinway BID should be ashamed of themselves.&nbsp; That and the slob citizens who treat Steinway like an open garbage dump.&nbsp; Which brings up one last point.&nbsp; I think that many of the people shopping on Steinway are not from the neighborhood and have little respect for clean streets and sidewalks.&nbsp; People are always tossing garbage out of car windows and while walking down the street.

				Sometimes the Benneton has great sales (full prices are a little much for me, though).&nbsp; It&#039;s one of the stores I really like on Steinway. And I hope Rizzo&#039;s sticks around - love their pizza!<br /><br />PP is right about the section between Astoria Blvd and 28th Street.&nbsp; It&#039;s my favorite part of the street.&nbsp; Just love it.&nbsp; The rest of Steinway for the most part is a bit grody.<br /><br />Was also really happy with my meal at Luna de Juarez, right there on Steinway and 28th.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad they&#039;re in the neighborhood and would love to see more places that are as lovely as it on the street, restaurant or not.

				&nbsp;:-(<br /><br />Yes steinway is gross in the mornings and it stinks to high hell on garbage days, and the rats that fester around the soulvaki cart spots after they&#039;re gone make you wonder, but Steinway&#039;s always had some prominent fixtures that would seem (to me) out of place elsewhere. If steinway turned into Austin street I think I&#039;d just about roll over and die. Seriously. The stores are closing because they can&#039;t afford the rents, so how can anyone expect good quality mom and pop stores when mom and pop couldn&#039;t afford to set up shop there?<br /><br />I&#039;ve spent more hours at the pool hall than I&#039;d care to admit, i got my current sneakers from there, both my sets of glasses, i smoked my first hookah at the arab community center, even my first job was on steinway. i completely agree that the quality of CLOTHING that most of the small shops offer is well, crap. but it&#039;s pretty much always been like that. and i seriously do NOT agree with the logic that since there&#039;s a new &#039;type&#039; of people moving in the stores should freakin&#039; adapt to them. Who told you to move somewhere you don&#039;t wanna shop? moreover, I find it ridiculously insulting to the people who USED to live there, when such a statement is made. Better people are moving in so there ought to be better stores set up. That&#039;s seriously what it sounds like to me. And that&#039;s just plain rude. I know I said before I&#039;d never try to stand up for the residents that have been here before the 24-30 50k+ people moved in, but I can&#039;t help it. I don&#039;t fall into that bracket and I think its wrong to assume that stuff that was here before ought to go just because the new people don&#039;t like it.

Growing up we had two toy stores (Valco and Playworld [I think that&#039;s what it was called]), there was a Lerner&#039;s shop on the corner of Steinway and 31st Avenue that had adults and kids clothing (I believe that company ultimately turned into NY &amp; Co.), there was the Wiz for electronics (and they had a great music selection downstairs), there were two independent record stores, LTR for jeans, and Yogi Lala was the head shop it was meant to be (I remember buying a black Jim Morrison jersey with the white sleeves and thinking how freakin&#039; cool I was). The crappy stores that people think are a blight on the street have only cropped up in the last 10 years or so -- these stores aren&#039;t really the &quot;stuff that was here before.&quot; <br /><br />If the stores want to succeed in this neighborhood, they will have to adapt to the changes in the neighborhood&#039;s population. A bookstore would be a great start and the PC Richard location would be a great place for a Trader Joe&#039;s or Whole Foods. You mention the &quot;the 24-30 50k+ people&quot; that have moved in, but not all of those people have just moved into the neighborhood -- some of us have been here for a long time and would love a decent place to shop again and Steinway, unfortunately, ain&#039;t it.

				By no means is astoria considered an affluent neighborhood. It is known for its seafood restaurant so you have affluent people eating here and it was discovered by the new working generation as a safe neighborhood that is very close to the city. I dont look at median salary&#039;s I am here and I see the people who move here. Those numbers you mention is for big corpration looking for new places to open up shop, this numbers take a few years to adjust

				It&#039;s really sad that Raleigh&#039;s is closing, and the owner of the store also owns the building, so I wonder what is going on and what might be going into the space.&nbsp; I hope it&#039;s not another nightclub, but would bet that it is.&nbsp; A restaurant wouldn&#039;t do poorly at that location.<br /><br />The signs imply that it&#039;s gone at the end of the month - some great suit bargains in there!

For one thing, Trader Joe&#039;s is actually inexpensive for what they sell, as far as I saw the one time I looked around the one in Union Square. Plenty of rich and non-rich people like Trader Joe&#039;s because it is a place that offers good products, and some fairly unique products, for a reasonable price. As opposed to Applebee&#039;s, which offers food that is mediocre at best and isn&#039;t even all that cheap. And yes, I went to Applebee&#039;s several times during my poor college years with my poor college friends, so I am speaking from experience. We saw it as a place to go when we felt like splurging on something more than dining hall food, and we were often disappointed. Denny&#039;s, on the other hand, was never disappointing! Neither was Arby&#039;s, Pizza Hut, or McDonald&#039;s. Neither was I disappointed when the burned out Ditmars McDonald&#039;s finally re-opened a few months back. Now I can get delicious McDonald&#039;s fries and their strange little burger if I want them, and occasionally I do.<br /><br />Also, people have often complained about not having any nice/big supermarkets in the area aside from Best Yet at 19th Avenue or Stop &amp; Shop somewhere on Northern Blvd. I wouldn&#039;t necessarily want a Trader Joe&#039;s in Astoria, but that would be why a lot of the same people who scoff at Applebee&#039;s think it would be great to have a Trader Joe&#039;s. Sort of off the main topic here, but I don&#039;t get why one would think that just because you hate one particular chain, you must hate all chains of all sorts.

				Raleigh is a classic example of the type of store that used to define Broadway and Steinway Street. <br /><br />Store after store is being turned over to clubs, 99 cent stores, banks, nail salons. Although their are still quality places, like the community in general, they are declining.<br /><br />You might talk about gentrification in Astoria, but until the retail areas reflect this, its little more than a myth. <br /><br />Poorer immigrant families, kids, and members of the Greek community (that increasingly do not live here) define the store space in our shopping &#039;mecca&#039; (and yes, I disagree with some of you - upper Steinway would be nice if it offered more choices than hookah place after hookah place.)<br /><br />Every attempt to improve the area, falls flat. Look at the new lightposts put up. The bases are open, the columns covered with LaBomba fat reduction posters, and no seems to care. <br /><br />How about those overflowing garbage cans? And the swirling papers at Steinway and Broadway? Makes for some great studies of wind tunnels - and how to feed rats.<br /><br />We all see this. The lack of interest in solving these problems speaks volumes about the people that run this community. <br /><br />The only things that the city seems to be efficient is handing out parking tickets and building more and more that just adds to traffic and congestion.

				lizluv: <br />they recently opened up a Trader Joe&#039;s in Forest Hills, you can make it there in 20-30 mins by car.&nbsp; Sure it&#039;s crowded, but nothing compared to Union Sqaure.<br /><br />I have to take a second to point out that Trader Joe&#039;s is cheaper than any other &quot;regular&quot; supermarket I&#039;ve found.&nbsp; They are their own brand so they can afford to offer higher quality/gourmet-style food at a cheaper price (like the way Staples-brand pens are cheaper than BIC pens, bad example I know).&nbsp; It appears as if it caters to rich people only because of they stock a lot of organic and exotic foods.&nbsp; This doesn&#039;t mean I would want one in the neighborhood, but I wouldn&#039;t mind.<br /><br />I think the best market in the Broadway area is definitely Bravo, it is super clean with nice employees. (as opposed to places like Associated on 31st Ave/37th St, which I&#039;m pretty sure never clean their floors, ever.)<br /><br />I have only been in Astoria for 8 months, so take that as you will: Steinway Street is just awful.&nbsp; Dirty sidewalks, dirty stores, dirty people.&nbsp; I can appreciate the idea of someone not wanting local stores pushed out by big national chain stores, but the big national chain stores are the only thing I set foot in on that strip, I know I am not alone on this.&nbsp; Of course, when it comes to food I only eat at the local restaurants.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Look Yaxpac, I went down the stairs to the train in front of El Mundo discount - I do not usually get to that part of Steinway Street.<br /><br />I looked into the store. Shoes were all over the floor. It was a pig sty. I remember what was there a few years ago. <br /><br />The fact of the matter is that Steinway did sale quality merchandise, and not too long ago. This is what people are talking about, not a past utopia that we will never see again. Quality merchandise is still widely sold today and in many shopping places that were down at the heels not too long ago. <br /><br />Why is this area (like so much of Queens) is going down while so many other areas in the city are getting better?<br /><br />Leadership.

				I have to wonder....<br /><br />So many on the board lament all these 99cent and discount stores popping up. But it takes money and profit to pay the rent. Which means these stores must be making enough to pay rent and employees. Which in turn means there must be plenty of people shopping there. Ever think the reason that places like El Mundo discount open up is because there is actually a market for that sort of store in the area? It&#039;s not like everyone in astoria is rolling in dough. There are plenty of families and immigrant families in the neighborhood. It costs a lot to raise a family in this city and discount stores like this must offer some sort of relief or offset some costs for these people. I know my (single working)mom certainly took advantage of all the discount stores in Jackson Hts when my brother and I were younger-I imagine it to be the case here in Astoria. <br />As long as the stores we have here are profitable more will pop up. If the store is awful, they won&#039;t make money and they will close. Simple as that. They aren&#039;t going to stay in business if no one is shopping there.<br /><br />And as for El Mundo...that place is ALWAYS packed when I pass by. They aren&#039;t going anywhere anytime soon. And if it means a few families can stretch a buck or two, then good for them.<br /><br />Proud discount store shopper who would have an orgasm if Jack&#039;s 99cent store opened in Astoria. Because guess what-I like to save money at these places!

				Wow -<br />I just read this blog from beginning to end.&nbsp; What a variety of opinions.&nbsp; Steinway is dirty and full of loud uncaring people who don&#039;t think twice about dumping their garbage on the street or at the base of the trees (which people mistake as a secondary garbage pail).&nbsp; I think that for all that rents are going up in Astoria and house prices are out of control, the stores that succeed on Steinway are the truest indicator of the make-up of the neighborhood - cheap 99cents stores for immigrant families that can&#039;t afford anything else (yet.)<br /><br />The fact that there is no bookstore in Astoria is probably because the area couldn&#039;t support one.&nbsp; I think the intelligence (sp) quota in Astoria is pretty low . . . but as someone who was born here . . .I can tell you that is always has been.<br /><br />It&#039;s heartbreaking to see those new lamp posts destroyed already.&nbsp; I really feel like some of the people in this neighborhood see pretty things as something to be attacked, graffittied and destroyed . . . out of jealousy????<br /><br />Who is on the Steinway BID?&nbsp; Does anyone know?&nbsp; Have they approached more national chains???&nbsp; I mean I hate the sameness of the chains as much as anyone else, but wouldn&#039;t that be better than an endless string of 99 cents shops selling plastic storage bins and plastic flowers<br /><br />

First of all, as I stated earlier I live on Steinway and myself, my boyfriend, roommate, neighbors, etc. are all well-educated American professionals who happen to live in great apartments with reasonable rent. Yes, the 99cent stores survive because people from all walks of life frequent them, not just immigrants who can&#039;t afford anything else. And speaking of immigrants - Amen to them because a good percentage of business owners in our community <em>are</em> immigrants who with perseverance are living their version of an American Dream.<br /><br />Regarding bookstores... as many previous posts would tell you people in Astoria want and would support a good bookstore and trust me there are people who are working to make it happen (myself included), but starting any business is expensive especially in today&#039;s market and takes a lot of start-up and research. Trust me - it will happen. <br /><br />You are entitled to your opinions, but I think it is sad that you feel the intelligence quota in Astoria is low. I suggest you start talking to the people you meet in our community and pay attention to the intelligence that is exhibited on this site alone - perhaps you will change your tune. Yes, there unintelligent people EVERYWHERE, how lucky we are that we are/were given better opportunities to learn than others who are/were less fortunate or supported monetarily, culturally or emotionally.

				I think there is some relevance to what 28Grand is saying, but I think it has more to do with the fickle nature of a message board.<br /><br />Some people who rarely post or rarely post inflammatory things will not be called to task to them because as a group, we are not looking for those things in their posts. <br /><br />On the other hand, others will get taken to task for things that some wouldn&#039;t because they are perceived by the board as a group to be of a certain mind set. It is an unfortunate occurance that happens both online and off.<br /><br />I think the issue, 28Grand, was that you could have elaborated a bit and asked the question in a less condescending manner. Using the word &quot;gems&quot; in such a way can set people off, especially without facial expressions to give cues to the nature of the comments.

				I do think that&#039;s an important distinction to make, of course: people with dirty habits, vs. people who are somehow inherently &quot;dirty&quot;. And insight from my social psych course (too long ago to remember who studied it) might be useful here - it talked about the habit of littering, and how greatly the environment, not the people in it, influences it. From what I remember, 3 different &quot;litterscapes&quot; were allowed to develop at different times on the same patch of ground: 1) a pristine, not-a-scrap of litter to be found scenario; 2) an almost-pristine with one or two styrofoam cups spoiling the beauty scenario; and 3) an absolutely filthy ground littered with trash scenario. The &quot;spychologists&quot; then observed people&#039;s behavior, and found that in the middle scenario, people acted more conscientious - as if the few bits of litter spoiling the landscape jumped out at them and made them think twice about being so conspicuous themselves. Oddly, the first immaculate litterscape had more littering behavior - the conclusion being that people assume someone is maintaing the space and will clean up after them. And of course pig sty setting invites pig sty behavior. That&#039;s not to say that some people aren&#039;t always conscientious whatever situation they&#039;re in, and that other&#039;s are always litterbugs no matter how conspicuous their litter appears. It&#039;s just to add another layer, which I think is important in this Steinway discussion. Why are the surrounding streets clean, even a block away from Steinway, if the same trash-bearing people have to go through them to reach it? Why are some parts of Steinway dirtier than others? These are the kinds of questions that a BID might need to look into. <br /><br />That being said, I also agree that Steinway between 30th Ave (my stop) and Broadway is just hideous. No helpful suggestions tho ;) just a spychological observation!

I&#039;m sorry that I made you feel in need to defend yourself. <br /><br /><br /><br />The “avenue” shopping strips are doing relatively well by concentrating on what they do best: offering food, drink, and services, i.e., types of businesses that rely on foot traffic and that benefit from a steady stream of commuters on their way to and from the subway stations.<br /><br />Steinway on the other hand is a different story. It was always touted as a&nbsp; “destination” shopping strip, concentrating more on the clothing, gifts, household, etc. though I don&#039;t know how much traffic actually comes from far outside the neighborhood<br /><br />If longer-time residents are honest, it’s supposedly been in decline since forever. The “what should we do about Steinway” is one of the longest running saga in Astoria. My mother complains about the crappy shops now as she has been for the past 30 years, so I’m often left to wonder when exactly was Steinway’s heyday.<br /><br />In my opinion, the whole concept of Steinway as a shopping street needs to be rethought. It may actually be better to scale back retail, not at street level but redevelop the upper floors over the shops and turn them back into places for people to live in. <br /><br />More people living on Steinway would, I hope, mean a safer, cleaner street, better services, and perhaps a turnaround in some of the types of shops, which would allow the street to be re-integrated into the neighborhood. Just a thought<br />

And insight from my social psych course (too long ago to remember who studied it) might be useful here - it talked about the habit of littering, and how greatly the environment, not the people in it, influences it. From what I remember, 3 different &quot;litterscapes&quot; were allowed to develop at different times on the same patch of ground: 1) a pristine, not-a-scrap of litter to be found scenario; 2) an almost-pristine with one or two styrofoam cups spoiling the beauty scenario; and 3) an absolutely filthy ground littered with trash scenario. The &quot;spychologists&quot; then observed people&#039;s behavior, and found that in the middle scenario, people acted more conscientious - as if the few bits of litter spoiling the landscape jumped out at them and made them think twice about being so conspicuous themselves. Oddly, the first immaculate litterscape had more littering behavior - the conclusion being that people assume someone is maintaing the space and will clean up after them. And of course pig sty setting invites pig sty behavior. That&#039;s not to say that some people aren&#039;t always conscientious whatever situation they&#039;re in, and that other&#039;s are always litterbugs no matter how conspicuous their litter appears. It&#039;s just to add another layer, which I think is important in this Steinway discussion. Why are the surrounding streets clean, even a block away from Steinway, if the same trash-bearing people have to go through them to reach it? Why are some parts of Steinway dirtier than others? These are the kinds of questions that a BID might need to look into. <br /><br />That being said, I also agree that Steinway between 30th Ave (my stop) and Broadway is just hideous. No helpful suggestions tho ;) just a spychological observation!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wow!

				In this case I have to agree with 28Grand. People have been complaining for some time about Steinway Street. Despite this being a working class community of immigrants, it was an excellent shopping area since the building boom of the 20s and even before that, with the trolleys running down to the piano factory, the backbone for the northern part of Long Island City. <br /><br />Scheutzen Park, a beer garden like Bohemian Hall that was at Steinway and Broadway was the premier gathering place in this part of Queens - presidential candidates (like Wilson, for example) would stop by there and hold rallies at the park when running for office.<br /><br />Yes, you talk to old timers, and Steinway and Broadway was loaded with stores carrying merchandise like the type sold by Raleigh&#039;s. The furniture stores (remember Rose or Sig Stern?) were big there too.<br /><br />A number of movie theaters (and ice cream parlors) made it the entertainment location of choice for generations.<br /><br />The problem, however, is that the street has taken a sharp turn for the worse in the past decade. <br /><br />Block after block of Middle Eastern places in the north, and Spanish places in the south, although catering to their clientale, limits the broader appeal of the street, and frankly, for whatever the reason, turns off lots of people. Now you may argue the merits of such thinking, but to turn off people is a dangerous thing to do for a retail area.<br /><br />The quality of merchandise, and type of stores, has both changed sharply for the lower end at a speeded&#160; pace in the last decade or so. If someone has one the posters of Streinway Street that was done in the 80s, and compare the listing of stores then, with today&#039;s fare, it is not a pretty sight.<br /><br />Add to it the stores pumping out music, cell phones, 99 cent stores, hip hop merchandise, and rats (who is that guy at 34th Avenue that leaves a big grease spot where his cart is?) and you get a shopping experience that turns off lots of people. Again, you can argue the merits of their thinking, but a shopping area&#039;s reputation is important. I have heard from many people who spent their entire lives in this community in the past year suggest they are not going back to Steinway.<br /><br />I go back to El Mundo Discount. Yes it is crowded so it must satisfy some need. But I walk by it I keep seeing flashbacks of the Lower East Side where stores were dirty and crowded, too. Was that something good? All I can say is if it was, why did LaGuadia, a product of that evirnment, do everthing he could to clean it up?<br /><br />The point is just because people are immigrant, or poor, does not make it justified for them to shop in a pig sty. Working class communities always had Woolworths or Kresge&#039;s or Lambston. They did not look like dumps. A pig sty insults the people that shop there and the community around it.<br /><br />

To get more money they went from one lousy street fair to 2 because they get 15K per fair.<br />The biggest story was in the last meeting tony brosanman and a few of of his cohorts decided by them self&#039;s to take all the money and spend it on a lobby to get NYC to spent 6 million to beautify steinway but in the meantime there will be no security garbage pickup will be cut in half and almost everything else will be cut.<br />Many of the store renters were against it because it will effect them immediately with no guarantee of ever getting the money from the city.<br />The cherry on the cake was people asked for a vote it was declined Tony said according to the bid bylaws no vote is necessary because the board made the decision already.<br /><br />For all the people who want more national chains I ask why?<br />do you think they sell better merchandise?<br />the quality of the merchandise has nothing to do with how the store looks like and who owns it. Most national brands sell overpriced crap. Do Nike shoes that cost $7 suppose to sell for $150? does a VS bra that cost $2 to make is a bargain at $40?<br />Many of the things you buy branded made in china can be bought for a fraction of the price without the national brand attached to it and the quality is just the same.<br />Last summer i bought a VS terry suit for $12 wholesale it was selling for $140 in VS.<br />Think about it when Dell used to make billions in profits were they selling better computers? or they had better marketing? when apple sells you an ipod, is that the best mp3 player in the market? NO. Apple stock was selling for $200 recently because they sell the cheapest crap for the most money.

				When I first moved to Astoria in 1998, I shopped on Steinway much more than I do now. Quite a few of the stores I went to are now gone, not because of rents but because the companies themselves went out of business: The Wiz and that nice little housewares store come immediately to mind. I still occasionally go for shoes to Starwyn (one of the few stores that stock shoes in my size) but even they now compete for my business with Zappos (online store), who have even *more* shoes in my size. Not just the neighborhood, but the entire business of retail has changed over the past 10 years.<br /><br />I would still love to see some sort of department store or housewares that provided quality goods (not &quot;luxury&quot; thankyouvery much) but they would have to compete against the Macys&#039; and the Targets that have much bigger profit margins.

				Daisy&#039;s right. Ditmar&#039;s, or rather 31st between Ditmar&#039;s and 23rd Ave was embarrassingly filthy this morning. I didn&#039;t realize Vallone had a trash guy who cleaned up. That&#039;s great, even though I wish it was earlier than 9:30. Still, there&#039;s no reason for it to look like that in the first place.

				Last fall I had the opportunity to walk down Fifth Avenue. I marveled at the empty trash cans. Then I came upon leaf blowers pushing leaves off the sidewalk into Central Park. I little later, as I walked by the Conservancy Pond, I noticed it drained and a crew were cleaning up fallen leaves from its basin.<br /><br />Now I know that Central Park has sources of funding, but I also know that it, and certainly Fifth Avenue, receives city funds for maintenance. I thought about the filthy sidewalks and streets of Astoria.<br /><br />Have be we have become numb to dirt, trash, filth, and graffiti? The frequent holiday three day weekends consigns enormous segments of our community to mounds of trash that sit day after day because we have Monday pickups.<br /><br />Walk by buildings. How many of them are well maintained? This has always been an immigrant working class community, and until a few years ago, tidy, well kept was the norm. No longer.<br /><br />The stores (with a few exceptions) leave a great deal to be desired. Again, until recently, this was a destination of choice in shopping. No longer.<br /><br />I was in the Astoria post office the other day. A shabby disaster.<br /><br />Now I know that many of you buy into the canard that Con Ed is inept, but, like the trash pickup on Fifth Avenue, blackouts don&#039;t seem to hit &#039;nicer&#039; areas, even here in Queens (all that development in LIC for the most part skipped the blackout of 2006.)<br /><br />When we walk around the nabe, the old story of the frog in a pan of water comes to mind (you know, that as you gradually increase the heat, it eventually gets cooked)<br /><br />Is Astoria being primed for hollowing out?&#160; Comments?<br /><br />&nbsp;:|

				I see it on my block. Hardly any of the homeowners sweep their leaves, and if they do they sweep them into the street, rather than bag them. A few throw their fliers into the street too. Forget about shovelling snow! Absentee landlords can&#039;t expect their tenants to sweep and shovel snow. I would think it&#039;s bad enough they pay $1800-2,000 for a two bedroom. One of the few who is conscientious about keeping her property tidy is an elderly German lady who moved into her house in the 1930&#039;s! She&#039;s over 90, but still manages, along with her son, to sweep (and bag!) and clean in front of her house. I can&#039;t say that about her adjacent neighbors!

				Johnny4evah - So funny it happens to be an old German woman who keeps her house swept, etc.&nbsp; I was about to reply to everyone saying it was the residents of Astoria from long ago (German, Irish, Italian) who kept the neighborhood looking good but now that new groups have moved in it doesn&#039;t look so good anymore.&nbsp; But I was sure if I said this, someone would accuse me of being a racist.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry, but I just don&#039;t believe that some of the new immigrant groups that have moved into Astoria give a damn about the cleanliness of the streets, etc.&nbsp; They are probably working so hard to just make ends meet and take care of their children that they have no time to be civic minded and participate in anti-graffitti campaigns, or petition their local assemblymen to clean up Steinway.<br /><br />As I&#039;ve said before, Astoria is an area in conflict . . . house and apartment prices on the one hand are out of control, but there must be a good stock of lower priced apartments for all of these families one sees on the street who can&#039;t possibly be making much money - - - or at least don&#039;t look like they are.<br /><br />I for one would be happy to get a group of Astoria citizens together to tackle these problems - paint over graffitti, clean up Steinway, lobby major retailers to take up residence on Steinway to improve the shopping possibilities there.&nbsp; Anyone who feels the same, please speak up.<br /><br />Oh and to the person who said he/she is working on opening a bookstore . . . I&#039;d love to hear more about what is being done and lend a hand and possibly some $$$.&nbsp; I think a bookstore, with space for readings, etc. would be a great addition to not only Steinway, but Astoria in general.<br /><br />And boy do I miss Lechters - not that it was the greatest housewares store ever, but where does one go for these kinds of items more - those awful 99cents stores whose products are worse than junk?&nbsp; We&#039;re certainly not going to get a Williams Sonoma anytime soon on Steinway . . . maybe a Williams Sonoma outlet . . . .<br />

				We in Sunnyside have a big anti-graffiti campaign, and immigrants are actively involved in it.&nbsp; Some also donate money. I remember well one Indian fellow who told me that he brought his three kids to help clean because &quot;It shows them what America is all about.&quot;&nbsp; One problem that I have noticed is that they frankly don&#039;t know where to turn to start a campaign. Many don&#039;t speak English, which doesn&#039;t help the matter. But once we got the operation going boy did they turn out! <br /><br />I&#039;d be personally willing to help anyone in Astoria who wants to start an anti-graffiti campaign.&nbsp; (Notice I didn&#039;t say that I would come and do the work for them!)&nbsp; Ours began with 4 people. <br /><br />It&#039;s easy to point fingers. Believe me, I have heard every excuse for non-involvement, and as far as I am concerned they&#039;re all baloney.

				The thread started with a discussion about Steinway Street, and its fitting that Steinway get this sort of attention, because it is still the main shopping strip of Astoria, or at the very least, that&#039;s what it is known as being.<br /><br />Regarding mom-and-pop shops, which many people lament the loss of, I think that what most people seem to miss from these shops, more than anything else, is the quality of the merchandise that was sold there.&nbsp; There were truly many stores that you could compare to the boutiques that are on Austin Street (which is often used as a yardstick against which Steinway is measured on this board).&nbsp; It didn&#039;t really matter that they were not affiliated to national chains, but what matters now is that the stores that have moved in, both chain and independent, have dramatically lowered their standards and the quality of the product that they offer.&nbsp; The upkeep of many of these stores is bad, the presentation is bad, the service is often bad, and the appearance outside, from the garbage to the merchandise thrown all over the place at stores like El Mundo, really cheapens Steinway even more so than it already has been.&nbsp; Appearances count for a lot, and with many people moving to Astoria in recent years from other parts of the city and the country, let alone the immigrants that continue to move into Astoria, their first appearance of Astoria&#039;s &quot;main&quot; street is probably, quite often, not a positive one.<br /><br />Regarding the high rents, which someone brought up elsewhere in this thread: yes, there still seem to be many stores on Steinway that are able to somehow make ends meet with the high rents, and yes, that probably means that they are generating enough business to survive.&nbsp; But take a closer look.&nbsp; It seems that in recent years, more and more stores have been going out of business on Steinway Street, and many spaces have remained vacant for months, even years.&nbsp; Look at the space where Kay-Bee toys used to be.&nbsp; A nice, prime retail spot at the heart of Steinway Street, with two floors.&nbsp; Nothing has been in there for over two years, and only recently did a (you guessed it) discount store open in part of the first floor space only.&nbsp; The rest remains vacant.&nbsp; And that&#039;s not even counting the many other stores that, in recent years, seem to be cycling through different ownership, opening and closing and re-opening again as something else.&nbsp; That, to me, is not the sign of a healthy shopping district, and it&#039;s come at a time when Astoria has otherwise been booming...not just the housing boom, but truly a huge growth in many other parts of the neighborhood, with many new businesses, restaurants, etc. opening elsewhere in Astoria.&nbsp; It seems that most of Astoria, economically, has been moving in one direction, and Steinway, which is supposed to be the center of economic activity in Astoria, has been moving in the opposite direction.<br /><br />Even 10 or 15 years ago, it was much rarer to see a vacant storefront on Steinway Street, and vacancies did not stay that way for as long as they seem to in recent years, even before the recent economic crises.&nbsp; Here&#039;s another indicator that things seem to be going bad: parking.&nbsp; I recall that even a decade ago, it was almost impossible to find a parking spot on Steinway Street.&nbsp; Now, there always seems to be spaces available, at times where you would expect it not to be so easy.&nbsp; That to me is a sign that people in Astoria are taking their cars (and their business) elsewhere, and people from elsewhere are not coming to Astoria to shop.<br /><br />As far as Astoria&#039;s affluence, or lack thereof, certainly it is something that major chains look at when deciding whether a certain area is worthy of a franchise.&nbsp; But there&#039;s less affluent areas that *do* have the likes of Trader Joe&#039;s, or B&amp;N, or Borders.&nbsp; And, there has been strong growth in Astoria in the number of college-educated professionals that live in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Certainly, the area doesn&#039;t seem to have a problem supporting two Starbucks, or the many other independently owned cafes (which are not any cheaper than Starbucks in most cases!), or Best Buy, or indie organic and health food stores.&nbsp; If anything, I&#039;ve noticed that many &quot;lower-end&quot; (for lack of a better term) chains seem not to prosper in Astoria.&nbsp; Just among fast-food chains alone: KFC has closed twice on Steinway, and once on Ditmars.&nbsp; Ditto Burger King.&nbsp; Taco Bell on Steinway closed.&nbsp; Starbucks, on the other hand, seems to be thriving in Astoria.<br /><br />People keep pointing out Forest Hills.&nbsp; Personally, I think that while the numbers show that Forest Hills is a more affluent area, those numbers are skewed.&nbsp; Forest Hills does have a very affluent area, you know, with the beautiful, large old homes, the old tennis center, and so forth.&nbsp; However, much of Forest Hills is comprised of old and large apartment complexes and tenements, and features both a very high immigrant population, as well as a very high percentage of senior citizens, many of whom are presumably living on fixed incomes.&nbsp; The rest of Forest Hills, as you go south towards Metropolitan Avenue, closely resembles the residential areas of Astoria.&nbsp; So, my feeling is, if it wasn&#039;t for that wealthy region in one part of Forest Hills, you have an area that is not much different from Astoria in many other ways, including the fact that, like Astoria, it is also easily accessible by subway, and as such, has become attractive to more and more people who have moved out of Manhattan in recent years.&nbsp; And, that being the case, there&#039;s no reason why Astoria can&#039;t support the same type of stores that Forest Hills seems to have gotten (in the case of Trader Joes and B&amp;N) or has retained (in the case of the many independent boutiques and other small, &quot;quality&quot; establishments that still line Austin Street).&nbsp; Sure, rents may be expensive on Steinway, but I doubt they are any less expensive on Austin Street, and that shopping strip, compared to Steinway, is thriving.<br /><br />Actually, another thing to observe is that while Astoria&#039;s restaurant and cafe scene is quite diverse and dynamic and has really grown a lot in recent years, none of that progress has made it to Steinway Street.&nbsp; If anything, there&#039;s fewer food choices there now than there were several years ago, despite no shortage of vacant stores where a restaurant or cafe could open.&nbsp; At least some old establishments, like Rizzo&#039;s or Villa Gaudio (okay, that&#039;s right off of Steinway) are managing to hang on.&nbsp; But this is another area where the growth and development of Astoria is not reflected in the main shopping street of Astoria.&nbsp; <br /><br />Before anyone points out the Middle Eastern places on Steinway north of 28th avenue, allow me to point out that the shopping strip on Steinway has always been centered between 28th and 34th avenues, and especially between 30th Avenue and Broadway.&nbsp; Anything north of 28th and south of 35th has really been the periphery, as far as Steinway is concerned.&nbsp; I&#039;m not taking away from the importance of those areas, especially now, but I&#039;m just trying to keep the discussion focused on the central part of Steinway Street, which is what I think most people have on their mind when they discuss or debate Steinway&#039;s decline.<br /><br />So, when pointing out the many problems that seem to exist on Steinway Street and the many changes for the worse that it has taken, I think it&#039;s unfair to blame &quot;dirty&quot; immigrants, because Astoria has always been a community that has seen a great influx of immigrants, from the Germans and the Irish way back, to the Greeks and the Italians, to the Bangladeshis, Pakistanis, Hispanics/Latin Americans and Eastern Europeans that are coming to Astoria today, not to mention the increasing number of folks from elsewhere in the United States that now reside in New York and call Astoria their home.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think it&#039;s also unfair to shrug off any talk of a decline on Steinway Street on some sort of misguided feelings of nostalgia that some people may be having.&nbsp; I think that there&#039;s many valid points to be made about the direction that Steinway Street has gone towards, in relation to the rest of the neighborhood, and it&#039;s better to debate those points on face value rather than to dismiss them.<br /><br />Finally, to simplify the argument into a debate as to whether one supports chain establishments or not is also misguided, in my view.&nbsp; I think that taking a &quot;you&#039;re with us or against us&quot; type of view of chains is wrong, because, simply put, there&#039;s levels of quality when it comes to chain establishments.&nbsp; If someone doesn&#039;t like Applebee&#039;s for their mediocre, pre-packaged food, that doesn&#039;t mean that they should automatically hate Trader Joe&#039;s, for instance.&nbsp; If anything, I don&#039;t feel that most chain establishments on Steinway are part of the problem, and that&#039;s even though I&#039;m not a big fan of most of them personally.&nbsp; I feel that what cheapens the look of Steinway is the overall *bad* quality of stores, which is a combination of some really bad independent stores (so, no, there is no blind love for &quot;mom-and-pop&quot; stores here, quality still matters), along with the realization that there are many *voids* in Astoria, while subsequently, there are many vacancies on Steinway Street that offer opportunities for those voids to be filled.&nbsp; Though, I will say, that on the topic of chain stores, some of Astoria&#039;s existing offerings are still mediocre compared to those same stores elsewhere.&nbsp; The Gap on Steinway, even after its recent renovation, is tiny compared to the Gap on Austin Street.&nbsp; Express on Steinway only has women&#039;s clothing, but no Express Men, whereas I&#039;ve always seen the two together at every other Express I&#039;ve seen in Queens or elsewhere.&nbsp; So yes, the quality, overall, is lower, but it&#039;s a simplification to just blame it all on too many chains, or not enough chains, or so forth.<br /><br />

				It started with a few people in a homeowners&#039; group, who decided to clean up 2 blocks of Skillman Av. Interest in the project mushroomed, and pretty soon it was covering most of Sunnyside. If you can make the effort part of an existing organization, that would be easier than starting from the bottom up. <br /><br />To get started, I suggest getting a small core of people - a half dozen or so. Scout out an area in which graffiti is a problem, but not something unmanageable. I suggest a few blocks of a merchant strip. <br /><br />There are several government agencies that will help out.&nbsp; The Mayor&#039;s Anti-Graffiti Task Force was really helpful to us, as was the Post Office&#039;s Adopt a Mailbox program. <br /><br />I have an idea.&nbsp; Go to www.sunnysideunited.com (http://www.sunnysideunited.com). Send an e-mail to their contact address.&nbsp; I&#039;ll see to it that somebody gets in touch with you. <br /><br />

				Squirrel, how do you guys deal with graffiti in generally inaccessible/non-public areas, like on rooftops? One of the problems here is that the N train runs above ground all the way down 31st Street, so people are spraying all the rooftops they can manage to get up to all the way down the line, for maximum visibility and longevity. I know the 7 is above ground by you, so did you guys have this problem?

				Actually, we stayed away from roof tops, not only because of their inaccessibility but because of the risk of injury.&nbsp; Keep in mind we&#039;re an all-volunteer outfit with a small budget. <br /><br />I suggest starting with easier targets, like walls, store gates and mailboxes. Although mailboxes are not the biggest targets in the world, vandals love to tag them, and they are highly visible. <br /><br />The Post Office has a great program called &quot;Adopt a Mailbox.&quot; They give you the paint and brushes; you supply the elbow grease. It&#039;s a great way to get started, and the small size of the mailboxes makes them good for kids and seniors. Only use regulation postal paint on mailboxes. <br /><br />SUNN is always ready to discuss its experiences. E-mail them info@sunnysideunited.com<br /><br />

				See, my main problem is with the rooftop graffiti. I actually don&#039;t think the graffiti is nearly as bad on the ground, though obviously there is some, and the &quot;adopt a mailbox&quot; thing is a good idea that I might look into. But it&#039;s the ridiculous amount of rooftop/construction yard graffiti that bothers me most, since no one seems to be doing anything about it and it sticks out so much. Also I&#039;m concerned as a resident to know that random A-holes are running around on everyone&#039;s roof, vandalizing things. These could be the same people breaking in through the fire escapes.<br /><br />As you mentioned, it isn&#039;t reasonable for a small volunteer group to attempt to clean up the graffiti in such cases. Any ideas on how this can be dealt with?

				Can you photograph the graffiti? We found that a very effective way to pressure property owners into cleaning up is to send them a &quot;photo letter.&quot; Here&#039;s what we do:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; We take a digital picture.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; We write a formal letter, and print the picture directly onto the document. We don&#039;t attach a photo, which could get lost, and can&#039;t be faxed or scanned so easily.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; In the case of a business, we look up an upper-level manager&#039;s name, and address it to them.&nbsp; Not to the CEO, but some regional VP or whomever. <br /><br />4.&nbsp; We print the letter on a good quality color printer and send it. <br /><br />This worked very well on several occasions, including with a GM dealership. It&#039;s especially effective with big business chains.&nbsp; Often senior officials in a company have no idea that their local branches are covered with graffiti, and when they find out that local management has allowed it, boy do they get mad! <br /><br />With smaller properties, just look up the owner and send it to them. Always try and get a name. That shows that you are resourceful, and you know with whom you are dealing. <br /><br />Hope this helps.

				I think it’s agreed that everyone would like to see Steinway spruced up but to complain how “horrible” it is -- is nonsense. Some see “horrible” as not being able to buy a book and others see “horrible” as not being able to shop at the stores that once existed. “Horrible” in my mind would be empty storefronts, burned-out buildings, and crime-ridden – it’s all about perspective.<br /><br />Yes, Steinway <strong>should</strong> be cleaner. Yes, newer stores <strong>would</strong> be welcome but it appears that most storefronts are rented and in business. Just because one may not frequent some of the stores, or that they appear to cater to a particular customer, does not make the business they transact any less valid.<br /><br />Appearances do matter. In terms of cleanliness of the street, it’s more than apparent that Steinway is lacking. But in terms of general atmosphere, for lack of a better word, I don’t really care if Steinway put off new-comers because it puts off longer-term residents as well. If a newcomer can’t look beyond Steinway to see what great things the neighborhood offers then I’m sorry, they should consider living somewhere else.<br /><br />It occurs to me that the perception of who lives in Astoria and how they identify themselves is the crux of the matter. <br /><br />The price of real estate cannot be the sole indicator to determine the “type” of person who lives here. A 600-700K house was worth 250-350K ten years ago. I doubt very much the people living in them saw their salaries increase by as much, so as a measure of affluence, price of real estate is limited indicator. <br /><br />Astoria is changing but it’s not yet entirely changed. We still don’t know what the area will become. I am concerned that it’s becoming a place where people come and stay to a place where people come and stay for a couple of years. <br /><br />No offense to those who don’t intend to live here long-term, but the percentage of short-term as compared to long-term residents matters in regard to community stability. And I agree with a previous poster that it seems that LLs no longer care who they rent to -- both residentially and commercially.<br /><br />Our newest immigrant group, may be college-educated, many with advanced degrees, but they are also younger, have the debt that goes along with those degrees, and do not necessarily work in jobs that pay all that well. Not everyone works on Wall Street or the finance industry.<br /><br />What bothers me is that in the criticism of Astoria shopping in general, Steinway in particular, there appears to be a hint of elitism and snobbery that I find disturbing (and I admit that I may be a tad oversensitive).<br /><br />To me, there seems to be an attitude, which I think is becoming more prevalent, that if something you desire is not within 5 minutes or 1.5 blocks of your apartment you somehow live in a ghetto.<br /><br />And why is it that some retail chains are “good” and some are “bad”? It often seems to me that the criticism here and elsewhere has less to do about the quality of product offered and more to do with the type of people who buy those products.<br /><br /><br />I often point to Forest Hills as an area considered more affluent because it’s more reasonable than comparing Astoria to the Upper East Side or brownstone Brooklyn, which really, are on another planet.<br />&nbsp;<br />“Immigrant” Forest Hills is a relatively new phenomenom with many people moving in from the former Soviet republics in the 90s after the Iron Curtain fell. In my memory, Forest Hills always had the reputation of being upscale but maybe it&#039;s just my perception.<br /><br />The biggest difference to me between Astoria and Steinway and Forest Hills and Austin Street, is that Austin Street had a driving force, property owner and developer Heskel Elias, who specifically set out to re-make the shopping street. It was Elias who brought in more up-scale stores, including chains, and restaurants, starting as far back as the early 80s. Manhattan-based developers followed. <br /><br />Steinway has no equivalent “angel” (or “devil” depending on your perspective). I suppose the BID was expected to provide some sort of leadership in this area but as we can all see they haven’t been doing a great job at it.<br />

Some see “horrible” as not being able to buy a book and others see “horrible” as not being able to shop at the stores that once existed. “Horrible” in my mind would be empty storefronts, burned-out buildings, and crime-ridden – it’s all about perspective.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The argument here is less that Steinway is &quot;horrible&quot; and more that it is far worse than it used to be.&nbsp; Twisting things around doesn&#039;t really help matters.&nbsp; Sure, Steinway is far better than the abandoned Main Streets across America, or a burned-out, crime-ridden &quot;ghetto&quot; area, but I think some of the things I pointed out: the declining quality of the businesses, less and less shoppers on Steinway, an increasing number of vacant storefronts, etc. all are negative indicators of Steinway&#039;s health as a shopping strip.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Yes, Steinway <strong>should</strong> be cleaner. Yes, newer stores <strong>would</strong> be welcome but it appears that most storefronts are rented and in business. Just because one may not frequent some of the stores, or that they appear to cater to a particular customer, does not make the business they transact any less valid.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Again, I feel you&#039;re twisting the argument around.&nbsp; Yes, &quot;most&quot; storefronts are rented.&nbsp; But the amount of storefronts that are not rented seems to be growing by the year.&nbsp; I don&#039;t recall many vacant storefronts on Steinway street in the late 80s or early 90s (when the national economy, like today, was not doing tremendously well), but recently, I was able to count 12 vacancies on both sides of one block.&nbsp; And that doesn&#039;t include the recent alarming increase in stores that open for a few months and then go out of business.&nbsp; The businesses that are there may not be &quot;less valid&quot; but &quot;valid&quot; and &quot;quality&quot; are two very different things.&nbsp; A newstand is just as valid as a B&amp;N, for example, but a Steinway full of newstands, for example, wouldn&#039;t offer much in the way of quality shopping.&nbsp; Just using that as an extreme example.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Appearances do matter. In terms of cleanliness of the street, it’s more than apparent that Steinway is lacking. But in terms of general atmosphere, for lack of a better word, I don’t really care if Steinway put off new-comers because it puts off longer-term residents as well. If a newcomer can’t look beyond Steinway to see what great things the neighborhood offers then I’m sorry, they should consider living somewhere else.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And I think I made it fairly clear that it puts off longer-time residents too.&nbsp; I was born and raised in Astoria, so I think I qualify as a &quot;longer-term&quot; resident.&nbsp; The same things that turn off the newer resident will likely turn off the older resident, except perhaps with the exception that the older resident may be more &quot;used&quot; to shopping on Steinway street and as such may put up with a bit more to stay in the neighborhood they&#039;re used to.&nbsp; But, by judging from the fact that there seems to be less crowds and less people on Steinway than I can ever remember in the past, it seems that Astoria residents, whether they have been here a long-time or not, are beginning to abandon Steinway.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Our newest immigrant group, may be college-educated, many with advanced degrees, but they are also younger, have the debt that goes along with those degrees, and do not necessarily work in jobs that pay all that well.

In my memory, Forest Hills always had the reputation of being upscale but maybe it&#039;s just my perception.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, it is a more reasonable comparison to make.&nbsp; However, I don&#039;t feel that Forest Hills is that far better off than Astoria at this point.&nbsp; Yes, it has had (and still does to a large extent) the reputation of being upscale, but that&#039;s largely due to the part of Forest Hills that truly does have big homes and wealthy residents.&nbsp; But that&#039;s not all of Forest Hills.&nbsp; The huge tenements and old apartment buildings lining Queens Blvd. on either side are also part of Forest Hills, and Forest Hills continues south towards Metropolitan Ave., and if you go to that area, I don&#039;t think you will find it to be much different from Astoria at all economically....densely populated two and three family homes, working and lower middle class people along with urban professionals.&nbsp; And, to be quite honest, it&#039;s those residents that are in majority, not the small minority of wealthy folks who also live in Forest Hills.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The biggest difference to me between Astoria and Steinway and Forest Hills and Austin Street, is that Austin Street had a driving force, property owner and developer Heskel Elias, who specifically set out to re-make the shopping street. It was Elias who brought in more up-scale stores, including chains, and restaurants, starting as far back as the early 80s. Manhattan-based developers followed. <br /><br />Steinway has no equivalent “angel” (or “devil” depending on your perspective). I suppose the BID was expected to provide some sort of leadership in this area but as we can all see they haven’t been doing a great job at it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Here our views begin to converge.&nbsp; It is clear that the BID is not being an effective &quot;driving force&quot; to attract better business and investment to the area, whether it is chains or just better independently owned businesses.

				Neo -- I wasn&#039;t trying to rebuke your posting and I&#039;m sorry if it came across as such. I was trying to make a&nbsp; general comment about what Astoria is and who Astorians are then about what it might or could be because not everyone has the same perception and &quot;reality&quot; depends the individual.<br /><br />It wasn&#039;t my intention to say you labelled Steinway as &quot;horrible,&quot; in fact I thought in your previous post you provided an even-handed evaluation of the current situation on the street, much of which I agree with. But you can see in this thread and many others regarding retail, stores, restaurants in Astoria that other people exaggerate and in other threads the word ghetto has been bandied about many times and all too casually -- at least it so seems to me.<br /><br />I was simply trying to frame the argument from a different perspective. It&#039;s often chains vs. independents or mainstream vs. &quot;ethnic&quot; when in fact it could be the stores we currently have and empty storefronts. As a longer term resident you know that was a real possibility at one time in this city and not all neigborhoods fared as well as Astoria has over the years.

				also, i just wanted to add that i think neo11&#039;s points in this thread have been spot-on. i&#039;ve lived in astoria for nearly six years and steinway&#039;s experienced a notable decline since even then -- the number of vacated storefronts is definitely higher than ever, and it&#039;s also a lot dirtier now. (also, i didn&#039;t realize that the kay-bee space was partially rented out. not good.) but shouldn&#039;t the landlords be more culpable here? why are they allowed to rent to, and profit from, businesses that don&#039;t care about the overall quality of life on the street without being cited in some way?&nbsp;

Growing up we had two toy stores (Valco and Playworld [I think that&#039;s what it was called]), there was a Lerner&#039;s shop on the corner of Steinway and 31st Avenue that had adults and kids clothing (I believe that company ultimately turned into NY &amp; Co.), there was the Wiz for electronics (and they had a great music selection downstairs), there were two independent record stores, LTR for jeans, and Yogi Lala was the head shop it was meant to be (I remember buying a black Jim Morrison jersey with the white sleeves and thinking how freakin&#039; cool I was). The crappy stores that people think are a blight on the street have only cropped up in the last 10 years or so -- these stores aren&#039;t really the &quot;stuff that was here before.&quot; <br /><br />If the stores want to succeed in this neighborhood, they will have to adapt to the changes in the neighborhood&#039;s population.

You mention the &quot;the 24-30 50k+ people&quot; that have moved in, but not all of those people have just moved into the neighborhood -- some of us have been here for a long time and would love a decent place to shop again and Steinway, unfortunately, ain&#039;t it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ah the good old days.

				Perhaps I am hallucinating, but I never recall Steinway Street being anything other than mediocre, at best.&nbsp; During the recession in the 70&#039;s there were many boarded up shops.&nbsp; Over the years, shops came and went.&nbsp; Let&#039;s face it, it has become increasingly difficult for Mom and Pop shops.&nbsp; If there is no &#039;big name&#039; behind them, they cannot survive.&nbsp; This is one of the major challenges.

				Steinway&#039;s decline came after they tore down the&nbsp; Triboro. That was the anchor for the strip.

				And let&#039;s not forget to mourn the &quot;First Run In Queens!&quot; porno theater.<br /><br />The arabic community appears to be anything but a ghetto. It&#039;s full of businesses (that appear to be) owned by the local community. One space or another seems to be under renovation all the time.&nbsp; Certainly an improvement over the moribund businesses and seedy bars there in the 1980s. <br /><br />(But it is a damn shame that the hardware store up there went away. It was the best in the neighborhood.)<br /><br />I think Steinway from N. Blvd to 30th is doomed by geography. It would take some ambitious creative development -- trees, maybe some curves or hills added to the road -- to hide the fact that it&#039;s a straight boring main-drag; divide it into chunks that feel right on a pedestrian scale.&nbsp; The avenues have trees and some contours that make them more pedestrian friendly.

				Well, to be fair, the part of Steinway between 28th Avenue and Astoria Blvd., where all the Arab places are, was never really part of the &quot;core&quot; shopping district of Steinway Street.&nbsp; What I remember is that it was basically home to various mom-and-pop type shops...a couple of Italian cafes, a couple of small clothing stores, a couple of travel agencies, a couple of salons...a mix, but really stuff that wasn&#039;t very &quot;central.&quot;&nbsp; Ditto Steinway below 34th Avenue.&nbsp; <br /><br />Steinway could definitely use some beautification, I&#039;ll agree.&nbsp; Maybe a brick sidewalk, more trees and shrubs, regulations over the types of signage that businesses can put up towards something that&#039;s more aesthetically pleasing....would all do wonders.&nbsp; Unfortunately though, more pressing things for Steinway don&#039;t even seem to be happening, beautification is probably somewhere down that list.

				First thing is steinway north of 28th is not considered part of the Steinway shopping area also it was never part of the BID of steinway so its not relevant to &quot;shopping&quot; discussion. <br />Second Steinway has the core 2 blocks between 30th and broadway where all the main retail is going on, the other block north of 30th ave and south of broadway was always considered secondary and tertiary blocks and only became impotent in the last 5 years when the primary blocks became too expensive.<br />As for the assumption that steinway was never considered upscale shopping area is wrong. In the 70&#039;s and 80&#039; it was known for having 1 of the best bridal stores in new york &quot;saymals&quot; it had the number 1 selling Tahari label in new york in &quot;modesty&quot; and people came from allover to buy prom dress from &quot;top 10&quot;.<br />that is just a few samples.
