				Goldfish boy knows how to get my attention. &nbsp;<br /><br />I have a long standing obsession with hot wings, and would love to participate in a WING FEST! &nbsp;If there was a close enough cluster of stops, I think a wing crawl might be a fun time. &nbsp;(Maybe not enough establishments for that to work, but a girl can dream eh?) &nbsp;I would love to stop at various places and sample hot wings. &nbsp;<br /><br />I would be equally down for hankering down at one place and eating a shitload of wings. &nbsp;I am not aware of many wing establishments there are in Astoria though, besides McCanns and Planet Wings (Most of my Hot Wing expeditions take place in the city).<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				What about - <br />finding a place that doesn&#39;t serve food - and having the GREAT ASTORIAN WING OFF<br />there.&nbsp; Homemade (or favorite wing shop wings) - then of course we have to decide who makes the best - (and who sells the best).&nbsp; Those who don&#39;t bring wings to share will have to donate to the $ kitty to defray the costs.&nbsp; Or just buy the drinks.&nbsp; <br />

				Unfortunately the best place for wings that I know of is not in astoria but in Manhatten, Bar 89 In Soho, 89 Mercer street. They have McCanns and planet wings beat by a long shot. You can get a dozen great wings, with the best blue cheese I have ever had, plus criss cross fries and some vegetables like celery, carrots, radishes, and a few slices of melon for about $11.00 or you can opt for just a wing platter where its just wings.

				I&#39;ve eaten their wings twice.&nbsp; I was seriously excited when I saw they were opening, and I ended up eating there on the day they opened - I think within the first hour - so I wouldn&#39;t count those wings as indicative of what they serve.&nbsp; I&#39;m certainly willing to try them again.&nbsp; They advertise quite a few levels of hotness, and I think 24 different flavours.&nbsp; The first time I ordered, I ordered &quot;hot&quot; just to see (I like hot food).&nbsp; Well, they weren&#39;t hot.&nbsp; I ended up taking them home and bathing them in an assortment of hot sauce.&nbsp; The second time, Jim ordered, and since he didn&#39;t know I had already tried &quot;hot&quot;, he also ordered &quot;hot&quot;.&nbsp; The wings themselves were not very big, and a little dry.&nbsp; McCann&#39;s wings were much bigger and juicier.&nbsp; I do like the fact that they advertise that they use Bell &amp; Evans chicken - anyone know if that is accurate?

				I should clarify that &quot;hot&quot; wasn&#39;t the hottest level - I think there were two hotter levels, and for the hottest level, they make you taste it before you can order it.&nbsp; Or so they claim.<br /><br />Now I have to go back and find out about this Bar 89 thing.&nbsp;

				And here is the problem.&nbsp; we are going over 12 people.&nbsp; &nbsp;How should we handle this?&nbsp; <br />After speaking with bar89 yesterday, they made it clear that friday night for a group is a bad idea.<br /><br />we could switch this to monday after work around 6pm.&nbsp; that would definitely make it easier and im sure they could then handle it.&nbsp; And it would not be as crowded.<br /><br />Id rather switch days than turn people away.

				The pour at McCann&#39;s is acceptable.&nbsp; Their Guinness by no means the best I&#39;ve ever had in NYC, but it&#39;s drinkable.&nbsp; (My ultimate standard is Ireland, but no hope of that, of course.)&nbsp; I think the only other beer I&#39;ve ever had there is the Bass, and as I recall, it&#39;s fine.&nbsp; I think they have a reasonably large selection.

				The straight chocolate was a disappointment to this chocolate fiend.&nbsp; You&#39;ve tasted my chocolate ice cream, Jonathan, so you know I like serious chocolate.&nbsp; E&amp;M&#39;s &quot;chocolate moose&quot; had a sweet, cocoa powder flavour that was mildly chocolatey.&nbsp; It&#39;s not a particularly rich ice cream, and so has a slightly harsh mouth feel.&nbsp; Meg tasted it and suggested a chocolate syrup note as well, and I agree.<br /><br />Their website describes &quot;chocolate moose&quot; as <em>Chocolate Liqueur, Cocoa and imported chocolate blended to make a distinct, rich chocolate ice cream</em>.&nbsp; I have to say I didn&#39;t detect much &quot;imported chocolate&quot;.<br /><br />It may be that their specialty lies in mixes of flavours and add-ins, but I would prefer a stronger base.<br /><br />Of course, the fun company made up for any of that.&nbsp; Oh, and the fact that it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve ever eaten ice cream outside with earmuffs on.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D
