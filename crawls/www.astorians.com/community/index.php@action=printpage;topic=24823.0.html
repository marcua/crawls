				Hi, <br /><br />My name is Tyler I see that this room would be very gay friendly. I&#039;m a 23 yr old gay male myself, I work full time as a salon manager in the city. My lease is up on July 1st and I&#039;m looking to Lower my rent by getting roommates so this place sounds great. Is the room still available? I&#039;m very fun loving, respectful, clean, quiet when I need to be, and looking for cool new people to live with and hopefully build a friendship with as well. <br /><br />Hope to hear from you soon, <br />Tyler
