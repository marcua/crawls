				did anyone else hit the street fair today? some food was missing...mozzarepas! not a one. ugh. and even the vendors, i found not to be that great. Is it because of the lateness in the season? <br />* the one good thing was that i got to check out more stuff on broadway cause i never get up there. <br />oh well....

				We thought we'd go out for a bit yesterday to explore Broadway &amp; happened to stumble on this fair. &nbsp;It was OK, but I agree the food and booths all looked the same after a block or so. &nbsp;Good news is that Cafe Valentino was open so we made our way into there for a fun afternoon with a few drinks and espresso!<br /><br />We're new to Astoria so this was our 1st street fair experience - are others typically different/better than this one was?

				i would like to think that yes, they are usually a bit better. More diversity. i must say though, for the most part-all the fairs have the same stuff, but this one didn't even have that.

				Yeah, there are some better fairs, but this one was pretty indicative of the fair fare.<br /><br />heh.<br /><br />I did get two pieces of corn! Flooz, later in the day I went <em>back</em> the fair with Jimmy! So it must have been pretty good.<br /><br />On Steinway, the fair is a lot better.
