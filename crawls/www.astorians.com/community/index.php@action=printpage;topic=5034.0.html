				I&#39;m hoping everyone out there has some great suggestions for music that works great at the gym. I need to get more active in these winter months, and find great music (with an excellent beat) is very motivating. <br /><br />Some that I have on my IPOD for the gym include:<br /><br />Live - &quot;All over you&quot;<br />Stone Temple Pilots - &quot;Big bang baby&quot;<br />BEyonce - &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; (guilty pleasure)<br />Rusted Root - Exctasy<br />Buzz Cocks - &quot;Ever fall in love&quot;<br />FAt boy slim - &quot;funk soul brother&quot;<br />Shakira - La Tortura<br />Killers - Mr. Brightside<br />Rolling Stones - Paint it Black<br />Black Eyed Peas - Pump it<br /><br /><br />I implore....share.

				I share with you the greatest workout song know to man.<br />Metallica - Fuel<br /><br />Other acceptable songs:<br />Dropkick Murphy&#39;s - Fightstarter Karaoke<br />GnR - Welcome to the Jungle<br />Led Zeppelin - Whole Lotta Love<br />Rage Against the Machine - Bulls on parade<br />Doors - Break On Through<br />Soundgarden - Spoonman<br />ACDC - You shook me all night long<br />Black Sabbath - Ironman<br />Nirvana - Smells Like Teen Spirit<br /><br /><br />But I really suggest developing a taste for Metallica.&nbsp; You can fill up a few hours with a mix of just their blood pumping music to keep you motoring on.&nbsp;

				I tend to listen to techno/electronica with no words when I work out. The fast tempos keep me going on the treadmill/elliptical. Recently, I downloaded a few podcasts for my iPod that have set BPMs (beats per minute). Some of the songs sound the same, but the beat is really what keeps my pace. I usually aim for 150-165 BPM. <br /><br />If you go to the iTunes store&gt;Podcasts&gt;Health&gt;Podrunner you will find the podcasts there.<br />

				I wish NYSC played some decent music.&nbsp; They&#39;re all about the fluffy pop which does absolutely nothing for a workout.&nbsp; <br />The gym back in college had a constant rotation of Metallica and they&#39;d play mix-cd&#39;s people brought in.&nbsp; All good metal, high-tempo, powerful music to help people get a good workout.&nbsp; <br />
