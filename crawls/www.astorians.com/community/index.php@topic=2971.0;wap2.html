			Hello Astorians<br /><br />I sadly must give up the great deal of an apartment and my roommate and I are trying to find someone (or two someones) who want the place. If you know anyone who is looking it&#39;s 2 BR/1300 a month. The lease would start October 1, but we&#39;ll both be out of the place before that, so an early move in date is possible. <br /><br />Here&#39;s our Craigslist ad: http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/abo/193917325.html<br /><br />

			Sorry, apartment is taken. Six hours from Craigslist ad to newly signed lease. It was insane.

			Haha, I was on the other side of that last summer - apartment hunting from CT. It was HORRIBLE (because everyone I interviewed with was interviewing like 15 other people too), but I was detirmined to live in Astoria. It all worked out :)
