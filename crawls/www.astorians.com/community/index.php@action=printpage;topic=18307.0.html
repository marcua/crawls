				And the burgers are good, so everyone wins.&nbsp; Besides, it&#039;s not as though this place is a chain in the true sense.&nbsp; It is a restaurant which has opened a second (and will open a third) location.&nbsp; Five Guys Burgers and Fries is more of a traditional chain.&nbsp; Although I&#039;d be happy if one of those opened here, too.&nbsp; And even if someone opens a very small restaurant here, it doesn&#039;t necessarily mean that they live in Astoria.&nbsp; And people who have opened restaurants elsewhere probably live in Astoria themselves.

				They appear to use Pat LaFrieda beef, as does Petey&#039;s (and Shake Shack, etc.).&#160; Ref. here (http://www.tinytestkitchen.com/2010/05/pat-lafrieda-burgers-at-home/) and here (http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/15/dining/reviews/15unde.html), among others.&#160; Pat LaFrieda sources most of his meat from Creekstone Farms (http://www.creekstonefarms.com/) - see this NY Mag article (http://nymag.com/restaurants/features/65124/index2.html) for a lot of info.&#160; They do use corn in their feed (http://www.creekstonefarms.com/about-more.html).&#160; There was an article (http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/dining/24beef.html) in the NY Times about Creekstone fairly recently which discusses quite a bit about Creekstone operations, farms, feed, etc.

				Just back from an excellent dinner at 5 Napkin.&nbsp; I had the veggie burger and my companion had the original burger both came with fries.&nbsp; The veggie burger is made in-house and comes on a bun with wonderfully sweet pickles, lettuce, tomato and their special sauce.&nbsp; The flavors! The textures! Fantastic!&nbsp; And my companion thought his original burger was perfect.&nbsp; We shared an ice cream sundae for desert, which was more than we needed but couldn&#039;t help ourselves.&nbsp; The service was outstanding (responsive without being overbearing, friendly without being cloying).&nbsp; Only good things to say about the decor.&nbsp; This non-meat eater looks forward to going back!

				I had dinner here last night.&nbsp; I had the turkey burger with the original 5 nap burger fixins instead of the Italian fixins it comes with.&nbsp; My sig other had the lamb burger.&nbsp; Both were really flavorful, tasty and extremely thick but at the same time well cooked and juicy.&nbsp; They were both impossible to eat with hands so the utensils (especially the steak knife) was useful.&nbsp; I can&#039;t really say either one was my utmost favorite but they were different from the other choices in Astoria and I greatly enjoyed them both.&nbsp; The fries were thin but too salty.&nbsp; <br /><br />We also ordered dessert.&nbsp; The brownie sundae was typical, not mind blowing but satisfying and not too big.&nbsp; The cheesecake was an absolute disappointment.&nbsp; It was completely sour which seemed really odd.<br /><br />They did a great job with the space with a huge bar area, lots of booths through out the edge of the restaurant and floor to ceiling windows.&nbsp; It did remind me of chain restaurants, especially the big box space and the over-coddling of the bus and wait staff but I guess I still enjoyed the ambiance and being able to spread out in a way that is difficult in city life.&nbsp; It was busy and pretty loud but there didn&#039;t seem to be much of a wait time for getting a table.&nbsp; All in all, it wasn&#039;t a bad experience and if I&#039;m in the mood for this type of burger and atmosphere, I would go back.&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				Just had their signature burger and I&#039;m amazed I haven&#039;t passed out; I&#039;m not used to eating 10 oz burgers!&nbsp; Definitely needs the knife and fork because it would be way too messy to attempt to eat this by hand.&nbsp; I will try the tuna steak one at a later date.&nbsp; Fries were good and the portion size was reasonable.&nbsp; Fortunately they do refill your soda free (the glasses are a bit small).<br /><br />I&#039;m not a fan of bread-and-butter pickles, so I won&#039;t be ordering those again.&nbsp;

				I am so so happy that 5 Napkin Burger took over this space.&nbsp; What an improvement!!&nbsp; Talk about knowing what to do with this much space!&nbsp; It&#039;s got a great decor and I love the big open bar too.&nbsp; I ordered a blackened shrimp salad with all sorts of fun fresh ingredients and it was really amazing, and wonderful on a hot summer night.&nbsp; I also got the Citrus Cooler drink which was really refreshing.&nbsp; Boyfriend got the lobster rolls which were surprising not hot and it was more of a lobster salad, which was not what he expected but he said it wasn&#039;t bad.&nbsp; Server was really friendly and nice too.&nbsp; I&#039;m so glad this went in - Cup and Bizarre were such a bad use of the space.&nbsp; 5 Napkins is ten times better :)

				Just tried 5 Napkin Burger and have nothing but good things to say.&nbsp; And that comes from someone who is still mourning the loss of Cup!&nbsp; The 2-person burger is not only huge (2 8-oz. patties) with a giant bun to match, but easily feeds 2 if not 3 people.&nbsp; Five people at our table were very full eating two of the 2-person burgers...and at $19.95 each, they were an excellent deal.&nbsp; Burgers were cooked to perfection and 5-Napkin sauce and toppings were delicious.<br /><br />Ambiance is excellent -- a very good use of the space...one warning it that the music is a bit loud but not as bad as other places I&#039;ve been.<br /><br />Overall I welcome 5 Napkin to the neighborhood and hope with the Museum of the Moving Image, Frank Sinatra School, and Studio Square beer garden all nearby they will have plenty of business.&nbsp; I imagine food service at the beer garden will take a bit of a hit.<br /><br />Does anyone know if they are open for brunch and, if so, what their brunch menu looks like?

				Last Friday a friend and I decided to splurge and patronize 5-Napkin Burger.&nbsp; The place was packed.&nbsp; We split the 10 oz. Original 5-Napkin Burger at a cost of $14.95. We ordered it Medium-Rare, and it arrived perfectly cooked and extremely delicious. We also ordered beers, which seemed pricey for the neighborhood.&nbsp; The Bear Republic Racer No. 5 I ordered cost $9.50, $3.50 more than is charged at Sunswick, one block away.&nbsp; Bravo Supermarket sells a six pack of this same beer for $10. <br /><br />Overall, it was a good time.&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br />The fact that the burger was perfectly cooked is the main reason I will return. <br />

				The Five Napkin Burger is priced at $13.95 in Astoria even though the website lists the Manhattan price of $14.95.&nbsp; Also note that it does not come with lettuce and tomato as pictured.<br /><br />But I LOVE it!!!!&nbsp; Its an awesome burger if you like that style.&nbsp; Reminds me of Cozy Coffee Shop on Broadway and Astor, or Paul&#039;s Heavenly Burner on 2nd Ave between St Marks and 7th - where they cook the burgers on a flat griddle with a metal lid on top.&nbsp; I suspect Five Napkin does the same. <br /><br />Agree that the beer prices are WAY too high.&nbsp; But I love the free refills on Soda.&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:

				Screw the tweety/booko&#039;face/iphoneapp chatter. Based on the veggie burger recommendation alone, I had to give this place a shot, as I had yet to experience anything but pre-made, thawed-out patties. So we went this evening.<br /><br />Just like you guys already described: Decor was unusual and interesting; music a bit loud but liked the mix; great drink selection, if a bit pricey; service exactly as described- friendly and attentive w/o being cloying.<br /><br />Veg burger was outstanding- love the presence of beets!&nbsp; :smitten: Roll a bit dry but also flavorful. Fries were terrific- shoestring style, not too greasy, didn&#039;t leave me with a guilt trip. In fact, I didn&#039;t even add salt, which *never* happens!&nbsp; :-o Perfectly fine as they were.<br /><br />John had the inside-out burger (no bun, just a lettuce wrap) which he deemed very good. Got creamed spinach on the side, he didn&#039;t think it was as good as at Peter Luger&#039;s, but who knows what Luger&#039;s puts in their spinach. <br /><br />He had the Mother&#039;s Milk stout, like Guiness but a bit more of a kick somehow; I had the pear cider, which was too expensive for what it was, but it was nice to try something different. Shoulda tried the citrus cooler!<br /><br />Beer prices and hipster marketing nonwithstanding, we&#039;ll be back.&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />

				Question about the veg burger... have you ever had the one at Houston&#039;s/Hillstone? Kind of oatmealy with beets, a bit sweet, and very good. Wondering if the veg burger at 5 Napkin is like that. My partner is very picky about her veggie burgers and loves the one at Houston&#039;s/Hillstone. If I can convince her that it&#039;s <em>that </em> good, I may be able to get to try 5 Napkin after all!

				I really feel like I had a freakishly different experience than everyone else.<br /><br />Tuna burger - The tuna itself was high quality and well-seasoned with some soy-ginger flavors.&nbsp; It was covered, front and back, with giant slabs of mayo (uh, wasabi aioli?&nbsp; tasted like mayo to me).&nbsp; That was it - a hunk of tuna, a bun, and a giant slab of mayo.&nbsp; Once I took the mayo off, I had a dry tuna sandwich for $14.<br /><br />Fries - Okay, maybe I have a mayo problem.&nbsp; But that doesn&#039;t excuse the fries: these tasted like McDonald&#039;s fries to me.&nbsp; Now, there&#039;s nothing wrong with McDonald&#039;s fries flavor-wise.&nbsp; But after eating the fries at Tournesol, Bistro 33, Sparrow, Bareburger, Bistro Les Minots, and about 20 other places in Astoria (not to mention Manhattan), McDonald&#039;s fries don&#039;t really cut it for me anymore.&nbsp; And at these prices?&nbsp; <br /><br />Turkey Burger - My wife wanted a turkey burger, but without the cheese and sauce (the turkey burger is dressed as &quot;Italian&quot; with Mozz and tomato sauce....quite odd).&nbsp; The server was extremely confused and (I&#039;m not joking) went beyond gruff when she attempted to order.&nbsp; Now - she wasn&#039;t making additions, she was just asking for no cheese and no sauce.&nbsp; It literally took over a minute to explain this, and the server was almost aggressively dumbfounded about an incredibly simple order.&nbsp; Perhaps one reason for this: the turkey burger was seasoned &quot;italian-style&quot; (I tasted tons of oregano) so I assume either the patties or the ground turkey are prepped or seasoned in advance.&nbsp; Again...at this price point?&nbsp; Oh, and it was also covered in mayo (I forgot what they called the turkey burger mayo on the menu....but it tasted pretty similar to the infamous &#039;wasabi aioli&quot; - Hellmanns).&nbsp; Admittedly, if you like Italian-seasoned ground turkey this would probably be a big success, but if you don&#039;t, you are out of luck with the turkey burger.<br /><br />To sum up.&nbsp; Gruff service that verged on aggressive.&nbsp; McDonald&#039;s fries at literally 4-5 times the price.&nbsp; Everything covered in mayo.<br /><br />Did I just have a bad experience?&nbsp; I&#039;m not getting the love for this place at all.

				We ordered the wing appetizer.&nbsp; Really great sauce, hot, but not too hot, with an interesting flavor.&nbsp; They were reasonably meaty and moist.&nbsp; My boyfriend (that takes my leftover bones, chomps them to eat out the marrow) remarked that their only downfall was the not so plentiful marrow inside.&nbsp; I don&#039;t eat marrow so I don&#039;t know.<br /><br />He had the original (I think it&#039;s called) which he loved.&nbsp; He said it was cooked perfectly and he&#039;s a culinary grad, if that holds more weight to it for any of you&nbsp; :wink:.&nbsp; I had the turkey burger.&nbsp; It was moist and tasted wonderful with great seasonings.&nbsp; I think it was rosemary aioli that was on it.&nbsp; He liked it too.&nbsp; The fries were fries.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t say they are like McDonalds, they are better than that.&nbsp; I would&#039;ve just liked to have seen thicker fries at a place like this.&nbsp; But who cares, they are just fries.

				I think the solution for non-mayo lovers like me is to just ask for the sauce on the side.&nbsp; Then you can taste it on your own and decide how much you want on your own burger, sandwich, etc.

				I thought I&#039;d give my two cents on this as well.&nbsp; A lot of this has already been said, but what the heck.<br /><br />Went last night with my wife.&nbsp; I had the classic burger and she had the Italian turkey burger.&nbsp; Both were very good.&nbsp; My burger was perfectly cooked (medium rare) and very flavorful.&nbsp; I wiped off a lot of the mayo sauce.&nbsp; It was tasty, but there was just too much on it.&nbsp; The caramelized onions were awesome.&nbsp; Just sweet enough without being overbearing.&nbsp; Overall the toppings did a great job of complimenting the meat without hiding the burger&#039;s flavor.&nbsp; I did put a little salt on the burger, but that&#039;s just me wanting to boost the flavor a bit.&nbsp; The one downside of the burger was the bun.&nbsp; I think the bun is a bit too big and not quite soft enough.&nbsp; For me, a bun is a delivery method and shouldn&#039;t require too much attention.<br /><br />My wife&#039;s turkey burger was good.&nbsp; I only had one bite and it was very flavorful.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a fan of the toppings that come on it, but she was very pleased.<br /><br />The fries have been somewhat controversial here.&nbsp; I personally love this type of fry (McDonald&#039;s style).&nbsp; My wife&#039;s were a bit more well done than mine, and she was kind enough to swap with me - I like crispy fries.<br /><br />We drank only water as the beer was more expensive than I would have liked (and I already had a headache).&nbsp; Speaking of headaches, I was really worried reading about the music volume...it was louder than your average restaurant, but not nearly as bad as I had feared.&nbsp; Any bar would have been far worse.<br /><br />In all, 2 burgers and tap water came to $35 with tip.&nbsp; More than I&#039;d like to spend on a hamburger meal, but if you think of it as a nicer meal than your average burger, then it&#039;s not too bad.<br /><br />One thing I&#039;d like is for them to add outdoor seating.&nbsp; They said they are considering it for the fall.&nbsp; Said it&#039;s too warm outside right now (though last night was perfect out) and that the permit takes a while to get.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure the latter is the major reason.<br /><br />Overall...the service was fantastic, the food was very good, and I&#039;m pleased that this is in the neighborhood.&nbsp; It won&#039;t be an every day spot, but it will enter the regular rotation.<br /><br /><br />

				Had to find this topic because I finally went to 5 Napkin last Friday night after wanting to for months.&nbsp; They must have tweaked the menu some because both the girlfriend and I got the original and it was $10.95 with no sides.&nbsp; This was good actually because we were able to share an order of fries rather than each getting our own.<br /><br />The burger I have to say may be the best burger I have ever had and with the high expectations I had going in really made me happy.&nbsp; Mine was cooked medium.&nbsp; I literally had to stop eating after the first bite and compose myself.&nbsp; Also, I ate my burger with my hands.&nbsp; What does that say about me?&nbsp; :-D&nbsp; We had the Tuscan fries (parmesan and herbs) which were good, not outstanding.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to try their sweet potato fries next time.&nbsp; We also each had a wheat beer (forgot which one) which was only $5.50 which is actually cheaper than most places I go that charge no less than $6 for a draft.&nbsp; Our total cost with tax/tip was $48 which for a high quality burger and a drink seemed reasonable even in Astoria.&nbsp; Will definitely be back.<br /><br />Oh and my girlfriend noticed at a table behind me a guy was eating the burger for 2 himself and he had a date with him.&nbsp; We didn&#039;t stay long enough to see if he finished it.&nbsp;

				Had the&nbsp; &quot;burger for 2&quot; myself and expected alot more both in taste and size for a $25 burger.&nbsp; Ended up washing it down pretty quickly along with the $15 belgium beer that the bartendar recommended...
