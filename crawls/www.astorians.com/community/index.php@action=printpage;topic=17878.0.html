				Are the buffalo wings czech?

They may want to revisit&nbsp; mayoral succession and if there is a need for public advocate. If the advocate office remains, it should have more autonomy from the mayor&#039;s office.<br /><br />When was the last time there was a vacancy of the mayor&#039;s office?<br /><br /><br />For the LP, it looks like John Clifton of Queens may run again for US Senate.<br />We may have a statewide candidate for attorney general. They may have a candidate for Assembly in another district.<br /><br /><br />How many signatures do the Dems and GOP require?<br /><br />For independents like Libertarian, Green, etc, it apprears that the min signatures needed is 3000 for NY Senate. Others would collect theirs sooner, but indie candidates look to be starting this year July 9.<br />Thank you to all those who help give us more choices this election, to have more reason to vote on election day.<br /><br />Much appreciated. <br />&nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br />Surprised to hear one libertarian may be working with the Census.

				<br />In a few weeks, Libertarians will have a new national Chair, and I am curious to see what direction that might mean for the party.<br /><br />Here, the LPNY has an endorsed slate of candidates that will petition this summer again for ballot access.<br />It may not be certain but the expected Dem and GOP candidates would be Cuomo &amp; Lazio. The IP, CP, and WFP would follow those leads.<br /><br />I certainly hope and expect there will be more than the 2 choices.

				<br /><br />Simply, the Queens Libertarians <span class="bbc_u">usually </span> meet at Bohemian, a meeting room, the 2nd Saturday of the month at 11am.<br />Depending on the date and topic, I sometimes make it, but somewhat rarely.<br /><br />I do think the discussions are views that most voters rarely hear.

				<br />The LP may consider endorsing a Republican challenger against Maloney. If you have <span class="bbc_u">any familiarity </span> with the GOP candidates ??&nbsp; &nbsp;:?, I would greatly welcome your thoughts. More often now, the Queens LP looks at cross endorsing. I would prefer that they look carefully at the candidates and generally withhold endorsements. But quite a few are very disturbed with the incumbents in DC.<br /><br />I take it many of the NY and especially younger GOP are more freedom oriented.<br />I would find it interesting if the soft L Queens endorsed where the harder L Manhattan might not.

				<br />It appears Dino is the presumed GOP candidate. I expect that at least he would be petitioning. He is expected to meet with some Party activists Sunday in Manhattan.<br /><br />Libertarians in Manhattan will meet June 14 and perhaps they too will consider Dino among others and decide whether to support and endorse for CD14.<br />I know at least some have meaningful disagreements with the the candidate&#039;s platform.<br /><br />Often, the GOP is more tolerant of federal intervention and spending.<br /><br />http://www.dinoforcongress.com/Campaignnews.html<br /><br />(Tanners for Dino?)

				Thanks FZ. I appreciate that.<br />Would like to see more welcome signs. I take it taking your car for a ride is out of the question.<br /><br />More seriously, immigration is a complicated issue with tensions for all parties including the LP. My view is that a party supporting individuals and the smallest minorities should be advancing increased immigration rights. Congress still has much work that they seem to be avoiding (perhaps understandably).<br /><br />I would suggest that voters should consider the offices considered, whether federal, state, or local. I can more easily advocate forward positions for a body like Council, Assembly, or Congress where there are debates for and against. It is more tricky for someone running for President or an executive office.<br /><br />Not all candidates will agree.

				<br />Reasonableness, and a sense of humor. That is a mighty combination.<br />And doesnt it always come down to AH.<br /><br />QMC, if you havent said elsewhere, have you served in the military? Overseas? Thanks.<br /><br />I think you are quite wrong in the case of 4. But 3 was the most interesting response.<br />5 was a bit silly, it probably goes more to what is the war and where is it, how do you determine if the strategy is making progress<br />What is the longest war in American history?<br /><br /><br />Yes, we know personally members of the military who have asked to return to the war theater time and time again.<br />However, I believe many would love to have a strong defense and the return of our troops.<br /><br />If you believe we need to have our military over there year in and year out, there are expected choices on the ballot.<br /><br /><br />Whatever your views, would you agree that <strong>voters deserve a choice</strong>? Should we not have candidates asking whether our efforts are truly in the national interest?<br />&nbsp;If the only choice is an R and a D, then wouldnt that mean the troops remain overseas no matter.

				Hey TRX,<br /><br />What&#039;s the word on the Queens leadership?&nbsp; Been wanting to come out to a meeting but forget to put in on my calendar.&nbsp; Perhaps in March.<br /><br />I saw a blogpost somewhere saying that Tom Stevens and John Procida, who are listed on the website as contacts for the Queens Chapter, were kicked out.&nbsp; But, it didn&#039;t say why?<br /><br />Any insight?<br /><br />

				<br />I&#039;d like to hear sometime about nugget life.<br /><br />The NY LP still has fewer than 3000 enrolled voters last report, and election records did not show the 50K meaningful votes. So the protest efforts continue as usual.<br /><br />Not being a primary party, it works like clubs. One may be a member supporting national efforts, or state efforts, or local county.<br />As far as I know (which is maybe not more than you), Queens Libertarians continue on as before and meet most months at Bohemian hall. <br />I will post if I find an event of special interest.<br /><br />The NY state LBT will be meeting late April on Long Island. I would expect most of the activists there to come from LI, upstate, and Manhattan.<br />2011 is an off year. 2012 is a national election. I sometimes forget that Gillibrand would be running again then.<br />The LP meets May 2012 in Vegas.<br /><br />Cheers. Hope to see you around with the season warming.

				Last weekend, some of the NY Libertarians across the state convened on Long Island.<br />Maybe I could write more later but largely there is a great deal of continuity, and the state party is largely led by activists from LI which is not uncommon.<br /><br />I enjoyed brief remarks from a newly published author, CJ Maloney. He will be speaking in Manhattan next Monday May 9. Generally dont enjoy most historic presentations. This may be about his book <br /><span class="bbc_u">Back to the Land</span><br />http://ebookstore.sony.com/ebook/c-j-maloney/back-to-the-land/_/R-400000000000000349204<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Back-Land-Arthurdale-Economic-Planning/dp/0470610638/<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In Back to the Land, author CJ Maloney tells the true story of Arthurdale, West Virginia, a town created as a &quot;pet project&quot; of the Roosevelts. Designed to be (in the words of Eleanor Roosevelt) &quot;a human experiment station&quot;, she was to create a &quot;New American&quot; citizen who would embrace a collectivist form of life. This book tells the story of what happened to the people resettled in Arthurdale and how the policies implemented there shaped America as we know it.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If the presentation is really of more interest, will see if he may be speaking at Bohemian soon this year.<br /><br />CJ Maloney (registered Dem) - &quot;Liberty is a powerful progressive force.&quot;

				<br /><br /><br />What time is it?<br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t know yet what choices Astoria may have in Nov.<br />In NY, Monday evening has a video doc on the third party campaign effort by Nolan from 2004.<br />[My expectations are low, but somewhat curious]<br /><br /><br />http://manhattanlp.org/events/ (http://manhattanlp.org/events/) <br /><br /><br />NY Libertarians from around the state are meeting in April in Manhattan. That is a ticketed fundraiser.<br />I would like to see additional speakers of interest, and a chance to meet Carla, the new natl party director. The Jan. confab was better than expected. I especially enjoyed the presentation on TSA vs civil liberties.
