			Just wanted to share an event I am organizing this Sunday called the Momo Crawl. <br /><br />A momo is a Himalayan dumpling that has an incredible presence in the Jackson Heights area. (I think Astoria is devoid of them at the moment)<br /><br /> There are currently around 30 places selling the momo here and on Sunday the 28th, most sell them individually for $1 each. We have a trolley, vintage cab, and pedicab to usher you around with dancing performances and, at the end, we vote on a winner and march the championship belt to their doorstep. There&#039;s a lot to it and it&#039;s a fun, low cost event.<br /><br />You can see more info at momocrawl.com
