				Need a good cleaning lady to come to my Astoria apt once every two weeks. Anyone have a recommendation? I&#039;ve had 1 or 2 people clean and they just cleaned around stuff and only did the places that were visible. I am looking for someone who is thorough.

				I used Miracle Maids last week for a move-in to a new place (http://www.miraclemaidscleaning.com/index.html (http://www.miraclemaidscleaning.com/index.html)) and scheduled a cleaning over the phone. The person who took the details of what I wanted (Don) was really helpful. They sent Wendy, who did a great job, was very thorough, and very nice to boot! It was about $29/hour. This is the first time I hired out a cleaning service, so I was apprehensive, but Wendy did a super job. I would definitely hire them and request her again.<br /><br />(Oh, and PM or email me if you can if you use the service, I just remembered I can get a free hour of cleaning for referring them. Yippee!)<br /><br />

				FYI - I just called Miracle Maids based on the recommendation here and found out that there is a 4 hr. minimum required with the service at $29/hr.&nbsp; Plus you have to supply all of the cleaning supplies (unless you go to a minimum of every other week service).&nbsp; I am new to the area so maybe this is the norm here, but having lived in several other states and having great service in each, this seems way over the top to me for the needs of someone living in an apartment so I hope not!

But we did hire them out for 6 hours because we were moving into a brand new apt and so it needed a lot of work, so I guess we met the minimum. We also paid $30 (or so) for them to bring all their own supplies because we had nothing in the apt. FYI, part of what you are paying for is that the maids have background checks, etc. I do imagine if you can find someone by hiring them directly, you would pay less. You could try looking on craigslist. I felt more comfortable going through a company because we needed someone on short notice to do a great job and we had no time to fool around with vetting people, etc. Good luck!<br />t

				The fee seems about right for an agency, as is having your own supplies on hand. I can&#039;t speak for individual cleaners, however, as I&#039;ve only used an agency. (White Glove, if anyone is looking for another recommendation.)

				You know what I don&#039;t get is why so many people charge by the &quot;job&quot; instead of just charging by the hour. I mean, what is the real benefit? I talk to some people who just say &quot;how many bedrooms is your apartment&quot;, it makes no sense to quote a price that way imho. I just look for someone who charges an hourly rate and can get on a schedule and come weekly - but everyone wants to charge by the &quot;job&quot; I don&#039;t get it.

				I think I can answer that one for you. People who charge by the hour can take their sweet time to get the job done. Let&#039;s say you know how long it takes you to rip through your home and get it all done. If you are paying by the hour you probably will find that your cleaning person might take twice as long. I used to pay that way. Never again. I don&#039;t care if it takes 3 hours or 7 hours. Just get it done correctly each time and I prefer to pay a flat rate. I love to see the smile on the person who cleans for me when I tell her to be out of here as fast as she canâ€”and she does. That allows her to do 3 places a day instead of only 1 or 2. I also know that each time she comes here it will cost me the same amount, even if there is a little extra to be done every now and then.<br /><br />[OT]<br />I recall many years ago when I approved a secretary that HR sent to me. They tested her typing speed at 96 WPM. They explained to her that overtime was available to her because her work would be very sensitive material and that all of it needed to be done before she left for the day. She was a nice enough person, and I knew we would work very well together. I explained to her that on any day that she worked past 6:00 PM, she would be allowed to order-in dinner and that if she was still at work until 8:00 PM I would arrange a limo to take her home. After a few weeks, it became obvious that she was working as slowly as she could to reap the overtime benefits. Her predecessor (out on maternity leave) had stayed overtime around 4 days a month. She was there every evening. <br />[/OT]
