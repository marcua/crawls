				The Washington Post put out a list of the top high schools in the United States.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://projects.washingtonpost.com/challengeindex/2007/<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what people think about rating schools, especially high schools, and/or their research method and the validity of their results, but I just love statistics and studies!&nbsp; <br /><br />Did anyone here go to any of these schools?&nbsp; I know Edina High School in Minnesota, which made the Top 100 nationally, was always considered the &quot;best of the best&quot; when I was growing up in the 80&#039;s in central Minnesota.&nbsp; That was our version of Beverly Hills 90210!

Why don&#039;t I see on the Newsweek list famous public high schools like Stuyvesant in New York City or Thomas Jefferson in Fairfax County, Va., or the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy in Aurora, Ill., or Whitney High in Cerritos, Calif.?<br /><br />We do not include any magnet or charter high school that draws such a high concentration of top students that its average SAT or ACT score significantly exceeds the highest average for any normal enrollment school in the country. This year that meant such schools had to have an average SAT score below 1300 on the reading and math sections, or an average ACT score below 27, to be included on the list. <br /><br />The schools you name are terrific places with some of the highest average test scores in the country, but it would be deceptive for us to put them on this list. The Challenge Index is designed to honor schools that have done the best job in persuading average students to take college level courses and tests. It does not work with schools that have no, or almost no, average students. The idea is to create a list that measures how good schools are in challenging all students, and not just how high their students&#039; test scores are. The high-performing schools we have excluded from the list all have great teachers, but research indicates that high SAT and ACT averages are much more an indication of the affluence of the students&#039; parents. <br /><br />Using average SAT or ACT scores is a change from the previous system we used which excluded schools that admitted more than half of their student based on grades and test scores. That system penalized some inner city magnet schools that had high Challenge Index ratings but whose average SAT or ACT scores were below those of some normal enrollment suburban schools, so we switched to a system that we consider fairer and clearer.<br /><br />We do, however, acknowledge this year on our Public Elites list the 19 schools that did not make the list because their average SAT or ACT scores were too high.&quot;<br /><br />

				I&#039;m not sure I entirely agree with their methodology as something that demonstrates conclusively how good a school is or not - which they also admit, btw (&quot;The rating is not a measurement of the overall quality of the school but illuminates one factor that many educators consider important&quot;), which makes me scratch my head a little, since their front education page (http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/education/) says &quot;top high schools&quot;.&nbsp; However, the creator of this index does say (http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/20/AR2007052001102.html),<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Readers are entitled to their own views of this rating system. The Challenge Index is journalism designed to serve readers, like the Dow Jones averages or baseball slugging percentages -- not scholarship. The adjective &quot;best&quot; always reflects different values. Your best movie may have won the most awards; mine may have sold the most tickets. In this case, I want to recognize those schools with the teachers who add the most value, even in inner-city schools where no one has yet found a way to reduce dropouts or raise test scores significantly.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think that is why the percentage of subsidised lunches is included.<br /><br />As to why Stuyvesant is not on the list - well, Astoria Luv just beat me to the post button.<br /><br />That said, there are a number of NYC schools on the list.&nbsp; It is 1000 schools, 100 per page.&nbsp; The first NYC school listed is on page 3 (http://projects.washingtonpost.com/challengeindex/2007/page3/), #351 - the High School for Arts and Business in Corona.&nbsp; There are several more on that page, including Townsend Harris and Brooklyn Tech, and others further down the list, including our own Long Island City High School (http://projects.washingtonpost.com/challengeindex/ny/queens/long-island-city/) at #930. (Yup.)

				I guess it&#039;s hard to judge, but as an alum of a school in the same vein as Illinois Math and Science or Stuyvesant (namely the North Carolina School of Science and Math - go Unicorns!), the list definitely looked off to me.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure these things are difficult to quantify, but please.<br /><br />NCSSM didn&#039;t really focus on APs, which was a big change for me from my hometown high school four hours away in western NC.&nbsp; The Science and Math attitude towards APs was - if you want to take one, go for it, but the focus in my classes was really on learning, not test-taking.&nbsp; A number of students graduated with APs, but I came out with only two (my hometown friends probably had more), yet I had tons more lab and critical thinking experience.&nbsp; I exempted a number of requirements once I got to college just by taking placement tests, but that didn&#039;t count as an AP.&nbsp; In the long run, it really made about the same difference, but seemed like time better spent to me.<br /><br />Also, all of our lunches were subsidized, and breakfast and dinner, too.&nbsp; The state of North Carolina paid for my room and board for two years... however, as we often were heard to whine at mealtime, you really did get what you paid for.&nbsp; &nbsp;:roll:&nbsp; I do remember that some of my classmates were bright students from financially struggling families, and the room and board situation was a huge bonus for their families.&nbsp; However, it applied to everyone all the same, so there really was virtually no social stigma about that kind of thing (same thing with everyone living in the dorms and no one having cars - the social footing was highly uniform).&nbsp; <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t trade the education I got for anything.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it would have worked for everyone, but it stimulated me at a time when it would have been easy to coast at my hometown school, and really prepared me to take on bigger challenges. <br /><br />So yeah, screw the Washington Post - there&#039;s more to quantifying a high school experience than IBs and free lunch.&nbsp; How do I know?&nbsp; Did I mention that one of my APs was in Statistics?&nbsp; &nbsp;:angel:

				They didn&#039;t use the percentage of subsidised lunches in the actual calculating the school position - they have just included it after the school was on the list.&nbsp; I think they wanted to demonstrate that a school&#039;s inclusion on the list is independent of the poverty or wealth of its students.

				Thomas Stone High School in Waldorf, MD was #597 last year.&nbsp; I was offered to teach math at the school, but turned it down due to its shear size (huge) and chose a job here in the city.&nbsp; This year, the school is not even on the list.&nbsp; I guess it&#039;s partly because I wasn&#039;t there!&nbsp; Now only if they listed Middle Schools...&nbsp; ;-)

				I wonder why my old high school (St. Cloud Technical) didn&#039;t make the list.&nbsp; It must have really gone down hill.&nbsp; When I went there, they had an award winning orchestra and incredible academic programs.&nbsp; Despite being really overcrowded, the school somehow maintained reasonable class sizes and the college-bound honor classes were usually ten to fifteen students in each class.&nbsp; I really enjoyed the last two years of high school there, but that&#039;s probably for a different thread&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				My alma mater, West Genessee High School in dreary Camillus, NY was not surprisingly absent from the list.&nbsp; But then, most graduates of that school know more about lacrosse than simple math.&nbsp; If you ranked all those schools based solely on lacrosse, I&#039;d have gone to a top 5 in the nation school.&nbsp; Sadly, in real life, lacrosse isn&#039;t as important as academics.
