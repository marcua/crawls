				That morning I smelled smoke in my apartment and ignored it, but I heard numerous sirens stopping outside.&nbsp; My street (31st Avenue) was blocked off with an armada of FDNY.&nbsp; It was a major scene.&nbsp; Never saw so many fire trucks in one place.&nbsp; There was even a &quot;mobile respiratory recovery truck&quot; or something along those lines; saw a firefighter on a gurney being carted into it.

				I hope everyone recovers quickly.&nbsp; Do they know what started the fire?

				I came upon the scene while out running errands -- the whole thing was pretty dramatic, and I was very relieved when they finally got it out.&nbsp; There were flames billowing up from the roof of the building at one point.&nbsp; I heard from a few people in the crowd that it was electrical, but am not sure how accurate that information was.

				I live just around the corner, and we could see the fire and smoke from our apartment.&nbsp; One of my neighbors was visiting someone in the building at the time, and he heard that it may have been caused by a curling iron left on.&nbsp; Can&#039;t verify that for sure, though.&nbsp; The FD had to cut a ventilation trench in the roof, that&#039;s how smoky it was.&nbsp; Fortunately, no one was injured other than 2 firemen treated for smoke inhalation.
