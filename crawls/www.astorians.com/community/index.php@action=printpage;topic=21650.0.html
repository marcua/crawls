				Maybe they&#039;re referring to a general ground zero, and not The Ground Zero? Maybe the sandwich is the start of a gastronomical explosion in your mouth? <br /><br />But I do agree for New Yorkers ground zero is a little tasteless.

				Now that we&#039;re seeing what&#039;s actually in these sandwiches, it&#039;s clear they are completely unrelated to their names. It makes me wonder if someone just looked at a map of New York and picked place names from it they thought sounded cool and assigned them to each sandwich, without knowing anything about any of those places. Maybe they don&#039;t even know what Ground Zero refers to. Is that possible? Either way, I still don&#039;t want to eat there.

				I wonder if they changed it yet.

				not missing anything either. I ordered from there twice (once breakfast and once for dinner) and both times I was seriously unimpressed. It was below crappy diner quality. I asked for my veggie burger wrapped in lettuce and I got a mound of &quot;veggie burger&quot; on the side (not even on top!) of 2 leaves of iceberg. Looked like they didn&#039;t even try! The omlette I got was dry and portions overall are small. Maybe dining in would be better, but I have no desire to try. Sucks b/c they had potential (other than the ground zero sandwich)
