				Saw these in the theater, but they should be on DVD by now:<br /><br />Science of Sleep<br />Volver<br />Pan&#039;s Labyrinth<br /><br />Another idea is to have your own movie festival by watching everything from a certain director, or with a certain actor/actress.&nbsp; We often do this with our Netflix, and recently we&#039;ve watched DVDs by/starring Christian Bale, Hayao Miyazaki, Winona Ryder, Pedro Almodovar.&nbsp; Netlfix is really good for doing those kinds of searches.

				I love this thread.<br /><br />Another vote for Little Miss Sunshine, and also I liked Lucky Number Slevin, The Royal Tennenbaums (does this pass the 5-yr mark yet?), In America, Jarhead, Match Point, Mean Girls, Murderball (this is a documentary-so good!), Team America World Police (America, F**K YEAH!), 40 Year Old Virgin, and some random others that I&#039;ve apparently forgotten to rate in Netflix.<br /><br />If you&#039;re into watching TV on DVD (which I am, I wait until I hear what shows are good and then watch, I&#039;m a follower, but who cares), I like Arrested Development, The L Word, Six Feet Under (again may be more than 5 yrs), Lost, and The Office.

The dialog was very lovely - I kept thinking that I would almost rather be reading it than watching it because it had a very literary sound to it. It was also very interesting visually, though, and it was a good cast. My vote would be yes, I think you would like it.

				Oh - another suggestion would be Charmed from the TV aspect. I&#039;ll admit it. It&#039;s my favorite TV show of all time. It&#039;s an indulgence of mine when I am around a television (as we don&#039;t currently have one and live happily without).

				Gotta go with Alison on murderball, i know someone who was in a wheelchair and they told me to check it out and it was a helluva good docu. Reign over Me was GREAT, as was Little miss sunshine. Spanglish was very good as well.&nbsp; If you&nbsp; havent checked out the BBC Docu PLANET EARTH , thats great as well, 28 days later, 28 weeks later is ok if you&#039;ve seen the first. If you havent yet seen ROME i suggest you get the first then the second season, one of HBO&#039;s great miniseries (along with Band of Brothers) thats all i got for right now!

				A movie which I liked alot but kind of got dumped was The New World, with christian bale, colin farrell, amongst others. The director also did The Thin Red Line, which although was about World War II, was not truly a war flick. Anyway, really good flick. Great camera work, the guys has great vision, and an excellent script. <br /><br />

				<strong>Quinceanera</strong>!!!!!!!!! Came out about a year ago. Great movie. I would watch it over and over except I dont want to get sick of it. It takes place in LA. It&#039;s about a pregnant virgin. Pretty much awesome.<br /><br />If you like foreign films, I recommend <strong>L&#039;auberge Espagnole [the Spanish Apartment]</strong> (in French/Spanish/English) and its sequel <strong>Les Poupees Russes [Russian Dolls] </strong> (in French/Russian/English). Excellent films. And while I&#039;m on the French movie thing, I&#039;ll add <strong>He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not</strong> and <strong>Lila Says</strong>. And if you like Almodovar, <strong>Volver</strong> was very good.<br /><br /><strong>Waitress</strong> was an excellent movie. Ooh and <strong>Maria Full of Grace</strong>--but that is a VERY dark movie about a Colombian drug mule...I haven&#039;t been able to forget it nor watch it again. Also <strong>The Crime of Padre Amaro</strong> is one of my favorite movies...its&#039; also very dark but it has Gael Garcia Bernal... &nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br />I hope I haven&#039;t completely wasted your time with my suggestions &nbsp;:-P :lol:

				The awful movie that I was referring to is &quot;Anchorman.&quot;&nbsp; I agree with the Christian Science Monitor reviewer: Dumb, dumber, dumberest!

				Anchorman is a movie I can watch endlessly. I&#039;m happy to disagree with the Christian Science Monitor

				I like Anchorman. Of course it&#039;s dumb; I don&#039;t think it strives to be anything else. I find it to be dumb in funny ways.
