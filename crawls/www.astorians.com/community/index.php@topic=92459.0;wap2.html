			I’m trying to find a therapist who I was seeing few months ago at Aristotles Psychological on 37st and 31ave. Her first name is Denise, she is a young talented Hispanic therapist and left that location recently. Obviously they won’t give me any information about her or how to contact her. I would really like to keep working with her, but I don’t even have a last name. If anybody have any informations please PM.[/font]<br />Thanks astorians![/font]
