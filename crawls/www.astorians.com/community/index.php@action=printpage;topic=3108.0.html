				Hey Astorians<br /><br />Q: Where can I buy a package of yummy <strong>lavash</strong> (Armenian for <em>unleavened, soft and thin flat bread</em>) with which to make turkey wraps? (Flour tortillas are gross to me in this application and traditional pita is just too thick!)<br /><br />I&#39;ve already tried looking at: Key Food, C-Town, and Trade Fair.<br /><br />Thanks!<br />annie

				I wish we had Lavash in the neighborhood - I used to use it to make Armenian sandwiches (though I haven&#39;t recently).&nbsp; If it&#39;s anywhere in Astoria it&#39;s likely to be in a specialty food store - I&#39;d try the Greek Supermarket on 31st Street, I think it&#39;s North of 30th Avenue, though I could be off on that, and maybe Mediterranean Foods on 34th Street, just South of 30th Avenue.

				There&#39;s another place on 31st St. that might have it - I think it&#39;s called simply &quot;International Foods&quot;?&nbsp; Anyway, it&#39;s south of Titan Foods, maybe a little north of 31st Ave.

				Key Food on 30th ave and 33st does have it...before it sells out that is.&nbsp; Most of their items by Toufayan sell out quickly.&nbsp; If you are facing the deli counter it is right behind you next to the case with the knishes and such.&nbsp; I think they get deliveries on Monday&#39;s and Wednesday&#39;s.<br /><br />

				AWESOME. Thanks everyone! <br /><br />Looks like I frequent the Key Food on 30th Ave on off-days or something because they seem to always be sold out. Same with the Trade Fair on Broadway. <br /><br />Thanks for the photo, thats&#39;s pretty much what I was looking for, the Toufayan brand flat bread. Unless Key Food starts stocking more than 3 packages at a time, looks like I might have to take that CA mail-order business up on their offer! <br /><br />And imagine, all this just to make a good Armenian sandwich. Damn you, sandwichlust!

				Although its a corruption of the traditional &quot;lahmahjoon&quot; (taught to me by my Armenian college roommate, freshman year), this is the best little wrap-sandwich ever! I just call it &quot;Sandwichian&quot;, or Armenian Sandwich. <br /><br />1 lb. ground lean lamb<br />1 1/2 cup yellow onion chopped fine<br />1/2 cup green bell pepper chopped fine<br />1/2 cup chopped Armenian or Italian parsley<br />1 teaspoon chopped garlic<br />1 teaspoon of fresh sweet basil chopped<br />1 tablespoon fresh mint leaves chopped<br />1/2 teaspoon ground cumin<br />1 can diced tomatoes<br />1 small can tomato paste (or 1/2 a tube)<br />Cayenne pepper to taste [optinal]<br />Salt and pepper to taste<br /><br />1) Saute up the lamb (or beef or chicken, etc although lamb is best) along with all the herbs and stuff (its not haute cuisine, just cook it until its done and smells good!)<br /><br />2) pile into a soft warm flatbread (here&#39;s where the Lavash comes in), roll up like a burrito<br /><br />3) eat and be happy<br /><br /><strong>optional: a dollop of yogurt, some Armenian cheese (feta will do) and/or a squeeze of lemon</strong><br /><em><br />I also like to stick some alfalfa sprouts in it but that&#39;s just the californian in me</em>

				Instead of the fuss and endless searching, why not just purchase lamajoun pre-made.&nbsp; There are a number of places here in Astoria that sell them.&nbsp; Titan &amp; Agora Plaze on 31st and the Greek-Italian Deli on Ditmars.&nbsp; They literally take 5 minutes to cook in a toaster over.&nbsp; Packages contain a dozen lamajouns and cost about $11-12 each.&nbsp; <br /><br />As for the &#39;Armenian Parsley&#39; thing, I have to say I&#39;m 100% Armenian-American (2nd generation American born) and this is news to me.&nbsp; In fact, I remember when I was young, we would have a lamajoun-making party when my grandmother came to visit and make what seemed like 100&#39;s of these tasty little treats, but it was always flat-leafed parsley that was used in the meat mixture.&nbsp;

				I think I found what you&#39;re talking about.&nbsp; Only 1 out of 6 cookbooks had any sort of dip using pomegranate.&nbsp; Notes for the recipe said that it was a traditional Syrian preparation.&nbsp; It was basically a mohammara dip (spicy red pepper paste &amp; ground walnuts) where they added in ground pomegranate seeds to the mix.&nbsp; Then top it off with more pomegranate seeds for garnish.&nbsp; If this sounds like what you had let me know and I&#39;ll post the full recipe.

				OK, here&#39;s the recipe as it was printed in <em>&#39;The Armenian Kitchen&#39;</em>.&nbsp; It was a done by the Ladies Guild of an Armenian church in Boston, MA.&nbsp; This recipe is a 3-day process, which would be way too much effort for a dip, in my opinion, but hope you enjoy.&nbsp; <br /><br />Syrian Mouhammara<br /><br />1/4 c. ground red pepper<br />1/2 c. lemon juice<br />1/2 c. water<br /><br />1/2 c. olive oil<br />3 tablespoon ground cumin<br />1 1/2 tablespoon sugar<br />1 1/2 teaspoon salt<br />1/2 c. water<br />2 c. coarsely ground walnuts<br />2 c. plain bread crumbs<br /><br />seeds from 1 pomegranate (divided in 1/2)<br />1 tablespoon pine nuts<br /><br />Soak ground red pepper overnight in lemon juice and water.&nbsp; Store in refrigerator.&nbsp; Next day, mix well with next 7 ingredients.&nbsp; For more vibrant color, add a teaspoon of red food coloring paste or a few drops of liquid red food coloring.&nbsp; Taste for flavor - for more spicy, add more ground red pepper or a few dashes of Tabasco sauce.&nbsp; Refrigerate overnight to blend spices and flavors.&nbsp; Next day, taste and adjust seasonings (lemon juice, salt, etc.).&nbsp; Mix in 1/2 of the pomegranate seeds.&nbsp; Spread mixture in a shallow serving platter and garnish with remaining pomegranate seeds and toasted pine nuts.&nbsp; Yield: 4 cups.&nbsp; May be frozen for short term future use.&nbsp; <br /><br />I often use this site for recipe searches and they have a few other recipes that seem to take less time.&nbsp; They don&#39;t use fresh pomegranate, but instead use pomegranate molasses or syrup.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://fooddownunder.com/cgi-bin/recipe.cgi?r=273390 (http://fooddownunder.com/cgi-bin/recipe.cgi?r=273390)<br /><br />http://fooddownunder.com/cgi-bin/recipe.cgi?r=170017 (http://fooddownunder.com/cgi-bin/recipe.cgi?r=170017)<br /><br />http://fooddownunder.com/cgi-bin/recipe.cgi?r=170018 (http://fooddownunder.com/cgi-bin/recipe.cgi?r=170018)<br /><br />http://fooddownunder.com/cgi-bin/recipe.cgi?r=267559 (http://fooddownunder.com/cgi-bin/recipe.cgi?r=267559)<br />
