				Here&#39;s a link to an article from Gotham Gazette, &quot;The Aging City&quot;.&nbsp; It gives a good overview of the reasons behind lots of the problems we Astorians know all about - power outages, stinky sewage, subway troubles - and what can be done (but probably won&#39;t be done). <br /><br />The section dealing with overflowing sewage in our area is definitely of interest. If only we could plant some more trees! <br /><br />So, read on:<br /><br />http://www.gothamgazette.com/article/issueoftheweek/20060731/200/1925

				And please do take note what the article says, fellow Astorians, do take note:<br /><br />&quot;Demand for power was soaring because of the heat but officials are saying demand was not the cause of the blackout. Consolidated Edison, the private company that operates the city&#39;s electrical system, said it had enough energy to power the city, even on sweltering weekdays. <br /><br />In fact, the mayor&#39;s Energy Policy Task Force had released a report just weeks before saying that the city would not need to increase its energy supply until 2012 (previous estimates had predicted a need for more power in 2008). <br /><br />It&#39;s not a supply problem,&quot; a Con Ed spokesperson told the Daily News. &quot;It&#39;s an isolated equipment problem.&quot; &quot;<br /><br />So it is equipment after all, hmmmmmmmmm!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />

				http://www.nyc.gov/html/om/pdf/energy_task_force.pd<br /><br />NYC Energy Policy:<br /><br />page 50: &quot;The greatest single challenge for the city&#39;s infrastructure is keeping up with load growth, particularly as it is accelerating in certain areas. This is largely the result of residential construction ... [and] will place great stain on a system already overburdened.&quot;<br /><br />I do flatly do not believe that energy supplies are ok until 2012, and do not know what basis that claim was made. I would like to see some population projections. <br /><br />Did someone say they believed it cause Con Ed said it?<br /><br />

				Jtrane,<br />Kudos again!<br /><br />As for my post, for anyone actually taking a serious interest on the 2012 energy resource claim can check out NPR and WNYC. They reported the story a week before the power outage. <br /><br />For shame, that liberal media, not checking their sources (disclaimer: i&#39;m being sarcastic)

				Well, the WNYC did discuss this. You can find it on line:<br /><br />http://www.wnyc.org/news/articles/62003<br /><br />REPORTER: But one business and labor group thinks the city doesnt have enough sense of urgency. Jerry Kremer chairs New York AREA, which stands for Affordable Reliable Electricity Alliance. He agrees theres no immediate threat of a blackout. But he says new developments are pushing the envelope.<br /><br />KREMER: When you have a new Yankee Stadium and new Shea Stadium in 2009 and you have the downtown Brooklyn facility, all of sudden with all these facilities coming on line theres going to be this hungry demand for power thats just not going to be there.<br /><br />The New York Independent System Operator seems to be the source that &quot;energy supplies will be good for the next 6 years.&quot; <br /><br />Does anyone know what population assumptions are used?<br /><br />http://www.nyiso.com/public/webdocs/newsroom/press_releases/2005/pr_nyiso_issues_rna_report_122105.pdf<br /><br />States generation resources adequate through 2007. Beginning in 2008, the Hudson Valley and south will need system reinforcements.<br /><br />http://www.nyiso.com/public/webdocs/newsroom/press_releases/2006/media_advisory_nyiso_RNA_conference_020706.pdf<br /><br />Held a conference on electric reliability a few months ago. And what conclusions did these experts find? Hope they can predict future needs better than their findings on the system&#39;s current reliability. <br />
