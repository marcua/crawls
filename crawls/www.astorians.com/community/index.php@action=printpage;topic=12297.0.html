				I met my husband at a concert at Mercury Lounge almost 7 years ago.&nbsp; I guess that could be classified as meeting at a bar. Afterwards, we headed to Motor City (bar).

				forgot about the subway - i added that to the poll.<br /><br />if I met someone at a bar I wouldn&#039;t be shy about telling most friends but i&#039;d expect a reaction from my conservative religious family and would probably find a little white lie to tell - maybe &quot;oh, we met in the neighborhood&quot; or &quot;at a party&quot;. I guess it all depends on who you are telling :)

				My boy and I met in college, dated and broke up. I moved to NYC and he came down to stay with me when he got tickets to a Red Sox/Yankees game. Old flames die hard, I guess and after a while of very casually dating between Boston and NYC, I got the sucker to move here and move in!&nbsp; :evil:

				I met hubby in our doctoral program, but I think that going to bars after had an aphrodisiac effect as well...so while we met in school, we got to know each other in bars. Yay bars!<br /><br /><br />

				We met at a Summer Sings. They&#039;re put on in the summer by a couple of choruses, and are a chance for choristers to keep in shape during the off-season.&nbsp; You pay $12-15 and get the use of a score, and there&#039;s a conductor, soloists, etc.&nbsp; They&#039;re mostly the major classical works; e.g., Handel&#039;s <em>Messiah</em>, <em>Carmina Burana</em>, etc.&nbsp; So, I guess you could say &quot;our song&quot; is the Verdi Requiem!&nbsp; :-D

				We met at a bar a bit more than 6 years ago... the only thing that I don&#039;t like about saying that we met on a bar is that it is so... 80&#039;s&nbsp; :cry:<br /><br />Mer - congrats on your engagement!!&nbsp;

I&#039;m certainly not one to judge anyway - I met my husband by moving in with him! Well, technically, we met at an interview for grad school, but he doesn&#039;t even remember it. So we decided through the school message board, after both getting in, to be roommates. Now that&#039;s a weird situation!&nbsp; :-D

				I met my husband on matchmaker.com.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was really bored at work one afternoon and I got an email from matchmaker.com for 7 days free membership.&nbsp; I was dating someone at the time but just dating....I went on there and filled out this endless questionnaire.&nbsp; I saw my husband&#039;s profile and thought he looked cute. I loved his answers to two of the ?&nbsp; One was if you could have lunch with anyone, who would it be? He said &quot;the nice old Italian lady on the Food Network (LOL- Lidia Bastianich), he also said &quot;I don&#039;t bite...unless you want me too.&quot; Since he kinda looked like Emeril...I wanted to meet him! The rest is history. :-D

				Took a tumble off my mountain bike, and was scraped/bruised for a week or two. While making copies one day, one of my co-workers asked what happened, and he told his downhill-biking friend about me. &quot;Get me her number!!&quot; his friend demanded.<br /><br />Met for a bike ride @ the Cunningham trail after some phone calls and e-mails. Didn&#039;t like him at first- he acted all macho and hardcore.....but I could ride about as well as he did&nbsp; :roll: Turns out he&#039;s very sweet and wonderful despite the occasional macho B.S.&nbsp; :mrgreen:
