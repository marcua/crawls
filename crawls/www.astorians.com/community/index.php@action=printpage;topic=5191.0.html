				SUDDEN FICTION:<br />Flash Fiction, Short Fiction &amp; Prose<br />How can we tap into our unique thinking, feeling and knowing processes to discover and develop our own, special voices, create words that sing, images that startle, delight, and disturb? How can we commuicate effectively what we wish ardently to express? This workshop will sharpen writing skills with a focus on process and language, language as music, language as visual art, via discussions, writing exercises, prompts, and readings by participants and authors of innovative short fictions and novels. This workshop is for intermediate and advanced prose writers interested in exploring what more they can do with language and narrative, as well as writers who find themselves blocked from expressing themselves in a truly creative way.<br /><br />Carol Novack, Instructor<br /><br />Eight Saturdays, 2-4pm beginning February 17.<br /><br />Workshop Fees: <br />$180.00 General&nbsp; <br />$135.00 Women&#39;s Studio Center Members<br /><br />At Women&#39;s Studio Center, 21-25 44 Avenue, Long Island City, NY 11101<br /><br />For more information and to register: www.womenstudiocenter.org/id33.html or 718-361-5649.<br /><br />More about Carol Novack<br /><br />Carol Novack is the author of a chapbook of poems-Living Alone without a Dictionary- and the former recipient of an arts grant from the Australian government.
