				I&#039;ve been pondering lately the fact that what seems should be obvious - that all human beings have inherent worth - is not obvious to everyone. However, clearly, people do change their beliefs, and I want to know how and why that happens. <br /><br />I&#039;ve not always been the tolerant person I am today (ha ha), but I&#039;m curious to know - if you used to think that a certain group of people were inferior, stupid, evil, crazy, etc..... what made you change your mind? <br /><br />I&#039;m talking about stereotypes based on race, gender, religion and sexual preference. <br /><br />Also, how old were you when you changed your mind? (I can&#039;t figure out how to ask 2 questions with this poll).

				I&#039;ve had gay, homeless, transgendered, conservative Christian, pretty hardcore Islamic and obessed with NASCAR friends. These are all things that I, myself, am not. They&#039;re also all things that I have felt negatively about in the past. However, after watching my friends go through the difficulty of coming out to their parents, realizing the gender they ought to be, moving to a big liberal city, dealing with the social effects of 9/11 and watching Dale Earnhart crash, I&#039;ve realized that not only are these things happening to my friends, they are happening to every person whose life I do not personally understand, but who I run into on a daily basis.<br /><br />The guy who gets your coffee or delivers your mail is going through a personal crisis. That jerk in the fax department who screws up everything you send? Personal crisis. The jackass who cut me off in traffic this moring? Probably has had a personal crisis. Maybe not today or the day before, but it&#039;s like that Mother Teresea quote-- <br /><br />&quot;If you spend your time judging people, you have no time to love them.&quot;<br /><br />Being around people who are in minorities has helped me appreciate that every person goes through their own difficulties. And while someone&#039;s difficulties and crisises might not be as bad as someone elses, to each person their hardships are the worst they&#039;ve ever known. Keeping that in mind when I disagree with someone&#039;s views or am angered by someone&#039;s actions helps me to be what I think is a better person: more understanding, more patient and more willing to understand that what I think is True is not necessarily true for everyone.<br />

				I&#039;m from south of the south (FL), and I have to admit that I&#039;ve witnessed more racism here in Astoria than I had in Tampa. I figured the cultural diversity would&#039;ve nipped that in the bud by now but I guess some things never change. <br /><br />It starts with children. Unfortunately, racism is often a part of tradition in some families. I agree with paratactical in that we all have our off days and idiosyncrasies.

				I&#039;m not sure what kerrigankrewe was referring too, but I&#039;m from OK and I&#039;ve noticed differences in the way racism is expressed here, though I don&#039;t really know that one place is more or less racist than the other. <br /><br />In OK, either you are white or you are not. Tulsa is quietly segregated - no one talks about it, but it is. I don&#039;t mean that schools are segregated or anything like that, but there&#039;s definitely a line. I went to a very large, very liberal church and despite the fact that we were all very much against racism there were only a few people of color who went there. I don&#039;t pretend that I understand everything going on there, but the town is certainly divided. <br /><br />In the town where I grew up, nearly everyone was part Native American, so ... that was a little different. You could be Indian. There are definitely some slurs but a certain level of acceptance because we are all aware of the ugliness of the history and most of us have a CDIB card somewhere (certificate of degree of indian blood). But there were only 2 black kids in the whole school, and they had been adopted and brought to the U.S. by a white missionary. People didn&#039;t identify strongly with their caucasian heritage, they just thought of themselves as &quot;American&quot; - even if they were aware that they had Scottish, Irish, or German ancestors. I don&#039;t think there were any Jewish people in the town at all. <br /><br />In Tulsa, I DID expect that my peers - educated young people - would all be pretty tolerant and that was mostly the case. Here, I hear Greek people say things about Turkish people, German people say things about Jewish people ... and it&#039;s surprising. I think it&#039;s because at least some people are more tied to their cultural history. When I think of cultural group X, I think &quot;Oh, they&#039;ve got that really great chicken thing and those funky folk dances.&quot; Someone else might think, &quot;They&#039;re the bastards who killed my great-grandpa.&quot; <br /><br />I&#039;ve definitely heard people say some very intolerant things about fat people, women, and gay people, in both places. And the way people talk about people who have different political or religious ideas is astounding. And I&#039;ve done some of that myself - &quot;Anyone who votes for X is an idiot!&quot;

				Okay, 1) this is probably the most positive nods I&#039;ve ever gotten!!!&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />2) I think I know what people are talking about when they say that the racism is different in different places. <br /><br />In rural PA, we just didn&#039;t talk about it. Race didn&#039;t come up. When two black girls joined my class in sixth grade, no one asked if I was friends with them. No one berated them publicly. However, after six months, someone burned a cross on their yard. They had already had their cars and home vandalized and after the cross burning, they left.<br /><br />In NYC, I admit that I cross the street if I am alone and see a man of another race approaching. It&#039;s not right, but it&#039;s true. My friends admit that different people coming towards them late at night evoke different reactions. In PA, we would *never* talk like that, but violence could be eminent towards these groups. In NYC, we *talk* about our behaviors, but do not tolerate violence against another group of people.<br /><br />I guess it reminds me of the thread about the priest. In rural PA, we would never talk about wanting to hurt a priest who helped GBLT kids, but it would happen. In NYC, we talk about how we disagree with the lifestyle or what have you, but the conversation is open and actually causing harm to another person is out of the question.

				Astoria, like many other New York City neighborhoods, is a highly segregated neighborhood.&nbsp; Demographic statistics are a bit decieving because most African Americans are segregated into one of three housing projects.&nbsp; Getting into a candid discussion of racism in Astoria is not really appropriate for a website like this.<br /><br />Martin Luther King Jr. expressed a no small amount of exasperation when he said he preferred southerners because &quot;at least they hate you to your face&quot;.<br /><br />As the old black saying went, in Dixie, you can get close but not go far.&nbsp; In the North, you can go far but can&#039;t get close.<br /><br />With regard to the original topic, all folks stereotype all groups which are different from theirs.&nbsp; I&#039;d imagine it won&#039;t be popular to say on this thread, but frankly, I do not believe someone when they say they are devoid of stereotypes, in particular in the areas the OP brought up.&nbsp; You have an honest discussion with them and you&#039;ll see it.&nbsp; A nice chunk of self deception is usually at work.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have the stereotypes that I have been raised with and have been engrained in me by my experiences and my exposure to culture.&nbsp; They&#039;ll stick with me for the rest of my life and the most I can do is to do my best to treat folks as individuals and try to not have these stereotypes influence my decisions.&nbsp;

				Thanks for that explanation Paratactical. As for Lobber, sorry, not sure how to clarify that for you. The folks were engaged in a talk about a racist action; therefore, showing to me that it happens here. It&#039;s more profound because it was openly talked about between cultures, which is a regional paradigm.

He was being sincere, obviously, otherwise the other one would have objected. On the other hand if he would have said &quot; it&#039;s because you&#039;re a ni**er&quot;, well then, that would be classified as racist.

Not that it never explodes here, because it does. <br /><br />Maybe it&#039;s the fact that New York is always shoving us in each other&#039;s faces. In other parts of the country, you can live most of your life with very few encounters with people who look, believe, or act very differently from you. So you can say &quot;I&#039;m not a racist&quot;, and mean it sincerely. You don&#039;t think bad thoughts about people in group X because you almost never see anyone in group X. Because you DON&#039;T see someone of another race and catch yourself crossing the street and then asking yourself, &quot;Why am I crossing the street? What does this mean? How do I feel about it?&quot;

I&#039;m not going to claim to be devoid of stereotypes, but I think I reserve judgment until I see, at least somewhat, what people are like as individuals. We&#039;re talking about entire races and religions here. I grew up in a multi-religious household and never felt religious growing up. I wasn&#039;t an atheist either; it just wasn&#039;t something I thought about. I finally went through a personal religious-type crisis in college and took some philosophy courses, and I ended up feeling like people are just going to believe whatever they believe, and people don&#039;t really have control over that. I&#039;m not concerned with people&#039;s religious beliefs as long as they don&#039;t use them as a weapon, which is something I can&#039;t stand no matter what the religion is.<br /><br />As for race, I grew up in a mostly white suburban town, but we didn&#039;t talk about race in my house. I watched The Cosby Show when I was a kid, and I never thought much about the fact they were black. It was the only current sitcom I liked, and watching reruns these days I still think it was a good show. I understand some people didn&#039;t like that show because they didn&#039;t think it was a realistic portrayal of black people, but at any rate I think it brought me up with an open mind towards black people, feeling like they, just as any other people, should be seen as individuals rather than judged by the color of their skin. I didn&#039;t have any particularly negative experiences with black people either which could&#039;ve caused me to feel differently as a child. Perhaps because I was in such a white-majority town, my bad experiences were generally with other white people, which again taught me to judge people by their actions and not by their skin color.<br /><br />And trust me, I don&#039;t love everyone either. I&#039;d go so far as to say I&#039;m vaguely misanthropic. I can&#039;t say what paratactical did, that every time someone upsets me I remind myself that they are having a personal crisis and try not to judge them. But my broad negative stereotypes are usually regarding people in general and human nature, not their skin color or religious beliefs.
