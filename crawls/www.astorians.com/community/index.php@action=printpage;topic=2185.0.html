				So now that Fairway has opened in Red Hook, of all places, (and Whole Foods is coming to Brooklyn - Gowanus) it got me to thinking:&nbsp; what do we have to do to attract a serious supermarket to Astoria?<br /><br />Astoria&#39;s been getting plenty of &quot;buzz&quot; over the past few years, and we&#39;ve got small specialty markets - which are great, don&#39;t get me wrong - but we&#39;re still stuck with crappy - average at best - supermarkets.&nbsp; I do a lot of local shopping, and I don&#39;t think that would change, but I really wish I didn&#39;t have to shlep into Manhattan when I do want to go to a real supermarket.&nbsp; I mean, how ridiculous that in a Greek neighbourhood there&#39;s no decent place to buy fresh fish?&nbsp; (I&#39;m talking up by Ditmars, not 30th Avenue, which is too far for me to walk just to grab some tuna or dry scallops for dinner.)&nbsp; That&#39;s just one example.&nbsp; I&#39;d also really like reliable access to organic produce and meat, not to mention ingredients that aren&#39;t usually found at the local Key Food.&nbsp; <br /><br />What would it take to get one (any one, not necessarily Fairway or Whole Foods) here?&nbsp; Has anyone heard any rumours?&nbsp; Anyone interested in starting a petition?&nbsp; Would that have any chance of success?&nbsp; Should we focus on convincing stores already here to improve their offerings?

				Jayme, Jim thanks you too.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D<br /><br />I remember now hearing about - perhaps from you - the letter you sent to Key Food last year.&nbsp; I have noticed that they are much better than they used to be.&nbsp; That said, it feels inherently wrong to buy &quot;organic&quot; vegetables that are plastic-wrapped onto styrofoam trays, when the non-organic produce is open and you can see and select exactly which pieces you want.<br /><br />Of course, I can&#39;t wait until the CSA begins distribution in just over two weeks, which will nearly obviate the need to pick up any produce for a long time at Key Food, but I still like having the option if I need to pick up something that&#39;s not in the share, or I run out of somthing.<br /><br />For me, I think it&#39;s also not a specific list of things per se - more just a general wish of having an overall better selection.&nbsp; For instance, has anyone ever seen fresh lemongrass at the Key Food under the Ditmars N/W stop?&nbsp; (If so, awesome -- and where?)<br /><br />Christine, I hoped against hope about that space, too.&nbsp; Now, I can actually use a Staples within walking distance, but given a choice, I would have much preferred a better grocery store, too.

				Do you Ditmars people ever go to that huge supermarket on 19th Ave? Is it even still there? I used o go there once in a wwhile because they had a ridiculously large selection of mainsteam products, which when you are used to the local Trade Fair, is actually pretty bizarre. Oddly enough I never shopped at keyfood when I lived on Ditmars. <br /><br />One supermarket that has done some serious upscaling in the past year is the Associated at the corner of Bway and 21st Street. It&#39;s now cleaner and they now have all sorts of balsamic vinagers, but the prices have gone up, which I think is hard on the lower income people who used to shop there.

				One of the few things I miss about Rochester is Wegmans.&nbsp; The mother of all supermarkets.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can&#39;t possibly imagine there would be anywhere sufficient to place one here in NYC, though, as the space needs would be far too demanding.&nbsp; :|

Honestly, I didn&#39;t like it that much. It reminded me of supermarkets in the midwest in the 80s. Huge expanse of space, but nothing that exciting to buy. Modern midwestern supermarkets are much better, with amazing selections, including lots of shiny produce, in stores the size of an aircraft carrier. And I, of course, have a soft spot for tiny Manhattan supermarkets with eclectic selections and 4-foot-wide aisles...

				And Wegmans is the only place I&#39;ve ever seen that has Mirableu (http://americangourmetfoods.com/viewitem.php?item=3245&amp;category=10&amp;subcategory=12), my absolute favourite bleu cheese.&nbsp; It&#39;s a creamy, sharpish, full flavoured Spanish sheep&#39;s milk bleu that has absolutely none of that ammonia characteristic I find so often in even very good bleu cheese. (Jonathan does think a small cheese shop out on the North Fork carries it, and supposedly Fairway had it once, but that&#39;s it.)

				Oh my gosh, I love this. A whole thread about supermarkets (with a good dose of L&amp;O). I used to be the biggest supermarket snob back in Texas. In college I was poor as dirt but I wouldn&#39;t shop the HEB near campus because it was so trashed out and run down. So instead I went to Albertsons (the NICE/slightly more expensive store in town). <br /><br />But true supermarket heaven (for me) is the Central Market on North Lamar in Austin. Oddly enough, Central Market is owned/associated with HEB. But it was a world apart... think of a hybrid between Whole Foods and a local greenmarket and a Fairway -- so there was extensive selection of organic and fresh stuff with all of the &quot;regular&quot; grocery store stuff as well. Massive produce section, cooking displays, extensive meat and seafood, and a huge bakery. Plus an attached outdoor cafe that overlooks a park and playground where they had LIVE MUSIC during the warmer months (which is 3/4 of the year in Austin). Cooking classes, amazing wine section with lots of good staff reccomendations, etc. Plus their newsletter is called the &quot;Foodie&quot;! The only down side was finding a parking space on weekends. We&#39;d get really creative when it came to that.<br /><br />Okay now I&#39;m just making myself homesick. I miss Central Market so much!

				first - please let me say &quot;QFC&quot; Capitol Hill - Seattle - 2am<br /><br />next - I like shopping at supermarkets because it&#39;s EASY (not for produce mind you).&nbsp; Jonathan and i have had many conversations where he basically tells me it&#39;ll be the fault of folk like me when all the mom and pop specialty markets in the neighborhood go out of business.&nbsp; It makes me feel guilty...and it&#39;s probably one reason that I split my time/money 50/50 between mompop/corporate.&nbsp; However - if there was a GREAT market ... a la Trader Joes, Whole Foods, ... pick your favorite - then surely many of those mom and pops WOULD go under and we would probably have a whole lot more 99 cent stores and nail salons.&nbsp; &nbsp;The neighborhood would lose a lot of it&#39;s charm and we would all complain that Astoria is now just like....

				When I was in college (up near Albany) the closest and cheapest supermarket was called &quot;Price Chopper.&quot; I quickly learned the correct local lingo was &quot;Ghetto-Chopper.&quot; I grew up in suburban New Jersey where we had Shop-Rite, Stop&amp;Shop, Whole Foods AND Trader Joe&#39;s, so I found Price Chopper quire unsatisfactory. <br /><br />When I&#39;m feeling reaaaaalllly lazy, I shop at the Associated Supermarket on 21st Ave &amp; 21st Street.

				Does anyone know when the new supermarket on 34th avenue and 35th street is going to open? I heard it was going to be a C-town (boo). Hopefully it will be cleaner and bigger than the one on Broadway. Though I do have to say it is an improvement over what it looked like a few years ago!

				There really are no good supermarkets near me. I have to whip out the ghetto cart to go to the Pathmark on Northern. But i only go there when they have stuff on sale (i obsessively read circulars.) Their produce is NASTY McNASTY. It&#39;s impossible to get anything of that sort there. <br />I like that they have an extensive selection, much more than the Associated, which, until the new market opens on 34th ave, is the closest to me. <br />I used to go to Stop &amp; Shop regualarly when i lived on 30th ave (it was that or the keyfood on 43rd ish street). Their produce is good, organic selection is decent. but unless you can invest the time and energy in the hike it&#39;s not really worth it (although when Pathmark doesn&#39;t have my Dubliner Irish Cheddar, i will walk to S&amp;S just for that). John and i sometimes go since it&#39;s halfway between our apartments, but he&#39;s not a grocery shopper like me. If you have a car, or can get a delivery then S&amp;S is the best market around in my opinion.<br />i really really hope the market on 34th ave is NOT a C-town. it seems like a waste when there is a horrible one a few blocks away already. <br /><br />J

				Do you former Californians remember Bristol Farms? There&#39;s one in Newport, Mission Viejo . . . Not sure if there are any in Northern CA.&nbsp; I forget where else.&nbsp; I could never afford to shop there, but I liked to walk through it.&nbsp; It was like a kicked-up Whole Foods, and outrageously expensive.&nbsp; I miss Henry&#39;s, too, but Whole Foods definitely knocks it out of the park (owned by the same company).&nbsp; There&#39;s no place like home.

				I used to live near the Stop n Shop on Northern Blvd 5 years ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have to admit, I loved it because I could get everything I wanted all in one place, it was clean, it had a great variety of ethnic foods, and the produce selection was pretty good.&nbsp; Plus they had double coupons, and they delivered.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have no idea if it&#39;s changed, but I wish I had a car.&nbsp; Key Food is not too bad though, since it&#39;s my only option at this point.&nbsp; <br /><br />In other experiences, I found the Trade Fair on Ditmars smelly, cramped, and dirty, as was the C-Town on Broadway.&nbsp; Smelly and dirty places holding my food kinda skeeve me out.&nbsp; The only opinion I have of Best Yet is that they&#39;re more expensive for the same items.

				I&#39;ve mentioned before that I am scared to death to drive around here, but I really got sick of the high prices at the Best Yet so I summoned some courage and drove to the Stop n&#39; Shop next to Home Depot! I was sooooooo happy to be in a real grocery store for the first time in a year that I shopped for four hours! And bought more than I ever had at Best Yet for about half the price. The first time I drove there I was a little white-knuckled...I know that sounds silly to those of you used to driving here....but each time (3 times now) is a slightly less harrowing experience. And the view of the Manhattan skyline from the roof-top parking was awesome. That said, the produce is cheaper on Ditmars and some of the meat actually seems better at Key Food. But ohhhhh the selection of everything else....beautiful.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />I&#39;m going to try driving to Target next....the sale ads for the 15 rolls of Bounty towels are calling my name.

				I hear you about being afraid to drive here in Queens- I only do it if I absolutely have to! <br /><br />That being said NYCTexas- not sure where you live in proximity to the R train- but if you are not crazy about driving to Target you can always take the R or G train to Grand Avenue.You might already know this already- but I figured I would mention it to any people who are new to Astoria that you can get to Target by subway. Its about 4 or 5 stops from the R train stop on Steinway. <br /><br />I walked past the new grocery store on 34th Ave last night- it is still all boarded up. Though the actual construction part looks nearly done. I really hope it is a nice, clean store! :-)<br />

				When we first moved here I did get the train/bus to Target, but it was just too big of a hassle with the aforementioned 15 rolls of Bounty, plus the 9 roll Charmin (I like to stock up)and other stuff.&nbsp; Thanks though!

				Honestly I love the Trade Fair on Ditmars- they have such a fascinating collection of stuff. They just obviously don&#39;t have enough room to sensibly stock and organize their shelves, and the store feels claustrophic and dusty. And there are categories of stuff I don&#39;t buy there just because they&#39;re stacked up near the ceiling and I don&#39;t want to have to ask the employees to get them for me, mainly stuff like paper towels, tissues, and toilet paper. Their produce is pretty good (albeit jam-packed) and all their stuff is noticeably cheaper than Key Food. <br /><br />Also, I usually go there late at night, and the store used to smell foul around that time of day.. but it&#39;s been much better recently. That smell has pretty much prevented me from ever buying meat there, though. I dunno what the smell is but it ain&#39;t good.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been to the fancy Wegman&#39;s up in Rochester. Gorgeous store. And we have Stop &#39;N&#39; Shops in Connecticut and those are usually decent and clean, though the selection is certainly nothing special. I guess they had a decent cheese selection. <br /><br />Anyone been to the Trade Fair website? http://www.tradefairny.com/<br />I&#39;m wondering where all those pictures were taken; I&#39;ve been to the Trade Fair on 30th Ave also and, while that one&#39;s much nicer than the Ditmars one, I didn&#39;t see a big olive or cheese section like the ones pictured on the site.

				I like the Pathmark down on Northern, but the staff aren&#39;t all that friendly, and I have to admit the produce isn&#39;t so great.&nbsp; I find the mega produce stand up on 30th Avenue at 33rd Street usually has the best stuff I&#39;ve run across.<br />Anyone try the Western Beef down at the Steinway/Northern intersection?<br />I walk by the upcoming supermarket on 34th Avenue and I&#39;m not seeing any movement.&nbsp; I wish they&#39;d open something there already.&nbsp; <br />Did anyone write Fairway about how great it would be if they came to Astoria?&nbsp; I like them as well as Whole Foods, but they are much better on union issues.
