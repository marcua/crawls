				I went there and I really like the outdoor seating, but I don&#039;t like the price.&nbsp; I feel that it&#039;s a ripoff.&nbsp; I got 1 small topping of cookie crumbs and it cost me $4.20.&nbsp; I could have got a cone from Mister Softee for $2.50.&nbsp; I think I&#039;ll do that next time.&nbsp; I think they will do good business in that location.&nbsp; Maybe one day I&#039;ll try the crepe, since that has a regular price.&nbsp; I dont&#039; like it that when I get the frozen yogurt I will be surprised or shocked at the price after it is weighed.&nbsp; This seems like a gimmick to me

				You guys realize what rent prices in the neighborhood are like, right? You know that the Fast Break went out of business because of a huge rent increase. In order to be able to afford rent prices in our neighborhood, stores have to charge more to break even. Like having the store fronts occupied? Then you should accept the changing financial demographics of the neighborhood and pay a few extra bucks to support them. If not, when the old businesses run out on their sweet 10 year leases and have to renegotiate at current rent prices, you can expect their prices will go up too. That&#039;s what you get when average one bedrooms are renting for $1800 and above around here. More people moving in with more money, land lords charging more for rents both commercial and residential, mean higher prices across the board. It&#039;s not like any of the small business owners I know in the neighborhood are living in the lap of luxury. They&#039;re trying to get by and doing what they have to do to make their rents. Or you can shop at chain stores that eat the cost of the high rents around here in order to have market saturation and don&#039;t have to worry about cost of goods because they buy in huge quantities.

I think it&#039;s the opposite. If we support them we validate the rents and they keep going up. If they go out of business because people don&#039;t pay the high prices then the owners will have problems renting the space out, i.e. rents fall.<br /><br />Of course the problem is the dummies moving in who think that these idiotic prices are ok. How much does it cost to make a batch of pancakes? Two eggs, about a cup and a quarter of flour and twice that in milk. A bit of butter. That&#039;s it. Makes what... 12 crepes? <br /><br />But hey, we could use some more yogurt places on 30th ave. Can&#039;t have enough of those.

				That&#039;s just it , rents wont fall .&nbsp; &nbsp;If people don&#039;t rent expensive apts then&nbsp; the landlords will be forced to lower the prices ??&nbsp; yea imagine that ...... it just doesn&#039;t seem to happen since someone will always overpay ./&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Same deal with dining out .&nbsp; &nbsp;And its not the cost of the flower or eggs&nbsp; &nbsp;which makes this store charge so much , its the rent prices they have to pay .&nbsp; Still doesn&#039;t mean im gonna spend 8 dollars for a yogurt .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you decided to go , then complaining really is pointless .&nbsp; I know going to the movies with a family of 4 will cost near 100 dollars ,&nbsp; its sooooooo crazy , so we went a dvd instead .

				I decided to go back to Yogurt La Crepe this weekend and see if I could take a little bit less and how much would it cost.&nbsp; Well it worked out good.&nbsp; It only cost me $3 and the next day I went back and it only cost me $2.50.&nbsp; You just fill up the cup a little bit and that&#039;s really all you need.&nbsp; I saw a lady buy a big cup for a little girl that was filled to the top and with lots of toppings.&nbsp; It came out to be over $7.&nbsp; That&#039;s crazy.&nbsp; I bet that little girl&nbsp; couldn&#039;t even eat all of that.

				I think Yogurt La Crepe is doing good because it&#039;s a very welcoming atmosphere inside with little tablets that kids could play around on.&nbsp; They also have a student discount.&nbsp; The outdoor seating makes me want to go there. It&#039;s also a very good location with lots of people walking around.

				I like this place! My husband and I had lunch there recently: a grilled chicken crepe (pesto, diced tomatoes, cheese) and a bananas foster crepe. Both were delicious. We also got a strawberry lemonade. The owner made a point to come and introduce himself, which we appreciated! Neither of us tried the frozen yogurt, but they have a non-dairy option, which is always nice, and some fun-sounding flavors. We&#039;ll definitely be back.
