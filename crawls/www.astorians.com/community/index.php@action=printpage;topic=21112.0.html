				Hi everyone:<br />&nbsp;<br />I know that this issue has been discussed on these boards in the past few years, but I would like to get your informed opinion.<br />&nbsp;<br />I just moved to Astoria this week, and a long-time resident of Astoria suggested that I get a window gate for my bedroom window that is accessible via the fire escape.&nbsp; The window faces the back of the building and is on the fourth of five floors.<br />&nbsp;<br />I have gotten estimates from several locksmiths in the area, and the consensus seems to be that the total cost would be $350 to $400 for one window (35 x 70).&nbsp; I suppose this is a small price to pay to prevent burglaries and peace of mind, but your input is greatly appreciated!<br />&nbsp;<br />Thanks,<br /><br />JF

				If they want to get in, they will find a way. Just because somebody has window gates<br />doesn&#039;t mean that they will never be burglarized. All it takes is a crowbar and a crackhead<br />can get through your window. Sure it&#039;s more work for the burglar, but I would be more concerned<br />of getting out in case of a fire. <br />

				A window gate on a fire escape is <strong>absolutely</strong> necessary!&nbsp; Especially on the building you describe. Spend the money on a gate and get a good lock for it. <br />Your property and piece of mind is worth it.

				Window gates are the only way to properly secure/protect a window<br />It is important that you get a gate that complies with F.D.N.Y regulations<br />all gates must be numbered and tagged/ if there not dont get them<br />Astoria lock and safe has registered gates with a patented locking system<br />they are located at 30-08 36th street. The price should be about 425 installed<br />come by and see if its something equal to what you have seen, two styles to choose<br />again all gates must be&nbsp; tagged <br />you can call 718-539-2393

				All F.D.N.Y app gates must be tagged so they can be sure the gate is compliant to the law<br />the fire dept issues the approved gate manufacturer&nbsp; a special i.d # so if ever an emergency or investigation<br />occures it can be traced back to who made it and who installed it. un approved or mis-instlled gates can<br />result in tragedy. for a more specific explanation you can call Kendi iron works and ask for Anna<br />718-821-2722.

				A far less expensive option would be a wooden dowel cut and insert between the top of the bottom window pane and the top of the frame, to prevent someone from sliding the window up from the outside and renter&#039;s insurance. I&#039;ve been in Astoria for almost 10 years, and haven&#039;t heard of many burgalries, but with dowel that I mentioned, the burglar would have to smash through the window, which if they&#039;re dedicated enough to do that, the gates aren&#039;t going to stop them. <br />If they&#039;re really that dedicated, your renter&#039;s insurance (mine comes out to be under $20 a month) will cover any losses, something a gate won&#039;t do. <br />That said, if the gate makes you feel safer, go for it, but personally, I don&#039;t see them as necessary.

				Not to mention window gates are a good psychological deterrent too.&nbsp; Your average crackhead/opportunist is not carrying break-in tools and will skip a gated window to opt for an easier score. <br />&nbsp;

				Does renters insurance cover your life or injuries.<br />Sure the old broom stick works but, they break the glass.<br />A burglars worst enemy is time,with dealing with the window, then the gate most times its just too much<br />trouble for them,these are lazy guys looking for a quick in and out. trust me they almost always opt to find an easier window. noise and awkward settings are not the places they want to be and waste time on something they wont breech.but the truth is nothing is un-penetrable all you buy is time.

				The super in my building has come up with a contraption that prevents the bottom window from coming up more than 4 inches or so and simultaneously prevents the top window from coming down.&nbsp; &nbsp;I KNOW how it works and it took me about 5 minutes to open it when I locked my keys in my apartment.<br /><br />If the burglarizers are willing to go as far as breaking glass, they will get past anything BUT a gate.&nbsp; &nbsp; There are enough stupid people out there to leave their windows unlocked for them to waste time futzing with a window that won&#039;t open or to draw attention to themselves by breaking glass.<br /><br />Just my opinion.

				I don&#039;t know how many burglaries there are in Astoria relative to other places, but my apartment was broken into three years ago and when the cops came they said there had already been 13 similar robberies in Astoria that day. That&#039;s enough to make me want to be more careful. <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if there were high robbery stats: old buildings + generally higher incomes than the rest of Queens would make Astoria a prime target.

				Along these same lines, how often do burglars get into apartments through windows with air conditioning units in them?&nbsp; I mean, it&#039;s basically an open window with a box stuck into it.&nbsp; I put mine in a couple of weeks ago, and it wouldn&#039;t be simple to get in, but it&#039;s doable. Where I come from, A/C is not a box.

				Thanks McKenna.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t realize they were screwed in.&nbsp; That makes sense.&nbsp; Mine was left behind from the former roommate, and they just had it placed in the window.&nbsp; I&#039;ll probably go with the dowel suggestion for extra security.&nbsp;
