Also for a more pricey, crowded, and amazing broth experience, Ippudo. Holy crap delicious. Too bad there&#039;s a two hour wait whenever I go to Ippudo. It&#039;s like the Taverna Kyclades of ramen places.<br /><br />As for what exactly a ramen place is, yeah, it&#039;s Japanese ramen noodles. What makes a good ramen place special is delicious savory broth, and you get it with things in it like slices of pork as well as a hard-boiled or poached egg, some sort of long mushroom, seaweed, whatever. It doesn&#039;t sound very impressive, but when done well there&#039;s nothing like it. If this place on Ditmars is authentic and good I will be quite happy.

				I attempted to go last night, but I don&#039;t think they ever opened. Sign still said closed as of 8PM, though it looked reeeeeeeeeally close to opening, with employees doing stuff inside. I considered that they might&#039;ve just forgotten to turn the Closed sign around, but there was a bottle of Windex on a table and they didn&#039;t answer the phone when I called, so I think they were actually closed.

				We had dinner there tonight.&nbsp; I am not at all an expert on ramen, but we thought everything was very tasty.&nbsp; We had two Tonkotsu Shoyu, one with extra cha-shu pork, and one with a poached egg; and one Nagoya.&nbsp; The noodles were different, but no one explained to us why or exactly what the difference was.&nbsp; (I spoke briefly to the owner last night and he told me that once they get the kitchen running smoothly, they will start making their own noodles.)&nbsp; We also tried the pork belly Niku man (small sandwich on steamed bun).&nbsp; Portions were very generous and we left feeling somewhere between very satisfied and stuffed.<br /><br />When we got there, about 60% of the tables were full.&nbsp; By the time we left, the place was packed and about half a dozen people were waiting for tables.&nbsp; There were a lot of people there with kids - it seemed very family-friendly (but not overrun with small children).<br /><br />Service was friendly but not very explanatory.&nbsp; None of us know much about ramen beyond the basics, and it would have been really helpful to have more explanation about the different types of noodles and add-ons.&nbsp; There are brief explanations of the different types of broth on both the menu and the large chalkboard near the entrance, and I think the blank space on the chalkboard would be an ideal place for that.<br /><br />Here (http://images.nymag.com/images/2/daily/2012/03/30_hinomaru-menu.pdf) is a copy of the menu [PDF].<br />

				I was there tonight too. Really liked it! The overall flavor reminded me of Minca, except I think Hinomaru offers more topping choices. I&#039;m glad to hear they&#039;ll be making their own noodles, lanseaux, because the noodles struck me as a little off compared to ramen I&#039;ve had elsewhere - not that I didn&#039;t enjoy eating them. I really liked the chashu. <br /><br />It&#039;s a bigger place than I expected. I hope they do well there. I&#039;ll definitely be going back.

				I ate there on Wednesday and loved it. The pork belly niku man was so awesome, and the ramen was great. Looking forward to them making their own noodles, too (coming in April). I didn&#039;t understand a lot on the menu, but a combination of Google and asking our waiter helped immensely. I think this place is going to be a big hit - it&#039;s new, different, and offers tasty food. Really glad they are here!

				Thank god for some authentic Japanese ramen on Ditmars! <br /><br />Went last night and had Tonkotsu and my bf had the Hinomaru. We both loved the broth and thought this is a place to stay in the hood! Like others, I didn&#039;t care much about the ramen and great to hear that they will make their own soon in the future. <br /><br />I&#039;m amazed about the fast turnover of tables. This place will be making so much dough soon that they will expanding to other places!

				We went tonight around 8:30 and were able to get seats which was nice.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am not a Ramen expert so was a little intimidated by the menu (and lack of translations) so we both ended up just getting the veggie ramen with a poached egg and beef gyoza.&nbsp; Everything was wonderful and a woman who appeared to be one of the owner-types was walking around and talking to all the tables.<br />We will definitely be back but I think before I go I will study the menu a little with Google (a la MegC) so I don&#039;t have to ask the server 100 questions again.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;:cheesy:

				ate here tonight and had the nagoya ramen with a poached egg, quite good, maybe not the best but a solid (and different) addition to the neighborhood and I&#039;ll definitely be back to try more. This was my girlfriends first time trying ramen and she loved it. Gyoza was also good but a little pricey for what you get I think. Also byob cause your choices are coke, water or oolong/jasmine.<br /><br /><br />went around 7:30 and there were like 2 tables left. By 8pm there was a line out the door.

				Went yesterday.&nbsp; I also think it&#039;s a great addition to the neighborhood, and especially Ditmars, which generally lacks more interesting food options.&nbsp; But being more of a meat eater, I can only enjoy this just so much. But I will say that what I had was very flavorful and delicious.&nbsp; I got the Tonkotsu Shoyo (creamy pork broth ramen) and added extra pork and a poached egg.&nbsp; It wound up very very rich and incredibly tasty.&nbsp; We had both the beef and pork Gyoza.&nbsp; They were great.&nbsp; Better than most places other than maybe JJs.&nbsp; And I really liked the sweet mashed potato they put underneath.&nbsp; The Niko Man little sandwiches are very tasty.&nbsp; The pork belly didn&#039;t seem appealing to me.&nbsp; But the shrimp was great.&nbsp; Served over a very rich egg salad.&nbsp; The servers are young and they move quickly from table to table.&nbsp; English abilities vary.&nbsp; We were asked over and over for our drink order.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t call it bad service, just a little sloppy and too rushed.&nbsp; And the yelling hello and goodbye to people coming and going is cute, but then can become annoying if you&#039;re not in the mood for it.&nbsp; And yeah - the benches are not at all ideal, in my mind.&nbsp; Not terribly uncomfortable but it was about the jacket and whatever else you have.&nbsp; Considering how tasty the food is, I hope they up the game a little bit with the atmosphere and furnishing.&nbsp; If so, then I think it would really be a winner.&nbsp; &nbsp;The owner, or senior manager visited our table at the end and was very kind.&nbsp; She described all the foods and was interested in our opinions.&nbsp; She mentioned some specials, but sadly, none of the many servers we had said a word to us about specials.&nbsp; &nbsp;It also seemed to me that the customers they draw are a bit younger and more diverse than normally drawn to Ditmars eateries.&nbsp; I think that&#039;s a good thing.

				They have beer now! Sapporo and Asahi along with a few others. I really like this place. Make sure whatever ramen you get has a poached egg and a fire ball in it (unless you are totally averse to spicy - but it&#039;s not that spicy) and it&#039;s really good.

				The wife and I finally ate here last week.&nbsp; Our experience was the complete opposite of what I&#039;ve read.&nbsp; This was the worst dining experience we&#039;ve had in years!&nbsp; We both chose a different type broth but found them equally distasteful.&nbsp; The broth was more akin to mopwater then a stock to feed humans.&nbsp; The noodles were undercooked and the pork was grey, fatty, and nasty.&nbsp; Oddly enough the gyoza was excellent.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Also the freaking music was blasting!&nbsp; There is never a reason to play awful hip-hop in <em>any</em> restaurant.&nbsp; This &quot;music&quot; is not conducive to a dining experience.&nbsp; The benches are a bad choice too.<br /><br />We walked out of there having eaten little of our meal and immediately went to Watawa for a couple of rolls to get the nasty taste out of our mouths. <br />You couldn&#039;t pay me to get me back in this place.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve only been once.&nbsp; The food was delicious.&nbsp; The service was fabulous.&nbsp; The place was pretty quiet (customers-wise) I don&#039;t remember the day or time of day.&nbsp; But what baffled me... the music. <br /><br />UGH UGH UGH. <br /><br />I get it.&nbsp; It&#039;s part of the atmosphere.&nbsp; Young.

				Well, they were inspected July 2012 and the only critical violation was food over 41 F which means almost nothing, since it&#039;s basically impossible to keep all the food at that temperature all the time. <br />They shouldn&#039;t have being inspected until summer 2013, but they did and they were closed, which to me means that somebody sent the DOH. And when the DOH have to go somewhere because of a call, oh boy, they come with vengeance.<br />Obviously they had to have some major violation to be shut down completely, but nowadays with this point system implemented by the city I could walk in any restaurant in new york and if not shutting it down, at least give it a B or C and fine them thousand. The system currently in use is deeply flawed since it relies completely on the inspector&#039;s judgement and leniency, or lack thereof.<br />Don&#039;t hate, jussain&#039;<br />Ivan <br />Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk HD

				If you look at Watawa&#039;s inspection record, it&#039;s pretty common the inspectors come every 6-8 months in Astoria. Nevertheless, Hinomaru must have done something very wrong that would impacts the health of the consumers to be shut down. I wouldn&#039;t want to eat there again.

				Hinomaru is so tasty, but one thing really turned me off. Their food really must not be healthy. I took a few of my soups/ramen home because we didnt finish it there and the next day i went to go eat it and noticed after it refrigerated you saw all the fat that hardened in the soup. It was mostly white fat. I mean, i guess that&#039;s why it tasted so good. I&#039;m not saying anything about how this connects with them closing, i just figured i&#039;d share. I&#039;ll tell ya something though, those happy hour Sapporo&#039;s on tap is a beautiful thing.

				Well, for example, tonkotsu-shoyu ramen is defined as follows on wikipedia: has a thick broth made from boiling pork bones, fat, and collagen over high heat for many hours, which suffuses the broth with a hearty pork flavor and a creamy consistency that rivals milk, melted butter or gravy (depending on the shop).<br /><br />I tend to think of ramen as being more of a comfort food than a healthy food, especially when pork belly is involved.

				I dont understand how a place can reopen the very next day after all those critical violations. Makes me think, maybe it really was just a hot water issue.. Who knows, but it was open yesterday and packed as usual so i guess it didnt scare anybody off.
