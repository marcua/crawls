				Now, if you&#039;re all excited (because Hair will be in the Delacorte Theater and you won&#039;t have to get your butt muddy in the Sheep Meadow or on Great Lawn), and you&#039;re already wondering what you&#039;re going to wear, <em>here&#039;s</em> you&#039;re sandals!&nbsp; You can mail order them from suburban New Jersey.&nbsp; How time change!<br /><br />http://www.hippieshop.com/cgi-bin/gold/category/5000 (http://www.hippieshop.com/cgi-bin/gold/category/5000)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />[attachment deleted by admin]
