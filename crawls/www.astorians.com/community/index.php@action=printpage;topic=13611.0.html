				I&#039;m looking for a roommate for a short term sublet, three months, in an unfurnished bedroom of a two bedroom apartment.<br /><br />The apartment is located on Steinway St., in an area known as &quot;Little Cairo.&quot; Its a safe, diverse neighborhood with great restaurants.<br />A laundromat is located across the street, a grocery store can be found one block away. Around the corner from the 30th Ave. cafe and night scene, 20 minute walk to the Astoria Kaufman movie theater, with tons of shopping on Steinway itself. Its a ten minute walk from the N,W train at Astoria Blvd., 15 minute walk to the Steinway St. R,V trains or you can hop a bus for an even faster trek to and from the subway.<br /><br />I am looking for someone who can appreciate coming home after a busy day and relaxing quietly. I am not a partier, although I do appreciate the occasional drink, and I&#039;m not looking for a best friend in a roommate, just someone I can talk with but can appreciate having space as well. I&#039;m not super stressed about cleanliness, but I&#039;d appreciate someone who can help keep common areas clean. I&#039;d prefer a female roommate, and someone in their 20s.<br /><br />Rent is $765/month and *includes utilities* (cable internet, electricity, gas). A security deposit and first month&#039;s rent are needed upon move in.<br /><br />Pictures of the apartment and more about me upon request.
