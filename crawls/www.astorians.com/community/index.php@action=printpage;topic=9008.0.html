				I feel bad for Bhutto and feel bad for Pakistan, but I feel worse for any of our poor boys or girls who are out there in Iraq, slugging it out daily, because our government has duped them and duped us into thinking that this war has something to do with democracy, while we are propping up dictators like Musharraf all around the globe.

				Shocking and tragic, but not a surprise.<br /><br />Bhutto was reviled by many folks, and her murder was probably a plot by local Islamists in collusion w/ elements in the Pakistani Intelligence Service (who actively supported the Taliban BTW).<br /><br />Sadly, it was only a matter of time before the killed her.

I saw an interview with Bhutto&nbsp; about three weeks ago on TV, where she&nbsp; said she knew her life was in danger, but, wanted no interference&nbsp; or support from Musharaff, as she wanted&nbsp; to bring democracy to this nation. She was&nbsp; asked, what about thevthreats&nbsp; from the Islamicists, she said&nbsp; a true leader&nbsp; can&#039;t cower in fear, or resort to&nbsp; dictatorial&nbsp; security measures? OK?&nbsp; :roll:&nbsp; You see, Pakistan, is bordering Afghanistan, a place even&nbsp; the &#039;peace and love&#039;&nbsp; for Che&#039;&nbsp; mob would agree is where Bin Landen had a base and he is&nbsp; loved in N&#039;Pakistan&nbsp; where Musharaff was restrained by the USA and&nbsp; the West&nbsp; from barreling in and taking out&nbsp; the B@st@rds.&nbsp; So, he has backe doff and even was&nbsp; ready to allow elections. This region, like Iraq, Afghan and the rest, have ZERO tradition of free expression, and the Islamicists&nbsp; want to chaos&nbsp; to take over, then NO one&nbsp; will ever be free, like happened&nbsp; in Iran.
