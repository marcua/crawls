				There is one in the Italian-American Club on 31st Street and 21st Ave ... and there is one in a store right on 31st Street, close to 21st Ave on the same side of the street as ABC ... sorry, can&#39;t remember the name, only that they have a sign that there is a Notary available.

				most banks, if not all, notarize documents. I think that the average charge I&#39;ve seen is $5... although I went to the US embassy in China and it cost $35!

				Unfortunately, I let my notary license lapse.&nbsp; As firelight79 said, notarial fees are $2 in New York State and are set by law (http://www.dos.state.ny.us/lcns/lawbooks/notary.html):<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">ยง136. Notarial fees.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A notary public shall be entitled to the following fees:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. For administering an oath or affirmation, and certifying the same when required, except where another fee is specifically prescribed by statute, $2.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. For taking and certifying the acknowledgment or proof of execution of a written instrument, by one person, $2, and by each additional person, $2, for swearing such witness thereto, $2.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Also, the fee to become a notary is $60, not $75.&nbsp; Here&#39;s a general FAQ page (http://www.dos.state.ny.us/lcns/ntryfaq.html) on notaries in New York from the NYS Department of State.<br /><br />There is a notary in the little office on 35th St. just behind that newish pharmacy I can never remember the name of, just south of Ditmars (across 35th street from the ill-fated Les Moules location).&nbsp; He charges $2.

				I&#39;m a notary (lawyers get to be notaries without having to take the test). The max fee is $2. I never charge anyone -- seriously, is signing my name and stamping a piece of paper $2 worth of effort? If someone charges you more, report them. That&#39;s just sleazy.

				there is a Notary Public about a block from the Astoria Blvd NW stop, the office is called Crescent Accounting and Tax Services, and it&#39;s on Hoyt Ave South just south of the subway stop.&nbsp; it kind of looks like a hole-in-the-wall operation but my experience there was pleasant enough to reccommend it.&nbsp; you might want to call ahead to see when he&#39;ll be in though - (718) 777-5563.

				There&#39;s one near the corner of Ditmars and Steinway, near that Chinese restaurant. They have a &quot;notary public&quot; sign in the window and charge the standard $2.<br /><br />I just opened an account at WaMu, and they said that starting in May, all of their banks would have one, and they&#39;d notarize things for bank customers for no charge.

				I never understood the point of a Notary. It&#39;s like, if an organization is so concerned about fraud or false documents, you&#39;d think they&#39;d have their own steps in order to protect against it. What good is some crooked old pharmacy owner in Astoria or whatever have you who has absolutely no interest in said organization ?? (no disrespect meant to those on here who are Notaries, I&#39;m not saying you are all crooked, just getting my point across) <br /><br />It just seems like an obstacle to make things difficult for people.

				The only thing a notary does is authenticate the fact that the person signing a document is who he or she says, which is why you are supposed to have to present ID to the notary and sign the document in front of them.&nbsp; It has nothing to do with the authenticity of the document itself, or any organisation or person behind the signature (but it does reinforce the signer&#39;s legal responsibility for the document&#39;s authenticity).&nbsp; The fact that a notary has no interest in the identity he or she is authenticating is supposed to make it more reliable and strong, not less.<br /><br />A notary is a holdover of an ancient office.&nbsp; Wikipedia has a good look at Notaries and the history (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notary_public) of the office (here is info specifically on New York notaries (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notary_public_%28New_York%29)).&nbsp; <br /><br />You can also get things notarized for free (http://www.nycourts.gov/supctmanh/notary_public.htm) if you go to the NY Supreme Court at 60 Centre St.&nbsp; The notary office is in the basement.
