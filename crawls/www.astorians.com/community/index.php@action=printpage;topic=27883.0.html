				The CEC/Citywide Working Group is a coalition of District and Citywide Education Councils across New York City. We, along with numerous other public school parent and pro-public education groups, will be convening a rally on the steps of the <strong>New York Public Library on 5<sup>th</sup>Avenue and 41<sup>st</sup>Street at 4:00PM this Thursday, April 10<sup>th</sup> </strong>(please note the correct time and location)<strong>.</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />The rally has been called in the face of provisions in last week’s state budget which promote the pitting of parents against parents and the willful destruction of public education in New York City by Governor Cuomo and the New York State Senate, all at the direction of the billionaires and hedge funders who have given large contributions to these politicians and would like to privatize our public schools.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;This mandate from Albany forces NYC to:<br />[font=]<strong>·</strong>[/font][font=] Offer public school building space to all new charter schools that request it;[/font]<br />&nbsp;<strong>·</strong> Pay rent for space for charter schools if we cannot find a suitable public school space;<br />&nbsp;<strong>·</strong> Accommodate expansion of already co-located charter schools;<br />&nbsp;<strong>·</strong> Give authority for charter schools to consent or appeal spaces offered to them; and<br />&nbsp;<strong>·</strong> Increase per pupil funding for charter school students while the Campaign for Fiscal Equity money was eliminated.<br />&nbsp;<strong>·</strong> Give any currently co-located charter school or any approved for co-location during the last months of the Bloomberg administration veto rights to any proposed change in space utilization;<br />&nbsp;<strong>·</strong> Allow any charter school to appeal the city’s decision on space allocation to the State Commissioner, who is a former charter school director; <strong>·</strong> Increase per pupil funding for charter school students while the promised funds for our public schools from the Campaign for Fiscal Equity lawsuit have never been fulfilled. <br />&nbsp;These provisions represent a huge unfunded mandate to NYC, and will create a two-tiered education system that favors charter schools while reducing resources and causing more overcrowding in our already critically overcrowded public schools. <br />&nbsp;These provisions represent a huge unfunded mandate to NYC, and will create a two-tiered education system that favors charter schools while reducing resources and causing more overcrowding in our already critically overcrowded public schools.<br />&nbsp;We ask that you mobilize your parents, your students, your community members to attend this historic rally. Attached is a flyer with information, and multiple ways of reaching rally organizers, as well as some points of interest about our cause. Please contact us with any questions or information as soon as possible at SaveNYCSchools@gmail.com (SaveNYCSchools@gmail.com).<br />&nbsp;Thank you in advance for your support of public education and <strong>all </strong>our children. We know you are bombarded with many invitations, but this rally will prove to our legislators that we stand as one.<br />&nbsp;Like “Save NYC Public Education” on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/savenycpubliceducation (https://www.facebook.com/savenycpubliceducation)).<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<strong>The CEC/Citywide Working Group</strong><br />&nbsp;Supported by:<br />&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 9pt;" class="bbc_size">AQE (Alliance for Quality Education) </span><br /><span style="font-size: 9pt;" class="bbc_size"> Brooklyn New School PAC</span><br /><span style="font-size: 9pt;" class="bbc_size">Change the Stakes Class Size Matters</span><br /><span style="font-size: 9pt;" class="bbc_size">ICOPE (Independent Commission on Public Education) </span><br /><span style="font-size: 9pt;" class="bbc_size"> NYCC (New York Communities for Change)</span><br /><span style="font-size: 9pt;" class="bbc_size">NYCORE (New York Collective of Radical Educators) </span><br /><span style="font-size: 9pt;" class="bbc_size">NYLPI (NY Lawyers for the Public Interest)</span><br /><span style="font-size: 9pt;" class="bbc_size">NYCpublic.org ParentVoicesNY</span><br /><span style="font-size: 9pt;" class="bbc_size">PLUS (Parent Leaders of the Upper East Side)</span><br /><span style="font-size: 9pt;" class="bbc_size">Teachers Unite</span><br /><span style="font-size: 9pt;" class="bbc_size">WAGPOPS (Williamsburg and Greenpoint Parents: Our Public Schools!)</span><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;This new legislation takes all decision-making and input related to co-locations out of the hands of parents and community members and gives preferential rights and subsidies to charter operators. <strong>It is the full on privatization of New York City’s public school system.</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<ul class="bbc_list" style="list-style-type: disc;"><li> This new bill requires New York City to allow any charter school that is co-located or will be co-located to use public school space without cost or charge of any kind. Forcing our elementary schools, already operating at 96% capacity and high schools at 94% capacity, to share space needed to meet state regulations for special needs and ELL students.</li><li> Our districts are comprised of high percentages of special needs, ELL, disabled, and homeless students; the same students “big box” charter schools often shut out.</li><li> Charter school per-pupil funding will increase by $500 per pupil, between the 2014-15 and 2017-2018 school years.</li><li> This bill signifies the continuation of an inequitable and segregated education system in NYC. It violates the constitutional right of non-charter school students and solidifies a two-tier system: leaving high percentages of low income, high-needs students in over-crowded schools with little funding.</li></ul>
