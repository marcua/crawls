				I feel like I&#39;m in some kind of contest on who gets the apartment first hehe.<br /><br />I was hoping someone here could help me! I&#39;m a 23 yr old female, currently living in the Bronx and looking to move to Queens with my gf.&nbsp; I hear Astoria is a beautiful place to live and have visited Astoria a few times. <br /><br />Anyone know a site or a real estate agent that could help? The max rent I would like to spend is $800. NO studio. A one bedroom if possible. <br /><br />Please let me know if anyone can help. I would so greatly appreciate it. I don&#39;t know where too look! I&#39;ve looked on Craigslist and rent-direct. Rent.com sucks...and a few others do as well, giving absolutely NO information, and if so, it&#39;s information that isn&#39;t even for New York (*ahem* rent.com)<br /><br />Thanks all for whoever even reads this!

				Hey, I know! It seems impossible in ALL the GOOD areas. *sigh* It&#39;s such a pain looking for a place with a good price in a decent area. <br /><br />I&#39;ve lived in the Bx all my life. So I&#39;m looking to &quot;branch out&quot; of here and go some place diff. I&#39;m looking in both Queens and Brooklyn.
