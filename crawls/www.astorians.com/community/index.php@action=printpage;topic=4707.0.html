				I&#39;d like to hear more women on the board. Where are you all? Kudos to the guys for being so &quot;out there&quot; about being out. Any 30-40 something women out there? I just moved here from Manhattan a couple of months ago and would like to get a network of girl--friends here. Let&#39;s not be such a tiny minority. This is a great place to connect....

				Sure, I&#39;d be interested (I&#39;m 36, BTW).&nbsp; Send me an e-mail, or stop by the brunch at Mundo on Sunday--I&#39;ll be there for at least the first hour.

				Hi Stephanie,<br /><br />I wasn&#39;t able to be at the brunch today. And I have questions about the site--how can I email someone? I have some &quot;limited&quot; membership on this site.apparently and I don&#39;t understand why/how that works. I tried to set up for sending individual messages and got a message that I do not have that option. Do you know how I can send you or other members emails? (Anyone else that would provide info I would also appreciate).<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Astoriana

				To be more specific: can someone tell me what statuses like &quot;Tourist&quot; mean and what options one has at different status levels? (If there is somewhere on the site I can find this info, please just direct me). Thanks!

They also affect the number of messages you are allowed to keep in your PM mailbox, so keep a careful eye on the sliding scale thingy located on the right side your mailbox. BTW, if you would like to donate to the site, there is a link at the bottom of every page, you get unlimited space in your mailbox.<br /><br />

				Absolutely! Anyone who wants to meet up some time should just send me a message. Maybe we could all meet up for coffee... Or if anyone doesn&#39;t like groups and wants to meet individually I am fine with that too. The goal is just to connect with more women.
