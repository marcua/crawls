				I usually go over to Zodiac, because it's the closest place to my apt.<br /><br />Yesterday, my boyfriend &amp; I were looking for somewhere to watch the Yankee game, and although it wasn't on when we walked in, they switched one of their big TVs to ESPN at our request. And the good thing about Zodiac is they pretty much leave you alone and let you sit around as long as you want (though this is frustrating if you actually want prompt service). <br /><br />But yeah, it would be nice to know if there was a more sports-oriented venue in our 'hood...

				well, there is Broadway Station, but people smoke there and its really freaking loud. Plus the TVs are often hard to see though there's a million of them. Come to think of it, someone told me about a sports bar by Steinway somewhere, but I can't recall where. I've never tried Zodiac. Maybe that's next. <br /><br />ESPN totally has the best coverage of the Yanks! I love their crazy camaras.

As long as you don't mind not having sound, their (fairly large) TVs are on the end wall, which makes them easily viewable from most of the dining area. (I went armed with my little radio so I could hear John Sterling's wonderfully cheesy commentary on wcbs!)<br />&nbsp; :D

				It's especially fun listening to the game on the radio while watching on tv, because the tv has about a 5 second delay, whereas the radio is pretty much real-time-- so you already know what just happened right before you see the pitch-- it's like being able to see into the future (which I appreciate when watching those nail-biting games)! <br /><br />Yeah, Leiter really pulled through yesterday... we needed it badly. Hope he keeps it up!<br /><br />Let me know next time you go out to watch a game! I usually just catch games on the radio, or Friday nights on channel 9, or the odd &quot;big&quot; games worthy of CBS or FOX. But I'll always go out of my way to catch Yankees-Red Sox. (Next Yankee-Red Sox match-ups are in Sept... 9/9-9/11 in NY, and 9/30-10/2 @ Fenway-- what a way to end the season!)

				Well, we might just swing by there tonight to see the Yanks whip the oh-so-tired Texas after thier 14 inning loss to the Angels last night. Let's all look out for good places to watch. Maybe we've got a local fan club on our hands here! <br /><br />BTW, Sunswick is a pretty good place to watch, too, but you have to sit at the bar or you can't see the tube.

				I have been hanging out in Astoria for all of my life and I will give you one of it's little treasures, especially to watch a game. It's Cronin &amp; Phelans Pub on Steinway and Broadway. http://www.croninandphelans.homestead.com<br />&nbsp;Anywhere you sit there is always a TV for great viewing, and they have access to every game. The bar is the oldest bar in Astoria and for good reason. Their food is of great quality and reasonably priced and their staff is always there to make sure that you feel at home and are some of the nicest people you will every meet. But the true gem to this place lies in their Bartender Dave Cremin. Dave is one of the best up close card magicians I have ever had the pleasure to see. His is simply amazing and his jokes are great too. Dave has a way of making you feel like family even if it's just meeting him for the first time. So please take my advice go have something to eat while taking in your favorite game then afterwards get a after drink at the bar and ask Dave to show you a trick. You will be glad you did... Dave is there from Tuesday thru Saturday after 6 PM <br />&nbsp; Starlite Karaoke also does the occasional karaoke show there which is always a lot of fun... It's the only bar we can still dance on and get away with it.<br />&nbsp;PS. This is a SMOKE FREE environment, strictly enforced!!!

				Can't answer that one but I guess they are just trying to keep up with the memorabilia... To tell you the truth I think that has to do with the political office above them. Oh well, it still is a great place to watch a game!

				I've been in there before. As I recall, the TVs are small and it's really dark and kind of sad, no?<br /><br />I think that the Irish Rover is really the best place. I've surveyed many a game-watching venue since this initial post. I'll probably blog something about it the next the the Yanks don't lose and make me sad.

				Sometimes I think that John Sterling is either freaking moody or that he's having an affair with Susan Waldman. Their commentary is always either a lovefest or a snarkfest. He's such a little b-tch. I like him though, just 'cause I'm used to him, I think.

				gonna have to disagree with ya on that one.. I sometimes think that Suzyn (I think that's actually how it's spelled) always has that &quot;wind blown reporter&quot; thing going on a little too much. &nbsp;I've been listening to John Sterling since '88 (we didn't get MSG in my hometown growing up) and I can remember all of his partners since then (Jay Johnstone, Joe Angel, Michael Kaye, Charlie Steiner, now Suzyn) and Charlie was definitely my fav.. &nbsp;a great quote from last year - the yanks were playing baltimore and I think the score was like 7-6 in the second inning... Charlie Steiner simply said &quot;It has not been a Picasso here tonight!&quot; and I was dying of laughter in my car. &nbsp;But hey, to each is own - I'm not a huge fan of John Sterling's silly nicknames for the players (&quot;the bamtino, Giambino, Jorgy Juices one, etc) but I love the way he calls the game.. &nbsp;sorry that was way too long a post on such a silly subject. &nbsp;:)<br /><br />Tim

				I enjoy listening to John Sterling's commentary. I listen to the games on WCBS a lot since I don't have YES or ESPN. I think John's corniness (and sometimes just plain weirdness) is off-putting to some people, but for me it makes listening to the game on the radio more entertaining. I think Suzyn does well to balance him out.<br /><br />Some Sterlingisms that amuse me...<br /><br />&quot;It is high! It is far! It iiiiiiiis....... caught at the wall&quot;<br />&quot;A thrilla from Godzilla!&quot;<br />&quot;Back to back, and a belly to belly&quot; (when back to back HRs are hit)<br />And of course: &quot;Yankees win!

				i've become accustomed to having the radio coverage on while watching the game on TV -- largely because i can not stand the Yes announcers, except for Ken Singleton. <br /><br />the radio, of course, is a few seconds ahead of the TV, at least when watching on cable (last time i tried there was no perceptible delay between radio and TV when watching on regular antenna broadcast). <br /><br />i was at the stadium last week and thinking of bringing a radio, which reminded me of the delay between radio and Yes, and i thought: wouldn't it be hilarious if the radio broadcast was a few seconds ahead of the actual game? what if the stadium was filled with headphone-wearing fans who reacted to the plays 3 seconds before they happened?<br /><br />well, maybe you had to be there to get the humor. this was last Tuesday's game where it was 210 degrees in the stands.<br /><br />i'm going to the game Thursday. it's free Mousepad night!

				i don't think this Yankees team will make the post-season.<br /><br />they win a few, they lose a few, a fan jumps into the netting and the security guard grasps that fan's ass for way too long -- this Yankees team is at best a .500 team from here on out. <br /><br />in 3 years i think the character of the Yankees will be very different. the remaining zillion dollar rockstars will be Rodriguez and Giambi, locked into lifelong contracts that could feed nations. I think Jeter will jump ship, Matsui will get traded, Williams, Sheffield, Rivera, Gordon and Martinez will retire, the bullpen will be a revolving door of double and triple A upandcomers... <br /><br />it's going to be a lot more interesting than this team! hooray for smallball!

				The bullpen and the starting staff is already a revolving door of AAA guys.. only thing is, they're actually way better than the washed-up pitchers the Yanks signed or traded for. &nbsp;Matsui won't get traded, they'll just stupidly let him sign with another team and then pay Tony Womack millions to take his place in left.... man sometimes I wonder if I could get a job for the Yankees since I'm so good at reading their (George's) mind...

				Anyone gonna be out watching the game this Sunday (10/2)? (it makes my head spin to even think about what the standings might be by then!)<br /><br />Friday &amp; Saturday are televised on &quot;regular&quot; tv, ch. 9 and 5 respectively, but Sunday's game is on YES (@ 2:05 I think?) which I don't have... So I'll probably go out somewhere. I usually just walk over to Zodiac since it's closest to my apt, but I might rather seek out a more sports-oriented venue for this one.<br /><br />I've seen mention/recommendation of Cronin &amp; Phelan here, maybe I'll give that a try?
