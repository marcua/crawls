				I know that some people feel the area has too many Japanese restaurants, but which one has the best price on sushi?&nbsp; <br /><br />I love Kumo for their deluxe teriyaki platters.&nbsp;

				Sakura has $3 uni.&nbsp; Normally that would make me suspicious, but theirs has been consistently good since they opened.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had a poor piece.&nbsp; The last time I was in there it was so good I ordered another piece for &quot;dessert&quot;.

				Sorry gave bad estimates on Tokyo&#039;s addresses. I always got the best sushi in Astoria there. I tried the other places and they were never half as good, quality or sizewise, or in freshness.

				If you are able to go for lunch, a few of the sushi places on Ditmars have great lunch specials- for $6.50, you get 2 rolls, miso soup and salad at Sakura.&nbsp; I think it goes up to $9.50 for 3 rolls, soup &amp; salad.&nbsp; Watawa has a similar special, maybe a dollar more or so.&nbsp; the choice of rolls is fairly good.&nbsp; The lunch special is 7 days a week until 4pm, I think.<br />(sakura will also give you a complimetary bowl of edamame, but I&#039;m not sure if they do this for the lunch specials).

				It&#039;s 2 full rolls (12 pieces), though you can only choose from the more basic rolls (california, tuna. yellowtail, etc) for the special.&nbsp; Still a good deal, I love doing it as a weekend brunch.&nbsp; Sakura and Watawa are very similar, but I&#039;ve had slightly better experiences with Watawa -- Sakura always seems to give me regular shrimp when I order sweet shrimp, Watawa not only gets it right but they throw in the fried head too.&nbsp; But I&#039;d happily recommend either.<br /><br />I believe last time I passed by Kumo (Ditmars and 36th i think?) they were offering this lunch special as well.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never eaten in there, but I&#039;ve gotten takeout and its been satisfactory.

				Yes, 2 full rolls.&nbsp; I can defintely put down more than this for dinner, but for lunch, it&#039;s perfect :)<br />I prefer Watawa to Sakura as well, but often find myself in sakura on off hours with my daughter enjoying the lunch special.&nbsp; she loves miso soup and cucumber rolls and they are always so kind to her in there.

				The Sakura lunch does sound like a very good deal, then.&nbsp; This is giving me a terrible craving for orange soda, which, if I&#039;m not having hot tea, is my perfect-sushi-go-with beverage.<br /><br />Oddly, I can go out of my way after work to Flushing and transfer to a bus that gets me home to Astoria for same price, so in summer, when I have time after work, I go to Flushing for take-home sushi.&nbsp; My beloved regular place disappeared while I was away with a broken leg, so I now I go to the higher priced sushi take-out place in the Hong Kong Mall on Main Street.&nbsp; When I compare prices on sushi, this what I&#039;m comparing it to:<br /><br />Today I got a 6 pc variety sushi (1 shrimp, 1 whitetail, 2 tuna, 2 salmon) for $6.&nbsp; I also bought an 8 pc tuna roll and a 5 pc inari - I think each of those dishes was $4.&nbsp; This is an exclusively take-out place, and downtown Flushing suffers from not having an out-door space where you can sit and eat.&nbsp; This might sound like a high price for the rolls, but I think the rolls are bigger (more fish) at this place.&nbsp; <br /><br />The place makes up packages in advance, but it&#039;s not to be confused with mall sushi!&nbsp; You don&#039;t get little packets of wasabi, you get a ball of the real deal, and ginger that pleasantly bites you back.&nbsp; Since I tend to get there near closing, after I&#039;ve picked what I intend to buy, they put a few other packages on top to show me what I might get at a discount if I round up to, in this case, $20.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t take advantage of the deal today, though, because I had just indulged my other craving, Blimpies, and it was tooooooo much for one night, and my home fridge is just too cold for sushi storage.

				that sounds great!&nbsp; I don&#039;t find myself there too often, but flushing is full of hidden culinary gems.&nbsp; I used to see an accupunctunist/herbalist in the back of some store (probably couldn&#039;t even find it now) who was amazing...I would love to get something to eat after my treatment.

				the hubby and i used to go to tokyo a lot...now we tend to go to sakura because of the salmon skin salad (yummy!).&nbsp; it&#039;s a shame because i used to prefer the sushi quality at tokyo.&nbsp; it just got to be a pain to go to two different places for sushi takeout (we&#039;d go to one for the sushi and then on the way home, pick up other things at a second place).<br /><br />also tokyo has a frequent buyers program...used to be a card stamp thing (after 10 meals, you&#039;d get a free sushi deluxe meal)...now last heard, it&#039;s a 10% off card.<br /><br />as far as the best price for sushi, i don&#039;t think you can judge by price.<br /><br />let&#039;s face it.&nbsp; sushi is expensive...considering what it is.&nbsp; i think you just have to find the quality you like the best and forget about how much it cost.&nbsp; it&#039;s all pretty relative in the grand scheme of things...a few bucks difference one way or the other (unless you&#039;re going to something truly high end like nobu).<br /><br />i mean you can get bland sushi for pretty cheap at one of those quickie places (sushi-to-go or supermarket stand stuff)...but unless you just want a quick fix, it&#039;s pretty disappointing.
