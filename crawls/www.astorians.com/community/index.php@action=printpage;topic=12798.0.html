I think these guys (or people like them) would&#039;ve had the same plan regardless of McCain&#039;s campaigning. People like this is why Colin Powell&#039;s wife never wanted him to run. I&#039;ve had similar fears about McCain and Palin&#039;s talks about Obama associating with terrorists since Obama would already be a target due to his race, but this case seems totally unrelated to that.

				I see my home state is representin&#039;. <br /><br />*sigh*<br /><br />I visited Tennessee last week and you wouldn&#039;t believe some of the backwards conversations I had with some people about how if Obama gets elected all the minorities are going to band together and kill all the whites.<br /><br />Also overheard a guy in a gas-station talking to the cashier about how Obama was a Muslim and a thief, etc, etc.<br /><br />It was pretty frightening. The whole regin isn&#039;t necessarily like that, but the ratio of backwardsness to normalcy is pretty elevated.

				The ugly tone of the McCain/Palin campaign is a contributing factor to alot of the racial animosity we&#039;ve been seeing and hearing these last couple of months. Some of the insinuations made are subtle, and some are more overt, but they are there. I don&#039;t know if these nuts that were arrested&nbsp; reached the point they were at independent of what was heard at the McCain/Palin rallies, but you can bet that if they were already near a boiling point, this sort of hate mongering can put them over the top. Even a couple of republican senators made comments about the ugliness at these rallies, and how the candidates need to tone it down before things get out of hand.

Just wanted to put your irresponsible suggestion to bed.

				Not too long ago, I heard two reporters who were assigned to the McCain campaign interviewed about what they witnessed at the latest rallys.&nbsp; Both reporters stated that there are crazy people at every rally, but as time went on, McCain and Palin seemed to be attracting more and more of these people.&nbsp; One of the Reporters stated that things got so heated at one of these rallys that she decided it was time to leave because of the tone.&nbsp; This interview was on MSNBC and I recall that the Reporters were from Midwestern papers, nothing too &#039;liberal&#039;.

				Billz1981 my comments are not irresponsible. The point I was making was that McCain &amp; Palin speeches have divisive rhetoric and use alot of code words that trigger some people to say alot of troubling things at their rallies. Instigating angry feelings of the opposing party&#039;s candidate can be seen as condoning hate among the die-hard supporters and fringe elements. These 2 white supremist nuts most probably already had their own agenda, but there may be similar others people out there who are not the militant type, yet are hearing phrases like &quot;pals around with terrorists&quot; and &quot;he&#039;s not like us&quot; and &quot;we are the real americans&quot; may very well come to the conclusion that Obama has to be stopped.
