				It&#39;s true. Museum-y stuff pays really badly.&nbsp; The field is so oversaturated with qualified candidates.

				Yes, museums are not known for being generous with their salaries. So unfortunately, you work with the budget you&#39;ve got.&nbsp; :-(&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#39;s about right for this type of very entry-level work for a museum, from what I&#39;ve seen. And if you&#39;re looking to break into this type of work, experience working on a big high-profile event is a good resume booster, so sort of balances out the pay. Temp job, so sort of an &quot;internship.&quot;<br /><br />Anyway, the position was filled. <br />

				I&#39;m sorry, but &quot;temp job&quot; and &quot;internship&quot; are not necessarily equal.<br /><br />Bottom line:&nbsp; museums, as nice as they are, suck with the salary.

Obviously not the case for all. <br /><br />This all a moot point anyway, but appreciate the feedback. Now I know why salary is not listed in most job postings! (i was just trying to be upfront about it and not waste people&#39;s time).

				IT all depends... I work at a cultural institution but I get paid generously because the actual work here sucks, and they know it. THey have to pay people just to come out here to the Bronx and because of the institutional culture of stuffiness and general creative restriction, they have a really high turnover rate here. They are also quite large. All these factors mean they can pay a bit more, of instance.
