				Thought we should start a fresh thread:<br /><br />Where:<br />Tacos Mexico<br />38th St just south of Broadway<br />Friday, January 20th 8pm<br /><br />Reveiw by Annie:<br />Tacos Mexico on 38th just down from Broadway is the best. I&#39;m originally from Southern California and although that usually doesnt make me privy to much around here, it does mean that I know my comidas mexicanas. And this place is the best. They even have a jukebox and telenovelas playing on the tvs in the afternoon. Pool table complete with local sharks in the adjoining room (full service bar too)!!<br />Not only are the tacos authentic (none of that flour tortilla-Taco Bell-style crap) but the salsas are homemade and the guacamole actually has real avocados (revolutionary). The huaraches and the sopes are great to share (big plates!) and the tostadas are so authentic you wouldn&#39;t recognize them as the deep-fried monsters Americans are used to. Order up a Pacific Claro with your torta (what the locals tend to get-- great bread!) and you&#39;re set. If you&#39;re in the know, you&#39;ll also get a traditional horchata (spiced rice milk) for the road!<br /><br />Who is going:<br />flooz<br />Meg<br />Jonathan<br />Jennifer<br />Josh&nbsp; aka jtrane<br />goldfish boy<br />anzubird<br />harlan 50/50<br />Julie aka autumn<br />goldfishboy<br />anzubird<br />christine?<br />annie?<br /><br /><br />Please add your name if you want to join in.

				I&#39;m BACK from the hazy golden embrace of LA and wow does NYC totally suck-- I mean I missed the morning wino on the corner of Steinway and Broadway soooo much... ahem, one thing that I&#39;m really honestly glad about is this group dinner thingy! Grrrreat idea, kids. And the telenovelas at Tacos Mexico are just screaming for a wider audience.<br />I will endeavor to abstain from any and all comidas mexicanas until then! <br /><br />So my man and I are IN!<br /><br />looking forward to meeting you all

				So I was in there once this summer, just having dinner, when like 30 people came in to celebrate what seemed like a baptism or a quincenera (!) and the restaurant just kinda gave them the whole other room. (You know how its split into two spaces?) You know, they dominated the room on the left with the bar and the jukebox, etc. But the main room where I was eating, there was still room. So if that means we have to stop by there or call ahead to give them a heads up, then yeah. Physical accomodation shouldnt be a problem (especially at 7pm, right?)<br />If people prefer, I can stop by on my way home from work (they tempt me constantly on my daily commute). They don&#39;t speak much english there so let&#39;s hope for the best (&quot;ummm hola!...vamos a comer...&quot;)<br />

				I had a blast, now I can picture the faces behind the names! <br /><br />How funny that Tacos Mexico is as much a take-out joint as it is a sit-down place. It&#39;s a satisfying feeling to practially take over a restaurant.<br /><br />Can&#39;t wait to see the photos and read each person&#39;s review. Once the local restaurant owners learn about us, they&#39;ll be plying us with free drinks! Well......one can hope.

				Glad to have a first meal with the group at a place for Mexican.<br />A really cool group. Like listening to the listeners.<br />Love Annie&#39;s accent.<br /><br />Unlike some of you may be, I am not a gourmet nor a food adventurer.<br />But there should be plenty of interesting choices in Queens where I can gather bravery.<br /><br />And when it works out, I&#39;d be up for East/West North Lower Astoria and beyond.<br /><br />Thanks S for the pictures.<br /><br />(other topic, if anyone has interesting architecture in Astoria to share, I welcome your notes.)<br /><br />If you go to Tacos Mexicos, I wish that I had not ordered a tamale; very difficult to cut with a fork.<br />My chicken enchiladas with red sauce was fine.&nbsp; &nbsp;:lol:<br />Next time, might try some of the variety of tacos that others ordered.<br />(The menu had a much larger variety than I am used to seeing.)<br /><br />The highlight for me was simply the cafe con leche at dessert.<br />Quite a flan crowd.<br />bon appetit BuRP<br /><br />
