				It will be reopening towards the end of 2009.&nbsp; Sounds like an awesome project and a great thing for Astoria.&nbsp; Part of the expansion project includes a 10,000 square foot outdoor Screening Garden where they will have, amongst other things, outdoor movie showings.<br /><br />Check out this press release for more info:<br /><br />http://www.movingimage.us/site/about/content/press_releases/20080228groundbreaking.pdf

				AMMI was for me the best thing in Astoria.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve been an AMMI member for almost as long as I&#039;ve been in Astoria, now over 20 years.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve literally seen hundreds of movies there.&nbsp; Coincidentally, the first movie I ever caught there was the last movie that screened before it closed its doors for the renovation:&nbsp; HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY.<br /><br />I am going to miss this place.&nbsp; In the early days -- the early 1990s -- they used to have weekday screenings and I remember once slipping out of work one afternoon to see a film, BAD COMPANY, and there were about two people in the theatre besides myself.&nbsp; &nbsp;They quickly stopped those screenings.<br /><br />As Astoria started to gentrify, AMMI tried to start a series called &quot;Cinema Classics&quot; and had a Thursday night screenings as well as weekend screenings of a classic film.&nbsp; &nbsp;They didn&#039;t draw on the weeknight and refined the schedule so the classics, which supplemented their regular repertory programming, screened early Saturday and Sunday evenings.&nbsp; &nbsp;Those were fairly well attended.<br /><br />At first, in days before the Regal &#039;plex opened and P.C. Richards was still King Kullen there was absolutely nothing around AMMI.&nbsp; The area was real quiet.&nbsp; &nbsp;The bar Southwick was a deli run by an Irish woman, but that went out of business and the storefront was vacant for awhile until Southwick moved in.&nbsp; &nbsp;Now the chain&#039;s have arrived and the area is bustling with activity at night

				I actually walked by the construction site of the school before there was any structure, probably just after they tore down the former barracks. I started crying walking down 35th ave and I received a phone call from someone in thbe prossess and then started screaming. I coujld not believe that building was gone. I used to play on thag block while my grandma and the other older ladies would sit in folding chairs in front of that building and chat. It was just a huge shock to see it.

				Actually the barracks were old wooden structures that sat on what was once the back lot for the studio. It was small - the area is now taken up by the new section where the present Main Entrance is entering into the areas for the TV Studios.<br /><br />The Studios are where Sesame St is shot. Where Late Line with Al Franken, Soul Man with Dan Akroyd, and Whoopi with Whoopi Goldberg was shot.<br />

				I took 36 pictures when I was there last. I put them up on my flickr page if anyone wants to check them out. There is SOOOO much more to see at the museum than the stuff I decided to capture. Please forgive my nerdiness as I took mostly pictures of Star Trek and Star Wars stuff.<br /><br />Here it is if I haven&#039;t scared you off it yet =)<br /><br />It&#039;s not a link to spam I promise, just museum photos.<br />http://flickr.com/photos/24041151@N03/sets/72157604184770328/ (http://flickr.com/photos/24041151@N03/sets/72157604184770328/)<br />

				I just noticed that the museum is open for limited hours for a while. It&#039;s often a useful place to take out-of-town summer visitors. And, since you have to hear the construction noise, you might as well get close to it.<br /><br />&quot;Museum of the Moving Image (http://www.movingimage.us) is undergoing a major expansion. We are pleased to announce that this summer we will be open from July 8 through August 29. The Museum&#039;s galleries are open to the public Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and Friday, 10:00 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. (free admission 4:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.). During construction, visitors will enter on 37 Street, near 35 Avenue. The theater is currently closed. For information about screenings and special events, please see our calendar.&quot;<br />

The facade paneling, bright during the day and luminous at night, will begin to go up in September 2009 and will be finished by the end of this year. The interior includes a major structural shift to accommodate a grand entrance hall, which connects the existing facility with the new addition seamlessly.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />(http://www.movingimage.us/site/expansion/content/images/progress/progress53.jpg)

				I&#039;m looking forwrad to the reopening too. Can&#039;t wait. Thanks for posting the links TRX. I had forgotten what the plans looked like. The new addition looks to be something special. <br /><br />I dug up this article in the Times from 1989, discussing and analysing the original transformation of the studios into MoMI.<br /><br />www.nytimes.com/1989/07/02/arts/architecture-view-from-sound-stage-to-strong-silent-museum.html (http://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/02/arts/architecture-view-from-sound-stage-to-strong-silent-museum.html)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If Gwathmey Siegel&#039;s architecture were a leading man in the movies, it would have to be described as a strong, silent type - and this new museum is just that, even if it does not have the richness of materials that these architects are known for. The three-story building housing the museum was originally a storage warehouse and garage for Paramount. It is a plain loft structure of concrete, with a blunt matter-of-factness that makes it seem particularly appropriate to Gwathmey Siegel&#039;s clean, reserved architecture. There are no frills here, no eccentricities, just big, evenly spaced windows on the outside, and on the inside a grid of round columns spaced 25 feet apart that is so purely geometric that it could almost have been designed by Gwathmey Siegel last week. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
