				Can anyone tell me where to get a good chicken parm hero around 30th ave...<br /><br />I am not thrilled with Grand Ave Pizza as I do not like there sauce too much.&nbsp; Their pizza is fine, but I wasn&#39;t thrilled with the hero. <br /><br />The 2 pizza places near the subway, Alex&#39;s and Astoria Pizza are both subpar in my opinion...<br /><br />Help, please...i will walk if it is worth it.&nbsp;

				Frattelli&#39;s on Bway/29th has a great eggplant parm, and their lasagne is amazing. Not sure about the chicken parm, but i&#39;m sure it&#39;s delish. They have very conservative hours, though, so it&#39;s not super convenient.<br /><br />

				Not to change the subject.... but since you mentioned Gaudio&#39;s I wanted to mention their pizza is awesome as well! Its a hike and a half from my apartment now- but I used to go there all the time and the food was always great!<br /><br />Where is Bella Napoli located? <br />

				Yes, I agree that their pizza is great too.&nbsp; Their sicilian and grandma slices are exceptional.<br /><br />as for Bella Napoli, I think it is on 34th avenue and 33st (maybe 34st).&nbsp; &nbsp;I prefer Gaudio&#39;s though...
