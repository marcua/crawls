				It almost seems at random when the buses seem to be coming.. even at rush hour in the morning. I see three zooming past me going one direction (the opposite of which way I need to go of course.) &nbsp;Sorry, I just needed to vent a little bit..

				Sorry, that's actually the universal law of buses: three go by in the opposite direction before yours comes.<br /><br />In bad weather, the ratio increases to 4:1.<br /><br />It's been scientifically proven, I swear! <br /><br />(Just count yourself lucky it never gets really cold here, because that makes the wait even more painful.)

				<strong>asicliptus</strong>, I recommend starting smoking. When I used to smoke, I would notice that around 7 times out of 10 a bus would arrive within about a minute of me lighting a cig. ;)

Service was suspended for a while, and when it returned, it was really stop-and-go. It took me hours to get to work.<br /><br />Nice bit of serendipity thought: this morning I had a 9:30 telephone interview scheduled for a new job I'm shooting for. The subway crapping out let me make the call in the privacy of my home instead some coffee shop near my office... *thumbs up*<br /><br />We need a *thumbs up* icon, methinks...

				Hey what time did the trains start up. Just curious! &nbsp;I was on the platform when they started announcing that there was no service. Do you know what was the hold up in the tunnel? &nbsp;We went home, got the car and drove into Manhattan.

				I'm not sure when service was initially restored, as spotty as it was.<br /><br />I was on the train @ Ditmars at around 8:30 when they announced the suspension. I went back home to prep for the interview, etc. I went back to the Subway at around 10:30 and the train did pull out, but it took <strong>30 minutes</strong> just to get to Broadway. Most of the time the train was stuck in between stops.<br /><br />I hopped out at Broadway and hoofed it to Q'boro Plaza. I figured at the ate the train was going, it was going to be at least another 30 minutes until I could transfer to the 7.<br /><br />Wouldn't you effing know it, though. No sooner had I started walking then 3 trains go by me in the direction of the Plaza. &nbsp; :x <br /><br />Oh well. Glad to know those fare hikes are being put to good use. &nbsp;:?

				If you&#39;re talking about the Triboro Coach buses there is actually a schedule that they run on and adhere to it quite steadfastly.&nbsp; You can find a downloadable .pdf of most of their schedules on their web site: www.triborocoach.com<br /><br />Just thought I&#39;d share that with you and the other bus lines have web sites with schedules - including the MTA.<br /><br />

				eventually that site won&#39;t work as they are all taken over by the mta.<br />you can get the good stuff on the mta website. there&#39;s one link that will take you to the full listing with all the private buses that have fully been taken over, and another one that won&#39;t . as usual the mta has their s___ together, eh?<br />Jenn
