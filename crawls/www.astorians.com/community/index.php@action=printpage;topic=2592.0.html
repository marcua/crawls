				What are people&#39;s favorite wine stores in Astoria?&nbsp; I suspect everyone knows Grand Wine and Liquor up at 30th Avenue and 31st Street.&nbsp; I really like the Discount store just West of Steinway on Broadway myself, and have found the service at the small wine shop on Broadway between 34th and 35th Street (Southside) to be probably the rudest and worst service I&#39;ve ever had in any liquor store.&nbsp; Where do people go to buy wine and liquor in Astoria?

				I agree with you McDirk the people in the wine shop on Broadway and 35th Street haven&#39;t been very helpful or friendly the few times I have gone in there. I usually get my wine at the discount place off of Steinway Street and Broadway or the wine shop on Broadway just below Crescent Street. I like the Grand Wine and Liquor Store off of 30th Avenue- but usually I am too lazy to walk over there.<br /><br />Next question- I just started to drink white wine. I have always prefered red wine. I am partial to Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio- does anyone have any recommendations?<br />

				The Discount place is very nice - good staff too, they&#39;ll help you find things if you ask them, and they&#39;re always friendly.<br />How do places with bad customer service stay in business?&nbsp; The store on Broadway 34/35 Streets was the most recent in a line of businesses at that location with nasty customer service.&nbsp; The pizza place was dirty and rude, the Greek restaurant would never serve me (five visits, never got to order - I did, however, once get a menu, but they wouldn&#39;t take my order, ever - and they had so many interesting looking artichoke dishes that I was eager to try).&nbsp; <br />The short guy at the Wine Store follows me around the entire time I&#39;m in there, he&#39;ll even leave the counter to do it.&nbsp; I thought he was trying to be helpful at first, but I think he must think people are going to shoplift wine or something.&nbsp; He likes to stand a few inches behind you and give you nasty looks.&nbsp; It&#39;s really weird.&nbsp; I even got carded there, which usually makes me very happy, but this was carding me to give me grief.&nbsp; It&#39;s been years since I was last carded.

				I&#39;d say go to some of the free wine tastings that many liquor stores have and just see what you like. <br /><br />I had a great Amabile -light and a bit sweet - that I picked up after trying it at Vino&#39;s free wine tasting (http://www.vinosite.com/).

				Are there any places in Astoria that do wine tastings?&nbsp; It sounds like fun.<br />Anyone try the liquor store up on 31st Avenue in the mid 30s?&nbsp; I walk by it, but never have gone in.&nbsp; It looks like it might have a decent selection from the outside.&nbsp; I miss the wine store on Broadway near 32nd Street, it was always my favorite.<br />I&#39;ve found Rieslings and Marlboroughs to both be very good.

A friend of mine highly recommends a wine store that&#39;s further up Bway- I think around 38 or 39. He took me in and pointed out his favorite wines, but of course I don&#39;t remember what they are.

				The one further up Broadway is the Discount Wine Store.&nbsp; They are great.&nbsp; Good selection, low prices, helpful staff.&nbsp; It&#39;s just West of the Commerce Bank on Broadway.

				I really love the wine/liquor store on 36th Avenue just west of 31st Street.&nbsp; It&#39;s owned by four young guys (30s), all friends and/or cousins I think.&nbsp; They are really helpful, friendly, and know what they are talking about.&nbsp; They have helped me select numerous bottles of wine, and I have loved almost every one.&nbsp; On top of that, their prices are really really great on wine.&nbsp; Liquor prices vary much less from store to store.&nbsp; I&#39;m told that there are many Manhattanites who take the N/W into Astoria just to visit this store!

				There&#39;s a great wine (and liquor) place on 31st Street by the Ditmars station. Jolson&#39;s. The guys there really know their products and are very willing to advise and discuss their stuff. Plus, if they don&#39;t have something you want, they&#39;ll do a lot to find a distributor to get it. The sign that&#39;s up just says &quot;Liquors&quot; and seems trashy but it&#39;s actually just fine inside. AND they&#39;ll deliver! Nice when you&#39;re prepping for a party and don&#39;t want to carry it all back.

				I walk by the store on 36th Avenue often, I&#39;ll check it out.&nbsp; The one up on Ditmars sounds like a great place as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;Places that deliver are always a plus.&nbsp; Thanks!
