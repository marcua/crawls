				To gain knowledge which challenges accepted ideas is to be faced with a quandary, as we see below in the story of Galileo. &nbsp;At times like this, one must screw up one's courage and declare the truth. &nbsp;So here it is:<br /><br />Gin is clear. &nbsp;It is. &nbsp;The pale blue of the bottle makes the liquid appear blue, but it isn't.<br /><br />Please don't kill me, JW! &nbsp;Just invite yourself over for cocktails and appetizers and see for yourself. &nbsp;I will gladly re-create the experiment for you.<br /><br /><br />From today's Writer's Almanack:<br /><br />It's the birthday of Italian astronomer Galileo (Galilei), born in Pisa (1564). He devised a simple open-air thermometer (1607), but his greatest breakthrough was to build an improved refracting telescope (1609), with which he clearly confirmed the view of Copernicus, who insisted Aristotle was wrong, the Earth was not the center of things; the Sun was. Galileo's books were banned; he was summoned to Rome, to be tried for heresy. In 1633 he was convicted, sentenced to house arrest for life, and his books were ordered burned. He was forced either to renounce all his Copernican beliefs or be tortured on the rack. While signing his declaration that the earth was stationary, he muttered, &quot;And yet... it moves.&quot; Confined to his home, he continued to study physics and astronomy, until, in his seventies, he grew completely blind.
