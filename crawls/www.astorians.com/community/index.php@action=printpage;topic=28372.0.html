				Greetings, all! I have a worm composting bin to give away to any Astorian interested in greening up their life just a little.&nbsp; <br /><br />Full disclosure: The worm bin is disassembled, still covered in dried worm castings, bagged up, and boxed, so it&#039;s going to be a little funky by now.&nbsp; You&#039;re going to have to wash it.&nbsp; Sorry about that.<br /><br />If the idea of touching a dirty worm bin grosses you out, then this is not the hobby for you. <br /><br />It was one of the many beloved possessions that I had to jettison when my moving van hit its full capacity.&nbsp; Hopefully, the worm bin will find a good home and not end up going out with the recyclables.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />For reference, this is the exact model:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Q6HMSY<br /><br />I had six good years with this bin.&nbsp; As long as you do your homework, worm composting is easy and doesn&#039;t smell at all when done properly.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had plenty of friends sitting next to this fully loaded bin in my living room without realizing the earthy weirdness it contained. <br /><br />I&#039;m more than happy to share some tips as I want the new owner to be successful with this endeavor.&nbsp; However, this is not a lifetime tech support type of deal.&nbsp; You really do need to do some research so that you and the worms that you buy/acquire are not traumatized by the experience.&nbsp; <br /><br />Please shoot me an email if you&#039;re interested.&nbsp; I&#039;ll tell you where the funky box will be left for pick up as I have already left town and have tasked my awesome neighbor with giving away the worm bin.&nbsp; Happy composting!
