			Can anyone think of a great place in Astoria to have a bridal shower? A place with a back deck or something would be nice. Let me know!

			never been there, but the seafood place on the corner of 31st st and 24th Avenue seems to host parties a lot, has a fairly large outdoor area and i think some of it is covered.<br /><br />for Huge Parties, the bohemian hall across the street from the fish place has an outdoor beer garden that is huuuge. Also has a small stage area. But the outdoors seem to be mostly uncovered, and the upstairs is small. (the downstairs is pretty big... but not sure it really gives off Bridal Party vibes... depends on the bride, i guess... ;)<br /><br />cheers,<br />alia
