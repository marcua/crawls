				Hey there - you can renew it by mail.&nbsp; Check out the info here: http://travel.state.gov/passport/get/renew/renew_833.html.<br /><br />So does this mean that you&#39;re planning a fabulous trip somewhere?&nbsp; Do tell!

				Note that renewing your passport via mail takes a few weeks. If you&#39;re within two weeks of your departure, you can call and make an appointment with the passport authority in Manhattan. Your passport is then renewed within 24 hours.<br /><br />for the most accurate information, refer to website.

				My only fabulous trip right now is to beautiful South Beach for my upcoming bday.&nbsp; No passport required.&nbsp; But I just want to have it ready, in case I want to travel outside the US.

				You can renew it at the main post office at 33rd Street and 8th Avenue, as well as at the big post office on 3rd Avenue at 54th Street.&nbsp; Make sure you have all your identification paperwork in order.&nbsp; I had to sign an affidavit for a friend as he didn&#39;t have a drivers license (he does have valid ID) - I don&#39;t think he&#39;s received his passport as yet.

				It does take a few weeks, which is why it&#39;s a good idea to think about these things ahead of time.<br /><br />I&#39;m going to Costa Rica next month and it only hit me the other week that I&#39;ll need a passport - thankfully my passport from my summer abroad in 2000 is good for ten years.&nbsp; Glad I remembered to check, though...

				I hate dealing with the post office- its always a disaster. So the last time I renewed my passport I used a place called &quot;Its Easy Passport&quot;. I was in a bit of a rush to renew my passport and they were able to sort me out really quickly.&nbsp; They take the pictures there for you and sort out all of the paperwork. I had my passort in about a week.I don&#39;t remember the exact cost- but it wasn&#39;t too bad and it was worth it for me to not have any hassle. They also do Visas and other travel documents. If you don&#39;t want to go through the post office- I highly recommend this place! <br /><br />Its Easy Passport<br />125 Park Ave, 2nd floor<br />Satellite Airline Terminal<br />(212) 866-its Easy<br />www.itseasypassport.com<br />

				it&#39;s easy can blow it out their rear.<br />i had an awful experience with them while getting a visa and passport pages for a coworker.<br />like the guy quoted on price and then upped it when i picked it up. so i had to lay money out for my coworker. <br />that is ridiculously shady and i will never use them again, nor vouch for them in any way shape or form.

				Thanks for the help guys, I think I&#39;ll do the mail in option with the government.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think the agencies like &quot;easy&quot; cost more actually.

				&nbsp;They do cost a bit more. Its more for people who need to renew there passport in a rush and don&#39;t feel like dealing with the Post office! But it is always good to have a second option.<br /><br />Good luck!
