				I went to PS 17, and then IS 126. I enjoyed 17, but 126 was not a pleasant experience in the 1970s, very tough existence. Not sure if it was different in the 1980s.<br /><br />NYCMacUser, you must have gone to PS 5 instead for grade school then. It burned down in the late 1960s.

				IS 126 was still pretty tough in the 80&#039;s.&nbsp; But I was in the accelerated &quot;SP&quot; program (we all skipped ninth grade as a result of the program), so FOR THE MOST PART, we were isolated a bit from the typical goings-on at the school.

				I went to both... graduated PS 17 in 1980, IS 126 in 1983 (and was also in the SP program).<br /><br />Things have changed A LOT in those schools. A few years ago I was handling a case where my client (the defendant) was in a school hallway putting a headlock on another kid until the kid passes out and falls to the ground. My client then kicks the kid to see if he&#039;s conscious. I&#039;m watching the video of the incident (yes, many NYC schools have video cameras these days) and I&#039;m thinking, &quot;Wow, that hallway looks familiar!&quot; and sure enough, it was at 126. I don&#039;t remember that happening back in the day.<br /><br />Scary, but I&#039;ve been getting A LOT of clients coming out of IS 126 lately...

				Barrister, any teachers from IS 126 stand out for you?<br /><br />Mrs. Friedman (science) and Mrs. Seever (english) were my favorites.&nbsp; At the time they seemed really tough, but 20+ years later, I know they were everything that teachers should be (especially in a school where 80-85% of the student body were problematic).<br /><br />I also recall the Hoffmans (Mr. and Mrs.) and that crazy science teacher guy (can&#039;t recall his name).&nbsp; I&#039;m sure there are some other teachers that I recall, but not as vividly.

And I had a woman with a Jamaican accent for Spanish... I can picture my teachers, but for the life of me I can&#039;t remember many of their names. <br /><br />I remember the principal at the time -- Ms. Vogt -- who was really nice and totally dedicated to the kids, but was a packrat. I remember she drove me home once and her car was filled with old newspapers. I think she passed away about 15 years ago.<br /><br />I remember leaving school in the middle of the day on Wednesdays to go get buy one, get one free sundaes at the Carvel in the shopping center next door... good times.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				HOCHMAN, that&#039;s right.&nbsp; I had them both as teachers, and the Mr. was also my homeroom teacher in the 6th grade.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know what you mean about remembering a lot of the teachers, but not their names.&nbsp; <br /><br />I remember the African-American typing teacher (she was pretty mean, as I recall)...and the two vocal teachers (one was named Mrs. Patterson, I think)...also the two old lady girl&#039;s gym teachers...and the older-than-dirt librarian (I worked in there once or twice a week).&nbsp; I think I also remember that Spanish teacher.<br /><br />Mrs. Vogt!&nbsp; Never had much in the way of dealings with her.&nbsp; I also think I recall that there was this pervvy male teacher.<br /><br />Wow weird.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t thought very much about these people.&nbsp; JHS seems so far away.&nbsp; I guess it is though...more than 22 years ago.&nbsp; WOW!<br /><br />

				yes, yes, yes.....Mr. Stokes.&nbsp; I think you&#039;re right.&nbsp; I thought you said you were bad at names?!&nbsp; I also remember Mr. Berger.

				wow, all them old teacher names ring a bell... I was only in 126 a year... I did a tour of all the neighb&#039; schools. &#039;the mini school&#039; -&gt; ps 17 -&gt; ps 171, -&gt; is 126, -&gt; jhs 204. I broke family tradition by heading to Art &amp; Design for high school though... I hated just about all of my classmates while I was in the area, so A&amp;D was a good distance from everyone I knew... much better times.<br /><br />126 was definitely rougher around the edges than the others. I recall finding a crack vile in a desk there...<br /><br />PS 5 - one of my cousins was in there the day it burned if I recall right. All those fire drills paid off with everyone out no problem.

				P.S.5 burned down Wednesday, April 12th, 1967.<br />Huge 5 alarm fire.<br />You should have seen it!<br />Each grade was sent to a different school, temporarily. <br />I was in the 5th grade. We were sent to P.S.171 on 29th Avenue. Pretty close to where I lived so I was lucky.<br />Across the street the brand new P.S.17 was still under construction, but it was finished enough that we were allowed to use it for the last month of that school year. &#128515; First time I ever saw green blackboards!<br /><br /><br />I.S.126 was very tough! Too many fights!<br />Mrs Vogt was still principal well into the 80s? <br />I remember Mr. Stokes! He was popular.
