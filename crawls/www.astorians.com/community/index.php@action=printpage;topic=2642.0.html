				i&#39;ve been.&nbsp; at first i just ordered stuff to go and usually that&#39;s still fine for me.&nbsp; it stacks up well compared to bai sushi in my opinion although it&#39;s not as creative (certainly not as creative as jj&#39;s around the corner), but it&#39;s f-a-s-t.&nbsp; i can recommend the mango lover appetizer.&nbsp; if you&#39;re looking for atmosphere i&#39;d still go with jj&#39;s fusion as i&#39;m picky about atmosphere and tend to go for more cozy environments and jj&#39;s is definitely homespun, not a chain.&nbsp; still, the staff at ginza are very nice and when i did do the sit-down meal there we had a very nice time and the food was good.

				We&#39;ve ordered from them a few times now and each time the food has been very good. We&#39;ve mostly gotten the appetizers and the rolls, but we haven&#39;t been disappointed. The rolls have been very fresh and tasty. The lady that takes the order is very sweet and she always puts some Japanese candy into our bag, free of charge. (Free candy is always a plus!!)&nbsp; <br /><br />Is it the best Japanese I&#39;ve ever had? Probably not, but it&#39;s definitely a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Now with this place and JJ&#39;s, I&#39;m finally happy with the sushi options in the area.&nbsp; :-)<br />&nbsp;

				I hit Ginza last week with some friends. We did the all you can eat deal. <br /><br />$18.95 for unlimited sushi, soup salad, and appetizers. it comes with a free drink too.<br /><br />PLUS, they don&#39;t have their liquor license yet, so if you ask for sake, its free.<br /><br />The sushi was good. Fresh fish, big variety on the All You Can Eat menu. Definitely worth the money.<br /><br />And after 3 or 4 bottles of free sake, the meal is awesome by default.<br /><br />If you want great sushi, i suggest JJ&#39;s, but if you want to practice sloth and gluttony, go to Ginza.

				OK, I tried this place with a few other Astorians and thought it was pretty excellent for all you can eat sushi.&nbsp; We paid only $16.95 for all you can eat soup, salad, appetizers, and sushi.&nbsp; We ate dumplings and sushi, with tea at the end.&nbsp; There was no sake to be had, but that was ok.&nbsp; The sushi was good and fresh and substantial.&nbsp; There was a good amount of variety in the sushi choices, too.&nbsp; We stuffed ourselves and were VERY happy with it all.&nbsp; Great taste!&nbsp; Great value!&nbsp; Check it out. :mrgreen:

				We tried calling Ginza on Wednesday night for delivery, but there was no answer. When I was walking home from the R train tonight around 6pm, I noticed that all the lights were out and it was closed. (I was in a rush, so didn&#39;t cross the street to see if there was a sign on the door.)<br /><br />Does anyone know if they are closed for a long holiday weekend or if they have closed for good?<br /><br />:-(
