				I&#039;m starting a little jewelry company. It&#039;s called Firelight Jewelry.<br />I&#039;m making earrings right now and am planning on expanding when i have a better set up to work with.<br />I started a MySpace page to get the word out and guage interest. I know I know, doing this on MySpace is kind of cliche but it&#039;s an easy way to start and show what i have going on. <br />So please check out the page:<br />http://www.myspace.com/firelightjewelry<br />and if you like what you see, friendquest me, leave me a comment and spread the love to your friends.<br />And post here! <br />If you want to buy something (i will love you forever) email me through myspace or at firelightjewelry@gmail.com<br /><br />I&#039;ll be shopping my collection around Astoria soon, to hopefully place a few pieces in boutiques. I&#039;ll also be starting a shop on etsy.com but i&#039;m taking this one small step at a time. <br /><br />Also, my arists, anyone want to help me design my logo and mascot? I know what i want the mascot to be/look like. Unfortunatly my hands cannot replecate the picture in my head. And i have no graphic design skills whatsoever. Gals will be rewarded with a free pair of earrings of your choice. Dudes either get earrings (for your woman, your mom, you, whatever floats your boat) or a homemade dinner.<br /><br />Thanks for the support everyone!<br />Jenn<br />(PS-my, as of now, 1 friend is me. if there&#039;s more than 1 then I&#039;m numero uno. in case inquiring minds wanted to know. and if we aren&#039;t myspace buddies, hit up miss jennifer with some love).

				Yes i plan to in the near future. i started with limited funds and already blew through all of it. i&#039;m reinvesting the small profit i have made so far (courtesy of my awesome mom shilling for me at work) into more supplies, posts and lever backs included. my hope is to be able to interchange the hooks to what people prefer. but for right now, i just have the french hooks and another kind that isn&#039;t as sturdy as the ones you mentioned but it does close, later i will try and post a pic of that hook.<br />Thanks for the compliment!&nbsp; :-)

				Those are lovely!&nbsp; I want a pair!&nbsp; I&#039;d love to see them in person before I buy.&nbsp; Like, to see the true colors and feel the weight and so on.&nbsp; You should set up a stand at a street fair or something.&nbsp;

				I do have them on flickr but without prices.<br />i actually read their rules and it says that users are expressly forbidden from using flikr to sell anything. if you are flagged as doing that your account will be terminated.<br />so you can see them on flikr-same username as here...but just don&#039;t ask me about prices over flickr or else i may disappear! and i just started using it! and am slowly getting addicted<br /><br />i have a business card, but need to redo it once i have the real website set up. <br />i can not wait to move so that i have a better computer set up. contrary to what one may think, using your bed as a desk chair is not comfy.

				Firelight Jewelry will (finally) be showing off and selling its wares this Saturday with the Astoria Craft Collective.<br />Stop by the patio of craftiness tomorrow between 11 and 5pm for the trunk sale. There will be free refreshments and other local crafters selling their wares. Come by, have a snacky, view some merch and support local artisans. Or stop by and say hello, we&#039;ll be there a while and it&#039;s always nice to make friends. <br />If you want a sneak peek at my stuff check this out: http://www.flickr.com/gp/7550875@N08/ft4rd2<br />I&#039;ll be adding a few updates today, i hope.<br /><br />Hope to see some familiar faces, and meet some new ones!<br /><br />Jenn
