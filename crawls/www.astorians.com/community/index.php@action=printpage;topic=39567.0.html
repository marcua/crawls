				<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: medium;" class="bbc_size">This apartment, on the 2nd floor of a two-family house (landlord lives on first floor) is a short 5-minute walk to Steinway Street train station, and has an eat-in kitchen, large bathroom, foyer with large closet, and plenty of windows. One bedroom is much larger than the other (hence the 1.5), and so might be better used for a child or as an office space, although two roommates could decide to forgo the living room, making it a decent share. The apartment gets lots of light, morning and afternoon. Well-trained, vaccinated pets are welcomed (a dog and two cats live on first floor). Photos here (http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/abo/5841667013.html).</span></span><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Total space in apartment is about 585 square feet. There is a substantial hallway storage closet, and a landing. The window treatments shown in photos are optional. Heat/cooking gas &amp; water included; tenant pays electricity. The apartment is on the top floor of house, so there is no noise overhead.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;The apartment is within walking distance of supermarkets, coffee shops, bakeries, the post office, and the Queens Borough Public Library, in a neighborhood rich with restaurants, shopping and cultural institutions. In short, this neighborhood ROCKS, and you can be at Lexington Avenue in 20 minutes if all is going well. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;First and last months&#039; rent, along with a $300 refundable security deposit, are required on move-in. Apartment viewing by appointment. Application requires two most recent pay stubs, a credit report produced within the last 15 days, and contact information for most recent previous landlord.
