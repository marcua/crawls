				Hi.&nbsp; If you haven&#39;t read my &quot;Sell Me On Astoria&quot; post in Local Chat, allow me to reintroduce myself: I&#39;m a 23-year-old male who has been living in New York City for a year in the Upper West Side.&nbsp; I have a studio there and will be paying $1300+ a month if I decide to resign my lease on January 31st.&nbsp; Even though I like my area a lot, I&#39;m not too thrilled about paying $1300 for a pre-war studio with a kitchenette and no major renovations (even though that is still a well below market price for whee I&#39;m at).&nbsp; So, because of this, I&#39;m checking out Astoria, before I decide whether to resign my present lease.<br /><br />Basically, I&#39;m looking for a 1 bedroom apartment below for $1300 and below.&nbsp; I don&#39;t really have any prerequisites other than that I cannot possibly deal with bed bugs.&nbsp; I have some preferences, though, so I&#39;ll list them here: as much space as possible (duh), newly (gut?) renovated, a dishwasher, near some decent bars, rent stabilized, no broker fee, comes with supermodel.<br /><br />Obviously beggers can&#39;t be choosers and I haven&#39;t given myself much time here, nor do I know what all I can expect to get for $1300, but I&#39;m determined to at least see some stuff before the 31st.&nbsp; <br /><br />My Father, who will be the guarantor, is coming up this weekend to help me make a decision, so if anyone knows of anything that will be available in the near future, please let me know.&nbsp; I&#39;m aware of craigslist and backpage.com, but maybe you guys know of some stuff that I don&#39;t.

				start calling about places on craigslist. set up appointments for saturday to go out and see places.<br />you should meet with as many people as possible, because you want to see as many places as possible, especially if your dad is coming down with you and will need to sign the paperwork.<br /><br />1300 is more than reasonalbe for a 1br here, you should have no problem finding something.

				$1300 is a good amount and you&#39;ll have no problem finding a good place for such.&nbsp; If you look up the thread &quot;Does anyone know about 25-96 36th Street&quot;, there are some great posts concerning bedbugs and how to avoid them.<br /><br />Good luck and welcome to the neighborhood!

				Also check out the ads in the Village Voice, which is how I found my no-fee 2 bedroom for $1400.&nbsp; No supermodel, but we like the place.&nbsp; &nbsp;:wink: <br /><br />Good luck!
