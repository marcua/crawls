				I got the word yesterday that they&#039;re going to open next weekend!!<br /><br />They&#039;re located on 30th Avenue and 45th St where the Gold Coast Liquor store used to be.&nbsp; <br /><br />The place inside looks great!&nbsp; &nbsp;If they spend half and effort stocking the store as they did on fixing it, it will be a much welcome addition to the &#039;hood.&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br />I&#039;m not even a &quot;wine guy&quot; but I&#039;m even looking foward to their opening.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />(and i&#039;m not just saying that because they let me have some eucalyptis (however you spell it) scraps from when they did the floor&nbsp; &nbsp;:angel: )

				OK, so they didn&#039;t open last weekend, but I was just inside and the place looks great.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think they&#039;re waiting for everything to be perfect to avoid all the bumps usually associated with starting a business.<br /><br />This weekend should be it.<br /><br />(them not opening last weekend also gives me a chance to bump the thread)&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				Has anyone else stopped into Off the Vine yet?&nbsp; My better half and I went in after brunch on Sunday and were really impressed with how they not only managed to make the place look about a billion times more attractive than the shop that was there before, the wine selection was really nice.&nbsp; I&#039;m really impressed by this place, and will be stopping in regularly.

				This place is a lot nicer than most of the other liquor stores around.&nbsp; I for one am a big Chardonnay drinker and was surprised that they didn&#039;t have much of a Californian selection.&nbsp; Hopefully they will add more.&nbsp; They did have some from Long Island which was nice to see.&nbsp; I tried one that was excellent.&nbsp; <br /><br />The owner(s) are also very friendly.
