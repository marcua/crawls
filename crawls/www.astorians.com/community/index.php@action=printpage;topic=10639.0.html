				Hello helpful, resourceful board.<br /><br />I am turning 25 during labor day weekend. I want to have a bday party to celebrate not only this, but the end of my fellowship and the start of my graduate school career. This will also be a joint bday party with a close friend who has a bday several days later. But being that labor day weekend is always a problem (I have almost 25 years of experience to attest to that) I will probably have the party the weekend before. I was entertaining the idea of having a party in Astoria/Long Island City, although Pete&#039;s Candy Store looks like it may be promising as well. Here is what I am thinking of:<br /><br />A bar or bar friendly restaurant. I think we may all congregate in the mid-afternoon and go on into the evening.<br /><br />I am expecting a minimum of 15 people, probably not to exceed 25.<br /><br />Pete&#039;s Candy Store sounded cool because you can rent out the back garden and set up an open tab bar situation for a very reasonable fee (around $400 or so) but I would like to be closer to home.<br /><br />I am nervous about trying for the beer garden because I want everyone to sit together.<br /><br />I would love it if I could find a place where I could negotiate having an open bar for my party- it&#039;s so much nicer not to have to deal with cash throughout the day but this is not a deal breaker. <br /><br />Any suggestions??

				I have three suggestions:<br />1) Indigo -- I think you can negotiate a deal with them for the back patio area.<br />2) El Baseuro on Steinway between B&#039;way and 34th Avenue is a ton of fun and a great place to celebrate a b-day.<br />3) Cavo
