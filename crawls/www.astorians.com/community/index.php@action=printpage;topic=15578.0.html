				So, I&#039;d thought I&#039;d start a thread with the best value deals you&#039;ve been finding when you dine around Astoria, Manhattan, and beyond.<br /><br />I&#039;ll throw out two to start. One I&#039;ve just discovered, and the other was an oldie but goodie.<br /><br />DiWine: $10 for an individual brick oven, thin crust pizza. This pizza is about 10&quot;. It is really really good if you like thin. The topping choices on their menu are awesome combinations (The breakfast pizza and the &quot;Gigi,&quot; are two of note) and when you make your own it still costs the same. Another great thing-Happy Hour is 2 for 1!!!! Sun-Thur 5-8 pm.<br /><br />Spice Market (yes, of <em>the</em> Jean George): $48/pp for a 5 course tasting menu. And I don&#039;t mean a 1&quot; morself of food for most of these things. They were good size portions for each of the items. The only thing is the whole table has to order, but it&#039;s an incredible feast that we ended up taking part of home. And it&#039;s 5 courses, but <strong>10 different dishes</strong>. Just incredible. If you like to be adventurous with your food and like the Thai/Asian/ Indian fusion stuff, this is just a great meal. Highly recommend it. As soon as I was done eating it, I wanted to go back for another night. The space is also really beautiful and would make for an awesome group get together/special night out.

				I think Vesta is a pretty good bang-for-your-buck place. Especially with their $7-9 pizzas.

				I just tried the Gigi pizza at DiWine the other night, and it was quite tasty. &nbsp;Much larger than I expected, too. &nbsp;However, their crust is bland - a little salt would help. &nbsp;<br /><br />paratactical is right about Vesta. &nbsp;The food there is a great deal overall!<br /><br />I will have to check out this Mombar deal - sounds awesome!

				Oh! Also, brunch at Michael&#039;s on Broadway is a great deal. Two drinks and a big plate of food for $12 or so? Awesome!

				La Papa! It is a feast in a potato for only $6. Unless you get the chili con carne or a sliced hot dog in it- then it&#039;s $6.50. <br /><br />Also, on a slightly nicer level, Ovelia is a great value for brunch. For dinner also, if you order off the lunch menu. They let us do that this past Sunday, not sure if they do that every weekday or if it&#039;s just a weekend thing. The two of us had a delicious dinner, including iced teas, for around $24 total.

				Last night I went to Bel Aire for a cheeseburger (regular, not &quot;deluxe&quot;).&nbsp; I thought the waiter was bringing me a dish of coleslaw, but it turned out to be a dish of beets &amp; onions and a dish of chickpeas &amp; onions.&nbsp; <em>Then</em> came the big dish of coleslaw (and a pickle).&nbsp; The burger was large.&nbsp; I had a rootbeer, and was thinking about asking if they gave free refills when the waiter refilled it without my even having to ask!&nbsp; That was a <em>very</em> filling, very satisfying meal!&nbsp; The bill came to $8.13 with tax (not including the tip).&nbsp; You could easily run up a bill like that at nearby McD or White Castle and not get nearly the same amount of food or nutrition! <br /><br />(Bel Aire a diner on 21st Street at Broadway.&nbsp; They are open 24 hours a day.)

				Pork Kebab at the cart on SW corner of 31st ave and Steinway.&nbsp; $2.50(?) with hunk o bread.&nbsp; Filling and you get free people watching.&nbsp; <br /><br />Monster sized iced tea at Panera Breads for $2.<br /><br />Natural Tofu on Queens blvd and 40th street.&nbsp; Any of the stews for around $8 with bowl of rice and lots of little apps throughout the meal.&nbsp; I love this place.&nbsp; The pan of sizzling squid with onions ($12) just plain rocks. Goodly amount of squid too.<br /><br />Can&#039;t wait to try Spice Market for that tasting menu.&nbsp; Thanks for the heads up.<br /><br />
