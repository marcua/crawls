				So my parents are coming into town this weekend and we wanted to find somewhere to get food in Astoria at least Friday night and maybe a lunch sometime.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got the brunch places down pretty well, but I&#039;ve already taken them to all my Ditmars-dinner staples. I was thinking about Il Bambino, but I wanted to see if there were any recommendations for a not too expensive but comfy and quiet place. <br /><br />I am browsing through other threads, but I thought I&#039;d ask. My mom is real adventurous and would love to try a different cuisine or something that she can&#039;t get in our rural hometown. My dad, however, can be a bit of a stick-in-the-mud, so I&#039;m faced with the battle of finding a place where he can get a more moderated staple, but he usually finds something he likes. They both love seafood, but I&#039;m not so crazy about it. Greek would be awesome, but something else would be cool as we usually go Greek (how can you not in Astoria!)<br /><br />I would love to go somewhere in the Broadway or 36th Ave area as we&#039;ve never eaten down there when they&#039;ve been out. Y&#039;all are the best!

				What are the Ditmars dinner staples you&#039;ve already taken them to?<br /><br />Have you ever been to Kebab Cafe or Mombar?&nbsp; I&#039;ve never seen a menu at Kebab Cafe so that might be a little tricky for your dad, but Mombar does have a written menu and there are several dishes that I think are accessible for a less-adventurous palate.&nbsp; The decor is really eclectic and I bet your mom would love it.&nbsp; Here&#039;s (http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/mombar/menus/main.html) the menu from NY Mag.<br /><br />I&#039;ll also throw in a vote for Bistro 33 (http://www.lilbistro33.com/) any day.&nbsp; Neither Mombar nor Bistro 33 is dirt cheap, but both can be reasonable if you order with a bit of care.

				Honestly, I won&#039;t go to Bistro 33 because of an incident involving the chef and a friend of mine. It&#039;s a bit of a gossip type story, so I don&#039;t want to spread it, but just leave it at the &quot;never getting my money&quot; stance.<br /><br />Never been to Mombar.<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken them to Wave Thai, 718 (not their style, didn&#039;t go over well), that Taverna Kylca?? however you spell it and the two Greek restaurants on 23rd Ave just back a block or two from 31st.<br /><br />Mojave wouldn&#039;t be right for them as there is a really exquisite South Western style place back home.<br /><br />I guess I was kind of hoping to go to another area of Astoria since Ditmars is basically all they see. I thought it would be nice to traverse a bit and check out a different place that none of us have been to. <br /><br />Mombar, however, might be a good choice, judging by the menu.

				I recently took some visiting family members to Valverde and it went over very, very well. Not only is the food always good, but it&#039;s nice for a wide variety of tastes because they have seafood, pasta, and chicken (to name just a few things). They even specially made a chicken parm for one particularly fussy member of the group.

				Michael&#039;s Restaurant<br />33-17 Broadway <br />(718) 726-7474<br /><br />They have quite the entensive menu that should be able to appease your pops and find something different for you and your mom, and they have pretty good Greek as well.&nbsp; They have old pictures of Astoria from the first half of the 20th century on the walls, if that type of thing interests you.

				The Trattoria is a little too nice for us but Michael&#039;s is way too diner.<br /><br />Mombar, Valverde and the Brazilian and Columbian places sound cool. I will be looking through menus and trying to see what seems right. I usually try to give them options, too!<br /><br />Thanks, guys for all the ideas. Keep &#039;em coming.

				Sorry to hijack the thread, but in a similar vein... any suggestions for Easter dinner/brunch with my 92 year old Grandmother? (she&#039;s lived in the &#039;hood for the last 58 years, so we&#039;ve pretty much hit all the local staples at some point) I was thinking Greek (since we&#039;re Armenian, it&#039;s the next best thing around here :)). Greek Easter is later this year, isn&#039;t it?<br />

				I just ate at Zenon Taverna (next to Il Bambino) and loved it.&nbsp; Tons of food and a very extensive menu.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had some tasty pasta dishes at Michael Angelo&#039;s, plus their Sophia Loren is the best pizza I&#039;ve had in Astoria.<br /><br />Walima (Moroccan) is supposed to be great, and serves familiar meats with a level of adventuresome that isn&#039;t too extreme.<br /><br />JJ&#039;s is supposed to be really good, too.

				How about:<br />Waterfront Crab House <br />2-03 Borden Avenue <br />Astoria, NY 11101 <br />718-729-4862<br /><br />The &#039;rents can have their seafood and you can have pasta or a nice steak.

				Agnati,the Greek restuarant down by the park is a great place to take visitors. You can order all mezdes and share. It&#039;s also not that expensive and the food is delicious!&nbsp; I would also recommend El Olivo - 31street. Their paella is great! as well as their sangria!<br />Have fun!

				I would recommend Mundo on 32nd St. right off Broadway.&nbsp; The food is adventurous but definitely some basics can be found.&nbsp; Or if you want to have Greek, but try a different place, why not check out Aliada on Broadway and 29th St.&nbsp; Another idea is Aces on 36th Ave., but that might be more on the romantic side.&nbsp; Have fun with the &#039;rents!

				I vote Opa! I don&#039;t know much about out-of-town parents, but I have noticed that just about every single weekend evening I&#039;ve gone to Opa, there is one table that has exactly that; some 20-something Astorian with their out-of-town parents and siblings. The waitress seems to love that type of thing, too, as I&#039;ve seen her explain the different dishes, just ask her to recommend something, tell her that you&#039;re parents are visiting and they&#039;re not familiar with Greek food, and she will totally help! Personally, I would recommend the Saganaki for an appetizer, it&#039;s fried cheese (one big thing piece) dosed in rum and flambéed in front of you, so it&#039;s exciting and delicious. And the lamb there is to DIE for. They have fish, steak, burgers, and best of all - kebab. <br /><br />I sound like a commercial. Did I mention its awesome conversation atmosphere?<br /><br />31st between 30th ave and newtown road, near zodiac.

				I second Zenon Taverna...it&#039;s almost Greek, more Cypriot, technically, but very similair things and you can find affordable food and their menu selection is extensive which would accomodate both parents. <br /><br />My second suggestion is Leng Thai—most of the main entrees there are under $18 and again, I think both your parents will find what they like. If your dad is a meat and potatoes guy, I love their ribs-fantastic! It&#039;s also a really beautiful space.&nbsp; (http://lengthainewyork.com/menu.html)<br />

				We ended up going to Mombar on Friday night. It was great and the perfect atmosphere for us. We got to linger and try some stuff that&#039;s really pretty different from our normal fare.<br /><br />On Saturday, we got bagels at Astoria Bagel on Ditmars and then walked down Ditmars &amp; then Steinway to the MoMI area. We got coffee and lemonades at Cafe Bar before going to the museum, then took a walk through Socrates before going to the Columbian restaurant on Broadway and 33rd. <br /><br />This morning, we got muffins and juice at Igloo.<br /><br />All in all, a great weekend of food!

It was great and the perfect atmosphere for us. We got to linger and try some stuff that&#039;s really pretty different from our normal fare.<br /><br />On Saturday, we got Lender&#039;s bagels at C Town on Ditmars and then walked down Ditmars &amp; then Steinway to the MoMI area. We got coffee and lemonades at McDonalds before going to the museum, then took a walk through Socrates before going to the Cold Stone Creamery on Broadway and 33rd. <br /><br />This morning, we got muffins and juice at Dunkin Donuts.<br /><br />All in all, a great weekend of food!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That sounds like an awesome weekend!!&nbsp; :wink:
