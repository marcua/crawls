				From November 8-11 2007 The Queens International Film Festival returns to the streets of Astoria with plenty of events for all who share the love of the silver screen.&nbsp; Our mission is to not only create an event that appeals to the industry, but an event for the general public and everyday film lovers of Queens.&nbsp; More importantly, however, we want to spur much needed economic activity in our neighborhoods.&nbsp; What better way to support local businesses than to bring people in from near and far for an unforgettable event?&nbsp; <br /><br />In this, our fifth year, we’re anticipating over 20,000 attendees from all areas, all backgrounds, and all ages.&nbsp; There is always something for everyone at the Queens International Film Festival, and this year is bigger and more jam packed than ever.&nbsp; This year’s festival will include a very special youth program designed to expose at-risk kids from the five boroughs to the inspiring and expressive medium of film.&nbsp; Our Music Lounge will be featuring local, as well as, international singing sensations.&nbsp; We have seminars such as Women In Film, which will be hosted by the legendary Chazz and Gianna Palminteri.&nbsp; Cultural diversity and the great mix of Queens ethnicities will be celebrated as we honor minority achievements in film.&nbsp; Currently, we are in talks to award Queens Natives John Leguizamo and Lucy Liu, for their contributions to the silver screen.&nbsp; We will also be having book signings, screenplay readings, gala parties, and over 300 film screenings including several Academy Award entries, and several films made right here in Queens.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now we recognize that times are tough and that there is a great deal of uncertainty weighing on everyone’s minds.&nbsp; However, the support of our local organization’s is especially integral in our continuing to celebrate the magic and rich history of Queens and Astoria.&nbsp; We have dedicated ourselves to creating an event for both the film community and most importantly our community.&nbsp; On behalf of our organization and the people of Queens, we would like to invite you to be a partner of the Queens International Film Festival.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />If you have any questions you can reach me directly any time at (908) 310-1659, or email me at jmlara@comcast.net.&nbsp; <br /><br />I truly hope that we can count on your support as we work to make the star of the boroughs shine brighter than ever.<br /><br />All my best,<br /><br />Joseph M.
