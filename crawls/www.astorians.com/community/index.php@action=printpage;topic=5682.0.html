				This could be considered a rant, but it deals with creativity, so that&#039;s why it&#039;s in this topic...<br /><br />So I&#039;m watching Def Poetry on HBO tonight, and almost all the poets have the exact same aggresive &quot;tough&quot; inflection.&nbsp; It gets so boring after a while.&nbsp; I can&#039;t really hear the actual poetry because the way it&#039;s being recited is the same from every &quot;poet.&quot;&nbsp; When did this happen?&nbsp; Reciting poetry is a form of performance, and just with music, there are other methods to recite poetry.&nbsp; Hearing the same kind of music over and over gets boring, as does monotonous poetry recitation.&nbsp; Fast spoken phrases followed by a quick inhalation to catch their breath to continue on with their recital.&nbsp; It all lacks subtlety and finess, high and low, variation, etc...&nbsp; This takes away from the actual words they recite.<br /><br />Now perhaps it&#039;s because this is a specific style of poetry for this show.&nbsp; But if not, it is unfortunate.&nbsp; I guess I&#039;d have to see some more poetry open mics around here to see what people are doing around here.&nbsp; Other than that, poetry has gone the way of pop-music.&nbsp; Formulaic.

				I think the style you are referrng to is &quot;slam&quot;. I kind of like it, actually. But I do see what you mean. <br /><br />I think if you went to a regular open mic you would probably hear different styles of reading.

				JTrane, this phenomenon is not new for poetry in general, not just slam poetry. That has been my pet peeve for hearing readings throughout the city. As if, there is only &quot;one voice&quot; for reading poems. I&#039;m sure beat poetry when it was performed carried its own rhythm; and poems, no matter by whom written, were probably pronounced the same way. In school, my poetry classes, and even in grad school, were filled with more of the same. I tried to stay away from that in my own readings because ultimately, it was never genuine to the content of the poem. Rap/slap/slam poetry is probably more susceptible to a one-note sound. However, you&#039;ll find that differences do exist, and you will find them from time to time at different places around the city: St. Mark&#039;s Poetry Project, Cornelia St. Cafe, KGB bar, and some others....

				There really isn&#039;t any one &quot;Modern day poetry&quot;: contemporary poetry in the U.S. is made up of an incredibly diverse array of styles and voices, the &quot;Poetry Slam&quot; community is just one sort of limb on the tree of contemporary poetry--with its own array of styles and tendencies.&nbsp; <br /><br />Being in the metro-NYC area you are pretty much at ground zero for a good portion of the various poetry subcultures in U.S. today; pretty much any weekend day, or really any day of the week, even, you will find and incredible variety of poets reading their work, most of the time for free: The Poetry Project at St. Mark&#039;s church is a venerable NYC poetry institution where you are going to find a lot of different voices, from &quot;famous&quot; poets to more unknown ones--there is a Monday night series (which I myself read at recently) which features many younger voices from many different parts of the poetry map.&nbsp; Likewise, the Bowery Poetry club features a pretty vast array of different events from &quot;slammy&quot; type poets to the &quot;avant garde&quot; (though what, exactly, the &quot;avant garde&quot; of American poetry is is a subject of constant and sometimes bitter debate among practitioners of poetry in the U.S.)--there is also a series put on by an online magazine called MiPOesias which does readings at the Stain Bar in Brooklyn pretty regularly, there is a good series at the Zinc bar every Sunday night where you will also find a lot of younger and more obscure voices: the KGB Bar generally features more well known poets (it is hard to get a reading there if you don&#039;t have a book out, etc., although not impossible), there&#039;s Pete&#039;s Candy Store in Brooklyn, The Cornelia Street Cafe, The Ear-Inn and lots of other venues in Manhattan.&nbsp; And these are just venues that are involved with the sort of subgroup of poetry that I myself am involved in.&nbsp; The Poet&#039;s House in Manhattan is another good source of information and events as well.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been to many readings in Queens, though another Astoria-based poet acquaintance of mine has castigated me for saying there are no readings in Queens, so if you were to look specifically for poetry events in Queens, you would find those as well.&nbsp; I have been to a couple of good readings at the Noguchi museum.&nbsp; But if you are interested in getting an idea of what is going on in poetry today, there are many, many resources; and you will find that there are many, many poets who diverge from the model you are lamenting in your post above.<br /><br />Open mics are nice because they offer a forum for poets who may not have made any poetry-world connections yet, and who are at different points in their career.&nbsp; I have to confess that I am not a fan of Open Mics because sometimes there are folks who haven&#039;t really developed good reading abilities, and just aren&#039;t that committed to the work (this is a gross and unfair generalization on my part) and sometimes it can be painful to watch, as a person who has more or less invested my entire life in the medium.&nbsp; If you find yourself frustrated by the conventions that many readers who are still trying to find their voice and their reading style sometimes fall into, I would definitely recommend going to see some &quot;non-open&quot; readings--which will most of the time feature poets who have been consciously developing their reading skills for some time.<br /><br />There definitely is a &quot;poet voice&quot; style that many poets use when reading their work, which drives me crazy as well--but this voice is something that a good many poets strive to break out of, and the strategies that they use to do so are pretty diverse.&nbsp; For example, depending on what work I am reading, sometimes I work towards a flattening of affect that is somewhat like chanting, but for other work I will read in a more &quot;speechy&quot; and emotionally inflected voice--though the &quot;poet voice&quot; is something one can unwittingly find oneself falling into at times.&nbsp; Reading, like writing, is a skill that poets develop through the course of their careers, and you&#039;ll find some poets who are better at it than others, some poets you might like on the page, but not their reading voices, etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />But I definitely recommend checking out any and all of the events I mention above if you are interested in hearing diverse reading and writing styles!&nbsp; There&#039;s nothing we poets love more than finding non-poets at readings, since it is often hard to get non-poets to come to readings, probably because of some of the stereotypes you mention above.&nbsp; But there is so much more to performed poetry, which you will find is there for you if you look for it! And it is great that you care enough to be frustrated!<br /><br /><br />
