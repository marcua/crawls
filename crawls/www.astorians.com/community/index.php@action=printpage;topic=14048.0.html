				HI! I&#039;m posting this for my friend.&nbsp; Her Nanny really is wonderful!<br /><br />&nbsp;Hello, my name is Marianne, I was just laid off from my job. I am helping my current Nanny find a new job. <br />Her name is Nicole. I cannot say enough wonderful things about her. We love her very much and are sad we have to let her go. I highly recommend her to any family that is looking for a full time nanny. She has nurtured my little girl from the age of 3 months into her toddler years. My daughter loves this woman. She is a loving, flexible, honest, dependable, energetic, respectable, and a hard working person. A real gem. She has experience with newborns, toddlers, and young school age children <br /><br />Nicole is seeking for a full time live out Mon-Fri position. <br />She will provide your kids with a safe environment, keeping them busy reading, singing, writing, arts and crafts, sports, arranging play dates. library visits etc <br /><br />I highly recommend her and she also has other great references from previous families. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Dear Marianne,<br /><br />I am a new mother - our little boy was just born on March 22nd - and my husband and I are just beginning our search for childcare in the Astoria area.&nbsp; Though, due to the nature of my job, we would not need a sitter full-time, we would need someone at least three days a week.&nbsp; If you feel your former nanny might be interested in speaking with us, I would really love to speak with her - she sounds terrific!&nbsp; <br /><br />Please feel free to pass along my email address, and she and I can work out a time to interview.&nbsp; <br />Thanks for your help!<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Amanda Williams<br />amh821@aol.com

				Hello Marianne, <br /><br />I just gave birth to a little boy on April 1st. I am currently on maternity leave, going back to work in three months. I need to start interviewing people for a possible nanny position. I am looking for someone Full Time. Not sure if Nicole has already found herself a job, but I would be interested in getting to know her and receiving more information. If both you and Nicole can call me and/or email me to discuss, that would be great.<br /><br />Elke<br />elkelorraine1@gmail.com<br />917-640-1434
