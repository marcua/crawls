				This thread was extremely helpful as background, but I didn&#039;t want to bump something from last summer:&nbsp; http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=10755.15<br /><br />Anyway, having begun to take taxis from LGA to the vicinity of Steinway &amp; Broadway, I wanted to figure out the most direct route to request.&nbsp; I know it won&#039;t have much of an effect on the fare, but I&#039;d like to minimize travel time and look like less of a rube.&nbsp; Last time, the driver took the GCP to the 31st/Hoyt exit and doubled back on Astoria Blvd to Steinway.&nbsp; This wasn&#039;t too much of a detour, but involved lots of traffic at 31st.&nbsp; Google Maps suggests the BQE to Broadway.&nbsp; I was thinking perhaps just Astoria Blvd directly to Steinway - and I believe a few people alluded to this route in the previous thread.&nbsp; Any thoughts?<br /><br />Thanks!

				Either the Astoria Boulevard exit and a left onto Steinway, or if there is traffic right outside of the airport, I will get off at exit 5 (81st St), take a left and then a right onto Astoria Blvd, and go from there.&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine that there is a quicker/more efficient way than either of these 2.

				OK, thanks - good to know I&#039;m not too far off.&nbsp; Does &quot;Astoria Blvd exit&quot; mean exiting the airport directly onto Astoria Blvd (over by the car rental area and the Marine Terminal access road) -- i.e. I&#039;m not missing some other opportunity to exit the GCP onto Astoria Blvd between 81st and 31st)?

				Google maps was way off advising to take the BQE to Broadway to Steinway St, that is like 25 blocks with lights. I second what speebs said.

				Weird, I just looked at a map and it doesn&#039;t match up with what&#039;s in my head at all. Ignore what I said about the &quot;Astoria Boulevard&quot; exit- I think I made up an extra exit between LGA and 31st St. Ignore my previous post please.&nbsp; This is what I meant to say:<br /><br /><br />Get off at Exit 5 (82nd St.).&nbsp; Go straight across 82nd St/Ditmars Blvd. and you will be on Astoria Blvd.&nbsp; Turn onto Steinway.

				Or... take the 94th street exit from LGA to 31st avenue, turn right and take 31st all the way down to Steinway. should be less busy than Broadway. Do NOT take 30th ave. that ends at the Amtrak line just past the BQE.

				Astoria Blvd. from LGA all the way to 31st Street can get traffic laden, and it&#039;s not a very short distance from the 82nd street exit to Steinway.<br /><br />How about, as suggested above, going down 94th Street and then heading towards Astoria from 31st Avenue, or alternately, 32nd Avenue (to 51st Street, then turn south one block to Broadway), 30th Avenue or Northern Blvd?
