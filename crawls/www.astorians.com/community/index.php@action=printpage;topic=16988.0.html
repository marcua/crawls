				There&#039;s a new bar on 30th ave, around 48th - name is Radio Bar. I had dinner there a few weeks ago, and the food was really great. Drinks were good too. <br /><br />Anyone else try it?

				What kind of food? What is the place like? Can you be more specific?<br />That is so out of the way for me, I would like to have a better idea as to what type of place this is before I venture out.

				Its like fancy bar food - the menu is small but when I was there they had 4 or 5 specials, mostly entree type dishes. I ordered this Greek salad (special), it was about $7 and was huge, and really good. My bf ordered the burger. He said it was pretty good and he&#039;s pretty particular about his hamburger. Someone next to us ordered what looked like a caesar salad, which also looked pretty delish. <br /><br />I think the menu was typical apps (potato skins, wings, onion rings) and a few entrees (burger, salad, chicken sandwhich) and one or two desserts. Hope that helps<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Thanks, that sounds fine. Good for locals, no need to travel a mile for it though.

				I think Radio Bar opened in October...<br /><br />Upper 30th ave has 3 bars w/ good food in the 40&#039;s....Blackbirds on 42nd....Dillingers on 46th...and Radio Bar on 48th. Personally, I feel Dillingers has the best menu.
