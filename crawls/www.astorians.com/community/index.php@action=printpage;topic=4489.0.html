				I have been trying to PM someone and their mailbox is full. Please check *your* mailbox and empty out all the PMs you no longer need so that you can get new messages. I would also imagine that they all take up a lot of real estate on the server.

				You are right, it does take up some real estate on the server.<br /><br />Incidentally, anyone who is a supporter of the site gets unlimited personal message storage.

				merm - did you recently decrease the storage?&nbsp; My mailbox suddenly jumped from about 50% full to over 100%.&nbsp; It&#39;s understandable if you did, but I would have appreciated some warning so I could have cleaned it out ahead of time.<br /><br />Also -- in terms of supporting the site, do you mean just directly, or via any of the options (for instance, online store)?&nbsp; I&#39;ve chosen to support the site by buying a lot of things from the store, but I haven&#39;t donated directly.&nbsp; I did click on the &quot;Donate&quot; link (and just double-checked) - it says the cost is $0.00, which is a little confusing.&nbsp; Does that mean it&#39;s an open donation? <br /><br />Finally, I&#39;d like to see this sort of information (mailbox limitations, donation information) somewhere in the rules of the board, or perhaps in a FAQ sticky for easier and consistent reference.

				I did recently decrease the storage, however it was my understanding that this wasn&#39;t a hard limit. In other words, that by decreasing the storage of PM&#39;s that none of your existing PM&#39;s would be deleted. Let me know if this is not the case. If some of your PM&#39;s were deleted as a result please accept my apology. What was supposed to happen was your quota would say 100%, but wouldn&#39;t delete any messages that were already in your box.<br /><br />Supporting the site does include getting an astorians item from the store. But we&#39;re still trying to figure out how to identify people who have purchased from the store. Currently we can&#39;t see who has purchased any items. We&#39;ve put in a request to the company that runs the online store to find out if there&#39;s any way we can even have a custom message sent to let people know they should email us and let us know they are a supporter so we can update it manually. Of course the best thing would be for them to shoot us the email of the person so we could update that manually.<br /><br />In the case of the $0.00 donation the reason this is set up that way is just because it&#39;s the only way the software will let you enter any amount you want. Currently if you click on the donate link it allows you to enter any amount you want to donate. The software sees this as $0.00 until the next screen where you enter in any amount you want.<br /><br />PM&#39;s are currently associated with how many posts someone has made in the forum. We really need to do a FAQ, but, like the &quot;rules&quot; nobody has done it yet. I&#39;d love it if anyone wanted to volunteer to put this together.<br /><br />For anyone who has purchased from the store please let us know so we can add you as a supporter. I&#39;ve been meaning to post that announcement but just haven&#39;t gotten around to it yet.

				Well, especially because I kind of brought it up, I&#39;d be happy to work on a FAQ (with or without others).&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)<br /><br />None of my PMs were deleted that I know of, but someone tried to PM me but wasn&#39;t able to because my PM box was suddenly full.&nbsp; I did keep track of it to prevent such a thing from happening, but like I said, it had been less than 50% full, so I hadn&#39;t been worrying about it.

I recently had a very distressing situation and I would like to know how many messages constitute a full box. If possible, please break down the in- and the out- box. Also, can those little sliding percentage scalers be returned so that we know how full the boxes are at a glance *before* we can no longer receive a PM.

				I don&#39;t have the slider (so I&#39;m presuming I have been added as a supporter and have unlimited storage), but despite that I got a message that NYCMU&#39;s box was full.&nbsp; The message said specifically that her box was full, and it said nothing about my box.
