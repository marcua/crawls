				So, we had talked about doing this on Thursday, November 30 (that&#39;s this week).&nbsp; I&#39;d like to suggest that we push it to the new year.&nbsp; There&#39;s already so much going on food-wise now (the rescheduled November EATS event) and in December (hello holidays), that I think it would be best to do it later when other things aren&#39;t leaning up against it.&nbsp; Hope people are agreeable to that.<br /><br />Let me know your thoughts!

				The taco truck also delivers.&nbsp; It&#39;s on 30th avenue, usually parked in front of the big Rite Aid across from Key Food.&nbsp; Labeled &quot;El Rey Del Taco&quot; and &quot;Azteca Pride.&quot;<br /><br />It generally shows up after 7 pm (as a rule, it arrives about five minutes after I decide to get something else to eat because the taco truck isn&#39;t there).<br /><br />It&#39;s the best.&nbsp; Different from other tacos around here.&nbsp; Cheap, too.&nbsp; Sometimes there&#39;s a long line, though.&nbsp; But they&#39;re pretty fast.

I&#39;ve also tried them from another little mexican grocery store - the one near the corner where one often finds the taco truck. They only have them on the weekend though, and the full selection only on Friday night. By Sunday, all that&#39;s left is the verde. Speaking of, does the taco truck have tamales? Has anyone ever tried them? I always just get my tacos there!

				I&#39;m sure I sound like a broken mariachi record, but my favorite is the Tulcingo Deli IV. They&#39;re the only tacos I&#39;ve had in Astoria with guacamole on them. Their other foods are delicious too (as are their chips!) and the people there couldn&#39;t be nicer.

				El Potro/Luna is pretty tiny, apparently.<br /><br />I like the idea of starting with the Taco Truck, but it may not be there when we start.&nbsp; Historically, it hasn&#039;t been there until 8pm, and I don&#039;t think anyone wants to start that late on a work night.&nbsp; People in the know (aka goldfish boy and flooz), when is the truck arriving these days?<br /><br />It might be possible to drop Luna, and head back to Tacos Mexico for drinks afterwards.&nbsp; We could do a &quot;two new, two old&quot;:&nbsp; Taco Truck and Tacos Mexico as the old, and Tulcingo Deli and El Compita as the new.&nbsp; That way, people could choose to eat more tacos at Taco Mexico, or simply just have a drink.&nbsp; <br /><br />Lots of variables.&nbsp; Good thing we have lots of time to plan!<br /><br />On Preview:&nbsp; El Compita is a hole in the wall, so maybe not a good place to end.&nbsp; mcdirk?&nbsp; If we end up near Steinway, the Q101 runs conveniently up to the Ditmars neighborhood.<br /><br />Keep the feedback coming!&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />

				Well, since it was dry out by the time I got home, I did half of the crawl.&nbsp; I hit El Compita at around 6:40 and found it full of teenage boys, but there was one table open so I had an excellent cecina (salted beef) taco that came with chips.&nbsp; I waited around a little while to see if there were any folks who hadn&#039;t read the boards, but no one else came.&nbsp; I then wandered around a bit until the Taco Truck opened for business, and I got an al pastor and a pollo--well worth the wait IMO.
