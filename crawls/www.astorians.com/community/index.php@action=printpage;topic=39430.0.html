				Astorians!<br /><br />According to the Greater Astoria Historical Society, the beautiful and historic terra cotta decoration on the former Rite Aid on 36th Street and Broadway is going to be destroyed.&nbsp; Apparently the Astoria Business Association is indifferent to the wanton destruction of Astoria&#039;s cultural heritage.&nbsp; Please take action in preserving this building.&nbsp; The Historical Society recommends contacting Costa Constantinides&#039; office.<br /><br />Stefanie

Although they could probably stand to make those types of places a bit more interesting, like they could add video games and make the interior more rustic, with exposed dark wood and bronze and iron ornaments. You know, something unique...... Like Greek... oh wait, we&#039;re trying to get rid of that, aren&#039;t we.....

Such intolerance from the Gen Snowflakes.<br />Who exactly are these people that aren&#039;t like me? Please explain Or... Maybe you can explain your own prejustices about people like me. Such typical intolerance. If you haven&#039;t lived in Astoria for at least ten years you have no voice in the old vs. new Astoria debate. You have no perspective of the two. You only have the perspective of what Astoria has become or, perhaps, what you&#039;ve made it. Again, this brings up the prejustice card. You fear that which you never experienced and cling to the familiar. Very sad.<br />It&#039;s funny how you feel the need to warp the OP&#039;s original intent of saving historic terra-cotta to launch an ad hominim attack on me. Very telling of your character.<br />Explain exactly why it is wrong to want to preserve the neighborhoods character and not allow greedy developers to do what they want to Astoria.

Thankfully, less greedy heads prevailed and it will stand for a little longer.

				For those who would like to do something, here is a message you can send to Councilman Costa Constantinides at costa@council.nyc.gov :&nbsp; Dear Mr. Constantinides:<br />&nbsp;It has come to my attention that the beautiful and historic terra cotta decoration on the former Rite Aid on 36th Street and Broadway is in danger of being destroyed. This architectural detail is part of Astoria’s cultural heritage and has delighted generations of Astorians, myself included. Built as a Childs Restaurant in the 1920s, this building deserves landmark status. Astoria has undergone massive gentrification in recent years, but that is no reason to destroy one of the few architectural gems we have in this neighborhood. <br />&nbsp;Thank you,<br />&nbsp;[Your Name]

				Good news!&nbsp; The owner of Deals, Morris Dweck, is trying to save the terra cotta decoration.&nbsp; His architect came up with the following drawings (providing links below, because the files were too large to attach):<br />drawing #1 (https://www.dropbox.com/s/olc10o4ivmljjid/3601%20Broadway%20Rendering%20%231.jpg?dl=0)<br />drawing #2 (https://www.dropbox.com/s/6uqjr164gbtvaap/3601%20Broadway%20Rendering%20%232.jpg?dl=0)
