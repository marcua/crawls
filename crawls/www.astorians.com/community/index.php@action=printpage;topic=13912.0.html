				I did this last year.&nbsp; Think I paid $500 for 15 one hour private lessons.&nbsp; That&#039;s about $33 per lesson.&nbsp; Awesome price for what you get.&nbsp; He will also help you meet up with other similar skilled students for practice and will even have them share a lesson with you to work on partner skills.&nbsp; Really can&#039;t recommend him enough.&nbsp; Go talk with him in person and let him test you out and go from there.<br /><br />Good luck and let me know if you want to practice sometime.

				Hello All,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For those intrested in a little background on wilson morales. Hes a great instructor. Yes he has been teaching there for 30+ years to be exact. He was a great tennis player in ecuador, he played pro. He had 4 kids, one who passed away almost 6 years ago. He has been giving lesson all these years and each student he has taught, has learned the sport, has become professionals, become top junior players of ny, have gone on to top colleges. most of all the man loves the sport more than his family. hes a great guy and is young at heart. dont underestimate him..... his success has brought many people very happy. especially his sons and daughters. his son eric 37 who still playes pro tournaments from time to time. and at one time owned his only club in bloomfield ct. you can google all his kids names. danny who passed away also was playing por and was a teaching pro at another tennis park. eric also taught at two parks like astoria. his daugther played pro and retired but still playes the game from time to time.....and his last son who at one time played pro before was married and with a child now runs a indoor tennis facility at in long island. he is the tennis director at sportime lynbrook. he has been teaching there for 10 years now. mr. morales is well known and exprienced tennis professional. his last batch of kids he taught were going pro one kid is adam el mahdwy. the man knows what he is doing he is also resonable in prices compared to other places. he charges $35-45 an hour........ outside places cost about $65-120..wilson gives you a bargin....Im one to tell you because im his son chris. i teach and charge 120 an hour.... my father is a great pro....<br />
