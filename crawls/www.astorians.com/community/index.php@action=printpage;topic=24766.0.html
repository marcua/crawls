Where on B&#039;way? upper or lower? <br />Unless you&#039;re willing to walk a few blocks, you won&#039;t do better.

				I am willing to walk a few blocks.&nbsp; I know 150-200 is the going rate, but giving a shot to see if someone around here has a spot unused at the house/home.&nbsp; I am looking at lower broadway like 21 st - 29th street area.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				150 is dirt cheap . Wake up , this is Astoria not Corona or Jackson Heights. I know so many people who rent out garages for 250 a month easy .

				I&#039;ve been in my spot(garage) since 1988- that was 6 cars ago! I was very lucky and got a shared garage for $90 at the time. I had the outside slot of a double garage- a bit tricky, but I knew how to wheedle my way in. When the other guy skipped out on a few months rent, the owner got a new tenant and gave her the outside and I got the inside. She lasted less than a month because she couldn&#039;t figure how to park in less than 20 minutes, much less without hitting my car a few times. The next guy was a real d*ckhead, and finally the owner said he had enough and took over that side for a workshop. I kept the inside slot since then. I took it upon myself to shovel them out, and the driveway when it snowed- although 50feet of driveway, then the streetside glacier after a major storm was tough to shovel. Since 1988 the rent has gone up...TWICE. I&#039;m paying $125 a month- granted it&#039;s 6 blocks away, but well worth it to keep the car safe and out of the street cleaning shuffle. Unfortunately, the owner passed away last year but his wife is staying and I (and my wife) do what we can for her- especially when it snows. Even pick up some Irish sausies for her once in a while from the Butcher Block.
