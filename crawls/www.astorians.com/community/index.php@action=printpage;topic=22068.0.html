				&nbsp;<br />I checked out an apt in this building last week and am strongly considering signing a lease.&nbsp; So I can tell you what I think just from seeing the place....<br />&nbsp;<br />This place seems to be very well made, and what struck me most is the attention to detail, which to me speaks volumes about the developer/builder.&nbsp; Clearly this was not some cheap cookie-cutter building that went up.<br />&nbsp;<br />It is very tastefully decorated.&nbsp; Check out their website and see all the photos....<br />&nbsp;<br />It has a small gym, an amazing roofdeck with BBQs, wetbar, lounge chairs and even an outdoor shower!&nbsp; How many buildings do you know in this city that have nice roofdecks that include wetbars and outdoor showers?!<br />&nbsp;<br />Each unit has its own Bosch washer/dryer.&nbsp; The bathroom floors have ambient heating (or whatever it&#039;s called...heated floors).&nbsp; There are lots of nice details here.<br />&nbsp;<br />The only &#039;downside&#039; is it&#039;s about a ten minute walk from the subway, and the street it&#039;s on is a bit too &#039;industrial&#039; for my taste.&nbsp; I also would prefer to be on the OTHER side (the East side) of 31st Street...it&#039;s more vibrant...but...I guess you can&#039;t have everything.<br />&nbsp;<br />The rooftop views from this building are SPECTACULAR.&nbsp; And if you get an apt on one of the higher floors facing Manhattan, again, awesome views.&nbsp; AND the building is rent-stabilized!<br />&nbsp;<br />http://www.thirty-fifty.com/amenities.html (http://www.thirty-fifty.com/amenities.html)<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

				&nbsp;<br />I was told by the broker (who does seem very nice and honest unlike many other sleazy ones I come across)...I was told that the apts have PTAC units, which apparently heat and cool the apartment.&nbsp; She said that since I work outside the home M-F 9-5 (and will therefore only want to heat/cool the place at night or on weekends), that I&#039;d probably pay $100 per month or so...that she herself has a PTAC unit.<br />&nbsp;<br />I do know that I generally don&#039;t like my apt too warm in the winter, and prefer NOT to use A/C in the Summer (I prefer open windows).&nbsp; So I&#039;m hoping it will really only be about $100 per month.&nbsp; (I guess the PTAC runs on electricity, so it would all be part of the electric bill.)<br />&nbsp;<br />As for the water, I just ASSUMED water would be included.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never heard of a rental where it was NOT included?&nbsp; Nonetheless I will ask them that question just to be sure, and let you all know.&nbsp; Tx!

				Yeah, believe me...I am a bit sick about it...the cost of the rent (and for where I HAVE filled out an application to rent).&nbsp; Right now I&#039;m paying just $1500, so it will be almost $1000 more per month for me!&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; However, right now I live in Glendale/Ridgewood, Queens, which I can&#039;t STAND.&nbsp; Very blue collar, close-minded people, nothing but 99 cent stores and fast food restaurants.&nbsp; AND to get to work, I have to take a BUS (horrible having to wait late at night or in the cold), and then TWO trains, for an almost 50-60 minute commute.&nbsp; And if I ever want a taxi home from my job in Times Square, forget about it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had taxi doors locked on me, been kicked out mid-ride, been sworn etc., told that I don&#039;t know the best way to get to my own apartment etc..&nbsp; Sure some drivers have been fine, but I&#039;ve had more than my share of bad situations, all cuz many drivers simply don&#039;t want to drive all the way to Glendale.<br />&nbsp;<br />In Astoria, I&#039;ll have no more problems if I want a taxi home.&nbsp; (Plus I&#039;ll be less likely to need taxis home anyway, since the commute will be SO much easier.)&nbsp; I already have three friends that currently live in Astoria, whereas in Glendale I didn&#039;t relate to anybody in the nabe, and my friends who lived elsewhere never wanted to visit (due to the horrible commute to get there).&nbsp; From Astoria my commute to work will now be on ONE train line, and door to door it will be about 30 minutes each way.<br />&nbsp;<br />I&#039;ll have more friends from other parts of Manhattan now more willing to visit me.&nbsp; And then there&#039;s all those apartment amenities...a gym right there....washer/dryer IN the apartment....doorman...and an awesome roofdeck for BBQing and parties.&nbsp; Oh I can already imagine the parties I&#039;ll be having.<br />&nbsp;<br />But yeah, the high rent DOES make me a bit sick.&nbsp; However I&#039;m only looking at it as a temporary thing, as during my 18 month lease there I will start looking for a place to BUY.&nbsp; And after being accustomed to paying almost $2400/month at this place, any mortgage I pay for a place to buy for around $550k will seem like a pittance (since I already have the 20% needed to put down).&nbsp; I didn&#039;t buy right now though because I was more focused on just getting the hell out of Glendale/Ridgewood, and I didn&#039;t want to rush to buy a place.&nbsp; So this way I can take my time....about a year or so...to find just the right place to buy...<br />&nbsp;

				Tx.&nbsp; Yeah the only prob w/Sunnyside though is you have to rely on the 7 train, which is something I do not want to do.&nbsp; So I will be focusing on either Astoria or else Jackson Hts. (since that too has many homes with yards, and has awesome subway access!)

				Well I certainly wouldn&#039;t say that that part of 21st Street feels &#039;neighborhoody&#039; or intimate or warm and fuzzy.&nbsp; Located on a street with not just two, but four lanes of traffic?&nbsp; And what&#039;s next to this apartment building...I think it was some kind of a metal supply company or something...I recall it had like a warehouse type entrance on 21st Street right near this apartment building&#039;s entrance.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t see any &#039;neighborhood&#039; shops on this part of the street...not one bodega, dry cleaner etc.&nbsp;

				21st street is super busy and down the block twds 14th street its all industrial .&nbsp; Alot of body shops , a metal supply company , a huge tractor supply store and other little chop shop looking places .&nbsp; No one with a family wants to live there . Yea im sure the place looks great , and remember they add all those little perks in there , like outdoor shower and wetbar to get people in . Why would someone pick that place over a residential area thats quiet and doesnt have non stop traffic till 2am every night ?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not to put your idea down&nbsp; , maybe it would work out great .&nbsp; Just be carefull crossing the street and im sure you dont have kids so no worries there .&nbsp; &nbsp;Are all those apts rentals only ? or do they sell condos too ?&nbsp; &nbsp;Funny at those prices they actually boost abt being rent stabilized . Like $2200 for a one bedroom&nbsp; and they are possibly thinking of raising it in the future ? lol&nbsp; riiiight .&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The walk to the train sucks on a cold rainy night&nbsp; but im just curious , if you would do the walk regardless , and like you said you dont like the industrial and busy feel , why not go for a place in upper Ditmars . Walk would be abt the same or less from say&nbsp; Ditmars and 42st or around and its totally quiet and safe . <br />$550k for a condo even with 20% down&nbsp; adding in all the bills , taxes ,maintainance seems it will come out to more than $2200 a month. Alot of newer condos you also pay for your heat and cooking gas too .&nbsp; Anyway im sure you know the deal . Good luck .

				Tx.&nbsp; I don&#039;t mind the traffic per se...it could be worse and if I take this place I plan to be on the other side of the bldg facing Manh so no traffic sounds.&nbsp; And yeah, no kids so no worries there.&nbsp; I know to cross at the traffic light at 30th Ave.&nbsp; It was more the emptiness of the street (no little shops), and the physical chasm that the four lanes of traffic creates between residences on either side of the street...but it wasn&#039;t the traffic itself so much that bothered me...more the fact that it&#039;s a different &#039;kind&#039; of traffic than say congestion you might see on the other end of 30th Ave.&nbsp; Traffic on 21st Street feels like it&#039;s just &#039;passing thru&#039; whereas traffic on the other end of 30th Ave (on the other side of the N/Q) feels more like traffic that&#039;s part of the community.&nbsp; (Not sure if that makes sense but I&#039;m very sensitive to that kind of stuff....the overall feeling I get from a place...)<br /><br />From what I understand the entire bldg is rentals only, and all 1BRs only.&nbsp; Yeah, I too got a kick out of the &#039;rent stabilized&#039; thing.&nbsp; I mean, how often do you hear of rent-stabilized at those prices?&nbsp; But I guess for those who can easily afford this place and who might think they&#039;ll want to rent there for many years (not me), it could matter to them.<br /><br />Yeah, it is a bit of a walk to the subway but then, right now where I live I already have to deal with a bus to get to/from the subway (otherwise it&#039;s a 15-20 min. walk to subway).&nbsp; On top of that, I must take two different trains also to get to/from work.&nbsp; Living at this place in Astoria, it will now be one train to my job at Rock Center.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d already been looking for a few months...first to rent, then to buy (first looking at co-ops, then condos, and finally when I realized even condos have rules that could stop me from having couchsurfers, I decided a small house is the only way to go for me.&nbsp; I love having guests and absolutely don&#039;t want to run the risk of any &#039;board&#039; telling me down the road, that I cannot do so or have to limit the number of guests I have).&nbsp; But obviously finding a house to buy would require a longer search and, wanting to get out of my present nabe sooner rather than later, I decided to find a rental, and THEN spend that time looking for a place to buy.<br /><br />So after all this back and forth, I was just ready to find something.&nbsp; And when I saw this place, and the &#039;showcase&#039; apartment they had all set up, I admit I was totally smitten.&nbsp; The Manh. views really are spectacular, and with all the amenities well...I&#039;ve just never had all that...and the idea of it appealed to me...I figured it might be a nice change...to live a life of luxury even if for only 18 months.&nbsp; ;-)<br /><br />It definitely is more than I want to pay for rent, but I figure it&#039;s just temporary, and either way living in Astoria will be a nice change for me that will affect other parts of my life...shorter commute, I already have 4 friends in Astoria (Ihave none where I live now in the middle of nowhere on the Qns/Bk border), and I&#039;ll certainly get in better shape due to the onsite gym AND the nearby bike path (I&#039;ll now be motivated to buy a bike).<br /><br />Also, having outdoor space is a MUST for me, so that made my search that much harder.&nbsp; I realize yeah, I probably could find something equally nice, perhaps without ALL those amenities but with access to a balcony or yard, and for a few hundred less.&nbsp; But I guess I&#039;m ready to stop searching....ready to just MOVE.&nbsp; ;-)

				I thought co-ops had more rules than condos . And i guess they put those rules in abt whos sleeping over cuz people probably have loud parties and people crashing all the time and it only creates noise for the other people who live there . I can understand it , but you are right , it sucks to be told what to do , esp in a place you own .&nbsp; <br />Well a small house would mean more privacy and no rules like that , only problem is the condition most of these houses are in just plain out suck .&nbsp; I dont think ive seen a house in Astoria under 500k&nbsp; and most are in the 600-650K range min&nbsp; and even then , really crappy condition with outdated baths and kitchens . This means more money needed to fix and upgrade .&nbsp; &nbsp;Also property taxes will be alot more than a condo would be .&nbsp; &nbsp; You can get a much better deal out of Astoria , cuz even in this economy nothing seems that have dropped here . I had a few friends who were looking recently and their banks demanded 30% down , while they both thought 20% would be ok . Times have def changed in that dept .&nbsp; &nbsp; Maybe you can find a good deal though , who knows . Keep looking .

				Yes, co-ops do have the most rules.&nbsp; That was why I then switched to looking at condos.&nbsp; But then I reallized that they too could possibly limit the number of guests I have.&nbsp; <br /><br />Wow, I didn&#039;t realize that even the $550k or so homes in Astoria would need some work done.&nbsp; Er...not sure I could swing all that then.&nbsp; Jackson Hts was another possibility for me...I figure it would be a bit cheaper and while not as nice as Astoria, it does have the plus of all those subway lines.&nbsp; Folks told me I should also consider Sunny/Woodside, but from what I can see they only offer access to the 7, and I definitely don&#039;t want to have to rely on the 7 (too slow and I know at least in the past, it&#039;s often not running on weekends).<br /><br />I can&#039;t believe how high R.E. prices still are, even with this economy.&nbsp; It&#039;s just really sick.<br />

				Astoria prices have gone through the roof.&nbsp; I am considering moving back and renting, but I may have to look in Sunnyside or Woodside instead.&nbsp; Seems like the average price for a 1 bedroom is 1500/mo in Astoria.&nbsp; If you&#039;re saying you can afford over 2K, then I really don&#039;t see how you&#039;d have a tough time finding a 1 bedroom right next to the subway and a gym.&nbsp; Just get a broker - they&#039;ll do all the work for a month&#039;s fee and you won&#039;t have to deal with the industrial area of 21st and your walk will be far easier.&nbsp; There&#039;s a sticky thread on here with brokers listed.<br /><br />I&#039;m currently in Jackson Heights and while it&#039;s nice, there are no gyms or parks or irish pubs here so if that&#039;s a big one for you, then stick to Astoria, or Sunnyside, or Woodside. I will say, though, that the apartments are a hell of a lot nicer in Jack Hts - bigger, huge closet space, with laundry and elevators in the buildings as a norm. And the transportation is about 10 times better as well.<br />

				Yeah, the only way I&#039;d pay $2100 for a 1BR on 21st St would be if I worked from home or in the immediate neighborhood. You could get a nice 2BR in a better area closer to the subway for that price, or a nice 1br in a better area for much less.

				But you wouldnt get a brand new place with a rooftop shower and wetbar !&nbsp; &nbsp;Thats the point here . He wants to do it for 18 months and while he is living there , he will look for a condo or small house to buy . Lets face it , most of the older places for rent , esp around the train are in crappy condition and offer little space.

				Yeah but I have to wonder if anyone would actually visit - I mean it&#039;s in such a far area with nothing around - will it really have that social aspect or will the rooftop sit empty?&nbsp; You might want to consider asking some neighbors how the action is.&nbsp; Is it really worth it to pay all that if it&#039;s not used and you end up being lonely?&nbsp; I mean, there are tons of bars - even wet ones (LIC has them) in Astoria, as well as gyms, etc.<br /><br />Perhaps the social life there is amazing - and in that case, all the more power to you.&nbsp; Good luck either way! <br />

				Sure the immediate area of the bldg isn&#039;t so nice or have much activity going on, but you make it sound as if it&#039;s located in Siberia.&nbsp; So because it&#039;s a 10 minute walk from the subway, you think no one will want to visit the residents who live there?&nbsp; People can&#039;t walk 10 minutes?&nbsp; &nbsp; None of my friends live in buildings with outdoor space or rooftops so they&#039;ve no capability for BBQs and outdoor parties, and with the great views and easy access from the N/Q train, I don&#039;t think it will be hard to get them to visit me.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plus I already have four other friends that live in Astoria....&nbsp; ;-)

				Hey Yippie...my gf and I are signing the lease tonight!&nbsp; &nbsp;The building really is one of a kind.&nbsp; &nbsp;Outside of price (which for what you are getting I don&#039;t view as a real negative) the location would be it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I live on Steinway and 21st Ave now so the walk is not the issue, but its more the area is not as residential as my area now, and half the walk is quieter.&nbsp; However, there are PLENTY of food/stores in the area...on 30th, 31st and Broadway.&nbsp; There is a trade fair off of the subway, as well as a major gym (though there is one in the building).... additionally there is a great restaurant on 21st and 30th.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />But i imagine the main reason they are offering a free month rent and no broker fee is because the area is not as attractive as closer to 31st street.&nbsp; &nbsp;Our room is one facing the west side so we have a nice skyline view and private balcony so we are really excited.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hey Doug!&nbsp; Tx.&nbsp; Perhaps we will be neighbors?&nbsp; ;-) <br />&nbsp;<br />I&#039;ve yet to sign a lease..still doing paperwork.&nbsp; I currently pay $1500 for a huge 1BR WITH a private yard and large deck, and with much nicer hdwd floors and all SS kitchen and gorgeous bath.&nbsp; Course, with that, I don&#039;t get the Manhattan skyline view, AND my current commute involves a bus and two trains (50 min. commute each way).&nbsp; So sure, I&#039;m gettign some things with this bldg that I don&#039;t currently get, but now I&#039;ll be paying $900 more per month single-handedly (no roommate).&nbsp; I don&#039;t know that it&#039;s quite worth all that but...I&#039;m just more than anything wanting to get out of my current nabe which I don&#039;t like.<br />&nbsp;<br />But there&#039;s another variable that the building doesn&#039;t fully disclose.&nbsp; Do you know about the PTAC units that heat/cool the apartment?&nbsp; Well I just had to learn up on it.&nbsp; Apparently in some instances the building will supply the heating fluid and the coolant, and the PTAC unit essentially just runs as a fan, to help circulate the cool or hot air.&nbsp; And so you are paying for electricity to run those fans.<br />&nbsp;<br />Apparently in this bldg however, I learned that they do NOT supply heating fluid or coolant for the PTAC units, and so the units themselves must create their own heat (via gas) or cool air (via electricity I thing), and then also run fans to then circulate that air.&nbsp; So I understand that what that means is that, because the PTAC units are doing so much work, and they run on electricity, our electric bills will be that much higher.&nbsp; It was difficult for others to tell me exactly what we might be paying each month, but the concensus seemed to be that our electric bill could be $200 in the higher use months.&nbsp; So as far as I&#039;m concerned, this is just another additional part of the &#039;rent&#039; cost (most rental apartments DO provide heat).

				Hey Yippie,<br /><br />&nbsp;iwas reading up on the same thing.&nbsp; &nbsp;The leasing agent I am talking to said the heat was just run off from a heat pump you pay electricity for the pump but not for the heat production.&nbsp; &nbsp; A/C however is fully off of electricity much like an in window unit.<br /><br /><br />At least this is what I was told.&nbsp; &nbsp;Right now I live in a 2 bedroom for $1740 that is a new construction.&nbsp; However at my apartment i pay gas heat (control in unit) so during winter my con-ed bill would be near $300 in a really cold month.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can&#039;t see me paying more than that with the PTAC units.

				Here&#039;s the exact response they gave me regarding the PTAC unit:<br />&nbsp;<br />&#039;The unit is a completely self contained unit, producing its own heat (which is gas) and cooling electrically.&#039;<br />&nbsp;<br />I guess that can be subject to various interpretation (especially since many of us may not understand exactly what all of this means or how the units truly function).&nbsp; Regardless, I think they were perhaps understating what the monthly operating costs might be for us...<br />&nbsp;<br />Oh well.&nbsp; I just need to focus on all the positives that this place has and not dwell so much on the price.&nbsp; (It&#039;s just a temporary place for me to live so I can then focus on finding a place to possibly buy.)&nbsp; ;-)

				That shouldnt be a problem at all . Most people r lazy and want an apt right by the train . Even a 5 min walk is too long .

				$300 a month for gas seems kinda high for a 2 bedroom apt . I rent out 2 bedrooms and they all have seperate gas boilers , so each apt pays their own . Ive never seen a bill that high yet . Last month i paid $50 , this month it was $60&nbsp; and im guessing with the much colder weather&nbsp; it might double at the most . We also cook alot at home , but that doesnt use nearly as much as heat does .&nbsp; &nbsp;Guys remember almost all new buildings have their own seperate meters . Others are also converting in older buildings . The way of the tenant getting free heat will eventually be a way of the past . Its far too costly and alot of times , a total waste as people arent home , windows are left open while the heat is pumping away .&nbsp; &nbsp;Just remember when you go to work , totally shut it off . Dress warm in the house and when you are sleeping it shouldnt be above 67 .&nbsp; I would have mine totally off at night if i didnt have small babies at home . Under the covers you should be warm with no heat on .&nbsp; &nbsp;A winter like this one , we totally got away with a great Oct ,and Nov . Dec was half 50 degree days too . 2 1/2 more months and it will warm up .&nbsp; Plus this place has all windows and new insulation , not like the older buildings that used &quot;stuffing&quot; in the walls to keep the cold out . Higher floors will probably be warmer .

				Yeah, that makes sense Thanos and you are prob right that more and more tenants will be paying for their own heat.&nbsp; I&#039;d never heard of rental apts NOT including heat before, but now hear about it more and more.<br />&nbsp;<br />And it DOES make sense in a way that tenants have control over their own heat as naturally they know their own schedule (are they home or out and about?) and their own preference for degree of warmth.&nbsp; In my current apt. the radiators produce so much heat that indeed, sometimes I have to crack the windows open.&nbsp; So wasteful!&nbsp; I even spoke to the LL about it but I guess it&#039;s hard to regulate such heating systems and also make all the tenants in the building equally happy.&nbsp; I even tried closing the valves for some of the radiators, but some of them started spewing blackish water....<br />&nbsp;<br />Anyway, I&#039;m hoping that if I keep the blinds open during the day in the Winter, and with my apt. being on the 4th floor and facing West, that I shouldn&#039;t need much heat.&nbsp; (Plus I DON&#039;T like it warm in my bedroom....much prefer it to be cool air and then I just go under my down puff!)&nbsp; And then in the Summer, so long as I keep the blinds CLOSED, and just have the windows open and run fans (which is also much more preferable for me than A/C), that hopefully my costs with the PTAC unit won&#039;t be too high.&nbsp; ;-)

Living in upper Ditmars though is beneficial to many who dont want to be in the hustle and bustle of everything , enjoy more peace and quiet and have larger apts with more space . Wow&nbsp; now i am giving the benefits rnt i ?&nbsp; &nbsp;Well why not since you brought it up .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am also free to speak and debate abt what i want on this board . You are free not to read my posts , which it seems you are obsessed by .&nbsp; &nbsp;Also the car thread didnt take shots at anyone without a kid or kids , it just said non drivers who dont have kids dont understand how crazy it is to get around with babies or really small children&nbsp; .

				Hi there, hoping I can offer some nice insight to this discussion!<br />&nbsp;<br />I&#039;ve been a strictly Ditmars girl for 7 years, but after a lump of bad apartments and bad landlords, we decided to up and look for a new building; and we looked a LOT.&nbsp; We ended up going from the first floor of a townhouse on Ditmars and 37th to one of the new buildings on 21st (We&#039;re next to the N/W Astoria Building).&nbsp; It was the best decision we ever made.<br />&nbsp;<br />We pay the same in rent as we did for the much larger apt (the new one is only 1 bdrm), but since we&#039;re a couple, it doesn&#039;t matter.&nbsp; We just moved Dec 1st, so we&#039;ve yet to get our first heat bill, but I don&#039;t anticipate it being that bad.&nbsp; We have 3 seperate units (one in kitchen, one in LR, one in bedroom) so usually only one is on at a time, and we keep it pretty cool; like 68 degrees.&nbsp; This weekend we are going to get a space heater though as other people in our building reccomended them as being a little more cost efficient.&nbsp; Fact is, most new building (we found) do not include heat.&nbsp; It&#039;s just a downside to the new buildings. My partners dad did recently tell us that before we run the dishwasher, you should run the hot water in your sink, this way you don&#039;t use as much electricity getting hot water.<br />&nbsp;<br />Okay, so the walk to the train; yeah, it&#039;s longer than usual.&nbsp; But we don&#039;t mind at all, because once you&#039;re home, you&#039;re home! And when you get the view, it&#039;s worth it! We love our roof, New Year&#039;s Eve was great to watch fireworks and I can&#039;t wait to bbq.&nbsp; Our friends don&#039;t mind walking over at ALL! No one has yet to complain and everyone loves the apartment. PLUS we use the busses a LOT! It&#039;s faster for me to take the bus down 21st to Queens Plaza and catch the train rather than walk to the train.&nbsp; From Astoria Blvd to Queens Plaza is about 10 minutes. <br />&nbsp;<br />The ammenties once you are home also are part of why you won&#039;t mind the walk; you have the washer/dryer, the view, the balcony.... we have a bodega right next door, so it&#039;s fine. Plus, the community beyond 21st St is really cute and up and coming (Hell Gate Social, Vesta, Astoria Bake Shop, etc).&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Last year when we were moving to our new apartment on Ditmars, I had said I refused to look at anything on 21st St and Astoria Blvd, but boy I&#039;m glad we made the change!&nbsp; There is also a new grocery store on Newtown and 23rd Street that I love.<br />&nbsp;<br />I have been trying to get a lot of people I know to move into the building you are looking at, it looks and sounds great! If you can afford it, do it!

				Sounds like a good story . Exactly what i meant as well when i said i cant believe all these people want to live right next to the train cuz they cant walk 5-8 mins extra from their normal walk . And once you are home its well worth instead of being in a crappy place thats all run down and old and ontop you still pay top dollar for it .&nbsp; &nbsp;Just curious , do they allow bbq&#039;ing ?&nbsp; cuz i know some roofdecks said they did , but the firedept in the end said it wouldnt be allowed .

				Well, we have a grill from the last apartment, and we noticed that down in the storage cases, several other people have grills, so I&#039;m assuming it&#039;s okay to do on the roof (or maybe people do it on their balconies).&nbsp; Our management said that they were going to finish the roof a little nicer and add gazebos and grills, but I don&#039;t know how soon that could happen.&nbsp; I looked at another building a few months ago on 21st and 30th Ave and they already had Weber grills built into the roof, so that was really nice.&nbsp; I guess I&#039;ll find out in the spring :)<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve always felt pretty safe coming home, I lived on Steinway for years, which was a similar situation being on a busy street about 10 blocks from the train. I think that you might feel uneasy in any living situation.&nbsp; Also, we have a 24 hr deli next door and the building on the other side has a 24 hr doorman, and a nursing facility across the street which helps me with safety issues.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

When it&#039;s raining hard, it sucks. When there&#039;s been a snow storm and hardly anyone has cleared the sidewalks, it sucks. My last apartment was about half a mile from the subway and, while in nice weather the walk didn&#039;t bother me, in bad weather it truly sucked. <br /><br />If people can afford these apartments and don&#039;t mind trudging through awful weather to get to and from the subway, or taking a bus to the train, great. I&#039;m glad some people do want to live in those buildings rather than them sitting vacant. But as for paying top dollar for places close to the subway, my place is definitely not top dollar. While my building has no amenities, it&#039;s a nice apartment for the amount that I&#039;m paying, getting to the subway takes less than 5 minutes, and the neighborhood is nice to walk around. Your generalizations about people who want to live close to the subway, and apartments close to the subway, aren&#039;t helpful or realistic.

				Actually yes, I did walk around.&nbsp; As I think I said, it&#039;s that particular street....21st Street, that I don&#039;t think feels neighborhoody.&nbsp; Somehow when your neighbors across the street have to be reached by your crossing FOUR lanes of traffic, that doesn&#039;t exactly strike me quite the same as when your neighbors across the street can be reached by your crossing a more narrow one-way street.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; Smaller streets feel more intimate and safe from a pedestrian perspective.&nbsp; A street with four lanes of traffic feels much less so.&nbsp; There&#039;s no &#039;warmth&#039; to that street...it feels cold and impersonal.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;
