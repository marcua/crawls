				The site isn&#39;t against dating in particular, but so far the best way to get to know others is to just participate in the forum rather than creating a classified. I agree that we should cut this new astorian a bit of slack. But I encourage her to head over to the &quot;hello&quot; thread and say hello!<br /><br />If there&#39;s interest in a more specific &quot;dating&quot; component the mods could discuss adding a specific category for it. But there&#39;d need to be some interest for that to happen.

				I&#39;m not sure I understand why this post is inappropriate or not encouraged, if this is what someone wants to post. It&#39;s not against board policy, and there are many, many posts around here that seemingly have little to do with whatever this board is supposed to be about. My opinion is, as with everything on this site, if you&#39;re not interested, don&#39;t read....<br /><br />

				Rachel, I think you&#39;re right on.&nbsp; No offense to anyone on here, but if I read every single post in every single thread, I&#39;d never leave the apartment.&nbsp; If a thread doesn&#39;t interest you, move on.&nbsp; I&#39;d be in favor of a singles category.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; Quite a few relationships have sprung up because of interaction on this board, even if it wasn&#39;t as boldly done as act10ng1rl.&nbsp; To be perfectly honest, I kind of admire her guts.&nbsp; And if there are those folks who are opposed to a singles category, then they are perfectly within their rights not to look at it.&nbsp; It&#39;s so hard to meet nice people to go out with.&nbsp; It&#39;s a terrific little community we have going on here at astorians.com; I think it would be cool if more of us were able to find happy relationships through it.&nbsp; One could argue that you could simply go to the events to meet people, but if you&#39;d rather avoid the sort of roundabout way, I truly don&#39;t see a problem with posting an appropriate personals ad.<br /><br />Just my opinion.&nbsp; As much as I loathe Valentine&#39;s Day, I certainly love love.&nbsp; &nbsp;:roll:

				There is an OUT!

				I can&#39;t believe I am getting sucked into this thread!&nbsp; :-D<br /><br />First of all, I don&#39;t remember who said it, and I am not going to go back over three pages to find it, Jewish mothers are the best. We are raised to believe that it is inherent in motherhood to spoil the crap out of our children—and I did an excellent job of that!<br /><br />And yes, I do have one single son left. He is 37 years old, currently living in Los Angeles. But at the moment he is not a good catch. He recently ended a 15 year relationship and (I believe) he requires a little more time to heal before he can become serious again. <br /><br />Matchmaking has always been one of my avocations. And I am damn good at it. Especially when I know both people and can see how well it might work if there is that spark between them. Being in love is the best of human experiences. Even if it is only for a short term! <br /><br />Okay, Crap. My fingers are just running away on the keyboard, and I&#39;ll probably get all kinds of flak from doing this, but here goes.<br /><br />IMHO, finding someone to love, someone to love you, is a lot easier than it might appear. I have always found that people have preconceived notions about what they think will make them happy. Get rid of them. They generally impede your ability to see past physical appearance. It isn&#39;t socio-economic, racial, religious or political compatibility that makes a good match. It is intellectual compatibility that makes it work. I am *not* negating the sexual component, the attraction factor, I am simply saying that if you are intellectually in tune(d) with each other there will *always* be a common ground to resolve disagreements. And that conflict resolution is the cause for the dissolution of most relationships. <br /><br />As far as meeting someone . . . you need to be out there to do it. Go to places that *you* like to go. Do things that *you* like to do. And keep your smile on. Get involved in things you enjoy. <br /><br />I think a dating board is a great idea. <br /><br />So, I&#39;ll start the thread right here. Yeah! That&#39;s what I&#39;m gonna do. <br /><em><span class="bbc_u"><br />WOMAN SEEKING MAN:</span> Who is looking for a fat, 60+ physically disabled, over-educated, non-religious woman with kids who smokes, hates booze on your breath, loves dogs and cats, hates people, eats meat, desires to remain celibate, can&#39;t cook, hates airplanes, loves yachts, loves shopping, only drives luxury cars, can&#39;t abide whining, abhors synthetic stones, appreciates fine chocolates and smelly cheeses. <br />Willing to relocate.

				Hi Act, <br /><br />Totally understand your woes. I have noticed that the &quot;beer garden&quot; in the summer has a variety of boys from all places and styles. Plus, in the summer time, it&#39;s wonderful to don your hottest tank top baring dress, a pair of shades and throw a couple great beers back with your friends. During the weekends the place is packed with a larger guy ratio. I know this doesn&#39;t aide you immediatly but, hey it gives us time to take off those icky christmas pounds and look our best.<br /><br />I think it&#39;s on 28th ave or 27th in between 31st street and 32nd street, astoria stop and walk north a couple blocks.<br /><br />Rock on sister!

				I don&#39;t see anything wrong with a dating section either. Not sure how much I&#39;d participate myself, but I don&#39;t think it would create a &quot;meat market&quot; situation if it&#39;s limited to one section. Like I said before, I think this board should be open to whatever people are interested in as long as it&#39;s in the confines of what&#39;s appropriate. And it sounds like some of the single people here are expressing interest. <br /><br />That being said, the dating section may very likely be (for the straight singles, at least) 30 singles ladies and a handful of men.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)

That way, you aren&#39;t subjected to repeated hateful messages and you get to add to the community.

				I&#39;m not single, but I got sucked into the comical drama of the thread...so my non-single opinion? (un-solicited mind you)...It is a community board...dating is part of a community...it only makes sense to have a thread addressing it. From what I read (allllll of it) most agree.

				I was one of the &quot;annoying jerks/losers&quot; who sent a PM to her.<br /><br />Frankly, based on what I know of this community I highly doubt that anyone sent any messages &quot;bashing&quot; a newcomer. If you look at how people are falling all over themselves to convince her to stay I find it hard to believe that someone sent an even slightly abusive message. I know my message certainly was not of that tone.<br /><br />Reports of annoying jerks and losers on this board is greatly exaggerated I think, as is - more than likely - the &quot;bashing&quot; claim.<br /><br />I guess I&#39;m just saying that we all should have a bit more faith in the friendliness and good intentions of people that use this board all around.

If you really were getting rudely intended PMs, that&#39;s the minority and not worth leaving over.

				This thread has gotten really nasty, but from what I&#39;m reading, it&#39;s not coming from the other posters responding. I&#39;m also thinking that reports of nasty messages is exaggerated, given how everything seems to be misconstrued here. I don&#39;t thnk they should be encouraged to be &quot;outed,&quot; since they&#39;re private for a reason, and again, things are being VERY misinterpreted. People are actually being very polite in light of that!

				Back to the original topic, or almost. As a single guy, I think the idea of an astorians singles mixer isn&#39;t a bad one, especially if it consists of 200 single women fighting over Jtrane, Goldfish Boy, Handyman and me (don&#39;t forget about me!). I&#39;m not too sure the list-serv personals idea works for me though... <br /><br />&quot;live local, love local!&quot; said the man with one too many long-distance ex-girlfriends...

				I think a singles section on Astorians is a good idea.&nbsp; This site generally attracts people who are a little nicer and more outgoing than the average person--so why not date one?&nbsp; There&#39;s little danger of the site becoming a meat market since&nbsp; people come to this site for a great many reasons.&nbsp; Even mini-group of single women would be fun.&nbsp; What better place to dish about the up to 1/2 dozen single men out of 1551 members?!<br /><br />To paraphrase mightimic, &quot;Live Astoria, Love Astoria!&quot;

If you want to ease into things then that&#39;s the way to go (not that jumping right in is bad - just more risky if online forums are a new thing for you).

				If you forward a PM on to someone else (like a moderator) then yes, it&#39;s not personal any more. Sorta like email, if you forward it on to someone else, it&#39;s not really personal anymore.&nbsp; The receiver can do whatever they want with it, including post your message here in the forum for all to read - but the same is true of <em>any</em> message you send on the internet <em>anywhere</em>.

				I&#39;ll add that the kinds of messages you should absolutely report are if someone is saying &quot;F U&quot; or &quot;get off this board&quot; or &quot;get back to [insert country here]&quot;. But if someone is PM&#39;ing you just because they are expressing an opinion, or want to continue the conversation this is hardly abuse, even if they are not as friendly as you&#39;d like. You can always ignore them if it&#39;s a problem (there&#39;s an ignore feature under profile settings for personal messages).<br /><br />That being said I think it&#39;s a good idea for us to just remember that newbies don&#39;t always understand the dynamics of online community forums. For a lot of people this is the first one they&#39;ve participated in. Once you&#39;ve been around for a while it&#39;s easy to shrug off many of the negative comments because you know there are lots of other people out there that agree with you. Some of the newcomers I don&#39;t think realize that and zero in on the negative comments. If you disagree with a newbie, try and go easy on them until they learn the ropes and adjust to the community.

				I&#39;ve gotta say that reading this post and the fact that it is mostly populated by single women is a very positive thing for a single guy new to Astoria to see.&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />I can say that a dating-specific forum would not be such a bad idea since there appears to be quite a few single Astorians. However, should a date or two go bad and a little &quot;bad blood&quot; develop between a few posters, would it turn into a mess if either party were searching for others?<br /><br />When you bring any of the freaky-deaky into things, it always gets a bit more heated.&nbsp; As long as it could remain, relatively, bash-free, I don&#39;t see how it could hurt.<br /><br />Even if they don&#39;t decide to put a special forum, at least maybe we could pick up the &quot;events&quot; that are posted up to a frequency higher than once a month.&nbsp; Maybe we could have an informal, weekly eat/drink/shoot pool/drink a coffee/smoke some crack, etc. social event...

				Jaes, Its been hilarious to watch this thread develop....<br /><br />I think as its progressed it&#39;s become a little more evident in some cases why the thread developed in the first place (Maybe a little too cryptic...) But I feel that certain individuals are being too overly sensitive in certain comments.... From many of the posts I just observed a little pinch of humour being added... Lighten Up!<br /><br />Soooo, Am I in the minority here, one of the few single guys amongst a bevvy of single Astorian females, :D<br /><br />Agree with many of the earlier comments that intellectual compatability is by far the most lasting and important ingredient in a long healthy relationship.... Thats why many online liaisons have been so successful. We deal here in intellectual currency....<br /><br />However, in a bar - the currency of physical attraction more often than not rules our head.....<br /><br />Me $0.2 worth.....
