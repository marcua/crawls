			We already have the awesome nanny, just looking for a family who needs childcare for a single child. The nanny is $11/hour for your share ($22 for both children). Our landlord is uncomfortable with another child at our home ([/size][size=0px]&#128580;[/size][/size]), so the nanny would need to watch the children at your home. (But hey, no drop off or pick up!) Let me know if you are interested. You can start at the end of the month! Our baby is 5.5 months old, by the way. We are open to children of any age. Thank you! [/color]
