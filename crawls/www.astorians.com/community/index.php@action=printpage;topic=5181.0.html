				I&#39;m beginning to think that if you know me you might want to wrap yourself in cotton wool for awhile.&nbsp; In the last 10 days, the following things have happened to friends of mine:<br /><br />-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one friend got a door slammed on her hand and lost part of a finger<br />-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one friend was in a fairly serious car accident – stitches and totalled car<br />-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one friend’s mother was in a serious car accident<br />-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one friend is a goat farmer and her barn burned down and 14 goats were killed<br />-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one friend’s daughter was assaulted at school<br />-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same friend fell down a flight of stairs<br />-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one friend was mugged<br /><br />It can stop now, really.

				Anyone see <em>The Secret (http://thesecret.tv/)</em> or <em>What the Bleep Do We Know? (http://www.whatthebleep.com/)</em>? If not they both basically ascribe to the idea that your thoughts can influence the world around you and you make your day/control your future based upon your attitude. I&#39;m not suggesting that you caused any of your friends&#39; mishaps (I&#39;d actually highly doubt it), but this conversation did remind me of those two movies.
