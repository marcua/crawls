				Join the Queens County Young Democrats as we host Councilman Eric Gioia, who&#039;s a candidate for New York City Public Advocate to thank him for his support of Young Democrats. All are welcome!<br /><br />Monday April 13<br />7-9 PM<br />Mezzo Mezzo <br />31-29 Ditmars Blvd<br />Astoria, NY 11105<br /><br />We have known Eric Gioia for a number of years. Eric is a dynamic individual with a great future - an honest, smart, and passionate elected official who is part of the next generation of leaders in New York City. <br /><br />Eric grew up in New York and attended public schools before going on to work his way through NYU and Georgetown Law, and then serve in the Clinton White House. As a City Councilman, Eric has fought to ensure that the kids in his district have the same opportunities for success that he did. <br /><br />We admire many things about Eric, particularly his dedication to education. He visits every school in his district each year, making sure each student has access to the technological tools of the 21st Century, and giving each elementary school graduate a real hardback dictionary. <br /><br />Eric is an extremely devoted and driven public servant. His work on eliminating child hunger in New York and increasing access to food stamps has gained him national recognition. He recently won the national JFK Award, given to one outstanding Democrat each year by the Young Democrats of America!!<br /><br />Eric is a rising star in New York City politics and someone you should get to know if you live or work in New York City. <br /><br />I hope you will help Eric and contribute as generously as you can. The city matches all contributions up to $175 with a 6-1 bonus, meaning a $175 donation is actually worth $1,000, so every dollar really does count. For this party there is no suggested contribution it&#039;s OK to give what you can, even $10 is a big help. <br /><br />Bring a check made out to Gioia for New York, credit card or cash.<br /><br />Cash bar. <br /><br />All are welcome!!<br />

				I&#039;ve been trying to unsubscribe from Eric&#039;s &quot;news&quot;letter for about 3 years.&nbsp; Not a reflection of his validity as a candidate, but I think it shows a general lack of connection.&nbsp; THREE. YEARS.
