				Check it out. &nbsp;(http://cgi.ebay.com/VELVET-UNDERGROUND-NICO-1966-Acetate-LP-ANDY-WARHOL_W0QQitemZ300054910309QQihZ020QQ) Love the story behind it!&nbsp; Excerpt:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">THE MYSTERY OF THE VELVET UNDERGROUND&#39;S &quot;REAL FIRST RECORD&quot; (AND HOW THE ONLY EXISTING COPY WAS BOUGHT FOR 75 CENTS)<br /><br />In September of 2002 Warren Hill of Montreal Canada was perusing a box of records at a Chelsea, New York street sale when he happened upon a nice Leadbelly 10&quot; on Folkways, a water damaged copy of the first Modern Lovers LP on Beserkely, and a brittle 12&quot; piece of acetone-covered aluminum with the words &quot;Velvet Underground. 4-25-66. Att N. Dolph&quot; written on the label.&nbsp; He purchased the three records for 75 cents each.<br /><br />As I have a small knowledge of records and am an old friend of Warren&#39;s, I got a call from him the next day in which he described the acetate. Because of the date and the unique type of pressing, we both agreed that it was probably an in-studio acetate made during the recording of the first Velvet Underground LP back in 1966 (I had heard that they occasionally would have a vinyl cutting lathe in the studio to cut records of the day&#39;s recordings for the artists and/or producers to take home for review).&nbsp; Warren didn&#39;t want to play the mysterious platter due to the fragile nature of acetates, and the cheap nature of his record needle, so we agreed that the next time he was visiting me in Portland we would check it out together.&nbsp; If it turned out to be what we thought it was, maybe we could sell it at Mississippi Records, the small neighborhood record store in Portland that I work at.&nbsp; Sight unseen and sound unheard, I assumed that it was likely an acetate pressing of the recording which would be eventually be released as the group&#39;s first album, &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot;.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				And it&#39;s only $154,000! Interesting that they&#39;re selling it on ebay and not some auction house, though.
