One explicit argument for the $787 billion &quot;stimulus&quot; bill was to help states avoid these tax increases that even Keynesians understand are contractionary. Instead, the state politicians are pocketing the federal cash to maintain spending, and raising taxes anyway. Just another spend-and-tax bait and switch.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Mr. Silver says of the coming tax hikes: &quot;We&#039;ve done it before. There hasn&#039;t been a catastrophe.&quot; <br />Oh, really? According to Census Bureau data, over the past decade 1.97 million New Yorkers left the state for greener pastures -- the biggest exodus of any state. New York City has lost more than 75,000 jobs since last August, and many industrial areas upstate are as rundown as Detroit. <br />The American Legislative Exchange Council recently said New York had the worst economic outlook of all 50 states, including Michigan. And that analysis was done before these $4 billion in new taxes. <br /><br />&nbsp;The new budget raises another $2 billion or so on top of the $4 billion in income taxes with some 100 new taxes, fees, fines, surcharges and penalties to be paid by all New York residents. There are new charges for cell phone usage, fishing permits, health insurance (the &quot;sick tax&quot;), electric bills, and on bottled water, cigars, beer and wine. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />

I am not a very &quot;protesting&quot; kinda guy. I generally feel that things will find their equilibrium if they are allowed. But things are different now. How can anyone look at the mountain of debt being dumped on this country and feel that any good will come of it?<br />If there is any one story that has come out recently, that perfectly illustrates this bold new world, it is this one:<br />http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123879833094588163.html<br />The government actually refusing TARP money being returned to the Treasury.

I just find that impossible to believe. That&#039;s not to say all the participants or organizers are GOP robots; this is all just a little too well-orchestrated for me.

				Some of the things I&#039;m seeing are kind of interesting. Aside from whatever the Republican involvement with these things is on the organizational side, apparently, at some of the tea parties that have already taken place, some of the regular-folk participants have been put off to find that Republican politicians and talking heads are trying to use the tea parties for their party&#039;s benefit and not merely as a protest against wasteful government spending and congressmen who don&#039;t read bills before signing them. Although I find this whole thing fishy, I&#039;m interested to see how things develop tomorrow.

I&#039;m sure there was a different balance state-by-state.<br />After further thought and reading, my latest conclusion is that this started as a grassroots movement but then was quickly swept up by the Republican party, who then sent tons of money to the tea party cause via various non-profit groups and aided strongly in getting the message out. I don&#039;t believe Fox News had anything to do with actually arranging any of these tea parties, as some people have asserted - though graphics used on the channel describing the teaparties as &quot;FNC Tax Day Tea Parties&quot; were a bit dubious - but they were promoting them for weeks to an absurd degree. Now it&#039;s turned into a Battle of the Television News Media event, with Fox, CNN, and MSNBC all slinging mud at each other, which is kind of sad. <br /><br />Both major parties are obviously prone to astroturfing and simply doing asshole politician things, so Republican involvement in the tea party protests as a whole doesn&#039;t bother me. My biggest actual problem with the events was the incoherent relating of the protests to the Boston Tea Party. That made no sense and made the people involved look dumb and like they weren&#039;t protesting anything specific - just vague ideas of high taxes, government spending, and bailouts. If they wanted to destroy something relevant, instead of dumping tea in rivers across the country and sending tea to the White House (and of course they did not accept the package) they should&#039;ve found something that is actually being taxed and gone after that. Like going around NY and destroying shipments of non-diet sodas.

An amendment, offered by Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad (D-ND) and Ranking Member Judd Gregg (R-NH), would establish a task force to make recommendations for fiscal sustainability.
