				Please buy my unlimited metro card!&nbsp; Here is why I am selling it:<br /><br />Yesterday, in a hurry, I grabbed what I thought was my unlimited card.&nbsp; Then when I swiped it, and it said expired, I bought another unlimited, not really thinking about it since it was early in the morning and I was in a hurry.&nbsp; Then when I got home...yep, I found my monthly (swiped it today just to make sure!) which doesn&#039;t expire for another 2 weeks!&nbsp; <br /><br />So please please please buy this unnecessary montly card that I bought in a state of hurrying-to-work-early-in-the-morning!&nbsp; I will gladly meet someone in Astoria to make this transaction.&nbsp; This card expires on 3/4/08, and I will gladly swipe in a metro station so you can see&nbsp; :-)

				I don&#039;t need a monthly metrocard, so I can&#039;t buy it. But maybe you should put up signs in Astoria&#039;s subway stations near the Metrocard machine? Or maybe go to your station a little early tomorrow morning and ask people who are buying cards if they&#039;re buying a monthly, and maybe they&#039;d like to buy yours? You can swipe it right there to prove it&#039;s legit. (Not sure if this is legal, though, and most people probably buy on credit or debit. But it might be worth a try.)

				I can see your quandry, but it is illegal, both for the seller and the buyer.<br /><br />Did you pay for your card with a credit card?&nbsp; If you did, just report the card lost.&nbsp; You&#039;ll get a pro-rata refund for the card.

				Astorian police strike again.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t find someone to buy it - <br /><br />Here&#039;s your out:<br /><br />When you buy with a credit, debit, or ATM card your 30-Day Unlimited Ride MetroCard is automatically insured.<br /><br />MTA New York City Transit introduces the 30-Day MetroCard Balance Protection Program. Now, when you purchase a 30-Day Unlimited Ride MetroCard, you&#039;ll be protected from loss or theft of the card as long as you purchase it with a credit, debit, or ATM card from a MetroCard Vending Machine.<br /><br />Simply call 212-METROCARD (212-638-7622) and supply us with the number of the credit, debit, or ATM card you used to purchase your MetroCard. We will credit your account with a prorated value of $2.53 per day remaining on your 30 days based on the date you notify us of the loss. You will not receive a replacement MetroCard.<br /><br />You can file up to two claims per calendar year. The first claim will be processed free of charge; a second claim will be subject to a $5.00 administrative handling fee that will be deducted from the refund amount.

				Actually, yeah, the refund probably your easiest option (assuming YOU didn&#039;t pay cash), can you just do that? I had to report mine lost once and the refund posted to my credit card a couple days later. Took maybe 5 minutes on the phone. If I&#039;m counting the days right, you have 25 days left on the card you want to sell, so you&#039;ll get about 63 dollars back.<br /><br />Of course, I found the lost Metrocard 10 minutes after I reported it lost. I had looked ALL OVER for it, and then there it was.

				Hey thanks guys.&nbsp; Hmm..what to do.&nbsp; I am hesitant to report it lost because a few months ago I actually did lose my metro card, and you are limited to 2 per year.&nbsp; And I am thinking, well what if I lose my card again..?&nbsp; I don&#039;t have a backup option for losing my card, though for selling it, I do.&nbsp; Whatever I do though, I need to do sooner than later&nbsp; :oops:

				If you lost your card the first time before January 1st of this year then it should reset the calendar year (at least according to what Daisy posted earlier) so you are back up to two chances to lose it.<br /><br />
