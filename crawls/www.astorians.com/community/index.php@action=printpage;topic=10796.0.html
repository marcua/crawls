				Does anyone have any opinions on preK&#039;s in Astoria? I have to make a decision and I&#039;ve visited Queensview, Most Precious Blood, St. Francis and Kid Krazy. The other option would be to send them to PS 85. Can anyone tell me anything about these or any other schools?

				I am partial to Most Precious Blood.&nbsp; My son goes to the grammer school (he is just finishing up 2nd grade) and my daughter will be going to the Pre-K program in Sept.&nbsp; I am happy with the program.&nbsp; My son was going to the Early childhood center for 2 years (when he was 3) and he was happy there.&nbsp; He played, made friends &amp; learned in a nice environment.&nbsp; The staff, teachers are nice &amp; they listen to your concerns should you have any.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck with your decision!

				I highly recommend Kid Krazy. My daughter currently attends the school and I can&#039;t express the positive change in her. A freind of mine had a child graduate from their Pre-K class and was accepted to a gifted program and she gives alot of credit to Kid Krazy. I hope this helps.

				Two of my children went to Preschool at PS 85. It was such a great experience that i kept them in the school!! The Pre K teachers are wonderful and PS 85 is a very supportive school.

				Hi there-<br />I guess it also all depends on what your location is.<br />I can definitely recommend Immaculate Conception School for Pre-k. My son is in the 4th grade now and has been going there since 1st grade! The school is a strong school and they just got a new Msgr who is GREAT!<br />You will just fall in love with the teachers there and the school itself. And to be honest, the monthly tuition fee is still not that bad compared to the Daycare centers and other private schools.<br />They also have a website if you want to ck it out.<br /><br />&nbsp;http://www.icsastoria.org/<br />
