As this article pointed out, we&#39;re not really organized enough and it would be very difficult to gauge. I do feel it&#39;s ridiculous to assume any group is more or less moral, though. (And though publicly &quot;atheists,&quot; neither Stalin nor Hitler truly were, they&#39;re often sited as proof that as a group we&#39;re less moralistic, the only one I might say this is true of is Mao.)<br /><br />My parents were raised Catholic, both of them moved away from any form of structured religious belief when they were teenagers; my mother agnostic, my dad, atheist ... I was never even christened, and was raised somewhere in between the two. I never had a problem with right or wrong. I was, more often than not, made to feel wrong by other kids and even family members who, yeah, were honestly frightened by someone who had no concept of god and said they didn&#39;t believe in one. Without any knowledge of what it means to be a part of a church and subscribe to a set of religious beliefs, though, I&#39;ve never really understood where that fear comes from. However, the strong reactions people have when it comes up continue to fascinate me.<br />

				I should maybe have prefaced this by first saying that I have friends who are atheists, as well as friends that are religious, and quite active in their church.&nbsp; When I think of the negative aspects of organized religion, I think of the mob mentality that often goes with it.&nbsp; Obviously, not every church will breed this, and in most cases, probably doesn&#39;t.&nbsp; And atheists don&#39;t really congregate, so they don&#39;t really have an opportunity to create that mob mentality.&nbsp; I just get frustrated by people like Pat Robertson, or James Dobson, or Falwell.&nbsp; They truly scare the sh*t out of me.&nbsp; And I think there is a level of arrogance with having complete certainty that your way IS the right way, that I just can&#39;t ascribe to.&nbsp; It just leads to intollerance and limits the opportunities one might have to learn from others.&nbsp; I think religion in it&#39;s purist, unadulterted form, can be a beautiful thing.&nbsp; And I feel the same way about atheism, if it gives each person a piece of what they&#39;re looking for.

				I&#39;m giving betty the benefit of the doubt and assuming that she meant that &quot;most people who are taught at an early age that there is a supreme being&quot; are the ones who are associating atheism with depression, etc. And she&#39;s saying that it&#39;s because they can&#39;t imagine what it&#39;s like to live without belief, since they equate belief with hope.<br /><br />Of course, to all those people, I say, &quot;Get an imagination.&quot; It&#39;s entirely possible to have a healthy mind when you live without religious belief. That&#39;s because we have belief in other things, mankind being one of them. We also are not ones to shake our fists at the heavens, blaming a god for our problems. Instead, we find the real cause to our problems and blame that. If we are to blame, ourselves, so be it. That in mind, you think it&#39;d be easier for people to trust us.<br /><br />

				Clarification of terms:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Agnosticism is the philosophical view that the truth or falsity of certain claims—particularly theological claims regarding the existence of God or gods—is unknown, unknowable, or incoherent. Some agnostics infer from this that these claims are irrelevant to life</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Gnosticism is a historical term for various mystical initiatory religions, sects and knowledge schools which were most active in the first few centuries of the Christian/Common Era, around the Mediterranean and extending into central Asia.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">These systems typically recommend the pursuit of mysticism or &quot;special knowledge&quot; (gnosis) as the central goal of life. They also commonly depict creation as a mythological struggle between competing forces of light and dark, and posit a marked division between the material realm, typically depicted as under the governance of malign forces (such as the demiurge), and the higher spiritual realm from which it is divided, governed by God (the Monad) and the Aeons.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Atheism, in its broadest sense, is an absence of belief in the existence of gods. This definition includes both those who assert that there are no gods, and those who make no claim about whether gods exist or not. Narrower definitions, however, often only qualify those who assert there are no gods as atheists, labelling the others as agnostics or simply non-theists.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Although atheists often share common concerns regarding empirical evidence and the scientific method of investigation and a large number are skeptics, there is no single ideology that all atheists share. Additionally, there are certain individuals whose religious or spiritual beliefs some might describe as atheistic, though those holding such beliefs do not normally describe themselves as atheists.<br /><br />Atheism includes, but is not equivalent to, the position of antitheism, the active opposition to theism.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />above taken from Wikipedia<br /><br />I do think that most people would agree with me that the vernacular definition of Atheism is a complete lack of belief.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I am simply stunned.<br /><br />I cannot believe that I read this whole thread and survived without puking.<br /><br /><em>&quot;Atheism is generally associated with severly depressed or otherwise mentally ill people.&quot;</em><br /><br />Gee, I wonder how this would have been received if only one word had been changed.<br /><br /><em>Christianity</em> is generally associated with severly depressed or otherwise mentally ill people.<br /><br /><em>Judaism</em> is generally associated with severly depressed or otherwise mentally ill people.<br /><br />I guess while I was just growing old, society has developed new prejudices. Now we can bash Atheists, overweight people, smokers—to name a few—and get away with it. I guess it is considered better than the old bashing victims. Now it is okay to be pompous in our bashing. Make what I believe in sound better than what you believe in. Nonsense. Denigrating anyone, for any reason is not okay. Not okay to say, not okay to think. Only a morally bankrupt person would bash another for their beliefs.<br /><br />I have a few questions to throw out here:<br /><br />1) When was the last time we ever heard about an Atheist commiting a street crime?<br />2) How many people on death row have suddenly become practicing Atheists?<br />3) How many Atheists have ever been involved in modern-era ethnic cleansing?<br />5) When was the last time we ever heard about an Atheist commiting white-collar crime?<br /><br />There can <em>never</em> be any intelligent discussion that can follow the quoted sentence.<br /><br />Society (the term itself disturbs me) seems to always be defined to gaiun points in any discussion of this kind.

Plain and simple. However, some atheists still make a wish before they blow out their birthday candles, for example. That&#39;s a tradition that&#39;s connected to &quot;religious ideas.&quot; So is celebrating Christmas (though I&#39;m in it for the godless commercialism). So is reading your horoscope. If you have this need to define every single term, you&#39;re going to have to define that one as well.<br /><br />Otherwise, you&#39;re just going to have to trust that the people on this forum know what an atheist is.

				Greetings all. Having a history of being raised in a somewhat conservative Christian family I don&#39;t think Betty is too far off by saying that the general understanding of athiesm is associated with hopeless and depressed people. (I make this assertion because the majority of people in this country are Christian or connected to it in a significant way, and I think that the Christian paradigm is strong enough that many of these people will feel the same way I did in the past.)<br /><br />I believe the reason for this is because Christians are taught from a very early age to put all of life&#39;s hopes, dreams, and day to day trust in Jesus. While this might sound strange to an outsider who was not raised in this paradigm I want to assure you that this is as real as the child&#39;s view that their parents are all-powerful as well. A child&#39;s entire life revolves around that of their parents and one&#39;s sense of security, of hope, love etc are all wrapped up in them. [I should insert here that I still consider myself connected to Christianity in some ways, and I don&#39;t believe that humans are the highest of all beings. So I do identify to varying degrees to what various religious folks feel. I&#39;m just trying&nbsp; to explain in a clear way the feelings I&#39;ve felt, I don&#39;t want to say that all religious people are children.] I think everyone these days experiences this when we invest our hopes in a relationship, business, a home, a friend etc. For Christians though I think that &quot;Jesus&quot; is a huge part of their identity though, past, present, and future. And it absolutely is very real.<br /><br />It seems perfectly reasonable that taking away something (physical or imaginary) that someone has put all their hopes and dreams into their entire lives would lead to a period of depression, this is easily seen when people&#39;s homes burn down or they lose a loved one. For Christians, Jesus is, at a minimum, just as powerful as this. So then, from the Christian paradigm, to come across someone who doesn&#39;t believe in such a figure (or a higher being etc) falsely means to them that this person has no place to put their hopes, dreams. Christians live day to day for a vision of a future utopian society created by Jesus, and a mansion on a hilltop built by Him - everything physical is linked through the Jesus paradigm. So from the perspective of a Christian you can easily see how they misunderstand athiests as being spiritually bankrupt and depressed people. If they can&#39;t place their trust in Jesus, and Jesus is the highest thing that someone can think of, then someone who doesn&#39;t believe in Jesus must be sad and we should feel sorry for them.<br /><br />I don&#39;t think in most cases it&#39;s because they seek to stereotype or mistreat people, but simply because for most it&#39;s too difficult to try and think out of their own paradigm. <br /><br />Sadly however, difficulty to think outside one&#39;s own paradigm seems to be status-quo these days no matter what religion, nationality, or gender you are.<br /><br />Anyway, I just thought I&#39;d chime in and say after reading the entire thread straight through just now I didn&#39;t think Betty was trying to piss anyone off. I just think a couple of her posts were a little dry and needed some back explanation behind them so they wouldn&#39;t come across as trying to start a fight. <br /><br />This is a really interesting topic though, I hope it doesn&#39;t die over what I perceive as just misunderstanding.

				<strong>merm</strong>: While I find your explanation eloquent and sensitive, I must restate my original point. <br /><br />{THE QUOTE THINGY WILL NOT WORK FOR ME} <br /><em>&quot;So from the perspective of a Christian you can easily see how they misunderstand athiests as being spiritually bankrupt and depressed people. If they can&#39;t place their trust in Jesus, and Jesus is the highest thing that someone can think of, then someone who doesn&#39;t believe in Jesus must be sad and we should feel sorry for them.&quot;</em><br /><br />NO, I CANNOT UNDERSTAND. I have no empathy for *anyone* who believes this way. And, to compound the situation, I believe that those people who proselytize this Christian perspective are ethically challenged. It is a subtle and dangerous form of prejudice—and I find it morally *and* ethically reprehensible. Having tunnel-vision about *any* subject exhibits a lack of self-respect. But more importantly, it displays a lack of respect for people who do not happen—or choose not— to think or believe as you do. I don&#39;t appreciate being disrespected, so I try to never disrespect anyone else.<br /><br />For 2000+ years this attitude has caused the deaths of multitudes of non-Christians. Christian missionaries who are sent to convert have been killed <em>en masse</em> for their intrusion into other cultures. Yet they continue today . . . in Iraq. Their zeal would have better been placed encouraging people to just live decent, healthy and responsible lives rather than exploiting and allienating those who believe differently. <br /><br />We live in a diverse community. We all know the derogatory expletives used to describe *other* religions. I have always wondered where these hurtful words come from. Even as a child I heard them. May I ask an impertinent question here? How come there are no disrespectful terms used to describe Christians? Perhaps it is because people of other persuasions have been so hurt by being called names that they don&#39;t choose to do the same? If that is the case, then by inference, wouldn&#39;t it also mean that it is the Christian community that made-up and uses all those names? Just a thought!<br /><br />Additionally, I have a few personal observations. I have never met an uneducated Atheist. I have never met an unmotivated Atheist. I have never met a socially irresponsible Atheist.<br /><br />To denigrate someone you simply do not understand is wrong. If Christians cannot understand Atheism then how dare they make moral judgments. In fact, how dare *anyone* make a moral judgment about *anything* they don&#39;t understad. <br /><br />As adults we are obligated to review ourselves as people. That includes our beliefs. If we wish to remain as we were taught as children, fine. If not, fine. I spent 2 years studying Comparative Religions. The dogma, the guilt, the positive and negative effect on human lives from birth to death.&nbsp; <br /><br />Atheists have maintained that the existence of evil makes the existence of God improbable. In particular, Atheists assert that theism does not provide an adequate explanation for the existence of seemingly gratuitous evil, such as the suffering of innocent children. Theists commonly defend the existence of evil by claiming that God desires that human beings have the freedom to choose between good and evil, or that the purpose of evil is to build human character, such as the ability to persevere. Atheists counter that justifications for evil in terms of human free will leave unexplained why, for example, children suffer because of genetic diseases or abuse from adults. Arguments that G-d allows pain and suffering to build human character fail, in turn, to explain why there was suffering among animals before human beings evolved and why human character could not be developed with less suffering than occurs in the world. For Atheists, a better explanation for the presence of evil in the world is that G-d does not exist. Simple. No? I can see no depression or sadness in that.<br /><br />&nbsp;. . . to be continued by someone else<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				These descriptions are great.&nbsp; I, for one, am definitely learning a lot.&nbsp; <br /><br />Atheism is a very interesting subject!&nbsp; I think that one of the reasons why it is so frightful an ideal for &#39;religious minded&#39; people is that it challenges their whole belief system.&nbsp; No other religion does that.&nbsp; Other religions replace believing in one power with another.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was raised by people of many different faiths.&nbsp; (Jewish, Roman Catholic, Protestant, Born-again Christian, Buddist.)&nbsp; Occasionally I would sneak out of Sunday service to go to a gospel church.&nbsp; I learned a lot from each of them.<br /><br />From seeing each of the religions from a childs perspective, I could see the similarities between them without judgement.&nbsp; I understood that religion was used as a community building tool.&nbsp; Major life events (weddings, births, deaths) are celebrated within the various faiths as a way to keep traditional &#39;values&#39; or to keep a community together.&nbsp; <br /><br />I however, have never, even from an early age felt that I should believe what anyone else does.&nbsp; I think that beliefs are so intensly personal that they are to be yours alone.&nbsp; &nbsp;I could never understand how people could pray to a god together.&nbsp; <br /><br />I do not respect religious people who try to get others to believe what they do.&nbsp; When I was young, various church officials coaxed me into saying prayers, taking oaths, and making promises.&nbsp; I find that practice to be completely inhumane.&nbsp; To scare a child into taking on a religion by telling them they will otherwise be less of a person, spend eternity in hell or let down your family is as unholy as it comes.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, I do respect religious institutions for creating a place to which people can go to feel their faith, socialize with their neighbors, get counceling, celebrate life events and more.&nbsp; <br /><br />There&#39;s a great short story called &quot;Salvation&quot; by Langston Hughes that this discussion brought to my mind.&nbsp; It is the story of a boy who is coming of age and must now join the flock at his church by &#39;seeing god&#39;.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

It is to me, by its very nature, divisive. What are the events in Northern Ireland if not the result of a perceived challenge to each side&#39;s religious beliefs? And in this case, Protestants and Catholics, we aren&#39;t even talking about two polar opposite systems. Or how about the Hindus and the Muslims? Or the Jews and the Muslims?

				NYCMacUser:<br /><br />I don&#39;t think that just because someone (say Christians) don&#39;t understand the position of anyone else (athiest) that this means they are closed minded or suffer from tunnel vision. I think that making judgements about people, and having difficulty understanding their perspective is normal. But I don&#39;t think that lack of understanding automatically implies a lack of ethics or morals on someone&#39;s part. Just because children for example don&#39;t understand X doesn&#39;t mean they are immoral or unethical. Their paradigm just doesn&#39;t yet encompass certian perspectives, but this doesn&#39;t at all mean that children are close minded.

Or do you mean that it&#39;s ok to not have empathy or respect for people who themselves don&#39;t have empathy or respect for someone else?<br /><br />What you seem to be saying is that we should all repect and have empathy for everyone, especially those we don&#39;t understand. EXCEPT it&#39;s ok to not have empathy or respect for anyone that doesn&#39;t have empathy or respect anyone else.<br /><br />I&#39;ll end with a quote from you:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">To denigrate someone you simply do not understand is wrong. ... how dare *anyone* make a moral judgment about *anything* they don&#39;t understad.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think all I&#39;m getting here is that trying to understand each other is difficult, and to make judgements is human and we all do it all the time, every day. I tend to agree with you, that we shouldn&#39;t be so quick to make judgements about, and disrespect others. But I also think it&#39;s quite common both inside and outside Christian circles and operates independant of religious belief. Somewhere a line gets crossed and people start thinking that &quot;Christians&quot; or &quot;Athiests&quot; are the problem. I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s the case. Making that argument, as you&#39;ve pointed out, is what gets people killed.<br /><br />I don&#39;t think Christians are the problem, or even &quot;a&quot; problem. I think the problem is something else. Even Christians subscribe to the belief of &quot;respect everyone unless they don&#39;t respect anyone.&quot; You can&#39;t tell much about a person&#39;s character based on how friendly, open-minded, and respectful they are with their friends. You learn about someone&#39;s character when you see how they treat their enemy.<br /><br />Being open-minded, and non-judgemental cuts two ways. If we want to (and I do) create a society in which we respect everyone, and are open-minded then it&#39;s going to have to start with you and me. Problem is it&#39;s always just too easy to not respect someone else because they are not respectful people themselves.

				<strong>merm:</strong><br /><br />{THE QUOTE THINGY WILL NOT WORK FOR ME—I wish someone could fix it for me} <br /><em>&quot;I think that making judgements about people, and having difficulty understanding their perspective is normal. But I don&#39;t think that lack of understanding automatically implies a lack of ethics or morals on someone&#39;s part.&quot;</em><br /><br />This leaves me somewhat confused. Making uninformed judgements is, by definition, prejudice. Prejudice implies/infers/is defined by a lack of ethics and/or morals; a lack of self-respect and a lack of respect for another person; tunnel-vision and closed mindedness.<br /><br />Having difficulty understanding someone else perspective is normal. HUH? Religion is an abstract. It might be okay to have difficulty understanding someone elses perspective if they state that the earth is square. We already have sufficient evidence to refute that. But, when an Atheist states that they cannot, or do not, believe in G-d, or when a Jewish person states that they do not believe in Jesus, or when a Buddhist states that they do not believe in a creator G-d, why is understanding even open to subjectivity? These are things that simply need to be accepted as someone elses truths. Who are we to question another&#39;s truths or beliefs? Especially when these truths and beliefs do no harm to anyone else. It is not as though we are dealing with a cult of extremists who believe that the raping of their women and molesting of their children are part of a religious exercise! These people would be morally bankrupt.<br /><br />I, personally, *never* feel the *need* to understand someone elses perspective. I am, however, socially obligated to *accept* their beliefs. If the attempt to understand causes denigration, then as adults we must learn to stop judging. This is a very esoteric subject, which is why, perhaps, that one cannot find an uneducated Atheist.<br /><br /><em>&quot;Or do you mean that it&#39;s ok to not have empathy or respect for people who themselves don&#39;t have empathy or respect for someone else?&quot;</em><br /><br />Yes. That is exactly what I mean. <br /><br />I am so totally fed up with having to live in a racist (prejudice) capitalist society, populated by judgemental people who have their heads stuck up their a**es, that I no longer care to make time to show respect and/or empathy for the *truly* morally bankrupt.<br /><br />Whew! That really felt good to get off my (old, droopy) chest!

If you’re going to say these monsters were that way because they were atheists, then you must also conclude that their upbringing contributed to their actions, as well as their personalities, and the specific point in history they came to power. <br /><br />Neither can you ignore the compliance of those who blindly carried out the orders of these regimes. Not only did they accept the taking away of their freedom to practice their religions (most practiced in the privacy of their homes, they did not stop believing), they also went out and performed for their leader. My feeling is, this type of thing has nothing to do with either being a non-believer or believer, it is simply an ugly, and in my mind, incomprehensible aspect of human nature (see Rwanda).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=1800.msg11604.html#msg11604">Quote from: daveed on March 27, 2006, 12:41:12 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Where I find the more troubled souls are those who say they profess a belief (or lack thereof), but are deep down constantly questioning themselves.

				Just caught this … totally goofy, but kind of like the spirit of it (am I allowed to use that word?   :wink: …) <br /><br />From the <em>Voice</em>:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">eBay Atheist<br />Emerging markets: Souls, for sale and/or saving<br />by Julian Dibbell<br />March 20th, 2006 1:05 PM<br /><br />In the future, no marketing textbook will be complete without a chapter on Hemant Mehta, the 22-year-old who last month sold his soul on eBay. It&#39;s not that he made a killing on the item itself, which at a closing bid of $504 presumably sold for a loss, but on the upside, whoa—the stunt has racked up several ad campaigns&#39; worth of exposure for the product he was actually marketing: atheism as a wholesome American way of life.<br /><br />A dedicated nonbeliever, Mehta auctioned his soul on the following terms: For every $10 bid to win, he would attend an hour of services at a local house of worship of the winner&#39;s choosing. He promised to keep an open journal of his experience and an open mind to the possibility of conversion. The bait was the chance to win him over for God, but only the purest of souls could fail to see the hook in Mehta&#39;s own bid to sell atheism as just another strand in our glorious tapestry of beliefs.<br /><br />Happily, the winning bidder turned out to be an equally canny marketer—liberal evangelical Jim Henderson, apparently bent on re-branding Christianity with an eye to the NPR demographic—and the comedy of ironies has come full circle. As Mehta blogs away on both Henderson&#39;s site and his own, each party markets his constituency to the other&#39;s as a nonthreatening alternative, Henderson welcoming Mehta&#39;s feedback on the &quot;product&quot; he&#39;s sampling in various local churches, Mehta charmingly relaying atheist jokes (&quot;Did you know Atheists have a holiday? It&#39;s on April 1st!&quot;). The crowning irony being, of course, that both are righter than they know. Where markets reign supreme, even the most passionate of beliefs is just a lifestyle choice compared to that ultimate of values, the sales price.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Henderson’s site: http://www.off-the-map.org/atheist/<br /><br />Mehta’s site: http://www.ebayatheist.blogspot.com/

				Beliefs are so personal that they should be yours alone.&nbsp; I find it utterly blasphomous that there are people out there who coax others into believing what they believe.&nbsp; One of the worst ways of doing so is missionary work.&nbsp; Religious people going into an extremely deparate country, giving food, shelter, and clean water.&nbsp; But their charity comes with a price.&nbsp; Give up your precious beliefs and instead take on the beliefs of those who have been so generous.<br /><br /><br />

				The question of which side may be right may never be answered.&nbsp; However, there is one area wherein atheism is <span class="bbc_u">unquestionably</span> better than religion:<br /><br />For some reason religious folk feel compelled to spike my placid sunday mornings by knocking on my door, with their cheap handouts and spiel about how Jesus loves me.&nbsp; :x<br /><br />If Jesus really loved me he&#039;d stop you from bothering me.&nbsp; Don&#039;t get up so early on sunday!&nbsp; Go out saturday night, have a few drinks, give the spouse a shag and sleep in on sunday with the Times and bagels.&nbsp;

				I believed in a god just like I believed in santa and the easter bunny. I was young, and that is what I was told. I think believing in a god, or a force, helps people get through life without wasting precious time and energy on questions we can&#039;t answer, so I think if it works for you, more power to you.

				My grandfather used to wonder, &quot;Remember when Jesus said, &#039;He who is without sin should cast the first stone&#039;? Well, Jesus was supposedly without sin, why didn&#039;t HE throw a stone??&quot; <br /><br />I believed while growing up, then begged out of continued religious instruction once I was confirmed. My reasoning was that I already knew Jesus was great, what more did I need at that point? Then I grew fed up with the hypocracy of people being able to sin all week, only to go to confession on Sunday and start from scratch on Monday. Just plain silly.<br /><br />Began volunteering at the cat shelter as a way of getting out of Sunday morning mass with my mother, b/c I *knew* there was no way she could argue with that! &quot;God would rather see me doing this, I&#039;m sure.&quot; <br /><br />That&#039;s when I decided it was more important to DO good things than PRAY over them. And while nobody&#039;s perfect, you should do your best and not judge too harshly- few situations are black and white. <br /><br />And yeah, when I started thinking about Catholicism from the vantage point of an outsider, I realized how silly it DOES look! <br /><br /><em>Everybody on your knees<br />Fiddle with your rosaries<br />Bow your heads with great respect and<br />Genuflect, genuflect, genuflect....</em>&nbsp; :-D<br /><br />

				Handyman-Bill Hicks is a dear departed genious.<br /><br />MegC-i was stuck in catholic institutions from kindergarten all through to and including college (Fordham U, Home of the Jesuists, you know the Inquisition guys....yeesh). <br />I had something extremely traumatic happen when i was in the 7th grade which got me thinking in two totally different ways. 1)i must be a bad catholic and should pray more and all that...so i started praying more. and 2)regardless of how much i pray or go to church, if i am still a child of god, why would god allow something so bad to happen? and what good is all this praying going to do? aren&#039;t there tons of people who are good but yet get s___ on constantly?<br /><br />Roundabout the beginning of high school fed up with more religion classes (seriously if i went through 8 years of this day in day out, do i really need to relearn the holy days of obligation? and i had classmates who thought thanksgiving was one...so i guess that&#039;s why) i started reading about other religions. i thought they were all so interesting, and i loved reading about ancient religions like druidism, and wicca since the catholic church stole most of it to co opt it into their religion to make it easier to convert (look you can still have your holidays, just now you&#039;re celebrating one god instead of 10). i started noticing how close the words good and god are and evil and devil. the birth of the sun god coinciding with christmas, the birth of the son of god and i started wondering if this wasn&#039;t all just made up. then as i got more &quot;wordly&quot; understanding the gay community, unwed pregnant mothers with no recourse and what not i started to think the church had a very unchristian like way of interacting with the entire community. but still through high school i considered myself agnostic not yet atheist. <br />then comes faith and critical reasoning at Fordham...oddly taught by a rabbi. this was the class where i questioned every last thing the professor ever told us. and she could never give me an answer. my classmates would tell me whenever they saw me that they loved the questions that i would ask and that i would basically play stump the professor. there were a few times where i told her that her answer was not good enough. i wrote at least 2 papers about the bible really being just a way to subjucate women and certain parts of society and inflicting a contradictory moral code on it&#039;s followers. the more and more this woman spoke the more and more i questioned her (and for this class i actually had to read the bible from the start and i did...i&#039;ve read most of it at this point, not all but most so i could quote it at her). the more i questioned her the more i questioned religion and the more i came to believe (this is my own personal opinion and is by no way an insult to any one who follows) that religion, especially christianity is bullshit. i can&#039;t believe in a god who says kill gay people but then his son says love everyone. god loves everyone...but i&#039;m going to make you kill your son to see if you love me more than him. i mean seriously, what the hell? almost everything in the bible is a contradiction and the followers are left to choose which one to follow. one catholic will follow the love everyone teachings of jesus. other catholics will quote leviticus and say these are the people god says we can hate AND we can kill them. he says so (it really does say that god commands his followers to kill those who lie with their own sex...it also applies to animals and your relatives). the professor gave us a survey at the beginning of the term and one to fill out after our final. both identical. her theory was that her students come out with a deeper understanding of religion and they turn more into believers at the end. mine was all full of basically what i have said. knowing i was an agnostic anyway she asked me about the class when i handed in my final...i was the first to finish and the whole class stopped to hear what i would say &quot;Rabbi Strauss, when i started i was an agnostic questioning everything about religion. Now that i&#039;ve had your class, i am convinced there is no god, religion is a crock and i am now thoroughly an atheist.&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks!&quot; <br /><br />i think one is quite capable of having a moral compass and know the difference between right and wrong. i don&#039;t need a religion to tell me that. i don&#039;t concern myself with what happens after i die. i&#039;m dead, there&#039;s no more thinking. rather than live for a glorious afterlife, i choose to live a beautiful life. if it&#039;s something you need then great for you. it&#039;s just not for me. i worship the human spirit, at the altar of myself. i celebrate its endurance and its beauty. i have no room for god in my life. if i did i would overlook all the beauty and bounty of nature and my fellow man. not to mention myself.

				Dr. Laura Schlesinger is a radio personality who dispenses advice to people who call in to her radio show. Recently, she said that, as an observant Orthodox Jew, homosexuality is an abomination according to Leviticus 18:22 and cannot be condoned under any circumstance.<br /><br />The following is an open letter to Dr. Laura penned by an East Coast resident, which was posted on the Internet. It is funny, as well as informative.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Dear Dr. Laura:<br /><br />Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding G-d&#039;s Law. I have learned a great deal from your show, and try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind him or her that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate. I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the other specific laws and how to follow them.<br /><br />When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord - Lev.1:9. The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?<br /><br />I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?<br /><br />I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness - Lev.15:19-24. The problem is how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.<br /><br />Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can t I own Canadians?<br /><br />I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?<br /><br />A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination - Lev. 11:10, it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I do not agree. Can you settle this?<br /><br />Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of G-d if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?<br /><br />Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though Lev. 19:27 expressly forbids this. How should they die?<br /><br />I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?<br /><br />My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? - Lev.24:10-16. Couldn&#039;t we just burn them to death at a private family affair like the one we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev.20:14)<br /><br />I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that G-d&#039;s word is eternal and unchanging.<br /><br />Your devoted fan,<br />Moshe<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

There is no assumption of knowledge in refusing to accept mystical assertions. The assumption of knowledge is solely made by the positive claimant, &quot;There is such a thing as a [fill in supernatural entity].&quot; The atheist simply replies, &quot;Your claim about the existence of the supernatural has no basis in fact.&quot; What an atheist chooses to believe in... well, that would be something other than (though likely informed by) his/her atheistic stance. Atheism per se makes no positive claims.<br /><br />The atheist, unlike the devout [fill in your mystical belief system of choice), not only remains open to, but in fact invites any and all new data about the world. As new data have emerged that progressively chip away at &quot;what god is or does&quot;, devout mystics desperately find new ways of justifying their insistence on mumbo jumbo, but even most of them realize that there&#039;s a difference between &quot;what they know&quot; and &quot;what they have faith in&quot;.

				Aw jeez.&nbsp; Well here comes a whole &#039;nother discussion which goes beyond religion/atheism: Can one be absolutely sure about anything?&nbsp; Socrates would negative nod.<br /><br />Yes, religion is not based on scientific method reasoning structure.&nbsp; It is based on a faith based reasoning structure.&nbsp; There is no inherent superiority of scientific method over faith.&nbsp; Western civilization puts a much higher premium on the former, to the point where we have a hard time giving credence to competing reasoning structures (and also failing to truly understand cultures that are based on faith).<br /><br /><br />p.s. - Loved the entourage episode when Aris&#039; wife said &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; in synagogue on Yom Kippur.&nbsp;

				I prefer the term agnostic. &quot;I only know one thing and that is that I know nothing&quot; - Socrates ( I just love that guy..) I always took &quot;atheist&quot; to mean exactly what the definition/word is originated from. A---theist...without god...this to me implies a knowledge of an absolute, but the interpretation is up for debate the same way that what the word &quot;devout&quot; means or &quot;religious&quot;. There is too much subjectivity to get into it here. A discussion much more appropriate over a drink. <br /><br />I&#039;m comfortable with my understanding of everyone&#039;s position. Extremists on either end are a little frightening. I&#039;m miserable not knowing, but content in understanding that I don&#039;t know. (whatever that means...)<br /><br />I find the use of the word &quot;reason&quot; (as opposed to religion or god) as some scientific testable entity amusing. Ideas about religions, reason whatever ALL spur science to attempt to answer the questions that we don&#039;t have the answers to. One concept doesn&#039;t have more of a stronghold on the behaviors it ignites in scientific study.

				I can&#039;t stand the &quot;intelligent design&quot; theory. &quot;Life is so beautiful and miraculous, it could only be the result of an intelligent creator.&quot; <br /><br />Space is SO incomprehensively vast. The photos being posted lately on the internet from the Hubble telescope are of things like the explosion of a galaxy five billion light years away. That means, what we&#039;re looking at now happened five BILLION years ago already. <br /><br />In between earth and all those other stars/planets are other possibly life-sustaining planets. We will most likely never know due to the sheer vastness. Of the untold gazillions of combinations of planets/stars/galaxies, why is it so improbable that the elements took trillions of years to form something like Earth?<br /><br />And if God is some kind of talented architect, then who the hell created HIM???&nbsp; :x

				Did any of you see the debate between the &quot;Christians and the Athiests&quot; on ABC&#039;s Nightline the other night?&nbsp; http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=3148940&nbsp; They didn&#039;t show enough of the actual debate, but both groups appeared either fairly arrogant and/or stupid/annoying.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure ABC just picked the most extreme of each group to represent them, and it ended up making both groups look bad.&nbsp; The members of the Rational Response Squad squared off with Christians Kirk Cameron (from Growing Pains) and Ray Comfort about the existence of God.&nbsp; I actually felt sorry for Kirk and Ray at times because the show really didn&#039;t give them a fair shake either way.&nbsp; They appeared to genuinely want to present their side, and the show exploited and mocked them the whole time.&nbsp; There was such an air of supremacy and disrespect from the &quot;Athiests&quot;.&nbsp; The audience seemed full of eye-rollers, and people who just wanted to argue and show us how stupid the Christians were.&nbsp; Honestly, as an outsider looking on, it did not present either group in a good light at all, and if I didn&#039;t happen to be friends with both Athiests and Christians and know them not to be arrogant extremists or stupid idiots, I would have believed that these people actually represented both groups.&nbsp; I think the debate was a disservice to both sides, and it&#039;s sad that it was shown on national tv all over the country.&nbsp;

So the debate&#039;s purpose was to entertain, not inform (just as 99.9% of all other TV programs).<br /><br />

Besides, there are plenty of ugly and horrible things about life that could just as easily refute that idea if thinking along those lines. The idea that a god created all of this isn&#039;t all that comforting to me.<br /><br />I used to think about this stuff a lot and it drove me crazy, but I finally decided just to go along with it. I probably am an atheist but don&#039;t think of myself as such, moreso an agnostic, but I&#039;d probably be more surprised to find out there is a divine creator than that there is none.

I was content not feeling religious until some point in college, when the &quot;meaning of life&quot; thing finally started eating at me, continued to eat at me, and then I decided it is unknowable and moved on. While there could some day be proof that there is a God, say if He started communicating with us directly, there can never be direct proof that there is no God. And since I don&#039;t expect God to start communicating with us directly, we&#039;ll just never know until we die, at which point it&#039;s too late to be able to tell anyone else what&#039;s up.

Describe your thought process, or were these goals a revelation to you, predetermined by somebody/something else? By what standard of value do you determine that you&#039;re living a &quot;good&quot; life instead of a merely satisfactory life or a miserable life, or do you accept the determinations of others that your life is good? Your goal of &quot;being content&quot;... how &quot;content&quot; is content enough? Content with your self or with the status of NYC or the world? You want to be a responsible citizen. Regardless of the laws you are asked to follow? Or would you subordinate your being a responsible citizen to your own sense of right and wrong if push came to shove over one issue or another? Or for you is responsible citizenship defined by blindly following the dictates of the state, obeying laws without question?<br /><br />Generally speaking, do you reserve the right to think about your personal goals and modify them based on new knowledge? For you is thinking critically about yourself and the world a good thing or a dangerous activity? <br /><br />When you meet new people, are you inclined to judge them before they express themselves or are you inclined to draw conclusions about them after some meaningful conversations and shared experiences?<br /><br />***<br /><br />If faith is the acceptance of propositions as true for which no evidence is demonstrable, then please describe how exactly it is possible for it to be beneficial to you or any person *at all*. Reason, the faculty of logically integrating sensory data and conceptual frameworks, has demonstrable survival value. <br /><br />For every problem we face... personal relationship issues, political conflicts, plumbing problems, the crises that follow natural disasters... whether it&#039;s of human creation or not, there is no credible alternative to reason for attempting solutions. Illogical thinking? Evading reality? Denying the evidence of our senses? Eschewing trial and error methodology? Prejudging people?<br /><br />Frappe, I don&#039;t know why you&#039;re trying to make it seem like faith and reason are equivalent in any way. You seem to take the differences for granted. Wherefore your faith in faith?

				I surmized my goals in response to the &quot;if your goal is truth&quot; line to ask, what is the goal that science is relentlessly pushing forward to?&nbsp; When do you score that touchdown?&nbsp; Spike the ball and say &quot;We&#039;ve made it!&quot;?&nbsp; What do you do after you won?&nbsp; If you are not content with yourself, then what was the point?&nbsp; And in that respect, I do not see how you can make a case for the superiority of scientific method over faith.&nbsp; Regardless, most American folk subscribe more to faith than science.&nbsp; Instead of praying to Yahweh, Vishnu or Jupiter they pray to Mammon.&nbsp; Instead of looking to faith for happiness, they find it by working themselves to death to afford the gadgets they never had a need for until they saw a commercial for it on the television.<br /><br />I can&#039;t see how responsible citizenship has anything to do with this, I feel it&#039;s the undertaking of civic duties in order to maintain our constitution in the manner which our forefathers intended.&nbsp; Patriotism is not bombing the crap out of a foreign land.&nbsp; It&#039;s always questioning the motives of our government and guarding against domestic tyrannies of either the minority or the majority.&nbsp; Obey the laws one disagree&#039;s with if they are enacted within the libertarian spirit of our constitution.&nbsp; Disobey all others.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think this is a really cool topic, but it&#039;s getting too long for a text forum.&nbsp; Any takers to yip-yap about this over drinks?<br />&nbsp;
