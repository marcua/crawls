				From what I hear, lots of water actually makes a good replacement for lack of coffee in the Morning. Some of what your body may be craving could also be sugar, which is much better coming from Orange Juice. Good luck kicking the habit :mrgreen:

				I recently attempted to cut out my 5 cups/day - BIG mistake. I had headaches, was lethargic and pretty bitchy too. I tried the green tea, then black tea (because I was told it has more caffeine), then even just drinking one cup of black (yuck!). <br /><br />Prior to quitting I had really begun to resent my addiction. I hated the idea that something had such a hold of me, but I was physically feeling so awful and suffering from withdrawal symptoms that I had to compromise - <br /><br />I am now a 3 cup/day-er, but I did cut down to 1% milk and cut down my sugar. I feel much better all around.<br /><br />I just realized that I am not answering your question, sorry, I guess I am trying to say, &quot;I relate.&quot;<br /><br />Good luck, try the stronger teas (go to Freeze Peach - they&#039;ll tell you all about tea) and munch on chocolate covered coffee beans (soooooo great) late in the afternoon.<br /><br />If you can make it, my hat is off to you.

				Get up early in the morning- first thing: drink a big glass of water because this will raise your metabolism. Eat a small bowl of cereal with milk and then go out for a jog. The outdoor exercise will also raise your metabolism, atleast for the first half of the day, if not longer. This works for me! I drink green tea, I&#039;m not much of a coffee drinker. On your lunch break go out for some fresh air, drink plenty of water as per casicua&#039;s advice. Hang in there! You&#039;re doing a good thing!

				I slowly added more and more [quality] decaf to my regular coffee until it was just 1/5 real stuff.&nbsp; Then it wasn&#039;t as hard to stop altogether.&nbsp; During the transition, I also switched to skim milk and splenda instead of whole milk and sugar -- something I never thought was possible.&nbsp; I think with coffee, it&#039;s easier to ween off than stop cold turkey.&nbsp;

				ok, ill bite. what&#039;s wrong with coffee? <br />I don&#039;t drink/smoke/do drugs either, but the amount of coffee I drink scares people. I used to have at least 6 cups a day during work, and most of the time another cup or 3 during dinner. and I still would if my café hadn&#039;t closed and I hadn&#039;t left my job that was next door to a deli. <br />when I started the new job and couldn&#039;t have my once an hour coffee run, I broad flavored tea into work to drink as a substitue. I happen to hate tea. but I suffered thru the cups a couple times a week until everytime I get a coffee craving and I think of the tea, I get so neauseaded (no spell check on my phone) I would just drink water instead. <br />so I guess my advise is substitue coffee with a beverage you hate :)

				My doctor told me in November I had to stop drinking coffee.&nbsp; I only usually drink two or three cups per day, not even that much.&nbsp; I tried so hard to switch to decaf, switch to tea, switch to water.&nbsp; I stopped for maybe a month, and now I&#039;m back on the wagon again.&nbsp; If I don&#039;t have my morning cup, I&#039;m at least a half hour late to everything, I&#039;m grouchy, and I get a caffeine withdrawal headache.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to stick to one cup per day now, and it&#039;s been going ok.&nbsp; Sort of.&nbsp; Until I get really tired around 3pm and still have a ton of work to do. :-)

				<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine<br /><br />I am curious why a doctor would tell you to give up coffee.<br />Perhaps it could be heart related.<br /><br /><br />Thanks for a lot of good advice in the posts. Reports are that a surprising number of people are functioning but should be drinking more water to be healthily hydrated.<br /><br /><br />[Hopefully the water supply is fine too]

				I&#039;m supposed to give it up because of some problems the caffeine causes me.&nbsp; I won&#039;t say more b/c I&#039;m new to this board and don&#039;t want to be impolite&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; But, like Sweeper indicated, lots of caffeine can affect your blood pressure too.&nbsp; Oh well, hopefully if I can stick to one cup per day, I&#039;ll be ok.
