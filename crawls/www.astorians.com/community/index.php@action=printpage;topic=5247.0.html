Apparently was used in Roman times and is still a popular method in the middle east.&nbsp; Slightly less painful than waxing, with less skin damage. <br />So now you know!&nbsp; :-o

				Sugaring differs from waxing, in that it only sticks to the hairs, whereas waxing sticks to&nbsp; the hair <em>and</em> the skin.&nbsp; Therefore, it&#039;s less painful.&nbsp; It&#039;s also better environmentally, as sugar is a biodegradable, natural product; wax often contains mineral oil which is a petroleum product, a byproduct of gasoline distillation.&nbsp; It also cuts down on razor waste (2 billion disposable razors end up in landfills each year).<br /><br />For more info:&nbsp; Sugaring (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugaring_%28epilation%29).

(Unless you remortgage!)&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />I&#039;ve only experienced sugaring once and it was definitely less painful than waxing, and it still takes the hair out from the roots - so there is a the same good period of time between sessions. And yes, exactly the same results.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen sites of places in Manhattan that do sugaring, but they are expensive, and I&#039;d rather keep it local if possible.<br />

				There&#039;s a spa on Newtown and 31st St on the top floor of a small building. It recently changed it&#039;s name, it was previously called HYDRA DAY SPA. I haven&#039;t had anything done there, but I do know people who have gone to this space. They seemed to like it. Might be worth checking out.

				might try Rani (beauty salon) on 30th Ave (or is it Broadway?) which seems to do &quot;natural&quot; processes (natural hair dying, henna, threading...) i heard someone got their eyebrows threaded there and had a good experience. <br /><br />i agree i&#039;d rather go to a place that has a good reputation. so i&#039;d also be interested in a good waxer.&nbsp;

				SPAce (http://www.salonspace.com/), on Ditmars between 31st and 29th, lists pricing (http://www.salonspace.com/spawax.asp?xc=70219111828&amp;xr=salonspace) for waxing for men.&nbsp; In my experience, the waxing there is perfectly adequate, neither better nor worse than I&#039;ve had done elsewhere.<br /><br />They don&#039;t list sugaring on their website that I can see, but you can always call and ask.&nbsp; Maybe if there were enough demand they would add it.

				bryanc / cabanird / lanseaux<br /><br />- thanks for the above comments, most helpful (as this site is).<br />I&#039;ll keep on seeing what other comments come through on this posting, and then should I subsequently use any of the places, then would report back on this site with the results...

				I was getting my haircut at SPAce the other day and asked about if any men came in for waxing and the lady started laughing so hard that she nearly cut me by accident. She proceeded to laugh uncontrollably for about 5 full minutes before gaining composure and asking if I was serious. When I told her that a guy on the discussion board asked about it she laughed again saying she didn&#039;t know how that would &quot;work&quot;. My guess is that she&#039;s just a bit old school.<br /><br />So for any men that are thinking of getting waxed I&#039;m thinking SPAce might not be the place to go for that. I LOVE SPAce for haircuts though. If I&#039;m ever in the market for waxing though I think I&#039;ll check out other places :)

				I know Athena&#039;s Nails on 30th avenue (32nd st?) does waxing, I haven&#039;t personally experienced that there but I do see men walking into the salon for various things, it seems reasonable enough in price if you wanted to &quot;experiment&quot; cheaply in a &quot;non-painful&quot; area???? is there such a place? Don&#039;t think they offer sugaring, but you never know...

				I would recommend you look for a place in Chelsea like &quot;Nickel&quot; on 14th st. and 8th Av.&nbsp; Or just pick up one of the gay magazines like HX or Next and they have tons of ads for men&#039;s spas.
