				A flier was recently left at my door from Kwan Japanese restaurant. They sell bubble tea. They are located at 37-04 Ditmars Blvd. I wonder if that&#039;s the place daisy was referring to on the original thread...haven&#039;t tried it yet.

				Yes, it&#039;s the one I was referring to.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t tried anything there in 3 years though so it could have changed by now.&nbsp; At the time, the bubble tea tasted old, and the food utterly flavorless.

				Just tried bubble tea today. Does anyone know where to buy the tapioca locally? I wouldn&#039;t mind making the tea at home.

				the tapioca pearls used in bubble tea are giant. and they are usually a different color like dark purple or something. it isnt something you can get at key foods. i was able to get some large tapioca in like jackson heights area, but it wasnt as large as the kind in bubble tea, maybe about half the size. boiling up this tapioca is kind of a pain.... but it really is fun to drink / eat. :)

				Wouldn&#039;t it be nice if instead of another sushi joint our Asian friends opened up a good quality Bubble Tea Palace-like the ones in Chinatown. I&#039;m no expert on bubble tea, but I really like the one (forgot the name) on Mott Street right off Canal. And you can drink it year-round. You have a choice of cold or hot, and the tea is available in so many flavors. I&#039;m sure this type of establishment would prosper. Adults and teens would come in droves-although it&#039;s maybe not for really small children-could pose a choking hazard!
