In 2004, the Commission submitted 41 recommendations to Congress that would help prevent future terrorist attacks. These recommendations ranged from giving first responders the equipment they need, to beefing up efforts to prevent WMDs from falling into terrorist hands.&nbsp; <br /><br />I, along with my colleague Congressman Christopher Shays (R-CT), founded the 9/11 Commission Caucus in 2004 and worked tirelessly to pass the Commission’s recommendations for two years under the Republican-controlled Congress.&nbsp; That Congress, however, received 5 F’s, 12 D’s, and 2 Incompletes from the 9/11 Commissioners for failing to enact most of the Commission’s reforms.&nbsp; Thankfully, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) made passing the Commission’s recommendations a top priority of the new Congress, and helped usher the new reforms into law.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Included in the new 9/11 Commission law is a provision Congressman Shays and I authored that gives the Civil Liberties Oversight Board more power and independence. The Civil Liberties and Oversight Board was established in 2004 to ensure that privacy and civil liberties concerns are fully considered when implementing anti-terrorism laws, regulations, and executive branch policies. But the Board has been widely criticized for failing to adequately enforce its decisions.&nbsp; The new law will give the Board the independence and strength it needs to do its job.<br /><br />Read more about my response to the 9/11 Commission&#039;s recommendations&gt;<br />Ending the War in Iraq<br />In July, I was proud to support legislation that would help alleviate the worst military readiness crisis our nation has faced since the Vietnam War.&nbsp; And I will be proud to support plans for the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq when Congress takes up this important issue later this month.<br /><br />In 2001, all active duty Army divisions were rated at the highest readiness levels and were fully manned, equipped, and trained. In my opinion, the Administration’s failed Iraq policies have depleted our great military and put a tremendous strain on our troops.&nbsp; <br /><br />An estimated 250,000 soldiers and Marines have served more than one tour in Iraq, and every one of the Army’s available active duty combat brigades has served at least a 12-month tour in Iraq or Afghanistan.&nbsp; This spring, the Defense Secretary announced that all active duty Army soldiers would have their tours in Iraq extended from 12 to 15 months.&nbsp; “The Ensuring Military Readiness through Stability and Predictability Deployment Policy Act” that passed the House with my support in July would make sure our armed forces are getting needed periods of rest and recuperation between deployments. <br /><br />As a member of the Out of Iraq Caucus, I will continue to support plans for the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq when the House takes the issue up again in September.<br /><br />Preventing Another Dubai Ports Debacle <br />Bipartisan legislation I introduced in the wake of the 2006 Dubai Ports scandal, the “Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007” (H.R. 556), was signed into law in July.&nbsp; This new law will reform the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and encourage safe foreign investment in the U.S. without compromising our safety and security.&nbsp; <br /><br />The need for CFIUS reform became abundantly clear when the committee green-lighted a deal to sell the operation of major U.S. ports to a company owned by the government of Dubai without any senior level review.&nbsp; In a post 9/11 world, the Dubai Ports scandal received a lot of attention from the media and spurred a public outcry for reform.&nbsp; Legislation to reform the CFIUS review process stalled in the last Congress, but the new Democratic Congress made CFIUS reform a priority. <br /><br />My new law will strengthen the system by which foreign investment in businesses in the United States is vetted for security concerns.&nbsp; It will also provide certainty and predictability to the CFIUS review process, resulting in expanded economic activity, job creation, and safe foreign direct investment. <br /><br />Helping Midtown Businesses Recover from the Steam Pipe Explosion <br />On August 9, I released the first large-scale survey of the devastating impact the July 18 Midtown steam pipe explosion had on retail businesses.&nbsp; My survey showed that the 71 businesses surveyed had collectively lost more than $1.3 million, and the lion’s share of those losses stemmed from lost business.&nbsp; Most businesses (85%) reported some monetary loss with the average loss per business coming in at $17,838.&nbsp; One business reported a whopping $400,000 in losses.<br /><br />Fewer than 10 percent of the businesses I surveyed reported having received prompt and/or useful information from either the City or Con Edison.&nbsp; In fact, many businesses had received no information at all until they were surveyed by my office.<br /><br />The businesses crippled by the steam pipe explosion are unfairly being left to cover the bulk of their losses because Con Edison is only reimbursing for physical damages, cleanup costs, and perishables.&nbsp; I believe Con Edison should be responsible for all of the losses.&nbsp; After all, who is in the best position to prepare for losses, the utility company or the individual businesses?&nbsp; The best incentive for Con Edison to prevent future disasters is to make it responsible for all the harm caused by its equipment failure.<br /><br />I have taken a number of steps to help the midtown businesses affected by the destructive steam pipe explosion.&nbsp; Each of the businesses that responded to my survey was sent information about assistance available from Con Edison, the New York City Department of Small Business Services (SBS) and the U.S. Small Business Administration. The SBA is offering low interest loans of up to $1.5 million and SBS is offering no interest loans of up to $10,000.&nbsp; I also worked with Governor Spitzer to ensure businesses were eligible for federal disaster loan assistance and held a forum for midtown business owners with representatives of SBA and SBS.<br /><br />Read the results my survey on the impact of the steam pipe explosion on local businesses &gt;<br />Read about help for Midtown Businesses from NYC Business Solutions&gt;<br />Crafting Credit Card Reform<br />Anyone with a credit card probably has a personal story about getting hit with excessive late fees or being surprised by a sudden change in terms or interest rate increase.&nbsp; As Chair of the Financial Institutions Subcommittee, I have been working to improve credit card disclosures and eliminate unfair and deceptive practices like universal default and double cycle billing.&nbsp; I have held a number of congressional hearings and meetings to determine how Congress, federal regulators, and credit card companies can work together to help improve services and protections for credit card consumers<br /><br />Earlier this month, I released credit card reform principles to help guide both industry self-regulation and legislation I’m working on.&nbsp; I have posted these principles on my website and encourage you to take a look at them and share your thoughts with me.<br /><br />There is no doubt that credit card companies provide a useful service, and that service involves a certain amount of risk.&nbsp; Credit card companies deserve to earn a fair profit, but consumers deserve to be able to understand their accounts and be empowered to control them.&nbsp; Reform must be a two-way street.&nbsp; I’m confident that my credit card reform principles will translate into reforms that everyone – card issuers, consumer groups, and members from both sides of the aisle – will want to support.<br /><br />Read more about my credit card reform principles&gt;<br />Share your thoughts with me about these principles&gt;<br />Securing Funding for the Second Avenue Subway<br />I’m pleased to report that Congressman Serrano and I were able to secure $200 million for the Second Avenue Subway project in the Transportation appropriations bill that passed the House in July.&nbsp; This is the largest infusion of federal funding to date for the Second Avenue Subway, and more is expected when the MTA and the federal government sign a full-funding grant agreement for the project.&nbsp; <br /><br />After many false starts, the Second Avenue Subway is well on its way to becoming a reality.&nbsp; When it’s completed, the new line will ease overcrowding and delays on the Lexington Avenue subway and provide a new more convenient service for many East Side commuters.&nbsp; The transportation appropriations bill still needs the approval of the Senate and the President, but I’m optimistic we’ll be able to bring this funding home to New York commuters.&nbsp; <br /><br />In related news, I also worked with the New York congressional delegation to help secure $215 million in the transportation appropriations bill for the Long Island Rail Road’s (LIRR) Manhattan East Side Access (ESA) project.&nbsp; ESA will save commuters valuable time – by some estimates as much as three hours a week – by allowing them to travel directly to Grand Central Terminal.&nbsp; It will also relieve overcrowding at Penn Station, which is already at or near capacity during rush hour and only expected to grow.&nbsp; In addition, ESA will create a new station in Sunnyside, Queens which should provide convenient service to residents of Western Queens and commuters heading to New York City’s fourth largest business district in Long Island City. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; <br />Please feel free to share this email with anyone who may be interested in these issues.&nbsp; As always, I appreciate your comments and invite you to write to me through my website. <br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />CAROLYN B. MALONEY<br />Member of Congress<br /><br />P.S. Please do not respond to this unattended email account<br />...<br /><br />&nbsp;I look forward to hearing from you!<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Congresswoman Maloney<br /><br />Washington, DC 20515-3214<br /><br /><br />Manhattan Office<br />Congresswoman Maloney<br />1651 3rd Avenue Suite 311<br /><br />&nbsp;Queens Office<br />Congresswoman Maloney<br />28-11 Astoria Blvd.<br />Astoria, NY 11102-1933<br />718 - 932-1804 phone<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_130477">&lt;abridged&gt;<br /><br /><br />May 28, 2008 - Volume V Edition IV To E-Newsletter Archives <br />&nbsp;<br />In my latest report to you from Congress, I want to share some of the great work we’ve accomplished in recent weeks.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />In this E-Newsletter:<br /><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color"><strong>Jumpstarting Our Economy<br />Ending the Iraq War<br />Making the Gender Wage Gap History<br />Advancing The Credit Cardholders’ Bill of Rights <br />Reauthorizing The Debbie Smith Act<br />Holding Government Contractors Accountable<br />Solving Our Local School Overcrowding Problem</strong></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Jumpstarting Our Economy<br />On February 13, 2008, &quot;The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008&quot; was signed into law. It will provide working families, and certain seniors and disabled veterans, with a one time tax rebate, or “stimulus check.” <br /><br />The stimulus check is a tax credit for the 2008 income tax year that is intended to help stimulate our economy. Generally, you are eligible for a stimulus check if you filed a 2007 income tax return reporting tax liability or have earned income, Social Security income, or disabled veterans’ benefits of more than $3000. <br /><br />Over the next few weeks, 8.3 million New Yorkers will be receiving stimulus checks totaling more than $6.7 billion.<br /><br /><br />Ending the Iraq War<br />I remain committed to ending the war in Iraq and bringing our troops home safe and soon. That is why I voted against continuing to fund this misguided war and for a responsible redeployment our troops on May 15 when the House passed the Fiscal Year 2008 Emergency Supplemental Act. <br /><br />The Supplemental was considered as three separate votes. I voted against the bill’s first provision to continue funding the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I voted for the second provision to redeploy our troops within 30 day’s of the bill’s enactment, with a goal of completing withdrawal of all combat troops by December 2009. And, I supported the bill’s third amendment to provide Iraq and Afghanistan veterans with a new GI Bill, extend unemployment benefits for those hardest hit by the economic downturn, and fund other pressing domestic issues. <br /><br />The Supplemental includes constructive Iraq policy restrictions and makes the economic needs of the American people a priority. Unfortunately, it remains to be seen whether or not the President will choose to sign it.<br /><br />Making the Gender Wage Gap History<br />April 22 was Equal Pay Day – a date that marks how much extra time the average American woman must work to match the wages her male counterparts earned the previous year. For example, this year, the average woman would have had to work from January 1, 2007 to April 22, 2008 to earn the same wage that a man was able to earn from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2007. <br /><br /><br />Advancing The Credit Cardholders’ Bill of Rights<br />I am pleased to report that &quot;The Credit Cardholders’ Bill of Rights&quot; (H.R. 5244), balanced legislation I introduced in February to reform major credit card industry abuses and improve consumer protections for credit cardholders, has gained tremendous momentum since my last report to you. <br /><br />Reauthorizing The Debbie Smith Act<br />I’m pleased to report that &quot;The Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act of 2008&quot; (H.R. 5057) was recently voted out of the House Judiciary Committee.&nbsp; The legislation would extend an important federal DNA backlog processing program through FY 2014 and is now headed to the House floor for a full vote.<br /><br /><br />Holding Government Contractors Accountable<br />In April, the House passed my &quot;Contractors and Federal Spending Accountability Act&quot; (H.R. 3033).&nbsp; This bill would create a comprehensive, centralized database that would more efficiently monitor the federal procurement system and help protect U.S. taxpayer dollars.&nbsp; Currently, no central database exists to track fraudulent federal contractors and prevent them from continuing to do business with the federal government.&nbsp; Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO) has introduced companion legislation in the Senate.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Why do we need this bill? Because right now, there is nothing stopping a fraudulent contractor from bouncing from federal agency to federal agency, fleecing U.S. taxpayers the whole way.&nbsp; Contractors that have repeatedly violated federal law still receive millions of dollars in contracts from the federal government.&nbsp; In fact, according to data from the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), the top 50 federal contractors have paid approximately $12 billion in fines, penalties, restitution, and settlements for more than 350 instances of misconduct since 1995.&nbsp; Nine of the top 50 federal contractors have a total of twelve resolved criminal cases totalling $161 million in penalties paid since 1995. <br /><br />Solving Our Local School Overcrowding Problem<br />Elementary schools in Manhattan, particularly those in District 2, are experiencing an overcrowding crisis. Right now, more than two-thirds of the elementary schools in District 2 operate over capacity, and several schools operate at or exceeding 150 percent of capacity. As a result, principals have been forced to cut pre-kindergarten programs, eliminate art and music programs, or schedule lunchtime early in the school day. <br /><br /><br />Read the letter we sent to Chancellor Klein&gt;<br />&nbsp;<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />&nbsp; <br />Please feel free to share this email with anyone who may be interested in these issues.&nbsp; As always, I appreciate your comments and invite you to write to me through my website. <br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />CAROLYN B.

Isn&#039;t the rape of Dutch Kills enough for our community - now is Astoria next?<br /><br />This project split the congregation and only with lobbying by the presbytery did it pass - by a vote or two. Of course the people on the block had no say in the matter.<br /><br />All this for a church with a full time minister, with full benefits and housing, who serves a congregation of at best a handful of people.<br /><br />Meanwhile, around the corner, another Presbyterian church is meeting in a synagogue. Their numbers are bursting at the seams.<br /><br />I recall her getting funding for that otehr ugly building plopped in the middle of St Georges&#039;s Churchyard and resulted in the teardown of the 150 year old Astoria Institute, the community&#039;s name sake.<br /><br />I guess she thinks working class people are too ignorant to appreciate history or to deserve development that would keep in character with their block.<br /><br />I would like to see her try these stunts in the Manhattan portion of her district. <br /><br />They would lynch her.<br /><br />&nbsp;:x</div>
