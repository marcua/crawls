			<strong>C-J</strong>:
			<br />
			Walked by this new place on Ditmars this past Saturday while running errands and the server came outside and chatted us up while we were looking at the menu.<br /><br /><br />They serve brunch all day with a full dinner menu as well so we returned on Saturday evening for dinner.<br /><br /><br />In short, the food is really terrific!&nbsp; I had the pancakes and chicken and my husband had the duck sandwich.&nbsp; The skewer and deviled egg appetizers were also great!&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Service is on point and they will have their liquor license soon.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />This is a welcomed new addition to the &#039;hood and worth checking out!&nbsp; http://www.chopchopgrubshop.com/restaurant<br /><br /><br />
