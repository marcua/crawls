				My best friend&#039;s wife gave birth to a healthy baby girl on Friday afternoon&nbsp; :mrgreen:&nbsp; <br /><br />I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for a gift.&nbsp; I sort of went &quot;all out&quot; for his first child about four years ago because like I said, he is my best friend and also the first of our little group that I grew up with to have a child.&nbsp; This time, unfortunately, my budget is tight, although I want to get something that would be nice.&nbsp; <br /><br />Suggestions from all of you parents out there are especially welcome.&nbsp; You can probably tell me best what to buy or to stay away from&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />Thanks in advance!

				A bunch of our friends have had babies over the last coupla years.<br /><br />What we always do is go to Toys R Us and get a HUGE box of diapers (like, a three month supply) and Toys R Us will ship it directly to them.&nbsp; <br /><br />All the new parents say it&#039;s an awesome gift :)

				Thanks. <br /><br />I thought that a gift certificate for my best friend would be a bit impersonal, but I made some pretty poor decisions in gift giving for their first child, which I don&#039;t care to repeat (who knew that babies grow really fast).

				Congrats to your friends!<br /><br />If you do decide to go the diaper route, just make sure they have decided to use regular disposable diapers.&nbsp; There are a number of alternatives out there now, and from what I&#039;ve heard from friends with babies, they are getting more and more popular.

				If they live in the city (or any city), I would definitely recommend getting the Me Too seat if they don&#039;t already have one.&nbsp; It&#039;s incredibly handy.<br /><br />This link is just for the first shop I found it listed in.&nbsp; Dunno if it&#039;s the best price or anything. http://shop.nurturecenter.com/metooporhook.html (http://shop.nurturecenter.com/metooporhook.html)<br /><br />We also love this picnic blanket that has an attached changing pad.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/JJ-Cole-Essentials-Blanket-Chocolate/dp/B0009RG8XW (http://www.amazon.com/JJ-Cole-Essentials-Blanket-Chocolate/dp/B0009RG8XW) Again, link is just to show product.

				I like to get children&#039;s books that might have the child&#039;s name in the title. If it is a unique name, it might take a little longer, but my friend had a daughter ella, and we were able to find about 10 books that had her name. As a kid, having a book that has your name feels pretty cool. In each book, I dated it and put a little message for her. It is personal, and books are something that can be held onto for a while.

				Thanks, everyone, for your great ideas!&nbsp; I really want to make the &quot;right&quot; decision.&nbsp; I think my friend and his wife appreciated my gifts, but they sort of hinted that my selections might be a little off!&nbsp;

				This is not a <em>helpful </em>comment but your friend&#039;s new baby has my birthday!&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s the best birthday to have. :2cool:<br /><br />I suggest wipes, diaper-rash cream, baby powder, stuff that they don&#039;t have left over from the first baby.&nbsp; And the personalized book idea is really cute.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				How &#039;bout a photo album or a frame? Kolo makes some really nice albums-and if they don&#039;t want it for the baby, they can use it for themselves. Lee&#039;s Stationary (Broadway/57th) Kate&#039;s Paperie and lots of other places carry Kolo.
