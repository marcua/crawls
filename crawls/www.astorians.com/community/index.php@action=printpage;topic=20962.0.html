				So I&#039;ve passed by this place a few times in the last couple weeks, and it looks like it&#039;s coming along pretty well. Here&#039;s what I know for sure (based on what I&#039;ve been told first hand)<br />It&#039;s going to be a new gastropub type of place owned by the folks who own the Blind Pig on 14th St, which is a pretty good burger / beer type of place. I rode the Blind Pig bus to a Jets game in January and wound up talking to the owner about it for a while. <br />That said, I have no idea when they&#039;re opening, but things seem to be progressing rather quickly. Just wondering if anyone has any idea of what this place will be called / when it&#039;s target opening might be. <br />I&#039;m glad to have another place to eat and drink in the neighborhood, and I&#039;m hoping that these guys do something to help it stand out from Cronin and Phelan which is like 2 doors away.

				Looking forward to a new place but I really like Cronin and Phelan.&nbsp; I hope the new place doesn&#039;t kill Cronin and Phelan....

				I don&#039;t think anything could kill Cronin. Blackstone was there for years, albeit with different names, and I don&#039;t think it ever really affected Cronin&#039;s crowd.

				Wow, that&#039;s very interesting news! I&#039;ll be curious to see what it&#039;s like when it&#039;s open. Thanks, KidMurdock.
