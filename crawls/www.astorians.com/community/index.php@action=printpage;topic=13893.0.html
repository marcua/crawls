				Hi all,<br />Can anybody recommend a good physical therapist in Astoria that<br />takes health insurance? I need to find one and would love it if I <br />didn&#039;t have to go into the city.<br />&nbsp;<br />Thanks in advance.<br />Bill&nbsp;

				I was looking for someone in Astoria, too. Ended up going to Bradley and Munson in the city because of several positive recommendations and finding the right person for the job. Depending on what body part you want worked on...because some of them can screw you up and make it worse (again, depending on the injury) Find that person first. It&#039;s a bitch and really expensive to go into the city by cab ($50 roundtrip in the worst traffic) 3 times a week, but you&#039;d probably rather get it done right then have it convenient, right? Also tried to get someone in the city to come into Astoria and everyone who was qualified to work on post-op and knee basically threw their nose in the air like Astoria was the boondocks in West Side Story and refused to come in. boooo. :x

				Hey Bill, I have a friend who lives in LIC who I believe is an excellent physical therapist. I am not sure if he takes health insurance in his private practice but I could find out. Just PM me if you want. I know he doesn&#039;t have a ton of private clients since he works full time at Columbia Presbyterian but he has a few private clients. <br /><br />I&#039;ll shoot him an email and see what he says.<br /><br /><br /><br />
