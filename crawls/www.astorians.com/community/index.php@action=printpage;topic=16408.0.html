				I recently had some thick-cut apple-smoked uncured bacon from Trader Joe&#039;s that was phenomenal, but I just don&#039;t have the patience to trek down there all the time.&nbsp; Anyone know of a place in Astoria that sells something similar?&nbsp; After having that, Oscar Meyer just isn&#039;t cutting it for me anymore....

				EuroMarket on 31st St/30th&nbsp; has double smoked bacon that they slice for you. I&#039;m addicted to it.

				I think it&#039;s 7.99/lb. But where else in Astoria are people getting their bacon? What about that meat store on Broadway in the low 40s?<br />One can never have too many bacon options.

				After reading this thread I paid a visit to EuroMarket and ordered their &quot;homemade&quot; double smoked bacon on the way to brunch at a friend&#039;s house.&nbsp; They all told me that it was the best bacon they&#039;d ever seen.&nbsp; Frying it up and eating confirmed it.&nbsp; It really was fantastic.&nbsp; What a great recommendation.&nbsp; Thanks, all.

				An update on my fancy-pants bacon quest....I haven&#039;t hit Euromarket yet, but I did get some nice slab bacon from Karl Ehmer&#039;s when I was in Ridgewood last week.&nbsp; I am going to use it to make some sort of candied/spiced bacon.&nbsp; That praline bacon that was mentioned sounds incredible.&nbsp; Yay for bacon!

				yes the praline bacon is not to be ignored. And yes, everytime I go to NOLA (about 5 times a year..) I make it a point to hit Elizabeths for the bacon and the strawberry cream cheese french toast. My whole family is there, and I would be too if it werent for the fact I would certainly weigh 400lbs if I lived there. <br /><br />If you try to make that bacon, I will be expecting a PM on it.
