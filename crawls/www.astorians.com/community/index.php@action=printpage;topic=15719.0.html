				Hello everyone.<br /><br />We are sooooooo excited that in just 16 short days, we&#039;ll take the drive up from Miami to Astoria........well, the cars are sold and the boxes are starting to get packed.&nbsp; We have a wonderful two bedroom apartment waiting for us just a block from Astoria Park and can&#039;t wait.<br /><br />Any advise from you long time Astorians?&nbsp; Anything that you wish someone would have told you before you moved to NY or to Astoria that may have made your life easier?&nbsp; I would really appreciate any helpful info since I&#039;ve lived in Miami my whole life and never not had a car.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Take full advantage of not just the subways, but the buses as well. And don&#039;t be ashamed of using a granny cart if you want to be able to transport more than a couple bags of groceries at a time from the store. Other than that, you&#039;ll probably have questions when you get here. Take time to explore the area.<br /><br />Good luck!

				First off, you do not need a car in Astoria, or most of NYC for that matter. Most stores and things are convenient and you can get to anyplace you want either by walking, or taking the train or bus. I was born and raised here, and I never owned a car in my life, and I don&#039;t need one. Astoria Park is a very nice place to take a walk, picnic or pass the time, you&#039;re lucky to be near it. Lot&#039;s of places to eat and shop. Manhattan is a short trip away by train, and there are waaaaaaaay too many things to do and see there to even begin listing them. Take advantage of the proximity and take in the city. Things to think of doing: Music, art, shows, sports, landmarks, parks, etc.<br /><br />Welcome to Astoria! &nbsp;:mrgreen:

				DO call 911 about drag racing motorcycles; DON&#039;T race your motorcycle up-and-down all night long.<br /><br />Don&#039;t go to Bistro 33 on an empty stomach and a budget.<br /><br />Don&#039;t be surprised if a cab driver gives you a hard time about going to Queens from NYC. If they do, don&#039;t hesitate to take his license # and report him.<br /><br />Don&#039;t be surprised if you see women dressed all in black the week before Easter. That&#039;s Greek Orthodox Easter.<br /><br />Don&#039;t forget to inquire about the fireworks in the park the week before July 4th, and do get a good spot to watch them.<br /><br /><br />

				Thanks for all the fabulous advise!<br /><br />15 more days and I still can&#039;t wait. <br /><br />BTW Rob, we have no choice but to move to NY. (house is sold, cars are sold, replacement is trained at my job)&nbsp; <br /><br />My husband is attending NYU, so we are gladly and greatfully moving to NY for atleast the next 4 years!<br /><br />I&#039;m going with an open mind and I appreciate everyone&#039;s tips.&nbsp; The one about the granny cart and the bus is a good one!&nbsp; I would have never guesssed that. We registered for a zip car so I&#039;ll keep that in mind when I need to make big purchases at the groceries or Costco.<br />

				When the weather starts getting cold, you will have to learn how to dress in layers properly. You will need a whole winter wardrobe, and you WILL be cold this first winter, your body has no experience with real winter weather. This first winter will probably be the most difficult obstacle to overcome in moving here. Everything else you can get help with, shopping, traveling in the city, etc., but the cold you will just have to deal with. :-(

				Oh yes, you will want rain boots. Took me a few years to finally get those and now I don&#039;t know how I lived without them. I like the ones I got because I can use them in rain or snow, because they&#039;re lined, but they&#039;re not all wintry looking.

				I&#039;m a newbie to Astoria, but I&#039;ll offer my impressions/feelings so far.<br /><br />We moved here on July 1st, and although it&#039;s only been a month, I really love the area.&nbsp; DO enjoy Astoria Park as much as possible.&nbsp; The view of Manhattan from the Park is great.&nbsp; There&#039;s a track for running laps, basketball, pool, and plenty of open space for picnics, sun-bathing, relaxing, etc.<br /><br />Also, if you&#039;re use to shopping a big department stores or chain supermarkets... then you should get use to a more local approach.&nbsp; The local markets here seem to have some much more varied choices in items and mostly cheaper prices when comparing them to the big chains.&nbsp; Especially if you like fruits and veggies... the local produce stands are usually very good quality at a much cheaper price.&nbsp; There are plenty of &quot;ethnic&quot; markets too, that carry a variety of foods/items from parts of the world that are fun to tryout.&nbsp; Of course, you can always shop in Manhattan, but sometimes spotting a hard-to-find or special item on the backwall of a local shop is much more exciting.

				Astoria&#039;s a great place to live, don&#039;t get me wrong (I was kinda joking).&nbsp; If start missing the beach, though, Long Island rocks (Jones Beach, Fire Island, the Hamptons, etc etc.).&nbsp; New Jersey beaches are very good too&nbsp; :-)

				WELCOME TO ASTORIA! :-D<br />My boyfriend and I moved from Florida too (Tampa) last July and we LOVE it here! We moved for my internship so we were in the same boat- we had to go. The locals really are quite nice for the most part.&nbsp; The eats are also excellent and it a safe place to live (again for the most part).&nbsp; <br />Generally:<br />-I agree with the granny cart, for sure!<br />-A costco membership will likely end up saving you money if you can get to the location in Long Island City.<br />-Also right next to Costco is the Socrates Sculpture Park, where they have free outdoor movies in the summer.&nbsp; That&#039;s a blast.<br />Websites:<br />-You might try going to Whyleaveastoria.org for local events and to get a perks card. This website is a great asset as well.&nbsp; I&#039;ve learned so much from it and have gotten excellent recommendations on where to live, what to eat, who&#039;s/what&#039;s recommended as far as services in the area.&nbsp; Also, Yelp.com is also good.<br />Shopping:<br />-Ditmars Ave is a cozy place to walk and shop.&nbsp; They have independent businesses mixed in with some of the bigger ones.&nbsp; <br />-If you are itching for a “real” mall, Queens Center Mall is in Elmhurst, it&#039;s excellent. <br />Winters:<br />-Get a winter coat, like a real-deal winter coat…preferably goose-down (Northface has some excellent options, trust me it’s worth every penny.) Also, get warm gloves, a hat and a scarf.&nbsp; I also agree that snow/rainboots are a necessity.&nbsp; <br />Florida vs. NY:<br />-The two are very hard to compare.&nbsp; In some ways, I imagine that Miami is similar in that it is made of up of many different cultures/languages…but NYC is like, 12 X as diverse!&nbsp; So take advantage of that (i.e.: learn about and eat food from different cultures!)&nbsp; The atmosphere is also obviously different – I remember coming here and thinking – it’s so hilly! Florida is so flat!&nbsp; Space is also at a premium, especially in Manhattan, so don’t be overwhelmed by the incredible amount of people and tall buldings.&nbsp; <br /><br />I wish you guys the very best!&nbsp; Best of luck with the move.&nbsp; Hopefully you will enjoys being “Astoria Transplants.”<br />&nbsp;:mrgreen:
