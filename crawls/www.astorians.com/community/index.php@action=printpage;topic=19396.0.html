				What are people thinking about the November elections?<br /><br />What races are getting you interested?&nbsp; The Gubernatorial race?&nbsp; (Cuomo, Palladino, Lazio, Barron, Redlich, Davis, Hawkins, Cohn - that could be a wild debate depending on who they invite).<br /><br />US Senate - the seat held by Chuck Schumer (6 year term) (Schumer, Townsend)<br /><br />US Senate - the seat held by Kirsten Gillibrand (last 2 years of Hillary Clinton&#039;s 6 year term) (Gillibrand, DioGuardi)<br /><br />Attorney General (Schneiderman, Donovan)<br /><br />Comptroller (DiNapoli, Wilson)<br /><br />Commercials are already starting up - I hope some of them come through Astoria to campaign.<br /><br />

				I will be shocked if the US Senate changes party control.<br />Locally, I expect Nov will bring us the expected faces. Maybe there could be a few surprises at the statewide level.<br /><br />Natl one imaginary prediction is that the House could go from a 257 Dem majority to a 207 Dem minority.&nbsp; :-o !!&nbsp; That would be incredible.<br />Be careful what you wish for. Trying to see what would be meaningful changes.<br />I expect any &#039;energy policy&#039; would be drastic swing. I think immigration reform would be a tough debate.<br /><br />The GOP pocket pledge seems rather familiar and they need to answer why they did not enact it 10 years ago.<br />Will believe Change when actions can be verified. I think even Dems could enact nearly 50% of the pledge if they wanted.<br /><br />Any Democrats planning to vote in Nov?

				just moved here. I am trying to figure out who are local representatives are. I ran into Michael Gianares at a local street fair last week. I think he was running for senate (state) i think he said he is a rep now but going for this new place. What do people think of him? I liked him, he actually talked to me about the problems in albany.&nbsp; I also forgot to write that he did some truck thing in the paper today which i liked

				Depending on where you live in Astoria you&#039;d have the following representatives:<br /><br />Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney (being opposed by Ryan Brumberg)<br />NYS Senator George Onorato (Assemblymember Michael Gianaris is seeking his seat, and I think he has a Republican opponent, but Mike is the favorite in the race)<br />NYS Assemblymember Michael Gianaris (Democratic candidate is Aravella Simotas, not sure if the Republicans have a candidate) - Northern Astoria, mainly North of 30th Avenue<br />NYS Assemblymember Marge Markey (South of Broadway and parts between 30th Avenue and Broadway in the mid 30s Streets).<br />NYS Assemblymember Cathy Nolan (East of Crescent predominately, along the river up to Astoria Houses)<br />NYC Councilmember Peter Vallone, Jr. (most of Astoria)<br />NYC Councilmember Jimmy Van Bramer (South of 34th Avenue)

				Welcome CA.<br />McD can clue you in on many things and you might want to check out the Dem clubs.<br /><br /><br />The Assembly race is an open seat this election, considered filled.<br />Most officials here are Dem and win by wide margins. As to whether folks actually like them ...<br />I imagine Gianaris is well respected for a number of reasons.<br /><br /><br />One question for NYS is will there be any change of leader in the state senate?&nbsp; I hope yes.<br />[If I were to vote Dem this year, Gianaris would likely be the one vote.]

				Thanks TRX.&nbsp; I love trying to stay involved and I would love to get active. Astorias representatives are getting younger which is exciting. Gianaris (i spelled it right!) and this simotas woman and I think Vallone is young too. Should i stop by their offices, or is that frowned upon? I would love to offer to volunteer.

				Taminent is very similar to Powhatan - they&#039;re both regular Democratic clubs (meaning affiliated with the Queens Democratic County Organization and have District Leaders affiliated with the club).&nbsp; All three campaigns were based out of Taminent this year (our water was broken for a few months, so we didn&#039;t host anyone lamentably).&nbsp; They&#039;re great folks.

				Just curious, but for the 2008 elections someone posted a candidate finder site that had links to all the candidates and a fairly basic rundown of their stance on most / all of the main electorate talking points.&nbsp; I was wondering if such a think existed for this go-round. I don&#039;t want to just blindly vote for Kristen Davis, because she would try to make it easier for me to walk to the bodega for 1/8 of sticky icky, but I&#039;d also like to know where she stands on broader statewide issues. If anyone has such a resource, I would wholeheartedly appreciate it.

To be seen if this makes any difference.<br />A stronger resolution failed but with meaningful minority support from both parties.<br />&nbsp;<br />Perhaps out of respect for the Commander in Chief and the military concerns in Libya, Rep.
