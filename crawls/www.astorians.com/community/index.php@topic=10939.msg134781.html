								<div class="inner" id="msg_134705">Jennifer --<br />Thanks for that post it. I don‘t think I discounted the social aspect of this site, but I perhaps did not fully appreciate the social networking function astorians.com plays and how some people have integrated it into their everyday lives. If you feel I didn’t get what this brouhaha was all about I’m sorry. I did I think, to a certain extent, but not in the way you stated. I thought people might connect here and then move offline, making the site less important in maintaining the connection. I now see it differently.<br /><br /><br />Adam --<br />You’re point of view on internet forms philosophically differs from mine in that, correct me if I’m wrong, you believe in little to no moderation, editing or intervention. I see value in moderation or the role of an editor, so we’ll have to respectively disagree.<br /><br />I have consistently maintained the opinion that if a person is unhappy with the policies of this website they are more than free to start one of their own.<br /><br />You did that and I sincerely applaud you for doing so. I think you’re nuts for doing so by the way but I think merm is certifiable as well so you’re in good company. <br /><br /><br />In another post you stated that “truth and facts matter no less on the internet than in the real world”<br /><br />I agree 100% but the questions that follows in my mind is who’s truth? Who’s facts? Who’s interpretation?<br /><br />And now you explain away viciousness and threats of violence published on your website as “righteous” anger. I’m sorry because I know this is judgmental but that thought scares the bejesus out of me. My only response to it is beware the righteous and their anger. <br /><br />Do you think it’s more obscene, as you say, to suspend someone from a website than it is to threaten to punch him out for doing so? Cries of denials of human rights and threats of lawsuits -- It’s been fully acknowledged and even I can see that mistakes were and some people were treated unfairly in this situation but this is proportional response? Please, if my perspective is skewed please let me know in what way.<br /><br />I do see two sides in this conflict, but the outrageous responses from some people lessens my understanding and respect for their position. I don’t like when a group gets together and piles on and beats down on one person, regardless if that person was in the wrong. It’s bullying mob behavior and I don’t like it. <br /><br /><br />To my knowledge I wasn’t trying to categorize Adam&#039;s website, I was merely pointing to one of the most popular topics, merm and astorians.com, which generated 112 comments over 14 pages with 1000+ views, and noting that many were extremely negative, very personal and nasty -- is this not true? Is this not a fact? It was beyond criticism.<br /><br />Regretfully, if that’s the type of discourse and sense of community adam&#039;s site attracts I’ll have to take a pass and if you consider me unfair or judgmental for doing so I’m sorry.<br /><br />To all: If what happen on astorians.com was so injurous to such a significant part of the users where was the spirit of that community, of its people coming together as a group in an attempt to right a wrong? where was the thoughful dissension? the organization to enact change?<br /><br />All I saw was the mob on the rampage: f___ him! Let&#039;s get him! Let&#039;s punch him out! Let&#039;s sue! I&#039;m sorry if that the definition of free speech in the Astoria town square, I am moving out.<br /><br />In all this controversy I’ve noticed that the only one who has acknowledged mistakes have been made, comments misinterpreted and feelings hurt and that person is: Merm.<br /><br />As soon as the anger dies down I hope the people who made, let’s say, unkind statements, come around and realize the part they played in all of this an apologize for it.</div>

Wavings of fists, declarations of &#039;independence&#039;, etc, etc.<br /><br />I find it all rather tiresome. It&#039;s the &#039;net, folks. It&#039;s not hard to start a board of your own.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am feeling some déjà vu as well... In a past life I was an avid member of a web community which ran the same course this board seems to be running. &nbsp;First we were all friends, then cliques formed, then there was admin vs rebels wars of sorts, then traffic slowed so dramatically that it closed. &nbsp;All in the span of 4 years, so I guess timing is also similar.<br /><br />I find it interesting that regardless of the population (my former web-community was a hispanic literary forum) and the medium (in person, online) people always seem to engage in power struggles. &nbsp;It&#039;s a sad commentary in human nature, but it&#039;s all over history and the Net doesn&#039;t seem to be exempt.<br /><br />As it&#039;s obvious from my very small post count, I decided long ago not to participate actively in this type of community because I have enough drama in my &quot;in person&quot; life, as I suspect most people do, and all this fighting is exhausting (though entertaining - reading this I feel like I&#039;m watching &quot;The Real World - Astoria&quot; :-D ). &nbsp;However, Astorians is a great source of information for us &quot;lurkers&quot;, so I hope issues can be resolved. &nbsp;</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_134730">Background and disclaimers:&nbsp; I am a long time Astorians user, approaching three years now.&nbsp; I have seen the board grow and change a lot in that time.&nbsp; I consider merm and wasabisam (and mcdirk) to be my friends.&nbsp; I have met many people here, and with some I enjoy friendship.&nbsp; I am a supporter of the board and have raised money for the board.&nbsp; I was a moderator here for a time.&nbsp; I have organized events and met lots of Astorians as a result. I am a blogger for Joey In Astoria as a result of meeting the original Joey on this board.&nbsp; I became one of the Hellgate CSA Core Group members as a result of my interactions on this board. It has been a great overall community resource and experience for me.&nbsp; In other words, I feel a lot of warmth for the Astorians community.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s important to understand that people use this board in a variety of ways.&nbsp; To say one way is more worthy than another is not very community minded and is condescending.&nbsp; To talk about the anonymous and perhaps &quot;single digit&quot; posters with negative tones... weren&#039;t we all once single digit posters?&nbsp; Weren&#039;t we all anonymous once before?&nbsp; We all were non-supporters at one point, too.&nbsp; To divide the community like that is just not right.<br /><br />A brief note about the Astorians-related discussions on Astorialogues:&nbsp; They were appalling - the attacks were vicious and way over the top.&nbsp; merm is gracious to listen here to those that partook in that discussion, and to consider their POV, after all that.&nbsp; Banning sucks, yes, I agree.&nbsp; But the response by some seemed just too heartless and cruel.<br /><br />I hope that a resolution for the differences can be found.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad the open discussion on the rules is in full swing, and hope that through discussion and discourse we can find something that will work for the benefit of the community at large.</div>

I see value in moderation or the role of an editor, so we’ll have to respectively disagree.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I accept your invitation to correct you. First of all, it&#039;s &quot;<strong>Your</strong> point of view, and I think you mean &quot;<strong>respectfully</strong> disagree.&quot; :mrgreen: <br /><br />I see a tremendous role for moderation. I made a sincere pitch for moderation back in February&#039;s Politics to be Discontinued thread. My response to having my site censored was a moderate, principled plea to merm. I agree with Paine that moderation in temper is a virtue, but moderation in principle is a vice. <br /><br />To my way of thinking, and this is backed up by my overall life experiences (including this most recent hubbub), there is an inherent contradiction in placing so great a value on the appearance of any virtue that one engages in all manner of abhorrent behavior to foster it. You can&#039;t get to decency via vice. Not only does a moderate end not justify suspensions and editing and censoring, a moderate end is impossible when such techniques are employed. <br /><br />To quote the Bible, <br /><br /><em> He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart. </em><br /><br />I believe wholeheartedly that the only moderation truly worth anything is the moderation that results from free and open communication. I call this voluntary moderation, people sorting out their differences as adults. <br /><br />People will always say emotionally intense things, some things that they wish they could take back. And I believe that, in most cases, they should not be interfered with or edited or suspended or censored before they have a chance to experience the effects of such actions. This is how we learn and grow.&nbsp; Freedom and responsibility promote growth; self-censoring and expecting external interventions infantilize (eg, people refer to themselves as being in the naughty corner, they plead with the moderators to let them back in, and the &quot;nods&quot;... :?). The feedback loop works when people are not prevented from experiencing it. Establish rules that remind people that they are free to express themselves and responsible for the content of what they say, they will become better communicators, achieve empathy with those who hurt them or whom they offend, and they will mature, and their relationships will be deeper, truer.&nbsp; <br /><br />Does this work perfectly every time? Of course not. But perfection isn&#039;t the point. Respecting people&#039;s rights as adults to learn from the effects of their choices is a modus operandi I can live with. You see a vicious tantrum, I see a genuine crisis that is a moment along a continuum, one that can only balance itself out in a meaningful way if its participants are left free to communicate and held responsible for what they say by each other. <br /><br />I told merm in February that he was chasing a degree of control that was neither desirable nor feasible, and I stand by that.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=10939.msg134705.html#msg134705">Quote from: 28Grand on June 19, 2008, 03:19:47 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In another post you stated that “truth and facts matter no less on the internet than in the real world”<br /><br />I agree 100% but the questions that follows in my mind is who’s truth?

I think it&#039;s a little bit nasty to try and cast doubt without backing it up with concrete references. You&#039;re both welcome to make specific challenges to my presentations of facts, and if you find a mistake, that will be that. I&#039;m confident that I got my facts right, but there&#039;s a clear record of merm&#039;s and my posts available to anyone for their review.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=10939.msg134705.html#msg134705">Quote from: 28Grand on June 19, 2008, 03:19:47 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I do see two sides in this conflict, but the outrageous responses from some people lessens my understanding and respect for their position.

I&#039;d only ask that you remember that the topic came into existence as a direct response to merm&#039;s moderating choices on Astorians, not as some out of the blue attack by Astorialogues members.

I&#039;ll try my best to persuade you that such interventions are counterproductive.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.&nbsp; You clearly have firm views on the topics of moderation, free speech and what is or isn&#039;t censorship.&nbsp; I&#039;m not here to try to change your views.&nbsp; It seems to me that the type of online community that people want to participate in boils down to a matter of individual choice. <br /><br />It&#039;s my hope that people can respectfully disagree with one another.&nbsp; I favor a forum with moderation.&nbsp; I&#039;m not opposed to what you call &quot;voluntary moderation&quot;, I just don&#039;t find it particularly effective when people lose their cool.&nbsp; I just have a preference for civility and would much rather be engaged in a civil discourse with someone than one that gets reduced to namecalling or an attack of ones view in a matter that is lacking any substance such as &quot;that idea is just plain dumb&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know all about the real world.&nbsp; I know all about emotions and how emotional some people can get.&nbsp; You suggest that one should &quot;Establish rules that remind people that they are free to express themselves and responsible for the content of what they say, they will become better communicators, achieve empathy with those who hurt them or whom they offend, and they will mature, and their relationships will be deeper, truer.&quot;&nbsp; On Astorians, I want to grow and learn from a civil, spirited exchange of views and ideas.&nbsp; I don&#039;t need to perfect my skills on how to defend myself from the anonymous bully in the playground via an online forum.&nbsp; Yes, I can fend for myself without having a mod step in but that&#039;s not the point.&nbsp; My days are difficult as it is, I don&#039;t want to have to participate in or deal with an online community that permits discussions to deteriorate to name calling or the expression of threatening and hostile conduct.&nbsp; It no longer becomes a discussion at that point and I don&#039;t want to be a part of that negativity no matter how human it is.&nbsp; I also don&#039;t believe it makes me a better communicator or more empathetic to participate in that sort of exchange but if it did, I would chose to learn those things in another manner.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Clearly we don&#039;t all share the same opinion on what this forum should be like.&nbsp; That is the beauty of being able to choose which online forum(s) one wants to participate in.&nbsp; It is also a beautifull and encouraging thing to have a forum listen to it&#039;s members and be willing to grow and evolve into something better than it was.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_134787">Mac, I don’t always agree with you but it pisses me off to see people have decided to “communicate” with their neg nods on this thread.&nbsp; <br /><br />merm, I honestly think the nods are the most offensive thing about the site.&nbsp; Far more offensive than people SHOUTING or cursing or being sarcastic or downright bitchy. Negative Nodding communicates contempt in my opinion.&nbsp; And as far as positive nods go, well big whoop.&nbsp; So someone agrees or likes what was said.&nbsp; &nbsp;Let them post back or say nothing rather than THUMBS UP and THUMBS DOWN.&nbsp; What is this? The Roman Coliseum!&nbsp; It is so offensive and, literally, meaningless.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, Mac, merm has done an amazing job with the creation and maintenance of this site.&nbsp; Before I moved to Jackson Heights, I lived in Astoria.&nbsp; I work a lot at Kaufman Astoria.&nbsp; I belonged to 2 gyms in Astoria, eat there as much as here and basically still feel very connected to it so I love this site for helping me stay in touch with a place I lived in, still spend time in and now live next door to.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I have no idea what you mean by “But apparently membership in this club is supporting the non-donating member, ass-kissing flocks of sheep that will maintain the status quo regardless of the consequences.”&nbsp; &nbsp;But that is an offensive comment. If it&#039;s not, I&#039;d love it explained.<br /><br />You are at times witty and warm and outrageous and rude. (Sometimes all at once which is an achievement, I admit.)&nbsp; &nbsp;But the point I’m making is you love to push people’s buttons.&nbsp; &nbsp;Why should you, or anyone, be allowed free reign to act out and say whatever you choose?&nbsp; Just because this site has grown from it’s inception does that mean people should be allowed to act or express themselves anyway they want to?&nbsp; Because the site is an online Town Square?&nbsp; I am confused by that.&nbsp; Please don’t read what I just wrote as contempt.&nbsp; It is honest confusion. And if that freedom to say whatever you want is paramount to your enjoyment of a site, then why can’t it be expressed on astorialogues where it’s accepted and applauded?&nbsp; Why can’t two sites with different attitudes co-exist?&nbsp; It seems to me that the people who are supporting astorialogues want to make this site over to a mirror image.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Mac,&nbsp; I completely agree with you on this: the rules are not written out to explain punishment or retribution and they should be.&nbsp; The rules should clearly state the progression of warnings and/or suspensions.&nbsp; And they don’t.&nbsp; If I were suspended for something, I’d want to know why but more importantly, I’d want a warning before a suspension.&nbsp; If that is not what is happening now, then I think it should change.&nbsp; And I’m guessing that it will change based on what merm has said.&nbsp; The other thing I agree with is that this site has changed from its inception but I don’t agree that that means it is now the domain of the members.&nbsp; I understand how much this site means to the members; especially the ones who fully use it to meet up and share experiences. But it’s not public domain.&nbsp; If I’m wrong about that, I’m sure someone will correct me. <br /><br />And as far as people governing themselves, Adamwc, I have yet to see it happening well anywhere.&nbsp; Your site is too new to say how well that theory will work. But it’s great that you started a site to put your beliefs into action. I don’t like your site and yes it’s based on one very nasty, mean spirited thread.&nbsp; Sometimes first impressions are all we get. Did it make me want to read further? No it did not.&nbsp; Does that mean I don’t think your site should exist or I want it to fail. Again, no it does not.&nbsp; It just means we all see things differently or want different things out of our online community.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_135660">FIRST.&nbsp; I would like to thank Merm for ending my suspension early.(thank you Merm)<br />SECOND . I WOULD LIKE TO PERSONALY APPOLOGIZE TO MERM FOR ANYTHING I SAID ON THE OTHER BOARD THAT HE OR ANYONE ELSE HERE WOULD FIND OFFENSIVE (Merm i do apologize)<br />Now to get down with the business at hand <br />#1&nbsp; the nods....i personally enjoy the nods....while there are people who will neg nod specific posters for saying the sky is blue and there are those who neg nod me no matter what is said.i will admit to neg nodding one particular poster whom i have had a previous words with but that&#039;s just because he/she takes it so badly (PS. i take my neg nods as a badge of honor)<br />#2 suspensions/ banishment ...while i do think that this is Merm&#039;s board and he can do with it as he pleases i do hope he reconsiders the banishment part ( since my next suspension will be a permanent ban,i do hope he does it quickly )<br />#3 the politics board ... it seems to me that this is where most of the disagreements come from.politics is a subject that seems to bring out passionate responces from those on both sides .while i have always considered myself a Conservative independent i at times feel like a far right republican on this board and that&#039;s OK , but there should be a amount of civility afforded those with minority views. my suggestions would be ..(a) a disclaimer stating the above with no moderation <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (b) when thing get heated up,ask them to &quot;step outside&quot;and go to the astorialouges board.<br />#4 trolling ...i think that trolling is in the eye of the beholder, people have accused a certain poster of trolling ... i disagree&nbsp; he is in my opinion a true beleiver in what he feels, just because you may not agree with his posts ,i feel he is trying to make his point and he is steadfast in his belief ,more power to him<br /><br /><br /><br />well i think this is all for now . so before i am banned ( it is just a matter of time) i would like to send some love to all who use this board and wish you all the best of luck <br /><br />odenhal out<br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_136112">i&#039;ve been thinking on this whole thing and i think this medium caters to misunderstandings.&nbsp; when you write something (as opposed to a face-to-face) things are more easily misconstrued.&nbsp; at my last job that was one of the main comments made to me from my superiors.&nbsp; they thought my emails were a bit abrupt at times, and although they knew it wasn&#039;t meant in any negative way, they warned me to constantly edit myself so that there aren&#039;t any misunderstandings.&nbsp; a simple sentence can be read a lot of different ways, depending on the &quot;voice&quot; or &quot;tone&quot; that one puts on it.<br /><br />astorians.com is pretty informative, and i think that&#039;s the main reason i check in so often.&nbsp; on that note, i think it serves it&#039;s purpose.&nbsp; on the otherhand, i think when it comes to the issues that are debatable, these recent events have hindered the forum...especially more recently.<br /><br />since reading all of these recent comments about the rules and regulations, i find that i&#039;m more tentative in the postings that i make, and i&#039;m not so sure that&#039;s a good thing.&nbsp; it almost defeats the purpose of some of these threads.&nbsp; it&#039;s one thing to be blatantly disrespectful or insulting toward others, but it&#039;s another to be passionate about one&#039;s (differing) opinion.&nbsp; i can understand how the former wouldn&#039;t be tolerated, but the latter?<br /><br />i&#039;ll be the first to say that i don&#039;t know all the facts that started this line, but it just seems that a lot has been made of some comments made on a forum where there should be a lot A LOT of room for expression.&nbsp; i think it&#039;s an almost impossible task for the moderators to be accurate all of the time, as what&#039;s insulting to one person, may not be insulting to another.&nbsp; instead of having the moderators making these decisions, it should be more dependent on the the community reporting/commenting what they deem offense.&nbsp; then in those grey areas, the moderators can be the final word.&nbsp; i think when it&#039;s left up to the people, things eventually sort themselves out.&nbsp; and i also think this is far more effective than the &quot;nod&quot; system, which i&#039;m not convinced works at all, really.</div>
