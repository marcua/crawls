				We&#039;re having friends visit this weekend, and we want to take them out to dinner on Saturday night.&nbsp; Of course, we didn&#039;t realize until yesterday that Saturday night is Valentine&#039;s Day.&nbsp; Any ideas where we can take a group of 8-10 people, not too expensive?&nbsp; Maybe someplace that takes reservations, but isn&#039;t super-romantic, so it wouldn&#039;t be booked.&nbsp; This is probably a lost cause, but just in case anyone has an idea, I thought I would throw it out there.&nbsp; Thanks!

				I don&#039;t know what kind of cuisine you are looking for but Jour et Nuit (Moroccan food) came to mind.&nbsp; They are on Steinway Street off 28th ave.&nbsp; <br /><br />You might also want to try some of the larger restaurants.&nbsp; They may have more available.&nbsp; Philoxenia (Greek), Punta Dura (Italian).<br /><br />Oceanos on Broadway is relatively new and never seems to be busy.&nbsp; We&#039;ve been looking for a Guinea Pig if you wanted to check them out and report back&nbsp; :-)

				On Valentine&#039;s day it may be tough even outside Manhattan!&nbsp; Try Philoxenia on 34 Avenue.

				Bartolino&#039;s on Broadway has a lot of space, though it&#039;s a bit pricier than other spots along Broadway.&nbsp; I agree with AJTNYC that Ocean is never crowded and could probably accommodate you.&nbsp; What about Cavo?&nbsp; It&#039;s massive!

				We actually live close to Porto Bello, but the one time we ate there, we had a truly terrible white pizza.&nbsp; Is the other food better?&nbsp; Since it&#039;s so close by, it&#039;s very convenient, and I can&#039;t imagine it would be that crowded on Valentine&#039;s Day.

				Uncle George&#039;s is the way to go -- they have huge tables, and I&#039;ve rarely ever had to wait there, even on New Year&#039;s Eve once!&nbsp; It&#039;s on Broadway and 34th Street.
