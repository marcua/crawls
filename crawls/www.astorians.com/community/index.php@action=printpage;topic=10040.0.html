				I was wondering if anyone else has had issues with downloading the latest Microsoft update.&nbsp; Service Pack 3, which is supposedly faster and contains necessary security enhancements for XP users, will not install on my computer.&nbsp; It starts to install, but then I get this annoying error message that asks me to &quot;debug&quot; and when I start the process, I get another error message that reads the debugging has been disabled, or something to that effect.<br /><br />I&#039;m not the only one who has experienced this problem because when I tried to get help on the Internet, there&#039;s a lot of similar complaints.&nbsp; However, my brain becomes mush after reading most of the discussion threads because I&#039;m barely literate in computer language and the Microsoft support site is meant to confuse and anger people!<br /><br />By the way, has anyone else noticed that the Microsoft Office icons turn into generic program icons on the last ITunes update?&nbsp; The applications still work, it&#039;s really just the icons.<br /><br />I hope I provided enough information.&nbsp; I&#039;m not really all that computer savy as you can probably tell.&nbsp; Thanks in advance.

				i&#039;m not sure what&#039;s going on.<br /><br />WinXP SP3 isn&#039;t officially released yet. so either you are trying to install an early release release candidate (unlikely) or something completely different, pretending to be SP3 (bad!). at this point, you need to go out of your way and do specific things to get the update. if you are just running Windows Update, it shouldn&#039;t be listed/available yet.<br /><br />another possibility is you are trying to install SP3 for whichever version of MS Office you are running.<br /><br />http://www.downloadsquad.com/2008/03/25/microsoft-release-yet-another-windows-xp-sp3-rc-build/<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">A few weeks ago we could have sworn that Microsoft was getting ready to release the final build of Windows XP SP3 by the end of March. But today Microsoft released Windows XP SP3 RC2 refresh, which basically means it&#039;s a slightly modified version of the release candidate made available in February.<br /><br />There aren&#039;t really many new features or surprises in the latest build. The refresh basically has a different build number, includes all previous updates, and includes support for HD audio and fixes some Windows Update issues. But today&#039;s release does indicate that Microsoft is still tinkering, which leads us to believe it&#039;ll probably be at least a few more days, weeks, or months until the final version of Windows XP SP3 is released.<br /><br />In order to download the 120MB service pack from Windows Update, you need to add a registry key by do</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Thanks, Murph,<br /><br />Now I feel kind of stupid.<br /><br />And by the way, it is also trying to install an update for Microsoft .Net Framework and that isn&#039;t going through either.<br /><br />More whining from me, but I&#039;ve been getting &quot;Windows Explorer have performed an error&quot; shortly after start-up several times.&nbsp; The computer won&#039;t shut down, completely, but will rather clear the screen of the icons and taskbar and then come back up seconds later.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would get a new computer, but I can&#039;t afford one right now.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ll fill in for a message, since murph seems to be elsewhere.<br /><br />The Download size: 0 indicates that there are no additional things for Windows Update to download before it begins the installation. Windows Update has an option to download updates automatically, then present them for you to install.&nbsp; Or perhaps these updates were downloaded when you tried to install them before, and it had determined that it won&#039;t download them again.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t tried to install either of these yet - I don&#039;t use my Windows machine at home for much but the cat-cam and doing taxes. The fact that both updates fail hints that the problem is not with the updates themselves.<br /><br />Windows Explorer crashes are a pain in the neck. Window Explorer is the thing that manages directory, er excuse me, <em>folder</em> windows, and also manages all the icons on the &quot;desktop&quot;, the desktop toolbars, and the &quot;Start&quot; button. That&#039;s why they all disappear when it crashes. It is so central to Windows operation that Windows starts a new copy if it fails, which is why everything reappears a little while later.<br /><br />Third-party programs often use a feature that lets them hook into Explorer, to present their features as if they were part of the file system. These include cd/dvd burners, digital cameras, video cams, music management software programs like iTunes, etc.&nbsp; Some virus and spy-ware programs use this feature too.&nbsp; You may have a broken or failed installation of one of these things that is crashing Explorer.<br /><br />If it were mine, I would check the event-viewer for clues of things that are logging messages as they fail.&nbsp; Then I would &quot;uninstall&quot; (via the control-panel &quot;add and remove&quot; feature) any software installed just before the explorer problem appeared, and also run an anti-virus program &quot;full-scan&quot; of the machine. Beyond that, finding the root of such problems involves (1) checking web sites for the stuff that&#039;s installed to find admissions of guilt, and (2) finding a nerdy kid to do technical detective work, and (3) having good luck.<br />

				sorry...help desk had errands to run all day yesterday ;)<br /><br />anyways...i&#039;ve seen the .NET Serice Packs fail to install from Windows Update often. i find that a manual install usually works. here is the link to the manual download.<br />http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=6978d761-4a92-4106-a9bc-83e78d4abc5b&amp;displaylang=en<br /><br />might as well try a manual install for Office SP3 too. link here<br />http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=85af7bfd-6f69-4289-8bd1-eb966bcdfb5e&amp;displaylang=en<br /><br />if they both install OK, reboot and run Windows Update again. i can almost guarantee you Office will need security updates after the service pack.<br />

				Hey murph-&nbsp; if you&#039;re like this guy&nbsp; &nbsp;http://dailyapps.net/2007/11/hack-attack-get-windows-xp-sp3-through-windows-update/ (http://dailyapps.net/2007/11/hack-attack-get-windows-xp-sp3-through-windows-update/)&nbsp; and can&#039;t actually wait for SP3, then try it out. I couldn&#039;t try it today since I am on one of my macs presently. But I may try it later this week, although after what SP2 beta did to my machine.... I&#039;m not sure I&#039;m ready to take the plunge...yet.
