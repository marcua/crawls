				STATEMENT OF CONGRESSWOMAN CAROLYN B. MALONEY<br />On the Vote on Marriage Equality by the New York State Legislature<br />December 2, 2009<br />&nbsp;<br />I salute Governor Paterson, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, and State Senate Democratic Conference Leader John Sampson for bringing marriage equality legislation to a vote in both houses of the State Legislature.&nbsp; I share the bitter disappointment of millions that the Senate failed to pass this critical civil rights measure, and I join with them to say: we will be back!<br />&nbsp;<br />The right of consenting adults to marry their loved ones is inherent in the ideal of “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness” upon which our great nation was founded.&nbsp; Anything less than full marriage equality for same-sex couples constitutes separate and unequal treatment.&nbsp; We will not rest until New York joins the ranks of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont and New Hampshire in achieving justice and equality for same-sex couples. And until anything less than full marriage equality is achieved in the Empire State: we will be back!<br />&nbsp;<br />As the author of the very first legislation in New York State history to recognize the rights of same-sex couples, I’ve learned the hard way that progress is often achieved in fits and starts, and that determination and effort over the long haul are required to effect real change.&nbsp; Twenty-three years later, I am still proud to stand up for all families in our society, and to stand with allies in and out of government to make marriage equality a reality in New York State.<br />&nbsp;<br />We will be back!<br /><br /><br />----<br /><br />Kudos to Carolyn Maloney and Assemblymember Michael Gianaris (who voted for marriage equality THREE times - they make us proud!
