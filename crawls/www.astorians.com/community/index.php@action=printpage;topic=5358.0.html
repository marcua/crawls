				Mine expired in October 2006 and I&#039;m curious if NYS/NYC law says I&#039;m on month-to-month now or if the lease renews or what.

				In my 10 years and two apts I have never renewed a lease.&nbsp; The upside is that you only need to give 30 days notice to leave; the downside is that your rent can go up any amount at any time.&nbsp; It really becomes about your relationship with your landlord.&nbsp; I went 5 years with no lease paying undermarket because my landlord liked me and I was pretty quiet, but when he sold his house I had no recourse and just had to pack up and go.&nbsp; In my limited experience&nbsp; - depending on what type of building you are in - lease renewals are not standard in Astoria - meaning in the smaller family owned houses.

				If you are in a building with 4 or more units the landlord cannot raise the rent more than is allowed by the rent regulations, which is set by the state.<br /><br />If you stay past your lease in New York City it becomes a month to month.&nbsp; you can break the lease by giving notice as follows.&nbsp; if you want to leave at the end of April you must give your notice before April starts.<br /><br />The landlord can make you sign a lease for the terms of the initial lease, with any statutory rent increase if he wants by serving notice on you.<br /><br />If your landlord did not, you have a month to month buddy, enjoy.

In these cases the tax breaks are for a specified period of time, say 10 or 15 years, and when the tax breaks expire the rent stabilization status of the building goes with it and the landlord is allowed to raise the rent as much as he or she chooses.<br /><br />In response to the original poster, if the apartment is rent stabilized then the landlord is technically required to give you a renewal lease, and you are required to either sign it or move out. If the apartment isn&#039;t rent stabilized then once the lease expired it became a month-to-month tenancy. This means that either the tenant or the owner has to give at least 30 days notice to move out. Note that if you pay your rent on the first of each month and you wanted to give notice today, you would be liable for rent through all of March. This would have been the case if you gave notice anytime after February 1 (when you could have moved out February 28).

You can ask for a lease, but if the landlord refuses then the landlord refuses. The converse can also happen. There are a million scenarios that can happen regarding the amount of rent paid, leases, etc. It&#039;s all negotiation.<br /><br />In a rent stabilized apartment the landlord is required to offer you a renewal lease 90-150 days before your present lease expires. If they don&#039;t, you can put in a complaint with DHCR who will force the landlord to provide the renewal lease to you. Of course I would also start with the landlord and ask them why the lease was late before I went for a formal complaint, but the option is there. If the rent stabilized landlord sends you a renewal lease and you don&#039;t sign it within 60 days (there&#039;s a part of the lease renewal form where you can specify that you won&#039;t be renewing, but you still have to return it within 60 days stating that) it is either grounds for eviction, or if the landlord so chooses they can make it an implied 1 year renewal lease because you failed to respond. <br /><br />Hope this helped&nbsp; :-)
