				1 unfurnished bedroom available in a bright apartment between Broadway and 34th Ave. 2 bedroom one bath 3rd floor walk up. Available starting June 1st or sooner. The room has a closet, hard wood floors (Entire apartment except kitchen and bath is hard wood floors) &amp; wardrobe. My prior roommate easily fit a queen size bed, with a nightstand and desk in the room. The kitchen is fully functional and equipped with pots, pans and utensils. The common area is nicely furnished, so there is no need for common area furniture. Apartment is air-conditioned. Four blocks from N/W and four blocks from R/V/G. Easy access to Food store, Restaurants and Laundry. Rent per person is $793 + utilities which include: Direct TV (looking to lower the package now that my roommate moved out, however negotiable), wireless/wired internet, and land line (also looking to eliminate this service to lower cost). Utilities through most of the year are about $130 a person (as mentioned looking to lower this a bit) during all but the summer months. Rates are a little higher due to use of air conditioners during the summer. <br />Building does not allow pets. No smoking indoors and no drugs. <br /><br />Personal Bio. I’m a 32 year old professional. I’m pretty easy going as long as mutual respect is upheld. I have a very demanding career and at time work long hours and am not around much. I do have to work weekends on occasion. With in reason I need to get a good nights sleep during the week so no random 3am parties during the week. When I’m not working I tend to stay pretty active. I enjoy a cold beer, good wings, music, and the occasional game of darts. I’m a avid reader and movie buff. <br /><br />Ideally I&#039;m looking for a roommate who shares my easy going attitude. Someone who is neat and values their living space. A steady paycheck is a must. While the occasional person over is obviously fine, I do not want to also live with your significant other. We don&#039;t have to be best friends, but I would like someone that&#039;s semi-social, i.e. doesn&#039;t mind going out for a few beers and food once in a while. References are a big plus! <br /><br />Please respond to Mike_Pietro@hotmail.com a little about you and any additional questions for me. I&#039;ll get back to you if I think it might work out. <br /><br />Thanks. <br /><br />Mike <br />
