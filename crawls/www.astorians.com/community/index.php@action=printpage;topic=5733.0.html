				We have a great three room apartment in Queens. We have to secure the place as soon as possible, within the first week of April. We are looking for a clean, fun, considerate, reliable roommate who will pay the rent on time and get along with the two of us.<br />Your roommates:<br />We are one male and one female. We are both artistic, creative types. We have a passion for theatre and painting. We are also clean and considerate. We prefer a non-smoker and a gay friendly individual. Basically someone upbeat, as we are both positive.<br />The place:<br />It&#039;s on the top floor (only one flight of stairs) of a two family house in Astoria, walking distance from the Astoria Blvd station (N,W). We’d get the run of the entire floor. A large eat-in kitchen, bathroom, and three rooms, each with its own door to close against the rest of the apartment. The &#039;living room space&#039; has been set as a bedroom space for one of us – each room has ample closet and window space and solid doors. Windows in all rooms except the bathroom. There&#039;s also a small hallway just inside the main entrance to the apartment with a coat closet and a storage space above it, fairly deep.<br /><br />The landlords live in the apartment beneath. They have two kids, one who&#039;s learning to play the guitar but he doesn&#039;t play too late at night or too early in the morning, and only for about an hour at most. The landlord himself is a nice guy, very accommodating as long as you pay the rent on time.<br /><br />As far as food shopping and nearby amenities go, there&#039;s a laundromat around the corner and a 24-hour mini-market. There&#039;s a Trade Fair two blocks away on Ditmars Blvd, and that&#039;s also 24 hours. Ditmars Blvd, again two blocks away, is where you can get most of your shopping done. Astoria Soundworks, a really handy and inexpensive rehearsal studio, is one block away. The long shopping strip on Steinway Street is a block over.<br /><br />*******Rent is $1500. ($500 each)<br /><br />If interested, or know someone who may be please let us know. We have to secure the apartment by the first week in April with $500 each. The sooner the better. Move in is May 1.<br /><br />So tell us about yourself and if you are interested. We look forward to meeting with you.<br /><br />Email Cary at: carypatrick@gmail.com<br />or<br />phone Amber at: 775-340-2560
