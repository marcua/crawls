				i know there was an old post about dentists up towards Ditmars, but i would love to of hear some good ones below Ditmars. I need to find me a new dr that is on my new plan and there are so many in the book. I just would feel better knowing that someone has at least heard of some of them!

				The advice I&#39;ve been given is to avoid dentists in Astoria entirely and find one in the city who&#39;s on your dental plan, if you have one.<br /><br />Actually, at the gym recently I overheard someone extolling the virtures of a Ditmars-area dentist (&#39;really nice, just him and his wife&#39;, etc.) that she and her husband just started going to. In the same converation I heard this person express surprise that she apparently had a few cavities, but was glad that this dentist &quot;found&quot; them. I was tempted to intrude and suggest she go to another dentist to get a second opinion because this was the same dentist who told me I had two cavities. (As it turned out this was patently false, on the basis of a thorough examination a city dentist did -- several months later.)<br /><br />I kind of felt guilty about not warning her, but I wasn&#39;t comfortable butting in... Oh well.<br /><br />Back to topic: good luck finding a reputable dentist around here. I&#39;ve not heard many success stories (friends, landlord, fiancee) of those who&#39;ve gone local... And if you&#39;re told that you&#39;ll need work done, absolutely get a second opinion -- don&#39;t mention to the second dentist what the first one &quot;found&quot;, though.

				I had a positive experience with a dentist on 33rd Street just on the south side of Broadway.&nbsp; His name, and I&#39;m not joking, is Dr. Love.&nbsp; The only thing he tried to sell me on was tooth whitening.&nbsp; But other than that, he always did a good cleaning, and never tried to get me into proceedures I didn&#39;t need.

				A friend of mine said that &quot;Family Dentistry&quot; right above Commerce Bank on Ditmars and 31st was &quot;a spiritual experience&quot;.<br /><br />Not sure if they have some hidden fettish with people touching their teeth lovingly, but nonetheless they said that the place seemed clean, nice, and the people were good.<br /><br />I have yet to try them yet. I tried that &quot;Ditmars Park&quot; (Ditmars &amp; 29th) dentist place and it was only okay. Wasn&#39;t that impressed, but they didn&#39;t force me to get a root canal or jack me up on laughing gas and then get me to sign my life away at least.

				I really like my dentist.

				The apprehension over that scolding is one reason I kept delaying going to the dentist, which dragged out into a 10 year gap of not visiting.&nbsp; My friend finally convinced me to go to her dentist (this is when I lived in Park Slope).&nbsp; I could only screw up the courage to say that it had been a &quot;long time&quot; since I had been to the dentist, and he said, &quot;so what you mean is that you&#39;re <em>really</em> scared.&quot;&nbsp; Then he smiled, but it was a kind smile.&nbsp; He took one look at my teeth and was able to tell that I had had a broken bone &quot;around the age of 11 or 12&quot; (it was actually 11 years and 9 months) because of the discoloration of some of the enamel on my teeth.&nbsp; He&#39;s great - I still make the trek to Grand Army Plaza twice a year.&nbsp; If anyone ever needs a recommendation for a dentist in Brooklyn, I&#39;d recommend him in an instant.&nbsp; (Oh, and the good news was that I had no cavities or other problems despite my 10 years of not going to the dentist.)

(They asked if I walked in or had been recommended.) Very good dentist, and/but? he sure likes to talk! <br /><br />And no problems! I may have bad genes when it comes to my eyes and my heart, but I sure lucked out in the teeth department...<br /><br /><br />

				Dr. Diana Diedan on 58th and lex. Columbia dental school, high tech office. You can watch a dvd while they work on your teeth. She also takes pictures of your teeth before during and after the work. The hygenist is a bit chatty and annoying. But Dr. D knows it which is cool. If you need more advance care like root canals, she has a specialist come in twice a week. <br /><br />It&#39;s a short ride on the train but Totally worth it.
