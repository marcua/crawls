				I was raised in Queens.&nbsp; For many years, I claimed I didn&#039;t care which team won.&nbsp; Then I was told (by baseball fans) that I had to care so I picked the Mets since they&#039;s from my &#039;hood.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s interesting that there could be so many Yankee fans on a board that&#039;s all about Queens.&nbsp; Hence, the poll.&nbsp; <br /><br />Vote! :mrgreen:

				I&#039;m from Queens, but i changed allegiance from the Mets to the Yankees in the early 90&#039;s. <br />I am the black sheep of the family and some uncles still joke about disowning me over it, and my brother calls me a frontrunner. My dad is still pissed (he&#039;s an old school Brooklyn Dodgers fan, so to have his only daughter be a Yankee fan is like the ultimate betrayal).<br />I&#039;m not one of those asshole Yankee fans who gloats over the Mets losing. I am happy to see the Mets win and as long as they aren&#039;t playing the yanks I&#039;ll root for them. <br />I root for NY...but the Yankees are my team.

				I root for the Minnesota Twins and have since the late 70&#039;s!&nbsp; When I moved to NYC, however, I began rooting for the Mets as my second favorite team!&nbsp; I went to their games and watched them play on TV during the mid-90&#039;s when scalpers couldn&#039;t give a ticket to Shea away!&nbsp; So it was with much satisfaction and glee that I watched the 2006 season!&nbsp; I&#039;m holding my breath this season because of the starting rotation (at least that&#039;s what Steve Phillips tells me) and their ability to keep their batters healthy and productive!&nbsp; They&#039;ve had two good wins so far, but let&#039;s wait and see!<br /><br />BTW, I would hate to see the Twins and Mets play as I have really developed a &quot;home town affinity&quot; towards the Mets, but I could never root against the Twins!&nbsp; We&#039;ll wait for that day to come!

				wait, that is the definition of a bandwagon fan, you abandoned a team because it didn&#039;t win for one that won.&nbsp; 30 years is impressive though, I am a 33 year Cub fan, born into Cubbies onesies.<br /><br /><br />I sometimes wich I can do that, but my desire to punish myself is unquenchable and I remain a sad Cub fan.&nbsp; They won tonight!&nbsp; YAY!

				As a Met fan who grew up rooting for Pete Falcone, Pat Zachary, Steve Henderson and the savior of the Mets, Lee Mazzilli, I used to get peeved over the bandwagoners who became Yankee fans in the late 90&#039;s.&nbsp; I guess if I was a long time Yankee fan, it would peeve me more.<br /><br />But i don&#039;t fret no more because they are only robbing themselves.&nbsp; Winning isn&#039;t fun if it just keeps going on.&nbsp; More baseball knowledge and energy pours out of one section of Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, Shea Stadium then all of Yankee Stadium.&nbsp; Put your standard Bosox fan and standard Yankee fan together and see who could talk about what Bucky Dent did in 1978.&nbsp; That&#039;s the effort of a relationship that makes winning so much more sweeter when it happens.<br /><br />And though I have respect for the longtime Yankee fan, I could never bring myself to root for them.&nbsp; It would be so ...&nbsp; dirty&nbsp; :evil:

				Frappe, I have to say that I haven&#039;t met many of the fair-weather Yankee fan you describe here.&nbsp; Personally, I grew up in the Bronx and remember all too well the Donny-Baseball years of the 80s and the early 90s when the Yankees were not a winning team.&nbsp; Many people I grew up with are the same die-hard fans who are with the Yanks through good time and bad, though being a Yankee we do expect those good times.&nbsp; In fact, when I became a yankee fan as a child in the 80s, the yanks stuck, especially compared to the 86-90 Mets.&nbsp; I can understand people jumping on because it is a winning team, but there are legions ands&nbsp; legions of true Yankees fans in the Bronx and throughout the city that have followed the team for a very long time, take an incredible amount of pride in the history and tradition and are super smart about baseball.

				I was born in Flushing Hospital, my first major league baseball games were Met games. For a team that began in 1964 their championship history is quite impressive. Apparently the Cubbie&#039;s &#039;goat&#039; curse is real. I&#039;m glad that they have embraced the colors and uniforms of the National League teams that they were built to replace...the Giants and Dodgers....the Met &#039;NY&#039; logo is the New York Giants old logo...before they went to San Francisco....and Met Blue is Dodger Blue...the orange is from the Giants...as is the black.....the original Mets home uniform aped the Yankee pinstripes...now the all white is pure Dodger. It&#039;s about time.<br /><br />Unlike most Yankee fans that I know I&#039;ve never rooted against the Yankees in a series just because the Mets weren&#039;t there.<br /><br />I&#039;ve wondered in 1986 ( I was at game seven ).....with the Mets and Red Sox in the World Series...a GREAT series BTW...what did whimpering Yankee fans do? Lock themselves in a closet?<br /><br />I do credit the Yankees on their great storied history of championships...and resisting the marketing pressure to have a &quot;Night Yankee Hat&quot;...a &quot;Day Yankee Hat&quot; or a &quot;Sunday Yankee Hat&quot;. The home uniform is the home uniform...the away uniform is the away uniform...there is a continuity of tradition there. I tip my hat to that. They are one of the few remaining teams that do not put players names on the back of their jerseys.<br /><br />Yet.....<br /><br />I&#039;m still, solidly, a Met fan.<br /><br />.....is there a better or more ferociously played inter-league series than the Mets-Yankees? Since it&#039;s inception...neither team has sweeped. That&#039;s pretty cool.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Just so glad that baseball is back!!&nbsp; I consider myself a Yankee fan, though I like the Mets, too...started out as an LA Dodgers fan, though, back in 1982 (thanks, Grandma).&nbsp; Enjoyed rooting for both the Giants and A&#039;s while living in the Bay Area.&nbsp; Now that I&#039;m in NY, I&#039;m excited about NY baseball teams.&nbsp; Hope to see games at both Shea and Yankee stadiums this year.&nbsp; Also hoping...planning to see some minor league games, both the Cyclones and the SI Yankees.&nbsp; Went to a Cyclones game last year and it was fun fun fun.

				Oddly enough Cyclone tickets are harder to get than Met tickets.<br /><br />How&#039;s that? The farm team is a stronger draw than the &quot;Big Show&quot; team!<br /><br />Possibly due to the size of the stadium and location... hard to beat Coney Island and the Atlantic Ocean. :mrgreen:

				Shea...as a stadium...basically sucks.<br /><br />It was supposed to have a dome...but it was literally sinking in the swamp that it was built on. The added weight of the dome was considered a risk. It was one of those &quot;Do everything&quot; stadiums that didn&#039;t do any one thing especially well.<br /><br />I remember watching the Jets play there and freezing my ass off. Soldier Stadium in Chicago had Lake Michigan, Green Bay&#039;s Lambough (Sp?) Field has that other Great Lake....Ontario? And Shea had Flushing Bay. Let me tell you...December winds blowing off of Flushing Bay was right up there with the best (worst) of them. The outfield was also a shambles after a season of Jet Football.<br /><br />Apparently the new &quot;Citi Stadium&quot;...as in CitiBank...how do you all feel about that?...will look like Ebbet&#039;s Field in Brooklyn. I guess there is no nostalgia for the Polo Grounds that the Giants played on.

For a team that began in 1964 their championship history is quite impressive. Apparently the Cubbie&#039;s &#039;goat&#039; curse is real. I&#039;m glad that they have embraced the colors and uniforms of the National League teams that they were built to replace...the Giants and Dodgers....the Met &#039;NY&#039; logo is the New York Giants old logo...before they went to San Francisco....and Met Blue is Dodger Blue...the orange is from the Giants...as is the black.....the original Mets home uniform aped the Yankee pinstripes...now the all white is pure Dodger. It&#039;s about time.<br /><br />Unlike most Yankee fans that I know I&#039;ve never rooted against the Yankees in a series just because the Mets weren&#039;t there.<br /><br />I&#039;ve wondered in 1986 ( I was at game seven ).....with the Mets and Red Sox in the World Series...a GREAT series BTW...what did whimpering Yankee fans do? Lock themselves in a closet?<br /><br />I do credit the Yankees on their great storied history of championships...and resisting the marketing pressure to have a &quot;Night Yankee Hat&quot;...a &quot;Day Yankee Hat&quot; or a &quot;Sunday Yankee Hat&quot;. The home uniform is the home uniform...the away uniform is the away uniform...there is a continuity of tradition there. I tip my hat to that. They are one of the few remaining teams that do not put players names on the back of their jerseys.<br /><br />Yet.....<br /><br />I&#039;m still, solidly, a Met fan.<br /><br />.....is there a better or more ferociously played inter-league series than the Mets-Yankees? Since it&#039;s inception...neither team has sweeped. That&#039;s pretty cool.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />&nbsp;Actually&nbsp; the NY Metropolitans ( even though people call &#039;em the Mets) began their professional life in 1962 , and like yourself I too was born in Flushing Hospital. One of my first games was at game 3 or 4 of the &#039;69 series, my brother-in-law is a lifelong mets fan, and my sister is an usher at Shea. I actually &quot;root&quot; for the yanks now but any team that&#039;s in NYC I will root for.
