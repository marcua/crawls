				I was on a run today in the Shore Blvd area, and I saw this crazy white mansion on 12th street, near the Shore Towers - in fact, just where 12th street meets Shore Blvd, about five houses south of that intersection.<br /><br />I can&#039;t remember the number - 27-something? It&#039;s this huge white house with pineapples and lions on the wrought-iron gates, and a wrought-iron cupola in the yard. It&#039;s beautiful! Is it owner-occupied and safe from crazy developers in Astoria Village?<br /><br />I&#039;d love to hear any information anyone has about it. Next time I run past there, I&#039;ve GOT to take pictures.<br />

				The house seems to be privately owned and only occupied by one family.&nbsp; And it is probably the finest of the homes in the area.<br /><br />Unfortunately Astoria Village does not seem to be incorporated or organized by any oversight committee with monthly fees and bylaws - such as with Forest Hills Gardens.&nbsp; As a result, while some of the older homes were beautiful in their hayday, they are pretty shabby today.&nbsp; I am not one to defend something just because it&#039;s old.&nbsp; There is a new multifamily dwelling a few doors up from the Tara mansion (same side - going towards the Greek church on the corner) that I think is a beautiful example of a new construction.&nbsp; It&#039;s brick and multi level with beautiful large windows.&nbsp; While the new brick construction on 14th is very generic and not beautiful.&nbsp; So I think if the developer is more creative, something new can be a lot nicer than a totally run down old house.&nbsp; But if the village were incorporated and had rules about upkeep, paint jobs, modifications, etc., then all the houses would be beautifully maintained.&nbsp; In this village, they are not.&nbsp; And I DO realize that this area was not a planned/semi-gated community like Forest Hills.&nbsp; But still, if preservation was a concern, something of a local home owners association could have been formed by like minded neighbors to protect the status and appearance of the village.&nbsp;

				We always knew of the houses in that area as the &quot;Astoria Mansions&quot; though I doubt that was an official name. When I was in junior high, two of my classmates lived there. Is the Greek church still in one of the mansions? If not, one of the houses -- I think it was a big white one -- was part Greek church and part residence (the priest and his family lived there). IIRC, 27-01 12th was the home of my other classmate. I had been to that house many times and it was big, old, and in disrepair back then. Not sure if either family still lives there, though.<br /><br />Closer to the park there was a house that had, um, character. My friends and I would drive by for kicks. In the front yard, the owner hung dolls (yes, dolls) and mirrors from the trees. It was pretty creepy. Whenever we had anyone visiting the neighborhood, we&#039;d drive them by the crazy house. I haven&#039;t driven by in years, but I&#039;m sure by now the owner has changed hands... we&#039;re going back maybe 15 years or so.

				The mansions on 12th street were all connected to each other (at one time) by underground tunnels.&nbsp; The tunnels were accessed through subbasements.&nbsp; The tunnels then led to a main tunnel which led to the river (where Shore Towers is now).&nbsp; The &quot;Tunnels&quot; where always considered to be a myth, but I&#039;ve been in them when I was a child &amp; I use to access them through a friends house.&nbsp; People would say the tunnels were part of the underground railroad, but that wasn&#039;t the intention on its design.&nbsp; My Grandmother told me that they were used by the servants of the mansions.&nbsp; The servants would go through these tunnels to get to the river &amp; get goods (Dried/salted) from the ship(s).&nbsp; They would then take their bounty up through the tunnels w/o being seen by the wealthy above.<br /><br />That&#039;s my Story &amp; I&#039;m sticking with it<br /><br />Mike&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				We drove by the &quot;Tara&quot; last night.&nbsp; It definitely looks better in the pictures.&nbsp; Then again, I couldn&#039;t spend as much time as I wanted looking at it because there was someone by the door and I didn&#039;t want to weird them out and it was also getting dark.&nbsp; The bottom floor windows had a blue tint to them as though someone was watching TV inside with the shades drawn and the lights off so it&#039;s obviously occupied.&nbsp; Did someone say it was?&nbsp; I might&#039;ve missed that.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-(

				Hi<br /><br />I have just joined, and could not help but&nbsp; noticed the topic of 12th street mansions. I used to live in one of those 12th street mansions and miss it very much, and yes the white house, which was named Tara, is privately owned. When I was young we used to play inside and out in the yard, it is a great house. There is allot of history in that block, lots of stories, yes some of the houses had sub tunnels that led to the river by the park.&nbsp; My home had an outer cellar,old wash tubs and a meatlocker where they used to hang the meat, that were probably used by the servants. These homes were the summer homes of the wealthy, I was told as a kid there was a private gate and people had to be announced, and the corner house across from the Greek church had a barn, where they used to keep the horse and carriages. If u notice in front of the white house the 2 large stepping bricks, when they got out of the carriages, used them. All of that area from 12th street down to 1st street were all beautiful homes that were none down. You will never find these homes again, big&nbsp; rooms. Well have to getback to work for now.<br />

				12th Street is my favorite street in Astoria.&nbsp; &nbsp;That block between Hoyt Avenue and Newtown is great.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m sad to report, however, that the character of that block is changing for the worse.&nbsp; &nbsp;The detached single family houses are coming down, one by one, and are being replaced by banal apartment buildings -- six packs I like to call them.&nbsp; &nbsp; The charm of that street is being lost.&nbsp; &nbsp;That street should be landmarked.
