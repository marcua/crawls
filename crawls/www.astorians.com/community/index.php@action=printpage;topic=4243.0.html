Fitzgerald in Chicago to review the telephone records of Times reporter Philip Shenon and former reporter Judith Miller. He has said the statute of limitations will expire on Dec. 3 on certain offenses a grand jury is investigating, and on Dec. 13 on others.<br /><br />The Times had asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to stay an appeals court ruling in the government&#39;s favor. She referred the matter to the full court, and it declined yesterday in a one-sentence order that did not state its reasoning.<br /><br />It was the second time in as many years the court has refused to get involved in a case pitting the government against the Times, and it lets stand a ruling that is the latest in a string of court decisions to go against media organizations that resist revealing confidential sources.<br /><br />The current case arises from Fitzgerald&#39;s post-Sept. 11, 2001, investigation of possible links between al-Qaeda and two U.S.-based Islamic charities, the Holy Land Foundation and the Global Relief Foundation.<br /><br />In December 2001, the Times reporters learned of plans to freeze the groups&#39; assets, and called for comment shortly before FBI agents raided the offices. Fitzgerald is trying to find out if any government officials illegally leaked information to the reporters, and said disclosure of the government&#39;s plans tipped off the charities, endangering law enforcement officials. The Times disputes this.<br /><br />Two years after the stories, and after the Times had declined to reveal its confidential sources, Fitzgerald said he planned to subpoena approximately three weeks&#39; worth of the reporters&#39; telephone records. The Times contends that could reveal the identities of sources who have no relationship to the investigation.<br /><br />...

				The article indicated there is a lot of confusion on what protections journalists have.<br /><br />I dont believe reporters have or should have total immunity. But I would rather have a Free Press that sometimes goes too far than one that is too scared to investigate govt.<br /><br />Sometimes reporters would be held until they reveal sources. Thank goodness some reporters have the integrity to safeguard their sources.<br /><br />***<br />Plug - <br /><br />http://www.nyclu.org/nypd_parade_permits_pr_112106.html<br /><br /><br />http://www.nyclu.org/donate.html<br /><br />
