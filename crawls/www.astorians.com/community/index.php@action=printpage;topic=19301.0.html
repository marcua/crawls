				I noticed Bagel Nosh is opening on Broadway. I think it&#039;s across the street from the Chase bank? Anyone know if this is a chain of bagel shop? The the name sounds familiar. Anyhows seems like bagel shops have been popping up in Astoria lately doesn&#039;t it?

				Bagel Nosh is/was a chain and operated a few locations in NY.&nbsp; I remember there was one out in Fresh Meadows in the same shopping center as the movie theater.&nbsp; It&#039;s possible that it was located where the former Future Diner and current Hooters is.&nbsp; I am 33 and I was pretty young at the time, so the only thing I can say for sure is that the name has been absent from NYC for a while...at least I can&#039;t recall seeing any in recent memory.<br /><br />I have no idea if this new version of Bagel Nosh has any connection to the old.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a site I found that has an old building advertisement for Bagel Nosh on it.<br />http://www.bridgeandtunnelclub.com/bigmap/citywide/feed/bagels/index.htm<br />

				Ate at bagel nosh yesterday morning. Had a toasted everything bagel with scallion cream cheese. It was the best bagel I have had in about 10 years. Beats Brooklyn Bagel and Lots o&#039; bagels hands down.<br /><br />Thank you God.

				I was impressed with the mini-bagel I got on Saturday.&nbsp; Because it wasn&#039;t fresh out of the oven, it had cooled down enough to develop a hard crust, the kind that&#039;s tough to penetrate with a bread knife.&nbsp; Lest you think that&#039;s a defect, old-school bagels are <em>supposed</em> to give your jaw a good workout; otherwise, they&#039;re just rolls with a hole.&nbsp; The taste could be lightly sweeter--I don&#039;t know if the dough has enough malt in it--but I&#039;m otherwise quite happy.<br /><br />The owner&#039;s still in the process of training employees, but it&#039;s clear that they&#039;re eager for business.&nbsp; I bought one full-sized bagel and two minis, and the owner threw in another full-sized one for free.&nbsp; Prices are in line with the neighborhood--90 cents for a full-sized bagel and 55 cents for a mini--and they have a full array of spreads and smoked fish.

				Had breakfast at Bagel Nosh this morning. I had a whole wheat everything with cream cheese and tomato, and it was delicious.&nbsp; The bagel was a reasonable size with a nice crusty outside and softness inside.&nbsp; I liked it much better than Brooklyn Bagel.<br /><br />And, yes, they have sable.

				Yay yay yay great bagels, wonderful smoked fish selection, very nice coffee, decent knishes, and staff with character.&nbsp; They won&#039;t steal me away from 30th Ave. Brooklyn Bagel, at least not completely (mostly because of proximity to home), but I will be back.&nbsp; Often.&nbsp; Very often.<br /><br />They even have sweet Munchee, which is horrible but to which I have a nostalgic attachment.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t seen that stuff in years.<br /><br />If you like smoked fish and other deli-style yumness, please visit here and show them there&#039;s a demand for that sort of thing!&nbsp; Yay.

				I&#039;m very happy with Bagel Nosh.&nbsp; I have to admit that I like the bagels at Brooklyn Bagel better, but their bagels are decent and their staff is very awesome.&nbsp; Plus, it&#039;s super close to my apartment, so now deli sandwiches (that aren&#039;t Subway) are a lot easier to obtain.

				Oh--I should add that it&#039;s kind of expensive.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t get a lot of sable for what I paid.&nbsp; But I guess I expected that going in, so I wasn&#039;t shocked or dismayed by the price.&nbsp; It was really good fish.

				I also tried Bagel Nosh.&nbsp; I liked everything but the bagels.&nbsp; The service is great.&nbsp; Muffins looked delicious but didn&#039;t try them.&nbsp; They had fresh pastrami and corned beef in the steam table and it was delicious.&nbsp; But the bagel was a disappointment.&nbsp; I bought bagels recently at Meli Cafe on 30th and I think theirs are much better.&nbsp; As was their amazing olive cream cheese.&nbsp; I went in for muffins and other baked goods not even expecting bagels but am really glad we tried them.&nbsp; BagelBerry turns me off.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like the look and feel of the place.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t care for Astoria&#039;s Best Bagels at all.&nbsp; Won&#039;t be back.&nbsp; Also had a knish there that was absolutely inedible.&nbsp; But I also like Astoria Bagels on Ditmars and 28th, but saw here that not too many people are fans.&nbsp; I think their bagels are great.&nbsp; So based on that, you many not agree on my bagel critique!&nbsp; &nbsp;:|

				I&#039;m falling in love with Bagel Nosh.&nbsp; I bought a dozen bagels to bring to my friends in Philly and they added not the traditional one extra, but two.&nbsp; I think the bagels are pretty good.&nbsp; I went back to try their belly lox sandwich--very good fish, and when I asked the counter guy for very little cream cheese, he <em>actually listened and gave me what I asked for</em>.<br /><br />I forgot to mention the first time I was there and ordered a sable platter, the cashier/owner took the platter from the counter guy and said &quot;That&#039;s a beautiful platter! You&#039;re going to spoil this guy with a platter that beautiful!&quot;&nbsp; You may have had to be there.

				We recently ordered delivery from them and it was a mess. <br />We ordered two whole wheat bagels toasted with scallion tofu. We received one plain bagel, not toasted with plain tofu. Order FAIL. :roll:<br />We also orderd a half dozen everything bagel to freeze. Those were pretty damn good, but not as good as Brooklyn Bagel IMO. And I&#039;m sorry if you can mess up an order THAT badly you have very unqualified people working for you.<br />We will probably give them another shot, but in person this time. We are never ordering from them again.

				They have one guy working the counter who doesn&#039;t understand English.&nbsp; My love affair with Bagel Nosh may come to a premature end if they don&#039;t find that guy a position that doesn&#039;t require him to take or comprehend orders.&nbsp; The owners are still savvy and great, so try to order from them.
