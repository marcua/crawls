			Hi all,<br /><br />We experienced a site outage after the server was hit with a large amount of spam requests that shut the server down. Everything has been restored now and should be working normally. Thanks so much for your patience while we figured things out.<br />

			Yesterday evening and today site was telling me I was banned. I reported the spam, and I thought I was incorrectly listed as a spammer. Good to know it was a temporary site issue.
