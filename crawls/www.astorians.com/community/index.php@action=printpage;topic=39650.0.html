				A lot of us are still here, just posting less, and doing a lot on Facebook and Twitter.&nbsp; I think when Facebook took off, and the number of Facebook groups created about Astoria expanded, we got less traffic.&nbsp; A bunch of us still do dinner every other month as the AstoriaCentric dinner series.&nbsp; I&#039;ll start posting the events here again.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I hope we can get more folks posting and getting to know each other.<br /><br /><br />I know one of the biggest losses for Astoria was when Momma Mac passed on - she was so good at keeping us all tied together.

				Thanks everybody for the responses.&nbsp; I figured social media was part of the reason but I didn&#039;t realize&nbsp; how much was going on in Facebook since i got tired of it and deactivated my account several years ago.&nbsp; I will check out the AstoriaCentric group and others on Facebook and maybe reactivate my account.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know sometimes the&nbsp; civility can be less than desired on the anonymous sites&nbsp; but I never thought&nbsp; Astorians was too bad.&nbsp; Jackson Heights Life is still very active but there are many obnoxious/uncivil posters on that site and most of the good posters have left because of a few who dominate that Board

				I agree. I&#039;m not on Facebook and won&#039;t ever be. I also don&#039;t do Twitter, Instagram, etc. - that&#039; just my personal choice. Those platforms just take up too much precious time for me. This site used to be interesting and even if I only have a couple of minutes, it was interesting to read people&#039;s various posts. But I&#039;ll probably visit less often if people are opting for FB instead of Astorians.com. Too bad.

				Yeah, I&#039;m with you ladydi.&nbsp; No time for facebook/twitter/instagram and I prefer to keep my anonymity where I can.<br /><br />Nice range of views on this site and people generally get along but if people are moving to other platforms I&#039;ll come by this site every once in a while and be happy with astoriapost.com and licpost.com.<br />

				You can still be anonymous on Facebook and Twitter - happens all the time, but most have their identities revealed and are less combative than they can be here.&nbsp; Both have advantages and disadvantages.

				I still stand by my original comment. Email takes up enough of my time and I have less than zero interest in being on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or any other platform. Every time my partner tells me &quot;I&#039;m just going to check my FB for a<br />minute&quot; he&#039;s on there at least 30 minutes before I say something. <br /><br /><br />I also just don&#039;t feel the need to share my life so publicly online.

				Braun, it&#039;s not always what you choose to give &quot;people&quot;.&nbsp; Facebook will take whatever info they can derive from your associations and your general browsing history by reading tracking cookies set by their associate websites.&nbsp; Kind of like how uber tracks you for 5-10 minutes after you get out of the cab (not to mention how they keep a database of everybody&#039;s trips), but that&#039;s another story altogether.

I used to post regularly but not so much anymore. I still try to check out the new posts about once a week. Unfortunately, there usually isn&#039;t much of interest on here anymore since most of the original denizens and characters no longer contribute.<br />I think this site has gone through several iterations over the years.<br />1. Originally, this was a vibrant online community of locals that wanted to reach out and communicate with their neighbors about their experiences here, We didn&#039;t always agree and at times the discussions could become pretty heated. Honestly. I believe that Astoria then had so much more character and has since become a pretty generic &quot;any town&quot; USA neighborhood. I don&#039;t state this to reopen the old v. new Astoria debate which rages here from time to time. It&#039;s simply the truth that the new Astorians refuse to accept. I am a transplant from the Midweat that has lived in the same apartment for about 20 years. I&#039;ve seen the working class families in my building that were driven away by the absurd rents that recent Midwestern transplants are willing to pay. Of course, many of them live 4 or 5 to a 1br so the rent increases don&#039;t really effect them. This was the period when this board really flourished.<br />2. Enter the new PC moderation team that believed their job was to make sure that everyone towed the party line and got along. Once a thread got heated and emotional/interesting, it was locked down. This drove away a lot of members or, at least, discouraged any kind of exchange of opinions. To a degree, this site was subjected to censorship and several members were taken to task/suspended/banned because the moderators disagreed with their posts. E.g. I was taken to task for simply stating the historical truth that Ditmars was a neighborhood built to house the overflow of Steinway, Queens and not technically part of Astoria, Cf. The Steinway Branch of the QPL in Ditmars v. Astoria Branch in Astoria.<br />3. Then came the rage of old Astorians v. new Astorians as the neighborhood was being genericized (Astoria is not in any way gentrified) unlike Manhattan or Brooklyn. You had long time residents like myself trying to explain to someone that had just moved here that the quality of life in the neighborhood was declining as the &quot;New York City&quot; was being sucked out of Astoria. Thankfully, Astoria hasn&#039;t been so raped as Greenpoint, BK. Originally, people came to Astoria for its &quot;quaintness/Queensness&quot;. Instead of embracing the neighborhood, the new residents tried to transform Astoria into the college town that they came from. Starbucks, Dominos, Papa Johns and subways prolifigated. Really, who can stomach that dreck but Midwestern transplants--$6 foot long v. Sal, Kris and Charlie&#039;s. SMH<br />4. Then came the hostility against any new posters. The old guard piled on the the ad hominem attacks until the PC moderators locked the threads. Again, stifling any debate. More and more people left the site in utter frustation.<br />5. So here we are... No traffic and no discourse<br /><br />

				Hi! I used to post a lot in 2007ish maybe? This is where I made a lot of friends. I no longer live in Astoria, but I miss it -- both this board and Astoria. I would love to move back, but it doesn&#039;t look like it&#039;s going to happen&nbsp; :sad: <br /><br /><br />I do still keep up with the Astoria happenings via Facebook and stuff (mostly because it&#039;s easy) but I totally get your feeling of missing coming home and having a few pages of stuff on here to read. I log in here every now and then and am genuinely shocked that the front page will span 1-3 months!<br /><br /><br />Taco Crawl 2006 was my first excursion, and everyone was so awesome. I still have the pins that were made... :cool: :kiss:
