				Wanted in Astoria (Broadway, 30th Ave., Ditmars areas). I am a professional swf with a 1 cat. I&#039;m looking for a quiet apt, as my current one is very noisy. I pay my rent on time, have a good job, and looking for a new home. Looking to move in April or May. <br /><br />I am not looking for roomates. <br />

				You will not find a 1BR for that price. You may find a studio, but it won&#039;t be a very nice one - like this, for example: http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/abo/1052121603.html

				Don&#039;t be so pessimistic to people. <br /><br />Yes, they probably won&#039;t find a 1BR at that price, but I have a friend who just left a very nice $900 a month basement studio apartment. Mind you, 90% of basement apartments are illegal, but this one was nice and had a friendly couple for landlords who lived above him.<br /><br />It was two streets and half an avenue from the Astoria Blvd stop. In my opinion, a pretty good area and very close to the subway.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it&#039;s not on the market as another friend took it. <br /><br />Like with everything else, there are deals out there if you can find them, but you won&#039;t find them through a broker. Check craigslist and the other services and ask friends (just not the pessimistic ones who tell you what you can&#039;t find).

				As someone who lived in a basement for 6 months up until recently, I would strongly advise against it. You get what you pay for and it&#039;s just not worth it, nor is it particularly good for your mental health.<br /><br />I now live in a 1 bedroom that costs a bit more but I love it and feel a lot happier.

I do not believe $900 for that is realistic without it being some sort of personal favor. Don&#039;t even get me started on Craigslist when it comes to apartment hunting. Actually, I already got started on Craigslist in another thread. Awful.

				I&#039;m sure that all basement apartments are not created equal. And while you may have had a bad experience with one, out of the 4 people I know who have had basement apartments, only one had problems and that apartment and that landlord were sketchy to begin with - but they were moving to NYC (they got jobs here out of college) and were desperate and took the first cheapest apartment they could find. And experienced difficulties. The other three people lived in nice, clean, carpeted, warm, non-flooding basement apartments and didn&#039;t experience any problems. Although one of them did have ugly wood paneling. Oh, the horror!<br /><br /><br />Personally, I have had mostly good experiences with finding apartments on craigslist. Of course, I avoid the ads posted in broken English or that sound sketchy (or have limited to NO information besides a general area and price tag). A lot of other people I know have used craigslist to find apartments and I&#039;ve heard an equal number of success stories as horror stories. The difference is that the success stories involve people finding a nice apartment and the horror stories involve people losing time going to see a horrible apartment (which will happen even with brokers), but they got lovely stories about the horrible apartments they went to see to tell to friends. I don&#039;t know of anyone who went to see a horrible apartment and were somehow forced to take it.<br /><br />I just feel that your blanket statements such as &quot;You will not find a 1BR for that price&quot; and then pointing to the worst apartment on craigslist you could find - is misleading and wrong. You seem to be discouraging people from bargain hunting. I can&#039;t understand why you would do that. <br /><br />You are also alleging that craigslist is not a worthwhile resource to use while apartment hunting. Yes, you will see many bad apartments on craigslist while searching for a good one. But if you go look at the thread someone posted about all the brokers he dealt with who showed him apartments that didn&#039;t meet what he was looking for and tried to upsell him, I&#039;d say that can be said of any other apartment hunting resource. <br /><br />You can find some of the best deals on &quot;by owner&quot; apartments. However, you can also find some of the sketchiest. The most important thing to do is be careful, I&#039;d recommend bringing someone with you when checking out apartments and make sure you feel good about the apartment and the person you are dealing with and don&#039;t sign anything without fully understanding it. And don&#039;t be pressured into making a decision you might regret.

I mean.. do you disagree with that? She said she wants a 1BR by Ditmars, 30 Ave, or Broadway... for $900/month, and does not want roommates. I&#039;m sorry, but no. Why would I say no? Because it would be a waste of time to look for one. As for studios, I&#039;m not saying she can&#039;t find a studio for that price, but I am saying she probably won&#039;t find a nice one for that price in those areas. That one awful Craigslist studio I pulled up was one of the first things that came up when I did a search for Astoria studios for under $1000. I didn&#039;t exactly go scouring CL for the worst thing I could find. If she wants to spend time looking, it&#039;s not like I&#039;m going to stop her. But by warning her, now she knows that if she does find a good place that fits all her requirements, she is luckier than most.<br /><br />My roommates and I went through all this just two months ago, saw a bunch of apartments via Craigslist by owner. And these places were not sketchy, but in almost every case it seemed there was good reason why the place was on Craigslist and not being shown by a broker.. mainly, that the owners had made some horrible renovation decision and the layout was awful. Some other places were decent, but overpriced. Granted, we were looking for 2/3BR places, but from what I&#039;m seeing with smaller places on CL, the same applies.

				I apologize, you are right - finding a 1br for $900 is probably stretching it. I misread your statement. <br /><br />$900 for a good studio, however, is not unrealistic.

				&nbsp;I agree&nbsp; a&nbsp; 1 bedroom anywhere on ditmars should be impossible to find and probably a waste of time to look for . If u do find it , kudos to u and make sure u lock it in with a nice lease . U clearly would be the winner .&nbsp; <br />I think if someone asks a question abt rents or whats going from astoria&nbsp; , especially if they arent from astoria , as a previous poster wrote coming from staten island looking for something in the same price range ....they should be advised that its really hard to find something like that in astoria . Y sugercoat it and basically lie saying it can be done , when most likely it cant .&nbsp; &nbsp;1 bedrooms in&nbsp; the dimars areas are going for 1500 and up&nbsp; , upper ditmars some are even more as the space is larger and newer&nbsp; despite being further&nbsp; from the train . If someone was to rent a 1 bedroom out for 900 , i would worry its in a terrible gang filled area,local town rapist lives upstairs and or mold is growing behind the sheetrock on the walls .
