				Interesting article at MSNBC:<br />http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18277678/<br />The Democratic nomination looks like it will come down to &quot;Super Delegates&quot;. I had no idea that this was part of the Dem party&#039;s process. So for all those who participated in the primaries, do you think this system is fair or unfair? And which candidate does it favor?<br />Also, doesn&#039;t this remind you of Al Gore&#039;s cameo on 30 Rock.

				Actually, it&#039;s more likely that the missing Michigan and Florida delegates (http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=aHVRn9HAldqg&amp;refer=us) who will decide the vote.<br /><br />Also, the super delegates often change their positions numerous times throughout the race and do so in an attempt to pick whomever they think can best win the national election. Many of the super delegates that CNN is predicting for Clinton may switch sides if momentum continues to move in the current direction.<br /><br />Personally, I think the key is that the DNC not renege on their promise that the MI and FL primaries did not count. Some are proposing a &quot;do over&quot; (http://www.freepress.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080207/NEWS15/802070434) to get the votes fairly since Obama and Edwards, still in the running at the time, dropped their names in accordance with the DNC&#039;s mandate. I also think, however, that it is vital that we as voters, let the DNC know we don&#039;t support going back on their word. (http://www.democrats.org/page/s/contactissues)

(http://www.startribune.com/nation/14376066.html) The DNC, however, says the two states ought to hold caucuses to reclaim their ability to send delegates to the nominating party.
