				As Hillary made her announcement, I found it dis-heartening, albeit amusing, that when her &quot;stats&quot; were listed on the screen on CNN (age, title, etc.) that her religious affiliation (methodist) was listed. I&#39;ve been criticized that as a New Yorker, I am not privy to the impact and importance of religion, or rather, a belief in god almighty, across this great land. Since this board seems to have an eclectic group, with a majority of non-New Yorkers, I wanted to put it out there and get some perspectives...<br /><br />I&#39;m not asking that people divulge their own religious affiliation, rather their views on how it should (or shouldn&#39;t) be addressed by our government officials (and those running). <br /><br />If the poll is insufficent, let me know...

				Your question is &quot;Should religious beliefs directly related to issues and controversies be addressed by political figures?&quot;<br /><br />You&#39;re asking whether political figures should address &quot;religious beliefs directly related to issues and controversies&quot;.&nbsp; I&#39;m really not sure what this means.&nbsp; It sounds like you mean that there are certain issues and controversies that have religious beliefs attached to them.&nbsp; I agree to the extent that there are certain issues (for example, a woman&#39;s right to choose, gay marriage, the death penalty, the right to die) to which some people with religious beliefs react strongly, but the issues themselves have no inherent religious meaning.&nbsp; <br /><br />Next, what do you mean by &quot;addressed&quot;?&nbsp; I can think of a bunch of interpretations of it -- do you mean should they<br /><br />- say that yes, one&#39;s religious beliefs directly relate to issues and controversies?<br />- say this is my religion and it influences my take on issues and controversies?<br />- say I will take into account the religious beliefs of my constituents in my approach to issues and controversies?<br /><br />Basically, though, I think you are questioning the role of religion in politics; is that correct?&nbsp; What role should religion have in politics, if any, and what role should a politician&#39;s own religion and/or the religious belief of his or her constituents have in the politician&#39;s approach to his or her job of representing that consitutency?

				Maybe the question is written poorly. What i was interested in was opening a discussion regarding the appropriateness of a government official discussing their religious views in general. The president talking about his discussions with a god. And the way that god is embedded in our political system, in our pledge, in our views, on our money. Does it have a role? Should the issue of gay marriage for example be discussed in relation to religious text? That was more the point. Sorry for the ambiguity...<br /><br />As for the insufficiency of the poll, what options would be appropriate to fit your needs?

				I think an option ought to be added or &quot;necessary evil&quot; be reworded to make it a more neutral answer.&nbsp; Some folks might see it as necessary but not an evil of any sort.<br /><br />The simple fact that it is listed means that to the American electorate, it is necessary.&nbsp; Though a seperation of church and state is what this country is founded upon, a candidate&#39;s religion is important in letting the people know which direction the candidate <em>might</em> lean on a particular subject, just as would a candidate&#39;s party affiliation, the special interests groups that support a candidate, even age and sex.

I think your clarification makes it more meaningful. I do think the poll has too many choices. Necessary evil is just a subcategory of need to be addressed. I will offer up my suggestion that I think it would be a better poll if it were yes or no. Unsure category is wishy washy and doesn&#39;t really measure anything other than the percentage of people who haven&#39;t spent any time thinking about it, and honestly, who cares about that? I&#39;d do the agree/disagree options and let the textual debate give the flavor and nuance to what the poll results mean.<br /><br />I&#39;d add that religion should be a part of any politician&#39;s approach and dialogue. If those beliefs are important enough, they ought to carry over to their private and public lives. The trick is to not mandate who can believe what or place any one religion&#39;s belief sets above another, including atheism.

				I believe it is necessary from a marketing perspective. If a Democrat expects to win they have to pander to the religious right in this country, and if that means that they acknowledge God or that they go to a specific church then so be it. I don&#39;t love it myself, but I do see the value of it to try and win a significant number of votes that they wouldn&#39;t get otherwise. Some may see that as sleazy but campaigning basically equals marketing and vice versa.<br /><br />As far as specific political issues go - no I don&#39;t think that they should directly mix. I&#39;m not a big fan of Bush saying that he feels God supports his war in Iraq, for example. Once you are in office I think that you can still be a religious person and demonstrate that, but if you&#39;re directly mixing your views with your job it&#39;s like me going to church on the weekend, then going into work and saying, &quot;I&#39;m sorry - God told me that I can&#39;t work on your website. It just isn&#39;t gelling with my religious beliefs&quot; or &quot;Let&#39;s pray about this marketing initiative. I feel that we&#39;ll succeed only through the grace of God.&quot; It&#39;s just weird, it divides, and it make for one hell of a work environment.

				I guess I see addressing religion as necessary, but more towards my original topic, a &quot;necessary evil&quot;...I really wish a politician would come out and say &quot;religion has no place in politics&quot; but unfortunately, I think that would alienate the popular vote...didn&#39;t McCain try to do that? and it wasn&#39;t looked at too favorably. Hilary hadn&#39;t stepped foot in a church since her youth until she became more politically active..and now suddenly she is recounting the joys of her church youth group and the influence of her minister. It is pandering, but there must be a need, and as I&#39;ve posted before, can you blame the pandering? I don&#39;t know...I feel uncomfortable with it. I just as soon would have her preference for the color blue stated under her stats. Yes, your relgious perspective may color your views on abortion, gay marriage, the pledge of alleigance, but should it? I guess I would hope that someone that is purporting to take on that much responsibility shouldn&#39;t let it color their perspective. If I vote for you, I don&#39;t really care if you are against abortion personally, as long as you represent my pro-choice needs....

Well, I am too (which is what confused me - were you talking about me or you? Now I get it...), and believe me, I know that it is a region steeped in fear-based religion and politics. While not everyone in the Bible Belt is going to latch on to the idea of certain politicians claiming that they are church-going, God-fearing people, some people will be comforted by these proclamations. Some religious people want to know that their leader is being lead by God and that our country isn&#39;t going to hell in a hand basket (and from a Democrat viewpoint, Bush is doing a terrible job IMHO).<br /><br />It is difficult these days for non-religious people to win a place in office. Atheists and even agnostics would have a terrible time. If you want to be in office, you have to say you&#39;re a God-fearing, Bible-thumping, church-going Christian - even if you&#39;re not. That may be slimy and not all Bible Belters and religious right people will go for it, but it certainly can&#39;t hurt to try. The only thing that is frustrating (and this is the case in the whole of marketing) is that you have to be able to find a balance. Because you have to try to say you are a Christian and love God, etc., on the one hand but then on the other hand you have to make sure that you don&#39;t overstate it because you&#39;ll wind up alienating the atheists, agnostics, and other religious, yet non-Christian people.<br /><br />It&#39;s a definite predicament.

The problem with Hillary is that she is a controversial candidate - not only for Republicans, but for Democrats as well. Since she is more conservative and voted for the war in Iraq many Democrats are hesitant to vote for her. Republicans still see her as not conservative enough, so many are unwilling to break with their party to vote for her. I think that she has less of a chance with Republicans overall than Barack - but there are some Republicans that have publically admitted that they would vote for her. Would it be tougher to get a few converts (pun not intended, but now it is) in the South? Probably. But it isn&#39;t entirely impossible.<br /><br />The problem with both Hillary and Barack in the deep South (as well as other areas of our country) is that many voters are sadly still very sexist and racist, so the whole &quot;I am a Christian&quot; marketing ploy wouldn&#39;t even work with some of these people because they&#39;d never vote for a woman or a black man in the first place.<br /><br />I think it is a complex issue, so it will be interesting to see how it plays out in the coming months and beyond. American politics is terribly fascinating right now!

				I think that if someone has been raised in and/or practices a religion, it&#39;s inevitable that that will color their moral worldview, and that&#39;s fine with me because 1. a lot of ideas about how to make a just society that are, imo, good, come out of religious traditions and 2. everyone is entitled to their own opinion. &nbsp;If you&#39;re a person with deep moral convictions that are based in your religion, and you really want to run for office to have a hand in making the kind of society you think is a good society, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with that either--better that than, for example, a mad, unadulterated &nbsp;lust for power. I think the trick is in making sure that your personal beliefs don&#39;t infringe on other people&#39;s liberties, and that your religiously-based morals motivate you toward making things better and fairer for more people. &nbsp;I think that&#39;s fine, even good, but that&#39;s just my opinion. &nbsp;Furthermore, there are plenty of people in government who are motivated by their religious beliefs to try to curtail other people&#39;s liberties, and I think they&#39;re wrong and I wish they wouldn&#39;t, but I also can&#39;t fault them for trying even if I think what they do is wrong.<br />I think it&#39;s complicated. &nbsp;To allow for the former kind of religiously-motivated politics you have to allow for the latter as well. &nbsp;I imagine that&#39;s why we have a first amendment.<br /><br />P.S. I think Hillary knows she has no chance with the Christian right--I think she&#39;s trying to appeal to moderates who may previously have had a negative opinion of her due to the vast right-wing&nbsp; conspiracy.

				I think people&#39;s political beliefs come from a lot of different places - religion is just one of them. Your family, ethnic background, geographical location, education, profession, age, etc., all influence your political viewpoints.<br /><br />And because religion and politics are both about one&#39;s gut-level beliefs and are attempts to answer very similar questions (Who am I? Who are we? What would make the world a better place? What should I/we be doing to make things better? What is right or wrong in xyz situation?) I think it&#39;s difficult to separate one&#39;s religious beliefs from one&#39;s political beliefs on an individual level. <br /><br />However, I do cringe at the way religion is used to manipulate voters, and the way the power of the pulpit is brought into play. I do not think it is appropriate for ministers to attempt to influence their congregants&#39; votes, and I am not particularly comfortable with politicians visiting churches, either.

				I doubt she wins the majority of the religious right voters, or even a substantial percentage, but evangelicals are not all right-wingers and if she motivates a quarter or a third of them to reconsider her candidacy by talking about her faith, it&#39;s probably worth the gamble.&nbsp; I don&#39;t like to see pandering to conservative positions, but I hate to see people of faith written off as unreachable by Democrats.

I think what bothers me about religion&#39;s place in politics is that religion has a power that other affiliations do not. I had a pastor who stood up in church and preached that, basically, if you voted for Clinton you were voting for a murderer. For many people isn&#39;t just about being accountable in the present life, but also in the afterlife. Knowing that your local soccer club, gardening society or whatever, is in favor of a certain candidate might sway you a bit but when someone who you think has a special connection with God encourages you to vote a certain way, or basically says that a true Christian (tm) has only one right choice in the election, that could be a force of persuasion that might, for some people, completely outweigh any other considerations. And I have difficulty with that. <br /><br />I&#39;m not saying that other societies and organizations don&#39;t exercise an inappropriate level of influence over how their members vote, as well, and I would have just as much of a problem with that. As I&#39;ve stated above, people&#39;s political influences come from a LOT of places, and religion is just one of them. This, however, is an idealistic problem - I don&#39;t see any of this changing.

				I&#39;ve been trying to figure out why it is that I want my politicians to have beliefs, ethics and morals that they believe in strongly and are willing to expound, and yet the idea of politicians expounding, and voting on, their religious beliefs really freaks me out. <br /><br />I think the basic difference is that I like to think of morals and ethics as conclusions that are reached through a sort of philosophical introspection, in depth reading, and perhaps even discussion with others. On the other hand, I think of religious beliefs (especially in certain faiths) as being handed down from on high, with little room made available for individual thoughts. <br /><br />I want my politicians to have strongly held beliefs, but I want them to have reached them by their own thinking, not because that&#39;s what they were taught in church, or synagogue, or at the mosque. &nbsp;

				Being so sure there isn&#39;t a god is just as pompous and arrogant as being sure that there is one. It is the pursuit of knowledge that I believe (can&#39;t escape that word) is what guides most of us in this discussion. So both polar views are closed-minded, by assuming they each have some absolute knowledge. Now, to bring this into politics, by saying one way is wrong without researching and exploring, you are doing an injustice to the people you have been elected to represent.

				It doesn&#39;t bother me so much for people to believe intensely that there is or isn&#39;t a god. Someone&#39;s personal experiences might be so compelling, one way or another, that their belief might be a core part of who they are, something that comes from the gut level and though perhaps inexplicable is undeniable. For someone who speaks in tongues and has no access to research on the phenomenon, the only logical explanation might be that they have experienced the divine. <br /><br />For someone who has experienced a great deal of hatred, chaos suffering, it might seem utterly impossible that any good god would want to take credit for any level of involvement with the human race. <br /><br />But to say that &quot;My own experience makes yours wrong&quot; is what bugs me. I can&#39;t say that it is bad or wrong, because I think it requires a great feat of thought and growth to say &quot;My personal experiences lead me to believe x and yours lead you to believe y, but I accept that your beliefs may as correct and valid to you as mine are to me and that yours are just as likely to be correct as mine.&quot; <br /><br />I think a major key here (ha ha, music joke) is whether you think of belief as organic - coming from within, from instinct, from the gut - or not - coming from careful thought and logic - or some combination of both. And what I most admire is when people can hold their beliefs passionately and unabashedly - but still be open to and curious about more information. I don&#39;t think belief, one way or another, necessarily means being closed-minded.

To hold my nose and defend Dawkins, who I find annoying for reasons already covered, he quite specifically does not say he&#39;s &quot;sure&quot;. Instead he says something like &quot;very unlikely&quot; and then chooses to live his life as though there weren&#39;t a god. Personally, I don&#39;t find choosing to live your life as though there either is or isn&#39;t a god offensive at all. It&#39;s a choice, which is why they call it &quot;faith&quot;. <br /><br />Incidentally, one thing that some of the militant athiests have talked about is the idea that believing in a god/spirituality is intrinsic to our biological nature. The argument being that we have evolved to suspect causes in events that we don&#39;t have other explanations for. This is adaptive, as suspicion about weird happenings is smart when lions are trying to eat you and your peers are conspiring to take your sharp rocks away. So when you have to postulate a cause for the weather, you create an explanation of a divine being. In fact, you get mental satisfaction from this explanation, because now you have one less scary mystery in the world. Whether or not there is a divine being causing the weather or creating life or whatever, it may still be part of human nature to believe it. To deny people the choice of believing in a spiritual world is to deny their (biological) humanity and to restrict their ability to be happy. That&#39;s bad.<br /><br />Clearly, however, some of the systems of spirituality that people believe in deny the humanity of other people, and so I think we can label that aspect of religion harmful, even if the basic idea (choosing to believe in unseen causes because it gives your life fulfillment) is clearly important and valuable to many or most people.<br /><br />With regards to politics, as long as a politicians religious views don&#39;t deny the humanity of other people or prevent you from making good decisions, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very relevant. Unfortunately, the dogma of the religious right often denies the humanity of other people and prevents them from making good decisions...<br />

				might check the numbers for tuberculosis first ....<br /><br />I can&#39;t disagree that there&#39;s a problem with our perception of other religions that does affect our policies and is (imo) unethical.

				Victorine: Good point. Plenty of Unitarian Universalists, Episcopalians, etc. have a strong connection between their religious and political beliefs. Most of the UUers I know are firmly pro-gay marriage, anti-Iraq war, pro-abortion, etc. I agree with the general trend, of course, but I can&#39;t deny that religious beliefs are influencing political action in a way that might irritate me if a conservative were doing it :) And there&#39;s no question that people like John Shelby Spong (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Shelby_Spong) haven&#39;t had powerful political influence.<br /><br />Frappe: According to this survey (http://www.thearda.com/quickstats/qs_28.asp), the non-religious/non-Christian are still very much in the minority.

				Religiousness is not necessarily an indicator of one&#39;s consumerism. Perhaps for the Amish. I did work in an Amish bakery for a while but I didn&#39;t learn much about their spirituality. Just how to make cinnamon buns. <br /><br />I have definitely known religious people - liberal and conservative - to be very much affected by the drive to buy. <br /><br />Everyone has something, in fact many things, that cloud their decision-making. If we all saw clearly the world would be a very different place (peaceful utopia? home of the droids?). It would be hard to for me to break things up into &quot;religious people act this way&quot; &quot;secular people act this way&quot;. <br /><br />I think I have seen people harmed by their intense secularness but it would be hard for me to put a finger on it and say why. I think one thing that religion and spirituality can do for people is give them a way to cope with the inexplicable and the unknown. I sometimes think that people who aren&#39;t religious or spiritual suffer from not having this. And just because people don&#39;t define themselves as religious or spiritual doesn&#39;t necessarily mean than they aren&#39;t, imo. <br /><br />I know this isn&#39;t a very good answer to your question, I&#39;m just rambling along hoping that something will click into place. Maybe not this time.

				Might have been a bit unclear with my example.&nbsp; Obviously there are variations amoung all groups.&nbsp; Like it is wrong to say that all religious folk are against same sex marriage, but when you deal with the general outlook, its a different story.&nbsp; I think its a safe to say that consumerism is a bit more of a credo in the media capital of America then it would be in the bible belt.&nbsp; The liberal/conservative thing I wouldn&#39;t imagine would make much of a difference.&nbsp; <br /><br />But the answer was fine.&nbsp; No group has an inherent up on the other.&nbsp; Everyone has their demons.&nbsp; The secular fear of religion overly clouding policy making is no more founded then the religous fear of secularism overly clouding policy making.&nbsp;

				Jesus openly encouraged his followers to sell all that they had and give to the poor. He said they should not be thinking about how they were going to eat the next day, they should trust in God. <br /><br />Then there&#39;s the famous lilies of the field speech, which makes me question Jesus&#39;s protestant work ethic. <br /><br />Jesus&#39;s family values are also somewhat questionable. As far as we know, he did not marry or have children (this is a point of debate- some have suggested that Jesus and John the Beloved .. .well, John might have been called the Beloved for a reason). He said that anyone who did not leave their families to follow him was unworthy. And that he had come to turn brother against brother. Jesus famously scorned his own mother and brothers, saying that his audience was his family. <br /><br />anyone want to talk about Buddha? Buddha walked out on his wife and kid. <br /><br />I think Muhammed may have been closer to &quot;OK&quot; by modern mainstream standards. Stuck with his wives .. all of them.

Newdow is the guy that wanted &quot;under God&quot; removed from the pledge of allegiance.

				Frappe, I read the link and thanks for posting it. I&#39;m curious how someone in his position negotiates(ed) history in the bible versus history books (both incredibly biased).

				On a more thoughtful note, Salon has an interview with the author of a book, an anthropologist who gives an interesting social/evolutionary take on religion, and who ends up being a fan of Karen Armstrong and Martin Buber (both of whom I like too...)<br /><br />http://www.salon.com/books/int/2007/01/31/king/ (http://www.salon.com/books/int/2007/01/31/king/) (ad view required for non-subscribers)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Take Daniel Dennett, the philosopher who has proposed that religion is a meme -- an idea that evolved like a virus -- that infected our ancestors and continued to spread throughout cultures. By contrast, anthropologist Pascal Boyer argues that religious belief is a quirky byproduct of a brain that evolved to detect predators and other survival needs. In this view, the brain developed a hair-trigger detection system to believe the world is full of &quot;agents&quot; that affect our lives. And British biologist Lewis Wolpert, with yet another theory, posits that religion developed once hominids understood cause and effect, which allowed them to make complex tools. Once they started to make causal connections, they felt compelled to explain life&#39;s mysteries. Their brains, in essence, turned into &quot;belief engines.&quot;<br /><br />Of course, these thinkers are either religious skeptics or outright atheists who mean to imply that we&#39;ve been duped by evolution to believe in supernatural beings when none, in fact, exist. That&#39;s what makes Barbara J. King, an anthropologist at the College of William and Mary, so unique. She has no desire to undermine religion. In fact, she&#39;s been deeply influenced by the religious writers Karen Armstrong and Martin Buber. But her main insights about the origins of religion come not from researching humans&#39; deep history, but from observing very much alive non-human primates.<br /><br />For the last two decades, King has studied ape and monkey behavior in Gabon and Kenya, and at the Smithsonian&#39;s National Zoo. In her new book, &quot;Evolving God: A Provocative View on the Origins of Religion,&quot; King argues that religion is rooted in our social and emotional connections with each other. What&#39;s more, we can trace back the origins of our religious impulse not just to early cave paintings and burial sites 20,000 to 40,000 years ago, but much earlier -- back to our ancient ancestors millions of years ago. And today, King says, we can see the foundations of religious behavior in chimpanzees and gorillas; watching our distant cousins can do much to explain the foundations of our own beliefs. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#39;t think she has much to say about modern American politics... I am interested in reading the book, though...<br />

				I would like to read the book as well, and while this isn&#39;t along the thread of politics and religion, understanding religious evolution and how it functions in our society does give insight as to why we hold on to these beliefs and how it affects our choices, and our voting style.<br /><br />I completely agree, the religion evolved because it is functional and is necessary for most humans to continue their day-to-day existence. I haven&#39;t read the book, but I can imagine if you are a hunter, plagued with the mysteries of the origin of species, and your place in this world, that you aren&#39;t going to get much hunting done...don&#39;t think about it, someone else will take care of it, and you go ahead and do your hunting. <br /><br />From there, religion, like everything else, has evolved, grown, been added to over the years, and has been used as an explanation (albeit explanitory fiction). <br /><br />I&#39;d like to read the book.

				So, to be blatantly honest, I find any mention of religion as a reason for a particular perspective a little scary...sorry but I do. But there are certain religions that I find a little more disconcerting, and Mormon is probably up there. It doesn&#39;t make sense to me, so I would personally have a hard time voting for someone that espoused these beliefs.

				The owner and head coach of the Indianapolis Colts thanked God for prevailing in the SuperBowl. Very pointedly and passionately in front of cheering fans and a worldwide audience of nearly 1 billion people. How can the MVP of the Colts NOT be God? Peyton Manning&#39;s great, but &quot;Most Valuable...&quot;?<br /><br />Who here believes in a God that would want the Colts or any other football team to win, on any given Sunday, over any other team? A God that would arrange for such an outcome?&nbsp; If we&#39;re supposed to respect, as a statement of fact, the claims of the Colts&#39; owner and coach, shouldn&#39;t we expect reporters to confront the respective owner and coach of the Chicago Bears with questions, such as, &quot;Did you realize before the game that God had picked the Colts to win?&quot; and &quot;How upset can you really be about God getting his way?&quot; and &quot;Did you adjust your game plan at half time when it was becoming clear that God favored the Colts?&quot; and &quot;What do you have to say about the fact that God chose the Colts to win today?&quot;<br /><br />Although it&#39;s technically impossible to know, for a fact, that there is a God, let alone what such an entity would be capable of or prefer or want to do or expect of human beings, it is possible to know what people are expressing when they invoke a superpowerful, ultimately righteous entity as aligning itself with them as opposed to others. It takes a leap of faith to belive in something for which no evidence is demonstrable, but it doesn&#39;t take a leap of faith to recognize the psychological and moral incentives that people have for saying that God is on their side.<br /><br />Politicians will associate themselves with God (the JudeoChristian type) in America because they want power, power comes from capturing the votes of groups, and there is a sizable group of people who will vote for the candidate they perceive as advocating their (idea of) God&#39;s political agenda.&nbsp; <br /><br />Whether the sides are occupied by opposing football teams or competing politicians or parents and their children, the point at which one side claims God as an underlying reason for anything is the point at which all basis for reasonable discourse is obliterated, whether they agree or not, because faith is not a reasonable basis for anything. Faith is the absence of reason. <br /><br />Of course, gods are plentiful in our pluralistic society, making every one of us an atheist of one sort or another (Christians are atheists about Jews&#39; God, Jews about Muslims&#39; God, Muslims about Christians&#39; God, atheists about the whole lot of them).... and then there are libertarians who are &quot;atheists&quot; about the &quot;gods&quot; that socialists believe in (a coercive government run by purely egalitarian, all-knowing do-gooders). Gods, broadly construed, are unprovable hypotheses.<br /><br />I understand the poll responses of those who say, &quot;Yes&quot; and those who say &quot;No&quot; to religion and politics mingling. I&#39;d love to hear from anyone who answered, effectively, &quot;...some of the time...&quot; about how exactly they would erect boundaries between religion and politics that would make sense, not just to them, but to the rest of us, using a frame of reference and terms we can all understand and agree upon. In the end, if you suspect that might be too challenging, perhaps because religious experience and expression and feeling are so utterly subjective, then I would submit that in the interests of preserving your religious preferences, you should advocate for a strict separation of religion and politics.

I typically get irritated when people thank god for coincidence or their own good luck, etc. &quot;Praise Jesus, I missed my flight, god sure loves me!&quot; Yeah, well ... so god hated the peophe he let get on the plane?? In that situation I find it offensive because you are thanking god for killing someone else instead of you. :X<br /><br />But in the situation above - yeah, I would be irritated by that too. But I think it might not be meant as a statement that &quot;I won because god wanted me too.&quot; It could be something else, an attempt to play down your abilities and hard work and play up the element of chance and circumstance. In the area of the country I grew up in, thanking god for winning something was - sometimes - a subtle way to say &quot;OK, I&#39;m a talented bastard but I can&#39;t say that my success is completely my own.&quot; What they are thanking might not really be god, not even to themselves. It might just be the combination of circumstances and changes outside their control that contributed to their good fortune. Of course, sometimes people really do believe that either god or the devil is responsible for everything that happens to them. <br /><br />Of course, when it&#39;s done on national tv it&#39;s just obnoxious. And, of course, what first springs to my mind is &quot;Well *that&#39;s* why god keeps dropping the ball in Darfur! He&#39;s always rushing over here to make sure you&#39;re winning!!&quot; <br />

				Victorine, it is a good point, and I kind of addressed part of it in my little rant, that what certain religions belief don&#39;t make any sense to me, so it is hard to take some things seriously. I have gotten into several debates on religion. I agree with some of what Frappe said, as do many theologists, scientists and philosophers that there may be a hardwiring involved, and a functional use for a belief system to help us get on with our lives and focus on the day to day events that are required for us to survive. I have discussed it on this thread as well. <br /><br />However, if there was a religion that preached all kindness, love, and peace towards others, pushing only the good in humanity and preaching acceptance and love, but worshipped a ten foot tall fuzzy bunny, I would have a problem with it, because it is so illogical and nonsensical. Now, that doesn&#39;t make me right. You could argue &quot;who cares who is worshipped and what they believe if they are preaching love and peace to your fellow man&quot; but I wouldn&#39;t be able to swallow the bunny part. <br /><br />Am I saying god is a big furry bunny? who knows...maybe he/she/it/us is.<br /><br />But the truth is, that there isn&#39;t a religion out there that does preach all good and kindness. A religion that preaches love, but only of the opposite sex is not kind and loving to those that love someone of the same sex. A religion that says you can&#39;t masturbate, can&#39;t have sex before marriage, can&#39;t research stem cells, etc. etc. etc. is not kind, but that kindness is subjective. I&#39;m rambling..sorry.

				More in response to Frappe, hardwired is a likely possibility. I&#39;m reading Karen Armstrong&#39;s &quot;A short history of myth&quot; and it is addressing some of these issues, and religion as a myth gone wild. I would love to discuss this with anyone interested in reading it. It is not a dense read like her &quot;history of god&quot; and would easily be read in an evening...any takers?

I&#39;m more interested in tracing this evolution of belief. As mentioned in previous posts, historically people have been battling over &quot;my god is better than your god&quot;. Implicit in this statement was that people did believe in these other gods, or else wouldn&#39;t have felt then need to exhalt theirs over someone else&#39;s. But let&#39;s take it back further. Hundreds of years, and it all comes down to life and death. Archeologists identified grave sites from prehistoric man, indicating that an interest in the afterlife had developed. This is how it began. Fear and unsurity about death (anybody not struggle with this?) Entities were thought up and created to answer questions that we didn&#39;t have the answers to, and rather than spending time thinking about the answer, create an entity and problem is solved. The reasoning is circular, but if it saves cognitive space to think about something else, can&#39;t be too bad.<br /><br />The origins of religion are another debate in itself, and I would love to partake in a discussion, but if the purpose was to explain the unexplainable, can we continue to make decisions and take political stances based on entities that evolved from a primitive responses to unanswerable questions?

Those of us discussing this topic represent a truncated sample of not only the general population, but even the population of debaters on this board. Some have tired of the conversation, maybe even becoming frustrated with the helplessness of the discussion. We all kind of agree with eachother. No one on this particular thread has vehemently opposed another poster, so what are we really debating? Not much. I&#39;m pretty confident that most of us would prefer a politicion president that stuck to &quot;just the facts ma&#39;am&quot; and followed a logical line of questioning, but the 68% of the middle bell curve of the country isn&#39;t.

				Karen Armstrong talks about this a lot. The idea that scientific theories often come out ot quests to answer questions about the universe, god, and our place in it, and argues that this is a good thing. (I would agree). Einstein for example was a seeker of answers, and what better question than of our origin, existence, purpose, and future. A little out of the thread topic, but science is not addressed in politics with the same zeal as religion. Ones scientific views and orientation do not tend to be a topic of discussion.

Any pursuit, without context without balance can&#039;t bring you happiness.

				Money is a symbol of acquisition. We want to acquire things, lots of things. Is it our religion to acquire, or do we need instant reinforcement to maintain a behavior? If you engage in a kind act towards someone and don&#039;t get a &quot;thank you&quot; or acknowledgement, what are the odds you will engage in that behavior again, if the only reinforcement is a wonderful afterlife (that you need to wait a lifetime for?) Money is feedback that you are doing something right, though &quot;right for who&quot; is what we may lose track of.l <br /><br />Acquisitions provide immediate pleasure and reinforcement. Therefore the behavior that was exhibited to acquire the item/thing/t.v, becomes stronger, reinforced, and is given another opportunity to be practiced. Religion, god, are things that require time, waiting, and patience, with NO instant reinforcement, no feedback that you are on the right track. Is it possible that we intrinsically are wired to need immediate reinforcement, rather than to wait. Evolutionarily speaking, you better acquire food while you are hungry or else you will starve. An immediate reinforcement feedback loop in order to survive. Money is the means for us to acquire what we need, but that has shaped into acquiring what we want or rather THINK we need. Money and acquisitions are easier to believe in and to strive for because they are concrete. We get it right away and don&#039;t need to wait. This may make &quot;money/acquisition&quot; our goal, not our god...it is what provides immediate reinforcement, that doesn&#039;t require a lifetime in order to be reinforced for a target behavior. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know the statistics, but are individuals in a lower SES more religious? I feel like I have heard this but I don&#039;t have a citation. Do they follow a god as the money and acquisitions are not forthcoming necessitating another goal, another purpose? Do they find meaning in random acts because &#039;feedback&quot; is necessary in order to maintain a behavior? <br /><br />And frankly, where is the role of this in our political life? Do the decisions made by our elected officials that require some feedback loop of approval or disapproval by the people (because it isn&#039;t coming from a god that I am aware of) have a role in decision making in stem cell research and gay marriage?<br /><br />

				It’s much easier to make my flippant remark like that then to support it.&nbsp; There have been books written on this :-)<br /><br />We’re a pretty rational nation, but the one central belief that we hold is that the more money one has, the happier one shall be.&nbsp; We take this statement as an article of faith because there is no scientific proof which supports such.&nbsp; <span class="bbc_u">What other belief system do we have in this country that is so pervasive?</span> (Commercial consumerism perhaps?)&nbsp; Our media is constantly extolling this.&nbsp; This belief guides our decision making.&nbsp; Example:<br /><br />Bonded slavery did not end because people thought it was an awful practice.&nbsp; Bonded slavery ended because it was no longer an economically viable institution.&nbsp; Presently, wage slavery is an economically viable institution and it openly flourishes.&nbsp; <br /><br />True, every society has to make such economic decisions, however, in America we are less encumbered by other belief systems when making such.<br /><br />I think it’s something we aren’t comfortable with because we feel its too pedestrian to form a core belief system around.&nbsp; But its not an inherently bad thing and the institution of money doesn’t need to be defended.&nbsp; It has some positives:&nbsp; The “–ism’s” shall not end by government decree nor a liberalizing of society.&nbsp; They shall end when they no longer make economic sense.&nbsp; Money, more then justice, is blind.&nbsp; An ideal that we seem to be working towards is that nothing else ought to matter except for one&#039;s own abilities.&nbsp; These abilities are (mostly) translated into money/consumerism.<br /><br />But it is a belief system, one which is not compatible with some of the other systems around the world.&nbsp; It prevents us from understanding other cultures and I personally think its gotten us into the hot water we presently are in.&nbsp; <br />

An increase in wealth (winning the lottery, say) will make you happier for a while, but the effect wears off. <br /><br />Jtrane, excellent point.

				http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,,2032616,00.html<br /><strong><br />Evangelical Christians attack use of torture by US</strong><br /><br />Ed Pilkington in New York<br />Tuesday March 13, 2007<br />Guardian Unlimited<br /><br />The uncoupling of American evangelism from the administration of George Bush gathered pace yesterday when one of the largest national umbrella groups of socially conservative Christians issued a statement critical of US policy towards detainees and repudiating torture as a tactic in the war on terror.<br /><br />The National Association of Evangelicals (NAE), which represents about 45,000 churches across America, endorsed a declaration against torture drafted by 17 evangelical scholars. The authors, who call themselves Evangelicals for Human Rights and campaign for &quot;zero tolerance&quot; on torture, say that the US administration has crossed &quot;boundaries of what is legally and morally permissible&quot; in the treatment of detainees.<br /><br />&quot;Tragically, documented cases of torture and inhumane and cruel behaviour have occurred at various sites in the war on terror, and current law opens procedural loopholes for more to continue,&quot; the NAE said last night.<br /><br />The strong alliance between Christian evangelicals and Mr Bush, an important key to his electoral successes, has been tested in recent months with the Mark Foley scandal over his attraction towards male teenage pages in Congress, and perceived corruption in parts of the Republican party. One in three white evangelicals voted for Democratic candidates in last November&#039;s mid-term elections, a rise on the 2004 presidential elections.<br /><br />But Christian criticism has tended to come from the right of the Bush administration. Yesterday&#039;s statement on torture suggested a new determination on the part of the evangelical churches to detach themselves from the Republican party and stake their independence - even if it is from a position more traditionally associated with the left.<br /><br />A leading figure within the NAE, Rev Richard Cizik, told the Associated Press that the statement condemning torture was not intended as a criticism of the Bush administration. But he added: &quot;There is a perception out there in the Middle East that we&#039;re willing to accept any action in order to fight this war against terrorism. We are the conservatives — let there be no mistake on that — who wholeheartedly support the war against terror, but that does not mean by any means necessary.&quot;<br /><br />The document on human rights quotes the Bible, Pope John Paul II and Elie Wiesel among other authorities. It particularly condemns the indefinite detention of suspects without trial.<br /><br />&quot;As American Christians, we are above all motivated by a desire that our nation&#039;s actions would be consistent with foundational Christian moral norms,&quot; the document says. &quot;We believe that a scrupulous commitment to human rights, among which is the right not to be tortured, is one of these Christian moral convictions.&quot;<br />
