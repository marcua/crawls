				<br /><br />I saw you hug your purse closer to you in the grocery store line.<br />But you didn&#039;t see me put an extra $10.00 in the collection plate<br />last Sunday.<br />I saw you pull your child closer when we passed each other on the<br />sidewalk.<br />But you didn&#039;t see me playing Santa at the local mall.<br />I saw you change your mind about going into the restaurant.<br />But you didn&#039;t see me attending a meeting to raise more money for<br />the hurricane relief.<br />I saw you roll up your window and shake your head when I drove by.<br />But you didn&#039;t see me driving behind you when you flicked your<br />cigarette butt out the car window.<br />I saw you frown at me when I smiled at your children.<br />But you didn&#039;t see me when I took time off from work to run toys to<br />the homeless.<br />I saw you stare at my long hair.<br />But you didn&#039;t see me and my friends cut ten inches off for Locks of<br />Love.<br />I saw you roll your eyes at our leather coats and gloves.<br />But you didn&#039;t see me and my brothers donate our old coats and<br />gloves to those that had none.<br />I saw you look in fright at my tattoos.<br />But you didn&#039;t see me cry as my children were born and have their<br />name written over and in my heart.<br />I saw you change lanes while rushing off to go somewhere.<br />But you didn&#039;t see me going home to be with my family.<br />I saw you complain about how loud and noisy our bikes can be.<br />But you didn&#039;t see me when you were changing the CD and drifted into<br />my lane.<br />I saw you yelling at your kids in the car.<br />But you didn&#039;t see me pat my child&#039;s hands, knowing he was safe<br />behind me.<br />I saw you reading the newspaper or map as you drove down the road.<br />But you didn&#039;t see me squeeze my wife&#039;s leg when she told me to take the<br />next turn.<br />I saw you race down the road in the rain.<br />But you didn&#039;t see me get soaked to the skin so my son could have<br />the car to go on his date.<br />I saw you run the yellow light just to save a few minutes of time.<br />But you didn&#039;t see me trying to turn right<br />I saw you cut me off because you needed to be in the lane I was in.<br />But you didn&#039;t see me leave the road.<br />I saw you waiting impatiently for my friends to pass.<br />But you didn&#039;t see me. I wasn&#039;t there.<br /><br />I saw you go home to your family.<br />But you didn&#039;t see me. Because, I died that day you cut me off.<br />I WAS JUST A BIKER. A person with friends and a family. But you<br />didn&#039;t see me.
