				Bitter melon (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitter_melon).<br /><br />I&#39;ve never had it, either.&nbsp; It really is supposed to be quite bitter, due to its high quantity of quinine (hey, just soak a slice with some gin and .... nevermind).&nbsp; Anyway, a couple of options:<br /><br />From Chowhound:&nbsp; Bitter melon chips (http://www.chowhound.com/topics/show/310951)<br /><br />More information (http://milonee.net/bengali_recipes/bitter-melon/bittermelon.html), with Bengali recipes<br /><br />More bitter melon recipes (http://www.bittermelon.org/recipes.htm) from the National Bitter Melon Council (http://www.bittermelon.org/).

				<strong>Eggplant &quot;Sandwiches&quot;!</strong><br /><br />3 Medium To Small Eggplants (or 1 huge one from your CSA!)<br />1 Pound Fresh Mozzarella ball<br />2 Eggs, beaten<br />1 1/2 Cups Seasoned Bread Crumbs<br />Fresh Basil Leaves<br />Vegetable Oil For Frying<br />Salt &amp; Pepper<br />Lemon wedges to finish<br /><br />Cut the eggplants into round slices, about 1/4 inch thick. Cut the cheese into thin<br />slices to match the size of the eggplant rounds. Place the breadcrumbs<br />in a shallow tray. Take two equal sized slices of eggplant, and place a slice of cheese <br />and a fresh basil leaf between them. Carefully dip the &quot;sandwich&quot; first<br />into the beaten egg, and then into the bread crumbs. Heat the oil in a large deep skillet<br />about 1 inch deep. Cook the eggplant sandwiches until they are golden brown. Keep<br />them warm in the oven, while you continue to cook the rest. Serve warm, or at room<br />temperature with a little squeeze of lemon (or topped with bruchetta!). Smile.

				Bitter Melon! (I grew up with this stuff in Manila)<br /><br />It must be such a weird veggie to people who haven&#39;t encountered it before. This is what I remember when I ate it as a kid: (still do, if I am ever home)<br /><br />1 bitter melon<br />1 egg<br />some ground chicken, pork or beef (not much needed)(optional)<br />1 clove garlic<br />Ginger<br />S&amp;P<br />Cooking oil<br /><br /><br />Cut bitter melon in half length-wise (I haven&#39;t see this variety with all the pointy extaraneous bits) and remove most of the rind. Cut bitter melon into slices about 1/8 inch thick. Julienne some ginger (to taste) and put aside. Crush garlic.<br /><br />In a sauteeing pan, add 1/4 cup of water. Add bitter melon and bring water to a boil. Stir for 7 minutes or until water evaporates, which ever comes first. Drain water if any left. On medium high heat, add oil, garlic, ginger and sautee for 5 minutes. <br /><br />Add egg and meat (optional) and stir until egg is cooked. S&amp;P to taste. If you are bold, add a splash of Thai/Philippine fish sauce.<br /><br />Serve with rice. <br /><br />YUM!<br />

It reminds me of social gatherings in Manila with grandma, and her commadres playing majong and eating durian. <br /><br />[EDIT: Oh, I forgot to mention. My dad and I have a laugh when we come across &quot;Fear Factor&quot; on NBC, where they have to eat &quot;Century Eggs&quot; (what a misnomer!).

I saw the same show with AB. I love that guy. So adventurous! Have you been to his restaurant here, &quot;Les Halles&quot;? Superb steaks.<br /><br />Your friends have much truth when they say that. The durian&#39;s imported here are frozen before shipping and kept that way until they are thawed in market. The reason for this is to prevent its rather pungent aroma from permeating during shipping, whether it be on cargo/pax planes. As a matter of fact, SIA (Singapore Airlines) prohibits the transport of durian in/out of Singapore. This is largely due to the fact that it would basically smell-up the plane/airport/passengers! <br /><br />The durians we get here in the U.S. are primarily from Thailand. The Filipino durians are bigger, and, IMHO, much tastier. The more pungent they come, the &quot;creamier&quot; they taste.<br /><br />I&#39;ve never had a durian here in the U.S. (they are available in Chinatown (Queens/Manhattan)) I am so used to the unfrozen ones. But, there is always room for curiosity.<br /><br />Shall we try one?

				Dinuguan is pig intestine stewed in blood.&nbsp; It looks black with chunks of stuff in it.&nbsp; NOTHING LIKE THE RABBIT!&nbsp; The rabbit is delicious and I&#39;d eat it again and again!

				I&#39;m glad you guys filled me in - I gave my bitter melon to a Filipino woman I work with. She was so excited! Now I wish I&#39;d grabbed a couple instead of the one small one (that was mostly for novelty&#39;s sake).

Yes, balut is such a gross thing to the western world, and your nickname for it is graphically accurate!<br /><br />Pandesal is the bomb, isn&#39;t it? For anyone interested, it&#39;s small dinner roll type of bread used for little sandwiches or dipping in coffee. It tastes a bit like Portuguese sweet bread.<br /><br />Bibinka is really yummy stuff, too. http://www.pinoycook.net/index.php/recipes/recipe/bibingka-and-puto-bumbong/1<br /><br />was your mom an expat there? did you or she go to ther International School Manila?<br /><br />

				My parents are Chinese - my grandparents came to the Philippines from south China for work, met there, went back home to get married, then returned to the Philippines to raise their family.&nbsp; She was born in Pampango and grew up in Manila.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know any Tagalog except for one very bad word.&nbsp; &nbsp;:lol:&nbsp; I don&#39;t know which school she attended, but I&#39;ll have to assume that it wasn&#39;t the American school...<br /><br />There&#39;s a great Cuban bakery called Big Booty on West 23rd between 7th and 8th Aves. that makes a bread called the &quot;booty bun&quot; and it tastes remarkably like pandisal.&nbsp; My Filipino aunt (my uncle&#39;s wife) used to make incredible pandisal...yum...
