				Have any of you checked out Fresh Start on 23rd Ave? It just opened not too long ago... kind of convenient to have in the 'hood, but a bit expensive!

				I went there yesterday for the first time. It is a nice store and looked really clean, but I also felt the prices were expensive. I buy gluten-free food and some of their baking mixes were twice the price of what I normally pay. Also, their snacks seemed overpriced. Their prepared foods looked fresh, but I left without making any purchases.

				I went in yesterday. &nbsp;The prices are definitely high, but I bought a bunch of stuff anyway. &nbsp;I was just so happy to find a lot of the products that I can't find anywhere else in Astoria.

				Rapture, I am not sure where you live but I usually go to Astoria Natural Center on 31st Ave at 41st St. It is a small store and not nearly as new and clean as the store on 23rd but they seem to have a good selection and much more reasonable prices. The owner has actually given me his wholesale catalogue to pick items I would like to see in the store. If transportation is an issue, you could probably take the bus on Steinway and get off at 31st Ave. It is only one block east of Steinway.

				Actually I've been to that store.<br /><br />Well, I should say, I went to that store before it moved. &nbsp;It used to be a few blocks away from where it is now.<br /><br />I found less of a selection there, and it is a bit of a ways for me.

I seem to recall trekking over there in search of a decent grocery store and not being able to find any supermarket...<br /><br />OT &gt; &nbsp;I can't explain it, but that plaza has some sort of nether-sub-urban weird energy to it. Like a portal to a nightmare zipcode. Portobellos frightens me. The Matrix creeps me out (does anybody ever go there??) and isn't there some quasi-mafia looking club/bar/strip joint at the far end of it? &lt; OT<br /><br />Back to topic: I popped in the health food store about a week or so ago, and yeah, the prices are higher than what I've managed to find in the supermarkets, but I like the fact that:<br /><br />1) it's closer than Key Food<br />2) it's not Key Food<br />3) hot food/sandwiches which is a welcome to my usual on-the-go chow (which I do all the time since I have crazy hours and little time to cook)<br />4) it's not Key Food

				Just spotted -- new bulk stuff!<br /><br />Fresh Start has added some a new bulk section (dried fruits, nuts, etc) which looks promising.&nbsp; No prices posted yet but I know there are some bulk fans on the board.<br /><br />
