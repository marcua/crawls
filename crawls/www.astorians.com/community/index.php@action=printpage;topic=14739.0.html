Two submissions per person only - show us your best work.<br />1. Your image should be in digital format.<br />2. The picture needs to be taken with at LEAST at 3mp camera. Scanned images must be HIGH quality. (the bigger the better)<br />3. A small version of your image should be posted to this thread with a brief description of what it is. Please embed the image in the post if you can (use Flickr&#039;s link feature, or wherever you want to host it.)<br />4. The contest starts immediately and will run until May 21. At which time the contest will be closed to entries.<br />5. Astorians will then vote on the submitted images.<br />6. A winner will be announced and the graphic will go live on the homepage shortly thereafter.<br /><br />Further details:<br />Your image will run for a period of weeks or months. It should be a picture that captures some aspect of Astoria, and ideally, should be a spring or summer theme. On the bottom right hand corner we&#039;ll provide your name/username/link/email whatever you want (in text) so people can link or contact you.

				Nice work Harlan! :mrgreen:<br /><br />Today actually turned out to be perfect weather for snapping a few shots. I was kinda bummed when I realized that the sun was sticking around because I was already out for the day and I didn&#039;t bother to bring my camera, but there&#039;s always tomorrow ...<br /><br />I&#039;m really digging the fence shot. The only thing that I found distracting (and I&#039;m really digging here, because it&#039;s a really cool shot) is that the trefoils in the left hand portion of the fence are just slightly outside of the depth of field, and as a result, they appear a little soft for being so large and prominent in the shot. You might try reshooting it at the same distance from the fence, focused on the same spot you focused on the first time, but adjust your aperture so it is slightly smaller. I noticed you used f/3.7, maybe try it at f/4, f/4.5, or f/5, so the depth of field will be just a little greater.

				Thanks Daisy. :-)<br /><br />It might look a little overcooked when viewed using Apple Safari. I add a little extra color saturation to images that I upload to Flickr because Internet Explorer and Firefox don&#039;t handle color spaces correctly, so anything I upload ends up looking slightly different than I planned. It&#039;s a little bit of a crap shoot ... I wish the browser programmers would get their acts together and fix this, it&#039;s been an issue for years now.

As long as you shoot in RAW you can do pretty much anything you want. It&#039;s like having your own chemical darkroom at home as opposed to taking all your rolls of film to the local camera lab and hoping they produce the image you wanted. :-)

				I unfortunately got busy with work and wasn&#039;t able to grab any more Astoria related shots that would fall under a Spring/Summer theme, so just for grins I&#039;m going to submit this one as my second entry.<br /><br />It&#039;s a long exposure of Astoria Blvd from the subway platform taken around 5:30 in the afternoon. I&#039;m working on a series of &quot;deserted&quot; New York City images and this is one of my first experiments. I know it doesn&#039;t fit the theme in any traditional sense, but any feedback is always appreciated. :-)<br /><br />The full image ...<br />(http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2188/3527222024_73c0324731.jpg)<br />View Full Size (http://www.flickr.com/photos/manicmaurice/3527222024/)<br /><br />My Banner Crop ...<br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3622/3526407519_48694ac42b.jpg)<br />View Full Size (http://www.flickr.com/photos/manicmaurice/3526407519/)

				How about in the future all submitted contest photos be presented in both original and banner-cropped formats?<br /><br />Is there enough space on the Astorians website to hold a photo album, or should there be a separate account set up on a Flickr type site?<br /><br />Is there going to be a run-off for the tying photos in the current contest?

				Congratulations to our TWO winners! I&#039;m going to have to figure out if we can have a rotating banner. If not we might have to have a run off, or run them each for a while. More to come soon! :)

				For some reason, I&#039;m back to the wintry photo. Anyone else? I&#039;ve tried refreshing and using a different browser. I miss the photo of the Triboro :)<br /><br />(OH OK FINE RFK BRIDGE.)

				Thanks Dutch Kills ...<br /><br />I really enjoy making my images, so it&#039;s always nice to see that other people appreciate them too. Thanks for the kind word ...<br /><br />If you&#039;re interested, you can check out my other images on Flickr. My photostream is a real jumble of styles, but I like to think that my sets help tame the chaos. Well okay, they at least group everything into categories. ;-)<br /><br />ManicMaurice&#039;s Flickr Photostream (http://www.flickr.com/photos/manicmaurice/)
