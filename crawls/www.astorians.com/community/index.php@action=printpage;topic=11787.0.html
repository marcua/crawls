				I have been meaning to try the nondescript (check out the Google street view (http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=34-01+45th&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=45.822921,80.947266&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=40.759643,-73.916016&amp;spn=0.01076,0.019763&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=40.754684,-73.916973&amp;panoid=kr7GhMPEaXFIkuQ-Mh1pkg&amp;cbp=1,138.41774168714585,,0,-2.537012360626786)) United Miners Soccer Club (RUDAR) (http://www.rudarclubny.com/restaurant.asp) restaurant for years.<br /><br />The restaurant gets decent reviews every now and then. I&#039;ve never got up the nerve to try it out.. it just looks like someplace you should have to know a password to get in the door.&nbsp; <br /><br />Has anybody here tried it? Perhaps it is best put off for cooler days when extra calories are useful.<br />

				This place creeps me out.&nbsp; It looks like you could go in and never get out...alive.&nbsp; Do they even have windows?&nbsp; <br /><br />If someone checks it out and it turns out to be like walking into the closet in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe ,,, please do tell.

				I have passed through those doors and lived to tell about it.&nbsp; They serve Istrian food, which is sort of like italian with a german austrian bent.&nbsp; Think hearty gnocchi, simple fried fish.&nbsp; it is very good very inexpensive and can be pretty heavy.&nbsp; It is intimidating to go in there the first time-- you walk inside to a bar where there may or may not be patrons, and ask where the resto is and you are pointed downstairs.&nbsp; Sometimes the place is completely empty, other times it&#039;&#039;s like walking into a party.&nbsp; The room looks as though it hasn&#039;t changed since the 50&#039;s (in a good way) and the women running the restaurant are very sweet.&nbsp; It&#039;s only intimidating to walk in the door.&nbsp; There are often large parties- weddings, showers and the like, but even then they will manage to feed you.

				Thanks QuentinC.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know when I would have ever heard about this place without this board, and it sounds pretty intriguing.

				I&#039;ve eaten there a couple of times. Good, homemade Istrian food. The restaurant is downstairs with the bar/club upstairs. It&#039;s fun and the food is good.

				I live across the street and always thought it was a secret club kind of place. Like I&#039;d need to know their handshake or what not to get in.

				We&#039;ve been a few times for dinner with a Croatian relative.&nbsp; Excellent food.&nbsp; But I can&#039;t be sure how comfy we&#039;d feel without being with them and him speaking Croatian to the waitress.&nbsp; Order anything they make with veal.&nbsp; It will be delicious.&nbsp; The gnocchi is usually lighter than a traditional Italian restaurant.&nbsp; And if you&#039;re daring, order any dish made with tripe.&nbsp; They do a nice job with it.&nbsp; <br /><br />As for the weirdness - I&#039;m getting used to these places in Astoria.&nbsp; Though I never saw them anywhere else I lived in Queens.&nbsp; All these so-called soccer and sports clubs.&nbsp; It seems odd to me.&nbsp; I guess they really don&#039;t want just anyone coming in.&nbsp; So in that sense, it isn&#039;t welcoming to &quot;the rest of us&quot;.&nbsp; But if they do - then why not drop the silly soccer business and put up an awning that indicates Croatian/Istrian food and entice the public to come and eat?&nbsp; The people going in there clearly haven&#039;t been in any condition to go near a soccer ball in at least 20 years.&nbsp; I notice in many instances these clubs are just there to skirt smoking laws.&nbsp; They also seem to be hang outs for old men who want to get away from their wives for a while.&nbsp; I guess the ethnic version of an OTB.&nbsp; I also suspect that once their &quot;membership&quot; dies out or moves to the burbs, they will have trouble keeping this up.&nbsp; For now, give it a shot.&nbsp; But don&#039;t be surprised if you don&#039;t feel like they roll out the red carpet.

				I was just browsing the restaurant section, and I have to say I have been to this place, albeit before I moved to Astoria!&nbsp; My cousin, who is Austrian and German, brought my family here one night about a year ago.&nbsp; It is a bit intimidating walking through the front door, but the restaurant is great; we had some delicious food (some kind of mini sausages and assorted appetizers with calamari to start, and then a chicken dish, I can&#039;t remember the specifics, but I went home full and satisfied!).&nbsp; Our waitress was attentive and gracious, and now that I have been reminded, I can&#039;t wait to go back to this place again!&nbsp; Glad I stumbled upon it here.
