				I thought I&#039;d list my recommended restaurants here so that people can get a sense of the kinds of food I&#039;m into but also so that everyone has an aggregated list for reference.&nbsp; Just so you guys know, I&#039;m generally into authentic ethnic and regional cuisines executed with a lot of precision and/or passion.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like my foods greasy and I&#039;m an accomplished cook in my own right, so there are times when I get a little critical of sloppily executed dishes.&nbsp; Also wanted to mention that I&#039;ve been eating mostly at home lately to cut back on expenses, so I haven&#039;t exactly splurged in the neighborhood just yet.&nbsp; Places I&#039;d recommend thus far being in Astoria for almost 2 months now:<br /><br />Agnanti - exceptional seafood, good mezes, mediocre meat dishes, moderate portions, moderate pricing.<br />Taverna Klycades - more seafood variety than Agnanti, good mezes, overly generous with olive oil making dishes generally a little oily, moderate pricing<br />Zenon Taverna - large portions, moderately low prices, solid food with some of it being very good<br />Last Stop Restaurant - large portions, low prices, good/solid food with nothing exceptional but nothing bad either<br />Neptune and Mike&#039;s Diner - low prices, decent food, you can&#039;t go wrong but you&#039;re not going to get dazzled either<br /><br />There are some that I can&#039;t recall right now and there are a whole bunch that I would NOT recommend, but I&#039;ll keep adding to the list as I go along.<br />

				Wanted to add to your list, Brick Cafe at 3095 33rd St.&nbsp; Had dinner with the hubby there last night, and it was very nice.&nbsp; The atmosphere was very pleasant, the service - very attentive and the food was just delish!&nbsp; I had the fresh Pappaelle with salmon and asparagus, it was delicious, the fresh pasta was great!&nbsp; Highly recommend the Bruschetta for an appetizer, it was deliciously juicy without soaking the bread. I&#039;d stay away from the steak frites though, that&#039;s what my husband had, and it just wasn&#039;t up to par with everything else....Enjoy!

				<br />sorry to say, I believe your praise for one diner is still too generous.<br /><br />Give them tries, but I think we all find favorite diners. Threads aplenty.<br />Please let us know if you find some of the more Greek standouts.<br />

				Re: diners - fair to say but the thing about diners is that you don&#039;t really go out of your way to eat at them.&nbsp; For the most part, they serve standard fair executed &quot;standardly.&quot;&nbsp; I can&#039;t really think of a diner that&#039;s a destination eatery, they&#039;re more like places you go to grab a quick bite to get full.&nbsp; Hopefully the food is decent and cheap.&nbsp; There&#039;s no wow factor and the guys at the kitchen are more cooks than chefs.&nbsp; That being the case, I don&#039;t travel outside of my neighborhood for a special occasion to eat at a diner.<br /><br />Typically, at a diner I expect a well-prepared egg dish and some fluffy pancakes, etc., so I&#039;m not asking for too much.&nbsp; I&#039;ll occasionally stray off the breakfast menu for something adventurous, but I typically get regret doing so.<br /><br />In my post, I&#039;m simply recommending the places, meaning that you won&#039;t lose by eating there.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t say it was the best by a long shot.<br /><br />More places to add to my recommended list:<br /><br />Cafe Soleil - excellent coffee, amazing almond croissant, cheap, haven&#039;t tried much else<br />Halal Sandwich Shop - very generic name on an orange awning/sign, fresh meats grilled on sandwiches with a mediterranean &quot;caponata&quot; relish, moderate price, mediocre portions, pretty decent overall<br />Tierras Colombianas - simple ethnic, rustic, honest food that&#039;s tasty, large portions, moderate prices, meat can be dry sometimes, a fun experience<br /><br />The one observation I will make is that of all the Greek places I&#039;ve tried, they&#039;ve all had very lackluster lamb dishes.&nbsp; It&#039;s very funny to me that Greeks in Astoria can&#039;t seem to cook their national staple food.&nbsp; Very disappointed with lamb dishes in Astoria in general.<br /><br />The other incredibly obvious observation I&#039;ll make is that Indian in Jackson Heights is much better as is Chinese in Flushing.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure why those two ethnic minorities haven&#039;t made more of an effort to open restaurants in this location.

				I don&#039;t think I have had a bad meal at Trattoria L&#039;incontro, but it can get expensive.<br />Rosario has good sanwiches<br />Andrew and Frank&#039;s is good for lunch<br />The Family Corner is great when you don&#039;t want to cook, and they have the most meat packed gyro I have seen<br />The spinach pie at Mezzo is one of the best that I have had<br />Mojave has great food too<br /><br />Sorry if I barely left the corner of 31st and Ditmars, but I live around the corner so these are <em>too</em> easy for me to get to.

				Mezzo is an interesting pick.&nbsp; I can&#039;t wholeheartedly recommend it although I&#039;ve had some decent dishes there.<br /><br />The first time we went, we ordered the mixed grill meats platter, which consisted of tons of grilled meat varieties and potatoes.&nbsp; We also ordered the seafood pasta and a cold mezze platter.&nbsp; The pasta was superb, the meats were delicious if not a little heavy, and the dips were good too.<br /><br />The second time we went, we ordered the fried calamari and seafood pasta.&nbsp; The calamari was greasy and had no seasoning.&nbsp; The seafood pasta was atrocious, the seafood was completely overcooked and shriveled, and the pasta was mushy.&nbsp; I looked at my neighbor&#039;s lamb dishes.&nbsp; The lamb chops they ordered for nearly $30 an entree were overcooked, dry, and were tiny portions.&nbsp; I was sorely disappointed and if I were them, I&#039;d be pissed.<br /><br />After the first time I ate there, I&#039;d say I&#039;d recommend it.&nbsp; After the second time, I&#039;d say I&#039;d never go back.&nbsp; If anything, it&#039;s wildly inconsistent.

				Well, it&#039;s obvious that Les Minots Bistro is recommending themselves.&nbsp; I can&#039;t endorse that recommendation obviously.<br /><br />However, I can recommend Seva, the indian restaurant on 30th Ave and 33rd(ish) St.&nbsp; It is good and not greasy.&nbsp; Very delighted.&nbsp; It&#039;s 5 cuts above Ghandi Cafe (which sucks really bad).

				Love Seva.&nbsp; I need to return.<br /><br />My favorites are: Il Bambino, Vesta, Akti, Wave Thai, Sparrow, Sandwich King, and I&#039;m a big fan of the San Antonio Bakery #2, for their <em>completa</em> (hot dog) and <em>lomito</em> sandwich (pork)
