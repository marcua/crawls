				I&#039;m so sorry for your loss. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m not aware of any Astoria-based rescues, but here are some other options. <br /><br /><br />Heavenly Angels Animal Rescue (http://www.petfinder.com/shelters/harescue.html) is based in Ozone Park<br /><br /><br />Bobbi and the Strays (http://www.bobbiandthestrays.org/) is also located in Queens<br /><br /><br />You can visit Petfinder.com (http://www.petfinder.com/pet-search?animal_type=Cat&amp;pet_breed=&amp;location=astoria%2C+ny&amp;startsearch=Go) to see photos/info of cats that are currently available in many city shelters. In my experience, most shelters only take the time to post photos of adult cats since kittens get adopted out so quickly. <br /><br /><br />This website has a calendar (http://www.animalalliancenyc.org/events/adoption.htm) of upcoming adoption events around New York. <br /><br /><br />I hope that helps!

				I&#039;m sorry for your loss.&nbsp; We recently went through something similar and it wasn&#039;t much fun - especially because she left her littermate/best friend behind.&nbsp; We got them through KittyKind at the Petco in Union Square and had a good experience with that organization<br /><br />A couple of suggestions for a new furry friend:&nbsp; Jumping Bulldog just did an adopt-a-thon (I believe yesterday) in partnership with the Mayor&#039;s Alliance.&nbsp; You might check in with them for local recommendations.<br /><br />Also, we just got our little guy a playmate (a 15 month old ball of energy) and actually got her through our Vet, Dr. Hatzi at All Pets.&nbsp; One of the vet techs there helps adopt out cats and this one was a perfect match for us on the first try (I know, a rarity).&nbsp; If you have a local vet it might not hurt to give them a call as I&#039;m sure they would know if someone is trying to home some cats/kittens.<br />Lastly, if you don&#039;t mind taking the train I&#039;ve heard that the North Shore Animal League is really great for adoptions and is a short walk from the LIRR.<br /><br />Good luck!

				When our older cat passed away, we donated his cat tree &amp; other stuff to this organization right here in Astoria.&nbsp; They were very kind &amp; appreciative and it&#039;s located in a home on the corner of 23rd ave &amp; 23rd street.&nbsp; They adopt out cats too and are on petfinder.com.&nbsp; When we got a new cat, we actually found him in a foster home on petfinder.com.&nbsp; Condolences on your loss and cheers to you for looking to bring a new little one into your home.&nbsp; <br /><br /><em><strong>Franciss Friends Inc</strong> <br />25-02 23rd Ave. <br />&nbsp;Astoria, NY 11105 <br />Phone: 347-393-3649<br />&nbsp;Email: Click here for a list of pets at this shelter (http://www.petfinder.com/pet-search?shelterid=NY302)</em><br /><br />

				I&#039;m so sorry for your loss.&nbsp; I do volunteer work with a rescue organization called Anjellicle Cat Rescue, http://www.anjelliclecats.com/ (http://www.anjelliclecats.com/) and they are excellent.&nbsp; Right now, we have a lot of kittens and cats for adoption.&nbsp; I live on Ditamars &amp; 35th St. and I am fostering 3 kittens and their one year old mom.&nbsp; They will all be ready for adoption about July 7 (they have to stay with their mother until they are 8 wks. old).&nbsp; <br /><br />Here is an album of 36 photos of the mom and 3 kittens https://www.facebook.com/home.php#!/media/set/?set=a.10151003703590240.474157.616870239&amp;type=1 (https://www.facebook.com/home.php#!/media/set/?set=a.10151003703590240.474157.616870239&amp;type=1)<br />&nbsp;<br />Let me know if you are interested in looking at them or take a look on Anjellicle&#039;s website for more kittens/cats ready for adoption.<br />&nbsp;<br />Renee

				Thank you all so much. I&#039;m still thinking about it. I know it&#039;s irrational but I feel like I&#039;d be betraying kitty but getting another one so soon...I am truly broken...thanks again.

				I totally understand. Losing a pet is like losing a family member. It&#039;s not like replacing a pair of shoes. <br /><br /><br />Take some time to accept and grieve for your loss. You need that. When my dog of 14 years passed away<br />a few years ago, it really took me a few months to accept it and move on. So don&#039;t feel you have to get <br />another cat right away. But at least now you have some good information to work with when and if you<br />decide to take that step. <br /><br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br />

My dog of 14 years passed away last spring and it took some for me to feel comfortable with the idea of a new dog. I still miss him, but adopting my pup was the best thing I could have done. She really helped me heal. Best of luck with everything.
