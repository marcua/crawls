Leahy (D-Vt.), who endorsed Obama last week, castigated the former president for what he called his &quot;glib cheap shots&quot; at Obama, saying both sides should settle down but placing the blame predominantly on Clinton.<br /><br />&quot;That&#039;s beneath the dignity of a <strong>former president</strong>,&quot; Leahy told reporters, adding: &quot;He is not helping anyone, and certainly not helping the Democratic Party.&quot;<br /><br />That concern was also voiced by some neutral Democrats, who said that the former president&#039;s aggressive role, along with the couple&#039;s harsh approach recently, threatens to divide the party in the general election. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Beneath the dignity? Havent we been down these roads many times before.<br />Why should better be expected of Bill after the 90s experience?<br /><br />Someone who does not understand the words Oath, Truth, Is would not understand Dignity. That&#039;s your choice.<br /><br />I hope we can find better voices of leadership in 08.<br /><br />

The Clintons are &quot;high minded&quot; on the surface but &quot;smarmily duplicitous underneath, meanwhile jabbing hard at the groin area. They are a slippery pair and come as a package.

				I didn&#039;t mind the 8 Clinton years, though I didn&#039;t like everything they did, but these eight years of the Shrub have been horribly long.&nbsp; I wonder if the next President has a harder re-elect - after two Presidents who got re-elected.&nbsp; I guess it will depend on the political environment and the economy.&nbsp;
