				Hi guys,<br /><br />For those of you that are addicts I need to know something.<br /><br />Occasionally while I&#39;m surfing the board I get &quot;timeouts&quot; where the site stops responding for about 30 seconds, but it can be as long as about 2 minutes. Whenever I try and reload the page I get nothing. It happens pretty frequently.<br /><br />Does this happen to anyone else on a regular basis? I&#39;m trying to troubleshoot if this is a server thing, or something with my computer or ISP.

				I do get them sometimes, and it seems to be more frequent lately, but the internet seems to be slower in general, particularly at home (although also a little slow at work).&nbsp; It has seemed slower, with more timeouts, for several weeks now.

				Yes, I see this from time to time too. I&#39;m not sure, but it may only happen at work, which would be interesting, as I use OpenDNS at home, but the usual DNS channels at work. I wonder if there&#39;s a transient name service issue?<br />

				I also should add that while I don&#39;t have the problem -- I also don&#39;t generally browse the site for very long.&nbsp; Often, yes, but not long.&nbsp; I skim through the new posts that interest me and move off to do other things.&nbsp; Probably on astorians for &gt; 15 minutes each time I hit it.<br /><br />I may not be staying around long enough for a timeout.

				It happens to me a lot, usually at least once a day.&nbsp; But like others said, it usually doesn&#39;t last that long.&nbsp; It may have more to do with the computer/internet access dealie I&#39;m on than with Astorians.

				This is all great information. It&#39;s leading me to believe it&#39;s not just a problem with my own laptop or even internet connection, but something strange with the server itself.<br /><br />Get this though - I&#39;ve had it where I will get a timeout from the site, whereas my wife on her computer (at the same moment) is able to browse the site just fine. The site will be non responsive to me for 30 seconds (unable to load a page) while she browses away no problem. (?!)<br /><br />Interestingly, during the timeouts I can still ping the server just fine and it responds.

				I&#039;m going to take the site down for 20 minutes sometime in the next couple hours here to see if we can figure out where this problem is coming from. Don&#039;t freak out if it goes down for a little bit :)
