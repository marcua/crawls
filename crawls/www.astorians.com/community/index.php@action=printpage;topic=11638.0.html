				Ok, I live about 2 blocks from it and I still have no clue just what type of club it is.&#160; Does anyone here know what they are and has anyone been there yet.&#160; I thought they were a strip club but I see a lot of women on line to get in and some look underage so I tend to wonder if it is just a dance club. I am too chicken Sh*t to go in and check it out and if it is a strip club, the wife won&#039;t be happy :)

				It&#039;s a strip club aka gentleman&#039;s club. No idea about the woman standing on line, unless they work there or are, ummm, interviewing... :|<br /><br />They may also have some special non strip nights.&#160; They have done that in the past.

				so, if there is no nudity, then it isn&#039;t a strip club.&nbsp; Now I am really confused.

				Of course...I heard other things, but I am really talking TOO much now. <br /><br />&nbsp;:wink:<br /><br />I know the bouncer and a bar tender that work there. It&#039;s a friendly vibe for you to hang out with the fellas and ladies. I&#039;ve been there with a lot of females, believe it or not - a lot of girls do go in there to hang out - you&#039;d be surprised. <br /><br />Not every strip club is about grinding lap dances from dancers. Most people usually just go after work for a drink and to relax around women rather than sit in a depressed bar, etc.

				Well I just got off the phone with one of the bar tenders who worked there. I haven&#039;t spoken to her in a long time anyway...she told me it&#039;s a nude strip club now. <br /><br />Now I really want to go hahaha LMAO. I&#039;m going on Tues. <br /><br />And no I&#039;m not married nor have a relationship at hand. I&#039;m being realistic and 100% modest! Me and the gang actually used to go there and sit down have a few drinks - chat it up while dancers would do what they do. We were regular patrons though so it wasn&#039;t like a first time thing.
