				What do you mean?&nbsp; There are both a CVS and a Rite-Aid at that corner.&nbsp; Personally, I like the Rite Aid better because they stock much more stuff and brands, but the CVS has that nice rewards card.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if the Rite-Aid changes hands yet again though.&nbsp; It seems to do that regularly.

				I&#039;m wondering if maybe CVS is coming to 30th Avenue &amp; 31st Street. We have 2 Rite Aids there - <br />one is the old Genovese between 31st &amp; 32nd Streets. The other one is across the street, between 33rd &amp; 34th Streets <br />was the original Rite Aid in our area and is much larger.<br /><br />Would make sense for the smaller one to become a CVS if they want another location. <br />I haven&#039;t heard anything, but people in my area have wondered how long Rite Aid would continue<br />running the two shops so close to each other.<br /><br />Then again, Chase has two branches almost opposite each other at 31st &amp; Ditmars...<br />

				To get back on topic, I haven&#039;t heard any rumors of CVS taking over Rite Aid.<br /><br />As mentioned with Chase, having two CVS&#039; located directly across the street from each other would seem like a wasteful move.&nbsp; Even if CVS was to overtake Rite Aid, it be a better move to simply close/sell the Rite Aid location.<br /><br />I&#039;d love to see either of these (CVS or Rite Aid) get replaced with a nice Duane Reade.&nbsp; I like their rewards program better.

				Someone with pretty good knowledge of the situation told me today that CVS is indeed taking over the Rite-Aid spot AND the florist on the corner,most likely at the end of the month.They are also closing the Rite-Aid on Steinway and 31st Avenue.<br /><br />No word on what&#039;s being done with that spot or the spot CVS is in now.

				I filled a prescription at Rite Aide and they informed me that as of Jan 22 they will be closing. CVS will be taking over their prescriptions. I do not know if this means they will be moving into that spot but Rite Aide is definitely leaving

				I&#039;m surprised Rite Aid is leaving that spot.&nbsp; They were 24 hours long before CVS was, and the only 24 hour place for miles around.&nbsp; Big selection of everything we need, near major subway <em>and</em> bus stops.&nbsp; Across from a 24 hour Dunkin Donuts - there are lots of reasons a store like that would want to <em>open</em> in the location.

I worked in the pharmacy of another of their stores when I was a freshman in college and went to help out at that store when they were short handed. Then Genovese was bought out by Eckerd, Eckerd was bought out by Rite Aid, and now CVS is taking over the spot from them. <br /><br />I&#039;m still amazed the two Rite Aids are open across from each other on 30th Avenue -- the original Genovese store #1 on the south side between 31st and 32nd Streets, and the one on the corner of 33rd (which, back in the day, was where Key Food was, A&amp;P was where Key Food is now, and IIRC, at one point, Genovese was where Key Food is now -- there was a lot of movement on those corners).

				wow, the end of an era.&nbsp; Mario has been the manager of since it was genovese, he&#039;s gonna be heartbroken.&nbsp; surprised to see they are also getting the spot where the flower shop is, only thing left for them to occupy is the hair salon on 31st and then they have the whole bottom floor of that building.&nbsp; heres a pic that i use as my desktop from when it was woolworth and genovese.<br /><br />(http://i47.tinypic.com/j66345.jpg)

				Well, as long as it means the selection will stay pretty good now that it will be CVS, I really don&#039;t care which drugstore it is.&nbsp; The current CVS is so small and doesn&#039;t stock much of a choice of anything, especially cleaning products.&nbsp; And recently, both drugstores had not one box of Combats!&nbsp; &nbsp;It didn&#039;t look like either one even stocked them.

				I want to time travel and go back to Woolworth.&nbsp; Also to old Walgreens, with ice cream parlors... ahh, nostalgia.<br /><br />I would also like to time travel back to when stores/distributers kept things <em>in stock</em>.&nbsp; As Daisy points out, you need one little thing and simultaneously nobody has it.&nbsp; (Grocery stores often charge more for Combat, but try them anyway.)<br /><br />As for the Rite Aid on Ditmars, I forget what I was looking for, but they only had 3 containers left, all out of date.&nbsp; Some time later they made the news in the tri-state are for this being routine for them.&nbsp; And then made the news again for <em>still</em> having out of date things.&nbsp; <br /><br />I hope the flower shop has someplace else to go.

				HMMMM?<br /><br />CVS also does compounding :]<br />The great/sad fact is that we averaged 400 prescriptions on a busy day, and now with Rite Aid gone, we fill 600 on a busy day, so if you need something compounded, just give us an hours notice! Smaller places like Crown do like...150 on a very busy day, so if you dont want to wait, they&#039;re a great pick.<br /><br />In about 2-3 months time CVS will move from its current location and take over the Rite Aid across the street, along with the flower shop, so we will me MASSIVE.<br /><br />Originally we had a tiny pharmacy, but now with the space, we will be the best stocked place in Astoria.<br /><br />Also, we the CVS bought out all of Rite Aids scripts, so we do have all your information at our location. Keep in mind this is only between the CVS and Rite Aid on ditmars!

				bstewart, you may enjoy this New York Times article about this sort of thing: http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/09/business/09privacy.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=2<br /><br />Particularly this part from the second page:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">SOME people think that the stimulus law doesn’t go far enough to protect patients’ privacy. While it bans paying a pharmacist for marketing to patients, it does not bar the sale of personal drug information by one pharmacy to another, as happened to Randee Lonergan, 35, a school administrator who now lives in Florida.<br /><br />She says that when a pharmacy closed in a Stop &amp; Shop supermarket on Long Island, it sold her information to a nearby Target store. She was upset when her new pharmacist asked if she was still taking injections for a skin problem. “They knew all about me and my family,” she said. Adding to her chagrin, she saw a person she happened to know working at the pharmacy. A Target spokeswoman says the company complied with all privacy laws.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m sure a lot of people see it as a convenience so they don&#039;t have to worry about getting their records from one place to another, but it would be best to have an option about where those records go.<br /><br />As for that Rite Aid, it was always kind of dirty seeming when I lived up there. Hopefully the CVS will be cleaner and replace all the gross mildewy carpets if they haven&#039;t been replaced already. The Rite Aid on Steinway/31st Ave just closed also. I guess they decided that having 234209 stores in Astoria was a little much.

				True, in my cases there is a fine line between selling people&#039;s personal information. I think however, in this case it was a smarter step. Like essen said, most people see it as being pretty convenient.<br /><br />In an ideal world everyone would be able to choose where they would want their prescriptions transferred to, but the transfer of one medication alone could take 10minutes, and its also by New York state law, that once you do a transfer you lose the remaining refills, if you had any. Of course with places like Rite Aid and CVS there is a central search so refills aren&#039;t lost.<br /><br />As for the lady complaining about the Target pharmacy knowing her history, I believe she&#039;s got it all wrong. First of all; a pharmacist&#039;s knowing your medical history is very assuring. He/she knows what you&#039;ve been through, what is and is not good for you,how to give recommendations, and how to make sure your health and life is kept in capable hands. Secondly there are privacy laws so what is said between the patient and pharmacy staff, is purely confidential. Trust me, we rather keep our mouths shut than be sued.<br /><br />Back to Rite Aid, dear lord was it a mess. I&#039;m surprised it lasted like that as long as it did. And if ONLY they had decided that having 23123 stores in Astoria was much, lol. They had actually lost their lease. Just could not pay for it. Bye bye.

				I do like CVS, but the store is super small and just can&#039;t stock much choice of well, anything.&nbsp; Especially household and cleaning products.&nbsp; I am hopeful that they will take the time to thoroughly clean out the old RiteAid, including ripping out the rugs and fixing the floor.&nbsp; I overheard some people talking about how it&#039;s uneven in some places and was never cleaned and fixed properly from when it was a Walbaums with a food counter.&nbsp; The area was terribly dirty and ruined the floor and it was never fixed.&nbsp; That&#039;s why the floor is so nasty.<br /><br />But I did choose to shop at Rite Aid often over CVS because the lines were often better, and they stocked many more choices of cleaning products.&nbsp; And please, can one of you start stocking Combats?&nbsp; I mean, really, a drugstore in a huge city like this ought to sell them.&nbsp; Rite Aid did, but only for ants.&nbsp; Ants??&nbsp; Hello, it&#039;s winter.&nbsp; Roaches come inside in winter.&nbsp; Not ants.&nbsp; CVS had nothing.&nbsp; Not even a can of RAID when I went.&nbsp; It was so weird.&nbsp; I don&#039;t get it.<br /><br />They are a nice store though with a good staff and I think the move will be good for them.&nbsp; I wonder who will take their space?&nbsp;

				Clueless, no doubt it is convenient. I just question Rite-Aid&#039;s right to sell their customers&#039; information. It appears that their pharmacy respects people&#039;s privacy until there is money to be made.<br /><br />Personally, I have no dog in the race here. I remarked because it surprises me that some medical information is guarded so closely, (for example, call a hospital to inquire after a patient&#039;s condition,) but this stuff is a commodity to be sold by some whackdoodle company.

				To daisy: Yeah it is smaller than the old Rite Aid, and the pharmacy was HALF the size of Rite Aid&#039;s, so the move will be good. In 2-3 months when we will move, and slowly phase out the current CVS. So I&#039;m assuming for a month or so we will have two CVS&#039;S up, which is ridiculous. I wish I could tell you why we dont have combat, lol, but I dont work the front store.<br /><br />To hayleyree: Yeah, its odd. New York has a crazy amount of laws. So when transfering between different pharmacies you lose your refills. However before a transfer is done, someone in the staff SHOULD warn you of this, because we hate doing transfers :D<br /><br />To bstewart: Corporate sucks eh.

				Yes CVS is taking over the whole corner.<br /><br />About it becoming a Walgreens? I haven&#039;t heard that, and I dont think anyone is sure yet of what it will be.<br /><br />Secondly, we JUST got a new store manager, I have not heard of anyone else, but the current manager, taking over the CVS across the street. There are a bunch of managers, about...5...right now...but only one head mananger. Plus, staff isn&#039;t changing, we&#039;re just adding people on as the months go by.

				To C-J: LOL! Yes so true. One reason is...we&#039;re understaffed &gt;.&gt;?<br /><br />Second reason is...all you people get off the train/bus at the same time. So after the front store people finish a line of 15+ people, an N train stops and 200 people get off, 1/3 of them go to CVS and the whole chain effect continues :] Its like one of my pharma&#039;s says, &quot; its not our fault everyone gets off the bus at the same time, s___&quot;<br /><br />Third, we&#039;ve always been pretty busy, but now with Rite Aid gone, our staff, and size of store in general, just can&#039;t handle so many people.

				Just to add one of my faves.

Even though if she had open the actual email, she would have learned that the 10% off was for an online purchase only. A concept that seemed to elude her. That call took ten minutes of my time.

				All I have to say is please SEPARATE the register lines at the CVS! Having one line makes the line snake through the store and people don&#039;t actually MOVE forward when the line moves. This has aggravated me to the point of not going to CVS any more unless it&#039;s really late. Also I hope get some self-checkout lines in the new store.

The Southeast corner opposite Woolworth&#039;s housed a store called Famous Fashion which was a very popular women&#039;s clothing shop.<br /><br />The whole shopping area of 31st from 23rd Ave to Ditmars Ave. was referred to as &quot;Ditmars&quot; in addition to those stores actually on the avenue.<br />&nbsp;<br />My Mom worked at the Woolworth&#039;s and it is where she met my Father. <br />

I&#039;ve gotten great prices on things like band-aids and Nyquil at Astor Pharmacy on Ditmars and 35th Street. I seem to remember Crown Chemists having good prices too. And I recommend Trade Fair for things like dish detergent and toilet paper. And Bed Bath &amp; Beyond for razors and hair dye (actually BB&amp;B is really cheap for most stuff).

				I work near the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond at 18th &amp; 6th and get all of my toiletries there much cheaper. Everything I use<br />is 3 to 4 dollars cheaper there. They also accept manufacturer&#039;s coupons in addition to their own. <br /><br />The last two times I was there I had their one of their $5 coupons in addition to my own manufacturer ones and saved<br />$17 on one purchase and $18 on another. And they&#039;re very polite there - if you don&#039;t see something on a shelf or think a <br />price is wrong, they&#039;re very nice about checking on it. No attitude at all.<br /><br />And I have yet to have something scan incorrectly at the register.

				Does any know when CVS (31st and Ditmars) will be moving to the old Rite-Aid location? Also, what will be opening in that location when CVS moves? Hopefully not another bank or salon...

				I hope that if they move into the Rite Aid space they hire more cashiers b/c it seems every time I go in there the line is down an entire aisle. I used to go out of my way to go there (I was always partial to CVS for some reason) but now even if I&#039;m in the area, I&#039;ll go out of my way to avoid that store. Even at 11pm on a weeknight it&#039;s crowded!

				Back in the late Winter/early Spring I asked one of the pharmacists and she said they were planning to move into the RiteAid location this Summer. Kinda doubtful about that now. I haven&#039;t seen them do much other than rip up the carpet and do asbestos abatement (which, granted, has to be a bear).<br /><br />SplishSplash is right, there never seems to be a good time to go there. Even midday in the middle of the week is a zoo!

				Yeah, ever since Rite Aid closed, it&#039;s been seriously awful at CVS.&nbsp; I&#039;ve noticed they have added more cashiers though, and are trying to control the lines better.&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait until they move.&nbsp; The stock there is so lacking, I&#039;ve taking to shopping elsewhere when I can.

				I heard (can&#039;t remember when but it&#039;s from one of the staff there) that they will open up the rite aid location in October and keep their now location. Hopefully it&#039;s true :lol:

My son needed Prevacid at an early age (3 months) but it had to be a compound, and they were the only place around that did it. They are quick on the refills, and very friendly.

				Shout-out for the local guys: G&amp;G on the corner of 23rd Ave./31st St. has been very helpful. <br /><br />I get my iron Rx sent through the mail from Mil-Rue in Ridgewood. Because it&#039;s a &quot;nutritional&quot; supplement (despite the Rx for anemia), my insurance doesn&#039;t cover it. So RiteAid was charging $80/month, which steadily increased to $112/month after a short while. Found Mil-Rue, where I get the same Rx for $20/month. No parking in Ridgewood, so I have arrangements to have them send it for an add&#039;l $3.&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />
