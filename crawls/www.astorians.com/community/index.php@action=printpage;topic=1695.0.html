				I agree with Harlan. Sad but true. Even I make better fried rice than the ghetto shacks on Broadway, for instance, and I&#39;m a non-practicing-chinesegirl. Major problem? No real sit-downs, lets start there. Its all take-out crap shacks. Someone please correct me if I&#39;m wrong!! If you&#39;re willing to go to the sino-american haven of Flushing, however, I&#39;ve got a lotta recommendations!<br />good luck<br />a

				Yaaaay thats a real adventure... I&#39;ve only gone a few times but with my grandmother (old skool chinese lady, yo) and then with my parents (newer skool but grew up in Taiwan) and we&#39;ve found some really great places. You can&#39;t go wrong with the fried food windows that are right in front of the LIRR station on Main St. as you come up from the subway station: good place to start for scallion pancakes, fried dumplings, and of course the hot soy milk drink.. all to go, eat while you walk, naturally! <br /><br />Then I would recommend walking up Main Street, toward the big ol&#39; Queens Public Library to this place called &quot;East&quot; for dim sum or BUFFET if you&#39;re brave (theres a lot there and I think it might be kinda expensive). Its a westernized ambiance (so skittish white people wont be scared by what must be the de rigeur scuzzy chinese restaurant) but yet the food is really good. A bit pricier but good for impressing that hot Chinese dissident you&#39;ve got your eye on.<br /><br />But if you&#39;re not up for a buffet/sit down nicer place, there&#39;s a great &quot;food court&quot; like place thats gloriously dingy and closer to the station on Main... there&#39;s a man in the back who hand throws and then cuts noodles and cooks them fresh for you in like 2 minutes, tops it with traditional stuff like roasted <strong>pork</strong> and scallions, veggies, etc. Its an amazing sight. Better than watching pizza tossers, in my humble opinion.<br /><br />Yay! let me know when you want to make an afternoon excursion to the end of the 7 line, I&#39;d love to go (when the weather warms up, of course)<br /><br />-a <br />

				I completely concur!!!!! I mean, I love my eggs benedict, but c&#39;mon its PORK BUNS for brunch!! Ok so lets go to dim sum sometime!! Jonathan, whats your favorite place? FOr Chinatown I really like Golden Unicorn near Catherine and Broadway because its a little off the beaten bath (beaten path = Mott or Elizabeth Streets) and because its pretty fresh (the carts can get old) but they dont have the pork buns if you go anytime after noon (they run out and then pretend like they dont know how to make any more)... But Jing Fong on Elizabeth really is very good IF you can wait for like six hours in their lame lobby with a teenage hostess that can&#39;t keep track of numbers higher than 3... yummy veggies there! <br />DIM SUM!

				My favorite standard place is harmony palace on mott just north of canal street. Im friends with one of the managers there and he takes good care of me and introduces me to new dishes.&nbsp; he is currently showing off his new chef from shanghai (or so he claims).<br /><br />Love Jing fong just get there eary. this is probably the best in food, cleanliness and overall taste, plus there are stations you can walk up to as well.<br /><br />Trimple eight under the manhattan bridge anchor (east bway?) is probably equal to or just behind jing fong in my opinion.<br /><br />Now i have to disagree on the pork dumplings and here is my reason.&nbsp; If you eat a pork bun you get full and cant eat all the dumplings, beef tendons, chicken feet and occasional sticky rice stuffed with sausage.&nbsp; Ill save the pork buns for just walking around chinatown. and whats more important than shark fin dumplings, har gow and shu mei?&nbsp; well except beef tendons that is.&nbsp; damn you annie, now im hungry.&nbsp; <br /><br />By the way, friend at harmony introduced me to crysanthymum / black tea mix which beats the crap out of the regular stuff on the tables.

				AAH it&#39;s been 21 years since I&#39;ve had <em>proper</em> dim sum and I want more.&nbsp; (I have had two wonderful vegetarian dim sum feasts since then, but that&#39;s not the same thing.)<br /><br />I for one am very curious WHY there&#39;s no good Chinese food in Astoria, when there&#39;s nearly every other kind of ethnic cuisine imaginable (well, except Ethiopian, and Vietnamese, and Eastern European Jewish deli, and...OK, never mind).

				My favorite dim sum restaurant is Jing Fong (formerly Cam Fung in Cantonese) on Elizabeth Street and, you betcha, I get there no later than 11A on a Sunday!&nbsp; In fact, I&#39;m meeting a bunch of friends there this coming Sunday in case anyone is headed out there this weekend!

				Sorry I will have to discourage anyone from ever eating at Dragon Gate! I ate there last year and i got food poisoning from it. Go to Flushing- or Chinatown- D&#39;oh! Unfortunately I don&#39;t have good recommendations either- and i prefer to cook my own chinese anyways.. But if you need a great Japanese place i know of one or two on Ditmars.. Try Kumo-- their sushi platters rock! and Watawa isnt bad either....
