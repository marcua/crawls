				I wasn&#039;t there, but my guess would be that Astoria Park was hosting the Relay for Life (http://www.relayforlife.org/relay/) this weekend, and that&#039;d be the source of the noise. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t done it in Astoria, but I&#039;ve done it in numerous places on Long Island, and it&#039;s a wonderful event, but yeah, since it&#039;s all night, it can get loud at times.

				Um, can we ask how far from the park you are and how loud it was in terms of other outside noises?<br /><br />There&#039;s a certain level that&#039;s loud and can be annoying, but isn&#039;t a &quot;never donate to them again&quot; loud. And then there&#039;s loud and illegal. Which, if it was that loud, why didn&#039;t you call 311 and complain?

				Let me just say this, in terms of how loud the music was. The event took place on the running track. The DJ booth was set up by the entrance, which is located by the restrooms. At about 7pm, when we were making our lap, when we reached the other end of the track (by the shore), the song was hard to hear!! The people camped at that end of the track were struggling to even hear when someone was speaking on the microphone. <br />&nbsp;

				Again, I wasn&#039;t at this particular event, but I have attended numerous other Relay for Life events, and I&#039;ll say this: the organizers are always in touch with local police about the event.&nbsp; They usually are granted a &quot;noise ordinance abatement&quot; or something that allows them to keep the volume levels high until a certain time -- at the events I&#039;ve attended, the curfew was 11 PM.<br /><br />Do people make noise after 11?&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; The Relay for Life event is about walking the track for the entire night.&nbsp; But usually this noise is independent from the actual event organizers.&nbsp; I&#039;d bet that it wasn&#039;t the Relay for Life official organizers who were proclaiming their love for Queen at 3 AM, but some of the attendees (my guess is they were trying to keep morale up after a very long day).<br /><br />However, I wasn&#039;t there.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know for sure.&nbsp; I can only base it on the other events I&#039;ve attended.&nbsp; And if you weren&#039;t there either, then you also don&#039;t know, and probably should think before bashing the entire charity based on this.

				No excuses, its a residential area.&nbsp; Their permit would not have allowed them to play amplified music in a park after 11.<br /><br />also these sorts of marathons to raise money are ridiculous, just right a check to these organizations and be done with it.&nbsp; I mean if they stopped &quot;relaying&quot; at 11 will they not find a cure for cancer? <br /><br />and i had two family members die from cancer last summer so base don the rules of this thread i am allowed to criticize an organization that is being rude to the community.

				A little un-related, but not really:<br /><br />Every year, I fundraise and participate in the MS Walk NYC to support my mom who was diagnosed 10 years ago.&nbsp; For the past two years, the walk route (we go 10 miles) took us over the Brooklyn Bridge, through Brooklyn Heights, and back over into Manhattan.&nbsp; Thousands of people participate and the pedestrian walkway on the bridge is not closed, marked, or roped off in any different way than it normally is.&nbsp; <br /><br />For the past 2 years, several asswipe bikers yelled at us as they rode by for taking up &quot;their lane&quot; on the bridge while they passed.&nbsp; For the past 2 years, someone in my team has yelled back some choice words to them, something along the lines of we&#039;re so sorry to be walking 10 miles and taking up their precious bike lane - for ONE Sunday - in support of those who can barely move due to the crippling, painful illness.<br /><br />All of this reminds me of that...just a little.&nbsp; Count your blessings and pick your battles, people!

				Maybe they ought to rope the walk way off then, or make announcements.<br /><br />If there&#039;s no marking and you&#039;re walking in the bike lane, you are in their lane and you shouldn&#039;t be upset with them for wanting the space that is supposed to be reserved for them.

				I don&#039;t disagree with you - I filled out a post-walk survey that recommended marking off the route or hiring people to make sure people didn&#039;t filter over into their specified lane.&nbsp; Even better, post signs at the beginning of each entrance onto the bridge notifying bikers of the situation.<br /><br />However,&nbsp; managing thousands of people trying to walk over a very narrow path on a pedestrian bridge is difficult no matter how you look at it.&nbsp; All things considered, the people on bikes could have been a little nicer to us, or even avoided the bridge at all costs that morning.&nbsp; In my opinion, they can deal with it for one morning.

Or blocks and blocks of streets shut down for hours, preventing people who can&#039;t walk or bike to their destinations from going where they need to go. &nbsp;And to boot, they think they are entitled and then give local residents an attitude. &nbsp;I cheer the bikers who got mad their lane was blocked. &nbsp;And I can&#039;t even believe I&#039;m saying that!

				I agree with TJT and think that there&#039;s a balance that&#039;s being missed here.<br /><br />The residents think any little smidgen of whatever that bothers them should be changed because, gosh darn, they live here!<br /><br />The walkers/rally people think that people who live there should shut up and deal because, gosh darn, it&#039;s a good cause!<br /><br />Well, maybe the thing is that residents need to be a little lenient about noise and people hosting events need to be more considerate with the residents. By doing things like putting up flyers and notifying the residential community of the event and who they can contact if there are any questions, concerns or problems. If a movie crew shoots on my street (which has happened) they&#039;ve always notified us and attempted to do anything they could to make it more convienient and easy for those in the &#039;hood. Why can&#039;t charities or other events try to do similar things?

				On a slight related note, this year, I received a record number of requests to donate to various causes, all involving a ride or walk of some sort.&nbsp; I usually support the AIDS walk and did so again this year.&nbsp; I feel bad but I can&#039;t support every walk for every cause.&nbsp; But I&#039;m amazed at the sheer number of such walks/rides there are.&nbsp; I got rid of all the charity donation mail I used to get, but now the requests are coming from all over.

				It was refreshing to hear some good ole music late coming from Astoria Park, it reminded me of back in the day when people knew how to have fun and weren&#039;t so ... uber critical of everything.&nbsp; It&#039;s summer, it was the weekend.&nbsp; Darn I remember back in the day when people would have block parties in the summer and it went on till the weee morning but back then people would come out and have a blast, sure there was always that ONE grumpy person...at least it was just ONE back then.&nbsp; :-P

You should have called 311. It does work, naysayers notwithstanding. You don&#039;t see the results instantaneously though. You take down the incident number that they give you, and then in a few weeks you can follow up on what you called in about. But, like AJTNYC said, posting here just gets us all riled up for no reason. Did you record this loud music? If not then it is useless for us to even continue with this thread.

				It’s gotta be the heat. Three pages of comments and by my count only two people have weighed in with a complaint that they were directly affected by the noise from this event: rendo and panic station.<br /><br />The rest don’t say anything about being disturbed or woken up and instead seem to be solely pissed off at just the idea of this event having taken place in Astoria Park after hours – so much so that the future of cancer research may be at stake :-P<br /><br />This thread gets my vote for the biggest non-issue issue of the week courtesy of…<br /><br />Rendo!<br /><br />Thank you for providing another venue for the venting of people’s outrage.

				i too am kinda shocked at the direction of this thread.<br /><br />unfortunately we live in a society where organizations need to hold events in order to generate interest or funds.&nbsp; as much of an inconvenience as it could be, they&#039;re a necessary &quot;evil&quot; and in the grand scheme of things will usually make more money than simple donations.&nbsp; plus the attention they get is worth more than the money they make (take for example the fact that i had never even heard of this event before people here started talking about it).<br /><br />i could understand the complaints if they were an everyday occurrence, but c&#039;mon people, isn&#039;t nyc is supposed to be the city that never sleeps?!&nbsp; maybe if the music was THAT loud, you should have closed the window and put the a/c on afterall...or put some earplugs in...or put on some of your own music that would have helped you sleep.

				I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s the way some people react to every single inconvienience that they come accross or the projected sense of entitlement they have that pisses everyone off.<br /><br />Then again, I&#039;ve met people that aren&#039;t happy unless everyone around them is miserable as well as they are.<br /><br />I get the feeling that some people would complain about an event for puppy cancer if it inconvienienced them in the slightest.

				This whole argument is just ridiculous. <br /><br />3:30AM loud music is unacceptable in any residential neighborhood. It&#039;s not like the folks are complaining about a loud daytime event, or even one that ran just a little late... it&#039;s 3AM. <br /><br />This is NYC, and inevitably, we have street fairs, charity events, concerts, etc. everywhere, and that&#039;s one of the biggest appeals of this city (in my opinion). I&#039;m fine with all that, but if any one of those events that I love so much started happening outside my window loudly at 3:30AM, I&#039;d be rightfully peeved.&nbsp; <br />

				The original Relay for Life was a stadium event. It has become the &quot;signature&quot; fundraising event for the American Cancer Society. Here is the history from the Relay For Life website:<br /><br /><strong>History of Relay - Celebrating Hope</strong><br /><br />One person can make a difference. Nowhere is that more evident than with the story of the American Cancer Society Relay For Life, which began in Tacoma, Washington. In the mid-1980s, Dr. Gordy Klatt, a Tacoma colorectal surgeon, wanted to enhance the income of his local American Cancer Society office and to show support for all of his patients who had battled cancer. He decided to personally raise money for the fight by doing something he enjoyed – running marathons.<br /><br />In May 1985, Dr. Klatt spent a grueling 24 hours circling the track at Baker Stadium at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma. He ran for more than 83 miles. That first year, nearly 300 of Dr. Klatt&#039;s friends, family, and patients watched as he ran and walked the course. Throughout the night, friends donated $25 to run or walk with Dr. Klatt for 30 minutes. His efforts raised $27,000 to fight cancer.<br /><br />While circling the track those 24 hours, Dr. Klatt thought about how others could take part in his mission to fight cancer. He envisioned a 24-hour team relay event that could raise more money to fight cancer. Over the next few months, he pulled together a small committee to plan the first team relay event, known as the City of Destiny Classic 24-Hour Run Against Cancer.<br /><br />In 1986, with the help of Pat Flynn – now known as the “Mother of Relay” – 19 teams took part in the first team Relay event on the track at the historic Stadium Bowl and raised $33,000. An indescribable spirit prevailed at the track and in the tents that dotted the infield.

				On a serious note, a rather funny one.&nbsp; It just hit me why I had the weird dream Saturday night about playing soccer, and running all over the place and being chased by someone that my b/f dislikes, he was trying to take the soccer ball away from me and the hearing the fans stomping their feet singing we are the champions, it&#039;s because I heard the song in my sleep and incorporated it in my dream.....<br /><br />kooooool.......<br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; The guy that was chasing me in the dream ran right into the goal post head first!

As far as my neighbors having parties, the last time they had a party I went to the new owner of the house and he was very understanding to my needs and he didn&#039;t know about the noise ordinance.

				Heh. Yeah. I haven&#039;t seen or heard a single fight or heard more than a hand full of motorcycles or the like in the nearly two years I&#039;ve been up there. I guess I think it&#039;s weird that a country girl who grew up without any cars driving down the road she lived on can cope with this so well, but that people from the city don&#039;t have an innate noise tolerance.

				The park is a noise magnet during the summer months. I&#039;d never live near it. <br /><br />I think there&#039;s some things that can be agreed on: City noise is what it is - you expect it and deal with it - if you can&#039;t, don&#039;t live here. Unexpected noise of any variety for any reason at 3:30AM is a bit overboard. Directly confronting the problem people is the only way to get a quick result... 311 or even 911 if they&#039;re belligerent about it. I can think of many parties I was at years ago where eventually the cops would show up and tell whoever was in charge to wind things down and not to make them come back... <br /><br />

I also think that the noise issues in the neighborhood get blown out of proportion. Everyone has things that get on their nerves--I hate strollers on the subway and guess what, legally, you&#039;re supposed to fold them up, but I don&#039;t complain to everyone in the subway car after the person with the stroller gets off the train. If I really thought strollers were that terrible of a problem and not just my personal annoyance, I might ask the MTA to do something. If the noises of events in the park are really bad and something needs to be done, call 311 when it&#039;s going on and contact that Parks people this week. Let them know about it.<br /><br />Did anyone else actually hear the music early in the morning? Lots of people here live by the park. Did anyone else hear the music at all during the night? I&#039;m pretty surprised that only one person heard it if it was as bad as it&#039;s being made out to be.<br /><br />I understand that it&#039;s hard to wait for a response. And it sucks to have to sleep through loud noises. I think everyone&#039;s had to do that at least once.<br /><br />But just like with your neighbors having a party or something, this was one weekend night. It sucks, but it&#039;s over. If you want peace of mind, you really need to try to get involved to the point where rules and ordinances will be better enforced in the future, rather than just complaining about what&#039;s already been done.

				The idea of &quot;if you can&#039;t stand the noise don&#039;t live here&quot; is based on a false premise that the city <strong>must</strong> be excessively loud.

You guys are more fun.&nbsp; Plus you have a park (we don&#039;t) and you have lots of restaurants with outdoor seating.&nbsp; Feeling jealous.&nbsp; This thread is like a holiday dinner at my Nana&#039;s house.... minus one cousin who always got slapped!&nbsp; No one got slapped here right?&nbsp; Just lost one nite&#039;s sleep.&nbsp; Waaahhhh, waaahhh... big baby.

				Why do they need music anyway? Couldn&#039;t they just walk quietly? Maybe the walkers would stop if the music weren&#039;t playing, but that would make them really just fair weather participants. <br /><br />BTW does anyone have American Cancer Society numbers for how much of the contributions go to research versus administrative costs?

When it gets that late, having the event is fine but it should be taken into account that it is 3:30AM, T-H-R-E-E-T-H-I-R-T-Y-A-M!

				I think this is incredibly inconsiderate to the entire community who live near the park.&nbsp; Should the American Cancer Society be vilified for this idiotic fundraising event?&nbsp; Maybe not.&nbsp; But the event itself, and the impact on the surrounding community, should be loudly opposed.&nbsp; This Relay for Life concept is not sensible in an urban setting.&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine the idiots who thought Astoria Park was a good spot for this.&nbsp; I will actively urge anyone and everyone I know never to have anything to do with this Relay for Life or any other.&nbsp; Use Facebook and everything else to get the word out.&nbsp; Money talks.&nbsp; When this Relay concept results in low donations, maybe someone will wake up.&nbsp; Someone other than the neighbors trying to sleep, that is!&nbsp; I know times are hard but I&#039;m noticing more and more charities resorting to rather outrageous ways to score donations.&nbsp; What a shame.
