				I know its so silly, but I am so disgusted with the condition of my local laundry. Its the one on Crescent between Broadway and 34 Ave. Firstly, I have to bring my own cleaning supplies because there is so much mildew growing in the detergent compartments and I always see roaches crawling around on the machines and the tables. Secondly, the machines keep using less and less water. My last trip there was so disasterous that the clothes I supposedly &quot;washed&quot; in the machines smelled like dirty underwear when they came out. Is this a board of health issue? My son's blankets smelled literally of feces after being washed there. I use good soaps, hot water, etc. I ended up taking everything to another laundry and thankfully, everything got cleaned right. Whenever I complain, I get answers like &quot;You overloaded the machine.&quot; or &quot;I'll tell the owner.&quot; (I've gone for the bigger machines with less clothes and they do the same thing.)

				arg!&nbsp; Last night I went to do my laundry at the laundromat on 38th and Ditmars and the<br />woman there flipped out when I walked in the door at 9:25.&nbsp; She was very unhappy<br />about my starting at that time and proceeded to tell me that the last wash is it 9:15 <br />when it clearly states on the window in giant letters that the last wash is it 9:45!<br />AND she also said that she didn&#39;t want me leaving between washing and drying my <br />clothes because she insisted on my putting my clothes in the dryer immediately <br />following washing them...Now, I&#39;m a pretty reasonable person but I can&#39;t deal with the<br />barking orders at this place much longer.&nbsp; They are open from 7AM to 11PM so I know <br />I had more then enough time to wash and dry my clothes before they closed!&nbsp; ARG!<br />Why can&#39;t people just be nice!<br /><br /><br />

				I&#39;ve gone to Old Neighbors a couple of times, but I usually go to Chow&#39;s because the service is so good. They add a layer of plastic when they bag my clothes, just in case it happens to be raining when I pick them up. And they&#39;re always quite cordial. <br /><br />I haven&#39;t done a price comparison, though.

				A price comparison between Chow&#39;s, Old Neighbors and that nice hole-in-the-wall laundromat just North of Broadway on 32nd Street would be a good idea.&nbsp; Maybe I&#39;ll do that this weekend - they&#39;re all pretty reliable.&nbsp; I like the ladies who work at Old Neighbors best, but I like the way Chow&#39;s does the laundry better.

				Melmezzo, that laundry next to TradeFair? That place sucks so much.<br /><br />Now we get our laundry done by Grand Laundry, free pickup and delivery, .75 a lb and they do an awesome job of folding and will pickup and deliver according to your schedule. The owner, (I guess) Nick couldn&#39;t be nicer. But I did have to get over someone else handling my things, however I still wash our undies myself because, ewwww. My husband doesn&#39;t mind sending his out but that is too much for me. Having a service is much better than doing it myself, the cost is well worth it to me, esp. in the summer!

				hey Daisy, do you know anything about the drop-off service at the laudromat at 29th &amp; 21st Avenue? (Dropping off laundry is my one indulgence!)

				I&#39;m so fortunate with my laundry situation. There&#39;s a huge place on 34th St. just north of 31st Avenue that I go to (it&#39;s practically across the street) and it&#39;s awesome. If anyone lives close by and is looking for a good place, I&#39;d highly reccommend it. I&#39;m not sure about their drop-off service (I do my own), but the attendants are really nice, it&#39;s always clean, and there are tons of machines - so I rarely have to wait to use one. It&#39;s the next best thing to having laundry in your building (which my old apartment had, and which I miss dearly)!<br /><br />As for drop off vs. self service, obviously doing it yourself is cheaper, but I&#39;m also way too much of a control freak to let anyone wash my clothes. I wouldn&#39;t even let my MOM do my laundry by the time I got to college!&nbsp; :roll:

				Rachel, I have had my laundry done by 29th St and 21 Ave place, but they didn&#39;t hang up anything, but I&#39;m also not sure if I had stuff to hang up.&nbsp; But I never see that they hang up stuff for anyone, there are no clothes hanging around usually.&nbsp; My gripe about drop-off is that it costs more than twice as much, than if you just did it yourself.&nbsp; Doing it yourself, small loads normally cost 1.50 and it&#39;s only 25mins to wait, then 75cents to dry for half hour.&nbsp; Drop-off has cost me anywhere from 7-14 dollars, because if you have blankets or sheets they charge more!&nbsp; My laundry time takes less than 2 hours, I usually bring a good book and call people I usually don&#39;t have time to call.&nbsp; Before I know it, my laundry&#39;s done.<br /><br />I really wish they hadn&#39;t changed their closing time there.&nbsp; The woman doing the nightshift is new and she&#39;s not very nice at all.&nbsp; I had really liked the place cuz the last wash was 9pm.&nbsp; Now it&#39;s 8:30, and you get yelled at for coming in after 8pm, yet her new taped up sign says 8:30.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can&#39;t wait until I finally have my own washer and dryer.

				There are more than just money reasons as to why I don&#39;t do drop-off.&nbsp; I&#39;m pretty anal about my clothes, half are gentle cycle, and a lot have to hang dry to prevent shrinking.&nbsp; I&#39;m also not into other people touching my unmentionables.&nbsp; Some people have told me to just do the hard clothes myself and let dropoff do the others, but if I&#39;m already there to do one load, I might as well do them all.&nbsp; Doesn&#39;t take any longer.&nbsp; I guess I just prefer to do it myself, I pick the detergent, I do it my way.&nbsp; Considering it costs me more than twice as much to do drop-off as to do it do it myself, I&#39;d just rather do it myself and get it right the first time.&nbsp; <br /><br />But I know this is not a big issue for everyone and to each their own&nbsp; :-)

				Well, I&#39;ve been using the on that is located on 35ave, and 31st, right under the &quot;EL&quot;, and on the corner. It&#39;s convenient, clean, and the staff I find helpful, friendly, and courteous. They are Korean I think. They do have rags and things to clean up small messes when you want, but also do a good clean of the place frequently to keep the customers happy. They offer all services from Wash, to dry clean and self serve. It uses those cards, and not coins, so be aware of that fact. There are about 20 Dbl loaders, 10 Trpl, and like 2 Quads. There are about 15-20 dryers. The wash for dbls is $1.25, and the dryers are $.25 for 8mins. <br /><br />I enjoy this place cause it&#39;s close, clean, and for the most part not crowded. Except on Tues and Wed evening withb their specials on the dryers. I will say though, I usually do my wash, myself, on Sat AM, since there is not many folks there at that time. The morning time is best, as this place is becoming popular. I&#39;ve seen some cute guys I&#39;ve not seen there washing lately, that I&#39;ven never seen but over on 30th ave, b&#39;weay and the likes. Anyhoo, I like it there, and never have had a problem.<br /><br />again, AM is best...theyn are open until 9p, 8p is last wash i think.

				Sort of related:<br /><br />Does anyone know the last wash/closing times for Laundromat Seven (Ditmars between 35th and 36th) or whatever the one is on 31st between Ditmars and 21st Ave? I am leaving on vacation and have so much to do tonight, but I&#039;d really like to squeeze in one load of laundry before I go. Just want to know how late I can cut it. <br /><br />(Drop off is not an option, it just squicks me out waaaayyyy too much, plus I hang dry most of my stuff and I don&#039;t trust them to get it right).<br />

				There&#039;s one on 21 Ave and 29 St who&#039;s last wash is at 8:30pm.&nbsp; &nbsp;And while this laundromat is clean, the machines can be unpredictable (one dryer burned my socks!) and the workers tend to be cranky or just ambivalent.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t trust them with any of my clothes.&nbsp; Just check the dryers to make sure the back of the dryer isn&#039;t burnt BEFORE you put your clothes in them.

				I know a few people here don&#039;t like it, but I always use the laundromat on the other side of Trade Fair on Ditmars, whatever it&#039;s called. Their last wash is at 9:30, but they get cranky if you bring anything in after 8:30. So I&#039;d try to get it started around 8. The dryers have always worked well- usually I&#039;ll put an hour&#039;s worth of quarters in and put it on either low temp or medium, depending on what&#039;s in there, and everything&#039;s either dry or just about dry when I take it out. I&#039;ve had bad results with the dryers at Laundromat Seven, which is why I don&#039;t use it. The two times I&#039;ve been there the dryers have taken a really long time to dry.

				What happened to the one on Broadway and 41st? The one around the corner from Pollos Mario? I used to go there all the time since it is (was) closest to me. It wasn&#039;t especially wonderful but the machines worked and the people were nice. they didn&#039;t speak english but since i speak Spanish it was no big deal. I kind of liked it there because they always had a fan going and were always watching some soccer game...it was kind of cozy...then one day it was closed without any warning. Sigh...I go to the one on Broadway and 42nd now. Its all good but not the same...<br /><br />Separate rant: If you don&#039;t WORK at the laundromat, I don&#039;t want to hear your opinion on how to use the machines. Let me a) figure it out for myself or b) hear it from someone who WORKS there...capisce?

				Wow, had to go back 4 pages to get to this thread.<br /><br />Not my rant, but same Laundromat.&nbsp; &nbsp; Olympic Laundromat on Newtown Ave and 21st street.&nbsp; &nbsp;I ranted a while ago that they closed the shop once a good 40 minutes early while I had clothes in the drier and was told the next morning that &quot;we&#039;re not going to stay open for one person.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My concern at the time was not for my own clothers.&nbsp; Lets face it, I&#039;m not shopping at A&amp;F or anything.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was worried about the poor bastard that comes home late from work and needs to pick up their dry cleaning for the next day.&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, it looks like I worried for nothing.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve not since gone back, but since it is a nice clean laundromat and close to my building one of my fellow tenants goes there.&nbsp; &nbsp;She went the other day to pick up her dry cleaning during their last hour of daily operation and while they hadn&#039;t closed on her like they did to me, they wouldn&#039;t give her her dry cleaning because they had closed the register for the day.&nbsp; &nbsp; WTF?&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Am I being over-protective of one of my friends and fellow tenants, or is that just a poopie thing to do?&nbsp; This isn&#039;t a bank vault on a time lock, it&#039;s a freaking register.&nbsp; &nbsp; AAARgh!!<br /><br />&quot;... and that&#039;s all I got to say about that.&quot;&nbsp; -Forrest Gump

				Yeah, that&#039;s pretty crappy. I have to wonder about the type of person who&#039;d run a place in that manner, and if they&#039;re even around watching what&#039;s going around.
