			<br /><br /><br />An open note to car-owners...especially those with massive SUVs:<br /><br /><br />You should ALWAYS give a quick beep before pulling out of your driveway, ESPECIALLY if you are BACKING OUT.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Sidewalks are intended for PEDESTRIANS.&nbsp; I am stupefied at how many car owners never seem to consider that maybe, just maybe, a pedestrian may actually be ON the sidewalk right when they are about to pull their 2-ton vehicle out of the driveway.<br /><br /><br />Really, how HARD is it to just give a quick beep?&nbsp; Isn&#039;t it better to be safe than sorry?&nbsp; The onus is on you, the driver of the 2-ton vehicle, to watch out for pedestrians before pulling out.&nbsp; In addition, even then, you might not SEE the pedestrian...maybe just as you turn your head to one side, they are coming up from the other side.&nbsp; Or maybe the pedestrian is a toddler...the neighbor&#039;s kid...maybe your own kid.&nbsp; Either way, give a beep.<br /><br /><br />Today I almost got hit (yet again!) by an SUV that was backing out of its driveway.&nbsp; I (nicely) told the driver that it&#039;s a good idea to give a quick beep before pulling out.&nbsp; He said he was sorry.&nbsp; So all was good.&nbsp; But again, drivers need to understand that the onus is on THEM and their 2-ton vehicle to be more cautious.&nbsp; The sidewalk is for pedestrians.&nbsp; And while I understand that yes, cars may be pulling in and out, I can&#039;t be stopping at every single driveway before passing it, to first check if the car is occupied...engine on...passengers inside or not.&nbsp; I use my general awareness of course...if I see something obvious... but if it&#039;s during the day...and maybe no cars lights are on..and the car isn&#039;t moving yet...I may not realize there&#039;s a driver inside who&#039;s just about to back out.<br /><br /><br />So just give a quick beep.&nbsp; It&#039;s not that difficult and could save a life!<br /><br /><br />Trucks now make automatic beeping sounds as they are backing up.&nbsp; Clearly this was a new design intended to ALERT people that the truck is about to move, or IS moving.&nbsp; Cars don&#039;t have this option, so in the meantime the onus is on the driver to alert others around them that they are about to pull out.<br /><br /><br />Thank you!!!!
