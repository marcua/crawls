				I don&#039;t know if anyone else saw the aftermath of the huge auto accident on this corner tonight. Looks like some guy doing 70 down 24th Ave. clipped a cab crossing 27th St., which caused him (the Beamer) to spin out of control and hit 2 parked cars. He&#039;s trying to pin it on the poor cabbie, who only lost a bumper but looked pretty sick. The BMW and the parked cars were pretty messed up.<br /><br />Who do we talk to about getting a light put in at that corner? They just put one on 28th St., but 27th St. as gotten as many as three accidents a week.<br />

				I saw it.&nbsp; The beamer was destroyed.&nbsp; what kind of irresponsible asshat does that kind of speed on that small road?&nbsp; I mean the block after where he hit the cabbie has a stop sign.&nbsp; Was he planning on coming to a stop from 70 in one block?&nbsp; I really wish the neighbors would band together and demand that speed bumps be put in on either approach to that stop sign.<br /><br /><br />I feel sorry for the parked cars that this moron&#039;s recklessness destroyed.&nbsp; The one white infiniti got hit so hard that half the car was lifted off the street and onto the side-walk.&nbsp; I hope they throw the book at him.&nbsp; Feel sorry for the cabbie.

				Thank you. My thoughts exactly. I&#039;m sure the insurance people will look at the damage to the cars and realize that the accident couldn&#039;t have happened the way Beamer guy supposedly said it did.

				Sadly - the cars blow through traffic lights as well.&nbsp; Lately 31st street between Ditmars and Astoria Boulevard has become a free-for-all.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />I&#039;m not sure why the traffic police aren&#039;t doing anything.&nbsp; They could make a fortune in tickets if they wanted.

				People drive like animals in Astoria. It&#039;s getting worse and worse. Every week some asshole drives on the wrong side of the road to pass people they think are going to slow that are actually going the speed limit. People need to slow the hell down and relax. You&#039;ll get where you&#039;re going when you get there. Jeez.

				We have lived within view of that intersection for 4 years and it&#039;s always treacherous. People roll through the stop sign like it&#039;s optional, fail to yield to pedestrians and generally drive like they are the only people on the road. And that&#039;s just the people on 27th Street! Before the stoplight on 28th Street,&nbsp; 24th Avenue traffic was much worse. People still drive to fast there (the accident is a case in point) but at least it&#039;s a little easier to cross if you time it with the light. <br />I cannot imagine how fast that BMW had to have been going. He totally destroyed one car and busted the axle on his own vehicle. That takes some force! We heard a god-awful &quot;bang&quot; and I actually thought it was the transformer blowing like it did last year. Except it wasn&#039;t a hot day so that didn&#039;t totally make sense. Once we walked down to investigate we realized what happened.&nbsp; My spouse had just left to go jogging and was right there when the accident happened. He said a lot of people were screaming at the driver, which was really pointless. Yes, he drove like an *a*h* but screaming at him doesn&#039;t help anyone.<br />In any case, drivers need to step back and realize this is a neighborhood full of families and elderly folks and that kind of speed is just not ok!

When was the last time walking in manhattan any driver gave the right of way to a pedestrian at a crosswalk? I see drivers in every part of nyc routinely doing 40-50mph on all roads. This is an automobile driven nation and city. Cars feel like they own the road and everyone should get out of their way. <br /><br />How can we expect things to change, when cops who should set an example are the first to abuse the rules of the road and drive like idiots in non-emergency situations? ( i see them chatting on cell phones, running red lights, speeding, parking on crosswalks, etc... every day)

				&nbsp;<br />If i had a penny for every person i see driving while texting, i&#039;ll be rich. I see it all the time, young and old drivers. I also think it adds to the traffic, people looking down instead of straight ahead resulting in slower stop n go.

				driving is definitely worse in astoria than many other parts of nyc, but i think some of that stems from close proximity to major bridges and major roadway entrances/exits. people get all hepped up from sitting in traffic/memories of traffic jams past/fear of future traffic jams and drive aggressively to compensate.<br /><br />the other part is that cultural norms are communicable, like the flu. no one in astoria likes to drive around the block, for example, so u-turns are part of the driving culture here. it&#039;s like a broken windows theory, but for cars. i think this works for the dogcrap issue as well - well that and a sizable % people who own dogs are dirtbags. :)
