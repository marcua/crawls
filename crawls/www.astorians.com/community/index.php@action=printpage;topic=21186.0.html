				Hey! One of my 2 roommates is moving out when our lease is up Sept. 1st (she&#039;s moving in with her boyfriend) and we are looking to replace her. The apartment is on 31st Street btwn 34th &amp; 35th Ave. Here are some details:<br /><br />- $835/month (total rent is $2500)<br />- utilities are split evenly every month, they are all in my name<br />- private entrance<br />- 3 floor residence: 1st floor is the owner&#039;s office, 2nd &amp; 3rd are ours<br />- 2 full bathrooms, 1 on each floor<br />- full kitchen, dining room, living room, lots of closet space!<br />- must be cat friendly!<br />- available bedroom is on 2nd floor<br /><br />We have no preferences to gender/sexual orientation but we do require that you are financially responsible (rent &amp; bills on time!) and that you clean up after yourself &amp; help with chores (dishes, garbage, etc.) The two of us (girls - 26 &amp; 27) remaining in the apartment have lived together for almost a year now and we have a very friendly, very communal living space... we share everything &amp; we love doing random dinner/movies/dessert nights and we also do laundry &amp; food shopping, etc. together on occasion. <br /><br />You will be required to sign the lease when we renew on 9/1 as well, so a one month deposit will be due at that time. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t taken pictures yet but will do asap. If interested please message me! Thanks!<br /><br />- Lauren
