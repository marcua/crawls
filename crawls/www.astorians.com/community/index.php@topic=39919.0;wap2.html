Spearheaded by a female-driven production team, Lysistrata tells the tale of a determined cheerleader who leads the students around her in a battle of the sexes. With a rocking score written by Lewis Flinn and book by five-time Tony nominee Douglas Carter Beane, the show will be an immersive experience performed on a faux basketball court at the back of the Variety Boys and Girls Club in Queens. In the first production in New York since its Broadway run, Ophelia Theatre is thrilled to be giving a new feminist life to this baller cult classic! We guarantee laughs, romance and basketballs, lots of basketballs!<br /><br /><br />The Ophelia Theater entrance and parking lot for Lysistrata Jones is located in the Variety Boys and Girls Club parking lot; turn off of 21st St.<br /><br /><br />Media Contact: John Hoffman, hoffman@opheliatheatre.org, (951) 285-6467<br /><br /><br />Production Staff:<br />Director - Billie Aken-Tyers<br />Assistant Director - Zach Rich<br />Choreographer - Kristen Sandler<br />Asst.

Originally comprised of 15 members, the company has grown to an excess of 50 passionate artists after relocating to Astoria, NY to further pursue theirprofessional and creative development. They are dedicated to providing quality theatre to Astoria and its surrounding neighborhoods, having successfully renovated a seldom-used dance studio at the Variety Boys and Girls Club of Queens into a 75-seat black box theater, which they utilize to rehearse and perform original works, published works, new play readings and variety events. They also volunteer to provide theatre classes and performance opportunities for the children at the Boys and Girls Club. <br /><br /><br />New York productions include: Your Alice, Some Night, Hedda Gabler, The Seagull,The Tempest, Almost Maine, Marys Little Monster, Floyd Collins, The Fox and Boulder, As You Like It, Rockabye Hamlet (first New York revival), Fortinbras, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, Hamlet, The Cast Party, God Chairs and the Infinite Burrito, and reasons to be pretty.
