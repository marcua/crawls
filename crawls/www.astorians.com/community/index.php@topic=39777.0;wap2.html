			I saw they put up a sign where Razzies pizza used to be that says Burger Lab.&nbsp; It looks retro like Flattops sign.&nbsp; Let&#039;s see what this place will be like.&nbsp; The space is very small.

			The name sounds very strange to me and the sign is ugly

			I walked by when they had the door open and saw the inside of this place.&nbsp; They;re still working on it, but it looks nice.&nbsp; There is now exposed brick.&nbsp; I&#039;m still not sure what kind of place this will be with the strange name of Burger Lab.&nbsp; I&#039;m curious to find out.&nbsp; They&#039;ve been working on this place for a while now.

			It&#039;s not going to be the Lab grown meat... unless you want to pay thousands of dollars...<br /><br /><br />However, I believe the chain is originally based in New Zealand or Australia. It is yet ANOTHER attempt to &quot;gourmet&quot; a hamburger by putting it on a some kind of fancy roll and weird stuff on them and then charging $$$. They&#039;re behind the times by at least 2 years since I&#039;m sure this idea is as dated as Avocado Toast.
