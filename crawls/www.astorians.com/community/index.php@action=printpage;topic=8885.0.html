				Guess what I found today on my boss&#039;s desk when I went to look for a file on her computer: porn! Four pages of girl-on-girl porn, full color and full of nasty details. My boss is out today. Evidently, the person who printed it out is this guy who works in our office...I&#039;m not really sure what he does, I just know he comes here everyday. And he&#039;s like 65. Talk about a misuse of company ink...and I&#039;m the lucky winner who found it all! Oddly enough, as horrific and embarassing as it is (my poor boss has to confront the guy now) I find the whole thing rather amusing. Like really funny. I&#039;m sitting here trying not to laugh. Am I crazy?&nbsp; :lol:

				<br />its only porn, but should&#039;nt be in the office<br />just ask him (the 65 yr old) if he printed it out, a good tech can tell what pc pulled it up and printed it out, so just ask him, if not him could be your boss, maybe he forgot them- and thats Jokes for life on him

				there are few things funnier than old men looking at and subsequently printing out pornography in the office.&nbsp; The thing that you have to wonder, is why would he need to print it?&nbsp;

				That is funny.&nbsp; This is somewhat (un)related but you story reminded me of something similar...<br /><br />When I was in school, I worked in a coffee shop.&nbsp; One day I swapped an opening shift with a coworker and and when I arrived, the entire back room was covered in gay porn.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; Pages of magazines were taped everywhere.&nbsp; I opened up the ice bin and what do you think was hanging in front of me?&nbsp; I opened up the refrigerator -same.&nbsp; I was told that the closing shift expected my other coworker to open that morning...&nbsp; They thought it was even more funny that it was me instead.&nbsp; &nbsp;Apparently, they used 3 entire magazines to plaster the back office.&nbsp; It was quite astounding.<br /><br />At the time, I thought it was hilarious (and still kind of do) but now I realize that should someone else opened that day it could have meant a whole lot of trouble!

				I work in a small office. If I give away any more details, I fear I&#039;ll run the risk of one of my boss&#039;s clients seeing this and getting me in trouble...call me paranoid....if you really want to know though, PM me and I&#039;ll dish... :evil:
