				Limeade and sparkling water could be good, too.&nbsp; Am going to try to sweeten the limeade with agave syrup, which can make the juice even more refreshing.&nbsp; I&#39;m still going to bring some pre-frozen bottles of Vitamin Water for extra hydration.&nbsp; A well-hydrated megc is a happy megc.<br /><br />Candy snacks sound good!

Hell, maybe just ice on a stick!<br /><br /><br />OK, so the lights just dimmed and the ac cut out mostly.&nbsp; &nbsp;So maybe salads, smoothies and i&#39;ll highjack an ice cream truck.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hope to see you all there.<br /><br />

				ok so am i the only one with reservations about going tonight? They say it will be hotter then last night....and that was pretty darn hot. i really figured it would be in the 80&#39;s at night but looking at the weather now, its looking like 90&#39;s. i don&#39;t stand up well to the heat&nbsp; :-(<br />i am totally still open to going, but i will be keeping an eye on the heat throughout the day. i left my blankie and cooler at home cause i wanted to keep the drinks cold, so i&#39;d have to stop home before heading out. <br /><br />**fingers crossed**<br />&nbsp;:-D

				Well, I&#39;m a little surprised that Socrates/AMMI is even thinking of still having the event.&nbsp; If I were them, I&#39;d be concerned about the heat affecting people as well as the equipment to run the show - projectors/electronics equipment can get awfully hot on their own and are more apt to break down.&nbsp; But as far as I know, they only cancel for rain.&nbsp; Looks like it&#39;ll be in the mid-90s tonight...not sure what to do.&nbsp; Will keep monitoring things as the day progresses.

				Well, I just walked home from the Astoria Pool - that&#39;s a mile.&nbsp; It was not a bad walk at all.&nbsp; When the breeze kicked up and I was in the shade, it was pretty comfortable.&nbsp; I had on what was essentially a tank top and shorts with sandals.&nbsp; Had been in the pool for about a half hour, but still it was hot when I got out.&nbsp; I would recommend you keep a bottle of water in hand if you are going to walk the distance from the subway to Socrates - it makes everything better.&nbsp; I am guessing the temperatures will be manageable by the time the evening hits.&nbsp; Humdity is pretty low, so that&#39;s why I think it doesn&#39;t feel so oppresive right now.&nbsp; So, I&#39;m still on for the movie.&nbsp; I&#39;ll probably opt out of making the limeade, due to not really knowing if people are going to show for the whole shebang.&nbsp; Water or Vitamin Water would probably be a better bet anyway.&nbsp; I think I&#39;ll be by around 7:30 or so.&nbsp; Who is with me as of now?&nbsp; :)<br /><br />And congrats, JD, on the job!!

				I went, lanseaux, jim, megc, and jtrane were also there, as were some of my neighbors. <br /><br />The grub was good, as was the movie (I was the only one who stayed for that though). It actually wasn&#39;t that bad out once the sun went down. It was even cool enough for a nice bike ride after the movie!

				Well, I went for food (movie didn&#39;t interest me), and it was delicious as always.&nbsp; Especially the corn and sage pudding!&nbsp; Wow, what a taste delight.&nbsp; My favorite yummy of the evening.&nbsp; Oh, and the brownies were pretty amazing, too.<br /><br />Sunswick was fun, a nice group of folks there.&nbsp; A lovely evening overall.<br /><br />Oh, and it wasn&#39;t super nasty out, I thought.&nbsp; I walked the 1.3 miles from Socrates to Sunswick, and while I was tired at the end, it was ok.

				Sorry I missed it; by the time I got out of work I was loath to take that long walk to the park so I just went to sunswick (food :) , service&nbsp; :x )<br /><br />Would have preferred Jonathan&#39;s fare, though....

				That&#39;s funny - service there whenever I&#39;d been there before was just fine.&nbsp; Two tall gals that work there always did a good job; there was someone different there last night.&nbsp; I&#39;ve also been there mostly when it hasn&#39;t been as crazy busy as it was last night.&nbsp; I am guessing that had something to do with it.&nbsp; I&#39;d definitely go back.

				Thanks to all the sweaty tribe how turned out last night for grub and movie.<br /><br />Reminder to all: next time you see me working on the truck at a ridiculous event in that heat; SHOOT ME and take me with you for ac, beer and people.<br /><br />Good news is that I lost 23 pounds!

				We had a ladies night at Sunswick and I do remember the service being not so hot.&nbsp; The waitresses are just not that attentive, which is pretty stupid on their end, because more service means more orders for drinks means more tips.&nbsp; I really didn&#39;t think it was so busy last night that they couldn&#39;t have tended to us better.&nbsp; Why have a waitress at all if you have to go to the bar to order additional drinks and food, and then wait 20 mins for your check?&nbsp; I like the food and the beers on tap, but the service is just horrible.
