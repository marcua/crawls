			I would like to take this opportunity to say DON&#39;T work with Liz from Metropolis Realty (on 23rd ave).&nbsp; The other people in there are cool, but she&#39;s a swindler (trust me I know first hand).&nbsp; I was getting into an argument with her about getting my deposit back (from an apartment where her brother was the landlord) and after I stormed off, one of the other employees there caught up with me down the street and told me they&#39;ve seen her do that dozens of times and that I should take her to small claims court.. anyway, just beware of her.&nbsp; <br /><br />Tim

Me, too! The woman drove me nuts!! She took me to a million places, none of which met my requirements. :idiot: I thought it was just me!<br /><br />I used Chantal Masrahi at Aamen Realty (718.726.4141), the office is right through the walkway at the Ditmars station. While not perfect, she was really nice, listened to what I wanted (and got it for me, too), and helped me fix a mistake on my lease right away.
