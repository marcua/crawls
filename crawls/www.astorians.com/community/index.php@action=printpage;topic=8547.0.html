				I have to agree with the idea that Kensei has the same ability as Peter to absorb powers.&nbsp; Even if he doesn&#039;t die, he would certainly appear older a hundred and fifty years later, I would think.&nbsp; Wolverine / Logan / James Howlett aged progressively, so I don&#039;t think that Kensei would look exactly the same.&nbsp;

				Ok..I just found out what everyone is talking about with Kensei...man do I feel stupid.&nbsp; How did I miss it.&nbsp; He is a thought for everyone.&nbsp; If he started &quot;The Company&quot; and he was in the past, maybe is is the first and father to all the Heros?&nbsp; :?&nbsp; Hopefully we will find out the real story behind him.

				The reason I don&#039;t think he has absorbing powers like Peter and Sylar is where di the super healing come from then?&nbsp; Hiro doesn&#039;t have it.&nbsp; The big mystery is going to be the Petrilli&#039;s father&#039;s backstory, he&#039;s the only one in the picture you can&#039;t readily ID b/c he&#039;s moving his head (although I freeze framed it and he does look like Nathan I think). <br /><br />I guess I&#039;ll just have to remain enthralled until Feb when Lost returns and that consumes my life...

				Okay, so the regeneration theorists were right about Adam / Kensei, so I guess Claire, Peter and now Bennett will all live to be 400 years old? <br />Anyway, last night&#039;s episode was one of the better ones this season, in my opinion.&nbsp; I&#039;m still miffed that there are only two more episodes.&nbsp; Does that mean two more for the entire season, or is there going to be a break and it&#039;ll come back for a bunch more in February?

				I bet it will be on a break and come back.&nbsp; They did that with Alias, too.<br /><br />Bennett is now a regenerator b/c of Claire&#039;s blood?<br /><br />Is it because of the writers strike or what this planned all along?&nbsp; I think I missed this bit of info originally.

				Sylar needs to work on not being creepy, then he would be a better villain, he is like daring people to realize he is a sick f___.<br /><br />Whoever asked about Bob&#039;s power, he is the midas of the heroes, not sure how that would do in battle, but it sure pays for things.&nbsp; I wish they didn&#039;t make Suresh such a pansy and I think they wrote elctro girl&#039;s character over the top annoying.&nbsp; <br /><br />I find it hard to believe that they were all so afraid of Adam/Kensei but they put him in a location where he could easily talk to Peter...hardly makes sense, so I am wondering if Bob and Adam worked something out.&nbsp; <br /><br />I did think that was a good episode last night, although I feel as though we will never see Hiro&#039;s father&#039;s powers now and that saddens me.&nbsp;

				Here is my theory.<br /><br />I think the parents have the same powers as their kids.&nbsp; Also, I think a paradox is going on by I think Hero made Kensei/Adam evil which is why he is evil now.&nbsp; He seemed normal in the past until Hero pissed him off.

				the problem with the parent theory is that Claire has a flame starting mother and a flying father.&nbsp; Bob can turn things to gold while Elle is electric, of course I don&#039;t know where her mother is.&nbsp; The paradox is good too, but I think Hiro was always the real kensei in that crazy back in time is the future aspect of it all...just like Terminator.

				from one of my many random newsletters:<br />&#039;Heroes&#039; Creator Sorry For This Season...<br /><br />The creator of the TV show &#039;Heroes&#039; has apologized to fans for<br />shortcomings in the new season&#039;s plot.<br /><br />Speaking to Entertainment Weekly, the brains behind the television<br />program, Tim Kring, stated that events in the second series were<br />taking too long to unfold and vowed to set right the show&#039;s problems,<br />which have resulted in a ratings slide.<br /><br />He told the magazine: &quot;We assumed the audience wanted season one a<br />build-up of intrigue about these characters and the discovery of their<br />powers. We taught [them] to expect a certain kind of storytelling.<br />They wanted adrenaline. We made a mistake.&quot;<br /><br />Kring added that the show, about people with supernatural abilities<br />coming together to save the world, needed to reveal this season&#039;s<br />mission earlier. Subplots involving the love interest of blonde<br />cheerleader Claire and the time-bending adventures of time-bender<br />Hiro had also been mishandled, he said.<br /><br />The maker of the show, which is currently out of episodes due to<br />the writers&#039; strikes in Hollywood, added that the script was being<br />changed to rejuvenate viewer interest.<br /><br />He stressed: &quot;The message is that we&#039;ve heard the complaints and<br />we&#039;re doing something about it.&quot;

				I loved the first season.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like this season very much.&nbsp; I thought the episode on Monday the 26th, was terrible to the point where I could hardly watch it. <br /><br />I think there are too many stories going on at once.&nbsp; It&#039;s gone beyond tantalizing and become pesky.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t think there was any reason to bring Sylar back.&nbsp; The Mexican siblings have been irrelevant and I think their power is stupid.&nbsp; The situation with the brother on Monday was absurd.&nbsp; <br /><br />The character I like least is Wes/West, the emo kid who has spent most of the season complaining about things and being emo to the point where I kept expecting him to write Claire a poem.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t like Caitlin, the Irish girl, because the actress&#039; attempt at an Irish accent was so bad that I couldn&#039;t focus on anything else in her storyline.&nbsp; For God&#039;s sake, stop calling him &quot;Paytir!&quot;&nbsp; (Side note: did you know that none of the actors for the scenes set in Ireland are actually Irish?)&nbsp; <br /><br />The new addition to the show that I&#039;ve liked was Matt Parkman&#039;s dad, who I thought was exceptionally creepy and had a frightening power.&nbsp; Contrary to others here, I kind of like Kristen Bell the &quot;electro girl.&quot;&nbsp; I think that her character is interesting because of how her father basically kept her in a Skinner box and created a killer out of her.&nbsp; I&#039;m interested in seeing whether she rejects him in the end and becomes &quot;good.&quot; <br /><br />The more I think about it, the more I realize that there&#039;s not much about this season that I like.&nbsp; I think I&#039;m only watching it because I&#039;m very lazy on Monday night and I want to find out what happens, but don&#039;t want to read the spoilers.<br /><br />What&#039;s going on after the &quot;last episode&quot; on Monday.&nbsp; Are they having a recess and then bringing it back?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Okay, so I haven&#039;t read the thread because I haven&#039;t gotten to see Heroes really. I caught one or two episodes last season and one or two this season, but I kind of want to avoid them until I can actually watch the whole thing.<br /><br />Does anyone have them on DVD or on their computers that I could give them some disks to make me copies or borrow them some freezing weekend?

				I think Linderman&#039;s power was to consciously heal at will while Claire and Adam Monroe have the ability to naturally regenerate because of their blood.&nbsp; So, either one would work, but Peter would have to inject Nathan with his, Claire or Adam&#039;s blood in order to regenerate him.&nbsp; <br /><br />Did anyone else pick up on the electra complex idea of Claire falling in love with a guy with the same power as her natural father?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				My fracking DVR either didn&#039;t record the show or it decided to erase it!!! I have the whole season set to record. Anyone know if it&#039;s airing again sometime soon. I think I may have gotten it on the G4 network but my on screen guide didn&#039;t match the online listing. gggrrrr!!!!<br />
