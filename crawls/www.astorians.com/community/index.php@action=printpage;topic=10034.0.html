				Great topic, betheroonie.&nbsp; So, here&#039;s my silly story about my screen name.<br /><br />I don&#039;t remember exactly when I heard it first, but when I lived in Chicago I would hear kids who were either in gangs or were perpetrating that they were, greeting each other with the name of their gang and end it with &quot;luv&quot; and then came the obligatory five minutes of handshakes, hand signs and gestures (called stacking).&nbsp; <br /><br />When I came to NYC, several of the people that I hung out with in the projects that I lived in had street names that ended with &quot;luv&quot; e.g. Tone-luv, Mo-Luv, etc. It was easy to do with my real name and for a very brief time,thankfully, my friends would greet me with **- luv.&nbsp; To them it was a term of affection; like you belonged. <br /><br />And then came the 2Pac and , &quot;California Luv&quot; and suddenly, using &quot;luv&quot; spread to across the nation.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if it really took off in my hometown in Minnesota, though. <br /><br />I really don&#039;t know why it has to be misspelled.&nbsp; I guess it looks &quot;cool&quot; if you don&#039;t know how to spell.&nbsp; Or it might have to do with people, especially boys and men who hang out in the neighborhood wanting to express some sort of emotion with their male friends that isn&#039;t &quot;love.&quot;<br /><br />Anyway, that&#039;s my ridiculously verbose explanation of my name.&nbsp; There&#039;s a couple of screen names that I have been curious about their origin, like Alison or Ntrain.&nbsp; <br />

				rnrollgirl = rock-n-roll girl<br /><br />when i lived in (brixton) london about 10 years ago, they were going through huge surge of drum and bass music.&nbsp; although i eventually developed an appreciation for the sound, at the time, i was a total rock-n-roll devotee.&nbsp; an american friend said that i was a &quot;<strong>rock-n-roll girl in a drum-n-bass world</strong>.&quot;&nbsp; i guess the name stuck.<br /><br />the other nickname that came out of that time, which i also use as a screen name occasionally, is &quot;tyranny&quot; (my real name is tyra).&nbsp; i was dubbed this by an english friend.

				part of my middle name and 28 is not only dob related but also literary- like I place things on the 28th page or paragraph when I write- (also, 2+8=10 and 1+0=1 the original prime number- I have some numbers on me...tattoo...haven&#039;t used hotmail in years, but I was once stanza28@hotmail, back in the day when only geeks used email. I think this whole entry is evidence of geekness, actually...<br />plus baddassgeekbitch was taken, is too long, and seems like a German word when quickly perused.<br />google stanza28 for some more...or don&#039;t- the porn stanza28 is <strong>not</strong> me, nor is the myspace- the rest, pretty much, is.<br /><br />some people who know me in &quot;real life&quot; call me &quot;mc.&quot;<br />some <em>very</em> old friends call me stanzy b/c they (incorrectly) think it bugs me.<br /><br />wow that felt so narcissistic... :roll:<br /><br />

				Last name Murphy. A buddy sent out an email where instead of typing my name as &quot;Murph&quot;, typed instead &quot;Hrmph&quot; and it somehow stuck. I actually like it as every person with last name Murphy goes my Murf. Not me, I am the one and only Hrmph.
