				My wife is due early next year. &nbsp;All our doctors, planned activities, etc. are in Manhattan, though we live in Astoria. &nbsp;Just wondering if anyone is pregnant, has babies, knows babies, has seen babies, is looking to be in a family way in Astoria.<br /><br />Volo, on Ditmars, used to have a group that met periodically. &nbsp;Looked like mostly mothers with newborns. &nbsp;Seemed like a cool bunch of folks, but we weren't pregnant then so we didn't make much effort.<br /><br />I think Astoria's becoming a haven for folks like us who couldn't afford to have a kid in the city, so move to Astoria where space is *slightly* more affordable.<br /><br />If anyone has any thoughts or ideas along these lines, be interested to hear.

				I know that Freeze Peach (where I work) would be interesting in sponsoring a group just like this. Let's talk about some possibilities.<br /><br />Have you been to the cafe? I think it might work well for your idea.<br /><br />We're at 2200 29th St in Astoria.

				i dont know if it helps at all... but i live above a pediatricians office.<br /><br />37-11 23ave. &nbsp;off the Ditmars stop.<br /><br />they may be a good source of information for parenting groups and such. &nbsp;i remember seeing a bulletin board in their waiting room.

				My wife and I would be interested in discussing with others about having a family in Astoria or NYC in general. &nbsp;As someone mentioned earlier...we're clueless too! &nbsp;<br />We would like to meet couples who are planning to have children here as well as those with new borns.

				Freeze Peach would be happy to host such a group. Is there a time and day that would work best for you? How about a Monday or Thursday night starting at 6, 7, or 8pm.<br /><br />Any afternoon is also great for the cafe. We could meet initially to see what interest there might be and then go from there to plan a regular weekly/monthly or whatever meeting.<br /><br />Please let me know your thoughts on this.

				The trouble with Tuesdays at the Freeze Peach anyway, is that we already &nbsp;have a chess group meeting there.<br /><br />Thursday is the best day at any time. Is that a possibility?

				We just moved to Astoria in August with our then-3 month old (from Seattle area), so i have no local information or resources, but am also desperate to hang out with other parents of young babies.<br /><br />I just registered for the website because i was specifically interested in finding cool people to hang out with in the afternoons. (Evenings, i've got a husband to hang with, but daytime is one long, boring diaper change...)<br /><br />As the weather gets warmer, there will be more parents in the park--but most of them have mobile kids. <br />i have found very little for non-mobile babies.<br /><br />(ok, so sam is now &quot;cruising&quot;... but the fall was very lonely)<br /><br />There's Bumbolee, but they are kind of expensive (imho)... but if i could afford it, I'd go to them. <br />they were doing stuff for kids at least as young as 6 months, maybe younger. <br />(i think i get a discount if you mention my name!)<br /><br />For 2-4 yr olds, there's a place (Kid Crazy?) on 19th street i was impressed by-- but again, not helpful for under 2s.<br /><br />I hate my doctor. So does my one friend-with-child, who i met waiting for the same doctor. But neither of us have heard of anything better, locally. You may want to stay with the manhattan ones. (And who do you like, since i expect my baby will get a sibling eventually, and i keep hearing horror stories of local births. <br />has no one heard of a doula around here???)<br /><br />I would suggest meeting this tuesday afternoon, 3 pmish myself.<br /><br />Or some other day of the week... but afternoons are really best for me...

				The chess/poker group is considering moving to Friday nights. Is there any interest in a Tuesday night parent/baby group? I think that might be a good opportunity to have an initial meeting and share ideas.

				I would love to join you (just moved to Astoria and have a 5 mo old), but night time is tough since I have KIDS! &nbsp;LOL! &nbsp; (also, Freeze Peach is a great place, but not the best for strollers and small, exploring fingers!)<br /><br />Still looking for a good pediatrician I would feel compatible with (primarily one who would be supportive of extended breastfeeding, non- or delayed vax, co-sleeping and such). &nbsp;<br /><br />Maybe we could start a playgroup in a park/playground once the weather gets nicer?<br /><br />Would love to meet up with other moms of two or more.

				email me!<br /><br />queenalia@hotmail.com<br /><br />i live two blocks from the park (astoria park, i mean)...<br /><br />i've been trying to get moms/stay at home parents to my house for a few months now. what with all the exciting colds going around this year, we have a large attrition rate. :)<br /><br />i just met a nice mom (who teaches alexander technique, no less) yesterday with a &nbsp;6 month old, so yours wouldn't be the only non-mobile one if you came.<br /><br />i've just been randomly inviting people with kids to my house for coffee; there's been no regular day and time... &nbsp;maybe that would help...<br /><br />hm.<br /><br />anyway, email me! there are other breast-feeding, co-sleeping, coffee drinking parents out there who want to meet you! ;)<br /><br />cheers,<br />alia
