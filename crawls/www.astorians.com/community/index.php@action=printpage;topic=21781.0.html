				They were planning to expand a WHILE back, perhaps a year, at least.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t know it was still a possibility.&nbsp; Saw the renos and thought that it might finally happen.

				I had lunch there a couple weeks ago, and they said they were taking over the space next door to expand and open up a full bar. It will probably be nice, but I like the intimate feel of the place as is and would have rather seen a different space open up next door.

				FYI:<br />&nbsp;<br />We had dinner at Watawa last night and as the waiter was bringing us the cheque he said that they will be closing on Wednesday to do the renovations/expansion into the new space and would be closed for a few weeks.<br />&nbsp;<br />I&#039;m excited to see what they are going to do and wonder if&nbsp; the cut-through will be similar to what BareBurger did at their original location.

				Caught a glimpse inside the other night when they had the front opened. It was all still under construction, so it was hard to tell. But I saw a bar up in the front and some arches or dividers of some kind in the back with another room on the other side.

				They had their doors open, so I walked in there today. The space is gorgeous. Really raw, I would say they&#039;re at least another couple of weeks from opening, but on one side they have a giant glass topped bar that would be great to hang out at (looks like they&#039;re going for a full bar with liquor), and on the other a really long sushi bar. Tables are nice, lots of exposed brick. They really stepped up their game.

				Just a heads up that Watawa is open again!!!&nbsp; We just went and the renovations are really beautiful!&nbsp; Yes, they raised their prices a couple bucks on everything but they really have raised the bar on what a restaurant should look like in this growing area.<br />The letter in the menu was a nice touch as well.&nbsp; :)

				Watawa is open since last week&#039;s Tuesday. Went there 2 times already. The first time, on their grand opening, the only thing that was kinda annoying was the wait. The doubled the seating space but the sushi bar is the same size, so I wonder if the food wait getting longer is a permanent thing. But I guess if you order appetizers, you might notice it. The food is still superb and adding specialty cocktails and full bar is a nice touch.
