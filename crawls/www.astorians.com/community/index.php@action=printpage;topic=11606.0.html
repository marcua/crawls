				I posted this before but I thought I try it also here.&nbsp; <br /><br />So we went to their open house this past weekend and I liked the people and the facility.&nbsp; But like a the paranoid mommy for my little precious, I feel like I need other thoughts on the day care.&nbsp; What are your thoughts - Negative or Positive.<br /><br />Thanks.

				My husband and I went to the open house as well and really like the place. I was just worried because aside from that one teacher that was there, the director really hasn&#039;t hired the staff yet. I was also wondering if there was any outdoor space for the kids or do they take them to the park on Steinway... <br /><br />Overall though, we really liked the place and will probably end up sending our son there on a part-time basis. I just want to check out Bright Beginnings first before committing to this place.

				I don&#039;t think they have a website, but I&#039;ve gotten a couple of really strong recommendations from parents who send their kiddies there. It&#039;s called <br />All Children&#039;s Child Care (Sorry! Bright Beginnings is the name of the preschool)<br />(718) 707-0501 <br />35-01 24th St<br />Long Island City, NY 11106<br /><br />They are building a new site on 31st ave &amp; 32nd street which will be open mid-September. <br /><br />I&#039;ve heard fantastic things about the people and the program. The facility leaves a bit to be desired, but they have a solid reputation and the kids seem really happy there.<br /><br />

				I dont know if it has changed..But I used to work for the people who run Bright Beginnings.<br /><br />I wouldnt send my child there if you paid me to. Although the staff was decent, the directors, AWFUL! They are pretty deceiving to say the least.<br /><br />I just wanted to put my voice out there.

				I&#039;m sorry to hear that... especially since you have first hand knowledge of what goes on there behind the scenes. Let us know if there are safety issues we should be aware of. And thanks for your post -- I appreciate your honesty.

				I don&#039;t have anything to contribute about mushroom day care though I hope that it is wonderful as Astoria really needs more daycare options!<br /><br />I just wanted to mention that both of my kids go to All Children&#039;s Child Care/Bright Beginnings and though I don&#039;t want to &quot;pimp&quot; for them--- I&#039;ve been pretty happy. <br /><br />Safety wise, fine so far--- clean?&nbsp; the baby room is pretty darn clean (the toys in my older son&#039;s classroom could sometimes do with a wipe down, though).&nbsp; My kids have gone to the 35th ave facility--- looks like a factory--- no good outdoor space, but at least there is a space right there.&nbsp; My older son has also gone to the church basement site-- soon to be no more-- and they took him out for walks, they had access to a yard....<br /><br />I like that the rooms are separated by age and developmental stage.&nbsp; I like that they have a &quot;curriculum&quot; and have themes.&nbsp; I like that they have a structure to the day and stick to it (in general).&nbsp; The teachers that my kids have had so far have been great.&nbsp; The few that I thought did not look like they enjoyed their work did not last very long.<br /><br />There is, may I say, some &quot;brusqueness&quot; by some of the directors.&nbsp; I just let it roll, as I feel that they have my kids best interest at heart.&nbsp; I have witnessed a melt-down or two (not in front of kids).&nbsp; But, having worked as a speech therapist in head starts, preschools and public schools, I have seen many a melt down by staff!&nbsp; <br /><br />Last year, I heard a few rumors about the place that turned out not to be true......so I&#039;m cautious, but....I hope that if there are any problems that parents should know about, you&#039;ll let us know.....<br /><br />thanks!<br /><br />

				My name is Ms. Rodamis and I would like to clarify this previous posting. We have been up and&nbsp; running since 2008.&nbsp; We have also seen&nbsp; many children flourish in our environment which is kept very clean&nbsp; and is also state of the art. We provide dance once a week.&nbsp; &nbsp;All our staff is licensed and we are fully licensed by DOHMH.&nbsp; In fact we provide free UPK services and our head teacher has a master&#039;s degree in Early Childhood.&nbsp; I am the Director and hold a B.A. in Sociology with a concentration in Psychology.&nbsp; We foster an environment that is conducive to learning. We follow all guidelines by DOHMH and DOE of NYC. We comply to all the rules and regulations set by the state.&nbsp;
