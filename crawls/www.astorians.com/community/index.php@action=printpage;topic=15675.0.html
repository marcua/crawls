				All time fave is Trattoria L&#039;incontro.&nbsp; Excellent food and they never rush you out.&nbsp; They also have a nice wine bar next door which is a nice place to lounge before and after your meal.

				Depending on the type you want, either Vesta or Michael Angelo&#039;s. Michael Angelo&#039;s has backyard seating that can definitely accommodate your group and it is excellent traditional Italian American food (try the Sophia Loren pizza, gnocchi, eggplant parm, veal parm, and smoked salmon in a pink cream sauce). Vesta you will definitely need to make reservations for since it is not very big, but they have the best service is Astoria and the food is amazing. Their menu rotates, but features local greenmarket produce. I just had the new eggplant pizza there yesterday and almost wept for joy it was so good (only slight hyperbole&nbsp; :mrgreen:). Vesta is also a wine bar where you can order wine by the shot, glass, or bottle - their motto is you should never pay for a full glass of wine without knowing what you are getting. At the end of it, at either place you will get amazing food, be treated well, and have a great time.

				I 3rd Trattoria L&#039;incontro.&nbsp; <br /><br />There&#039;s also Piccola Venezia located on 42nd Street and 28th Ave.&nbsp; Think old school Italian atmosphere, generous portions, and Valet parking as well.<br />www.piccola-venezia.com &nbsp;(http://www.piccola-venezia.com) <br />

				And Piccola is really Istrian/Croatian.&nbsp; And I would probably describe L&#039;Incontro as more European Continental and Vesta more Italian influenced.&nbsp; <br /><br />But isn&#039;t that normal?&nbsp; Considering we&#039;re not in Italy - aren&#039;t all our restaurants merely influenced by the place where the chef or original owner either emigrated from or was trained?&nbsp; I think almost all ethnic restaurants try in one way or another to please a more Amercan palate.&nbsp; Anyway, so far I think all of the suggestions are very good ones.&nbsp; And there are many more.&nbsp; I think Apicus is very good and underrated.&nbsp; Nothing like a L&#039;Incontro experience.&nbsp; But good in its own right.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never been, but people tell us that Punta Dura is also very good.

				Trattoria is excellent and the best. If you want to impress your friends, take them there as it&#039;s a fancy place. Make a reservation though.<br /><br />Michaelangelo&#039;s is decent italian food, with a nice backyard. If you want something casual, this would be a good spot.

				If you want to venture into LIC I would also recommend DaGianni on Vernon Blvd.&nbsp; Great food, friendly staff and they also have outdoor seating in their backyard.

				Trattoria L&#039;Incontro for sure but....<br /><br />What about the Italian food at Hellgate Bar on 21st Ave near 21 St.?&nbsp; &nbsp;REALLY REALLY good food and fresh ingredients, freshly made.<br />Not the same food as l&#039;incontro, or the same environment but you gotta try it!<br /><br />Melissa
