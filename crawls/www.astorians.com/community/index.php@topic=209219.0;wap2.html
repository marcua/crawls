			Support the performing arts in Queens - come for an evening of storytelling at Terraza 7 (40-19 Gleane Street off of 83rd and Roosevelt) the third Monday of every month. Our next show is on Monday, 10/21 at 7pm. You&#039;ll hear true, personal stories from master storytellers. This month features Vernon Payne, David Lawson and Bridget O&#039;Neill. And we&#039;ll be serving empanadas from La Gran Uraguaya Bakery. They go great with the draught beer made in Queens!
