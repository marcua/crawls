				So I&#39;ve been here 4 years - still haven&#39;t found myself an OB/GYN and the GP that I was thrilled with (took me 3 years to find her) is moving out of state. <br /><br />Help!!<br /><br />I would be great to find wonderful doctors IN Astoria.&nbsp; But I&#39;ll take a Doctor who has an office between here and Forest Hills or here and Central Park.&nbsp; If you have any recommendations please do share.&nbsp; I prefer women.&nbsp; And I also prefer doctors who incorporate (or are at least open to) Eastern Medicine as well as Western.&nbsp; I have GHI insurance so if you know that a doctor accepts GHI...&nbsp; *bonus points*<br /><br />While I&#39;m here... what about hospitals.&nbsp; If I was having an emergency... where would I go?? Rumor has it that our local hospital (I don&#39;t even know the name) isn&#39;t too well equipped.&nbsp; <br /><br />Locals - please help out us newbies with some information on the local medical situation.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I know it&#39;s a bit far away, but I go to Beth Israel Ambulatory Center.&nbsp; I see a doctor at Gramercy Park Physicians, located in the ambulatory center.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been thrilled with the quality of care I&#39;ve received there.&nbsp; But I don&#39;t know what kind of insurance they accept.

				I would highly recommend Downtown Women.&nbsp; But they don&#39;t accept your insurance, so that&#39;s not great.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#39;ve been going there for years and they&#39;re all women, which is important to me.&nbsp; I always get in when there&#39;s a problem right away, which is also important.&nbsp; They have a web site - http://www.downtownwomen.com/&nbsp; Very friendly and knowledgeable women, open to alternative techniques.<br /><br />I don&#39;t have a fave primary care doctor yet, but I found a good dentist, can post that up later if you want it.&nbsp; I don&#39;t see any docs in Astoria, but not for a really good enough reason other than it&#39;s not convenient for me since I work in manattan, and manhattan real estate is pricier so you might get a better level of care depending on the location. But that&#39;s very much a stereotype.<br /><br />This probably wasn&#39;t too helpful&nbsp; :-(&nbsp; Sorry about that.

				I recommend Dr. Tom at Family Dentistry, right above the Commerce Bank on 31st Street at Ditmars Blvd. I&#39;ve never been to a better dentist EVER. He&#39;s just a really good guy, and no, I don&#39;t get kickbacks. I seriously love that guy.

				I go to the Queens/Long Island Medical Center on Broadway and 23rd Street.&nbsp; Its one of those large centers with all sorts of doctors, cardiologists on one day, prostate specialists on another, but general practioners all the time.&nbsp; I see Dr. Batra and he is great!&nbsp; One day the nurses there said he had an emergency and he was leaving, but then when he saw me he let me come in for a quick check up.&nbsp; Although the wait is long sometimes (up to an hour) he listens and doesn&#39;t just prescribe antibiotics for everything.<br /><br />My GYN is there too - he&#39;s a male but extremely sensitive.&nbsp; He told me about the problems with the birth control patch b/f all the problems started being reported and made sure I started on something else.&nbsp; I know you prefer women, but men can be just as good if you get the right one.&nbsp; His name is Dr. Hleap.<br /><br />I believe they take GHI - but here is their website:&nbsp; http://www.qlimg.com/allcenters.html.<br /><br />There are also labs and x-ray technicians in the same building which means you can just pop on over and don&#39;t have to make a seperate appt.<br /><br />Alright, if you have questions, I&#39;d be happy to answer them.

				Oh word of caution- the Queens Mt. Sinai hospital on 30th Avenue and Crescent is a disaster!!! I made my husband promise me that unless I was dying- to not take me there! It is dirty, the waiting room is a disaster and the three people who I know who had been admitted there all say it was a horrible experience!!! My husband had surgery in Flushing- I can&#39;t remember the name of the hospital off the top of my head- but it was clean and very professional.

				I think if I got a bee sting, burn or sprained anything I still wouldn&#39;t go there!

				Fortunately I have not had much experience with hospitals myself. I would say if I was in a position where I needed to go to a hospital I would return to the hospital in Flushing where my husband had surgery this past winter. It was clean, the medical staff was very helpful, and it was only about a 15 minute car ride. The name of the hospital is New York Hospital-Queens. <br /><br /><br />

				I have never been a patient there- but my sister used to work at North Shore University Hospital and my niece works there now and they both say it is an excellent hospital. It is a little further away- but if you aren&#39;t in an emergency type of situation it would be worth considering. It is located in Manhasset- LI which is&nbsp; about a 25-30 minute drive (without traffic).

				I recommend Dr. Freya Marone at Astoria Medical Group. (25-35 31st Avenue, Astoria, Tel 718-274-2600). She was highly recommended to me two years ago by an Astoria friend who had a serious medical emergency and landed in the hospital. Dr. Marone is an internest and I use her as my GP. Through her, I now have a (grandfatherly male) GYN and an excellent dermatologist there. Last summer I also had a colonoscopy there which was provided by a specialist. The physical environment is homey, 60&#39;s or 70&#39;s era but I love the small size of it. They accept GHI. <br /><br />Dentist: Check out Spyridon Katehis, DDS at 30-89 36th Street, bet. 31st and 30th. (718-278-4419. I went there in a semi-emergency (broken tooth, filling half out) and he capped it. Now go there regularly.

				If you don&#39;t have insurance, the Ryan Center (http://www.ryancenter.org/) is pretty good. The location I go to is kind of inconvenient, but my OB/GYN is great, my prescriptions are $7 and though I pay out of pocket it&#39;s on a sliding scale, and less than half what I would be charged in a regular office.<br /><br />

				I&#39;ve never just walked in - I always call for an appointment - I generally have to wait, but it&#39;s not too bad.<br /><br />So far all the doctors I&#39;ve used there have been nice and ok - I think most of them are probably residents, but they will refer you to other doctors if your problem is not managed by anyone in the clinic. Sometimes, to keep the price low, you have to put up with a lot of red tape and bullsh*t, but if it&#39;s not an emergency I can just be patient and put up with stuff. <br /><br />I&#39;ve only been to an emergency room once, and it was slow but the care was excellent and things were pretty clean. So I&#39;m not sure I can make a judicious comparison ... pricewise, however, it&#39;s *definitely* better than the ER.<br />

				All of my docs are with Cornell Medical Center. After going to alot of other docs in the city, Queens, Brookyn and NJ, I couldn&#39;t be happier with the Cornell docs. They are top-notch. I&#39;ve had a long medical history and I had complications during pregnancy and I wouldn&#39;t have wanted to go anywhere else. I know that they charged the ins. alot of money, but if you are covered, go there. During some of my stays, I noticed that they were transferring in patients from other hospitals that couldn&#39;t handle their care needs.

				Hands Down - North Shore OB/GYN.&nbsp; No, they are not in Astoria but they are worth the ride into Bayside.&nbsp; Also, they are right across the street from Bay Terrace shopping center.&nbsp; What better time to go shopping then right after a gynecological exam.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Seriously, I work for a doctor here in Astoria and all of the girls in my office travel in to Bayside to see this wonderful group of Doctors.&nbsp; My personal favorites are Randi Rothstein, MD (she delivered my daughter) and Richard Herzog, MD.&nbsp; He was great, as well.&nbsp; Their phone number is 718 224-5800

They are somewhat personal, so I will understand if you prefer not to answer.<br /><br />1) What was the nature of the emergency? (i.e., respiratory, undefined pain, bleeding, etc.)<br />2) Were you admitted? If so, what floor?<br />3) Was your personal physician attending?<br />4) What time of day did you enter the ER?<br />5) What day of the week did you enter the ER?<br /><br />I live across the street from Mt. Sinai. I&#39;ve often wondered if I would allow myself to be transported there for a dire emergency considering the way I feel about their staff and the facility in general. <br /><br />A few months ago I called a local cab service to take me to NY Hospital Queens (the old Booth Memorial) on Main Street in Flushing, and was admitted thru the ER. I spent 10 days there and got prodded and poked and stabbed all over! The fact that my personal physician has admitting privileges there, and that I saw him twice a day, gave&nbsp; me a real comfort zone. All I vividly remember about the experience was the joy juice they kept pumping into my arm!<br /><br />

				I totally disrecommend QLIMG.&nbsp; They make you wait one hour or even two, just to see a doctor who won&#39;t hear you long enough for you to describe your symptoms.&nbsp; Sometimes you wait 1 or 2 hours just so the PCP can refer you to a specialist, because the rules say he has to be the gatekeeper.&nbsp; That&#39;s a lot of wasted sick leave.&nbsp; And even during the long wait, you can&#39;t catch up on your reading because the administrator has turned the waiting rooms into TV theaters.<br /><br />My PCP flatly refused to let my eyes be examined by an ophthalmologist, even tho I begged him.&nbsp; But my eyesight was failing, and I had to get some expensive glasses.&nbsp; Then even the glasses weren&#39;t doing much good.&nbsp; But it so happens that the optometrist also has the authority to refer you to an ophthalmologist, and when I finally got to see the eye doctor he said I had VERY BIG CATARACTS.&nbsp; Fortunately there are good specialists associated with QLIMG and I got very good cataract surgery from a first-rate ophthalmic surgeon, Dr. Stephen Haug.<br /><br />So occasionally I get lucky.&nbsp; But in the balance, QLIMG sucks, or at least HIP sucks.&nbsp; I want to change my plan in October, when my employer lets me.<br /><br />

Knew he was a PA -- that&#39;s how he introduced himself, and that&#39;s what was on his coat. Other thing I thought was odd -- three of us were put into the treatment room at the same time -- we were pretty much on top of each other, the curtains weren&#39;t pulled close and everyone knew everyone else&#39;s business (I found out all about the unfortunate fellow in the bed next to me who got bit by a snake... on his hip).

A subject in which I am an expert! I&#39;ve had bilateral total hip replacements, bilateral total knee replacements and various joints in both my hands either totally replaced or arthoscopically repaired. And oh, yes, I&#39;ve also had a bilateral Carpel Tunnel Repair.<br /><br />If your health insurance will cover you, find a doctor at the Hospital For Special Surgery. The place is like a freaking spa<strong>*</strong>. The doctors are all Board Certified in more than one sub-speciality. One of my orthopaedic surgeons sub-specializes in hipsâ€”just hips. Another in knees. Yet a third in spines.<br /><br />My hand surgeon is the love of my life. When 4 other doctors tried to convince me that I just *had* to live with (practically) useless hands, he used FDA approved, self-made and designed surgical tools and gave me back my life. He has subsequently retired, but he left a staff of physicians behind who use his methods. This hospital is innovative in their approach to both pain and numbness, but they pay special attention to those clicking soundsâ€”or as was explained to meâ€”those tell-tale noises in our bodies that mean something is wrong and should be fixed before it becomes something big(ger).<br /><strong><br />*</strong>It is crappy enough to be in a hospital, no matter the circumstances. HSS makes you feel like you are in one of those very expensive resort-type spas. The staff is warm, friendly and very responsive. The meals are fabulousâ€”and when you are able to get aroundâ€”they are served in an atrium with a view of the river. I dread being thrown back in a hospital, but I do so with a little comfort zone when I know I will be staying at The Hospital &amp; Spa For Special Surgery!

				i have a friend who LOVES his GP up by ditmars.&nbsp; i will find that out and reply here, too.&nbsp; <br /><br />for now, i have a suggestion for your GYN care.&nbsp; there&#39;s a WONDERFUL!!!!! group of midwives that practice by columbus circle (yes, a hike, but worth it)&nbsp; and they happen to take GHI.&nbsp; the practice is called &quot;midwifery of manhattan&quot;&nbsp; they are very conscientious providers and give great care.&nbsp; a first visit with be 30-60 minutes of actual visit time, and they will give you time and space to voice any issues or concerns.&nbsp; they don&#39;t take my insurance anymore, so i am heart-broken.&nbsp; i just try to get as many other people to go to them as i can.&nbsp; if you do call for an appointment, try to see laura (she only works thursdays)&nbsp; if not, the other midwives are great, too.<br /><br />in case you&#39;re wondering why i&#39;m suggesting midwives-- they&#39;re not just for babies.&nbsp; they give very holistic care to women throughout the life cycle.&nbsp; so, i hope that&#39;s up your alley.<br /><br />good luck!

				I just found this website -&nbsp; <br /><br />RateMds (http://ratemds.com/filecache/SelectDoctor.jsp?sid=35) <br /><br />Wish I&#039;d known about it last year when I started seeing the crazy lady that many others could have told me to steer clear from. <br /><br />

				*bump*<br /><br />I figured I would find a previous post for doctors, instead of starting yet another thread!&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, I just back from seeing Dr. Oo at Steinway Medical Associates (31-80 41st Street between B&#039;way and 31st Avenue, on the west side of the street - 1-718-278-5116) and I have to say that I really liked him.&nbsp; As of today, he is officially my PCP.&nbsp; Without getting into any personal details, I was a bit nervous about visiting any physician (I&#039;ve never been a big fan of doctor visits anyway), but Dr. Oo was very understanding and really put my fears at my ease.&nbsp; I look forward to having him as my doctor.
