				Until last night, Prince was a favorite of mine. Not the best Indian I&#039;d ever had, but certainly very good, and quick. A few weeks ago I noticed they raised their prices, and I actually thought &quot;well done you Prince, supply and demand.&quot; And I got my combo plate and went home. <br /><br />I sent a friend last week, they had yet to try it and went on my recommendation. The report was that things were &#039;ho-hum&#039;, so i thought I&#039;d go last night to see what was up.<br /><br />I ordered my usual: chicken tikka masala and saag paneer combo plate and it was Not. Good. The rice was dry and crumbly. And very oily (yes, dry and oily at the same time). The chicken and the saag were both flavorless at best. <br /><br />It makes me sad. I was really hoping for a Ditmars takeaway Indian that would be both quick and tasty, but I guess that the honeymoon with Prince is over.<br />
