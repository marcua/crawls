				I&#039;m a relatively recent college grad (5 yrs) and live near ditmars. love the neighborhood. although there is a pretty good local bar scene (primarily by broadway), i think most people hang out in the city as the commute is very short. i personally like the ditmars side better as it alittle quieter, but still has a ton of restaurants, and is close to the park.

				From 36th Avenue on the N/W, which I used to live at, you could make it to 49th Street in fifteen minutes.&nbsp; I would add a couple of minutes to each stop as you head north (Broadway, 30th Avenue, Astoria Boulevard, and Ditmars)&nbsp; Please note that I am counting from the time that you get on the train and it&#039;s actually in motion. In my experience (I worked off of the 49th St. stop for a combined 3 to 4 years) and I did not take account for your walk to the train, etc.&nbsp; I was fortunate because I lived about a block away from the 36th Avenue stop. <br /><br />

				I of course have to pimp the Ditmars stop. Having a seat is nice. When I worked in midtown, it would take me 30 minutes to get to work door to door (including my 10 minute walk to the train). My commute downtown is now 45-50 minutes, door to door. It&#039;s totally worth it. My roommates and I also all graduated college about a year ago...and I tend to run into quite a few people in the same boat in the area. I recommend checking out the threads in the Restaurants &amp; Food portion of this site.

				Hi, <br />We live in Astoria near Steinway/Broadway and are considering moving to Ditmars--near 20th ave in the 30s. I know that it&#039;s more residential. This is sort of a weird question but I would love to hear how others perceive the difference between the two areas. I&#039;ve also noticed that people who live around us are a bit dismissive of the lower ditmars area and I wonder if anyone can explain why. They seem very similar in terms of population. <br /><br />I hope this doesn&#039;t seem like a bizarre, unfocused query. <br /><br />thanks!

				Heeeey, you&#039;d totally be my neighbor if you moved (I live on Steinway near 21 Av.)<br /><br />Ok. This is why I like it better up here (and yes, we&#039;re north of you guys, despite the bizarre fact that the avenues go down in numbers as you get further north, and the streets go lower in numbers as you go west - seriously, everything about us is opposite of Manhattan, hahah...)<br /><br />Anyway. I like it up here since (and I realize a lot of these have to do with owning a car/driving, don&#039;t know if that&#039;s a factor for you) its quieter and cleaner but still distinctly Astoria, you always get a seat on the N/W and the train never expresses past us (since we&#039;re the last stop), also there is almost always a train waiting so if its snowing/raining/hot/cold, you don&#039;t have to stand out on the platform, it feels more neighborhoody (to me, anyway, but that may be because I&#039;ve been here for 2 years), its closer to the bridges and the GCP for when you need to leave the city, the traffic isn&#039;t as crazy, its easier to park up here, we have Best Yet (supermarket), Ditmars Gyro Place (YUM!), Thai Elephant (DOUBLE YUM!), its about a 15 minute walk to Astoria Park, that new place that everyone&#039;s talking about (http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=6733.0) that I haven&#039;t gotten around to checking out yet is here, and a whole bunch of other things that I can&#039;t really think of at the moment.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know that I would live in the Broadway/Steinway area. Too busy and loud for me, and I can&#039;t imagine finding a parking spot is any fun. The Q101 will get me to that area anyway in under 10 minutes if I need to get down there. I guess I&#039;d live there if I had a garage/driveway. Up here, I usually get a spot either right out front or around the corner on 20th Rd.

				so you are a potential neighbor!<br /><br />We do have a car and have many awful experiences parking in our current area. parking seems SO much easier in your part. Good to hear. That is my impression too. I know it&#039;s lower than where we are (I read a post about a sewer smell) and nearer the industrial area (which I guess is not so good). <br /><br />When I had my first child it was late fall and I used to walk for hours with her in the stroller and I always went&nbsp; to Ditmars. Just crossing Astoria blvd and into this quieter, calmer area was really nice. We had just moved to this neighborhood and I would tell my husband about the &quot;bizarro astoria&quot; on the other side of astoria blvd, where there were these big train tracks and little houses and not so many apt buildings. I always liked it.<br /><br />We&#039;ll probably move there.. we&#039;re buying and it&#039;s the first time and we are FReAKING OUT.&nbsp;

				Hillary 10,<br /><br />Allison is absolutely right on all accounts. &nbsp;I think Ditmars (around 20th ave) is prettier than the Broadway area. &nbsp;There are a lot more trees and gardens which makes for a nice walk home. &nbsp;Since it is less crowded, the average walk home can be very relaxing. &nbsp;If you are walking home late at night, you can actually hear the sound of nothing. &nbsp;Having grown up in a relatively rural area, its nice to hear occasionally. &nbsp;It is also much closer to Astoria Park. &nbsp;When I lived on Broadway, it took me about 1/2 hour to walk to Astoria park. &nbsp;I now live 2 blocks from the park. &nbsp;Since the Ditmars area is less crowded, you tend to get to know your neighbors and shop keepers. &nbsp;In my experience I know more of my neighbors and local business owns around Ditmars than I did around Broadway. &nbsp;I&#039;m sure other people on the board have had different experiences but this is what I found. &nbsp;<br /><br />I found that Broadway had more choices when it came to bars, grocery stores and laundromats. There are still a ton of places to eat around Ditmars. &nbsp;My favorites are Fatty&#039;s/Crescent &amp; Vine, Anna&#039;s Corner and Mezzo. &nbsp;Also expect to lengthen your train rides into Manhatten by about 15mins. &nbsp;Ditmars bound N/W trains have a habit of stopping and waiting at Astoria Blvd for anywhere between 2 to 15 mins. &nbsp; Keep in mind that 20th Ave west of 21st St gets to be a very long walk to the train. &nbsp;You almost need a car for your chores (almost).<br /><br />I hope this helps.

				oh, you mean lower elevation-wise? The stank smell isn&#039;t CONSTANT, but it definitely rears its stanky head in the summer, occasionally. I haven&#039;t figured out a pattern to it yet though. Its annoying, but it won&#039;t make you want to tear your nose off or anything. Either way, welcome to the north of Astoria Boulevard &#039;hood :)<br /><br />The industrial area doesn&#039;t bother me at all - but I grew up in a place where there&#039;s a lot of abandoned factories and whatnot, so it&#039;s pretty normal for me. The only *really* annoying thing to me about the industrial area is the trucks on Steinway. They pretty much stick to Steinway (to get to the BQE). So I&#039;m occasionally woken up at 6am to the lovely sounds of blaring 18-wheeler horns when people double park and they can&#039;t get through. But now that its supa-hot (and I have the AC or a fan running), I don&#039;t hear them when I&#039;m sleeping, and if you&#039;re in the 30s, you probably won&#039;t even notice them.

				I love that I always get a seat at Ditmars and that the train runs express sometimes.....<br /><br />BUT I must say that almost every day/night you will be sitting on the train somewhere between 30th Ave, Astoria Blvd, and Ditmars waiting for a train in front of you to move out of the station. It can be very frustrating and in my experience lasts anywhere from 30 seconds to 15 minutes!<br /><br />Other than that, it&#039;s great!&nbsp; 8-)

				Ditmars appears to be changing every day.&nbsp; We&#039;re getting lots of new stores and restaurants.&nbsp; Funny thing, we don&#039;t have a Euro cafe.&nbsp; I guess 30 Ave is Cafe Row.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived all over Astoria and each one has its advantages.&nbsp; But I can tell you this - my apartment at 20Ave and 27St is the quietest area of Astoria I&#039;ve ever lived in.&nbsp; It&#039;s so green it&#039;s like coming home to the country.&nbsp; And since you have a car - the lower on Ditmars you go, after Steinway, the bigger the homes, and the nicer/bigger the yards!&nbsp; It&#039;s total suburbia back there, I love it!

				my boyfriend and i lived on 31st ave at steinway for a year. we just moved to 23rd ave in the 30&#039;s and i&#039;ve got to say that the ditmars area is much nicer for us. not as crowded and dirty as steinway, and i find the same amenities (except for the cafe&#039;s, which for us is a plus). its much more of a neighborhood vibe, less larger buildings and more 2 and 3 family homes.&nbsp; and you will be very close to the Best Yet Supermarket on 37th and 20th ave, which is great (it even has a real parking lot.. almost like the burbs).<br /><br />being able to walk to the park is a major plus, as well as being much quieter than steinway.<br />

				I agree with what everyone has said on here so far.&nbsp; I&#039;m on 21st Ave in the mid-30&#039;s and my talk to the train is between 5-6 minutes (depending on speed).&nbsp; As Daisy said, it&#039;s so quiet that you feel like you are in the &#039;burbs yet a block away (for me) there is everything Ditmars has to offer!<br /><br />Welcome to our neck of the woods!

				Ditmars rocks.&nbsp; That&#039;s not to put off central and lower Astoria (although I have not spent much time in lower except at Kaufmann -- but will now try Sunswick&#039;s too).&nbsp; I do frequent central astoria (C&amp;P&#039;s, the Rover, the cafe&#039;s on 30th, etc..), bit there is nothing like the homey feeling of strolling down Ditmars to the park, eating at the many local establishments too numerous to count, and getting a seat in the morning on the way to work.&nbsp; Ditmars is a good choice, welcome.

				I echo Alison on just about all counts, seriously, since I also live on Steinway by 21st Ave (and hear the same trucks in the morning...grr).<br /><br />I used to live on Broadway and 29th.&nbsp; I really liked all the restaurants in the area (especially the falafel cart on 30th and Bway - I still drive back there every few weeks), and I enjoyed getting home a touch earlier from the city, but I&#039;ve lived in this area for 4 years now and wouldn&#039;t go back to the Broadway area.&nbsp; This area feels more like a family neighborhood to me than the Broadway area.&nbsp; It&#039;s safe, street parking is way, way easier (I used to spend upwards of 30 minutes looking for spots at night near Broadway), and yeah, you always get a seat on the train.&nbsp; Plus, I can&#039;t explain it, but there&#039;s something really wonderful about the cobblestone-ish Ditmars/31st St intersection.<br /><br />You&#039;ll love it here!

				I was just walking around Ditmars today and the difference from 30th ave (where I&#039;ve been a couple years) hit me more than usual. I guess it&#039;s because all the cafebars are in full swing now with the warm (hot) weather. I would like&nbsp; to move up there, away from the cafe madness, but hmm I wonder how much rents have jumped since I got my current place 2.5 years ago...

				I agree with NYCMacUser. I am a female that regularly comes home to Astoria after 10PM, but I live very close to the train. I would not want to walk that far out at night. You&#039;ll find that the further you get away from the train station, the fewer people will be walking around you. Chances are you&#039;ll be walking that stretch alone most nights, and the distance between blocks is long. I would definitely advise against it.

				There are so many better and safer areas of Astoria than 12th St.&nbsp; Even during the day, that area can look very sketchy.&nbsp; I would keep shopping, you have so many better areas to be looking in.

				In general, I&#039;ve always felt pretty safe in Astoria.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived here 10 years, and pretty much know the area in and out.&nbsp; But it is the city, and one has to remember that and keep their wits about them.&nbsp; Things do happen, like that woman who was sexually assaulted and robbed just last week along Ditmars.&nbsp; I&#039;m not going to say that as a single woman walking home alone at night, that I haven&#039;t been approached, felt threatened, and been afraid at times on my walks home.&nbsp; At the same time, I&#039;ll be damned if I let that control me and force me to be in by 9pm or walk around with escorts.&nbsp; I do wish I had superpowers :)&nbsp; I love living in Astoria, and if I felt unsafe all the time, I would have moved long ago.<br /><br />As far as ethnic tensions, that&#039;s an interesting question.&nbsp; Anyone?&nbsp; Speaking for myself, I enjoy diversity and it&#039;s one of the things that I love about Astoria.&nbsp; When I do hear slurs, I hear it from old men and women, the Old Guard, whose minds are long set, and whose are not going to change.&nbsp; I ignore them.&nbsp; But I realize there are tensions with the younger generation too, I just don&#039;t think it&#039;s that different from anywhere else.&nbsp; Interesting question though.

				Thanks, Daisy.&nbsp; I guess I asked the ethnic tension part of the question because I&#039;m moving back from Chicago.&nbsp; Although Chitown is far, far more segregated than Gotham is (unfortunately, because otherwise Chicago is a great town), you rarely hear racial/ethnic/orientation-related slurs on the street.&nbsp; Walking through Astoria this past week, I heard a few (I experienced the same thing neighborhood-scoping in Harlem).&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s always been this way back home in NYC and my time away made me forget?&nbsp; I dunno.&nbsp; But this is probably my biggest concern about Astoria.&nbsp;

				I would like to hear other people&#039;s experience with this, especially those who may have experienced or heard slurs. &nbsp;My only direct experience with this was at a restaurant, Telly&#039;s Taverna, where I and my party were made fun of due to our Latin heritage. &nbsp;I must stress though, that this was over 5 years ago, and I haven&#039;t experienced such things at any restaurant since then. &nbsp;Racial/ethnic slurs must still happen, but I don&#039;t think and would hope it wasn&#039;t prevalent. &nbsp;But I am light-skinned and can pass for Greek and am part Italian, so I realize I am not the best person to speak of this. &nbsp;There is a large gay community here as well. &nbsp;What has their experience been? &nbsp;

				I&#039;ve never heard or seen people using slang that I thought was directed at someone in a violent or openly hostile way.

				I guess this question is geard towards the ladies. How many blocks would you say is too far to walk to and from a train station at night, say after or around 10 p.m.?&nbsp; I&#039;m looking to move to the area and was wondering if a seven minute walk to the N or R train is relatively safe.&nbsp; I&#039;ve noticed that some of the blocks tend to be a tad long...It&#039;s around 30th I think...<br /><br />thanks!

				If you are doing most of the walking on one of our well-lit avenues, you should feel fairly safe. If it is on one of the odd-numbered avenues, that are not as well-lit, not as much commercial foot traffic, I would say 5–7 blocks. I am also assuming the 1 block walk down a street to get to your apartment.

				Come to think of it, I&#039;m not 100% sure...lol.

				I think it entirely depends on the area and yeah, whether or not you&#039;re comfortable with walking that far. &nbsp;I live on 27th St near 20 Ave, an area I like to call the Boonies. &nbsp;It&#039;s a 10 minute walk to the train at Ditmars, but I stick to the main drag 31St at night, and then walk along the Avenue til I get to my street. &nbsp; It is a very residential area, lots of grass and trees, lots of houses. &nbsp;I like the walk because it&#039;s peaceful and leaves me to my thoughts. &nbsp;The area is generally safe, although I won&#039;t kid myself, it is desolate as soon as you leave 31 St and walk away towards 29th St (this is East?), especially after 10pm. &nbsp;And a girl did get assaulted just a couple weeks ago in my area. &nbsp;So yeah, it&#039;s dissettling to say the least, but I think things like that can happen anywhere, &nbsp;and the best most of us can do, is keep our wits about us, pay attention to what&#039;s going on around us, and possibly take some self-defense courses. &nbsp;Or hire a bodyguard :) &nbsp;Take a walk around, take a walk around at night, see how the area makes you feel. &nbsp;There is a distinct difference between my area and the area past 21st near 12 St and Astoria Blvd. &nbsp;I would choose my area any day.<br /><br />The 30th Avenue area is pretty nice in my opinion.

				Wow. I was quite stunned by the vehement responses from people who mostly have never even been to this area. Yeah, it looks a little rough, but as a resident of Welling Ct. for 6 years, I have to say that appearances are deceiving. I do live with my family, and have a car, so I don&#039;t tend to walk home late at night - I think a woman should be careful about that anywhere in Astoria. But please don&#039;t slam Welling Ct. Here are some great things about it: <br />Every Dec. 11th, the residents throw a big street party to celebrate the Feast of the Virgin of Guadalupe, invite everyone on the block, serve great Mexican food, and we all have a good time. <br />The Gotham Girls Roller Derby team rehearses in a warehouse at the end of the block. <br />We&#039;re two blocks from the Socrates Sculpture Park, the Noguchi Museum, Astoria Park and free Kayaking on the river on Sundays. <br />Several of my neighbors and I are planning a block party soon. We&#039;re going to get a permit to close off the street, have a big BBQ and invite everyone to join a block association. <br />There are many historic homes on the block, and there&#039;s a movement going on here for everyone to fix up them up and it&#039;s catching on. <br />Anyway, yeah, people do refer to the block as &quot;Little Mexico,&quot; but my only response to that is: Viva Mexico!

				If you&#039;re going to be walking out there from the train alone at night on a regular basis, you might want to try that one time before committing. I almost moved to a nice place in Brooklyn, but I knew I&#039;d be coming home after 10 every night. So I tried that one time in that neighborhood, and boy was that awful. Something I love about living on Ditmars near the train is I can come home at almost any time and it&#039;s always well lit, and people get off the train and walk around me until I get home. I don&#039;t know what Newtown and 23rd-21st would be like in that respect.

				I walk down Newtown from 30th Avenue to 21st street almost every day, at all times of the day and night, and have never even felt uncomfortable.&nbsp; 21st can be sketchy once you go south of 30th Avenue, but walking down Newtown is great.&nbsp; I&#039;ve actually been hoping to find an apartment in that area.&nbsp; And you&#039;d be in walking distance of Trade Fair on 30th &amp; 31st, which is the best grocery store I&#039;ve been to in Astoria.<br />I think that your apartment will be near 2 schools, so there may be noise early in the morning, but probably not any problems walking home at dark.

				Honestly, the best favor you can do yourself is to make sure that you find an apartment close to one of the train stations and a laundromat and grocery store.&nbsp; Get a copy of the Not For Tourists guide for Astoria and that should help.&nbsp; Also, there are other broker recommendations in this sticky thread: http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=2913.0.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t like where you wind up, there&#039;s always next year.

				Honestly, yes, I think Astoria has a lot of young people and old people.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always thought of it as fun.&nbsp; I moved here 10 years ago straight out of college, and I love it here.&nbsp; My friends love it here.&nbsp; I went to school in Greenwich Village for 4 years and Astoria reminded me of the village because there was a lot to do and there were a lot of young diverse people around.&nbsp; Sure, there are not as many punkrockers or bohemians, but that&#039;s not what I was looking for.&nbsp; It was what I could afford, there was stuff to do and young people in the area, and it was extremely convenient to the city.&nbsp; After my first year here, I moved out to Rego Park for one year.&nbsp; I could not stay another, it was full, literally full, of old people.&nbsp; I called it Florida without the palm trees.&nbsp; There was nothing to do, and I had to go to Manhattan or Astoria for everything.&nbsp; I felt very out of place.&nbsp; I came running back to Astoria when my lease was up, and haven&#039;t left since.&nbsp; It&#039;s the perfect mix of young and old, families, and neighborhood feel.&nbsp; And I have a lot of fun here, to the point where I don&#039;t have to go to the city on the weekends for socializing, and where when friends visit from out of town, we can stay local for activities.&nbsp; Astoria can please everyone,&nbsp; and that&#039;s what I love about it.<br /><br />Williamsburg might be full of young people, but there are families that have lived there a long time as well.&nbsp; But it&#039;s definitely a lot more expensive than Astoria is, although Astoria is catching up fast.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are deals to be had everywhere, but brokers are always reluctant to show you them.&nbsp; It really is luck of the draw.

				These young men might enjoy living in the Vernon/Jackson part of LIC, too.&nbsp; Up and coming area, a lot of nice buildings, very close to the city (Midtown) There are places on the east side that would probably fit their bill for fun, like Murray Hill or even the East Village.<br /><br />Different people have different ideas of what &quot;fun&quot; is, though.&nbsp; Guys, what do you consider to be &quot;fun&quot;?&nbsp; What are you looking to do in your time off?

				I dunno, there are many great things about Astoria, but there seems to me to be amazingly little overlap between &quot;modern day&quot; Williamsburg and Astoria. Astoria (and most of Queens AFAIK, except moreso LIC day by day) is decidedly &quot;un-hip&quot;. Of course a great many people probably celebrate that fact daily and will groan very loudly here if it ever changes (they already do groan about it on these very boards and may even pile on since I mentioned the &quot;h-word&quot;), but at this point someone who likes the &#039;burg will probably not like Astoria as much. And vice versa. That&#039;s my guess.

				I agree with TAG.&nbsp; I was just in Williamsburg for class tonight and the thing that always gets me is how everyone kind of looks the same (gelled hair, raggedy clothes that probably cost more than most of our salaries, etc.)<br /><br />In my walk to and from the train (several blocks each way) I did not see any families (ie strollers) and what possibly bothered me the most is that I can count on one hand how many people I saw who were not caucasian.&nbsp; When I got back to Astoria the first thing that struck me is what a diverse community we have here and how that really adds to the fabric of the neighbourhood (not just skin colour but people from all walks of life).&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m sure that there are diverse areas of Williamsburg but if you compare Bedford Avenue to a Ditmars/30th/Broadway area you can see the clear differences.

				I agree that Williamsburg and Astoria are extremely different.&nbsp; But there seems to be an assumption that young people who enjoy fun and have money would only enjoy living in Williamsburg.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t think that&#039;s true, and it&#039;s assuming that all young people are interested in the same things.&nbsp; I think there are plenty of young people and fun to be had here.&nbsp; Meg&#039;s right, people have different ideas of what fun is.&nbsp; I remember clearly those days when I was 21, fresh out of college, in my first apartment here, and going out to cafes, bars, and clubs all the time.&nbsp; In Astoria.&nbsp; I loved going out and being able to get drunk locally, stay out late, and stumble on home.&nbsp; I still go out, only now there are even more places to go.&nbsp; I think Astoria can be anything you want it to be.&nbsp; I realize it&#039;s not Williamsburg, but it doesn&#039;t have to be for young people to enjoy it.&nbsp; It just depends on their taste.&nbsp; That&#039;s a question only they will be able to answer.&nbsp;

				Obviously you guys are in a great rush to find a place considering that it&#039;s been only three days since your original post. Being impatient isn&#039;t giving a great impression either, since there are over 2000 members on this site. First of all, look on craigslist http://newyork.craigslist.org/aap/ (http://newyork.craigslist.org/aap/) . Some say it isn&#039;t the best place to look, but it is a great resource. Secondly, I think you aim too high. True Astoria is an up and coming neighborhood, but I wouldn&#039;t call it &quot;fun&quot; in the just-out-of-college sense of the word. Yes it is affordable. Yes it can be inexpensive. Yes there a number of young people here. But fun? That is subjective.<br />You need to give yourselves more time cause you aren&#039;t going to find a place in a weeks time, especially in August. WALK AROUND, A LOT during the day and at night. When I say night I mean after 9 pm, usually that gives you a great idea of a neighborhood. Lastly, good luck!! <br /><br />edit: Take a gander at this: http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/fee/408006803.html (http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/fee/408006803.html) <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				It depends what you want, but when I had to move from Broadway &amp; 32nd in &#039;01 from a 2BR to a 1BR I was moving at exactly the wrong time -- after the &quot;NY Times&quot; ran that piece about what a great place Astoria was to live in and my landlord wanted to raise my rent something like $800 per month.&nbsp; &nbsp;If I didn&#039;t find my 1BR @ 30th &amp; 34th Street I would have turned to Sunnyside, which is close to Manhattan, right on the 7 line and the main reason: it is much cheaper than Astoria.

				yeah, i ended up not taking it. i took a stroll around the block around 10pm a couple of days ago and I did not feel very safe. it&#039;s right on the edge of where the neighborhood gets sketchy. it&#039;s going for $1150. thanks for all the helpful advice!

				hi tad,<br /><br />good choice on picking astoria as the neighborhood to live in.<br /><br />have you nixed that place yet?&nbsp; i live so close to that area, you and i would be neighbors (i&#039;m on newtown at crescent).&nbsp; i am also a single young woman, and have never felt unsafe, (have lived in the area for about two years) but i know what you mean about where it &quot;starts to get sketchy&quot;.&nbsp; comfort is the main issue, and if you think you would be uncomfortable, maybe keep looking.&nbsp; but i wouldn&#039;t call that location unsafe.<br /><br />sounds like a good price, if it&#039;s nice.<br /><br />they just built a new building right next door to me and it looks like the new apartments are going to be REALLY nice.&nbsp; probably crazy expensive, so that doesn&#039;t help anyone.&nbsp; <br /><br />best of luck, tad, please feel free to contact me if you take it.<br /><br />

				Here are my thoughts as a recent small, female college graduate and 1 year resident of Astoria.&nbsp; Things I&#039;ve learned: it&#039;s better to live near the N/W train because it very rarely has service interruptions.&nbsp; The G/R/V trains tend to run terribly on weekends, running express past your stop one way, etc.&nbsp; I did live near the Steinway stop, but when I would come home late at night, I would have to walk 6-8 blocks because the R was never running properly, or was very infrequent.&nbsp; Anyone else have this problem?&nbsp; <br /><br />I have recently moved to Broadway area (one block from the N/W) and LOVE it.&nbsp; I found a huge studio in a private house for $975 in June with no brokers fee on craigslist.&nbsp; If you look good on paper (good job, reliable, good references) it may be easier to find stuff on craigslist for rental by owner-- be persistent, but friendly, and try to give as much info about your character up front.&nbsp; It may have helped that I&#039;m a female, who knows.&nbsp; <br /><br />My first apt in Astoria was a brand new building, which I found more trouble than it was worth.&nbsp; Nothing worked right, and the landlord was crazy.&nbsp; He wanted to pick up rent every month at 9am (and what professionals are home at 9am? Or else very few!)or you had to leave your rent right outside your door where anyone could get it.&nbsp; If you needed repairs, they didn&#039;t have a key, so you had to be there.&nbsp; What a pain!&nbsp; I heard all sorts of crazy stories about the landlord from other tenants (GFE holding Corp- George Eliot- anyone else have problems?) I think he owns lots of buildings--very greedy too.&nbsp; We also had a terrible real estate agent-- Jennifer Liu.&nbsp; Not sure what company she works for.&nbsp; Very pushy and annoying.

				Hi Astorians - <br /><br />I&#039;m checking out some apts in the area tonight, and after reading this trhead, I&#039;m a little concerned about one of them that sounds otherwise perfect on paper. It&#039;s at Broadway and 21st. From what I gather, anywhere west (towards Manhattan) is sketchy. The closet subway is the N/W at Broadway, about 5 blocks away (I assume they&#039;re long blocks). <br /><br />The second apt is at 41st Street and 31st Avenue, right by the Steinway R / V, which, after reading these postings, seems safer. <br /><br />I&#039;m moving from Battery Park, and have lived in the city 5 years, and I&#039;ll be living w/my husband. I guess I just want to know is 21st and B&#039;way a fairly good area, or is it so bad that it should be avoided? <br /><br />And what&#039;s considered the heart of Astoria? <br /><br />Thanks! I&#039;m really looking forward to moving to the neighborhood.

				21 Street and Broadway can be a little more desolate at night, and I personally wouldn&#039;t want to live on that particular corner.&nbsp; There&#039;s not much in that area, not very residential or with restaurants, and I have not enjoyed the walks to Socrates park from there.&nbsp; That being said, I haven&#039;t heard of anything bad going on, except that the motel down that way rents by the hour.&nbsp; If the apartment is nice, and is a good price, I would take it and just be aware of your surroundings when walking home at night.&nbsp; You are not that far away from the train and stuff to do on Broadway, so that&#039;s a plus.&nbsp; I live around 21 Avenue and 27 Street and the street is always deserted at night - but it&#039;s more residential so I feel safer.&nbsp; That doesn&#039;t always mean anything though, as bad things happen anywhere.&nbsp; You live in the city, be aware of your surroundings, walk with a purpose, and take a cab after 2am from NYC to Astoria.&nbsp; Pretty standard.<br /><br />41St and 31 Ave would be great.&nbsp; Nice area, lots to do in the area, although a little longer walk to train.&nbsp; I would say 30 Ave and Broadway represent the heart of Astoria, and Ditmars is cool for the Italian and Greek influences.

				This is in response to the last post, and to the general sense on this thread that anyplace west of 21st is completely undesirable. It is true that west of 21st street is further from the train (although some people prefer being able to take the bus to the subway and having more options than the N) and has fewer stores and restaurants. What’s <strong>not true</strong> is the idea that 21st is a magic line beyond which the neighborhood becomes dangerous and sketchy. <br /><br />Some of the pluses of being on the west side of Astoria: You’ll often have great views of the skyline and the river. You’re closer to the parks and the waterfront. You’re further from the noise, trash, traffic and parking problems of some of the busier&nbsp; commercial streets. <br /><br />As for 21st and Broadway in particular, it’s not even remotely desolate. There’s a supermarket and 24-hour diner across the street and enough foot traffic to feel safe at any&nbsp; hour.<br />

				Hey, thanks for the replies. <br /><br />I&#039;m glad to hear that 21st isn&#039;t some line of demarcation; I think I&#039;m just getting nervous about committing to a new neighborhood. I&#039;ll check both places out tonight and see what&#039;s what. <br /><br />By the way, if anyone knows of a good place with October 15th or November 1st availability, let me know. I have a secret wish for laundry in the building, but I&#039;m not holding my breath - just excited to be in a real &quot;neighborhood&quot; and out of the city. <br /><br />Cheers

				Isn&#039;t there anybody who prefers the Steinway/Broadway area? <br /><br />When we first came to look at Astoria we wanted to live in that area, but our (extremely shady) broker told us that the neighborhood was no good and they didn&#039;t have anything there anyway. He ended up showing us a place on Crescent and Ditmars, which we took because we were desperate, but we would still like to move down around Broadway in the future (assuming we stay in Astoria). <br /><br />Ditmars is just too suburban for me - too much space between things and all our favorite restaurants are on Broadway and 36th Ave. Also, we&#039;re not park-goers, so Astoria Park is no incentive. We took a walk down Steinway this weekend and remembered why we like the area so much.<br /><br />So anybody loving lower Astoria?<br /><br />

				I lived around 48th and Broadway for 4 years, and now live in the Ditmars area for the last 6. &nbsp;I have no beef with either area. &nbsp;Both have their pluses and minuses. &nbsp;I would actually say both areas are diverse, with more Latinos and Asians on one end, and more Greeks and Italians on another, and more Brazilians in another, and so on and so forth, and sprinklings of other ethnicities mixed in all over. &nbsp;Some pluses with the 48th Broadway area, that is quite suburbia like: the mega stores on Northern Blvd featuring Stop N Shop, Best Buy, Old Navy, Sports Authority, Home Depot, and Pathmark. &nbsp;All featuring parking lots! &nbsp;Woohoo! &nbsp;Looks just like Route 9 upstate near Wappingers. &nbsp;And it&#039;s 10 minutes train to Target and the QueensCenter Mall!! &nbsp;To get your urban dose, stay on Broadway. &nbsp;I liked the area and found it very convenient for everything. &nbsp;Cavo was within walking distance, yay! &nbsp;The movie theatre&#039;s pretty awesome.&nbsp; The MOMI.&nbsp; There&#039;s even a 24hour laundromat. &nbsp;The R does suck on the weekends in that it doesn&#039;t run locally in one direction often, but the NW is no picnic either. &nbsp;Basically, I think either side is pretty good, just depends on if you want more residential - Ditmars, or more businesses - Broadway.

It is, by the stats and from personal experience, very safe (but I grew up here, dunno what you consider safe), and seems to be benefiting from more little bars and restaurants.&nbsp; <br />Regarding the Woodside Houses (&quot;The Projects&quot;): they were cited about ten years ago as being a model project- in the sense that the residents were generally employed and you can walk around there without having an issue. <br />If you are not used to projects in general, wait till you get a feel, but the Woodside Houses are no movie stereotype of people assaulting each other and passers by. At all. <br />You can find the crime stats online.<br />There&#039;s a one family house half a block down from &quot;the projects&quot; on the market for 950k.

				I&#039;ll be graduating in May as well and just found a place in the Ditmars area. Now granted, I don&#039;t live there yet, so I don&#039;t know the area, but we went through Astoria Apartments and they were really great. They worked with us to find what we really wanted. Our apt is the last stop and it seems to take about 20 minutes to get to Times Square once the train starts moving.

				I&#039;m looking at an apartment I found on Craig&#039;s List in Astoria in the morning. The realtor says it&#039;s somewhere around 21st street and 14th street. He won&#039;t give me the street address so I can&#039;t figure out the subway stop. He claims it&#039;s the Astoria Blvd subway stop, but the Broadway N/W stop looks closer on the map. I have a dog, and the place has a yard which is mainly what intrigues me, but I&#039;m uncertain about the neighborhood re: amenities, safety for a young single woman, proximity to restaurants, etc. I really haven&#039;t gotten my bearings in Astoria yet. I drove around the Ditmars/Astoria Park area over the weekend which looked very nice although there was a bit of a stench in the air, but tomorrow will be my first time on foot further west. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Really more interested in Jackson Heights, but there&#039;s virtually nowhere to take the dog around there. If anyone knows anything about that area re: dogs please chime in!

				Hey everyone,<br /><br />I&#039;m considering a job offer in Midtown (Madison Ave.) and would like to look for apartments in Astoria.<br /><br />Now what&#039;s the deal with Ditmar? Is this another neighborhood? I like the fact that Astoria has a lower commute time and it sounds like amenities are more in walking distance vs. Ditmar.<br />However, I like the idea of Ditmar feeling more residential and quiet. Is Astoria super load and active?<br /><br />Also, any good yoga, dance, pilates or Aerobics studios in the area?<br /><br />What type of apartment can I afford for approx. $1,250.00? (Only a 1 bedroom or maybe even a 2 bedroom? What square footage am I likely to get?)<br /><br />Also, do you really need a car to live in Ditmar or can you get by by public transportation and walking?<br /><br />ANY advice greatly appreciated, Astorians (hoping to join the club shortly...)

				It&#039;s Ditmars, not Ditmar, and it&#039;s just a different part of Astoria, more residential, less commercial, a bit lower rise.&nbsp; Each of the various parts of Astoria have things to recommend them and things that might be less desirable.&nbsp; Ditmars is the end of the line, but is served by the N/W line (which sometimes goes express from the Ditmars station) and bus routes.&nbsp;

				Ditmars Boulevard is the name of the street that runs east-west at the terminus of the N/W line, and as mcdirk says, it is in Astoria.&nbsp; People say they live in the &quot;Ditmars area&quot; (or simply &quot;Ditmars&quot;) to pinpoint which area of Astoria they live in -- other main drags are 30th Ave., Broadway, and Steinway (all run east-west except for Steinway, which runs north-south).<br /><br />Ditmars is comparatively low-key; there are many restaurants and a few bars, as well as an extensive assortment of other commercial establishments - supermarkets, dry cleaners, delis, butcher, bakeries, dentists/doctors, coffee shops, a few wine bars, drugstores, gym, etc.&nbsp; Oh, and a <em>few</em> nail salons, 99 cent stores, and banks.&nbsp; There aren&#039;t really any clubs or cafes as there are around 30th Ave. or Broadway.<br /><br />You definitely don&#039;t need a car.&nbsp; All amenities are within walking distance, just as in other parts of Astoria.&nbsp; And it is an excellent commute to midtown - my office is between 5th Ave. and Madison, and my commute (from Ditmars) is 30 minutes door-to-door.<br /><br />I can&#039;t really comment on apartment prices because we haven&#039;t looked in years, but I would think that $1250 is in the 1 bedroom range.

				Another comment about Ditmars as you&#039;re looking--<br /><br />There&#039;s the Ditmars area near the N/W and then there&#039;s what is called &quot;Upper Ditmars&quot; where you have to take the bus to the subway. Make sure that when you&#039;re looking at places you know how close it is to Ditmars and 31st St, where the subway is. I know people who live in Upper Ditmars and take the bus to the subway and they don&#039;t seem to mind, but I know that I wouldn&#039;t want to.

				I am a woman that lives at 46th and 21st Ave....you could just walk to the shopping complex at 43rd and Ditmars if you don&#039;t want to go to Best Yet at Night. I run to the grocery/drug store/pizzeria/etc. all the time at night by myself. Its easy, close, and there are lots of people around after dark. There are 2 delis/bodegas near this plaza too that are open very late. <br /><br />And my walk to the Ditmars train is 15 min in the morning....but I am a fast walker...my husband walks or just jumps on the bus when he sees it.

				That&#039;s actually make me feel safe that the teenagers are running around the neighborhood. Kids are supposed to do that.

				We have been living in the house we are in now for a little over a year. The shopping complex at Ditmars and 43rd has a rite aid, berry fresh farms grocery, and a pizzeria that I use. There is also a gym, banks, dry cleaner, restaurants, dunkin donuts, etc in that complex. My bank is commerce so I do walk to 31st for that and I use the pharmacy at the CVS on 31st as well. <br /><br />I cook almost all of our meals and find that I like to get certain groceries at certain markets so sometimes I go to Trade Fair (which is open 24hrs) on Ditmars and the Best Yet on 37th and 19th. <br /><br />

				So I guess you like the neighborhood so far? I&#039;m moving over from Manhattan. Yes, I&#039;ve been quite spoiled with the convinence of the subway right on the next block and feel safe by people are on the streets at all time of the nights. But the quietness and no more stupid alternate side parking would be great reliefs for me. Not to mention no more slobbiness around. I know the Upper Ditmars is a bit far from everything else but I&#039;m new here so I won&#039;t mind to try for half a year or more to see if I like it.

				<br /><br />You might have to budge a little on the price... I live in Upper Ditmars&nbsp; in a 3 bedroom house with a small yard. My husband and I pay 2700/month before utilities and people have been telling me for over a year that in comparison to what is out there now, I got a deal. <br /><br /><br />You are bound to find something though...I have a friend that has 2 roommates in a 2 bedroom apt where the largest bedroom was kind of split into two....they each pay 750. They are in the 40&#039;s but closer to Astoria Blvd.<br /><br />Don&#039;t know anything about Broadway area but there are tons of people on this board that live there....<br /><br />Happy Hunting!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I like it too. Just moved around there (from Ditmars) a couple weeks ago, and it&#039;s good. I was hesitant about moving to 30th Avenue because I think of it as having more of a night scene than Ditmars, but once you get past Steinway it quiets way down without being eerily quiet. The walk to the subway is also not bad - I go to the 46th Avenue stop on the R/V, and it&#039;s about a 6-7 minute walk.

				Hi everyone! I&#039;m looking at apartments in Astoria to move on April 1st and wanted some advice. I have a lot of friends in Astoria that leave between Broadway and Ditmars so I&#039;m familiar with those areas, but today I looked at a place on 31st Drive and 21st St and was curious about the area. It&#039;s about a 10 minute walk to the Broadway stop, but Broadway on that end is pretty sparse. There&#039;s a diner, White Castle and a McDonalds very close... along with a grocery store, post office, laundromat, etc... it seems okay, but I&#039;m concerned about the late night/early morning hours. I leave for work at 5am and being a small woman safety is a big concern. Any info would be greatly appreciated!

				21st Street/31st Drive is a perfectly safe area, no concerns whatsoever. The area is changing a lot, there are a lot of new restaurants, apartment buildings, etc. Broadway is sparse? There are a ton of good restaurants on Broadway between 21st and the subway, 3 grocery stores, etc.

				I&#039;m also a small woman, and I feel quite safe in that area. There&#039;s a bus that goes down Broadway from the train station and stops at the Rite Aid plaza. That Associated is probably my favorite grocery store in Astoria. If you&#039;re looking at the apartments I think you&#039;re looking at, I&#039;m kind of jealous!

				Hi Everyone!<br /><br />This is my first post and although I have seen threads just like this I have noticed they are a bit out of date, so here I go:<br /><br />&nbsp;My boyfriend and I are planning on moving to Astoria from New York City this Summer and although we have begun looking we have not yet figured out the area we would like to zero in on. Just wondering where everyone thinks the safest areas of Astoria are? And where the best areas to live in general are? We are 28 and have friends who live on Bway and 35th st and 38th btwn Astoria Blvd and 28th Avenue, but we can&#039;t figure out where we want to be ... Any info would help greatly!<br /><br />Thanks so much!

				Perhaps you should spend a few hours walking around the neighborhood and see it for yourself. Then come back here and ask about personal safety.

				Ok, I gotta get my pet peeve out of the way first - Astoria is a neighborhood in Queens which is a borough of New York City. Kind of like how Chelsea or Murray Hill or Hells Kitchen are neighborhoods in Manhattan which is a borough of New York City. I understand that people on the island tend to forget about the other boroughs. That&#039;s fine, more awesome for the rest of us.<br /><br />ANYWAY. I&#039;ve lived here for only about 5 years, but I&#039;ve always felt safe. Being that it&#039;s a city, you have to be aware of your surroundings, and if you&#039;re walking home late at night, make sure you&#039;re not alone. But as long as you&#039;re street savvy, you&#039;ll be fine anywhere. Whatever avenue/blvd you choose, I would stay between 21st Street and Steinway, mostly for ease of commuting...you can go east of Steinway around Broadway/34 Av though since there&#039;s an R/V stop on Steinway there.

				I don&#039;t think I could disagree more strongly.&nbsp; While change in neighborhoods can be alarming to long-term residents, I think Astoria is continuing to get better - I would like the new buildings to be better designed and more green, like those in LIC, but the new stores, restaurants and cultural facilities are wonderful, and the new diverse communities that continue to expand have made the neighborhood more exciting.&nbsp; I just wish we had a real bookstore and one decent Chinese sit-down restaurant.&nbsp; I think a lot of the newcomers in the last 5 years are putting down roots in Astoria and getting involved locally, which is very welcome.

				Seems your job is the major problem that doesnt give you any spare time to do some fun things . If you cant find places to go in Astoria (there are tons) or a skip away in Manhattan , then time is your issue . Either that or you arent looking . You can go to any attraction based site and find places of interest in any of the areas i listed .NYcitysearch.com&nbsp; has tons of reviews for anytypes of places you might be looking for .&nbsp; NYC has 20,000 places to eat&nbsp; , so even someone picky has to find a couple he likes . Going to work and home&nbsp; everyday and not doing anything else is a problem ANYWHERE . Not just in Astoria . So even though you tried to put it down , you didnt really name&nbsp; any legit reasons , aside that its expensive&nbsp; , and everyone living here already knows that .

				I live on 29th street halfway between the Broadway and 36th Ave N/Q line stops and I love it! My friends are scattered all around Astoria and I&#039;ve never once felt unsafe walking around. The ave&#039;s have everything you could need, gyms, deli&#039;s, your choice for grocery stores and shopping and the brunch places are endless! It&#039;s also nice to just wander around and check out the super cute houses! I also have a car but I rent a garage spot so I don&#039;t have to deal with street cleaning.

				Ditmars is the best. I love it there. Moved out to move for a really good job in Florida. As much as Florida is cheaper and nicer weather, I want to go back. I am seriously considering just quitting and moving back. That is how disenchanted we are here. Maybe I am picky or maybe Astoria really is that much better. But when i do go back, that is where I am settling.&nbsp; Martha bakery rocks. Alba&#039;s pizza. The park. Just is home to me.&nbsp; There is no way anyone couldnt like that area.

				Landlord really has to change the locks&nbsp; but&nbsp; anyway abt 36ve , not really a great area . Best area is the Ditmars area . Safest part of town yr after yr ,&nbsp; much more family orientated and less riff raff .&nbsp; U always get a seat on the train&nbsp; and when those trains run express at times , from your ditmars stop to Qnsboro plaza u are safe .&nbsp; &nbsp; 30ave and broadway are nice too but very very congested . If you have a car , almost impossible to find parking and get ready for big time noise at night when people get out of the lounges and cafes .

				Hi everyone!<br /><br />I am actively looking for a 2 bedroom apartment, and it seems like we found it. Everything is great...but the area? Most of the apartments that we&#039;ve seen, were in Ditmars area and generally in 20&#039;s/30&#039;s. This apartment is on 42 street and 34th ave. It is a bit too close to the Northern Blvd, and after walking around for a bit - the neighborhood gives off a weird vibe... How safe is it? How bad is the parking situation?<br /><br />To top it off, i just read the reviews for the real estate agency, and they are horrible, to say the least...Now we are considering forgetting this all together. But the apartment is amazing, and i do not know if we can find anything better.<br /><br />Any thoughts? <br />And as always, thank for your time = :cheesy:

				I wouldn&#039;t call that an unsafe area, and you&#039;re close to the movie theater and the Museum of the Moving Image if you&#039;re into that. But that area, especially up on 42nd, is pretty deserted, so you might feel unsafe. I find that area overall pretty boring, but you are close to Broadway at least. If you really really like your apartment then go for it, but I think you&#039;ll find the area less lively than other parts of Astoria.

				Hi everyone, new to the board. My daughter and her roommate are excited to be moving into Astoria. Their apartment is on 47th street, just a couple of hundred feet from the Ditmars intersection. We were originally ending our search at Ditmars and Steinway, but after we saw a great apartment on 47th, we&#039;ve gone maybe 4-6 blocks out of our(my) comfort zone. Does anyone see any problem with a single girl walking home at night from the Ditmars Station up Ditmars and onto 47th. I&#039;m really not too concerned as far up as Steinway because its so busy. From Steinway to 47th the crowds and businesses start to thin out and thats where my concern is.<br />Please feel free to comment and shoot be your thoughts.<br />Thanks,<br />A nervous father

				<br />I&#039;m a father so I empathize with your feelings.&nbsp; NYC is the safest big city in the world and Astoria is a pretty safe place.&nbsp; That doesn&#039;t mean there isn&#039;t the potential for danger (here or in any other safe neighborhood). [size=78%]&nbsp; [/size]<br />[size=78%]The best protection is to be [/size][size=78%]diligent[/size][size=78%] and aware of one&#039;s surroundings.&nbsp; People don&#039;t want to hear things like that,&nbsp; but at the end of the day it&#039;s up to use as individuals to be aware.&nbsp; I&#039;m a male and when I walk home late hours I put my headphones away, I don&#039;t play around with my phone while walking, etc.&nbsp; Some might say I&#039;m overcautious or that they &quot;shouldn&#039;t have to do things like that&quot; but I&#039;m someone that prefers a measure of caution.[/size]<br /><br /><br />Also, after &quot;late nights out&quot; there are also options other&nbsp; than walking. The Q69 bus which runs up Ditmars and there is always a horde of black cabs waiting by the steps of the Ditmars N/Q stop.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Thats one of the best blocks in Astoria .

				Living near the projects isnt the smartest thing but bad stuff can happen anywhere .&nbsp; Day time those areas are usually safe but at night is when the night walkers seem to all come out .&nbsp; Maybe from their afternoon naps .&nbsp; Cops do patrol those areas&nbsp; but being that i grew up in Astoria&nbsp; I would totally say the safest area in Astoria is the Ditmars area . Its the most residential and family orientated area .&nbsp; 30th ave and Broadway are nice too but parking is near impossible and there are alot of people (tons of buildings ) per block . Its also very noisy spring/summer time so sleeping with windows open is tough .&nbsp; Not saying an apt on 35th ave or 36ave cant be nice as well but it all depends what your options and price ranges are and how flexible .

				Well, I&#039;m a generally unafraid person so perhaps my input isn&#039;t that applicable to all people, but in my experience people tend to mind their own business first and foremost, even if it&#039;s in &quot;spotty&quot; areas.&nbsp; A lot of this boils down to being able to see if something really is a potential problem or if it&#039;s just something one can&#039;t relate to, for lack of better wording.<br /><br />So for me I don&#039;t generally have a big problem with going through &quot;spotty&quot; hoods because people there do their own thing. And most of the time I try to remind myself that a lot of the unease I may feel is really about me looking and being different.<br /><br />I&#039;ll also point out that a huge problem when it comes to safety is alcohol consumption. I live around 30&#039;th / Steinway and the past two years there&#039;s always been police activity at least twice in the summer because of drunk and stupid people causing trouble over nothing. It&#039;s basically the crowd most of us wouldn&#039;t even consider a &quot;threat&quot; normally because they live in reasonable housing and look and act like &quot;us&quot;, until they get drunk.<br /><br />If there&#039;s one concern I would have about living close to for example Ravenswood it&#039;d be a different culture that could be annoying yet not illegal enough to warrant police action. I&#039;m thinking about playing loud music for example, things that are disturbing and not legal but that would possibly be low priority for the police to deal with. Not the end of the world but annoying when it intrudes on something you want to call home.<br /><br />Just some food for thought.

We currently live in a 2 bedroom apartment, in an elevator building and a garage, and pay about $1660. The rents in Astoria are significantly higher, apartments are smaller, mostly walk-ups. We recently found an 2 bedroom condo, in a nice area 3 blocks away from 30th Ave station. It has 2 queen size bedrooms, 2 baths, a dishwasher, washer and dryer in the unit, a balcony and a doorman. All for $2500, but... we pay for all utilities minus water.&nbsp; I think that with utilities it would probably amount to $2700/month. It&#039;s definitely on a higher side and a grand more than what we are currently paying. What I wanted to know if it&#039;s a really good deal for that price point, or is that about the average for a place of that sort? Thanks!

But in the winter, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if the utilities go over $400 a month, heat will be expensive.

				Woa...$400 for a 2 bedroom? Some astorians have said that it&#039;s actually a steal, but $2900 doesn&#039;t seem like a steal to me. It&#039;s a 1960s building, which I very much like, but it&#039;s not new construction which usually charges such rents for tiny spaces. <br /><br />I&#039;m very torn whether we should apply for the apartment. I love all aspects, but the rent frightens me. Based on the 40Xrent formula we can go for a $3500 apartment, but I think it&#039;s mad to pay that sort of rent in Queens. On the other hand, I love the idea of a balcony and a dishwasher and washer and dryer. Renting in NY with a modest rent you don&#039;t get those sort of amenities. <br /><br />I&#039;m just afraid that this will be a missed opportunity that will end up in regret. <br />

				Are u buying this condo or renting out a condo ?&nbsp; &nbsp; Im guessing u are renting it right ?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well to get all that , 2500 , is on the low end . I rent out apts in Astoria pretty much all my adult life and I can tell you if u were on ditmars , broadway or 30th ave&nbsp; ,&nbsp; &nbsp;that type of apt would be close to , if not 3k a month .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; First to get 2 queen size bedrooms,&nbsp; washer dryer&nbsp; your own laundry is huge .&nbsp; outdoor space....super huge plus a doorman ? wow&nbsp; &nbsp;.&nbsp; You would be getting a very good place for the money . Only thing is how is the neighborhood ? u said 3 blocks away from 30th ... well that&#039;s where some blocks get sketchy ,&nbsp; 34th-35th etc. Im not saying anything bad but just be aware and maybe the price reflects this .<br /><br />As far as heat ,&nbsp; more and more apts now are being converted where the tenant is paying for heat .What you use , u pay for . If you think abt it&nbsp; , it makes sense .&nbsp; &nbsp;Endless time the heat is on and no one is home .&nbsp; Windows are left open and heat goes wasted . Sometimes&nbsp; one person likes it colder&nbsp; while the other tenant likes it warmer .&nbsp; Solution , control your own heat . Electric everyone pays unless u are in a basement apt .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All new constructions are being built with separate controls and meters .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you and your husband are working most of the day , your heat would be off and&nbsp; it would only be used 6 months out of the year .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I doubt it would ever go to $400 .&nbsp; Mine has never gone over $200 but I also shut it off when its not needed (dress warm)&nbsp; &nbsp;and always off when we are out .<br /><br /><br /><br />Would I would do&nbsp; since u mentioned u can afford $3500,is either stick with the lesser rent or find a 1 bedroom in Astoria for the same price u pay now in Kew Gardens and save the rest of the would be rent money .&nbsp; Then buy that condo .&nbsp; &nbsp;U feel $2900 is too much for queens ?&nbsp; &nbsp;Well don&#039;t ,&nbsp; &nbsp;Astoria is one of the most wanted places around and plenty choose to live here over Manhattan like myself .&nbsp; Rents are always going up here and the demand is still huge . In 4-5 yrs , that price can look like a steal .&nbsp; &nbsp;BUT I really believe buying something makes a lot more sense .

There&#039;s nothing wrong with 34th and 35th sts near 30th ave.

This is a sound advice. I am actually seriously considering that path. The rents are so high that it would probably amount to around $2500 a month with a mortgage. That condo was terrific, but the heat expense frightened me a bit. It&#039;s electric, so I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll amount to more than $200 in the winter. We can easily be paying over $3K in the winter, for hot water, heat, gas and electricity.

My favorite buildings are from the 60s and 70s. They have thick walls, elevators and many have balconies. The pre-war buildings are large, but they have an aging infrastructure, no elevators and many lack closets. <br /><br />Contemporary construction is my least favorite, yes, on the surface it&#039;s glamorous and glitzy, but it lacks overall integrity in the construction and layout. There are new appliances, spa-like bathrooms and perhaps a balcony, but the space is extraordinary small. Some of them are so small that the size of the living-room is the size of a small dining area in the kitchen - and that&#039;s what it looks like - eat in kitchen with no livingroom. The second bedroom can usually accomodate only a twin size bed, and the balcony is designed for one emaciated person who will just step out to feel the temperature and step back in (no space for a chair). Of course there are those with decks and large terraces but they are ultra-luxe for astronomical prices. Not to mention that the new construction economizes on resources and materials, so thin walls, floors and ceiling and the sound carries quite easily. <br />

				More often than not, any new construction is going to be made with cheap material yet be called luxury.&nbsp; &nbsp;Astoria really isn&#039;t known for coops.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you want space - closets, elevators and laundry facilities - you&#039;re better off in Sunnyside, Woodside, Jackson Heights or other areas.&nbsp; There are a few pre war coops in Astoria with elevators and laundry but you will have to seek them out.&nbsp; Astoria is very desirable right now and Brooklyn is priced out so everyone is moving to Astoria.&nbsp; It will be the most expensive area you look in - not counting LIC.&nbsp; Good luck on your move!
