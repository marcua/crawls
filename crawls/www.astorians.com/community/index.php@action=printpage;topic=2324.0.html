				What is your favorite Indian restaurant in Astoria? And if not in Astoria then where in NYC? Might go to one this weekend, and am wondering if there are any really good sit-down Indian restaurants in our part of NYC, or if we should just go for a Manhattan one...

				I have enjoyed The Madras Cafe in the East Village.&nbsp; North and South Indian cuisine.&nbsp; They are strictly vegetarian (perhaps could make some things vegan, if they don&#39;t already have some) and kosher to boot!&nbsp; Very laid back atmosphere, nice people.&nbsp; Their address is 79 2nd Ave between 4th and 5th Streets.

				Thanks all - I have had Indian food from Swagat, a nice restaurant on the UWS - great sit-down place, but not sure if we want to make the trek or not. It would be good to find something more local, though. Any other suggestions to add to the pot would be helpful and appreciated. We&#39;re all about a plethora of options. ;)

				I&#39;ll second Jtrane&#39;s Gandhi nod.&nbsp; The best Indian food I ever had happened to be in Ireland, but the dinner at Gandhi came close.&nbsp; I forget what I had&nbsp; (both in Ireland and at Gandhi) because I can&#39;t keep the Indian names straight, but it was really impressive.&nbsp; It was a spiced, barbecued chicken with peppers and onions.&nbsp; Delish!&nbsp;

				This is a frustrating topic for me because my favorite Indian restaurant in Curry Hill (Cardamomm) changed ownership, chef and menu.&nbsp; First it became an Indian Chinese place, and I like Indian Chinese a lot but there are other good places in the hood for that...then it became Indian vegetarian, still good, but not AS good as the original chef and menu.<br /><br /><br />That place in midtown where some of us went for lunch was delicious.&nbsp; The buffet was great so I can only imagine the regular menu is terrific.<br />

				Vatan is a vegetarian Indian place on 3rd ave by 28th street?&nbsp; Very nice fun place. sit on cushions/ floor or at tables with sunken foot area.&nbsp; pay one price and they serve you multiple courses. Good for newbies like me as they explain everything.&nbsp; very relaxed too.&nbsp; moderate price.

				I lived in Murray-- nee, CURRY HILL for two years when I first moved to NYC and immediately undertook a methodic sampling of the neighborhood&#39;s varied Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi eateries. <br /><br />Maybe its because I was a destitute grad student, but the best of all was <strong>Curry and Curry</strong>, a silly name for a hole-in-the-wall dive with amazing <span class="bbc_u">samosas, chaat, and COMBO MEALS!!</span>. Who doesn&#39;t love theory of the Combination Platter?<br /><br />They have a tv that blares Bollywood DVDs day and night. Its awesome.<br /><br />Its not very nice for sit-down dining (did I mention that I was living on a graduate stipend of $24,000/yr?) but the food is authentic, plentiful, heartfelt, fresh, hot, spicy, and CHEAP!<br /><br />My favorite was the <span class="bbc_u">Vegetarian Lunch Special</span>, which was a platter with a mountain of fluffy basmati with a sampling of the 4 veggies of the day. These tended to be the comforting standbys: <span class="bbc_u">bindhi masala </span> (chickpea heaven!), <span class="bbc_u">saag paneer </span> (creamed spinach with homemade cheese), <span class="bbc_u">aloo go</span>bi, and eggplant+okra stuff that I forget the name of. &nbsp;Also, a spoon of <span class="bbc_u">daal</span> and <span class="bbc_u">rait</span>a if you ask real nice.<br /><br />Try the <span class="bbc_u">paneer paratha</span>! The best in the city!<br /><br />YUM!! Oh wait, did I mention that it was <strong>$3.75</strong>?!?!<br /><br />Curry and Curry (they deliver too): 33rd St between 2nd and 3rd.<br />

				We wound up going to Gandhi without meaning to. We just wandered around Astoria trying to find a good restaurant and just ran into it. <br /><br />I enjoyed it, but we also had a guy with us who grew up in India, so he said that it was not entirely authentic. Come to find out the people there are from Bangladesh...I suppose which would be along the same lines as Asians cooking Mexican food (Fresca Tortilla comes to mind, although that is a terrible example on so many levels). What was disappointing to me was the nan - it was not quite as good as other restaurants I have tried. A little more dry. It tasted good, but not great.<br /><br />So overall maybe a 6 out of 10.

He said it tasted like someone was trying to make Indian food, but were not succeeding all that well - plus on top of that he found out that they were from Bangladesh. He also pointed out that Bangladesh is close to India, so it wasn&#39;t that far removed, but it didn&#39;t taste like what he is so intimately familiar with.<br /><br />I know very little about what is supposed to be &quot;authentic&quot; Indian cuisine, but perhaps what they try to create at Gandhi is a cuisine that is not entirely second nature to them or their part of the map. So, maybe a better example would be that it is like someone from California attempting to make cuisine from the South (TN, AL, GA, etc, etc. - where I grew up) - it just isn&#39;t the same. It tastes and appears like they are making an attempt at Southern cuisine, but if you really want authentic Southern cuisine then the people who are making it had better be from the South. The same could be said about someone from the South trying to make Californian cuisine (of which there are very many!) - it just isn&#39;t the same. Everyone&#39;s own influences and interpretations usually come into play, so you wind up with something that isn&#39;t exactly authentic, but isn&#39;t exactly new either - just different. Even though it is all from the same geography of the United States doesn&#39;t mean that all Americans know how to fix the different cuisines that can be found here.

				Well I certainly agree with you that you&#39;re more likely to get better food from a native of a region! <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=2324.msg16172#msg16172">Quote from: wasabisam on June 10, 2006, 08:08:08 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I know very little about what is supposed to be &quot;authentic&quot; Indian cuisine, but perhaps what they try to create at Gandhi is a cuisine that is not entirely second nature to them or their part of the map. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#39;s entirely possible. Especially for low-end restaurants run by immigrants, there seems to be a tendency to cook what you think people want instead of cooking what you know. (As I noted above about the Nepalese-run Japanese place...) Unless you have fairly extensive experience and training in another cuisine, you&#39;re probably just going to be cooking from recipes without a real understanding how to interpret them to get the best results. (That&#39;s my personal experience anyway! :) ) This said, there&#39;s no reason why a Bangladeshi person couldn&#39;t apprentice in Northern India and learn how to make fantastic Punjabi cuisine...<br />

Certianly there&#39;s no reason a Nepalese can&#39;t learn to prepare excellent Japanese food as well. At these particular places it just seems clear that the people don&#39;t have it quite right for whatever reason. <br /><br />Maybe it&#39;s because they haven&#39;t spent time in the regions that represents the food they are cooking. Or maybe they&#39;re just bad cooks. Nobody is saying that someone can&#39;t cook because of some racial stereotype - at least I&#39;m not getting that.

A lot of it was, I believe, a class distinction. Many of the dishes we think of as &quot;Indian food&quot; were the very expensive foods eaten by the rulers of India, be they the Mughals or the British. This is the same way that &quot;French food&quot;, with demi-glace and other fancy sauces, is not hardly the food of a plumber from Lyon. Certainly, the typical poor Indian farmer did not eat a lot of expensive lamb stews, but instead ate a lot of daals and simple vegetable dishes. This said, I don&#39;t think much of the Indian food that we know and love was cooked for British tastes by British cooks, but instead was cooked for British tastes by Indian servant cooks. <br /><br />There are a couple of books on my Amazon wish list about the history of Indian food, but, well, I haven&#39;t read them yet. :)<br />

				The first time I tried Gandhi a roach ran across the table while I was eating. I decided to give them a second chance- because a lot of places have that problem. Went back sure enough saw another roach this time crawling on the wall next to my table. That being said- the dish I had was lovely- but I will not be going back. I know it is hard to control roaches in restaurants however I do not want them crawling on my table or next to me while Iam eating!!!<br /><br />I have never tried Megnha- but friends of mine swear by it!

I live just down the street from Meghna, and every time I walk by, there never seems to be anyone in there. Therefore, I&#39;ve never worked up the nerve to even try it. Maybe I should one of these days!

				In Astoria, Gandhi is good, but I prefer Meghna.&nbsp; <br />As for Indian food outside Astoria, there are some great places over in Jackson Heights, Delhi Palace and Shaheen Sweets, and Vatan, which was mentioned is incredible.&nbsp; Madras Mahal, which is on Lex at 27th Street is kosher, Indian vegetarian and focuses mainly on Southern Indian, Uttapams and Dosais -&nbsp; it&#39;s very good, though it used to be better.

				By far Meghna is the best in the &#39;hood.&nbsp; Also the prices are quite nice, considering the amount of food you get!&nbsp; <br /><br />Don&#39;t know how long you all have lived in the neighborhood, but I swear Gandhi is basically the same people that owned the Indian place where Thai Angel used to be, except it was much better then, correct me if I&#39;m wrong.&nbsp; Any way yeah there is never anyone in Meghna (they must servive on take out) and I know for a fact that they are Bangledeshi (sp?) but the short dood who works there is pure class!<br /><br />Damn had another thought, just forgot it...oh well just go there (or order in) and see for yourself!&nbsp; Oh yeah just remembered, sometimes it can be VERY spicy!<br /><br />cheers

				Meghna is great.&nbsp; Spicy is a very good thing!<br />The spiciest food I&#39;ve found in NYC so far was at Pongsri Thai, their jungle curry was bliss, but so hot I was sweating, tearing up in my eyes and the endorphin rush was intense.

				I recall reading in the NY Times that a very high percentage of Indian restaurants in the NY area are owned/ run by Bangladeshis.&nbsp; Apparently Bangladeshi does not have the same cachet as Indian.

				Happy to report that a new Indian Restaurant is opening on Broadway two doors down from where we started our Taco Crawl. They&#39;re halfway into construction and when I asked when they expected to open, they said they planned to be up and running by the end of November.<br /><br />YAY!<br /><br />&nbsp;:lol:

				yes, just not remembering off the top of my head. the reason I noticed it was the shiny new awning (is that the right word) proclaiming the name of the cafe as I was walking by... As soon as I saw it, I stopped and watched and the owner came out so I asked if this was a new Indian cafe and he confirmed....

				why is it that any time i find something new being built in astoria (ditmars) it&#39;s a bank, a dentist or a cheap accessory store?!&nbsp; we have plenty of these and the number thing i&#39;d like to add to astoria is a chinese restaurant (not take out but rather someplace where you can sit and drink tea, have peking duck or dim sum - the real thing!).&nbsp; i&#39;ve got to wonder if anyone ever asks what we want here.&nbsp; is there some way to petition for a chinese restaurant?&nbsp; i&#39;m half joking...
