				Pretty excited for this place to open. I&#039;ve heard that it&#039;s a cajun / creole place, which could be either awesome, or really off base. I&#039;m really hoping for the former, because the spot looks really amazing.

				The menu is now on their facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/SugarFreakNYC (http://www.facebook.com/SugarFreakNYC) Had dinner there on Sunday and was really impressed. The gumbo was excellent, the muffuletta quite good, and the chess pie dessert also quite great. The mac and cheese was good as well, but I like Kraft mac and cheese from a box, so... Prices - very reasonable.<br /><br /><br />Only gripe I have is that they&#039;re open only from Thursday to Sunday.

				Briefly: artgirl and I liked it a lot on our first visit.<br /><br /><br />Cocktails: <br /><br /><br />--Sazerac, very nice, sweet but elegant. <br /><br /><br />--Some kinda lemonade-hibiscus-tea-whatever thing that artgirl had, my sip was refreshing and complex.<br /><br /><br />--I also had a pint of the IPA they have on draft, which I think they said was from Abita or someone down there. Quite good, seemed a little more robust than other IPAs.<br /><br /><br />Apps: <br /><br /><br />--Boudain balls, the crawfish ones, awesome and decadent. Instant hit. <br /><br /><br />--Gumbo, just perfect, smoky file flavor and tender meats. As with the black bean soup at Pachanga Patterson, a bowl of this could be my dinner most nights.<br /><br /><br />Entrees: <br /><br /><br />--Fried oyster po&#039; boy, really good, though I agree with someone who said that they should use a less-substantial roll. The stiffer outer parts of this one kinda got in the way of the filling. I resorted to opening the roll, sticking my face in and eating the oysters along with the inner parts of the roll -- which I guess tells you the oysters were very good.<br /><br /><br />--Buttermilk fried chicken, really good, nice meat, serious batter. I will warn you that this is some hard-core fried chicken, with plenty of batter and even more salt (which I like). If you&#039;re looking for light and airy, this ain&#039;t it. <br /><br /><br />Desserts looked good but we were too full, not really surprising. <br /><br /><br />Service was friendly, reasonably fast and accommodating. Interior is very cute. We liked the big high tables opposite the bar.<br /><br /><br />Left sated and happy, will be back.

				Another vote for Sugarfreak!&nbsp; I&#039;d been waiting for this place to open for quite some time and finally got a chance to over the 4th of July weekend.<br /><br /><br />Service was speedy and friendly. Love the homey, comfy decor.&nbsp; I had the fried catfish po&#039;boy (whole) and it was terrific. The Sazerac was lovely as well - a bit strong, which I liked.&nbsp; Wanted to try the chess pie but was already full, so that&#039;s on the list for the next time.&nbsp; Definitely going back!&nbsp; We are so lucky to have all these great places opening up in the neighborhood.&nbsp;

				The space is really cool--I like how they decorated it. I enjoyed the fried oyster po&#039;boy, and I&#039;m really glad that they offer half sandwiches because that&#039;s just enough for me.&nbsp; However, the collard greens were way too salty--not even squeezing lemon juice into them could help.&nbsp; I mentioned that to the waiter, and one of the owners (I think) later came over and apologized <span class="bbc_u">and</span> took 20% of my bill (a pleasant surprise--I neither requested nor expected that).&nbsp; It has promise and I&#039;d like to try the jambalaya or gumbo at some point.&nbsp; The prices are certainly nice.

				I&#039;ve eaten there twice already and like almost everything I&#039;ve had so far - the balls, the fried chicken, the Mac &amp; Cheese, fried oysters, gumbo, etc.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t a huge fan of the blackened catfish; the spice mix was too salty and lacked heat.&nbsp; The Colllard Greens were odd; they tasted pickled, kind of like sauerkraut.&nbsp; But the food is very good and very different for NYC.&nbsp; I&#039;ll definitely be back.<br /><br />My main complaint right now is the drink price point.&nbsp; Those lovely Sazaracs people are mentioning are $11.&nbsp; In Astoria.&nbsp; Where I can walk down 7 blocks to the Quays and get a single malt Scotch for $7 (with a buyback most nights).<br /><br />Top shelf liquor is $12 and $13.&nbsp; These just seem way too close to Manhattan drink prices to me.&nbsp; I know the hipsters are coming with their fancy food and their money...but I wish drink prices weren&#039;t out of control so quickly.<br /><br />Ironically the food prices at Sugar Freak is quite reasonable for the quality.&nbsp; Portions aren&#039;t huge but the food is heavy so they don&#039;t need to be.

				They might have heard y&#039;all on the cocktail prices/specials complaints: artgirl and I went back for our second visit Sunday night, and they had a &quot;heat-wave special&quot; of $8 on all cocktails and $5 draft beers.<br /><br /><br />I had a very nice hurricane, with lots of real fruit juices, as opposed to the frozen-drink-machine kind you get in the cheaper Bourbon Street tourist traps. She got a watermelon punch with a savory note that she thought might be cucumber, very refreshing. I also had an Abita Purple Haze draft.<br /><br /><br /><br />The food was great, again.<br /><br /><br />We shared a cup of gumbo, wonderful again. Also the pork boudain balls, another hit, rich and moist and very distinct from the crawfish ones.<br /><br /><br />I got the blackened catfish, a dish that can be an afterthought in some Cajun places, but here the seasoning was bold and salty (which I love) and the fish was tender. It was also served truly hot, another test in a NOLA-centric place, because a lightly coated piece of finned fish can cool very quickly if it&#039;s left waiting around for its deep-fried menu neighbors.<br /><br /><br />I got it with the side of lima beans and tasso ham, which was buttery and smoky and made artgirl a fan, even though she doesn&#039;t like limas much. <br /><br /><br />I added the Southern slaw. This had a thicker, creamier sauce than standard cole slaw, with a vinegar kick to keep it bouncy. Artgirl &quot;suggested&quot; that I put the dish between us so she could steal more of it.<br /><br /><br />She ordered the entree listed as &quot;grilled shrimp,&quot; which sounded a tad dull to me, but the waiter recommended it. Turns out it&#039;s only the menu description that&#039;s dull: this should really be called &quot;grilled half-stuffed shrimp&quot; or something; each one had a generous cooked-on dollop of ... I dunno, a savory cheese, maybe parmesan? Some parsley? Not sure what was in it, but it was insanely tasty, with the smoky grill flavor carrying right through it. One of the better shrimp dishes I&#039;ve ever eaten.<br /><br /><br />For dessert we shared the chess pie, which was more than enough for two at that point. It reminded me of a pecan pie, but with peanut, and it was rich and sweet but also had a nice nutty tang. <br /><br /><br />On a side note, I left my umbrella there a couple of weeks ago, and called to report it the following week. As promised, they still had it behind the bar for me. The little things.<br /><br />

				Your description of the catfish is spot on.&nbsp; I loved it.&nbsp; Also loved the gumbo.&nbsp; Again, just salty enough to be really tasty. The lima beans are unbelievably delicious.&nbsp; We had some overly sandy oysters on an earlier visit.&nbsp; But hopefully that was just an oddity.&nbsp; Our second visit for a full dinner was very gratifying.&nbsp; As others have said, the owners and staff are very kind and caring people. The service here is rather outstanding.&nbsp; Just enough servers to do the job without being overbearing or absent for too long.&nbsp; &nbsp; Their cocktails are delicious and interesting.&nbsp; And I agree about the decor.&nbsp; The bathrooms are really something.

				Count me as another fan of Sugarfreak! I was really impressed with the food and service. <br /><br />Starters: crawfish boudin balls (deliciously and perfectly fried, not too bready) and gumbo (I thought this was the weak link of the meal, not bad, but would have liked it thicker and I thought it lacked some depth of flavor) <br /><br />Entrees: Jambalaya (amazing, had that depth of flavor I thought the gumbo was missing) and a fried oyster po boy (delicious, oysters were perfectly seasoned, though the fries it came with tasted like they had been sitting out for an hour). <br /><br />Sides: lima beans and tasso ham, something I had never had before, loved it and mac &amp; cheese, which was excellent.<br /><br />Didn&#039;t have dessert because we were too full, but can&#039;t wait to go back and try the chess pie, among other things. <br /><br />Such a great addition to the hood. Can&#039;t wait to go back! Hope they open for brunch sometime too, think they could do some great things with that.<br />

				I walked by this place last week and thought the menu looked great!<br /><br /><br />From the outside, it looked like more of a bar set-up.&nbsp; Is it kid-friendly?&nbsp; We have a 2-year-old and while he&#039;s well-behaved in restaurants, we like to make sure he&#039;s welcome before bringing him to a new place.

				lisadiane, with luck I will never be in a restaurant the same time as you.&nbsp; Mickey, it is kid friendly.&nbsp; Obviously you may find more of a drinking vibe after 8pm Thurs - Sat.&nbsp; But we went on a Sunday early evening and several well behaved children were there.&nbsp;

				Spicy peanuts sound delightful, to be honest. One of my favorite all time snacks is boiled peanuts, a southern delicacy. The Breslin makes them fried in pork fat, and it&#039;s one of the best things ever. <br />As for the allergy concern, this place is far from the only restaurant or bar that offers peanuts as a snack. If you&#039;re allergic, you can easily ask your waitron to remove them from your table.

				Had a great meal here last night, went with a Pimm&#039;s Cup for a drink which was really refreshing (as promised) along with the pork Boudain balls (work of art, excellent), fried chicken (very juicy, lots of flavor) and an extra side of collards (which were also tasty). My lady got the broiled oysters with mac and cheese which were also excellent. Good to see they had Abita on tap, but they were out of the amber unfortunately. <br /><br /><br />My one critique would be the french fries I got with the fried chicken were just average french fries you could find anywhere, nothing really special at all, will probably stick with the collards or maybe okra in the future.<br /><br /><br />Our waitress was great, a total character, also, I really enjoyed the spicy peanuts!<br /><br /><br />Our waitress mentioned they are closing next week to revamp the menu a little and transition into a 6 day a week schedule with brunch! Can&#039;t wait, I will be back!

				I went a week ago (crowded for a Sunday night) and was pretty happy with it.&nbsp; We had the crayfish boudain balls which were pretty tasty. Kind of like fried balls of seafood stuffing.&nbsp; Can&#039;t really go wrong. My wife had Jambalaya and I had the shrimp and crab boil.&nbsp; Both were good, but nothing phenomenal. The Mac &amp; Cheese side was amazing!&nbsp; I would consider just getting that as my meal next time, but I really want to try the Po&#039; Boys.<br /><br /><br />My waitress (not the above mentioned &quot;character&quot;, but she was working tables near us) mentioned they&#039;re going to close down for a week in September as they rework the menu for 6 days a week.&nbsp; They aren&#039;t going to be open for lunch, because the kitchen is too small, and they need to prep for dinner all day.&nbsp; But they&#039;re also planning on doing brunch.&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember if that would be sat/sun or just sat.

				Went there today to try their new brunch menu.&nbsp; They&#039;re such nice folks, I felt bad leaving without eating, but... the options are all priced to include a cocktail, and meat (sausage, and bacon).&nbsp; Since I didn&#039;t want alcohol, and don&#039;t eat meat, it wasn&#039;t going to work too well.&nbsp; I could have had the Bananas Foster French Toast, possibly, which I don&#039;t think comes with sausage or bacon, but I was interested in savory breakfast food first.<br />&nbsp;<br />Will work great, though, if you do eat meat and want a cocktail.&nbsp; I bet it&#039;s all great, and with all that, reasonably priced.<br />&nbsp;<br />I appreciate that they did add into their new dinner menu more options for vegetarians - super appreciative.&nbsp; I&#039;d bet that they tinker with their brunch over time too, and wouldn&#039;t rule out checking it out again sometime.

				Went to Sugarfreak for my birthday dinner last night, first time there and loved it. We were there with my 2 year old daughter, the waitress was extremely friendly and made all of us feel every welcomed. The decor is beautiful; very clear they put a lot of love into this place. The food and drinks were great, I had the fried chicken which was incredibly juicy. I actually dropped the final bite on the floor, which was devastating. Also had the crawfish boudin balls, mac &amp; cheese, and my wife had the shrimp po&#039;boy- all were great. Didn&#039;t love the french fries (which reminded me of McCain&#039;s) but a very minor issue. Had a sazerac and pimms cup which also were excellent (had never had either before). All in all, a very satisfying experience...a place like this that made me feel welcome and shows such care in its ambience and food will certainly get repeat business.

				We finally made it to Sugar Freak and will definitely be going back.&nbsp; I&#039;d probably go back just for the atmosphere and decor (frankly) but the food holds its own. We had brunch with comes with a choice of 2 cocktails.&nbsp; Grits, sausage, eggs, and coffee were all delicious. We&#039;ll have to go back for cocktails and some more traditional dishes. Great place and I&#039;m happy for the owners.

				My wife went with a friend of hers this week and they were underwhelmed.&nbsp; Fried chicken, ok/too salty, mac + cheese, ok, jambalaya ok.&nbsp; <br /><br />They did like the muffaletta.&nbsp; My wife said she&#039;d go back for lunch and order something like that but wouldn&#039;t return for dinner.<br />

				One thing I&#039;ve noticed when I&#039;ve been there for brunch- it is FREEZING. I say this as someone who is rarely cold, too.

				Dropped by Sugarfreak tonight (Thurs.) at around 9pm and they were closed. Lights off, open/closed sign in the door flipped to closed. No sign of health department or marshall&#039;s notice or anything. Anyone know what&#039;s up?
