				I&#039;m thinking about the MySpace route, but I want people to be able to view it that aren&#039;t on myspace.&nbsp; It&#039;ll be the team page for my NY Cares Day Team, (team registration is next week) b/c this year I want to seriously try raising some money etc, and the tools they give you on the NY Cares site, while nice, are limited.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t think I really need a website year round, you know?<br /><br />p.s.

				a lot of places, like geocities.com allow you to create a simple site using simple tools.&nbsp; You don&#039;t need to know any html or web skills to use their site builder programs.&nbsp; They aren&#039;t fancy pages, but allow you to post pictures, create links and pages, choose styles and backgrounds etc.

				If you decide to go the MySpace route, people will be able to see your page without signing in.&nbsp; The only thing they will not have access to without a membership would be the pictures.&nbsp; But you can definitely use HTML and link pics from Flickr or other sources.&nbsp; &nbsp;To give your page a professional look on MySpace, I use the RealEditor that comes with Firefox&#039;s MySpace Toolbar.

				I&#039;ll want people to be able to look at pictures from last years event, and afterwards at this years event, without having to join myspace (I&#039;m thinking of older family members who would be likely to make donations) so myspace is out.&nbsp; But the goecities does seem like a good idea, I&#039;ll have to look into it.The big hassle I remember from last year was that the actual NY Cares donation pages is something like www.nycaresday.org/volunteer/90739887349587438573848574098540398590485904385098439584390.html and was kinda hard to just tell somebody the address for.&nbsp; So this year I want my own site to portal to that one.<br /><br />Plus our team name last year, and this, is Team Truthiness, and I&#039;m going to try and get on Colbert.&nbsp; Can you imagine if ordered the Nation to go to the site and if even a 1/4 donated?!?!&nbsp; They could have gotten that bridge in Crotia or wherever names after him if the country didn&#039;t change the rules to keep him from winning.&nbsp; I need the Colbert bump baby and I&#039;m hoping a nice site will lend some credibility to the cause.
