				<span style="font-family: Times;" class="bbc_font"><em>(I know how our administrator, merm, and our moderator, mcdirk, hate to have to plow through long posts, but this is going to get personal, very personal, so I suggest you loosen your ties, relax and continue to read.)</em></span><br /><br />When I joined this online Community of Astorians.com—and yes, I know that this is the internet and that capital letters are not needed, but I prefer to always put my hometown in a respectful light whenever possible—somewhere around March of 2005, it was a promising avenue into the soul of the Astoria Community at large. The only other Community-oriented site at the time was <span class="bbc_u">MyAstoria</span> (http://www.myastoria.com/). Astorians.com had a few hundred members on the forum and the hot discussion was about the best bagel place around! Now Astorians.com boasts over 4000 members and averages around 140 unique posts per day. The site had far less software features and far less dissension. There was also little to no moderation. (I recently read something which profoundly resonates on this discussion: <em>A thing moderately good is not so good as it ought to be. Moderation in temper is always a virtue; but moderation in principle is always a vice. </em>—Thomas Paine) There were no little red and green thumbs-up and thumbs-down. There were no nods. I would personally very much appreciate it if this remained a nod-free thread. If you want to add to this thread, please post your comments. IMHO, the prolific nodders have added nothing to this forum and have in fact detracted from far too many vibrant, interesting and necessary conversations. To the neg nodders who go from thread to thread, who haven&#039;t got the pertinaciousness (READ: balls) to post their own opinions, who always neg nod certain people for whatever their petty reason, please go back to lurking because <strong>I am asking that either the nods feature be disabled or people start being held responsible for their neg nodding usage so that those that are offending the system can be held accountable for their actions to disrupt the forum</strong>. When you see a whole lot of nodding going on in a thread, doesn&#039;t it change the thread&#039;s tone into a we-against-them kind of thing? Their presence alters the discussion itself and discourages people from posting. When did flaming politely become so acceptable? No-one can identify what neg nodding ultimately produces, except a lot of hurt feelings and I hardly think that&#039;s what this forum is all about.<br /><br />Merm has done an outstanding job in the development and upkeep of Astorians.com, and I personally want to take the time to applaud him on that. mcdirk recently, unbeknownst to him, got a standing ovation from me on his recognizing that a thread was getting too hot and locking it up until cooler minds prevailed, and on a few occasions asked that a conversation get toned down. That should be the extent of how this board needs to be handled. Have you noticed that since it was recently stated that it is okay to use curse words spelled out in posts that they are occurring now more often? Besides being somewhat amusing, it also succeeded in calling peoples attention to the little known fact that this, just like any other, forum has default software parameters and that they can be changed by changing the fields of your own personal profile. (Here is a little test for you: f___ if the preceding word is PANSY you should go to your Profile —&gt; Look and Layout Preferences and put a check mark next to Leave Words Uncensored.) Then you will be able to read the word F•U•C•K and all discussions in their entirety without any artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />Until now I have been a strong supporter of this forum up to and including urging people to financially support this site. For the requested donation of $12.00 per year we supporters were promised an advertising-free site and some additional perks. I was of the opinion that supporters would have a stronger voice in the goings on around here. After all, how many private clubs allow non-members to vote? But apparently membership in this club is supporting the non-donating member, ass-kissing flocks of sheep that will maintain the status quo regardless of the consequences. <br /><br />We have been reminded time-after-time that this site is the private property of the owner of the site. I&#039;ve always read that like, &quot;it&#039;s my ball and I&#039;ll make up the rules for the game or I&#039;ll just go home with my ball.&quot; Somewhere among the threads there is even an analogy comparing this site (or was it all internet forums) to a magazine with an editor and a publisher and how things get published at that type of venue. I recently read a very interesting true story about public rights on private property. Back in the 1970&#039;s a gentleman who was quite the radical about building a nuclear plant on Long island, went with his little local anti-nuclear plant group and started passing out leaflets inside the Smith Haven Mall in Lake Grove, Long Island. They got themselves kicked out. The Mall rules stated that since the Mall was private property, the management can say who stays and who goes. The leaflet group initiated a lawsuit in New York State and they won the suit based upon the concept that a mall is pretty much the same thing as the &quot;Town Square&quot; of old. The Town Square was where people gathered to meet and discuss happenings of the day and where the local Government posted things of Community interest. The mall may have been private property but it had become more than that.<br /><br />So has Astorians.com.<br /><br />It is now so much more than a privately owned website. It has become a public space where local residents of the Astoria Community meet to discuss and share information. This suspending and banning of members of the forum is absurd. Even in the days of old, when one was punished they were put into stocks in the Town Square where they still had access to their Community. Suspension and banning denies the basic principle of this forum: to meet and share thoughts and ideas through input with friends and neighbors. This online Community has both the intelligence and the tenacity to moderate itself without any High School hall monitors like the simple- little-minded snitches who obviously find use for the &#039;report to moderator&#039; link. I was recently told that suspensions are usually 24 hours, then 48 hours, then 7 days, then 30 days, escalating with each suspension. But, that doesn&#039;t seem to be the case. And why, among the pages of the Board&#039;s Rules, is this not mentioned? The rules themselves may be fine, it just seems that they are very unreasonably and inconsistently enforced, and that their enforcement has become a subjective statement by the enforcer rather than any other issue. Inconsistent moderating has led to so much discontent of this site, leaving the only consistent issue being the inconsistent acts of the Administrator and the Moderator(s). <br /><br />How telling is it that in the <span class="bbc_u">Open Discussion of Board Rules and Policy</span> (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=10827.0;topicseen), as of this writing, there are a mere 37 posts expressing their opinions and yet there have been 50 people who responded to the poll. As I perceive it, the problems that this forum is currently experiencing is not so much from the having of rules as it is the way these rules are both enforced and interpreted, and the inconsistent way they are moderated.&nbsp; I am constantly reminding myself that we would not have racial integration if it were not for the minority voices being louder and more willing to suffer the consequences of their actions to just be heard. Even more interesting than the aforementioned poll, is the poll in <span class="bbc_u">the nods</span> (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=10081.0;topicseen) thread. With only 38 posts in the thread there have been 54 people who voted and almost 25% of those voted <em>I don&#039;t really care for it, but I use it anyway for those times when I disagree but don&#039;t feel like posting about it.</em> I would have liked to see how those folks would have voted if there had only been 3 choices: I Like The Nods; I Don&#039;t Like The Nods or I Don&#039;t Give A Flying f___ About Nods!<br /><br /><em>I would like to take this opportunity publicly like thank those of you who have been so supportive and loyal to me throughout my little ordeal, and to the folks whose words and thoughts I have used, thank you for your permission to do so.</em><br /><br />This is what it looks like, just so you recognize it should it confront you someday:<br /><br /><div align="center">(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3280/2579920087_6befe2969f.jpg?v=0)</div><br />No warning; no explanation; no discussion; no avenue for appeal . . . no telling you what you did/said; no informing you how long this bullshit will last; just get yourself into the naughty corner, like a child and think about your sins because someone subjectively decided that you did/said something that they interpreted as being against the rules—for YOU—while the baiting and inflammatory rhetoric is overtaking the forum.<br /><br />What saddens me the most is the self-indulgent, smug, cavalier attitude expressed by those in charge. In general, I have been a huge merm fan. The concept of this forum, what Astorians.com has done for the Community has had a huge impact on our lives.&nbsp; This isn&#039;t just another board, this is our neighborhood and the people who frequent this board are our neighbors; many of them have become friends. So, now there is another <span class="bbc_u">local forum</span> (http://astorialogues.com/) who might be perceived as giving chase to this one. I personally welcome any venue that can attract the diversity of Astoria to help restore the cohesiveness that once was my Community. <br /><br />If things around here don&#039;t start healing, begin being open to less moderation, less of this vicious neg nodding, or ass-kissing crap, I am going to take the advice of a friend who told me get a hobby and get the hell off the computer. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been addicted to what once was Astorians.com. I&#039;ve got to quit. Or, minimally, I&#039;ve got to cut back.<br /><br />Some of you will recognize that there are larger issues at stake here than a few people name calling, being suspended, or being mad at the moderation of this forum. Sadly, some will not.

				I used to be a member of another forum.&nbsp; It was one of the most popular forums on Delphi.&nbsp; You couldn&#039;t go to Delphi without seeing their name - always tops in membership, posted messages, chat room use.&nbsp; One day I found I couldn&#039;t post.&nbsp; I hadn&#039;t gotten any private messages about being banned.&nbsp; I checked with someone I knew from the group and with the people who run Delphi - they confirmed I had been banned.&nbsp; I was a member of other Delphi forums and occasionally visited still more, and everywhere I went, someone would eventually mention that they had been banned from this one particular forum, and 3 or 4 more people would chime in that they had been banned, too.&nbsp; I was amazed that so many people had been banned - the forum had the word &quot;friends&quot; right in their name!&nbsp; It seemed that if you didn&#039;t toe party line, you got banned.&nbsp; In my case, I could support our troops, but I couldn&#039;t be for the war.&nbsp; Long after I was banned I continued to see their name all over Delphi, they were tops in everything, and I continued meeting an ever growing number of people who had been banned.&nbsp; After a long time of going straight to the group I was currently most involved in, I went to the main page.&nbsp; It was strange, but I didn&#039;t see the name of that other group, anywhere.&nbsp; I searched for them by name - nothing came up.&nbsp; I had to wonder, did they finally ban everyone?&nbsp; Did they vote themselves out of existance?&nbsp; Did they make themselves such an exclusive group that they no longer advertised membership and made themselves into a private, invitation only group?<br /><br />I wonder if that&#039;s going to happen here.<br /><br />Originally this message was a lot longer and covered more issues, but I accidentally hit the wrong key and what had taken me a very long time to write had disappeared, and I don&#039;t have the energy to reconstruct it.&nbsp; Since my accidental deletion took me back to the original post without my message materializing, I decided to see if anyone else had responded ahead of me.&nbsp; I had to laugh when I saw the number of views NYCMacUser&#039;s original post got without ANYONE saying anything in response.&nbsp; Really, 30 views and no one had anything to say?<br /><br />&nbsp;

But I have said what I have wanted to say in the &quot;open discussion about the rules&quot; (sic), and I feel that saying anything more is like kicking a dead horse and that it is a waste of my time and energy. Also, since Mama was banned for a week she didn&#039;t have a chance to join in most of the discussions that have been going on on the board this week. Plus she pretty much summed it up in that one posting. <br /><br /><br />*edit* As I was posting this and saving it, I noticed that Mama and Starwind had each gotten a neg nod. This is what has been bothering people about this board. When you open up a page and see everything looking normal, no nods, negative or positive, it seems real. But then you go back to the thread and you see a few neg nods, like Mama said, it changes the whole feel of a thread. I mean can&#039;t people actually verbalize and discuss a thread without just nodding instead? I used to do it on occasion, and afterwards I felt slightly bad about it, so I don&#039;t do it anymore. Look at it as detox from nodding. Try it once, and you&#039;ll see how difficult it can really be. This board IS our community. Imagine if you will being in a bar and you&#039;re involved in a conversation with people you know or maybe you don&#039;t know them so well. And one person says something that you don&#039;t agree with, but instead of verbalizing you tap the guy on the shoulder and with your hand you give them a thumbs down. Well that is how it feels on this board sometimes. Does it bother me much? Not really. But it is tiresome to say the least, when you can obviously see that members aren&#039;t getting involved in conversations. Now, I&#039;m not saying that you have to get involved in a conversation by making a post as long as have been made here, but some semblance of normalcy would be nice.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I think there will be a lot more views than posts in this thread because Mama pretty much summed up what a lot of people have been thinking. I know she summed up what I&#039;ve been thinking and what I&#039;ve already posted in other threads. When I started that thread about the nods, it truly was just to get a gauge for what people thought about them since I thought they were useless and counter-productive. But now I&#039;m at the point where I really do think the board would benefit from their removal, along with the moderating tactics (NOT the rules) given a complete overhaul. <br /><br />As for getting a life, it&#039;s great to have hobbies aside from reading the internet and posting on message boards, but there&#039;s no reason why this shouldn&#039;t be a part of your life also. I&#039;ve learned a great deal of things about Astoria from this board, and I don&#039;t feel like a loser for spending time on it and for caring about what happens with it.

				Mama summed it up and I have nothing more to add with the exception of reiterating that this is not just a board with unknown people, this has become the internet version of a public townsquare, in that Merm you should feel proud that your idea has become more than just an ordinary message board, it has become a living community.&nbsp; We have made an effort to meet each other, when we look at a post...we know the face, we&#039;ve been in contact with that person and once that happens it&#039;s a whole different animal.&nbsp; The nods in my opinion are useless, the whole point of a board besides information is discussion and both agreeing and opposing comments should be welcomed.&nbsp; Will it on occasion stir up some colorful discussions...yes, will some people be in discordance? Yes but that&#039;s what it&#039;s about.&nbsp; &nbsp;Banning is a very sensitive issue and should not be left to the decision of one person, I believe that there should be more people involved and that the person should receive at least 3 warnings in private, that not only shows respect but gives the person time to cool off and vent to the moderator if need be but a ban just out of the blue is really not a good thing, as I said, we&#039;re not dealing with strangers, someone in Timbuktu and another one in timbuckthree, we&#039;re dealing with our friends and neighbors and there should be common respect amongst us.<br /><br />If I get banned for putting my .02 cents in then just cancel me out.&nbsp; My mother left Cuba in 1959 running from being oppressed from a Communist regime so for me to not be able to express my opinion, thoughts, views goes very deep because of that and I will not allow anyone to oppress me from speaking freely.&nbsp; <br /><br />I really hope that you realize Merm that this board has grown and has transformed into something much bigger than what it originally was when it started, it&#039;s not a baby anymore...it&#039;s a teenager, so as parents grow with their kids...I think you need to adjust with how this board has metamorphosed.<br /><br />Anyways...thank you Mama for that post and for being who you are, you are a woman that has been to hell and back and I respect you and admire you and on a personal note...when I feel the world caving in all I have to think of is what she&#039;s been through and I say...I can get through this.&nbsp; <br /><br />Merm. thank you for this board...you don&#039;t know what you started but it&#039;s good.<br /><br />Now...so is this the time I get mushy and say&nbsp; &nbsp;GROUP HUG?&nbsp; lol<br /><br />:-)

				As someone who used to run a popular web-community a few years ago, I recognize this (and the &quot;alt&quot; Astorians board) as a pattern of exactly what happened to the community I ran. Wavings of fists, declarations of &#039;independence&#039;, etc, etc.<br /><br />I find it all rather tiresome. It&#039;s the &#039;net, folks. It&#039;s not hard to start a board of your own.

				Mamamac -- I’m glad you’re back and I’m sorry you seem to be hurting. It’s quite obvious that there need to be some changes in the way this site oprates, which as merm has said he will address.<br /><br />I’d like to respectfully respond to some of what you written.<br /><br />The astorians.com as a magazine model you cite was mine and though I can see parallels between your model, astorians.com as a town square, in my mind the two are similar but not the same. Perhaps in my example I didn’t go far enough so I would like to add that I also believe that astorians.com would be nothing without the people who contribute to it, or it’s writers, because those contributions are the whole purpose of this site – at least in the way that I see it. <br />&nbsp;<br />As much as I love astorians.com it is not a replacement for Astoria. A website is not the real world, at least not yet, because in the real world you do not have the privilege of being anonymous. It’s the anonymity that is key to this discussion and often left out of the equation.<br /><br />Online, at least on this website most of us are faceless, nameless personas. We are self-edited versions of ourselves and how much of the un-edited portions are revealed depends solely on what we choose to show, though you can learn a lot from what a person writes and what they respond to.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Anonymity skews the comparison. It’s empowering, almost like a drug, because it gives us the ability to say things and behave and act in ways we might not normally say, behave and act and therein lies the trouble. <br /><br />You cannot be anonymous in a physical town square. You have a name, a face, an address, etc. are seen and are identifiable, which allows your words and actions to be called to account in ways not possible online.<br /><br />So to all who were hurt and confused by suspensions and “banishment” from the town square have you ever considered that some of the things you say, from the flip comments to the down right nasty, may have hurt other people’s feelings? Or when read by third parties intimidates them and inhibits that from taking part in the town square discourse?<br /><br />Has the thought occurred to anyone who advocates a lighter approach to managing this site that a more free-for-all, no holds barred philosophy effectively makes you one of “those people” who alienate and in effect banishes people from the town square?<br /><br />It’s easy to say to people they should get over it, not take it so seriously or they should toughen up. If that’s a person’s immediate reaction I respectively ask “who are you to decide what people should be or how they should react?” It smacks of the same judgemental attitude the supposed “those people” who run this website are accused of.<br /><br />It may be harmless banter for some but as I’ve maintained words matter especially on a website that consists only of words. We’ve all said things we regret, myself included, but I have to tell you I always think hard before hitting that save key and publishing my comments. Some of you don’t.<br /><br />People may say ‘we don’t need rules, we’re adults and can manage ourselves’ but when many feel aggrieved the first thing cited are the same rules you say are not needed in the first place.<br /><br />I agree we don’t need rules, when we’re all playing nice that is, but when the discussion turns ugly as they do from time to time, it’s not so easy to sort out.<br /><br />Those who hold the attitude we don’t need rules I say really? Have you seen some of the comments on the alternate website – one word: vicious – and for what should be a neighborhood website a shameful way to treat one of our own.<br /><br />In regard to those who feel they have “rights” &nbsp;– really, and your right trumps someone else’s? <br /><br />It’s funny, MamaMac cited negatively “those in charge” as a sort of &nbsp;“enemy.” Until this week I too thought there was a “those in charge” and some of you will be surprised to know, as I was surprised, that there isn’t a those but a who – merm – one person (with help from mcdirk) one human being who’s trying his best to manage a diverse group of people and at the same time make astorians.com an enjoyable place to visit.<br /><br />Few people have the means to create their own town square by building a shopping mall, and those who do one must work very, very hard to create an atmosphere where people want to congregate.<br /><br />But each and every one of us has the means to create a virtual town square such as astorians.com from the privacy of their own home. So I applaud anyone who is brave and crazy to do so. &nbsp;<br /><br />The hard part is making it a place where people want to visit. It didn’t just happen. So let’s give merm some credit and let’s pile-off and let him get on with trying to improve the site for all. Its time to acknowledge he is one human being who’s trying to do his best.<br /><br />Lastly, Merm has been very open to hearing from everyone that has an opinion on this matter. I&#039;m looking forward to the changes and hope we can all move on.<br />

				I think the discussion on what analogy to which we compare astorians.com is very thought provoking.&nbsp; I see it more along the lines 28Grand has suggested, as a magazine, than a town square, myself, though I can see elements of both in how the site operates.&nbsp; I think it may be more like a restaurant or lounge where people socialize and unwind.&nbsp; We must not forget that the creation, programming and maintenance of this site takes a lot of time.&nbsp; Without Merm and Wasabisam giving up hours of their time on maintenance and trouble-shooting, we would not have this site.&nbsp; How many threads do we see pop up when we&#039;re having problems with the site loading, PMs having issues (no notifications or the like) or other technical issues.&nbsp; Considering that we&#039;re not paying Merm, though some of us donate some money annually, I think the site is more like an establishment that is open to the public, but which has management.&nbsp; Another analogy would be a person opening their private home to act as a salon for discussion.&nbsp; <br /><br />I do think we should spell out both rights and responsibilities.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know that you can have either without the other.

				Grand28, that&#039;s you&#039;re POV and I respect it but that&#039;s YOUR POV, for some of us this is more than just a message board because of the fact that you do meet people here, as far as anonymity being empowering? &nbsp;It depends on the person really, some of us don&#039;t care whether it&#039;s on a board or in person, if we have to say something we do. &nbsp;Some persons chose to remain anonymous and use this board like a board, others chose to use this board as a board and a source of meeting fellow neighbors.<br /><br />Whatever it is, it&#039;s serving more than one purpose and changes should be made accordingly.<br /><br /><br />

				Of course it&#039;s my point of view. My words are opinion, not fact, and I expect no one to agree with me so that should not be in question.<br /><br />I never likened this website to a message board. I likened it to a community-generated interactive publication and it wouldn&#039;t be interactive without the people who contribute to its content and then exchange ideas with each other.<br /><br />You are very right to say that the site serves more than one purpose and more power to you (and anyone else) if you use this site in a different way than I do,<br /><br />I respect that you may choose to reveal yourself online to all or meet a few astorians.com users in person and make friends. But what you write is seen and impacts very other contributor who you have not met and by thousands more each month who stop by to read the postings. They have no idea who you are or what you&#039;re about.<br /><br />Don&#039;t you think anonymity matters when making public statements? Do you think some of the negative things that have been said in this situation alone would have been said in the same way if two people were face to face? Even if the same words are used do you not think that tone and body language matter when you try to communicate.<br /><br />I prefer the anonymous aspect of the site myself, but I also respect it (not to say you don&#039;t by the way) but I think it distorts what we (and I include myself) say and do -- which leads to conflict

				Welcome back MommaMac and thank you for your eloquent post. <br /><br />I have a theory that those who understand and sympathize with MommaMac and the other users who were banned are the users here who have met friends through Astorians and have built an off-line community here to complement the on-line one. &nbsp;<br /><br />Those of you who don&#039;t understand &quot;why we&#039;re making such a big deal out of it&quot; &nbsp;may use this forum for restaurant reviews, discussion of random things and to kill time between meetings at the office... but maybe you have less emotion invested because to you this is &quot;another web site&quot; not your front porch. &nbsp;<br /><br />This is the first and only online forum of which I&#039;m a regular visitor/user. &nbsp;I do spend a lot of time here. &nbsp;I&#039;m friends with a lot of the members off the board. &nbsp;This is a big part of my life and it&#039;s important to me. &nbsp;<br /><br />I&#039;m looking forward to seeing what changes come of all this discussion. &nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I think one of the problems you, NYCMacUser, may be having with this board is that you do think you are actually queen or &quot;mama&quot;.&nbsp; You are peeved that people are nodding when you&#039;ve asked them not to (who are you to make such a demand).&nbsp; You have a tendency to wag fingers, to tell off, to &quot;correct&quot; all over this Astorians.&nbsp; More than anyone else one this board, you create/perpetuate an us and them: referring to people as &quot;ass kissers,&quot; &quot;sheep,&quot; creating a new thread rather than participating in the ongoing thread &quot;on the state of Astorians.&quot;&nbsp; Your participation is divisive, and it is tiring.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d call myself a mid-level user of Astorians.&nbsp; I post fairly regularly, lurk constantly, have friends here, have other people who I have met through Astorians, and generally am not interested in the politics of the thing.&nbsp; I have never reported anyone to the moderators, and I rarely use the nod feature (and have posted in the nod thread my feelings about them).&nbsp; I also have pretty much stayed out of all the recent discussions of Astorians.&nbsp;

				Jennifer --<br />Thanks for that post it. I don‘t think I discounted the social aspect of this site, but I perhaps did not fully appreciate the social networking function astorians.com plays and how some people have integrated it into their everyday lives. If you feel I didn’t get what this brouhaha was all about I’m sorry. I did I think, to a certain extent, but not in the way you stated. I thought people might connect here and then move offline, making the site less important in maintaining the connection. I now see it differently.<br /><br /><br />Adam --<br />You’re point of view on internet forms philosophically differs from mine in that, correct me if I’m wrong, you believe in little to no moderation, editing or intervention. I see value in moderation or the role of an editor, so we’ll have to respectively disagree.<br /><br />I have consistently maintained the opinion that if a person is unhappy with the policies of this website they are more than free to start one of their own.<br /><br />You did that and I sincerely applaud you for doing so. I think you’re nuts for doing so by the way but I think merm is certifiable as well so you’re in good company. <br /><br /><br />In another post you stated that “truth and facts matter no less on the internet than in the real world”<br /><br />I agree 100% but the questions that follows in my mind is who’s truth? Who’s facts? Who’s interpretation?<br /><br />And now you explain away viciousness and threats of violence published on your website as “righteous” anger. I’m sorry because I know this is judgmental but that thought scares the bejesus out of me. My only response to it is beware the righteous and their anger. <br /><br />Do you think it’s more obscene, as you say, to suspend someone from a website than it is to threaten to punch him out for doing so? Cries of denials of human rights and threats of lawsuits -- It’s been fully acknowledged and even I can see that mistakes were and some people were treated unfairly in this situation but this is proportional response? Please, if my perspective is skewed please let me know in what way.<br /><br />I do see two sides in this conflict, but the outrageous responses from some people lessens my understanding and respect for their position. I don’t like when a group gets together and piles on and beats down on one person, regardless if that person was in the wrong. It’s bullying mob behavior and I don’t like it. <br /><br /><br />To my knowledge I wasn’t trying to categorize Adam&#039;s website, I was merely pointing to one of the most popular topics, merm and astorians.com, which generated 112 comments over 14 pages with 1000+ views, and noting that many were extremely negative, very personal and nasty -- is this not true? Is this not a fact? It was beyond criticism.<br /><br />Regretfully, if that’s the type of discourse and sense of community adam&#039;s site attracts I’ll have to take a pass and if you consider me unfair or judgmental for doing so I’m sorry.<br /><br />To all: If what happen on astorians.com was so injurous to such a significant part of the users where was the spirit of that community, of its people coming together as a group in an attempt to right a wrong? where was the thoughful dissension? the organization to enact change?<br /><br />All I saw was the mob on the rampage: f___ him! Let&#039;s get him! Let&#039;s punch him out! Let&#039;s sue! I&#039;m sorry if that the definition of free speech in the Astoria town square, I am moving out.<br /><br />In all this controversy I’ve noticed that the only one who has acknowledged mistakes have been made, comments misinterpreted and feelings hurt and that person is: Merm.<br /><br />As soon as the anger dies down I hope the people who made, let’s say, unkind statements, come around and realize the part they played in all of this an apologize for it.

				Background and disclaimers:&nbsp; I am a long time Astorians user, approaching three years now.&nbsp; I have seen the board grow and change a lot in that time.&nbsp; I consider merm and wasabisam (and mcdirk) to be my friends.&nbsp; I have met many people here, and with some I enjoy friendship.&nbsp; I am a supporter of the board and have raised money for the board.&nbsp; I was a moderator here for a time.&nbsp; I have organized events and met lots of Astorians as a result. I am a blogger for Joey In Astoria as a result of meeting the original Joey on this board.&nbsp; I became one of the Hellgate CSA Core Group members as a result of my interactions on this board. It has been a great overall community resource and experience for me.&nbsp; In other words, I feel a lot of warmth for the Astorians community.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s important to understand that people use this board in a variety of ways.&nbsp; To say one way is more worthy than another is not very community minded and is condescending.&nbsp; To talk about the anonymous and perhaps &quot;single digit&quot; posters with negative tones... weren&#039;t we all once single digit posters?&nbsp; Weren&#039;t we all anonymous once before?&nbsp; We all were non-supporters at one point, too.&nbsp; To divide the community like that is just not right.<br /><br />A brief note about the Astorians-related discussions on Astorialogues:&nbsp; They were appalling - the attacks were vicious and way over the top.&nbsp; merm is gracious to listen here to those that partook in that discussion, and to consider their POV, after all that.&nbsp; Banning sucks, yes, I agree.&nbsp; But the response by some seemed just too heartless and cruel.<br /><br />I hope that a resolution for the differences can be found.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad the open discussion on the rules is in full swing, and hope that through discussion and discourse we can find something that will work for the benefit of the community at large.

First of all, it&#039;s &quot;<strong>Your</strong> point of view, and I think you mean &quot;<strong>respectfully</strong> disagree.&quot; :mrgreen: <br /><br />I see a tremendous role for moderation. I made a sincere pitch for moderation back in February&#039;s Politics to be Discontinued thread. My response to having my site censored was a moderate, principled plea to merm. I agree with Paine that moderation in temper is a virtue, but moderation in principle is a vice. <br /><br />To my way of thinking, and this is backed up by my overall life experiences (including this most recent hubbub), there is an inherent contradiction in placing so great a value on the appearance of any virtue that one engages in all manner of abhorrent behavior to foster it. You can&#039;t get to decency via vice. Not only does a moderate end not justify suspensions and editing and censoring, a moderate end is impossible when such techniques are employed. <br /><br />To quote the Bible, <br /><br /><em> He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart. </em><br /><br />I believe wholeheartedly that the only moderation truly worth anything is the moderation that results from free and open communication. I call this voluntary moderation, people sorting out their differences as adults. <br /><br />People will always say emotionally intense things, some things that they wish they could take back. And I believe that, in most cases, they should not be interfered with or edited or suspended or censored before they have a chance to experience the effects of such actions. This is how we learn and grow.&nbsp; Freedom and responsibility promote growth; self-censoring and expecting external interventions infantilize (eg, people refer to themselves as being in the naughty corner, they plead with the moderators to let them back in, and the &quot;nods&quot;... :?). The feedback loop works when people are not prevented from experiencing it. Establish rules that remind people that they are free to express themselves and responsible for the content of what they say, they will become better communicators, achieve empathy with those who hurt them or whom they offend, and they will mature, and their relationships will be deeper, truer.&nbsp; <br /><br />Does this work perfectly every time? Of course not. But perfection isn&#039;t the point. Respecting people&#039;s rights as adults to learn from the effects of their choices is a modus operandi I can live with. You see a vicious tantrum, I see a genuine crisis that is a moment along a continuum, one that can only balance itself out in a meaningful way if its participants are left free to communicate and held responsible for what they say by each other. <br /><br />I told merm in February that he was chasing a degree of control that was neither desirable nor feasible, and I stand by that.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=10939.msg134705.html#msg134705">Quote from: 28Grand on June 19, 2008, 03:19:47 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In another post you stated that “truth and facts matter no less on the internet than in the real world”<br /><br />I agree 100% but the questions that follows in my mind is who’s truth?

				I must admit that I liked this board better when I first joined, when the membership was much smaller, when I got to meet and hang out in person with most of the regular posters, when the bulk of the posts were foodie stuff and puns about the FSM, and when there was really only one extremely annoying poster (who hadn&#039;t met <em>any</em> of us in person).<br /><br />IMO it&#039;s getting big and anonymous and the wrong kind of weird.

				Mac, I don’t always agree with you but it pisses me off to see people have decided to “communicate” with their neg nods on this thread.&nbsp; <br /><br />merm, I honestly think the nods are the most offensive thing about the site.&nbsp; Far more offensive than people SHOUTING or cursing or being sarcastic or downright bitchy. Negative Nodding communicates contempt in my opinion.&nbsp; And as far as positive nods go, well big whoop.&nbsp; So someone agrees or likes what was said.&nbsp; &nbsp;Let them post back or say nothing rather than THUMBS UP and THUMBS DOWN.&nbsp; What is this? The Roman Coliseum!&nbsp; It is so offensive and, literally, meaningless.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, Mac, merm has done an amazing job with the creation and maintenance of this site.&nbsp; Before I moved to Jackson Heights, I lived in Astoria.&nbsp; I work a lot at Kaufman Astoria.&nbsp; I belonged to 2 gyms in Astoria, eat there as much as here and basically still feel very connected to it so I love this site for helping me stay in touch with a place I lived in, still spend time in and now live next door to.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I have no idea what you mean by “But apparently membership in this club is supporting the non-donating member, ass-kissing flocks of sheep that will maintain the status quo regardless of the consequences.”&nbsp; &nbsp;But that is an offensive comment. If it&#039;s not, I&#039;d love it explained.<br /><br />You are at times witty and warm and outrageous and rude. (Sometimes all at once which is an achievement, I admit.)&nbsp; &nbsp;But the point I’m making is you love to push people’s buttons.&nbsp; &nbsp;Why should you, or anyone, be allowed free reign to act out and say whatever you choose?&nbsp; Just because this site has grown from it’s inception does that mean people should be allowed to act or express themselves anyway they want to?&nbsp; Because the site is an online Town Square?&nbsp; I am confused by that.&nbsp; Please don’t read what I just wrote as contempt.&nbsp; It is honest confusion. And if that freedom to say whatever you want is paramount to your enjoyment of a site, then why can’t it be expressed on astorialogues where it’s accepted and applauded?&nbsp; Why can’t two sites with different attitudes co-exist?&nbsp; It seems to me that the people who are supporting astorialogues want to make this site over to a mirror image.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Mac,&nbsp; I completely agree with you on this: the rules are not written out to explain punishment or retribution and they should be.&nbsp; The rules should clearly state the progression of warnings and/or suspensions.&nbsp; And they don’t.&nbsp; If I were suspended for something, I’d want to know why but more importantly, I’d want a warning before a suspension.&nbsp; If that is not what is happening now, then I think it should change.&nbsp; And I’m guessing that it will change based on what merm has said.&nbsp; The other thing I agree with is that this site has changed from its inception but I don’t agree that that means it is now the domain of the members.&nbsp; I understand how much this site means to the members; especially the ones who fully use it to meet up and share experiences. But it’s not public domain.&nbsp; If I’m wrong about that, I’m sure someone will correct me. <br /><br />And as far as people governing themselves, Adamwc, I have yet to see it happening well anywhere.&nbsp; Your site is too new to say how well that theory will work. But it’s great that you started a site to put your beliefs into action. I don’t like your site and yes it’s based on one very nasty, mean spirited thread.&nbsp; Sometimes first impressions are all we get. Did it make me want to read further? No it did not.&nbsp; Does that mean I don’t think your site should exist or I want it to fail. Again, no it does not.&nbsp; It just means we all see things differently or want different things out of our online community.

Basically, it boils down to this: For the most part, you all freaking rule, and I appreciate differences of opinion (except for obvious douchebags looking to get a rise out of people, and they&#039;re easily ignored/identified as trolls), but I love that I can freely say &quot;hey, I don&#039;t agree with you, and this is why..,&quot; and I love Astoria, and I love Astorians and how it&#039;s enriched my life here, but please let&#039;s all take a day off and BREATHE. Also, franks in blanks (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=10952) party on my roof with the Strawberry Moon (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=10923), stat! Kthxbye.)</span>

				FIRST.&nbsp; I would like to thank Merm for ending my suspension early.(thank you Merm)<br />SECOND . I WOULD LIKE TO PERSONALY APPOLOGIZE TO MERM FOR ANYTHING I SAID ON THE OTHER BOARD THAT HE OR ANYONE ELSE HERE WOULD FIND OFFENSIVE (Merm i do apologize)<br />Now to get down with the business at hand <br />#1&nbsp; the nods....i personally enjoy the nods....while there are people who will neg nod specific posters for saying the sky is blue and there are those who neg nod me no matter what is said.i will admit to neg nodding one particular poster whom i have had a previous words with but that&#039;s just because he/she takes it so badly (PS. i take my neg nods as a badge of honor)<br />#2 suspensions/ banishment ...while i do think that this is Merm&#039;s board and he can do with it as he pleases i do hope he reconsiders the banishment part ( since my next suspension will be a permanent ban,i do hope he does it quickly )<br />#3 the politics board ... it seems to me that this is where most of the disagreements come from.politics is a subject that seems to bring out passionate responces from those on both sides .while i have always considered myself a Conservative independent i at times feel like a far right republican on this board and that&#039;s OK , but there should be a amount of civility afforded those with minority views. my suggestions would be ..(a) a disclaimer stating the above with no moderation <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (b) when thing get heated up,ask them to &quot;step outside&quot;and go to the astorialouges board.<br />#4 trolling ...i think that trolling is in the eye of the beholder, people have accused a certain poster of trolling ... i disagree&nbsp; he is in my opinion a true beleiver in what he feels, just because you may not agree with his posts ,i feel he is trying to make his point and he is steadfast in his belief ,more power to him<br /><br /><br /><br />well i think this is all for now . so before i am banned ( it is just a matter of time) i would like to send some love to all who use this board and wish you all the best of luck <br /><br />odenhal out<br />

				i&#039;ve been thinking on this whole thing and i think this medium caters to misunderstandings.&nbsp; when you write something (as opposed to a face-to-face) things are more easily misconstrued.&nbsp; at my last job that was one of the main comments made to me from my superiors.&nbsp; they thought my emails were a bit abrupt at times, and although they knew it wasn&#039;t meant in any negative way, they warned me to constantly edit myself so that there aren&#039;t any misunderstandings.&nbsp; a simple sentence can be read a lot of different ways, depending on the &quot;voice&quot; or &quot;tone&quot; that one puts on it.<br /><br />astorians.com is pretty informative, and i think that&#039;s the main reason i check in so often.&nbsp; on that note, i think it serves it&#039;s purpose.&nbsp; on the otherhand, i think when it comes to the issues that are debatable, these recent events have hindered the forum...especially more recently.<br /><br />since reading all of these recent comments about the rules and regulations, i find that i&#039;m more tentative in the postings that i make, and i&#039;m not so sure that&#039;s a good thing.&nbsp; it almost defeats the purpose of some of these threads.&nbsp; it&#039;s one thing to be blatantly disrespectful or insulting toward others, but it&#039;s another to be passionate about one&#039;s (differing) opinion.&nbsp; i can understand how the former wouldn&#039;t be tolerated, but the latter?<br /><br />i&#039;ll be the first to say that i don&#039;t know all the facts that started this line, but it just seems that a lot has been made of some comments made on a forum where there should be a lot A LOT of room for expression.&nbsp; i think it&#039;s an almost impossible task for the moderators to be accurate all of the time, as what&#039;s insulting to one person, may not be insulting to another.&nbsp; instead of having the moderators making these decisions, it should be more dependent on the the community reporting/commenting what they deem offense.&nbsp; then in those grey areas, the moderators can be the final word.&nbsp; i think when it&#039;s left up to the people, things eventually sort themselves out.&nbsp; and i also think this is far more effective than the &quot;nod&quot; system, which i&#039;m not convinced works at all, really.
