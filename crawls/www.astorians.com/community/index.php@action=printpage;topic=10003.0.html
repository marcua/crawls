				Hi,<br />I live in the Bway/31st are and am looking to go on about a 10 mile ride nightly...anybody know of any good routes. I&#039;ve been doing the ride up 35th, up to the park and then back down, but it&#039;s not long enough for me.<br /><br />Also, anybody down for a biking partner, after work for an hour and then weekends, for ~20 miles or so?<br /><br />I&#039;m still a novice and slowish, but i&#039;m getting better. Any help would be GREAT.<br />thanks!<br />

				I&#039;m a pretty avid biker here, and the good part about after work rides is that it stays light so much longer. <br />Get a bikemap from your local bikeshop- they&#039;re proveded free from the city. If you&#039;re looking for a 10 mile loop, I generally find a good ride is down crescent to the 59th street, over and back.&nbsp; I generally do that loop 3-4 nights/week and I ride in to the central park loop on weekends. Another fun ride is the triboro to randalls, into the city and down to the 59th st bridge and back up.<br />If you&#039;re ever looking to ride with a buddy, shoot me a PM, there&#039;s safety in numbers on the road, and I&#039;m always up for riding with friends. It helps keep you in pace and challenges you to up your level of riding generally.

It&#039;s very deceptive because you don&#039;t realize that all suspension bridges are big hills. From Queens to Manhattan, it&#039;s a long incline followed by a steeper, shorter downhill. From Manhattan to Queens, it&#039;s a steeper, shorter incline followed by a long downhill. <br />I commute to my office in Union Square from the Ditmars area about 2-3 times a week during the nicer seasons, and it takes me +/-45 minutes depending on my pace. <br />Thanks for the mapmyrun link, I would have never thought to use that!

				Depending on where you are headed in Manhattan (downtown mostly) sometimes it can be more pleasant to take the Pulaski Bridge into Brooklyn and then take the Williamsburg or Brooklyn Bridge into lower Manhattan.&nbsp; I can say that if you are a cyclist, you should be seeing some nice new features in Western Queens this year from the DoT, they&#039;ve already started out the season by finally striping 35th St to complement the 36th St bike lane, and they even put easy to see &quot;chevron&quot; markings going across the intersections to remind motorists that this is a bike lane.<br /><br />Our group the Transportation Alternatives Queens Committee &nbsp;(http://groups.google.com/group/TAWQ)does a lot of biking stuff.&nbsp; We have a lot of folks looking for people to ride with and we try to put on at least one ride a month.&nbsp; We keep a calendar of events that you can see on our google group (http://groups.google.com/group/TAWQ).
