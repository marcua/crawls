				Hi-<br /><br />Does anyone live in a co-op or condo in Astoria that they are happy with? Iam currenetly on the market for a 2 bedroom- and I have not had much luck. Iam looking for suggestions on good buildings or places to avoid.There seems to be a very limited number of affordable, nice places available to buy. Or maybe I just picked a bad time to look?<br /><br />&nbsp;Any feedback would be appreciated! <br />Thanks, urrisgirl

				Well I am not sure, where exactly in Astoria (zip code wise) you are looking and what your budget is but here goes..<br /><br />In Astoria seems to be alot of pre-war co-ops on Crescent, and there is Shore Towers a really nice Condo building.&nbsp; If you look on craigslist you will see a lot of condos for sale in upper ditmars and some co-ops in Boulavard Gardens (woodside)<br /><br />Along the water in Long Island City/Astoria (11106) A new building just came up known as Hallets Cove (31st and Vernon). The apartments are ok in my opinion, somewhat loft style with the kitchen in the living room.&nbsp; You can find this building if you search realestate.nytimes.com and look for Long Island City.<br /><br />Speaking of Long Island City there is alot going on there, but of course thinks are pricy there.. look at about $600 per sq ft. I just checked out&nbsp; Queens Plaza:&nbsp; http://thedevelopersgroup.com/buildings/building.aspx?buildingid=1056&amp;<br />Which is where else but at the base of Queen Plaza Station. Very nicely done buidling, and in my opinion worth the cost, area is shotty but thats the best place to invest.<br /><br />Also there is http://44-27Purves.com nice again relatively affordable building for LIC, this is walking distance to Citigroup.<br /><br />hope this helps a little good luck

				The basic problem is that there just aren&#39;t a lot of co-op or condo buildings in Astoria, and not many people are selling. Also, 2 bedrooms are pretty hard to come by. <br /><br />The other question is what you are looking for. If you want a newer condo building there is Shore Towers (which is nice, but really far from anything) or another building on 30th rd, i think, just off Crescent. Both have great views, but really boring, cookie cutter apartments.&nbsp; There is also a new building on 31st Ave and Vernon. The outside of the building is hideous, but apparently the apts are not so bac, and not too expensive if you don&#39;t want a manhattan view, but again, far, far away.<br /><br />If you are looking for pre war, most of the buildings are co-ops. These tend to be a litlle bit more interesting, but you will have to jump through more hoops and there are not many. I can recommend the Concord and the Mayflower, both around crescent and 31st Ave.<br /><br />I hope that&#39;s helpful

				You could try North Queensview Houses complex on 21st street.&nbsp; There are 2 and 3 bedroom apartments. The Queensview Houses, across the street, have a similar, if not identical layout.&nbsp; <br /><br />The aparments are located between 34th ave and 33rd ave.<br /><br />
