			I was passing by and noticed the former Fatty&#039;s has a new tenant and was wondering if anybody knows what this might be?

			It&#039;s going to be a pharmacy.&nbsp; What a waste of space for that location!&nbsp; I live right over there.&nbsp; Let&#039;s see how many people go there when they could walk up to the CVS on 31st St.&nbsp; Even though I will only have to walk half a block to get there I will not use this pharmacy. I&#039;m sorry that Fatty&#039;s had to move because of this.

			Bummer&nbsp; :sad: To be honest I thought it was going to be some type of bar

			I knew the owner&#039;s of Fatty&#039;s and they told me the owner wanted them to move so a pharmacy could open there... oh well. I predict it won&#039;t last long.&nbsp; Crescent Apothecary is also a strange name.

			The pharmacist&#039;s parents own the building, so I wouldn&#039;t expect the new tenant to be going anywhere anytime soon.
