				I've been trying to adopt a kitten for a couple of weeks and it seems very difficult and arduous to do so in NYC. &nbsp;Even with a perfectly healthy and happy 3 yr old cat that I raised from 9 weeks (adopted from a family friend who took in a stray mother),having screens on my windows, feeding high quality food, and excellent vet references I keep running into these crazy cat rescue groups/fosters who try to push an adult cat on me if I do not want to take two kittens. &nbsp;They also all seem to want to check in on my apartment twice a week until the kitten is 6 months old, which I think is a little excessive.<br /><br />Perhaps someone here fosters and isn't quite that distrustful or can point me in the right direction? &nbsp;More people would be open to adoption if it was just accessible here and not so full of red tape. &nbsp;I understand some of their reasons, but still...<br /><br />Thanks!

				We adopted our cat just over a year ago from a Manhattan shelter on the UES. He was about 8 months old at the time, but there were cats and kittens there of varying ages.<br /><br />While we had to put down money for him, it was still pretty minimal. The only thing is that they require that all animals leaving their shelters are spayed or neutered, if they are not already. So in some instances, such as ours, you are unable to pick him or her up until s/he has had the surgery (performed there by one of their veternarians).<br /><br />They also didn't do an aggressive background check as they supposedly used to do. We essentially could go up there, look at their cats, say &quot;I want that one&quot; and then that one would be ours after paying, and taking care of the smaller details.<br /><br />All in all, it was a pretty straightforward process and we are very happy with our cat. Here's the link to the shelter we went to: http://www.nycacc.org/site/c.ikLTJ9MUKtH/b.540513/k.CB5A/Home/apps/s/inline.asp

				Thank you so much! &nbsp;I had come across them through Petfinder, but have yet to contact them. &nbsp;Cost is not a factor, but rationality is. &nbsp;The women I met with this weekend were stereotypical cat ladies who insisted on inspecting my apartment and then visiting twice a week to make sure things remain &quot;healthy&quot;. &nbsp;One woman went so far as to criticize me for using clumping litter while she blew second hand smoke into the caged kittens faces. &nbsp;<br /><br />I'm also fine with an older cat, except the one that the above mentioned woman was trying to foist upon me yesterday was very skittish and kept hissing and swatting at not only the kittens caged next to it but at random people. &nbsp;Yet somehow this was the &quot;perfect&quot; kitty for us.

				Yeah my husband had actually wanted to surprise me with a kitten last year, and so he went and picked out a very cute kitten from this lady somewhere out in Queens (I think), but she was a &quot;cat-lady&quot; and finally told him that he couldn't have the cat because she didn't know if it would be treated properly and if our apartment would be okay. What a waste of time!<br /><br />We love our cat, and I can't imagine life without him. He's pretty perfect (except for those few moments of insanity which cats often have) in my opinion.<br /><br />I can't visit that website too often (the shelter's) because I start wanting to adopt more... :) It's a great place to go, but you do have the hassle of having to carry him/her on the subway, which can be frightening for them. Thankfully my cat is silent in his fear, so he didn't cause much of a commotion... Of course there is the option of doing a cab or bus...

				The Brooklyn Animal Rescue Center (BARC) is a wonderful place. &nbsp;They are a no-kill shelter on Wythe Avenue in Williamsburg. &nbsp;I got a wonderful cat from them several years ago -- she was a feral, but blossomed into the most fantastic roommate one could ever hope for. &nbsp;And the people there are (or at least were) great! &nbsp;<br /><br />They get in a lot of kittens, but they have a pretty &quot;high turnover.&quot; &nbsp;They have a lot of older cats (which I actually prefer), but I can't imagine them trying to force one off on you if that isn't what you are looking for. &nbsp;From what I remember, they do ask for references, but nothing excessive. &nbsp;I believe that there is a link to them on PetFinder as well.

				I had a wonderful experience adopting a cat from this place in Astoria:<br /><br />http://www.francisfriends.org<br /><br />As far as I can tell, it's sort of a small network of people who foster cats until homes are found for them.<br /><br />I looked at their listing of cats, saw one I was interested in, and called them up. The woman actually brought the cat over to my apartment, and offered to let me keep her for a couple days to decide if I wanted to keep her. If not, she would come back and get her. Fortunately for me (and kitty), she was just the right cat for me and I kept her!<br /><br />The whole process was very informal, I didn't actually have to submit the application (or have reference checks!), we covered that all in conversation.
