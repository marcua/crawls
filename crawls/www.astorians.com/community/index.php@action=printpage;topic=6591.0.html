				Actually, there are places in Manhattan that are safe havens for Red Sox fans.&nbsp; I used to go to the Rivera Bar in the West Village because of their awesome drink specials ($2.50 for any beer, tap or bottle, import or domestic and $3.50 for most top shelf liquors and mixed drinks!&nbsp; All of this from 4 to 7 PM) and they had a huge Boston/New England crowd.&nbsp; Apparently, one of the bartenders was a big fan and he brought a huge contingent of fans from the previous bar he worked at.&nbsp; The word spread and it became an official Boston bar!&nbsp; One night, a fight almost broke out when a bunch of Yankee fans &quot;crashed&quot; the bar, already drunk and looking to antagonize the Boston crowd!&nbsp; It got so ugly that I decided to take a break from a bar that had been one of my usual spots for over 10 years!&nbsp; :cry:

				I&#039;ve found a few Red Sox bars in Manhattan, but I don&#039;t want to have to go there every day to catch the games. I was hoping to find a contingent of Astorian BoSoxers to watch games with here, at least part of the time. Granted, the big games are more fun at the big Sox bars on that other island, but it would be nice to watch the others, too.

				I saw a few brave (or stupid, depending on how you look at it) Red Sox fans at Broadway Station during the ALCS a few years ago!&nbsp; I think it would be a lot harder to find a Red Sox bar in the outer boroughs for the obvious reason that there are probably less expats living here.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Count me in!&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m a native New Englander who has accepted everything in New York City except for the sports teams.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve retained my affiliation to the Boston teams, with the BoSox nearest and dearest to my heart.<br /><br />I go way back too.&nbsp; &nbsp;My father took me to my first game at Fenway in 1966 and throughout my youth we would make the trek to Fenway several times each summer.&nbsp; &nbsp; I suffered through the &#039;78 collapse while in college and can still remember sitting in my frat house when Bucky Dent hit the ball over the wall off Mike Torrez.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then there was &#039;86 with Buckner letting the ball slip through his legs.&nbsp; &nbsp;I viewed that one in San Francisco while on a business trip.&nbsp; &nbsp;And of course there was &#039;03 when dumbo Grady Little left Pedro in way too long.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was at the New York Film Festival and had my walkman and periodically would turn on the radio to get updated scores.&nbsp; &nbsp;I remember watching the end of the game at that bar diagonally across the street from Carnegie Hall.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is an Irish pub.&nbsp; &nbsp;I remember Boone&#039;s homer.&nbsp; <br /><br />Finally came &#039;04 and the great comeback against the Yankees.&nbsp; &nbsp; The World Series was an anti-climax.&nbsp; &nbsp;How could you top the BoSox-Yankees?<br /><br />The Yankees finally awoke from their &#039;07 slumber and have now won 7 in a row, while shaving about 4 games or so off the lead.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is now 9 1/2 I think.&nbsp; &nbsp;As someone who suffered through &#039;78 I remain paranoid.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Yankees are never out of it.

				Let&#039;s go Mets!&nbsp; &nbsp; Who would have thunk the reeling Mets would have beat -- let alone shut out -- the surging Yankees.&nbsp; &nbsp;And the BoSox are kicking S.F&#039;s ass so we get a game back.&nbsp; &nbsp;This was the game I least expected the Mets to win with the up-and-down Oliver Perez against the might Rocket.&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, Mets did us a good turn.<br /><br />Tomorrow I believe it is Glavine vs. Tyler Clippard, the weakest of the Yankees starters.

				Well, the BoSox kicked some serious ass this weekend, sweeping the Giants, but it looks like we&#039;ll only get a game back, Friday&#039;s.&nbsp; &nbsp;Dice K was awesome on Saturday.&nbsp; Tom Glavine and El Duque laid big eggs Saturday and Sunday respectively as the Yankees&#039; bats came alive the last two days.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Yankees continue to roll.<br /><br />The Mets&#039; problem is they don&#039;t have a stopper, though Perez looks like he might be one or could turn into one.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am still puzzled why San Diego and Pittsburgh gave up on him, a guy his age with his stuff.&nbsp; &nbsp;Though, I still don&#039;t buy Perez, Maine and Sosa.&nbsp; Then you have Glavine and El Duque well past their prime.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m skeptical about how well ex-BoSox pitcher Pedro will do when -- and it is looking more like when than if these day -- he comes back.&nbsp; &nbsp;Omar may need a top flight pitcher and possibly a bat if Alou is out and Delgado continues to slump.&nbsp; &nbsp;He took the &quot;golden sombrero&quot; the other night against Clemons &amp; co.<br /><br />

				The Sox picked up a game last night as the Rockies shut down the Yankees.&nbsp; &nbsp;It shows you have tough it will be for the Yankees to cut that lead.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Yanks recently won nine in a row and are still nine games out.&nbsp; &nbsp;A big disadvantage for the Yankees is that they don&#039;t play the Sox very much the rest of the way.<br /><br />Beckett has won 10 and has to be on the short list for the American League Cy Young.&nbsp; &nbsp;That trade that brought Beckett over from the Marlins is one of those trades that may benefit both teams.&nbsp; &nbsp; The Sox gave up their top prospect, Henley Ramirez, a shortstop, who played well for the Marlins last year.&nbsp; &nbsp;The pitcher the Sox also gave the Marlins has pitched well.&nbsp; &nbsp;His name is Alay Solar I think and he threw a no-no last year as a Rookie.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I noticed in the box score last night that David Ortiz made a rare start at 1B after sitting out Monday&#039;s game.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Sox get crucified in these interleague games when they can&#039;t use the DH because they have to sit Big Papi, Youkalis or Lowell.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hopefully, Coca Crisp is coming around.&nbsp; &nbsp;He hit two homers in that Monday night loss.&nbsp; He&#039;s been a bust since the Sox shipped another top prospect, Marte, who they got from the Braves for Edgar Renteria, who bombed in his one year in Boston.&nbsp; &nbsp;J.D. Drew, a real curious off-season free-agent signing, has also not exactly lit the world on fire.&nbsp; &nbsp;And in the Sox revolving door of shortstops, Julio Lugo has flirted with the Mendoza line this year.&nbsp; &nbsp; Hopefully, these guys will get untracked.<br /><br />What is up with BoSox and their shortshops?&nbsp; &nbsp;Since Garciaparra was traded in &#039;04, the Sox have had Orlando Cabrera, Renteria, Alex Gonzalez and now Lugo.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Also, Schilling, after his near no-no two starts ago, has bombed in his last two starts and has been sent back to Boston to have his arm checked.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hopefully, all will be well.&nbsp; &nbsp; The Sox have Jon Lester waiting in the wings and they could always move Papelbon into the rotation and make that &quot;other&quot; Japanese pitcher, I forget his name, the closer.

				I turned the game on around 9:30 and the Sox were up 8-0 I think, with Manny, Big Papi, Coco Crisp and Drew hitting homers.&nbsp; &nbsp;And Tavares, the weak link among the starters, was on the mound and pitching a shutout.<br /><br />One blip on the radar screen is Schilling going on the DL for at least two weeks with what hopefully is only tendenitis.

				Well, the Yankees lost last night, the Sox won, and the lead is back to double digits, exactly 10.&nbsp; &nbsp;You&#039;ve gotta give the Rockies their props because they took two-out-of-three from the Sox and have taken two-out-of-three from the Yankees.&nbsp; &nbsp;It could be a sweep if they win this afternoon.&nbsp; &nbsp;Rocket is pitching for the Yankees.

				Yeah, I just like the Sox to beat the Yankees.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anything else is an anti-climax.&nbsp; &nbsp;The real series in &#039;04 as far as I am concerned was between the Sox &amp; the Yankees.&nbsp; &nbsp;That World Series was a dud.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Cards just laid down.<br /><br />Schilling is on the DL and the Sox called up an outfielder named Murphy.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I was a kid I could have told you every player on every team and I even knew the minor leaguers.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am cheating, but I bought that &quot;Baseball America&quot; book that lists the top prospects for each team.&nbsp; &nbsp; Murphy is not an elite prospect, though he was the Sox first round pick back in &#039;03.&nbsp; &nbsp;He&#039;s not a kid either because he was drafted out of Baylor.&nbsp; &nbsp;He&#039;ll turn 26 in October.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Sox are out on the left coast so the box score wasn&#039;t in this a.m.&#039;s paper, but the FAN just said Dice K outdueled Maddox in a pitcher&#039;s duel.&nbsp; &nbsp; It was 2-1 and Dice K is starting to pay some big dividends are getting off to a somewhat shaky start.<br /><br />The Yankees didn&#039;t pick up ground even though they thumped San Fran.

				Well the lead now is up to 11 1/2 and the Yankees are once again reeling.<br /><br />Saturday was a wash as both the Yankees and the Sox lost.&nbsp; &nbsp;Yesterday, in a dream matchup of the 9-1 Peavy and the 10-1 Beckett was won by Beckett and since the Yanks lost to S.F., another game was picked up.&nbsp; &nbsp;Beckett is on track to win the Cy Young.
