				Hi!<br /><br />As some of you may know, for the past 5 years, I&#39;ve been the Astoria organizer for an event called September Concert.&nbsp; September Concert happens every September 11 and the goal is to bring people together on September 11 through the power of music.&nbsp; For more information on September Concert please visit the website at http://www.septemberconcert.org.&nbsp; On the website, you&#39;ll also be able to view documentary clips and photos from concerts in past years.&nbsp; This started as a city-wide event, but has become international in scope, with cities participating as far away as Japan.<br /><br />In years past, I&#39;ve placed volunteer musicians at about 10 small businesses in the neighborhood, mostly along Ditmars and Steinway.&nbsp; Once again, I&#39;m looking for volunteer musicians, and would also like to extend an invitation to any local business owners on this list who&#39;d like to get involved.&nbsp; <br /><br />Although I&#39;ll continue to do some placement of musicians at venues, this year, we&#39;d really like to encourage people to arrange their own events as well.&nbsp; The only requirement is that all events must be free and open to the public.&nbsp; This is an all-volunteer effort, so no one is getting paid.&nbsp; It&#39;s really about the spirit of community, and since this is such a terrific neighborhood, I&#39;d made it my mission to make sure Astoria is well-represented each year.&nbsp; <br /><br />Venues do not have to be traditional music venues.&nbsp; Past venues have included cafes, restaurants, a take-out noodle shop, bagel shops, and a haircutting place, where the owner each year plays outside between hair appointments!&nbsp; It&#39;s really open for all kinds of involvement, whether you play classical, jazz, bluegrass, pop or are a singer-songwriter; whether you make music for a living, or as a hobby.&nbsp; Since many of these untraditional &quot;venues&quot; don&#39;t have a PA system, anything unplugged is especially welcome.<br /><br />This year, September falls on a Monday.&nbsp; We will schedule music events anywhere from noon to midnight.<br /><br />If you&#39;d like to be involved in any way, please send me an email at SeptemberAstoria@allisontartalia.com.<br /><br />Thanks so much for reading.&nbsp; I look forward to hearing from you!<br /><br />Best,<br />Allison Tartalia<br />Astoria Organizer<br />September Concert<br />

				I&#39;m the bass player for sputniksdown, currently a 3/5ths Astorian band.&nbsp; We&#39;re currently playing the Warped Tour but will be back in plenty of time for festival and would love to play a show close to home.<br /><br />You can check out our stuff at http://myspace.com/sputniksdown (our main website http://www.sputniksdown.com/ ) is currently being updated/prettyfitized.<br /><br />

				Hey,<br /><br />Thanks for your reply, and congrats on doing the warped tour!<br /><br />Would you be able to perform completely unplugged?&nbsp; These are small, non-traditional venues, so there&#39;s no PA system.<br /><br />Best,<br />Allison
