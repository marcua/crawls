				I know there have been posts on this before, but they are a few months old, so figured I would start a new one.<br /><br />Hey everyone,&nbsp; I am looking to get a semi-regular poker game going on weekends.&nbsp; Stakes would be $0.25/$0.50 bets.&nbsp; So nothing crazy.&nbsp; Of course we could through down for a tourney once in a while.&nbsp; I really just want to make this a friendly game for guys who like playing cards, and not looking to make this a feeding frenzy for all the sharks out there.&nbsp; If anyone is interested, let me know.

				I think I might have been one of the previous posters.&nbsp; I&#039;m always up for a game and I&#039;ve got a handful of others who wants to play, but some of them are beginners.&nbsp;

				Beginners are always welcome.&nbsp; That&#039;s why I like keeping the stakes low so even if you lose all night, you&#039;re only out about $20-$30.&nbsp; Well worth it for a night of learning.&nbsp; I am not exactly an expert either, so no worries there.&nbsp; If you want to merge games, I am definitely up for that as I can usually get a handful of guys together for a game.

				This 0.25/0.50 stake is RIGHT up my alley. I would love to get involved in a home game like this, or play in a fairly low stakes tournament. Did this pick up any steam?
