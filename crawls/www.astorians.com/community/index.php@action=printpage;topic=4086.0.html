				I&#39;ve been having problems with ConEd. They can never get access to our meter so most of the time we&#39;re paying estimated bills. This is my landlord&#39;s fault as the meters are in his basement and he&#39;s never home (this is a two-family house). So finally he calls in a reading (after four months!) and we get an adjusted bill and it is absolutely astronomical, especially considering we lost power for eight days in July.<br /><br />I talk to ConEd, they agree to verify the reading the next time they&#39;re scheduled to come out, which is next month. I shoot an email off to my landlord explaining the situation, and he responds a few minutes later saying he can&#39;t think that far ahead (three weeks, for the record) and that he&#39;s very busy. So I respond saying that we&#39;re all busy, but I&#39;d appreciate him working with me on this, and I mention that the meter hadn&#39;t been read for four months. Well, he gets a bit hot, I get a bit hot, and it ends with him saying that he wants us out at the end of this month.<br /><br />Now, we&#39;re not leaving at the end of the month, as that&#39;s not even 30 days&#39; notice. Plus, we have a lease that doesn&#39;t expire until September 1 of next year. I plan on reminding him of this and telling him that unfortunately there&#39;s no way we&#39;re leaving by the end of the current month. Because of this insanity we&#39;ve decided to move anyway, but I have a feeling he might try something like changing the locks on us. I have no qualms about calling the cops if he does that.<br /><br />What a fucked up Friday this turned out to be.

				There is a housing advisor in Astoria, call her, she may be able to give you advice on how to proceed with this. &nbsp;I&#39;m not sure if private residences fall under the 6 month eviction rule, but I think so. &nbsp;He is not allowed to evict you just like that, and legally you would have 6 months to vacate the apartment. &nbsp;I would move too, but I think you&#39;ll be able to get a court order to be able to move within the 6 months. &nbsp;Look into it and good luck.<br /><br />http://centralastoria.org/services.htm<br /><br />http://www.housingnyc.com/ &nbsp;-This site may give more info on your rights.

				Thanks for the links, Daisy. I will definitely be drafting a response to him asserting my rights. These will certainly help. :)

				Tracer Bullet, if you have a lease, that&#39;s binding on your landlord, too.&nbsp; Not just you.&nbsp; (Unless of course it&#39;s an illegal apartment, in which case you don&#39;t owe any rent.)&nbsp; &nbsp;You can stay until the end of the lease.<br /><br />Absolutely call the police if he changes the locks.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also maybe you can sue him for the Con Ed thing.&nbsp; Might be worth talking to a lawyer.

				Does anyone know of a good and reasonable lawyer that can give a quick opinion on my lease? There&#39;s a clause in it which I think is unenforceable, but I want to ensure I&#39;m on solid legal ground before I respond to my landlord.

I actually work at a real estate company in the city and so was planning on seeing if any lawyer there could give me a little pro bono advice as well.<br /><br />I agree with you about these two and three-family homes. We will not be renting a place in one again. I understand now that the landlords, more often than not, feel like since it&#39;s &quot;their house&quot; they can do whatever they want. <br /><br />I do not plan on talking or emailing with him again. If he doesn&#39;t realize that email isn&#39;t proper notice, then I&#39;m not going to do anything to dissuade him of that.
