				Hello,<br /><br />I have been renting in Astoria for nearly two years now and I would like to buy a home in Astoria or the surrounding area.<br /><br />I will be a first-time buyer, so I am inexperienced with buying real estate.&nbsp; Does anyone know of a helpful guide or primer online I could read to educate myself on buying in Queens/NYC?&nbsp; There seem to be certain terms specific to this area (e.g., 15-year tax abatement) that I would like to read up on.<br /><br />Thanks.

				A tax abatement isnt specific only to this area , its actually done in&nbsp; all of NYS . I would suggest if you do find a place that your interested in first , and the buyer tells you it has a tax abatement , make sure your lawyer does research to make sure it is true . If he or she doesnt know abt tax abatements , since alot of real estate lawyers dont , find a lawyer who specializes in them . You can do plenty of research online all abt them or any other questions you might have abt mortgages , points , rates , differences between 15 and 30 yr mortgages&nbsp; and much much more .&nbsp; Astoria is a great place to buy a home , since the location is prime , being next to Manhattan . Prices though will be higher then alot of other nice areas , like Bayside , Whitestone etc etc . <br />What other terms did you mean were specific to this area alone ?

				There are some books on Amazon that are about buying in the New York market, but I&#039;ve only read The New York Co-op Bible (http://bit.ly/6BYxpA). It&#039;s about both co-ops and condos.

				Thanks for the replies.<br /><br />We&#039;re primarily interested in 1 or 2-BR condos.&nbsp; Trying to stay away from co-ops and the restrictions and greater monthly fees they entail.<br /><br />There seem to be a number of newly constructed condos in the 30th and 31st Ave. area that we&#039;re looking in.&nbsp; The asking prices are a bit high but I hope to see how low they&#039;re willing to go.

				Well no matter what they ask , if they dont sell they will be forced to lower the prices in these days . Pistilli has condos in upper ditmars&nbsp; he built and couldnt sell them at his asking price , and now he has them as apts he rents for the most part . He would prob take much lower offers now .&nbsp; Just be aware on 30th ave how noisy and crowded its gotten and might get even worse .&nbsp; Sometimes its a little better to be a little further away from the traffic ,plus u would pay less /
