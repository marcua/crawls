				Hi there:<br /><br />Having my first baby in October and need to find a paediatrician. Got a recommendation from a friend but it&#039;s too far away. We&#039;re down near the park and don&#039;t have a car so somewhere along ditmars or the surrounding area would be good. <br /><br />Thanks. <br /><br />

				Please don&#039;t settle for local. Get as many recommendations as you can, and then schedule fee-free appointments to interview each of those in your health insurance plan. You need to know who it is that will be responsible for the health of your baby and not just that they are convenient to your home. <br /><br />Also bear in mind that our local hospital Mt. Sinai of Queens (a.k.a. Astoria&#039;s Pre-Funeral Home) does not have any pediatricians affiliated with them. In case of an emergency you will need to go to the nearest hospital where your doctor as privileges!

				I can recommend&nbsp; my daughter&#039;s pediatrician, Dr.&nbsp; Irma Matos Rivera. She works from the HIP Center on 25th/Broadway.&nbsp; She is affiliated with&nbsp; several different hospitals in Queens -&nbsp; the names escape me at the moment but they are convenient. Lots of experience, Cornell Med School grad - cool and calm. Highly recommend. I found her when I was pregnant and interviewing doctors -&nbsp; that&#039;s good advice&nbsp; from Mama Mac.

When I moved to Queens, my son was almost three and it took a while to find a competent (sane) kid doctor. Dr. Matos-Rivera has been great. PM me if you need the number or addres. I realize Broadway and 23rd isn&#039;t close but it isn&#039;t far either.

				I highly recommend Astoria Pediatric Associates at 23 ave and 35th st.&nbsp; My daughters have been going there since they were born.&nbsp; Dr. Chris is their primary doctor, but there are 4 other Drs in the office who we&#039;ve seen at various times and all are excellent.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you have any concerns or questions you can call and a doctor will always make themselves available to speak to you.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had to leave a message or call back later.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure about their various hospital affiliations, however&nbsp; I second NYCMacUser that you want to avoid Mt Sinai Queens at all cost.<br /><br />Good luck.

				Thanks everybody. All these pre-baby preparations are a bit overwhelming. Obviously ditmars would be preferable but of course I&#039;d be willing to go further afield for proper care for my baby. I&#039;ll start making appointments with your suggestions and see how I get on. <br /><br />I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll have more questions in the coming months!!!

				I second Astoria Pediatric.&nbsp; My childrens primary doctor is Dr. Mike.&nbsp; There are a group of doctors there and they have early/late hours.&nbsp; When my son was born we were seeing another dr in another practice but I did not like him all that much and when my son was about 1 year old, I switched to Dr. Mike.&nbsp; I have been happy with them.

				Dr. Ganea at Our Neighborhood Medical in Sunnyside. I met with him recently for a meet &amp; greet before my little one is due in July. I immediately felt comfortable there and he was great. He listened to my opinions on things and offered me his opinion. I got his name from my OB--whom I love and trust a ton--one of her patients uses Dr. Ganea and raves... I stopped the search after I met with him. It is very close to Astoria as well... only 3 stops on away on the 7 (about 10 min. in a car)
