				<strong>Come one come all to Green Thumb Farm:)</strong><br /><em><br />Fill up the gas tank and let&#039;s get over to our farm!</em><br /><strong>Saturday, June 23 at 10:30am and 1pm</strong> we are all set for our summer strawberry picking farm visit. Itâ€™s a walking tour open to CSA members and their families. We&#039;ll get to check out the farm and pick our very own free quart of strawberries. That&#039;s an extra &quot;sweet&quot; bonus if you ask me :)<br /><br /><br />Now for the tricky part, transportation. The farm is kinda out there in Water Mill, NY on Long Island. It does take about 2 hours to get to, but that&#039;s nothing a few sing-a-longs and snacks can&#039;t fix. I will be heading out there for the 10:30am trip and have 2 seats available (<em>plus a tiny 3rd row seat for a little one or two</em>). If you&#039;ve got a car and it&#039;s just taking up space out in a spot and you want to spend a nice morning out at the farm, volunteer your ride - there are no random strangers, just us veggie lovers! If you&#039;re not a morning person, head out for the afternoon trip. Get out of the city and meet Farmer Bill and see where all our weekly bounty comes from. It&#039;s sure to be a hit.<br /><br />If the car thing doesn&#039;t work out for you or if you&#039;re just a train buff and you want to get out there via LIRR, check the Long Island Railrood website for your best most direct route. Looks like you may need to cab it the rest of the way to the farm from the station, though not too bad if there are 4 of you in tow. Be warned though, the trips are very limited! There are 2 times heading out there: 9:50 am arriving about 10:16am and 11:50 am arriving around 12:16pm. Then the return trip- you&#039;re pretty much stuck with leaving at 4:20pm and arriving back in Woodside at 6:18pm. Slim pickins indeed so let&#039;s try to get those rideshares going!<br /><br />http://maps.google.com/maps?um=1&amp;q=train+station&amp;near=Water+Mill,+NY&amp;fb=1&amp;latlng=40893760,-72391530,17478660889644166664<br /><br /><br />If you&#039;re already planning on heading out and have your ride full and good to go, let us know that too so we can get an idea of how many peeps are showing up for which time slot. If you are interested in going and don&#039;t have a ride yet, send over a note and we&#039;ll get the plans in motion to get you in on the action.<br /><br />If you have any questions or concerns- send over a pm or reply to the blog post at http://www.hellgatecsa.com/blog/ and i&#039;ll see if i can&#039;t get them answered asap.<br /><br />Thanks much my fellow CSA&#039;ers :)<br /><br />

				Thank you, gud stuf!&nbsp; The pictures are wonderful.&nbsp; It&#039;s very relaxing to have this virtual tour, even if <em>you</em> had to do all the walking.&nbsp; The color of the fruits and vegetables is so intense, they look delicious.&nbsp; I loved the picture of the chickens &amp; rooster, and I was surprised to see the peacocks.&nbsp; Will the pictures stay at that web location?&nbsp; I saved it my favorites so I can take the mini virtual vacation again.
