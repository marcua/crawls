				<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font">Good evening, fellow Astorians!<br />My bf and I are moving to Astoria this July/August, and we are actively looking for an apartment. We&#039;ve been to a bunch of real estate agencies, they showed us garbage so far. I am on Craigslist 24/7, but not seeing much there. <br />Does anyone know what would be the best way to find an apartment? Any recommendations on Real Estate Agencies? Maybe you know anyone who is moving?<br /><br />We are looking for a 2 bedroom, 1 large (for a king set) and 1 small (office). Pref open kitchen layout with the living room. Would be great to have an outdoor space (balcony/terrace/back yard). Budget is withing $1800.<br /><br />Thanks for your help in advance!&nbsp; :cheesy:</span></span>

				This is still too early to look for a July/August move. Start looking in a couple weeks for a July 1 move-in, later if you&#039;re thinking more along the lines of mid-July or August.

				i disagree.&nbsp; one month out is not too early.&nbsp; I would begin the hard press right now if i was looking.&nbsp; <br /><br />To the OP...you are more likely to find the setup you describe in a house.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />My place is exactly as you describe (with a large balcony&nbsp; :grin: ) and I am in a 2 family house off of 23rd avenue.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have seen a couple of &quot;for rent&quot;signs in some windows the past few weeks.&nbsp; You might want to canvas the area(s) that you are interested in and see if you get lucky.&nbsp; You never know...I once asked my barber if he knew of any places and he brought me to a place that was available after he cut my hair.&nbsp; It was a great deal too.&nbsp; I thought it was funny b/c he was more helpful than any broker and he wasn&#039;t trying to make money off of me.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
