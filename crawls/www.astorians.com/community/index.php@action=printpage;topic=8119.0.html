				http://www.spinner.com/2007/08/06/best-opening-lyrics<br /><br /><br />This was on yahoo...thought it was a cute idea...what do you consider (let&#039;s keep the list reasonable, which I know if tough with this group) the best opening lyric(line) of a song? I&#039;m sure it gets really specific depending on your taste, but there are a couple opening lines I love even if the song has become tired. For me, its when the first line just gets you so excited to hear the song you can&#039;t stand it:<br /><br />&quot;I was dreamin when I wrote this...&quot; prince - 1999<br />&quot;so messed up...i want you here&#039; - iggy pop - wanna be your dog<br />&quot;I wish I was a fisherman...&quot; waterboys - fisherman&#039;s blues<br />&quot;when i&#039;m a walking I strut my stuff...&quot; violent femmes<br />&quot;oh show me the way to the next whiskey bar&quot; - the doors<br />&quot;if you want me to stay i&#039;ll be around the way&quot; - sly and the family stone<br />&quot;imagine me and you. I do.&quot; - The turtles or something? Happy together<br />&quot;oh what a night&quot; - feel a little silly that I don&#039;t know this<br /><br />

				I don&#039;t know if this counts since its a TV theme but hows aboot...<br /><br />In 1972 a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn&#039;t commit. These men <em>promptly escaped </em> from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire: THE A-TEAM&nbsp; (cue gunshots and explosion)
