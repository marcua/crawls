				Has anyone taken those Olay Vitamins specifically for a youthful appearance?&nbsp; My derm doc wants to put me on Accutane and I hear it does crap to your hair (my hair is uber healthy -- I don&#39;t color treat it, just straighten it).&nbsp; Do those vitamins work?

				Ah, the things we do for the sake of beauty!&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br />Is Accutane really necessary? What about options, like the Pill (a bit drastic if you don&#39;t need it!) or Retin-A (or another topical?) <br /><br />I&#39;d forget about Olay vitamins, sounds like just another marketing scam.

				First of all, from your photo, I can&#39;t imagine that you&#39;d need accutane. But anyway, I&#39;ve been to many dermatologists over the years, none of them ever seemed to want to put anyone on accutane. There are just so many bad side effects, the most notable of which will come into play if you want to have kids someday. <br /><br />A friend of mine used to have really horrible cystic acne (worse than mine by far) and her derm seemed to be able to knock it out quite well with antibiotics. It&#39;s not great being on antibiotics all the time, but this is probably a &#39;lesser of two evils&#39; situation. I&#39;m not sure how attached you are to your doc, but you might try a second opinion.. I like my current derm very much, if you&#39;d like a referral.

				My mother was on accutane and it is REALLY hardcore...plus if you get pregnant, serious, serious birth defects...so my question was always &#39;if it would do that, how good could it be fore your body&#39;...but it did clear her skin, not permanantly though.<br />

				I saw an ad for a book the other day - diet for clear skin or something like that. I looked over the summary and it seems like the diet for clear skin is a well-balanced, good diet, period. You know fish and leafy greens and such. Too bad that&#39;s not MY diet.&nbsp; :-P<br /><br />As for my doc, his name is John Romano and he&#39;s part of a dermatology practice in the west village. I think it&#39;s called West Village Dermatology or somesuch. I had been seeing a derm that my primary care doctor had referred me to but wasn&#39;t particularly keen on. Some derms I feel like treat acne dismissively. And granted, it is a minor health problem in the grander scheme of things. But if I&#39;m in their office, it&#39;s because it was bothering me enough to make an appointment, and I really want them to focus on it and not just throw perscription slips at me. <br /><br />I found Dr. Romano by cross-referencing highly rated derms with my insurance plan. He was IT. It took a while to get in to see him, but luckily I like him so far. The way he looks at it, and the way I look at it, there are a LOT of options out there to try before one gets to accutane. Including that &quot;Diet for Clear Skin&quot; book. Even I would try revamping my diet (and that means a lot considering how much I love food!) before I would let a doctor put me on accutane.

				vitamins for hair skin and nails:<br /><br />biotin (a form of B vitamins)<br /><br />MSM<br /><br />Vitamin E<br /><br />Garlic<br /><br />Gelatin (or you can eat jello, or get a box of unflavored gelatin and dissolve it in hot water and drink it like that, i like to mix it in tea so i dont taste the weird, but of course, this is not vegan)<br /><br />i actually find that the vitamins for &#39;hair skin and nails&#39; that you get at the store like that are usually a mixture of a bunch of vitamins, in other words, a multivitamin. the generic pre natal vitamins are great (tho they have a lot of iron) ... go to drug store like CVS or Eckerd, in the vitamin section, usually have one that says for hair skin and nails... look at the vitamins in it....<br /><br />my mom got me hooked on this place:<br /><br />http://www.puritan.com/<br /><br />good sales. i get my stuff pretty quickly. <br /><br />use henna in your hair. it&#39;s an ancient form of protecting and conditioning your hair. it&#39;s messy and time consuming, but ooohhhh, so worth it. it&#39;s kept my hair virtually split end free with out trimming for a whole year! (plus, i might say my hair is gorgeous) look here for techniques :<br /><br />http://www.hennaforhair.com/<br /><br />if anyone wants to chat about henna, pm me...i could go on for hours. and since we live in astoria, we can purchase henna in some shops around here...

				Henna is da bomb. One of nature&#39;s miracles. So cheap, so natural, so effective, so durn <em>messy</em> but worth it!&nbsp; :mrgreen: I like Colora Henna and use a plastic bag in the sink to mix it up (easier clean-up/minimal staining of the sink.) Besides, nothing else works on dark hair.<br /><br />I went to a natural skin-care person in the city a couple of years ago, and she basically told me to give up sugar and buy a bunch of products. I lasted maybe three weeks w/o much sugar and that was that. <br /><br />My acne isn&#39;t the worst but it&#39;s stubborn at times (mostly hormonal), sometimes all seems to form in one spot like right now&nbsp; :roll: I have samples of Duac and Differin- one I&#39;ve got insurance I&#39;d like to get a full prescription, samples work very nicely.

				Neutral henna works for blondes&nbsp; I did it once and liked the messy experience, and what it did for my hair.&nbsp; Most of the hennas will turn blonde hair odd colors (unless, that&#39;s what you want!)<br /><br />Giving up sugar is an excellent way to help your skin.

				yes, the amla and the cassia are used for conditioning purposes. just like the henna. but they do not have any pigments that would dye your hair.
