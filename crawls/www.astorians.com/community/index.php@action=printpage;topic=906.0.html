				It's bad enough to have an earthquake of that magnitude in someplace like SF, where there are earthquake building codes and comprehensive retrofitting, but to have something like that happen in Pakistan as it did, is amazingly devastating. &nbsp;I didn't realize there was an earthquake there until this evening. <br />18,000 dead. &nbsp; Horrifying destruction.<br /><br />Article (http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2005/10/08/international/i194317D00.DTL)<br />Map (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/recenteqsww/Quakes/usdyae.htm)

				Well, I am a Christian, and I know it's tempting to think so, but our Lord said that it is not for us to know times and seasons which the Father has fixed by his own authority (Acts 1:7). &nbsp;St. Augustine rightly noted in The City of God that that ought to lay to rest all speculations about the time of Christ's return. &nbsp;(Yes, even in the 5th century there were those who said the end was near, perhaps because of what was happening to the Roman Empire.)

				You are so right ladywithpans. Forgive my presumption. I admire St. Augustine for his compassion and tolerance, his <em>humanity</em>, and only wished that more Christians could look to people like him and Mother Teresa even Christos as role models to emulate rather than presuming knowledge that is only the domain of God, or assuming that they know who is &quot;saved&quot; and who is not. I myself have alot to learn about patience and understanding.<br /><br />I don't think I ever thanked you for standing up in your church and calling the pastor out on her views of what &quot;cowardly&quot; was. That takes alot of courage ladywithpans, and I commend you.<br /><br />Being Agnostic won't prevent me from sending a prayer for the fallen. May they know a peace that cannot be found on earth.<br /><br />-zeno

				Well, if you're agnostic you can pray To Whom It May Concern &nbsp;:) <br /><br />As for the pastor who used the word &quot;cowardly,&quot; I know her; she can take it. &nbsp;Her reply was misguided but gracious. &nbsp;BTW she's not my pastor; she's the pastor of the church I belonged to when I lived in the city.<br /><br />As for the earthquake, the death toll is now estimated to be between 20,000 and 30,000 &nbsp;:(

				Oh God.<br /><br />It seems whenever natural disasters strike that part of the world (South Asia with events like earthquakes, floods, etc, the death toll is often quite enormous.<br /><br />One of the hardest hit areas was Kashmir. Maybe some sort of outpouring of goodwill will go a long way toward reconciling the people and their governments. There was some hope in Sri Lanka following the Boxing Day tsunami, but it didn't come to fruition.<br /><br />And if a certain Saudi billionaire and his cronies hiding in the hills are among the dead, well, there is some justice in the world.
