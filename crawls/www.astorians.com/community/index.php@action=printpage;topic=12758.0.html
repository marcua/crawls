				In past elections I&#039;ve voted for a 3rd party candidate.&nbsp; I voted Nader, for example, though in NY or maybe I was in CA at the time, either way, it didn&#039;t much matter (cause they are strongly Dem). It is important to remember that, while voting for the lesser of 2 evils might suck, lesser has Supreme Court nomination power and that is very important.&nbsp; So for Swing Staters to vote 3rd party is dangerous, very dangerous.&nbsp; In NY, hell vote for whatever independent you want.&nbsp; Write in Pineapple!

				Had a great time at the Beer Garden last night!&nbsp; Great crowd there, and was happy to experience the drama of the night with fellow Astorians.&nbsp; daisy, gfb, Debbie, TRX and myself were all there last night together and had fun watching history happen.&nbsp; The BG still had Halloween decorations up!&nbsp; Loved it.&nbsp; :)

				Thankfully it wasn&#039;t jam-packed but it was nicely filled.&nbsp; The outdoor area was empty, but there was a good number of people in the indoor areas and it seemed just about everyone was interested in the election.&nbsp; It felt like being a part of history; I&#039;m glad I violated my tradition (since &#039;76) of watching the returns at home by myself.<br /><br />megc, TRX, daisy and Debbie are always good company.&nbsp; Anyone else there from the board who we didn&#039;t know about?
