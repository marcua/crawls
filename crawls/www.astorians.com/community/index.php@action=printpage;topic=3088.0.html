If the carrier is providing services in the state of NY (obviously) they *must* comply with a personal physician&#39;s request for additional prescribing amounts than the formulary currently provides, as long as it is withon the FDA approved amounts. Once daily is the approved amount for Zyrtec. BTDT. Zyrtec is one of those very expensive pharmaceuticals (because it *is* so effective) that insurance carriers like to put limits on. If your doctor doesn&#39;t want to engage the carrier because it might take up too much of their time, perhaps you might look into finding another doctor who will. I have become a wealth of information about how *that* system works. Make it work for you.<br />
