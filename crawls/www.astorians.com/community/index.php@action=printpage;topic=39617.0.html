				It&#039;s okay. It&#039;s historically aligned to one of the labor unions. It&#039;s very blue collar but safe enough. 10 minute walk to the 7 train.

				Thanks for response, angela1969 / Eamonn.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I have been informed for the possibility of a one-bedroom w/balcony.&nbsp; Will be checking it out.

				Woodside has changed considerably over the past 30 years. From mainly Irish American, to a massive influx of Irish from Ireland, to a rapid multicultural mix, to what could be a hipster haven. A lot of old timers lament the changes. I agree certain things have changed for the worse but I am optimistic. For examples of bad trends, the areas around Roosevelt to Queens Blvd east of 65th Pl have goten quite rundown. I think it will turnaround soon.

				Greetings of 2017 to All ~<br /><br /><br />So I went to view the offer .. now, decision has to be made quickly.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Pro&#039;s?&nbsp; the monthly would be half of rent what I pay now and includes everything; it is affordable for to purchase the aprtment.&nbsp; Besides the #7 the Q60 is close by as well the M/R, however that&#039;s a 15 minute walk.<br /><br /><br />Con?&nbsp; LR/BdRm smaller than what i have now and would have to make adjustments.&nbsp; I would also leave Astoria with a heavy-heart.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;:embarrassed:&nbsp; what to do what to do.&nbsp; Enlighten me ~&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;C&#039;iao for now ~

				This is obviously a very personal decision but if you really like Astoria, I would not consider this move. That part of Woodside is just far enough from the fun stuff of Astoria that it might as well be 10 miles away. The immediate area just doesn&#039;t offer a lot for walking around, browsing stores, etc. Savings won&#039;t seem that important once you realize you are spending so much more time at home because things are not convenient. I would stay put.

				I would seriously consider how secure you are with your current living situation. Unless you are rent-stabilized, you could lose your place because the owner gets greedy, sells to someone else, etc.

				60decibels ~ thanks.&nbsp; Not rent stabilized but I&#039;ve been there a long time and the thought of the owner selling has crossed my mind.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I find it ridiculous when I found out what the tenants upstairs were paying, OMG!

				Boxes - I can recommend Duck brand boxes.&nbsp; A few years ago my brother shipped some stuff to me from California in Duck brand boxes, stuff I wanted but had no immediate need for so I didn&#039;t open them till recently.&nbsp; Each box was heavy.&nbsp; In addition to being shipped here the boxes have been stacked, re-stacked, placed on their sides, shoved around, kicked, and they&#039;ve kept their shape and are so strong I didn&#039;t even attempt to take them apart for recycling.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />https://www.duckbrand.com/<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Greetings to those interested ~<br /><br /><br />I have been all moved and settled for a few months now&nbsp; :smiley:&nbsp; I am quite happy with my place although I am almost adjusted going from the first floor, 3 family home (with backyard and facing), to a building complex with much more tenants.&nbsp; I do have a terrace which is nice.&nbsp; Having not to leave the bldg to do laundry is great.<br /><br /><br />I miss taking the &quot;N/W&quot; train and having a seat all the time in the mornings.&nbsp; Now it&#039;s the &quot;7&quot; - no seat and crowded.&nbsp; There is several bus lines along my new neighbor for the just in case, so that&#039;s not a problem (i.e., Q60,Q32,Q18,Q72 to name a few).&nbsp; While I do switch at QBP for the N/W, I occasionally do get a seat there due to the closures along that line (for now). <br /><br /><br />Having A/C at my disposal this past summer was wonderful.&nbsp; More windows/more light&nbsp; :cool:&nbsp; .. very happy with that.&nbsp; Now to see how the cold-weathered months work out.<br /><br /><br />I still visit the Ditmars area.&nbsp; The ambiance/stores/restaurants, etc., different too.&nbsp; Still adjusting to all that too and getting acquainted.&nbsp; It&#039;s all good ....<br /><br /><br />C&#039;iao for now ~

				Congratulations on the move, Simplymei, I&#039;m glad it worked out well.&nbsp; I reread the thread - it sounds like you made a well reasoned, well researched decision.<br /><br /><br />I guess if you figured out how to get around in wet weather it was a preview of how things will be in cold weather.

				How many years did it take you to get called for an apartment?&nbsp; Do you hear much noise from the apartments around you or above you?<br />If the 7 train is too crowded you might want to consider the LIRR if you can walk from Penn Station to your job.&nbsp; With the&nbsp; increasing rental prices in Queens you probably made a good decision and you can always UBER to Astoria several times a month.<br />

				<br /><br /><br />I read through this whole thread.<br /><br /><br />So what exactly are the Big Six Towers, and why does it seem so many know about them?&nbsp; And... I couldn&#039;t really gauge from what was said here re: long lists etc. .... are these like Mitchell-Lama or something buildings...where bldgs are nice enough and rents cheap enough, that once people get an apt they don&#039;t want to leave?&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />And did I also read something in the thread that implied you can rent with option to later purchase the apt (as like a co-op/condo)?<br /><br /><br />Thanks.

				Greetings yippee ~&nbsp; in reply, the Towers are Mitchell-Lama (moderate-middle income).&nbsp; The waiting list takes a long time to open up depending on the size of apartment you sign up for.<br /><br /><br />Once you&#039;re moved in, I doubt if anyone moves out.&nbsp; Building/complex is kept clean. If you own a car you sign up and placed on wait list for that.&nbsp; I understand the monthly fee is very reasonable as well.<br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t know about renting with options to buy.<br /><br /><br />We are shareholders and pay maintenance, not rent.&nbsp; It is definitely much more reasonable and affordable.&nbsp; :tongue: There are rules but that is expected and, do have Board meetings for everyone to attend. Not sure how often.. remember, I&#039;m the new person!<br /><br /><br />C&#039;iao for now ~
