			oh yeah, I&#39;m all about the plastic-bag reuse! I try to keep one in my purse and use what we have stored at home for the small wastebaskets. When I go for a lot of grocery shopping, I bring the &quot;granny bag&quot; (you know, the plastic thing that fits in the granny cart.) I&#39;m amazed how much you can cram in there!! It&#39;s like a clown car, honestly. <br /><br />Don&#39;t forget to get a sturdy, cheap bike for around town and even commuting&nbsp; :wink:<br /><br />Other than that, I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not very &quot;green&quot; at all. Getting any kind of food delivered or take-out, especially Chinese food for some reason- it&#39;s an enormous amount of garbage. Ditto my coffee everyday- the thought of keeping a mug at work skeeves me out (hard to wash properly in a public bathroom facility.)<br /><br />Organic food is expensive, so I have to pick and choose which ones to go with. But I rarely eat meat so that helps cut back on the pollution and waste of slaughterhouses.<br /><br />It&#39;s not easy being green&nbsp; :roll:

			Bah - I beg to differ. To start with - by living in NYC one is already MUCH more efficient than the average suburbanite. If you don&#39;t drive everywhere, you&#39;re also already winning. If you dont&#39; drive at all, or use a car, except for the occasional taxi, so much the better. Some other basic things you can do:<br /><br />- Buy compact flourescent lighbulbs for your lights. This is simple, will save you money, and cut down your energy useage HUGELY. Importantly, as a chick living on her own, for me this also means changing lightbulbs NEVER as these things last for 9 YEARS! Seriously. Home Depot had 6 for something like &lt;$10 when I got mine in September - I did the whole apartment for less than $30, and its awesome!! <br /><br />- Try to cut down on plastic bag usage, as you mention. Use a backpack, get things delivered in boxes, refuse bags when you can. Reuse as much as possible, recycle in normal recycling - so far they&#39;ve taken mine just fine. <br /><br />- Buy locally produced food. Home delivered grocery shopping cuts down on greenhouse emissions hugely, when compared to everyone driving individually to the supermarket. However, buying locally produced food, providing one buys in season, also reduces the amount of greenouse gases used to produce said food. This requires some smart thinking - it has been shown that buying locally grown rice in California, for example, costs more in terms of greenhouse emissions than buying Bangladeshi grown rice in California would. Rember too that water is a precious resource. In a nutshell, eat seasonally and locally - this is why a CSA is such a good idea, provided the farmer isn&#39;t running greenhouses that are heated etc. Essentially, if you&#39;re eating a ripe tomato in New York in winter, you&#39;re doing the wrong thing, in this world view. Can your fruit, eat peaches and mangos that are preserved (in winter), use the old fashioned ways to get around the cold - forget expensive importing. <br /><br />- Use public transportation<br /><br />- If you own, move towards green roofs and solar heating<br /><br />- Even if you don&#39;t own, pressure your landlord for green roofs, and change your electricity supplier to ConEd Solutions, who do supply green energy (wind mostly) to NYC homes. <br /><br />- Do not buy factory farmed meat. Avoid non-organic produce of any kind where possible. All these types of agriculture are harmful to the environment and require socio-economic practices that are also questionable. Never eat non-free range eggs, chickens or pork. Always aim for grass- fed beef.<br /><br />I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll think of more. But those are simple things I&#39;m doing that I think are easy to incorporate into everyone&#39;s lives. Sure, there are days/months one cant&#39; afford organic everything, but whatever effort you do make, makes at least that little bit of difference. Something is always better than nothing!

			Also buy for the longterm.<br /><br />This is lesson I&#39;m working on learning as short term solutions are so appealing -- but when you are buying &quot;disposable consumer goods&quot; (my words) like electronics, clothes, housewears -- buy quality items that will last multiple seasons/years.&nbsp; Buying good quality increases the life of the product and means less waste.<br /><br />And if you buy it -- use it.&nbsp; Eat your veggies rather than letting them rot in the fridge (I know I&#39;m guilty).<br /><br />*Know* where it comes from.&nbsp; Clothes, consumer goods, food.&nbsp; Think about the materials, the craftsmanship, the pesticides and make an educated buying decision.<br /><br />Compost!&nbsp; I don&#39;t yet know how indoors but it&#39;s on my project list.<br /><br />Turn things off.&nbsp; Lights, fans, cable boxes.&nbsp; Find &quot;wall warts&quot; (chargers plugged into the wall drawing power after item is charged) and unplug them.<br /><br />Eat at home.&nbsp; Or if you&#39;re not eating at home, reject the wrappings.&nbsp; NYC loves the packaging.&nbsp; A coffee (or a bagel) with a wad of napkins in a paper bag every morning is a little excessive.&nbsp; Just say &quot;no bag please&quot;.<br /><br />Wash and properly sort your recycling.<br /><br />
