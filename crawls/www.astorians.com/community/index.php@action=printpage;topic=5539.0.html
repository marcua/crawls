				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hitherto, tap water had always been free.&nbsp; Well think again...on March 22, a glass of tap water will cost $1 in some of New Yorkâ€™s finest restaurants including Le Bernardin and Asia de Cuba as well as in small eateries, such as the little Vesuvio bakery in SoHo. Ridiculous? Who would ever charge for tap water?<br /><br />Before you take offense to this extra charge, know that this is all for a good cause. This is a UNICEF project aimed at saving lives by providing safe drinking water to children around the world. UNICEF say that with $1, they can provide 40 litres of safe drinking water, which is enough to give one child safe drinking water for 40 days, or forty children safe drinking water for one day. With $1, they can provide 100 water purification tablets to provide clean water for children in crisis situations.<br /><br />UNICEF also provide interesting statistics about New York tap water of which you m may not have been aware and which make you wonder why we were paying exorbitant amounts for mineral water in the first place: tap water (which, in the case of New York, comes from pristine upstate reservoirs, the largest unfiltered supply in the world) is more stringently monitored and more tightly regulated than bottled water; apparently New York City tap water was tested 430,600 times during 2004 alone.&nbsp; So order that tap water in good conscience on March the 22nd: it is perfectly safe and it is for charity!</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />SOURCE (http://www.developmentcrossing.com/development_crossing/2007/03/1_for_tap_water.html)

				Yeah its the SOURCE link.<br /><br />Some of those comments are just horrible.&nbsp; Not just that they obviously didn&#039;t read the whole thing to see that its a suggested donation, but that so many people would think its an &quot;imposition&quot; to fork over a dollar donation.&nbsp; And this is at mainly nice restaurants, where a dollar isnt going to buy you anything anyways.<br /><br />My first personal favorite argument against the donation is the guy who lays out your whole day; you make your reservations weeks in advance, you get ready, you go to the restaurant, wait at the bar, ready for a good meal, OMFG THEY WANT A DOLLAR FOR A DONATION MY ENTIRE NIGHT IS RUINED!!!!<br /><br />My second favorite is the person who said it was against the law to not give someone free tap water &quot;what if they were dying of thirst?&quot;&nbsp; Because if I was dying of thirst in the middle of Manhattan the first place I would go is Blue Water Grill.
