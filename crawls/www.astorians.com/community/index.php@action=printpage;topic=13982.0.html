				Happy Friday Astorians&nbsp; 8-)<br /><br />I&#039;ve looked through these boards and little bit and found some helpful links, but I was wondering if there is an informal community theater group in the area that puts on traditional musicals?&nbsp; I was involved in a great all-ages group where I last lived and it was the time of my life.&nbsp; I&#039;ve worked both on and off the stage and enjoy helping with productions in all capacities.&nbsp; So... any suggestions?&nbsp; Or, and I know this is a real longshot, but would anyone want to work with me to set something like this up?&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Thanks!&nbsp; The website is a little confusing, but I&#039;m not sure that&#039;s exactly what I mean.&nbsp; I&#039;m talking about more traditional shows, less experimental.&nbsp; I&#039;ll check it out though&nbsp; :-)

				I think it&#039;s called the Astoria Performing Arts Complex.... I know they&#039;ve done some traditional musicals.<br /><br />Choc Factory is <em>very </em>experimental.

				I&#039;ve been looking for the very same thing.&nbsp; You can find listings of community theaters that hold auditions at http://www.communitytheaterny.com/ but so far I&#039;ve found that the places that are auditioning for traditional musicals are a little far away.&nbsp; I&#039;d definitely be interested in participating in something if you want to put a musical together around these parts.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, Astoria Performing Arts Center does do musicals - they just staged Ragtime a month ago - but (and please correct me if I&#039;m wrong, anyone) I feel that they are geared to more professional performers. I&#039;ll still audition next time they have a musical - I think they do one or two per year.<br /><br />Let me know if you find anything else!

				I&#039;m no Equity card holder, but I&#039;m always happy to sing (in a chorus, preferably in the back -- or even better, from the wings), run lines, hang and focus lights and change the gels, maybe even wield a hammer, a paintbrush, or a sewing needle.&nbsp;

				Looks like you can do it all!&nbsp; Well, let&#039;s see if anyone else here is interested, and if so, maybe a few of us could set up a time to meet.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ll just throw out there that APAC is a professional company, employing both Equity and non-Union actors.
