			Feel free to re-post your intro from the last OUT Astoria board!<br /><br />I may as well start...again&nbsp; :lol:<br /><br />I&#39;m Joe. I&#39;ve lived in Astoria for over 5 years now.<br /><br />Graduated from Marymount Manhattan College with a degree in Theatre. I&#39;m an actor/producer/writer...but to pay the bills I do freelance web and graphic design and I also work as an Executive Assistant at a non-profit for autism.<br /><br />I produced a TV pilot last year (www.morgoldproductions.com) and you can view my resume/portfolio at www.joemoran.info

			Ok. I&#39;ll&nbsp; bite as I&nbsp; don&#39;t think I&nbsp; ever posted an intro to myself at the old OUT Astoria site.<br /><br />I moved to Astoria from Kyoto in August with my partner, who will be returning to the U.S. at the end of November. I&#39;m still getting used to the neighborhood (and the rest of New York), but am thrilled that the Family Market is on Broadway and am loving the local restaurants. <br /><br />I&#39;m originally from California (and am a very proud banana slug), but have lived in Ithaca; Bloomington, Indiana; and Japan for lengthy periods as well.

			&nbsp;Hi Yuzu, woo hoo to being a UCSC grad. Which college? Feel free to post and say hi on the regular Hello thread (top thread under local chat) as well&nbsp; (sorry Joe but not everyday I see a fellow banana slug on astorians, out or otherwise....)

			I think I posted this back at the old OutAstoria site, but I could be wrong.<br /><br />I&#39;m Dirk, a 13 year resident of Astoria (over 15 in NYC now) and am a transplant from the South.&nbsp; I live at 34th and Broadway with two wonderful, but difficult cats.&nbsp; My interests include local politics (I&#39;m the President of the Stonewall Democratic Club of NYC, the citywide LGBT Democratic organization - sdnyc.org), science fiction and fantasy books, cooking, indie music and my boyfriend has recently gotten me addicted to Project Runway.&nbsp; I&#39;m pretty active locally as a Board Member of the Powhatan Regular Democratic Club, a member of Trinity Lutheran Church (up on 31st Avenue at 37th Street) and in Astoria Kiwanis.

			Mirki2, I started out at Oakes and then jumped ship to Kresge, you? So nice to find another banana slug! When were you there? I graduated in 94.
