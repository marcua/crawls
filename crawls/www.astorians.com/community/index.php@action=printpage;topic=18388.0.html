				I can explain everything.&nbsp; These are feral helicopters you’ve been seeing around the area, particularly at night.&nbsp; Yes, feral – they’ve broken away from their various TV/Radio affialiates and police/transportation groups to live “ in the wild” blue yonder.&nbsp; A lot of people don’t know this, but helicopters are nocturnal beings who tend to be more active at night.<br /><br />Why are they so active around Astoria lately?&nbsp; There’s an old Greek lady living on 30th Road who has been quietly feeding them barrels of oil every other night.&nbsp; I’ve seen her, with her nephew, wheeling out the barrels on a hand-lift truck.&nbsp; The old lady makes a strange whispering, purring sound.&nbsp; She also has a portable electric can opener which she turns off-and-on.&nbsp; The sound of this apparently attracts the feral helicopters.&nbsp; They’ll hover over her backyard, lower a rope harness, which the nephew will attach to the oil barrel, then they’ll fly away a few minutes later.<br /><br />She has names for each feral helicopter: Felix, Duchess, Leo, Circes and Vallone.&nbsp; Sure, the neighbors complain about the lights and noise, but if it wasn’t for her, these helicopters might possibly perish on their own, or at least find their existence much more hard-scrabble than it already must be.&nbsp; So, forgive an old woman her compassion in a world that’s running short on this valuable commodity.&nbsp; The noise and lights fade, but hopefully her good intentions will remain, even after she’s gone.<br />

				Helicopter traffic from Manhattan to LGA (and back).&#160; It peaks on summer weekends late on Fridays and late on Sundays -- people who can afford it take helicopters to LGA from any of the Manhattan heliports (or transfer from other local airports) for their weekend flights so they don&#039;t have to deal with the traffic.

What you are describing doesn&#039;t last very long. But when there is a helicopter circling around overhead near where you live at 3:00am you will most definitely be awakened.<br /><br />Most of the time it&#039;s a NYPD aviation unit if you see just 1 copter and you see it circling around, if you see more then 1 it is most likely news copters.

				A few minutes after 10pm, we got stuck in a motorcade roadblock on Astoria Blvd near the airport. Thought we were in the clear, after seeing other parts of the road closed off, but a police motorcycle came zipping up to the light, blocking our side. Soon after, a bunch of unmarked SUVs and other vehicles came rolling through, with blinking lights etc. on their way to the airport.<br /><br />Maybe the helicopters had something to do with this? Not even sure who was in town.
