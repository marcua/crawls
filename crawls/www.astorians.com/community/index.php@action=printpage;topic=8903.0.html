				I&#039;ve lived here since &#039;99 and, as much as I love chinese food, I have gotten so tired of the typical takeout/delivery places.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-(<br /><br />If we feel like travelling a little we head to Flushing for real Chinese food.&nbsp; But, barring that, is there anything good in our Nabe? <br /><br />I have heard about Jardin de China, on Broadway.&nbsp; Is this place worth a try?&nbsp; &nbsp;:|<br /><br />Thanks, all.

				Mr. Oliver,<br /><br />The board has dedicated many posts to your very questions:<br /><br />http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=7440.0<br /><br />http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=124.0<br /><br />http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=7332.0<br /><br />http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=4804.0<br /><br />http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=2696.0<br /><br />Personally, I like Jardin, but it probably has more to do with my love of Latin food than Chinese food.&nbsp; It&#039;s an interesting mix.&nbsp; <br /><br />By the way, does anyone remember the Spanish/Chinese restaurant that used to be on the corner of 31st Street and 36th Avenue, where the Bank of America is now.&nbsp; That place was awesome!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				There&#039;s a great buffet way up on Northern Blvd, I forget the name, but last time I ate there the food was really fresh and they have a great selection of mostly Chinese food! I think it&#039;s Korean owned. All you can eat!!! Go before dinner time when the prices are lower. Yummy pig-out palace!

				No No No!!! Not that dump(ster)!!! I ate there once-it was dis-gust-ing!! This place is called Harvest Buffet. It&#039;s up near Great Neck. It&#039;s a bit of a drive, but worth it. Also try East Buffet on Main Street. They have Peking Duck carved to order. But, I like Harvest a bit more.

				Whew, that&#039;s a relief!&nbsp; I was hoping that you didn&#039;t think that Grand Buffet was good Chinese food.&nbsp; <br /><br />A friend of mine who lives in Washington Heights goes there almost everytime he comes to visit me (I live a block away). He says that it&#039;s better Chinese food than the stuff he gets in his neighborhood.&nbsp; Having lived with mother and his grandmother and visited the area frequently since I moved out, I can tell you that Chinese food can get a whole lot worse than what we have in Astoria/LIC, if that&#039;s possible.

				Oh, I forgot to mention-Canton Gourmet is excellent, though it&#039;s not in Astoria. It&#039;s located in Flushing at 38-08, Prince Street near Main Street. Definitely worth the trip for their tasty seafood dishes. Their specialty is garlic chicken - whole roasted chicken smothered in garlic, and garlic crab, but they have a lot of other great dishes to choose from! Reasonably priced too. Small restaurant, usually crowded, but go on a week day or Saturday at an in-between time. Service is friendly too. The best Chinese food you will NOT find in Astoria. Anyways, it&#039;s nice to get away from Astoria sometimes! I like to go to China town or Flushing for Chinese food and to buy my fruits and veggies.

				I&#039;ve been pleased with Good One on 24th Ave. (across from Beer Garden.) Not that my orders are adventurous- I stick with vegetable lo mein or steamed veggies- but the service is very friendly and I have no complaints (well, except for the lack of brown rice, but I&#039;ll live!)&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				I am a Hot and Sour Soup junkie. If a restaurant-whether it&#039;s Take Out or Sit Down has lousy Hot and Sour Soup betcha the rest of the menu sucks!<br />I know this thread is about Astoria Chinese, but has anyone tried Tangra Asian Fusion in Sunnyside on Queens Blvd? Real good! Haven&#039;t eaten there in a while, but if you like Indian and Chinese that&#039;s the place for you, but be forewarned- the food is SPICY HOT.&nbsp; :evil:<br />You have to ask for mild-spicy-hot when ordering. <br />
