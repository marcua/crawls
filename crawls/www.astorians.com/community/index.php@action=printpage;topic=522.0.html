				The Rock is a good gym. &nbsp;Been going there for a while now. &nbsp;It's $78 a month &nbsp;but they have deals of $500 for 6 months or $850 for a year ($71/mo) if you pay in advance. (there is a signup fee at the moment... but they often have specials where there is no signup fee)<br /><br />You can get a free guest pass and try it out if you want.<br /><br />http://therockhealthandfitness.com/<br /><br />They have some coupons in the specials section. &nbsp;And it couldn't hurt to bargain.

				Thanks for the suggestions! &nbsp;I'm going to check out The Rock. &nbsp;I wish there was a Y nearby though - I'm so used to living in Brooklyn and spending $36 a month on a fantastic gym...

				There is a Y &nbsp;down on on 21st past broadway somewhere, but I don't think they have an indoor pool. I don't think there is anyplace in Astoria yet with an indoor pool.
