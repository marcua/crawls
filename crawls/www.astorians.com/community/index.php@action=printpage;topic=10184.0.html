				There are courts in the park on the east side of Steinway St between Ditmars and 23rd Ave, right here. (http://www.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=6536138071231024099,40.771673,-73.907025&amp;saddr=&amp;daddr=40.771673,-73.907003&amp;mra=dme&amp;mrcr=0&amp;mrsp=1&amp;sz=18&amp;jsv=107&amp;sll=40.771714,-73.907009&amp;sspn=0.002689,0.005225&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;ll=40.771714,-73.907009&amp;spn=0.005379,0.01045&amp;z=17)<br /><br />I have seen quite a few gentlemen playing there on numerous Saturdays, and I&#039;ll bet they know.<br />

				I love bocce but haven&#039;t felt brave enough to approach the gentlemen playing on Steinway.&nbsp; Besides, it&#039;s also right around the corner from me.&nbsp; It&#039;d be nice if there was a league to join during the summer or something.

				A couple of weeks ago, the gf and I got a week&#039;s supply of food on a roll (that is, one &quot;the bomb&quot; hero) from sandwich kings. We ate at a picnic table next to those courts.<br /><br />The folks there didn&#039;t seem to mind us watching. We exchanged friendly nods (presumably +). It seemed pretty delightfully social: they seem to spend ten minutes inspecting and grooming the surface of the court, two minutes bowling, and 10 minutes working out the score. It also looks like they probably have been doing the same thing for years. I&#039;d be too shy to ask to play with them too, but maybe they&#039;d know where and when the hipster/yuppie league gathers.

				yeah I&#039;m a little to intimidated to ask a bunch of old pros if I could join. Especially since I would suck. I bought some bocce balls from Target like a year ago and have yet to use them. Worse yet since I moved here I don&#039;t even know where they are. <br /><br />Maybe we should set up our own league. Who else is interested?

				I can&#039;t help with setting up a bocce league, but I just thought I&#039;d let you know that there is a Bocce court in Astoria Park, at the bottom of the pathway that runs in between the great lawn and the pool.

				I know, but it is better than nothing at all. And considering that it has sat like that for years, I&#039;m surprised that it isn&#039;t in worse condition.

				I live not far from that park, too, and I&#039;d be highly interested in giving it a try. Even if I stink at it, it looks like fun!
