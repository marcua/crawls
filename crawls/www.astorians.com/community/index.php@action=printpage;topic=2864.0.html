				Has anyone seen this? Quite vitriolic. As a Californian, I can understand about 40% of what she&#39;s saying... rageful and bigoted as it is. The frustration is palpable!

				I have no idea why someone so narrow-minded would even venture out of the gilded comfort of luxe San Francisco... much less to end up in Queens. <br /><br />But I felt that her frustrations, no matter how uninformed, may speak to the basest, deepest parts of my own personal resentment and disappointment at modern urban living. <br /><br />Having said that, I clearly think she&#39;s a whiny idiot with bigoted views... but it doesn&#39;t negate the fact that she too picked up on the sad reality that this borough suffers from apathy, filth and overpopulation.

				The picture didn&#39;t look like Astoria - it looked more like Elmhurst or Flushing maybe, hard to tell.<br />She doesn&#39;t sound happy and sounds like she has a lot of personal issues to work through. &nbsp;SF is a great place, but not any better than NYC, at least in my opinion. &nbsp;There are lots of gay people in Queens and lots of good vegetarian restaurants too. &nbsp;Why is she living in a city if urban environments get her down? &nbsp;The diversity and energy of Queens is what makes it the best borough!

				The Castro has kept it&#39;s cultural identity much better than the Village, or even Chelsea. &nbsp;The rents keep moving the LGBT center of NYC around in search of cheaper rents. &nbsp;I think in another decade, Chelsea will be predominately straight and the gay center in Manhattan will be up in Hell&#39;s Kitchen - we&#39;re seeing much larger LGBT populations in the other boroughs as well, Brooklyn and Queens most especially.

				I know, I know. And Chinatown is like a massive stinkbomb this time of year. And the 7 train was voted &quot;dirtiest train&quot; by the Straphangers. You&#39;re right, its really not just Queens. (Although when I lived in crappy Manhattan there were more santitation guys on the streets because the city has more of an interest in keeping say, Rock Center clean than it does Astoria) Bigots just see it that way because more of us non-white peeps live in Queens.

				If this is true, Broadway in Manhattan cannot be as dirty as Broadway in Astoria (or in Brooklyn):<br /><br /><em>DSNY Commissioner John Doherty told Council Members that the department’s budget plan for Fiscal Year 2004 called for $11 million in savings by reducing the frequency of weekly garbage collections in almost every community outside of Manhattan, where pick-ups will continue on a basis of three per week. With the exception of several districts in the Bronx and two in Brooklyn, every outer-borough sanitation district will experience collection reductions, either from three to two times or twice to once per week.</em><br /><br />Let&#39;s get real here. To even maintain a semi-mediocre level of cleanliness, we need trash pick up like 200 times a week. <br /><br />

				I actually noticed today that the trash cans on my corner (Steinway &amp; 21st Ave) disappeared too! There are two delis at this intersection, and during the week when school is in session, lots of kids from the high school hang out eating junk food while waiting for their bus, so it&#39;ll just get messier when September comes.<br /><br />I noticed because when I went downstairs, my front hall was littered with takeout menus and flyers for Sears - they seriously just open the door and throw them in, I HATE that. Anyway, I grabbed everything and as I was walking, I noticed I went almost half a mile before I came upon a trash can to toss them all in! Ugh.<br /><br />Anyway, I filled out a form for my corner. It said &quot;your request will be acted upon within 10 days,&quot; so we&#39;ll see!<br /><br />(related story: I actually bumped into a woman tossing flyers into hallways once, and when I opened the door, she tossed a handful of them at me. I wasn&#39;t looking up, so when they hit me in the face and fell to the floor, I was just a LITTLE shocked, to say the least. I said something like, &quot;Could you not throw these on the floor, I&#39;ve slipped on them, etc, you can leave them under the mailboxes if you want&quot; to which she responded, &quot;f*#k you, lady, I&#39;ll do whatever I want.&quot; Now, I know its her job to distribute this junk, and its probably a really, really crappy job, but it took all my willpower not to steal the big cart of them that she had left on the corner and hide it from her, or dump them all into the trash cans on Ditmars or something.)

				Garbage... this is my favorite complaint<br /><br />i think there should be an ad campaign that informs people how much the city spends on cleaning up garbage and how just saving a small % of that money could then be spent on other things like improving parks, more trees on streets, improving libraries/schools/playgrounds... whatever... <br />I just can&#39;t stand the attitude &quot;it&#39;s someone else&#39;s job to clean up after me.&quot;<br /><br />Next - garbage cans... the thing is ... they don&#39;t always help - in fact, sometimes they make the situation worse.&nbsp; My parents have a live across the street to the entrance of a state beach.&nbsp; There&#39;s a bus stop and a bench right be the entrance.&nbsp; &nbsp;A few years ago the town added a garbage can.&nbsp; Unfortunately that can didn&#39;t get emptied enough and soon that corner became a magnet for garbage.&nbsp; It didn&#39;t matter how full the can was, people would continue to dump their refuse.&nbsp; After a couple of seasons of complaints by the locals - either the town took away the can - or more likely a neighbor who was fed up with the garbage stole the can.&nbsp; Problem solved.&nbsp; People don&#39;t dump their garbage there any more.&nbsp; <br /><br />I wonder if the disappearing cans are due to a) pranks or b) people sick of the garbage that piles up and overflows from the cans.&nbsp; <br /><br />Another question - who thought it was a good idea to design a can that is made up of holes??? Those metal... I don&#39;t know how to describe it...&nbsp; &nbsp;you know... it&#39;s just like... chain link sort of... just holes... they don&#39;t put bags in them and then the small garbage goes in and then falls out.&nbsp; <br /><br />And... have the &quot;Big Bellies&quot; (I think that&#39;s the name), the solar powered compactors helped the situation?? I&#39;m sure most people don&#39;t even know what they are so they don&#39;t even use them.&nbsp; <br /><br />i think i&#39;m done<br />&nbsp;

And for some reason it seems the bulk of the ones in Astoria are like that. They&#39;re particularly bad for two reasons: 1) Like you said, small garbage just falls out. 2) Wind blows through the cans and anything light just gets blown out. This is a big reason why the streets and sidewalks end up covered with plastic bags, napkins, and newspapers. <br /><br />Did anyone end up saving the Craigslist rant? It got taken down before I could see it.

				I think the original CL posting was removed because the underlying sentiment of the person who posted was undeniably bigoted. It wasn&#39;t overtly offensive like racial slurs and inciting violence but the tone was that of a typical narrow-minded and frustrated person (probably female and white) and her alienation in moving from SF to NYC. She listed about two dozen things she hated about Queens, some of them clearly culturally-ignorant, some of them anecdotal, some of them perhaps universally true (the stench and filth of the city streets is now getting a sounding-off). Sorry the actual text is gone. Well, maybe not since the original poster might have been a bigoted freak. BUt at any rate, I thought it was a dialogue worth having because a lot of us Astorians are not from here (I would say like 90%) and sometimes the frustrations and anger with modern urban life can get to a boiling point. Thus the rant &amp; rave. When the 200th person runs smack into me at the Queensboro Plaza transfer without acknowledging my existence, I want to flip out. When I walk home from work and the same homeless dudes on Broadway are tossing trash at me to harass me, I want to flip out. When yet another oblivious mother rams her stroller into my shins on Steinway and doesn&#39;t bother to even utter an apology, I want to flip out. When neighborhood kids are breaking glass and fighting in front of the Dunkin Donuts, I want to flip out. When gay guys are attacked by euro thugs on my block, I want to flip out. I was just wondering if anyone else felt the same.

				Yeah, I understand that it was bigoted, but a lot of the posts are bigoted, racist, sexist, politically incorrect, what have you.&nbsp; I just find it funny how some things get by and others don&#39;t.&nbsp; Doesn&#39;t seem to have a logic to it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Actually, quite a good number of the posts are offensive.&nbsp; Guess I don&#39;t have the stomach to read thru all the junk to get to anything worthwhile reading.&nbsp; <br /><br />And I hear on the people bumping into you and not saying sorry.&nbsp; And the trashcan absence thing - although I wish more people would actually use them when they are around.
