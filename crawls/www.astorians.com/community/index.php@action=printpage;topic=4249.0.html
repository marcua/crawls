				OK, so after months and months of avoiding this book (on loan from a friend who probably is wondering how slow I read) because it&#39;s probably as depressing as &quot;Fast food nation&quot; and the like.&nbsp; I finally start in after my lovely nagging wife makes me. <br /><br />Let me sum up what I&#39;ve read so far in just a few words.&nbsp; Informative, depressing and painfull.&nbsp; <br /><br />You want to stop eating corn, meat and all forms of food products not picked from your own garden.&nbsp; You now hate all oil, oil products, oil companies, all oil rich nations, the US government and more.&nbsp; <br /><br />You are being lied to, fattened up, relieved of all your money, morales, ethics and health.&nbsp; Bio fuels is a rip off because it takes oil to make corn to make Bio fuels.&nbsp; Please don&#39;t even bother trying to convince me otherwise.&nbsp; The only difference between a cow or chicken or corn or a car is that you can actually eat the first three but you might as well step in front of the car because then at least you can see it coming to kill you.&nbsp; If a chicken was charging down the road at you doing 50mph then maybe you would get the idea or at least get a laugh before it killed you dead.<br /><br />To the person who loaned me the book, I&#39;m only a few chapters and depressed. I hope your next loaner is a Calvin and Hobbs cartoon book &#39;cause I&#39;m going to need it.

				It gets better, and I mean that in a good way. He hits you with a bunch of really amazing information to start with, but then talks about ways that other people are really doing it differently and going against the trend (CSA&#39;s being one of the cool things he talks about). Overall still depressing to look at the state of food in the U.S., but encouraging as he gets further into it too.

				Haha, well, keep going. The last few chapters are really enjoyable to read... We&#39;ll all be looking forward to your take on those!

				After seeing Fast Food Nation, I never want to eat red meat again.... and the movie never does get better.<br /><br />It&#39;s a good movie, informative, shocking, and majorly depressing.

				Red meat, or red meat from a factory farm?&nbsp; I saw FFN, too, and was quite disturbed with many of the images in the film.
