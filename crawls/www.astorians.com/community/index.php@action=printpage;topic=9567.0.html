				hello everyone.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking at an apartment today at 14th and 30th.&nbsp; My knowledge of Astoria is very limited and I wanted to get a feel for what is really in the neighborhood near that address.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to move into a not-so-nice section (if I wanted that, i&#039;d stay in Brooklyn&nbsp; :cry: )<br /><br />Would love input.<br /><br />Thanks.

				I assume you mean 14th St and 30th Ave, which is right by PS 171. The area is just OK in my opinion. I currently am closer to 21st St and Broadway, but I&#039;m looking to move someplace more in &quot;the heart&quot; of Astoria. 14th Street is far enough off the beaten path to make it iffy.

				Members who live closer to the area can probably give you a more detailed response regarding the specifics, but in my opinion it&#039;s a little far from the train. &nbsp;I used to live close to where you&#039;re considering and it took me a little over ten minutes to walk to walk, although I should note that I walk kind of slow and tend to complain about &quot;walking distance&quot; anyway. &nbsp;I guess you can take the Q19A at the corner of 21st Street and 30th Avenue, to Queensborough Plaza or the F at the 21st Street/Queensbridge stop. &nbsp;I think the Q18 which goes down 30th Avenue passes by as well.<br /><br />

				It&#039;s probably actually a good time to get in that area.&nbsp; As Astoria popularity increases, the cheaper rents out there are probably a good bet before developers take it over.

I wouldn&#039;t want to do that walk as a woman by myself at night or early in the morning. I guess it depends on who the poster is and what they are looking for. I am sure the rents are cheaper down there then on the other side of 21st. I do think it is slightly sketchy down there- just my opinion.

				14th street itself is ok in some parts, there is a lot of historical buildings around, but its real close to the projects, too far from the train (imagine walking on a day like today at night some 14 blocks from the subway there)&nbsp; in other words, not-so-nice.&nbsp; Look at places in the radius of 21st Street and Steinway, and 36th avenue and ditmars blvd, print it out on google maps, and start checking out places that fall in that square.&nbsp; Thats how I started getting myself acquainted with astoria before I moved, and once in a while I would just walk along the avenues (broadway, 36, 34,30, 23 etc) to see what area i liked the most.&nbsp; I am in Ditmars and I love it&nbsp; :-)

				Yeah the walk concerns me.<br /><br />Right now. I walk ~.4 mi to the train. &nbsp;My girfriend lives in Astroia (the other direction from the 30th Ave stop) and the walk is ~.3 mi.<br /><br />The walk to 14th St. and 30th is ~.5 mi.<br /><br />If the street is desolate it&#039;s a concern as well. &nbsp;I&#039;m sure it&#039;s a good time to get in the neighborhood, but I&#039;m not entirely interested in waiting for good stuff to happen. &nbsp;I assumed the same in my current neighborhood and ultimately it just means everything has been under construction all year and it feels dirtier and more unsafe than when i moved in.<br /><br />I&#039;m 26, male but I work late and don&#039;t want to put myself in harms way coming home if I don&#039;t need to.<br /><br />That said, it seems to be an amazing place that if very affordable. &nbsp;I&#039;m living on my own so it&#039;s hard to find somewhere in my range and with the size to accomodate my household items.

				I would spend some time walking around the area when you visit it today. &nbsp;Your instincts should give you an idea of whether or not you&#039;re going to enjoy it. &nbsp;If possible, walk around in the day and the evening to get a real feel.<br /><br />For what it&#039;s worth, I&#039;ve read many a post on this site say the area is quite safe, refuting many suggestions that it&#039;s sketchy. &nbsp;I did see an apartment over there over 2 years ago, and as a woman, I didn&#039;t like the area, it felt too desolate. &nbsp;But I have no idea if it&#039;s changed since then. &nbsp;Where I live now (Ditmars area), it&#039;s all houses, so while it&#039;s desolate, at least I know my neighbors. &nbsp;There seemed to be more factories over there, but I can&#039;t remember clearly.

				I have to agree with urrisgirl - I&#039;ve lived in Astoria all my life and wouldn&#039;t go <br />below 21st Street. And I wouldn&#039;t do that walk at night or early in the morning.<br />Plus you do have to think of the convenience factor. If memory serves me right, <br />there&#039;s not a lot there in terms of grocery shopping, banks, pharmacies, etc.&nbsp; - <br />someone correct me if I&#039;m wrong here - and you need to think about how much<br />extra time you&#039;ll spend on basic errands and stuff.

				The area use to be much better in the 1970&#039;s. There was an amazing Italian feast down there rivaling San Gennaro&#039;s downtown at the end of the Summer. I have fond memories of it when I was a child. It was a real neighborhood. Now, it is not safe at night. Hasn&#039;t been in 25 years. No matter how many &quot;luxury&quot; condos that may devour that area in the next few years, it will never be safe. There are no stores and it is completely desolate late at night, hence the plethora of illegal night clubs that are hidden throughout. I would never walk from the N train towards the river at 2am. No one does.

				I have a friend that lived right around there-- in one of those amazing houses actually, peach tree in the backyard, huge garage... Not sure what your specific address is or what the building is, but my friend&#039;s house was awesome-- Close to the water and park. Down side is that outside the cool houses/ newer constructions, the area ain&#039;t so good. I&#039;ve walked around late at night and it can be a little sketchy. Closest grocery is prob the Associated on 21st/ b&#039;way which is okay and Costco-- or join Astoria CSA.<br /><br />Since your gf is already in the area, I suggest taking a walk over there one night yourself and see what it would be like.<br /><br />The best area for access to transportation (in my opinion) is the rectangle b/w 31st street and Steinway (basically b/w N/W on one side and R/G/V other side)-- also priciest. For other cheap rents try east of Steinway around B&#039;way or 30th ave.

				Okay, so it&#039;s been 2 years since anyone posted here.&nbsp; Opinions on how the 14th St/30th Ave area has changed/stayed the same/gotten worse?&nbsp; It&#039;s definitely an annoying walk to the train, but I think it might be quite enjoyable early in the morning--that is, if I won&#039;t get shanked. Kidding.<br /><br />No but really, I&#039;ve spent a little time there day and night, and it definitely feels a bit weird walking down 30th Ave toward the River.&nbsp; Like everyone is walking alone and eyeing each other.&nbsp; But at the same time, there are so many family houses along that street, and I saw a guy talking on his phone in the little yard area.&nbsp; So it can&#039;t really be threatening right?&nbsp; FYI: I&#039;m a man but kind of a wimp, not the kind who would be able to fight if something went down at 3 am.&nbsp; Does anyone have any actual stories or stats or etc., or is it just a feeling because there arent a lot of people around?<br /><br />Also I forgot to check: are there cabs/cars waiting at the 30th Ave station? If I move it&#039;ll be around 30th Ave/14th St, so it might be nice to hop in a car and just roll down 30th ave instead of nervously walking 500 miles (500 = .5).
