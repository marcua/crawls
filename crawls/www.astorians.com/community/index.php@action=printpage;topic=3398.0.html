				I lived in Japan for six years. Like you, I just wanted to live in another country for a while. I didn&#39;t have any specific interest in Japan before. I picked it because I knew it was one of the easiest places to get a job and a work visa. I also wanted to learn more about Asia firsthand, but knew that most of the other countries would present too much of a culture shock for me. So I just needed a place to live and work that gave me easy access to the other areas.<br /><br />A friend from a previous job had worked at an English school in the countryside near Hiroshima, and he highly recommended it. They hired me and I moved without knowing a word of Japanese (other than the obvious--sayonara, arigatou, etc.). I picked up a lot more while living there, of course. I don&#39;t remember how much my expenses were, but I had a lot of money from the Internet bubble, so it wasn&#39;t a worry. However, many of the other teachers at the school were able to borrow against their salary to move there. <br /><br />I was there for a year, and then I moved to Tokyo. I knew I wanted to experience a Japanese city too, so it was either Tokyo or Osaka. I interviewed for four jobs and accepted the first offer I got. That employer renewed my visa.<br /><br />I didn&#39;t get too homesick because, like I said, Japan wasn&#39;t as big a culture shock as, say, Thailand would be. I do notice that among the foreigners in Japan, they tend to love it for the first 3 or 4 years, then they resent and even hate it for a few years. Eventually, they go back to loving it. (Except for my friend Ann, who loves and hates it at the same time.) The most frustrated people there are the ones who can&#39;t accept that they&#39;ll never be fully embraced by Japanese society. You&#39;d always be an outsider in Japan, no matter how long you lived there or how good your Japanese was. <br /><br />I have to admit that one of the best things about living in Tokyo was getting to know the foreign community. Tokyo&#39;s foreign community is no longer the wealthy clique it once was. A lot of companies have been pulling out of Japan or re-establishing their Asian bases in Hong Kong or Singapore. So I mean the large variety of people, from ambassadors to businessmen to artists to strippers. You get to know all these people from different walks of life simply because you have something in common. You&#39;re all outsiders. I don&#39;t know if foreign communities in other parts of the world are like that.

Thanks for the input, schmennifer. I was considering Tokyo because my little brother is already there on the archetypal post-college-English-teaching stint. But I am not just-out-of-college anymore, and I want to go with my husband (a lot of english teaching companies have trouble with couples who want to be placed together)...

Not exactly just out of college. And I knew a lot of people who went there looking to do something different, including couples. Which companies are you considering? People tend to hate the large companies like Aeon and Nova, but those schools do take care of their teachers as far as getting settled is concerned. I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re like on day-to-day stuff, but I do know that people who are really serious about teaching tend to hate them. You have to know what you can live with.<br /><br />One option is to sponsor your own visa. My husband did that because he had several teaching gigs around the city in addition to his children&#39;s show (remind me to tell you about that one later). You just need one employer to confirm that they&#39;re paying you at least 200,000 yen/month. It doesn&#39;t matter how much the rest of them pay.

Its a good primer.<br /><br />I don&#39;t really know where I want to go. But since I moved from LA to here four years ago, it seems like the natural &quot;eastward&quot; progression is toward western europe. I&#39;ve only visited London, Paris, and Amsterdam in my life. I loved all of them, but of course I have specific pros/cons for each city. I&#39;m not too particular at this point, I just want to keep my options open. For instance, if someone in Barcelona or Brussels or Berlin (or any non-B big city) magically offered me a job one day, I&#39;d probably take it. But since that only happens in the movies, I wanted to come up with a game plan to get myself to <em>somewhere</em>.

				I&#39;d love to live in Europe too, but the job would be a problem. I wouldn&#39;t be able to fall back on English teaching since those jobs are more likely to go to other EU citizens, like British and Irish teachers. I&#39;d have the same problem if I went as an editor of English material, which is what I did in Tokyo.<br /><br />I&#39;m trying to get my husband to agree to go back to Australia, even though I think it&#39;s too far and as isolated from other countries as America is. But I don&#39;t care. I think it&#39;d be neato to live in another country where I (just barely) understand what they&#39;re saying.

When I first moved to this city, it was challenging. And I loved it. New York might as well be another universe compared with Los Angeles. But the novelty and challenge and intrigue have all subsided (yes, I also have a short attention span). So I&#39;m looking for a new challenge, a new culture, a totally new milieu.<br /><br />I feel like I could live anywhere and I want to test that hypothesis.<br /><br />I just need a job (work visa) and some tips. I&#39;m embarking on the money-saving now. I&#39;ve got the wanderlust, bad...

				Just wanted to add my two cents, even though you already have plenty to go on!&nbsp; <br /><br />It seems that with your degree, you should certainly be able to find employment in the country of your choosing.&nbsp; I know that Australia has a specific list of who qualifies as someone they allow to work in their country (nurses, engineers, construction workers), and that their policies are in line with most of the British Commonwealth.&nbsp; (nota bene: an Art History degree will NOT qualify you, no matter what country!!&nbsp; i spent 9 months in Australia trying to get a visa to no avail......but I was able to get under the table catering jobs).<br /><br />However, when I was looking into this whole thing last year, I discovered that Scotland just implemented a new immigration policy that allows anyone who gets a professional degree at a Scottish high ed intstitution to work while they&#39;re going to school, and also allows people to stay and work in Scotland for up to two years once their degree is completed.&nbsp; And one would think that after two years of working somewhere, one might develop a rapport that would get your employer to sponsor your visa beyond the two years&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; I was super excited when I found out about this option, as it&#39;s a fantastic place to be for those of us who would prefer to be in an english speaking country, and yet so close to the European continent.<br /><br />So thats what I think&nbsp; :-D<br /><br />

				Thank you, lita!<br />The Scotland info is definately new to me and I&#39;m excited to follow up on it right now... Its a great idea to live there for a bit, as a gateway into the continent and other destinations. Especially since most western european employers prefer to sponsor British citizens as english teachers over Americans (like that accent, love that EU). <br />Also looking into the Foreign Service (thanks to MandaT) and other english teacher programs.<br />I&#39;m really not too picky. I&#39;ll wait tables in Croatia if someone will hire me and pay me enough to live.<br />

				Annie,<br /><br />Regarding your initial question regarding expenses and home sickness.....I was able to live relatively cheaply while abroad, as I was living with family.&nbsp; I imagine that after living in New York, any other city would either be similiarly expensive, or more affordable.&nbsp; Melbourne is obviously cheaper than New York City (rent-wise, food-wise, entertainment-wise), but more expensive than Syracuse (where I grew up).<br /><br />And the home sickness thing is weird......Melbourne has consistently been voted one of the most livable cities in the world, so it was very easy to get comfortable and be happy.&nbsp; However, after a while, the little idiosyncracies of living in a foreign land got to get to me (i.e. trying to get the health care system to work for me as a foreigner).&nbsp; I didn&#39;t realize it until I returned to NY, but I missed the hell out of America (despite the Bush re-election that occured in my absence).&nbsp; But it was an awesome way for me to reconnect with a country I had become completely disillusioned with......and I think it&#39;s probably the same for many who travel abroad.&nbsp; You realize the things that work, and the things that don&#39;t work.<br /><br />Anyhoo, you&#39;ll have to keep us all posted on the rest of your research and your final decisions :)

I am SO OVER this country right now, I can&#39;t even talk about it without relegating this thread to the rants and raves section. Suffice it to say that I am looking for a trial separation from my country in order to fall in love with it again later. Because I do hope to raise a family here. Just not now. Too much rage and disappointment and anxiety aimed at my government. For now, we just need to see other people, the US and I. You know, explore other relationships. If we&#39;re meant to be, we&#39;ll reunite.<br /><br />I will definately be posting all my findings here for anyone else interested!<br /><br />Thanks again!
