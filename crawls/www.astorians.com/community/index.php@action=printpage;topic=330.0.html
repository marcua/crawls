				I'm writing because of an urgent threat to many of the things we care about. Republican leaders are about to change Senate rules so that George Bush can stack the Supreme Court with right-wing judges. The impact would be so huge that even Republicans are calling this plan the &quot;nuclear option.&quot; But if we flood the Senate with phone calls, we can stop them. Will you call our Senators?<br /><br />Please take a moment to call Senators Schumer and Clinton. You don't need to be an expert to call. Just tell whoever answers (or say this in a message): &quot;Hello. I live in ______, and I would like to urge Senator _________ to oppose the 'nuclear option' and support requiring judicial nominees to have broad support in the Senate. Thank you very much.&quot; It's easy, quick, and really, really important.<br /><br /><br />Senator Charles Schumer<br />DC Phone: 202-224-6542<br />District Offices: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Albany: 518-431-4070 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Binghamton: 607-772-6792 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Buffalo: 716-846-4111 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Melville: 631-753-0978 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; New York: 212-486-4430 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Red Hook: 914-285-9741 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Rochester: 585-263-5866 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Syracuse: 315-423-5471 <br /><br />Senator Hillary Clinton<br />DC Phone: 202-224-4451<br />District Offices: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Albany: 518-431-0120 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Buffalo: 716-854-9725 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Hartsdale: 914-725-9294 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Lowville: 315-376-6118 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Melville: 631-249-2825 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; New York: 212-688-6262 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Rochester: 585-263-6250 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Syracuse: 315-448-0470 <br /><br /><br />For other senators' numbers, go to http://www.senate.gov.<br /><br />I'm doing this as part of a new MoveOn campaign called Operation Democracy. My local MoveOn team is trying hard to track our impact--can you please take a second to tell us you called by clicking here?<br /><br />http://www.moveonpac.org/team/callin/call_in.html?r_id=:1183787-KnewGUTlyKY7gjzBWggX_w&amp;team_id=618<br /><br />Centuries old Senate rules require federal judges to win broad support--this leads to fair, non-partisan courts. But Republicans are preparing to use a parliamentary trick called the &quot;nuclear option&quot; to force through every one of Bush's right-wing nominees.<br /><br />The nuclear option would eliminate the right to &quot;filibuster&quot; judges. This is basically a rule that has always allowed both parties to stop the most extreme nominees. If Republicans succeed, George Bush will be able to nominate up to four Supreme Court justices who will roll back years of progress on women's rights, labor rights, civil liberties, the environment, etc. It's scary enough that I'm asking people I know to help stop it. We're trying to get tons of calls in today. Please call right now.<br /><br />Thank you very much for helping me save the Supreme Court and protect democracy!<br /><br />P.S. For more info, click here:<br />http://www.moveonpac.org/team/0316/info.html<br /><br />P.P.S. I'll be working with other MoveOn members locally to get the word out on judges, Social Security privatization and other urgent issues. We could use some help! Please join our team by clicking here:<br /><br />http://www.moveonpac.org/team/search/signup.html?team_id=618<br /><br />PS: both of our senators are being good-- but it would be great if you could remindthem you're paying attention. :)

				i thank you very much for posting this information.<br /><br />the beauty of this great country that we live in is that we have the freedom and (many of us) have the opportunity to let our officials know how we feel about something and be part of the process to change something.<br /><br />it may not seem like it, but those fone calls, and emails really do make a difference.<br /><br />i'm a social work student, and us social workers/students in both new jersey and new york are lobbying to get legislation passed to have a loan forgiveness program for social workers working with at-risk populations. thanks to many of us speaking up, this legislation is very close to coming thru. <br /><br />so, believe! your small action DOES make a difference! <br /><br />thanks ahead of time to those who do contact their local officials-- thank you for caring about yourself, your neighbors, your country, and speaking out for what you believe!
