				Has anyone ever used it/cooked it at home?&nbsp; I have a bag of it sitting on my cupboard shelf, and would like to use it.&nbsp; I understand it&#39;s high in protein and is also kind of malty tasting.&nbsp; Would love to hear your experiences!

				This site is a great resource.&nbsp; I&#39;ve ordered from them in the past and recently noticed Best Yet Market carrying a good number of their products in their &#39;organic/natural&#39; aisle.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.bobsredmill.com/recipe/search.php?category_ID=all&amp;product_ID=33&amp;keywords=&amp;submit=%3A%3A+search+%3A%3A (http://www.bobsredmill.com/recipe/search.php?category_ID=all&amp;product_ID=33&amp;keywords=&amp;submit=%3A%3A+search+%3A%3A)

				I tried this a few months ago and it seems to be more gelantinous. I thought it would be similar to quinoa but it most certainly wasn&#39;t. I think that you can put it in bread, but I think I just boiled it and tried some kind of tomato sauce...Can&#39;t remember exactly since it was a while ago. I just remember that I didn&#39;t really eat all of it because it did seem a little difficult to work with, and it was kind of bland. It is supposed to be really healthy for you though.

				I wonder if I could mix it with a looser grain like oats for a breakfast cereal?&nbsp; That with some ground flaxseed and some fruit and milk/soymilk could make for a very nice breakfast!&nbsp; I also wonder if it would make for a good grain pudding as well, sort of like rice pudding.&nbsp; I imagine its gelatinous quality would make it very good for a vegan pudding, not having to use eggs as a binder.&nbsp; wasabisam, what do you think?<br /><br />Has anyone seen it at Fresh Start, too?&nbsp; I may have to throw my amaranth out, come to think of it, because I&#39;ve had it for so long!&nbsp; Or does it go bad?&nbsp; Anyway, I&#39;ll check out the link provided.&nbsp; Thank you!
