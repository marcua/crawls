				Can be any album, but it has to be the whole album.&nbsp; Can&#039;t just post an album because of one or two songs on it are good.&nbsp; what <span class="bbc_u">I would ultimately like to do is narrow all of the replies down to 10 albums and then do a poll</span> to decide the truly best album.&nbsp; Let&#039;s say by August 1st. <br /><br />So please, really think about it before you post -- don&#039;t just put an album because its your favorite band, but because it truly is a great album.<br /><br />If this has been done already, let me know and I will cancel the poll.<br /><br />I&#039;ll go first:<br /><br />Pink Floyd -- Animals

				I just sort of listed albums that I considered to be perfect, figuring that some of those might get more votes.&nbsp; If i had to narrow it down to just one I&#039;d have to do an NCAA bracket thing, so let me mull this over, because I&#039;m coming up with more records every second.&nbsp; <br />I blame High Fidelity for my inability to categorize anything outside of a top 5 or 10 list...I will think about this, and come up with the best album ever...

				If you&#039;re intending to narrow it down by tallying instances of nomination, that would allow for multiple submissions rather than just picking one album. &nbsp;Here are twenty that I would &quot;take to a desert island&quot;, as it were, and, as should be evident, comparing one straight up with another is well-nigh impossible. &nbsp;I certainly can&#039;t even think of a single week in which I&#039;d be likely to be in the mood to play all of these in combination.<br /><br />If you really want us to narrow it down to just one, well, then, ignore this list, because I can&#039;t do that.<br /><br />White Album -- Beatles<br />Bitches Brew -- Miles Davis<br />Indeterminacy -- John Cage/David Tudor<br />Liege And Lief -- Fairport Convention<br />Shouting At The Ground -- Zoviet France<br />Apocalypse Across The Sky -- Master Musicians of Jajouka<br />Metal Box -- PIL<br />A Love Supreme -- John Coltrane<br />The Smithsonian Anthology Of American Folk Music<br />Future Days -- Can<br />Another Green World -- Brian Eno<br />Remain In Light -- Talking Heads<br />The Velvet Underground And Nico<br />Music For 18 Musicians -- Steve Reich<br />Exile On Main Street -- Rolling Stones<br />Bartok: String Quartets -- Emerson Quartet<br />Winter Songs -- Art Bears<br />Blonde On Blonde -- Bob Dylan<br />Entertainment -- Gang Of Four<br />Le Mystere Des Voix Bulgares
