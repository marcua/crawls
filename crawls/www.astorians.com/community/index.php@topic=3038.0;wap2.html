			<br />
			Hey there - I am very interested in moving to Astoria, I absolutely love the community and feel at home every time I&#39;ve visited.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am a 22 year old male, a recent college graduate currently living on my friends&#39; couch on the UES until I find a more long term solution, and can move in immediately.&nbsp; Currently I&#39;m working 7 days a week as a Production Assistant for the VMAs, and will be pursuing beginning my professional career as a freelance production assistant once the VMAs are over.&nbsp; As such, I&#39;m looking at renting around $800/mo.<br /><br />I&#39;m a clean, very friendly, and motivated guy - if you have any advice, I&#39;d love that too, as this apt. searching is exhausting in between the 11 hour days at work!<br /><br />For a little more info on me, check out my post in the Hello Thread!&nbsp; http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=516.msg26141.<br /><br />Thanks!
