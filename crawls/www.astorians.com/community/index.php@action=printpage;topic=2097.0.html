				I was reading in one of the local Astoria papers that in July there would be a farmers market coming to Astoria but it did not mention what days it would be open or the location. Does anyone have any details on this? I know about the one in LIC near Vernon Jackson- but it would be awesome if we had one in our own neighborhood!<br /><br />Thanks!<br />Urrisgirl&nbsp; :-)

				Weeeeell, the Hellgate CSA will be distributing in Astoria in June.&nbsp; It&#39;s farmer&#39;s market like except that each week you pick up your share rather than battle it out for the last bunch of ramps before the farmer drives away.<br /><br />You an find out about it online at:&nbsp; www.hellgatecsa.com (http://www.hellgatecsa.com)<br /><br />I&#39;d love to know about more Astoria veggie options though.&nbsp; I loooove the green things.

				Mmmm, ramps.<br /><br />I roasted mine and then smoked them with some bluefish.&nbsp; If you can get your hands on those disposable smoker bags, do it.&nbsp; But they need something in the bag with them to help absorb the smoke.&nbsp; Like potatoes.&nbsp; Or fish.<br /><br />US Greenmarket still had them today.&nbsp; But only for about one more week, the guy said.

				Ramps are a member of the onion family that grow wild in the Northeast (and as far south as South Carolina) in early to mid spring.&nbsp; They are also called wild leeks.&nbsp; Here are a few links to information about ramps:<br /><br />Ramps (http://www.econetwork.net/~wildmansteve/Plants.Folder/Ramp.html)&nbsp; (this first link is from New York&#39;s own Wildman Steve Brill (http://www.econetwork.net/~wildmansteve/edible%20wild%20plants.html), who leads walks in NYC parks (and other places) to discover edible plants.&nbsp; Here&#39;s (http://www.econetwork.net/~wildmansteve/Public%20Tour%20Stuff/&#39;06%20Tour%20Calendar.html) a link to this year&#39;s calendar of hikes, including hikes in Central Park, Prospect Park, and several Queens parks.<br /><br />Ramps (http://southernfood.about.com/cs/ramps/a/ramps.htm)<br /><br />Ramps (http://www.main.nc.us/yancey/Ramps/ramps_or_wild_leek.htm)<br /><br />

				I went to the greenmarket website and apparently there is a farmers market, in Astoria, on 31st Ave between 12th and 14th Streets, on Wednesdays from 8-5 beginning in July.<br /><br />For those of us who might actually be working at that time, there is a farmers market at Hunter&#39;s Point on Saturdays from 8-3, and also one on Rosevelt Island, right on the other side of the bridge, also on Saturdays<br /><br />I haven&#39;t been to the one in Astoria, but I have seen the ones in Hunter&#39;s point and on RI. I think RI has more selection, but I am not sure about the origins of the produce<br />

				The Bowling Green green market is good, also, for those who work downtown.&nbsp; I&#39;ve picked things up there time to time for lunch.&nbsp; Quite tasty stuff.
