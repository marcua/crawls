				Just a &quot;heads up&quot;...Jarred came to our place yesterday to clean our couch.&nbsp; He arrived on time, talked me through the process before he did everything (explaining that not every stain is guaranteed to come out, etc) and then did the cleaning.&nbsp; The whole process took less than an hour and the machine he uses is so quiet that it didn&#039;t even bother our somewhat skittish cats.<br />&nbsp;<br />That said, our couch looks 100 times better than I thought it would.&nbsp; All of the major stains are now gone and the minor ones are only noticeable to us because we know to look for them.<br />&nbsp;<br />His prices were incredibly reasonable and I look forward to having him back to our carpets in the spring.&nbsp; I would definitely recommend this guy!

				Hey thanks for posting Jarred which also reminds me to post about your good work.&nbsp; I used Jarred to clean my sofa upon C-J&#039;s recommendation.&nbsp; He&#039;s extremely professional and did a super job.&nbsp; There were certain things I noticed after my sofa dried and when I followed up with Jarred he suggested coming over to give my sofa another look and cleaning.&nbsp; Oh the horrors of a white sofa.....but the job he did was great.&nbsp; He&#039;s very knowledgeable and I too would definitely recommend him.
