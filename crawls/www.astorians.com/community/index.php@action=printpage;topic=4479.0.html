				Had a blast reading the papers today.<br />and for your reading enjoyment (until further scientific review) (happy xmas)- <br /><br />&nbsp;:?<br />http://www.newsday.com/news/health/ <br /><br />Virgin mothers make lizard history<br />&nbsp;<br />THE ASSOCIATED PRESS<br /><br />December 21, 2006<br /><br />CHESTER, England - As Christmas approaches, a virgin mother anxiously awaits the arrival of her offspring. She&#39;s Flora, the Komodo dragon. <br /><br />In an evolutionary twist, Flora has managed to become pregnant all on her own without any male help. And the seven baby Komodo dragons are due this festive season. <br /><br />&quot;We were blown away when we realized what she&#39;d done,&quot; said Kevin Buley, a reptile expert at Flora&#39;s home at the Chester Zoo in northern England.<br /><br />Other reptile species reproduce asexually in a process known as parthenogenesis. But Flora&#39;s virginal conception, and that of another Komodo dragon, Sungai, earlier this year at the London Zoo, are the first times it has been documented in a Komodo dragon. <br /><br />The reptiles, renowned for their intelligence, are native to Indonesia. The world&#39;s largest lizards have no natural predators, putting them on par with sharks and lions at the pinnacle of the animal kingdom. <br /><br />The cases of Flora and Sungai are described in a paper published today in Nature. <br /><br />Parthenogenesis is a process in which eggs become embryos without male fertilization. It has been seen in about 70 species, including snakes and lizards. Scientists are unsure whether female Komodo dragons always have had this latent ability to reproduce or if this is an evolutionary development. <br /><br />At 8 years old, Flora is sexually mature. Raised in captivity, she never has been exposed to a male Komodo dragon. She lives with her younger sister, Nessie. Flora&#39;s keepers first became suspicious in May, when she laid 25 eggs. <br /><br />Though it&#39;s not uncommon for female dragons to lay eggs without mating, such eggs usually are not fertilized. As a precaution, they were placed in an incubator. About half of Flora&#39;s eggs looked like real eggs - they were very white and had solid shells. When three of them collapsed, scientists took a closer look. <br /><br />&quot;We saw blood vessels and a small embryo,&quot; said Buley, one of the Nature study&#39;s authors. &quot;And we knew immediately that Flora had fertilized the eggs herself.&quot;<br /><br />The collapsed eggs, along with tissue samples from Flora, Nessie, and a male Komodo dragon, were sent to a laboratory in nearby Liverpool. Genetic testing showed that although the baby Komodo dragons are not exact Flora clones, their DNA could not have come from any other dragon. <br /><br />At the London Zoo, Sungai gave birth to four hatchlings in April through self-fertilization.<br /><br />&quot;Komodo dragons seem to be able to switch ways of reproducing to deal with a shortage of suitable boyfriends,&quot; said Dr. Rick Shine, a professor of evolutionary biology at the University of Sydney. Shine was not involved with the Nature paper.<br /><br />In contrast, other lizard species that reproduce asexually cannot mate normally. That might give Komodos a distinct survival edge. Only about 4,000 dragons remain in the wild, of which 1,000 are female. <br /><br />&quot;If female dragons can on occasion help out by virgin births, more power to them,&quot; said Trooper Walsh, a U.S.-based Komodo dragon expert, who was not connected to the study. &quot;Komodo dragons are the ultimate survivors.&quot;
