				Hi Guys!<br /><br />I was thinking about this and was wondering what you guys thought about making an online newsletter? Could be bi-monthly containing all astoria updates and local topics from the neighborhood to events or even new restaurants. <br /><br />Designing this would be no problem for me but I&#039;m going to need help with information on what&#039;s going on in the area, photographs to back it up, etc. Would anyone be interested in reporting or any good hearted editors out there with some free time?<br /><br />If you&#039;re interested, please give me a shout at scerridesign@gmail.com

				There&#039;s actually a lot of talk about doing this right now with The Whiskey Dregs and Astoria Music and Arts crew. This is a really good idea. Please email me with your thoughts on how to achieve this, etc.<br /><br />thewhiskeydregs@gmail.com

				I&#039;m one of the Joeys from Joey in Astoria and used to edit and write the blog at outerb.com.&nbsp; We&#039;re always finding out what&#039;s new in the neighborhood and I love to write.&nbsp; Plus I&#039;m a musician (a harpsichordist, and I used to freelance before I got involved managing online communities).&nbsp; I&#039;d love to get involved with a community newsletter and things that involve the arts.&nbsp; I&#039;ll forward this to whiskeydregs and blurreffect, too.<br /><br />

				if something does get started, i&#039;d be happy to submit photos for use in such a newsletter.&nbsp; i&#039;m an amateur at photography, but going out to shoot photos with a purpose gives me some direction and motivation at least.<br /><br />would this be something in print, or online?<br /><br />i think defining the parameters is a good place to start, you already said possibly bi-monthly, i think the following things need to be thought out:<br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>purpose - informational, editorial, advertisement, etc?</li><li>length</li><li>sections - you mentioned updates, local topics, events, restaurants, maybe clearly define these and stick with a few categories</li><li>contributors - accept contributions from the entire community, or have designated writers/reporters for certain sections?</li><li>editing - someone to pull this all together, suggest assignments or topics or events to cover</li></ul><br />i&#039;ve never been involved with a newsletter before, but these are the things that came to mind.&nbsp; maybe i&#039;m making this too complicated? all of the above doesn&#039;t have to mean a lot of work or people, just direction.&nbsp; it only takes a few people to write a successful blog and they write and edit their own work and decide on the topics, but it works if they are all working toward the same goal.&nbsp; sorry, i tend to ramble when i&#039;m thinking - hope some of this helps :-)

				This would be strictly online and sent as a blast email to those willing to subscribe. I&#039;m thinking the more subscribers we have, the better the possibility we can get advertising and even a little $ for those who need it for travel or resources to produce the newsletter. <br /><br />I think monthly would be the way to go, you can get a lot more information. Contributors would be welcome as well as amateur writers and photographers who want to show their stuff in the community. Shows, events, news, music, restaurants, bars, clubs, social events, dating advice, all that jimmy jazz. Let me know if you guys are still interested scerridesign@gmail.com
