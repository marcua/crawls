				anyone a member of a local astoria gym that has decent boxing classes? (not just boxing for fitness, but some more advanced stuff).&nbsp; right now I&#39;m a member of NYSC but they don&#39;t offer much (the fitness boxing is fine, but limited).&nbsp; not interested in kickboxing, just your standard pugilism&nbsp; :-P<br /><br />thanks, rob

				Rob, I&#39;m not aware of any explicitly boxing gyms in Astoria -- which surely doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t there!&nbsp; A lot of times, boxing gyms in the 718s are neighborhood deals, or tied-in with the Police Athletic League.&nbsp; Most of the little gyms I see in the neighborhood are focused on martial arts courses and don&#39;t mention boxing in their ads/displays.<br /><br />You should ask yourself how far you want to go with it, because some of the NYSC boxing instructors are pretty good and will give you a solid training in the basics, albeit without contact.&nbsp; Usually every fall they sponsor a &quot;boxing camp&quot; which costs extra, but goes the extra yard in terms of giving people solid instructions on how to box.&nbsp; I took one of those inititally, then started getting into regular classes afterwards.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been training with Jose &quot;Kid&quot; Avila for years now and always get an incredible workout with him -- I could let you know his schedule, if interested, although I know he doesn&#39;t come out to Astoria.&nbsp; I&#39;d say the main problem with most NYSC boxing instructors is that they focus on military-style calesthenics to break people down physically, but don&#39;t offer enough basic boxing instruction.<br /><br />If you want to get really serious about boxing, I&#39;d go with Kingsway or Church Street in Manhattan, or Gleasons in Brooklyn -- all of which train professional fighters and offer sparring opportunities if you&#39;re so inclined.&nbsp; Personally, I did some research on concussions (i.e., getting even one is not good ... can&#39;t imagine what it&#39;s like to be Wayne Chrebet and have eight ...) after getting my bell rung very badly once and pretty much decided the only way I was going to keep on sparring was if I got paid to do so.&nbsp; It just aint worth it to take serious head shots from someone who knows how to throw a punch unless you&#39;re good enough to win titles of some sort.<br /><br />A lot of your enjoyment/reason to keep boxing will depend on your instructor/trainer, and good ones are hard to find.&nbsp; From what I&#39;ve seen over the years, it&#39;s also simply a matter of dedication and showing up a few times a week -- I&#39;ve seen hundreds of people come and go from Kid&#39;s classes over the years, some hanging in there for weeks or months, others walking out 15 minutes into their initial class.&nbsp; But only a handful keep doing it (and most of them women).&nbsp; Guys make the mistake of thinking it&#39;s a macho/power sport, but for the most part, it&#39;s speed, coordination and endurance.&nbsp; And it&#39;s a sport well worth learning, as it provides a usable skill.&nbsp; :wink:

				So there are people that are interested in learning to box, so I assume that there are people that also enjoy watching boxing.&nbsp; Who here digs boxing on tv?&nbsp; If so, where do you go for PPV boxing matches?&nbsp; It seems to be increasingly difficult to find sports bars that show boxing matches.&nbsp; :?

				I read that some people might be interested in watching boxing at a bar. McCann&#39;s Pub in Astoria on Ditmars Blvd has boxing and most other sporting games to watch. <br /><br />I found them by chance because I&#39;ve been looking all over the damn place to find somewhere that offers the UFC fights. This was the only bar I found that shows UFC. I haven&#39;t gone yet, but the next UFC fight is Oct. 14. I&#39;m going to try to pop in that night. <br /><br />Hope this was helpful!!!&nbsp; :-)
