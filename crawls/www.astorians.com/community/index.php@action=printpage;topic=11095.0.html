				So I searched &#039;Berry picking&#039; and I saw this thread http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=2402.0 (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=2402.0) <br />and I got all excited cuz the date is 6/19 and I was like &#039;OMG that was just last week!&#039; but as it turns out it was last week two years ago :(<br /><br />What&#039;s up with the berry picking? I think strawberries and peaches are in season, and I&#039;m itching for a nature-filled weekend or even just saturday, filled with fruit and trees. I found http://www.pickyourown.org/NY.htm (http://www.pickyourown.org/NY.htm) but the options listed are limited and I don&#039;t want to start calling random people&#039;s homes even if they do run farm businesses out of them. I&#039;m not into cold calling like that. Can anyone recommend a spot for picking fruits? I don&#039;t care if it&#039;s organic or not, as long as it&#039;s within driving distance. I found http://www.indianladderfarms.com/cgi-bin/ilf.cgi (http://www.indianladderfarms.com/cgi-bin/ilf.cgi) has anyone ever been?<br /><br />All recommendations are welcome! Thanks!

				duska, this link (http://www.pickyourown.org/) you listed is fantastic! I use it all the time to try to figure out which farms I&#039;m going to hit. I&#039;d say that list gets updated pretty frequently. I wouldn&#039;t worry about calling them, and I would definitely call and make sure that you&#039;re also going in the right week, especially for strawberries and apples, sometimes they&#039;ll tell you to just come another week if they&#039;re not ready for a certain patch because something else has been picked already, or the rain has affected the strawberries,&nbsp; etc...

				Edava, thanks for the advice. What make me wary of that site is the majority of the prices are listed as &#039;05 pricing. I&#039;m not really concerned with the $, its more for the fun than for the competitive fruit prices :lol:, but I guess I&#039;ll give it another looksie. Any farms in particular you&#039;d recommend? <br />And thanks for the apple picking rec, I&#039;m definitely doing that this fall!

				I&#039;ve been going to CT farms for the past several years for strawberry and blueberry picking, so this year because of other trips to upstate NY, it&#039;ll be my first strawberry experience in NY (I&#039;ll post after going). For apple picking, I&#039;ve gone to Wilklow Orchards in Highland Falls (Ullster county) and loved all the variety they had.

				Are any of these places accessible by public transit? We&#039;re doing fruit shares this year, but would totally be fun to go and pick some ourselves...if not too hard to get there.

				In the Spring Astoria CSA&#039;s farm, Golden Earthworm, is open to the public for strawberry picking. That season is over now though. There may be some other pick-your-owns on the north/ south fork (for other berries) you can reach by train and then a short taxi (or bike) from the station.<br /><br />I really like Stone Ridge Orchard (http://stoneridgeorchard.com/), near the Catskills. They are low-spray, since organic stone fruit is near impossible to grow on a mass scale on the east coast. Most of their fruit is pick-your-own and they also have a market where they sell. Not sure how accessible it is by train though.<br /><br />I was at a massive pick-you-own (not organic) in NJ once, found on the pick your own website. They had blueberries, corn, peaches and nut trees I picked from! AMAZING. They were in south-central NJ, not sure the name.

				Johnson&#039;s Corner sounds familiar though I don&#039;t remember all those playgrounds when I was there (there was a tractor to take us around the fields though). I remember picking the farm for its proximity to Philly and wanted something on the way back to Astoria, not b/c it was the best option. If I had my choice of those I would prob go with Stults, which appears to be less agri-tainment than Johnson&#039;s, but doesn&#039;t seem to have peaches or corn u-pick. <br /><br />I say go with what you want to pick. Battleview has sour cherries, which is cool, I&#039;ve never seen that. And Russo&#039;s had tons of stuff to pick too. <br />

				Dutchess County area is as far as I&#039;d go for a day trip. Couple of years ago we went to Greig Farm and picked lots of blueberries. <br />http://www.greigfarm.com/default.html<br /><br />And since the farm is in the same town of Redhook as this place-if you have time stop by Max&#039;s Memphis BBQ for really, really delicious St Louis Cut Slow Smoked Barbecue Pork Ribs. We found this place by accident when we got lost (which is often) after leaving the Garlic Festival in Saugerties. Their key lime pie is killer too! Only problem is they don&#039;t open &#039;til 5PM but worth the trip and the wait.<br />http://www.maxsbbq.com/<br />

				You really don&#039;t have to go that far for berry picking in Astoria. There are a few mulberry trees on the SW corner of Astoria park, and they should still have fruit on them. Just remember to wear closed shoes with good traction, high socks, and mosquito repellent. If you&#039;re not willing to brave the elements, you could give them a try cleaned and prepared on Friday. I&#039;ll be using them to make a dish in a cooking class I&#039;ll be teaching. Details in the CSA and Class sections of Astorians.com.
