			I need some storage solutions/ideas. I was watching HGTV and they have all these people with big houses with plenty of spaces to put extra stuff. Holiday decorations, bikes, etc. Living in Astoria, you know how small spaces can be. What is you solution to maximizing your livable space without throwing out all your stuff.<br />

			Shelves!!<br /><br />Seriously.&nbsp; I have a good friend who&#39;s good at shelf installation, thank goodness.&nbsp; We ran a shelf along the length of my entry hallway for all my books, another one in the alcove by my kitchen for my old notebooks/photo albums, and a cute one from Home Depot with a little rail around it that hangs above my TV and holds my DVDs.<br /><br />Also, I have an older studio that came with two closets, one average-sized and one nearly walk-in.&nbsp; I also held on to my wardrobe, so I have three closets.&nbsp; I store unusued clothes and bags in the wardrobe (and suitcases on top of it), household stuff (linens, filing cabinet, vacuum, camp chairs, etc) in the small closet, and clothes/jewelry/laundry in the giant closet.&nbsp; I use the upper shelves on the giant closet for my Christmas stuff and unused collections.<br /><br />And I got risers for my full-sized bed, so I keep a few more things (granny cart, old video tapes in big tupperwares) underneath there.<br /><br />Phew.<br /><br />Vertical space is your friend in these tiny spaces...&nbsp; :lol:<br /><br />If I do get a bike, I&#39;m worried about storage spaces.&nbsp; They have those wall mounts for bikes, but it would be awkward in my place to say the least.&nbsp; I might get a folding bike, I think I could make room for it in one of my closets!

			I tried to maximize vertical space - putting up an extra shelf in my closet, getting cabinet organizers to create more shelf space, etc. &nbsp;The Container Store is great for stuff like that. &nbsp;Stacked milk crates also work really well. &nbsp;What kind of stuff are you trying to make room for?

			Choose pieces of furniture that double as storage space - ottomans/seating benches where the top pops off, coffee table that&#39;s more like a chest, even end tables that are not pedestal, but have storage space.

			for stuff you don&#39;t really use much but want to keep you can always put it in a storage place.&nbsp; I&#39;m slowly buying furniture that doubles as storage.&nbsp; I think bookshelfs can help a lot.&nbsp; You can buy a wardrobe closet.&nbsp; However, there is one problem that I haven&#39;t figured out.&nbsp; I moved in June.&nbsp; I have a lot more storage space than I used to in my other apt in astoria.&nbsp; I have two huge wardrobe closest (long, they don&#39;t hit the ground and they&#39;re not that wide) and a pantry like closet with little box like spaces (like cubies).&nbsp; I don&#39;t have a regular hallway closet.&nbsp; My bedroom doesn&#39;t even have closets... it&#39;s the smaller bedroom that has the wardrobes!&nbsp; My problem is that there is no place to put things like the vaccum cleaner, the shopping cart, the ladder.&nbsp; the shopping cart i have foldeded up between the wall and a peice of furiture.&nbsp; I think it looks ugly! etc.&nbsp; Any suggestions for me.&nbsp;
