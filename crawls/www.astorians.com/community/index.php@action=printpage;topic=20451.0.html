				Anyone know of a classy dining restaurant in Astoria?&nbsp; <br />We&#039;re looking for a <em>jacket and tie required place </em> for a very special occasion. <br />It seems that dressing like a slob while dining out is the norm.&nbsp; The idea of celebrating anniversaries, graduations, etc. surrounded by people in cargo shorts and flip flops sullies the idea of a classy dining experience. <br /><br />Thanks<br />

				Jacket and tie <em>required</em>?&nbsp; Good luck finding that.<br /><br />Why does it need to be required for you to dress up?&nbsp; For example, you could go to Trattoria L&#039;incontro and get dressed up and not feel out of place or over dressed.&nbsp; I think there are a bunch of places where that would apply.

				Thanks for the suggestions!<br />Well.. <em>jacket required</em> might be an overstatement.:-D&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to end up sitting next to some slobs that look like they just dragged themselves out of bed.<br />

				Jacket and tie not required but some have, some don&#039;t. I stand by Bartollinos then. Great food, amazing service. Reasonable prices.<br />

				I personally hoped that jacket and tie required places were long gone.&nbsp; But if you want some local places that are &quot;linen table cloth&quot; type and would generally not attract the ripped jeans/t-shirt set, then these may work.&nbsp; But as someone who can&#039;t stand the summer heat, I greatly appreciate that just about any restaurant in Astoria welcomes me in shorts.&nbsp; That is neat shorts, polo shirt, and decent footware.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad most of those hangups are gone.&nbsp; The fact that so few white collar workers dress in suits anymore made it impossible for restaurants to support an outdated dress code.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.piccola-venezia.com/<br />http://www.trattorialincontro.com/<br />http://www.bartolinosastoria.com/<br />http://www.aegeancove.com/<br />http://www.philoxeniarestaurant.com/

				I second Piccola Venezia, Trattoria L&#039;incontro and Aegean Cove.&nbsp; I would add Christos Steak House http://www.christossteakhouse.com/ and if you wanted to venture to LIC, Water&#039;s Edge http://www.watersedgenyc.com/ and Testaccio Ristorante http://www.testacciony.com/

				Don&#039;t know how large your group will be, but I&#039;d also suggest 718. I&#039;ve gone there a couple of times for<br />birthdays and Valentine&#039;s Day. Very good food/service and everyone is usually well dressed. I&#039;ve never seen<br />jeans/sneakers or really casual attire there.<br /><br />And I&#039;m with you. I think it&#039;s too bad that people don&#039;t want to look good when they go out anymore. <br />I&#039;m always amazed when I go to a nice restaurant or the theatre and people show up dressed the way <br />I look to go to the gym. I guess it&#039;s how you&#039;re brought up. My parents took us to restaurants, museums and<br />theatre when we were young and we learned that you dressed appropriately for those occasions.<br /><br />

I know young men today who don&#039;t even own a suit! I can recall sitting at my bedroom window looking down and watching people pass by, and knowing where they were going by the way they were dressed.

				I second the Waters Edge in LIC. Very old school. They do have a sign near the entrance that states that jackets are required for men. I&#039;m not sure if its enforced, but I was wearing one last time I was there.<br /><br />They&#039;ve got a great view of Manhattan too.
