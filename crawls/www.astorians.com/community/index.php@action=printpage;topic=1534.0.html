				Got this message from a friend and thought I would pass it on to you:<br /><br />JUST A REMINDER.... Starting February 1, 2006, all cell phone&nbsp; <br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;numbers are being released to telemarketing companies and you<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;will&nbsp; start to receive sales calls. YOU WILL BE CHARGED FOR THESE<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;CALLS....<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To prevent this, call the following number from your cell<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;phone:888-382-1222.It is the National DO NOT CALL list. It<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;will only take a minute of your time. It blocks your number<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for five (5) years.<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;HELP OTHERS BY PASSING THIS ON TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS OR GO TO:<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;www.donotcall.gov http://www.donotcall.gov/<br /><br />[Note: I personally <em>like</em> receiving calls from telemarketers. I wait for them to call. I try to keep them on the phone as long as possible. My record is around 45 minutes. I do not like being charged for this service however. I wish they would call me on Skype. :-)]

				What Phone Numbers Can I Register?<br /><br />(You never know; but I generally think thrice before asking to be added to a govt list.<br /><br />Where is big brother when you need him?<br /><br />This may be my 69+1 posting. Hoping for a good game this Sunday<br />&nbsp;8-) )<br /><br /><br /><br />10. Can I register my cell phone on the National Do Not Call Registry?<br /><br />Yes, you may place your personal cell phone number on the National Do Not Call Registry. The registry has accepted cell phone numbers since it opened for registrations in June 2003. There is no deadline to register a home or cell phone number on the Registry. <br /><br />You may have received an email telling you that your cell phone is about to be assaulted by telemarketing calls as a result of a new cell phone number database; however, that is not the case. FCC regulations prohibit telemarketers from using automated dialers to call cell phone numbers. Automated dialers are standard in the industry, so most telemarketers don’t call consumers on their cell phones without their consent. <br /><br /><br />***<br /><br />&quot;All content is the property of Eric Sundwall any reproduction is probably read more.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Copyright&nbsp; 2006&quot;<br /><br />http://www.ericsundwall.com/<br /><br />Absolute Democracy

				Alas, this is not happening, though there is a grain of truth to the story to make it believable. I added my cell phone to the donotcall registry a long time ago assuming some loophole would open up making it possible for telemarketers to call at will. That loophole does not exist (yet). <br /><br />It already is legal to call anyone using predictive dialers (i got one such call on my cell yesterday), but the wardialing technique most telemarketers use is illegal and remains so.<br /><br />Here&#39;s the whole story about this e-mail rumor:<br />http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2005/04/dnc.htm<br />http://www.snopes.com/politics/business/cell411.asp<br /><br />

				Further note: I did not add my name to the &quot;do not call list&quot; as of yet because I do in fact remain sceptical. In fact either AT&amp;T or Verizon (I forget which) was recently taken to court and sued over this. They were accused of &quot;selling&quot; or otherwise distributing this very list to telemarketers.<br /><br />Isn&#39;t it ironic that people can subscribe to this list and as a result get even <em>more</em> telemarketing calls? Why, an analogy would be an even more&nbsp; &quot;secure&quot; browser for the internet that advertised itself as &quot;anti-spam&quot; which actually made people <em>more</em> vulnerable to spamming or direct marketing.<br /><br />On the above case I still have to read the article but will post it up when I eventually find it.<br /><br />-zeno/-cf<br /><br />[Later: Ok, here is one article... but it goes deeper than this... enjoy :-) ... I&#39;ll add to this list as I gather more information]<br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>FTC sues alleged do-not-call list offender (http://msnbc.msn.com/id/5887167/)</li></ul><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In July, AT&amp;T, the telecommunications group that maintains the registry, agreed to pay $490,000 to settle FCC charges that it made repeated calls to 29 consumers who had asked not to be called back — a violation of earlier telemarketing rules put in place in 1991. But the FCC closed a second investigation into complaints that AT&amp;T had violated the do-not-call list.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />-0

				In regards to the above post concerning AT&amp;T, I offer a retraction. I believe they were never accused of selling or otherwise distributing the &quot;Do not call list&quot;. Please accept my humble apologies for spreading misinformation.<br /><br />-zeno.

				While it might not be legal for them to call the cell phone, they still do. My husband gets telelmarketers calling his cell phone all the time.
