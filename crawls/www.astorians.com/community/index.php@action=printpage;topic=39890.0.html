				Dear Astorians,<br /><br />Today I ordered an egg-and- cheese sandwich on a roll, a New York staple, with or without bacon. Before Thanksgiving, approximately, I always got it with the cheese already melted. Now I get it unmelted at three eateries so far, and I have to send the sandwich back to get it with melted cheese. This was never the case until some time this fall.<br /><br />I fell in love with egg-and-cheese sandwiches while I was working in Harlem, before I retired 3 years ago. I continued ordrring them after I retired. No matter where in NYC I ordered them, I invariably got melted cheese. Now, within the last two months, I&#039;ve been getting the the cheese unmelted.<br /><br />In the restaurant where I&#039;m eating my sandwich now, after sending the first one back, the counterman says that nothing has changed, that they&#039;ve always served unmelted cheese, and says, &quot;I&#039;m not going round and round with you.&quot; But I remember this place&#039;s egg &amp; cheese sandwiches, and he remembers me. I know the bliss I&#039;ve had with previous sandwiches here, and he expects me to alter my memories on his say-so.<br /><br />So has a decree come down to all the little breakfast places, &quot;Henceforth the default for all egg &amp; cheese sandwiches shall be with unmelted cheese&quot;? How are we supposed to keep track of these ukases? The weirdest thing is that counter staff abandon their usual courtesy and get <i>angry</i> when you say this is not what you ordered.<br /><br />Thanks to Toast &amp; Roast on Broadway for bucking the trend so far. Best egg &amp; cheese sandwich in Astoria.<br /><br />The same thing happened in the 90&#039;s or aughts with coffee. I ordered coffee regular at an eatery in Elmhurst and they gave me coffee with milk &amp; sugar. No, I said, I ordered regular, which means milk no sugar. The counter woman shot back, &quot;That&#039;s what you think!&quot; I replied, &quot;That&#039;s what I know.&quot;<br /><br />From that time on I never ordered &quot;coffee regular&quot; again. The meaning was too unreliable. I established the habit of ordering &quot;coffee, milk, no sugar.&quot; So when I went to a caf√© here in Astoria and ordered exactly that, I got coffee with milk &amp; sugar. I sent it back, and was told that &quot;regular&quot; means milk and sugar. I had not ordered regular; I&#039;d ordered milk, no sugar. I&#039;d learned my lesson.<br /><br />I told the counterman that most places melt the cheese without being told to. He said we don&#039;t (actually they used to until earlier this month), and if you want melted cheese you should ask for melted cheese. <br /><br />But since not every place require you to spell it out, I suppose I should make my default order &quot;egg and melted cheese on a roll. What next - will I have to order &quot;one chicken egg and melted American cheese on an untoasted hard roll made with wheat flour&quot;?<br /><br />ETA:<br /><br />I&#039;m the last customer remaining, the restaurant management has just turned the radio up to a deafening volume, and I think he&#039;s continuing to turn the gain up. Let him. I&#039;m not leaving until I&#039;m finished sending this message.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I would simply like to commend you on the novel that you wrote about melted cheese at a diner and about sugar in bodega coffee.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I can only hope that when I am retired like you, that I have more to occupy my time than with nonsense such as this

				Why is Lady With Pans ordering this kind of thing in a restaurant?&nbsp; She&#039;s got the pans, why isn&#039;t she making it at home?&nbsp; What bothers me about her post is the un-toasted roll.&nbsp; If I were making it, I&#039;d make the eggs, put them on the bottom part of a roll, put the cheese on the eggs &amp; cover it with the top part of the roll.&nbsp; Lining the baking pan with aluminum foil, of course, <em>I&#039;m </em>not cleaning up melted cheese, I&#039;d bake the sandwich in the oven where, of course, the roll would get toasted toasty, and of course, the cheese melts.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t start drinking coffee till I was half my present age, so I wasn&#039;t educated in coffee lingo.&nbsp; When I first started drinking coffee I put in massive amounts of raw sugar.&nbsp; After a while I realized I was drinking it for the sugar and had no idea what the coffee tasted like.&nbsp; I cut back and cut back on the sugar, and now, unless the coffee is served iced,&nbsp; can&#039;t stand sugar in coffee.&nbsp; Recently the store ran out of 1/2&amp;1/2 and I had to buy cream instead.&nbsp; When I went back to using 1/2&amp;1/2 it seemed sadly watery.&nbsp; I lost about 4 lbs while using the cream.&nbsp; Maybe I should go back to using it.&nbsp;
