				The following report is about &quot;Purity Balls&quot;. Events where conservative christian daughters sign chastity pledges wit their daddys and he even gives her a chastity ring.&nbsp; I can respect the chastity pledge but the ceremony with Daddy and daughter creeps me out.<br /><br />http://rawstory.com/news/afp/No_sex_please_we_re_daddy_s_little__03222007.html

				I saw something about that on TV a few days ago. <br /><br />Yeah, the whole thing about dad&#039;s being present in their children&#039;s lives is important, and I&#039;m not anti-chastity. But the whole &quot;getting all dolled up in a cute dress to spend the evening dancing with your dad&quot; is just weird. why not let them have a well-chaperoned event with boys their age, so they can learn something about how to interact with the opposite sex in a healthy, mature way in a safe setting?

				Maybe I&#039;m being juvenile, but I find the name &#039;Purity <strong>Ball</strong>&#039; for a chastity ceremony to be funny&nbsp; :-D&nbsp; Anyone else?<br /><br />Not as amusing, is this bit taken from the story:<br /><br /><strong>But critics say that while teaching abstinence to children may be laudable, it is just as essential to make them aware of sexually transmitted diseases and condom use.<br /><br />They also point to studies showing that the majority of adolescents who take purity pledges break them within a few years, often by engaging in risky and unprotected sex.</strong><br /><br />Where is the boy&#039;s ceremony?&nbsp; <br /><br />

				There was a story about it in (I think) O Magazine. Seemed pretty freaky because it sounded, to me at least, like the fathers they interviewed were basically saying they &quot;owned&quot; their daughter&#039;s virginity. The fathers&#039; relationships with their daughters just seemed very creepy sexual predator-like and their wives were all cool about it. <br /><br />Freud would have had a field day with this... <br /><br />

				This is a little OT, perhaps, but does anyone know if Jessica &amp; Joe Simpson were at one of these Purity Balls?!&nbsp; That&#039;s one creepy preacher/father!&nbsp; If you&#039;ve ever seen him in an interview talking about his daughter, you&#039;ll know what I&#039;m talking about!&nbsp; My favorite line from him regarding his daughter:<br /><br />&quot;Jessica never tries to be sexy. She just is sexy. If you put her in a T-shirt or you put her in a bustier, she&#039;s sexy in both. She&#039;s got double D&#039;s! You can&#039;t cover those suckers up!&quot;

				The biggest concern with these groups, and the purity balls is that safe sex and masterbation are not discussed, taught, explained, etc...Research shows that when the &quot;purity ball&quot; girls finally to have sex, they don&#039;t use condoms or birth control...<br /><br />and yea, it is a little creepy, but the lack of education and open discussion of sex is creepier.

				The Today Show had a story on this a few weeks ago.&nbsp; They interviewed a father who had been taking his 3 daughters to the ball since they were very young.&nbsp; &nbsp;I doubt any of these girls as young as 9 know much about what exactly virginity means, and the fact that their fathers are taking them to a ball, dancing with them all night in their cute dresses, and the night is centered around not having sex until you are married because your father owns it until he &quot;gives&quot; you to your husband - well, it&#039;s just creepy and disgusting.&nbsp; No word is mentioned on the involvement of your mother in this.&nbsp; And boys get off scot free.&nbsp; It&#039;s all well and good for a boy to lose his virginity, but not for a girl.&nbsp; Where are the mothers taking their sons to purity balls?&nbsp; And on top of all that, safe sex is not discussed and these children grow up with a complete lack of education regarding their sexuality.&nbsp; The whole thing is just so backwards, and really makes me sick.

				I can&#039;t even read this thread....s___ like this makes me angry. Asking girls to talk even less about their sexuality only makes them more susceptible to someone abusing it, and to a life of not understanding how to have a healthy and happy sex life for themselves...they should revel in their sexuality for their own sake, not as some contrived gift....WTF...a gift? this whole topic makes me sick.

				I think that this is rather antequated. I can understand how a hundred years ago (or more) people would have issues with women losing their virginity before marriage because that was part of how the culture functioned. But now, when most people sleep around, as well as women owning their sexuality more than ever before, it is a bit weird to have small groups like this to try and curb people&#039;s sexual activities sans education.<br /><br />I understand wanting to protect someone from pregnancy and STDs, but like has been said many times in this thread already if people are uneducated they are going to be more reckless.<br /><br />I also grew up in a conservative Christian home and went to conservative Christian schools. To be honest I never had a sex ed class, and I think that is unfortunate. While I was rarely careless myself, I know a lot of people that were. It&#039;s like giving someone who hasn&#039;t had a medical education their medical tools and trusting them to operate on patients without messing anything up.

				What kind of diversity? Uneducated young women who never learn to enjoy their body&#039;s? Yeah, I guess it is diversity but under that argument, we need a spectrum of just about every view out there. Like diversity on the view of votes for women, on gay marriage, on abortion....is diversity on issues always a good thing? Not when it brings harm to others. Touting virginity as a gift not only leads to un-educated decision making, but then what of the girl that no longer has this &quot;gift&quot;...is she less of a woman in these communities...I don&#039;t think diversity spun from ignorance is a good thing. <br />

				I and most of family (aunts and cousins) were taught that abstinence before marriage is important (and that to do otherwise is a sin). Some of us adhered to that and some of us didn&#039;t, but we all seem to be happy with ourselves, as far as I can tell (I haven&#039;t taken a poll, but sometimes people offer a lot of information :P) <br /><br />People can make a choice to not have sex before marriage and be happy with that choice.<br /><br />On the darker side, I did know one girl, a minister&#039;s daughter, who got pregnant when she was 18. She actually managed to hide her pregnancy until her 3rd trimester. Once her mother figured it out, she was very much taken care of by her family. They supported her and as far as I could tell the people in the church more or less minded their own business. I&#039;m sure there was gossip, but I never heard any of it. It&#039;s all water under the bridge now. Her son was thoroughly spoiled and adored by everyone in the community. <br /><br />There are two problems that I see here:<br />1) I have no idea whether or not the girl was aware of safe sex practices and whether or not they were used, but that question does come up<br />2) That (to certain minds) not only is sex a sin, but that being sinful (or faulty, if you prefer) and human are inadmissable crimes. People are welcome to promote chastity as far as I&#039;m concerned, but they should give their children adequate information to take care of themselves and they should make it VERY clear to their children that they will love and support them regardless of their choices.<br /><br />Of course, not everyone does love and support their children regardless of their choices. Heck, some people beat their kids. Some people don&#039;t give a flying f___ what their kids even do. At least the abstinence-only crowd seems to care what their children do - but for the right reasons? <br />

				Notice I said &quot;care what their children do&quot; and not &quot;care about their children.&quot;<br /><br />I believe they DO care what their children do, because they are making this investment of time and effort into this event. Effort shows you care. But I question whether they care what their children do because they want them to be happy, or because they are afraid of how it would look to others if their teenager was pregnant or sexually active. <br /><br />I&#039;m not saying that they aren&#039;t motivated by their children&#039;s happiness - I think most parents are, and what they think is best for their children&#039;s happiness will depend on their intelligence, geographical setting, access to information, political and religious thinking, the time frame, etc. But &quot;What&#039;s best for me&quot; is a powerful motivation too. And in conservative christian circles, &quot;what&#039;s best for me&quot; can have a lot to do with being and having a reputation as a righteous, god-fearing christian/parent/etc. <br /><br />I think a lot of conservative christians whose teens do become pregnant or sexually active feel that they have failed their children in something very important.

				I think you can draw a line in the &quot;everyone&#039;s entitled to their own opinion&quot; sand at the point where an opinion is connected with behavior that clearly harms another. Even then, people are entitled to their own opinions. We can&#039;t legislate thought, we can only legislate behavior. If someone thinks racism is not wrong, but does not own slaves or engage in discrimination - it&#039;s just an opinion. An ugly opinion, imo, but no one is being harmed other than the opinionator. Sure, you can argue - and I won&#039;t say you shouldn&#039;t - but it&#039;s hard to change people&#039;s minds on these issues by arguing. <br /><br />If someone thinks racism is not wrong and owns slaves, that is something that can and should be acted on. <br /><br />Life is complicated. People I think are sick and twisted probably think I am sick and twisted. Some of us would probably have burned each other at the stake many times over if we could get away with it. As long as we can all remember our own and each other&#039;s humanity - the possibility that we are mistaken, the possibility that intelligent people can disagree with us for good reasons, the possibility that their intentions are good even if their logic is bad - we have some hope. <br /><br />To take this back to the original topic: I think there&#039;s a valid argument that it&#039;s harmful to not inform teens about sex, though I don&#039;t think it ranks at the same level of harm as child abuse. And frankly, most of our parents do harm us in one way or another, and it&#039;s just something to live with. I mean, why do we rant about this instead of not being breast-fed, being potty-trained before we were ready, or that god-awful over-cooked liver. :P I don&#039;t know where we get the idea that we all have a basic human right to never be hurt or misguided. Ultimately we&#039;re responsible for our own actions and our own happiness.<br /><br />That said, I still think the father-daughter ball is just plain weird.

				This takes the theme of &quot;Father/Daughter Dance&quot; concept to a creepy level. Encouraging abstinence is okay so long as the parent knows the daughter (and even the son) is educated about sex. Ignorance is not acceptable in today&#039;s world. Expecting that one&#039;s child will never engage in any sexual activity before their wedding night is delusional. Way too many kids try alternate sex acts, and end up with STDs they don&#039;t even know about.

Really? <br /><br />If a person&#039;s ignorance leads him to disapprove of another person&#039;s rational perspective/behavior, the proper response of the rational person is not to chalk it up to diversity and celebrate it. One proper response would be to say, &quot;You&#039;re entitled to your opinion, but not to facts. Here are the facts and evidence you haven&#039;t clearly considered.&quot; Or, &quot;You&#039;re entitled to your opinion, but not to impose it upon anyone else.&quot;<br /><br />The range of human behavior that involvles fraud and/or coercion should be excluded from the list of diverse experiences worth celebrating. Dishonesty and aggression are essentially bad. (Lying to a Nazi about a Jew in the basement is less about being dishonest and more about refusing to enable aggression. One can posit a logical rule, that when honesty leads directly to coercion(&quot;The Jew is in the basement, Mr. SS man.&quot;), a person has a moral sanction to be dishonest. But aggression, I contend, is unjustifiable. Some utilitarians like to say, &quot;What if a man develops the cure for cancer in his house and refuses to share it. Do we have a moral right to force it from him?&quot; My answer is &quot;no.&quot; I would also point out that the man who cures cancer, realistically, isn&#039;t likely to behave the way utilitarians NEED him to behave in this kind of absurd attempt at moral argumentation.) <br /><br />Regarding this thread, it&#039;s great if only because it got me to hum the AC/DC song, but also, seriously, because it brings up a point that makes reasonable people very uncomfortable. <br /><br />We&#039;re all on the same boat (if not in the same room on that boat) about beating children constituting bad parental behavior. But when a parent commits fraud against his/her children, say by imposing the strictures of Christian/Islamic/Judaic mythologies on them as if there are real post-mortem consequences when there simply aren&#039;t, our legal system doesn&#039;t make it possible for anyone to emancipate them, including the kids themselves. It&#039;s legally permissible to tell a kid that he&#039;ll spend eternity in hell if he takes penicillin, or if she has premarital sex, or if he or she masturbates, for all kinds of reasons that are utterly fraudulent. In the workplace, we don&#039;t tolerate the adult boss telling the adult secretary to blow him or lose her job because of the Power he holds over her in his position as employer. That power pales beside that of a parent filling her child&#039;s mind with fairy tales about sin and hell that make her resent her/his body, her/his sexuality, her/his curiosity, her/his intellectuality. <br /><br />I&#039;m not saying there should be a law against parents &quot;teaching&quot; their children to be servile, anti-sexual, anti-intellectual automatons. There shouldn&#039;t be laws against any ideas per se. But maybe there should be a legal framework within which children can more easily emancipate themselves from their parents on the grounds of seeking to avoid religious indoctrination.&nbsp; <br /><br />-Adam<br /><br />P.S. Frappe, you wrote, &quot;Where the line is drawn is anyone&#039;s guess, but I&#039;d put it at the point where one is transgressing on someone else&#039;s rights.&quot; But you believe (I gather from reading you posts, over time, here in the forums) that people have &quot;rights&quot; that oblige others to act on their behalf without others&#039; consent, making you an advocate of the use of force to achieve the ends that you, Frappe, prioritize. So, when you write, &quot;diversity is always a good thing&quot;... you really don&#039;t mean &quot;always.&quot; Certainly not when people resist the measures you advocate that involve using some people&#039;s resources without their consent, right?

You give the impression that you&#039;re not in the circle, but maybe you are and you&#039;re trying to make a larger point about how it&#039;s all relative and who is any one of us to say beating a child should be wrong for anyone other than ourselves... or maybe you&#039;re simply casting aspersions without actually making them? You say my assumption (specifically, &quot;we are in the same boat about beating children being bad parental behavior&quot;) is unfounded on every level. Really? EVERY level? Who are you?<br /><br />&quot;We&quot; who believe that beating children is wrong (or that filling daughters&#039; minds with fantastical notions about their sexuality is wrong) have something in common. We&#039;re probably not religious fundamentalists. The &quot;we&quot; I was referring to are the posters in this thread, who for the most part seem to be humanists.

It&#039;s simply an accurate description.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=5650.msg79661.html#msg79661">Quote from: Frappe on June 29, 2007, 08:56:45 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> 2.&nbsp; Your population control example is poorly chosen.&nbsp; It&#039;s an interesting subject, however, the issue of diversity is utterly unrelated to this matter.&nbsp; &nbsp;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The population control discussion that we had in the last few pages of the global warming thread is completely relevant, and it&#039;s the best example for me to provide because it involved direct communication between us. <br /><br />Diversity, by definition, applies to the full range of human behavior. It includes choosing to have a child or many or none, and all of the reasons and values and contexts surrounding that issue. It also includes choosing to raise children a certain way, or to set rules governing how children are raised.<br /><br />I wrote, &quot;You can&#039;t have diversity without individual choice. The moment you express enthusiasm for a law that bans people from choosing to procreate, you&#039;ve basically crossed the line from appreciating diversity to punishing it.&quot;<br /><br />Your response is basically evasive.&nbsp; &nbsp;[/quote]<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=5650.msg79661.html#msg79661">Quote from: Frappe on June 29, 2007, 08:56:45 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> 3.&nbsp; You are making a knowledge claim when describe certain religious practices as mythological, fraudlent, manipulative, et cetera.&nbsp; Though you feel some practices may be reckless, others do not agree with you.&nbsp; Neither side has an obligation to prove itself.&nbsp; The general standard in this country draws the line at dangerous, physical abuse.&nbsp; After that, its just choices and what business do you have in making such choices?&nbsp; Is it better to raise children by inadvertantly teaching them to love money, consumer goods and pop culture (which is the general trend)?&nbsp; Worry about raising your own kids and let other parents worry about raising theirs.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Bottom line, there is a significant different between having faith in the existence of something for which no empirical data is demonstrable and insisting that claims about the truth of any proposition must be based on a rational grasp of empirical data.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Person A makes a claim affirming the existence of something for which no empirical basis is possible. Person B points out, &quot;there is no empirical basis for that claim.

Also, if I don&#039;t believe them I go to hell.&quot;) or wish-fulfillment fantasies (&quot;I like to believe in X, so X is real.&quot;) or other similar delusions/fears/desires. <br /><br />Let&#039;s make that concrete, a little more realistic. Daddy (Person A) says God wants you, his daughter, to save your virginity for the man Daddy accepts as a proper husband. You (Person B) respond that you&#039;d like to know how Daddy knows this and you request some independent confirmation, something more than his word. Daddy takes you to a priest who opens a book and talks about heaven and hell and original sin and the sinfulness of masturbation and of extramarital romance. You go to the Purity Ball with Daddy. &lt;Flash forward.&gt; After years of sexual incompatibility with your husband, you become anxious and depressed, feeling that it would be wrong to leave your marriage because of the kids.... the extramarital affair makes you happy but you hate yourself for it. <br /><br />Cliche. Real.

				1.&nbsp; &nbsp;Maintaining that simply because one advocates <span class="bbc_u">any</span> measure that might be restrictive on the activities of others as an example of not tolerating diversity is an aggressive misapplication of logic.&nbsp; You are confusing a person&#039;s responsibility towards society and a society&#039;s responsibility towards a person.&nbsp; (add to the fact that I clearly advocate a hands off policy when it comes to other countries and your accusation of intolerance becomes bewildering).<br />2.&nbsp; See above.<br />3.&nbsp; So are you maintaining that non-purity ball folk suffer from less martial problems?

				Really interesting thread... thought I&#039;d throw in my $0.02.<br />These purity balls, in my opinion, are dangerous. They breed the kind of &quot;Obedience without question&quot; mentality that has caused religious conflict since the beginning of time, albeit on a lesser level. Raising your kid with a set of morals is fine, but it is your responsibility to justify it to your child. <br />In a modern society, it still baffles me that there is such an abundance of people that willingly accept the &quot;God said so&quot; rationale. This is the kind of mentality that breeds things such as terrorism and xenophobia. Do purity balls equal terrorism? Of course not. Is the rationale similar? Yes. People have the right to objective truth. People have the responsibility to justify their actions of they affect others. <br />I don&#039;t understand how parents can just say &quot;X scripture from X religion says XYZ is true because God said so&quot;. I think it is irresponsible to not teach your kids to question rationalizations. <br />I think I would be more comfortable with parents just flat out saying to their kids, &quot;I fear you getting pregnant or contracting STDs, and for your safety, I think your best course of action at this point is abstinence&quot;. Maybe this way, their kids won&#039;t grow up fearing &quot;The Gays&quot;, &quot;The Heathens&quot; or &quot;The coloreds&quot; because some old scripture said they were evil.

				Purity Balls would be okay if it were taught along with sex education and safe sex practices as an alternate option. It&#039;s unrealistic to expect all teenagers in high school and even in their college years to remain chaste and virginal. It&#039;s also a travesty to allow kids to remain ignorant about sex. Too many of those who took the Purity Balls oath end up having sex with no protection or knowledge of proper birth control. Some even engage in oral and anal sex, deluding themselves to believe that they&#039;re virginity is still intact.<br /><br />I know that I would prefer that my kids have sex later in life rather than sooner, but I know that sex education is a must in today&#039;s world of STDs, AIDS, and unwanted prengancies. Ignorance is no excuse. Purity Balls are naive at best, and very harmful to the teens.

				These &quot;Purity Balls&quot; are just another means for males to control the sex lives of women. Notice how there are no purity balls for father and son, or for mother and daughter. Not that they would be any better. The entire function of these purity balls is to reinforce this double standard, where its not that bad when males have sex, but if the virginity of &quot;daddy&#039;s little girl&quot; is taken, all hope is lost. <br />Obviously, these purity balls will have no impact on teen pregnancy or STD prevention, since anything that only promotes abstinence is doomed to fail. Whatever happened to parents sitting down with their kids and having a nice intellectual conversation about sex and the importance of using protection. That is the best way parents can inform and help their children regarding the issue of sex and its consequences.
