				I totally agree. Lights out one night a year! People were so kind, outgoing, and there were cops just driving up and down the streets, making sure everyone was ok.&nbsp; <br />I remember drinking a copious number of mudslides (hey, the milk was gonna go bad), gorging on steak and lobster ravioli, hanging with a neighbor who had a pet rat (!) and generally getting loaded. Woke up at 7am when the power came back on!<br /><br />

				I was working in Times Square, in the Reuters building, on the 20-somethingth floor. <br /><br />My company paired up people who lived in Manhattan with people who didn&#039;t, so that everyone had a place to stay. I crashed with a coworker on the UES. She was from Bangladesh and very blase about the whole thing. The next morning I caught a bus across the bridge and then shared a car with a couple of other women most of the rest of the way. By the time I got home I had power and was able to take a shower, much to my delight. Then I went across the street and had a huge meal at Crescent Corner.

				OMG that was when my cousin and his wife visited us from Japan. What a good impression that made ! :lol:<br /><br />But it was the last day they were here and they were very good natured about it. I think they almost enjoyed it. They took home an issue of the Daily News with the screaming headline about it the following day as a souvenir.

				I was at work, so we started draining the liquor cabinet while we waited for the building to evacuate us.<br />Luckily one of my coworkers was in from LA and she was staying at the W. She looked at me and was like-you are NOT walking back to Queens in those shoes. You&#039;re coming back with me and we&#039;re getting shitfaced.&nbsp; SOLD<br />Basically my coworkers used it as a staging ground to drink and figure out where they were going. One of my coworkers cheated on her husband that night with the man that later became her boyfriend (then ex boyfriend, ha! I hated her anyway). I drank untold 007s until I passed out in the hotel room on the couch. Apparantly, at some point in the middle of the night when my coworker came back I woke up, drank some more with her had a conversation that I don&#039;t remember. My first black out, during the black out, how nice.<br /><br />The next morning I remember hurting like hell, and threatening to throw a pop tart at Mandy Moore out the window (she and Andy Roddick were there. I was all let me throw a pop tart at the pop tart). In the end it would be a waste of a poptart. I ate it.<br /><br />Grabbed the 34 bus back into Queens and transferred to the 104 in Sunnyside. Once I saw the strip clubs in Queens Plaza were lit up, I knew we were back in business.<br /><br />My friend from LA however was trapped in NYC for another few days and the hotel didn&#039;t get power for a few days either.<br /><br />Good times.

				We blew most of the contents of our wine rack -- at the very least, a half case of very good French wine that I haven&#039;t been able to find since!<br /><br />I was on the 21st floor of a building on Madison and 51st.&nbsp; Thank goodness I wasn&#039;t in my regular office on the 46th floor a few blocks away (I evacuated from that office once, when there was a building fire shortly after September 11.&nbsp; Needless to say, I never want to walk down 46 flights of stairs again.)&nbsp; It only took me a couple of hours to get home -- someone walked with me as far as the Queensboro bridge, and once I got across I miraculously caught a Q19A at the foot of the bridge.&nbsp; The a/c on the bus wasn&#039;t working, and the person sitting next to me was complaining about it.&nbsp; I wanted to say, hey, you&#039;re on a bus, quit your kvetching!<br /><br />We hung out in our neighbour&#039;s backyard, our downstairs neighbour providing the guitar music and I providing the wine.&nbsp; We sang our way through song after song, lit by flickering candlelight.&nbsp; Around 10:00, headlights appeared around the corner of our house.&nbsp; After almost freaking out, we discovered it was my in-laws (who live on Long Island), who had endured a 4-hour car ride from their office in Lower Manhattan (fortunately, their friend drove a Geo -- good gas mileage!).<br /><br />Around 2am, we went out into the street and tilted our heads back, marvelling at the brightness of the moon and the plethora of stars.&nbsp; Everything was magically quiet - no a/c&#039;s humming or other background electrical noise we automatically internalise and don&#039;t even notice until it falls silent.<br /><br />We found beds for everyone, and after a fitful, hot sleep, woke up to fans whirring - the electricity had come on about 5:15.<br /><br />Friends of ours on the Upper East Side didn&#039;t get their electricity back for three days.&nbsp; They have a balcony, but they had trained their dog not to go on the balcony.&nbsp; So now, no matter what they did, she wouldn&#039;t go on the balcony.&nbsp; This meant that for three days, they had to walk the dog down and back up 21 flights of stairs, several times a day.

				Ack!&nbsp; That was not a fun blackout for me.&nbsp; I was working near Wall St. and when the power went out we had to all climb down 47 flights of stairs - I had Jello legs for a bit after that.&nbsp; And because I had no clue how to get back to my Astoria apt. near Ditmars (I was new to the neighborhood and didn&#039;t know my way around yet), I ended up spending the night at in the apartment of a woman who was the head of one of my company&#039;s departments.&nbsp; It was just a weird and awkward night because I didn&#039;t really know this woman all this well and we were staying in her in-the-city apartment that she didn&#039;t want me telling anybody about.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t sleep well.&nbsp; The next day I spent about 5 hours on buses trying to get back into Astoria.&nbsp; <br /><br />If I had that night to do again, I would have schlepped it over to a friends house and joined in on some blackout parties.

				I was living in Albany, NY and oddly enough--my block HAD power even though the most of the East Coast did not.&nbsp; Work was blacked out, so I didn&#039;t have to go there, so I stayed home with my AC on and watched the news about the blackout, which of course the people who needed the information did not get...<br /><br />Ha, it kind of sounds like the rest of you were having more fun than I was, though! :-D

				I was working in a hospital in the South Bronx.&nbsp; I was getting ready to leave when the power went out.&nbsp; I was just hanging out with another manager before it happened and I should have ran out of the building.&nbsp; Instead I was forced to stay and pull a double shift.&nbsp; Getting home....let me tell you.&nbsp; There is nothing scarier than driving down a pitch black 3rd Ave in the South Bronx and then over a pitch black Tri Boro Bridge.&nbsp; Went home and slept in a sweltering stuffy apt.&nbsp; Ah the memories.

				At that time I was working for the factory outlet division of a retailer, so my whole department was up in Woodbury Commons.&nbsp; We had finished a walk through at our store, and were shopping when everything started going haywire, alarms going off, lights flashing, the whole 9.&nbsp; So we jumped in the car and headed back to the office in NJ, listening to accounts of what was happening in NYC, myself politically incorrectly mimicking the stories we were hearing.<br />Once we got back to Jersey, and there was no power there either, the other guy who lived in NYC and myself got in his car that didn&#039;t have an air conditioner, and headed to the Holland Tunnel, as it was reportedly open.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t, so we turned around, headed north, to the Lincoln Tunnel, which was closed, and finally to the GWB, which opened as we were driving there.&nbsp; He lived on like 91st and York, so I got off there, and hoofed it back.&nbsp; About 6 blocks after I got out of his car, my ipod died, than a block later my phone died.<br />I walked over the 59th St Bridge, back home, all in the dark, somehow without even enough money in my pocket to buy a water.&nbsp; When I finally got home, I lit a bunch of IKEA tea lights that I had, took the coldest shower ever, which felt amazing, and then tried to get a hold of my friend who lived like 4 blocks away at the time.&nbsp; Having no cell phone, no buzzers, no nothing, I gave up after like 10 minutes, convinced he wasn&#039;t home (he wasn&#039;t, he was at his girlfriend&#039;s house).&nbsp; I had successfully scrounged up enough change to get a few hot dogs at Mano&#039;s Papaya, which was still serving food somehow, but when I got there they were closed.&nbsp; So I went home, ate a huge bowl of cereal and went to sleep.&nbsp; <br />I woke up to my alarm going off at like 5 AM when the power came back on, and later irate phone calls from my then girlfriend because my phone had died and she was worried.&nbsp;

				The power went out that afternoon and I thought it was just my motion sensor acting funny in my studio (Stony Brook University Music Department on Long Island).&nbsp; I was practicing and a lot of time I&#039;d be so focused on tiny movements that I wouldn&#039;t move the rest of my body much; therefore the lights would go out because the motion sensor didn&#039;t think anyone was in the room!<br /><br />So, I left my studio and walked out to the little stream and waterfall area to try to call my teacher Sally and I couldn&#039;t make any calls!&nbsp; She arrived and we decided just to skip our meeting and just go home.&nbsp; Sally drove me home (I lived a 5 minute drive from campus), and it took about 20 minutes instead of the 5.&nbsp; She got home ok.<br /><br />My two housemates got home and we were all &quot;well now what?&quot;.&nbsp; No internet, no TV, no stereo.&nbsp; We went across the street and bought some warming beer and a pound and a half of salmon - the fish guy sold it to us for way cheaper as he was trying to offload what he had.&nbsp; <br /><br />We wanted cold beer so we quickly pulled out ice packs from the freezer, put them in my gigantic 32qt stock pot and put the whole thing in my housemate&#039;s car and turned on the A/C!&nbsp; It didn&#039;t do much for cooling down the beer.<br /><br />We ended up spending time with our friends up the block who came down for the fish, and one of my housemates went to go fetch another friend who was a little ways away.&nbsp; We grilled the fish with sea salt, olive oil, and fresh herbs from the garden.&nbsp; We ate it with warmish beer.&nbsp; We listened to music blaring from my housemate&#039;s car.&nbsp; We just hung out with each other and it was a lot of fun!&nbsp; I remember how quiet it was, too. Lovely.<br /><br />A little before midnight, the power came back on.&nbsp; That was just about the time we all headed to bed.&nbsp; So, it worked out really well for us.&nbsp; I have fond memories of that blackout.

				That was some day. I was stuck in the neighborhood. Missed getting gas and going to a friends pool in Westchester by about an hour. $5 bucks in my pocket wandering 30th ave.&nbsp; Benny at Marino&#039;s fish gave me $100 when he heard my predicament and told me t pay him back when power returned.&nbsp; Spent some time at Avenue cafe sipping free beer and watching kids direct traffic by candle and flashlight.&nbsp; Actually a pretty cool night.&nbsp; I think power came back on 3 days later(?) Can that be right? Also two weeks before meeting a woman who is now my wife and due with our first baby any day now.&nbsp; So all in all, not a bad time.&nbsp; <br /><br />The one in 05&#039; really sucked. That heat was a killer.

				The Blackout was a memorable (positive) experience.&nbsp; As there were no electrical distractions, we (neighbors) came together as a whole.&nbsp; We chatted, shared food/drink........Shared!&nbsp; <br /><br />Everyone in my building (16 units) pulled together &amp; made the best of it.&nbsp; We had a party on the roof, played games, drank, ate EVERYTHING.&nbsp; We all camped out on the roof &amp; called it a night.&nbsp; <br /><br />Once the electric came back, everyone disappeared into the shadows of the electrical age. :mrgreen:

				I worked on Wall Street back then, our company exited thebuilding and then congregated at our emergency meeeting location at Bowling Green. It was decided that the non-essential staff can try to get home, and the rest of us went back to our building at Wall Street to wait on further developments. Around 6:30PM Gov. Pataki announced on the radio that it would take at least several hours to get the power back. I knew right then (as manager of my department) that there was nothing further that could be done that evening. Since my boss was on vacation, I had to report to the company&#039;s acting director (a worthless sack of s*** who has trouble making decisions and is horrible under stress). I informed him of my department&#039;s situation and what our options were. Yet, he still did not want me to leave to try to get home, and ordered me to stay put. The situation remained unchanged for the next 2 1/2 hours. At 9:00pm he then decided I was right, there was nothing further I could do, and gave me the okay to leave. At 9:00pm it was already dark of course, so I had to walk the 10-11 miles home to Astoria (and over the 59th Str Bridge) in the dark, I got home sometime after midnight. <br /><br />The next morning I had to find my way back to work since power returned to Wall Street around 6:00am. I took the bus from Steinway into Manhattan and then 4 more buses down to Houston Street, and I had to walk the rest of the way on foot. I got back home the same way that night. Next time I;m in an emergency situation and a superior gives me non-sensical order, I do what I think is best for me.

				Aah, the blackout.&nbsp; The memories.<br /><br />I was at work in the middle of doing a sensitive flash upgrade on our CEO&#039;s laptop that probably would have hosed it had the power gone out about 20 seconds earlier than it did.&nbsp; I finished it and just a few seconds later I heard someone down the hall say &quot;Hey, did the power just go out?&quot;&nbsp; I went into the server room (I work in IT) and all the backup batteries were bleeping at me letting me know we&#039;d switched to backup power.&nbsp; After we got some news that indicated this blackout wasn&#039;t going to be over anytime soon I shut the servers down one by one.&nbsp; Some people were listening to the radio freaking out and thinking it was a terrorist attack because it had hit the whole Northeast and then some.&nbsp; I just hung around until it became clear all we could do was make our respective ways home and I did just that.&nbsp; My little Swiss Army knife with the flashlight came in handy several times.&nbsp; <br /><br />It took about two hours to walk home to Astoria from my office near the Empire State Building and I was oh so glad to be wearing comfortable shoes that day.&nbsp; Email and web browsing worked on my cell phone so I used it to dash off a few messages to family while I still had juice and reception.&nbsp; The only kicker was that I managed to somehow lose my wallet on the way home.&nbsp; I think I may have dropped it when crossing the Queensboro Bridge.&nbsp; That was a serious drag.&nbsp; But I did make it home before sunset, which allowed me to take a shower and cook a quick dinner while it was still light.<br /><br />Lit some candles and tried to read a book but just passed out all sweaty.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t have anything exciting in the fridge or I would have scarfed it up -- during a later blackout I remember eating ice cream with my roommate by candlelight and that was kinda fun.&nbsp; One of my neighbors got up on the roof with all his beer and proceeded to get really hammered.&nbsp; He invited me up but I wasn&#039;t so sure I wanted to get wasted all the way up there - that might not have worked out so well when I had to get back down.<br /><br />I think I got a bike not long after the blackout so I could get back into the city even if transit was down.&nbsp; Nice to know that&#039;s always an option.&nbsp;

				I remember walking home across the Queensboro Bridge that evening. One vignette sticks in my mind.&nbsp; I passed a bar near Queens Plaza. The french windows at the front were wide open to the sidewalk, and a half dozen motorcycles were parked at the curb facing in, with headlights on, illuminating the inside.<br /><br />People were drinking and talking quietly inside, and a radio was playing low.&nbsp; A couple may have been slow-dancing on the sidewalk, but maybe I made that part up. They certainly should have been.

				man, i was working at this place in mid-town and our boss kept on insisting that it was just temporary and that the power would come back on. We were listening to the radio and after about an hour and a half we finally decided to stage a coup d&#039;état and said that if we were going to walk home, we needed to leave now, or else it was going to be dark.<br /><br />i ended up walking from 38th street over the williamsburg bridge deep into bushwick with my pregnant co-worker who was wearing really terrible shoes, and whose heels were bleeding by the time we stopped at my apartment, approximately 4 hours later.&nbsp; <br /><br />my building had a giant bbq on the roof with a bunch of tenants&#039; food and we sat around looking at the city (we had an amazing roof and view) and eating grilled meat and popsicles. it wasn&#039;t that bad after i got home, and my neighborhood was one of those that didn&#039;t have power for a few days.<br /><br />after i moved to Astoria the following year, and Astoria started having the blackouts, is when i decided to get renters insurance. my agent informed that if i&#039;d had it then, i could have gone to a nice, cool, air conditioned hotel room and they&#039;d have paid for it instead of my sitting at home during the brown/black out with my fan on &quot;low.&quot;&nbsp; ahhh, good times :)

				I liked the blackout. I worked nights at the time, and happened to have that day off. I was sleeping, and when all the electronics in the house simultaneously let out their death rattles, it woke me up. I was pissed at first cuz I thought my dad had blown a fuse. When I relaized the severity of the situation, I decided there was no point in sitting home, and I took off on foot to a building about 30 minutes walking away, cuz I knew most of the tenets. we hung out outside, ate ice cream, drank everything, played with reptiles and dogs and cats who were brought out to escape the heat inside, and at about 330am I started home on foot. The next day everyone told their stories to each other and it was fun. No one seemed to mind that there was a blackout. overall I had a good time.

				I was 21, and was working my summer vacation as a camp counselor in Long Island who also drove the kids home in a school bus. On my way home I noticed all the street lights were out, and there seemed to be panic everywhere. Just two years removed from 9/11 I was immediately worried about a terrorist attack. Once I got home I saw the power was off in my house, and when I called all my friends (on my cell) I saw all of their powers were down too.<br /><br />My parents had gone away to Ireland for the week and I couldnt get a hold of them, so I decided to invite everyone over for a candle-lit bbq. it was crazy because if you left my backyard it felt as though you were all alone in the woods; everything was so dark and quiet. But we made the best of it, and had beers, hot dogs, burgers, and more beers. By the time the blackout party was over it was 1am. I was crapping myself because I theoretically had work at 8am! Luckily I got a phone call at 7 saying the power was still out and camp was cancelled for the day. The power finally came back on that next evening, and one of the most memorable 24 hours of my life was over.<br /><br />-Andrew

				i was working out in garden city, long island.&nbsp; the computers blinked, then the lights and electricity stopped.&nbsp; we also wondered whether it was a terrorist thing (as 9/11 was still so recent).&nbsp; i just left work before anyone could say otherwise. mostly because we had left the a/c on for the dog. and with all the windows closed in the house, i didn&#039;t want my dog to suffer.&nbsp; all the street lights were out, so it was pretty chaotic until i could get on the grand central parkway.<br /><br />the hubby was actually underground in the trains, so had to walk out of the tunnel, and over the bridge with the rest of the masses -- for the second time in as many years. <br /><br />i think we ended up cooking what we could (thank goodness for gas stovetops, matches and the gas grill), put what we could in coolers with the contents of the icemaker, and ate out on our deck by candlelight.&nbsp; in that sense it was kinda nice.<br /><br />i don&#039;t remember all that much as it kinda blurs with the coned power outage.&nbsp; it&#039;s funny how that works.&nbsp; in the moment you feel as you are &quot;suffering&quot; so much, and then the power comes back and time passes, and you don&#039;t remember all the gory details.

				My mom was in town visiting and we were apartment hunting in the neighborhood.&nbsp; At first I remember being annoyed by the agents - &quot;what do you mean you can&#039;t show me the place? We don&#039;t need electricity to see an apartment!&quot; After a couple of canceled appointments we ended up at Cafe Bar drinking wine and eating the desserts they were giving away for free.&nbsp; <br /><br />It was a great afternoon.&nbsp; Both mom and I gotten slightly buzzed and I ended up telling her stuff that I&#039;d kept secret from my younger days.&nbsp; <br /><br />At night my landlady had left out candles so that we could find our way around the apartment.&nbsp; We were unable to sleep - so around 10pm we went out strolling on Steinway.&nbsp; Ate some food on the sidewalk outside Kebab Cafe.&nbsp; <br /><br />Earlier in the day, one of the real estate agents assured me that he had &quot;just the right apt for me&quot; and that I shouldn&#039;t make any decisions until we could get in to see it.&nbsp; He was right - I ended up in that place on 33rd St;&nbsp; &nbsp;just 3 blocks away from my future husband.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if the apartment had anything to do with us meeting.&nbsp; But I like to think the blackout had something to do with it. <br /><br />I&#039;m all for one or two nights a year (or more) when we all turn off the power and go out and enjoy the company. <br /><br /><br />

				I was at work in Harlem.&nbsp; When the power went out my boss said it was no big deal and the power would soon return, so why pay it any mind.&nbsp; But then I heard on my Walkman (didn&#039;t have Internet radio yet) that the power was off all over the Northeast and nearby parts of Canada, so I decided it was time to scoot and get home somehow.<br /><br />A number of coworkers felt the same way, and a bunch of us who lived in Queens or Brooklyn walked down to 125th St. to get the M60 bus if we were lucky, or cross the Triboro Bridge on foot if we weren&#039;t.&nbsp; When we got to 125th St., the M60 bus that came was jammed.&nbsp; Forget it, there was no way to get on it.&nbsp; So we walked east on the south side of 125th St.&nbsp; <br /><br />Then, when we got to 125th St. and 2nd Avenue, we got lucky.&nbsp; Amazingly lucky.&nbsp; An empty M60 bus pulled over and took us on.&nbsp; So not only did we get to ride to Queens, but we all got seats.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how the Brooklynites in our group got home, or how my boss made it home to the Bronx.&nbsp; Shame on me for not asking&nbsp; :oops:<br /><br />When I got to 30th Avenue, Jack&#039;s Bargain Stop was about to close, and there were crowds of people begging to get inside to buy flashlights and batteries.&nbsp; I had both, but the problem of supper still remained for me.&nbsp; I know that when the power is off, mild refrigeration still continues in the fridge, but only if the door is kept closed.&nbsp; So I could forget about anything in the fridge.&nbsp; I bought a shish kebab and a bottle of water from a street vendor, had the vendor wrap the kebab in foil, and ate it in my apt.&nbsp; (If I hadn&#039;t had that recourse, I suppose I could have opened a can of tuna or beans.)<br /><br />When I woke up the next morning, I turned on the lamp over my bed to see if the power had come back on.&nbsp; It had.&nbsp; But I took Mayor Bloomberg&#039;s advice and stayed home in Astoria.&nbsp; I assumed the milk in my fridge had spoiled, because milk has a dreadfully short shelf life in the summer, so I went to Michael&#039;s for my morning coffee.&nbsp; Whatever they had, milk or reconstituted powdered stuff, was fine.<br /><br />Thank you for the stories about the parties, the new apartment and the romance!

				I was moving to NYC! I had a big Ryder truck, and was driving through Pennsylvania on my way to Inwood (where I lived for about 10 months, before moving to Astoria). The radio started talking about a blackout in New York, and Canada, and maybe terrorists, and it was a little disturbing. But by the next morning, when I got into the city, the lights were on, traffic was really light over the GWB, and the parking ticket I eventually got was waived. So, aside from the adventure of taking the bus 100+ blocks from Upper Manhattan down to the UWS that evening, it actually made the whole ordeal easier!<br /><br />And now I&#039;ve been in NYC exactly 5 years...

				I happened to be home when the power went out.&nbsp; I had taken a few days off to do work around the apartment, and I was in the middle of assembling a file cabinet.&nbsp; I thought I had blown a fuse because I&#039;d been running the AC all day, but when I went into the halls I noticed all the lights were off.&nbsp; I went into the courtyard with my portable, battery-powered radio and listened to the news, and that&#039;s when I found out just how bad things were.&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember what I had for dinner--probably something I scrounged from the cabinets--and then I went to sleep pretty early.&nbsp; My power came back on around 5 AM.&nbsp; I&#039;d had a minor surgical procedure a couple of weeks earlier and I was due to get my stitches out that next day, but when I called the doctor&#039;s office no one answered, so I assumed they didn&#039;t have power yet.&nbsp; I had to live with those stitches for another week.

				Can&#039;t believe it&#039;s been 5 yrs already!&nbsp; I was working on the 7th floor of a bldg at 52nd and 6th in midtown.&nbsp; We sat in our office for about 10 minutes until we noticed that people were spilling into the street from the surrounding buildings, and we left.&nbsp; A group of about 15 of us headed out to a coworker&#039;s apt near Grand Central because she had a landline phone that we used to check in with our families.&nbsp; When we realized that the outage was going to last a while, I decided against trying to get back to Astoria and took up a friend&#039;s invite to stay at her place in Hell&#039;s Kitchen.&nbsp; We crossed through Times Square just after dusk, and it was simply surreal to see it dark.&nbsp; We also managed to stumble upon a pizza place selling fresh pies, so we bought one and then settled in a park across the street from her building.&nbsp; She brought the wine she had in fridge to drink with our pizza, and we befriended an elderly couple who was kind enough to share some homemade chocolate chip cookies with us.&nbsp; The wife was in a wheelchair, and without use of the elevator they were stranded downstairs.&nbsp; We chatted with them for a couple of hours before we went to sleep.&nbsp; The next morning a friend of a friend gave me a ride back to Astoria.&nbsp; <br /><br />Though it was definitely an inconvenience, once it became clear that it didn&#039;t occur due to a terrorist act, I wasn&#039;t too bothered by the blackout.&nbsp; To me it is one of those quintessential NY experiences that I will always be able to tell a good story about.&nbsp; On the other hand, you had to feel for all the business owners (restaurants, grocery stores, etc.) who were most affected by it.
