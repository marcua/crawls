				Boo, Labels.<br /><br />I&#039;m a student at sva (this was mentioned as hipster criteria in the other thread) who likes art and books and some indie music. But I also like Kelly Clarkson and Def Leppard (unironically, I might add) and The Real World on MTV and Rachael Ray. I find sarcasm and irony funny. I like the LES, but I also like wandering around shopping malls and my friends house in suburbia out on Long Island, even though, intellectually, its kind of depressing (Levittown!) I&#039;m a feminist, but I&#039;ll totally read Cosmo. Also, my parents are helping me out with tuition right now, but I&#039;m also living off savings and loans that I&#039;ll be paying until I&#039;m 45, and I&#039;m kind of freaking the [bleep!] out about how I&#039;m gonna pay the bills come May, although I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll figure something out. I wear jeans and tshirts most days, and while I wish I could afford to buy the entire inventory from Threadless (because, lets face it, they&#039;re hilarious), I&#039;m more of an Old Navy kinda girl (because, lets face it, they always have sales).<br /><br />So. Wtf am I?<br /><br />(For what its worth, I think anyone who tries to be whatever they want to be labeled as, whether it&#039;s a hipster or whatever, is just a giant freaking tool.)

				Über (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Cber) is a German preposition that basically means <em>over</em>, although it has a number of meanings when you translate it into English.&nbsp; It has come to mean <em>super</em>- in a lot of English contexts -- übermensch, for example, means superman.&nbsp; Ultra. <em>Uberhipster </em>would be an ultrahipster, for example, the kind that would fall over dead if they ventured into Astoria.

				I would say that Astoria&#039;s, if not teeming with, at the very least, riddled with hipsters. Just ride the N/W with your eyes open and try not to spit your coffee out. And this is coming from someone my wife jokingly describes as an &quot;aging hipster&quot; (though she may be borrowing the nomenclature from The Onion), i.e. someone old enough to be the parent of a &quot;Bills-burg&quot; hipster yet whose thrift store vibe is actually just really broken-in clothes he&#039;s owned for decades and whose vinyl record collection contains a high percentage of wax owned since childhood. And, yes, I despise them. IMHO, the only thing that saves Astoria from the throngs of would-be hipsters that swarm the L train is it&#039;s inconvenient distance from Williamsburg, the East Village and the LES, since those swaths of real estate are the hipster&#039;s spiritual epicenter. Let&#039;s just hope there&#039;s never a Southpaw/North Six/Warsaw in our parts. BTW, I saw Hank III at North Six and he shouted to the crowd at one point &quot;We&#039;re playing three shows in Brooklyn and NONE in Manhattan!&quot; as if that statement were somehow defiant. The poor guy thought he was being punk or something. He couldn&#039;t have picked a better representation of &quot;the establishment&quot; in which to play...<br /><br />Nevertheless, I&#039;m so ready for the BG to be written off as passe so that we can get back to enjoying it with out the 900+ Manhattanites wrapped around the block. (not that I have anything against Manhattanites--several of my friends are Manhattanites. In fact, I used to be one :lol:). Thankfully we have the Sparrow if the line&#039;s too long...<br />

				I&#039;m on the fence with the whole &quot;hipster&quot; label.&nbsp; In all honesty, many of my friends and myself, while walking down the street, based on appearance only, could be labelled as hipsters.&nbsp; What does it really mean?&nbsp; When I first heard the term, I was all too quick to join in with the chants of dislike toward this segment of society.&nbsp; But come on...&nbsp; When you get right down to it, any Caucasian in their early 20&#039;s to, in some cases, mid 40&#039;s walking down the street could be labelled as a hipster.&nbsp; But all of my friends work day jobs and in most cases are just scraping by in this city.&nbsp; They aren&#039;t funded by their parents.&nbsp; They are really cool people that care about the community they live in and try to contribute something to it.<br /><br />Of course I wouldn&#039;t label myself as a hipster, but who would?&nbsp; I&#039;m a jazz musician.&nbsp; Does that make me a hipster?&nbsp; My very good friend is a web designer who works from home in the East Village.&nbsp; Does that make him a hipster?&nbsp; How do you identify by appearance only which of these people are the rich spoiled brats you think they might be?<br /><br />Just remember that when you point a finger at someone else, you have three pointing back at yourself, and a thumb, but that just points off in some random direction most of the time.

				I would just say that yuppies (such as myself) are a different set of people from hipsters. There are plenty of yuppies in Astoria, which is it seems a big change from 20 years ago, but only a small number of hipsters. Part of being a hipster is about seeking out the &quot;newest&quot; and &quot;coolest&quot;. I really don&#039;t see many hipsters joining a crowd of 1000 for beer at a well-known drinking location. Yuppies, sure.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=5760.msg65461.html#msg65461">Quote from: Jtrane on March 30, 2007, 12:53:36 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Just remember that when you point a finger at someone else, you have three pointing back at yourself, and a thumb, but that just points off in some random direction most of the time.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Deeper, and truer, words were never spoken. :)<br />

				Thanks for the clarification, Harlan. I would like add to my previous post, however, that there does seems to be a yuppie/hipster convergence occurring that may be skewing my perception of the situation. Hipsters with careers? Yuppies with flair?

And I&#039;m not speaking of these people disparagingly - I have many good friends who I&#039;d define as wannabe hipster/late adopter. Not as cutting edge as the hipsters, but just as likely to go do something because they heard it&#039;s &quot;cool&quot;.<br /><br />And for the record, there are elements of me that are hipster-ish (I wear converse, listen to indie rock, and frequent East Village bars), but I wouldn&#039;t consider myself one (I hate Williamsburg and would NEVER live there, I watch Oprah and Greys Anatomy, I like John Mayer).<br /><br />PS - Labels suck. And if you ASKED a hipster, a true one would never admit to being one. (it&#039;s passe) :roll:

				I had to laugh when I read everyone&#039;s comments.&nbsp; I thought that all of you were hipsters!&nbsp; Sorry, I should have really learned the definition of the term before I assumed so.&nbsp; I was told a while back that &#039;hipsters&#039; were moving into Astoria.&nbsp; When I asked what a &#039;hipster&#039; was, the person pointed to some young people who were wearing Peruvian caps (you know, the ones with the braids on each side).&nbsp; Their clothes looked very thrift shop, large boots, etc.&nbsp; I am in my late 40&#039;s, so I was happy to see a new generation moving in.&nbsp; When I discovered this blog, I thought I was communicating with Hipsters!!!&nbsp; Sorry for the assumption everyone.&nbsp; And for the person who wrote that a Hipster would hate Astoria, I don&#039;t see why.&nbsp; What makes them better than anyone else?&nbsp; Yes, we do need a bookstore and less banks, but it is still a pretty nice place to live.

				Hmmm..........when I think of a hipster, the irony that comes to mind is how they&#039;re so pretentious in their non-pretentiousness. If that makes sense. <br /><br />Yuppies would wear the blingy symbols of their success; hipsters are too cool for the obvious labels. They&#039;d rather spend a lot of money on a hard-to-find retro collectable t-shirt than on Brooks Brothers.<br /><br />So I guess a hipster is a cross between a hippie and a yuppie. Somebody with the money and the brains but with different values (yuppie = steakhouse; hipster = Veggie Castle.)<br />

				If you guys want to see what hipsters look like in their scene and at their fullest, I am djing a party at the Luna Lounge in the &quot;billyburg&quot; next thursday night.&nbsp; www.babyinthecorner.org (ok i know shamless promo plug).<br />&nbsp;<br />I cant stand hipsters, there was this guy timothy who lived off metropolitan, he spoke with a weird high pitched voice that just made you want to barf, wore such tight jeans you could almost see his manhood, cowboy hat, and mismatched vintage clothing ala &quot;bobs bowling lanes t-shirts&quot; and the like, and either some allstar vans or weird white leather shoes.&nbsp; He was vegetarian, did not regard anything as cool unless it was on Time Out NY, listened to indie rock, and lived in a discombavulated loft with a bunch of other hipsters who were just as cool and they liked to walk down bedford shouting &quot;ironic&quot; things.&nbsp; He was from Kansas and his favorite band was Os Mutantes.

				<br />If a hipster thinks your hip, what does that make you?&nbsp; and if you can&#039;t stand them, why DJ for them?&nbsp; If your answer is &quot;for money&quot; I can totally dig that, but you shouldn&#039;t go around dissin&#039; your audience.

				Actually I am djing this gig for free to raise money for the Willie Mae Rock camp for girls.&nbsp; You are right though I should not dis those that I do not know.&nbsp; &nbsp;My audience is actually not a hipster crowd at all since I dont normally play for that scene, but the Brooklyn Art Blast is for a cause www.williemaerockcamp.org<br /><br />Its funny though because a friend said that we would be considered by some as hipsters probably and i was totally appalled.&nbsp; Especially because for one, I am not white, and when I think of hipsters I think of white kids from the midwest that move to NYC to live as starving artists or trying to find themselves while getting money to pay their rent from mom and dad every month.&nbsp; Though to be fair I have met some cool hipsters in the past, but the type above that i described is really the type that I cannot stand.

				Well.....I hate to say it but the music was funky disco type songs at PS1 when I went, and none that I nor my group had ever heard of before.&nbsp; Maybe I just don&#039;t like that type of music.&nbsp; I would have preferred old school hip hop, disco from the 70s that I&#039;d heard of, 80&#039;s, house, or rock.&nbsp; It&#039;s ok, just my opinion.&nbsp; Certainly did not fit in with the crowd.

				Ha ha! They&#039;ve had heavy metal and indie rock bands too. They had this really weird noise experimental group that wasn&#039;t my thing, but it was fun. They&#039;ve had all kinds of stuff. It&#039;s best to check the bands out on the &#039;net first.

				The music at PS1 this year was the worst in all of the previous years, between booking random bands, to unknown but apparently well connected crappy djs, except for Ursula 1000 who rocked!&nbsp; The PS1 dance crowd I would say is not really a &quot;hipster&quot; audience even if they might look like it, they are house heads because that&#039;s what it started as, a party where you can hear awesome electronic music, mainly house and people that want to dance.&nbsp; But that changed somewhat this year and yes there may be a higher hipster contingent there.<br /><br />I think it should stay the way it was before, given that there are not many places, especially outdoor ones where you can dance to electronic music with wild abandon as you can there.&nbsp; Long live HOUSE MUSIC!&nbsp; Any househeads in this board?&nbsp; Btw, house heads are NOT usually hipsters.&nbsp; When I think of hipster music preferences, I think of ironic indie rock bands, emo, maybe punk/ska, 80s/new wave, etc.&nbsp; They usually dont like much underground electronic music because Djs to them are not as &quot;cool&quot; as bands.&nbsp; <br /><br />

I disagree with your 80&#039;s, new wave, punk comment. Definitely not hipster music. Not that I have a problem with hipsters or what type of music they like. At this point old new wave, 80&#039;s and punk etc is like oldies/classic rock music-its been a round a long time. <br /><br />

				urris all kinds of people like new wave, hey music is music.&nbsp; I would not put all new wave and classic rock in an &quot;oldies&quot; category, 50s, doo wop and the like are &quot;oldies.&quot;&nbsp; There is a lot of rock and new wave that would fall under &quot;classic&quot; because its from 20 or 30 years ago yet some gems people still have not yet heard and you would not recognize.<br />

				a hipster is term used about those who aspire to unique forms of expression.&nbsp; irony being what it is, the concept is exceptionally ironic and sad in that hipsters tend to collect in groups and aspire to the SAME forms of unique expression.&nbsp; one could call it a movement (akin to an art movement of yesteryear - dada, expressionism) yet the hipster ethic does not necessarily include expression of artistic desire but rather can be limited to the conspicuous consumption of culture as a form of expression.<br /><br />i would venture to say that those who are hipsters now would have been punks in the 80&#039;s after the clash rocked the casbah or grunge kids in the 90&#039;s after pearl jam&#039;s second album or neo punk kids in the late 90&#039;s after dookie went platinum.&nbsp; the truth is that there were few people in williamsburg, dumbo, LES etc who were making art and having a great time doing it and people jumped on the scene like new met fans in the mid 80&#039;s. <br /><br />it is not the artistic who make hipster out to be a bad thing but the second wave of hangers-on that bring the concept to its knees.<br /><br />as a disclaimer - i hung in the les in 1988, move to avenue c in 1992, worked in williamsburg in 1993, moved my studio to dumbo and my living situation to red hook in 1995 and now i am in gowanus.&nbsp; i may not be artistic enough to call myself a hipster or part of the vanguard that makes a scene great but i have seen a number of changes that help me understand that the conception is not all bad, it is the successive waves that make is smell.<br /><br />hipsters are the modern hippies. some live the ethic and some just appear to.

				<br />at least this was fun reading<br /><br />&quot;<br />Well, see the thing is this…Williamsburg hipsters are able to contemplate the dystopian yet ironic nature of wandering under overpasses and measuring lives in PBR can tabs. Their grimy streets and hidden bars reflect a deeper, more fully realized sense of being in Berlin. Which, of course, they are not. Mostly because they are too afraid. The Manhattan hipster, on the other hand, enjoys spending his/her (went to Wesleyan, didn&#039;t like it) money as an act of rebellion, of burning one&#039;s entitlement in the fires of vodka and ironic tea cups. The two may fly the same flag, but these are houses divided. Divided by sad nuances and wobbly rent checks, the glorious roll of Beford vs. the cricket-free hum of Rivington.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to kill myself now. <br />&quot;

				After reading all of these posts, I went on a mission around Astoria to see what sort of hipster population we actually have -- the results were surprising.&nbsp; I started my walk on Ditmars -- now in my head I figured I would find hipsters on 30th ave, or down towards the movie theater -- low and behold, I spotted a hipster couple leaving their apartment building right of of Ditmars.&nbsp; It took me all of 30 seconds to find a hipster (2 in fact) -- here is how I classified them.&nbsp; HIM:&nbsp; longer hair (not too long) sort of messy, but obviously worked on to get the look, wearing a &quot;miller time&quot; t-shirt, army type shorts (frayed at the bottom of course), horizontal multicolored&nbsp; socks and whatever shoes that hipsters wear, OH and can&#039;t forget the oversized paris hiton shades.&nbsp; HER:&nbsp; very faded jeans, looks like they came from salvation army but I bet they cost over $100, a tank top (normal), and similar socks and shoes as her beau, she was wearing the quintessensial hipster eyewear -- the thin black rimmed glasses that may or may not have been prescription.&nbsp; I decided to do some recon -- I followed them as they made there way down Ditmars, swinging a left on 29th and heading straight to Freeze peach.&nbsp; I decided to investigate further and entered freeze peach -- Hipster HQ -- wow, I must have had my eyes closed for the past few years -- as I strolled down to the park and back there were hipsters everywhere -- Waltz, Fatty&#039;s, Oleput, Brooklyn Bagel -- I never knew.&nbsp; Oh well.

				Astoria def has a large population of them, but the Billyburg hipster is a totally different breed. They are like those silver gorillas in that movie &quot;Congo&quot;.....They think they are so smart, but they are really just a-holes, if that makes any sense.
