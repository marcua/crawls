			i am still looking for interested readers to start something like a bookclub... except easier... no homework.<br /><br /><br /><br />it would look like this:<br /><br /><br /><br />you are sitting with a diverse group of people (various backgrounds, ages, etc...) someone holds a book and reads...<br /><br /><br /><br />maybe they are reading 'two paths diverged in a wood' and it sounds like 'too passu diverugoo in a woodoo' because the person grew up speaking japanese... or something.<br /><br /><br /><br />then<br /><br /><br /><br />the book gets passed to someone else and they pick up where the first person left off. easy. the book goes around and around and we take turns reading. &nbsp;thats it.<br /><br /><br /><br />it wouldnt have to be robert frost neccessarily, either. &nbsp;anything would do. we could bring our kids and read fairy tales, even, if that is what people wanted to do.<br /><br /><br /><br />anyway<br /><br /><br /><br />thought i would throw this out there again...<br /><br /><br /><br />ff

			I was once stuck on a train in a tunnel during the Christmas holidays with a group of crying school kids. Somebody had Charles Dickens &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; which got passed around to anyone willing to read it as each reader started to go hoarse. The train got moving about half way through and some people actually seemed upset that they were not going to hear the end. One woman said...&quot; I've only seen the movie! &quot;
