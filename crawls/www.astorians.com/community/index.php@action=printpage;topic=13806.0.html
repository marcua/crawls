				Moved this from the looking for section......<br /><br />My wife is about to pop our first kid out next month and I was hoping someone might have a recommendation for a good pediatrician in Astoria. We are located at 34th Ave / 21st St area, ideally the closer the better. Any help is greatly appreciated- thank you!!!

				There&#039;s a clinic affiliated with Presbyterian Hospital on 21st Street and 36th Ave. I don&#039;t know the exact name of it, but it&#039;s great. We have been using it for a while and the doctors there are the best.

				I&#039;m due to give birth any day now and, when interviewing pediatricians, found one that I liked very much on 31st St close to the Ditmars Blvd stop (I forget the cross st). His name is Dr. Apostolis Tsoumpariotis - just opened his office there a little over a month ago. He&#039;s not entirely holistic but was very open to working with me re: vaccines. I also liked that he supported me raising my son as a vegetarian. I&#039;m also planning a home birth and he said, for the first baby&#039;s visit, he would come to my house which is fantastic and rare. His #: 718.932.6300

				My son is 3 months old and we just love Dr. Markouizos with Pediatric Healthcare of Queens. We mainly see Dr. Nikolas Papaevagelou.&nbsp; <br />Their current office is at 27-47 Crescent Street however they are building a new office closer to Ditmars and 37th Street.&nbsp; Phone number is 718-278-5900.

				We ended up going with Dr. Bloom, as the location and office hours were most convenient for us. Had our first appointment with the baby today, and it went great. thanks for the help, everyone!
