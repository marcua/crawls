				now hold on a moment merm.....how well can you belly dance nymac?&nbsp; <br /><br />just messing<br /><br />guy&#39;s pretty cool, young licensed electrician named Ellia (718) 312-2838.....found him through this add on craigslist: http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/hss/174941200.html<br /><br />turns out we&#39;d kind of seen each other in the neighborhood before and after that the whole Greek kinship thing took over.......<br /><br />these South Euro ethnic groups tend to instinctively and out of cultural reflex give each other a break at the slightest hint of friendliness........so keep it as informal as possible offer some condiments and tell him Dimitri sent you (but try pronouncing it <br />Thee-mitri :wink:)...
