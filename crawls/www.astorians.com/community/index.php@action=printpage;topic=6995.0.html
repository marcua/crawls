				Hello.<br />I&#039;m interested in finding private pilates sessions. I&#039;m a beginner. I know there&#039;s a &quot;studio&quot; at Synergy on Broadway, which I&#039;m a member of, which I think seems antithetical to a good pilates environment. And I know they offer something private at The Yoga Room on Steinway, as well as group sessions on a mat. <br />I&#039;m just off 30th Avenue, near 29th Street. <br />If you know of these or any other people/places, including private enterprise (no funny stuff!), I&#039;d like to know what&#039;s in the neighborhood, including prices, if you have any.<br />Thank you. :mrgreen:<br />Michael <br />

				I belong to The Rock, over at Ditmars. They&#039;re offering private pilates and yoga sessions for members,<br />but I would think that non-members could probably also schedule sessions since the trainers there have clients<br />who are members and non-members. They would probably just have to find a space to work with you <br />since Synergy probably wouldn&#039;t allow a trainer from another gym on the premises.<br /><br />Your options are limited in Astoria. If you really want excellent pilates private instruction, I recommend<br />Power Pilates on West 23rd between 5th &amp; 6th Aves. Website is www.powerpilates.com. <br /><br />They have a great intro package where you get a private class, a mat class and a massage for, I think, around<br />$130&nbsp; -- check the site for that.<br /><br />They also do private and semi-private classes where you bring a couple of people for a small, intimate group and<br />it saves you $$.<br /><br />PP is great - I go there in addition to my classes at the Rock. <br /><br />You also mentioned the Yoga Room. I think that one of the instructors at the Rock may teach there too and if so,<br />she&#039;s wonderful. <br /><br />Good luck.<br />

				Unfortunately, I don&#039;t know about Astoria, but there&#039;s a great studio on Bleecker and Mott called Re:Ab.&nbsp; My friend teaches there and she is great! Her name is Bettina, if interested.&nbsp; Very nice studio with great showers and great teachers.&nbsp; I think it might be on kind of the expensive side, but they do teach authentic pilates...i.e. the program and equipment set up by Mr. Pilates himself.&nbsp; reabnyc.com&nbsp; Oh, also they have an apprentice program where you can get free private lessons!&nbsp;

				Hi There,<br /><br />I am a certified pilates instructor.&nbsp; I have extensive experience and training in injury prevention, pre and post natal pilates, myofascial release, as well as yoga and strength/circuit training.&nbsp; I&#039;ve worked at several studios around the city. I&#039;ve recently had a baby and decided to shift all of my work to Astoria, since I live in the neighborhood.&nbsp; I teach privates sessions on the equipment in a space that&#039;s near the Broadway stop on the N/Q or the Steinway Stop on the R train.&nbsp; If you are interested in private sessions, I&#039;d love to speak with you and give you more information.<br /><br />Warmly,<br /><br />Josie Bray

				Also check out Tone Pilates, which is on 37th Street between Broadway &amp; 31st Avenue.<br /><br /><br />Tone has mat and reformer classes as well Surf Set too.<br /><br /><br />They also take private clients - the website is www.toneny.com<br /><br /><br />You&#039;ll see the menu there&nbsp; - you can inquire about private instruction with either of the two owners or the instructors.<br /><br /><br />They&#039;re all excellent - Tone has over a dozen five-star reviews on Yelp.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve been taking advanced mat classes there for a year and love it.<br /><br />
