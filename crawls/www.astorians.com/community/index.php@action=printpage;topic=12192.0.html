				I&#039;m looking for a good tailor.&nbsp; I have a couple of favorite (men&#039;s) shirts that I would like to have the sleeves taken up.&nbsp; Most typical tailors will just take it up from the cuff.&nbsp; A good tailor will take it up at the shoulder area, thereby preserving the cuff openings.&nbsp; This requires taking the sleeves off the shirt and reattaching them after the excess length is removed.&nbsp; Of course, it requires more expertise--but not that much more difficult from, say, hemming some pants.&nbsp; Obviously, I&#039;d be willing to pay a more for a good tailor.&nbsp; So, what say ye, expert Astorians?

				I just went to GVD cleaners on 23rd Ave and 33rd Street and had a very good experience - the job was done same day (which I didn&#039;t request) and the woman there was very friendly. The tailor there is Jack, who had a good reputation on this board and previously worked at a place on Ditmars. I had pants hemmed, so I don&#039;t know how they work with men&#039;s shirts, but it&#039;s worth asking if they do that if no one here knows.

				I&#039;ll also put in a vote for Jack at GVD cleaners on 23rd Ave. and 33rd St.&nbsp; He recently altered a suit for my husband.&nbsp; He had to make significant changes to it (sleeves shortened, back narrowed, buttons moved, pants hemmed and let out).&nbsp; It looks great, and he tailored the suit jacket properly by taking it up at the shoulders.

				I&#039;m seconding San Remo.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had pants shortened and altered.&nbsp; Jacket sleeves shortened.&nbsp; They even mended a cloth purse for me.&nbsp; All done quickly, inexpensively and right.&nbsp; My sister comes from Manhattan to have her alterations done there.

				Thanks for reporting back 23rdSt.&nbsp; Let us know what you think of the workmanship.&nbsp; I have always been happy with them and if I ever did not like something they were always happy to listen and redo as necessary.<br /><br />As for the exchange your gf heard, hilarious.&nbsp; Those guys are not shy.

				I got my shirts back a few days ago.&nbsp; The workmanship was pretty good.&nbsp; He couldn&#039;t replicate the machine stitchings, but nevertheless the work looks clean and secure--like from the hands of an old school tailor.&nbsp; I&#039;ll definitely bring more things there in the future.&nbsp; Thanks all for the recommendation.
