				Thanks for posting this. I&#39;m one of those crazy people that actually gets a kick out of street fairs. My favorite thing about them is that you get to eat bad food that seems to mysteriously not exist outside of the realm of street fairs, i.e. zeppoles, mozzareppa, pickles on a stick, fried Oreos, etc.

				Wernham, I am totally with you on that. I love street fairs. It&#39;s not summer without that kind of food and atmosphere.

				Thanks for the heads-up! I am a rabid fan of street-fairs (love those athletic socks they sell-- 3 pairs for $2!) and of course the fooooood... can&#39;t wait for those sticks of meaty grilled goodness! See you there!<br /><br />

				Thanks for the info! Is it me, or is there another Ditmars street fair? Maybe different organizers? I seem to recall one in the early summer and another in the early autumn...<br /><br />Maybe I&#39;m thinking of the &quot;tchotcke&quot; fair that sometimes happens on 31st Street between Ditmars and 21st Ave...

				WOW, Astoria has a lot of street fairs.&nbsp; The BOCOCA area only has a couple per year.&nbsp; This is more like Chicago, where you can&#39;t walk two blocks in the summer without hitting a street fair.<br /><br />The problem I have with these street fairs is that they are all.&nbsp; exactly.&nbsp; the.&nbsp; same.

				<strong>Memorial Day Street Fair Show:</strong><br />&nbsp;I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s another year gone by but it&#39;s time to start planning for an even bigger show then last year!!! For those of you that don&#39;t know about the fair well, it&#39;s quite simple. They close off all of Broadway from Crescent Street to Steinway and thousands of people come and hang out with us as we perform for everyone on a outdoor stage with an outdoor bar , in front of <strong>The Broadway Station </strong> (Broadway &amp; 31 Street 718.545.5869) need I say anymore. If anyone is interested in performing please e-mail me Richard at starlite1karaoke@aol.com &nbsp;. Last years show<br />was filmed for public television and will be filmed again this year. I can already say that our good friends Tosser www.tossermusic.net (http://www.tossermusic.net) will be in the line-up this year as well as our $3000.00 Karaoke Contest winner from Doyles Corner, Krissy Rivera. Last year&#39;s show stealer The Getaway Drive www.thegetawaydrive.com (http://www.thegetawaydrive.com) has also signed on again as well as Starlite Karaoke&#39;s own Dani Rhodes, Amy Allensworth and Meghen Farrell...<br />I am expecting all the usual suspects will join up this year to make it the most fantastic show of all!!!<br />
