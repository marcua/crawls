				I&#039;m not a big fan of seafood, but I went to Elias Corner on 31st Street and 24th Avenue (across the street from the Beer Garden) and I was impressed!&nbsp; A group of my friends sat outside on the patio and relaxed in the early evening sun, while watching all of the folks trying to get into the Beer Garden.&nbsp; The prices are really good for what you get and the service, at least for our group, was really good.&nbsp; I attached a thread regarding the place<br /><br />http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=432.0<br /><br />Again, I&#039;m not an expert on seafood, so there are probably more informed reviews, but I liked the place and I think I&#039;ll go back soon!

				Go to Kylcades on Ditmars and 35th! Its excellent, Elias is also good but i prefer Kyclades.<br />Get there early, they don&#039;t take reservations and the wait can be long.<br /><br />

				I second Elias.&nbsp; I love the fact that their menu is as simple as &quot;what kind of fish do you want?&quot; &quot;Tilapia? Okay, here is your grilled Tilapia&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;ve never been to Kyclades but have always wanted to go.&nbsp; Everytime I pass there, its packed.<br /><br />So, I say, give Kyclades a shot for me.<br /><br />
