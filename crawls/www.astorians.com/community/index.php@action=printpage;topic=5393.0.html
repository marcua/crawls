				I&#039;ve been reading his column for years.&nbsp; Dan Savage held a contest to redefine the word &quot;Santorum&quot;, and that is what some awesome reader came up with.&nbsp; I no longer can say <em>santorum</em> without thinking of its new meaning.&nbsp; Thus making Santorum a laughing stock.&nbsp; If you google santorum, guess what are the first few hits?&nbsp; And who is responsible?&nbsp; All Savage&#039;s readers, who promoted the use of this term.&nbsp; It&#039;s been in use for a good 3 years now.&nbsp; http://www.spreadingsantorum.com/<br /><br />quote:<br /><br />There&#039;s no better way to memorialize the Santorum scandal than by attaching his name to a sex act that would make his big, white teeth fall out of his big, empty head.

				I remember Savage coming up with this a few years ago! Like Daisy, I no longer think of Rick when I hear the word &quot;santorum&quot;.<br /><br />I heard Savage speak at a Unitarian Universalist event a few years ago. I emailed him afterward and he emailed me back!

				It&#039;s one of my pet peeves.&nbsp; No offense but if I can&#039;t understand why someone negative nodded someone else, and no reason is given, I do positive nod it back up.

				I also realize TRX was being tongue-in-cheek.&nbsp; <br /><br />I really disagree with this approach to the nods.&nbsp; I will preface the following with the caveat that this is my observation and opinion of the act of nodding and I am not aiming to personally attack daisy the person; I apologize in advance if it comes off that way.&nbsp; I am also NOT speaking as a moderator here, nor do I represent any of the moderators with my statements. <br /><br />What I don&#039;t like is the use of positive nodding as a reaction to not understanding the negative nod itself, rather than positive nodding based on one&#039;s own opinion about the subject/conversation at hand.&nbsp; I find this kind of approach be be rather arrogant and completely against the point of using nods constructively.&nbsp; To me, it&#039;s as bad as negative nodding someone because you don&#039;t like them.&nbsp; Assuming a negative nod contains malicious intent is certainly thinking the worst of things and the people involved with the thread.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think that&#039;s what sticks in my craw the most - automatically assuming a negative nod is a personal attack; that gives no benefit of the doubt and does not contribute to the community in a positive way whatsoever.<br /><br />When I see people reacting to something because they don&#039;t or can&#039;t understand it, it troubles me.

				I often notice people wondering aloud on this board why they got a negative nod, and I often wonder too.&nbsp; Reasons aren&#039;t always given, and I like to see further discussion on topics, rather than neg nods.&nbsp; I certainly don&#039;t police the negative nods (who has time for that?&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; )&nbsp; I can understand why you would see it that way, and that&#039;s cool.&nbsp; Everyone has their own opinion, and I don&#039;t really want to get so off topic with this.&nbsp; Everyone has their own reasons for using them,&nbsp; or not using them.&nbsp; Maybe I should have just stuck to my first decision, which is not to use them whatsoever.&nbsp; But no biggie either way.&nbsp; <br /><br />Let&#039;s get back to Santorum.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)

				I think this is brilliant, however graphic it may be. What better way to make a point and bring revenge than by making your name associated with one of the groups you rail against?<br /><br />I wonder if this will spark a trend in vocabularizing, verbing, or nouning names of celebrities, politicians, etc...
