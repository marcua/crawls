			It&#039;s time for an Astoria Spring. <br />Let&#039;s form a committee to finally dislodge the professional political dynasty that is helping to turn a once-charming neighorhood into a trendy slum.<br />Let&#039;s start with Vallone Jr., who reportedly has nearly a million dollars in his campaign war chest to run for Borough President, most of it from real-estate developers and other self-interested miscreants. <br />We can start by putting together a series of narratives,&nbsp; snapshots, photos, videos, etc. of what the quality of&nbsp; life is really like in the district where the chair of the Public Safety Committee of the NYC Council supposedly resides. (The evidence suggests that he lives far away from the borough.) <br />Send me your ideas.

			Unless the Mayor decides he wants a fourth term, we will not have Vallone to kick around anymore. And since we just elected two brand new members to the State legislature and rest of the ladder up is pretty secure and not going anywhere, I can&#039;t imagine him moving up. <br /><br /><br />Mself, I hope Costa runs when the City Council seat opens up. In fact, I should get off my lazy ass and head to the Powahatan Club one day.

			Vallone and his family have done a huge amount of good for Astoria.&nbsp; Why would you want to vote out someone with so much clout in City government?

			I second that notion. Please give a detailed list with verifable sources as to what this man has accomplished aside from plastering his name on anything that stands still, allowing the historic structures of Astoria to be razed to the ground for ugly mass structures that pack in too many residents for our infrastructure. Please tell us what he has done to fight the litter issue (please see the fresh berry farm link in the general boards) and plase explain why his &quot;fast and furious noise pollution&quot; passed in 2004 has yet to curb the noise pollution of drag racing in this neighborhood. Please explain the rise in crime specifically last year where we had 5 murders in Astoria. <br />&nbsp;<br />It is time for the Vallone dynasty to be overturned. He serves the seniors and only the seniors...i.e his voting base. Loverly folks those astoria seniors, but they are not the only ones who live here.
