				As an alumna, I&#39;m really saddened but actually not surprised (even more tragically) by this news that one of our country&#39;s greatest bastions of higher public education (the UCs in general) is falling prey to the purveyors of fear and anti-dissent. West LA is definately no Dover, PA but it still has its share of pesky of bible-thumpers. And because its Westwood Village (highest percentage of movie-theatre premieres in the metro area), these right-wing fascists are probably pretty savvy. Everything in that town&#39;s got a high gloss and for those unwitting few, I&#39;m sad to say that this &quot;open bounty on intellectuals&quot; might seem kosher. I just have to hope that the majority of students will investigate just alittle bit and find that this organization is not actually affiliated with UCLA in any way and thus is doing nothing more than bringing shame and embarassment to the university through its narrow-minded views. More likely: most college students won&#39;t care too much.

				Here&#39;s what I got in my monthly alumni e-mail thingy. To set the record straight. These right-wing losers are making some bad press.<br /><br />Unaffiliated Alumni Group Goes After Professors<br /><br />A small, independent alumni group formed to attack &quot;radicalism&quot; at UCLA is calling itself the “Bruin Alumni Association”. This group is not affiliated with the campus or the UCLA Alumni Association. In fact, several months ago, UCLA required that the group add disclaimer language to its Web site and solicitation materials.<br /><br />In recent days, this group has distributed a student solicitation offering to pay students to provide it with copies of recorded lectures from a target list of faculty. Students may not, however, do this without the approval of the faculty member and the Chancellor, or they will be in violation of campus policy. Our campus counsel is responding to this latest development, as well, and we are communicating with students, so they are aware of the policies.<br /><br />It is important to note, however, that while UCLA has and will continue to be aggressive with this and any other group that misrepresents its relationship to the campus or otherwise encourages students to violate campus policies, this group is within its rights to communicate its point of view. <br /><br />For its part, the University focuses its efforts on encouraging a campus culture that allows for vigorous debate and the consideration of various points of view, but within a culture that embraces the values of tolerance, civility and respect. We will continue our efforts in this area, and hold ourselves to this standard, even as others may not always choose to embrace similar principles.<br /><br />The UCLA Alumni Association is a volunteer-driven organization comprising more than 84,000 alumni and friends of UCLA and serving the larger community of nearly 350,000 living alumni. Founded in 1934, the Association has a diverse and rich history of bringing alumni together to support the University, its students and each other.<br />
