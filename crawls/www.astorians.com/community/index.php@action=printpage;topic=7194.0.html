				Folks - I am extremely confused about all the negative and deragatory comments I&#039;ve read regarding Astoria&#039;s cafes.&nbsp; For those of you who have recently moved into the area, this was at one time a community made up of European immigrants.&nbsp; If you go to France, Spain, Austria, Greece, Italy etc. you will notice that there are many cafes where people meet, chat, read papers, drink great coffee etc.&nbsp; Perhaps this is the equivalent of American Bars?&nbsp; Anyway, cafes have been here for years.&nbsp; They may have changed hands over time, and certainly there are more of them now, but to many of us they add a certain European flair to our neighborhood.&nbsp; I am not sure what you would rather have replace the cafes.&nbsp; Perhaps Starbucks?&nbsp; or Denny&#039;s? or Burger Kings? or MacDonalds? or Chili&#039;s?&nbsp; or any fast food chain that you find all over Americas suburbs?&nbsp; I remember one Sunday, my husband and I had to go to New Jersey for a Memorial Service.&nbsp; We were early and wanted to stop somewhere for a coffee.&nbsp; There was no where to go.&nbsp; Everything was closed except for one Diner with really bad coffee.&nbsp; Why all the disdain?&nbsp; These cafes are doing well, many are crowded with young and old, seemingly enjoying themselves.&nbsp; I would really like to know why all the disdain?&nbsp;

				Count me as one who loves the cafes as well-- it&#039;s one of the main reasons I moved to Astoria-- I love that people are out and about at all hours.&nbsp; Athens cafe is open till when-- 4 am?&nbsp; I have never had a negative experience at any of them-- it&#039;s really the only place in NYC that has such a concentration of these types of establishments- a place where you can get a coffee, frappe, glass of wine, a salad, dessert, and sit for as long as you desire.<br /><br />I too have been confused by all the complaining about new ones opening.&nbsp; If I were to open a business on 30th ave-- it would be a cafe-- you cant even get in to Avenue or Grand Cafe on the weekends!

There seems to be some sort of anger regarding these cafe&#039;s. Yes, the music is a little louder in some, and you do have a variety of languages that you hear in the various cafe&#039;s. I can&#039;t help but wonder if that might be it a little, but not sure. Maybe a coffee is a little more expensive, but you are also paying for sitting at a side-walk cafe and enjoying the people-watching and waiter service. <br /><br />Myself, if I have work to do, reading, etc., I choose to got to a quieter cafe, that tends to be non-euro (Waltz, freeze, Oleput, Himalayan tea house) but I don&#039;t understand the disdain that euro cafe&#039;s seem to garner on the board with words like &quot;euro-trash&quot;. Thanks for the post.

				I rarely frequent the cafes on 30th Ave, but I have no problem with them.&nbsp; If I lived closer to 30th Ave, I bet I&#039;d spend more time there.&nbsp; Whenever I have been to one, it&#039;s been a fine experience.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s great you can go there and spend lengthy time sitting and drinking coffee/frappe/whatever - that&#039;s what I was used to living in Berkeley (where on some blocks there are 3 cafes!).&nbsp; I&#039;m glad there are cafes of all sorts in Astoria to meet most everyone&#039;s needs.&nbsp; <br /><br />P.S. positive nods to the three of you, too.

				Having lived in Europe for four years (Italy &amp; Spain) I have a very positive view of the sidewalk cafes on 30th -- a wonderful way to wile away the time chatting with friends and observing people.&nbsp; My only complaint, and it is slight, is that the quality of the food is usually not that great (please disprove me!), and it would be nice to see a few really good, non-sidewalk restaurants on 30th to balance things out.&nbsp; Or a sidewalk restaurant that provides a really good dining experience would be fine as well.&nbsp;

				Thank you Debbie.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always wondered this exact thing myself, just where is all the anti-Greek cafe sentiment coming from?&nbsp; I&#039;ve noticed it in comments on this board for years, and was beginning to think I was the only one who actually likes the cafes and frequents them.&nbsp; I even enjoy the music.&nbsp; Occasionally, I speak favorably of the cafes but always felt like I was in the minority. I&#039;m glad to know that is not the case.&nbsp; I&#039;m not Greek, nor do I feel as if I have to dress a certain way in order to enjoy myself at these establishments.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always felt very welcome.&nbsp; I realize they are not everyone&#039;s cup of tea, but I&#039;ve read multiple comments such as &quot;Euro-trash&quot; and others, dissing the music, the cafes themselves, 30th Avenue in general, and the people who sit in them.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived in Astoria for almost a decade now.&nbsp; Those cafes are part of the European feel that I love so much here.&nbsp; These cafes are popular, otherwise they wouldn&#039;t be packed all the time.&nbsp; Astoria is very European, always has been. I would like to know too, why all the disdain?

				I would also ask why people move to Astoria if they dislike all the European stuff. I myself do not go to those cafes, probably partially because I live on Ditmars and otherwise because I don&#039;t really hang out by myself in cafes anyway, but of all the things to hate about a neighborhood, its having too many european-style cafes (filled with actual Europeans) is kind of weird to me. There are enough things in this area for everyone where if you don&#039;t like a certain place, there&#039;s probably another place not too far away that you&#039;d prefer. <br /><br />To be honest, I think some people have gotten too comfortable with this board. We&#039;ve been quoted in TimeOut and New York Magazine (maybe the New York Times, too? I don&#039;t remember). A LOT of people keep an eye on this board even if they don&#039;t post here, and I&#039;m sure some business owners and customers do too. The last thing &quot;Astorians&quot; need, most of us here being Americans who&#039;ve moved here in the last few years, is a reputation of being anti-Greek and having the desire to turn Astoria into the &#039;burbs.

				Who dislikes the European stuff? When you say European, what do you mean?&nbsp; The success of places like Balthazar, Babbo, Esca, all make me think that European food is doing very well in New York. <br /><br />Do you mean Cretan / Cypriot? Or do you mean the Croatian or Bosnian run Italian places? <br /><br />The cafes are fine. Having outdoor options is wonderful. <br /><br />What&#039;s not fine about some of the cafes: <br /><br />Overpriced, under-seasoned, over-oiled food that often comes out of a freezer bag.&nbsp; <br /><br />Terrible service.<br /><br />Prices. I don&#039;t understand how a grilled cheese sandwich at Athens Cafe comes made with American cheese, no tomatoes, on Wonderbread and is served with the exact same giant bag of precut, frozen french fries that I can buy from the grocery store and costs $8. <br />

				I think you&#039;re right essen, off the cuff I could only think of more dining type establishments. Although I don&#039;t know if Balthazar or Esca count as fine dining. <br /><br />i&#039;m not sure what the context of this thread is then... <br /><br />You mean the &#039;european style&#039; cafes that are in Astoria, but not the European style cafes like Tartine in the West Village, E.U. in the East Village, Cafe Falai in SoHo &amp; the Lower East Side?&nbsp; These are all immigrant run places that resemble the European cafes I grew up with in Italy, Austria, etc...&nbsp; The difference... in my mind any way is that the owners of those cafes care about preparing food using fresh, local and authentic ingredients. And they&#039;ve been rewarded for it in the news.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have yet to visit a European style cafe in Astoria that is not serving the same &#039;wraps&#039; using Astoria Pita bread filled with iceberg lettuce or diner type food that comes out of a freezer bag. Except for Brick &amp; Locale, who by the way are charging anywhere from $18 - $26 for an entree. I&#039;ve had some lovely food at those two places

I must say that the &quot;Euro&quot; cafe industry seems even bigger and more alive than ever. I&#039;ve definitely contributed to some anti-Euro cafe comments on this board, but they never had anything to do with Europeans themselves (why would I be living in Astoria if I hated Europeans?!?!). It has all to do with sometimes mediocre food, way over-priced menus and occasional shoddy service. This is something that my wife and I have come to expect as we sampled (and continue to sample) the various Euro cafes in Astoria. We&#039;ve both traveled Europe extensively and understand full well that, sometimes, you practically have to go into the kitchen and find your waiter to get your check and that it will still take a few waves of the hand to actually hold it in your hands. While I can understand this might seem like bad service to a newbie, it&#039;s really no big deal once their whole laid back, leave-the-customer-be attitude is understood. And If paying $6-$7 for a 12 oz. bottled beer is worth the price of sitting outside on a beautiful day then that&#039;s all there is to it. <br /><br />But, I don&#039;t see why complaining about a restaurant/bar with overpriced, mediocre food, blaring dance music and bad service requires an explanation. If said criticisms seem to frequently land on so-called Euro cafes, then perhaps that&#039;s just an unfortunate coincidence. Perhaps. <br /><br />BTW, I can tell you what I DON&#039;T want to see Euro cafe&#039;s replaced with and that&#039;s a 7-Eleven, which is exactly what the Park Cafe (our once favorite, overpriced, blaring dance music, local spot) is going to become according to a poster in the window. Just what we need, another <del>Euro cafe</del> convenience store.&nbsp; &nbsp;:lol:

				I&#039;d have to say that these Cafes along 30th ave (for example) are geared towards a particular niche community.&nbsp; For them the cafes are all about out door seating, socializing and hanging out.&nbsp; These places are meeting hall, disco, cafe and bar al rolled into one (sans dancing).&nbsp; The food seems to be secondary at best and just not important.&nbsp; The music, who knows.&nbsp; Just part of the over all affect?&nbsp; I love it for the iced coffees and people watching from the outdoor seating but not at midnight with a packed crowd.&nbsp; Don&#039;t like all of the scene but can absolutely appreciate it at times.<br /><br />And hey, if you lived in Spanish harlem and frequented the local Spanish cafe/restaurants would you really expect them to change the music or the scene in anyway?&nbsp; Probably not.&nbsp; So why do the same here?&nbsp; Bet you anything that in 5yrs you will see a fair amount of Americana style cafes,&nbsp; bars and restaurants around here.&nbsp; Sparrow and Oleput are just the beginning of the trend, thank god.

The food is not as important to the residents as the community places they provide. If that&#039;s what you&#039;re saying, I think you&#039;re right and that is something that I associate as being European. Cafes there are meeting place, rotary and coffee shop rolled in one. <br />The part that doesn&#039;t make sense is that in Europe, the dingiest hole of a wall cafe in some tiny, backward part of Southern Italy is going to serve food that reflects the local food philosophy of where they&#039;re from. The pig is going to come from Gianni the butcher, the bread from Maria the mother in law and the mozzarella from the giant water buffalo that lives in the backyard! It&#039;s not going to come from a bag and it is going to reflect the class of the residents that live there, the working class farmers &amp; laborers.&nbsp; That&#039;s what I don&#039;t understand. Why is Astoria European in tone and community, but lacks the religion of the daily European, the food that they eat and the wine that they drink.<br /><br />This is not some kind of a Europe is better type of story. It&#039;s only that to cast doubt on a country&#039;s food in Europe is to cast doubt on their national identity. Right now one of the biggest fights in France has to do with the agro subsidies that the wine growers receive. Farmers get so much attention in Europe it&#039;s amazing. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">And hey, if you lived in Spanish harlem and frequented the local Spanish cafe/restaurants would you really expect them to change the music or the scene in anyway?&nbsp; Probably not.&nbsp; So why do the same here?&nbsp; Bet you anything that in 5yrs you will see a fair amount of Americana style cafes,&nbsp; bars and restaurants around here.&nbsp; Sparrow and Oleput are just the beginning of the trend, thank god. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The Spanish cafes will serve Spanish food, not Velveeta cheese on Wonderbread.

				In my interpretation, Debbie started this thread in response to negative comments about the patrons of these these establishments. I&#039;d agreed with Jonathon that frankly, you don&#039;t go to Athens cafe for the fine cuisine. This is not true of all of the side-walk-type cafes ( I really like the food at Grand) but I don&#039;t think grilled cheese is their speciality. <br /><br />But the original negative comments were discussing the atmosphere, patrons, and culture of the euro care in a rather derogatory sense. I&#039;m greek, and don&#039;t personally frequent these places unless i&#039;m in the mood for this experience. I&#039;ve also observed that while some cafes are predominantly greek, others aren&#039;t. Athens is much more diverse in its patrons as is Flo, Grand, etc. It just depends. <br /><br />I get the feeling that some people feel like they aren&#039;t welcomed if they are not european, and in some places it might be true, but to dengrate an entire european &nbsp;culture because of this appears to be inappropriate. <br /><br />Debbie, if I am wrong as to what prompted the thread, I&#039;m sorry. This is just what I got from it.

A cafe, food is secondary, hence the term &quot;cafe&quot; where coffee is the main product. Try the euro restaurants in the area and the difference is apparent.

				Debbie, since I think some comments I made in the thread regarding the service at Pita Pan prompted you to start this thread, let me say this.<br /><br />First of all, I am Greek myself.&nbsp; So there&#039;s no anti-Greek bias coming from me.&nbsp; But at the same time, I&#039;m not going to favor one place over another just because it is Greek or Cypriot owned if I don&#039;t like the service or the product there.<br /><br />Second, I was referring more to the type of service, prices and ambiance that you get at these places.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been to every single one on 30th avenue, starting from Plaza Lounge and going all the way up to Flo.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also been to Omonia, Kolonaki, Tre, and Lefkos Pirgos.&nbsp; I&#039;m quite familiar with all of them, though I am not someone that you&#039;ll see at the cafes every day or even every weekend.<br /><br />What I find obnoxious about them, and which prevents me from going more often, as I mentioned, is the service and the overall attitude of some who are there (both employed and as patrons).&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ll use Athens Cafe for one example.&nbsp; I find their prices to be obnoxiously high, the highest of any of the establishments on 30th.&nbsp; A souvlaki sandwich, for instance, without any fries or chips or anything else, costs $8.25 there.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t seen it anywhere else for less than $6 and usually less than $5.&nbsp; Combine that with the fact that I&#039;ve found the service there to often be very slow and subpar, and it&#039;s really not worth it.&nbsp; If I want to people-watch, there&#039;s many other places I can do so.<br /><br />As far as the loud music/vibe and so forth....it is true that you see a lot of people who really are there to &quot;impress&quot;, with their fast cars which they make a point of revving up in front of the cafes to impress everyone sitting outside, guys in muscle tees and so on just being loud and obnoxious.&nbsp; Some places more than others blast the music as well, though nothing as loud as I heard yesterday at Pita Pan.&nbsp; And yes, some music is nice and you don&#039;t expect these places to be a library, but when it gets to the point where you can&#039;t hear anything anyone with you is telling you, when you can&#039;t have a conversation and are reduced to just sitting there and staring at other people, including people who seem to be there exclusively to be stared at, then it&#039;s just not an enjoyable experience anymore.&nbsp; One of the reasons people go out is to socialize, but under those circumstances, I find it hard to do so.<br /><br />Astoria is full of wonderful places.&nbsp; As someone else pointed out, the cafes on 30th serve a specific niche.&nbsp; But, Debbie, as someone who is also of Greek descent and indeed who has traveled to Greece many, many times and will be going again in a week, I can say also that the cafes on 30th give a certain impression of Greek people and establishments that is not wholly accurate.&nbsp; Just because I&#039;m Greek, doesn&#039;t mean that I will follow the herd and go to these places just because other Greeks do.&nbsp; And having experienced Greece, including living there for up to a few months at a time, I know that there&#039;s many other types of Greek establishments that can exist.&nbsp; Sometimes I like to go to a place where yes, I can enjoy a frappe or a baklava or a freddo but without the showoffs in flashy clothes and flashy cars, the loud music, the high prices, and the slow service.&nbsp; And while it hasn&#039;t been reflected so much in this thread, I&#039;ve seen many tongue-in-cheek comments made about the places on 30th by other posters on this site, so I know I&#039;m not alone.&nbsp; Ultimately, people will go to the places they enjoy, and fortunately, Astoria has plenty of establishments for all tastes.&nbsp; If I am not crazy about the 30th Avenue cafe scene, I&#039;m entitled to that feeling and it shouldn&#039;t be construed as some sort of bias or anger.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure that everyone here has places they enjoy and places that they typically avoid for whatever reason.

				I live on 33rd Street between 30th and 31st Avenues. While I can appreciate the safety that Athens Cafe has brought to the area -- it&#039;s presence has made 30th Avenue alive late at night, making a walk down the avenue from the train seem less dark and scary -- it, along with the other cafes along 30th Avenue, have also increased traffic and made parking in the area more difficult for those of us who live there. Last night (Saturday night) for example, I spent 45 minutes trying to park my car. It&#039;s worse during the summer, and worse on the weekends. Cars go zooming down the block and careen around the corner, making crossing the street at Newtown/30th Avenue very dangerous. <br /><br />The foot traffic is pretty bad too. People walk down the street late at night, talking really loudly, inconsiderate of the fact that they&#039;re walking down a residential street where there are people trying to sleep at 2 a.m. <br /><br />I have nothing against the cafes, but it would be great if they could or would send the message to their patrons to be considerate of the folks who live in the neighborhood. Or it would be great if the 114th Precinct could maintain more of a presence in the area on weekend nights to address the traffic and noise concerns -- it seems bizarre to me that there are NEVER any cops around 30th Avenue on the weekend nights when throngs of people flock to the area. <br /><br />I was born in Astoria, and live in the apartment I was raised in, so believe me when I say that it wasn&#039;t always like this -- the increase in both pedestrian and vehicular traffic has come along with the influx of cafes in the area. Coincidence? I think not. <br /><br />

				I don&#039;t have any experience with the cafes myself, but it&#039;s interesting for me to read neo&#039;s and barrister&#039;s perspectives.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s a dangerous assumption to conflate any sentiment regarding the cafes with anti-European bias, which some earlier posts seemed to suggest.

				Lots of interesting replies.<br /><br />Some comments:<br /><br />Neo - I do not care for the term &#039;Euro-trash&#039; and I do not care about any comments regarding Pita Pan.&nbsp; I have never been there and will probably never go.&nbsp; Also, what restaurant would allow you to sit there for a couple of hours sipping coffee, hence the high prices.&nbsp; And, you know as well as I do that these days a Frappe in a suburb of Athens would set you as back as one in Astoria.&nbsp; <br /><br />Flinxt - Since we moved here in 1973, there has actually been an INCREASE in Greek owned businesses, vs a decrease!&nbsp; Some examples:<br /><br />Christos Steakhouse (used to be something else)<br />Demetris<br />Anna&#039;s Corner<br />Stamatis on Broadway<br />Kyclades (I think the owner is an Albanian Greek)<br />Mezzo Mezzo (I think they are Greeks)<br />Mediterranean in the little mall<br />Artopolis<br />Titan<br />Martha&#039;s (George is a Greek American)<br />Astoria Fish Market<br />Zenon<br />Zodiac<br />Athens Restaurant<br /><br />Just add to the list folks.&nbsp; Greeks may have moved out, but they come here to shop, eat and party.<br /><br />Alexa - What prompted this thread are the deragatory comments regarding the cafes and those who frequent them.&nbsp; Anyone can write whatever they wish, however, I am feeling a hint of disdain and perhaps a bit of bias.&nbsp; Cafes have been around for years - remember Hilton, Edelweiss on Broadway, and the ever lasting Lefkos Pirgos?&nbsp; Athens has also been around for years.&nbsp; There are new ones like Grand, Flo, and semi new ones like Avenue.&nbsp; I think they are part of the fabric of the area and are here to stay.&nbsp; If they were not successful, they would close down; obviously, they are doing well.&nbsp; <br /><br />My eighty year old mother and I visit a cafe every Saturday.&nbsp; We sit there, chat, have an expensive frappe, get smoke blown in our faces, languish in the sun, make friends with the people at the table next to us, listen to too loud obnoxious music and have a good time.&nbsp; We are not Euro-trash and love our Saturday afternoons at Astoria cafes!<br /><br /><br />

				Debbie, I honestly don&#039;t feel that any bias or disdain was ever intended.&nbsp; Clearly, &quot;euro-trash&quot; is not a nice term to use and I personally hope it won&#039;t be used anymore but the bottom line is that people seem to be reacting to real issues like pricing, noise, parking issues, etc. rather than against Greeks as an ethnic group which is what you seem to be saying - maybe I am wrong.&nbsp; The great thing about Astoria is that there are so many different types of restaurants and cafes that appeal to different tastes and it&#039;s OK for people to like some and not like others.&nbsp; Also, if people do not like a type of ethnic restaurant or business I don&#039;t necessarily see it as a slight against the particular ethnic group.&nbsp; I guess I just don&#039;t see the comments about cafes as being an ethnic issue.

				Sorry...coming in a bit late to this discussion but I agree with Debbie comments and it&#039;s something that I&#039;ve noticed in some of the comments posted to this board. <br /><br />&#039;Euro-trash&#039;, specifically in regard to cafes, has come up in more than one thread, especially in discussions of what the neighborhood doesn&#039;t need more of, and it always struck me a subtle dig or bias because it&#039;s not a big step to make to link the cafes to people who frequent them. <br /><br />I&#039;m sorry if some people are upset that they don&#039;t find Ross, Rachel, Monica and Chandler (sorry I know that&#039;s sounds soooo &#039;90s) hanging out at Athens cafe and if that&#039;s what they expect there are other places to frequent in this city -- move on or move out.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />

				Handyman -- I look forward to your post and I appreciate your attempt at re-defining Euro-trash but in the context of the postings on this board I think it safe to assume it refers to people of Greek-, Italian- and Balkan-descent and the businesses they operate or frequent in the neighborhood. <br /><br />It would be called something else if it referred to other ethnic groups.

				What I don&#039;t like about these cafés are the things that have been mentioned in other threads - <br />they&#039;re overpriced, service is often border-line snotty, if not outright rude and the food is mediocre<br />most of the time.<br /><br />I also resent the fact that the ones with outdoor spaces take up so much of the sidewalk that <br />we, the neighborhood residents who live on these blocks, have so little space to walk. That may<br />sound petty to some, but why should I have to walk in the gutter so that someone sipping a <br />coffee for two hours at Athens cafe can sit in the middle of the sidewalk? It&#039;s often impossible to have<br />two-way pedestrian traffic on 29th St., especially from 5:30 on when people are getting home from<br />work/school, etc. <br /><br />I make a point of not patronizing these places because they often serve cheap liquor in top-shelf bottles - <br />and that comes straight from a bartender I knew who worked at Athens for a while - and food that&#039;s not<br />even fresh - that from a cashier at Tradefair who told me how cafe personnel were coming in to buy old<br />bread, cheap produce, etc.<br /><br />These are not the same cafes you find in the Piazza Venezia or the Champs Elysee&nbsp; -- please.<br /><br />

				I have to agree with 28Grand. &nbsp;I don&#039;t think it&#039;s something where anyone should start going through old posts and pointing it out as examples. &nbsp;I do see comments where the general feel is that the very existence of these cafes is disparaged and words like euro-trash are used. &nbsp;But it&#039;s certainly not everywhere, or even prevalent and in rethinking about this, I realize some of this may be blown out of proportion. &nbsp;There are people who do post legitimate complaints and then there are those who really do not like the cafes, the music, or the general clientele they cater to. &nbsp;But at this point, I would just ignore the latter. &nbsp;I can&#039;t expect everyone to like everything I do, and it&#039;s ok. &nbsp;We just probably won&#039;t go to the cafes together, that&#039;s all. &nbsp;I don&#039;t think it&#039;s enough of a problem on this board, and as far as the words &quot;euro-trash&quot; are concerned, a general search of the term on this board actually doesn&#039;t turn up many results.

				I think there are definitely some legitimate complaints to be had about these establishments -- they do increase the noise, increase the traffic, and negatively impact the quality of life in the area for people who have lived here for decades, long before the cafes started sprouting up in such numbers and size.<br /><br />For example: <br /><br />-- Athens Cafe was a pizzeria/shoe repair (and some other business) before it took over the &quot;triangle&quot; <br /><br />-- Grand Cafe was a bank<br /><br />-- Flo was a health and beauty aid-type store<br /><br />-- The place on the corner of 29th Street &amp; 30th Ave (don&#039;t remember the name, sorry) was a pharmacy<br /><br />None of those businesses generated the traffic or noise that exists now. 30th Avenue is a residential neighborhood -- not a main thoroughfare designed for excessive traffic. Clogging up a residential area with business that attract large groups of people that hang out until all hours of the night is not a way to make nice with the neighbors -- it&#039;s just inconsiderate. The more cafes that open, the more congested the neighborhood gets. <br /><br />Again, I have nothing against the cafes, but I am unhappy with the effect they&#039;ve had on the quality of life in this <em>residential</em> neighborhood. It has nothing to do with the ethnic makeup of the clientele or owners, it has to do with the impact on the area. The middle eastern cafes on Steinway also attract crowds of people, but Steinway has always been known as a more commercial area (and therefore a more appropriate location).<br /><br />Just my two cents.

				Somebody hand me a shovel, I&#039;m about to dig a hole the size of myself.&nbsp; :evil:<br /><br />I wasn&#039;t going to contribute anything else to this thread other than my original post, but it seems to have gotten way out of hand. I doubt I&#039;ve ever even typed these words before, much less on this board, but here goes: Euro-trash. There, I said it. White-trash. There, I said that, too. No ethnic bias at all (Sorry, I don&#039;t consider &quot;white&quot; to be an ethnic group--especially in New York). If anyone&#039;s worried that I&#039;m using the term simply refers to folks from Greece or Italy, there&#039;s plenty of Euro-trash from lily-white England, just look what&#039;s recently washed up on the west coast in her very own NBC series--Victoria Beckham of all people. If she&#039;s not the epitome of Euro-trash I don&#039;t know what is. When all you seem to care about is your hair, how white your teeth are, how expensive your shoes or your jeans are, what type of sports car you drive, etc, <em>AND</em>--I repeat, <em>AND</em>--you happen to be from Europe, tough break--you&#039;re Euro-trash in my book.<br /><br />I was just in Istanbul--saw a good amount of Euro-trash there, unfortunately. I also saw and met a lot of really cool, young Turks who I would describe as anything but. I don&#039;t say this because they resembled Americans--I&#039;m not <em>that </em> shallow. They had there own, very distinct style and attitude that was VERY Turkish. <br /><br />While I most likely never will again on this board, I say, and will continue to say, the term Euro-trash the same way I say White-trash, Ugly Americans (which I also saw in Istanbul, ugh!), Frat-boy, Meat-head, and so on to verbally toss certain types of people whom I do not admire into convenient little groups for my tongue-lashing pleasure. That said, I do see the <em>potential </em> for harm in unleashing such a loaded term into an online message board where each little word can be (and is frequently) dissected into a multitude of possible meanings that offend and inspire conflict. I don&#039;t think self-censorship is always a good answer, but in this case consider this the last time you ever hear me say the term Euro-trash.<br /><br />Word count on Astorians.com for term &quot;euro-trash&quot; prior to this posting: 6<br />Word count on Astorians.com for term &quot;euro-trash&quot; after this posting: 13<br />

				I&#039;ll also add that one needs to keep perspective on the &quot;negativity&quot; related to anything on the board. Most often it&#039;s just a handful of posters that complain about something and this gets interpreted as the &quot;board being negative&quot;. Most people are mostly happy with Astoria most of the time. There will always be some group complaining about something, but to judge the rest of us based on these complainers isn&#039;t fair. Even when it comes to those of us that complain about the motorcycle noise it&#039;s really a pretty small number of us compared to everyone that visits the board (though I&#039;d love it if you all were as sick of it as I am :) )

				Well, since you took the time to break it down, you should see for yourself that there are elements for group think in this thread, and others. You probably also understand that group think doesn&#039;t have just one definition, even if you are quoting the individual that coined it, many have studied. But if you look at some of the responses you will find that<br /><br />Members of the board are already censoring their own opinions (6.) (see Jentastico&#039;s post) which not only responsed to self-censorship, but also to feeling like an effective argument is useless (4.) The illusion of unanimity is shifting, much like it did in the igloo thread regarding a person sitting at a table of four (7.) The thread starts off praising Debbie and slowly shifts as the bandwagon forms and the negitivity is shifted. <br /><br />I&quot;m not saying that big brother is taking over, but it is interesting how the posts are shaped as the thread continues. To get into a better discussion about this, one psychologist quoted is not sufficient. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=7194.msg83908#msg83908">Quote from: lanseaux on July 23, 2007, 10:54:09 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br /><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;1.&nbsp; Illusion of invulnerability –Creates excessive optimism that encourages taking extreme risks.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;2.

				I have been here since 1998. I am not originally from here, but close by. I have not hit every cafe in the area, not even close, but there are places that seem to not welcome you. The menus will not even have an English counterpart. Snide comments in another language by wait staff about people in your party. (see early diatribe about Mike&#039;s Diner). Smoking and ash trays right below the legally obligatory No Smoking sign. (Lefkos Pirgos).<br /><br />Hey look. It&#039;s cool that Astoria has cafes. They weren&#039;t that prevalent when I moved here nine years ago, but they are not all that welcoming, authentic or worth the $. It&#039;s a free country, I think, make up your own mind and exercise your constitutional right to free speech.

				Wow....<br /><br />I&#039;m sitting at my cafe and reading all this.<br />Its amazing ..... <br />I think if every business would , first of all consider its neighbors, secondly learn as they grow and lastly<br />be open to others, we would be in the kind of Astoria we all wish for.<br /><br />It takes money to keep a cafe open, it takes clients to earn that money and it takes your neighbors <br />supporting you and being happy your IN the neighborhood.<br /><br />If you love the cafe you go to...tell them so and tell them why.<br />If you feel otherwise.... don&#039;t support them... <br />no need to bad mouth them, let it take its own course... <br /><br />Simply don&#039;t spend your hard earned money in places you don&#039;t like.<br />I don&#039;t go in places that let you smoke...it bugs me.<br />I don&#039;t frequent places that treat me poorly, why should I ?<br /><br />But step into any of the forward thinking , risk taking new places around and you feel it right away.<br />Ok, so maybe the price is higher than you would like.... Hey its 2007 <br />so make your cheese sammy at home.. no problem....<br />Cafe&#039;s are not the problem with Astoria.... just like nail salons are not the problem<br />the problems start when we don&#039;t let ourselves get outside the box, think outside the box and <br />live outside the box...<br /><br />Astoria rocks, and its these kinds of back and forth issues that <br />drove us to open <br />Waltz-Astoria here...<br /><br />

				Okay, I just skimmed the topic, will try to read it all, see the way some of it is going...not going there.<br /><br />I do want to just vent my personal issue with some of the cafes in the area. And maybe someone can shed some light on my question.<br /><br />Why is it that for every street, there&#039;s 3 or 4 cafes that look like swank, great places to go... that always have one creepy guy sitting in it all alone, (thus making it somewhere I don&#039;t want to go alone) and that never seem to be populated, even at the busy times, buy more than 6 people? How do they even stay in business? The rarely even look like they want to... Just a query.<br /><br />
