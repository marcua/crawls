				I have a vegan visitor coming to town.&nbsp; She&#039;s not incredibly strict about it, but I was wondering if there are any good restaurants in town that might accomodate veganism?&nbsp; It would be great if us non-vegans could also get something to eat there too!

				&quot;Town&quot; meaning &quot;Astoria&quot; or &quot;Town&quot; meaning &quot;New York City&quot;? If Astoria, I think not, although I&#39;m sure you can find very good South Indian vegan food in Jackson Heights. Cafe Bar (fair) and Mundo (good) have lots of vegetarian food, but I don&#39;t know about vegan. In Manhattan, though, there are plenty. I heard a good review of Blossom in Chelsea recently. Counter in the E. Village is very good. There&#39;s some very good raw food too, including Caravan of Dreams and Pure Food and Wine. I&#39;m sure Google or Menupages could tell you a lot more...

				Restaurants in Manhattan:<br /><br />Vegetarian Paradise II (W. 4th at Broadway)<br />Candle Cafe (E. 70th and 3rd), not all vegan<br />Zen Palate (can&#39;t remember address)<br />Angelica&#39;s Kitchen (can&#39;t remember address)<br />Gobo (401 6th Ave)<br />Kate&#39;s Joint (4th Street and Ave B), can have dishes customized veg/vegan<br />Galaxy Diner (15th and Irving), bbq seitan, textured soy dishes<br />and Burrito Box, which has options for making your burrito vegan.<br /><br />Of all the places I&#39;ve listed, I&#39;ve heard rave reviews about Candle Cafe, and I personally really liked Gobo. &nbsp;I do not care for Zen Palate. &nbsp;In Astoria, you can go to Fresh Start on 23rd Ave for good vegan deli takeout.&nbsp; Baked goods often are wheat-free and vegan.

				Oh, right. Yes, Zen Palate is pretty uninspired, despite the nice decor. Galaxy Diner attempts to be very good but somehow manages to pair good recipes with really horribly cheap ingredients for a very unsatisfying result. I haven&#39;t been to the others Meg lists...

				I&#39;m vegan and have had good dishes at Wave Thai and Thai Elephant (both on 31st north of Ditmars).<br /><br />As far as Manhattan goes my first recommendation would be Vegetarian&#39;s Paradise 2 (http://www.vp2-nyc.com/) (located off of Washington Square Park), followed by Red Bamboo (http://www.redbamboo-nyc.com/) (owned and operated by VP2 people - and just a couple doors away). Both are most excellent. I also like Zen Palate (http://www.zenpalate.com/home.htm) (Union Square, UWS, and I think one other location), but if you go there make sure you eat upstairs (or off their more expensive menu). The food is far better, albeit more expensive. <br /><br />If you want to splurge on dessert a block and a half or so off of Union Square is a raw food take out place with a divine chocolate tart. It&#39;s about $10 a slice, but pretty amazing and totally worth it. They have a restaurant around the corner called Pure Food and Wine (http://www.purefoodandwine.com/), but the take out place is called Pure Juice and Takeaway (http://www.purefoodandwine.com/purejuice.html) (126 E. 17th St.). I have also eaten at Quintessence (http://www.raw-q.com/), which is an expensive raw food restaurant. When we went it was about $40/person, of course we ordered several things as well.<br /><br />Oh and Burritoville has great options for vegans! I love their Lost in Austin burrito - spinach and mushrooms. You can also substitute any of their dairy with soy items. Mmmm...<br /><br />Good luck!

				Oh and BTW - we have taken many of our carnivorous friends to VP2 and some have even said that the &quot;meat&quot; there tastes as good, if not better, than the real deal. I wouldn&#39;t know, but that&#39;s what they&#39;ve said!

The downstairs is good for a quick and fairly inexpensive bite to eat with mostly little two- or four-person tables. The upstairs is more like a regular sit-down restaurant with larger tables, more attentive waiters, and a different, more gourmet menu. Entrees cost anywhere from $12 to $16 (if I remember correctly).<br /><br />I would still choose VP2 over Zen Palate&#39;s upstairs menu, and you can walk away from VP2 with better food and more money in your wallet. I still enjoy Zen Palate, but I much prefer their upstairs menu to their downstairs one.

				I&#39;ve only eaten downstairs at Zen Palate.&nbsp; I was not impressed.&nbsp; Over cooked vegetables, and much of the food on the table all tasted the same, in a kind of pan-asian fog of ginger and soy.&nbsp; I would love someone to make vegan food that is not so pacific rim centric as far as flavors goes.&nbsp; Someone who brings in flavors of the mediterranean, central asia, and south america, to name a few.&nbsp; I understand why asian flavors lend themselves so readily to meatless/dairy-less fare, and I enjoy it, but I find it repetitive after a while.

				Never knew there was a separate upstairs menu at Zen Palate, will have to try it. I like Zen Palate, but the only dish I ever eat there is their &quot;sweet and sour sensation&quot; - deep-fried tofu in sweet/sour sauce. Probably not very healthy but I was hooked on it for a while.

Mediterranean is a no-brainer in my opinion, although many associate fish with that diet. You can easily make (and probably buy) vegan paella (same as vegetarian), as well as make a lot of Mediterranean inspired dishes. I have an excellent cookbook called The Mediterranean Vegan Kitchen, which has wonderful pasta, focaccia, salad, soup, and dessert recipes.<br /><br />VP2 and Red Bamboo both have a lot of dishes other than asian, although they would probably be best categorized as asian-fusion.<br /><br />Other types of restaurants also cater to the vegan crowd, sometimes without meaning to, I think, because many of their dishes are automatically vegan. If you go to Ethiopian, Indian (still asian, sorry), Italian, and Spanish restaurants you can get many fantastic dishes that are either vegetarian or vegan. Middle Eastern food also has wonderful options for vegans - falafel, hummus, baba ganoush, tabouli, etc.<br /><br />But you&#39;re right - many vegan/vegetarian restaurants do tend to go the asian route, which, for people who don&#39;t like asian food is unfortunate. I LOVE asian food, so I can&#39;t complain too much myself.

				I&#39;m gonna have to agree with all the comments on Candle Cafe.&nbsp; I used to work with the owner&#39;s son and our boss was vegan, so we went there quite a bit.&nbsp; The also opened a second restaurant called Candle 79 on 79th Street on the Upper East.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t tried that yet.<br /><br />I&#39;m not vegetarian and the food at Candle is phenomenal.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t eaten there in years, &#39;cause it&#39;s not convenient, but definitely would more often if it was closer.

				there are tons of health food stores in manhattan that have lots of vegetarian and vegan menu items in their deli and/or prepared foods bar. there&#39;s a chain called &quot;the health nuts&quot; that has an all vegan food bar. it&#39;s alright. in astoria - sai organics (30ave/35st) and fresh start (23ave@29/31st). the one on broadway@30/31st has no deli or food bar but they have juice and a really pretty cashier. <br /><br />there are dozens, maybe 100s, of awesome all-vegetarian or all-vegan restaurants in nyc, and most restaurants can accomodate. any visitor to this city should be pleased, unless maybe they&#39;re from san franhippycisco

				We finally went to Babycakes today, and had a spelt chocolate cupcake and brownie each. I enjoyed the cupcake but my favorite part about it was the frosting. I typically do not like frosting, but this was really quite good - smooth and creamy. The brownie was excellent -&nbsp; moist and very chocolately. I definitely would recommend Babycakes, although they are a bit pricey. The brownie was all of two or three bites and was $0.95. I forget how much the cupcakes were, but seems like they were around $2.50 or so for a standard-sized (not large) cupcake/muffin.<br /><br />Also tried Pomme Frites for the first time and enjoyed them as well (belgium-style fries). There was a line going out the door the entire time that we were there, so they are definitely popular. We tried their dijon mustard, curry ketchup, and mexican ketchup. I liked the dijon and mexican the most, but when I think of fries I usually think they are best sans anything or with regular ketchup.

				Well, I had myself a vegan adventure today.&nbsp; I went down to the LES to Babycakes.&nbsp; What a crowd!&nbsp; The place was packed with people sitting around drinking coffee (why, I don&#39;t know, because the place is so tiny and cramped), but I made my way through the crowds to order a couple of cupcakes and a cupcake top.&nbsp; I had the carrot spelt cupcake, a chocolate spelt cupcake, and a chocolate gluten-free cupcake top.&nbsp; All very good, but the carrot cupcake really stood out.&nbsp; It was fantastic!&nbsp; Perfectly moist and light with a nice, smooth, slightly tangy frosting.&nbsp; I enjoyed the gluten-free cupcake top (chocoalte with chocolate icing).&nbsp; The spelt chocolate cupcake was a tiny bit too sweet for me, but was delicious nonetheless.&nbsp; Yes, I ate them ALL this afternoon.&nbsp; And don&#39;t feel all gross, bloated, and sugar-hungover.&nbsp; Such a nice change.<br /><br />While I was in the area, I remembered that I was nearby May Wah, that source of veggie duck.&nbsp; I bought two packages, $2.75 a package, which seemed like a super deal to me.&nbsp; Also picked up some red bean buns, which I look forward to eating this week.&nbsp; I&#39;m really excited to try the veggie duck in my own home!&nbsp; Mmm...

(the saturates are what make it solid/semi-solid at room temperature, but the jury is still out on the dangers of palm and coconut oil, and indeed other saturates, despite what you hear.&nbsp; This is because certain saturates increase HDL and improve the total:HDL cholesterol ratio, which is an aspect that has been generally ignored in the rush to jump on the &quot;cholesterol must be low&quot; bandwagon.)<br /><br />See:&nbsp; Effects of dietary fatty acids and carbohydrates on the ratio of serum total to HDL cholesterol and on serum lipids and apolipoproteins: a meta-analysis of 60 controlled trials (http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/77/5/1146)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Individual saturated fatty acids<br />Lauric acid markedly increases cholesterol, whereas stearic acid lowers it somewhat when it is used to replace carbohydrates. However, the picture reverses if one looks at total:HDL cholesterol: both lauric and stearic acid are now more favorable than carbohydrates. Lauric acid—a major component of tropical oils such as coconut and palm kernel fat—has the largest cholesterol-raising effect of all fatty acids, but much of this is due to HDL cholesterol. As a result, lauric acid had a more favorable effect on total:HDL cholesterol than any other fatty acid, either saturated or unsaturated.<br /><br />&lt;snip&gt;<br /><br />Our results emphasize the risk of relying on cholesterol alone as a marker of CAD risk. Replacement of carbohydrates with tropical oils markedly raises total cholesterol, which is unfavorable, but the picture changes if effects on HDL and apo B are taken into account. The picture may change again once we know how to interpret the effects of diet on postprandial lipemia, thrombogenic factors, and other, newer markers. However, as long as information directly linking the consumption of certain fats and oils with CAD is lacking, we can never be sure what such fats and oils do to CAD risk.&nbsp; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The analysis also observed that &quot;All 3 classes of fatty acids [saturated, unsaturated and trans] increased HDL cholesterol relative to carbohydrates. Unsaturated fatty acids increased HDL cholesterol less than did SFAs.&quot;<br /><br />/OT<br /><br />Anyway, my original reply was only to point out that there are margarines on the market that do not contain trans-fats (hydrogenated oils), and that at least one of them is vegan.

This, too is much higher in saturates, myristic and lauric acid than palm fruit oil.

				Out of sheer curiosity, I got a couple of things from Babycakes yesterday.&nbsp; The frosting on the spelt cupcake was oozing oil by the time I got it home--I&#39;m hoping it will firm up after a stint in the fridge.&nbsp; How did they taste?&nbsp; Well, if I needed to eat gluten-free products, I would adore these, as they&#39;re really not bad for what they are.&nbsp; But since I can eat wheat and I&#39;m not a vegan, I consider these to be pale imitations of the real thing and would much rather drop into Sugar Sweet Sunshine.&nbsp; An analogy would be fake meat: probably pretty good if you&#39;re a vegan/vegetarian, but since I do eat meat, I&#39;d rather have vegan food that did interesting things with veggies, grains, and pulses rather than mock duck.

				I find Sugar Sweet Sunshine to have headache-inducing levels of sugar.&nbsp; I was given one of their cupcakes, which I found to be dry and uninteresting.&nbsp; The frosting was so sweet and grainy that it made me gag and cough and I had to run immediately after the first bite of it to get a drink of water to wash it down.&nbsp; As far as I&#39;m concerned, almost no one in this city has created the balance between a good buttercream and moist, flavorful cake.&nbsp; The best I&#39;ve found is the carrot cupcake at Babycakes.&nbsp; Cupcake Cafe as well with an amazing buttercream and a tasty cupcake below it, even though it is a bit dry (although the nut-based cucake is better in the moist department.&nbsp; I do not understand the need in this town to top a cupcake with such grainy, overly-sweet buttercream.&nbsp;

				I liked Babycakes myself - but I liked the cupcakes less than the brownies. The brownies were more moist and chocolately. Granted - not all vegan dishes are as good as their dairy and meat counterparts (on the meat thing I wouldn&#39;t entirely know), but the purpose of Babycakes is to provide people who have allergies (gluten, wheat), diseases like diabetes, and parents with mostly guilt-free and delicious desserts.<br /><br />I think a lot of it is a matter of taste. A lady at work brought in store-bought chocolate cake the other day and insisted that I have some because her daughter and all these other people had said that it was the best chocolate cake that they&#39;d ever had. I confess - it was not vegan - but I also confess that it was mediocre at best and far less tasty than any vegan chocolate dessert I&#39;ve ever had.<br /><br />I do disagree with you that brownies and cupcakes are &quot;not real&quot; or &quot;immitations&quot; because they don&#39;t contain milk or eggs. Yes - fake meat is trying to step in for real meat - for <em>some people</em> - typically omnivores, I would argue - but at the same time a lot of fake meat (aka tofu, tempeh, wheat gluten, etc.) is pretty good stuff on it&#39;s own and doesn&#39;t necessarily need to be called fake meat. Since I am a life-long vegetarian, now vegan, &quot;fake meat&quot; is just an umbrella phrase we veggies use for the said tofu, etc., and doesn&#39;t necessarily mean &quot;fake meat which is standing in for real meat.&quot; <br /><br />I think if you have a bad or less than satisfactory culinary experience with a specific dessert or food, it is probably not because of the lack of dairy or eggs but because it either was a poorly made food or your tastebuds just didn&#39;t enjoy that flavor/texture. You don&#39;t need dairy and eggs to make good quality, real food.

				As I mentioned above, these weren&#39;t bad at all, and if I needed to eat gluten-free I would be going there a lot.&nbsp; Likewise, I like some of the vegan (but containing wheat) pastries from Body &amp; Soul at the Greenmarket.&nbsp; But since I <span class="bbc_u">can</span> eat wheat, butter, eggs, etc., given the choice I&#39;d prefer to have the more standard pastries (if they&#39;re made well, that is--not cake mix junk or stuff loaded with preservatives).

				Vegan doesn&#39;t necessarily mean healthier.&nbsp; I&#39;ve looked at the nutrition labels of vegan baked goods sold at Whole Foods, and there are plenty of calories and fat in them.&nbsp; It&#39;s really hard to make &quot;healthier&quot; cookies, cakes, etc. without a whole lot of preservatives (e.g., Snackwell&#39;s).&nbsp; So eat the high-fat cupcake, but make it last for 4 servings&#39; worth (a trick I learned from doing Weight Watchers).

				I wasn&#039;t sure where to post this because it&#039;s kind of a limited subject and I felt weird about posting a new thread about it, but is it a commonly known fact that you can&#039;t digest whole flax seeds? If you want to get a health benefit from flax seeds, you should grind them. Otherwise you&#039;ll just poop the whole seed out. I&#039;ve seen oatmeals that boast containing flax seeds, but they are whole, and they just get pooped out.<br />Thanks everyone.&nbsp; :-D

				Well, initially I&#039;d just read it, but then I bought one of those aforementioned oatmeals. It was a box of three or four different oatmeal flavors (all organic), and one of them involved flax seeds. I was reluctant to eat that one as I noticed they were whole seeds, but then I did, and later on I found what I&#039;d read to be absolutely true.&nbsp; 8-)

				First thing: Pick up the <span class="bbc_u">The Vegan Guide To New York City</span> by Rynn Berry and Chris A. Suzuki. You can find it at just about any *local* bookstore and heath food store. It&#039;s a handy resource for just the situation that started this thread!<br /><br />No one has even mentioned one of my favorite vegan-ish restaurants in NYC, Pukk (http://www.pukknyc.com (http://www.pukknyc.com)) located on 1st ave. btwn 4th &amp; 5th Sts. As a Thai restaurant, I know it&#039;s &quot;Asian,&quot; but the food is AMAZING and the environment is funky and kinda Logan&#039;s Run-like. All the &quot;meats&quot; are soy and I&#039;m pretty sure their Thai iced teas are made with soy milk, which makes this a real treat for vegans, since this virtually never happens. There are a handful of noodle dishes that contain egg, which can be omitted just by saying the word. <br /><br />My other recommendations are:<br /><br />Candle 79 (Non-Asian -- For a more upscale and incredibly delicious sit-down dinner. Bring your carnivore friends.)<br />Candle Cafe (Non-Asian -- More casual &amp; less pricey than their &quot;79&quot; counterpart, but equally delicious.)<br />Zen Palate (Asian -- Upstairs for the finer menu; downstairs for the &quot;diner&quot; menu.)<br />Gobo (Asian - Offspring of the Zen P folks with a MAJOR upgrade in terms of menu and vibe. Simply outstanding.)<br />Pure Food &amp; Wine (Non-Asian/Raw -- At first, I thought room-temperature, raw, vegan food would be boring. I was blown away.)<br />Caravan of Dreams (Non-Asian/Semi-Raw -- An old favorite of mine and still good after all these years. Go for tea &amp; dessert.)<br /><br />Hope this helps!<br />Art(uro)

				Best vegan food I have found in Astoria is:<br /><br />Himalayan Teahouse, on 31st Avenue between 33rd and 34th Streets, around the corner from Brick. It is open every evening except Tuesday, and for lunch on weekends.<br /><br />They have veggie dumplings with dipping sauce, soba noodles with fresh veggies and a few excellent salads. Everything is under $10. (They also have beef and chicken dumplings.) Wine, beer and a huge tea menu.<br /><br />A charming little garden in the back with shade for the hot days.<br /><br />I live around the corner and am addicted to the beef dumplings, go once a week for a fix.

				Tuesday -- yeah, the awning does say &quot;Natural Market&quot; but it&#039;s really called Vitality and Health. I have no clue why they don&#039;t display the store&#039;s name anywhere! I&#039;m so happy it opened too, they opened the week I moved to NY/Astoria and I eat as organic as possible so it was like it was meant to be. :) Everyone should give them business, there are a lot of good people working there from what I have noticed. I still wish that a super healthy restaurant would open in Astoria.

				Stamatis on 23rd Avenue offers a variety of Vegan foods - string beans in tomato sauce, escarole, swiss chard, spinach with rice, stuffed veggies with rice, artichokes, lemon potatoes, okra in tomato sauce etc.&nbsp; At any given time, they have a number of offerings.&nbsp; He uses olive oil, not butter on these items.&nbsp; By the way, some folks do not like &#039;greasy&#039; foods.&nbsp; Personally, I do not feel that anything in olive oil is necessarily &#039;greasy&#039;.&nbsp; The more olive oil, the better for my family!&nbsp; We have maintained our weight for years by following a Mediterranean diet which includes lots of fish, lean meats, poultry, fruits, veggies and olive oil!

				Hey flinxt, you missed my earlier post?&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=3973.msg65424.html#msg65424">Quote from: DJArturo on March 30, 2007, 10:34:07 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">No one has even mentioned one of my favorite vegan-ish restaurants in NYC, Pukk (http://www.pukknyc.com (http://www.pukknyc.com)) located on 1st ave. btwn 4th &amp; 5th Sts. As a Thai restaurant, I know it&#039;s &quot;Asian,&quot; but the food is AMAZING and the environment is funky and kinda Logan&#039;s Run-like. All the &quot;meats&quot; are soy and I&#039;m pretty sure their Thai iced teas are made with soy milk, which makes this a real treat for vegans, since this virtually never happens. There are a handful of noodle dishes that contain egg, which can be omitted just by saying the word. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Himalayan Teahouse, at 33-17 31st Avenue between 33 &amp; 34th, has &quot;MOMO&#039;s,: steamed vegetarian dumplings that come in two types: one with organic tofu, shitake mushrooms, chickpeas and veggies with ginger &amp; garlic; and vegetable, made from fresh carrots, white cabbage, broccoli and spinach. $7.95 &amp; 8.95 for a generous helping with dipping sauce. <br /><br />They also have two types of organic soba noodles, a vegetable noodle soup and big salads. Everything under $10.<br /><br />I also just tried out the new Thai restaurant on Broadway, Leng, and had savory, highly spiced noodles in broth. Delicious. You can check out their menu at: www.lengthainewyork.com.

				Forgive me if anyone&#039;s already mentioned this and I didn&#039;t see it.... but....<br /><br />SAI Organics on 30th Ave and 36th St in Astoria has lots of vegan food, and they also just opened a restaurant also on 30th Ave, near the N/W train, I think between 31st St and 30th St. &nbsp; :rock:

				I was at Cafe Bar (aka Monicas - on 34th Ave @ 36th St) this weekend, and there was some mention in the menu about a farm-based vegan meal being prepared there Thursdays, made with the produce they receive from their CSA shares.
