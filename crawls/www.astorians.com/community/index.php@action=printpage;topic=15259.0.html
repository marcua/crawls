				Hi, <br />I am trying to help my daughter who just graduated from Penn State to find a studio apt. in Astoria, possibly as soon as August 2009. Several of her friends live there and have recommended the area to her because the commute to Manhattan is relatively short, and she is seeking employment or an internship in one of the theatres there.<br /><br />Since she is just starting her career, my daughter cannot afford to pay more than about $800/month (plus perhaps cable and Internet). Is Craigs list the best source for leads to the lower-priced options? Are there good options in this price range at all? Thanks for any advice you can offer.

				Your daughter might be better off finding a roommate or two than trying to get her own studio if she can&#039;t afford more than $800 rent. Craigslist is good for finding roommates.

				I agree with Essen.&nbsp; Finding anything in Astoria for under $1100 (plus utilities) will be challenging.&nbsp; A roommate situation is the way to go.&nbsp; Moving into an already established share will save on headache and costs - but she&#039;ll have less control than if she secured the apartment and then did the roommate selection herself.&nbsp;

				Speaking as a former theatre person who came to NY for work, I&#039;d also say you have to go with a share.&nbsp; Young and eager theatre folks are dime a dozen here, and therefore get paid squat for internships/first job out of undergrad. Also, she should also be prepared to supplement her income with some other kind of work.

				Hi, again.<br /><br />I appreciate your candor - thank you all for replying. <br /><br />I am not sure how one goes about screening potential roommates before one lives in the city. I guess we would have to stay in a hotel and have some pre-arranged &quot;interviews&quot; and site visits lined up.<br /><br />One other practical question - how close to the time that my daughter would like to move to the city should we start making serious inquiries? Should we be inquiring and reading ads now for early August move-in?<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br /><br />

				As someone who recently got herself a new roommate, I&#039;d say she shouldn&#039;t bother looking until she&#039;s close to be able to move in, and she really does need to get here to meet for in-person interviews. I appreciate that people may not be able to get here for a roommie interview immediately, and I gladly set up appointments for when they would be in town, but I wasn&#039;t about to invite someone to live with me if I couldn&#039;t meet them in person. I had some very nice-sounding people email me saying that they wouldn&#039;t be in town until June 1 (their desired move in date/when I wanted the room filled), but that they wouldn&#039;t be able to meet in person. From my perspective, that just wasn&#039;t safe/sane. There is also a lot to be said for two people who are living together to be able to be compatible....not necessarily &quot;friends&quot;, but it&#039;s important to be able to be comfortable with the person you&#039;re sharing an apartment with. And from their perspective...how would they know that they&#039;d want to live with me/in this apartment/on this block?<br /><br />If your daughter can crash on one of her friends couches for a weekend or two so she can go meet potential roommates (that she&#039;s already emailed and set up appointments with), that would probably be the best plan.<br /><br />For an early August move in, I&#039;d say she should start seriously looking in early/mid-July. Like, after the 4th. Start scanning Craigslist earlier though (it&#039;s pretty much the only thing people use here to find roommates, other than word-of-mouth), and email if someone says they have an opening for August 1. That said, there will be more listings for 8/1 toward the end of the month than the beginning. Email everyone who has an apartment to rent in Astoria, even if it sounds crappy/has no photo/whatever. A lot of them won&#039;t write back. If she finds a place she likes and is invited to move in, she should sign paperwork/get keys ASAP after agreeing, since things can fall through (it happened to me).<br /><br />And finally, and I promise that I&#039;m not saying this to be snarky or judgemental or anything, but....if someone emailed me looking for a room for their daughter, I probably wouldn&#039;t invite them for an interview. From my perspective as a leaseholder/roommate, it&#039;s not really in my best interest to have someone live with me who (apparently!) isn&#039;t taking the initiative to look up places themselves (am I gonna have to hound them for rent/to clean up after themselves/etc? there&#039;s also the &quot;every mom says their kid is great&quot; issue.) Again, I&#039;m just trying to be honest/helpful, and for all I know, she&#039;s already looking up places on her own and emailing people as I type. Plus, there&#039;s the &quot;are we compatible&quot; issue, which I wouldn&#039;t get from a 3rd party (mom) emailing me. Sure, you may have to co-sign for financial reasons or something, but if I had a room to rent, I&#039;m going to primarily deal directly with the person I&#039;d be living with.

				Hi, Alison,<br /><br />Thanks for sharing your perspective - it makes perfect sense to me (especially about wanting to communicate directly with the prospective roomie). There are two reasons why I as a parent am involved in the search for my daughter&#039;s lodging. Right now she is working at a short-term job (it ends July 26th) that is very demanding (10 to 12 hour days) and she has asked me to help her find some leads because she is exhausted. My daughter would be making the contact/writing the emails to prospective roommates. <br /><br />The primary reason that she is &quot;adrift&quot; regarding lodging is that the apartment that she had lined up slipped away from her (I won&#039;t go into the why&#039;s and wherefore&#039;s) so now she has nothing lined up.<br /><br />On a related topic, I realized last evening that finding a &quot;safe&quot; place to live is more complicated than I had thought. I was reading a thread in this forum that discusses some advice for women who know that they will be walking home alone from a subway station after 10:00 p.m. (For example, living within a 7-minute walk of the station seems to be a good rule of thumb.) My daughter would often be returning home to her apartment around midnight due to the work schedule of her internship/job.<br /><br />I would appreciate it if you or anyone else on this forum could point me to a detailed map of Astoria that shows the subway stations so that I could get some bearings on the street addresses that would be within that 7-minute walk radius. I know that I could hunt for such a map, but thought that since this forum appears to be visited by some very knowledgable (and friendly) folks, a couple of you might already know of a good map for this purpose.<br /><br />I also noticed that a poster mentioned a thread in which people discuss the &quot;good&quot; vs. the &quot;not-so-good&quot; realtors so I will be looking for that later this week in case we get desperate and need to pay a finder&#039;s fee (if that is what it is called).<br /><br />Thanks.<br />

I lived off of the Ditmars stop for a while and really enjoyed it for many many reasons, but I feel more comfortable coming home late now that I live on 30th Ave. 30th and Broadway seem to have more places open late, and that makes me more comfortable about my walk. I grew up near PSU in rural PA and I can be a bit of a wimp about walking around by myself so if I think it&#039;s okay, your daughter will probably be fine.

				You mentioned that your daughter has several friends who live in Astoria. &nbsp;Surely they can be providing her with info. &nbsp;That said, Astoria is quite safe for an urban environment. &nbsp;You will find many debates as to whether it is better to live near Ditmars or Broadway, these are preferences and both are safe. &nbsp;The general desirable parameters are: 21st Street to the West, Ditmars on the North, 34th Ave on South, 45th Street on the East. &nbsp;You can use Google Maps to find this area. &nbsp;<strong>But again, this is very general and there is plenty of debate.</strong> Best thing would be for your daughter to come visit her Astoria friends once or twice this summer before she begins her apartment hunt. &nbsp;

				kathkaree, you can zoom in on the Google map of Astoria which shows the subway stops. I can&#039;t seem to link directly to it. <br /><br />If you use a broker, they will not be helping you find a share--they will be helping you find an apartment to rent, and you will probably be paying a month&#039;s rent as a fee. I think there are roommate-finding services, but I&#039;ve always used Craigslist. <br /><br /><em>And finally, and I promise that I&#039;m not saying this to be snarky or judgemental or anything, but....if someone emailed me looking for a room for their daughter, I probably wouldn&#039;t invite them for an interview.</em><br /><br />This is very important. I lived in a four bedroom apartment for several years, and any potential roommate who had her parents involved in the search or had them come to the interview was automatically disqualified. Not fair, but that&#039;s the way it was. We had a bad experience with one roommate with a helicopter mom, and none of the rest of us were willing to put up with it again. We were all adults who wouldn&#039;t tolerate our own mothers calling our roommates to check up on us, and didn&#039;t appreciate having to keep tabs on a roommate in case her mom called us (oh, and she did). I understand why you&#039;re helping your daughter, but I would have her draft up an email that you can send as if you were her. You can find leads and send that initial email, but your daughter really needs to demonstrate to her potential roommate(s) that she will be pulling her own weight around the household as well, and not relying on her mom to do it for her, even when things are busy. <br /><br />The apartment I was supposed to move into when I moved here also slipped away from me at the last minute, through a miscommunication. I stayed in a hotel for two days, lined up as many appointments as possible, and found a roommate within 48 hours. I moved in the next day. I know that it&#039;s stressful not to know where she&#039;s going to live, but if she can crash on a friend&#039;s couch starting July 27, she will almost certainly be able to find an apartment that week. Even if you do no hunting for her.

				Oh man, do I understand what your daughter is going through regarding apartment hunting from out of town while working crazy hours. :) (I worked full-time in baseball up until I moved here, which meant 9-5, then working the games as well. Arg!)<br /><br />She should write up an email introducing herself that is generic enough to apply to whatever apartment, but friendly and personable. It can be copied &amp; pasted to ads. She doesn&#039;t need to ask too many questions right off the bat (that&#039;s what the in-person interview is for), but a paragraph or two introducing herself, saying what she does, when she&#039;s moving, and what date(s) she&#039;ll be in town to meet would be good. Then, if the person wants to meet her, they can set up an appointment. Even if she is working crazy hours, it really only takes 30ish minutes a day of scanning Craigslist and copying that email to people to get the ball rolling. And, she&#039;ll start to see the same apartments being listed several times, so she&#039;ll know who not to bother emailing again. Then, a few days before she gets here, she should email the people that she has appointments with saying &quot;hey, just confirming we&#039;re meeting on Saturday at 1&quot; or whatever - several times on my hunt, I&#039;d show up to find that the room was already filled and they hadn&#039;t bothered to tell me.<br /><br />As a walking time reference, I live at Steinway &amp; 21 Ave, and it&#039;s a 10 minute walk to the Ditmars stop on the N (which is actually closer to 23rd Ave, since the tracks don&#039;t go all the way to Ditmars. If you zoom in on the satellite, you can see the stairs just north of the Amtrak tracks. All the other stops are actually at their intersections - 36th Ave, B&#039;way, etc.) Google maps does walking directions now too.

				Oh, also, you say she has friends here - she should email them and ask them to keep an eye out for her/mention to their friends that they know someone who is looking for a place. I ended up finding my new roommate because I posted a link to my ad on Facebook. Then, a friend of a friend who was looking for a place saw it and mentioned it to another friend. Or something. (I&#039;m still wondering exactly what the chain was, but it was something like that.)<br /><br />Word-of-mouth can get you far :)

				Thanks again for all of the good advice and information. I will pass it on to the daughter unit. <br /><br />Just a footnote about the friends who live in Astoria......they could not find work in NYC so they have sublet their apartments and are working elsewhere (in theatre) for a while so they are not here to offer a place for my daughter to stay for a few days while she looks. Maybe things will improve by August or September and they will be back in town.

				As a native Astorian I have to weigh in on the boundaries thing... My western boundary has always been Crescent Street.&nbsp; Between Crescent and 21st Street can be pretty dicey most of the time, although it does vary depending on what avenue it is, but in general the farther you are from 21st Street the better, especially at night.&nbsp; I agree with what others said about walking the blocks and seeing what you feel comfortable with.<br /><br />For an out-of-towner new to the city I&#039;d try to get as close to a subway stop as possible, there&#039;s just more activity and it&#039;s safer when you get home late at night.&nbsp; I would say try to keep it between 28th and 34th Avenues, and Crescent and Steinway streets, to be safest.

				Hi, spellingwitch,<br /><br />I appreciate your advice. We are hoping to bring our daughter to Astoria this next Monday to look at a couple of rentals and a potential roommate/share.&nbsp; Right now we are considering a place that is at 29th Street and 36th Avenue - would that be in the &quot;not-a-good-idea&quot; zone because it is past 34th Avenue, or is it relatively safe? <br /><br />That intersection does not appear to be more than two blocks from the N station, and the &quot;street scene&quot; view in google maps does not appear dicey, but one cannot tell without being there. Are you familiar with that particular area? Since you are a native Astorian, I am thinking that you probably know the very block to which I am referring.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Dear newastorian35,<br /><br />Cool. I am glad to hear that the area is well-lit. We will try to get to NYC on Sunday night (it will be very late when we arrive) and go to that intersection to see what it is like. <br /><br />On that note, can you recommend any hotels in Astoria? We will only be staying on the night of July 5th. Monday is the day that we will be checking possible roommates and apartments.<br /><br />Thanks!

				Check out the new Holiday Inn that just opened a month or so ago and just one stop from 36th Avenue at the 39th Avenue stop on the train (you could easily walk it during daylight - not sure about night since I live at the other end of Astoria):&nbsp; http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/hi/1/en/hotel/lgali?rpb=hotel&amp;crUrl=/h/d/hi/1/en/availsearch&amp;ias=y)<br /><br />A quick search for Sunday night looks like you can get a room for about $125 which is bargain basement for NYC (and this really is a newly constructed hotel).<br /><br />BTW - I am not afflialited with this hotel in any way.

				C-J,<br />That was very considerate of you to include a link to the Holiday Inn that is in the vicinity of the apartment! That would make it much easier for us to see what the neighborhood is like at night because we would be driving through it.<br /><br />The only &quot;hitch&quot; now is whether the hotel provides parking.<br /><br />

				It looks like they do have a very few parking spaces available with a garage nearby:&nbsp; http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/hi/1/en/hotel/LGALI/at-a-glance?start=1&amp;rpb=hotel&amp;crUrl=/h/d/hi/1/en/availsearch&amp;ias=y

				Thanks! I will have to let you know whether we stay there. The other possibility is to book a room at a hotel near the realtor who will be showing us apartments.<br /><br />Hope you have a great Fourth of July holiday!

				I&#039;m not sure about hotels in the area, but C-J&#039;s suggestion will put you right on the N/W line--so you can get to any area in Astoria in minutes.&nbsp; Just keep in mind that if you walk from the 39th Ave stop to 36th Ave stop, it WILL feel shady at night... it gets a little deserted on 31st Street near 39th Ave.&nbsp; If you stay there, at night when you are checking out the area by 36th Ave, the best thing to do would be to get on the subway heading up towards Ditmars for 1 stop, and get off 36th Ave.&nbsp; I guess that would be most realistic, since your daughter plans to get off the subway late at night.

				Hi there!<br />When I first moved to NYC as a 21 year old actress with no money, I decided to get a room at the Webster Apartments in Manhattan on 34th and 10th. This establishment was started years ago by Mr. Webster who wanted to create safe and affordable housing for women pursuing careers in NYC. They charge you on a sliding scale based on income, and it is quite low. At the time I was there, six years ago, it was close to the price your daughter wants. And included in the price is breakfast and a hot dinner. It is kind of dorm style. It&#039;s women only and this is very strict. They have a gorgeous roof top garden and backyard garden where the ladies like to eat their meals. They have rehearsal studios, laundry facilities (that you pay for...quarters...), a t.v. room and sitting rooms. I made great friends there and it was a lot of fun. Her room will be a shoe box, but will include a bed, a desk, a dresser, a sink and closet. The bed will have bedding and she will be provided with towels. A maid service will come in daily (unless she requests otherwise) to change her linens and vaccum the floor. For toilets and showers, this is dorm style with several on each floor to be used by all the girls on the floor.<br /><br />It&#039;s very bosom buddies&nbsp; &nbsp;:lol:<br /><br /><br />It was such a great place for me to live as a young women venturing into NYC. It was a great launching pad for me to explore other living options while having a safe place. Plus I walked to all my auditions and never needed a metro card due to the location.<br /><br />I hope this helps! I just registered this morning for an account on here when I saw your question, because I got really excited &quot;oh Webster is perfect!!!&quot;<br /><br />She needs to apply online and the sooner the better:<br />http://www.websterapartments.org/<br /><br /><br />There are other similar facilities in NYC too.<br />http://www.thebrandon.org/<br /><br />I remember these being available but having trouble finding websites. Here&#039;s the info I found. Hopefully they aren&#039;t closed or something.<br />1. Gramercy Women&#039;s Residence : 17 Gramercy Park South : New York, NY 10003<br />Gramercy Women&#039;s Residence is located on the south side of beautiful and historic Gramercy Park just a few blocks from SVA&#039;s buildings on East 23rd and 21st streets. Gramercy provides female residents with a safe, comfortable living environment. Each apartment has a full kitchen and bathroom. Gramercy maintains a very stringent guest policy.<br /><br /><br />2. Evangeline Parkside. I think it&#039;s actually part of the Salvation Army&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br />http://mynakedcity.com/entityprofile.php?gvEnt=31744<br /><br />3. Jeanne D&#039;Arc Home‎ - more info »<br />http://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/2008/08/04/the-home-for-friendless-french-girls/<br />253 W 24th St, New York, NY‎ - (212) 989-5952‎<br />This is run by nuns/catholic charity, but you do not have to be Catholic to live there. <br /><br /><br />Anyway I can&#039;t recommend taking advantage of these housing facilities highly enough. It was empowering to be right in manhattan always knowing I could afford my rent and that I&#039;d always have food to eat. And it put me in a healthy state of mind to search for where I wanted to live more permanently and to work on my career.<br /><br /><br />

				Hi, astoriaactress,<br /><br />Thank you for sharing all of this information! I only wish that I had known how to identify these apartments sooner. (I kept thinking that there must be dorm-like rentals but the only one that I had found on my own featured one room with two sets of bunk beds and no privacy, and the landlord was trying to maximize occupancy of 4 people.) The Webster Apartments (especially their location) sound like an oasis amid all of the chaos of street names, conditions/restrictions, and high rents that one encounters in the ads. <br /><br />Just yesterday, I created a new post in which I explained how things worked out for us - it is called &quot;SUCCESS re: Apartment for August 2009.&quot; Although we just resolved my daughter&#039;s dilemma, I am sure that there are other young women who will be glad to hear about Webster Apartments and the other ones that you describe. Also, if my daughter encounters gaps in employment and can&#039;t find a month-to-month lease, she will know where she can reside (other than coming back home :wink:) while she figures out her next career move.<br /><br />Thank you again for your empathy and kindness.&nbsp;
