				Lately I&#039;ve been noticing a large number of out-of-state license plates parking on my street -- Tennessee, Alabama, North Carolina, Texas, and Massachusetts, in addition to the usual Connecticut and New Jersey. These are cars that park here every day and every night -- it&#039;s not like they&#039;re just visiting. Isn&#039;t there a law that requires you get NY plates within a certain amount of time after moving to NY? <br /><br />I know there are many more important things to grouse about, but when I spend 45 minutes driving around in circles looking for a parking spot when no less than 10 spots on my block are typically taken up by out-of-state cars, it gets to be incredibly frustrating. There have always been a few cars with Connecticut and NJ plates, but lately (within the last few months) it just seems like there&#039;s this huge influx of out-of-state cars. I wonder, are they just becoming more lax about enforcing the &quot;must get NY plates&quot; rule?<br />

				Yeah, the law requires that you do, but I guess it&#039;s pretty hard to enforce. I suppose the reason is that a lot of people move into Astoria from out of state because it&#039;s a good transition towards NYC without the insane prices. <br />In addition to that, NY car insurance rates are insane. To be honest, if I could register my car elsewhere and save on the insurance, I would do it.

				It could also be because of the primary elections tomorrow in NJ, CT and of course here. The out-of-staters could be campaign workers/volunteers who are being put up in the neighborhood while they do whatever they do in the run-up to the election. Have you noticed any candidate bumper stickers on the cars?

				Oooh, I had out-of-state plate drama.<br /><br />When I moved here from Connecticut about 2.5 years ago, I was a full time student and interning, so before I moved, I asked my insurance agent, and he told me that I didn&#039;t need to register my car in NY because I wasn&#039;t working. I would have if I thought I needed to. Of course, when I got rear-ended and had to file a claim, all hell broke loose about the whole out-of state thing, even though I had the car towed back to CT because that&#039;s where I &quot;officially&quot; (according to paperwork) lived. They found out (through credit reports, or the fact that my name is on the cable bill) that I had an apartment in Astoria, and tried to charge me more money for it, and my agent even called me a liar and threatened legal action (?!) when I mentioned that he told me I didn&#039;t need to switch my registration. (I know I couldn&#039;t have misunderstood him - I have an email exchange saying &quot;I&#039;m moving to NY to go to school, and I&#039;m taking my car with me. Do I need to switch my registration to NY?&quot; He replied &quot;no, as long as you aren&#039;t employed in NY, you don&#039;t have to register your car. It&#039;s like someone living in a dorm from out of state.&quot; Now I realize he only told me that because he wanted to keep his commission.) Then when I did switch my registration, I called that company&#039;s office here in Astoria, the guy who answered flat out refused to help me unless I could come in the next day at 2. (I couldn&#039;t, I had class. When I said, &quot;2 tomorrow isn&#039;t good for me,&quot; he replied, &quot;Well, I don&#039;t work over the phone, so if you can&#039;t come in tomorrow at 2, I can&#039;t help you.&quot;) Needless to say, I&#039;m no longer with that company. (And they&#039;re a big national company! &quot;On your side&quot; my butt.)<br /><br />ANYWAY.<br /><br />It actually turns out that it&#039;s cheaper for me to have my car registered in NY than it was in CT - CT has a yearly car tax, and my insuance here is actually a little bit less than it was there (although I am obviously with a different insurance company, and my deductible is a bit higher. I have made a couple small claims though, and I&#039;m still happy with them). I will say that that I&#039;m from (and my car was registered in) Bridgeport, where insurance and tax rates are pretty high.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=9350.msg110815.html#msg110815">Quote from: PJ on February 04, 2008, 02:17:14 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">your right, i was in that situation once, alittle cash made it all go away&nbsp; :wink:<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Not to be a goody-goody, but why bother when you can just register your car here and do things the right way and not have to be shady about it?

				Very weird! I suppose that&#039;s probably part of the reason for so many tolls and higher than average fuel prices.<br /><br />Any suggestions for insurance companies? Geico and Progressive are making me want to keep my car insured in NC, mostly because I don&#039;t see paying $300-400/mo as worth it.

				Try one of the small locals.&nbsp; I had the same issue when I was looking for car and motorcycle insurance.&nbsp; I sold the car before changing the plates over, but the rates went from ~$500 a year to over $1500.&nbsp; It was an $1800 car and made no sense with the little amount I used it, so I sold it.<br /><br />The moto is the same.&nbsp; I had Geico in TX and it was $350 a year.&nbsp; When I came up here, they wanted over $3000.&nbsp; I promptly deuced in my pants and set out to look for someone else.&nbsp; I found a small company up in Westchester that was a &quot;cheap&quot; $870 a year.<br /><br />Sometimes the small neighborhood guys can get better deals for you.

				Yes and it is illegal and if the police catch you after 90 days you&#039;re ticketed and if you&#039;re not caught by them, you will have aproblem if you need to make a claim. The company won&#039;t honor it.<br />Have to agree with 28 Grand, I was gonna post something similar, perhaps more gently but it is rather hypocritical besides being illegal.<br />These same folks who bitch about the hight rates as rationale for their scamming the insurance, are in fact contributing to the high rates.<br />It is uninsured and and crooked out of state insurers who contribute to the high rates here. <br />&nbsp;Maybe if everyone was legally insured here, the rates on average for everyone would be lower.<br />This is like people who think that shops factor shoplifting into the prices, so it&#039;s OK to steal. Sorry not buying it, and of course that practice has been going on for years too.<br />
