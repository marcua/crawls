				As some of you know, I started a new job this week (I&#039;m the new Executive Director of the Greenwich Village and Chelsea Chamber of Commerce).&nbsp; One of our projects, we are launching the first LGBT Career Fair in NYC.&nbsp; It will be on September 19, from 10 a.m. until 6 p.m. at the Metropolitan Pavilion - 125 West 18th Street.&nbsp; It&#039;s called Out to Work and we have a website - outtowork.com<br /><br />I&#039;m looking for contacts in HR departments to get folks to sponsor the career fair and take tables to take resumes and talk with possible applicants.&nbsp; We have over 400 folks already registered and expect a few thousand. Currently we have Google, Sovereign Bank, HSBC, Village Care and Verizon Wireless sponsoring the event - so it should be pretty successful.&nbsp; Any contacts at companies would be welcome, especially if they&#039;re able to get me to the right folks in the marketing or HR departments - company affinity groups for the LGBT community are often my best way in.<br /><br />If you know anyone to whom I should be talking, please pm me, email me or post it here (though without their contact information, so maybe PMs or emails would better).<br />Thanks!

				We have HSBC, Sovereign Bank, ConEd and Village Care as sponsors, Google, Fenwick-Keats, Aetna and AXA Advisors as exhibitors so far.&nbsp; Gay City News is our media sponsor and Out Professionals, the LGBT Center and HRC are co-sponsors!

				That&#039;s awesome, mcdirk!&nbsp; Good job!&nbsp; :mrgreen: I am surprised to see my bank in that list because I always saw them as stuffy and behind the times.&nbsp;

				It&#039;s coming along, but slowly!&nbsp; I just need to get folks to pay more attention in August, never an easy feat.&nbsp; I suspect they make me wait until early September, eek!

				Hey, I think this Out Astoria is an awesome idea and looking forward to attending the happy hour this Friday and hopefully many other of the events it looks like you have planned in the future. I will definitely be at that Outtowork as I am currently in need of a job - (just layed off) - which brings me to my next point - anyone know of any jobs out there - preferably dealing with gay issues and gay related, but not a necessity? I have a sales background and have worked for HX magazine and Gay.com. Just let me know - never hurts to ask! Will see you all Friday!
