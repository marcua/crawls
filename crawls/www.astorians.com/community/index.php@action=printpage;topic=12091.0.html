				How many people like Tequila Sunrise on Northern Blvd? I used to go there a lot but haven&#039;t<br />visit in sometime. The Mariachi Band always cracks me up after a few coronas, it goes something like this:<br />Appy birthday too jew, Appy birthday too jew ETC&nbsp; :-D The food is awsome or at least the best mexican food I&#039;ve<br />had in NYC

				I&#039;ve always liked Tequila Sunrise.&nbsp; They are expanding a bit and it seems to be taking forever.&nbsp; You have to be in the right mood to go there since it is VERY festive when the mariachi is going.&nbsp; <br /><br />The food is good but I think the food at Luna de Juarez is much better.

				I just ate at Tequila Sunrise this past weekend..and it was good.&nbsp; The fajitas were hot and delicious.&nbsp; Not to mention they make a mean Margarita.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=12091.msg149227.html#msg149227">Quote from: AJTNYC on September 03, 2008, 07:14:49 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;ve always liked Tequila Sunrise.&nbsp; They are expanding a bit and it seems to be taking forever.&nbsp; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I saw on one of the outside walls a stop order sign.&nbsp; Don&#039;t know what happened but that is probably holding up the construction.

				Yeah, tequila sunrise is solid in terms of food, but that construction is doing a number on their curb-appeal.&nbsp; I asked the waiter on my last visit when it would be completed and he said: &quot;next year.&quot;&nbsp; Well that sucks.&nbsp; I recommend the enchiladas poblanos.<br /><br />As to your comment about it being the &quot;best mexican food in NYC&quot;&nbsp; I have to disagree.&nbsp; Here are a few that are better:&nbsp; &nbsp;Alma (on columbia st. in BK), Dos Caminos (several manhattan locations), and there are quite a few good spots in Williamsburg, Bonita is one.&nbsp; I&#039;m even a big fan of El Rey, the taco truck and San Loco, which has locations in Manhattan and brooklyn.&nbsp; Of course, all of these places are on different tiers of mexican food quality.<br />

				You must have very poor taste in Mexican food because Bonita in Williamsburg is for the bums who live in the area.<br />They cater to that specific crowd, the place had some publicity for not so cool reputation. I am sure there is better<br />mexican food in NYC but so far, they tequila sunrise is number one. I&#039;ve been to some mexican restaurant that smells like mexico&nbsp; :oops:<br />the food wasn&#039;t all that or the location they reside in tells ya a lot of the clientèle. For presentation, freshness and service, tequila<br />sunrise is my favorite.&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen: :mrgreen:
