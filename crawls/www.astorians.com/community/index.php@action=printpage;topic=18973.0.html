				Title: <strong>Question about neighbors</strong><br />

				I live in an attached house. My neighbor has plants and bushes that are actually growing on the side of my building as well as hanging over to my side over the fence in the front. Whenever I attempt to approach them about this they say they do not understand English (not lying) except the time when I went out with clippers, they moved the trelles for the rose bush 6 inches and by the next day it was back. <br /><br />My question is don&#039;t I have the right to tell them that they cannot have anything x inches from my building? I am getting ants coming in because their plants lean on my windows. <br /><br />Thanks

				I would think if it&#039;s on your side of the fence then you have every right to trim it back.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure what the actual law is on this but that would make sense to me.

				First of all do u own the building or house ? If not , you should tell the owner or super first . Cutting anything down means you are destroying their property and even if its on your side , your can have legal problems .&nbsp; Try to speak to them , they have to know basic words , and see that its hanging over on your side at least . If not ,&nbsp; then get the police involved .

				Yes we own the house. The issue isn&#039;t that it is leaning on our side but it is leaning on and resting on our building. We have all tried speaking to them and their answer is either &quot;no speak English&quot; or &quot;it&#039;s my yard&quot;. They don&#039;t understand that at least common courtesy should stop you from haveing your jungle leaning on someone&#039;s house to the point that they can&#039;t see out their windows.

				I would talk to a lawyer and find out what exactly the law says first, but I am pretty sure that you are allowed to trim whatever parts of the foliage are growing on your property as long as you don&#039;t damage the root system.<br /><br />This is what I would do.<br /><br />1) Find out what exactly the law says regarding this.<br />2) Find a neighbor who speaks their language and can act as a translator. Explain to them that you want them to remove the parts of the plants that are growing on your house/property because you are worried about damage or whatever.<br />3) If they refuse, explain the law and that you are going to have it done yourself.<br /><br />Obviously, once you proceed with #3 you will likely ruin whatever semblance of a civil relationship you have with your neighbors, so make sure it&#039;s worth it first.

				I&#039;m almost positive you have every right to trim any of your neighbor&#039;s brush that overhangs your property.<br /><br />If I were you, I&#039;d call a landscaper and tell them the situation and inquire about the legality of it.&nbsp; They&#039;d be able to tell you.&nbsp; Then do it yourself.&nbsp; Document the current conditions with pictures in the event it goes to court.
