				I like Panera, but it&#039;s overpriced for what it is. Good soup, vegetarian options, and excellent baked goods. Not sure if it will go over well in this neighborhood, but it&#039;s definitely better than an Applebees.<br /><br />(btw, for those who don&#039;t know, Panera is like Au Bon Pain -- sandwiches, soups, salads, etc.)

				Panera is much less offensive to me than Applebee&#039;s. We have one in my hometown and I would occasionally get a iced chai tea or something. Not great, but not horrible.&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				They have their menu on their website, including all the nutrition info and even exact ingredients for what goes into everything, even when it&#039;s not too flattering, like those I.C. drinks. I.C. Cappuccino Chip (http://www.panerabread.com/menu/nutrition/profile.php?id=58) :-o<br /><br />Most of their stuff isn&#039;t that bad, but I thought that one was entertaining. Kind of ironic that the worst things they serve are the beverages. Still might stop by for the iced chai though, that one&#039;s not so bad.

				I hope it&#039;s Panera! My friends and I sometimes trek to Hoboken just for the Panera bread. I find a tad bit less sketchy than Au Bon Pain...And it&#039;s just a place I&#039;d always go to back home where I could get a good salad, sandwich, soup, or awesome bread.

				I notice there&#039;s a new restaurant named &quot;Valverde&quot; that&#039;s going to be opening on the southwest corner of 36th Avenue and Steinway Street in a place that used to be a burger joint. The awning says something like &quot;Artisan Italian Food&quot; on it, so I&#039;m kind of hoping it might be something really worthwhile. Anyone know anything more about it?

				It&#039;s definitely Panera!&nbsp; I e-mailed the company and here&#039;s their reply:<br /><br />Thank you for contacting Panera Bread. Our New York franchisee plans todevelop bakery-cafes in NYC. It&#039;s too soon to say exactly where all ofthe bakery-cafes will be located, but we have opened the first one inthe Bronx on Baychester in January 2007 and one on Staten Island thisspring. If all goes as planned, we will be opening a new bakery-cafe inQueens on 35th Ave. later this summer. Thank you again for contacting us. We hope you will enjoy Panera Breadin your neighborhood soon.Sincerely,AliceCustomer Comment Coordinator

				looks to be space for two businesses.&nbsp; One, yes, is definitely a Panera.&nbsp; But that leaves the larger &quot;corner&quot; space for something else.&nbsp; Might still be an Applebees, which is great cuz i really got a hankering for the Buffalo Ranch Chicken Finger Popper Platter.

				Well, on the sign next to where they are opening up Panera, its listed as storefront not restaurant so maybe its not going to be an Applebee&#039;s and it sure as hell looks like a Barnes and Noble to me. And in a lot of places outside NY, Panera and B&amp;N go hand in hand.

				B&amp;N will buy books at a price and pay the author full royalties on a certain quota of books, but they have a clause in the contract that if they can&#039;t sell the books at full price, the author will have to pay them back the royalties on any unsold or discounted books. It&#039;s a pretty nasty practice and I&#039;ve seen it bankrupt writers. It&#039;s really only B&amp;N that does it, as far as I know, but their purchasing power is too immense to get it out of the contract. The only authors that have the power to turn them down can pretty much be assured their books will sell enough copies to meet the B&amp;N&#039;s inital quotas and won&#039;t risk their relationship with the retailer.

				It&#039;s a pretty trashy system. I only know about it because several writers I knew in Boston had some rough legal times dealing with them.

				That&#039;s so odd, I&#039;m surprised we haven&#039;t heard more about that, because B&amp;N is so full of books by so many authors, and we don&#039;t seem to hear more of these reports of writers going bankrupt.&nbsp; Is the practice reported on any websites or in the news?&nbsp; What does B&amp;N have to say to defend itself?&nbsp; Personally, I&#039;m a big Amazon user, because it&#039;s cheaper, but I would still love to see a bookstore in the area (better than the one on Broadway).&nbsp; I love books and almost have to avoid bookstores completely, for fear I will buy way too many.&nbsp; B&amp;N, Shakespeare and Co, and Posman books display their books so well, it makes me want to buy all the them!&nbsp; It&#039;s dangerous!

				I think before any conclusions are drawn, more information is needed. I don&#039;t know much about books and contracts, etc., but B&amp;N must be doing something right. I&#039;m not about to boycott a system that clearly represents many many many authors. I don&#039;t doubt that there are shady practices, but aren&#039;t there everywhere. I&#039;d like to research the facts. I know of some local booksellers that engage in &quot;questionable&quot; practices as well.

				The issue is that B&amp;N&#039;s practices only hurt the small time, relatively unsuccessful authors. It mostly only hurts the unheard ofs.

The only authors that have the power to turn them down can pretty much be assured their books will sell enough copies to meet the B&amp;N&#039;s inital quotas and won&#039;t risk their relationship with the retailer.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Why not ban everything corprate and go leave in the woods eating berries and hunting your own food?<br />I don&#039;t want to sound harsh but comon.<br />Is there 1 corpration in this world that does everything perfect? NO.<br />you can find faults with every company no matter what do they do.<br />when you buy a book do you ask where the paper it was printed on came from? who produced the ink?<br />What if the paper came from a factory in China and was made by 8 year old kids getting paid 2 cents a week? Can we actually go through life checking every single purchase we make to see where and how it was produced.<br />All the people here ask is a B&amp;N so they can go spend the afternoon in drinking coffee and maybe meeting a guy/girl in the process.<br />I feel bad for authors who get screwed by B&amp;N but I got to tell you that an Authers gets screwed by so many people along the way to being published that by the time B&amp;N gets to them they are fully raped by the system.

				I can&#039;t disagree with you PF, but I wasn&#039;t saying that everyone should boycott them or that other bookstores are different, just what has happened to my friends and things I&#039;ve seen. I don&#039;t claim that this makes B&amp;N and their customers sinful, I&#039;m just saying that it doesn&#039;t sit right with me.<br /><br />There are a few rare things that I find to be important and certain people I want to give my money too. I don&#039;t have much, but that means where and with whom I spend it matters more to me. This is my stitch--you don&#039;t have to share it, but it is what it is. (Or it is how its function defines it [Wittgenstein, anyone?])<br /><br />I certainly don&#039;t hate people who like B&amp;N and I&#039;ve bought things there before, but I am weary of their sale books and I&#039;d rather buy a new translation of a Russian novel rather than the older uncopyrighted reprints they assemble. It&#039;s what I try to do to support the authors I think ought to be supported for their work.

				I work for a big publishing company and have never heard of B&amp;N being responsible for paying royalties to the authors they carry...you must mean the authors that B&amp;N, the publisher, publishes and carries in their stores....as far as the contract is concerned, that is usually between the writer and the publisher and whatever the publisher has with different resellers like Walmart, Costco, B&amp;N and others, but it is not typically or directly between the author and the reseller, unless that is B&amp;N&#039;s own writer.

				I liked the two Paneras I&#039;d been to. And this one -- on paper -- seems like a great idea, a place for me and my wife to get a sanwich before seeing a movie down there.<br /><br />BUT. I don&#039;t have confidence that the service will be any good. Why? Based on what I&#039;ve experienced at non-independent stores in New York versus elsewhere. And chain eateries here seem to have a near monopoly on bad service.<br /><br />Here&#039;s my prediction: this Panera will look and ffeel the same, but the service will suck bad.<br /><br />That said, I hope I&#039;m wrong.

Served on a foccaccia style bread that was plump, chewy and nice touch of olive oil(???)&nbsp; Sandwich came with Panera brand potatoe chips that were super crisp and not oily or too salty.&nbsp; Asked for a glass of water instead of a bottle and got it with no upselling attempt, just a smile.&nbsp; <br /><br />Got a booth next to an outlet for my laptop and tried for the wifi.&nbsp; No luck but had my wireless modem so not a problem for me.&nbsp; 3 minutes later my meal was ready.&nbsp; Very calm and efficient service at the counters followed by a manager(???) walking around wiping tables and eventually asked to take my tray away.&nbsp; <br /><br />Over all I&#039;d give them a two thumbs up.&nbsp; Good price, fresh and tasty food, clean and nice environment.

				I stopped by yesterday, and found it to be a fine addition to the neighborhood. It&#039;s nicely decorated, and the music is pleasant and unobtrusive. I didn&#039;t stay, but got a chicken pomodoro focaccia as take-out. Although I thought it was a bit pricey, the sandwich was quite good. I think I&#039;ll be going there fairly regularly.<br />With the free WiFi and the good food and service, they ought to be giving Starbucks and Cup some real competition.

				Been there twice now.&nbsp; Both times exceptionally nice (maybe a bit too much but they are new and management is around), very friendly service and zero mistakes.&nbsp; 2nd time there the cashier was unsure of a salad ingredient and asked another server next to her.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t bother me at all.&nbsp; <br />Good salad and sandwich<br />Good brewed iced tea<br />Good comfortable seating<br /><br />Would definitely go back.

				I&#039;m OBSESSED with Panera. I&#039;ve recently moved up here from Florida and I was literally at Panera at least once a week. I&#039;m going tomorrow - can&#039;t wait!

				Am I the only one who&#039;s a little surprised that all the foodies on this board seem to like Panera? I never thought a place like that would garner a food-fan&#039;s praise.

				Well.. I don&#039;t know, para.&nbsp; I consider myself to be pretty passionate about good food, and I still love this place!&nbsp; 8-)&nbsp; I understand where you&#039;re coming from, this place <em>is</em> a chain and not <em>nearly</em> as good as some of the mom and pop places here in Astoria....but I think between the nice flavors and overall good service, cheap prices, aaaand comfy atmosphere/free wifi, it&#039;s just a happy experience when you&#039;re there.&nbsp; Honestly, I&#039;ve been dying to go since it opened but just haven&#039;t gotten around to it.&nbsp; Have you been to Panera and found it not worth the hype?

				I was wondering that too - why all the praise for Panera?&nbsp; Can someone explain what the difference is between an Applebee&#039;s and a Panera that makes the former so reviled and the latter so loved?&nbsp; <br /><br />

				It&#039;s probably a matter of quality. It seems from the posts that for the most part Applebees is consistantly crap (hence the nickname Crapplebees) and Panera is mostly consistently good.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a matter of hating ALL chains. It&#039;s just hating chains that suck.

First of all, they&#039;re completely different. &nbsp;The menu at Panera is mainly 4 or 5 soups, salads, and sandwiches. &nbsp;Applebee&#039;s has got all these more complex (not always a good thing) dishes which they never really get right. &nbsp;The service at Applebee&#039;s is downright despicable. &nbsp;I have not ONCE had an enjoyable experience there - every time I get attitude from either the host and/or my waiter. &nbsp;Dishes are almost never served how they should be, they&#039;ve been cold or lacking the main ingredients!<br /><br />Panera, on the other hand, prides itself on its good service - and I can say this with some sort of authority as I have frequented the one by my hometown on LI way too many times to count, and it is definitely a noticeable characteristic of the place. &nbsp;They&#039;re always doing the best they can to serve you, and are happy to get the manager to answer any questions that they cannot. &nbsp;I know I sound like I work there at this point, but I&#039;m just happy to see a chain that actually treats the customer like a guest rather than an annoyance.

				I like the baked goods at Panera and having another place to hang out in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Clean tables are a plus, as the ones at Starbucks are usually coated with coffee/sugar/whatnot and never seem to get wiped clean.
