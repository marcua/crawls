				Well my friends, it finally happened.&nbsp; There have been some good ones and plenty of bad ones. But now we have something special in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Ovelia on the corner of 30th ave and 34th street is a real find (and once again discovered by wife Jen and forced upon me), The food, ahhh the food.&nbsp; Greek food done right!<br /><br />First lets talk about the decor.&nbsp; Not bad, a bit of a mix but not bad.&nbsp; Nice glasses, tables, lighting.<br />Service was very nice and attentive.&nbsp; The place did seem rather pricey and higher end looking than other places in the hood. <br /><br />The wine list had many Greek wines to choose from ($20-$60) and a small selection of other wines. Bar looked stocked but didnt really give it a good look. <br /><br />We started with the trinity ($15) of tarama, tzitziki and caponata/babaganoush.&nbsp; You could taste the fish roe and not salty at all, sublime. The baba was fire roasted and smooth with chunks of tomato, excellent.&nbsp; Tzitziki was very nice. All served with toasted seasoned pita and toasted Italian bread.&nbsp; A great starter, too much for just two people but well worth it for the taste.<br /><br />Dinner was a Market price ($19 very cheap for what they served) whole red snapper which was char grilled and perfectly seasoned and crisp with a very tender flesh. Absolutely perfect and without fault.&nbsp; Dish came with choice of one side, I had broccoli rabe, it was good.&nbsp; We also had a casserole of shrimp wrapped in eggplant slices in a tomato type sauce. Once again a sublime dish.&nbsp; Jen really loved it.<br /><br />They forced a dessert on us. Pretty much light pillowy zeppoli&#39;s covered in honey syrup and cinnamon. WOW!<br /><br />Met the owners Mark and Chris. Very nice guys. Mark&#39;s dad (a chef of many many years) is running the kitchen prep and recipes. making sure they do it right back there in the kitchen.<br /><br />So what I&#39;m saying here is please try it. Love it and pass it on to another lucky soul in need of a great meal.&nbsp; Hopefully the food and service will stay at this level and we have a new and solid addition to the Astoria family of fine restaurants.&nbsp; Let&#39;s support Ovelia, they certainly deserve the attention and patronage.<br /><br />Stay tuned for some other insights from Jen.

(Thursday is the official launch.) There haven&#39;t been many major additions to the neighborhood&#39;s Greek scene in recently; Anna&#39;s Corner and Ploes are more than a year old. Typically enough, the emphasis at Ovelia is on dishes cooked on a charcoal grill or in a gas rotisserie. Intriguingly, the new restaurant makes its own sausage in-house, which should make a nice alternative to the grilled fish and doner kebab. And there&#39;s a full liquor license for those of you who&#39;d also like a cocktail.<br /><em>Ovelia, 3401 30th Ave., at 34th St., Astoria; 718-721-7217.</em></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Sounds fantastic- may have to try it this weekend!&nbsp; Thanks for the review.&nbsp; <br />I have been a little underwhelmed by the Greek food in our nabe - Agnanti is the best I&#39;ve had so far, Kyklades was good, but neither were fantastic&nbsp; So I look forward to trying something new!

				i&#39;ve been walking by that place for a couple of weeks trying to figure out just what exactly it was! Its the old Dacine space. i&nbsp; thought it was a bar called Night* Day* or something like that. Its kinda weird looking on the outside but i do like the artwork on the inside. Now that you have spoken so highly of it, well hot dog i just have to go give it a try&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				It says &quot;Psistaria&quot; on one of the windows, which means &quot;Grillhouse&quot; in greek. At first I was concerned that they were opening another open air coffee/bar places. But this place looks nice, and the cuisine seems promising, definitely going to try it out soon. <br /><br />All the decent greek restaurants in the area are gone (Karyatis on Broadway was the best), which is strange for such a heavy greek populated neighborhood.

				It&#39;s like the way Little Italy went.&nbsp; Italians moved out, but still kept coming back for the food.&nbsp; Over time, as the person behind the plate was more often [INSERT ETHNICITY HERE] rather than Italian, restaurants didn&#39;t have to go through the expense to furnish an authentic product.&nbsp; Now it&#39;s a tourist trap.&nbsp; Why ought the Greek restaurants offer up the real deal if the yuppies are willing to pay twice as much for a crappier product?<br /><br />Greeks have been hemmoraging out to the burbs for a decade or so.&nbsp; Someday, while sitting in that Suffolk county split level ranch, they&#39;ll wax nostalgically to their children about their haylcon days in Astoria.&nbsp; But that&#39;s a rant of a different color&nbsp; :-D<br /><br />&nbsp;I still think Kyklades has a great snapper.&nbsp; Get it with a proper side of Horta and a bottle of Heinekin on a summer&#39;s evening and life is good.&nbsp; But I&#39;ll give Ovelia a try.

				Tried Ovelia for the first time last night.&nbsp; It was awesome!&nbsp; Didn&#39;t see the hot waiter though&nbsp; :-(&nbsp; But the owner was friendly and talkative.&nbsp; We had the shrimp wrapped in eggplant, the red snapper, salad, grilled octopus, and the zuchini fritters.&nbsp; The zuchinni was amazing, so different than regular fritters, you have to try them.&nbsp; All the food was great, down to the bread.&nbsp; And the atmosphere and decor was fun too.<br /><br />I do think they need to do something about that back wall, it looks like a kitchen with all its cabinets, yet it&#39;s just being used as decoration.&nbsp; It doesn&#39;t really fit with the rest of the place.&nbsp; The Coronas were served warm.&nbsp; And I still have yet to find a place that will fillet my fish for me.&nbsp; Cavo remains my favorite restaurant - they are the only place that has ever filleted my fish right in front of me, and expertly at that.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think a lot of people know how to do it well.&nbsp; The red snapper was amazing though, just be careful for the bones.<br /><br />I highly recommend the place.&nbsp; Thumbs up.

				Thanks for the recommendations, folks! Victorine and I and a friend of hers went there last night for dinner, and it was very good! We had the taramosalata, which comes with great pita and bread, and was just about the best I&#39;ve had. (And I tend to order the taramosalata at any Greek restaurant...) Based on recommendations from here, we also got the surprisingly tasty (despite the dill) zucchini fritters and the excellent sausages. And the three of us split the Red Snapper with potatoes and broccoli rabe. The fish was excellent, with a salty, spicy rub, but the sides were fairly uneventful. As also reported, the gratis zeppolli was excellent. :) <br /><br />It also had excellent decor and service. All of the waitstaff greeted us as we walked in and out. They clearly spent time and money on the interior, and it shows. Very comfortable, trendy, and eclectic, and would not feel out of place in SoHo. <br /><br />As a geek, I also was amused by the (possibly accidental) quipu (http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.01/khipu.html?pg=1&amp;topic=khipu&amp;topic_set=) behind the bar...<br />

				Just tried it a few nights ago.&nbsp; Great, fresh authentic Greek food.&nbsp; Loved it.<br /><br />DON&#39;T miss the sausage - I was a little leary of homemade sausage but happily impressed by its fresh flavor and interesting spices.&nbsp; The roast pork was super juicy and delicious, too.

				Tried Ovelia last evening and was more than pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Started with their signature salad, great with roasted eggplant and walnuts...very tasty.<br />Followed some of the info on this post and went with the idea that this was a grill house...so we ordered a bottle of red, an appetizer of their house sausage and two main courses...lamb chops (4) and pork chops (2).&nbsp; The sides served with the main course were happily not over cooked and plentiful, and the meat was cooked to perfection...it is very hard to find restaurants that do not over cook pork these days.<br /><br />DO NOT GO THERE WITHOUT HAVING THE HOUSE SAUSAGE IT IS INCREDIBLE!!!<br /><br />Oh yeah, almost forgot..we were served by the &quot;bunned-one&quot; so popular on this post...by the way, his name is Jeremy!!!!

				I was also at Ovelia last night! The food was very good. What I didn&#39;t like about it was the music.. horrendously loud over my delicious food. Loud dance music. One song was particularly egregious with the bass resounding through the restaurant and hurting my ears, and it seemed to quiet a little after that, but it was still pretty bad. However, I would go back because the food was so good. I also recommend the homemade sausages. Even the pita they serve before the meal is excellent.

				I know I already posted on Ovelia but I just went there again - this time for lunch.&nbsp; Had the amazing sausage (again) - and it was . . . amazing.&nbsp; I had some sort of doner - beef and pork mixed - it was tasty but a little oily - as was the sausage - everything was a little oilier than I prefer - but it still tasted good!

				I have been to Ovelia a few times and it is quite good, although the service was rather slow at times (but always friendly).<br /><br />For those of you who want good Greek food, you also should try:<br /><br />Stamatis on 23rd Avenue - Great Pasticho and Moussaka, very nice Tispoura, which is a Porgy.<br /><br />Zenon Taverna - on 31st Avenue.&nbsp; Good Cypriot cuisine, particularly the souvlaki and Sheftalia (Cypriot sausage-like item).<br /><br />Agnandi - on Ditmars Blvd.&nbsp; You can&#039;t go wrong.

				We braved the awful weather and went to Ovelia for dinner.&nbsp; What&#039;s funny is that my mom and brother were babysitting and they ordered in from Ovelia, but had no menu, so they just talked to the woman on the phone and figured out what they should order.&nbsp; [They don&#039;t have a website... yet, she said.]<br /><br />And while they were getting that, we went and ate there.&nbsp; We had Skordalia and zucchini croquets.&nbsp; The skordalia was good, but really about normal for the neighborhood.&nbsp; I&#039;ve made it as good, but it was a big old mound of it and I didn&#039;t have to make it.&nbsp; The croquets were yummy and there were EIGHT of them.&nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, I also got a cocktail called &quot;The Tango&quot; that was tasty.<br /><br />Erin had a mixed lamb and beef thing and I had the grilled salmon with lemon potatoes.&nbsp; It definitely lived up to the hype on this thread!&nbsp; Great stuff and the staff was super friendly and made sure to make us feel welcome and want to come back.&nbsp; Oh and the gratis dessert (which was like zeppolis, but the waitress called it something else) was soooo good!&nbsp; They were super hot and the first one I bit into spewed honey all over the place, but after I stabbed and flattened it, I could eat it without making too much of a mess. mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm&nbsp; <br /><br />My mom and brother were happy with what they got, too.&nbsp; They left leftovers in the fridge.&nbsp; I&#039;ll have to check that out tomorrow.&nbsp; &nbsp;:evil:

				Just as an addendum to my previous message, I had some major stomach issues that woke me up about 2:00am that night (nausea).&nbsp; I don&#039;t think the food was bad, but upon reflection, I think the &quot;grilled salmon&quot; was actually fried in butter.&nbsp; It was delicious, but my system isn&#039;t used to eating a lot of butter (probably in the potatoes, too).&nbsp; So, if you&#039;re health conscious, beware!

				Used to be a Ploes fan (before it changed hands and menus last year), so have been looking out for a new favorite Greek.<br /><br />Sadly I don&#039;t think Ovelia really stacks up.<br /><br />Yes, very friendly service (drinks very slow)<br />Yes, sausage is awesome (but pricey)<br />Salad, was just OK<br />Rotisserie lamb special, as suggested by the staff. Extremely fatty and flavorless.<br /><br />It&#039;s another OK Greek restaurant in Astoria.<br />

				Ploes was sold last year and the large menu was changed to one page and a lot pricier for the serving size. I miss the grilled mixed seafood and meats, and the farmers salad.

				I miss the old Ploes too - it&#039;s a completely different menu now. Also, their wine was good, and cheap. Ovelia&#039;s wines and beers are pretty expensive, but I must say the men&#039;s bathroom is very cool.

				I guess I didn&#039;t get there often enough to notice big changes in the menu.&nbsp; It definitely did get pricier, but they have such a wide selection that I didn&#039;t mind it much.&nbsp; They don&#039;t have the friendliest service though.

				The food here was very tasty.&nbsp; Two friends and I split 4 mezes: the assorted dips, grilled pork, house sausages, and grilled octopus.&nbsp; Everything was great, especially the octopus--so sweet and tender.<br /><br />BUT!!!!<br /><br />We made the mistake of going yesterday around 6 PM, right after all the Greek Independence Day festivities.&nbsp; This might have been the first nice day they had, with the outdoors tables set up, and they were completely slammed.&nbsp; We waited 45 minutes for the first plates of food to come out (we suspect the waitress had forgotten to enter our order) and were well into eating before we got napkins.&nbsp; We saw drinks and food going to wrong tables, and just a general air of cluelessness among all the servers.&nbsp; Hopefully, this won&#039;t be a trend as we move into warmer weather.&nbsp; Also, the Greek dance music was blaring.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen live jazz players there during the week, so I hope this was only because of the parade and won&#039;t be a regular weekend thing.

				This is my favorite in the nabe. I particularly love the Shark...to die for. I keep looking at other things, but this was just so damn tasty. The zeppoli&#039;s are fab, too.<br /><br />Traditional Greek? I sort of think of it as being to Greek food what Emeril&#039;s is to New ORleans food.

				I&#039;m voting for Uncle George&#039;s to have the best Greek food in Astoria.&nbsp; Does anyone agree?&nbsp; And I think leaving Aliada (Broadway and 30th Street) off the list is an egregious error as well.&nbsp; Nice atmosphere and solid food with good prices.

I believe we ended up at Stamatis that evening.<br /><br />Ultimately, it was the service that did the place in for us, and it&#039;s a shame because I enjoyed the food there (when it was warm, that is!).

				As much as I hate resurrecting a 5 year old post, I have a few questions about this place.&nbsp; My mother in law is in town this weekend and we let her pick dinner on Friday.&nbsp; She did a little research and came up with Ovelia.&nbsp; My question is, has anyone been recently?&nbsp; I&#039;ve never tried the place and I want to make sure it hasn&#039;t gone downhill over the years.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for the help.&nbsp;

				Agreed.&nbsp; My husband and I went a few weeks ago and he had a scallop dish that was amazing.&nbsp; We also had stuffed&nbsp; squid that we skewered.&nbsp; It was pretty damned unique and tasty.
