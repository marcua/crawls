				We had some Jive Turkey for lunch today, in fact. My co-worker collected $20 from each of us (about 10 people) and picked it up in Brooklyn (they don&#039;t deliver this time of year.) <br /><br />I was expecting something like KFC, but instead it was a flavorful outer crust and very succulent meat throughout- not bad at all! The &quot;Yams brulee&quot; were mashed sweet potatoes w/mini marshmallows and pineapple bits- not a crowd pleaser with the pineapple. Also had regular mashed, green beans with onions, and stuffing- pretty standard. <br /><br />This is great if you have to entertain, but don&#039;t want to go nuts cooking and don&#039;t want to spend a fortune elsewhere. BUT, it&#039;s a long way to go for take-out when you&#039;d do just fine for the same price (actually, less!) eating out here in town. Normally, I&#039;d refuse to pay $20 for a basic lunch (it&#039;s not like I piled it all on) but I didn&#039;t want to be a wet blanket. Besides, I did want to try fried turkey at least once!
