				I think this has been discussed here before. This video is in regards to the building on 37Th Street between Broadway and 34Th avenue which looks to be abandoned but actually isn&#039;t. <br /><br />If this person doesn&#039;t pay fines on the building who is paying to put the scaffold up in front of the building, the city? <br /><br />http://www.myfoxny.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail;jsessionid=94E6B15C296F10B12D0E3EBCC3941B29?contentId=7592179&amp;version=2&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=VSTY&amp;pageId=1.1.1&amp;sflg=1 (http://www.myfoxny.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail;jsessionid=94E6B15C296F10B12D0E3EBCC3941B29?contentId=7592179&amp;version=2&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=VSTY&amp;pageId=1.1.1&amp;sflg=1)

				I grew up over there.&nbsp; I&#039;m AMAZED that someone actually lives in there.&nbsp; I was always under the impression that it was abandoned.&nbsp; When I saw the scaffolding, I thought the building was finally going to be rehabbed -- guess not.&nbsp; I feel for the surrounding neighbors.<br /><br />&nbsp;:mrgreen:

				I live in the area and I also can&#039;t beleive that someone lives there.&nbsp; I have seen the guy who lives there on occassion walking down the street.&nbsp; I do not know what could be done about it, the city just keeps giving him fine after fine.&nbsp; He is never going to pay them.

				That building is a dump and I&#039;m shocked to find out that someone lives in there.&nbsp; What I can understand is how the city can be so helpless to do some thing about this.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t pay your property taxes the government can foreclose on your home.&nbsp; How does a guy get away with not paying over $100,000 in fines and is allow to still live there?&nbsp; Why not seize the property?

				I&#039;ve lived around the corner from this house for a long time and I also know that the man who lives there is going around with a walker in public so he can keep getting disability payments from the city. He is in perfect physical health as can be attested by me seeing him in his backyard doing laborious work in his garden.

He&#039;s probably getting free medical care as well as collecting SSI! How can he afford a lawyer from Romania if he can&#039;t afford to pay for building repairs? I feel really sorry for the poor neighbor living next to that rat-hole of a building.
