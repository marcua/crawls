				Hey. I had this done very recently and I have one very important peice of advice that I wish someone would have told me:<br /><br />By all means, get your doctor to give you a single dose of your <strong>EXACT PAIN PRESCRIPTION *BEFORE* THE SURGERY.</strong><br /><br />I&#039;m not allergic to pain killers. Not percocet, not codine, not nuttin&#039;. But I am apparently allergic to what ever it is that makes pain killers liquids. Getting your stomach pumped while your throat already feels like a buttload of suck is a big no fun.<br /><br />This should also go with any ANY medical procedure ever. Ask for one dose of the painkiller first so that you can be positive that the specific brand, dose and the like is one that your body can handle.<br /><br />Apparently the first time I had a reaction to this medication it was in smaller doses and was blamed on me having the stomach flu (Dentist said I had the worst recovery of any wisdom teeth removal he&#039;d ever seen but no one blamed the pain killer). When the tonsils came out, the dose was higher and it could have been much, much worse than it was.<br /><br />If you want more details or have more specific questions, lemme know. I just went through this all a little more than a year ago, so it&#039;s pretty recent.

				I had my tonsils removed at age 30 (nearly three years ago) and it wasn&#039;t much fun but I survived. &nbsp;My ENT gave me pill form of the painkillers and I was able to swallow them with little/no trouble. &nbsp;I had cryptic tonsilitis so am really glad I had the procedure done (which is surprisngly quick btw).<br /><br />As for pain, etc I just felt like I had a really bad sore throat for about a week. &nbsp;Not sure if your dr mentioned it but it&#039;s common in adult cases to get ear pain after a day or so which was the worst part for me (imagine someone boxing you in the ears). &nbsp;Also, you will likely be able to talk the day of the procedure (I could but just sounded hoarse) but won&#039;t be able to talk for the following days. &nbsp;Get a notepad and prepare to write a lot.<br /><br />As for food recommendations - AVOID ice cream! &nbsp;The texture really bothered my throat.<br /><br />Good things to eat include: &nbsp;Instant mashed potatoed (the salt is surprisingly soothing), apricot nectar, pudding, yogurt, easy mac (after a few days), jello<br /><br />In summary, your life will suck for a few days but in the end you will feel much better - just keep telling yourself that!<br /><br />Hope this helps! &nbsp;Please feel free to PM me with any additional questions.<br /><br />

				P-tac, holy crap!&nbsp; That sounds awful.&nbsp; I will def. ask about that when I have my pre-op exam tomorrow.&nbsp; <br /><br />C-J, thanks for the info.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve heard about the ear pain.&nbsp; Not looking forward to that.&nbsp; I am looking forward to a diet of pudding, mashed potatoes and jello.&nbsp; <br /><br />For both of you: Did you use a humidifier?&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard that the moisture is soothing because it hurts more when it feels dry.&nbsp; <br /><br />Urrisg - I don&#039;t generally get strep.&nbsp; I get tonsillitis.&nbsp; When they do the culture test, it&#039;s negative for strep.&nbsp; However, I have a friend who got his removed because of constant strep.&nbsp; He said it was the best thing he ever did and was key in helping me decide to do it for my constant infections.&nbsp;

				Thanks Magic Pie for your feedback. If I get another bout of strep I am seriously going to consider a tonsillectomy myself! <br /><br />Goodluck with your tonsillectomy. Enjoy your mashed potatoes, pudding and jello!<br /><br />

				MagicPie - I did use a humidifier which helped IMMENSELY!&nbsp; I have a warm air one and, even though it was June when I had mine done, I ran it full time in the bedroom.&nbsp; <br /><br />The thing that I found helped soothe my throat the most was apricot nectar - I drank about 1.5-2 bottles a day!<br /><br />Also, it&#039;s a great time to guilt your loved ones into making a &quot;sunshine basket&quot; for you.&nbsp; Have them give you a basket with a bunch of small gifts and each day you get to open one.&nbsp; Breaks up the monotony if you are in bed for a few days.&nbsp; My mom did this for me when I had chicken pox as a kid and I convinced her that I needed it with this as well!<br /><br />Lastly, you should use the same notebook to write everything in and go back and review it a year or so later.&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty comical what one writes and thinks is communication when hopped up on painkillers.&nbsp; I came up with some great one liners!<br /><br />Best of luck!

				I didn&#039;t have a humidifier. I did, however, become quite the fan of my refridgerator&#039;s crushed ice button. I also sincerely recommend making organe juice and cranberry juice ice cubes. Ice cream=bad texture and popsicles were waaaaay too big for me to deal with, but juice ice cubes on toothpicks were perfect.

				I did it when I was 24. Recovery time for me was 2 weeks. Very sore and tired at first,<br />but after a couple days I was ok. Couldn&#039;t eat though - that ice cream myth is probably <br />just for kids. I don&#039;t remember getting any pain meds but since I was hardly taking in any<br />food/liquid, don&#039;t know if I could have tolerated them anyway.<br /><br />Stock up on some good DVDs, a book or two and anything else you can do that doesn&#039;t <br />require talking. Took me about 8 days to sound like myself again - now that&#039;s the frustrating<br />part. Not being able to speak was a killer, although my family was very happy.<br /><br />Good luck!

				I would recommend a nice simple Gucci navy pants suit with a silk and cashmere blend, sleeveless, sweetheart neckline, cream colored top; a nice pair of comfortable Dolce and Gabbana 4&quot; heels and a fashionable, very large Fendi purse so you can take some stuff with you and have someone carry it around all day long. Don&#039;t forget a bra and panties from Victoria&#039;s Secret in, oh, I think red would be nice. Don&#039;t forget to put your makeup case in your purse or your iPod, DVD player and iPhone. You never know who you are going to bump into in a major hospital. You need to be lookin&#039; gooooood!

Hope your recovery time is quick and relatively pain free.<br /><br />Just out of curiosity- do you happen to get strep a lot? The reason I ask is for some reason I seem to get strep every couple of months. When I looked online - they said that a tonsillectomy sometimes helps. <br /><br />Feel better!<br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t know if you ever got an answer to this but, from my experience, the answer might be &quot;Yes.&quot;&nbsp; I used to get strep 5+ times a year as a kid.&nbsp; The doc told me that, if I got it one more time, he&#039;d recommend removing my tonsils.&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t you know, I didn&#039;t get it again for 3 years or so.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had it a few times since then very sporadically and sometimes years apart; once so bad that my throat turned white and closed up so painfully that the Doc actually prescribed Vicodin and another time as a wonderful side effect to having mono (super awesome...).<br /><br />Still, I&#039;m thinking I&#039;ll have to have my tonsils removed before too long.&nbsp; I&#039;ve noticed, as has any Dr. that has taken a gander at my throat, that my tonsils have gotten quite large and a little bit misshapen and bulgy these days.&nbsp; They haven&#039;t said I should have them removed, but I&#039;d only imagine one serious bout of strep and I&#039;d be done for.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hopefully, it&#039;s when I have insurance...

				C-J, the apricot nector sounded good but fishbulb couldn&#039;t find it so he got pear nector and it is so good.&nbsp; It&#039;s really so soothing and sweet.&nbsp; Who knew?&nbsp; Thanks for the advice.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for the hug, MamaMac.&nbsp; And thanks for the good wishes, Eyerish and McDirk.<br /><br />The half hour before I take my drugs is the worst in terms of pain.&nbsp; I think the constant nausea is really hard to handle.&nbsp; Just about everything makes my tummy hurt.&nbsp; &nbsp;But on the other hand, sleeping is getting much easier.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m motivated to get better so I can have some damn hot coffee and pizza.&nbsp; I basically think about food all the time.

				So glad to hear that you are on the road to recovery. So, now we know what your first solid food will be . . . pizza! Good choice. Keep in touch.

				Magic Pie - If fishbulb needs a field trip send him to either Key Food or Trade Fair at Ditmars.&nbsp; Both had plenty of apricot nectar when I went thru this a couple of years ago (although I bought so much they might have stopped stocking it - ha ha)<br /><br />Feel better soon!
