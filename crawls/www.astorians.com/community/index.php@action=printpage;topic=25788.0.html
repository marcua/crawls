				Called Wine Stop right cross the street from Sanfords. It&#039;s tiny but they sure pack a lot of wines. I like that&#039;s it got this dark and earthy feel to it what with all the wooden shelves. I think the owners are from Spain. Nice addition to the neighborhood. Oh and further down past the Strand towards Crescent I saw a shop under construction with a sign on the door Oyster Cafe New York.&nbsp; Hmmm let&#039;s see how they work with such tiny space.

				While they may have a good selection, I&#039;m not sure why we need another wine shop right there, considering there&#039;s Angela&#039;s Wines and Liquors two blocks in one direction and Astoria Wine &amp; Spirits four blocks in the other direction.&nbsp;

				Angela is mediocre. They have a low selection and they aren&#039;t very knowledgeable. Sorry just have had bad experiences there. Astoria wine and spirits is fine and dandy of course the 30th avenue Wine and Liquor just about has every alcohol in the world!

				Walked in on Friday.&nbsp; If anyone&#039;s been looking for a true &quot;neighborhood wine shop,&quot; this is likely the one for you.&nbsp; The guy at the door said they intend to offer free samples of a different bottle of wine every night.&nbsp; He seems to be more about introducing you to things you might not be familiar with than the beaten path.<br /><br /><br />In other words, he wants to know what you like so he can help you develop your palate.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Angela&#039;s is much more of a &quot;Liquor Store.&quot;

				This place sounds like Off The Vine, also on 30th ave in the 40&#039;s. It&#039;s my favorite place to buy wine, since the owners know and love wine, and I always walk out of there finding something new and interesting. My favorite kinds of places in Astoria for sure.
