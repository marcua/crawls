				hi zeno et all....<br /><br />now i see another reason why you are called zeno. &nbsp;<br /><br />well, here's a question. &nbsp;is the astorians for peace meeting usually a regularly scheduled bi-weekly group, or is it only when people can meet? <br /><br />i'm asking primarily because a few of us are trying to pull together a reading group, and wednesday *looks* open on the calendar, but i know that at the last meeting we talked about the next meeting being on the nineteenth. &nbsp;we might not wednesday but i'm just trying to figure out what's available!<br /><br />let me know?!<br /><br />nicole

				Hi!,<br /><br />Since I have attended AFPJ I have noticed that they do <em>not</em> meet every week. Actually they move it around a bit, as you've said, when it is convenient and there are no events that require their attention.<br /><br />What I have seen though is that the meetings are usually AFAIK <span class="bbc_u">always</span> on a <strong>Wednesday</strong>.<br /><br />I would say it is safe to assume that they meet bi-monthly, or every two weeks. We usually post it on the calendar as soon as we know and/or I'm not too distracted or lazy. AFPJ are much more organized than I could ever hope to be ;-)<br /><br />Yours truly,<br />----Zeno. or zero or 0 or -0- or &quot;NULL&quot; or 2320 or Zed-Subcortical Architecure2 CFMSos v.12 :-) ... just kidding<br /><br />BTW: The next meeting is Wednesday October 19th 2005, 7:30 PM @ the Freeze Peach Cafe' here on Ditmars.
