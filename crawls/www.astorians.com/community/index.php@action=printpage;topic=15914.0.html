				Not sure if this will even interested anyone on here, but I figured what the heck ...<br /><br />As I explore the possibility of pursuing photography as a profession I keep telling myself that I don&#039;t want to shoot weddings. I guess I just didn&#039;t appreciate how artistic it could actually be. But with the current preferred style being a more photojournalist approach. And the recent trend of the convergence of photography and videography. I&#039;m beginning to rethink my initial reaction. I would be dense not to when I&#039;m constantly being shown work like this ...<br /><br />http://www.stillmotion.ca/site.html<br />The photos are great, but the &quot;Cinema&quot; section blew me away. All shot on a Canon 5D MkII SLR camera ...<br /><br />So maybe I don&#039;t want to shoot wedding full time, but maybe, just maybe, I could shoot them part time. :wink:

				That is some sick video with a 5DMKII, I haven&#039;t seen any yet.&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />Wedding photography is everything they say it is, terrifying, hard work, demanding, rewarding. I have had the experience only once, as I agreed to bail out a friend who waited too long to book a photographer, then could not find anyone affordable. (I declined the first time around, he came back and asked me again!) I learned a lot in those 11 hours that I was on my feet clicking shutters to my heart&#039;s content. The most important thing for me was that the bride &amp; groom understood that this was my first professional gig, I was less nervous, and they already knew my work. Will I shoot weddings again? If I decide to make this more of a career and less of a hobby, yes. Cause it&#039;s a great way to make money, and professional photographers need to pay rent too. The hardest part of the whole thing was post processing. I work a day job that usually consumes 50+hrs of my week. Add 1 wedding a month (just one) and you will have no life. Second shooting is something I&#039;ve also considered, as the primary photog will take the CF cards at the end of the day. But, they also own the photos you take, so, you know, there&#039;s that. But to touch back on your original statement, yes. It can be extremely rewarding. Not all brides are crazy. And couples look to the photographer to help them pose for those unique shots, as they are not used to being in front of a camera like most people. <br /><br />Kind of a rambling reply here, but no matter.&nbsp; :-)

				My husband recently bought that camera and it does produces amazing results. He also showed me some great links (sorry, don&#039;t have them bookmarked) where the video is shot in the morning and edited in the afternoon and then shown back to the couple and family during the evening reception. CRAZY!!!! Yes, it is a full time job-especially in the summer when it&#039;s huge wedding season. It helps to be more than just one person-and probably better for coverage, too. Good luck with your decision. I&#039;m seriously thinking of leaving my daytime job to help him with his gigs and do this full time along with his other photo/video projects. Wedding photography CAN be stale, but that depends on you and your creativity and what the client is looking for. If you&#039;re financially able to do that, you&#039;d decline couples who only want the family shot with a zillion variations. YAWN!

				We&#039;re currently in the process of shopping around for one now. Don&#039;t want to go with the $5k package including video, coffee-table-sized album, and ten billion pictures of the debauchery at the reception, though. Just some family portraits, the ceremony, couple of candids, and be done with it.<br /><br />What kinds of questions do we need to ask the photographers? Are they willing to consider just 3hrs or so of work? We could even print out our own albums using the CD.

				http://bridestelevision.com/articles/story.php?page=0&amp;articleid=290 (http://bridestelevision.com/articles/story.php?page=0&amp;articleid=290)&nbsp; <br /><br />This article from a year ago mentions several reality tv shows that deal with people getting married.&nbsp; I think there are more now.&nbsp; If you watch them you&#039;ll get an idea what your clients will really be like - not that I mean to scare you off.<br /><br />Also, part-time is probably all you would get right away because you&#039;d be starting a new business and it takes time to get a reputation established.&nbsp; Maybe you can stage some &quot;marriages&quot; among Astorians so you have something to practice on?<br /><br />

Do expect, however, to pay a markup for getting all the high-res images on CD - the photographer is essentially giving you ALL the images to use how you please (without control of how many you print, where the images are used, etc), rather than having you choose from proofs and printing you an album. How much they charge you may/will vary greatly by photographer.<br /><br />I would suggest not looking strictly at photographers/studios that shoot ONLY weddings, since they&#039;re more inclined to work with someone who buys a full package.

We receive a dvd of all pictures with the copyrights waived within 4 weeks of the wedding and a hosted website for 3 months of all wedding photos where friend and family can order their own prints. We get $100 credit towards purchasing photos for ourselves.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d recommend that you stipulate when the cd/dvd of photos is sent to you.&nbsp; &nbsp;As mentioned is someone else&#039;s post, the post production work is labor intensive, so it can take a really long time for you to get that cd/dvd, esp. during the wedding season.&nbsp; I have friends who still haven&#039;t received their cd/dvd and it&#039;s been two years since they got married. <br /><br />We&#039;re having our reception here (well, White Plains) and I don&#039;t know if we&#039;re going to do with a photographer.&nbsp; I can only imagine how much that can run for a 4 to 5 hour event.&nbsp;
