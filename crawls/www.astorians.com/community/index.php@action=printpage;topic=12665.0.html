				I&#039;m with ya...I live right around the corner and am SO READY for these to open!&nbsp; Of course I understand the issues surrounding lost financing and whatnot but hopefully it will work out for their sake, since I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll do very well if and when they open.&nbsp; <br /><br />Upon peeking inside from time to time, Petey&#039;s Burger actually looks like it has the interior mostly finished.&nbsp; Colorful tiles, tables set up, countertops, etc.&nbsp; Can&#039;t say the same for Mano&#039;s Papaya, which has had its awning up for months and months now and is hard to see inside.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I&#039;ve lived in the neighborhood for 4 years and that one block has changed so much even in that short period of time.&nbsp; Anyone remember when Petey&#039;s Burger used to be that scary, desolate Attorney&#039;s office with all the dead plants in the window and padlocked front door?&nbsp; And don&#039;t get me started on the loss of the glorious Keystone Diner and stupid Sai Organics taking its place....grrrrrr.....<br /><br />

				Oh man, I miss Keystone A<strong> LOT</strong> - mostly on Sunday or Saturday mornings, craving a nearby low-key, inexpensive breakfast (with mimosas!) and instead I am forced to walk into Tastee Corner only to find the line is out the door, the place is packed and loud, with mostly mediocre service. <br /><br />The old waiter at Keystone used to remember our order <em>every</em> time we went in.&nbsp; When it got cold out, he&#039;d always comp us a cup of coffee or soup, and always give us plenty of extra pickles.&nbsp; Oooooh.&nbsp; The pickles.&nbsp; Recently I saw the owner of Keystone sitting at the counter at Tastee and I wanted to grab him by the shoulders and scream &quot;WHYYYY????!???!&quot;.&nbsp; Sai Organics sucks.&nbsp; There, I said it.<br /><br />Anyway, I digress.&nbsp; Yes, the lawyers office was super scary and yes, Keystone is sorely missed.&nbsp; And there is a PSYCHIC on the 2nd floor of that block too.&nbsp; Has she always been there?&nbsp; I intentionally cross the street if she&#039;s sitting on the sidewalk having a cigarette - every time I pass, she sticks a flyer in front of me telling me to come talk to her because I have &quot;something on my aura.&quot;&nbsp; Hmm.&nbsp;

				Hello Friends,<br />Hope this little message finds everyone in good health and happiness.<br />My Name is Peter, Yes PETEY&#039;S BURGER on 30th Ave., I TRULY Hope we&#039;ll be open<br />Before some of you read this message.<br />As I was spanning the wonderful world of the internet, I came across this message board.<br />I’m glad some of you can’t wait for PETEY’S to OPEN, and PETEY can’t wait for your support.<br />I promise we will not disappoint you and you will only get the freshest and best quality.<br />I don’t want this message to be about Petey promoting PETEY’S, but rather about letting you<br />Know when we’ll be there for you. <br />The post by PJ was dead right and Pink Floyd wrong.<br />PETEY’S HAS NOT Run out of money and Has Nothing to do with financing…. END OF THAT STORY.<br />AS of this past JULY the wonderful City of New York and Building department have changed many<br />Many building codes, and take forever to inspect and sign off job sites, hence part of our delay.<br />Another delay, is good old Con Edison, if you noticed the jack hammers, we needed to install bigger<br />Gas service for our cooking equipment , and they are the worst when waiting for there service.<br />The Old day’s you just open and the building dept. comes in anytime after you open and signed of job<br />And maybe hit you with some monetary violation.&nbsp; These day’s you need to have sign off of job first , then open, Peteys has been ready to open for weeks now, but been advised not too.<br />Penalty can be to harsh, such as being closed for Thirty (30) days, not worth the gamble.. So we will wait.<br />Hope this answers some of the questions you Have about PETEYS BURGER on 30th Ave.<br />We take great pride in wanting to service the neighborhood and give you only the best.<br />As I have grown up on these streets of Astoria, I look forward to giving you only the best.<br />Thank You and see you real soon<br />PETEY<br />Any questions or comments e-mail&nbsp; comment@peteysburger.com<br />

				Petey, how exciting! Thank you so very much for your post. I can&#039;t wait for you to open.

				And <em>please </em> feature a Portabello Burger on the menu? By which I mean an actual portabello mushroom grilled with olive oil, perhaps a slab of fresh mozzarella etc. Not a beef patty w/a few slices of mushroom on top. I got duped the other night at a bar in another town, and it was disappointing.

				Dear Friends<br />Thank you for the kind words of support.&nbsp; It’s been a frustrating few weeks of waiting.<br />In life we have to take the positive side of things, so that’s the way we need to look at it.<br />One thing, I’m making new friends here and look forward to meeting you guys and gals.<br /><br />Our concept is simple, make a great burger, fries, shakes and that’s it. I can assure you the weeks have not been wasted,<br />we will have the best blend of 100% USA beef made just for us daily. You eat the burger the way PETEY makes it,<br />and you won’t need ketchup or bacon, trust me. Our fries have been tested and tested over the past weeks<br />to simply give you a great crispy fresh fry experience with only the highest grade potatoes and vegetable oil. <br /><br />We will deliver and take your orders via text messaging, that program will get started a few weeks after opening.<br />We just want to wait and make sure in house operations are running on all cylinders first. <br />Our web site www.peteysburger.com is near complete and will launch when delivery begins to roll out.<br />With the quality we will be giving, we are very reasonably priced and your hunt for a great burger,<br />fries and shake would have ended, if that’s what you are looking for. If you’re looking&nbsp; for chicken or fish, it won’t be at PETEY’S.<br /><br />We’ll have BURGER $ 3.49, CHEESE BURGER $ 3.99, DOUBLE CHEESE BURGER$ 5.49, TRIPLE CHEESE BURGER $6.49<br />all burgers will have the right ratio of Bun to meat to lettuce, tomato, cheese, sliced onion and sauce that will just explode the flavors.<br />Our Cajun Fire Burger $ 4.19, seasoned with spices, lettuce, tomato, sliced onion, and blue cheese dressing is a great twist on our Burger. PETEY MELT $ 3.99 on a grilled bun with extra cheese, grilled onions, and our sauce is just awesome.<br />Our fries $ 2.79, what can I say, they will be cut fresh daily, and will be great!<br />We’ll have Value Combo’s for you also. We’ll have a meatless cheese burger for you veggie people out there,<br />and may expand on that later. We’ll have a Grilled Cheese $ 2.49 for you also.<br /><br />I’m glad I had the time to give you guys this info. I look forward to seeing you guys at PETEY’S<br /><br />Thank You<br />PETEY (HIMSELF)<br /><br />PS …. THIS WILL BE MY LAST MESSAGE FOR NOW, AS I DON’T WANT ANYONE TO SAY I’M PROMOTING<br />PETEY’S IN ANYWAY. I WILL LET THE PEOPLE SPEAK FOR US GOOD OR BAD.<br />ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SEND E-MAIL&nbsp; TO comment@peteysburger.com AND I WILL DO MY BEST TO ANSWER.<br />

				I&#039;ve been on their mailing list (http://www.peteysburger.com/) and haven&#039;t heard anything. They are also not answering their phones. Do you think this has something to do with the delayed opening? <br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3141/2981106051_56efb8bfdd.jpg?v=0)

				I just ate there and was pleased with the results. <br /><br />I ordered a cheeseburger and fries. The cheeseburger was real nice. juicy and filling. There was the usual assortment of toppings. plenty of onions (big bonus for me), tomato, lettuce and some sauce which tasted like mayo mixed with ketchup. Also I think the bun was coated in butter. All in all, an excellent cheeseburger. Reminded me of Joe&#039;s best burger in Flushing which is a high compliment. <br /><br />The place looked nice and clean. My only complaint was that it took awhile for my food, but it&#039;s their first day so I can understand. <br /><br />Very welcome addition to the neighborhood.

				Was there this afternoon with my wife. It&#039;s fast food burger place designed to compete with McDs and BKs. But there&#039;s no comparison. An excellent tasting burger and fresh made fries made from real potatoes (instead of whatever that extruded stuff they sell at the chains).&nbsp; Highly recommended.

				It definitely had a bit of an In-and-Out vibe to me. Good combos of drink, fried and burgers for $7-8. The burger was good, the fries were good. I still miss the disappeared Zip Burger in midtown, but Petey&#039;s is a great quality for the price.

				Are they thin, fast food-type burgers, or thicker burgers?&nbsp; If they are thicker, I&#039;m severely disappointed if they will not cook them to order.&nbsp; Cooking to order is a requirement of a good burger joint, IMO, and I probably won&#039;t even try it if they refuse to serve them any way but well done.<br /><br />How are the fries?&nbsp; Thick - steak or diner fries?&nbsp; Thin - like McD&#039;s or proper frites?&nbsp; Crispy/crunchy, or medium-textured?

They have thinner hamburger patties than the ones you&#039;d get at a nicer restaurant, like McDonald&#039;s or Burger King, but the meat is better. At In-N-Out, all the toppings (lettuce, onion, tomato, special sauce) are cut daily and are super fresh and local when they can be. I don&#039;t know if Petey&#039;s is as fresh as In-N-Out, but the tomato and lettuce were great, as was the cheese. <br /><br />Things like buttering and toasting the bun and not over salting the fries are a big deal to me, and that&#039;s something that Petey&#039;s and In-N-Out have in common.<br /><br />It&#039;s basically a better done retooling of the fast food burger joint. Less options, similar food, but done better with better ingredients.

				<br />Getting back on topic...&nbsp; &nbsp;I finally got to try Petey&#039;s the other night, and thought the burgers and fries aren&#039;t very different than that of a typical fast food joint.&nbsp; I was really hoping for a Shake Shack / Burger Joint type of experience, but it was more like Burger King.&nbsp; &nbsp;In fact I really thought my cheeseburger tasted like a Whopper and for the price ($7 and change for a Cheeseburger and Fries) I think you&#039;d be better off with a Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger at Wendy&#039;s.&nbsp; &nbsp;The fries were a bit better but still a bit thin and slightly soggy.<br /><br />I do appreciate the fact that the place is locally owned and operated, but the burgers and the fries are definitely not worth praise (shilling?) seen on this thread.

				I was excited about trying this place out - but I would only rate it solid, average food. The burgers are thin enough they could not really be pink on the inside and yet charred on the outside, so they really remind me more of a fast food place than a premium burger. The tomato was pink rather than red and the lettuce was iceburg and purely white (ehh). The cheese was well melted but the bun was nothing special. <br /><br />I thought the price of ~$15 for 2 cheeseburgers and 2 fries was pretty steep. Especially for Astoria, I wouldn&#039;t say it was much more filling than the $1.29 Bacon Cheeseburger you can get at Wendy&#039;s in Manhattan. I do appreciate that it is a locally owned store, but I was looking for more of an edge. <br /><br /><br />I was hoping for something like this (Shake Shack): <br />(http://static.flickr.com/62/165311910_c778ce3412.jpg)<br /><br />Also - I think their veggie sandwich does not have a patty but is more of a cheese sandwich.&nbsp;

				We weren&#039;t all that impressed either.<br /><br />Got the Petey Melt -- their take on a patty melt -- it was meh. The &quot;bun&quot; was some odd hybrid of two bun bottoms, it seemed, which became kind of charred and crispy and threw off the taste of the whole thing. The burger patty was okay, in that somewhat sort of better than McDonald&#039;s because at least it&#039;s real meat kind of way.<br /><br />The veggie burger wasn&#039;t bad. Small, but kind of undercooked. It needed toppings, though. Like some kind of sauce or something. <br /><br />The fries weren&#039;t too bad and one order could definitely feed two people.<br /><br />The milkshakes were good. Really good. I&#039;d go back just for the shake.<br /><br />All in all, if you live near Petey&#039;s and want a relatively inexpensive meal on your way home from the subway, then go for it. Otherwise, there are much better burgers in the nabe to spend your money on.

				I really hope Petey&#039;s Burger is still reading this thread. They seem to need some of their customer&#039;s input or they will not be making a long term commitment in the hood. I had hoped for a superior product. I wished for so long for a good burger joint on Grand Avenue—and this one is in a prime location—but I don&#039;t care to go out of my way for a Mickey D&#039;s size patty of meat or skinny fries (with or without their skin) when I am hankering for a burger I want to have to hold it with two hands . . . and I want it rare!

				Just remembered... one thing that was definitely missing:&nbsp; Pickles. Who doesn&#039;t have pickles? Even McDonald&#039;s has pickles on their burgers. Heck, even White Castle has pickles on their burgers and their burgers are barely burgers!<br /><br />Petey&#039;s, if you&#039;re reading this: get thee some pickles! And perhaps some BBQ sauce, ranch or some kind of Petey&#039;s own special sauce to juice up those hockey puck burgers.

				Okay, gave Petey&#039;s another shot last night.<br /><br />What a difference a week makes! <br /><br />The burger was WAY better. This time I got a cheeseburger. The burger was thicker and juicier -- not at all the thin flat puck it was before. The bun/burger ratio was perfect. Still no pickles, but had some at home. The burger was kind of Johnny Rockets-esque -- not gargantuan, but not fast-food sized either.<br /><br />The fries were much better too -- I&#039;m thinking they just weren&#039;t cooked well enough last time. And no, if they continue to be this good, one order would not satisfy two people -- I downed my fries in about 5 seconds last night, they were that good.<br /><br />The shake was still awesome.<br /><br />So my advice -- if you&#039;ve been to Petey&#039;s before and were like me, thinking it was kind of so-so, give it another try. It seems like they&#039;re still working out the kinks and trying new things. $20, a quick, satisfying meal for two... can&#039;t beat that.<br /><br />Now, if only they&#039;d add onion rings to the menu... <br /><br />

				My fiance and I checked out Petey&#039;s last night.&nbsp; My conclusion:&nbsp; Hey Californians (West Coasters) are you homesick for In &amp; Out Burger?&nbsp; Well, Petey&#039;s is trying very hard to be their clone.<br /><br />I think paratactical already made this comparison, but I really had to echo her because it&#039;s surprising just how similar they are.&nbsp; Petey&#039;s color scheme, the way they wrap their burgers, their Russian dressing sauce, their fresh but thin fries, the tiny menu...all of it is just like In &amp; Out.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, we decided that their meals were about a $1 over-priced, but still worth those once and a while visits to satisfy our In &amp; Out cravings.&nbsp; Also, we wondered if getting these burgers and fries delivered would be a good idea in the winter.&nbsp; Being that the fries are so thin, I&#039;d think they&#039;d show up at your door cold.&nbsp; So, best to eat there, methinks.

				My 2 cents:<br />&nbsp; I just ate a double cheeseburger with fries over at Petey&#039;s.&nbsp; I must say I loved it.&nbsp; The in &amp; out burger comparisons are warranted and the owners conceded that the similarities are intentional.&nbsp; Another interesting bit of info I gleaned from the conversation with the ownership is that Petey&#039;s has the same meat supplier as the famous Shake Shack in Manhattan.<br />&nbsp; As for the early bad reviews, I believe that you may have had a bad experience at Peteys, but that is likely due to the fact that were just opening and hadn&#039;t properly trained the cooks and what not.&nbsp; The meal I had was PHENOMENAL.&nbsp; It was exactly what I wanted.&nbsp; A fastfood burger done right.&nbsp; A comfortable decor, friendly staff/ownership, and totally reasonable prices.&nbsp; The burgers are big enough to fill me up.&nbsp; Add fries and coke and you&#039;re stuffed... but the best part is that you spent less than 10 bucks!<br />WELCOME TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD PETEY!<br />

				My hubby and I went tonight and were thrilled with our meal. I guess I am glad we waited a couple of weeks because our experience was opposite of many of the earlier reviews. <br /><br />I got the Petey burger combo and my hubby got the Petey melt (their version of a patty melt)combo. Both of our burgers were of substantial size, not like McDs at all. The meat was very good and juicy, the toppings fresh ( I am a raw onion lover so I appreciated that addition), and the Petey sauce reminded me of a Russian dressing style sauce(there might have been a lil relish in it). My hubby devoured his melt so I didn&#039;t get a bite, but he liked it a lot so I will try it next time.<br /><br />The fries are thin and crispy (not greasy) and there are quite a lot of them in the order. They remind me of the fresh cut fries you get in those big tubs at the fair (i was born in the midwest&nbsp; :-) ) just a thinner cut. <br /><br />I did not get a shake because my body doesnt agree with a lot of dairy&nbsp; &nbsp;:cry:&nbsp; &nbsp; but my hubby enjoyed his vanilla shake. <br /><br /><br />We met the owners, Petey and George, who were very kind and more than happy to answer all our questions.&nbsp; We will be returning.

				This place sounds great - and it&#039;s good to hear they get their meat from LaFrieda Meats - truly quality meat.&nbsp; I knew Lisa LaFrieda, one of the owners of the company, before she passed on from cancer a few years back, truly one of the most wonderful human beings I have ever met, and the passion her family feels for delivering quality meat was one of the things you found out within minutes of meeting her.<br /><br />Do they have onion rings?&nbsp; I&#039;ve really been in an onion rings mood lately.

				Prices should be a little lower.&nbsp; Even if just $0.50 per item/meal.&nbsp; But hey, maybe I just need to get use to the new economy/cost of living?<br /><br />First time I went there, I got the Cheeseburger.&nbsp; It was too small. I felt unsatisfied --but only because it tasted so good, I was left wanting more.<br /><br />Second time I went there, I learned my lesson.&nbsp; I ordered the Double Cheeseburger.&nbsp; It is perfection and, somehow, Petey&#039;s has found the secret ingredient that makes you crave their burger (like I always say about McDonald&#039;s fries).<br /><br />Perfect bun to burger ratio.&nbsp; No need to add extra condiments at home.&nbsp; Too much onion for me, but other than that, I will go to Petey&#039;s again and again.&nbsp; I will have dreams about Petey&#039;s.<br /><br />I truly hope they succeed.

				I just tried Petey&#039;s for the first time. I went against the recommendations here and took the food to go.

				I finally had the opportunity to try Petey&#039;s Burger today.&nbsp; &nbsp;I had a cheeseburger and an order of fries, and later on, a chocolate shake.&nbsp; My verdict:&nbsp; very close to complete satisfaction.&nbsp; I was craving a fast food-style burger and fries, and Petey&#039;s delivered (figuratively!&nbsp; I ate in-house).<br /><br />I think it&#039;s important to note, as a number of posters have, that this isn&#039;t a thick gourmet burger; it&#039;s definitely in the thin, fast food family of burgers.&nbsp; And while my usual preference is for thicker burgers done rare, this was one of the best burgers of its style that I have had.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; I have never had an In-n-Out burger, so I can&#039;t make that comparison.&nbsp; But although well done, the meat was tasty and surprisingly juicy.&nbsp; I thought the flavours of the burger, sauce and toppings melded nicely (although as a few people mentioned, a pickle wouldn&#039;t be amiss).&nbsp; I ate the cheeseburger and fries around 4pm, after having had nothing but a glass of kefir this morning around 10:30, so I was very hungry, but I found the size of the burger to be quite satisfactory.<br /><br />I thought the fries were excellent.&nbsp; The order was huge - it could easily satisfy two people, and I actually wish it were half the size and maybe $1 cheaper.&nbsp; It was really unnecessarily large.&nbsp; (Or hey - they could have two sizes.)&nbsp; But they were nice and thin, with a good potato flavour.&nbsp; The browning and crunch were just right for my taste.<br /><br />The chocolate shake was a good fast food shake, and is made to order with Fox&#039;s U-Bet syrup.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what the other flavours are made with.&nbsp; I am normally a chocolate fiend - I would say this is moderately chocolatey, which fits with the style of the food and service.<br /><br />Criticisms:&nbsp; mostly small details relating to toppings and condiments:<br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>I thought the onion slice was way too thick - but I don&#039;t like raw onion, so I just removed the whole thing.&nbsp; My husband, who normally does like raw onion, found it to be too much as well.&nbsp; </li><li>The lettuce and tomato were on the bottom.&nbsp; There&#039;s a reason they are called &quot;toppings&quot;, IMO, but I acknowledge that that is a personal preference, and it was easy enough to put them on top myself.&nbsp; On a positive note, one of my tomato slices was actually cored, which I thought was a nice attention to detail. </li><li>The mayonnaise provided in packets was of generic food service quality and was way too sweet (and also contained both HFCS and regular corn syrup).&nbsp; It was more like Miracle Whip (although I haven&#039;t tasted Miracle Whip in years) rather than proper mayo.&nbsp; It didn&#039;t match the quality of the other ingredients.</li><li>The salt provided is too coarse to stick properly to the fries.&nbsp; It sinks to the bottom, leaving half the fries undersalted and half the fries oversalted.&nbsp; The fries themselves come unsalted, which is fine - I don&#039;t mind adding salt myself, but I wish it was proper fry salt.</li></ul><br />The service was adequate - not stellar, but nothing was wrong with it.&nbsp; You place your order at the counter and they call you up when it&#039;s ready, although they&#039;ll bring something small out to you if it comes out after.&nbsp; But it&#039;s not really table service, which is fine.<br /><br />The best part was really how I felt afterward.&nbsp; On the rare occasions I have fast food (McDonalds or equivalent), I feel like crap afterward - like I&#039;ve eaten something that my body barely recognises as food.&nbsp; I had none of the feeling after this meal, and I think it&#039;s because the food quality is far better and fresher.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now, if they would only deliver to north of Ditmars!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D

				I tried Petey&#039;s recently. I tried the veggie burger and my friend had the standard burger &amp; fries. The veggie is fresh, obviously made by them; it&#039;s decent, definitely not the frozen patty nonsense you ofter get elsewhere. The burger was good, but a bit overcooked though. The fries were very good. The prices are reasonable. The service people need an attitude adjustment though. <br /><br />But overall I recommend Petey&#039;s.&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				My BF and I ordered Petey&#039;s on Friday night after having it once in the restaurant, and let me say - WOW!<br /><br />We were worried they burgers wouldn&#039;t travel well....they were perfect! We ordered around 8pm on Friday,&nbsp; which can usually be a death sentence, but the delivery guy was so prompt it was amazing!<br /><br />One note - I ordered a chocolate shake because they do not have fountain soda (kinda sucks) and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD! I would go so far as saying it was &quot;da bomb&quot; which is a term I don&#039;t use loosely, people!<br /><br />If you have a craving for a burger, this is the place to go!<br /><br />(oh, and they have their delivery zone mapped out on their website, pretty convenient!)<br /><br />

				I recently posted something about Petey&#039;s Burger and their rude delivery people. I was impressed to receive an email from the owner of Petey&#039;s letting me know that this is going to be addressed immediately. This was extremely impressive...not many restaurant owners care this much to check out posts and see what people actually think. I hope my initial post doesn&#039;t deter people from trying Petey&#039;s...like I initially said, their food is really good.

				Petey&#039;s Burger is a great addition to the hood. Once you try this place you will not look at burgers the same.<br />My kids and I love this place but since it opened I feel my cholesterol rising. It is a true guilty pleasure.<br /><br />I have had many a burger in my day including in-and-out which seems to be the closet comparison.<br />Petey&#039;s double is phenomenal but don&#039;t go there without trying the&quot;Petey Melt&quot;...the toasted bun gooey cheese<br />and grilled onions are TDF... <br /><br />The Shakes are great and the hand cut home made fries are top notch. And for a fast food place the place is clean and has a great look.<br />I am and a huge fan and a regular, and unreal fast delivery service.

I was impressed to receive an email from the owner of Petey&#039;s letting me know that this is going to be addressed immediately. This was extremely impressive...not many restaurant owners care this much to check out posts and see what people actually think. I hope my initial post doesn&#039;t deter people from trying Petey&#039;s...like I initially said, their food is really good. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />We order from Petey&#039;s A LOT, to the point where, when the other day we ordered both Petey&#039;s (for one of us) and Chicken Shack (for the other), we felt like we were cheating on the Petey&#039;s guy when the two deliveries arrived simultaneously. We&#039;ve always found the delivery guys to be really nice... he even laughed about us getting a second delivery from someplace else (he joked &quot;well, it&#039;s good to try new things... &quot;).<br /><br />Love that Petey&#039;s has online ordering. Wish more places did... we&#039;ve never had an incorrect order from them yet.

				I&#039;m not much of a meat-eater, but can appreciate fast food done well. My fiance tried Petey&#039;s last night for the first time, after reading in Time Out NY that it aspired to be In &amp; Out Burger....you know, the way McDowell&#039;s aspires to be McDonald&#039;s :lol:<br /><br />He had their version of the &quot;double double&quot; with french fries. I took a bite of the burger and it was pretty good; the fries were to die for- long shoestring well-done and not too crisp. <br /><br />Forgot how much it was- not very cheap, but a most excellent burger fix from what I gather&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				The hotdogs are decent but no different than the 200 odd Mr. X Payaya&#039;s around town.&nbsp; They are nice and crispy, and one dog is $1 with toppings.&nbsp; There is a backyard, but is unfurnished as of yet.

				WE LOVE Petey&#039;s...but prefer going in person. When you place an order over the phone, the girl rushes you that she doesn&#039;t even listen to specifics. Very annoying.

				There are so many spinoffs on that name, I really can&#039;t tell the difference.&nbsp; To me, a hotdog is a hotdog is a hotdog.&nbsp; I&#039;m obviously unqualified!&nbsp; LOL

				Recently tried Petey&#039;s for the first time. We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries with vanilla shakes. When the order was placed in front of us my boyfriend and I both thought the same thing: the burgers look too small! Boy, were we wrong! Not only were they filling, but absolutely delicious! Hot, juicy, cheezy, flavorful. I couldn&#039;t finish the fries, but nothing went to waste because the BF finished them off for me. I&#039;m just glad we don&#039;t live closer because Petey&#039;s would then be a weekly indulgence, which my waistline could not afford!<br /><br />I like Petey&#039;s burgers better than Petey&#039;s fries, even though they&#039;re really good. Pio Pio&#039;s fries beats anyone&#039;s fries hands down.
