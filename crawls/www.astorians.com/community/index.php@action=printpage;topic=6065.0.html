				I&#039;m graduating from SVA on Thursday, May 10th. Whee! You all already knew that because I have probably talked about it incessantly, sorry about that.<br /><br />So. My family is coming in from CT and my mom has told me that I need to figure out where we should go out for dinner afterwards. There will be about 8 people (myself included), and we can&#039;t spend a redonk amount of money. (A little pricey is fine, $100/person is NOT.)<br /><br />I am in charge of this because my mom and both of my aunts were originally like, &quot;Lets go somewhere nice! Like Tavern on the Green!&quot; Um, no. Isn&#039;t TOTG kind of like the cheesy Hard Rock Cafe of nice restaurants? And I heard there&#039;s a unicorn room (http://www.yelp.com/biz/Zv7RN50qQEFkrsRaUNWoRw)? (Scroll down to the 1/13/07 review.) I don&#039;t want unicorns involved, please.<br /><br />Graduation is at Radio City (6th Ave &amp; 51st), so somewhere near there is cool, although we could probably take a cab or subway somewhere, but it&#039;ll be around rush hour (maybe a bit after, not sure exactly what time, gotta figure that out). The only dietary restriction is that one person who is coming has a SEVERE nut allergy - like, she had to go to the hospital on Thanksgiving after everyone else (not her, she was SUPER careful) ate turkey deep-fried in peanut oil - the fumes wafted into the house or something. So no Thai and all their peanutty goodness. Also, if I suggested something like Ethiopian (which I&#039;ve heard good things about and would like to try one of these days), they wouldn&#039;t be too happy.<br /><br />Honestly, with my family, I&#039;m thinking steakhouse or Italian or &quot;American&quot; (whatever that really means when it comes to food), but which place? Help me, Astorians!<br /><br />(also, mods - I know this has nothing to do with the food here in Astoria, so maybe it should be moved to Random Gabble? I&#039;ll leave it up to you guys&nbsp; :-) )

				Happy Graduation!!&nbsp; :lol:&nbsp; <br /><br />If I were going somewhere for a splurge, hands down it would be Balthazar.&nbsp; It&#039;s pricey, but you can keep costs lower by watching the extras.&nbsp; The staff is super welcoming and the French bistro atmosphere is really festive.&nbsp; The menu&#039;s available online: http://www.balthazarny.com/.<br /><br />Congrats again, and let us know what you decide!

				Happy Graduation.<br /><br />If you are willing to go bistro french, a good place close by (and I say this even though I got canned from my waitering job there a few years ago) is Cafe Joule on 1st Avenue and 58th/59th Street. &nbsp;Short cab ride or nice walk if the weather is fine.&nbsp; &nbsp;Good food, nice wine list, very reasonable prices, entrees starting under $20. &nbsp;Small kitchen, so the peanut dietary concern can be monitored closely.<br /><br />The chef, Vernejoule, was a french wiz kid chef who lost his marbles while cooking at a four star hotel in France. &nbsp;He became a short order cook at their version of a greasy spoon and was there for a few years until he met his American wife who was there on holiday. &nbsp;They got married and opened this place. &nbsp;Food has a good tenderness to it. &nbsp;

				if steak is what you want in that hood, look at Del Frisco&#039;s although will be pricey, depending on your beverage selection.

				Happy Graduation!<br />I know it&#039;s off the beaten path, but some of the best food I ever found in NYC was at a place called Ponte&#039;s down in TriBeCa, along the River, with incredible views.&nbsp; It is Italian, serves steak and seafood.&nbsp; I think you could get out for under $100 a person, but it isn&#039;t cheap.&nbsp; A dear friend (since deceased) used to sell them their meat.&nbsp; The steak there was absolutely amazing.<br />http://newyork.citysearch.com/profile/7113274/new_york_ny/f_illi_ponte_ristorante.html - a menu is probably online somewhere!

				My bad.&nbsp; Do a search for Cafe Joul (no &quot;e&quot; at the end).&nbsp; You&#039;ll find all of the websites on it.<br /><br />http://www.uppereast.com/cafejoul.html<br />http://www.menupages.com/restaurantdetails.asp?areaid=0&amp;restaurantid=4783&amp;neighborhoodid=3&amp;cuisineid=27<br /><br />Hope y&#039;all have a great dinner!

				Cafe Joul is a great suggestion. There&#039;s also Trattoria Pesce Pasta across the street, but they don&#039;t take reservations. You do need to get out of the overpriced Rock Ctr area and it&#039;s a nice walk or quick taxi ride away. If you&#039;ve never been to the east 50s, you should walk to the East River after the meal. Walk down 58th Street and at the end of the street is a little park where &quot;Manhattan&quot; was filmed, plus you can take a look at some of the most beautiful townhouses in the city. In case you didn&#039;t guess, I grew up in the East 50s (though sadly not in one of those houses&nbsp; :cry:).

				Welll being an Astorian I support the local restaurants and think you might wanna buggie back to the upper ditmars area and check out Trattoria Lincontro (one of NYC best italians), or Taverna Klykades , or Christos Taverna. Then theirs Locale, perhaps too small. Ponticello?<br />Whatever you chose the important thing is that you are well recieved and your party is one to remember because you only live once and remember your only visiting.<br />Ciao Bella.

Plus two other people are teachers who have to be up super early), I can&#039;t keep them out too late. They&#039;ll be going in and out of Grand Central, so getting them from Radio City, back up to Astoria, then back down to Grand Central could easily add an extra 60-90 minutes to their night.<br /><br />Thanks again for all the suggestions, guys. You all rule.&nbsp; :mrgreen: I&#039;ll let you know where we end up going!

				might I ask what you ordered at Les Halles?&nbsp; I went there with a group and none of us were too thrilled with what we ordered.&nbsp; I am a fan of Bourdain, but I did not like my meal.&nbsp; Please let me know, I would like to give it another try.&nbsp; Thanks.
