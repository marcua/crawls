			Advocat (advocatrescue.org), a volunteer-run and funded cat rescue based in Forest Hills, Queens, needs fosters! Kitten season is now year-round, and there are too many homeless kittens and not enough space in shelters or rescues. <br /><br />My bf and I started fostering for Advocat a few months ago while experiencing acute kitten fever. We have 2 adult cats of our own, so at first, we were concerned about having enough space in our 1-bedroom apt, and how our kitties would adapt to it. But it turned out to be so better than we expected! Advocat provides everything to get started, including an enclosed playpen to keep the fosters separated. They also cover all the vet bills, and find furrever homes for the kitties. We had our first set of fosters for about 3 weeks, and our cats loved them. We watched them grow from tiny, scared babies to confident, playful, affectionate kittens. The hardest part is saying goodbye, but that also means that we&#039;re able to take in new fosters and save more lives.<br /><br />The little nugget pictured here was from our first set of fosters in May, and quite possibly the cutest thing I&#039;d ever seen.<br /><br />Fostering doesn&#039;t take much time -- we both have 9-5 jobs and are able to leave the kittens for 8 hours while we&#039;re at work. You feed them, clean their litter box, and give them affection and play. Some kittens may require oral or eye meds for a few days, but administering them is easy since they&#039;re so small.<br /><br />Please consider fostering, and fill out the application on advocatrescue.org! Reply or DM me with any questions.
