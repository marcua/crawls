				Wow I couldn&#039;t disagree with you more. I have lived in Astoria for over 15 years and loved it when I moved here and have to say I love it even more now. It is diverse, friendly, convenient and safe. Not too mention it has some of the best restaurants around!&nbsp; There are things I don&#039;t love about living here but trust me they are minimal and that can be said of anywhere you move. <br /><br />All I can say is differant strokes for differant folks. Sorry you don&#039;t like it here Rueful Rose - but trust me there are many here who LOVE Astoria.&nbsp;

				Rose,<br /><br />Can I ask where you moved here from? I think that has a lot to do with it.<br /><br />Also, how do you like NYC in general?<br /><br />I think the answers to these questions could help someone considering coming here decide if they are more similar in taste to you or to the others who love the &#039;hood.

				Hi Rose, I&#039;m not surprised at any of the items you listed, but I am surprised that you&#039;ve seen astorians.com as being an &quot;I love astoria&quot; fest. For every &quot;what an awesome place to live!&quot; post there&#039;s a &quot;I hate the litter/noise/development/my neighbors, that restaurant sucks, my landlord is an asshole, etc.&quot; <br /><br />It is kind of sweet that the board got you to move here, though. And I have to say that what I love most about astoria is the astorians. I could find ugliness and beauty, annoyances and delights, in any neighborhood. But running into people I know at the grocery store or in front of the laundromat, being within walking distance of several friends, is just awesome. <br /><br />If you are going to be stuck here for a while, you might try meeting a few of us. It&#039;s what makes this place worth living in.

				I live near 30th St &amp; B&#039;way, and understand some of what you&#039;re displeased with, but some of you gripes seem to be related to the building you&#039;re living in, not greater Astoria.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t seen any racial slurs getting thrown around; rather, this is the most diverse place I&#039;ve ever lived by a long shot - to include the food as well.&nbsp; The only food-related thing that annoys me is that there aren&#039;t any Taco Bells around, but then again, I have 3-ish &quot;real&quot; Mexican restaurants to choose from.<br /><br />I think the area that we&#039;re in has been/is still going through a &quot;growing&quot; phase (some would call it gentrification... I don&#039;t).&nbsp; My roommate, who has lived in various Astoria neighborhoods for 5 years, wouldn&#039;t have come to the B&#039;way area 4 years ago, and said that it has been drastically cleaned up and gotten safer.&nbsp; I&#039;d give it some time- I see new/improved business popping up everywhere I go, to include the &quot;facelifting&quot; and &quot;pretty-ing up&quot; of various buildings and public spaces.&nbsp; The area is a great deal for the rent I&#039;m paying...<br /><br />What B&#039;way intersection are you closest to?&nbsp; Did you visit the area much before deciding to move there?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />[/quote]

				Yeah, it&#039;s ugly, there are no parks, the restaurants aren&#039;t super awesome, there are no trees, the air quality sucks.<br /><br />I still love it, what can I say.<br /><br />The most racism I&#039;ve encountered is here on this board, and that&#039;s still not very much. So...your building is crappy, don&#039;t blame that on the entire neighborhood.<br /><br />For parks, you can always get on the NW, go to the 57th and 7th ave stop and go to Central Park. Pain in the ass? Well, let&#039;s be real, if there were a gigantic Prospect Park-style park here, we wouldn&#039;t be able to afford to live here.

				Hi there, Rueful Rose. While I&#039;m sure your time in Astoria has been genuinely unpleasant, it sounds like you have been very unlucky in your experiences regarding your living situation, and you shouldn&#039;t let that reflect on Astoria as a whole. We&#039;re not delusional when we say we like it here, so try to keep an open mind.<br /><br />It&#039;s true that much of the architecture here, and in Queens in general, is ugly. This is why blogs like the Queens Crapper exist. We don&#039;t have the lovely brownstones that exist in other boroughs. A lot of the stuff here looks slapped together without any aesthetic consideration.<br /><br />As for ignorant, racist neighbors, I do not have any of these. I&#039;m sorry that you got crappy, racist, nosy neighbors. They are not special to Astoria.<br /><br />Lack of trees - yes, there could be more trees. The air quality is not great. The city likes to build power plants here, and sometimes the whole area smells like sewage, which we have discussed on the board.<br /><br />Mediocre food - I have to disagree. Not all the restaurants here are great, and everyone&#039;s taste differs, but we do have some fine offerings both cheap and expensive. I hope you&#039;ve at least tried some of the better Greek restaurants, because that&#039;s what Astoria is known for. <br /><br />Although it&#039;s kind of ugly and rickety sounding, I like the elevated train because I prefer being outside in most cases to being in the stuffy and smelly subway stations, and I like looking out the window while riding. Maybe I like it more on Ditmars because it&#039;s the last stop and it offers a nice view.<br /><br />No, Astoria isn&#039;t utopia. It has its problems just like every other place. But I do really like living in Astoria, and my expectations aren&#039;t low. Western Queens isn&#039;t glamorous. I find living here to be practical and enjoyable, and I love the fact that I can get almost everything I need on a day-to-day basis within just 3-4 blocks. That&#039;s what I wanted. If my biggest concern was to live on beautiful tree-lined streets with lovely architecture, I would go to Brooklyn.

				Astoria does have parks!&nbsp; 3 right along the waterfront, that offer amazing views of Manhattan.&nbsp; I live in Astoria on a tree-lined street, 10 minutes from Astoria Park.&nbsp; Perhaps the particular area of Astoria you moved to is not suited to your tastes, but the things you complain about are things you can find just about anywhere.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think any warning to lurkers is necessary.&nbsp; I don&#039;t expect everyone to love Astoria or even like it.&nbsp; I understand it&#039;s not everyone&#039;s cup of tea.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find a neighborhood you really like, but blame your dislike of Astoria on your personal tastes, rather than on Astoria itself.&nbsp;

				Rueful_Rose,<br /><br />I find it curious that you have been lurking on the boards for awhile, and have lived in the area since 2007 but chose this to be your first posting (on the same day you registered no less). &nbsp;Was there a specific event that compelled you to diss the area where you&#039;ve lived for awhile now? &nbsp;I&#039;m curious...<br /><br />I&#039;ve been in Astoria for 11 years now and love leaving Manhattan behind and coming to what feels like a real neighbourhood in the Ditmars area. &nbsp;Sure the architecture isn&#039;t the nicest but We like our neighbours, have trees in front of our house and, as someone else said, most everything we could ever need is within a few block radius. &nbsp;We are also close enough to Manhattan that it is possible to come home after work, shower and change and return to Manhattan in a relatively short amount of time, provided the MTA is playing nice. &nbsp;If you hate the Broadway area so much maybe you should check out other areas of Astoria. &nbsp;Ditmars is a completely different animal than the Broadway area and may be more your speed as far as conveniences go.<br /><br />We were in Chicago last year and the El train there is much worse to deal with than it is here. &nbsp;At least in NYC the MTA runs most of the time and at faster speeds. &nbsp;I actually like the train being above ground. &nbsp;After living through events such as Sept 11th and the blackout it&#039;s actually comforting to know that it would be much easier to evacuate the train if it was above ground in Astoria than in a tunnel anywhere else.<br /><br />As for not being happy here, I&#039;m sorry to hear that and can only say that I hope you gave our little &#039;hood a fair chance and do find happiness wherever you end up. However, if that is in another area of NYC I can guarantee that there will be just as many negative attributes as there are here. &nbsp;

				I think it is also important not to generalize that all of the Broadway area is without trees. It really depends on where you live. I live on a very nice tree lined block with neighbors that&nbsp; make can effort to keep the block neat and tidy. I would suggest looking around&nbsp; all the neighborhoods of Astoria and seeing which one suits you best or perhaps in some case don&#039;t suit you at all.

				Thanks for all your thoughtful responses.<br /><br />C-J :<br /><br />Yes, I registered specifically to post this message.&nbsp; &nbsp;Yesterday, after another asinine racist remark from one of my neighbors, I just got fed up.&nbsp; I want to live somewhere people who are racist are embarrassed to be racist and stifle themselves accordingly.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ll take liberal hypocrisy over slurs being thrown around casually.&nbsp; &nbsp;Yesterday, I asked my neighbor to not use a certain word around me.&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning, for the first time, in almost a year, my newspaper was not delivered to my door.&nbsp; I hope my neighbor is not spiteful enough to steal my papers, but now I&#039;ll have to wake up extra early to get them.<br /><br />I used to lurk on this board, but I haven&#039;t been following up since the end of winter.&nbsp; &nbsp;Reading over some of the posts, the nature of this board has changed.&nbsp; A few posters are flying their idiot flags loud and proud now.&nbsp; &nbsp;I guess there&#039;s less risk now of a lurker being seduced to Astoria due to any interesting and civil discourse on this board anymore.<br /><br /><br />newastorian:<br /><br />This message wasn&#039;t directed at current residents.&nbsp; But I get why you&#039;re insulted.&nbsp; Them&#039;s the breaks.&nbsp; My message was directed more at people who are using this board as a resource while considering a move to Astoria.&nbsp; If there are people similarly situated to me out there that are a bad fit for Astoria, maybe my note will give them pause before they commit to a move here.&nbsp; &nbsp;Everybody wins, including you, since there&#039;ll be fewer people &#039;like me&#039; here.&nbsp; &nbsp;You&#039;re welcome.<br /><br />Other responses:<br /><br />I don&#039;t like that Astoria is basically a shower-station and sleeping-pod for some people who want proximity to Manhattan.&nbsp; &nbsp;If I wanted Manhattan, I&#039;d pay less than I&#039;m paying now for a grimy studio in Manhattan itself.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t like the inferiority complex that I sense about the other borough some Astorians refer to as &quot;the City.&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;ve lived in other neighborhoods in NYC off and on since I was a teenager.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hell&#039;s Kitchen - just south of Columbus Circle when it was bad but beautiful&nbsp; - decades before the Time Warner Center.&nbsp; &nbsp; Bond St. Manhattan before it was &quot;Noho.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; Close to the East River by Gramercy Park.&nbsp; &nbsp;Greenpoint, Brooklyn.&nbsp; &nbsp;Forest Hills, Queens.&nbsp; And a few more.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also lived in other cities and countries.<br /><br />I tramped around Astoria quite a bit before moving.&nbsp; Like I said, some of the drawbacks were apparent.&nbsp; &nbsp;I wrongly assumed that there&#039;d be unrevealed plusses and positives that would compensate.&nbsp; A mistake of optimism.<br /><br />I waited so long to post here, because I wanted to give Astoria a fair chance.&nbsp; &nbsp;I joined some of the local museums here in Queens.&nbsp; Volunteered at Mount Sinai here in Astoria.&nbsp; Requested more street trees from the Parks Department here:<br /><br />http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.a57f189830ce7553e333cd5701c789a0/index.jsp?subView=request_street_tree<br /><br />I gave it a good faith effort.<br /><br />I respect that those of you with love/affection/like for Astoria are sincere and justified in your feeling.<br /><br />I&#039;m giving another opinion for people thinking of moving to Astoria.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Astoria has more of a suburban feel, while still being sort of urban-suburban. I just feel like your negative living situation is causing you to judge the place as a whole with a feeling much more negative than those of us who have decent neighbors and decent roommates, and this seems to be true since you said you were inspired to make this post because of your ridiculous neighbors.

				Rose,<br /><br />So we know that you don&#039;t like the physical aesthetics and weren&#039;t thrilled with the food.<br /><br />I think the issues with your neighbors are the kinds of things that you can&#039;t blanket over the whole neighborhood. I&#039;m sorry that you had those experiences.<br /><br />Can you tell us what neighborhood you thought had the best aesthetic and which had the best food? I figure if you want to give other opinions to prospective residents, this could help them and help us understand why Astoria wasn&#039;t your place.

				That&#039;s the thing. &nbsp;Practically everything bad you&#039;ve experienced can be said about practically anywhere, and I don&#039;t see how any of it is unique to Astoria. &nbsp;Any street can have a lack of trees. &nbsp;Move to one that does. &nbsp;Any area can be far from a park. &nbsp;Move to an area with a park. &nbsp;I have found ugliness in every borough of NYC. &nbsp;Any city close to Manhattan will be used as a sleeping pod for SOME people, but not all. &nbsp;I see brick buildings in every borough of NYC, especially Manhattan. &nbsp;You&#039;ll find nosy neighbors and racist neighbors anywhere. &nbsp;You&#039;ll find bad businesses anywhere. &nbsp;You&#039;ll find bad restaurants everywhere. &nbsp;I too think that your negative experiences here have lead you to judge Astoria as a whole. &nbsp;If those are your complaints, Astoria has nothing to do with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;Either way, best of luck to you.

				I&#039;ve lived all around the Broadway area and always within 5 blocks from the train station. I have to agree with the original post about this part of Astoria. I really didn&#039;t like living there but I&#039;ve moved closer to the Park (Astoria Blvd/Ditmars) area and really like it. There&#039;s a lot of trees and watching the sunrise from my apartment and the light on the trees that leave a trail all the way to Hell Gate is a pretty amazing thing to see. Very beautiful in the Winter too and it&#039;s not an exclusive view. <br /><br />Just like every neighborhood, it isn&#039;t perfect. The W. Village has its poopie [DID THIS MESSAGE BOARD JUST REPLACE &quot;SH**Y&quot; WITH &quot;POOPIE&quot;? I&#039;LL KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT ON THIS ONE...] part. Park Slope, Brooklyn Heights, Williamsburg, East Village, MPD, Upper East and West sides. It&#039;s the in many other cities too. Maybe you should really give it a chance since you&#039;re sort of planted at the moment and explore it more before the end of the summer. <br /><br />All I can say is at least you gave it a shot. Whenever I go on vacation to another country, city, region I always come back depressed for a couple of days because New York City just doesn&#039;t compare to a lot of beautiful places out there but it is unique. It&#039;s a place where the personality of the people really make up the core of what we love about this city. If you want to stay in New York then there&#039;s not a whole lot out there that is a visual wonderland and the racist thing - that&#039;s everywhere. Try living in the South for a little while. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;[DID THIS MESSAGE BOARD JUST REPLACE &quot;SH**Y&quot; WITH &quot;POOPIE&quot;?

				I live in the broadway area too. There are a lot of things that are annoying, it&#039;s true. If I didn&#039;t know so many people here, I&#039;d be tempted to leave. But for me, the plusses of my awesome roommate, my awesome neighbors, my under 2K a month rent, the veggie markets, etc do outweigh the minuses. <br /><br />Another thought - I think that the flagrant racism is a counterpoint to the diversity here. This is one of the most diverse neighborhoods anywhere at all, and inevitably some people are bound to feel threatened by that and express their assholishness. <br />

				Astoria has the worst air quality in Queens thats a fact. &nbsp;its because of all the traffic from the Grand Central, its service road and entrance to the Triboro Bridge.<br /><br />As for trees, it depends on what block you are on.&nbsp; Head over to 36th street between 30th and 31st avenue.&nbsp; That block is awesome it looks like a forest.&nbsp; My mother&#039;s blocks also has large trees.&nbsp; <br /><br />As for the landlords/tenants well yea a lot of them are racist, but also remember they lived in Astoria at a time when it was primarily Greeks and Italians you would never see a Mexican, black or Indian anywhere.&nbsp; They will call them names yes, but its just because thats how they describe them.&nbsp; Theyre old farts who cares what they say.&nbsp; <br /><br />Neighbors are nosy but just ignore them and if they ask when and where you go just say none of your business.&nbsp; Most of the time they will shut up and leave you alone.

				Rose.<br />What can anyone of us say -- you don’t like it here. That’s your opinion and you’re entitled to it. Astoria is what it is and as much as people love the area, it’s not to everyone’s taste or suits everyone’s needs.<br /><br />Astorians are generous. If you were feeling down and needed to reach out ,I have no doubt that if you asked for help in a more positive way you would have been overwhelmed with offers of support and kind words from the many, many good people who frequent this site.<br /><br />Why after living in the neighborhood for a year you felt compelled to register on Astorians and offload this negativity as your debut posting I don’t know. If you’re depressed, I hope that you now feel better but note in doing so you made many people who love this neighborhood feel bad.<br /><br />Please don’t wrap it up as performing a public service. What you said says more about you than it does about Astoria, which doesn‘t need to be defended. I sincerely hope you can find a place to live that will make you happy.

				Although I agree with much of Rose&#039;s sentiments, I have to say that it&#039;s what I love about this neighborhood. <br />For the many of us who grew up here, recent times have brought about such a homogenization of the city. New high rises, luxury apartment buildings and generic (but fancy) chain stores are cropping up everywhere. I think Astoria has done a fairly decent job of staving that off so far. <br />As far as cost, I think it&#039;s one of the best deals in the city. I live in a very safe neighborhood, where I have no problems walking around by myself at 4 in the morning if I wanted to. Just like any neighborhood, there are pockets here and there where I would avoid late at night, but for the most part I&#039;m ok wherever. What I am paying in my place would elsewhere get me (If I was lucky) a place that&#039;s at least 20 minutes farther from my office by subway on an even more unreliable line, and probably shady neighborhood.<br />I definitely would advise most people that if they can afford $1500 per person room shares to go move to park slope or the UES. But for what I&#039;m paying, there is no where else I&#039;d rather live. <br /><br />As for the racism issue- I had a friend visiting me about two weeks ago, and he asked me why there were no black people in my neighborhood. This is something that never really occurred to me, but it made me think. I can&#039;t help but think there is some underlying racism going on either from old-school landlords or elsewhere. It seems that relative to the rest of the city, Astoria has a proportionally smaller percentage of Black residents.

				I either do not disagree or else I have no opinion on much of you say, though I think bringing racism into the mix is a stretch. We&#039;re in an area inhabited by virtually every race, creed, and religion on this earth, making racial tensions a near certainty. But it&#039;s a certainty pretty much anywhere. I encounter it in Astoria, but I also encountered in when I lived Upper West Side, Upper Manhattan, Upper East Side... To me these summertime Astoria street fairs are simply astonishing, to walk among people from everywhere without fear of firebombings and attacks. There can&#039;t be too many places like that.<br /><br />But where I take issue (and I mean no offense) is that you seem to blame your decision to move here in large part on the content of a message board, and to me that is borderline ridiculous. Message boards are useful for some things and entertaining for others, but (speaking for myself) this space does not look, feel, or sound too much like the Astoria I see when I look out the window or walk around outside -- in fact I would move far, far away from Astoria if my spoken curse words were magically replaced with euphemisms like POOPIE. <br /><br />But I don&#039;t mean to single out this board, nor do I mean anything specifically disparaging. I think the same could be said of almost any online space: the number of people who inhabit the online space and fill its pages represent a tiny, tiny fraction of the general population, making it ludicrous to characterize something like a city based on a bleepin&#039; message board. <br /><br />I used to manage message boards for some high profile web sites and it was no secret: the tiniest fraction of 1% of the sites&#039; millions of visitors ever even *considered* posting to a message board. I don&#039;t have any facts to support it now but I&#039;d bet that a similar ratio holds true in Astoria and elsewhere.<br /><br />In a sense I actually think your &quot;warning to lurkers&quot; is valid, but I think it&#039;s valid in a general sense that message boards are an unlikely resource for serious decision-making.<br />

				The only thing that I feel like adding to this thread is that we reconsider the use of the word &quot;we&quot;.&nbsp; As in, &quot;We don&#039;t want you here if you&#039;re just going to bash the neighborhood and it sounds like you&#039;d be happier elsewhere.&quot;&nbsp; That pesky two letter word has popped up in several posts in this thread, and I&#039;m certain that not everyone shares the sentiments expressed when &quot;we&quot; was used.&nbsp;

So bad that I&#039;m going to go to the Beer Garden and Sparrow tonight and drink my sad feelings away and then I&#039;m going to go up to my roof and stare off into the big city wondering why I can&#039;t be there instead.

I agreed with a lot of what the original poster&#039;s criticism.

				Sure...as far as events go... People have mentioned wanting more artsy events in Astoria and it&#039;s happening. People want to organize little meetups and they do. People have organized to clean the parks. Clean around the riverfront. Neighbors have met up to make their streets look nicer. They grow flowers, trees...Check out 36th street (I believe) between...oh geez. I forgot the streets. I believe it&#039;s between Astoria and the next street over. <br /><br />If you&#039;re talking about anything really big like tree planting on sidewalks and all of that, I wouldn&#039;t know because I don&#039;t have any complaints about my neighborhood other than the proximity of the grocery store but then I again I don&#039;t mind the exercise.<br /><br />I will say though that I will definitely do something about that silly mural underneath the railroad around the Ditmars stop. That&#039;s my only real complaint.

To get some sort of utopian vibe about Astoria from this board strikes me as reading the board with rose-colored glasses (no pun intended). It&#039;s obviously too late to change her mind though; her opinion seems so soured of the place and its residents that I doubt it would do her much good to relocate in the neighborhood, and now that she has posted here, even though she says she&#039;s still going to live here for a while, she&#039;s not willing to discuss it or really consider our viewpoints as they relate to hers. I do think the Ditmars area is much better suited to some people than the Broadway area is, myself included. They have a pretty different vibe. Anyone moving here should take that into account when looking for a place to live.

				For every nifty thing about the &#039;hood, there&#039;s a trade-off:<br /><br />- Relatively low-crime....assuming you take precautions. Don&#039;t leave your car windows open, even a crack; don&#039;t leave your bikes outside or locked w/a cable. <br /><br />- Roomy, charming apartment.....but falling apart and needing new flooring/carpeting/refridgerator/etc.<br /><br />- Cheap rent......on a very noisy corner/busy street.<br /><br />- Great selection of restaurants......if you can afford to eat out! (actually, plenty of affordable choices.)<br /><br />- Life-long residents who know what you&#039;re up to....this makes me feel safe, as I could care less what they think.<br /><br />All that said, I&#039;d LOVE to move to a quieter part of town, or to a better apartment, but consider myself pretty lucky to live here given my low-budget lifestyle. I happen to welcome the negative comments, as the rents seem to go up with every great review of the neighborhood! There really is a lot of hype.<br /><br /><br /><br />

She also, in essence, accused every member of astorians.com who makes positive comments about the neighborhood of&nbsp; engaging in hype -- is this valid? Does it mean a person who holds a&nbsp; positive opinion of Astoria and says so is simply lying? I found that, if anything, extremely dismissive.

I haven&#039;t lived in any neighborhood other than Astoria. Maybe I would like one of the other places she mentioned more than this one, but I&#039;ll *never* get that information from her posts because all she wants to say is &quot;Astoria bad&quot; without telling us what &quot;good&quot; is or looks like beyond &quot;oh, poetry!&quot;

What&#039;s the point? And if you want to say it&#039;s to warn others, well then, we need more specifics about the places you liked so that we can see if our opinions are like yours. I haven&#039;t lived in any neighborhood other than Astoria. Maybe I would like one of the other places she mentioned more than this one, but I&#039;ll *never* get that information from her posts because all she wants to say is &quot;Astoria bad&quot; without telling us what &quot;good&quot; is or looks like beyond &quot;oh, poetry!&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Paratactical,<br /><br />Asking people in this board for help might be your style, and maybe 28Grand&#039;s, but it&#039;s pretty safe to say it&#039;s looks like it&#039;s not hers.&nbsp; I can understand that you don&#039;t like her way, but that doesn&#039;t mean she had to express her views of the &#039;hood in yours or anybody&#039;s terms.<br /><br />She made clear since the beginning that her post was not intended for people that already live in Astoria. I think it is completely fair for her to express her opinion in whatever way and at the time she feels is more appropriate. <br /><br />I agree with you, though, as someone that is looking for a different neighborhood I would&#039;ve appreciated a description of what she normally likes, so I can better gage my tastes against hers.

				I like the Broadway area, but then I&#039;ve been here almost 15 years and seen all the changes, some good, others not as good, but on the whole positive.&nbsp; I love being between two train lines so I can get home easily.&nbsp; I love Michael&#039;s - the 24 hour diner on Broadway and their food and their staff, I really like the new restaurants popping up, though not all are to my taste.&nbsp; I&#039;m happy that we have a Bravo nearby now and that it&#039;s kept clean.&nbsp; I adore S&#039;Agapo and am going to try Philoxenia eventually.&nbsp; My block has a good number of trees, though I&#039;d love more.&nbsp; I love being able to walk to church and agree with Enigmacat, that bumping into folks I know makes my day (and it happens at least once if not more a day in Astoria).&nbsp; I do agree the architecture is lacking in our area, though that doesn&#039;t bother me as much.&nbsp; Would it be nice to live in an area that had brownstones, yes, do I need to be happy, no, not really.<br /><br />Sorry to hear you haven&#039;t enjoyed Astoria so far, Rueful_Rose.&nbsp; Hope you find elements of the neighborhood that you like.&nbsp; I&#039;d check out the Sculpture Park and the walking paths along the East River, they always cheer me up, and while Ditmars and Astoria Park are a bit of a hike, it&#039;s a nice hike in good weather and one I do regularly.

				I actually appreciate the eclectic architecture in Astoria. There are some beautiful old houses, and even the generic-looking apartments buildings I find charming and interesting- some of the new ones too. The brownstone-lined blocks of Park Slope, for example, just seem so monotonous and oppressively uniform to me. <br /><br />Also, I live in the &quot;Broadway Area&quot; and I love it. Ditmars is great too though, and I&#039;m sure I&#039;d be happy there (love those row houses on Ditmars). I work in real estate and know that a lot of people blame their surroundings and lack of money for their unhappiness. This is true for some instances, but usually those people are miserable wherever they move and however much money they have.

				Back to the original topic (people moving to Astoria because of this message board):<br /><br />I think that this board has actually made Astoria a better place to live for me. &nbsp;Because of the helpfulness of members of this board, I can get advice and recommendations about just about anything I could ever want in Astoria. &nbsp;I know where to get my haircut, where to find a good doctor in the area, where to eat, be entertained, where to shop, etc. &nbsp;It&#039;s also a great way to keep informed about what is going on in the community. &nbsp;If I have any concerns about the neighborhood, I can post them here and receive honest responses from other residents.<br /><br />Maybe the board IS a good reason for someone to move to Astoria!

				Random comments based on previous comments:<br /><br />True, I&#039;ve kept my car although I don&#039;t ever use it to get around within Astoria. I think that&#039;s a huge waste.&nbsp; <br /><br />I live in the Broadway area too and enjoy being between the N/W, R/G/V. The fact that they don&#039;t connect within Queens doesn&#039;t bother me. My car is parked off-street at Astoria Blvd and I take the N/W up and that doesn&#039;t bother me. I take a train to the comic shop at the Ditmars stop every Wednesday and that doesn&#039;t bother me. Moving here, I expected to take the train or walk a lot. I believe love for anywhere you live depends solely on your personal expectations. <br /><br />And, I love S&#039;Agapo, Bravo, Michael&#039;s (turkey burger, mmmm) and Omonia&#039;s chocolate cake. Where I&#039;m from, I would have to walk half mile out to the parking lot to my car, sit in 15 minutes of traffic at this stupid intersection from hell, waste $10 in gas and drive another 20-30 minutes just to get good chocolate cake. In fact, I lived there for 26 years and couldn&#039;t recommend a good chocolate cake. That&#039;s just embarrassing. My point is, Astoria is meeting and exceeding my expectations for a city so close to Manhattan.

				&nbsp; &nbsp; This is New York. Do you really expect clear skies and deer grazing by pristine streams with majestic peaks in the background? It&#039;s a big city, the air is dirty. I&#039;ve lived and worked in a lot of different neighborhoods, and I can definitely say that I&#039;ve seen worse, but I can&#039;t categorically say that I&#039;ve seen better. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Loving the neighborhood is a matter of opinion. My aunt loves the Upper East Side and would never live anywhere else. I lived there for 4 months. I started out by looking down on Astoria. When I got to know it (and the Upper East Side), I realized that I hate living on the Upper East Side and love Astoria. I&#039;ve lived here for a few years now. I still love Astoria. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; It seems you made a mistake. You listened to a bunch of strangers and moved somewhere without getting to know it for yourself to find out if you like it. It&#039;s not the board&#039;s fault, it&#039;s not the neighborhood&#039;s fault- you just moved to somewhere that&#039;s a bad fit for you. So you say &quot;Oops, I screwed up,&quot; and you find somewhere you like better. The board isn&#039;t misleading- it&#039;s a matter of differing opinion. It&#039;s your fault and yours alone if you didn&#039;t find out for yourself whether you liked the place before you moved here.

The G train is supposed to serve as a way to get through Brooklyn and Queens without having to go through Manhattan, but that&#039;s a joke too. The reason Manhattan is so commonly referred to as &quot;the city&quot; is because it IS &quot;the city.&quot; Just like suburbs of cities in other areas, many people move to those suburbs to live outside of the city and commute to it every day. The subway is laid out to favor Manhattan in this manner. And due to Astoria&#039;s proximity to Manhattan, the city [government] has viewed it as a convenient dumping ground for pollution generating devices like power plants. The highway/bridge traffic is also especially bad because it&#039;s the first place to the east of the city that leads to everywhere else. I don&#039;t think the city planners ever really expected Long Island City and Astoria to become sought after places to live. To me this is illustrated by Queensborough Plaza alone. Honestly, I think they&#039;re still fighting it, and I&#039;ve felt that way ever since it took 4 days in 2006 for the city to acknowledge that much of western Queens was in a blackout.<br /><br />But I still think you&#039;re downplaying the effect your crappy neighbors and just your immediate area have had on your opinion of Astoria as a whole. I&#039;m sorry but it seems, although you did ask to have a tree planted and you did join some Queens museums, and you biked around the area, you haven&#039;t really tried to get out and meet like-minded people. Most of the people who post here would&#039;ve had little chance to meet if not for this site, and most of the people who live in Astoria don&#039;t post here. Maybe the air quality would&#039;ve still been an impossible thing for you to get over (and that&#039;s completely understandable - it bothers me a lot too), and you&#039;d still find the architecture ugly, but I don&#039;t believe you&#039;d be as thoroughly bitter about Astoria as you are now.

				When I sense danger or anything offensive I immediately report it to the Moderators and stick my head in the sand to protect myself.<br /><br />But seriously, for all the flack we give the moderators they&#039;re just doing their job. You&#039;d be surprised at how fast this thread could have turned into a bitchfest about real estate brokers (of any nationality) and then other people chiming in and defending said real estate brokers saying they had a good experience with so and so. <br /><br />To get back on topic: I like Astoria, I think it&#039;s nice! Sorry you don&#039;t like it. I know lots of people who love living in Manhattan and would never leave and others who live in Manhattan and want to get the F out. I think this person is the first person I know of many who said they don&#039;t like Astoria and can&#039;t wait to move. Of course, if I had racist and nosy neighbors (or landlords) I probably wouldn&#039;t like Astoria either. <br /><br />Cheers!<br />Mike

				I am a Manhattan ex-pat and could be considered a pod person, sleeping in Astoria and working and socializing in Manhattan. &nbsp; Anything on the Ditmars side of the Grand Central/Triboro Bridge might as well be Siberia. &nbsp; After losing my illegal sublet in the West Village way back in &#039;87 I moved to Astoria and have been really happy here, mostly because of the short hop into Manhattan. &nbsp; <br /><br />I am very surprised people are so down on the Broadway area, though. &nbsp; I lived on 32nd Street between Broadway &amp; 34th Ave. between 1987 and 2001 and was very happy there. &nbsp; I never felt unsafe and unlike the 30th Avenue area where I now hang my hat, I liked the option of taking the N or the R. &nbsp; The shopping was great on Broadway. &nbsp; The block I lived on was mostly three-story owner-occupied homes. &nbsp; The block was family-oriented and if anything the kids playing in the street were too noisy. &nbsp;(I don&#039;t know why they didn&#039;t build more parks in Astoria back when it was developing so the kids would have a place to go afterschool, summers, etc.)<br /><br />In 20 plus years in Astoria I can&#039;t remember ever hearing any racist language, though I haven&#039;t really had many conversations with neighbors. &nbsp; I do know discrimination does exist when renting, particulary when you move into an owner-occupied dwelling. &nbsp; I remember back in &#039;87 the broker telling me that the landlords like Japanese tenants because they were &quot;clean&quot; and &quot;quiet.&quot; &nbsp; And there is preference for women versus men. &nbsp; I can distinctly remember the broker calling a landlord and wanting to send me over, but the landlord was adamant that they wanted a female tenant and I wasn&#039;t sent over. &nbsp;<br /><br />In more recent years I applied for a part-time job at a liquor store and the owner/manager looked at me and said &quot;we are looking for a woman.&quot; &nbsp; I said to myself &quot;is that legal.&quot; &nbsp; I guess he didn&#039;t have an HR department to advise him on the legal niceties.

				I meant...that statement was unacceptable. Because I made a generalization about Mexican day laborers as opposed to just day laborers.<br /><br />If the person above who got reprimanded said that real estate brokers are racist and discriminatory, etc., etc. - that&#039;s perfectly fine. The reason why it wasn&#039;t acceptable is because he said Greek real estate brokers.<br /><br />The person who chimed in and said that he personally got discriminated against by a real estate broker (without citing any race, religion, sex or sexual orientation) said nothing wrong and shouldn&#039;t have been in any way shape or form reprimanded. <br /><br />In my opinion anyway and I&#039;m 100% right all the time (excluding times when I&#039;m wrong).

				I&#039;m no moderator, but after spending more time than I should at work reading this thread, much of it has gone very off-topic.&nbsp; I think the discussions of board policy on racism belong somewhere else.<br /><br />As far as the main topic goes, judging by Rose&#039;s issues, I would say the biggest problem is that you have is you moved into the wrong place.&nbsp; You definitely could have found a tree lined street closer to the park.&nbsp; Hopefully your neighbors there wouldn&#039;t be racist.&nbsp; Many neighbors are nosy though... oy... are they nosy!<br /><br />The air quality and some of the other issues... not so much you can do anything about, but maybe solving the major issues would have made a difference to you.&nbsp; It&#039;s doubtful you&#039;ll be hanging around here, so good luck in your next destination.&nbsp; Come back and tell us where you end up and your impressions of that place.<br /><br />

				Actually his assumption isn&#039;t broad at all. It&#039;s very specific. <br /><br />It&#039;s his opinion or belief that <strong>his </strong> building discriminates against other people and he&#039;s perfectly entitled to his opinion. Whether or not it&#039;s true is for other people to decide for themselves. <br /><br />He has broken no rules whatsoever by stating his opinion. &nbsp;<br /><br />You may not like what he says or you might even be offended by the idea of it and you&#039;re perfectly entitled to feel that way. But that doesn&#039;t change the fact he didn&#039;t do anything wrong and he&#039;s entitled to express his opinion.

				Rose made me want to leave my home in Astoria - the one with the lovely, quiet, green backyard, the one with the amazing view of the park and the bridge, the great neighbors who are there in a flash to assist us when we need it, the house which is a sanctuary for me after a rough day at work, and she has made me want to return to my Manhattan apartment -<br /><br />the one with the freaks on every floor, including the &#039;stalker&#039;, the one where I was not able to sleep because of noise that never stopped, the one where the rats running in front of the building were the size of cats, the one where there was no air at all; and certainly not clean air, the one that I couldn&#039;t wait to leave -<br /><br />And this apartment was on 62nd Street between 1st and 2nd - a very &#039;upscale&#039; zip code!

I mean, walking around the neighborhood, if you are completely cognizant of everyone walking around the street and subway, it&#039;s irrefutable that there are a lack of African-Americans in the neighborhood. <br />It is just a theory that a lot of old-school landlords can still be racist because that&#039;s how things used to be, and we do have a lot of long-time homeowners in the neighborhood- I don&#039;t really have any evidence to back it up, I just think it&#039;s a possibility.&nbsp; My reasoning behind that is because most places in New York, we have a substantial African-American population, and comparably less in Astoria when contrasted against other neighborhoods. The only reasonable possibility I could come up with is that landlords are not really renting to African-Americans since I don&#039;t particularly see anything else that would deter a black person from living in a nice and reasonably priced area like ours. <br />

				Well then I have a whole bunch of landlords in St. Albans and Springfield Gardens that I want to accuse of discriminating against white renters.&nbsp; And I&#039;m basing my findings on the fact that there are no white renters in a large number of buildings in those neighborhoods.&nbsp; And after all, it&#039;s been said here that nearly 80% of the population in Queens is non-black.&nbsp; So it must be discrimination!&nbsp; &nbsp;:roll:<br /><br />The people here who say it is choice and individual selection are correct.&nbsp; People tend to choose to live in areas where they have stores, restaurants, houses of worship, etc. that are in line with their own culture and needs.&nbsp; There is always some spill over but you will find that most groups stay concentrated in certain areas.&nbsp; It&#039;s not due to force or discrimination.&nbsp; But a natural progression.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it&#039;s fair to look at the population of a building - or a neighborhood like Astoria - and claim discrimination.&nbsp; It only causes hostility for no reason.&nbsp; Of course, there is truth to the bat swinging kid in Howard Beach, or the occasional anti-Semitic scrawl in Forest Hills.&nbsp; But that just proves that idiots exist in all neighborhoods.&nbsp; But in most cases, I like to believe that today, most people live where they choose.&nbsp; But I could be totally naive.&nbsp; I also saw some stats in the NYT recently that said that in the past several years our black population has decreased substantially as they are relocating to Southern states in large numbers.&nbsp; So maybe it&#039;s a different trend entirely.

				There are landlords on my block who have openly stated in my presence that they will not rent to African Americans.&nbsp; I have some friends who have been, um, <em>discouraged</em> from certain parts/blocks/apartments of Astoria because they are African-American (yes, completely illegal, but of course that doesn&#039;t mean it doesn&#039;t happen).&nbsp; There may be some self-selection involved, but the roots of such self-selection are more likely self-preservation rather than an active desire not to live here.

				I remember a thread a few months ago started by an african-american woman who was interested in moving to Astoria but decided against it because there weren&#039;t enough black people in the area. So I guess it&#039;s a self-perpetuating problem.<br />It doesn&#039;t surprise me that there is redlining going on though. Some brokers just got busted for that in Brooklyn.
