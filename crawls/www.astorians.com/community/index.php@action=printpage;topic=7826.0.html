				Anyone know of any schools/programs/centers in LIC or Astoria that offer Spanish courses?&nbsp; Took many years in high school and college, but most of it has escaped me since.&nbsp; If anyone knows of a place, please let me know.<br /><br />Thanks, <br />Ashley

				I don&#039;t know of any in Astoria, but there are some in NYC.<br /><br />http://www.abclang.com - 12w for $425<br />http://tallerlatino.org - 4w, twice weekly, for $335.<br />http://spanishinstitute.org - 9w for $430<br /><br />Hopefully that&#039;s helpful. I happened to be researching this very thing last weekend. ;)<br />

				There are Spanish classes at Laguardia Community College in Long Island City also.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know much about them - only that they have them listed in the catalog.&nbsp; They&#039;re listed on page 44 in this pdf catalog http://ace.laguardia.edu/pdf/ACEFall07FINALB.pdf after &quot;auto repair&quot;

				What level do you guys think you&#039;re at? I&#039;m a beginner, but I&#039;ve been learning some of the basics. I&#039;ve been using coffeebreakspanish.com and I&#039;m around lesson 28 or so. That&#039;s a fantastic resource, by the way. I also have tried the Rosetta Stone software but I found the Radio Lingua podcasts to even be superior to that (probably due more to the convenience of being able to listen to it anywhere).<br /><br />Another good online resource is Rolling R&#039;s (http://rollingrs.com/). The short vid-casts helped me to understand the basic use of Spanish verbs.<br />

I&#039;m using Coffee Break Spanish too, and I love it. Wait till you hear their new theme song (lesson 30, I think) - it&#039;s hilarious. I feel like it&#039;s just as good as a class, especially because you can review the programs and really practice your speaking. Also much cheaper and more fun! Have you used any of the premium materials?<br /><br /><br /><br />

I figure they deserve some of my hard-earned cash, they obviously put a lot of effort into the podcast.

				I&#039;m in the same boat as many of you, I took my first Spanish class in middle school and then took a few classes in high school and in college.&nbsp; At some point, I was at an intermediate level in spoken and written Spanish but have lost my connection with the language since then.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been researching some places to take classes because I would like to eventually become fluent but don&#039;t want to spend too much money in the process. Are podcasts, online programs, cds, etc. effective?
