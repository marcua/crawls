				I noticed pretty quickly that someone had put graffiti on one of the walls of the new public construction near my house.&nbsp; I called 311 to report it (probably a couple of weeks later), figuring that they would get someone to clean it off.&nbsp; They gave me a service request number, so I could check on the progress.&nbsp; I called last night to check on it.<br /><br />The operator said that there was an arrest made in relation to the graffiti!&nbsp; How that happened two weeks later, I have no idea.&nbsp; Anyway, I asked when it would be cleaned up and he said I hadn&#039;t requested a clean up.&nbsp; So I said I&#039;d like to do that and he said there is no way to do it.&nbsp; It went back and forth for a little bit and was very frustrating.&nbsp; Basically, it seems like no one will clean up graffiti on public land and they leave it for &quot;local civic groups&quot; to do and they can request paint and supplies from the Mayor&#039;s office. <br /><br />Does this sound odd to anyone else?

				That sounds very odd to me, especially since the new Vallone graffiti law allows the city to remove graffiti from private buildings then charge the property owner for the service (if the property owner refuses to clean it up themselves)!<br /><br />I&#039;d suggest a classic customer-service trick. If you don&#039;t like the answer you&#039;re getting, hang up, call again, and talk to a different CSR. :)

The information must result in the arrest and conviction of individual(s) for violations of Administrative Code Provisions or Penal Law Statues regarding graffiti vandalism. This program will be administered by the City-Wide Vandals Task Force.</em>&nbsp; :lol:
