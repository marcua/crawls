				cbcia25, not sure if you&#039;ve already done a search for &quot;brunch,&quot; on this site, but there are lots of threads here talking about different places, some of which you&#039;ve already gone to, and some places you haven&#039;t tried yet:<br /><br />here&#039;s one<br />http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=8510.0<br /><br />and here&#039;s another with specific reviews:<br />http://astorialogues.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=20&amp;start=0&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a<br /><br />Hope that gets you started, and post back with your results!

				Fatty&#039;s on Crescent and Ditmars has a brunch that&#039;s a little out there and pretty good. The price is right, a drink is included and the polenta cakes are awesome.<br /><br />For dinner style fair in the Ditmars area, I like Igloo. They make great juice.<br /><br />If you want to go cheap, gritty and quick, there&#039;s the Family Corner on 31st St and 21st Ave. For $5 you can get a pretty decent omlette with all the fixin&#039;s.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know the other parts of Astoria&#039;s brunch as well as the Ditmars scene, but those are my favorites there. I will also make the trek down to Michael&#039;s on Broadway because the food is good, but for $12 you get two drinks too, which is a big part of what I love about brunch.&nbsp; :-D (Or any meal, really, I guess...)

				I agree with Paratactical - Michael&#039;s on Broadway is a great choice.<br />I would imagine Mojave is good too, but haven&#039;t tried it out yet.<br />Cafe Triskell down on 36th Avenue is also nice.

				Cronin and Phelan and Stove both have good brunches. They do&nbsp; however have limited menu&#039;s so if you are looking for a whole slew of options these might not be the best choices. <br /><br />For a good old fashion diner brunch I love the New Bel Aire and Michael&#039;s.

				I tried Time Cafe (http://www.timecafeny.com/index.php?page=brunch) on 45th and Broadway a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp; Nice place, great atmosphere, and their french toast was fantastic.&nbsp; Downside was that the muffins they serve (instead of bread) were a little hard, and it took a little longer than expected to get our food, considering there were only three or four tables occupied.&nbsp; Still, I&#039;d go back just for the french toast. :)

				A favorite brunch combo of mine is McCanns and baseball around 1pm on a Sunday in the summertime.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I also like Igloo for brunch.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had good brunch at Time Cafe and Mojave.&nbsp; When Maria worked there, I loved Zorbas.&nbsp; Ovelia was nice, though my corn cakes were a bit cold and dry (tho the sausage was delicious!).<br /><br />I have been curious about Soho&#039;s brunch - that Mediterranean place on Broadway across from Time Cafe.&nbsp; Anyone been?

Like making their french toast with chocolate chip croissants. Sure, that might be really good, but you should tell people on the menu when there&#039;s weird ingridients in common dishes. So if you go to either, you have to make sure to ask what&#039;s in the dishes or else you end up with chocolate when it&#039;s really not what you wanted at all.<br /><br />Just my $.02.<br /><br />(I also think they&#039;re pretty expensive.)

				By brunch, do you mean drinking alcohol and eating?<br /><br /><br />There are lots of choices for brunch, many mentioned, that I would enjoy again.<br /><br /><br />But if I just want to eat around the time of breakfast/lunch, then 6 times out of 10 I expect to be at Igloo. <br />By the crowds, it seems half of Astoria likes it too.<br /><br /><br /><br />But I prefer juice/smoothies to early spirits.<br />And many yummy options.<br /><br /><br />++ maple syrup available ++&nbsp; &nbsp;:-P

				A few years ago, Cup had my favorite neighborhood brunch, but alas, once they changed owners it went right down the tubes. Locale has great brunch food, but the service that time of day was lacking the couple of times I went. Sandford&#039;s is a reliable standby, and Mundo makes some very unusual and tasty breakfast-ish things. I hear Valverde&#039;s eggs can&#039;t be beat, but so far I have only been there for dinner. I might need to remedy that very soon...

				The drinks were weak. The food was so so, and the menu was VERY limited (and overpriced). Service was slow for a not so busy place.&nbsp; We had to &quot;wait at the bar&quot; for a table, even though half the place was empty. (I think it was just a ploy to get us to buy a round of drinks). Would never go back.

				prices are reasonable, tho drinks are not included. you can get grilled pineapple with ice cream on a pancake (or a waffle?), or a plate of savory pastries, or a plate of sweet pastries, or just a single croissant. there&#039;s lots of other stuff but i actually have been getting the oatmeal with brown sugar and bananas a lot, because it&#039;s been cold and i&#039;ve wanted stick-to-the-ribs food.

				I&#039;ve tried their crabcakes and the were made with Surimi. So i don&#039;t think they would buy real crab for brunch. Perhaps if they read this post they might reconcider.<br />I like surimi but only in my cali rolls and seafood salad with avocado, cilantro, shrimp, octopus, lemon juice, and a great Spanish olive oil with some olives and a touch of cumin. :mrgreen:

				How much is Stove&#039;s brunch?<br /><br />Regarding Euro Delights, thanks for the link, urrisgirl. I actually really like that place so I was curious about it. I haven&#039;t been going as often though, because the waitress annoys the crap out of my friends, they really dislike the service we get from her. I agree she&#039;s not all that great, but, I don&#039;t take it as hard as they seem to. Luckily, we only go at night and that old guy isn&#039;t there. I&#039;m a little confused about it though, because the old guy who sits in the corner staring at people, I seem to think he has gray hair, and the owner, the son, the one that looks kinda like he used to be a boxer, his hair is sort of red. I dunno maybe I&#039;m nuts.<br /><br />What about Flo? How much is their brunch. I ate brunch for the first time in my life at fattys like 4 weeks ago, and now I&#039;m liking the idea of brunch more and more.

				I like Grand Cafe. They have outdoor seating, $11 for food, coffee, and drink (i think), and the best mini-muffins EVER. Service is slow though, and it&#039;s a total scene. For a diner brunch, the place on the corner of Broadway and Steinway is good, high-quality ingredients, good coffee, service, etc.<br /><br />718 - Food was just so-so, drinks were terrible (WAY too much booze in the bloody mary, it was just red-colored vodka) and high prices. Nice to be able to sit outside on Ditmars, but not worth it, IMO.<br /><br />Igloo - ok, but definitely get the home fries. Hash browns are a soggier, straight-from-the-freezer version of McD&#039;s.<br /><br />Diners - why not? No booze though.<br /><br />Stove - pretty good, but the coffee isn&#039;t very high quality (but it IS expensive), the options are limited, and it&#039;s a bit expensive for what you get.<br /><br />Eurodelights - I like it, but the atmosphere leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />That place on Broadway at 21st is terrible! It&#039;s glorified diner food <br /><br />

				Today we tried Grand Cafe when the BF said he wanted &quot;brunch outdoors.&quot; I did warn him that we&#039;d be paying more for it, and get lesser quality.<br /><br />Their prix fixe seemed reasonable: $11 gets you a hot and cold beverage; potatoes; toast; entree; minimuffins. I got the Mediterranien omlette and he go eggs Benedict. <br /><br />Mine was okay, warm, though overcooked; his was on the cold side. Understaffed, so maybe our meal waited around too long before being served. Great place for catching up with people and lingering- we certainly weren&#039;t rushed out which is refreshing. Music was kinda lounge-y but bearable.

				Best time to hit Grand to avoid the obnoxiously loud music is before 12 or after 3. ; ) The service tends to be somewhat faster during those periods, but that too, is hit or miss and will often depend on your waiter/ress. Some are excellent, some suck! Yes, I love those mini muffins and the fact that they vary them, corn some days, blueberry the next-today chocolate chip!

				I like Indigo&#039;s brunch, good food and it&#039;s pretty reasonable--$13.95, which includes 2 drinks. They have a killer bloody mary (I was never really a bloody mary person until I had Indigo&#039;s, now I get one every time I go for brunch). I usually get the eggs benedict.<br /><br />And they have a nice pseudo-outdoor area in the back (large room in the back with a removable roof in the nice weather).<br /><br />(Indigo is on 31st St. betw. 30th Ave &amp; Newtown, right off the 30th Ave N/W)

				I&#039;m partial to Ovelia, but it&#039;s primarily for their incredible sausage.

				Has anyone tried the Bistro&#039;s brunch? I&#039;m trying to figure out where to take my parents this Sunday and I&#039;m debating between Bistro a Boite, Stove and Brick.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never had brunch at any of them. I&#039;ve had fantastic dinners at Boite and Stove, but wanted to see if anyone has checked them out.

				Just breezing through the posts and came across this thread, and thought I&#039;d put in my 2 cents.<br /><br />We have been to this place 4 times for brunch and it has been on the money all 4 times. The Service was friendly and on cue with the dishes they recommended. They have a broad offering of dishes and the ones we had were indeed fresh including the Sushi, and it was comforting to have seen an Asian preparing it (it just confirmed the way it tasted).<br /><br />Micheal one of the managers their was very friendly and down to earth and always greeted us when we visited. <br /><br />Oh and they have this nice red Greek wine, all i remember is that it&#039;s 1st on the list and comes from some monastery.<br /><br />Joe had a fresh extracted apple and carrot juice which was better than your usual OJ. Which they by the way squeeze fresh.<br /><br />One of the hits was the choclate french toast with apples, just ask waiter/res for extra apples!<br /><br />So enjoy brunch at FLO. :mrgreen:

				Grand Ave. has great food. The service is hit or miss. The one constant is that the music is <strong>always</strong> offensively loud. I&#039;ve eaten there over 100 times and never after 8pm. I used to grab a quick omelet about twice a week on week day mornings and the music was still at &quot;night club&quot; volume. <br /><br /><br />Sanford&#039;s on Broadway is can&#039;t miss.<br /><br />Indigo on 31st street is very reliable.<br /><br />I liked Locale on 35th ave. the times I was there but it was never crowded while I was a patron. Also - the last time I was there was over 6 months ago.<br /><br />Cronin&#039;s on Broadway is the best hangover food hands down for those who enjoy excessive weekends. The owner is a real character and I like him. I&#039;ve spoken to him several times and he told me he buys nearly all of the food himself. His fish comes from Marino&#039;s on 30th ave.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

Not especially crowded but I came within the last 45 mins. of Brunch.<br /><br />Sat in the back with the retractable arched translucent roof open. I can&#039;t think of any place else that has such a thing. A little humid But pretty cool. A gas fireplace (not on) and two flat screen TVs.<br /><br />My well competent newbie waitress was a dark eyed beauty named Daniela. I had asked the pointed question regarding the maple syrup touted on the menu.&nbsp; She checked it out for me inside...Guess what...it was &#039;table syrup&#039;. At least she was honest. I had the Ranchos Huevos (sp?), they were quite good. The two bloody mary&#039;s I had were quite good too.<br /><br />Daniela brought me some comp flat bread and tomato / herb / olive pate, very good..and free. She also brought a comment card with the check. Hey, they&#039;re open to suggestions. I really have a pet peeve about table syrup being passed off as advertised Maple Syrup....absolutely a deal breaker with me.
