				Hi!&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for activities for my 1 year old to be able to interract with other kids his age.&nbsp; I was hoping for something weekly for only 1-2 hours.&nbsp; I already know abt Aardvarks? (the music class at the church on 41st and Ditmars) but I was hoping there would be other places I could go to.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any info would be helpful!<br /><br />

				There is a meetup group called Astoria Stay at Home Moms<br /><br />http://sahm.meetup.com/817/<br /><br />You don&#039;t have to be a stay at home mom to join - but I think most of the members are (at least for a while anyway). <br />This group probably has an average of 10 activities per week for moms and their babies (or toddlers), sometimes just for moms and sometimes whole family activities.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t even had my baby yet (fingers crossed that he will make an appearance any day now of his own accord) but I&#039;ve been to a few meetups - have met some great families in the neighborhood and am looking forward to having lots of stuff to do this fall/winter while I&#039;m off from work.&nbsp; <br /><br />The group is definitely worth checking out.&nbsp; <br /><br />Jen
