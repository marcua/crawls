				I&#039;m looking for more information about this. I am devastated. Apparently the priest at the church plans to tell the parishioners this weekend. The entire school property is getting sold. I&#039;m still trying to find out if the church will be sold too. Please post any information you may know. This is sad news for Astoria. It will not become an academy.

				We are getting info in bits and pieces. The priest claims that the building costs too much to repair. That is a lie. I&#039;ve been in there a million times. It&#039;s a well maintained.He is retiring soon. The school has money. Media is showing up next week. There is a meeting at 6pm this Wednesday. Come support us. The priest wants to rent out the building is what I hear now.

				That&#039;s a bummer. I just rode my bike past the church the other day and heard the church bell chimes. Such pretty music. Regular church bell music is something you hear less and less as time goes on.<br /><br />I hope the school is saved but I highly doubt a priest can rent out a church. It is owned by the Archdiocese of Brooklyn. They probably need to sell it because they are struggling to stay above water financially.

				According to the Save Most Precious Blood facebook group, it is being given or sold to the NYC board of ed to become a public school. We will learn more at mass this morning. This is indeed a hard hit to parents of children, and hard working teachers and staff who have kept the school running.<br /><br /><br />Instead off accusations of greed, maybe we can be more constructive and let people who are affected by this decision know about alternatives. from the Catholic grade school perspective, we are looking at both St Joseph&#039;s and Immaculate Conception. Does any parents or former students have insight on those? Also, if anyone knows of a k-8 alternative please chime in.

				Please share with us what he says at mass. I&#039;m going to the meeting 7pm on Wednesday. The school cant be a charter school. It doesn&#039;t meet some sort of code. My children will be going to St. Joseph. I am changing my parish too, and we have many decades worth of history at MPB. St. Joseph is an excellent school. They have 2 of each grade. I know teachers there. The school is in good shape and it is an academy.

				St Francis of Assisi school is still an option as far as I know, so that makes three Catholic schools in the area.<br /><br /><br />The closing of Most Precious Blood school is very sad but if enrollment can&#039;t support the school, the options to keeping it open are limited. In my day, there were about 800-900 kids in my catholic grammar school.<br /><br /><br />Here is a list of Catholic schools in Queens:<br />http://dioceseofbrooklyn.org/schools/catholic-elementary-schools-and-academies-in-queens/<br /><br /><br />The closest outside the neighborhood are St. Sebastian in Woodside and Our Lady of Fatima and St. Joan of Arc in Jackson Heights

				Aren&#039;t these decisions controlled by the Diocese?<br /><br />I only ask because it seemed that Church/Schools mergers and closures seemed to come from higher up and I recall reading that another batch of these was hitting NYC soon.&nbsp;

				If it&#039;s going to be a new public school....then we should advocate for a Gifted and Talented (GNT) school.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are a lot of parents in this district whose kids are eligible for the GNT program, but there aren&#039;t enough seats available for them.<br /><br />Well, with this closing, potentially, you have about at least 30 more seats.&nbsp; &nbsp;That would make a bad situation much better.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				For those of you whoare still following this story, Victoria Zunitch reports in the Queens Chronicle last week that MPB received an offer from a real estate development firm to buy their parking lot either in exchange for donation toward the renovation of the church and school and/or cash. <br />[size=0pt]<span style="font-family: Arial;" class="bbc_font">http://www.qchron.com/editions/central/firm-offers-to-save-most-precious-blood/article_1ea4fa22-e910-5a46-a98b-742e7f5a03dd.html</span>[/size]
