				It&#039;s a little disconcerting, walking around the Ditmars nabe and seeing so many stores &quot;Going Out Of Business.&quot; Not that they&#039;re stores I frequent- the 50% Off card store; the uber-girlie accessories place; a jewelry store- but it still worries me. <br /><br />What is is about this place that attracts so much of the same businesses ad nauseum that we don&#039;t even use much? Nail salon/Euro cafe/ Staples/bank/99 cents.<br /><br />Is there any hope of attracting a Borders or B&amp;N if these little places can&#039;t survive?

				A store will stick around if it is successful...so while many of us (maybe on this board) don&#039;t frequen them, the dollar stores do have a market, and if they are sticking around, must have customers.<br /><br />I was walking on ditmars today also and saw the closing signs a little more hopefully. The neighborhood is changing and hopefully some cool new store will the place.<br /><br />B&amp;N would be nice, though I&#039;m not sure I would ike it on Ditmars, more so STeinway...

				I noticed today that the UPS store on Ditmars is being turned into another 50% off card store.&nbsp; I mean, how many 50% of card stores can one neighbourhood support?&nbsp; (Yes, yes, twice as many as full-price card stores, but. . . .)&nbsp; There&#039;s another empty storefront on Ditmars between 36th and 35th (used to be the furniture store), and another one at the corner of 32nd (was Brazilianaki - is that the uber-girlie accessories place you mention, Christine?).&nbsp; And the smoke shop/luggage shop under the train is also closing (I&#039;ve always wondered at the combination....).&nbsp; I wish I could view all of this hopefully and think cool stores are coming in, but I&#039;m still pretty sceptical.&nbsp; I hope I&#039;m wrong!

				Hmmm.......so maybe the 50% Off card store on 31st is relocating to the former UPS place.....<br /><br />The girlie place on Ditmars closer to Starbucks (not the one next to Fresca Tortilla) is having a closeout sale. The other one closed a while ago.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and the tatoo parlor on 23rd Ave. just closed. <br /><br />I&#039;d like to remain hopeful, too......but what can possibly thrive? I wouldn&#039;t mind another Freeze Peach- an American-style cafe for when the others get too crowded. Or another mini branch of Strand Books (since they&#039;re good at maintaining that book stand on Fifth Ave., why not a small store on Ditmars?)<br /><br />Where McDonald&#039;s used to be, perhaps a high-end (as opposed to family-oriented) bike store. With a coffee bar inside. And a laundromat on one side and a great bar on the other.&nbsp; :lol: ahhh now we&#039;re talkin&#039;.......!

				here&#039;s what i have wanted for the 5+ years i have been living in astoria: a decent bar.<br /><br />that said, i have some very specific criteria:<br /><br />1. a selection of draft beer served by people who really like beer.<br />2. as few baseball / football watching queens thick-necks as possible.<br />3. music at appropriate volume levels.<br />4. a generous amount of space to comfortably accommodate crowds.<br />5. very few comfy couches or other requisite astoria &#039;lounge&#039; amenities.<br />6. a 7-days-a-week happy hour.<br /><br />i&#039;ve been encouraged by the transformation of the neighborhood population in recent years, but find it disheartening to wait for the bus on ditmars and watch every new resident going to the train to go out in another neighborhood. in order for this trend to stop there has to be some amenity or genuinely unique place(s) to keep the residents here and draw others to the neighborhood (other than greek restaurants).<br /><br />a recent visit to the east village / alphabet city showed me just how far we need to come. but name a desirable neighborhood and you will find a watering hole (or ten) that the residents go to &#039;all the time&#039;.

				This area attracts so many cheap places because most of the people around here don&#039;t want to spend a lot of money on products. They want the cheapest stuff that gets the job done. For those who do want to spend more money on higher quality products, we now have Mimi&#039;s Closet and Inside Astoria, though those are the only two places that seem to cater to a more spendy group of people. I don&#039;t understand the bank thing, though. Is there some kind of bank incentive around here?

For what its worth, I still bank at the credit union back home where I&#039;ve had an account since I was 4 and used to deposit my allowance in. If I ever need a check deposited or anything, I just mail it to them, and they&#039;re so small that its no big thing. Not the most convenient, but it works for me. And...free everything! (Except other banks ATM fees, but I get around them by paying debit and getting cash back).

				perhaps my example of alphabet city was hasty but i was just commenting on a recent experience where i sat on a saturday afternoon without a care in the world.<br /><br />i do take exception to having a decent bar(s) leads to excessive noise and vomiting. some of my favorite watering holes have been in very quiet neighborhoods. responsible/loyal locals and patrons are the best way to police undesirable behavior.

				I wonder if the proliferation of banks is to try to get new customers who don&#039;t have accounts anywhere yet. Many new immigrants and those working in lower economic classes have never had a bank account, and I assume in banking it&#039;s the same as most industries where acquiring customers is a very expensive task but a main concern and focus also.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any chance (danger!) of an east village/LES hell arising anywhere in astoria since it&#039;s mostly all established neighborhoods and residents. Other than Williamsburg (at least the Bedford stop), Brooklyn doesn&#039;t have anywhere I&#039;m aware of approaching the nuttiness of EV/LES for example. I think a few more sparrow-ish places to balance the pubs/sportsbars and cafebars could survive without things tipping over. I lived in alphabet city for a few years in the late 90s when it really started exploding, and i hope that doesnt&#039; happen here -- well actually as long as it doesn&#039;t happen on 30th Ave where I live ;-)&nbsp; &nbsp;Astoria is way larger than the EV and related areas. Someone just needs to go ahead and take the plunge and open something; any entrepreneurs here?

				Half, really? Doesn&#039;t seem like that many to me. Also as long as new things keep popping up, things closing isn&#039;t necessarily a bad sign. I wonder what might show up at the discount store (under astrologer) between the fruit stands, across from Key Foods. That&#039;s a good-sized space. I wonder if the astrologer can see into the future and tell us. I&#039;m gonna keep my money though, someone else can try that ...

Back when I was a kid, there was a great, family-owned deli on that block (I think where the Chinese restaurant/fish store are) and the neighborhood has been lacking one ever since (Dave &amp; Tony&#039;s aside). And next to the Greek food store/the space that the greek food store just moved into was an old school soda fountain/newstand run by a guy named John. On my way home from school everyday my friends and I would stop for an egg cream and play some pinball. Good times, good times. Too bad the neighborhood probably wouldn&#039;t be able to support someplace like that anymore, and it would probably attract obnoxious hoodlum teenagers anyway.<br /><br />Too bad we can&#039;t just rewind to 1979... guess I&#039;d be perfectly happy then.&nbsp; :wink:

				NYCMacUser, I remember Norgaard&#039;s fondly -- best 7 layer cake I&#039;ve ever had and the women who worked there were always so nice and gave me a cookie whenever I went in with my parents. IIRC, Norgaard&#039;s was next door to the Chinese restaurant you mentioned (Shanghai, I believe). I remember the name Avon Bakery, but can&#039;t recall where it was... it&#039;s been driving me crazy since I read your post. And I remember Brights -- the owner&#039;s name was George (as was his son, I believe). He was a friend of my father&#039;s. I think the refrigerator in my kitchen right now was from there (note to self: tell landlord it&#039;s time for a new refrigerator... ). I agree that some of the changes in the neighborhood have been great and reflect the growing diversity of the Astoria community, but I also think it&#039;s kind of sad to say goodbye to some of the places that bring back fond memories of my childhood... heck, I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll ever get over losing Keystone! <br /><br />Thanks for the trip down memory lane!

				barrister15, Avon Bakery was on the same block closer to the el. And you are so right about that 7-layer cake. It really had 7 layers; it melted in your mouth. They did my sweet 16 party cake in 7-layers. Norgaard was a made-up name. They were really Hungarian! Do you remember their strudel? OMG. They also did a chocolate kugelhopf to die for.<br /><br />Do you remember Sokol&#039;s on Steinway Street? Or the two five and dime stores we had? Woolworth was one, the other I think was a McCrory&#039;s. <br /><br />I went to PS 6, which is now the parking lot, and my girlfriends and I used to go once a week to Woolworth&#039;s for lunch. We always got the same thing: the BLT plate. It came with coleslaw, a slice of pickle, french fries and an orange soda. We each came with our 50 cents allowance and, after lunch, we used to pool the rest of our money and buy a pound of potato chips from the candy counter which they would put in a brown paper sack. My parents&#039; would have killed me if they ever found out. I was raised in a Glatt Kosher home!<br /><br />I&#039;m probably talking long before your time. Hell, I am so old, I dated Moses in High School!

My family has been in Astoria since the 50&#039;s, so even if I don&#039;t remember seeing the places you&#039;re talking about, I&#039;m sure I&#039;ve heard about them... my mom graduated from Bryant in &#039;53 (I think) and my uncle around 10 years later and they would always tell stories about their incredibly misspent Astoria youth.
