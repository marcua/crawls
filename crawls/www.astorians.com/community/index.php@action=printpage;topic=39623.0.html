				I was surprised to hear this. They had just celebrated their 25th anniversary in 2016 and had a sign that said hope to serve you another 25 years. My guess is either their rent was spiked or their lease was not renewed.

				Apparently Bargain Stop has been in a long and heated court battle with the owner of the building. The owner of the fruit stand across the street bought the building Bargain Stop and the two buildings that followed, and plan to demolish all three to put up - you guessed it - another monstrosity apartment building that the neighborhood infrastructure can&#039;t handle. <br /><br />Bargain Stop has been a neighborhood institution and has come in handy plenty of times - I will be very sad to see it go. I&#039;ll never shop at that fruit stand again. Greedy jerk.

				Gentrification is awesome. Can&#039;t wait for prices to go up even further.

				While I can&#039;t fault the property owner for wanting to develop it, I am concerned with the size and scope of what will replace it. A oversized luxury apartment building is one thing Astoria does need more of.

				I really don&#039;t like the look of all the tall building being built in Astoria.&nbsp; It&#039;s starting to look like the city

				Well, Astoria IS the city, and our population is growing and that won&#039;t be stopped no matter who may wish it could.&nbsp; Taller buildings are the only solution.&nbsp; That&#039;s not to say that tall buildings are appropriate everywhere.&nbsp; I think they work better on 21st Street and the waterfront, more so than 30th Avenue, or Broadway.&nbsp; I also can&#039;t fault the landowner from realizing the potential.&nbsp; Hopefully what is built allows for retail and residential that suits the business district and doesn&#039;t look outrageous compared to what&#039;s already there. A mid-rise building is already going up next to Katch and I see they kept to a traditional design with red brick.&nbsp; People may object to the height but at least it will fit in with its neighbors.&nbsp; Compared to what&#039;s happening in Queens Plaza, we&#039;re taking baby steps - which is good.
