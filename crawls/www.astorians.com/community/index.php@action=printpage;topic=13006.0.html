				I&#039;ve been following the aftermath of the passage of this terrible proposition (banning same sex marriages in California, seeking to overturn the California constitutional protections against equality for all people).&nbsp; It&#039;s been terribly upsetting that this could pass on the same day we elected our wonderful new President, and in a state he carried easily.&nbsp; <br /><br />The LGBT community and our allies are mobilizing to fight for marriage equality and many are seeking to hold the Mormon Church responsible for their huge preponderance of the funding for two of the three anti-LGBT marriage amendments that passed on November 4.&nbsp; There is a huge protest outside the Mormon Temple called for tomorrow night (Wednesday 11-12-08).&nbsp; I&#039;ll post the details in a bit.<br /><br />I found this link and thought it was moving and wanted to share it.<br /><br />http://www.davidmixner.com/2008/11/keith-olbermanns-powerful-and-moving-statement-on-proposition-8.html&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyone else following this issue and the protests in California in the amendment&#039;s aftermath?

				Obama should push through civil unions with full marriage-type legal benefits for the entire country. The Defense of Marriage Act should be done away with (which apparently he&#039;s said he wants to do, so great!). I think that would be a good start, and I don&#039;t think a civil rights issue like this should be left up to the states. But start with civil unions. Leave marriage as a religious ceremony between a man and a woman so the evangelicals don&#039;t have to get so angry about &quot;marriage&quot; being desanctified. Fine. But, as far as the federal government is concerned, there should be no difference between a marriage and a civil union.

				That&#039;s the thing.&nbsp; Plenty of heterosexuals get married in nonreligious ceremonies and their marriages are never questioned by anyone.&nbsp; It&#039;s still called a &quot;marriage&quot;.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a &quot;civil union&quot;.&nbsp; So why are heterosexuals the only ones supposedly allowed to use this word?<br /><br />This sanctioning of discrimination by the voters in Florida, Arizona, and California is despicable and a sad comment on our society.&nbsp; There&#039;s a long way to go, and I stand with you!

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints was, by far, the biggest financer of California&#039;s heinous and hateful Proposition 8. The Mormon Church begged their members to donate money to Prop 8, pouring 20 million dollars into the campaign. And their attacks on us didn&#039;t start there and aren&#039;t about to end. They&#039;re plotting right now to bring their money and influence to bear against the LGBT community everywhere in this country, including trying to prevent marriage equality in New York. <br /><br />Join us in speaking out against hate and discrimination!

				Yeah ... 17 year olds get married because they are pregnant, older women get married because they are anxious to have babies, some people marry just for financial or social stability, some people marry for citizenship ... all of those marriages are considered valid. No one suggests that they are a threat to marriage as an institution or that they should be prevented from getting married (except for the citizenship one). <br /><br />I do think he should push civil unions rather than marriages just because it is far more likely to pass.

But apparently these people don&#039;t give a s___ what people do in their marriages, how many times a person gets married, or how many divorces there are, just as long as it&#039;s not the gay people marrying each other. So let them keep their marriage while giving everyone the option of civil unions. And you can bet there&#039;d be a whole new market created just for &quot;civil union ceremonies&quot; (would they still be called weddings if it&#039;s not a marriage?), and eventually I think more non-religious straight people would start drifting towards civil unions also. It&#039;s a win-win.

				You know what really pisses me off?<br />The fact that I am reading up on the Prop8 Supporters for some perspective, and their central argument focuses on the notion that their kids will be taught in school that Gay Marriage is the same as heterosexual marriage. You know what- There was a time when parents feared that kids would be taught in school that black people are the same as white people. These people need to stop cramming their stupid &quot;values&quot; down everyone else&#039;s throats. <br /><br />Some other fact/fiction from http://www.noonprop8.com/ (http://www.noonprop8.com/):<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Fiction: Prop 8 doesn’t discriminate against gay people.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Fact: Prop 8 is simple: it eliminates the rights for same-sex couples to marry. Prop 8 would deny equal protections and write discrimination against one group of people—lesbian and gay people—into our state constitution. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Fiction: Teaching children about same-sex marriage will happen here unless we pass Prop 8.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Fact: Not one word in Prop 8 mentions education. And no child can be forced, against the will of their parents, to be taught anything about health and family issues at school. California law prohibits it.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; California’s top educators including Superintendent of Schools Jack O’Connell and California Teachers all agree: Prop 8 has nothing to do with education. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Fiction: Churches could lose their tax-exemption status.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Fact: The court decision regarding marriage specifically says “no religion will be required to change its religious policies or practices with regard to same-sex couples, and no religious officiant will be required to solemnize a marriage in contravention of his or her religious beliefs.”<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Fiction: A Massachusetts case about a parent’s objection to the school curriculum will happen here.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Fact: California gives parents an absolute right to remove their kids and opt-out of teaching on health and family instruction they don’t agree with. The opponents know that California law already covers this and Prop 8 won’t affect it, so they bring up an irrelevant case in Massachusetts. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Fiction: Four Activist Judges in San Francisco…<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Fact: Prop 8 is about eliminating a fundamental right. Judges didn’t grant the right, the constitution guarantees the right. Proponents of Prop 8 use an outdated and stale argument that judges aren’t supposed to protect rights and freedoms. Prop 8 is about whether Californians are willing to amend the constitution for the sole purpose of eliminating a fundamental right for one group of citizens. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Fiction: If Prop 8 isn’t passed, people can be sued over personal beliefs.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Fact: California’s laws already prohibit discrimination against anyone based on race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. This has nothing to do with marriage.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Fiction: Pepperdine University supports the Yes on 8 campaign.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Fact: The University has publicly disassociated itself from Professor Richard Peterson of Pepperdine University, who is featured in the ad, and has asked to not be identified in the Yes on 8 advertisements. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Fiction: Unless Prop 8 passes, California parents won’t have the right to object to what their children are taught in school.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Fact: California law clearly gives parents and guardians broad authority to remove their children from any health instruction if it conflicts with their religious beliefs or moral convictions.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

Niederauer had made critical inroads into improving Catholic-Mormon relations while he was Bishop of Salt Lake City for 11 years. And now he asked them for help on Prop. 8, the ballot measure that sought to ban same-sex marriages in California. The June letter from Niederauer drew in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and proved to be a critical move in building a multi-religious coalition - the backbone of the fundraising, organizing and voting support for the successful ballot measure. By bringing together Mormons and Catholics, Niederauer would align the two most powerful religious institutions in the Prop. 8 battle.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am not against Christianity, Islam, Judaism, or any faith- what I am against is when people believe they try to impose those faiths on other people. This is America, and I am free to believe that I drink the body and blood of Christ, or need to Pray to Mecca, or should remain Kosher, or Marry a same sex partner without some other jackasses trying to make laws preventing me from doing so. <br /><br />And as far as Obama- yes he is personally against gay marriage, but did vote against a Federal Marriage Amendment and opposed the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996.<br />He also supported civil unions between gay and lesbian couples (Which, IMO, needs to go a step further) and stated that marriage between same-sex couples should be legitimized on the state level. I don&#039;t exactly agree with his standpoint on this, but it is leaps and bounds better than the McCain-Palin stance I saw, which supported a federal ban on gay marriage.

				Every state has laws that allow the break-up of families through divorce, which almost every religion condemns as a sin.<br /><br />Where’s the outrage over the violation of this religious principle? Where are the protests, where are the referendums to outlaw divorce? <br /><br />What I think is a disgrace is for religious institutions to interfere with the legislative process while paying no taxes.<br /><br />There&#039;s supposed to be a separation of church and state for a reason. Criticism is made of people picking and choosing which tenents of their faith they wish to follow. When Religious institutions do so as well they deserve equal criticism. <br /><br />

Not because it wasn&#039;t difficult for you - if you say it was, I&#039;ll take your word for it -&nbsp; but because you were not oppressed or denied your civil rights <strong>by the government</strong>. This is why Prop 8 is ultimately unconstitutional in my opinion. No one can make you like gay people or attend a gay wedding. No one will be able to force a church to hold a gay wedding any more than I can compel a rabbi to give non-Jewish me a Jewish wedding. It&#039;s for the couple themselves to choose to get married and not other people to tell the government whether or not someone else can get married.<br /><br />My parents grew up in Arkansas and Houston, TX and both had first-hand experience (as white people) with the Jim Crow laws which were not fully overturned until 1965. BTW, if you disagree what I&#039;m writing, I would appreciate if you could do it without trying to invalidate my personal experiences.

The issue is that &quot;Marriage&quot; has a legal government definition, which carries across multiple faiths. The whole idea of Gay marriage means there is another belief system that believes marriage is a certain way. Just like Jewish weddings are not the same as Christian ones, are not the same as Muslim ones, etc. Having a Jewish wedding does not invalidate a Christian wedding in any way shape or form. Having your own way of marriage does not &quot;impose values&quot; on someone having another way of marriage.<br />I would be ok with it if civil unions were the definition across the board from the beginning, but unfortunately, the government decided to get in the marriage game, and the rights should be afforded to everyone willing to do so.&nbsp;

This can keep them separate, but never equal.<br />So you are saying it is OK to have a place that doesn&#039;t allow Christians in because people should not be forced to associate with them?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t tell people &nbsp;what and how to speak. My point &nbsp;was in the intial post, that it seems &nbsp;that whenever Christian &nbsp;groups &nbsp;assert their &nbsp;values using the same access available &nbsp;to all by voting they are attacked. On the other hand Islamic &nbsp;extremeists, who routinely &nbsp;behead and persecute &nbsp;Gay, Lesbian, Non-Muslims and women, get &nbsp;no mention? &nbsp;I just find these protests &nbsp;targeting what I see as &nbsp;a &#039;soft&#039; target. <br /><br />I was explaining to you why many black folk, like any other folk, voted this &nbsp;way cause they don&#039;t see it as &nbsp;a Civil Right issue, many finding the analogy wrong, and in some cases &nbsp;offensive. <br /><br />Civil Unions are not separate , but, equal, it&#039;s the same access straight couples have to &nbsp;civil unions. I have no horse in this race. Personally, it&#039;s no skin off &nbsp;my nose if George Takei gets &nbsp;married &nbsp;to &nbsp;a guy. I just &nbsp;don&#039;t like &nbsp;the bullying &nbsp;and &nbsp;I&#039;m not alone.

				How come whenever marriage is discussed it is automatically centered around religion?&nbsp; Not every hetero couple gets married in the church, and their marriage is still considered valid by the government.&nbsp; Are those who get married in City Hall considered less valid by anyone?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; So this whole argument about it supposedly being against God&#039;s law for homosexuals to marry is really a moot point.&nbsp; The word marriage is not just reserved for those who are religious.&nbsp; The government is involved.&nbsp; I see it as a form of discrimination against a minority group.&nbsp; And just because there are apparently a minute majority who believe discrimination is right, it does not make it the right thing to do.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure there were a majority who thought segregation and the Jim Crow laws were all well and good, but it did not make them right either.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is the sanctioning of discrimination of an entire group of people that really goes against American values.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s despicable.<br />

				When I hear opponents of gay marriage and civil rights, in general, talk about how &quot;violent&quot; and &quot;abusive&quot; the protesters are, it upsets me, considering how many LGBT folks have been murdered, brutally beaten, and harassed. &nbsp;Even today there was an article in the paper about a transgender woman who was allegedly beaten while in custody and was recently found murdered, although there is no evidence that the murder is related to her civil lawsuit or involved the police.<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/18/us/18memphis.html?_r=1&amp;ref=us<br /><br />There are many more stories like this and by doing actual research for my senior thesis on the Christian Right, I found that the dehumanizing of the LGBT made it easier to target them for physical violence, sometimes leading to maiming or murder, and general harassment. I would like to read the evidence that the same is happening to Christians in America, on the same scale. &nbsp;There is no comparison and I find it insulting, as a human and friend of many LGBT folks, that anyone would try to compare the two. <br /><br />Another interesting aspect about the Christian Right movement is that beginning in the early 80&#039;s, the Christian Right reached out to the Mormons, who many of their leaders considered a cult, conservative Jewish leaders, black clergymen, and Latino Catholic congregations to help vote against &quot;secularism&quot; in the public space and petition and lobby politicians. &nbsp;The Christian Coalition, which was founded by Pat Robertson, led this move and offered conciliatory gestures to these groups, in order to get their support (I&#039;ve watched way too much 700 Club and Jerry Falwell and I do have to say that I liked Pat&#039;s change of heart on capital punishment). &nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway, below are two articles regarding the history of the Right. &nbsp;I can&#039;t speak to their accuracy, although if you want to know more, I have a whole paper dedicated to this subject, or you can call one of my three uncles who are ministers at conservatives evangelical churches in the Midwest and ask them. <br /><br />http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_/ai_13815473<br /><br />http://books.google.com/books?id=rUaU6NaOhEIC&amp;dq=%22christian+right%22+mormons+1980&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=pRTx0tuW7t&amp;source=in&amp;sig=TFBwvt_iMRB2UpLmR_i918SnsuQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=11&amp;ct=result#PPA97,M1<br />

				All this because the government got involved in something that it shouldn&#039;t have in the first place.&#160; Marriage, for people of any sexual orientation, should be between them and their religious institution, or whatever institution they hold sacred.&#160; The government shouldn&#039;t be involved either way.&nbsp; The government gave &quot;rights&quot; and entitlements to straight couples that weren&#039;t theirs to give.&nbsp; Now, we&#039;re stuck between a rock and a hard place because everyone else wants those entitlements.&nbsp; And who could blame them?<br /><br />My take is that marriage is private.&nbsp; It should be between you and your religious instution.&nbsp; Or you and your partner.&nbsp; If you consider yourselves married, fine.&nbsp; The government should only recognize civil unions for people, gay or straight.&nbsp; And the only reason they should do so is because they wrongfully got involved in the first place.

				The problem also comes in with the fact that marriage is really a state level issue and each state has different rules.&nbsp; Unfortunately, DOMA further complicates things and the rules differ so much for the &quot;not-marriages&quot; folks propose for us, that it&#039;s hard to know what you are getting.

I think the elimination of calling anything &#039;marriage&#039; and being sanctioned&nbsp; by the state is&nbsp; a solution. After all, unless&nbsp; it&#039;s done in some house of&nbsp; worship, it is &#039;Civil&#039; by being in a&nbsp; court. <br /><br />Elton John and David Furnish may have had a ceremony to solidify their commitment, but John recently let the world know, “We&#039;re not married. Let&#039;s get that right. We have a civil partnership.” <br /><br />John distanced himself from the protests that are taking place in cities across the United States. “What is wrong with Proposition 8 is that they went for marriage,” he said. <br /><br />John and Furnish came to the U.S. for the annual benefit for the Elton John AIDS Foundation. <br /><br />“I don&#039;t want to be married. I&#039;m very happy with a civil partnership. If gay people want to get married, or get together, they should have a civil partnership,” John advised. <br /><br />“The word &#039;marriage,&#039; I think, puts a lot of people off. You get the same equal rights that we do when we have a civil partnership. Heterosexual people get married. We can have civil partnerships,” John added. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The problem is in the UK, civil partnerships are identical to marriage and are nationwide, this is not proposed in the US and is not likely to happen.

I know it seems off topic, but I believe that if one doesn&#039;t accept the civil rights argument, with respect to same sex marriage, than the democratic institutions are in place to change with societal mores. Apparently, in California, the population at large was unwilling to make that leap. You can assume any number of motivation for the votes, but every time people vote it is a reflection of their values.

Second, where is there empirical evidence that people voted based on lies. Obviously, I wasn&#039;t in California, so i have no way of knowing what the opponents were putting out there. But more importantly, how do you know that is why people voted the way they did? That logic doesn&#039;t flow: &quot;People Lied&quot; + &quot;People Voted Yes on Prop 8&quot; does not equal &quot;People Voted Yes on Prop 8 because of lies.&quot;

Brits don’t have to quibble about what to call it because by law and more importantly, in practice, same-sex couples joined in civil unions have the same rights and privileges as opposite-sex couples joined in marriage and are treated the same.<br /><br />For the most part there were little dissent and no end-runs to get around the law – civil unions are accepted -- that’s why there’s no dispute in the UK on what to call them.<br />
