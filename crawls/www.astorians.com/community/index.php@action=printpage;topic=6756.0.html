				I am so sad to say that as more and more people move into Astoria, management companies and supers are becoming greedier and more conniving. From my experience, the mom-and-pop landlords are a blessing... it&#039;s the institutions that I&#039;ve been burned by, specifically....<br /><br />I am a former resident of <strong>21-38 31st STREET in ASTORIA </strong> and am being forced to take the management company to court to get my security deposit back. I lived there for three years, paid on time, notified of my departure and left the apartment in great condition. Unfortunately, I was naive enough to think that I would get my security back so I paid the last month&#039;s rent. That was TWO YEARS ago and still not able to get it back.<br /><br />Since then we called, sent letters and even visited the management office just to be ignored (literally) an lied to. Also posted a complaint to the Better Business Bureau (who was not able to reach them either). Now, I am taking them to small claims court.<br /><br />Furthermore, the super, who <strong>illegally required key money </strong> (another month&#039;s rent on top of the 1st and security), is refusing to sign a letter indicating that we left the apartment in good condition because she &quot;doesn&#039;t get involved in these type of things&quot;. <br /><br /><strong>PLEASE CONTACT ME IF YOU&#039;VE LIVED AT THIS BUILDING (21-38 31s street in Astoria) or the building next door, which engages in the same illegal practices. <br /><br />The more of us there are, the less they can lie.</strong>

				Unfortunately not. I know now it was not wise, but we had not had any problems with them up until this point.<br /><br />When my husband recently went to speak to the super, she at first tried to say that they had to use the deposit because there were holes in the wall from wall hangings (pins and nails), but when he reminded her that those were allowed and considered normal wear for an apartment, she then said that &quot;people don&#039;t actually expect to get their security back... you know that&quot;, which demonstrates the intent and attitude.<br /><br />Beyond that, the process has been the most maddening. <br /><br />- Call the management office, they ask your name and then say the person in charge is not there<br />- Leave a message, no response<br />- Call back, ask your name, the person is not there<br />- Get a friend to call, the person in charge gets on the phone, when i address the problem he says he&#039;s not in charge<br />- My husband takes the day off to go to their Great Neck offices, waits 3 HOURS for the guy in charge to come to the office, sees a man leave the office from the back and then asks the receptionist about when the guy will come just for her to admit that he was here all along and just left<br /><br />It goes on and on and avoids giving a reason for keeping it. Furthermore, the management company owners also own a law practice next door, which concerns me since they either might know folks within the court system or simply outmaneuver us in court.... either way, I am still going because their practices are a disgrace to our community.

				I&#039;m glad that you are at least trying to stand up to them. If more people would do that, I think it wouldn&#039;t be such a huge problem as it is.

				What a horrible practice.&nbsp; I&#039;m also glad you are standing up them.&nbsp; Most people probably don&#039;t and that&#039;s what they are counting on.&nbsp; Hopefully, you&#039;ll be able to find others who&#039;ve had the same experience with them.&nbsp; Getting the word out is important.

				ah, the internet, the great equalizer...<br /><br />Never, ever pay final month rent. No landlord will ever want to give you a security deposit refund.<br /><br />&#039;Key money&#039; ? never heard of that one before. If you have a check proving you paid him, include him in your claim. He doesn&#039;t want to be involved? T.S. Make him involved.

				Thank you to all for the support!<br /><br />So you know &#039;key money&#039; is what supers may require as their version of a realtor fee, which is illegal.<br /><br />In most cases, they say something like... &quot;pay first month rent, one month security and one month to the super that you otherwise would have paid a realtor&quot;<br /><br />I am actually planning on posting a flyer with the same info at Starbucks on Ditmars to see if anybody else has been swindled. <br /><br />I agree that the reason they do this is because they get away with it. The same reason that &quot;gentleman&quot; at the management agency is so hard to reach and does not provide answers. <br /><br />They know we are busy, working individuals and don&#039;t have time to chase these things along... well that is no reason to swindle hard-working folks out of their money.<br /><br />Anything you can do to help is greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Please reply if you know anybody living in that building<br />Please reply if you&#039;ve had these folks take &quot;key money&quot; from you<br />Please forward this along to your Astoria friends to spread the word<br /><br />The silver lining is that we all may get our money back.<br /><br />THANK YOU!

				I&#039;m having trouble getting my security deposit back from my landlord now as well.&nbsp; I wish I had thought of asking him that the security deposit be my last month&#039;s rent earlier.&nbsp; Now he is trying to screw us out of our money.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hopefully this won&#039;t make it all the way to small claims court, but my husband and I are ready if it does.

				Its terrible this is happening to you but security money cant be used for last months rent .I would never allow any of my tenants to do so . If I did and there were repairs to be made , then what ?&nbsp; &nbsp; I know you said you left your apt in great shape , but just in&nbsp; general ,&nbsp; the security is for repairs .&nbsp; NYS rent guidelines also says the same thing .&nbsp; I have it written in all my leases cuz tenants have tried to do it in the past and then when something had to be fixed , they were gone .&nbsp; &nbsp;If someone tries that now , they would be taken to court for non payment and their credit would be tarnished.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Im not going againt you , cuz I think its terrible what was done , but the security money doesn&#039;t have to be given on spot either&nbsp; , as far as NYS says . There has to be a reasonable time period,&nbsp; where in some states&nbsp; rules say 30 days .NYS has this period between 30-60 days . The person checking the apt shoudve gave you something to sign saying an inspection was done and this this and that was found . Any problems should be written on the spot .&nbsp; The landlord then has a time period to get the costs for those repairs .&nbsp; Pin holes wouldn&#039;t cost to the amount of the deposit anyway .&nbsp; &nbsp;So that&#039;s BS on their part .&nbsp; &nbsp; Ive always given all my tenants back their deposit , and even small repairs were taken care of by me .&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t mean in the future I would allow anyone to use a security for rent .&nbsp; This is a business and each landlord has to treat it as that.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PS. next time take pics&nbsp; and date stamp them.
