				Hi there! I am new to the online community and yet to arrive to the real-world one. I am looking for a studio or 1-bedroom apartment, preferably starting mid-April, in Astoria. A 3+ month sublet with the option of taking over a lease would also work. <br /><br />If you are renting, subleasing, or know someone who is, I work for a translation firm, looking to live in a community-oriented part of NY which Astoria seems to be. Good credit, non-smoker, allergic to furry animals (as much as I like them...) so no pets, generally friendly, clean, no huge parties/drinking/etc. I love to cook so a functional kitchen is important and it should be generally clean and not too far from the subway, but I&#039;m a walker, so that&#039;s not vital.<br /><br />The broker discussion was really useful, thanks to everyone for their input. I&#039;m coming last week of March to look for places and a couple of the brokers mentioned sounded like good people to work with. While I&#039;m here, any good community radio stations in the area? How about a farmers market?<br /><br />I&#039;ll be grateful for any leads,<br /><br />Thanks for reading!
