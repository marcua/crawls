				I just moved to Astoria a few months ago and now that I&#039;m more settled I&#039;m trying to do some exploring in my new neighborhood. My two most frequented Indian restaurants are Panna II in the East Village&nbsp; and Royal Kabab &amp; Curry on the Upper West Side. Where should I go seeking delicious Indian food in Astoria. I live off of the Ditmars stop, but I&#039;ll go anywhere for good Indian.

				Seva is definitely your best bet.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there are no Indian restaurants at all around Ditmars, although you can buy spices, herbs and some prepared foods at the little Bangladeshi grocery on Ditmars across from Dunkin Donuts (between 32nd and 33rd Sts.).&nbsp; Seva does deliver to the Ditmars area, although you should confirm before ordering that they deliver to your block, as it&#039;s on the edge of their delivery zone.<br /><br />Seva Indian Cuisine<br />www.sevaindianrestaurant.com (website&#039;s not working at the moment)<br /><br />3007 34th St<br />Astoria, NY 11103<br />(718) 626-4440

				Welcome to Astoria, Manic.&nbsp; I just had another incredible meal at Seva and would highly recommend that you try it out.&nbsp; <br /><br />There&#039;s always Roti Boti for authentic Bangladeshi cuisine.&nbsp; It&#039;s on 21st Street and Astoria Boulevard, close to the southeast corner.&nbsp; It&#039;s a popular hangout for South Asian cab drivers.&nbsp; <br /><br />Roti Boti<br />2709 21st St<br />Astoria, NY 11102<br />(718) 278-7888<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Definitely worth the trip to Jackson Heights.&nbsp; If you have a car, it&#039;s a very quick drive (mapquest--37th Ave &amp; 74th Street) and as this area is known as &quot;Little India&quot;, you will find many, many options.&nbsp; Or, as other poster said, take the R or V train uptown to the Roosevelt Ave stop (E F and 7 trains also go to that stop, if you&#039;re coming from somewhere else).&nbsp; My new favorite is Mehfil (37th Ave and 75th Street, across from Met supermarket).&nbsp; They (along with many of the area places) have a 7 day a week lunch buffet, very inexpensive (most under $10), if you&#039;d like a little bit of everything.

				There&#039;s 3 Bangladeshi families in my apartment building and on most nights the halls get filled with that amazing aroma of curry spices.&nbsp; My GOD!&nbsp; I love the smell but a part of me dies inside because it makes me miss home cooking so much.<br /><br />On the topic of good South Asian food in Astoria...<br /><br />Seva<br />Roti Boti<br />Ghandi (Gandhi?)<br /><br />36th Avenue between 29th and 30th Streets has a decent restaurant and a couple of sweets stores.<br /><br />Go to Jackson Heights 74th Street for more options.&nbsp; And if you work in the city, 6th Street between 1st and 2nd Avenues has probably over 20 Bangladeshi restaurants.

				<br />I may get in trouble for suggesting this, but I would say there are no good Indian restaurants in Astoria.&nbsp; &nbsp;As noted previously in this thread there are quite a few Bengali places, but I don&#039;t know that there are any proper &quot;Desi,&quot; joints, and even in the Bengali places, I rarely see any that are packed with people of any sort of South Asian patrons which would indicate to me that those, &quot;in the know.&quot; would rather eat elsewhere.&nbsp; &nbsp;Personally I think you&#039;re better off taking the train to Murray Hill or the around 58th St between 3rd and 2nd Ave than even bothering with the stuff around here.&nbsp; &nbsp;Astoria is a great place to live, and it may be only a short car ride away from some of the largest Asian communities in America, but whatever reason none of those culinary traditions seem to travel to this part of Queens.

				Seva is an average at best Indian restaurant (by NYC standards, I agree its about as good as you can do in Astoria).... Royal Kabab and Curry is one of the worst in the UWS (please tell me you&#039;ve tried Tandoori North), and it is at least as good as Seva

				I agree that Seva is totally average. I moved here from Woodside/ Jackson Heights though so my standards are pretty high. I&#039;d recommend going straight to Jackson Heights.

				I don&#039;t get it. I&#039;ve tried Seva three times and was disappointed every time. I have never ordered one thing there that was great, it was passable and ok, but not great. I go often for Indian and grew up eating Indian home cooking... I&#039;m so confused as to why everyone says Seva is so good. Their garlic nan didn&#039;t even have garlic in or on it, just some garlic powder sprinkled on top. Their kheer was bland and had no flavor. Their tikka masala was sweet and tasted like tomato paste and not much else. Just my opinion I guess but my husband shared it as well. He said his vindaloo was bland. How do you make bland vindaloo? Also, they don&#039;t serve goat. Maybe I&#039;ve caught them on an off three nights?

				Different people have different tastes.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think anyone&#039;s telling you to like Seva or that you shouldn&#039;t go to Jackson Heights, but the original poster asked for Indian recommendations in Astoria.&nbsp; And a lot of us like Seva.

				There is no great Indian in Astoria.<br /><br />Seva is the best in the neighborhood, but it&#039;s by no means spectacular. It&#039;s slightly better than average, so relative to other subpar places in the area (Gandhi), it seems great.<br /><br />But it&#039;s not.<br /><br />
