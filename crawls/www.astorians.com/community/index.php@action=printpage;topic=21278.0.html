				anybody that has plans to go to Donovan&#039;s Pub in Woodside, New York (58th Street &amp; Roosevelt Avenue) you will be in for a surprise -- the Board of Health has shut them down for over 66 violations -- that is an awful lot&nbsp; :sad: If you want to read the whole article go onto queens crap and once in queens crap go on the right side and click on sunnyside post and you can read everything.&nbsp; I think they were closed down on July 1st -- well everyone have a nice July 4th weekend and be safe

				Thank you angela for the heads up. I hadn&#039;t checked their inspection results for quite a while and was surprised to see all the violation points they&#039;d racked up recently. My boyfriend and I were pretty much regulars there- maybe once or twice a month. I guess we were just lucky we didn&#039;t getting sick!<br />I even complimented the waitress on how much tastier the burgers have been lately! :laugh: :embarrassed: <br /><br /><br />He loves his Guinness, so we&#039;ll probably end up going to PJ Horgan&#039;s from now on.

				On radio they just had report on it. Said it was second straight violation , and that a 32 (Or some number like that) is bad. They had in the 60&#039;s last two inspections. :shocked:

				I find that the grades restaurants receive from one inspection to the next vary widely.&nbsp; Although the previous score was also terrible at 67 the two previous scores in the second half of 2010 were 6 and 7 points which are not only A grades but high A&#039;s.&nbsp; I have seen many restaurants grades change from C&#039;s to A&#039;s on a matter of weeks and vica versa.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if some graders are harder or easier than others or that the difference between a good score and a bad score is really just a few infractions.

				Funny how this is in the news now. My wife and I drove by there around a week ago.&nbsp; She talked about how her family used to go there when she was young and I commented we should eat there before they close down!&nbsp; :grin:

				This one surprised me. <br /><br /><br />Their burger was considered by some to be the best in the whole city. A friend worked there as a waitress for years and never said anything that suggested slipshod sanitation, food safety, etc. And they generally seemed to run a tight ship.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ll be curious to see whether they turn this around.<br /><br /><br />Also, I miss the burger already.

				to be quite frank about this whole thing Donovan&#039;s was warned a month prior to the department of health to clean up his violations but apparently he could not have been bothered as usual -- if you look up sunnyside post you will read everything that has gone down about Donovan&#039;s -- also it was on channel 5 (fox) news the other day around 7:30 am and in the paper -- so it must have been pretty bad and disgusting -- no wonder why the lights were never turned up (lol)

				Haven&#039;t been to Donovan&#039;s in a while, but I never really saw what all the hoopla was about their burgers. They were just kind of meh. Decent in a pinch, but there are much better burgers out there to be had.
