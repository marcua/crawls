								<div class="inner" id="msg_178409">Rage 1997<br /><br />&quot;Juh have any tokens left?&quot;<br /><br />His hair was half black and half blond. His clothes were tight and uncommon. They were all black. His body was unusually small and waif like. He looked like a strange little kid. I found an extra token in my pocket and gave it to him.<br /><br />He smiled up at me and said, &quot;Thanks man. Not just anyone would do a nice thing like that, you know.&quot;<br /><br />His voice sounded sort of feminine and agreeable. We both got on the subway together and he sat right up next to me. He didn&#039;t have to, there were plenty of options. It was a bold move and I was impressed.<br /><br />Looking more closely at him, I noticed his hands were thin, delicate. On his fingers were a few odd hand-wrought rings of different metals. His face was cute and mischievous. He smiled and continued to talk. The brightest thing in his dark composition was his eyes. They were a strange sort of pale blue that were almost Manson-like. This time when he smiled, I saw them for the first time. His two canines were filed, a la Vampire. I&#039;m sure it was cosmetic but the impression was startling.<br /><br />Because he sat so close to me, we were able to talk as if we knew each other and not as strangers that had just met. He told me his name was Rage. I guessed that it was a name made up or taken from somewhere else. I told him I lived with my parents on East 2nd and 1st Avenue. My Parents had been threatening to move out of the city for the longest time.<br /><br />He said he lived between B and C on 4th Street. He seemed pleased that we lived so close to each other. We got off at the same stop and both had a short walk into the East Village.<br /><br />I told him my name was Daniel and where I was going to school and all the usual stuff. My appearance is not unattractive. I consider myself young, but ordinary. He seemed interested in me, but I thought why? I didn&#039;t like to stick out too much. If anything, he was the interesting one.<br /><br />Rage said he was an artist and worked in mixed media. I had no idea what that was. When we reached the street where we would have split our journey, he stopped. He looked disappointed that our meeting was over.<br /><br />He hesitated and then said, &quot;Juh wanna come over? I don&#039;t live far and I`d kinda like to hang out with you some more.&quot;<br /><br />I looked towards my destination and thought about all the things that I was supposed to do.<br /><br />Then I looked at the strange person I had just met and I said, &quot;Ok.&quot;<br /><br />We continued walking past 1st avenue down further East and then up to 4th. Rage&#039;s place was a five floor walk-up. It seemed like the whole East Village had been slated for renovation. Buildings like his were in limbo. They were intentionally neglected to cause tenants to flee. The building like Rage&#039;s was often called a squat. The hallways were in ruins and some abandon apartments were even missing their doors exposing some frozen chaos or past disaster inside.<br /><br />He keyed his door and let us both in. Once inside, His place was safe, comfortable and isolated from the rest of the world. He switched on a string of Christmas lights. There was another string of lights arranged in a glass bowl on sort of a coffee table. We sat together on a day bed that was done up like a couch. His whole apartment was individual, like him. He started some friendly chatter.<br /><br />&quot;My Aunt let me have this place when she went to Los Angeles. She went with this black guy. I didn&#039;t much like him so I&#039;m glad they&#039;re gone. I mean like there&#039;s no rent and sometimes a war might break out in the hall down stairs, but nothing much happens up here.&quot;<br /><br />Rage lit up a joint and asked me, &quot;So, um, what were you doing over by the Noguchi Cube last Saturday?&quot;<br /><br />I was surprised. He smiled, and blew pot smoke at me.<br /><br />I responded suspiciously. &quot;s___, I don&#039;t even know you and already you&#039;re spying on me.&quot;<br /><br />How could anyone as weird looking as him spy on anyone without them seeing him?<br /><br />I gave an appraising look. &quot;If you must know, I was handing out flyers.&quot;<br /><br />He laughed out loud more like a young boy than a girl. It was plain to me that Rage was a complicated concoction of both sexes. He moved closer and now he had his hand on my leg. I don&#039;t know, I guess it was because of my friendly nature that he would assume that I was easy and, well, the truth is, I am. It&#039;s that or have a wank more than once a day. I&#039;m all for helping things along.<br /><br />He was sort of cute and he was, ..um, you know,.. exotic, fragile and frail. He made me feel like he was someone that needed care and protection. It was this impression that made me feel comfortable around him. I did not discourage any of his advances and behaved as if it was agreeable to me.<br /><br />He lifted one leg up and popped off his small black and white low top then the other one. With unexpected familiarity, he spread out, half on me and half off. He appeared completely content and it became obvious that he was offering himself to me as a gift.<br /><br />con&#039;t upon request</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_178422">I held on to him and rubbed his torso. He was so skinny, much skinnier than me. When I did this he sprawled and curled like a cat prompting me to continue. He climbed up on me and we kissed. The chemistry was intoxicating. He had a natural body scent that had the allure of sweet musk.<br /><br />I appeared to me as if he some kind of magical creature, a strange night creature that can cast spells and can fly on wings. His tongue was long, firm and sweet. He was squeezing me through my pants and stroking me between my legs. His vampire smile cast us together in a dusty old book full of mystical stories. I have become Gothic and he was a dark treasure.<br /><br />I was thinking to myself, &quot;Have I totally lost it?&quot;<br /><br />But I just didn&#039;t care. Some adventures in life you just have to let happen. I pulled his thin dark shirt off over his head revealing a few raw hide necklaces with charms and talismans hanging round his neck. His skin was featureless and pale white. He totally lacked the male definition that one is use to seeing even on some young boys. When I began to pull off his pants, he aided me by lifting his legs up in the air in a submissive and erotic display.<br /><br />Completely naked, we kissed again. Both his legs and arms clung to me in an exotic embrace. Never having been in love before, I had nothing to gage what love is supposed to be like but I was definitely under a magic spell. My hand traced his hairless under arm, his smooth chest, warm belly down to his penis and scrotum. It was so small and delicate and even though it was erect and standing, it was barely three inches. It was exactly what you might find on an uncircumcised nine or ten year old boy. His scrotum was the only skin that appeared darker from the rest of him and it contained two robin&#039;s egg size balls. <br />With the exception of his mottled head of hair, the rest of his body was completely and absolutely without body hair or any masculine definition.<br /><br />He began to pull off my clothes; I just lay there and watched him in wonder. He tugged off my pants and when I was naked he devoted himself to my cluck. Periodically he would climb back up on me and kiss. While we kissed, he would reach behind himself and rub my stiff cluck on his butt hole. My interested mounted and I turned him around. His ass was soft and round. I spread it until I could see his little hole and scrotum below. To my surprise, his scent was earthy and sweet. It was something I never thought I&#039;d ever do but in Rage, it eventually became something I would never want to live without.<br /><br />He got up and turned so he could face me and slowly sat down on my cluck. We kissed some more and my cluck gradually went up his ass. Next to him, my cluck was so big and he was so small I could hardly believe I was up inside of him.<br /><br />He looked into my eyes and said, &quot;Come on, I want you to f___ me. You won&#039;t hurt me.&quot;<br /><br />I rolled him so that I was over him and started the most wonderful f___ of my life. He wrapped his arms around me. All the motion between us was smooth, luxurious and in ever increasing in intensity.<br /><br />He clung to me and whispered into my ear, &quot;You can do anything you want to me.&quot;<br /><br />His voice sent chills throughout my body. &quot;Make me love you.&quot;<br /><br />We fucked for much longer than I ever had with anyone. Looking into each other&#039;s eyes and kissing, we and went on and on. We fucked until we finally came in blindingly beautiful liquid synchronicity.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />II<br /><br />When I woke up it was almost dark outside. The Christmas lights gave the room a cozy glow. Still naked, Rage was over me on his hands and knees.<br /><br />&quot;I could go get you some McDonalds but I don&#039;t have any money. If you do, I&#039;ll could go get em.&quot;<br /><br />I opened my eyes and pieced together all the recent events. &quot;No, I&#039;m ok.&quot;<br /><br />I sat up and looked at him. &quot;What was your name again? I didn&#039;t forget you, just that strange name of yours.&quot;<br /><br />He answered, &quot;Rage.&quot;<br /><br />His little penis was still up at eleven thirty.<br /><br />&quot;Rage, I have to ask you a question. Just how old are you?&quot;<br /><br />He put on a coy look that I was sure he had used before when asked this question. <br />&quot;I&#039;m nineteen.&quot;<br /><br />I was puzzled. &quot;No way, you`re lying!&quot;<br /><br />He flashed me a look of anger that quickly dissolved.<br /><br />He turned and rummaged around in a rucksack and handed me a Canadian passport. &quot;See.&quot;<br /><br />The picture was him but his hair was short and blonde. I gave him a puzzled look.<br />He sighed and sat back to tell the same old story he had to tell everyone that asked or everyone that ever got into his pants.<br /><br />&quot;No, I&#039;m not lying, I am nineteen. I never had puberty. It didn&#039;t happen when I was twelve and it didn&#039;t happen when I was fourteen so they took me to all kinds of doctors and they didn&#039;t have any answers and they did it again when I was sixteen. One doctor said that it was a rare endr...endrichol..logical....s___, a problem with my glands! The doctor said I will never go through puberty, so that&#039;s how it is.&quot;<br /><br />He suddenly crossed his arms defensively and made a disappointing frown. &quot;So now you think I am a total freak and you never want to see me again and now, because I like you, I`ll probably have to kill myself.&quot;<br /><br />He curled up and started crying. I never saw anything so pitiful. Not knowing what to do with him, I pulled him over so he could rest his head on my chest. Again this feeling came over me where I wanted to protect him from the rest of the world.<br /><br />Still crying, he looked up at me. &quot;You can go if you want. Go the f___ away and never see me again, I don&#039;t care.&quot;<br /><br />He buried his face in my breast and continued to sob. It was at that very moment that I knew that this encounter was going to change my life forever.<br /><br />I tried to explain myself, &quot;Just because you are a weird freak doesn&#039;t mean that I don&#039;t like you. So far, I have never had such an incredible experience with anyone like this in my life. Rage, you done something to me. I think you are magical or something.&quot;<br /><br />He stopped crying and listened for awhile.<br /><br />Then looking out the window at the great grey city, he quietly said almost to himself, &quot;I am magical, aren&#039;t I?&quot;<br /><br />There was a long pause between us.<br /><br />Then I asked him, &quot;Have long have you been spying on me anyway?&quot;<br /><br />He gave me his mischievous vampiric smile again. &quot;Oh, much longer then you would believe. I don&#039;t just see people out and around, I sneak around, sometimes at night. You never know, I might have been even looking in your window when you were jerking off and you would have never known.&quot;<br /><br />He laughed and then his humor faded into seriousness. &quot;Daniel, please stay with me. I`m living here all by myself and I get so fricking miserable and lonely&quot;<br /><br />I puzzled about it for a moment, then picked up my cell.<br /><br />&quot;Hi Mom, I&#039;m staying at the Ryder&#039;s and I promise I&#039;ll go to practice first thing tomorrow. Ok, I will, I love you, see you after school.&quot;<br /><br />I turned and looked at Rage. &quot;How&#039;s that?&quot;<br /><br />He hugged me and I pulled the blanket over us. We played together in every possible way until it began to get light.<br /><br />con&#039;t upon request<br /><br />&nbsp;</div>
