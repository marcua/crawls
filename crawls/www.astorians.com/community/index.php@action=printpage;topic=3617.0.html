				Some people are going to be offended by this rant, and will probably perceive me as a snotty ex-Manhattanite who is part of some kind of problematic gentrification that is ruining your otherwise &quot;authentic&quot; outer borough experience, but...<br /><br />Why does there have to be so much damn trash around here?&nbsp; I took a long walk today, from 23rd and Ditmars all the way into the upper 40&#39;s.&nbsp; And there&#39;s just trash everywhere, on the street, the sidewalk, on peoples&#39; lawns.&nbsp; In Manhattan, they have wastebaskets on EVERY street corner.&nbsp; When I walk to the subway in the morning eating my banana, I have to carry the banana peel all the way to 31st st. before I have the chance to throw it out, unless it happens to be trash collection day and I can throw it on top of someone else&#39;s heap of stinking garbage.&nbsp; I&#39;m just a little annoyed that there ALWAYS seems to be broken glass in the middle of the street.&nbsp; When there&#39;s a breeze, these little trash whirlwinds of crap eddy around and frankly, it&#39;s really not very nice.&nbsp; Just get some damn trash cans out there, and I think that would solve half the problem- I mean, do people really need to be chucking Big Gulp cups and snapple bottles on the street?&nbsp; I think if there were proper trash receptacles, this wouldn&#39;t be such a problem -- people wouldn&#39;t be shlepping their trash all over Astoria looking for a trashcan, only to give up after five blocks and dump it in the street.&nbsp; I understand that it&#39;s a residential neighborhood, and most people probably dispose of their trash in their homes and then &quot;take out the trash&quot; or whatever.&nbsp; But obviously, there are people who are buying things in the commercial part of Astoria and discarding the packaging in the residential part.&nbsp; Or something.<br /><br />There are many, many reasons why I prefer living here to Manhattan.&nbsp; But the trash situation can be improved upon.&nbsp; Believe me, I don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass that there&#39;s no Barnes and Noble here.&nbsp; But the trash thing is a bit ridiculous.<br /><br />ok, rant over.<br />bennyt

				I think we&#39;ve all complained about this here. The problem is not so much a lack of trash recepticles as it is a lack of respect for the community. I&#39;ve seen people throw their trash on the ground when there&#39;s a garbage can right in front of them. <br /><br />It would be nice though if they would replace those useless garbage cans that are already there with some ones that aren&#39;t made up more of holes than of material to contain the garbage. Who the hell thought that was a good garbage can design, and why does our neighborhood have so many of them compared to the useful garbage cans I&#39;ve seen elsewhere in the city? In some public garbage cans they actually use garbage bags! But I&#39;d be happy with the ones with tiny holes and that have a slight amount of coverage on the top (not a lid, but the top extends a little over the garbage). In ours, if you try to throw out a straw wrapper in one of those it just falls through the side. And if you throw away a napkin or empty plastic bag it&#39;ll just blow out in a gust of wind. <br /><br />We can&#39;t necessarily stop people from being ***holes, but it would be nice if the people who did care to throw away their garbage properly didn&#39;t need to worry about it just blowing away a few seconds later.

				Do you think that&#39;s why there&#39;s so much trash on the streets, though? Ten street blocks isn&#39;t that far to have to carry an empty soda bottle or something, and if you respect the area you live in you won&#39;t just throw it on the ground or in someone&#39;s lawn simply because there doesn&#39;t happen to be a trash can right in front of you. <br /><br />I&#39;m not saying there shouldn&#39;t be more trash cans -- obviously there should be because the trash cans we do have end up overflowing noticeably often, so we should get more if they&#39;re not going to empty them enough -- but take Tokyo, for example. They have drink vending machines all over the place but not nearly the number of garbage cans we have. The difference is that they bother to carry their garbage until they reach a garbage can, and also their garbage cans actually hold in the garbage, so they don&#39;t have trash all over the streets. People there don&#39;t want to be slobs.<br /><br />I have seriously seen people in Astoria and Long Island City throw their garbage on the ground with a trash can right in front of them. I have seen a lot of people on garbage-cans-aplenty Ditmars Blvd leave their Dunkin Donuts cups on the ground instead of carrying them to the corner garbage can. They just don&#39;t care. Actually I think they like throwing their crap on the ground.<br /><br />However, there is a way to request an additional public litter basket. I&#39;m not sure how likely it is you&#39;ll get one, but you can try that here: http://www.nyc.gov/html/dsny/html/contact/requests_litter.shtml

They have almost no public trash cans at all because the city government doesn&#39;t want to be responsible for picking it up. But the streets are still fairly clean. Unfortunately, lots of things that work there won&#39;t work here because you can&#39;t exactly shame people here into cleaning up after themselves.<br /><br />Because of all the trash, I actually felt a little embarrassed bringing some friends to our neighborhood a few weeks ago. They won&#39;t shut up about how great Manhattan is, so it took a little arm-twisting to get them to visit Astoria, and a lot of bragging about how great I think it is over here. And what&#39;s the first thing they see? A trash-covered sidewalk. That along with some brats running around the restaurant we chose led one friend to mutter, &quot;This would never happen in Manhattan.&quot; Made me mad.

				One reason there&#39;s more trash in these parts as opposed to other places is because in Manhattan the big buildings are required the keep the sidewalks in front of their buildings (residential or commercial) clean all the time. People still throw trash in Manhattan, it&#39;s just cleaned up by doormen and janitorial staff throughout the day.<br /><br />Around here the residential buildings don&#39;t have to do that, only businesses, and those rules aren&#39;t really enforced around here.

				I completely agree with this rant. <br /><br />We also have a problem with people throwing their trash in our front &quot;porch&quot; on Ditmars. I guess people figure if they don&#39;t throw it on the street, throwing it behind a wall in someone&#39;s front yard is ok.<br /><br />Kinda pisses me off.

				I know what you mean. My neighbors throw their trash behind my apartment because they are too lazy to walk 30 extra feet and put it behind their apartment where it&#39;s supposed to be. Once they throw their trash there, then other random people start putting their trash their too and I end up with a big pile that I have to go and clean up and re-bag it again. If I don&#39;t, then the trash guys come by and won&#39;t pick up the trash because they think it&#39;s me making that mess and that I&#39;m not following the trash rules. I even got a ticket once for improper bagging, but it wasn&#39;t my trash.<br /><br />I wish I knew how to make our neighborhood a bit more respectable in this regard.

				I was waiting for a train at 36th Avenue last week and saw a young-ish couple finishing off a Dunkin Donuts feast on the platform with a trash can not four feet away.&nbsp; They finished with their bag and tossed it onto the tracks - which of course, being at an above ground platform, winds up where?&nbsp; On the freakin&#39; street below!&nbsp; &nbsp;:x<br /><br />I thought about confronting them, but I didn&#39;t feel like getting into an argument on the subway platform.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#39;s a matter of respect, and a lot of people just don&#39;t have it.&nbsp; It&#39;s the old &quot;oh, it&#39;s somebody else&#39;s job to clean up after me&quot; mentality.&nbsp; Argh!

				http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=2294.0 (Already discussed.) <br /><br />CB 1 has the dirtiest streets in Queens. Somehow I think this is linked to the increasingly coarse bar scene on Broadway, the increasingly tawdry shopping scene on Steinway (can&#39;t anyone do anything about that Seaman&#39;s store site?), the increasingly crowded streets and trains everywhre, and the benign neglect as the infrastructure is left to rot around us (Con Ed, sewage plants, etc.)<br /><br />With the exception of a few bright spots in the entertainment or food categories (that the posters on this site are quick to find), Astoria is clearly sliding downhill, a trend that is becoming very apparent in the past year or so. <br /><br />Qualily of life concerns is a class thing and Astoria is a quality of life disaster. This never makes the papers, never is uttered by our leadership. They not only want to put it under the rug, but only seem to want to attract more of the same. Twice the population is planned. Elmhurst West.<br /><br />Indifference to this mess, well, thats one thing you cannot blame on Washington or Albany. And nothing will change as long as the real culprits perceive themselves exempt from criticism.

				I&#39;m not so sure to what extent I buy the &quot;repsect for the neighborhood&quot; argument.&nbsp; I&#39;m sure that&#39;s true on some level. But-&nbsp; I used to live on the Upper East Side, which was immaculate compared to Astoria in terms of trash.&nbsp; However, many many obnoxious people still had no qualms about letting their dogs piss and poo all over the middle of the sidewalk, creating such a disgusting mess that even the vast army of porters and doormen armed with hoses were fighting a losing battle trying to blast that nasty sludge into the street, and in addition to the actual mess, there was also that omni-present stench that made me litereally gag every time I left my apartment, and think the Apolcalypse Now-esque thought that there&#39;s nothing like the smell of dog urine in the morning.&nbsp; So are those people on the UES showing respect for the neighborhood?&nbsp; I don&#39;t know.&nbsp; But as far as trash goes, I&#39;m willing to give people the benefit of the doubt --if there&#39;s an easy and convenient way to throw garbage away, I think that at least SOME people would do so.&nbsp; I mean, you can talk about respect for the neighborhood and the &quot;coarse bar scene&quot; all you want, but the fact is, we&#39;re not even giving people a CHANCE to throw out trash, since there are no f@#!*&amp;g trash cans anywhere!

				I think multiple people probably have to request a trashcan at a location before DOS takes it seriously - they are not the best bureaucracy.&nbsp; I&#39;m still trying to get additional cans at 34th and Broadway.&nbsp; I think we need BIG cans instead of the small ones that fill up easily.&nbsp; Peter Vallone, Jr. bought us a bunch of new cans on Broadway two years back and it helped, but we need even more.

				Oh my goodness. I was just walking by Ditmars and 31st and I noticed that the holey garbage cans on that intersection have garbage bags! Do they always have that, or is that new? The ones further east on Ditmars don&#39;t have bags. <br /><br />I was walking around with an empty cup this evening and walked past three streets, each with garbage cans on all corners, and all the garbage cans were completely full. People seem to use those cans to bring out their household garbage at the end of the day.

				I&#39;m convinced that people use the private trash cans in front of my building for their personal trash, too - there are only two units in my building, and yet the cans are always full by midweek (I&#39;m talking about trash bags as well as individual items).&nbsp; Even worse, people who try to use our trash cans but miss - I&#39;ve started picking up the trash that gathers in front of the building entrance.&nbsp; There is a diner on the street level of my building, but a lot of the litter is stuff that the diner does not sell.<br /><br />My landlord/super doesn&#39;t like it that other people use our trash cans and has been thinking of locking them up.&nbsp; But to be honest, I think it would exacerbate the littering situation.

				Well, Merm, for those of us living a bit more than 5 years here you can be assured that&nbsp; Astoria has gotten worse, much worse, if only from fact the the population has increased. More people, more trash. <br /><br />Big question is, despite the fact that the city has been reporting the sorry state of Astoria streets with numbing regularity, why the politicians do not seem to share the concern of the posters on this board. Everyone of our leaders are already aware of those statistics. Everyone. The big question is why no one in a position of authority seems to believe it important enough to do something or even comment publicly. <br /><br />Do you really believe that by sending politicians pictures you will show them stuff that they have not seen or that they do not know?

A year from now, anyone want to bet that things will be better? I have a war in Iraq that will be over in a year, too. Another politician&#39;s promise.<br /><br />And again, I must stress, dirty streets are not a single issue, but merely a single red-flag to a host of linked local urban ills that seems to rise in our community with the passage of time.<br /><br />Go ahead, take pictures, but post them in a location for everyone to see. How about a gallery on this board, trash and graffiti?

				Its a waste of time to tell the community&#39;s leadership old news about trash and dirty streets (facts that have been repeatedly and clearly covered in reports these people are already getting from the city). <br /><br />Its also a waste of time in thinking we can open up their eyes with pictures that identify a chronic problem (that with the exception this leadership, the rest of us have no problem in seeing and being upset over.)<br /><br />Indeed, our community leadership is undertaking policies that only make this problem worse.<br /><br />Perhaps a more effective tactic would be to have this board become a marvelous place to set up a photo gallery on trash and graffiti in the community.<br /><br />Remember, we are dead last in cleanliness for 14 community boards in Queens. Outside of the posters on this board, it just doesn&#39;t seem to make the public radar anywhere else. This is not only inexcusable, but something that should be squarely placed at our leadership&#39;s feet.<br /><br />Sure, go ahead and contact them if you wish. But this board has the key to making real progress on this issue.

				This city is filthy all around. (But in Astoria, especially on Broadway-- man, do I need to see putrifying rot with litter stuck to it every morning?) I believe the &#39;personal is political&#39; so I try to pick up stuff and place it in the garbage can, even when its not mine (I know, revolutionary!) but honestly, its the NYC culture. On 34th street where we&#39;re at, all the old ladies just put their little individual bundles of crap (why spend money on actual garbage bags when you can just use 23 little Eckerd plastic shopping bags?) in the middle of the sidewalk. That&#39;s their idea of sanitation. This town is totally anachronistic. I&#39;m surprised that a horse-drawn buggy isn&#39;t collecting the trash with a giant iron hook or something.

				&quot;Wow, there&#39;s a lot of garbage on the streets.&quot;<br /><br />One of the first things my friend visiting from Chile said to me whilst in Astoria.<br /><br />I think it is a cultural thing. Sad to say this, but it is mainly uneducated and/or ignorant segments of the population that litter.<br /><br />It is almost an unspoken language in certain Latin and European (I guess, in a way, all cultures have something like this) cultures that the public space outside of their homes, is not their responsibility (&quot;Someone else will clean it&quot; or &quot;It&#39;s the city&#39;s responsibility, not mine&quot; mentality). <br /><br />Their homes are immaculately clean; however, the very same people who keep their homes clean, are seen blatantly tossing out garbage into the streets and constantly littering. This is from my own observations.<br /><br />It starts with the parents. Teach your kids not to litter, and they usually won&#39;t.

				I think calling DOS might help, though that&#39;s based on conjecture, not actual experience.&nbsp; Calling the Councilmembers a few times to make sure they know problem corners would help especially if we get them to focus on it, but jamming their phone lines, I think, would be counterproductive - they don&#39;t control basket placement.&nbsp; I would like to see more trash cans.&nbsp; I had to walk out of my way to pitch a bottle and bag on 31st Avenue the other day and it drove home to me how few baskets there were on that avenue.

				Well, megc, had no idea of your past in activism at Berkeley - I remember the time the whole country watched what happened there! That being said, your experience may not be completely transferable. I can assure you, Astoria is far removed from Berkeley!<br /><br />Yes, you are correct, contacting the politicians is traditionally the first route to follow, despite the fact they are regularly getting the reports, and seeing the litter like the rest of us. Unlike the rest of us, they are in a position to do something about it and have done precious little. <br /><br />megc, if you were in their position I have no doubt that things would be different.<br /><br />I also have little doubt, that after notifying them, we will see paper headlines of concern, and flurry of activity, but nothing to address the underlying causes (no I am not going to get into a long winded discussion on that there). <br /><br />The only point is that a year from now, when things are not different, would you echo their excuses?<br /><br />You know as well as everyone the old adage about those who do not learn from history being condemned to repeat it. You can ignore my experience and perspective. It doesn&#39;t place a penny in my pocket if you accepted it, either. <br /><br />Just wanted to suggest some new ideas to break this log jam: ideas about posting the images on the website and keeping the culprits behind this problem at arm&#39;s length (and certainly not making them heroes for a mess they created) and to perhaps even subject them to (gasp!) criticism?<br /><br />Oh that Donald Rumsfeld was in charge of Astoria! It would not be any better governed, but the body politic would comment freely! (Relax guys, tongue in cheek!)<br /><br />PS It is not so easy to say there is public squalor in foreign countries. There are cities around the world from many diverse cultures that are spotless. <br /><br />Its just that there are no public expectations in this community for cleanliness. Whatever happened against the anti-litter campaigns in from 40+ years ago? Again, a leadership issue.<br /><br />Litter is, above all, a class issue.<br />

				I prefer to not be a pessimist. I prefer to try and make a positive impact, so<br />do we want to collect signatures as part of our pitch to add more trash cans? <br />do we need to lobby for more trash trucks to pick up trash?<br />do we want to do community education like a trash pick up in partnership with area schools and religious institutions (churches, mosques, synagogues)?<br />there are many things we can do but we should start somewhere...

				In the Ditmars subway station tonight there were Choo Choo&#39;s flyers all over the ground. It was as if they&#39;d hired someone to hand them out, and then he got tired of it and just threw them on the ground up there and told them he&#39;d gotten rid of them all. It was pretty ridiculous.

				I saw a lovely illustration of what&#39;s wrong with the garbage cans on Ditmars today. It is a very windy day, which of course those cans are built to be very bad at dealing with. So I was walking down the street, and a gust of wind came and blew a bunch of loose newspaper pages out of the garbage can and into some guy&#39;s face. True, today is especially windy and I guess we shouldn&#39;t expect everything to hold up under unusual weather conditions, but things get blown out of the cans when there is much less wind. This was just a shining example. The other kinds of cans held the trash in more.
