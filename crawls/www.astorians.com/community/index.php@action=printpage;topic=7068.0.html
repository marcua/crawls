				I always seem to get the same two songs stuck in my head. &quot;Forever Young&quot; by Alphaville and &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot; (various singers). Does anyone else have this problem? What songs seem to get stuck in your head?

				Where I come from, we call this &quot;the jukebox from hell&quot;.<br /><br />Right now it&#039;s &quot;Maniac&quot; from Flashdance!&nbsp; However, I hear both the melody and my own countermelody simultaneously in my head, which makes it a little more interesting.&nbsp; :D

				So I actually got to catch the last JackFM song yesterday - got out of work early, and while I was driving home on the GCP, they played the last song - Journey&#039;s &quot;Don&#039;t Stop Believing&quot;. It&#039;s only, oh, my very favorite car song. (Car song = a song that is awesome to sing along with while you&#039;re driving.) Yes, I was singing along at the top of my off-key lungs. (I never said I wasn&#039;t a dork.)<br /><br />And now it&#039;s stuck in my head.<br /><br />Also, yes, JackFM pulled a Sporanos to end their run. Kinda cute, but the joke is old.

				Awesome topic, Urrisgirl. <br /><br />Recently, I have had &quot;Forthnight&quot; by musiqsoulchild playing in my head and sometimes I actually start singing it outloud.&nbsp; I really only know the words to the chorus and I&#039;m not even sure I have those 100% correct.<br /><br />In addition, I have &#039;Lazy Lover&quot; by the Brazilian Girls frequently popping up in my head! <br /><br />I&#039;ll come up with more as they come into my head.

				An earworm!<br /><br />Direct translation from German, courtesy of an international student teacher who worked with thatjimguy once.&nbsp; We&#039;ve called those songs earworms ever since.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been having random Jack Johnson songs as earworms for the past week or so.&nbsp; Right now it&#039;s Mediocre Bad Guys.

				Probably one of my least favorite songs ever, and unfortunately it gets played at EVERY Yankee game and is subsequently stuck in my head for at least two days afterwards is &quot;Cotton Eye Joe.&quot;&nbsp; It makes me want to take a melon baller to my brain.&nbsp;

				http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT5AQIlmM0I (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT5AQIlmM0I)<br /><br />The songs that are stuck in your head are one thing, but how about getting this one stuck. I am randomly asking aloud in the office &quot;who da boom king?&quot; and then since no one has a clue what the hell i&#039;m talking about i am forced to answer my own question, which is of course &quot;i&#039;m da boom king&quot;.<br />&nbsp;:lol: Very unsettling and awkward. :lol: <br />But this show and the song above have embedded themselves in my brain since watching this show that debuted when the sopranos ended.<br /><br />The show is of course &quot;Flight of the Conchords&quot;.

				usually it&#039;s some ridiculously crappy pop song that i accidentally heard in a store that gets stuck in there, and since i have no idea how it continues or who it&#039;s by it won&#039;t go away. the only way i shake it is to listen to it in its entirety so that the clip in my head goes away.<br /><br />there&#039;s been one stuck in there for a week...but i can&#039;t remember it now (it&#039;s been in tons of ads, most recently a pantene commercial) i hate it.<br />since i have itunes on all i have in my head is what&#039;s playin - Time and Time Again by Papa Roach, with the Card Cheat by the Clash starting right now.

				its very&nbsp; annoying when this happens ..&amp;.there is actually a term for it, it is called an:<br /><br />&nbsp; &quot;Earworm&quot;...a portion of a song or other music that repeats compulsively within one&#039;s mind, known colloquially as &quot;music being stuck in ones head.&quot; People with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are more likely to report being troubled by ear worms - in some cases, medications for OCD can minimize the effects.Earworms should not be confused with endomusia, a serious affliction, through which a sufferer actually hears music that is not playing externally.
