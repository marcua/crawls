				Thank you sweeper... I heard that opening day was on the 18th but I havent received the uniforms.&nbsp; My brother was on the league when he was a kid.&nbsp; That was about 30 years ago and now my sons are playing.. so they have been here for a while.&nbsp; Im so excited for the opening day parade.&nbsp;

				That opening day parade is a loooong walk for the t-ball kids. My son was 5 last year and I was real surprised at how far we had to walk.

				Yes,the parade is on Saturday.Starts at 10,your child&#039;s coach probably wants them there at 9.The uniforms are in.Coaches should have called by now.Games start tomorrow,but that doesn&#039;t necessarily mean your child has a game.<br /><br />If you have heard any rumors about the DEP closing the fields,disregard them.They were tested(as they are every few years) and everthing came back negative.<br /><br />Good Luck to your children on their upcoming season.
