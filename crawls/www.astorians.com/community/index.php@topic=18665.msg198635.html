I do. Your office has done nothing about all the (fire-trap) illegal basement apartments all over Astoria. (Hmm, was that an illegal basement apartment you kept as a sleep-over joint?) Absolutely nothing. All you would have to do is read the Craigslist postings and then get Housing to go over and we could rid ourselves of this terrible blight of greedy home owners. And now let me talk about your input into Astoria&#039;s rezoning. If you look at the new rezoned map it becomes apparent that your home area is left so that it will not become destroyed, but not mine which will be totally destroyed. You, and your friends from CB1, including Judy Trilivas from Mt. Sinai of Queens Hospital, saw to it that 30th Road, from 29th Street to Crescent Street will be totally devastated. You and your friends think it is a good idea to build a nine story commercial building on a residential block all for greed. My family has been in Astoria since 1931. I grew up here. I raised my children here. I lost two husbands here. My roots are firmly planted here. I have lived in the same place since 1964, and I plan on fighting you to my death to stop this construction. How can you say that care about quality of life when this project will adversely impact the lives of all residents on this block. Seven 6 story buildings with more people than in many small towns. Is it that the Hospital made donations to your reelection committee and that endeared them to you, or do you really believe that it is nothing more than greed that they want to build on this block rather than finding a parcel of land and building. There are dozens of builders, including your other friend Joseph Pistilli, who would be glad to buy the land the Hospital currently sits on, and perhaps one of them could turn it into something beautiful that we could be proud of . . . not like one of the really crappy Pistilli properties we&#039;re dealing with.<br />&nbsp;</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_198593">Wow- First of all, I am pretty impressed that Mr. Vallone actually took the time to respond to this thread. That in and of itself is definitely a point for him in my book. Some of his opponents on this thread are bashing him and picking quotes out of context and calling him rude and/or disrespectful for it. <br />I did not see disrespectful responses from Mr. Vallone on either the queenscrap blog in response to Leavingsoon nor did I see any in his response in this thread. The OP and a few subsequent posts were a giant attack on Vallone in general, and I wouldn&#039;t expect a warm reception from him. I have been pretty on the fence about my opinions on Vallone, but having seen this transgression and reading Vallone&#039;s response, I am actually growing to be more of Vallone fan.<br /><br />Many of the folks bashing him here seem to be <span class="bbc_u">completely ignoring</span> that there are, in fact, many of their complaints that the Councilman has absolutely no control or influence over. Instead, the response to the Councilman are bits and pieces of quotes taken out of context accusing him of insulting his constituents or wanting to destroy Astoria.<br /><br />Honestly, I am as distrustful of politicians as most people. Seeing the types of baseless bashing that has been occurring on this thread have actually made me empathize a bit with politicians. On this thread, I definitely did see a lot of disrespect going on, and it is surely not coming from the councilman&#039;s end. </div>

I was so embarrassed that my friends and family were smelling human s___, yet it was such a great affirmation that moving out of Astoria was the best thing I could have done for a better quality of life. Due to your lack in proper leadership, another good citizen has left. <br /><br />&quot;also have a meeting with DEP commish on that sewage smell (had the assistant commish to astoria to ride around and look for source of that disgusting smell.&nbsp; hasnt helped, but again, it&#039;s all i can do right now. &quot;<br /><br />I have told you where that smell is coming from. I know it, you know it, everyone who has been smelling it for the past 6 years has known it. Imagine that the smell is an error in your paycheck from the government and get it corrected today. Seriously. Just get it done. I don&#039;t give a crap how many letters you write, how many people you talk with.... People are tired of keeping their windows closed because it smells like s___. Plain and simple. Your war on graffiti isn&#039;t doing anything. Put your effort towards something that is affecting people&#039;s health. </div>

Secondly, I did not ignore NYC Mac User&#039;s post, it was not a post I was qualified to answer. <br />This is a perfect microcosm of the biggest problem in politics today: Politicians (Democrat, Republican, Independent, et al.) have relevant things on their agenda, but spend so much time trying to protect themselves from these people who blow little comments and ultimately irrelevant things out of proportion, that it takes away from the focus on the important issues. <br />Focusing on one random comment, and a <strong>rumor</strong> about him yelling at somebody is the equivalent of a Jerry Springer episode and takes away from your credibility as someone who actually cares about the well-being of Astoria. If you&#039;re going to attack the man, at least engage him on substance and acknowledge his responses whether you agree with them or not. </div>
