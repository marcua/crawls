				The one by Bareburger on 31st and 23rd ave? I was there in August for my Bday and had a great time. Food was good not the greatest of Greek foods I ever had but ok nonetheless and live music was a plus. I passed by today and it had a different name Dionysos. I did a Google check and it says permanently closed. Huh?

				That&#039;s too bad. I went with a group to Kopiaste last year and we all got the special Meze together. There was so much food and all of it was really good. The live Greek music was not quite my style though: a single guy singing playing an electric keyboard. I like Greek music in general but I&#039;m not fond of cheesy synth sounds.

They did a great job and everyone loved it, but there were issues like you said - that were off.&nbsp; Be it the lighting, or the music, or just the mood of the place.&nbsp; From what I hear from people who know that owner, business continued to drop off and then they lost the wind in their sails.&nbsp; This seems like an upstart that was rushed and disorganized.&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine it lasting unless they make some big changes very quickly.&nbsp; Again, I think it suffers from the odd building they&#039;re in and that it&#039;s in a dead zone off of 23rd and next to a construction site that shows no sign of actual construction.
