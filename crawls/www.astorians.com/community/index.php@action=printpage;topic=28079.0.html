The juice bar is located in the former party room of the Grand Cafe â€” now it is set off as its own separate bar space. The spot is serving cold press juices, organic smoothies and fresh organic liquor cocktails. Prices for juices are $7 for 16 ounces and $9.50 for 24 ounces. We hear that the morning hours will last until around 11 am, then the bar will reopen evenings to serve up cocktails. Grand Cafe itself is open for brunch, breakfast, lunch and dinner&quot;.....from the Brownstoner Queens</span></span>[/color]

				I just discovered this place today, was getting hair done in Saloon and someone came in with a fresh juice and a yogurt parfait and was talking about it.<br />Checked it out, it&#039;s a very very nice stylish looking place and they have a small bar with only organic liquor and wines.&nbsp; They let me sample their fresh juices.&nbsp; I&nbsp; ended up buying a vegan wrap with ginger dressing that was very tasty, i think it was $6 or 7.&nbsp; The menu is mostly fresh juices and smoothies, which they divide into &#039;old&#039; school and new school.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t ask them the details of this distinction, but their take out menu says &quot;centrifugal juicing&quot; under the Old school Juice and the other stuff is &quot;organic cold press.&quot;&nbsp; They share a hallway that leads to Grand Cafe also so I guess same owners?&nbsp; &nbsp;There were nice tables to sit at, but the AC was too high and the music was on a Sirius station that made me want to fall on a sword, every song was a&nbsp; syrupy emo-ballad like&nbsp; Five For Fighting.&nbsp; &nbsp;I like relaxing music when I eat but this was totally annoying. The&nbsp; staff was friendly and overall it&#039;s a thumbs -up.<br /><br /><br />

				There must be some connection or agreement with Grand due to the large sidewalk chalk ad that Ginger places right outside the front door of Grand on the ground.

				It is pricey, but honestly the juice was really good and the people working there seem to really care about what they&#039;re doing.&nbsp; They told us all about the juice machines, and how it&#039;s different from others, gave us tastes of things so we knew what to order, etc.&nbsp; Really a nicely run place.&nbsp; We even went back to have cocktails and that was just as nice of an experience too.&nbsp;
