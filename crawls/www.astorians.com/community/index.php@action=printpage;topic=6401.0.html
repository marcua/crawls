				Valverde just opened yesterday and it&#039;s pretty cute.&nbsp; Very tiny space but there is seating and delivery.<br /><br />I had brunch there this morning.&nbsp; $10 brunch menu includes OJ or coffee and a selection of eggs, paninis or pasta entrees.&nbsp; My friend and I both got Crostino di Valverde (scrambled eggs with parmesan cheese over toasted brioche) which came with baby potatoes and field greens.&nbsp; The eggs were excellent as was the service. <br /><br />They gave us a free slice of homemade ricotta cheesecake that was tasty.&nbsp; The owner (I think) said everything is made fresh from scratch, even the pasta.&nbsp; They were super nice and very happy to see us there.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be stopping by again for sure.<br /><br />They didn&#039;t have a lunch menu for me to take yet...they&#039;re in the midst of printing them.&nbsp; Dinner menu was posted in the window and seemed very reasonable with an average price for entrees at $15.

				Thanks for the review. I was wondering about this place after having seen it under construction the past weeks.<br /><br />I have a friend coming to visit next week and we&#039;ll definitely have to try it out.

				Just walked by this today and it looks good. The sign on the window outside says something about fresh local produce/farms, can&#039;t remember exactly what else - but it sounded like a move in the right direction.<br /><br />They also have a doggie station outside with water... aaaw.

				Just coming back to say that we went tonight and had a great meal. The owners were very very friendly, happy to answer questions, and quite knowledgeable. They know their food!&nbsp; It&#039;s still BYOB/W, but the liquor license is being processed. We had the branzino, a delicious grilled, white fish from Italy (seriously, the fish was amazing), and fettuccine with prosciutto and radicchio in a cream sauce... also delicious. We&#039;re looking forward to going back to try the brunch and will definitely go back for dinner again. Although we didn&#039;t possibly think we could eat another bite, we had the homemade ricotta cheesecake for dessert and it was light and delicious with a hint of lemon.<br /><br />A place like this is a great addition to the neighborhood - I hope you all give it a try so they can stay in business!!

				I agree with everyone here--it&#039;s a great addition to the neighborhood. <br /><br />I live right across the street, and I&#039;ve eaten there four or five times. The staff is fantastic and the food is really yummy. I&#039;ve had dinner and brunch--and the meals were all delicious. The caprese salad is especially fresh and delicious. <br /><br />The staff is nice and accommodating to kids, food is fresh and good--I hope they&#039;re in business for a long time. It&#039;s a real neighborhood place which makes it a great addition to my stretch of Steinway.&nbsp; Not that I don&#039;t love Captin Tire. . . <br />

				I had dinner there this week and they did have wine - a really nice Spanish red, the name of which escapes me - so perhaps the liquor license has been secured.&nbsp; I wholeheartedly agree that the caprese is very nice - the creamiest homemade mozzarella I&#039;ve had here in the 11103.&nbsp; I also had some fine lasagna. And of course the yum homemade focaccia.<br /><br />It is a small place, warm and welcoming, and as others have said the staff are very friendly and knowledgable - they also read Astorians.com and welcomed my suggestion that they initiate their own web site to make delivery easier for internetted people in the hood. <br /><br />Michelle

				Thanks Java for the correction; at least they are walking distance from my zip and doorstep. And BTW sweet beagle!<br /><br />We had delivery for 4 people from them last night and food arrived within 35 minutes, hot, labeled and spill-free. If you are a pesto fan, the linguine pesto is really, really tasty.

				Happy to add praise for this place.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been twice and both times the food was top notch and the service very welcoming, but not in a trying-too-hard type of way--just a good host (sorry, i don&#039;t know the gentleman&#039;s name yet.)&nbsp; And prices are amazingly low for such high quality preparation.&nbsp; They&#039;ve got a nice &quot;wine-tasting&quot; to go along with the meals where they pour you a few different glasses for, i think, seven bucks.&nbsp; I&#039;d encourage everyone to stop by to ensure this little oasis thrives in such an odd location.&nbsp; <br /><br />One suggestion to the owners; if at all possible, replace those fluorescent lights!&nbsp;

				Last time I ordered for delivery they sent a complimentary slice of a pretty tasty tiramisu. Was it the best tiramisu ever?&nbsp; No. But it was light, not-too-sweet and delish. And free.

				After having great breakfasts there a couple of times, I finally had dinner and was not disappointed.&nbsp; If only pasta were diet friendly, I could review it for you.&nbsp; Instead we had chicken (me lemon with thyme, him something with mushrooms) and enjoyed our dishes thoroughly.&nbsp; We started out with salads which were hearty enough to split one serving and, as usual, the service was just perfect:&nbsp; attentive enough without being overly so.

				I&#039;m glad that you resurrected this thread; I&#039;ve been meaning to add my review too.&nbsp; I had a really delicious dinner of risotto with sausage ragu, and the ricotta cheesecake for dessert.&nbsp; I highly recommend both!&nbsp; The risotto portion was large enough that I brought half of it home for lunch the next day.&nbsp; The owner brought us a sample of the linguini with pesto sauce which I will definitely try next.&nbsp; I really hope that this little place does well.<br /><br />By the way, has anyone tried the panini lunch special yet?

				It seems they finally changed the lights and now they have those really romantic chandeliers. I haven&#039;t see them but my girl just told me since she loves their food. <br /><br />I&#039;m telling her that we should go for appetizers to the soulovaki street vendor on Steinway and Broadway and then for entrees to Valverde.

				So many people recommended Valverde Cucina Italiana to me; even a few of their competitors (non-Italian) gave them a nod. This place is a real gem. I had never heard of them until last month, but since then, everyone I speak with asks me about Valverde.

				We went here last night before hitting the movies, and we&#039;ll definitely be going back.&nbsp; It was so cute, the food was so good.&nbsp; We got the buffalo mozzarella and prosciutto as a starter, and the mozz was so creamy and fresh and the prosciutto was just perfect.&nbsp; For our meals I got the sausage risotto and my girlfriend got the seafood risotto and both were really good.&nbsp; We finished off the meal with a slice of the ricotta cheesecake which was lighter than most of the ricotta cheesecakes I&#039;ve had.&nbsp; I was super impressed, and I&#039;m so glad that there&#039;s something in that neighborhood now aside from the Riviera Gentleman&#039;s Club and wholesale tire operations.

				I&#039;ve posted on this thread before, but I have to say it again: Valverde rocks. <br /><br />My boyfriend and I go whenever we can (at least once a week since it opened) and it&#039;s always a pleasure. <br />The meal we had tonight was no exception. BF got the lamb chop special and the meat was crazy good. So was the side of spinach. My pasta was yummy, but I was a wee bit jealous about that lamb. We also got an amazing special appetizer with fresh figs and prosciutto. Light and fresh and kind of amazing. <br /><br />I sound like a commercial, but I don&#039;t care. I work in Manhattan and eat out a lot for work. But it&#039;s so nice to get such good food and great service so close to home. <br /><br />Oh yeah, and the ricotta cheesecake is pretty darn good too.

				Playing hookie from work, I am currently sitting at home eating lunch from this place. I&#039;ve been in there twice before, and I LOVED it both times. I might have posted about it before on this thread but ... I have to tell you about my sammich ...... its just soooo good!<br />First of all I don&#039;t live in Astoria, but I live on Skillman ave just the other side of Northern. I was a little unsure if they would deliver to me, even tho it&#039;s extremely close, I wasn&#039;t sure if they&#039;d want to send the guy over the bridge that overpasses the train yards. But the guy on the phone assured me it was NO problem at all, and that the delivery will be very quick. He was so nice about it! I ordered a mozzarella and prosciutto panini, which is part of the lunch special. It&#039;s not grilled, its cold, but it is SO good. The prosciutto is tender and thin and theres a healthy amount of it, and it&#039;s not too salty either. The mozzarella is fresh and moist and soft and SO good. The bread is what kills me though. I have no idea what it&#039;s called but the crust is flaky and buttery and it melts in my mouth with each bite. The lunch special also came with salad, but it&#039;s mixed greens, and I&#039;m an iceburg kind of girl, but the greens seem very fresh and they included a little side thing of oil. For $6.95 how can you go wrong? They also included for free a drink, which it did not mention on the menu, and I&#039;m not quite sure what it is. I keep sniffing it and sipping it and I can&#039;t place it! It&#039;s deep red, kinda lemony, sorta sweet, not carbonated and definitely some type of juice. It&#039;s got a very distinct scent and taste, but I can&#039;t place it for the life of me. This is gonna bug me all day.

				I went for lunch today to this place. I had the salmon panini and a salad. The waitress served me the complementary iced tea which was savory and quenched my thirst. (I did some shopping this morning).<br /><br />The price was quite a bargain, 6.95. And the food had this fantastic, healthy taste and quality. And it is not grease or fried. I liked it. I took one panini to go for my husband and he loved it as well. <br />I will be ordering lunch tomorrow as well. Anybody recommend something for dinner?<br /><br />

				Finally got to this place last night after weeks of good intentions. (Walking from 30th Ave often seems like a good idea, then I get hungry.)<br /><br />The special was pork loin, I guess roasted, sliced, and finished quickly in the broiler, stacked with golden raisins, mushrooms, a bit of spinach, a bit of carrot.&nbsp; Some yummy polenta on the side.&nbsp; &nbsp;A bit of frothy sauce over the top was a little odd looking, but everything was delicious, and cooked perfectly.<br /><br />Nice people there too.&nbsp; I think I am going to be able to make the whole long walk down there often.<br /><br />It has so few tables (seating for maybe 20 people, max,) I hope just enough people believe me to keep it going. I don&#039;t like to wait in line.

				lol, that &quot;frothy sauce&quot; is actually a foam. Several avant-garde chef&#039;s use them like Marcel in their second season of Top Chef. My husband cooks as a hobby and tried several times to do it and it was --terrible (I&#039;m sorry honey).<br />However, the foam is supposed to be white and with texture. I had Parmesan foam over quail in &quot;Babbo&quot; --that was for my B-day. <br />I didn&#039;t know Valverde was serving such plates. That&#039;s very impressive. I will go this weekend to check it out if there&#039;s good weather.

				This is a Great little spot! <br /><br />To please my vegetarian/vegan palate Valverde, himself, offer to cooked an exquisite pasta full of vegetables, pistachios, and mushrooms. I was complemented with a dish of sliced organic tomatoes and mozzarella cheese, delicately adorned with FRESH basil leaves, and I mean FRESH because there were taken from one of the basil plants that serve as part of the décor.<br />The artisan bread –made on the premises- is phenomenal. <br /><br />And not only the food, but also everything about this place makes sense. The décor is elegant and subtle, the beer and wine selection caught my eye, and even the take out bags are gorgeous!<br />

				&nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br />I LOVE this restaurant. My husband and I ate there and were given a complimentary fig and prosciutto dish at the end of the meal. Every bit was incredible, best service, qaint setting. We were impressed by the wine and beer selections too. We ordered take-out from them another night, and it was the best takeout EVER! They sent everything, heaping portions, sides of grated cheese, fresh bread, all of it along with the meals. SO good.<br /><br />They are looking to expand their delivery (seeing as there are only, what, 3 tables?!) So order and enjoy.

				&nbsp;:-D I love this restaurant and can&#039;t say enough good things about it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried the pastas - Spinach Ravioli in sage butter sauce and Penne Bolognese, Lamb and Salmon entrees, and the soup and Panini&nbsp; lunch special (salmon and veggie are both great).&nbsp; Food is fresh, service is stellar and the wines are very&nbsp; good and reasonably priced.&nbsp; Ever since my husband and I discovered it over the summer, we&#039;ve been back on a regular basis (as often as we can get a babysitter!)

				<br />My wife and I are also big fans of Valverde.&nbsp; I must say that despite Astoria&#039;s reputation amongst some for being a dinning destination, I can&#039;t say its always easy to find fresh, simple and lovingly prepared food.&nbsp; &nbsp;Valverde is certainly a step in the right direction.<br /><br />We have only done lunch (take-out) and brunch here once thus far, but each experience was wonderful.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have posted the following pics on flickr with a sampling of our brunch and lunch choices.&nbsp; Please check them out: http://www.flickr.com/photos/pabo76/tags/valverde/ (http://www.flickr.com/photos/pabo76/tags/valverde/)

				Hi!<br />I&#039;m a newcomer to these boards, and a three-year resident of Astoria, and I just wanted to drop even MORE love on Valverde!&nbsp; My fiance and I went there for the first time for dinner after ordering takeout from them several times, and we weren&#039;t disappointed.&nbsp; He had the papadelle with bacon, cherry tomatoes, and red pepper and it was absolutely astounding.&nbsp; I had the seafood risotto which was also delicious, and a glass of Chianti that the owner recommended which was delightful and perfect with my food.&nbsp; We split the creme caramel which was so light and delicious and perfect to end our meal.&nbsp; The staff is so amazingly sweet--we&#039;d only been there once, but they remembered us when we returned to try brunch a week later before going Christmas shopping!&nbsp; Brunch is a must--their coffee is phenomenal (and I love coffee), the Crostini dish with Parmesan and scrambled eggs is delicious, and their bread is out of this world!<br />Better than all of that, while we were there the owner told us he&#039;d just installed a fresh pasta machine, which was kind of like telling my fiance that the Mets were going to win the World Series next year (who doesn&#039;t love fresh pasta?).&nbsp; We&#039;re definitely going to be back! :mrgreen:

				Went for dinner on Friday night, had the Lobster Ravioli for the first time. SO YUMMY! They re-arranged the seating area so it feels less clustered, its really nice. Also they didn&#039;t serve us the same bread like they used to, this time it was just regular Italian bread. I mean it was homemade and yummy, but i miss the fancy-er ones they used to serve. My friend had the linguine with mussels, which he said was delicious. Personally I hate mussels so I cant vouch.

				Yeah, I really wanted to try this place out, since I heard so many good things about it. I called for delivery one Saturday night with some friends and the answering machine picked up all of the 3 times we called. It was a Saturday night. If the machine picks up once, I understand, but 3 times within half an hour.... not good for business. I&#039;d still love to try it though.

				Kalhel.... Their menu is pretty seasonal (yet <em>another</em> reason to love them), so I&#039;m not sure how much posting one would help you.&nbsp; They&#039;re cool about people popping in to grab a copy of their takeout menu, though, which is essentially the same as the sit-down menu.&nbsp; My fiance took me there for dinner last night for my birthday (which is also their anniversary, so cool) and we had a fresh fruit and prosciutto appetizer that was absolutely out of this world.&nbsp; I could have eaten that dish all the live long day.&nbsp; My pasta was amazing as usual, but the appetizer was phenomenal.<br />Also, your puppy is super-sweet!
