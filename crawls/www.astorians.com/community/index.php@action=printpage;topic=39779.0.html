				<br />That unused space under the Acropolis Apartments...and next to Kyclades.... today I passed by the side entrance to that space, and I could see that the door was opened and workers were going in and out with 2 x 4s, etc.&nbsp; So.....maybe someone is finally going to be doing something with that space....??

				We Heart Astoria reports that it&#039;s going to be a bar. That&#039;s better than an empty storefront I guess?<br /><br />http://weheartastoria.com/2017/06/old-top-tomato-space-getting-new-bar-ditmars/ (http://weheartastoria.com/2017/06/old-top-tomato-space-getting-new-bar-ditmars/)<br /><br />

				Back in 2009, when Top Tomato closed, there was a robust discussion on Astorians about what people would like to see open in that space. Speculation was that for 3,000 square feet, which I believe included the basement area, the rent was a whopping $25,000 per month.<br /><br /><br />That&#039;s an outrageous price, even now. Average commercial rents currently in the Ditmars area run about $65.00 per square foot per year. At $25,000, this works out to $100 per square foot per year, which was why I thought the space was empty all this time.<br /><br /><br />Anyway, good luck to what/who ever opens up a business in that space. It&#039;s been boarded up for far too long.

				Just confirmed it will be a Craft Brew bar called River Crest (named after the sanitarium that used to be where St. John&#039;s Prep is).&nbsp; The construction company working on the site also built the Pomeroy and many other bars in Manhattan.<br /><br />https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170816/ditmars/river-crest-beer-bar-3315-ditmars-blvd-old-top-tomato-space<br /><br />Navac Construction comany<br />http://navacbuilders.com/<br /><br />River Crest Sanitarium<br />http://www.brownstoner.com/history/remains-of-a-former-astoria-asylum/<br /><br /><br />
