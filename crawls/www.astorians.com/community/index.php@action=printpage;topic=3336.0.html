				Greetings!<br />So today is the first Official Redskins Game of the season where we will set the tone of the rest of the season by either destroying the Vikings or getting our asses handed to us.&nbsp; Woohoo!!<br /><br />I am from DC and the bar I go to is in the city (Insert sucks).&nbsp; Are there any other skins fans on this board or in the hood that might want to find a local bar and make it our own?&nbsp; <br /><br />Just a thought.&nbsp; <br /><br />(http://imagecache2.allposters.com/images/pic/PHO/AAGL099~Washington-Redskins-Helmet-Logo-Photofile-Posters.jpg)

I like to watch games with rival fans but only if they can be good sports too, no matter the outcome. I never could watch Cowboys/Steelers games with my stepdad, besides the fact he&#39;s an a** and I can&#39;t stand him, he is such a sore loser and an even worse winner. I called him up to congratulate the Super Bowl win but he would rather lose an arm than congratulate me on anything, ESPECIALLY the Cowboys. It&#39;s not fun watching games with people like that for me. With that in mind, we need to have some football get-togethers. Washington next week which I&#39;m pretty sure will air here. Monday Night 10/23 - Duluoz - Giants at Dallas!<br /><br />Aren&#39;t there any Jets fans here? I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re not bragging with that win yesterday!<br />

				I doubt to catch much football.<br />But I know that fans have very strong allegiances to the Redskins and Cowboys. <br />Makes no sense to me.<br />But then some dont understand the magnitude of USC v UCLA.<br /><br />When the matches took place, I knew one of our friends would be too depressed to speak for a week.<br />It is a sickness.<br /><br />Now a relative lives and dies for the Cowboys.<br />Wish we too had a movie theater with dining tables where you could watch sports...

				Too bad I didn&#39;t see this post until this morning; I am a huge &#39;Skins fan (or &#39;Sinks fan, as it were) -- I&#39;m from Bethesda.&nbsp; It was heartbreaking to watch the last five minutes of the game the other night.&nbsp; All I have to say is, *@%&amp; you, Sean Taylor.<br /><br />I&#39;d definitely be up for watching the &#39;Skins and Cowboys on Sunday night, but it&#39;s a bit late for me to head into Manhattan (I think the game starts at 8:15?).&nbsp; It might be a pizza-and-beer-in-my-apartment sort of thing.&nbsp; If there is a local place you have in mind, though, I would consider it...

				Well, after watching the Spankees lose and the Amazins win last night, I didn&#39;t think this weekend could get much better.&nbsp; But then I remembered that the &#39;Sinks and the Gints play this afternoon, and then T.O. returns to Philly (he&#39;ll wish he really had killed himself when Iggles fans start pelting him with batteries).&nbsp; I got a case of Red Stripe and a box of apple cider donuts (a connecticut specialty, apparently).&nbsp; Yup, my day is all planned out.<br /><br />I am not a loser.<br />bennyt
