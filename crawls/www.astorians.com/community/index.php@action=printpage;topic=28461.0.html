				I popped into Ditmars Station last week and was told that they weren&#039;t serving food because of a gas issue. So it seems like something is up with that block. <br />

				Around the time the sign first appeared on the window about ConEd issues, I noticed there was another piece of paper on one of the tables by the front window; I read it, and it said something about propane tanks not being allowed.&nbsp; So seems to corroborate the gas issue.

				It&#039;s a small item but their Lentil Soup is delicious and different than elsewhere.&nbsp; Try it.&nbsp; The Kofta is really good too.&nbsp; I like these guys and the place is very clean, bright, and welcoming to even eat in.
