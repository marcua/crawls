			Looking for good ideas for daytrips out and around the city. &nbsp;Be it hiking, biking, sight seeing, shopping, or just a good train ride - where do you go when you&#039;ve got to get out of town?<br /><br />Found a short list of places to go via Metro North --<br /><br />http://mta.info/mnr/html/outbound.htm<br /><br />And a little blurb about a long aqueduct hike/walk/destination that sounded cool --<br /><br />http://mta.info/mnr/html/getaways/outbound_gohiking.htm<br /><br />&quot;The Old Croton Aqueduct is a 26-mile level footpath atop the masonry tunnel that first brought clean water to New York in 1842. The path wends through green landscapes, architectural treasures, and historic sites. Easiest access to the trail is from Greystone or Dobbs Ferry Station. Call the manager of the Old Croton Aqueduct at 914-693-5259 for more information. Trail maps may be purchased from The Friends of the Old Croton Aqueduct at 914-693-4117 or visit their Web site at www.aqueduct.org&quot;<br /><br />What else is there?
