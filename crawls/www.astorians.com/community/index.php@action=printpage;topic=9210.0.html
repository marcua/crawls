				I can&#039;t reveal the biggest lie I ever told, but I can tell you the first lie which I remember telling, which, incidentally, is the first thing I rememeber saying.<br /><br />In Mrs. Smith&#039;s first grade class, we had an assignment in class to write out sentences.&nbsp; Instead of writing them out, I started drawing and when I realized that I didn&#039;t have enough time to do the work, I asked Mrs. Smith for more time.&nbsp; She asked me if the time was so I could write outextra long sentences.&nbsp; I just blankly said &quot;yes&quot; and went back to my seat.<br /><br />According to my ex&#039;s, my proclivity to lie to women has continued to this day.&nbsp; <br />

				I was a big nerd in school and I always wanted to please my parents by getting the good grades. &nbsp;One day in elementary school, I got a really bad grade (probably an F) on some quiz I took, and was told I had to get it signed by my parents. &nbsp;Well, I was so upset about it, and my parent&#039;s potential reaction to it, that I forged my mom&#039;s signature on it, and hid it under my bed. &nbsp;Well, you can&#039;t hide things from your mother. &nbsp;She found that paper, by God, and was horrified, confronted me, I ended up crying my eyes out, and well, I can&#039;t remember what my punishment was. &nbsp;But her disappointment in me was probably enough.<br /><br />Geez, a nerd&#039;s lies are so boring. &nbsp; :-P

				When I was 15 I told my parents that I was sleeping over my friend Siobhan&#039;s house and she said she was sleeping over my house. We packed out knapsacks and headed into the city from LI. We had concert tickets to see the Jesus and Mary Chain and I knew my parents wouldn&#039;t let me stay out past my curfew of 11pm- which is when the concert started. So my friend and I went to the concert, went to a pizza place, and walked around until about 4am when we went back to Penn station and took the train back to LI and slept in one of the train shelters. Not my brightest moment. <br /><br />Unfortunately Siobhan forgot to call work and tell them she wouldn&#039;t be in the next day- her mom called my house looking for her and let&#039;s just say the sh*t hit the fan. I was grounded for a very long time. In fact I am 36 now and I think I might still be grounded!&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)<br /><br />God help me if I have children. :|
