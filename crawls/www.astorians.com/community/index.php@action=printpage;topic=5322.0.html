				So i know:<br />A) I am severely allergic to mushrooms<br />B) A truffle is a fancy schmancy kind of mushroom<br />C) I keep seeing truffle sauce/oil on just about everything i want to sample recently<br /><br />my lame question:<br />Am i correct in assuming all truffle stuff (other than the chocolate dessert kinds) is mushroom based, and would therefore stage a violent revolt against me? <br /><br />my random question:<br />Do you think places would be appalled if i asked them to not involve truffle stuff at all on things i want to eat? especially if i explain my allergy ( i&#039;ve started to whip that card out when i ask to with hold mushrooms as i have gotten dirty looks from servers in the past when i don&#039;t mention it-and sure enough there were the little buggers in my food)<br /><br />no need to answer question:<br />What is the obsession with fungi?! mushrooms are in everything lately! ugh!

				I, too, do <strong>NOT</strong> see the love people have for the fungus.&#160;&nbsp; :-(<br /><br />and yes, truffles are in the mushroom family.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t touch anything remotely related to it.

If they are appalled by your request, I would NOT go back to that restaurant again. Allergic reactions can be severe and all restaurants should take the requests very seriously. <br /><br />I am on a 100% gluten-free diet (no wheat, rye, oats, and barely) for Celiac Disease and I always speak up about what I can&#039;t eat. Why should I physically suffer after dining out? I say speak up!!&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				usually they are appalled when i don&#039;t specify the allergy. it somehow must make their life more difficult to add my request. when i say i&#039;m severely allergic i&#039;ve been golden. <br />i must admit, that i am socially awkward and sometimes have trouble asking for clarification on items, or making a special request. hence, rather than ask at a food place i asked here. i just pick something else to eat.<br />i mostly asked b/c i saw the menu for il babino and most everything i would want to eat has that damn truffle oil or some sort of mushroom. hence i wound up not going. (sorry about that!)<br />the socially awkward thing is why i don&#039;t go out to so many astorians events-i think i&#039;ll make an ass out of myself b/c well i AM an ass. usually though in the astorians case i look like more of an ass b.c i say i&#039;m coming and then i chicken out. <br />

(Did you also mention Retchup ?)<br />But you should try to enjoy Eats one month soon.&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />I dont let being an Ass stop myself. You might be surprised how welcoming it can be.<br />In the recent case, lovely people were at a nearby table even though they were not part of the event.<br />You could do the same if you wanted.<br /><br />Just make sure Flooz is there. (You were surely missed. !) Her pix will keep you in good cheer<br />&nbsp;:yuck:<br />[ even though she &#039;hates&#039; people]

				oh silly! there are many asses at any given EATS event, me usually being one of them. i can field the interogations for you if you&#039;d like. i&#039;d be happy to investigate ingredients in dishes we are getting. i usually don&#039;t cause my stomach is made of steel and i eat pretty much everything (as my rubenesque figure would indeed prove). if i had known you didn&#039;t attend dinners because of this, i would have told you that this is easy enough to remedy ie: one of the sandwiches with like 3 cheeses in it that is truffle oiled- i saw Darren making mine one day and he drizzles it on after making the sandwich. easy cheesey to leave that part out see?!?!<br />now listen, no more excuses not to eat out with the crazy lot of us!&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				thanks for all the encouragement and confirmations that i should avoid truffles (but not JD&#039;s-i need to gets me some of those!) at all costs.<br />and its official-next event involving food-flooz, you shall be my translator/investigator. <br />oh, and i WILL make an ass outta myself.&nbsp; :-D although i think i managed to avoid doing that at the one EATS event i went to (indigo).<br />&nbsp;:mrgreen:
