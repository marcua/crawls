				this might be a silly question but I&#39;m just curious...<br /><br />do you think a 20-something girl would be safe walking 5 or so blocks to the Steinway stop at 5:30 am on a Saturday or Sunday?<br /><br />

				Not sure where you&#39;re walking from, but you&#39;ll likely see people who were out late the night before and are just about heading home.&nbsp; I would be cautious if you&#39;re on your own.

				I&#39;ve tried walking to the gym (when I&#39;m ambitious) at 6:15am on weekdays and basically decided I need to go later... there are a handful of people around, especially once you get to a main street, but the smaller side streets made me nervous.

				Going along the same kinda thread - I&#39;m a new resident to the area of Astoria, How safe is the area in general at night etc - Are there any known &quot;trouble spots&quot; that need to be avoided at certain times that any locals could advise upon?<br /><br />The whole area seems very nice and it was the ambience and general good feeling I got from the area that made me want to move out here, but as with all areas, there are certain things that only experience and living in a place a while that you will be aware of.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />

				It&#39;s probably pretty safe. What side are you coming from? You can hop on the stienway station pretty close to broadway which is okay. There are a number of homeless people around but they don&#39;t bother anybody. You might have a raucousy group of youths coming back from the club. But generally, I think you&#39;d be okay.<br />

				I&#39;ve always been fine but I usually walk with purpose, carry my cell phone all the time, and am knowledgeable of my surroundings.&nbsp; I had a boyfriend who would walk me home at 5:30am (gasp!) just because he didn&#39;t want me walking alone and I always accepted, because well, you never know.&nbsp; There used to be this crazy homeless guy around Ditmars who would wear a little hoodrat pantyhose cap and would talk very loudly and angrily to himself.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t seen him in a long time so maybe he went away but he would be around at this time and my boyfriend would walk me home just so I wouldn&#39;t be alone around him.&nbsp; But every other homeless person around here has appeared to be harmless.&nbsp; It&#39;s the rowdy teenagers I worry more about but in general it&#39;s a safe area so you shouldn&#39;t have to worry about anything.
