			Hi Everyone!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Ill be graduating college in may and working in midtown. I am thinking of moving to Astoria. Any suggestions on good areas to look for apartment (1 or 2 bedroom) for this August. Also are there alot of recent grads in the area and where do they hang out?<br /><br />Thanks!

			I&#039;m a relatively recent college grad (5 yrs) and live near ditmars. love the neighborhood. although there is a pretty good local bar scene (primarily by broadway), i think most people hang out in the city as the commute is very short. i personally like the ditmars side better as it alittle quieter, but still has a ton of restaurants, and is close to the park.

			From 36th Avenue on the N/W, which I used to live at, you could make it to 49th Street in fifteen minutes.&nbsp; I would add a couple of minutes to each stop as you head north (Broadway, 30th Avenue, Astoria Boulevard, and Ditmars)&nbsp; Please note that I am counting from the time that you get on the train and it&#039;s actually in motion. In my experience (I worked off of the 49th St. stop for a combined 3 to 4 years) and I did not take account for your walk to the train, etc.&nbsp; I was fortunate because I lived about a block away from the 36th Avenue stop. <br /><br />
