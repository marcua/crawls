				There were bombings in New York during 1960&#039;s and 70&#039;s, including one on Broadway in Astoria, involving a Croation travel agency, on (If I recall right)&nbsp; 36th street.&nbsp; &nbsp; There was also the bombing of Franses Tavern (sp?)&nbsp; in New York which killed a few people, and the FALN bombers, who blew themselves up more than anything else&nbsp; :-D&nbsp; I remember the leader of that group being shown after second time his bombs exploded on him, he was missing fingers, a leg----and if I sound cruel, remember, he was intending to&nbsp; do it to others, so better the bomber gets it than some victim.

BTW, God Bless twins, that must be something.&nbsp; :mrgreen: So, the Woodstock generation started on a&nbsp; LIE?&nbsp; OK, I at least thought they were being truthful.&nbsp; :lol:&nbsp; Just kidding. I play drums/skins, and over the years have run across&nbsp; many musicians and folks who were there, and they have given me a decidedly different&nbsp; view of the event. You list Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, these folks weren&#039;t&nbsp; &#039;Hippies&#039;, but, &#039;Yippies&#039;, the &quot;peace and love&#039; they advocated had a&nbsp; healthy, or IMO unhealthy, dose of Marxism. Still, &#039;Steal This Book&#039; was one of the first books I ever read, in my &#039;Lefty&#039; days, when my hair&nbsp; was long and Led Zeppelin was playing the Garden. Older than your twin sons, by about a decade, I did&nbsp; know folks who still idolised Hoffman till his unfortunate death.&nbsp; Abbie Hoffman. In a speech he made only a few years before his death, Abbie described the Left as &#039;three people in a phone booth, with two conspiring to throw the third one out because the third one is a revisionist.&#039; I can attest&nbsp; to this view, as most intolerance&nbsp; I find is coming from the Left. Though his politics may have ranged from far left in the 1960s to much more &#039;moderate&#039; toward the end of his life, Abbie, as you correctly stated, believed groups of people, black and white, rich and poor, conservative and liberal, could be brought together if they focused on a single issue. Yes, the vegan, lesbian could probably stand to be in the same room with the middle-aged, cigar-chomping, meat-eating homophobic construction worker if they both opposed the purchase of pristine forest land by a developer. <br /><br />Sadly, this&nbsp; did not last long, beyond&nbsp; the well-meaning, but, naive, Woodstock generation. Free Love, led&nbsp; to &#039;Aids&#039; and broken families, &#039;Peace&#039; at any cost, led to manipulation by Communist and even Fascist&nbsp; forces, that would end such freedom.Leonard Weinglass, the famed lawyer for Tom Hayden, Abbie Hoffman, and the Chicago Seven, is now counsel for Black Panther and cop-killer Mumia Abu, which I referred&nbsp; to earlier.&nbsp; There&nbsp; are millions&nbsp; of examples&nbsp; of bad things&nbsp; that happened as a result of what you refer&nbsp; to as the &#039;resistance&#039; movement of the 60&#039;s. Certainly, Vietnam&nbsp; was not justified, as to the cost of blood, especially since&nbsp; the Vietnamese had the support&nbsp; from China and the Soviets and had defeated&nbsp; the French in the&nbsp; 50s. But, like&nbsp; the goals of maximum Freedom you profess, the intent was good, in turning back Communism as the intent of fighting Fascism, today symbolised by religious extremist in the 9/11 attacks and others worldwide. We should be on the same side. I hate being in conflict with my fellow&nbsp; Americans, more to the point, Astorians. :| I hate&nbsp; that we have &#039;speech codes.&#039; In the end&nbsp; Abbie Hoffman, killed himself during a deep depressive period. One can be critical about the war,&nbsp; Abu Gharib, and the reasons U.S. troops were over there in the first place. But,&nbsp; the Left should be loudly cheering,&nbsp; the capture and overthrow of Saddam Hussein, who kept his people under his boot, and horribly tortured and killed anybody who dared oppose him. The Left should be drowning out the Right with cheers that this man is no longer a threat to anyone. The left should be out in front opposing Islamic fascism, that subjugates women and kills&nbsp; gay and lesbian folks. After all, in the end, Al Qeada, and&nbsp; Saddam, and others like them, didn&#039;t see us as Hippies, Yippies, Punks, Lesbian , Gay, Straight, Republican, Democrat, Left or Right. They saw Americans, and that was enough. <br />

We need to protect our borders and citizens without going to war with anyone ever again. But, oh, wait, John McCain thinks we&#039;re going to have to stay in Iraq for the next hundred years.

Back in the 60s no-one understood how depression affected the human brain; it wasn&#039;t until the early 80s that he was finally diagnosed as manic-depressive; now known as Bipolar Disorder. He was put on newly discovered medication a few years later, but it never helped his deepest, darkest bouts of depression. Only after weeks of not being able to get out of bed, home alone in a small apartment in New Hope, PA, and helping his mother deal with her impending death from cancer did I finally accepted the coroner&#039;s report of suicide as a result of the amount of Phenobarbital found in his system. I don&#039;t remember who said this at Abbie&#039;s funeral, but I somehow always remembered it: Abbie lived his life in the Jewish prophetic tradition, which is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.

				Thanks for the links. That is a good summary of abortion clinic violence.<br /><br />The other proves exactly what I am talking about. How does someone who advocates murder get to a point where he is serving on board with the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party? Why are people like this even tolerated? William Ayers is a filthy POS. What type of person would give him a job? It is not about disagreement of someone position, it&#039;s about having a level of decency. And it&#039;s not like he is barely surviving, he&#039;s thriving, with popular magazine writing fawning articles about him.<br />One last thing; am I the only one who hates Hyde Park communists?

Huh? Yes, they and Abbie&#039;s wife, Anita started the YIPPIE (Youth International Party) movement. It was a radical change from the peace(ful) loving HIPPIES of that era. We were the group that wasn&#039;t going to sit down in the streets and continue to get our heads busted open. We had theatrical and symbolic methods to get our point across.<br />What the hell are you talking about? You need to get some facts together before you spout this kind of crap. You should spend a little time reading about AIDS before making such blatantly incorrect statements. And as far as broken families, would you be so kind as to tell me exactly what a broken family is? Surely you couldn&#039;t possibly mean a single parent family, could you? Even for you and some of the stuff I&#039;ve read that you&#039;ve said, that would be too ignorant even for you.<br />Gimme some of &#039;em details, please. You probably won&#039;t be mentioning the food co-ops started all over the US; or the free medical clinics for children and other disenfranchised citizens; surely there will be no mention of non-corporate owned media, like the hundreds of free newspapers that printed the truths about what the regular media was sweetening.<br />Iraq was just as not justified. Hell, even France wanted nothing to do with it! &#039;Member that? Would you like an order of Freedom Fries with that?<br />If you really hate being in conflict, then why don&#039;t you start to moderate your own posts? How many of our husbands, fathers and sons died to overthrow Saddam Hussein? Even one would be too many. We didn&#039;t belong there. We, all non-Muslims, are considered as heathens by those who applauded the acts of 9/11. It had nothing to do with our Nationality. It was all about the freedom of our religious beliefs. I don&#039;t want to have anyone tell me how to live my life and therefore I will not tell anyone else how to live theirs. Al Qeada&#039;s ultimate goal is to wipe Israel and all the Jews off the face of the earth. Once they accomplish this they will start on the Christians. Their change has to come from the inside. We need to protect our borders and citizens without going to war with anyone ever again. But, oh, wait, John McCain thinks we&#039;re going to have to stay in Iraq for the next hundred years. Yeah, that&#039;s the way to make peace in the world.<br /><br />And one other thing, Abbie was my friend. Back in the 60s no-one understood how depression affected the human brain; it wasn&#039;t until the early 80s that he was finally diagnosed as manic-depressive; now known as Bipolar Disorder. He was put on newly discovered medication a few years later, but it never helped his deepest, darkest bouts of depression. Only after weeks of not being able to get out of bed, home alone in a small apartment in New Hope, PA, and helping his mother deal with her impending death from cancer did I finally accepted the coroner&#039;s report of suicide as a result of the amount of Phenobarbital found in his system. I don&#039;t remember who said this at Abbie&#039;s funeral, but I somehow always remembered it: Abbie lived his life in the Jewish prophetic tradition, which is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Follow, I mentioned &nbsp;HIPPIES, and you mentioned &nbsp;YIPPIES, I was pointing it it was NOT the same thing. As you acknowledged. No reason to get upset.<br /><br />You are telling me that &nbsp;AIDS &nbsp;and the the explosion of broken families since &nbsp;the 1960&#039;s &nbsp;had nothing to do with the &#039;Free&#039; love movement? Maybe, you should face reality and stopping glorifying and seeing no wrong with the 60&#039;s &nbsp;past, just cause some good came out of the &#039;movement.&#039; Just because media is &#039;non-corporate&#039; doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s accurate. I acknowledged &nbsp;that some good came out of the era, but, alot of bad is connected to what was advocated. Broken families are families where the state &nbsp;takes &nbsp;over for &#039;daddy&#039;, and that was mainly due to the fact that many did not see the responsibility attached to &#039;Free&#039; love. Same with drugs. I&#039;m not attacking &#039;single parents.&#039; <br /><br />France wanted &nbsp;&#039;nothing to do&#039; with removing Saddam, cause &nbsp;they &nbsp;and the &quot;Peace&quot; coalition of Germany, Russia and &nbsp; China, were cutting deals with Saddam and they wanted him sanctionless, while &nbsp;we were in the region. So, you believe kowtowing to Al Qeada&#039;s demands to &#039;leave &nbsp;the region&#039; if you are &#039;Non-Muslim&#039; is &nbsp;the way the Peace? I don&#039;t understand the logic of waiting for &nbsp;a fascist movement to &nbsp;magically &nbsp;change, without any outside influence, it was this kind of thinking that led to the rise of Hitler, Stalin, and will get us into a much larger war. I know people who have lost Son&#039;s and Fathers in this &nbsp;conflict and Muslims, here, and elsewhere in the Western world who are seeking &nbsp;the support of the Free world. Otherwise there is no reason for Free nations to even exist, if it&#039;s only to sit in isolation. &nbsp;<br /><br />The 60&#039;s movement wanted &nbsp;to change the world, it did, but, not all of it was good, and some highly destructive. You can try to say I am ignorant, but, &nbsp;your views speak of someone still living in idealistic &nbsp;fantasy &nbsp;of an era, when looked back in sober hindsight, wil acknowledge it was not all that great. <br /><br />I didn&#039;t say anything bad about Abbie, matter of fact, I thought I was being quite nice about him, even tyhough I didn&#039;t agree with many of his views, that I have read. &nbsp;I believe I gave a very moderate &nbsp;view, thought we could have a conversation, but, I won&#039;t be brow beaten, this &#039;ain&#039;t the 60&#039;s &nbsp;anymore, and I won&#039;t be sitting to get hit in the head as well, by someone, just cause they were there and see the contributions of the 60&#039;s &nbsp;radicals, as sunshine and rainbows. I would say some of your views are highly extreme, and incorrect.

The deaths of&nbsp; millions&nbsp; by abortion is as heartfelt by anti-abortionists, and no less radical, than the Animal Rights and Enviro groups&nbsp; out the Pacific North West which have caused&nbsp; tens&nbsp; of millions in property damage, and only through a miracle, have not killed&nbsp; construction workers. <br /><br />BTW, Isn&#039;t Timothy Leary &#039;Dead?&#039;&nbsp; :lol:&nbsp; Dennis Leary had&nbsp; a&nbsp; song about an @$$#ole soem years&nbsp; back, maybe, he ran across some &#039;tolerant&#039;&nbsp; Leftists who realy are not that tolerant, unless everyone agree and walks in lockstep.

Other people believe that, no matter what the reason, this kind of violence is never justified.<br />&quot;Do you personally feel that this kind of violence is often justified to defend Islam, sometimes justified, rarely justified or never justified?&quot;<br />That percentage they threw out encompasses often, sometimes and rarely. That means one person could have said often, or ninety. That also means 99% of the people asked that question could have said rarely- which speaks to me about the impartiality of the article, among other discrepancies. <br />Additionally, a sampling poll of 1,000 hardly can give an accurate representation of Muslim views, particularly because I find it impossible to believe that a survey asking this question in the first place picked an objective sampling of Muslims. <br /><br />Also, how could that question be relevant when we live in a country that invaded Iraq with a civilian &quot;Collateral Damage&quot; death count estimated anywhere between 60,000 and 100,000. <br />If we asked the question to Americans &quot;is it rarely, sometimes, or often justified to have that type of civilian loss in a war&quot;, I guarantee you that number is higher than 13% answering rarely, sometimes, or often.

Also, we have to demand, just like the sanctions and socio-political boycott of&nbsp; &#039;Sun City&#039; and South Africa, that if they want to continue and be part of the community of nations, they have to allow more freedom, religion, women&#039;s&nbsp; rights&#039;.. etc.. It&#039;s not all Military by any stretch. Muslims folks, are like any other folks, problem is they have been &#039;secluded&#039; for centuries&nbsp; for a myriad of reasons, from their&nbsp; &#039;Kingdoms&#039;, which was &#039;convenient&#039; for people who wanted&nbsp; the Oil, and from the Imam&#039;s, who gain power by keeping their people&nbsp; down, women as second class citizens. If Obama&nbsp; wins, he will find he can&#039;t just walk away, like many who are voting for him are lead&nbsp; to believe. He has modified&nbsp; as he see&#039;s&nbsp; more &#039;intelligence&#039; , and as it gets much better&nbsp; than what Bush had after 9/11.

I think this is a problem with NYC in general.<br /><br />I always thought the rednecks I grew up next to were crazy when they said people in the cities had no idea what their life was like or what their values and hopes and ideals were. Unfortunately, they were right. The cities view rural America with the same kinds of misconceptions that rural Americans view city folk or that foreigners view a country with.<br /><br />This American Life (the TV show on Showtime) recently did a great segment where they followed an Iraqi around the country talking to lots of people. While some of the hicks did a diservice to the image of America, you&#039;d be surprised at how many of them were shockingly kind, understanding and sincere (especially the ones from military families or serving themselves).<br /><br />Okay, sorry for the offtopic aside.

				More&nbsp; &#039;right-wing lies&#039;&nbsp; from a&nbsp; a Muslim &#039;hater&#039;.. Oh Wait?&nbsp; :-D :mrgreen:<br /><br />Call radical Islam by its name <br />BY TAWFIK HAMID <br /><br />Monday, May 19th 2008, 4:00 AM <br /><br />Recently, the Bush administration opened up a sad new front in the war on terrorism: a battle against words. Yes, the federal government has begun a concerted effort to make certain terms effectively off-limits in official communications. It&#039;s all included in a new memo prepared by the Extremist Messaging Branch of the National Counter Terrorism Center, called &quot;Words that Work and Words that Don&#039;t: A Guide for Counterterrorism Communication.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s not what you say but what they hear,&quot; says the memo, in bold, italic lettering.<br /><br />Among the verboten (or think-twice-before-you-say-them) words: &quot;Jihadist&quot; and &quot;Mujahedeen&quot; (which should be replaced by &quot;violent extremist&quot; or &quot;terrorist&quot;) and &quot;Islamo-fascism.&quot;<br /><br />In the eyes of the feds, the use of such terminology boosts support for radicals by giving them an air of religious credibility, and turning off moderate Muslims who might otherwise sympathize with our anti-terror cause.<br /><br />As a Muslim reformer - who once counted himself among the world&#039;s Islamists and jihadists before turning away from terrorism and toward liberalism - I consider this a tragically flawed understanding of the war on terrorism in which we are now engaged.<br /><br />The real way to strengthen moderate Muslims in their fight against the radicals is to spotlight radical teachings and flush out those who believe in them. <br /><br />Among the most important qualities of any professional are honesty, objectivity and forthrightness - the ability to determine and present facts as they are, irrespective of the preconceived notions of any particular audience. <br /><br />This is especially true in war: define your enemy correctly, and you will rally legitimate allies to your side. Blur what a battle is about and, stuck in the muddle, you are bound to lose.<br /><br />Yes, the word &quot;jihad&quot; has several, including some peaceful, meanings - but that doesn&#039;t change the fact that most authoritative Islamic texts and systems of jurisprudence maintain that its primary meaning is &quot;warfare to subjugate the world to Islam.&quot; Closely allied with this predominant concept of jihad is the threefold choice given to infidels: conversion, submission and tribute or death. And it is simply a fact that jihad, as taught by Sunni Islam&#039;s four schools of jurisprudence, is either a war to defend Muslims or to impose Islam on non-Muslims.<br /><br />It may be uncomfortable to admit these facts - and doing so may run certain risks. But it is true, and the costs of ignoring reality are far higher than the benefits of glossing over it.<br /><br />Islamists are not waiting for &quot;infidel&quot; Americans to define jihad for them; they defined it themselves, a very long time ago. If Muslim leaders wish to insist that the word refers primarily to a peaceful struggle against the self, they have that option. Let them clearly and publicly denounce the current doctrine and establish a new one. That&#039;s the answer - not redefining reality.<br /><br />Where does the word game end? Should we also stop calling militant organizations - such as Egypt&#039;s &quot;Islamic Jihad&quot; - by their own chosen names?<br /><br />The movie &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; may have put it best: &quot;The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn&#039;t exist.&quot; <br /><br />One of the most devious tactics used by the Islamists is scaring their enemy out of speaking the plain truth about this virulent strain of Islam, for fear it might alienate or offend millions of moderate Muslims. But this ensures that no one will directly confront their violent ideologies and the books that contain them - since, under Islamic Sharia law, no one is even allowed to challenge their contents.<br /><br />Calling angina a &quot;common cold&quot; does not change its nature. It only prevents us from taking the necessary steps in treating it, which will only lead to further sickness, and possibly death. <br /><br />Playing word games with jihadists is not only meaningless, but plays right into the hands of the radical Muslim terrorists - who, to be defeated, must first be called by their true name.<br /><br />Hamid, a onetime member of Jemaah Islamiya, an Islamist terrorist group, is a medical doctor and Muslim reformer living in the West.<br /><br /><br /><br />http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2008/05/19/2008-05-19_call_radical_islam_by_its_name.html <br />
