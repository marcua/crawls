				Things do not look good for the Korean Dunkin Donuts - first the reduction in hours (which lasted two days) and now the Closed sign has been up ever since. <br /><br /><br />Kudos to O.K. Cafe for thriving on the coffee corner.

				Café Bene never felt welcoming to me.&nbsp; Walked in twice to try it and walked right out both times, after purchasing nothing.&nbsp; OK Café is a great addition to the neighborhood.&nbsp; Now if an actual Korean BBQ opened in that space, I&#039;d be happy.&nbsp; Enough coffee.

				I noticed another Caffee Bene (on 23rd st in Manhattan) was all closed and emptied-out. I don&#039;t think it had been there that long. Curious how the chain is doing as a whole in the city. I wanted to like it, but something about it is just &#039;off&#039; to me.

People seem to enjoy conspicuous consumption. Compare the prices of Tradefair in Astoria and Woodside with those in other parts of Queens for example. Here prices are considerably higher. Why? Because nouveau Astorians enjoy buying wafcos and other things at a premium so they can pretend that they live in Brooklyn or Manhatten. The rest of us suffer because of it.
