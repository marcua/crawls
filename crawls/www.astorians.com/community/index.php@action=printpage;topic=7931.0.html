				We&#039;re currently considering changing the Astoria Dads&#039; Group (on meetup.com) to an Astoria Families Group, which could still have Dad Only events, as well as Mom Only, Dad &amp; Kids, Mom &amp; Kids, etc.<br /><br />Just trying to gauge some interest and see if this is something people might want.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s been mentioned here before by someone that they&#039;d like to see this as opposed to the segregated parent groups.

				that&#039;s ridiculous.<br /><br />I will have to check with them.<br /><br />I do know that they only want each family to have only one &quot;membership&quot;&nbsp; so if your wife/ baby mama already signed on they won&#039;t let a second from same family.<br /><br />

				Well, I switched the Dad&#039;s Group over, so if anyone wants to join, it&#039;s at http://parents.meetup.com/65/ (http://parents.meetup.com/65/).&nbsp; I think that link should work for you.

				Your dads group sounds nice, the stay at home mothers group is full of a bunch of bourgeoisie cliquey women who can&#039;t wait to look down their noses at other peoples children, get a life it&#039;s <span class="bbc_u">suppose</span> to be about the child on child interaction I thought.

				Hello!<br /><br />Saw that this group is now closed - can anyone recommend other groups?<br /><br />We&#039;re working parents (opera singer &amp; actress-turned-finance)&nbsp; to a 2 year old girl and live near the beer garden.

				I have a 2 year old girl and live by the beer garden, too!&nbsp; I&#039;ve got a 3 month old boy, too. <br /><br />I started a Google Group, but I think only one other person ever joined it.&nbsp; Would be great if it started up, though.<br /><br />Feel free to post meetup type things here and I&#039;m sure you&#039;d find some takers.&nbsp; Sunday at the Beer Garden is great for kids!

				My wife is expecting in February and I would love to join one of these groups at that time....we don&#039;t have any friends with children in Astoria, so I&#039;m starting to feel somewhat isolated and nervous about the whole thing. Having some local people to talk to re: all the changes and challenges soon to occur in our life would be great!

				We are expecting in April, and likewise a bit nervous because we don&#039;t know where to find other new parents. This looks like a great group. There is also a good thread here: <br /><br />http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=10433.msg127633#msg127633<br /><br />

				FYI:&nbsp; There&#039;s a new group astoriafamilies.org.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a mom/dad or even any particular type of parent group.&nbsp; It&#039;s for all families raising children (0-18 yrs old) in astoria.&nbsp; Feel free to post information about your group on astoriafamilies.org.&nbsp; Also, anyone who is a member of astoriafamilies can post events on the calendar.&nbsp; Best of luck with the change in your group.<br />

				I just applied to astoriafamilies.org (membership is pending).&nbsp; But I would love to join an Astoria Dad&#039;s group.&nbsp; I would hope it would turn into something like the &quot;He Man&quot; club on the old &quot;Married with Children&quot; TV Show.&nbsp; Just a group of guys comiserating over how thier wives won&#039;t leave them in peace to watch football (or in my case, to go play hockey).
