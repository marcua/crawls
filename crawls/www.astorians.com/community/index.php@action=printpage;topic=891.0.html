				I've heard nothing good about the dentists in that area, and my own experience is, well, it's why I don't go to any local dentists.<br /><br />I can't remember the name, but the office is on Ditmars near the Dunkin' Donuts. Husband and wife practice (I believe, since they share the same Greek surname).<br /><br />I went for a routine cleaning back in 2004 which was the worst job I'd ever seen. First of all, the dentist kept pushing me to buy this teeth cleaning widget, and mentioned that there's a coupon if you say you're from Dr. So-and-so. Smelled like a kick-back to me so I'm already thinking this guy's up to something.<br /><br />Then he tells me that I have THREE cavities that need to be filled. I've not had a cavity since I was a teenager and I take very good care of my teeth. I was already skeptical b/c of him trying to convince me to buy this electric toothbrush or some sort. Also, I was unemployed at the time and not too keen on spending my meagre $$ on dentistry. Besides, my teeth felt fine -- no ache with cold or hot foods.<br /><br />I decided I needed a second opinion and never bothered to follow up on the filling appointment. I also thought he did a rush job cleaning my teeth -- when I looked at the choppers in the mirror at home afterwards, he clearly did not do a thorough job at all. I could have done better. <br /><br />After my not-so-good experience with the local dentist, I asked my landlord for recommendations. He said another dentist on Ditmars really screwed up his dental work. He and his family go to Dr. Weschler (Wexler, Drexler???) on Cresent St. whom he recommended highly. I never got to try out this one b/c he wasn't taking new patients. Which is usually a good sign.<br /><br />I since reentered the workforce and got a good dental plan again. As it turned out, I asked my new dentist here in the city (who is awesome, btw) whether he thought I needed fillings. &quot;Your teeth are in great shape,&quot; he said.

				Yes, it's frustrating. &nbsp;So many dentists in Astoria, and you don't know who the good ones are.<br /><br />When all else fails, contact the Queens County Dental Society. &nbsp;That's how I found my dentist. &nbsp;Are you willing to go south of Broadway?

				Has anybody tried Park Dental's new Ditmars location? I used them when I broke a tooth when they were at the office that burned ( over the Pharmacy on 31 St, and their older Steinway location.) They were okay, I don't know if they will take my new dental plan though.

				My husband goes to the one on 31st near Ditmars, up the stairs, next door or nearly so to the new Coldstone Creamery or whatever they're called. &nbsp;I think he's been pretty well satisfied, but I'll double check and let you know if that's not the case.<br /><br />Ok - it's Dr. Kubsky (phonetic spelling), and he would recommend him.<br /><br />Me, I've stuck with my Park Slope dentist, Dr. Sabbione. &nbsp;I can't recommend him highly enough. &nbsp; :D

				I'd like dentist recommendations as well. I'm so afraid of getting a bad dentist that I haven't gone to any since I've been here. &nbsp;:oops: I'll look into the ones you guys have already mentioned, but any other success/horror stories would be excellent as well.

				In that case, essen, I'll recommend my dentist:<br /><br />Blumenthal, Cary DDS - Blumenthal &amp; Assoc <br />Address: &nbsp; 3447 21st St, Long Island City, NY 11106 &nbsp;<br />Phone: (718) 786-8667 <br /><br />They're a two-brother practice, Cary and Peter. &nbsp;(They used to be a father-and-two-sons practice but the father retired.) &nbsp;My dentist is Peter and he is excellent at fixing teeth, but Cary has the better chairside manner. &nbsp;(They cover for each other.) &nbsp;If one isn't taking new patients the other probably will.<br /><br />I've never known them to offer nitrous oxide, but you can ask.<br /><br />They take most insurance plans but alas, they take DC-37 only for routine work. &nbsp;They take credit cards if you have to pay out of pocket. &nbsp;And if you're worried about going to a shill for a product, they've never pushed anything on me (OK, Dr. Peter once recommended Sensodyne for sensitive teeth, and now there are many desensitizing toothpastes, but 1) Sensodyne was about the only desensitizing toothpaste at the time he recommended it, and 2) the name Sensodyne has acquired quasi-generic status, like Band-Aid and Walkman. &nbsp;If I'm ever about to buy a desensitizing toothpaste I'll ask him about his use of the name.)<br /><br />It's the dental clinic at the edge of the Ravenswood Houses, with the big blue awning.
