				The last month or so, there have been a series of art exhibits at the Buzzeo space on 36th Ave. near 31st. Has anyone had a chance to look in on this and find out what&#039;s going on? Is the space going to be used as a permanent gallery space? If so, pretty cool!

				I saw the art gallery before I left.&nbsp; It was a good idea to let artists use the space!&nbsp; <br /><br />If you remember, Buzzeo&#039;s prepared food for Meals on Wheels at the location.&nbsp; It was great because they employed people from the neighborhood to deliver the meals and work in the kitchen.&nbsp; Before he got that contract, Buzzeo used to have a catering business and a very small, perhaps only three table restaurant that served incredible Italian food.&nbsp; If I&#039;m not mistaken, I believe Buzzeo was Koch&#039;s chef when he was the mayor.&nbsp; I know he has a lot of political connections.&nbsp; Sorry for veering off-topic; I love discussing 36th Ave!&nbsp; :-)

				I stopped in a few weeks ago on my way home from work. There was a reception going on for two different artists, and I am embarrassed to say I can&#039;t remember the names of either...&nbsp; It was a really nice reception stocked with lots of good food, wine, and coffee, and the space was pretty decent for showing work as well.&nbsp; I normally would have stayed much longer but I was in a hurry to get home from work (as it was Saturday.)&nbsp; But I live on 34th right there at 36th Ave, and I am stoked to have a new gallery so close to home!
