			<strong>Eddie.K</strong>:

			My daughter and niece were looking for 2 BR apt.&nbsp; &nbsp;They concentrated on Craigslist, etc.,&nbsp; while I touched base with a few brokers.<br /><br /><br />John Kalamaris at at http://www.metrolinerealty.com&nbsp; and Peter Horowitz athttp://myastoriarealestate.com were both responsive and helpful.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can&#039;t recommend Mary Aidonis - she was sorta rude and dismissive, it felt like rentals were more of a sideline with her.&nbsp; Although, she gets high marks for responsiveness.<br /><br />Anyways, happy ending!&nbsp; The girls found perfect no-fee unit on Craigslist.&nbsp; &nbsp;They are ecstatic!!

			only advice I can give anyone is to stay away from Astoria Home Realty on 38th and 31st<br /><br /><br />http://www.yelp.com/biz/astoria-home-realty-queens-2<br /><br /><br />Just have a read! <br /><br /><br />They have scammed friends of mine and left them with virtually nothing. Disgraceful.
