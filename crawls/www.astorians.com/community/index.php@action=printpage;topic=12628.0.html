				Wow, I know Oceano is the latest incarnation on the &quot;cursed corner&quot; and all, but I was especially amazed while driving between the two places last evening: Oceano had one couple inside the whole restaurant that I could see. Kyclades was more crowded than I&#039;ve ever seen, with the crowd on the sidewalk the biggest I&#039;ve ever noticed.<br /><br />I think they need to hire a priest or a shaman or take SOME sort of desperate measures to un-curse that corner. If a big, open seafood restaurant *still* can&#039;t draw a few people from an overcrowded seafood place directly across the street... are they really that bad? that expensive?<br /><br />The BF says Oceano needs to run some specials to start with. That might help lift the curse.

				There are some other threads somewhere about Oceano and the issues that it was having when it opened.... My memory isn&#039;t iron clad but i think I remember posts expressing that in the menu creation, they didn&#039;t have a real clear idea of what type of cuisine they were trying to serve... (Are they mediterranean, are they spanish, what are they serving?) And I think there were a couple of posts from annoyed staff members as well.&nbsp; I, myself, have never been there but I do know that there are previous posts discussing Oceano, but don&#039;t know how recent they are.

				Oh I know it&#039;s been discussed before, it was mostly the stark night-and-day difference between the two establishments that struck me. <br /><br />Kyclades has that fresh simplicity; Oceano seems formal in comparison.

				It seems to be one of those situations where, because nobody is in there, nobody wants to go in there. The prices can&#039;t be helping. On the other hand, you&#039;d think that if the food was really good, word would&#039;ve spread by now. Has anyone from this board even tried it?

				I have eaten there once, and it was pretty good. I don&#039;t remember what I had though, so big help, eh?<br /><br />I did have crab cake appetizer which was good but not great (not comparable to the best one can find on the Maryland shore, but better than the norm at tourist places in the same area.)&nbsp; The tartar sauce that came with it was, however, perfect to my tartar sauce sensibility, and better than any I recall in the area.&nbsp; I would go there regularly if I lived close by... it&#039;s a long walk from 30th &amp; 41st where I live, and when we drive, my gf generally has a place in mind.<br /><br />

				Honestly, I just feel so depressed everytime I pass by Oceano.&nbsp; They have that enormous space, and rarely have any customers.&nbsp; I feel badly for the proprietor.&nbsp; The restaurant game is a tough one.

				What must be especially frustrating, is that they must&#039;ve deliberately opened a seafood place in response to seeing the crowd across the street clamoring for seafood. &quot;Wow! There&#039;s a huge demand for fish in this area! Let&#039;s meet that demand!&quot;

				Something to note -- it&#039;s been the same owner through each iteration. I know this because my husband looked at the property after Les Moules failed.

				Hmmmm.........wait, I think I&#039;ve got it: Wall off the seating area so that it&#039;s only 1/4 the size. Make it difficult to get a reservation. Put some red velvet rope up at the entrance and voilà- everybody will want to cram in!

				In my opinion, there is absolutely no comparison between Kyclades and Oceano. <br /><br />One is established with a clientele base and classic, fresh, well prized, consistent Greek cuisine. <br /><br />The other is completely lost and has no clue how to run a restaurant. To begin with – Oceano doesn’t know who they want to be. First it was Latin, then just seafood, now they changed their logo to Mediterranean. Their original menu when they first opened was a mess. You didn’t know what you were looking at.&nbsp; Even though they were pushing Latin food – half of their menu consisted of Greek cuisine. Most likely influenced by a Greek owner. He was running this restaurant like a diner – reflected by décor, menu, server’s uniform, etc. <br /><br />I was very excited when the Latin place opened and went few times, but it felt uncomfortable and the food was mediocre.

				The food at Oceano was tasty enough, but too expensive. And we were pressured repeatedly to spend more, and mocked when we didn&#039;t!<br /><br />When I eat out, I usually just want great food, quickly, and without pretension. Places like Kyclades win TONS of points for those qualities, even though you&#039;ll wait awhile for a table.

				I am also struck by how empty Oceano looks every time I pass it by.&nbsp; The place is way too big and the fact all the rows of empty tables is openly visible from the street doesn&#039;t help.&nbsp; There&#039;s no vibe of coziness or promise of stepping into an experience (however slight).&nbsp; The number of tables is way too optimistic.&nbsp; Why not remove some tables, add plants/other decors whatever that the place does not look too abandoned from outside.&nbsp; You gotta give at least the appearance that there&#039;s demand for that place not be so open that the every customer passing by thinks this place oughta suck or else why would all these tables be empty!
