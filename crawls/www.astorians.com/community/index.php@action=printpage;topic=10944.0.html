				Hi, it has been like a million years since I&#039;ve been on!<br /><br />I am moving from my beloved apartment by month&#039;s end.&nbsp; Given the smaller size of my new place and my hopeful future plans, I have to start shedding my possessions.&nbsp; My combination lack of televsion/social life has left me with a thousand plus book library which I hope the Astori Literati might fancy.<br /><br />After I make a cull for a few which I&#039;ll keep, I&#039;m just opening the doors on Saturday, June 28th.&nbsp; The books will still be in the bookcases, so just come on in and take what you like.&nbsp; There shall also be furniture, glassware and other bric-brac about and anything not specifically labelled is free for the taking.<br /><br />Message me if you have any questions.&nbsp; <br />(Also tip me off if you have any experience or advice on long range backpacking, as well as travelling in Italy.&nbsp; I hope to walk the length of the country and any tips would be greatly appreciated.)

				Thanks Bentley&#039;s Dad for the link.&nbsp; I signed onto their Thorn Tree and have been reading through the posts.&nbsp; Good stuff&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />Biggest areas I need help in is the trekking part.&nbsp; To make my budget stretch, I have to consider camping when possible instead of hostel stays, as well as any other tips that will get me free shelter.&nbsp; Then I need those tips on best hostels/camping areas, trails et cetera in Italy, as well as which cities might be must visits and which others are ho-hum (unbiased opinions are not available in travel guidesa).&nbsp; Best hostel in Rome I found out about through word of mouth while in Athens, never saw it in a book.&nbsp; I&#039;m estimating it&#039;ll take a year to walk from Trieste to Agrigento with appropriate zig zagging.&nbsp; When I backpacked in Europe after grad school, I was amazed and envious at how the Aussies and Kiwis were in the midsts of one, two even three year long trips!&nbsp; I&#039;ve been searching to see who else has done this in Italy, for I know walking the length of Britain and across Spain is an established thing, but have come up with ouvi so far.&nbsp; <br /><br />As for furniture, I have to get an idea of what will be going into the new apartment and then I&#039;ll post a list.<br /><br />I forgot to mention in the last post to PM me for the street address.&nbsp; I&#039;ll send it out now to those on this post so far.<br /><br />Thanks again!

				Good luck on your trip, sounds like it would be a blast. <br /><br />Can you give an idea of your book interests? I&#039;m most interested in history and economics.

				About a third of the books are history, the lions share are histories of Rome, Greece, Europe and America.<br />About a tenth of them are urban/transportation planning books.&nbsp; Mostly subway/rail transport and urban design.<br />About a tenth are biographies.<br />About a quarter are social sciences, philosophy and language<br />The remainder are fiction and general interest (cook books, atlases, photograph books and some Calvin &amp; Hobbes to lighten things up)<br /><br />Also forgot to mention a pretty substantial record collection.&nbsp; Mostly older stuff and musicals.<br /><br />

				Unless it is specifically marked, everything is free for the taking, including the furniture and records.&nbsp; Hopefully I can score a bit of karma for when I tramping about in Italy.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be pretty busy moving that day, however, so folks will need to take care of the transport, which is no mean feat as I am down in Dutch Kills (39th Avenue, a.k.a. Avenue of the New Hotel Constructions).&nbsp; Also, in the case of the Ikea furniture, folks will have to handle the disassembly.&nbsp; I&#039;ll have pictures up of the ikea stuff by early next week and a full list of the furniture.<br /><br />I am also going to post the address next week instead of messaging it out.&nbsp; Figure as I am moving, I&#039;m not so worried about posting the addy publically.<br /><br />

				The address is:<br /><br />27-11 39th Avenue, between 27th and 28th Streets.&nbsp; Use the door at the top of the stoop.&nbsp; Figure we&#039;ll give it a start at 10:00.&nbsp; Naturally, given that it is a move, please pardon the mess of the place.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would suggest bringing backpacks or things to carry the books in.&nbsp; If I have an extra box for you to use I&#039;ll give it up, but I imagine I will not have enough at all.<br /><br />Most of the furniture/extras has been taken up by family, but some items still linger:<br /><br /><strong>Glass outside table. </strong>&nbsp; Round.&nbsp; Seats 4.&nbsp; Glass top, white wicker legs and bottom.&nbsp; Comes with four brightly colored chairs and a a very large umbrella which goes int he middle.<br /><br /><strong>free standing bar. </strong>&nbsp; Dark wood finish with footrail and has an inside shelf to put things.&nbsp; Its not super fancy, its just a straightforward bar which you might expect to see in an old man bar.&nbsp; Also comes with a two barstools, bacardi bar service mats (two of the long thin ones as well as one large square one) as well as a 6 container drink garnish holders (for your cherries, lemons, pearled onions, et cetera).&nbsp; This bar I was going to sell but the bloke who was going to take it got nixed by his better half.&nbsp; This item we can negotiate a price on.&nbsp; I will be able to transport this item to your location on saturday as long as you are in the general Astoria/LIC area.<br /><br /><strong>Punching bag.</strong>&nbsp; Its the type which you fill up the base with water, so it does not have to be hung from the wall.&nbsp; I also have a medicine ball to go with that.<br /><br /><strong>Glass display case.</strong>&nbsp; This I used to sell dog treats out of during the holiday market.&nbsp; Its got a sloped front, tri leveled with a sliding glass doors which allow the person behind to access the contents.&nbsp; Its about 36&quot; wide, 18&quot; deep and 24&quot; high.<br /><br /><strong>Movie projection screen.</strong>&nbsp; It was made in the 50&#039;s.&nbsp; Old school.&nbsp; Pretty neat.<br /><br />I&#039;m also going to have out a whole bunch of minor things.&nbsp; Assorted glassware and plates, computer cable wires.&nbsp; Odd tools and what not.&nbsp;

				Hey, I might be interested in the bar, but I&#039;ll have to take a look at it and do some looking at my apartment.<br /><br />Also, you should check out www.couchsurfing.com It&#039;s a website designed to help world wide travelers use couches and other travelers to help you check the place out. They go through a pretty decent verification process and can help you find free placese to stay. My user name there is the same as my user name here and I can give you positive points and such. You should at least take a look around there. <br /><br />Good luck on your travels!

				Cool.<br /><br />The bar is about 48 inches high and is large enough for two people to comfortably stand in front of it and two behind it as well.<br /><br />Also forgot to mention, I have a ton of doggie clothing.&nbsp; Jackets, coats, tank tops, tee shirts.&nbsp; Most of it is of the Ruffluv Style.<br />http://www.ruffluvnyc.com/<br /><br />I also have doggie plush toys, mostly of the christmas/hanukah variety<br /><br />

				I&#039;m definitely coming for the books, well at least some of them, and, if it is free, that outside table. Otherwise just books, books and more books. Looking forward to it.
