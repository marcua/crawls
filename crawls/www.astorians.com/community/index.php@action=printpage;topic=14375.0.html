				This winter has been brutal. I guess I have been spoiled by the relatively mild winters we&#039;ve had for the past 4 years or so.<br /><br />On the bright side, at least it&#039;s not sticking, but those sure are some huge clumpy flakes.

				Actually it has been an average of 4-5 degrees below average in temperature for each month from Nov - Feb this winter, so yes it has been an unusually cold winter. I for one am glad to finally see Spring arrive.

				Usually by February I can&#039;t take it anymore. This winter did seem even more brutal for some reason- I didn&#039;t even want to leave the house for ANYthing.

				Happy Spring, Everyone!<br /><br />I didn&#039;t think the winter was bad.&nbsp; I remember just a few years ago having to walk my way over snow-turned-to-ice sidewalk that never gets cleared, near where I work.&nbsp; I remember from other years standing in that condition waiting for the bus and my feet freezing through my boots.&nbsp; Years of endless wind.&nbsp; Snow deep to walk in, that you had to crawl over to cross the corner.&nbsp; Nope, this winter was not bad in comparrison.&nbsp; But I sure am glad it&#039;s SPRING!

It&#039;s been abnormally cold on a regular basis this past winter. We didn&#039;t have nearly as much snow as what is seasonally typical, but that&#039;s more than likely because it was way too cold to snow -- it has to be much warmer than teens to allow snow to form.<br /><br />But either way, brutal winter or not, I&#039;m glad that we have once again shifted back towards the sun and the sunlight is once again yellow and inviting, instead of the cold blue-white sunlight of winter. Yay for Vitamin D inducing sunlight!! :mrgreen:<br />

				I was done with winter shortly after December.&nbsp; Winter is my least favorite season and it always lasts interminably long.&nbsp; I&#039;m a sun girl who happens to love living in new york, so I find it hard to move.&nbsp; But as someone who&#039;s lived here a long time, this particular winter was colder and with more snow than the last three at least.&nbsp; The ice storms were awful and I hated walking the long ten minute walk to the train in the mornings and at night because I feared slipping and falling all the time.&nbsp; Winter was really bad for much of the US, and I think it&#039;s one of the worst on record.&nbsp; I am happy to say goodbye to it and hello to spring, which means warm sunshine rays and pretty flowers and baby birds.&nbsp; I will be a happy camper and no longer feel like a hermit because when I work at home and need every excuse to leave the apartment.
