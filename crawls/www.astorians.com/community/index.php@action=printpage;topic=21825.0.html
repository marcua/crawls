				JADA KISS @ SYSTEM NY w/ DJ SHORT KUTZ and KAST ONE <br />Thursday October 20th 2011<br />REVIVAL THURSDAYS at SYSTEM DANCE CLUB<br />JADA KISS [live]<br />with Music by<br />DJ Shortkutz &amp; DJ Kast One<br />Doors at 11pm<br />Ladies - No Cover All Night<br />Groups of 5 or More Ladies Receive a Complimentary Bottle of Vodka before Midnight<br />&nbsp;<br />(http://systemny.com/images/Jerry_B_Revival_Thursdays_Oct_20_JADA_KISS_System_A.jpg)<br />JADA KISS[Live Performance]<br />Music by<br />DJ SHORTKUTZ and DJ KAST ONE<br />Opening Set by DJ Vidal<br />Become part of &quot;Revival” every Thursday at System Dance Club, home to some of the industry’s most captivating turntabilists. Revive your drab Thursdays while bottle-popping among New York City’s most eligible fashionistas. Try not to get lost as the SYSTEM captures you and tosses you into a world of wild, instinctive dance fuss.<br />JADA KISS<br />Jadakiss has earned this. When you litter two decades of hip-hop with landmark verses, when you roll with some of the most formidable crews to ever huddle up in the rap game and still make a name for yourself as a solo artist, when your talent is so internationally known you can hold it down in any area code, when you’ve been in the game as long as he has and still sound as fresh to death as he does, when you’ve rocked the stage with Biggie and held your own, then…and only then…can you name your album Kiss My Ass.<br />DJ SHORTKUTZ<br />New York based DJ Shortkutz has been an aspiring artist in the music industry for 14 years. He has rocked performances at the hottest clubs in New York, the tri-state area, South Beach, Las Vegas, St. Maarteen, Netherlands Antilles and as far across the Atlantic as Cape Town, South Africa. He started out performing at various local clubs in Westchester County. Shortly after decided it was time to enter some of the city’s most well known mega clubs. Spinning records at Club Exit, Sound Factory, Crobar, Lotus, Providence, Suede, and the list goes on. At 28 years of age Shortkutz is full of energy and talent. Known for tearing up dance floors and hyping crowds. Not limited to live performances, DJ Shortkutz has also appeared in music videos and made private appearances and guest performances for events and parties across the country.<br />DJ KAST ONE<br />Although lately he has been keeping busy while doing numerous parties, sometimes 2 3 per night, and traveling, Kast One has still managed to maintain a healthy profile on the airwaves. He has recently landed a spot as an on air mixer on New York Citys famed radio station HOT 97. Kast One is also a co-host/dj of a weekly show on Sirius Satellite radio channel Shade 45 called The Gomez Brothers, which airs every Saturday afternoon at 5p.m.<br /><br />SYSTEM DANCE CLUB<br />www.systemny.com (http://www.systemny.com/)<br />718.361.8155<br />32-10 37th Avenue<br />Long Island City, Queens, NY 11101
