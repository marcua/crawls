				Ive been dealing with lots of customer service recently for my new business space.&nbsp; Why why why do they waste so much time with useless talk?&nbsp; Its part of this whole new &quot;how can we serve you&quot; crap campaign. <br /><br />You call to get info on something with their service and half the call is them asking:<br />what they can do to beter serve you<br />how can they be of assistance over and above what they are already helping you out on<br />now that we have provided you the requested info what else can we do for you<br />do yuou feel that I have provided you with superior service and what else can i do for you<br /><br />Just today one rep said to me: I will be placing you on hold to connect you with the proper dept. here is the dept&#39;s # just in case you get disconnected. If you are disconnected let me apologize in advance and tell you that it is not our intention to disconnect you. We pride ourselves on good customer service and would never want to disconnect you and provide bad customer service... this went on and on.&nbsp; <br /><br />Wouldnt it be better if they just provided help and requested info immediately, thanked you for the call and hung up?&nbsp; I dont want to talk with them, I dont want to waste my time chatting with them about the weather, war or how they have never been to ny and its so different where there are in Kansas.<br /><br />Just want to yell at them to shut up, shut up and say good bye.&nbsp; Even worse is you dont want to be rude when someone is smiling at you through the phone and thanking you for speaking with them today but ARGHHHH, enough already.<br /><br /><br />Thank you all for this ranting space.&nbsp; I feel better now.&nbsp; God bless America.

				I always feel that they are reading from scripts - weird how talking to another human being can be so alienating, right?

				Sorry about that, Jonathan.&nbsp; Customer Service folks always seem to never really resolve problems and just move you around until you give up.&nbsp; I&#39;ve even been trying email lately, mainly with Verizon, and they take two days to respond (at which point I&#39;ve generally solved the problem myself).&nbsp; Their emails usually raise my blood pressure a notch or two.

				Dirk, sorry for your troubles.&nbsp; I will say that I was mainly speaking of Amex, staples, office max, and Verizon but they were fast and efficient with solving my issues. Unfortunately instead of letting get off the phone quickly and satisfied, they went on and on with positive comments and my previous quotes.<br /><br />Con ed believe it or not was fast and efficient with nothing more than a &quot; thank you for the call and have a nice day&quot;&nbsp; 123 and off the phone!

				Sprint does this to me all the time.&nbsp; Are you 100% satisfied with our service today?&nbsp; Well, actually, no but thanks for asking.<br /><br />And nothing&#39;s worse than having to speak into the phone to NOBODY to get them to direct your call to the right department.&nbsp; What happened to pressing buttons?&nbsp; And it never seems to end, and sometimes the system hangs up on you in the process.&nbsp; I get so annoyed anymore that I just scream Operator!&nbsp; into the phone, in order to talk to a human being.<br /><br />And you all know my myspace rant.&nbsp; No customer service at all.&nbsp; I could add match.com to that list too.&nbsp; But I won&#39;t get into it.

				Don&#039;t forget to ask your customer service rep where they are located. They won&#039;t give you their exact address, but with Verizon, i&#039;ve spoken to a customer service rep out of state and with larger companies, your customer service might even by in India (as is the case with SBC Yahoo for example)<br /><br />:)<br /><br />of course, I still think Daisy has the worst case example of &quot;lack of customer service&quot; with her myspace story.

				Con Ed was good?&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp; That&#39;s a surprise, but before the blackout I was almost always happy with them, so maybe I shouldn&#39;t be surprised.&nbsp; I&#39;ve had very good experiences with AmEx myself.&nbsp; They&#39;re pretty friendly and efficient.
