				some of the tricks to getting around wheel locks are to spot-weld a bolt head onto the lock so that a normal socket will work to get the bolt out, or to hammer a slightly smaller socket over top of the lock and use a breaker bar to work it loose.<br /><br />spot welding can be easily and quickly done with the right equipment, but it&#039;s very conspicuous if seen by someone, as is the noise made by having to hammer a socket over the lock.&nbsp; wheel locks + parking in a well lit and/or populated area might help deter thieves from taking the extra time/work and move on to an easier target, but it&#039;s no guarantee either.&nbsp; if they really want your wheels, they will get them.

				not sure i understand your question.&nbsp; wheel locks come with a key.&nbsp; that key is used to either remove the lock and expose the standard bolt, or to insert into the &quot;lock&quot; portion of the bolt which creates a standard bolt head that can be removed with a typical socket.<br /><br />if you have the key, then when you get a flat, use it to properly remove the bolts and change your tire.&nbsp; if you&#039;re at a shop, then give the key to the mechanic so that they can do the work.<br /><br />now, if you loose the key, then you&#039;ll probably end up using a method similar to what I posted previously.

				I&#039;ve been hearing so much about tires being stolen, I&#039;m wondering if there has also been a rise in car break ins? I live off ditmars and my car was broken into a few weeks back. As upset as i was, I almost want to thank the a-holes for not breaking the window. They pried the top of the door open with what i&#039;m assuming was a crowbar, and i was able to get it easily fixed. What i found most odd was that my driver seat was pushed all the way back. Not sure why. They took my GPS (hand-me-down) and for some reason my hookah. I&#039;ll have to admit it was a pretty nice hookah in a case. Luckily, they left the newly acquired vinyl collection alone! It&#039;s a shame because it happened on a nice quite street i park every day. But, its probably easier to break into a car when no one is around rather than in a more metropolitan area.
