				Was running a Google search on my new apartment&#039;s management company, and boy am I glad that I found this forum! Nice to meet everyone :) I would like to apologize beforehand if my questions has been asked before!<br /><br />I just moved to Astoria after two horrible years of rent hikes and an awful landlord in Manhattan, and signed a lease with Aris Crescent LLC (they own the building block on Crescent between 21st and Ditmars). The buildings are &quot;rent-stabilized&quot; (whatever that means these days!), and my &quot;preferential rent&quot; is about $300 less than the actual legal rent amount.<br /><br />What I&#039;m wondering is, does anyone here, or know anyone who&#039;s had any experience with Aris Crescent? Also to those of you here who live in rent-stabilized buildings and pay &quot;preferential rent&quot;, what&#039;s the rent-hike like upon the renewal of the lease?<br /><br />Thanks much!!

				Welcome three99,<br /><br />To answer your first inquiry, I have no idea about Aris Crescent LLC.&nbsp; Recently, I had to move from one part of Long Island City to another because my rent went up by $280 a month, based on the preferential rent that you are referring to.&nbsp; My &quot;new&quot; landlord argued that the tenants had been paying such low rents in the past that the old owner was broke and the building was actually losing money every month. <br /><br />Anyway, I have attached three previous message threads regarding preferential rents.&nbsp; I believe that the first thread even mentions Artis Crescent<br /><br />http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=5180.0<br /><br />http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=3583.0<br /><br />http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=1413.0<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				You have no idea what the rent hike will be at the end of the lease.&nbsp; I signed with a preferential of $250 2 years ago.&nbsp; On the first renewal (rent-stabilized) my rent only increased the standard amount.&nbsp; On the most recent renewal, it went up the standard amount and the preferential was reduced to $150.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure next time, it will be eliminated completely, but I&#039;m moving so, I&#039;ll be curious to see what the apartment is listed at...probably no preferential.<br /><br />You should go wander around and talk to other tenants and ask what the history has been if that&#039;s possible and try asking them directly.&nbsp; If they are legitimate and honest, they should tell you what they normally do (take it for what it is though).&nbsp; I&#039;d also suggest you check with the department of Housing website (I&#039;m sure you can search for the link on the board) and enter the property addresses and see what any previous building violations have been and if they are always recurring or fixed on time.

				Hi welcome to the building(s)! I live in an apartment managed by Aris Crescent. I have yet to receive my lease renewal, but its up in the air as to what it will be! My preferential rent is actually 600 less than the regulated rent. I will have to move if they enforce it come Sept.

				Wow thanks for all the suggestions and links! I have tried talking to the ever so elusive neighbors on my floor, and the one that would talk to me is also a new tenant! She did mention that there are lots of seniors in the complex, so that could mean good things :-) I&#039;ll check those links out right now!

				If it&#039;s rent stabilized and they have been there a long time, they are probably not getting a preferential as the apartments are probably already well-below market rates.&nbsp; Still, it&#039;s worth a chance to ask.
