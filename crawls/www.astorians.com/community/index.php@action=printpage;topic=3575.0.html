And I think its sad/funny that women who aren&#39;t even in a business where looks matter (like acting, modeling, etc) is being judged because she looks &quot;like a freak.&quot; So what if she looks like a freak? And I really hate playing the girl card (because in the ideal world, we&#39;d all be equal), but if she were a guy, her appearance wouldn&#39;t be as much of an issue, and that sucks.<br /><br />Also, geez...its the New York freaking Post. Just a step or two above the Enquirer, in my opinion. Look at the picture of her they published on the cover (not the big one on the website). It must be someone&#39;s job to find the most unflattering pictures of people to publish. And if we&#39;re actually gonna debate her appearance...I think she looked really nice in that photo - but her mouth was in a strange position because she was probably talking when the photo was taken. Its subtle, but it definitely does look like her mouth is about to form a word. Its more obvious that that is what she&#39;s doing on the cover image.<br /><br />Honestly, I don&#39;t know much about her (I&#39;m a new voter in NY, gotta start reading up on this stuff!), so I can&#39;t speak for her character or the issues, but some quick googling reveals that she&#39;s smart and well spoken. But yeah, she totally looked like crap, and that&#39;s the important thing.&nbsp; :idiot:<br /><br />I know, I know, you probably didn&#39;t mean anything by it, and she&#39;s a public figure so maybe she should expect to be a target for scrutiny, but its still pretty crummy.

				She&#39;s smart and well-spoken, but a staunch advocate of the death penalty and she&#39;s all about law and order, little interest in the consumer protection and legal representation of the state, which are the main areas of concern for the AG&#39;s office.&nbsp; Her husband is quite clearly a crook and always getting in legal trouble.&nbsp; Knowing that she has all these skeletons in her closet, you have to wonder why she opted to give up a safe DA position to run for Statewide offices (three so far, Lt. Governor, then U.S. Senate, now Attorney General - two in this cycle alone - I&#39;m waiting to see if she moves over to Comptroller).

				Hey, I&#39;m not judging her, and I&#39;m not agreeing or disagreeing with her politics, I just think she looks weird.&nbsp; I&#39;m not attaching any special importance to that observation - I stand ready to be convinced that she is the best person in the world, or on the other hand, the worst person in the world.&nbsp; I am open to both of those possibilities, and everything in between.&nbsp; If people are going to be judged (and I&#39;m not saying they even should be), it should be according to the &quot;content of their character.&quot;&nbsp; But to continue that train of thought, if I have a dream, it&#39;s going to be a very bad dream if Jeanine Pirro is in it, because frankly, she looks really scary and weird to me.&nbsp; True, what I think looks &quot;weird&quot; is relative to what I think looks &quot;normal,&quot; which is conditioned by my particular experiences in my particular time and place and blah blah blah.&nbsp; Fine.&nbsp; I couldn&#39;t agree more.&nbsp; But since all of our thoughts and judgments are conditioned by those same factors, me saying that I think she looks weird should be no more offensive than me saying that sardines smell bad (somebody obviously thinks that they smell good, if you check out another thread).&nbsp; It&#39;s ok to admit of differences of perception, it&#39;s part of being human.<br /><br />bennyt

				Um, call me crazy, but you are judging her. You say you wouldn&#39;t want to be caught in a dark alley with her because she looks like (in your opinion) a freak.<br /><br />I&#39;m not trying to defend her. I mean, honestly, for all I know, she could be a raging lunatic. Or she could be totally awesome. The point is I have no idea.

				I think Pirro is closer to the worst person in the world than the best, though she&#39;s far from the most egregious politician in NY.&nbsp; She does support a woman&#39;s right to control her own body, and is in favor of hate crime legislation, though she refers to my community as &quot;the gays&quot;, instead of gay men, which semantically speaking puts a lot of people off.

				It&#39;s interesting how physical attractiveness affects views of politicians... Both when people are a little unusual looking (I don&#39;t think Pirro is, it&#39;s just a weird photo), or when they&#39;re really attractive. Say, some of the Kennedys, or Barack Obama, or Gabrielle Giffords (http://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/9/21/175511/700).

				Regardless of whether I like her politics or not, Jeanine Pirro is going throught the exact same scrutiny that Hillary went through with staying with Bill. Yes, her husband&#39;s dealings are questionable and under investigation. But then Hillary and Bill also had some shady real estate dealings that ultimately were not prosecuted but that gave them hell in the media none-the-less.<br />Fact is, this is typical media circus looking at the person&#39;s personal life (who is obviously under a great deal of personal stress) instead of the person&#39;s politics (yes, I know, she was questioned by the US attorney for wire tapping her husband&#39;s phone calls which she says in the end she didn&#39;t do but still, the feminist in me says leave this one alone. if she committed a crime she&#39;ll be convicted)
