				This doesn&#039;t have to be in Astoria.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking to find a bank that doesn&#039;t charge &quot;service fees&quot; for using ATMs from other companies.&nbsp; I&#039;m fine paying the ATM fee itself but I am sick of also paying my bank for using my card elsewhere.

				If you have a certain amount in the bank, there are types of checking accounts with HSBC that waive the fees.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard Commerce refunds you $5, but I have no idea if this is still true.&nbsp; A friend of mine told me they stopped refunding her, but that could have just been a problem with her account.

				Commerce doesn&#039;t charge you to use other banks at all.<br />If you carry a balance of $2000 they will reimburse you. Under 2K the other bank&#039;s charge sticks. But that has to be your average daily balance-not the balance the day you do it.<br />As far as i know they still do this, but i try to use my debit card to avoid trips to the bank, and also try to hit up the bank atm on steinway or the one near my office if i am in need of cash.<br />I actually used another atm the other day, so i&#039;ll know pretty soon if they still refund the charge since i got my tax refund and i hit the magic number.

(Although I see some people have suggestions for accounts that require a large minimum balance.) You might be better off trying to find the other way around. I bank through a credit union. They charge $1 for all outside-the-network transactions (the CU is in central Illinois, so I don&#039;t make any inside-the-network transactions anymore), but they&#039;re on the &quot;Co-op Network&quot; of ATMs, and so as long as I can find such an ATM, I know I&#039;m just paying $1, and not $1.75 or $2.50 or whatever other ridiculous ATM fee there might be. And all credit union ATMs are on that network, as well as all of the ATMs in McDonald&#039;s restaurants! If anyone sees me ducking into a McDonalds, it&#039;s to use their ATM, not to ruin my foodie cred. :) <br /><br />

				When I lived in WI the University CU didn&#039;t charge fees on top of the machine fee, which was pretty much awesome.&nbsp; Machine fees don&#039;t really bother me but the secondary fee is bullshit.

				Not sure if you can find one, but what has worked for me is to find a bank that has a branch near where you live and where you work. Also, some of the drug stores in the area CVS and Eckerd let you get cash back when you use your atm card to make a purchase. Before my bank was in the hood I would do that quite frequently because there is always something you need from the drug store.

				Citibank charges non-customers $2 to use their ATMs.&nbsp; Washington Mutual used to not charge anyone to use their ATMs.&nbsp; Now they charge non-customers $1.50.&nbsp; So if your bank is not in Astoria, it is cheaper to use WM&#039;s ATM&#039;s or even better, free to get cash back at Eckard&#039;s, than to use Citibank&#039;s ATM.

				Oh! Now I understand. Citibank doesn&#039;t charge me because they are my bank. Whew! <br /><br />I used to travel a lot, and finding an ATM was always easy for me. Everywhere I went, there was always a Citibank.

				Ah, now I understand re: Wamu and fees... I thought OP was looking for a bank that didn&#039;t charge you on top of the other bank&#039;s ATM fees (i.e., when I had a Citibank account, they would charge an additional 50 cents on top of the $1.50 that the other bank would charge). Wamu doesn&#039;t charge that extra fee, so when I&#039;m too lazy to walk that extra block up to Broadway to go to Wamu and instead walk to the banks on 30th Ave, I&#039;m only charged the $1.50, not the $1.50 + my own bank&#039;s fee. It has definitely saved me at least $100/year in additional unnecessary fees. Now, if I add up all the $1.50+ fees from the other banks, I&#039;d probably cry once I realize how much money I&#039;ve just given away for the convenience of avoiding a short walk.

				Yeah. Just to reiterate:<br /><br />Every time you use an ATM you can get hit with two possible fees:<br />1. YOUR bank may charge a fee.<br />2. The bank who owns the ATM may charge a fee.<br /><br />Usually banks don&#039;t charge their own customers to use their own ATM&#039;s. But, most banks do charge one or both fees to use OTHER bank&#039;s ATM&#039;s.<br /><br />I was with Commerce for about 2 years when they changed their policy and stopped reimbursing the fees charged when I used other bank&#039;s ATM&#039;s. So I switched to WAMU as they have lots of ATM&#039;s throughout the city that are close to where I live/work so I can just use their own ATM&#039;s and not pay any fees at all.
