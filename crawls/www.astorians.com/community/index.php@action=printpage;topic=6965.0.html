				We&#039;re running on a back up that was done Saturday at 12:00AM. Any posts since then are now lost.<br /><br />Seems a hard drive crashed on the server and we lost some data. This was the most recent backup I had.<br /><br />It appears that the &quot;nods&quot; system still isn&#039;t working. I&#039;ll try and get this figured out on Sunday.

				Woo woo, yay, my addiction is back :)<br /><br />But just fyi, I don&#039;t think nods are working. I tried them also on the 1st post in this thread, and it didn&#039;t work. Switched browsers (from firefox to IE), still not working. Just letting ya know.

				Yeah, I&#039;m trying to figure out the nods right now :( Don&#039;t know why those won&#039;t come back. I might have to take a stab at it tomorrow since I&#039;m getting tired. At least the database is back and doesn&#039;t have any errors (except today&#039;s posts are gone forever.)

				Well folks I&#039;m not sure what&#039;s going on with the server. It just starts running slow occasionally and starts giving MYSQL errors. If you notice any more let me know. Seems to be back up now, not sure if it&#039;s fixed or not.<br /><br />Edit: Ok, should be fixed.
