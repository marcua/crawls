				i saw marketa closed down for a while now, are they definitely out of business? It would be a shame, food was among the best in the neighborhood even thought service was mostly lackluster. Anybody have I for about it?

				I haven&#039;t seen or heard too many people liking the place.&nbsp; Particularly the awful service.&nbsp; They seemed very unorganized and one or two things we ate were downright horrible.&nbsp; They did a lot of work with the building so hopefully the next people reuse the space.

				I think this neighborhood is saturated with mediocre pseudo-cafes pumping out overly loud dance music.&nbsp; The population is changing and the only restaurants that seem to survive are ones that offer something different and/or run a truly &quot;millennial&quot; marketing campaign (e.g. strong social media).&nbsp; It&#039;s a pretty huge space so I wonder what <em>can</em> go in there.

				30th is definitely caf√© row and also a few Italian and fancy pizza places.&nbsp; Other than Domnie&#039;s, not much in the way of an American pub kind of place. Though Front Toward Enemy has gone more Irish pub than from where it started.&nbsp; Anyway, I could see a place like Oliver&#039;s maybe doing well in that space, and filling it if they had part sports bar, part dining, and part lounge.

				On the contrary, 30th has become a haven for pubs. William Hallet, Bourbon and Vine, Judy &amp; Punch, and Sweet Afton (right off 30th) - and those are all within a three block radius. Pubs - even without a full restaurant - have been doing pretty good business. Even Halsey&#039;s Tavern, the new bar in the back half of the Brick Cafe, has been pretty crowded and I haven&#039;t seen any info about it anywhere - it&#039;s off the beaten path and no advertising from what I can tell, but they&#039;re still doing well.

				I haven&#039;t been in Halsey&#039;s yet, but pass by daily. My issue -- it&#039;s too bright for a bar. They serve a pretty full menu -- the Brick menu + some pub food, like burgers. They, and Brick, are new additions to Seamless Web.

				My partner and I were long-time regulars at the Brick Cafe lounge. We knew about the sale of the entire place and were there on the last weekend before the lounge closed for remodeling to become Halseys at the end of the summer. <br /><br /><br />The new manager told us he anticipates Halseys becoming the &#039;craft beer capital&#039; of Astoria - which meant nothing to us as neither of us drink craft beers. He promised us the changes would be minimal, but it no longer appeals to us. <br /><br /><br />As a previous poster said, it&#039;s way too bright for a bar. I&#039;ve passed by on a few evenings and even from outside it&#039;s too bright. They&#039;ve also done away with the extensive wine selection that was a standard for Brick. The new manager had told me they&#039;d have &#039;wine on tap&#039; which didn&#039;t appeal to me at all. <br /><br /><br />The lounge used to have a charming, rustic appeal and it was a great place to relax for us to relax without the glare of televisions and bright lighting. I know everything has to change over time, but the lounge did great business and was always busy. What&#039;s there now doesn&#039;t appeal to either of us. <br /><br /><br />We&#039;ve been enjoying drinks around the corner at Pachanga Patterson, which has a great staff, good wine and beer selection and a comfortable atmosphere (including the right lighting). <br /><br /><br /><br />

If you like the dark relaxed vibe with a good wine selection, try DiWine on 31 Ave. Also the best bartender in the neighborhood, Nick.

				<br />I&#039;m so sad to hear Marketa closed.&nbsp; I found the place to be somewhat different from the other places in the immediate vicinity.&nbsp; It seemed a bit more er...discreet?...whereas some of the other places (like the one directly on the other side of 30th Ave.) feels more like a Euro type club/restaurant.&nbsp; What I liked about Marketa was (beyond the great music the DJ would often play) ...their grilled salmon dish on a bed of micro greens and peas and fingerling potatoes.&nbsp; The first time I went there and got that dish I was actually not expecting it to be so incredibly good...on par with other real high-end restaurants.<br /><br />I agree that overall, 30th Ave has become overly saturated with bars and restaurants, many of which have no original theme or charm.&nbsp; I DO like SugarFreak....great ambiance and vibe there.&nbsp; And Butcher Bar is usually pretty good.&nbsp; Ovelia can be ok, and that juice bar that is attached to/behind that other restaurant on the corner of maybe 35th?&nbsp; ...that&#039;s a great juice bar.&nbsp; But those are probably the only places I&#039;d go to.<br /><br />I do like that there are still some old school establishments that make it still feel like Old Astoria....that guitar shop that offers lessons...that strange hobby/religious shop....I hope they aren&#039;t forced out due to higher rents all to make way for more bars and restaurants!&nbsp; I&#039;m really sad at how oversaturated Astoria is becoming.
