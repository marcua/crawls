				hello all... as some of you&nbsp; may or may not know... i work as a foster care and adoption social worker here in nyc. <br /><br />i was sent information about a special that will be airing on tv tonite. i just felt the need to share this with you all. <br /><br />it&#39;s supposed to be a couple days of programming on the issues surrounding foster care... i really feel it&#39;s important to discuss these issues and present them to others who may not have much good information about foster care. <br /><br />my romantic hope is that more people will become aware of it and one or all of the following will happen:<br /><br />-will inspire more people to become foster parents<br />-will inspire more GOOD and LOVING people to adopt a child who needs a family<br />-will inspire more people to bring this to the attention of our government in an appeal to gain more funding (as THIS CURRENT administration constantly cuts funding on social service programs any chance they get) in hopes that this will improve conditions of current child welfare administration, attract better, qualified, and COMPETANT workers in the field, which eventually<br /><br />WILL PREVENT MORE CHILDREN FROM BEING ABUSED, NEGLECTED, OR ABANDONED AGAIN. <br /><br />sorry this is part rant and part notification of the show. <br />if any of you catch it and have questions about foster care, feel free to post here, or message me. i&#39;m new to this field but have learned so much and feel strongly about social justice... and genuinely care about all my clients and my children on my caseload and all others throughout the nation. <br /><br />ok, here&#39;s the info:<br /><br />&quot;FYI...<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />A Call to Action: Saving Our Children<br /><br />Diane Sawyer Takes on Foster Care, on PRIMETIME, Thursday, June 1<br /><br />ABC News Investigates America&#39;s Foster Care Crisis, June 1, 2 and 3<br /><br />In an unparalleled call to action, Diane Sawyer and the resources of ABC News look at the crisis of the foster care system and at ways children can be saved. Sawyer casts a light on young fractured lives, as she takes a rare look at foster care across the country. With unprecedented access -- bringing cameras where they have never been before - she explores a system many consider broken, but one that is struggling to change. CALLING ALL ANGELS, a PRIMETIME report, airs on Thursday, June 1 (10:00-11:00&nbsp; p.m. , ET) on the ABC Television Network. As part of a News-division wide call to action, additional reports on foster care will air on GOOD MORNING AMERICA, WORLD NEWS TONIGHT, NIGHTLINE and 20/20 throughout Thursday, June 1, Friday, June 2 and Saturday, June 3.<br /><br />According to the latest statistics, just over 800,000 children pass through the system every year, more than 500,000 of whom are taken into foster care. For them, the average length of stay is 31 months. A third are in the system for more than three years; 17 percent are in foster care for five or more years; and foster children have on average three different placements. There are currently more than 100,000 foster children available for adoption.&quot;<br /><br />
