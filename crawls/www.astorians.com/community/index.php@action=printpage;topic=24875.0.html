				<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: medium;" class="bbc_size">Hey everyone!</span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;" class="bbc_font">[/size]<span style="font-size: medium;" class="bbc_size">My name is Kyle, I&#039;m 26 (from California but raised in Indiana), straight, and I&#039;m seeking to rent my own room in an already established living situation with roommate(s). My current sublease contract is up at the end of June so I&#039;ll need a place by July 1 for at least a 6 month minimum. I am a young professional (work full-time in hospitality in downtown Manhattan) and I study gymnastics/acrobatic skateboarding in Chelsea at a sports complex. I&#039;m interested in any clean living situation, as close to Manhattan as possible, primarily because I have to be in the city 24/7. I&#039;m very reliable, have a great credit score, and am available to provide any lists of past roommate/landlord/work references. I don&#039;t discriminate and have lived with both male AND female roommates before (more so female than male). FYI - I am 420 friendly but am very respectful of those who heavily oppose it. My biggest pro is that I&#039;m very organized and put together, and making sure my adult responsibilities are handled professionally. If you are not clean/organized in any way, don&#039;t even bother. I&#039;m willing to spend $750/rent MAX, nothing more so please, only serious inquiries only.Please feel free to contact me via email and we can network further from there! Much much appreciated!</span></span>[/color]

				Hey Kyle, I&#039;m Fahrim, a 35 year old Malaysian, I just got to NYC 2 months ago, and currently living temporarily with a friend. I&#039;d appreciate it if you could call me or shoot an email to discuss this further. <br /><br />You can contact me at Fahrim@gmail.com or call /message me at 718 679 7734<br /><br />I&#039;m 420 friendly too, but i rarely have time to indulge these days, currently i&#039;m working at a laundromat near Soho to make ends meet, while planning to further my studies. I&#039;m a graphic designer by profession back home. I&#039;m a neat and tidy person, in fact almost OCD, but i don&#039;t impose.<br />All i&#039;m saying is i&#039;m a clean person and would like to find a similar person to move into. Do call or contact me over email. Cheers!<br /><br /><br />Fahrim Azrul
