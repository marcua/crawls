				After living for 2+ years car-less here in Astoria, I&#039;ve decided to bring my car up from Virginia where it is currently sitting at my father&#039;s, in a test-run of sorts to see how difficult or convenient it is to live here with a car.&nbsp; <br /><br />Growing up in the parking-blessed suburbs of Northern Virginia however, the idea of alternate side parking is foreign to me, and I&#039;m worried about amassing a series of tickets, amongst other things, in parking in the wrong place in the wrong time.&nbsp; I have researched renting out a spot, and have not put it out of the question, but decided to at least attempt for the first month to see how much of an annoyance on-street parking is.<br /><br />My question is, are there any parts of Astoria, preferably near Ditmars that DON&#039;T have to deal with alternate side parking?&nbsp; I know my friend out in Bayside doesn&#039;t have to deal with it as she is in a very residentail area, so it makes me wonder if parts of Astoria, once you get past Ditmars &amp; Steinway, like in the 40s, do not require it.&nbsp; If not, I would gladly park down there if it means not having to move my car every so often.

				The only real alternative to alternate side of the street parking that I know of is renting a garage, but that will cost you $200 plus a month.

				Keep in mind there&#039;s no such thing as &quot;free&quot; parking. That is, you WILL get tickets without even trying!<br /><br />Alternate side is a pain, but it&#039;s only 2x/week.

				I think there&#039;s one or two blocks in Astoria that don&#039;t have alternate side.&nbsp; It&#039;s been mentioned here before.&nbsp; Just search for it.<br /><br />Otherwise, I&#039;d recommend parking along 20th Avenue from the park to 31st street if you don&#039;t mind the walk from wherever it is you live.&nbsp; There&#039;s pretty much always parking except late night Sunday and Monday.&nbsp; The side of 20th Ave along the ConEdison yard is a Tuesday cleaning side and the opposite side is Monday.<br /><br />And just FYI, street cleaning is suspended tomorrow (and probably will be on Tuesday as well) due to the snow.

				This came up in an earlier thread here and someone posted this site, which I&#039;ve found generally pretty accurate:<br /><br />http://www.primospot.com/<br /><br />In addition to the area Carla99 mentions, there are large stretches of unrestricted parking in the far west of Astoria, past 14th street.

				Im in the&nbsp; upper 40&#039;s (Ditmars/21st Ave) and we have it. Like someone said earlier...streets need to be cleaned.<br /><br />Also, you might keep an eye out for the school signs as well. That can alter your car moving schedule.

				Thanks for the info everyone.<br /><br />So it looks like until I’m ready to fork over the fee for garage parking, I’ll be having to learn the ins and outs of alternate side parking.&nbsp; <br /><br />My next questions.&nbsp; Is there a website which lists the alternate side parking schedule for the city?&nbsp; Does it change from one block to the next, where one block has it two days a week and the next is four days a week, all on different weeks, or are large chunks of the neighborhood under the same schedule?&nbsp; I’m at Ditmars &amp; 33rd and I believe my immediate block is on a twice a week schedule.&nbsp; Also, if there is going to be a snowstorm the day that one needs to move their car, what is the best plan of action?&nbsp; Also if the cleaning day falls on a holiday, does cleaning get skipped over that day until the next scheduled cleaning, or do they push it to the next day?&nbsp; And finally, since I foresee this becoming something I will become acquainted with unfortunately…..how much are tickets for failing to move your car?<br />

				This might be of some help....<br /><br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/motorist/prkintro.shtml#altside<br /><br /><br />Also, just take a look around your neighborhood. There are signs everywhere. And if you happen to watch NY1 in the morning, they will usually tell you if weather has altered the street parking rules.

Just read the signs.<br /><br />If there&#039;s going to be a snowstorm, and you&#039;re parked on a one-way street, try to park on the left side of the street. The plows push the snow to the right. If you&#039;re on the left, you&#039;ll have less to dig out.<br /><br />Alternate side doesn&#039;t always get canceled for snow - it&#039;s kind of a case-by-case (or storm-by-storm) call. If you&#039;re ever not sure, call 311 - it&#039;s usually the first thing the recording mentions. There are some holidays where it&#039;s suspended, the calendar is here:<br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/motorist/scrintro.shtml (http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/motorist/scrintro.shtml)<br /><br />On the holidays (like this Friday, Christmas), it just gets skipped over, and not pushed to another day.<br /><br />If you use Gmail/Google calendar, someone usually makes a custom calendar of the Alternate side &quot;holidays&quot; and I have mine set to email me 2 days before every time Alt side is canceled, so I don&#039;t have to think about moving my car for that day. But I get a little overzealous with my calendar and the auto-emailing things you can do :)<br /><br />Also, be sure you check the times on the alt side signs. My area is on a Wed/Thurs schedule, and in front of my apt, I can&#039;t park from 9:30-11. Around the corner, it&#039;s 11:30-1, even though it&#039;s the same days.<br /><br />It sounds like a lot to remember, but it&#039;s really not so bad once you get the hang of it. Sometimes you might have to park a little further away, but it&#039;s worth it not to get the ticket (last time I got one, I *think* it was $65, but this was a few years ago).

				In the Ditmars area, it&#039;s only 1-2 days a week that requires moving. Below 31st it&#039;s Monday and Tuesday. One side of the street is Monday, the other Tuesday. Above 31st it&#039;s Wednesday and Thursday. Just move it the night before so you don&#039;t forget as the meter cops will be ticketing your car at 8:30:01am in the morning.<br /><br />If the weather is bad, call 311 and they will tell you if the parking is suspended or not for today and the next day.

				When I had a car, I used to park on 45th-47th between 25th and 28th.&nbsp; Definitely no alternate side there.&nbsp; I could leave my car for weeks.&nbsp; A tire was slashed once, but other than that, I never had a problem.

				48th Street, between 30th and 31st Aves has no alternate side.&nbsp; I used to live on that block and when my daddy gave me his car for a few months, that&#039;s where I parked it to forget about it.&nbsp;
