			I would also like to vouch for Jaso. She cleaned our house last week (1 bedroom with an office + 2 bathrooms) and did an incredible job - it was very thorough. She also did our laundry to perfection. She was extremely personable and I felt very comfortable with her right away. I hope to have her cleaning for us for many years to come here in Astoria and getting to know her in the process. She seems so far like a wonderful person who truly gives 100% to her efforts. Highly recommend!

			I met Jaso three weeks ago.&nbsp; <br />The first day she came and did not stop cleaning until she left my three bedroom apartment the cleanest it has been in years, what a treat to have somebody help you with cleaning and have your apartment smelling fresh and dust free!<br />The next time she came to help me care for my 6 month old baby while I got some office work done, since he has become very demanding for attention.&nbsp; He just loved her and had the time of his life with her singing to him and playing and giving him all the attention he craved.&nbsp; She just comes across as a very sweet, caring, and good person with whom I felt very comfortable being around.<br />She will continue to help me once a week with both cleaning and assisting me with the baby so I can get some work done around the house without feeling like I am neglecting my little one.&nbsp; <br />I just have to say that in three weeks she has certainly made a big impact in our quality of life.&nbsp; <br />If you want to contact her, her number is [removed by moderator]<br /><br />Marcela

			I&#039;ll jump in here and also offer a recommendation for Jaso&#039;s work. We&#039;ve had her come on 3 occasions and have been extremely pleased. So I can vouch for the positive recommendations above.

			Jaso did a FANTASTIC job on our 1-bedroom apartment. I had thought that I was a pretty clean, neat person - I vacuum, I mop, I wipe down countertops and the oven with some regularity. That&#039;s why I was shocked that she spent all day cleaning my apartment, and I was absolutely amazed at the difference! She got to our place at 9am and didn&#039;t leave until 4:30pm. Everything sparkled like it did when we moved in. Truly could not believe what a fantastic, thorough job she did, and all with a wonderful attitude. I&#039;ll be using her services regularly!
