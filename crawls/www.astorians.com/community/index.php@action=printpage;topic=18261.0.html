				Has anyone successfully used a restaurant.com coupon?&nbsp; My bf and I have 3 $50 coupons from restaurant.com -- given to us as gifts.&nbsp; The minimums for food are so high, that we can&#039;t afford to eat at any of the restaurants.&nbsp; It would cost less to just go to the restaurant and order normally.&nbsp; I don&#039;t mind the mid-week restriction but we can&#039;t seem to find a place that doesn&#039;t have a food minimum that would be less than we&#039;d normally spend at these places.&nbsp; <br /><br />For example: We&#039;d normally spend $50 total at Restaurant X for a nice night out.&nbsp; But to use our $50 coupon, the restrictions say we have to spend $100, not including booze and tax and tip, thus making it way more expensive to use the coupon.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any advice?&nbsp; Anyone ever use these coupons?&nbsp; Anyone want to buy them from me?&nbsp;

				Yeah, I would just go with a few friends.&nbsp; I&#039;ve used a few of them, and that minimum and all the other restrictions, like not being able to even use them on a weekend, has turned me off to them in general.&nbsp; I think they are just a business builder for most restaurants.

				ELO and I bought them after I knew we were going. &nbsp;I wouldn&#039;t hesitate to use them again personally, but it&#039;s not very nice to give/get as a gift given all the restrictions unless you know recipient uses them already. &nbsp;

				I wouldn&#039;t want to regift something that no one can use.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather sell them at a discount to people who already use them and like them.&nbsp; Or better yet, I&#039;d love to find a restaurant where I can actually use them.&nbsp; But that seems less and less likely as no one is naming names.&nbsp; &nbsp;:cry:<br /><br />I&#039;ll sell them for $40 each!&nbsp;

				I use them regularly and have only once had a problem (and that was at Sac&#039;s). I get them with the discount codes and they only cost me $2.00 with the 80% off codes. I don&#039;t know which certificates you have, but they are either the ones you use to buy gift certificates from a specific restaurant or ones for a specific restaurant. I also buy Groupon&#039;s that I share with friends and I give them as gifts when I know that someone will be traveling out of town. I give them to one of my daughters-in-law in Los Angeles so that she and her friends can have a nice lunch/brunch sans babies and now that I am planning a trip, I am collecting restaurant.com gift certificates for places along my route so that we can save some bucks and still enjoy good food. <br /><br />Tomorrow morning I am taking my doggies to their groomer. They are located on the UES. One of my kids is in town doing the network up-fronts and I am meeting him with my Groupon for the Yorkville Creperie on the UES for breakfast where we will scarf down some yummy breakfast or sweet crepes and plenty of good java all for $10.00. Then I go back and bring home two very clean, sweet smelling doggies with perfect hair cuts . . . and my son goes back to work!

I think the value of those coupons (depending on what restaurants they are for) is about six US dollars.

				Oh, no no no no... they are very different.&nbsp; And I won&#039;t stand by and have you defame Groupon by even putting them in the same category as restaurant.com.&nbsp; You can actually <em>use</em> a Groupon to get a thing.&nbsp; You know exactly what you&#039;re buying and how much it&#039;s worth.&nbsp; Restaurant.com is a fraud and a scam and makes me a sad panda.&nbsp; <br /><br />To be clear: I&#039;m not bad-mouthing the <em>concept </em>of a coupon.&nbsp; I&#039;m bad-mouthing restaurant.com &quot;coupons&quot; and how much they suck.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				i swear by restaurant.com.&nbsp; my boyfriend and i have used 50+ in the year since we started using them. AMAZING.<br />see, you have to buy the $25 ones (i know you got your as a gift)...because with those, there&#039;s only a $35 minimum = $10 dinner for two (+$2 certificate)<br /><br />the other nice thing about the company, is that they have restaurants all over the country, and we&#039;ve used them in several cities.

				I have ben using restaurant.com for years without any problems whatsoever. And Groupons for more than 1 year. They are the same, since you&#039;re getting a 50% discount (or more) with both.&nbsp; I am interested to know what the differences may be between the two.
