			Thanks, BKozis, definitely will check &#039;em out! I&#039;m always looking for great deals, prices these days just seem to be going up on everything! I don&#039;t toss those weekly fliers from the local drug stores (CVS, Rite Aid) and supermarkets until my bf and I have studied them! Always find something we need on sale in &#039;em!

			I have used FatWallet.com to find some great deals. Another tip is never buy something online (travel, Amazon, Target, etc.) without a coupon code which is entered at check out. Usually you can Google &quot;Amazon Coupon&quot; or &quot;Target promotion&quot; or something like that and you will get a ton of links to promotions. I recently used a coupon code to book a hotel down in New Orleans. With the coupon and my AAA discount, I knocked off about 20%. A little homework can save you a bundle.<br /><br />
