				a friend of a friend is moving here from south korea to study for her master&#39;s degree. she wants to rent a room and has $600 a month to spend. i really don&#39;t know where to look other than craigslist, about which I have heard dubious thiings lately. She doesn&#39;t want to use a broker if she doesn&#39;t have to. <br /><br />i rather doubt she will be able to afford living in astoria or LIC, but I thought I would start looking here. If anyone cares to offer suggestions about other neighborhoods that are safe and affordable, that would be great.

				My experience has been pretty favorable with Craigslist - for the roommates section only.&nbsp; I have both looked for rooms and found roommates off of it, and it&#39;s been great.&nbsp; I think she could find someplace in Astoria actually, as long as she&#39;s looking for roommates sharing a two/three bedroom, and not looking for a one-bedroom/studio just for herself.&nbsp; But Woodside, Sunnyside, and Elmhurst would be great options too, and I think she&#39;d be okay in either one.&nbsp; The roommates section of Craigslist is thankfully, relatively broker free.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it might be harder for your friend to find something without actually being here, because most people who are looking for roommates want an in-person interview.&nbsp; Which was not a bad experience in the least for me, both as the interviewer and the interviewee.&nbsp; It just helps everyone feel more at ease about whom to select. <br /><br />Also word of mouth is a great way to find something too.&nbsp; Send emails to all your friends, post it on your friendster or myspace account, or other lists such as this one.

				Yeah, Craigslist&#39;s &quot;roommates wanted&quot; or shared (whatever its called) section is actually pretty good. I met LOTS of people (most of whom seemed normal) through there before I found my current place 1.5 years ago. Since I wanted to be in Astoria, and since lots of other people do too, it took me awhile, since everyone I was meeting with met with a bunch of other applicants too. But was offered the first place I looked at in Brooklyn - I woulda moved in too, it was $650 each, the girl seemed cool, and the building would have allowed my cat...but the neighborhood was sketchy - I wasn&#39;t comfortable walking around on a sunny Saturday afternoon, so I didn&#39;t think I should live there. Too bad.<br /><br />Anyway, its the full-on rental listings on CL that are loaded with fake listings from brokers to lure you into working with them. <br /><br />I agree that its going to be hard find a roommate without her actually being here to interview. (And I can&#39;t imagine she&#39;d even be able to find a studio anywhere in NY on $600/month, which stinks, I know.) Maybe she can find a one-or-two month sublet on Craigslist (I&#39;ve never used that section so I can&#39;t speak for how good it is, but I&#39;d imagine its pretty decent) or stay with a friend to get her bearings here, and then she can find a more permanent place once she gets here?

				actually, she&#39;s staying in a hostel for a couple of days and we will apartment hunt once she arrives. i guess i didn&#39;t explain that very well. <br /><br />i guess we&#39;ll hit craigslist, then, and see how it goes..

				roomies section is A-ok on craigslist. I found my first place and roomie! on there and have never been dissapointed. <br />she&#39;ll definetly have to be here to find one though, i wouldn&#39;t trust anyone renting out a room in their own apartment that didn&#39;t want to meet the person.<br /><br />and its been a few years but i think for around 600 she should have no problem.<br /><br />good luck!

				The roommate section in Craigslist is great.&nbsp; The only problem is when you are the person hoping to move in.&nbsp; It can almost be like trying to make it in Hollywood.&nbsp; There are at the least 20 people trying out for that one room.&nbsp; Make sure she is ready to put on her game face and &quot;wow&quot; some people.&nbsp; It won&#39;t be easy but she is bound to find something.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am looking at apartments tonight to move out of my 4 bedroom on Steinway.&nbsp; I would offer the room; there are 4 windows, it is huge, with a nice closet and I am within walking distance from the train.&nbsp; I pay $575- but I am moving out because my roommate has this little dog that runs all over the apartment like a mad man.&nbsp; I wouldn&#39;t want to subject anyone to that.
