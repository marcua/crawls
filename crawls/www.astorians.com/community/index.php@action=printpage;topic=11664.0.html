				I&#039;m sure we&#039;re all trying to pinch our pennies right now. I wanted to open up a thread to share tips, resources, etc etc. I did try &quot;buy nothing new&quot; for a month or so last year and that was cool - but my biggest money suck is not new stuff (clothes, books, CDs, etc). It&#039;s eating out. <br /><br />What I&#039;m doing right now: <br /><br />- trying to keep my monthly expenses below a certain amount<br />- brown-bagging it, eating out less often<br />- I joined paperbackswap.com and swapacd.com so that I can have &quot;new&quot; books and CDs for about the price of postage and pass my used things along to people who will enjoy them<br />- not using credit cards<br />- eliminating debt<br />- looking for free events on clubfreetime.com and the river to river website<br /><br />Some blogs I read: <br />My Open Wallet (http://www.myopenwallet.net/)<br />Get Rich Slowly (http://www.getrichslowly.org/)<br /><br />So, fellow astorians, how are you squeezing the lincolns? got any resources to share?

				This is a great idea! <br />We dont buy a lot of luxury items but I am watching our grocery/energy/entertainment bills start to creep up an up and its starting to make me nervous. I am anxious to hear everyone&#039;s suggestions.<br /><br />I do make most meals and send my husbands lunch daily. And we try to take advantage of nyc free events, check out freecycle and the free stuff on craigslist (which is how we got ALL of our packing/moving supplies a year ago).

				My husband and I have been saving for a house for the last two years. We have seriously cut back on eating out, going out (bars, movies, etc) and both now bring our lunch to work. <br /><br />Instead of seeing movies in the theatre (unless it is an absolute must see) we joined Netflix.<br />I swap books with friends.<br />Cut coupons for the food store and drugstore.<br />Save change in a jar. We have turned it into a competition to see who can save the most amount of change. You would be amazed how much money you can save if you just throw it into a big container and forget about it for awhile.

				For me, food is the biggest expenditure too, as I&#039;m pretty frugal in other areas of my life (no new toys, no &quot;shopping sprees&quot; unless something is broken or torn needs to be replaced)<br /><br />Working on:<br />Going to buy a french press for work to stop buying coffee 2-3x week<br />Brown bagging lunch <br />Using debit as credit to accumulate airline miles<br />Use husband’s business hotel and car rentals points for free hotel and car rental points for getaway weekends<br />Instead of meeting friends out, inviting them over for dinner<br />Buying pantry items when they&#039;re on sale<br />Not buying protein and vegetables when I&#039;m not going to cook with them that night<br />In general, trying to be better about food waste and spoilage<br />Library instead of buying books<br />Downsize my gym membership and do tapes at home <br />Looking into cutting cell phone costs<br />Looking into an all in one purpose cleaner for windows, floors, tub, toilet (biokleen can you save me?)<br />Staying local for vacation (not flying to Europe, oh man, Italy, how much I miss you!) and saving up for Italy or New Zealand in the next two years.<br />Investing in making my apt. beautiful so that I don’t have the itch to go out and increasing the value of home with home improvements<br />Finding free entertainment around the city<br />Possibly moving out of this tax-burdensome state into a greener, but not more suburbian location (is there such a place???) in the next 2-3 years.<br /><br />and probably not being a huge drinker and non smoker helps, too, but these costs have been invisible for a while.

				&nbsp;I called my credit card company and made them lower my annual percentage rate.<br /><br />I also switched to a program that earns points for every dollar you spend towards merchandise or gift cards. There was no extra charge and when I reach a certain amount of points I trade them in. A few months ago I earned a $50 gift card good for Marshall&#039;s/TJ Maxx.

				I am not sure I actually save money with these after buying all the bran - I probably do. <br /><br />Bran Muffins (http://foodiefarmgirl.blogspot.com/2007/02/back-into-bran-muffins.html) <br />I make big, hearty whole-grain muffins and add nuts, dried fruit or, um, chocolate chips to make them a little more interesting. Sometimes I even add cocoa powder to the muffin mix. <br /><br />I&#039;ve also tried the famous &quot;no-knead bread&quot; and have been pretty happy with it. <br /><br />I bring a jar with a lid to work and use it to make iced tea with the tea bags and hot water provided. Chill in the fridge, then ice and drink with my lunch instead of buying soda. I still get a little caff and the sense of a treat, which is why I buy the soda. <br /><br />I make a big batch of food on the weekends for my lunches - usually about 3 things. This weekend I made a chicken-curry-type thing, a bean/ham/rice mix for filling tacos, and steak with peppers and onions (sandwich filling). I can freeze whatever I won&#039;t eat this week. <br /><br />I use dried beans instead of canned - a big batch of beans is a starting point for a lot of different meals - all tasty. <br /><br />I am trying to invite people over instead of going out to eat. I used to be pretty good at this, I just have to get back in the habit...

				I started doing the coupon thing too in the past few months. At first I felt dorky about it, but it&#039;s now become an OBSESSION. Newsday has the best coupons (yes, how much they offer sometimes differs from paper to paper), and the Sunday Newsday is only $1. So if you want to do coupons, get it even if you don&#039;t read it.<br /><br />At the grocery store, I stock up on stuff when it&#039;s on sale, as people have mentioned. I eat a lot of chicken, and the family packs of breasts are on sale a lot. I get them home and freeze them into sandwich-sized freezer bags. They defrost quickly if you put the bagged meat in a bowl of cool water (I don&#039;t know the physics behind it, but it works!) I hate defrosting them in the microwave, they get all ewwey. I also stock up on cereal - if you just buy individual boxes, they&#039;re expensive, but if you keep an eye on sales &amp; coupons, they can be cheap. An example - Smart Start cereal at CVS is something like $4.59 a box. A month or so ago, they had a buy one get one free sale. THEN, I had a crazy coupon (printed from the internet) for $3 off when you buy two boxes of Smart Start. So between the sale and the coupon, I paid about 80 cents a box. If you drive, Target also has good cereal sales. Basically, pay attention to sales everywhere - not just grocery stores - for your food shopping.<br /><br />I also don&#039;t allow myself to get takeout more than once every 2 weeks. It&#039;s too easy of a crutch when I&#039;m hungry, it&#039;s hot, I need groceries/don&#039;t feel like defrosting anything, and I don&#039;t feel like heating up the kitchen. Just last night around 9pm, I was starving but I didn&#039;t want to order anything. Ended up having cereal. Kind of lame, but it&#039;s what I had in the house, and I didn&#039;t feel like actually *cooking*. I keep track of this because my cell phone logs ALL my calls, so I&#039;ll scroll back in the last couple weeks of calls and see when the last time I ate delivery was (yes, I have my fav delivery places in my contacts :) ).

				I like that behavioral tip - I always mean to start eating out less but it&#039;s hard to get on the wagon, much less stay on. I like the idea of just pausing to see when i last ate out. maybe that will help. thanks!!!!<br /><br />i didn&#039;t want to cook last night either. i wound up taking a whole-wheat pita and filling the first half with sundried tomatoes, goat cheese, and zucchini (for which i did heat the kitchen just a little) and the other half with sesame seed butter, banana and chocolate chips. Quick, easy, and only a little cooking which i could have avoided completely. <br /><br />having a few things on hand - cereal or whatever - from which you can quickly pull together a satisfying meal can tip the balance away from ordering out.

My mom has a seltzer maker and she has to put a new co2 cartridge in for each liter, and those cartridges aren&#039;t that cheap.<br /><br />For me, the biggest things so far to save money (and I&#039;m unemployed, so it&#039;s not just about the state of the economy for me) have been to start making my own coffee and iced coffee instead of getting it to go, and cooking food instead of getting takeout. A long time ago I started saving lids from takeout iced coffee cups, which was mainly because I didn&#039;t like the iced coffee in the area and thought I could make it better myself. Now I&#039;m especially glad I did that. Those corn plastic cups and lids work especially well for reusing several times.<br /><br />For food cooking, I try to make huge batches of healthy foods that I can eat for two or three meals in a week and then freeze, like vegetarian chili which I must say I make quite well. Organic pasta, cereal, and rice are cheap when you think about how many meals you get out of them and how filling they are. Decent vegetables are pretty easy to get on the cheap, but meat has proven to be more difficult. I&#039;m trying to get the highest quality stuff I can without breaking the bank, like I really want organic chicken, but that&#039;s really expensive. I don&#039;t know if I want to eat more non-organic chicken to save money or just make chicken a rarity. Same with other meats and especially fish. I&#039;ve moved to cheaper but not necessarily unhealthy sources of protein that are easier to keep around like sardines, eggs, and organic jerky (turkey, tuna, beef), and more vegetarian sources like tofu and beans. Beans are great because they are so filling and so cheap, with the obvious unfortunate side effects, so I don&#039;t eat them ALL the time. ;) I made a bean salad a couple weeks ago that was great for a snack and lasted for a whole week, with only one can of organic salad beans from Key Food, half a green pepper, one seedless cucumber, and some Italian dressing. Hummus on whole wheat crackers is also a filling, healthy, and inexpensive snack. <br /><br />Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches shouldn&#039;t be relegated to being kids&#039; food, as I&#039;ve found a very delicious and healthy PBJ can be made if you buy the right bread (which should be toasted for a classier sandwich), organic or at least all-natural peanut butter, and jelly with no sugar added - like Sorrell Ridge brand, which is sweetened with fruit juice and relatively inexpensive. It probably won&#039;t impress your spouse, but for those of us without spouses it&#039;s pretty damn good. <br /><br />Also, probably most importantly, I&#039;m trying to make the most out of things I already have, or things I can get for free, instead of just buying more things that I&#039;d like. Figure I&#039;ll buy unnecessary things again when I&#039;m making money. It&#039;s too bad the economy relies so much on consumption to survive, because it actually makes me feel a little guilty to not be spending money on the things I used to spend money on and supporting the companies I like, which is kind of ridiculous.

				When I started reading the Astorians site I used to think that all Astorians were having trouble paying their rent because they all must eat out every night.&nbsp; Everybody seemed to be trying every new place.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad to see some people are saving.&nbsp; Cutting back on eating out is probably the biggest money saver.&nbsp; Here is my list.<br /><br />Eating out less often.&nbsp; Sometimes if you really want the food take it to go so you save on the beverages and tips.<br /><br />The cost of going to bars adds up really fast.&nbsp; Do it less often or invite friends over and buy the beer and wine from the Beer Distributor or liquor store.&nbsp; <br /><br />I drive to work so I bring twelve packs of soda and snacks.&nbsp; The cost is about 1/3 or 1/4 of the vending machines.&nbsp; I also get up 15-20 minutes earlier and eat cereal or yogurt for breakfast rather than buying it at or on the way to work.<br /><br />Use your Tivo or DVR instead of renting movies.<br /><br />Never pay for music for your I-pod.&nbsp; I borrow and lend Cd&#039;s with my friends and coworkers.&nbsp; If no one has a CD, movie or book I really want I buy it used on Amazon.<br /><br />

Before you add anything else, the peppers should be starting to look cooked and the onions should be softening. <br /><br />While that&#039;s cooking, cut up the mushrooms and then add those at the appropriate time and mix it all around. Open up the tomatoes and break them into the mix, including the juice from the can, and then add the two cans of beans. (You may want to drain the bean juice, but I like leaving in some of it. I like the organic beans from Key Food; the juice in the other stuff skeeves me.) Then add the spices. Then add the bulgar wheat. Add as much of the bulgar as you think you want - for me it serves to provide a meaty texture without being &quot;fake meat,&quot; but the chili shouldn&#039;t be overwhelmed by it, so if I were to measure it I think it&#039;s around 1/4 cup. <br /><br />The wheat will absorb the juice from the tomatoes and bean cans. This should all simmer for at least 20 minutes. Stir it occasionally and taste it to make sure you like the spice level. Add whatever other spices you want; keep in mind that the chili that results from this is not spicy at all, but it is tasty. If you like spicy chili you will need to add your own spicy things. Simmer until it&#039;s not so liquidy and the mushrooms have shrunk. I like serving it with rice, and I cook the rice in a method inspired by Chipotle, which is to cook it with fresh cilantro and lime. But that&#039;s optional.<br /><br />Served with rice, I would say this makes 8-10 servings.

				that sounds really good! <br /><br />I make a taco soup in the fall/winter that&#039;s mostly stuff from cans. It starts with cooking a diced onion and some ground beef (drained when done if necessary), then a can of corn, a can of tomatoes (crushed as you add them), a can of rotel, and a can of beans. I think I am forgetting something. maybe an extra can of tomatoes. the orig recipe calls for a packet of taco seasoning and a packet of ranch seasoning. i just use cumin, cayenne, chili powder, etc until it tastes about right. <br /><br />i hadn&#039;t thought of using bulgar wheat as a beef substitute but it sounds like that might work. i&#039;ll have to try it!<br />

				I found myself spending loads of money on basics like shampoo and conditioner, so I started reading the Rite Aid ad online every Sunday morning.&nbsp; If you&#039;re disciplined about submitting your receipts either online or through the mail you can get insane deals like free organic shampoo and conditioner.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gotten shaving cream, shampoo, conditioner, and other useful stuff for free and other things like deodorant and hair color for a few dollars.&nbsp; You have to wait for the rebate check and you can only submit for your rebate once a month (I think they hope that you&#039;ll shop in the beginning of the month and forget to request the check because you don&#039;t want to be locked out of good deals), but its a reliable program and I&#039;ve saved a lot of money while actually getting to use better products.&nbsp; The best deals are for newly introduced brands; you can still save a few dollars on established brands.<br /><br />I agree on the cooking at home for friends rather than dining out: I spent less than $20 to make BBQ chicken (thighs and legs are good deals and its even better if you cut apart a whole chicken yourself), veg kabobs, and feta/porch produce flatbread, and brownie sundaes for three and we&#039;re still eating leftovers.&nbsp; I think that the key to staying on a food budget is to limit feelings of deprivation by occasionally making really wonderful things that you otherwise couldn&#039;t afford.&nbsp; When I want something that looks (and tastes) like haute cuisine I make pork tenderloin medalions with red onion compote.&nbsp; When I want really delicious Italian I spend an afternoon churning out goat cheese and mushroom ravioli.&nbsp; For just a few dimes you can make the famous (and insanely awesome) no-knead bread that will make the local bakery loaves taste like paste.&nbsp; And if you need to impress someone special just roast a chicken--you can get them for under four bucks at Trade Fair: stuff it with a lemon and bit of sage, salt and pepper liberally.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh- and nstead of skipping the bar, I just order Diet Coke instead of cocktails.&nbsp; Yes, I hate paying $2.50 for each soda, but after two you really can&#039;t take any more and it costs so much less than booze while still getting to see your friends look foolish.&nbsp; AND it saves on a mandatory, stumble-induced cab fare home.

I have a membership to MOMA and go there for my movie fix (the year membership is $60 which gives museum entry, including PS1, and movies free).<br />4.

				I get free hair services at bumble and bumble, sign up at their website. Free haircuts, blowouts, color. Christine Valmy offers deeply discounted facials, etc. when services performed by senior student. Same for NYU Dental School - awesome! If you want more info on that, please p.m. me.<br /><br />Also rebates whenever I do online shopping. www.mrrebates.com.&nbsp; I look for free stuff/deals on www.freesamplesite.com.&nbsp; Last but not least, www.couponcabin.com. Take the time to clip coupons and especially look at the plastic bagged circulars they leave on stoops/foyers -often time there are FREE stuff coupons in there. In the last week I redeemed 2 free 1000 sheet Marcal tp roll coupons, as well as a free container of Wholly Guacamole. If I had not looked at the circulars, wouldn&#039;t have seen &#039;em. I&#039;d say I save about $1,000 a year doing the above stuff. <br /><br />Someone else mentioned Rite Aid - excellent way to get free after rebate stuff - just try not to LOSE your receipts as I tend to do. Also, if you forget to request your&nbsp; check, they are nice enough to do it for you&nbsp; and notify you by email that its on its way.

				I&#039;ve been happy with the ING direct (http://home.ingdirect.com/) savings account, but the interest rate may not be quite so good as HSBC. One problem is that when I really desperately need the cash I have to go online and transfer it to my checking account, and it can take a couple of days for that to go through. But otherwise I&#039;ve been happy with it. <br /><br />Another great thing about ING is that you can open a savings account or CD with any amount of money (I think their lower limit is literally $.01). If, like me, you have a little trouble scraping together enough cash for other places, this can be very helpful.<br /><br />here are some more food links: <br /><br />Budget Vino (http://www.budgetvino.com/)<br /><br />Cheap Eats (http://www.culinate.com/columns/kitchen_limbo/cheap_eats) - This is an article about using beans in a lot of different ways.

				I was so excited that I had lowered my cingular bill by $20 a month. <br /><br />Well, I checked my account online today and those goddam fuckers put an &quot;account change&quot; charge on my account that is about the same as my monthly bill. I am so pissed. I could call and complain, but I would just get more mad and still get stuck with the charge. ARGH!!!!!!!

				Nice, frugal and summery, served at room temp. very satisfying. <br /><br />salad: <br />--6 medium redskin potatoes, boiled and cooled, then sliced<br />--about 2 cups of green beans, dropped into boiling water until just done and then transferred immediately to a bowl of ice water<br />--1 can, drained or about 2 cups of cannelini beans - optional, i didn&#039;t do this but I think it would be good<br />--about 1/2 cup of grape tomatoes, halved<br />--1 can of tuna, drained (and rinsed, if you like)<br />--a handful of thinly sliced red onion<br /><br />use the potato slices as a not too precise base and casually pile the other ingredients on top. <br /><br />dressing (I didn&#039;t measure at the time but I think this is pretty close. maybe a little less mustard, maybe a little more dill)<br />--juice of one lemon<br />--some red wine vinegar. probably about a tablespoon<br />--1 garlic clove, minced<br />--1 tablespoon? minced shallot<br />--1 teaspoon dijon mustard<br />--one teaspoon minced dill<br />--maybe a teaspooon of capers<br />--salt and pepper to taste<br /><br />I let the dressing sit for about 30 minutes, then dressed the salad and let it sit for 15 minutes, then served on lettuce. It was so, so good. I think it should be easy to adapt - leave out the tuna, add some olives, etc.

				I didn&#039;t know this and it doesn&#039;t really help unless you buy them in advance, but there&#039;s a way to buy movies hella cheaper than at the box office or through Fandango. My grandmother used to always use these when I was growing up and I never really &quot;got it&quot;. I totally get it now: She was just a product of the Depression. <br /><br />I paid almost $40 last night for two movie tickets, a large coke and two candy items when I could have paid $26:<br /><br />http://www.corporateboxoffice.com/cgi-bin/shop/shop.pl?view=gift<br /><br />Most of them are corporate deals - packs of 50+ tickets - but they do have individual ultimate movie packs.

				I use a whole chicken whenever I want to save some cash.<br /><br />For Two:<br />Meal #1 Roasted chicken w/ roasted baby potatoes. Just rub the bird and potatoes with a mixture of olive oil, juice of one lemon, salt and pepper. I add rosemary (fresh) if I have it and put the lemon halves inside the chicken as it roasts. We both eat the thigh/leg quarters.<br /><br />Lunch:<br />Slice off some of the breast to use in a salad. If it was a big bird, I can get enough for two lunches.<br /><br />Meal #2<br />Pick all the meat off the bird and shred it. Grab a skillet and heat it up on the stove with some bbq sauce. Grab two buns from the deli and you have bbq pulled chicken sandwiches.<br /><br />Take the carcass and make a stock, though I usually skip this step.<br /><br />Whole Foods has them on sale a lot, so you can get good quality ones too!

				Thanks! This week I had a craving for chicken cutlets.

				Roasted chicken is one of my BF&#039;s favorite dishes!&nbsp; Last Sunday-since it wasn&#039;t too hot, I decided to roast a whole chicken ( a &quot;broiler&quot;-don&#039;t like the &quot;roasters&quot;). I always kosher mine by letting it soak in cold water for a bit, drain, then sprinkle lots of kosher salt all over it, and then let it sit for 45 minutes or so. This process alone makes for a real tasty bird! I always mince lots of garlic, mix it with some cold butter in a bowl and stick the mixture under the chicken skin- the breast, back, thighs, drumstick-wherever you can loosen the skin, throw some whole peeled cloves of garlic into the cavity and squeeze lots of lemon juice over it, sprinkle with salt and pepper. Then with the drippings I make beer gravy. Yum! We had leftover breast meat and the next day I just heated the slices in a pan with the leftover beer gravy. Don&#039;t forget the mashed potatoes and peas - great comfort food!

				The beer gravy is the best part of the meal! First I mix about 2 tablespoons of corn starch into 1 cup of beer. I pour the drippings into a small sauce pan, reheat, and pour the beer (with corn starch) into it and stir until thickened. Add a little salt to taste.

				This weekend I made a pretty decent soup. I started off making a pot of white beans - brought dry beans and water to a boil, let them sit, drained them, and then started again with fresh water, a whole peeled onion, and a couple of bay leaves. <br /><br />when the beans were tender I added sauteed onions, garlic and carrots, a chopped tomato, salt, pepper, dried herbs, and pasta. I removed the onion and bay leaf, chopped up the by now very soft onion, and put it back in the soup pot. It tastes pretty good.

I cooked the pork shoulder with some onions and garlic (for a long time, in a covered pot).

				Well, for potato freaks - have you ever made shepherd&#039;s pie? <br /><br />My mom used to make it when I was a kid. Her recipe involved cream of mushroom soup and some mixed veggies, cooked with onions and ground beef. that mixture would go in the bottom of the pie dish, and the mashed potatoes would form a crust on the top - and cheese would go on the potatoes. <br /><br />There are other versions that don&#039;t involve the cream of mushroom soup, though - here&#039;s one (http://lakemagazine.com/recipes/recipedetail.asp?id=LID-ZYLIV)

Cut the green pepper first and sauté it in the vegetable oil, and as it&#039;s cooking cut up the garlic and onions. The pepper should sauté on low-medium heat for at least 10 minutes before adding the garlic and onions, and those should cook for a few minutes. Before you add anything else, the peppers should be starting to look cooked and the onions should be softening. <br /><br />While that&#039;s cooking, cut up the mushrooms and then add those at the appropriate time and mix it all around. Open up the tomatoes and break them into the mix, including the juice from the can, and then add the two cans of beans. (You may want to drain the bean juice, but I like leaving in some of it. I like the organic beans from Key Food; the juice in the other stuff skeeves me.) Then add the spices. Then add the bulgar wheat. Add as much of the bulgar as you think you want - for me it serves to provide a meaty texture without being &quot;fake meat,&quot; but the chili shouldn&#039;t be overwhelmed by it, so if I were to measure it I think it&#039;s around 1/4 cup. <br /><br />The wheat will absorb the juice from the tomatoes and bean cans. This should all simmer for at least 20 minutes. Stir it occasionally and taste it to make sure you like the spice level. Add whatever other spices you want; keep in mind that the chili that results from this is not spicy at all, but it is tasty. If you like spicy chili you will need to add your own spicy things. Simmer until it&#039;s not so liquidy and the mushrooms have shrunk. I like serving it with rice, and I cook the rice in a method inspired by Chipotle, which is to cook it with fresh cilantro and lime.

				I came here to post a ground beef thing I had for dinner last night and it is really kind of similar to the beef picadillo recipe that IrishJess posted. Anyway, here goes: <br /><br />Yesterday I started craving ground beef around lunchtime. On my way home I got a cheap package of ground chuck and some mushrooms. I think this is what you would call &quot;hash&quot;. <br /><br />Brown ground beef and one diced onion. Drain off the grease (or rinse the meat in a strainer if you really want to get the fat off). Set aside. <br /><br />Sautee diced green pepper, chopped scallions, garlic, diced potato, currants, and sliced mushrooms. I threw all of this stuff in together, I later wished I had cooked the mushrooms first, then added the other stuff. Toss it around a bit, add some spices (paprika, chili powder), cover and add a little water. When the potatoes are tender, add the beef, some chopped fresh parsley and dill, and a few canned tomatoes with juice. You don&#039;t want to make it into a tomato sauce, just add a little flavor. Maybe a quarter or half a cup. Salt, pepper, adjust seasonings. <br /><br />this would be really good wrapped in a tortilla, stuffed in a pita, or over rice. I had it as-is, in a bowl with a glop of yogurt on top.

				Great thread, and definitely one I could use as a 20-something!<br /><br />Here&#039;s a few &quot;frugal&quot; things I do:<br />1) Save money. I have a Vanguard IRA Roth that I opened a few years ago and while it&#039;s depressing to look at right now, in a few years it will be up again, since the economy is always cyclical. I also have a 401(k) through work where I allot 7% of my paycheck and my job matches 3%. Lastly, I have a general savings account through ING Direct, though I&#039;ve been touching it a bit more lately than I&#039;d like (moving and whatnot).<br />2) Avoid credit cards. I paid off my debt and now I only use it for small purchases that I can pay back within a few weeks. I heard that it&#039;s good to always keep it active so that&#039;s what I&#039;m trying to do minimally.<br />3) Pack lunch, eat in more. I&#039;ve found that if I have no cash in my wallet, I&#039;m less likely to splurge on snacks and food in the city. It kind of serves as a &quot;hint hint, you didn&#039;t put cash in here for a reason&quot; to my brain.<br />4) Go to the library for books, CDs, etc. Ends up saving me a lot of money. I also use Netflix and try to only go to the movies as matinees.<br /><br />Here are my &quot;least frugal&quot; expenses: <br />1) The cost of food. I&#039;m a vegetarian and I try to eat healthy -- but organic food is a lot of money. I save money from buying healthy and cooking vs going out regularly, but not as much as I would if I were content to live on mac &amp; cheese and ramen. It&#039;s a tricky situation.<br />2) Girly stuff. I go to the salon every 6-8 weeks and I try and get a facial once every 6-8 weeks. Spas and salons are a lot of money so I try not to drastically overdo it, but what can I say, I love them.<br />3) Travel. I love NYC but if I don&#039;t get away from it fairly often, I start to feel bonkers. I just got back from a trip to Austin, where I had somewhere to stay, so that saved some money. I also try and take weekend trips when I can every few months. Staying put for long stretches of time is not an option for me, but I recognize there&#039;s ways to lower costs by visiting friends, sharing rooms, etc. <br />4) My cat. I adore the little hairball but pet expenses sure do add up. Wouldn&#039;t trade it for the world though.<br /><br />So those are my good and my not-so-good lists. I pretty much spend one paycheck a month on rent/bills and the other on assorted things throughout the month, so I just about breakeven when all is said and done. I&#039;m good at long-term saving plans and avoiding debt, but I find it very hard to save liquid cash. My paychecks pretty much go up in smoke minus the 401k allotments.<br />

				I did this the other day and cut down on my grocery bills this month. I tend to &quot;shop&quot; when I go to the grocery instead of only picking up what I need:<br /><br />Look in your cupboards, fridge and freezer.<br />Take stock of everything you have.<br />Come up with as many dinner options as you can based on what is there with very little to buy, less than $20.<br />Write down a menu list for the week, or however long it takes you to eat what&#039;s there.<br />Check off each meal as you go.<br /><br />I did this and I had over a week of meals!<br />

				Costco is my greatest grocery shopping friend. I get meat for the freezer there: a lamb roast gets cut in thirds and makes three meals for two of us - sometimes with a leftover serving for lunch the next day. A pork loin or large package of chops gets divided into freezer bags and makes multiple meals. Same for chicken, beef roasts, ground beef, etc. MUCH cheaper than buying one meal at a time and good quality.<br />I do the same for veggies: yesterday I got a huge bag of spinach, four cups for a soup I was making, another 3-4 cups went in the refrigerator for salads or a pesto later this week, the rest filled two freezer bags and went in the freezer. I can pull out a handfull whenever I want some hidden veggie in whatever I&#039;m making. I also bought a bag of green beans; I&#039;ll make a couple of servings fresh and put the rest in baggies in the freezer. <br />Also their huge boxes of lettuce - even if you don&#039;t eat it all, its still MUCH cheaper than buying a bag or small box at a grocery store. <br />And the same thing for paper products, although they are a little harder to store. But the cost of a 12 pack of paper towels is about the same as 4 or 5 rolls at Duane Reade! Stick them under the bed if you have to. <br /><br />And I agree with the person who said clean out your cupboards before you buy anything more... My mom can make a meal with what seems to me almost nothing - it&#039;s that Depression era mentality and we&#039;re going to have it too one of these days...<br /><br />Beth<br />

				I partly agree with cleaning out your cupboards, but if you clean them completely out then you are going to have to spend a fair amount of money on more food. I&#039;ve used that strategy when I was desperately broke and just trying to make it to the next payday, but using up your resources just to use them up is not a frugal strategy. <br /><br />I do think it&#039;s a great idea to go through and see what items have been sitting around for a long time and use them up. That gets you a meal - or several -&nbsp; and creates more space. <br /><br />I guess there&#039;s a question as to what frugality means to you and what role it plays in your life. Is it something you do out of desperation and necessity for the short-term? Is it a long-term financial strategy? Something else? I&#039;d been interested to hear how other people think about it. <br /><br /><strong>So frugal astorians, What does frugality mean to you?</strong>

				This is a recipe I love - it&#039;s super cheap, great for cold weather, and need very little attention thanks to the crockpot! It&#039;s originally from Slow Cooker Cooking by Lora Brody. <br /><br />French Onion Soup<br /><br />3 pounds Vidalia or other sweet onions - peeled and cut into 1/8-1/4&quot; thick slices<br />1 stick butter<br />6 cups beef, chicken, or vegetable stock<br />Salt and pepper, to taste<br />Bread of choice (I prefer a crusty french baguette)<br />Cheese of choice (I do a mix of swiss and locatelli cheeses)<br /><br />Put the onions and butter in the slow cooker for 12-14 hours on low. They should be a deep dark brown mahogany and very soft. Afterwards, drain the onions, reserving the liquid that has accumulated. (After you let the liquid cool, you can skim the congealed butter from the top of the onion broth and use it to flavor another dish). Then combine onions, cooking liquid, and stock in a pot, bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Then ladle soup into ovenproof bowls, float a slice of bread in it, top with cheese, and put in the broiler until the cheese melts and starts to bubble. It only takes 1-2 minutes in my broiler. Enjoy!<br /><br />Since I make my own chicken stock and always have cheese and butter in stock, it usually only costs me around 7 dollars to make a huge potful of soup.

				I originally put it into community groups figuring that we would kind cohese into a community. We&#039;re part-way there, I think. But i admit that I never got around to organizing regular Frugal Astoria meetings. Partly because it&#039;s too cold to be really frugal and go to the park rather than spend $$ on drinks. <br /><br />What do guys think? Are we about randomly posting and reading frugal tips when we are in a pinch, or are we about forging connections and supporting each other in being super-cheap?

				I shop nearly every night on my way home, since I like to buy fresh produce. Before it goes bad, freeze it- currently, I&#039;ve got 3/4 of a baguette in the freezer, plus a Ziploc full of sliced mushrooms, broccoli, and other leftover vegetables. They thaw more quickly than frozen vegetables (does that make sense?!) <br /><br />Had some chopped potatoes leftover from last night&#039;s soup, put those in the &#039;fridge- they&#039;ll make good home fries or something.<br /><br />Always have wheat bread at home so I can make pb&amp;j sandwiches for work. That saves a bunch. As would eating breakfast at home, but my morning coffee/donut or eggs on a roll........can&#039;t seem to break that habit!!<br /><br />Speaking of which, instead of a diner brunch, I&#039;m just fine with the $2 deli special on the weekends- coffee and eggs/roll (no meat.) It&#039;s delicious and satisfying, though the coffee isn&#039;t the best.<br /><br />I&#039;ve cut back severely on bottled drinks, but when I do splurge, I water them down (drink half/add water.) Sometimes, I take the empty bottle home and make my own herbal iced tea, not bad!<br /><br />Also- mojito or margarita mix in a bottle. $3-4 a bottle gets you a couple weeks&#039; worth of drinks (I hate plain water unless I&#039;m working out in warm weather.) A small bit of the mix in water suits me just fine.<br /><br />As for shopping- rarely, unless there&#039;s a sale or I really need stuff. I&#039;m a &quot;return-ista&quot;; if I spend too much, I can&#039;t stand the guilt. <br /><br />I have an $80 couch (not including delivery) from the antique/thrift place nearby; a gently-used Jennifer convertible that I paid $50 for somebody to help move; Ikea loft bed (twin, b/c I already had a small mattress) for $125, holding up great after 9 years; two storage ottomans for $110 each from QVC; bookshelves from the Ikea scratch-and-dent section (at least 50% off).......<br /><br />OH, and cars. I inherit them before they go to the dump, and are surprisingly reliable despite the occasional high maintenance bill. Not much to look at, though! The car I have now was dented before; just got MORE dented again while parked. But there&#039;s a certain comfort to driving a car that you don&#039;t need to worry about.<br /><br />I&#039;m also not a gear-head, as it&#039;s crazy to spend $$$ on electronics that are quickly obselete. Has happened enough that I&#039;m sick of it!!<br /><br />What else, what else....student haircuts, henna instead of chemical/professional coloring; homemade facial scrubs; no maincures (they don&#039;t last) but the occasional pedicure is an occasional indulgence.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I suggest choosing an avenue or a street and walking the length of it (predetermining what the outer boundary is, if it goes out of our neighborhood).&nbsp; There&#039;s always parts of a street or avenue that someone has never seen, and parts that you wouldn&#039;t want to walk through by yourself, and it&#039;s a guarantee that you&#039;ll see some interesting little thing that you can only find by walking past it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I suggest starting at the outer end and concluding at the river end.&nbsp; I think most streets and avenues need two walks because continously crossing the street can drive you crazy, and you really want to see both sides.&nbsp; Walking is the greatest joy of living in Astoria.<br /><br />As for eats, people can bring nibbles to have along the way, and an agreement should be made in advance that any place the walkers stop in to eat that day should be the kind of establishment that accomodates very small budgets (such as one slice of pizza and a soda).
