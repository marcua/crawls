				Former White House Press Secretary Died of Colon Cancer<br />Tony Snow, a conservative political commentator who seemed to relish his brief stint as President Bush&#039;s White House press secretary, died in Washington, D.C., on Saturday of colon cancer at the age of 53. &quot;America has lost a devoted public servant and a man of character,&quot; President Bush said in a statement from Camp David, where he was spending the weekend. &quot;It was a joy to watch Tony at the podium each day. He brought wit, grace, and a great love of country to his work.&quot; Bush said his... <br /><br />Tony&nbsp; Snow was much more than what is described above, we corresponded, as we both we fighting the&nbsp; good fight on a whole host of levels. Sadly, Tony&nbsp; lost his&nbsp; struggle with&nbsp; cancer. Tony&nbsp; was&nbsp; a&nbsp; musician, we both had mutual respect&nbsp; with Jethro Tull&#039;s frontman Ian Anderson, which Snow had jammed with onstage. He was&nbsp; a&nbsp; good man, who loved his family, country, and life itself and gave courage to those&nbsp; who were&nbsp; fighting this series&nbsp; of&nbsp; dreaded&nbsp; disease, under&nbsp; the umbrella of the term cancer. Anyone , who has&nbsp; lost someone&nbsp; to cancer, know how devastating and frightening it is&nbsp; to all involved. I hope&nbsp; his freinds and family find some small comfort in the knowledge&nbsp; that Tony Snow is no longer suffering. May he rest in eternal peace. Thanks, Tony, bye.&nbsp; :cry:

				I was saddened to hear about his passing. It&#039;s not a good sign when colon cancer recurs, the odds where definitely against him, he put up a valiant fight. He was the best spinner of Bush&#039;s press secretaries. Not sure whether I would categorize a man who can present Bush&#039;s lies better than anyone as a man of character though.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hey. it&#039;s any press secretary&#039;s job to &quot;spin the facts&quot; that they&#039;re given, otherwise that job title wouldn&#039;t even exist. I&#039;m not really sure what to make of that as a character point, but it&#039;s irrelevant.<br />Cancer sucks, it&#039;s a terrible disease. It&#039;s really f_cked that this country invests more research into erectile dysfunction than cancer. I hope he went painlessly, as I hear colon cancer can be extremely painful. <br />My wishes go out to his family and friends, and I hope we find a cure for this nasty disease soon.
