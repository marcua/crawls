				2 gals in their 20&#39;s looking for a roommate to fill in the third bedroom. Share is $746 + one month&#39;s security deposit. Room available is very cozy, big enough for a twin bed(queen if you push it), dresser and bookshelf. Apartment itself is fully furnished. If all you have is stuff for your room, this apartment is perfect for you. Utilities are shared, about $85/mo each. That includes basic con ed, phone with DSL, and satellite TV(third room can be set up for your own box). Apartment is on the second floor of an 8 unit building. Very close to all. Seriously, we are in walking distance of: trains, movie theatre, starbucks, lounges, upscale diner, bars, restaurants, museum, movie studio and more.<br /><br />we are very chill and laid back looking for the same. both employed, although different shifts. we are neat and clean without being insane about it. we are smoke and &quot;smoke&quot; friendly. looking for someone copacetic with that. we respect each others space and stuff. we are looking for someone who fits in with our vibe. not looking for our best friend, but we would like to be friends with our roommate.<br /><br />if this sounds good to you, shoot us an email and tell us about yourself and what you&#39;re looking for in a space and roommates. 37th st at 34th ave <br /><br />firelight79@cs.com

				I noticed your ad on astorians.net and I was wondering whether you gals knew if there was any other available 3 bedrooms in your building. I have 3 professional guys who are looking to share the same kind of gig.&nbsp; It&#39;s super hard to come by a 3 bedroom within reason. I&#39;d appreciate the holler back.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Irene

				as of right now, no.<br />if the dudes on the top floor move out, i&#39;ll post.<br />a lot of the other apartments are two bedrooms, it&#39;s just that where our 3rd room is, a bigger kitchen/dining room is. so in the more recently vacated(read old tennants move out)apartments he&#39;s converted that space to a &quot;comfy&quot; (read small, and great for a minimalist) 3rd room so he can charge for a 3BR rather than a 2BR.<br />leave it to my landlord to try and find a way to make a quick buck.<br />J

				oh by the way, we rented the room in record time.<br />it&#39;s great when people move out of their parent&#39;s homes, a small room doesn&#39;t seem so bad.<br />and well, jamie(not the jamie from this board) and i are a killer draw(not that board jamie isn&#39;t killer).<br />J
