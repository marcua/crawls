				I second the question.<br /><br />And if there's nothing better here, I know of two good studios in Manhattan that charge well under $17/hour.

				I guess no &quot;reasonably&quot; priced local yoga facilities have been offered. I wanted to jump in on this before it slipped off the page here. <br />&nbsp;I agree that $17 per ...session...I guess, is a bit pricey. Another gripe I had with the Yoga practiced in the local gyms, first you have to be a member, and secondly, even when I was a member I found that they were just too fast, scheduled on the hour, or half hour between step arobics and salsa dancing. I wanted something that you could really relax a stretch into, without rushing. Anything within a relatively easy subway/bus ride in the area that would fit? Looks like Astoria is fresh out of options here.

				studio y wellness (http://www.studioywellness.com) on 23rd street and 24th avenue offers classes for $16 per session, but if you buy their &quot;monthly&quot; pass it's $15 per class (5 classes, good for one month).

				There is this place that offers them for 12$ a class last time I recall. And the owner Mark Stempi is really nice. Even offers morning classes. It is a small place but has a nice set up. I don't recall the street but if you walk down Broadway toward 45th St. there is a chinese food place on the left. It is the same block as that place. You make a left and it is a couple doors down. &nbsp;Fusion Phone 718-956-1285

				Sivananda is good - I love the relaxed atmosphere and the smells of incense and vegan cooking and the nice polite &quot;Beloved Student - Please Enter at the Other Door&quot; signs. &nbsp;http://www.sivananda.org/ny/ &nbsp;and they've got a &quot;first class free&quot; offer for the new year - nice! &nbsp;1 1/2 hour classes are $12 for non-members. &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />I also hear good things about Sonic Yoga. &nbsp;www.sonicyoga.com &nbsp;- a bit closer.

				Ya know...unless you are a deciple of the swammi or something you are truely not likely to travel downtown or even midtown unless you work there to do some &quot;cheap&quot; yoga. I would be interested in trying anything within a reasonable walk from the N/W line here in Astoria.

				We used to do yoga about 5 years ago with a great guy on St. Marks for $10 2hours . It was great, no candles or fancy lighting but real people. He's gon back to India and was thinking of coming to Astoria once we told him about my husband's office space and how they have available spaces and cheaper than the city.<br /><br />We were happy to see that Ana at Studio Y Wellness opened on 23rd and 24th Ave. but she has had to close up because the rent was hard to pay. Since then I have tried to help her find another place. She was thinking of checking out Bohemian Hall and passing he savings onto the clients since the cost is a big issue. <br /><br />I would love to find a place for her to start up again, we need to support these ventures if we hope to have then around for us.<br /><br />If you know of a place please let me know I can get in touch with her and perhaps we can have a more modestly priced yoga place.<br /><br />I suggested she approach the folks at Ricardos catering hall or the children's exercise place on 27th and 23rd Ave.

				Bohemian Hall would be a great option, I think. &nbsp;<br /><br />Otherwise ... I don't know how things work in this neighborhood but back in Tulsa there were several churches who would people have yoga/folk dancing/whatever classes in their rooms.<br /><br />In the summer, when the weather is nice, there's always the park.<br /><br />Please keep us posted on what turns out with that....

				Socrates Sculpture Park offers free yoga classes every Saturday from 11-12 between May 21st and August 27th. &nbsp;They teach the Kripalu system and you have to bring your own mat. &nbsp;They also offer Tai Chi on Sundays from 11-12, same dates by someone from the Taoist Tai Chi Society.<br /><br />here's the link:<br />http://www.socratessculpturepark.org/Education/Education05.htm#yoga<br /><br />SSP also has great films outdoors on Wednesday nights in July and August, also free.<br /><br />Re finding space, approaching the churches <em>is</em> a good idea. &nbsp;(my two cents)

				Hey, at The Yoga Room, you can get classes for less than $17 each if you get a package. &nbsp;The first time I went there, I got 3 classes for $25, then I bought a 10 pack for $135, so each class comes to $13.50. &nbsp;They also have unlimited monthlies which are great if you practice everyday.

				I've gone three or four times and it's always like that. You really can't get into it when you're always worred about clocking your neighbor in the face by accident. Thei'r LIC location might be less crowded, but I think Greg's classes are you best bet in the neighb. I'm not sure if Studio Y is still open. Does anyone know? They didn't respond to an email I sent recently.

				The morning classes are not usually too crowded. &nbsp;Also, Wed 4PM is a good time to go. &nbsp;Night classes get crowded with the 9-5 crowd, but if you can get there early and at least get a good spot in the class, it's fine.

				On the gym thing... the yoga classes at The Rock are actually pretty good. &nbsp;I think they're all an hour and a half now. &nbsp;I pop into Anne Margaret's class on Wednesday often. &nbsp;I think she's opening an independent place elsewhere in Astoria. &nbsp;I'll post it after I get a chance to find out from her.
