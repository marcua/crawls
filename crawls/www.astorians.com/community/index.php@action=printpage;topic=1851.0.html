				first they laugh,<br />I was doubtful and skeptical, but lo and behold more news <br /><br />(thinking of Easter, and getting hungry)<br /><br />(the suggested curriculum seems very balanced and might even satisfy some food pyramid guidelines)<br /><br />&nbsp;:lol:<br /><br />http://www.kentucky.com/mld/kentucky/living/religion/14165128.htm<br /><br /><br /><br />In Spaghetti Monster they trust<br />Is God a flying ball of pasta? It&#39;s one theory -- just like intelligent design<br />By Jim Beckerman<br />KNIGHT RIDDER NEWS SERVICE<br />HACKENSACK, N.J. - Unlike a certain other religion in the news, the First United Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster doesn&#39;t object to cartoon depictions of the supreme being.<br /><br />For one thing, he&#39;s easy to draw: a tangle of pasta strands with a meatball body.<br /><br />In some pictures, he is shown reaching out to confer the blessings of life and happiness with what church members like to refer to as his &quot;noodly appendage.&quot;<br /><br />Flying Spaghetti Monster could be the next big thing on the pop culture menu.<br /><br />His al dente visage can be seen on T-shirts, coffee mugs, magnets, flags, computer games. His Buitoni No. 10 tentacles can be seen reaching out to Adam in a Photoshop version of Michelangelo&#39;s Creation, and to the disciples in Da Vinci&#39;s Last Supper. &quot;Flying Spaghetti Monster Bless America&quot; appears on bumper stickers.<br /><br />He even has his own Bible: The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, to be published Tuesday from Random House. It&#39;s written by his foremost prophet, Bobby Henderson, who launched this satiric dig at so-called intelligent design about a year ago, and lived to see it take on a life of its own.<br /><br />&quot;It&#39;s amazing that a satirical monster could get this big, but then, he did create the universe,&quot; says Dee Dee McKinney, content administrator for the FSM online discussion forum and the reclusive Henderson&#39;s primary mouthpiece.<br /><br />Henderson, a 25-year-old physicist and graduate of Oregon State University, conceived of the Flying Spaghetti Monster last year as a reductio ad absurdum of the intelligent design argument for inclusion in curriculums.<br /><br />According to intelligent design boosters, since evolution is only a &quot;theory&quot; and not provable, an alternative -- that the universe was created by an intelligent designer -- should be given equal time in science classes.<br /><br />The &quot;alternative&quot; they presumably had in mind was Christianity.<br /><br />But, said Henderson to some chums over beers, by the same logic the &quot;intelligent designer&quot; could just as easily be, say, a Flying Spaghetti Monster.<br /><br />It was only a short step to what happened next.<br /><br />Last summer, as the Kansas School Board was having a fierce debate over whether information about intelligent design should be required in public school curriculums (in November, the board voted 6-4 in favor), board members received an odd letter:<br /><br />&quot;Let us remember that there are multiple theories of intelligent design,&quot; it read in part. &quot;I and many others around the world are of the strong belief that the universe was created by a Flying Spaghetti Monster. It was He who created all that we see and all that we feel. ... It is for this reason that I&#39;m writing you today, to formally request that this alternative theory be taught in your schools, along with the other two theories.&quot;<br /><br />Members of the Dover, Pa., school board, voted out of office in November for supporting a measure similar to Kansas&#39;, also heard from the Spaghetti Monster.<br /><br />But Henderson didn&#39;t stop with letters. He also created a Web site, venganza.org, as a rallying place for what were quickly dubbed &quot;Pastafarians.&quot; While there are officially 3,332 &quot;church&quot; members worldwide, based on online response, the real number is doubtless much higher, McKinney says.<br /><br />&quot;We got one e-mail from a guy from Italy, who speaks almost no English, who wants to start a European seminary to train priests for the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster,&quot; McKinney says. &quot;The fact is, we don&#39;t have a priesthood. Our church is a very bottom-up structure.&quot;<br /><br />Some Pastafarians are just people looking for the Next Big Quirky Thing -- the kind of free spirits who gravitate to things like the Church of the Subgenius or the Church of Stop Shopping.<br /><br />Others are students -- sincerely troubled by the rise of fundamentalism and its impact on education.<br /><br />&quot;I think it&#39;s a brilliant concept, and I&#39;ve been trying to promote the idea,&quot; says David Linley, a 15-year-old high school student who discovered the Web site in October.<br /><br />&quot;I&#39;ve just been disgusted by some of the pseudo-science I&#39;ve seen,&quot; Linley says. Finding the site, he says, was a &quot;wake-up call.&quot;<br /><br />In addition to keeping tabs on the anti-science right and hawking various Flying Spaghetti Monster paraphernalia, the site also lampoons the kind of pseudo-science, bolstered by dubious charts and graphs, favored by creationists in books like Of Pandas and People.<br /><br />One favorite chart correlates the rise of global warming with the decline of pirates. That explains the &quot;pirate&quot; iconography -- eye patches and cutlasses -- that goes hand-in-noodle with the church&#39;s spaghetti-and-meatball motif.<br /><br />Naturally, the Web site gets plenty of hate mail from the devout. &quot;You&#39;re an idiot. I&#39;ll pray for you,&quot; one message read.<br /><br />&quot;They send Bobby threatening letters, they curse him, they call him a blankety-blankety-blank-blank,&quot; McKinney says. &quot;And at the end, they say God loves him.&quot;<br /><br />Most people -- pro and con -- assume that the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the creation of atheists, or at the very least agnostics.<br /><br />Actually, McKinney is a Christian, and Henderson won&#39;t say one way or the other.<br /><br />&quot;It&#39;s appalling what has been done and what has happened to my religion in the name of politics,&quot; McKinney says.<br /><br />With the money from the Spaghetti Monster book, McKinney says, the &quot;church&quot; is planning its major investment: a pirate ship that can go from port to port, spreading the word about His Noodleness.<br /><br />&quot;It would go from place to place, so (church) members could come to visit,&quot; McKinney says. &quot;And they&#39;re hoping to make cannons. Some say it should fire T-shirts. The other half say it should be meatballs.&quot;<br />
