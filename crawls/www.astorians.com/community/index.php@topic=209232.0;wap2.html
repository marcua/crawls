			Now open for submissions<br />for our 17th issue!<br />Newtown Literary was founded in 2012 by a small group of Queens<br />writers who wanted to create a written record of the literary work that<br />was being done in the borough. We are dedicated to sustaining a journal<br />that showcases excellent poetry and prose from a diverse group of writers<br />either born or living in Queens, NY.<br />Queens is home to one of the most diverse communities of people in the<br />world, and Newtown Literary strives to be a literary forum reflecting our<br />borough. Emerging and experienced scribes of all types will find a home<br />in Newtown Literary, and we are especially interested in making space<br />for words from those who are marginalized elsewhere. Furthermore, we<br />hope to reflect the linguistic variety of Queens. We also seek to include<br />the entirety of the geographic space of Queens and encourage<br />submissions from Far Rockaway to Astoria, Bayside to Ridgewood.<br />www.newtownliterary.org/submit<br />Submissions deadline: July 10th, 2020
