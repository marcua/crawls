								<div class="inner" id="msg_587">I found the email with the list, a little more then 101 things. I also found a dozen patterns to crochet with plastic bags including some pretty angels. I will post all my plastic crochet stuff in the pattern section later. For now here is the list.<br /><br />Plastic bag wonderland. What to do with them all? <br /><br />Plastic bags, the kind you get from the grocery store and the department store and the drug store, have only been around a few years. They have pretty much replaced brown paper bags (which were quite useful, too). <br />Cheerfully colorful and abundant everywhere you go, the plastic bag is a raw resource for modern society - at least for those who are creative enough to see the possibilities in them. Look past the form to the material and past the material to the form and you'll see why they are so useful. <br /><br />According to Society of Plastics Industry, 80% of consumers recycle plastic bags for &quot;household wastebaskets, shoe totes and laundry or garment bags.&quot; <br /><br />If you're one of the 80%, it's time to expand your horizons! There are lots more ways to use those bags. <br /><br />1. Cut bags into strips and crochet, knit, weave, or needlepoint a door mat for wet days, or a tub or shower mat. <br />&nbsp;<br />2. Wear between your socks and shoes to keep your feet dry whether your shoes stay dry or not. <br /><br />3. Use larger ones to line trash cans. Gladys adds: Keep a few extra in the bottom of the trashcan, so there is always another one to put in.<br />&nbsp;<br />4. Use as disposable gloves for tasks that don't need fine finger use. <br /><br />5. Cover a paint brush with plastic bags when you go for a break, or even overnight. Make sure the bag is closed tightly and your paint won't dry out on the brush. <br /><br />6. Carry one or more with you when you go walking to pick up aluminum cans, trash or treasure. <br /><br />7. Keep a few grocery bags in your car to tie around your knees in case you have to change a flat tire in your good clothes. <br /><br />8. If you don't lay them out flat, but wrinkle them up, they are good packing material when moving, sending packages, or storing Christmas stuff. <br /><br />9. Carry a few in the diaper bag to hold soiled clothes and wet/dirty diapers. <br /><br />10. Put extra dirty rags in a plastic grocery bag and tie a knot with the handles and dump in laundry bag without fear of making everything else smelly or dirty. <br /><br />11. Put delicate (or easily dirtied) clothes you will clean later or bring to the drycleaner in grocery bag and tie a knot with the handles and dump in laundry bag without fear of having them get dirtier or smellier than they already are. <br /><br />12. Use dark garbage bag to cover more expensive stuff sitting on back seat or behind front seats in your car. <br /><br />13. Use plastic bags instead of saranwrap to put pizza or other solid food in refrigerator. <br /><br />14. Return them to grocery store: sometimes they give money for them (like 5 cents each). <br /><br />15. Use them when walking your dog to clean up deposits. With your hand inside the bag, pick up the pile, then turn the bag inside out while still on your hand, tie and drop in the trash. <br /><br />16. Sponge paint with them instead of buying an expensive sea sponge. Crumple, dip in roller pan, dab on paper, and apply randomly to the wall. <br /><br />17. One reader bought a bed skirt at Goodwill that came with pillow shams. She didn't have extra pillows to put in them, and she didn't want to spend extra money for them, so she took a couple of old pillowcases, stuffed them full of plastic bags, pinned shut with safety pins, and popped into the shams. As they flatten out, she can add more bags. These are not comfortable to lay on, but for decoration, you cannot tell the difference. <br /><br />18. Sometimes this reader takes popcorn to work as a snack. She carries it in an reused bread bag. <br /><br />19. This reader's son wears cloth diapers at home, but has to use disposables at daycare. Sometimes after they get home, he has a BM in his disposable. To keep odors down, she wraps the diaper in the plastic bag the diapers came in, or in a grocery store bag. These go into the trash can. Same principle as the Diaper Genie, but less expense and waste. <br /><br />20. Plastic bags make a good filler for craft projects that require stuffing as long as the item is not going to be used as a toy or cushion. Left over yarn pieces and strips of plastic bags do a great job in such decorative items as Christmas ornaments that require some type of stuffing to give them shape . <br /><br />21. This reader's niece made a lovely holiday wreath from plastic bags....she got a wire rim from a craft store and tied each bag around the rim and then 'fluffed' them after she squeezed as many as she could onto the wire rim......then added one large red ribbon and several bunches of holly berries.<br />Added to by another reader: (Use a wire clothes hangar for the base, just bend it into a circle, (and keep the top for hanging, if you wish cut plastic bags in wide strips and tie on it, then glue ornaments to them.). <br /><br />22. For a foot-beauty treatment apply any kind of creme or lotion to all areas of toes and feet, then cover with a plastic bag tied loosely, then a sock over that. Wear around the house or to bed. <br /><br />23. One reader says that handled grocery bags make great refrigerator storage containers for large bowls of food. She just puts the bowl or pan at the bottom of the bag, pulls it up over the sides and ties it. She also uses the same handle tie grocery bags to put raw meat or poultry in the refrigerator so they can't leak onto the shelves and cause bacteria problems. <br /><br />24. Make braided rag rugs from all those plastic grocery bags!<br /><br />Cut off the bottoms and tops (handles) <br />Cut across the bag to make a loop (cutting across the middle) <br />Take 3 pieces and begin to braid <br />Add in strips as needed <br />When you have a nice braid going start at the beginning of the braid and start rolling it into the rug shape. <br />Use something to sew it into place - thread, fishing line, string, etc.. <br />Make rug as large as you want it <br />She says - you can use these as door mats, throw rugs, put them in your garden, patio, greenhouse etc...... (they are water safe ;) )<br /><br />25. Another reader saw artists re-using plastic bags in Europe to crochet lovely clutch bags and costume accessories like bar pins, buttons, hair clutches, etc. She says - Plastic bags were cleaned, sorted according to colors and cut into thread-like pieces and wound like yarn. They would crochet this plastic thread, mixing and matching colors into useful objects like clutch bags. I saw a wall tapestry crocheted from plastic bag yarn! To create a smooth look, the artists would run an iron placed on very low setting over the finished crafts. I have in my collection of east European souvenirs a clutch bag made from the plastic bags of one of the top department stores in Bucharest. <br />In the Philippines, this reader saw local seamstresses recycle plastic bags this way: out of fabric remnants, they would sew tote bags, then plastic bags were carefully cut into flat panels, gathered into layers of three and used as 'batting' to give the totes waterproof quality. <br /><br />26. Third graders in this reader's children's school use plastic bags as material to make sails of boats and ships or lion's mane or horse's tails in their arts and crafts and recycle-reuse courses. <br /><br />27. A frugal journalist uses plastic bags from newspapers as file keeper and clipping organizer. When he clips his newspapers for stories and ideas, he encases these newsclips in the plastic sleeves, cut nicely to fit a 3-ring binder, closing with a wee bit of masking tape. <br /><br />28. Another reader writes that her son cleans the litter box a little faster and easier, by putting the mess in the bag and taking it straight outside. <br /><br />29. This reader's mom uses plastic bags to store sweaters, sweatshirts and other bulky things in her closet. She places the bags into large boxes in order to stack them. I do the same thing, but only to store out-of-season clothing. (Great under the bed, in the attic, etc. - keeps the clothes or what-not clean and bug-free.) <br /><br />30. Another use for plastic grocery bags is to store flour and sugar. Tie each 5 lb sack in a grocery bag and store in a dark place. She says she doesn't know if it's entirely bug-proof, but she's not had any yet! <br /><br />40. Using white grocery bags and permanent markers, you can make ghost wind-socks for halloween decorating. This family sorted all of their grocery bags by colour and made ghosts with white bags, and Frankenstein with grey bags by drawing different facial expressions on each one. Tie string on three sides(using clear packing tape so the plastic does not rip)and hang in the tree or on the patio. <br /><br /><br />41. They also made bows with orange and black garbage bags to decorate the front patio. You can make little pumpkin and ghost pouches to stuff with leaves and hang from branches of the trees. They looked just as nice as the expensive store bought leaf bags. <br /><br />42. The reader's yougest daughter has been saving aluminum cans for recycling and earns a little spending money while she's at it. She wanted to buy a large orange leaf bag with a witch design on it, so she filled it with her pop cans rather then her leaves, set it on the lawn as a decoration and after halloween was over she took the whole thing to the recycle depot.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />43. This reader saw a REALLY unique application using plastic bags - a row home with a fenced front yard where they had bent a rod of some kind and attached it on either side of their gate ...then tied plastic bag strips on the arch - with holly berries and ribbon worked in - it is lovely and waterproof, too! <br />&nbsp;<br />44. Make a hair scrunchie from a bag thats longer than it is wide, by cutting the bottom out and inserting a cut rubber band. Tie the rubber band back together, then pull one end of the bag deeply inside the other, and turn under the raw end. <br /><br />45. This reader uses a plastic bag as a salad spinner. She lines a bag with a light towel or a few papertowels. (She says - just smooth the wet papertowels and hang to dry and reuse.) Place your just washed lettuce/greens inside and spin the bag around and around. If the bag gets wrapped too tightly, let it dangle and spin the other direction to loosen and start spinning again. Centrifugal force works like a charm! <br /><br />46. Another reader tells us that plastic bags can be used to make balloon curtains poof out instead of tissue paper, and the outside effect is just the same. She uses the grocery store size for this. Another reader adds: I hung some pouffy valances over the windows. I wanted them to be really puffed out, so I just stuffed lots of plastic grocery bags in the valances and they are just beautiful. I don't worry about them losing their shape, because the plastic stays in place balled up. <br /><br />47. A reader says that when they put away the Christmas decorations each year, she puts each string of Christmas lights in its own plastic grocery bag and tie shut. No more tangled light strings.<br />&nbsp;<br />48. This reader says when she gets a good clump of grocery store bags (both paper and plastic) she takes them to the local food/clothing bank. They are glad to get them and she knows they are re-used at least once. She's seen that some of the clients bring the bags back for several weeks until worn out. She also drops the bags at her local thrift shop - same principle; and since she buys some clothes there, she returns (or declines in the first place) their bags for reuse! <br /><br />49. Another reader uses them this way: Put several on your hand to serve as protection from poison ivy. Just pull up the plant with the bagged hand, carefully turn bag inside out and dispose of properly. No ivy touches your hand and no poisons are used. <br /><br />50. Another use for the plastic grocery sacks is to donate them to daycare and preschool centers. Many times they use them to send home soiled clothes. <br /><br />51. Another reader says: I bundle them up and take them to the library. They especially need them for rainy days or people checking out videos. They love to see me coming with a bunch. <br /><br />52. I use plastic bags when breading chicken, chops or coating vegetables with flour and cornmeal mixtures. I just put all of my seasoning into the bag, wet the meat or vegetables and let them sit for a while so that the flour coating is thick. Then put it into the hot fat to fry. <br /><br />53. A reader writes this: When you take a loaf of bread out of your bread maker (or out of the oven) pop it directly into a plastic grocery bag. Leave it for about 10-15 minutes, remove it and wrap it in a towel until cool, then return it to a plastic bag for storage. this method gives you a loaf of bread with a nice, soft crust.<br /><br />54. Although this is not a direct use of plastic bags, it has to do with them: I place several of them filled with meat or whatever in a large paper grocery bag to prevent freezer burn and make a list with a permanent marker on the outside of the paper bag so I will know at a glance what is inside. <br /><br />55. When I have to work in a wet garden or other muddy site, I tie plastic grocery bags on the OUTSIDE of my shoes. The mud cannot clump onto the loose plastic like it does to shoes or boots. What a cleanup saver!! <br /><br />56. In the fall after I've cleaned up my fans I cover them with a grocery bag before storing in the garage. Keeps them nice &amp; clean till summer. <br /><br />57. A reader writes: Whenever I take a casserole or other dish of cooked food to a dinner, I put the dish in a double-sack of plastic bags. Center the dish in the bottom; twist the handles and then tie firmly with a twisty or tie the handles. This keeps drippings off of your car floors or seat and keeps foods clean in transport. You also have a handle to carry them to the hostess. <br /><br />58. This reader says: I use these in my van as trash collectors. Instead of buying a small bag that attaches to some part of the car, I loop the bag handles around the seat armrests in the front. Recently I've also put one in the rear of the van which has captains seats. Each time I need to gas up the van, I can throw the whole bag away. <br /><br />59. From another reader: I use them to put leaky containers inside (plastic bottles which don't have a tight seal - I use to transport liquids to work). Once I get there I just toss the bag and wipe off the bottle/container. Saves work and made use of those free bags. <br /><br />60. This reader says: I got tired of finding all kinds of little toys laying around my 4 year olds room and my house so I bought a big storage box and divided her toys into bags: McDonald toys in one, plastic food in another, plastic dishes in another, toy animals in another, etc. and put them into the plastic storage box. Now she is allowed to have 2 bags of toys out at one time and has to put the toys back in the bags and into the storage box before she can get any more toys out. It has cut down on pick up time and stepping on toys all the time.<br />&nbsp;<br />61. This readers says: I use them to create activity kits. I always keep a bag with scraps of fabrics, needles, thread and scissors for impromptu quilting. You can also make rainy day kid activity kits with crayons, paper, glue sticks, etc. These are great for the I'm bored blues or even on road trips. <br /><br />62. Another reader adds: My son is learning how to cook, so I will assemble all of the ingredients for a simple snack or meal and bag them up. It keeps everything together for him and the babysitter. He really looks forward to checking out the fridge to see what new cooking challenge is each afternoon.<br />&nbsp;<br />63. My grownup daughters and I pass magazines, refund items, clothes and whatever between us. Each of us place these items in used plastic bags to be picked up by the owner when she comes to our homes. <br /><br />64. Use freezer bags to store foods cooked in advance such as hot dogs - buns and all - the same goes for hamburgers - just use a microwave to warm them up! <br /><br />65. You can use them with your vacuum cleaner to make your own frugal &quot;shrink and store&quot; bags instead of paying major bucks for the kind with the valve built in. Just fold your blankets, sweaters, whatever neatly and set them in a plastic bag. Twist it around the hose of your vacuum cleaner and suck the air out! To seal, just slide the twisted bag off the hose while twisting it tighter, then fold it over and tape it down. Be careful not to rip the bag! <br /><br />66. Another reader says: I use them with either short stakes or a round of low fencing to protect my early transplants. First I put them over the plants to protect from sun, wind, and at night cold, just with a couple of slits in the top ( the top contracts with the cold and expands with heat to ventilate the young plant.) Then as the plant starts to grow I cut the top of the bag off, by now there should be no frost, but the plastic still acts as a wind break) later I may just pull it down the stakes, or take it off completely. <br /><br />67. I also grab one when I step into the garden; much easier to stuff a few bags in your pocket and pull one out to fill with beets, another with carrots, or some lettuce, oh, and lovely onions. Friends have a non-returnable container in which to take their fresh produce home! <br /><br />68. Still another use is to cut a bag (good for the ones already tearing) into strips to hold vines and canes and other plants in place, just don't tie them too tightly. <br />&nbsp;<br />69. Use them for shower caps. Just find one that fits, or use a larger one and tie it around your head, rolling a cuff to keep it in place better.<br /><br />70. This reader says: I recently had a large pile of brush that I needed to bundle up for garbage day. I couldn't find any string to tie it up and started to look around for something. I eventually ran across our pile of plastic grocery bags and thought of a roll of plastic I had recently seen at the hardware store that could be used as twine. I took the bags and cut/ripped them in half as if I'd taken each handle and pulled the bag apart. I now had two pieces, each with a handle on one end. I then poked a hole at the other end where the 'v' usually is on the bottom of the bag. You now have a piece with a hole either end. The pieces can then be pulled through a loop of one of the other pieces and looped back though itself. By combining several pieces I had a surprisingly long, strong, and cheap rope which I used to tie up my brush pile for the garbage man. <br /><br />71. When you are using a special hair treatment that needs leaving in for longer than five minutes, tie a plastic bag around your wet hair and fasten the excess above your forehead with a twist tie or rubber band. <br /><br />72. Cut the bags down the side seams so they lie flat, and use several prepared in this manner as a drip sheet when painting models, fingernails, or doing other messy things. <br /><br />73. Use these flat bags taped to your bench as a wonderful non-stick and disposable surface on which to roll pastry (you may need to still use a little flour). You can also cover your rolling pin tightly in it. The pastry just peels off like the backing on prebought pastry sheets. <br /><br />74. Inevitably when children go on camps, water activites are part of the fun. Here is an old hiker's secret. Prevent saturated backpack contents by placing everything inside a garbage-size bag, tying with a twist-tie and THEN placing it inside the pack. Even if the pack falls in a lake, your clothes should stay reasonably dry!<br />&nbsp;<br />75. Thicker, vinyl-ish plastic bags make great packs for long-time storage of old notebooks, magazines, artwork, deeds etc. They are &quot;acid free&quot; and keep out paper-eating insects such as silverfish. Colorcode them and/or label them with an oil-based marker, then stick in the desired stack of paper, fold the top over twice, and seal right across with heavy stickytape. <br /><br />74. Big black garbage bags make excellent disposable raincoats for camping when you sut arm holes and a head hole in the sides and bottom. Compact, light to carry in your pack and useful! <br /><br />75. You can also cut thicker bags to be flat, and use them to cover books or recipe cards so that they are wipe-down when you are cooking(use a clear bag for a recipe card). <br /><br />76. Plastic bags are useful for crushing biscuits to make crumbs, eg for cheesecake, or for beating meat to tenderise it. Place in a bag, tie or hold the open end, and bash away! No mess, no fuss! Or, if you have a dough such as playdough that you are working food colouring though, food colour stains laminated or plastic benchtops so put the dough inside the bag, add a few drops of colour, tie the bag and knead away. Throw away the bag when finished, or use it to store playdough and keep it moist. Easy! <br /><br />77. I save my plastic bags and scoop the used cat litter and deposits in litter into a bag every day. This way I can use the litter longer and get the mess out of the house. I keep an old plastic litter pail to put filled plastic bags into, then throw them out on garbage day. No smell, no mess. <br /><br />78. Cut a bottom corner off heavier plastic bags and use to squeeze icing, cookie dough, etc through. <br />Use recycled bags to take your pop cans and bottles to the recycling depot. <br /><br />79. Tuck a plastic bag under your bike seat, then if it gets wet in the rain while you're shopping or whatever, you can pull the bag out, slip it over the wet seat, and ride off in comfort! <br /><br />80. Line your backpack inside with a plastic bag on wet days. <br /><br />81. Food pantries need bags, both plastic and paper to pack the food that they give away free. Donate your spare bags and get to know your local food pantry. <br /><br />82. This reader says: I've collected orange plastic bags our news papers are delivered in. Cut them into loops. Looped them together, and started to crochet pumpkins. They turned out to be large pumpkins that you can set out side, and display for the fall... No rotting pumpkins... They are stuffed with other plastic bags, so they can be washed down, dried and stored away for next year. My sister gave me the idea, when she crocheted large tote bags, and large brimmed lacey hats for a door decoration, all out of the different colored plastic bags... She added flowers, ribbon, and greenery, and they look great! <br /><br />83. From another reader: I use grocery store plastic bags as rain bonnets. <br /><br />84. The worst to happen is you're dressed-up in your Sunday best, and the car needs gas. I keep a few (plastic bags) around to use as a disposable glove, then toss it.Now I don't go to church smelling like a gas pump. <br /><br />85. I carry several plastic grocery bags in my vehicles to use during expected snow/sleet weather, to place around my windshield wiper blades and exterior rearview mirrors on my van/pickup. Also works on most passenger cars. Wrap plastic bag around the blade part snugly (not the arm) to prevent ice/snow from accumulating on the blade itself, then BEFORE DRIVING while vehicle is warming up, remove bags. Wiper blade will not be ridged from ice/snow and will be clear and smooth to wipe windshield. On exterior side mirrors slip plastic bag over mirror and tie handles. Where mirror is more areo-dynamic slip over mirror and slip excess into edge of door. You will not have to scrape or chip away built-up snow/ice. <br /><br />86. To make sewing patterns last longer, I take my tissue pattern pieces, use spray on glue, and then lay them out onto plastic shopping bags. You can color code the patterns by using different color bags for each pattern. They will last forever. <br /><br />87. I save the narrow plastic bags that newspapers are delivered in, and stick them in my purse. Then on a rainy day when I have shopping to do, I slip the wet umbrella into the bag, and can actually carry it around under my arm, or even slip it into my purse while shopping. It keeps me dry, and the merchandise dry, so that others can buy good quality products, rather than wet and damaged ones. <br /><br />88. One suggestion that I do have for re-cycling plastic bags is to also donate them to your local hospital and clinics. One thing they do is send you home with containers for different tests, and it is far less embarassing to carry them home in a bag. Just drop them off at the information desk at a hospital or at the front desk of a clinic. They will get someone to take them to the proper areas for you.<br />&nbsp;<br />89. I save the plastic bags from newspapers for many uses. One of my favorites is to save my containers from Pringles Potato Chips. I wash and dry them, then line them with a newspaper's plastic bag. (They can also be spray painted or covered with fabric and decorated to cover the ad if you like.) <br /><br />90. Quick clothespin bag: Bend the side ends of a wire hangar upwards, then hang a plastic grocery sack on it. Continue to bend the ends up and over the plastic bag handles to hold it in place. Frugal advice: Use two plastic bags, one inside the other to keep them from tearing. <br /><br />91. I keep a plastic bag hanging on the door handle of my laundry room. After rinsing, I toss my recyclable glass and plastic into the bag. When it gets full I grab it and take to the collection bin outside. No dirty collection bin in the house and no fumbling to carry a lot of loose items out to the bin. <br /><br />92. I always put shoes into a plastic bag before packing them in a suitcase. Not only to keep the clothes clean but for any possible odor problem. <br /><br />93. I often keep fabric I've purchased in plastic bags with the pattern, thread, buttons, or any notions I plan to use. <br /><br />96. I keep a couple of small opaque plastic bags in my purse - all rolled up. When I need a doggy bag and the restaurant doesn't have one, I just use one of these little bags and put a new one in my purse afterward. <br /><br />97. I am currently using the 100's I have saved for packing fragile items for moving. They work as good as any other plastic packing material. I wrap each fragile item in several bags and then stuff bags all around items in a box. I have shipped things cross country using bags for packing with no problem. Another reader adds: When we moved, we did our own packing. We wrapped all our dishes, knick nacks and breakable things in plastic bags. Nothing broke and we didn't have to wash off the newsprint from newspapers. <br /><br />98. When traveling, I always tuck a couple of plastic grocery bags in our suitcases to put our dirty clothes in, at the end of a day. Keeps your clean clothes smelling a lot fresher!<br />&nbsp;<br />99. When traveling, I wrap an extra pair of shoes for each person in my family in a plastic grocery store bag. These can be tucked into travel bags and the clothes stay clean. Another reader writes: I also use plastic grocery bags when traveling. Not only for shoes, but for shampoo, lotion. liquid shower gel, etc. If any of the bottles/tubes leak, you just throw the bag away and your clothes and luggage are not damaged. <br /><br />100. When trying on high-heeled shoes or boots and you're barefoot, put your foot inside a plastic bag and then into the footwear. Slides right in! This is handy when you're at a resale shop or garage sale, where they might not have little stocking-ettes available. <br /><br />101. I used long bread bags to cover my daughters wrist cast and tied it with elastic strip so that she could take a shower without getting it wet. It worked great. I suppose it could be used for a foot cast too. Hope it helps someone in the same dilemma. <br /><br />102. I use plastic bags to store not only meat remains in the freezer before I put them up for garbage pickup the next day, but to store veggie and fruit leftovers, peels, etc. for composting in my garden. <br /><br />103. I am a Primary teacher. I save all the bags my newspapers are delivered in. When I have a notice to send home, I insert it in a bag and tie the end around the students' backpack handles rather than putting it inside the backpack where it often gets lost. Often I will have responses from the parents in the same bag!<br />&nbsp;<br />104. I also use them to line plastic margarine containers for mixing powdered paint. When the painting time is over, I simply put a twist tie on the top of the bag, snap on the lid and the paint stays good for our next art lesson. <br /><br />105. I use large dark plastic bags to cover off season clothes hanging in the closet. Put a hole in the bottom for a coat hangar to go through. Also great to use if you don't own a travel bag to carry clothes in. <br /><br />106. I hang Christmas decorations - wreaths and long bows on a hangar and put a plastic bag over it in the closet. <br /><br />107. My husband works in an environment that has a lot of graphite. He puts his lunch for the day in a bag from the grocery store. It comes home with his reusable containers and is disposed of. No lunch boxes or bags to clean from that difficult to clean graphite. <br /><br />108. Use a large plastic bag to fit over ceiling fan blades for cleaning. Simply dust the blades and let the mess fall into the bag. <br /><br />109. Cut brightly colored bags into strips and tie to the electric fence at space intervals. The horses, cattle and even deer can see the plastic fluttering in the breeze and are not so apt to run into the fence and tear it down.<br />&nbsp;<br />110. Keep one in the car at all times, especially when you have kids in with you. They make handy travel - sick bags! <br /><br />111. I buy hamburger in bulk and then package and freeze it in 1/2 lb. portions for DH and me. I take a 1/2 lb. and place it in a bread sack, squeeze out the air, and close with a twist tie. Then the next 1/2 lb. goes in on top of that; close with another twist tie, and so on until I've filled the length of the bag. When I want to take out a portion, I just cut one off. <br /><br />112. My hubby has for years been packing his lunch into a bread bag. He takes his lunch in an igloo cooler and also carries a bottle of water which is half frozen the night before. No matter what the temp - 20 or 98 there is always some sweat from his water. Thus he has been using the bread bag to keep the rest of his lunch (goodies) fresh and dry. <br /><br />113. This readers says: I use grocery bags to place items going to one place, thrift shop, friend's house, etc. I hang the bag on the door handle and they are ready to go the next day. This helps me not to forget these items. <br /><br />114. I have 2 main recipe books, one for main dishes, salads etc. and the other for desserts and candy, in those stand-up books. I use two flat plastic bags just slightly larger than the pages, one on the front and one on the back which I slip on after I've found the recipe I want. No more food stains all over my cookbooks.<br />&nbsp;<br />115. I make potpourri and keep it stored in plastic bags to retain the scent until I'm ready to use it. I store used scented wax and new scented candles in plastic for the same reason. <br />&nbsp;<br />116. We don't usually have newspapers delivered in plastic bags here, but when we do, I use the bags to store extra rolls of wallpaper (for crafts or whatever). I also use them to package long items whenever we have a garage sale. I store my skeins of embroidery and crewel wool in them as they're exactly the right width. You can get a lot of skeins in one of those bags and you can see immediately what colours you've got. <br /><br />117. Stuff an old sock with 2 or 3 grocery bags. Tie shut with a piece of yarn. The cats love it. If I have any catnip I throw a pinch of that in the toe. <br /><br />118. Stuff cushions for outdoor use (furniture, etcetera) with plastic bags. Works especially well if the fabric for the cushions is waterproof as well. <br /><br />119. Have you ever struggled to stuff a large pillow (such as a couch cushion) into a very tight fitting cover? Remember how hard it was to stuff it in and then it was almost impossible to zip up the cover because you didn't have the pillow all the way to the back? A large plastic bag to the rescue! I put the pillow into a large garbage bag and gathered the opening around a vacuum cleaner hose. As the air is sucked out, a pillow the size of a library will shrink to the size of a single book! Place the shriveled pillow inside the cover and allow the air back in. The pillow will regain its original size and shape and be inside the cover. The plastic bag can be removed by reaching inside and pulling it out, in bits and pieces if necessary.(I once volunteered to fill a small bag with holiday goodies to be given as a gift for a child. All of the bags to be filled were the same size. I wanted to put a large teddy bear into the small bag. I used this procedure to put the teddy bear into the bag. Imagine the surprise on a child's face to open a small bag and watch it expand into a large teddy bear!)<br />&nbsp;<br />120. I use the small plastic bags on rainy days to put my outgoing mail in. I hang it from the red flag on the mail box. <br />&nbsp;<br />121. Cut a plastic bag down both sides and use it to line your metal paint tray (secure with tape) when doing any house painting. This will save time during clean up as well as money and plastic since you won't need to buy the premade liners. <br /><br />122. For businesses that use magnetic strip time cards for employees, or when your credit card won't work at the check-out counter and there is no time to use electronic card cleaner in the swipe channel, put the card inside a plastic bag, and swipe the card within the bag. It will get the machine to read the magnetic strip when all else fails. (This does work, Nick and I have tried it)<br /><br />123. Plastic bags are great for those painters who run out of paint pallets. Stretch out the bag to creat an even covering and lay out paints on it. The bags will work great with acrylics, watercolor, guache, tempra and all paints that are alike. <br /><br />124. When we used to go tent camping with our three (now grown) children, we had a 12'x12' umbrella tent and same size tarp for our kitchen and dining area with ropes and stakes extending out for stability, but at night especially, we kept tripping over the almost invisible structures. So, white plastic bags saved the day/night! We cut them in strips and tied the strips onto the ropes and stakes and with the slightest breeze, they would flip around and be very noticible and remind us to go around or step over the ropes and stakes. I wonder how many accidents we prevented by doing this? You are welcome to adapt this to whatever uses you find.<br />&nbsp;<br />125. A white bag tied to the antenna of your vehicle would alert the police or someone that you have an emergency. <br /><br />126. When traveling by plane I always put my stuff in plastic bags. When they &quot;tag&quot; you for luggage inspection, they just take out the plastic bags. They will hold them up,look at them and put them back. Inspectors has never opened a bag yet. It does not mess up your well packed luggage.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_721">Well, one thing I can think of with the wine bottles, besides tapar candle holders, is to get the bottle and take off the label and then you can etch the glass. Once you are done doing that you can put bath salts or something and give them away as gifts. If you dont want to etch the glass you could also take off the label and put on a new label custom made for the person you are giving too. Maybe even have a poem on the label or short story about the bottle or the person or something.<br /><br />If you had wire cutters and beads you could even use the hangers to put a decorative touch aroung the bottle by cutting the wire and beading it. For the hangers...<br /><br />1.Christmas decorations by cutting the wire into spirals and shapes and decorating with beads<br /><br />2. Make fairy wings<br /><br />3. Get alligator clips, or some other kind of clip. &nbsp;Find a picture you like. &nbsp;From a calander, or printed off the web, or your own 8X10, whatever. &nbsp;Clip the pictures to the bottom wire of the hanger. &nbsp;Hang the hanger on a nail in the wall. <br /><br />4.Make a wreath using strips cut out of plastic bags, just shape the hanger into a circle and tie on tons of plastric strips until its fluffy and full. Add a bow to make it pretty.<br /><br />MY FAVORITE<br />5. &nbsp;Another wreath with a twist like the one before but made out of candy.<br /><br />&nbsp;It is 100% fine to eat! I will try to post instructions with pictures. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You can either buy a wire wreath shape, (I just make them out of coat hangers which I bend then use a strong tape, and tape the overlapping wire together). &nbsp; <br /><br /><br />&nbsp; Then you take a very very long string (I use a &quot;small&quot; cotton string, more hardware then crafts, (I found string got too tangled up)<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Fold your string in two and tie it to the top of your wreath with the knot going &quot;around&quot; the wire. &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Then you start to make another knot, but before you tie it too tightly you slip the end of three wrapped candies in it, then finish your knot.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You just keep repeating this process, every once in awhile pushing the candies up to keep the wreath looking full.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;At the end tie a bow if you wish. &nbsp;Before I put the candies into the knots, I like to make sure that both ends of the candy wrapper is twisted tightly. &nbsp;If your knots aren't tight enough, the Candy may fall off the finished product.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; When eating the candy, you simply unwrap a candy and slide it out, leaving the wrapper on the wreath!<br /><br /><img src="http://www.mariesenchantedgarden.com/mbpics/candywreath1.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><img src="http://www.mariesenchantedgarden.com/mbpics/candywreath2.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></div>
