				Wow, the January lunch and dinner sounds good. Think I&#39;ll try and make those events.<br /><br />I did go to Bungalo on Wed night and had some fun. It was a cold quiet night though. Rob did spin some great tunes, and no, the music was at a level whereby one could converse, dine, or drink, and enjoy.<br />I had a nice quiet relaxing evening, having some snack, Vodka Cranberries, and watching the few local cuties that were out ansd aboutfor a bit. Maybe next wed will be better...<br />I love the space and environment though, Bungalo is nice.
