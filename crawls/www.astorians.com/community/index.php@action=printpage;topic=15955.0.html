				Am thinking of taking a beginning drawing class, and am wondering if anyone has any recommendations? I&#039;ve taken an art class at the Educational Alliance in downtown Manhattan, but don&#039;t have experience with any other art schools. Am looking for something that I can ideally attend on the weekends.

				A few years ago I got back into art after a long hiatus. Here are a few things I&#039;ve tried:<br /><br />The Art Student League has inexpensive classes and you will almost certainly be able to find a weekend class. The league is very teacher-oriented- however they want to teach, they get to teach. I&#039;ve been in classes where the instructor never spoke to us unless we specifically asked for feedback, and in others where feedback was very structured. A lot of students there seem to find instructors they really mesh with and keep working with them for years. But if you don&#039;t like the instructor or don&#039;t speak the same language you may be in for a very frustrating time (however if that&#039;s the case you can likely switch classes). <br /><br />Hunter College has beginning drawing classes (look at their continuing ed catalog), generally on weeknights. Those classes are a bit more expensive, about $250 for 6 weeks, but I had a better experience there than at the ASL. <br /><br />Additionally, wetcanvas.com/forums has a lot of tutorials for various mediums and forums for discussion. You can post your work there for the other members to critique and generally they&#039;ll be very helpful. Even reading critiques of other people&#039;s work can be interesting.<br /><br />A couple of books I&#039;ve found to be helpful are &quot;The Creative License&quot; and &quot;Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain&quot;. <br /><br />Good luck!
