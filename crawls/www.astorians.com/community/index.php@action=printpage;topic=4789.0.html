				Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s been posted before, and I have no time to look, but I got invited last minute to a apt warming and I wanted to bring something.&nbsp; I was thinking of making some wings (cause I have a bunch frozen in my fridge) and don&#39;t have a reliable recipe to use.&nbsp; &nbsp; When I had my smoker, I had a great recipe that involved beer and peanut butter, but that&#39;s not an option.<br /><br />I don&#39;t mean to be picky, but I don&#39;t want something off the back of a frank&#39;s hot sauce bottle.&nbsp; &nbsp;I want to put a little effort into it and not bring the same old wings.&nbsp; (and while she may not be single, she may have single friends there and I wouldn&#39;t mind making an impression)<br /><br />Thanks in advance!!<br /><br />

				I&#39;m not sure how many people on here experiment with wings, unfortunately.&nbsp; Check out the various cooking websites, perhaps.&nbsp; I was just going to suggest Buffalo Wings, but you said no to that.&nbsp; But I say, why mess with perfection?&nbsp; :wink:

				I&#39;ve got a few of recipes that are always hits.<br /><br /><strong>HONEY GARLIC CHICKEN WINGS</strong> <br />3 lbs chicken wings<br />1/2 cup honey<br />1/4 cup lemon juice<br />1/4 cup water<br />3 tbsp ketchup<br />1 1/2 tsp garlic powder<br />1/2 tsp garlic salt<br />1 tsp ground ginger<br /><br />Combine all ingredients, except chicken wings, in sauce pan. <br />Heat to boiling and simmer for 5 minutes.<br />Place chicken wings into a 9&quot; X 13&quot; baking dish. <br />Pour sauce over wings. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hrs.<br /><br />Bake at 400 F for 1 hour, turning once.<br /><br /><hr /><br /><strong>ORANGE GLAZED CHICKEN WINGS</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />3 lbs chicken wings<br />2/3 cup soy sauce<br />1/2 cup honey<br />2 tbsp. vegetable oil<br />1/2 tsp. five spice powder<br />1 tsp. grated orange rind<br />2 gloves garlic, crushed<br /><br />Place chicken wings in shallow glass or plastic dish. Mix remaining ingredients, pour over chicken. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, turning occasionally.<br /><br />Arrange chicken on rack in foil-lined broiler pan, reserve marinade. Brush chicken with reserved marinade and bake in 375 degree oven for 30 minutes. Turn chicken and continue baking, brushing occasionally with marinade, for 30 minutes.<br /><br /><hr /><br /><strong>BOURBON CHICKEN WINGS</strong><br />24 chicken wings<br />3 tbsp. bourbon<br />3 tbsp. olive oil<br />1 tbsp. finely grated lemon peel<br />Juice of 1 lemon (about 2 to 3 tablespoons)<br />1 cup fine, dry, unseasoned Panko crumbs<br />1 tablespoon sweet Hungarian paprika<br />salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste<br /><br />Combine the wings, bourbon, olive oil, lemon rind, and lemon juice in a bowl. <br />Toss to coat the wings and marinate refrigerated for 4 hours.<br /><br />Mix the bread crumbs, paprika, salt, and pepper in a plastic bag. Drain the wings, pat dry and toss with the bread crumb mixture. Put the wings on a baking sheet and place about 4 to 5 inches from heat source under preheated broiler. Broil until crisp and golden, about 5–7 minutes on each side.<br /><br /><hr /><br /><strong>CLASSIC SOUTHERN FRIED CHICKEN WINGS</strong><br />Salt and pepper, for seasoning chicken <br />Crisco shortening, for frying <br />3 eggs <br />1/3 cup water <br />2 cups self-rising flour <br />1 tsp black pepper <br />2 1/2–3 1/2 lbs. chicken wings<br /><br />Heat shortening in a cast iron skillet to 350 degrees F.<br /><br />Beat eggs with water in a small bowl. In a shallow bowl, season flour with pepper. Dip chicken pieces in egg mixture and then coat well in flour mixture. Carefully add to hot shortening, in batches if necessary, place lid on top of skillet, and fry until brown and crisp.

				I make very simple baked wings:<br /><br />Preheat oven to 400.&nbsp; Melt butter on the stove, add double the amount of Frank&#39;s Red Hot.&nbsp; Add hot sauce (Tabasco, Dave&#39;s Insanity, Habanero, whatever) of your choice to bring it to the spice level you want.&nbsp; Toss the raw wings in the sauce, spread on a baking sheet and bake until done (30ish minutes).&nbsp; Re-heat the sauce (because you&#39;ve put raw chicken in it).&nbsp; Toss baked wings in sauce again.&nbsp; Serve with Marie&#39;s blue cheese dressing and celery sticks, with extra sauce in bowl for dipping.<br /><br />But they are, if not genuine Buffalo wings, then Buffalo-inspired.&nbsp; So that&#39;s probably not what you want, either.<br /><br />Only other thing to do with wings is a recipe called heroin wings:<br /><br />Preheat oven to 350 and line a baking sheet with foil.&nbsp; For 4 pounds wings, mix 1 cup grated Parmesan with 1 tablespoon dried oregano, 2 tsp paprika, 1tsp. salt, pepper to taste and some parsley if you like it.&nbsp; Melt 1/2 cup butter and put it in a shallow bowl.&nbsp; Dip each wing into butter, roll in the seasoned cheese, and place on the baking sheet in a single layer.&nbsp; Bake for 45 minutes or so or until done.<br /><br />The times in both recipes are approximate because I haven&#39;t made wings in awhile.<br /><br />That&#39;s all, folks.&nbsp; I have no idea what else to do with wings.
