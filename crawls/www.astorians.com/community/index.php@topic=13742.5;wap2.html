			I remember all of them.When I was a kid we called Valco&#039;s &quot;Cheap Charlie&#039;s&quot;.I don&#039;t know why,maybe there was a store there with that name previously and our parents just kept calling it that.

			&nbsp; ABB, I too, remember my parents, Aunts, Uncles and cousins all referring to Valco&#039;s as &quot;Cheap Charlie&#039;s in the 70&#039;s.&nbsp; I remember walking up Steinway Street when I was a kid, and getting very excited when we passed by, although we were usually on the other side of the street.&nbsp; I also remember looking all around for any indication that it had &quot;Cheap Charlie&#039;s&quot; anywhere in its name.&nbsp; Being brought in by my parents or my Uncle and Aunt was always like winning the lottery for me!&nbsp; This pleasant memory just reminded me to ask them why they called it Cheap Charlie&#039;s.

			<br />--- Quote from: ddanny999 on January 21, 2009, 07:37:16 AM ---In the 70&#039;s, I remember a hobby store on 37th or 38th Street (I think) that had model kits and rocket kits; but I am not referring to the hobby shop on 36th street still in operation (they put old books on the front of the store) and from the inside looks like it was once an old soda shop (complete with a bar).<br /><br />--- End quote ---<br /><br />I remember the hobby shop from the late 1970s which was on 30th Avenue just off 37th Street, next door to where there is currently a grocery/convenience store. I think it was open for about 2 years (1979-1980?) I bought a few models kits there myself. The other hobby shop which is still going strong today is Rudy&#039;s at 35-16 30th Avenue just off 36th Street, a nice store for most any hobby need, and yes, it used to be a soda shop from the 1950s-early 1980s. They used to also have a sweets section near the front where you can buy various penny candies, gum balls, and even rock candy. The owner Rudy is the same owner who transformed it into a hobby shop, he is very helpful and knowledgeable about most all hobby topics.
