				Title: <strong>On this Monday</strong><br />

				I chose this episode of Binrev because it is a logical follow-up of the last episode. I have more personal reasons as well, having to do with the contsitutional right to privacy: see the P.A.T.R.I.O.T. Act (http://astorians.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=623) thread (hopefully I have matured a little since beginning that thread). <br /><br />I still only use rudimentary encryption algorithms for my communications (if at all) and the reasons for this, although there are a plethora of open-sourced tools available to me only a small download away are simply ignorance and laziness. Many people avoid using passwords because remembering them is a tiresome task, or typing it in simply takes too long. Now, through the modern miracle of mnemonics I can remember a password 40+ characters long! And so can you! Take this example:<br /><br />&nbsp;&quot;Sometimes I Go To The Refrigerator Very Late At Night To Get A Late Night Snack. Whether I Eat Cheese Or Cereal It Really Makes No Difference Just As Long As I Remember To Brush My Teeth Afterwards Because Tooth-Decay Is An Unpleasant Thing, Just Like Bad Breath.(my phone # with the last two digits changed (and a different area code)&quot;...<br /><br />Renders this relatively secure password: [&quot;SIGTTRVLANTGALNS.WIECOCIRMNDJALAIRTBMTABT-DIAUT,JLBB.(my phone # with the last two digits changed (and a different area code)&quot;] = <br />Sixty-five (65) characters<br /><br />By using numbers and punctuation marks in addition to alphabetic characters you increase the sophistication of the password. Add to this <em>case sensitivity </em>then you may have something very daunting indeed. Of course, the above example may be a little extreme so you'll have to adjust the strength of your passwords for your own needs. You could measure the time taking to type the password in against how much the information you are attempting to protect is worth. But to not use them at all or a password that is easily cracked or guessed (like a pet's name or your favorite food) may not be advisable. I guess, what I'm trying to say is that with a little information, solutions are only a small act of volition away.<br /><br />I hope you will join us this week as we learn how to protect our privacy together and am sure you will see me taking notes.<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Note: I am open to suggestions regarding the nature of the hero or the brunch... it doesn't even have to be a hero. I'm trying to keep it vegetarian however, as I want to try something different and vegetables are for the most part cost effective. Today's hero will be the same as last week, and No, I didn't use the leftovers from last week lol. I will buy the vegetable materials the same day or the night before. The reason that it is the same as last week is due to a lack of imagination and also, I really want to get a handle on the <em>exact</em> amount of goods needed to make this particular hero in order to further my knowledge of this special branch of sandwich technology.<br /><br />As for the programming, I am always looking for new shows to listen to and Tech-Brunch won't be sticking exclusively to Binary Revolution Radio. I am planning a Monday in the future that will have 4 or 5 (10-15) minute shows.<br /><br />Also: If anyone would like to give a talk or a presentation having to do with tech in lieu of the Internet Broadcast please get in touch with me... however, keep in mind that 12pm Monday may not be the most lucrative time. You will have at least <em>two</em> listeners!<br /><br />There is alot of free information out there and I advise everyone to explore on their own so that we may pool together the fruits of our exploration and so be in a position to build a better tommorrow based on information and humanity.<br /><br />-Zeno.
