				It&#039;s also perfectly legal to fart, but there are certain things someone should just wait until the appropriate time to do, as a courtesy to other people. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think the mother should be scolded or ticketed or anything- I just think it seems a bit discourteous in my opinion.

				It sounds like the part that was a faux pas was the fact that she did not attempt to cover herself in any way (if I understood the original poster correctly). I can understand that some people would feel it was inappropriate not to drape a blanket or coat over her shoulder to protect her privacy. People have the right to feel uncomfortable with exposure in public, kathyjean. If she had not been breastfeeding but was simply topless, it would not be tolerated and would probably make some people rather uncomfortable. A woman does and should have the right to breastfeed her child when it is needed regardless of location, but using a blanket as a cover would be an easy solution to offending as few people as possible. The argument was never that she should not be allowed to breastfeed - just that she does it in a way that is more mindful of others.

				Guy adjusting=mother breastfeeding ?<br />Some magazines ,advertising,TV, show more of a woman&#039;s breast trying to sell products. Yet we don&#039;t look away from these. Women who breastfeed deserve respect. <br />There is a great deal of sexualization involved in breastfeeding. There are some who believe that a woman&#039;s breasts are only for sexual use. They are primarily to feed her infant.<br />

				The truth is that once you have a child your perspective changes and things simplify down to practical matters.&nbsp; Modesty is trumped by the need to feed a baby on demand, for example.&nbsp; It&#039;s just the way it is.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am sure many many women who might have been very modest in the past just become more aware of necessity over modesty.&nbsp; SO yes it might be uncomfortable for those around but honestly what&#039;s more important?&nbsp; A baby being fed and made happy or some peoples discomfort.&nbsp; And yes she probably could have covered up a bit but I&#039;ll give it a pass.&nbsp; Maybe consider how uncomfortable she might feel but has to learn to deal with the setting.&nbsp; Can you imagine the first time she realizes it&#039;s a matter of letting a baby scream on a packed angry subway or whipping out a boob in public to feed the baby?<br /><br />Before becoming a dad I might have felt the same but now I just assume or hope people will understand and bear with any reasonable uncomfortableness for the sake of the baby.

Babies/children who are breastfeeding , do so &quot;on demand&quot; , that is, they eat when they want and the mother , or anyone for that matter, cannot control the timing of that demand. <br />You probably would not have had a problem with a parent bottle-feeding a child, so again, it comes down to those darn breasts !<br />Get a clue, look if you want, look away if it bothers your sensibilities, rules, manners or etiquette.

Babies/children who are breastfeeding , do so &quot;on demand&quot; , that is, they eat when they want and the mother , or anyone for that matter, cannot control the timing of that demand. <br />You probably would not have had a problem with a parent bottle-feeding a child, so again, it comes down to those darn breasts !<br />Get a clue, look if you want, look away if it bothers your sensibilities, rules, manners or etiquette.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You sure do like motherhood.&nbsp; And babies.

				when an infant is introduced to a bottle it &quot;can&quot; have a negative impact on breast feeding.<br />to a breast feeding child a bottle is a totally different thing than breast feeding.<br />to a naturally on demand breast fed child, sometimes breastfeeding is for passifying not just feeding. &nbsp;do your own research this is healthy and natural. oh - and you can&#039;t just shove a passifier in all babies mouths.. some just know the real thing is the best thing.<br /><br />the society that I am a part of is comfortable with breastfeeding mamas in public, just as they are comfortable with the half naked women on magazine covers outside of bodegas.<br />the people in this society that think I should buy a bottle because they can&#039;t handle the sight of a nursing child are the ones that need to re-evaluate.

Unfortunately, IMO, a law had to be written, to allow a mother to nurse her infant.<br />Nursing moms are not being &quot;arrogant&quot;. They are not &quot;disregarding&quot; others around them. The breastfeeding mother is feeding her child.<br />Most moms who breastfeed, get their child to the breast before he starts to cry. Many people on the train, bus, park bench, mall, do not even realize that the woman seated next to them is breastfeeding.<br />&nbsp;I will venture a guess that the woman in the OP was not intent on exposing her breast, she probably wanted to get that baby on and calmed down.<br />Once again, those sexy breasts are meant for feeding a child !<br />Get over it.<br /><br />&nbsp;

It seems that the general consensus (If I am reading nods correctly here) is that people are fine with a mother&#039;s need to feed their child. The issue is doing it while having consideration for the surrounding public.

I understand that some moms don&#039;t want to use formula, but wouldn&#039;t pumping let you have a bank of food for the kid for those times when you&#039;re not available to nurse? Or (and obviously I don&#039;t know you and your home situation, but I&#039;ll throw it out there anyway), but are you always the one getting up in the middle of the night to feed? I know a lot of my friends who have small babies usually take turns with their SO.<br /><br />For whatever it&#039;s worth, I in the &quot;if mom needs to breastfeed on the subway, no biggie. But be discreet because even though it&#039;s legal, not everyone feels like watching&quot; camp. From the original post, it just seems like the parents were inconsiderate overall - letting their kids run around the car, not folding the stroller in the middle of a crowded car, etc. I know folding might not always be an option, but if there are two adults, I&#039;m betting there were opportunities for them be a little more respectful of the people around them.

				And Kathyjean, it doesn&#039;t have to do with breasts being sexy for everyone. I&#039;m a woman and realize that breasts are for the purpose of feeding our offspring but honestly... breast feeding skeeves me to watch. Sorry! Just my opinion. I really don&#039;t want to watch it. I know it&#039;s natural and better for the baby, but I don&#039;t want to see it though. So it doesn&#039;t always have to do with those &quot;sexy boobs&quot; you keep harping on. To me, it&#039;s a bodily function. It&#039;s your body producing a substance that is being excreted from the body. I don&#039;t want to see anyone excreting any bodily substances on my train ride. Again, this is just my opinion and I&#039;m trying to tell you that not everyone is sexualizing breast feeding. The very idea of sex and breast feeding together is totally gross to me.

				I&#039;m surprised that no one asked whether anyone on the subway offered the breastfeeding woman a seat, before she sat down in her stroller in the middle of everyone.<br /><br />I&#039;m guessing the situation would have attracted much less attention if the woman had been sitting in an actual seat (and it doesn&#039;t help that the family had made such a disruptive entrance to the train, causing all eyes to be on them when the feeding began).

				&nbsp;I agree that the woman in the OP (subway etiquette, if I remember correctly)could have been more discreet. Most moms carry a shawl or receiving blanket to cover up.<br />&nbsp;The reaction&nbsp; to a woman breastfeeding has been quite strong. <br />&nbsp;I don&#039;t believe breastfeeding has to be an &quot;in your face&quot;(no pun really intended!) activity. But , we always have the option of looking away. <br />&nbsp;Perhaps the original poster could elaborate.<br />&nbsp;I understand the activity of the family coming onto a crowded train. What was the dad&#039;s reaction to the woman nursing? Was he trying to corral the running children ? Just curious.<br />&nbsp; Sometimes a family member who is with the nursing mom will try to shield her.&nbsp; I am also curious about whether anyone offered this mom a seat, so that she didn&#039;t have to sit in the stroller.<br />&nbsp;To casicua, breastfeeding moms breastfeed around the clock. As babies grow they get better at breastfeeding and often &quot;space&quot; their feedings so that there is sometimes a longer period between breastfeedings. Moms breastfeed in bed , usually without waking their partner. It&#039;s a great system for everyone involved. Pumping and storing breastmilk is great for moms who must be away from their child,but if mom and baby are together pumping is usually not necessary.

				&nbsp;:-)<br />I am feeling more relaxed today about this discussion, so I will share (after I said yesterday that I won&#039;t cover up) that I actually am discreet.&nbsp; Daughter is usually in her carrier with hood on when nursing.&nbsp; If not I wear two shirts, one to cover my tummy, and one to lift up to cover the top of breast.&nbsp; <br />However&nbsp; :-) ...

There are a lot of &quot;right things to be doing&quot; that people do, and&nbsp; they get done without disturbing other people, and I feel like for the most part that should be the general rule. <br /><br />For example: I own a dog- and she has to go out and use the bathroom. The right thing to do is take her out and let her poop. Out of consideration to other people, I make sure that she is not pooping in front of a restaurant while people have to look at it while trying to eat. I walk her on side streets and pick up after her.<br /><br />I realize it is not the same thing as feeding your child- but my point is, yes, you have to feed your child, I have to walk my dog, other people have to do a lot of other things- but we should be doing them in a considerate fashion so as not to disturb those around us. <br /><br />Asking a mother to cover up when breastfeeding is not an unreasonable request. Each of have our respective responsibilities, and part of those responsibilities is being considerate of those around us.

				paratactical: a breastfeeding woman is not being &quot;rude and inconsiderate &quot;of those around her.

I hope not.<br />&nbsp;To those of you who are anti-breastfeeding in public, casicua,who feel that a breastfeeding mother is &quot;disturbing&quot; those around her, I think you need to take a good look at your attitude toward a normal, healthy act of providing nourishment for a child.<br />&nbsp;BTW, those of you who are so anti-breastfeeding, get ready.... August is World Breastfeeding Month !!!!<br />Lots of breastfeeding , lots of talk about breasts and babies, and , oh heaven forbid !!! women breastfeeding in public places.....around you, in your&quot;space&quot; , on your train/bus, in your restaurant, at the PTA meeting.......be prepared.<br />

				Oh, and right. Happy Mother&#039;s Day.<br /><br />But being a mother is the toughest job there is--not because of the night-waking--because of the judgment of others. Believe me when I tell you that almost everyone has advise and&nbsp; of those, few have actual experience (including pediatricians!). Believe me when I tell you too that you may feel one way about public breastfeeding, toddler nursing, whatever until it happens to you or the mother of your child.<br /><br />I urge tolerance and non-judgment as well as deep appreciation for the work our mothers have done to bring us here, the vast majority are doing the very best that they can. ...And breastfeeding is the very best for mother and baby. <br /><br />Hopefully when it becomes more of a common sight, as it was in the 1930&#039;s, there will be less shock and public acceptance. During visits to Mexico, I have been shocked to find that a woman was nursing while giving me change, nursing while walking down the street--so casually that I didn&#039;t even NOTICE it at first!

It does not arouse me, nor does it evoke any sort of sexual confusion. It has absolutely nothing to do with my general perception of gender roles. <br />Let&#039;s put it this way: would you be grossed out to see a stranger&#039;s penis out in the open- even if he isn&#039;t flaunting it or waving it around? It&#039;s the same reason for me I don&#039;t want to see a stranger&#039;s breasts. <br />Before people get on my case about a false analogy here, I can, with full conviction, say that this is a valid analogy. I am fully aware that a breast is not the same as a penis, but the fact is that the reasons for being uncomfortable with seeing a stranger&#039;s penis or breasts are generally the same across the board.<br /><br />Like I said, I am fine with public breastfeeding- a kid&#039;s gotta eat, if you get a little accidentally exposed fine, but at least make an effort. I just don&#039;t like this sense of entitlement that some mothers get where they think they are above the rest of society. I respect mothers and what they do, but it is not wanton license to disregard societal etiquette. If we all have to follow good manners, so should you. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=14879.msg173514#msg173514">Quote from: nycParkie on May 15, 2009, 03:01:26 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">has the horse been burried yet?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>We&#039;ll keep beating it til the end of the triple crown, how about that?&nbsp; :-D

				It is a smug sense of entitlement belongs to the powerful.<br /><br />Though breastfeeding was just made legal, I assure you that few women are breastfeeding with a sense of the above.

Men don&#039;t actually get in trouble for pissing in the street with great frequency and neither do women--not because one group does it more or less frequently but because police don&#039;t waste their time looking for alley pissers and people with low-hanging pants.<br /><br />Also, just because men and women are disgusting in different ways doesn&#039;t mean that they aren&#039;t equally disgusting. I don&#039;t see too many men with muffin tops or cutting their nails on the subway, but that doesn&#039;t mean that there aren&#039;t equally gross things that guys do.<br /><br />The whole thing, the whole point of this thread and this argument, is that breast feeding in public in and of itself is totally okay <strong>BUT</strong> being inconsiderate about the people around you is rude, whether your actions are legal or not.<br /><br />I would imagine that it&#039;s not illegal to cut your nails on the subway, but I would never do it because I think it&#039;s rude. Now, if I had a hangnail and it was really driving me crazy, I might pull out the file for just a quick swipe to tide me over until I got somewhere where I can take care of it. <br /><br />The same should go for breast feeding. I understand, your child is hungry and it is a good, natural beautiful thing for a mother and child to participate in. However, I am not the mother nor the child and I do not need nor want to be involved. So, if you have to take care of your child in public, at least make an attempt to cover up a bit, be discreet and polite.

If ownership of women&#039;s bodies isn&#039;t the crux of the matter, I don&#039;t know what is.<br /><br />Women are made to feel that the milk that comes out of their bodies can&#039;t possibly be as good as formula to feed their children by corporate marketing campaigns. Their empowerment at birth is stripped away by hospital procedures (again influenced by commercial interests) which deprive them of choices. They are made to feel guilty if they don&#039;t breastfeed, then subject to censure if they do so without showing anything.<br /><br />I am not making light of women&#039;s struggles--actually, I&#039;m the one that brought them up!<br /><br />Speaking of which, do you know that 3/4 of welfare recipients are single mothers with children? They get free samples from the hospital for formula, are not shown to breastfeed, but that&#039;s ok they can get more formula from WIC (the government is the biggest purchaser of formula) for the first year. Oh, goodie. Many low-income women have to work and don&#039;t have &quot;pumping rooms&quot; or time to pump to keep up her supply. The drugs she almost certainly got during birth from the epidural (if she was not one of the 33% that had an &quot;emergency cesarean&quot;) knocks the baby out for the first two weeks she needs to be nursing like mad to keep up a supply.<br /><br />All mothers are subject to criticism and censure from gentle suggestions to being accosted on the street by old ladies if her baby is missing a sock or hat--with no protection. Guys can be &quot;boys and be boys&quot; and babies are &quot;just a baby&quot; but moms are only given wide berth (no pun intended) by other moms, &quot;well, she&#039;s got small children.&quot;<br /><br />Dang it! If a woman has managed to breastfeed in this culture despite these obstacles a little offended eyeballs on the subway is nothing! I say, go girl! Whip it out!

				Casicua and Paratactical, you guys just don&#039;t understand.&nbsp; <br /><br />EVERYONE is against women breast feeding. In public. Not in public. Blatantly or not. Are you not signed up to the Conspiracy Theorist&#039;s Anonymous email list? CTA has super secret classified government documents showing that they&#039;ve been plotting all along to get women to use formula instead of breast feeding so as to warp their little baby brains into being less smart so they&#039;d be easier to control and also profit at the same time. Just look at me! I was bottle fed and I turned into an idiot!*<br /><br />And just like webmomma says, women are encouraged to use formula instead of breastfeeding even by their DOCTORS. Who are obviously in on the conspiracy. That&#039;s why they want to socialize the healthcare industry, so they have even MORE control over the DOCTORS.**<br /><br />If you want more information, go to any of the cultlike pro-women breastfeeding websites that tell all women who don&#039;t breastfeed that they&#039;re bad people and gives all women who do breastfeed an unfounded smug sense of superiority. Trust me, there&#039;s more than enough of them. Take your time and google it...<br /><br />...I know, right? Really creepy.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now you know what kind of person you&#039;re arguing against. <br /><br />Logic holds no sway on the internet. In the future, you should misconstrue and twist your opponents words into a strawman and then call them an idiot for using such a feeble argument. Or being sexist. Or racist. Or like Hitler. Yeah, that&#039;s right - Hitler would have used FORMULA and put women who breastfed into concentraiton camps. Are you like HITLER Casicua?!? Are you?!? Follow it up with a couple of completely untrue generalizations about culture xyz, twist in some logical fallacies and TADA! So much easier than using logic or coherent arguments. Sure, you might not win the war of public opinion (although this _completely_ depends on your audience...apparently it doesn&#039;t work so well on here *sigh*), but your opponent&#039;s brain will hurt SO bad from the wrongness, ignorance and one-sidedness of your post that...it...might...just...explode. And then you win the internet.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />* Ok, so I was breastfed in the beginning and not bottlefed until I was older. I&#039;m still an idiot!!!<br />** Almost all doctors recommend breastfeeding unless there is a medical or otherwise reason to do so. And there is a HUGE negative bias against mothers today who bottle feed (even occasionally or in tandem with breast feeding). I know one young woman who was yelled at in public by a complete stranger (middle aged crazy woman) for bottle feeding.

				As Lizluv demonstrates she doesn&#039;t read your posts either. <br /><br />Casicua: We understand that women need to breastfeed. We just ask that they are courteous and try to cover up.

And then in the next sentence agrees with Casicua that women can and should be discreet about it. <br /><br />I particularly liked:<br /><br />Is a mother suppose to lock herself indoors until the baby is switched from breast milk to regular milk?<br /><br />Noone suggested anything even remotely like this.

				You know, I am looking back through this thread, and I can&#039;t even find ONE post saying women shouldn&#039;t breastfeed. In fact, I think everyone on this thread(correct me if I&#039;m wrong) has supported a woman&#039;s right to breastfeed in public. <br /><br />The argument on this thread is and has always been whether it is the POLITE thing to do to try and cover up a bit. <br />Unfortunately, some people are either blind, or illiterate- and judging by their argumentative logic(or lack thereof), I&#039;m leaning towards the latter.

				Mer--<br /><br />My statements are based on seven years working as a mom helping other mothers breastfeed through WIC and other programs. Unfortunately, what I have said about formula companies (similar to pharmaceutical companies) is old news to doctors, hospitals, breastfeeding administrators and lactation consultants.<br /><br />I assure you that I am dead serious and my information is accurate. If this has peaked your interest, you are welcome to do your own research. <br /><br />My goal is not to convince you--if I have one, it is to inspire you all with an appreciation a mother of a new baby and to cut her a little slack if you&#039;re offended by the sight of her nipple.

				Sorry Casicua, I have to disagree with you there.<br /><br />Women should not be allowed to breastfeed in public. Because of the babies. If they&#039;re breastfeeding it means there are babies in public. And I hate babies in public most of all. Women who take babies into public are the most irresponsible mothers. The babies could catch diseases, be kidnapped, hurt, molested or even eaten by vile atheists. Babies are so tempting and delicious. Stop tempting the atheists!!! You don&#039;t know what we&#039;re...I mean they...are capable of. Deliciousness.<br /><br /><br />Webmamma, I don&#039;t know when you were raising kids but almost all doctors today recommend breastfeeding. I don&#039;t know what crazy websites you read for your &quot;accurate&quot; information, but they must be outdated. <br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 4pt;" class="bbc_size">I see you trolling, shaking that thread</span>

				Wow. Just read the entire article. <br /><br />Now I know where webmomma is getting a lot of her misinformation.<br /><br />That article clearly states that the article is an opinion. i.e. some of the things that are said in there are the author&#039;s opinion and not fact. Like the ridiculous statement that the reason why people have a problem with breastfeeding is because they have sexualized breasts according to the author. <br /><br />It should also be noted that the author of that article has an agenda and might be *gasp* as biased as those terrible pharmaceutical companies. <br /><br />I actually think the logic goes like this: &quot;Here&#039;s an article that&#039;s 7 years old that states that women have the right to breastfeed in public, therefore they must have _just_ got the right to breastfeed and everyone is a misogynist. <br /><br />boobies.

				I particularly like this completely unbiased and 100% true statement made by the article:<br /><br />&quot;Asking a breastfeeding mother to nurse in a bathroom or cover herself up is an unnecessary barrier to breastfeeding and the mere fear of such intervention causes many mothers to either never begin breastfeeding or to prematurely wean their infants&quot;<br /><br />I am completely 100% sure that is the #1 reason that most women decide not to breastfeed. It has nothing to do with the fact that bottle is a thousand times easier than breastfeeding, no special diet required (you are aware you should be on a special diet if you&#039;re breastfeeding, right?) and isn&#039;t *gasp* bad for babies. <br /><br />It&#039;s clearly the fear that you might be asked to not flap your boob around in public that keeps women from breastfeeding. Or the pain that causes them to wean &quot;prematurely&quot; when they start to teeth.

				The fact that the article is 7 years old and little has changed (except that a few hospitals have become baby friendly [duh, what&#039;s that?]) more than makes my point.

				Actually, Casicua, unless I&#039;m mistaken the website she linked to <strong>says the same thing as the other ones you linked to</strong>. That you should eat a healthy and balanced diet as opposed to empty calories and crap. How is his website with their evil sponsors in any way different than yours? Although your website doesn&#039;t warn against the VERY REAL EFFECT OF DRUGS ON BREASTFEEDING. <br /><br />And also, that website DOES have commercial interests and sponsors. I&#039;m not saying its information is in any way wrong, but they have ads AND they sell stuff. How could you possibly deduce that they don&#039;t have a commercial interest? Also, they have a clear agenda. <br /><br />Because they&#039;re a non-profit? I hate to tell you this, but non-profit just means that they don&#039;t have shareholders. Trust me when I say the CEO has a vested interest in the company doing well because that&#039;s how they get paid. Along with any of the employees they have. <br /><br />I have a friend who recently went to work for a non-profit in CT. Guess what? They operate just like any other business. Except what they&#039;re doing theoretically &quot;helps&quot; people. The only difference is when they&#039;re doing well the shareholders don&#039;t get paid, the members of the board just vote for a bigger bonus for themselves or a bigger raise. <br /><br />I worked for a (religious) non-profit company in college. Guess what? STILL ran like a business.

				cassicua--<br /><br />Not everything revolves around you personally or what name people would call you. Apparently no power on earth can persuade you that anything is more important than your sensibilities or divest you of your insensitivity.<br /><br />Apparently in all the male posturing about how smart you are you revealed your shocking ignorance about the real world. You are also being very &quot;guy&quot; in your kowtowing to the authority of a doctor. How many fathers have I seen begging their wives to get an epidural &#039;cause the doctor said so?<br /><br />What happens when you raise kids is you learn how fallible doctors are and how scared they are of law suits.<br /><br />Doctors have been VERY GOOD at APPEARING to be supportive of breastfeeding, though giving mothers free samples of formula &quot;just in case.&quot; They also routinely recommend weaning to fix common bf problems. Because they just simply don&#039;t know anything about bf--and have no training in med school for it!<br /><br />Ditto for hospitals. Meanwhile, neither offers much practical help or information about breastfeeding, nor do they refer to lactation consultants or follow-up. If a mom wants to bf, she&#039;s pretty much on her own if she has problems. Luckily, there&#039;s LLL, but a lot of red tape and phone calls to find a leader. More to find a IBCLC, and then her expenses are generally NOT covered by insurance (it&#039;s about $500-$800 for a full visit and follow-up). Even if there&#039;s a IBCLC on the maternity floor, she works 9-5, has the whole floor and about 10 mins per mom. Most bf problems appear after 3 days when the mom is back home, anyway. And all she has from the hospital is that free gallon-sized sample of formula...&quot;just in case&quot;...<br /><br />Yes, even the American Academy of Pediatrics is not snow-white pure as it was found that they were accepting free copies of breastfeeding books from a well-known formula manufacturer and distributing them. Only recently have they agreed to take formula advertising from their site. <br /><br /><br />Good reliable information about breastfeeding, which do not accept donations from formula companies<br /><br />Baby Friendly: a designation of hospital or birthing center, that among other things, do not accept free formula, give out free formula samples to new moms <br />www.babyfriendlyusa.org/<br /><br />LLL: foremost authority on breastfeeding, 99% volunteer organization, 100% member supported. <br />www.llli.org<br /><br />Good sites for practical bf info (again, no ties to formula):<br /><br />Kellymom.org (shes a LLL leader and a IBCLC)<br />www.kellymom.com/<br /><br />Newman Breastfeeding Clinic &amp; Institute<br />www.drjacknewman.com/<br /><br />

Because they just simply don&#039;t know anything about bf--and have no training in med school for it!<br /><br />Ditto for hospitals. Meanwhile, neither offers much practical help or information about breastfeeding, nor do they refer to lactation consultants or follow-up. If a mom wants to bf, she&#039;s pretty much on her own if she has problems. Luckily, there&#039;s LLL, but a lot of red tape and phone calls to find a leader. More to find a IBCLC, and then her expenses are generally NOT covered by insurance (it&#039;s about $500-$800 for a full visit and follow-up). Even if there&#039;s a IBCLC on the maternity floor, she works 9-5, has the whole floor and about 10 mins per mom. Most bf problems appear after 3 days when the mom is back home, anyway. And all she has from the hospital is that free gallon-sized sample of formula...&quot;just in case&quot;...<br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is just plain wrong.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know where you had your child but we just had a baby last August in NYC and they were very supportive around BF.&nbsp; Yes they give samples but they also help out in which ever way you like.&nbsp; The vibe we got was that samples are given because this culture of ours is still into formula as the main stream method just like most mothers to be in NYC seem to go for epidurals and planned births.&nbsp; NOT ALL but many.&nbsp; How do I know this?&nbsp; Because the nursing staff was pleasantly surprised that my wife wanted to go natural all the way.&nbsp; We were told it was not the usual deal.&nbsp; <br /><br />So maybe just chill here.&nbsp; We all can see who sides up on both sides of the argument and some of you will never see the other side.&nbsp;

Congratulations! <br /><br />You still got the samples, though, and they&#039;ve been shown to lower women&#039;s bf success. As for &quot;plain wrong&quot; means that your experience was different, for you at that hospital at that time. And I&#039;m glad to be wrong!<br /><br />Still, if you had a latch-on issue, I doubt your pediatrician would be able to help unless his name is Dr. Jack Newman, nor would he/she refer to an IBCLC. <br /><br />In England, where they have National Health Care, a lady comes to the new mother&#039;s house, has a cuppa tea and asks, &quot;so how are things going?&quot;<br /><br />Because breastfeeding is good for the health and it is cheaper for them to do that. Here, dollar is king and hospitals cannot bring themselves to pay for formula rather than get it for free with the strings attached, though they know it is not in the best interests of mother and baby health-wise. Should the mother of your child need practical breastfeeding assistance, you can find IBCLCs at http://www.nylca.org/find_a_lactation_consultant/. You will have to pay and it will not be reimbursed by any insurance unless she&#039;s also also a RN or a nutritionist.<br /><br /><br />

New mothers are <em>set up to fail</em> due to lack of readily-available help, information and support, then made to feel guilty when they don&#039;t succeed. Is that a <strong>choice</strong>? Rock-and-a-hard-place, sounds like.<br /><br />Women are not handed the formula and given information that it can make it harder to bf, that the baby needs the first two weeks of near-constant nursing to build an adequate milk supply and where to go for free help if it hurts or is not working. Nor are they told that an epidural can make the baby to sleepy to stimulate that supply. Baby wakes up and there&#039;s not enough milk--oh, well, I guess we&#039;ll just have to &quot;supplement.&quot;<br /><br />Yes, there are women who have all the information and choose to bottle-feed formula. I support their <strong>choice</strong>, which hopefully was not made under duress and due to lack of help, information and support and the availability of the free formula samples. I don&#039;t understand it, but I support it.<br /><br />HIV/AIDs, cancer-related therapies such as chemotherapy, and lupus, drug abuse are various conditions in which the mother should consider formula. Like cesareans, it is great to have but over-done and over-used. As I said before, some low-income moms really have no choice since there is nowhere to pump, and no time to pump.<br /><br />And guess what? There are babies that latch right on, nurse like gangbusters, and the mom never needs help!<br /><br />What I find &quot;offensive&quot; about bottles and formula and especially bottle-propping is not offense at the mom. It is the reminder that at our culture and health care system does to women when they give birth. That, I find offensive.<br />

				I guess breastfeeding is a normally not a big deal...it is after all human nature to want to feed your children. However, there is always a proper place for everything. If your baby is really hungry, why not do it somewhere discrete like inside a comfort room? Since there are quite a number of people who have pet peeves against public breastfeeding, why not try to appease both sides by allotting a specific place where mothers can breastfeed their babies?

				The &quot;proper place&quot; to breastfeed a child is anywhere when that child is hungry. <br />Yes, done discreetly. <br />&quot;Comfort rooms&quot;, not always available. Mostly larger department stores... I recommend Lord and Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue, but again, I am not always( actually ,almost never) in those stores.<br />I have some difficulty with trying to put a breastfeeding mother/child in a certain place simply to &quot;appease both sides&quot;.<br />Breastfeeding mothers do not need to hide themselves away in order to nourish their child. It is their right( by law , unfortunately, IMO), to breastfeed in public.

				I&#039;m happy we are beating this dead horse.<br /><br />You cannot ask for decorum from a breastfeeding mama.&nbsp; There is no undignified way to breastfeed.<br />As has been said, as we as people become more &quot;enlightened&quot;, not wanting to see a breastfeeding child in public will be as &quot;faux pas&quot; as not wanting to see an interracial couple in public.<br /><br />The only choice involved in breastfeeding is whether or not you are going to breastfeed.&nbsp; <br />The choice is with the onlooker.&nbsp; To look away or not.&nbsp; If you choose not to, I can assure you that you are watching a most natural thing that mom and child have been partaking in since Adam and Eve.

				I can&#039;t believe that even after all 12 pages, there are still people arguing against something that hasn&#039;t even been said.<br /><br />- As far as I can read on this thread, most people here is OK with public breastfeeding<br />- Almost nobody, as far as I&#039;ve read here, thinks breastfeeding should be illegal, or confined to non-public places. <br />- A lot of people would <strong>prefer</strong> not to see a strangers exposed breast <strong>if avoidable</strong><br />- Some of us would <strong>prefer</strong>, as a matter of <em>manners</em>, that a mother try to breastfeed at a reasonable level of discretion. <br /><br />Really, what is it that entitles people to the &quot;if you don&#039;t like it, then look away&quot; policy? I would be interested to see what happens when someone says that to you next time something inappropriate, but legal, happens in front of you and your child. <br />(And I cannot believe you are equating this to racism.

We all modify our behavior. And I really don&#039;t think that the modification is shameful. Or meant to make one feel shame. <br /><br />However, something just hit me that i will put out here because....at this moment of enlightenment, I think I see some of the other side of the argument. Over the last five years, I have lived with another man whom I love. One part of that interaction between us is our public (For lack of a better word) display of our being together. We will, at times, casually hold hands when we are walking down the street. Not because we are trying to throw it in people&#039;s faces, but because it feels right at the moment. The other aspect is the quick kiss goodbye. He maybe going to the subway and I&#039;m heading to the store and as our paths separate we will give each other a kiss good-bye. Quick and painless. And again, not because we are trying to prove anything...but because we know we won&#039;t see each other for a few hours. <br /><br />At the beginning, I did have a hesitation here. Now this is a bit off topic, but pertinent. My fear was that when someone saw us kissing, it may lead to an attack. But, over time, it just became natural. Two people acting as any couple would. <br /><br />Now, to go to the other side of the argument. At no time would I stand with him in front of the subway and start making out. Rubbing him up and down his chest and french kissing him etc. Why, you ask? Because I don&#039;t think anyone should be making out in public. It&#039;s not about whether it is natural or not....because it sure as hell feels natural to me. But I would never do it in public and I don&#039;t think anyone should. And I have a feeling most would agree with me. Otherwise I&#039;d see it all the time on the subway as opposed to the occasional groping I see now. <br /><br />I hope this makes sense because I really believe that many here are not trying to be hateful to mothers. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				um hi...I haven&#039;t posted in a while, but this topic...i can&#039;t leave it alone. I will also confess that I did not go through all 12 pages but did want to share my experience. <br /><br />I nursed for a year (dont&#039; know why just did). The first few months were a mess, and I was filled with anxiety. I did not want to stay cooped up in the house in the spring, which is actually very unhealthy for postpartum mommy and baby alike. So I went out when I could.<br /><br />A newborn, needs to eat when hungry, and they don&#039;t always wait for a nice little private place to do it. And some moms, like myself, are new to nursing, and still pretty freaked out by it. Our first concern is to tend to the little one, not to the feelings of others around us. Now, I always had a cover over my &quot;top-boob&quot; (which really isn&#039;t that offensive). But this did not always please babygirl, and she would pull at it, rip at it, cry, or a thoughtless wind would come by and blow it off, leaving me horrified and scrambling to cover up. <br /><br />Some moms will be more sensitive, others won&#039;t, and I think that everyone understands that it is within the legal rights of a mom, and that it is important for baby&#039;s etc....but, what I don&#039;t get is the horror of it all. I don&#039;t understand why some people react with such disgust (and liken nursing to farting? really?? are they that similar?). Breast and tush cleavage are everywhere, but nursing is seen (by some, not all) as some act that needs to be done in private. Even those against nursing in public have to understand that it isn&#039;t healthy to always stay out of the public eye, and it isn&#039;t always possible to tell how much time you have between feedings. It is very unrealistic and unfair to assume that it is possible for parents to gauge this, especially within the context of accomplishing other activities as well. <br /><br />Now I&#039;m not saying waving nipples around at AStoria park is the way to go, but things don&#039;t always work out the way you want. For example:<br /><br />Last summer, baby girl was 2 or 3 months old, i was walking down ditmars and she woke up and was crying like someone was stabbing her (try dealing with that for a little while and why don&#039;t you tell the baby to &quot;wait&quot; to eat). I was trapped with a stroller and over 30 blocks from home. I stopped into Martha&#039;s which was empty at that time of day, and asked for a table all the way to the side of the building, practically near the dumpster where no one else was sitting. I ordered a cheesecake and proceeded to get ready to nurse. Baby girl had calmed down, and was quietly eating under my wrap. As the waitress comes by to bring my cheesecake, babygirl chose that moment to yank the blanket down in front of my female server. The woman, looked at me, rolled her eyes, loudly placed my plate down, huffed, gave me no eye contact and walked away. I did not see her the rest of my time there and I had to go find my check at the end. I found this behavior disgraceful and even hurtful (and I have not returned to Martha&#039;s since). The point is, i did everything in my power to be discrete, and there is still no pleasing her, and why should we when this is the reaction you get to a very natural thing. <br /><br />So, I try to cover up as best as possible, but it doesn&#039;t always work. But even if it didn&#039;t, aren&#039;t there worse things to get riled up about? Like just about everything else?

				kempstern: I realize folks are generally not being hateful to nursing mothers. But, I think at the heart of the matter is the potential for glimpsing a bit of breast or nipple.I see more breast tissue exposed in some advertising. Maybe not so many nipples. But, then again, when a woman is breastfeeding, generally you don&#039;t see much nipple.<br />I appreciate the analogy of &quot;making out&quot; to breastfeeding, BUT, they are really not the same. &nbsp;<br />A breastfeeding mother is feeding her child, she is not&quot; making out.&quot;<br />Breastfeeding is not a &quot;behavior &quot; that needs to be modified for the public.<br /><br />Alexa, I feel for you with the episode at Martha&#039;s Bakery. It is shameful for someone to judge a woman nursing her child.And at a bakery/restaurant where everyone else is eating/drinking !<br />casicua: this discussion has gone on for 12+ pages because it has gone beyond discreetly breastfeeding, to people being upset that a mother would nurse her child in public.

				Okay, I had to see what the fuss was about on this thread.<br /><br />Glancing over the pages (no I did not read all of the posts, nor do I intend to), as someone who does not have a child, nor the capacity to breastfeed, I want to state the following:<br /><br />Casucia/paratactical/speebs/etc - it seems as though the overall <strong>tone </strong> of your messages is against breastfeeding.&nbsp; I know you are trying to make the point that it is about being discreet, but&nbsp; you are coming across as extremely anti-breastfeeding in the tone of the posts (neg nod away).&nbsp; For example likening breastfeeding to farting/smoking/swearing lumps breastfeeding into a category of acts that many deem inappropriate or negative period.<br /><br />MomMT/kathyjean/etc - While I understand why you are coming across defensively, I don&#039;t think it is necessarily helping.&nbsp; I think the last few posts, about how it can be a challenge to be discreet helps, and maybe more information or examples would be helpful?

				&nbsp;Breastfeeding is the most natural, healthy way to feed a child.

				I honestly don&#039;t want your straws.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D<br /><br />If I was manually expressing milk all over the subway without the baby attached then I could see how I am &quot;excreting&quot; bodily fluids (like peeing) but since you aren&#039;t seeing any fluids........&nbsp; ?????&nbsp; Yes, yes, I understand breastfeeding DOES involve excreting bodily fluids but to me, saying it like that, it sounds like I am peeing or spitting everywhere.<br /><br />I REALLY REALLY do see more breast on the subway from women that have no children in sight.

It&#039;s their job. I have no problem with the idea of them handing out flyers or doing their job, however, they don&#039;t have to stand at the top or bottom of a set of subway stairs preventing the flow of traffice.<br /><br />Breastfeed - it&#039;s a good thing for babies. There are a thousand wonderful reasons to breastfeed and, personally, I think it&#039;s a very beautiful thing both for its naturalness and the symbolism of the connection between the mother and child. However, several posters in this thread in support of breastfeeding seem to have a very &quot;I do what I want when I want how I want and I don&#039;t care about anybody else&quot; attitude. That, to me, is the conflict here and is, apparently, an attitude that refuses to attempt to see the other side of an issue.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure that there are difficulties in being constantly discreet. I understand that things happen. Towels can flip and blow over in the wind; babies can tug and reveal things, getting a child to latch can be hard. I don&#039;t need a 100% ability to cover up, I just think it&#039;s a polite, courteous and decent thing to be perceptive and try to be considerate of others. That, to me, doesn&#039;t mean not breastfeeding, waiting to breastfeed or that I have negative feelings toward breastfeeding.

				KathyJean this is where the communication is breaking down. This thread is specifically about women who make no effort to cover while breast feeding in public. This thread is not about public breast feeding in general which none of us have any problem with in theory. It&#039;s about consideration for those around you and trying to cover when breast feeding. Honestly, I&#039;ve seen women not covering a few times in parks and in general around the city in my lifetime. While it&#039;s not something I really enjoy seeing, generally I don&#039;t care. What I care about is the attitude that &quot;eff you if you don&#039;t like it, turn away and deal with it&quot; which is not really productive to living in a civil society.

Look at something like public kissing, I am in full support of people being in love, but there are (in my opinion) appropriate and inappropriate times to do so. <br />I think I can confidently say that everyone on this thread has agreed that a mother should have the choice to breastfeed her child if she sees fit to do so. The social stigma is not on the act of breastfeeding, it is on the exposure of a lactating breast. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s necessarily a deterrent to the general act of breastfeeding.&nbsp; It just slightly grosses me out to see an exposed lactating breast, but if it is accidental, then whatever- it happens.

Women walking around in low-cut shirts, skitrs, etc can cross a line that I think many people would deem inappropriate. It is all completely subjective, of course, but I can personally attest to some outfits that I&#039;ve seen in public( worn by both guys and girls) where I think to myself &quot;Wow, that was more than I really want to see&quot; and would label their outfit bad etiquette or manners. <br />And that really is the whole premise of public etiquette, isn&#039;t it?

				because I obviously could never say it better...<br />Article by Hilary Stamper<br />please read the entire article at <br />http://www.care2.com/greenliving/breast-is-best-but-dont-show-your-nipple.html<br /><br />&quot;...To alleviate this discomfort, now for sale are the increasingly common boob burkas designed to hide the nursing baby and breast from public. Perhaps they help some mothers feel safer nursing in public, but these “aids” also help seal the secret, increase the mystery of the nursing babe. Is it possible that one day, nursing will only be allowed in private breastfeeding rooms unless you don the Hooter Hider? Maybe we should ask the women in Afghanistan - I wonder if they foresaw the current requisite attire for women in their country.<br /><br />One might argue, “but things are getting so much better.” “Everyone is stressing the importance of Breast is Best.” And even, “The breastfeeding militia is forcing the breast on everyone!” But look European paintings from the 1200’s-1800’s that include women breastfeeding - you can even see Virgin Mary’s nipple! These were times when women were clad from head to toe in clothing, yet they popped out their breast to feed their babies. And the painters sharing this history had no qualms about what fraction of the nipple was exposed.<br /><br />It had to start somewhere, this forced covering of a woman’s body. Women in Afghanistan wear burkas to hide their entire body. Conversely, but equally sexually, Americans highlight the flat chests of 4-year-olds with pink triangle bikinis. We feature cleavage in woman’s worksuit attire. So hail the plastic nursing nipple, for it allows us to claim the woman’s body for one exclusive purpose: sexual arousal. We can almost forget that Mother Nature intended her breast to nourish. Almost, but not quite because the plastic nipple still holds that pesky shape, which looks remarkably…nipple-like.<br /><br />When a woman’s body becomes more about sex than anything else, it limits what a woman can do. It becomes something she uses to attract and please others, something others want to control. I grew up on the Southern California coast, playing my socially acceptable role as a bikini-clad teen shrieking down the beach on episodes of Baywatch. After years of encouraging my own objectification, I’ve been pleasantly surprised by the empowerment I’ve experienced using my body for nourishment as a mother. And while this might not be everyone’s experience, why do we allow society to dictate but one singular purpose for all of our female bodies? When a woman is empowered to use her own body to nourish her children, it puts her in charge. Does this scare people?<br /><br />Each of us can do our part to make the nursing mother feel safe and confident feeding her baby by normalizing images of breastfeeding. Or, we can hide the nursing mother, heightening the mystery and even shame associated with her nursing breasts. It strikes me that we as a culture might need to address our obsession with breasts as purely sexual “objects” to make reasonable progress. What do you think?...&quot;<br /><br />

I don&#039;t think that her argument is relegated to women. Bodies of men and women are both used in media, advertisement, etc as sex objects- whether it is cleavage, butts, abs, biceps, or whatever. I think society draws the line at nudity- which technically, breastfeeding is. Like I said before, we already make the legal exception for a nursing child, which is great, but also doesn&#039;t mean that everyone wants to see it. In any other case, we would find nudity in public unacceptable. It&#039;s not just women- there is a stigma towards nudity in general. I really don&#039;t think every woman would find it pleasant if every guy walked around with his shirt off. <br />It doesn&#039;t make you sexist, it means you don&#039;t want to see every stranger naked. <br />

Only because I think there is agreement here amongst the principle posters...but that we seem to be circling around each other. <br /><br />I think the article is interesting because I started to reflect on the Victorian era that created many of the sexual hang-ups we see today. Including my reference two days ago to my kissing my partner goodbye. I was thinking that this includes breastfeeding. Because we are at a time in our history where we are tearing down past taboos that make no sense or were created to keep men in a superior position. In many ways MomMT, I feel we are fighting the same battle. On a different level of course...but the journey feels the same. <br /><br />And I think this because of what Alexa posted regarding what she went through at Martha&#039;s Bakery. At NO TIME should a mother go through what she went through with the waitress rolling her eyes. And I debated if I should say that it is because she did the right thing. Only because I feel that she did what she felt was the best thing at the moment. Because of the hang-ups that still grip our society. We need to get past that. And we will. Just as one day we will get past me and my partner holding hands. <br /><br />You know, for me personally, this is about finding a balance....but also making people realize that there is no shame in this. I think that is the goal we need to pursue. <br /><br />These are just my personal feelings about this thread that is not intended to reflect on anyone else&#039;s comments.

				Wowzers. That article seriously compares breast feeding in public to women being forced to wear a burqa. It really boggles the mind. &quot;Boob burqas&quot;?!?! So are underwear &quot;vagina burqas&quot; and are socks &quot;foot burqas&quot;? I have breasts. They are not a solely sexual object for me though I&#039;d still rather not parade mine around because they are a sexual object to other people and I&#039;m pretty sure no amount of internet arguing will change that. Do I want to see someone else&#039;s baby sucking on their nipple and a bodily substance coming out of said nipple on my morning train ride? No. Does that make me part of the repressive patriarchy? I guess so. Breast feeding is already socially acceptable (as we&#039;ve all said we don&#039;t mind it at all), it&#039;s legal, it&#039;s recommeneded by most every Dr. I feel like you&#039;re looking for a struggle so everyone can raise their fists in the air about something. Just throw a blankie over your boob if you feel like being considerate. If you feel like being inconsiderate, by all means, let that boob fly. However be prepared that you will have people eye rolling at you, probably because you&#039;re being inconsiderate more than the fact that you&#039;re breast feeding.

				I find this article to be particularly specious in its argument about the acceptability of breastfeeding throughout history. You cannot compare art to real life. For one thing, people have the choice of when and whether to consume such art. Just because artists painted women breastfeeding does not automatically mean it fit with the zeitgeist of the times. Second, the time period that they cite as supportive of breastfeeding (1200s - 1800s) include times in history when society was anti-breastfeeding. During that period, it was at times considered unhealthy (either for the mother or the child), inappropriate, or inconvenient to breastfeed. The inconvenience is, in fact, one reason why wet nurses became so popular during that time period - so women of means would not have their social lives hampered. Then came the Victorian era right afterwards when it was absolutely unacceptable to breastfeed in public because breast milk was seen as unclean and it was unacceptable to expose one&#039;s breasts in public. I just have a huge problem pointing to art in an era to support your argument when the actual practice of society at points during that time was so unforgiving of the same practice. It undermines the validity of the whole argument.

				as a mother, I submit that when a kid wants to eat, he/she wants to eat!!! Especially for infants, how can anyone chide them for their behavior? They are small and young and don&#039;t know better (and ALL of us posting have been there).&nbsp; Now, my kid is almost 5, when she whines and complains about being hungry, I quietly tell her to hush up and wait til we get off the train or if I have a snack, I whip it out.

				I&#039;m really not trying to pick a fight, just sharing.&nbsp; <br /><br />I knew I left something out when I hit post re: the covering up thing.&nbsp; But you&#039;ll remember that my opinion was (since also being mention is the consideration of others) that just being asked to cover up I considered offensive.&nbsp; And that was my opinion because I am considering the well being and happiness of my child and not the public.&nbsp; I have also mentioned that my child will throw off any cover, never mind the fact that it is 100 degrees outside.&nbsp; Anyone with children knows that you have to choose your battles.&nbsp; I do not choose to fight with my child to keep covered while nursing in public because someone that may see us might feel uncomfortable.&nbsp; My thoughts were that my action of not covering while nursing had nothing to do with the fact that I live in a &quot;civilized&quot; society, and that comment has come up here a few times.<br /><br />While being honest that the comments from the article (which WAS posted here) on another website prompted my thoughts, I also did note that the statement... &quot;because we live in a &quot;civilized&quot; society we should cover up (that&#039;s the part I forgot) while breastfeeding&quot;... HAD been mentioned here.&nbsp; That&#039;s why I thought I would share it here, with what seems more intelligent people, then with the folks that were posting comments on the articles website.<br /><br />I just like to share the side of the uncovered breastfeeding mama.&nbsp; But if I did unintentionally pick a fight... it&#039;s fun right?&nbsp; I guess I also enjoy collecting negative nods.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Cheers to everyone.&nbsp; covered, uncovered or in the closet.<br />

If the woman in question took that much time, it&#039;s not a simple coffee run or other 10 minute &quot;unauthorized break&quot;, it&#039;s hours of the day.
