				It&#039;s time for a new picture on astorians.com!<br /><br />0. Two submissions per person only - show us your best work.<br />1. Your image should be in digital format.<br />2. The picture needs to be taken with at LEAST at 3mp camera. Scanned images must be HIGH quality.<br />3. A small version of your image should be posted to this thread with a brief description of what it is.<br />4. The contest starts immediately and will run until May 10. At which time the contest will be closed to entries.<br />5. May 11-15 Astorians will vote on the submitted images.<br />6. A winner will be announced and the graphic will go live on the homepage shortly thereafter.<br /><br />Further details:<br />Your image will run for a period of weeks or months. It should be a picture that captures some aspect of Astoria, and ideally, should be a &quot;spring&quot; or &quot;summer&quot; theme. On the bottom right hand corner we&#039;ll provide your name/username/link/email whatever you want so people can link or contact you. Obviously you are giving us permission to use your image on the Astorians homepage by your submission.

				Hey,<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;If DjArturo wins( he IS in the lead) maybe you can make it a rotating header? Perhaps a new one every other week during the spring/summer seasons. Just a suggestion.

				Congratulations to DJArturo! Please give us a few days to update the picture since I&#039;m just finishing school and life is insane at the moment.<br /><br />Rotating header is a great idea - just costs money to hire a coder to do it :)<br /><br />See the &quot;become a supporter&quot; link at the bottom of the page, or feel free to buy some advertising on the site and I&#039;ll get someone on that right away.

Can&#039;t wait to see it on the board. BTW, I have a simple perl script (a CGI) I can email you that does exactly that. No coiding involved, just a tiny bit of configuration. You can see it in action on my website <strong>here (http://www.norelevance.com)</strong>. Just look on the right side for the &quot;Random Scrapbook Page&quot; and refresh the page to see the randomness in action. <br /><br />
