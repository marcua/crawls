				The list has been narrowed down for August 28th show. We&#039;re very glad to have Mundo Rivera back for another reading. I&#039;m also stoked about introducing Darien S Mytryshyn. Both poets are talented local Astorians who give excellent performances. <br />&nbsp;<br />Thank you all for the support you&#039;ve given to The Whiskey Dregs this summer. It&#039;s been a memorable season loaded with beautiful experiences. Watching artists, writers, and musicians come together with the community has been inspiring. We&#039;re not bs&#039;ing here.<br />&nbsp;<br />Here are your performers:<br />&nbsp;<br />Darien S Mytryshyn - Darien also sings and plays the guitar as We Are Darien. His his raw writing style and casual reading style has made him the perfect Whiskey Dregs poet. This is his reading at Waltz-Astoria.<br />&nbsp;<br />Mundo Rivera - This talented poet grew up in El Barrio, spinning his time writing observations of his environment. His work has been featured in many publications both off and on line. His piece entitled &quot;Chuito And The Hanging&quot; was featured in The Whiskey Dregs: Unplugged Issue # 1.<br />&nbsp;<br />Carlos Detres - You know him all ready. He writes, gets chased out of coffee houses with pitchforks for reading provocative pieces. He is skipping short stories tonight and reading from a collection of poems that he&#039;s accrued.<br />&nbsp;<br />A NIGHT WITH THE WHISKEY DREGS<br />WALTZ-ASTORIA<br />&nbsp;<br />THURSDAY 8/28 <br />PRE-PARTY AT 8PM<br />READINGS WILL GO FROM 9-10PM<br />afterwards, we can hang out at Waltz and have some drinks and spill them on each other like a bunch of schoolgirls.<br />&nbsp;<br />Waltz-Astoria<br />www.waltz-astoria.com<br />23-14 Ditmars Boulevard<br />Astoria<br />N or W to Ditmars Blvd

				We have a late addition to this event. Nate Metzker will also be reading from his new book and will have copies on hand for sale. These Whiskey Dregs events have had a few published authors so this is another slammo for our books.
