				There was a dog trainer who ran a training group in Astoria Park, although I don&#039;t know what ages they trained.&nbsp; I think it was the same trainer who lived near my old apartment on 29th St. between 23rd and 24th Ave.&nbsp; She had a sign out in front of their house that said &quot;K-9 Training School&quot;.&nbsp; I can&#039;t actually recommend them since I&#039;ve never used them or know anyone who has.&nbsp; <br /><br />In general, whenever you find a trainer, I would ask what style of training they use.&nbsp; Some dog trainers use negative training/discipline (think drill sergeant) which I don&#039;t prefer, it usually involves raising your voice or yanking on their choke chain/leash.&nbsp; Positive reinforcement works much better and it&#039;s a kinder way to train your dog.&nbsp; :-)

				Here I am reviving ghost posts again... <br /><br />I seek a local dog trainer who is not of the revanchist school of dog policy... this is to say I am less interested in punishment than reward; less interested in judgment than understanding. I need my dog to listen to me and need someone sensitive to the subtleties of human and pooch behavior who can criticize us constructively but not condescendingly.<br /><br />Any recommendations? I already know about the Saturday freebies at Astoria Park. I am quite fortunate to be able to pay for quality training.<br /><br />Thanks for any feedback.

				I wish you has been a little more specific. Are you having issues other than the dog not knowing what you expect of him? Is there any misbehaving that needs to be corrected? <br /><br />Unfortunately, dog training is not simply a matter of cost. It is more a matter of YOU being in charge of the dog&#039;s behavior. The dog MUST accept you as HIS leader, and not even try to influence you. <br /><br />My suggestion, as always, is to first take a few days to study <span class="bbc_u">NILIF</span> (http://k9deb.com/nilif.htm) and review if you are doing it correctly before you bring an outsider into the picture.

				there is a dog trainer by the name of Sophia at 36th street between 30th and 31st aves <br />I can get her number next time I see her if you like. Her clients are mostly in the city so this would be alot <br />easier for her.

				I&#039;ve used this trainer.&nbsp; She makes house calls and has classes but they&#039;re in Brooklyn.&nbsp; Maybe if a couple of you got together. Anyway, she was helpful for me and my dog.<br /><br />http://www.empireofthedog.com/nyc/index.html<br />
