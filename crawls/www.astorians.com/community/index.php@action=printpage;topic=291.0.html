				Hello,<br /><br />This is a bit of a strange request. But here goes:<br /><br />I&#39;m going to be getting married in May. My parents, among others are coming out for the wedding of course and will be here for 4 days. From May 19-23.<br /><br />Instead of paying for some random hotel that&#39;s far away from where I live, I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s anyone that would like to take a vacation during that time and let us sublet your apartment. We&#39;ll pay $50/night.<br /><br />I&#39;ll only have responsible, and clean people stay there. So don&#39;t worry about any parties going on or anything. They just need a clean, smoke-free, place to sleep.<br /><br />Here&#39;s what would be ideal:<br /><br />- You live within a block or two of Ditmars.<br />- You have one Queen (or bigger) size bed.<br />- Your apartment is clean and smoke-free.<br /><br />Let me know if you are interested in working something out.

				I'm in Amsterdam from May 21-28 - I'd be delighted to sublet for those days. &nbsp;I'm on 30th Ave, though, so it all depends on how desperate you are.

				I do have a queen-size bed, and I'm about 5 blocks from the N/W. &nbsp;I also have a futon that folds out into a double bed.

				This would work fine except I need them to stay there starting earlier than the 21st. Thanks for the offer!<br /><br />Is there anyone else that has an apartment they'd like to sublet for a few days around that date?
