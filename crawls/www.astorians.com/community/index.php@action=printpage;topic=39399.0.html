				I saw a lot of signs in the Ditmars area for a new comedy club on 29th St. between Ditmars and 23rd Ave.&nbsp; I think the show costs $35 and that includes 2 drinks.&nbsp; I think the price is $20 in advance.&nbsp; This will be competition for QED

				First of all I believe I posted the wrong prices for this show.&nbsp; I believe that it&#039;s $45 with 2 drinks at the door and $30 in advance.&nbsp; I think that&#039;s kind of expensive.&nbsp; QED is cheaper.&nbsp; Anyway, QED looks like a coffee shop when you first walk in.&nbsp; They have tables and chairs to sit.&nbsp; In the back and separated from the coffee shop is an area with a small stage for shows and tables and chairs for the audience.&nbsp; It&#039;s a very casual atmosphere and if you go to see a show they don&#039;t require you to buy any drinks.&nbsp; Most of the shows are stand up comedy, but there are other types of shows also.&nbsp; They also have classes in the back area like swing dancing, painting, etc.

				I believe this is just a comedy show at The Stathakion Center which hosts various events, not an actual comedy club. <br /><br />
