				I&#039;d have to say that, recently, watching these idiots in both parties that are running for president pander to, lie to, and BS the public, as well as each other, only to be followed up by the, most cases, horrible commentary by the talking heads is enough to make me want to hurl.&nbsp; <br /><br />How many years in politics and, just before she beefs it in NH, Hillary Clinton starts crying and people are swayed?&nbsp; Huckabee makes a comment about how he lowered taxes RIGHT after the commentator presents the fact that he RAISED them, yet people still clap at his answer.&nbsp; He blatantly LIED.&nbsp; Giuliani can&#039;t finish a sentence without 9/11 or terror in it; Obama can&#039;t stop talking about bombing other countries, yet he talks about &quot;change&quot; constantly.&nbsp; Fred Thompson does what he does best and &quot;acts&quot; like he wants the job; Edwards parades a family of a leukemia victim around to garner the anti-corporate support.&nbsp; McCain and many of the others, too, think we should just STAY in Iraq for years and continue the war, spending billions more dollars that we don&#039;t have and losing more American lives.<br /><br />Edgy candidates that might ACTUALLY bring about some changes and that don&#039;t pander to the general public by promising free lunches, like Kucinich and Paul, are looked at like crazies and ganged up on by the other candidates and the media and disregarded by the general public.&nbsp; <br /><br />Instead, you have candidates talking about how they&#039;re going to fix the economy and keep people in their houses.&nbsp; Don&#039;t get me wrong, I don&#039;t want to see people tossed on the street.&nbsp; However, I don&#039;t want to use tax dollars (again, which we don&#039;t have) to be subsidizing other people&#039;s greed and incompetence.&nbsp; They are killing the principles of a free market because it&#039;s more popular than letting what should and needs to happen; happen.<br /><br />Sorry to vent and bring politics to a non-political thread, but the culmination of all of this crap is just overwhelming and pissing me off.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is making me want to hurl.

				***<br /><br />The justices rejected a lawsuit brought by Margarita Lopez Torres, a Brooklyn Surrogate Court judge who, as an elected Civil Court judge, tried unsuccessfully to get the Brooklyn Democratic Party’s backing to run for State Supreme Court.

				&quot;Hurl&quot; might be a strong word, but I just had to vent about a minor pet peeve.<br /><br />Whenever people post on this website, and the topic contains the word &quot;Astoria&quot; or &quot;in Astoria,&quot; etc. I mean, it&#039;s the <em>Astorians</em> website! It&#039;s a given that if you&#039;re looking for &quot;best pizza&quot; or &quot;bars that are gone&quot; or &quot;TV show premiere,&quot; it&#039;s most likely got to do with Astoria in some way, shape or form.<br /><br />Ideally, if it&#039;s not about Astoria, then post in Random Gabble or simply specify the area you ARE discussing. Like if somebody&#039;s moving away and want to know &quot;best pizza in East Orange, NJ,&quot; THEN you post the name of the neighborhood.<br /><br />Again, I realize that this is not something on par with {{{retch}}} canned pork brains in milk or {{{gag}}} seriously neglected apartments. But I had to get it out of my system!&nbsp; :roll:
