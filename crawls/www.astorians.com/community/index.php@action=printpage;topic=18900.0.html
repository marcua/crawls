				&nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br />Brian is an English and Irish given name,[1] as well as an Irish, English, and French surname.[2] It is possible that the name is derived from an Old Celtic word meaning &quot;high&quot; or &quot;noble&quot;.[1] For example the element bre means &quot;hill&quot;; which could be transferred to mean &quot;eminence&quot; or &quot;exalted one&quot;.[2] The name is quite popular in Ireland, on account of Brian Boru, a 10th century king of Ireland. The name was also quite popular in East Anglia during the Middle Ages. This is because the name was introduced to England by Bretons following the Norman Conquest.[1] Bretons also settled in Ireland along with the Normans in the 12th century, and &#039;their&#039; name was mingled with the &#039;Irish&#039; version.[2] Also, in the north-west of England, the &#039;Irish&#039; name was introduced by Scandinavian settlers from Ireland. Within the Gaelic speaking areas of Scotland, the name was at first only used by professional families of Irish origin.[1]<br /><br />The surname Brian is sometimes an English and Irish variant spelling of the surname Bryan. The English and French surname Brian is sometimes derived from the personal Celtic personal name shown above. The surname Brian can also sometimes be a French surname; derived from the Old Occitan word brian, meaning &quot;maggot&quot; and used as a nickname.[2]<br /><br />Variants of the name include Briant, Brien, Bran, Brion, Bryan, Bryant, Brj√°nn (in Icelandic) and Bryon<br />

				Of the tribe of Judah, CALEB the son of Jephunneh. <br />Nu 13:30 <br />And CALEB stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it. <br />Nu 14:6 <br />And Joshua the son of Nun, and CALEB the son of Jephunneh, which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes: <br />Nu 14:24 <br />But my servant CALEB, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it. <br />Nu 14:30 <br />Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware to make you dwell therein, save CALEB the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. <br />
