				You should try to find a way to post it on a website that won&#039;t require people to sign up for the site to view it. You will get a lot more people to read your information.

				Hi everyone my name is Sophia and im 2 yrs old almost 3. I have a rare and serious condition called aplastic anemia, which means I have almost complete bone marrow failure. The doctors say that I will not survive a bone marrow transplant from on outside donor, and I am really sick. So the only option to save my life is if my mommy has a special procedure, to have an HLA identical sibling, so I can get a transplant from my sibling to save my life, and cure me. But insurance doesn&#039;t cover this, and it is a LOT of money, so we need some help! If you want to know how you can help, you can make a donation to Sophia&#039;s fund and help me get better. Please make contributions to Sophia Tavolacci and mail it to Sophia&#039;s Fund, P.O. BOX 770423 Woodside, NY 11377 There&#039;s no amount to small, every penny counts and could help save my life. If you cant help with a donation, please pray for me to get better. BIG Hugs-Sophia PS- I have my own web site http://www.caringbridge.org/visit/sophiatavolacci

				Joey, I can&#039;t believe I&#039;m saying this but we actually agree for once. Some may have thought this was a scam, hence the neg nods.&nbsp; The approach (written from child&#039;s pov) is what drew the neg nods, not the underlying plea.&nbsp; It&#039;s an odd way to ask for money, but this family is probably desperate.&nbsp; Sad all around.
