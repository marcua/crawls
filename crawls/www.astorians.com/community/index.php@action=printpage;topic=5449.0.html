				Hi everyone!<br /><br />Glad to find out about this board.&nbsp; I&#039;m a painter who has lived in this neighborhood for a long time, and somehow have had a hard time linking up with other artists.&nbsp; (maybe because I&#039;m shy and lock myself in my studio??)&nbsp; Anyway, I hope you&#039;ll say hi and introduce yourself!<br /><br />I know at sixteen degrees the summer seems a LONG way off, but:<br />I have a great art studio on 34th St and 36th Ave that I will be subletting for five to six months starting in July as I&#039;ve been awarded a residency out of the country.&nbsp; It&#039;s 300 sq ft with freight elevator, separate common area, kitchenette, shower, etc. and a killer rooftop.&nbsp; It is work only, which means no, unfortunately you can&#039;t live there.&nbsp; $700/month - which is the true rent.<br /><br />Thought I&#039;d mention it now, in case anyone is thinking this far ahead with a &quot;what if...?&quot; scenario.&nbsp; Maybe you and a friend (or two) have always wanted to do THAT PROJECT but just haven&#039;t had the space?&nbsp; Maybe you want to commit to really focusing on your art this summer, but don&#039;t want to commit to a long lease?&nbsp; I&#039;ve held group figure drawing sessions here, had small shows, etc, etc.<br /><br />Ok, so I&#039;m sounding like a saleswoman.&nbsp; I don&#039;t mean to - I would just love to find someone cool, reliable and local who could USE the space (there aren&#039;t that many artist studios for rent in Astoria) and not have to deal with a trail of broken craigslist appointments this time around.<br /><br />Stay warm!!&nbsp; :wink:<br /><br />

				I have a friend who I shared a studio space with who might be looking for a space in LIC/Astoria.&nbsp; Is the space still available?&nbsp; Do you have an email address that I can pass on to her?<br /><br />I too haven&#039;t been very good about reaching out to other artists in the area, and just found this board!
