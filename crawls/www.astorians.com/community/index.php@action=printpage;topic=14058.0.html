				Mostly I want to give praise to St. Honore Patisserie&#039;s amazing delicious coconut custard pies, but a little bit I want to damn them for being so good that I can&#039;t walk by the place when I spy one in the window.&nbsp; Sucks me in right off the sidewalk like a supersized magnet.<br /><br />The pies are so good because they have the perfect consistency, and the perfect balance of sweetness.&nbsp; In other words, they&#039;re are subtly, and not too, sweet.&nbsp; Plus an excellent crust.<br /><br />I love St. Honore for many things (great quiches, amazing bread pudding, fab cookies, etc.), but right now, the coconut custard pie is kind in our house.

				<br />I have enjoyed many things at St Honore. But no matter the place, I stay clear of coconut pies.<br /><br />What do you like to get elsewhere?<br />I would like to find a place with a great chocolate cream pie - - -<br /><br />drool&nbsp; &nbsp; :smitten:<br /><br />Some people swear by other places, but those bakeries have not made a connection for me.

				I think St. Honore is one of the gems of Astoria.&nbsp; I seldom here folks talk about it, but almost everything that i have had there has been great.&nbsp; It is as good as most (not all) french bakeries in Manhattan and half the price.&nbsp; I think their baguettes are some of the best around.&nbsp; The French guy who I believe is the baker/owner always asks how i like things and wants a sincere answer when asking.&nbsp; I recently got a donut and the following weekend I was getting a baguette...he asked me how I liked the donut from the previous week.&nbsp; I was impressed with that as I am only there about once every 10 days or so.&nbsp; I enjoy both the pear and apple tarts as well as the fresh marshmallows that they have.&nbsp; &nbsp;Once and a while he makes apple dumplings which are incredible...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I have had the worst croissants from there--doughy, horribly cooked, giant. Gross. I&#039;ve had a dry awful apple tart. And that was it. If a bakery with a French name can&#039;t make croissants or apple tarts, then I&#039;m never going back. Those are staples of French bakeries! And reading all this praise of that place makes it clear that I can&#039;t trust recs from this board. St. Honore&#039;s is a terrible bakery and should close down. Whatever made them good way back is gone.

				This bakery probably has a good rep due to its being the only game in town for French pastries (don&#039;t know where else besides DD.) Compared to what a real croissant tastes like, their version does seem a little too heavy. But they are French so who knows!! <br /><br />As for comparing them to &quot;anything in Manhattan,&quot; it&#039;s a mistake to assume that &quot;anything&quot; in Manhattan is automatically better based on geography alone.

				Since Dolce Italia went under, St. Honore has the best cheese danish in the area. Nearly everything I&#039;ve gotten from St. Honore is good-- and I&#039;m quite picky about baked goods. As with anything else done by a human being, quality is not perfectly identical from one day to the next and I can recall one occasion when my pastry was quite dense, so maybe our forceful naysayers happened to get an off day. The baguettes aren&#039;t comparable to my ideal dreams of the baguettes I had in France, but only one baguette I&#039;ve had in the U.S. is, so I hardly hold that against them. Overall, I think they have wonderful pastry and kind, helpful staff. Definitely my favorite bakery on Ditmars.

				Of course Payard and the rest are far superior- I used to work at Fauchon and understand why it was $4/large macaron flown in from Paris. Their candies and pastries were beyond anything&nbsp; :lol: (their croissants etc. were actually baked by a supplier in Queens.)<br /><br />But many well-known places in the city can coast on their reputation as well, so yes, I still say &quot;anything&quot; is a stretch. Odds are definitely better, though, that is true. I just hate the superiority complex of Manhattanites who are convinced that EVERYthing about the city justifies the crazy prices&nbsp; :wink:<br /><br />

				I&#039;m surprised to hear anything bad about St H.&nbsp; They have a chocolate rum ball that is so luxurious you can&#039;t eat a whole one in one sitting.&nbsp; You have to pause, take a break, and then come back to heavenly delight.&nbsp; The only problem is that the last two times I went they were all sold out!&nbsp; Oh, and it was <em>still</em> only $2.00 last time I had it.&nbsp; Take <em>that</em>, Manhattan!

				Gave them a shot this week: Tried the apple turnover, chocolate eclair, and a chocolate croissant.<br /><br />Turnover was pretty good, nice texture and a nice touch of sweet icing on top; eclair had a good chocolate topping but the rest of it was <em>blah</em> (flavorless custard and dull pastry); croissant lacked both chocolate and flakiness. A French bakery should at least do the French pastries well!<br /><br />Might have to continue this important research&nbsp; :wink:<br />
