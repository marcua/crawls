				I recently stopped working for a private employer, the job didn&#039;t end well...&nbsp; I have contacted them several times asking for my 2007 tax statements, but gotten no response.&nbsp; It is my understanding that W-2&#039;s must be mailed out by January 31st, is there a penalty for with holding this information- how can I get this info?!&nbsp; I was paid with personal checks and feel clueless. Thanks!&nbsp; &nbsp;

Thanks!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>The IRS web site at http:/irs.gov is a good place to look. <br /><br />One of the Frequently Asked Questions mentions Form 4852 for taxpayers who have not been able to obtain a correct W-2 or 1099.<br />http://www.irs.gov/faqs/faq-kw205.html<br /><br />The form, like many others, is available as an Adobe PDF file:<br />http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f4852.pdf<br /><br /><br />First part of instructions for form 4852:<br /><br />&quot;Purpose of form. Form 4852 serves as a substitute for Forms<br />W-2, W-2c, and 1099-R and is completed by taxpayers or their<br />representatives when (a) their employer or payer does not give<br />them a Form W-2 or Form 1099-R, or (b) when an employer or<br />payer has issued an incorrect Form W-2 or Form 1099-R. Attach<br />this form to your income tax return.&quot;<br /><br />Hope that helps.

				Cool, Thanks for the info!&nbsp; I am still not 100% sure how this all works but I guess just using the substitute form will work?&nbsp;

In that case, he still owes you a Form 1099 stating how much he paid you as a contractor.<br /><br />If you have any doubt whether taxes were withheld from your pay, or how much was withheld, or whether the employer considered you an employee or a contractor, you should get the advice of a tax accountant. You could be assessed fines and interest charges. Someone who knows how to ask for relief from these will be very useful.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know any tax accountants. Someone else may suggest one.&nbsp; You can also call someone at the IRS for advice.<br /><br />Whatever you do, if the amount is more than a few hundred dollars, don&#039;t just settle for the advice of some guy on the internet, like me.<br />
