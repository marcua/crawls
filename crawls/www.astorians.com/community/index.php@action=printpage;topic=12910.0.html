				&nbsp;:-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)<br /><br />Even though my vote was more &quot;Not McCain&quot; rather than &quot;For Obama&quot;, I am very happy that he won the election. &nbsp;I liked his victory speech 100% because he does not pretend to have a magic wand to solve the country&#039;s problems. &nbsp;His speech was close to &quot;Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country&quot;, and from him it sounds like a deal I would participate in. &nbsp;I feel we finally have our country back.

				Obama&#039;s victory is especially sweet for those who fought so hard to vote.&nbsp; <br /><br />CNN spoke to several African-American voters in Atlanta, who said that it was a bittersweet victory because their parents or grandparents weren&#039;t able to see Obama win.<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/05/us/politics/05civil.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin

				I, for one, am ecstatic over the revival of voter confidence and a campaign fairly won.<br /><br />It&#039;s just icing on the cake that doors leading to Democratic ideals - like stem cell research and gay &amp; lesbian rights - can now be opened. The dominancy of military might and fear of a secular government were really starting to get under my skin.<br /><br />It is a long hard road, and I&#039;m happy to trek it.&nbsp; :-)

				Amazing, once Ohio went blue, I knew that Obama was powering forward. I believe some stations had it practically in the bag sometime around 9PM.<br />What a great day for America. <br />I am so glad that the country was smart enough to see past the personal slander and skirted issues and vote for someone who will really take the reigns of this crisis we&#039;re in and move us forward on so many levels.<br /><br />YES WE CAN!

				I guess this doesn&#039;t bode well for cutting entitlement programs and low marginal tax rates, huh? &nbsp; :-(<br /><br />Seriously, congrats to all Obama supporters on a hard fought and excellent campaign. &nbsp;While I don&#039;t support many of the directions Obama plans to take, the people have spoken. &nbsp;The exercise of democracy is always inspiring in this country, where sweeping changes in government happen without a drop of blood being spilled. &nbsp;I just hope that we keep in mind the principles of the Founding Fathers.

I think his proposals for more affordable healthcare, lower taxes for the middle class families, and tax incentives to keep jobs in America are a good start to keeping the majority of people in America to spend the money needed to drive our consumer driven economy. <br />I also think his plan for a phased withdrawal from Iraq, who is sitting on a surplus right now, would be nice to free up some money that would help us here, where we need it, rather than support a foreign country.

IMO, the whole point of a democracy is that while my voice gets to be heard, my voice is not the only voice. My values are not the only values that matter. Sometimes, my guy will lose, and that is part of the process. I have to suck it up and do what I can to be involved and make my voice heard. Being committed to a democracy means being committed to a world where all the opinions count for something. <br /><br />I understand that Republicans are angry and feel disenfranchised. After 8 years of Bush, I know exactly how you feel. But suggesting that the only reason someone would cast their vote differently from the way you cast yours is that there is something wrong with them - they are stupid, ignorant, they do not truly understand what is at stake - is undemocratic. I don&#039;t talk that way about Republicans (despite the occasional WTF!). I understand that Republicans hold their values and beliefs as proudly as I hold mine, and I would not take that away from anyone. <br /><br />I hope that we can find a new way to move forward as a country other than with one half sulking for the next 4 (please god, 8!) years.

I think Hannity, who &nbsp;called &nbsp;Obama &nbsp;names based on his associations, was correct on who ran a more &nbsp;effective campaign. I do agree Obama/Biden was a Hollywood production, no comparison to &nbsp;the McCain/Palin campaign which stayed true to Sen. McCain&#039;s word on finance. &nbsp;I worked the election, as &nbsp;I have in Astoria, for &nbsp;the last 4 Presidential elections. This time it was different. I was given a name tag with &#039;party&#039; affiliation. This led &nbsp;to nasty comments from some Obama supporters, all day. I treat &nbsp;ALL people &nbsp;with the same civility, helped &nbsp;disabled &nbsp;voters &nbsp;who were telling me they would &nbsp;vote &nbsp;for &nbsp;Obama. It is &nbsp;their right, but, it appears &nbsp;that civility is a &nbsp;one way street. When I came out at 10PM, I went to my car, my McCain sticker &nbsp;was ripped, replaced &nbsp;by several &nbsp;Obama stickers, car was scratched. When I called the cops, they came and told me that maybe I shouldn&#039;t put &nbsp;&#039;Republican&#039; stickers on my car? I didn&#039;t want to bring this up, but, I&#039;m sick and tired &nbsp;of &nbsp;being told to be civil and respectful when I am the one being attacked. This is just the latest example. People &nbsp;were arrested &nbsp;&#039;celebrating&#039; &nbsp;by vandalsing around NYC Tuesday night. &nbsp;I was in &nbsp;a &nbsp;store &nbsp;yesterday on line, some guy was playing Lotto, going on about the election and how &nbsp;the F#K&#039;n Republicans &nbsp;shouldn&#039;t even be allowed &nbsp;to live in this &nbsp;state. These &nbsp;are all equivalent of &nbsp;the &#039;Right_wing&#039; Yahoos &nbsp;I always &nbsp;hear &nbsp;about in the South. Well, you got &#039;Left-Wing&#039; Yahoos here, power drunk. Sen. Chck Schumer wants &nbsp;to treat &#039;talk radio&#039; like pornography and reinstitute &nbsp;the ironically labeled &#039;fairness doctrine.&#039; I love NYC like &nbsp;most of us, my political &nbsp;views &nbsp;may be at odds with most, but, it&#039;s still my right.

				FZ<br /><br />Like many of the liberals that you have such disdain for, your stories, without proof, are purely anecdotal and maybe formed, in part, by your own biases.&nbsp; I&#039;m guilty of this, as well, although I&#039;m trying not to write as fact.&nbsp; I could bore you with stories of McCain supporter ignorance that I experienced while I was in Minnesota, but they would be just that, stories without proof and possibly told from a liberal perspective.&nbsp; I worked for a senator on their campaign and I can tell you horror stories about how I was treated, but in the end, does that mean all people who don&#039;t like my candidate are like that?&nbsp; That&#039;s too simple.<br /><br />Yes, people were arrested in NYC for celebrating, but did you know that the Chicago Police Department reported only 5 arrests in a crowd of over 100,000 in Chicago.&nbsp; This is the same city that ranks near the top in murders and where they destroyed stores on the Magnificent Mile after one of the Bulls&#039; many championships.&nbsp; In the interest of fairness, which you accuse liberals and the leftist of lacking, why didn&#039;t you bring this up?&nbsp; I guess it wouldn&#039;t have supported your argument that the left are a bunch of crazy, hate-filled young punks. <br /><br />Now, America has decided on the next president and the Congress.&nbsp; Unless people decide to move to another country, we should work together.&nbsp; It&#039;s easy to forget that after 9/11, Republicans, Democrats, and Independents got together for a common cause to fight terrorism and support our country.&nbsp; However, when Bush and friends decided to declare war on Iraq, the good-will started to go away.&nbsp; If you read the literature and examine the evidence, carefully, you will find this to be the case.

				Question for the Republicans - do you believe the extreme religious right-wing of the party will eventually sink the party or will the Republicans find a way for them to eventually fortify the party?&nbsp; To me - and this is just my observation - the Republican party has become fractured, and the two major ideological groups that I have become recently aware of are the evangelical &quot;base&quot; and the conservative intellectuals.&nbsp; There are moderates, too, but they got little attention because IMO of Palin, at least from where I was sitting.&nbsp; To me, it looks like the Republican party has some work ahead of it if they want to develop coherence in both their core being and in their image.<br /><br />I will say, the news that has surfaced about Palin recently is troubling to me, and I am glad we dodged the bullet.&nbsp; Her not understanding that Africa is a continent not a country, and her lack of awareness as to who is part of NAFTA blows my mind.&nbsp; However, she is a deft politician, really a narrow specialist right now, with apparently very little &quot;classical&quot; background (aka civics).&nbsp;I do wonder if she will bone up on civics, world history, and political trends, and come back swinging in 2012.&nbsp; If so, I&#039;d like to see her leave her demagoguery behind, though I am not so sure she can divorce herself from that aspect of her personality. <br /><br />I am so happy that we have someone who is intellectually fit in the office of the President.&nbsp; Obama is a breath of fresh air in that respect.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to see Elizabeth Hasselback come out and throw her support behind Obama on The View yesterday.

I&#039;m much more concerned with their demonstrated intelligence, intellectual curiosity, and the ability to understand complex issues. The fact that Palin didn&#039;t even know Africa is a continent is ludicrous. And I would guess there are millions of Americans who also don&#039;t know what countries are in NAFTA, but there&#039;s no excuse for politicians running on a national level not to know that. Alaska was Palin&#039;s only concern for her entire life before this year. Honestly, I don&#039;t know how you can get to be in your 40s as a politician and only now just start to learn about the world beyond your own state. That&#039;s a lifetime of learning that she&#039;s somehow missed out on, and I don&#039;t think it&#039;s possible for her to catch up now. Hell, she was a journalism major for years; you&#039;d think she&#039;d be pretty well-informed.<br /><br />I really hope that, if she does run in 2012, she doesn&#039;t make it past the primaries and is seen as the fringe candidate she really is. But maybe she&#039;ll get in big trouble for misspending RNC money before then and won&#039;t even make it that far in her political career. I was ready to give her a pass for that whole $150,000 shopping spree, figuring she wasn&#039;t really responsible for that, but it sounds now like she was, and that she even spent more than that but had her staffers put it on their credits cards.&nbsp; :-o<br /><br />Billz, hopefully you know I&#039;m not arguing against you here. I just found the news about Palin amazing today. I thought she was bad before, but this is ridiculous.

Obama will encourage retiring Americans to serve by improving programs available for individuals over age 55, while at the same time promoting youth programs such as Youth Build and Head Start.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Note the first line &quot;when you choose&quot;. Now further on &quot;a plan to require 50 hours of community service in middle school&quot;. WTF!&nbsp; Who the hell does he think he is to require volunteerism? We can go back and forth on the merits of community service, but it is a slap in the face of liberty to require public service because you think it is a good idea. They are not your kids Mr President-Elect. Keep them out of politics.

				I think requiring volunteerism in some field, not mandating what type of volunteer activity, might teach people to give back and encourage community involvement, though I can understand why some folks might oppose it.

Since I grew up in that atmosphere I understand, most of the time, where they are coming from, even when I fiercely disagree.

I do believe, quite firmly, that everyone has the right to their ideas. I also believe that what we have in common is far more powerful than the differences between the Democrat and Republican parties. But most of them believe that Obama is a pinko commie Muslim who will force every american to have abortions and same-sex marriages and take all their money and give it to lazy homeless welfare moms and take away their guns and give them to terrorists.<br /><br />So I ask them how the weather is and what they are doing for Christmas, instead. <br /><br />Oh, right, the point - Bill, I appreciate the point of view you bring to the board.

				I think the last few posts get to the heart of what is appealing for many people about Obama.&nbsp; He has consistently elevated the discourse above the fear mongering we have all been subjected to for too long.&nbsp; That sort of demonization of the other has a long history of being a tool of those who would divide to conquer and for me, watching the outpouring of tears of joy and relief at his election all over the world, not just here in the US, has been a unifying image of our commonality and evidence of the sheer millions of people who were afraid of where the fear mongering was leading us.&nbsp; As far as deporting those with differing viewpoints, however absurd they may be, the great thing about this country is that we have rules for allowing people to believe, and most importantly say, whatever they want without risking that sort of retribution.&nbsp; And that freedom to entertain and express dissenting viewpoints has kept our democracy alive enough through some pretty dark days to elect Obama.

				I&#039;m not saying that fundamentalists are prone to conspiracy theories - there are people of all political stripes with the same predisposition. But I have sat through dozens of church services running exactly as I described above, where the minister says (for example) that America has turned its back on its Christian foundation, and God will not let this stand, and Armageddon is at the door because George Bush* (sr) is collaborating with the Russians to bring about a New World Order which is represented by the Beast in the book of Revelations, etc. Oh, yes .. that sermon was where I first heard about the Illuminati. When I was a kid, I got quite genuinely worried about this stuff. And yet, I kind of enjoyed the rush of hearing and entertaining those ideas........<br /><br />I do not think that everyone in these churches actively believes all of that. Looking back, I don&#039;t think most of the people in the congregation I sat in really believed it. But I never heard anyone say &quot;I don&#039;t think that&#039;s true.&quot; So as a kid, I believed it - for a while at least. Hence, the trickle down effect. <br /><br />One somewhat troubled person (let&#039;s assume a green in a country of greens and oranges), comes up with a new scary conspiracy theory - the oranges are zombies. They send out the mass emails or preach the sermons. If other greens who disagree simply ignore this and don&#039;t dispute it, the only people who do dispute it are oranges. And of course we all know they have a vested interest in disputing it and therefore can&#039;t be trusted, so that&#039;s ignored. And so the more credulous, less educated, more anxious greens hear only one message coming from their group. And even though it&#039;s a lie, and most of them deep down know it, the lie wins within the group as a whole. Because no green stood up and said &quot;This is simply not true, and here is why.&quot; <br /><br />*We had a republican president at the time, the evangelist had to work with it

				I agree, megc. I really hope Palin isn&#039;t that ignorant - it is pretty scary to know that someone with such huge gaps in common knowledge can make it so close to the presidency. Governorship is bad enough. While I am trying to reserve judgment since all these comments against her have been made anonymously (though I presume they&#039;re legitimate sources), her defense of herself has continued to make as little sense as her interviews made during the campaign. This is what she said about Africa during her recent interview with Greta Van Susteran:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;So we discussed what was going on in Africa. And never, ever did I talk about, well, gee, is it a country or is it a continent. I just don&#039;t know about this issue. So I don&#039;t know how they took our one discussion on Africa and turned that into what they turned it into,&quot; said Palin.<br /><br />&quot;I don&#039;t know, because I remember the discussion about Africa, my concern has been the atrocities there in Darfur and the relevance to me with that issue, as we spoke about Africa and some of the countries there that were kind of the people succumbing to the dictators and the corruption of some collapsed governments on the continent, the relevance was Alaska&#039;s investment in Darfur with some of our permanent fund dollars, I wanted to make sure that that didn&#039;t happen anymore.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />She really needs to just take a break from speaking in public for a while if she has any hope of continuing her political career outside of Alaska.

				It doesnt matter who wins.<br />You dont have a choice.<br />they presented to you 2 politicians to chose from.<br />the corporations who were backing the 2 pumped lots of money for their campains<br />where was Ron paul during these debates? (who actually won the polls for the republican debates)<br />the only true politician who speaks for the people &amp; the protection of the constituition. <br /><br />Obama will not help the situation ...just like Mcain couldnt help the situation. <br /><br />When will we realize that the presidents are puppets...just actors.<br />The Real problem is the fraudulent Federal reserve system that is bigger than the government.<br /><br />The Federal reserve controls the countries money supply and thus controls everything.<br /><br />We should abolish the Federal reserve !!!!<br /><br />Bernanke &amp; Paulson should be trialed for treason !!!!<br /><br />They have robbed us of our funds !!!!!<br /><br /><br />and they will get away with it....while we will go into the greatest depression the world has ever seen<br /><br />thanks to the Federal reserve.<br /><br />Obama Change?<br /><br /><br />lets understand that politicians have no power.<br /><br />Im not saying I have solutions...but i would love to hear some.<br /><br />For starters I would like to see the federal reserve abolished<br />and return some standard to back up our money supply.<br />maybe this would do away with inflation.<br /><br />Im not here to battle anyone<br />or mean no disrespect to anyone.<br />we are all in this together.<br />So that said im open to ideas.<br /><br />have a good day

				<br />http://features.csmonitor.com/politics/2008/11/24/capitol-hill-feels-obama%E2%80%99s-hand/<br /><br />I remind myself that the Obama administration officially starts late January. Looking to reserve a lot of judgement for as long as makes sense.<br />Will see now whether Congress has more productive debates, with more agreeable disagreements.<br /><br /><br />***<br />I hoped to find the fun cartoon where the Obama staffers get back to the White House to look for where they had carved their initials during the Clinton administration. <br />&nbsp;:-D

				Just a bit OT<br /><br />&#039;make new friends, but keep the old,<br />one is silver, and the other gold&#039;<br /><br /><br />It should not surprise me that banks and money have been a political topic through many decades.<br />Below is one presentation on related subjects. While the banks may inflate money, they could choose otherwise.<br /><br />http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2004/200403022/default.htm<br /><br />Money, Gold, and the Great Depression <br />remarks by Bernanke <br />2004<br />&nbsp;:?<br /><br /><br />I also wanted to include another view regarding supply, demand, and the role of money, but I do not find one that satisfies as yet.<br /><br />
