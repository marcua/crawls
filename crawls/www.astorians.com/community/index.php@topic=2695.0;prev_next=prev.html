It is such a different matter. The sane thought out plan for end of life contingencies is presumably a humane and personal plan. Suicide is not.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I used to think like you, Jonathan, until it came to getting my Health Care Directive judge-proofed. It is not good enough to have a Directive that only suits the state in which you live. And please remember that &quot;end of life&quot; and &quot;quality of life&quot; are *not* always the same thing. There are states that restrict both the method and the purpose. <br /><br />I had a friend who went to visit her sister in Lansing, MI. While there she had a stroke. She had a Health Care Directive and her sister had it faxed to her in order for her to give the document to the hospital so that they understood my friend&#39;s wishes under the circumstances. Long story short—what her wishes were, were interpreted in a Michigan court as a non-assisted suicide and in this pitiful non-vegetative state, this brilliant woman became a ward of the court, paralyzed in 3 limbs, with an abdominal feeding tube, begging to be allowed to die. She lingered in this state for almost 10 months, when she died.<br /><br />I don&#39;t think of it as suicide. You, obviously, also don&#39;t think of it as suicide. But some states do; some courts do; many people do.<br /><br />As far as the poor soul whose suicide started this thread, I also agree that he would have found another reason to end his life. He was obviously a tortured soul. And part of me believes that his loved ones were *not* surprised when they were informed of the method of his demise. I suspect they anticipated such a thing for many, many years. IMHO, I don&#39;t believe that you suddenly get up one day with ideations of ending your own life and take immediate actions. I believe that a tortured soul thinks on the subject for long periods of time before they take any actions to end their lives.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_41052">Interesting thread. Sorry for such a late bump.<br /><br />Literal political suicide has been done many times before. A famous one is of (thank you &quot;Rage Against The Machine&quot;), Lam Van Tuc&#39;s self-immolation against government policies towards Buddhism. It appears to me, that self-immolation was done on more than one occasion. <br /><br />There is a video that I watched of a self-immolating monk: very calm, in the lotus position, very still and quiet. Civilians and other monks not only gathered around him on the streets, but many of them lay in prostrate honoring the monk&#39;s decision. No one attempted to put the fire out. It was really quite a sight.<br /><br /><br /><br />[attachment deleted by admin]</div>

I definitely find it horrifying as well. What&#39;s interesting is that people who commit these political suicides hope to inspire the living to fight for the cause, whatever it is. They probably hope that their ultimate act will inspire/horrify people into action.<br /><br />What is also very interesting, is that a number of westerners have self-immolated ostensibly for political reasons: (Aside: WOW. The musician whom we are referring to committed suicide by self-immolation. See last example)<br />=======================================================<br /><br />&quot;Three Americans immolated themselves in 1965, in protest of the Vietnam War; the first was Alice Herz, an 82-year-old German immigrant who performed the act in downtown Detroit on March 16, 1965, prior to the University of Michigan Teach-in. The second was Norman Morrison, who performed the act after reading an article by a missionary about the destruction of a Vietnamese village by napalm. The third was Roger Allen LaPorte, in front of the United Nations building in New York City on November 9, 1965. At the time, he was a 22-year-old Catholic Worker Movement member. On May 10, 1970, 23-year-old George Winne Jr. immolated himself on the campus of the University of California, San Diego. He left a sign saying &quot;In the Name of God, stop the war&quot;.<br /><br />On 8 September 1968, Polish lawyer and former soldier of Armia Krajowa Ryszard Siwiec burned himself during an official Communist ceremony in the main stadium of Warsaw protesting against the Warsaw Pact intervention in Czechoslovakia in August 1968.<br /><br />Five months later, in January 1969, Jan Palach immolated himself in Prague to protest against the recent Soviet military backlash against the reforming &quot;Prague Spring&quot; movement. A month later, another student, Jan Zajíc underwent self-immolation for the same reason.<br /><br />On 19 September 1970, the Basque nationalist Joseba Elosegui set himself alight and threw himself at the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco, who was presiding over a game of the world pelota championship in the Anoeta court of San Sebastián. Elosegui was arrested and Franco was not harmed.<br /><br />On 19 September 1970, Kostas Georgakis self-immolated in Matteotti square in Genoa, Italy, to protest the Greek military regime.<br /><br />Romas Kalanta self-immolated as a protest against the Soviet Union occupying Lithuania on 14 May 1972. This triggered a student uprising in Kaunas.<br /><br />On 22 August 1976 East German priest Oskar Brüsewitz set himself on fire in front of a church in Zeitz, near Leipzig, protesting against the oppression of the Protestant church by the East German regime. Two years later, on 17 September 1978, the priest Rolf Günther followed his example in Falkenstein, Saxony, probably for the same reasons.<br /><br />On April 7, 1989, the pro-Taiwan independence publisher Cheng Nan-jung self-immolated rather than submitting himself to arrest for having published a draft of the Republic of Taiwan constitution. His action was soon followed by the self-immolation of another activist during Cheng&#39;s funeral procession.<br /><br />In 1990, Rajiv Goswami self-immolated[1] in protest against implementation of job and University education reservations for backward castes to the extent of 27% in addition to the existing quotas of 22.5% in India, as recommended by the Mandal Commission. This sparked a series of the same by other college students and led to a formidable movement against implementing the policy.<br /><br />In February of 1991, University of Massachusetts Amherst student Greg Levey set himself on fire on the Amherst, Massachusetts town common in protest of the Gulf War. [2]<br /><br />In the 1990s several South Korean students also chose to self-immolate in the waves of mass protests against the country&#39;s then authoritarian government.<br /><br />On October 23, 1996, West Philadelphian activist Kathy Change self-immolated to protest &quot;the present government and economic system and the cynicism and passivity of the people,&quot; as she said in her suicide note.<br /><br />During the trial of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, Prime Minister of Pakistan, one person in Sargodha self-immolated.<br /><br />On January 23, 2001 a group of people self-immolated in Tiananmen Square, Beijing, China. The group were allegedly practitioners of the Chinese spiritual movement Falun Gong; however, this is disputed by Falun Gong supporters, who claim it was a setup by the Chinese government as a part of the ongoing crackdown on the movement.<br /><br />In 2003 six people set themselves on fire in the Czech Republic, with four dying and two suffering severe burns. Most of the cases were in Prague. According to suicide notes the reason was depression due to the contemporary situation of the world [3]. Psychologists in the Czech Republic have warned that the frequent commemoration ceremonies for Jan Palach contributed to this phenomenon[citation needed].<br /><br />On November 15, 2004, Mohamed Alanssi, a disgruntled former federal informant on terrorism set himself on fire near the White House. Secret Service officers put out the fire and Alanssi survived. [4]<br /><br />On May 27, 2006, two students in India set themselves on fire protesting against the Reservation (affirmative action) policies of the Government. [citation needed]<br /><br />On October 31, 2006, retired minister Roland Weißelberg set himself on fire [5] at a construction site in Erfurt, Germany. He died the next day. A letter written by Weisselberg indicated that he was protesting the spread of Islam, and urged Germany&#39;s Protestant Church to take the issue more seriously.<br /><br />On November 3, 2006, Chicago activist, music enthusiast, and sound engineer Malachi Ritscher, immolated himself alongside Chicago&#39;s Kennedy Expressway, seemingly motivated by discontent with the United States&#39; occupation of Iraq. He published a &quot;personal statement&quot; and self-written obituary on his website, SavageSound.com. Next to his body was found a videotape and a small sign, on which the phrase, &quot;Thou Shalt Not Kill&quot; was printed.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_42132">Activist&#39;s fiery death prompts questions<br />By ASHLEY M. HEHER, Associated Press Writer Sun Nov 26, 7:28 PM ET<br />CHICAGO - Malachi Ritscher envisioned his death as one full of purpose.<br /><br />ADVERTISEMENT<br /><br /><br />He carefully planned the details, mailed a copy of his apartment key to a friend, created to-do lists for his family. On his Web site, the 52-year-old experimental musician who&#39;d fought with depression even penned his obituary.<br /><br />At 6:30 a.m. on Nov. 3 — four days before an election caused a seismic shift in Washington politics — Ritscher, a frequent anti-war protester, stood by an off-ramp in downtown Chicago near a statue of a giant flame, set up a video camera, doused himself with gasoline and lit himself on fire.<br /><br />Aglow for the crush of morning commuters, his flaming body was supposed to be a call to the nation, a symbol of his rage and discontent with the U.S. war in Iraq.<br /><br />&quot;Here is the statement I want to make: if I am required to pay for your barbaric war, I choose not to live in your world. I refuse to finance the mass murder of innocent civilians, who did nothing to threaten our country,&quot; he wrote in his suicide note. &quot;... If one death can atone for anything, in any small way, to say to the world: I apologize for what we have done to you, I am ashamed for the mayhem and turmoil caused by my country.&quot;<br /><br />There was only one problem: No one was listening.<br /><br />It took five days for the Cook County medical examiner to identify the charred-beyond-recognition corpse. Meanwhile, Ritscher&#39;s suicide went largely unnoticed. It wasn&#39;t until a reporter for an alternative weekly, the Chicago Reader, pieced the facts together that word began to spread.<br /><br />Soon, tributes — and questions — poured in to the paper&#39;s blogs.<br /><br />Was this a man consumed by mental illness? Or was Ritscher a martyr driven by rage over what he saw as an unjust war? Was he a convenient symbol for an anti-war movement or was there more to his message?<br /><br />&quot;This man killed himself in such a painful way, specifically to get our attention on these things,&quot; said Jennifer Diaz, a 28-year-old graduate student who never met him but has been researching his life. Now, she is organizing protests and vigils in his name. &quot;I&#39;m not going to sit by and I can&#39;t sit by and let this go unheard.&quot;<br /><br />Mental health experts say virtually no suicides occur without some kind of a diagnosable mental illness. But Ritscher&#39;s family disagrees about whether he had severe mental problems.<br /><br />In a statement, Ritscher&#39;s parents and siblings called him an intellectually gifted man who suffered from bouts of depression. They stopped short of saying he&#39;d ever received a clinical diagnosis of mental illness.<br /><br />&quot;He believed in his actions, however extreme they were,&quot; his younger brother, Paul Ritscher, wrote online. &quot;He believed they could help to open eyes, ears and hearts and to show everyone that a single man&#39;s actions, by taking such extreme personal responsibility, can perhaps affect change in the world.&quot;<br /><br />His son, who shares the same name as his father, said his father was trying to cope with mental illness. Suicide seemed to be the next step, and the war was a way to give his death meaning.<br /><br />&quot;He was different people at different instances and so, so erratic. I loved him no doubt, but he was a very lonely and tragic man,&quot; said Ritscher, 35, who is estranged from the rest of the family. &quot;The idea of being a martyr I&#39;m sure was attractive. He could literally go out in a blaze of glory.&quot;<br /><br />Born in Dickinson, N.D., with the name Mark David, Ritscher dropped out of high school, married at 17 and divorced 10 years later. Eventually, he would change his name to match his son&#39;s and, coincidentally, a world-famous prophet. At the end, he worked in building maintenance and was a fixture in Chicago&#39;s experimental music scene.<br /><br />He described himself as a renaissance man who&#39;d amassed a collection of more than 2,000 musical recordings from clubs in Chicago. He was a writer, philosopher and photographer. He was an alcoholic who collected fossils, glass eyes, light bulbs and snare drums. He paid $25 to become an ordained minister with the Missionaries of the New Truth and operated a handful of Web sites protesting the Iraq war.<br /><br />A member of Mensa who claimed to be able to recite the infinite number Pi to more than 1,000 decimal places, he titled his obituary &quot;Out of Time.&quot; Friends, who seemed surprised about his death, found themselves searching for answers. Ritscher&#39;s death became even more enigmatic than his life.<br /><br />Perhaps the most famous self-immolation occurred in 1963, when Buddhist monk Thich Quang Duc burned himself at a Saigon intersection in protest against the south Vietnamese regime. Another activist, Kathy Change, lit fire to herself in 1996 at the University of Pennsylvania to protest the government and the country&#39;s economic system.<br /><br />Ritscher&#39;s death brought back memories for Anita King, a 48-year-old artist from West Philadelphia who was Change&#39;s best friend.<br /><br />&quot;I think both of them, they just felt like their death could be the last drop of blood shed,&quot; King said. &quot;It was too hard for them. They had too much of a conscious connection to the struggle to go on in their lives.&quot;<br /><br />In the end, only Ritscher knew the motivations for his suicide. There is little doubt, though, that he was satisfied with his choice.<br /><br />&quot;Without fear I go now to God,&quot; Ritscher wrote in the last sentence of his suicide note. &quot;Your future is what you will choose today.&quot;</div>
