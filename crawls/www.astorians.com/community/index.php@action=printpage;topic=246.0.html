				Ok, so here is the deal. For the past several months now a black kitty has been roaming free around Ditmars and 27th street. Neighbors have dubbed her Milo, which is a boys name but she is a girl. They must not realize she is a she and not a he. Anyway, Hubby and I have been feeding her and she will now let us pet her and stuff. Neighbors said that she had kittens and people took the kittens and gave them a good home but no one gave her a good home. With the temperatures dropping into the low teens, and a wind-chill making the temp -10, we were able to coax her into a cage and bring her in so she doesn't freeze her poor skinny bones off. <br /><br />Problem is kitty doesn't like our cats, and we couldn't keep her anyway even if she did. I have tried many no kill shelters and two told me they are under reservations for several months and the others keep saying they are full. We are still trying but have not yet had any luck. <br /><br />If there is anyone out there who has any kindness in there hearts and would open there house up to this poor kitty and doesn't have any kitties yet please email me. ladykildara@gmail.com She needs patience and lots of love.

				I would have to talk my landlord into it. &nbsp;Is she litter-box trained and fairly docile?<br /><br />It would be nice to have a cat ....

				At first we wen't sure if she was litter trained, so we have her in our bathroom with a liter box, she does use it to my relief. Didn't want to go cleaning up messes. She seams fairly docile. She doesn't attack us or anything, and she will walk up to my husband and meow at him and let him pet her and she lets me pet her. I think once she finds a good home she will be teacheable to be like a normal cat. Right now she is scared because she isn't used to being indoors. She is also all black with large round yellowish eyes. She is pretty cute. I will try to post a pic up later tonight when I get home from freeze.

				We have now dubbed the kitty a more appropriate name of Millie, and no we haven't found her a home yet but are desperately trying to find one. Even though Millie is a stray, she is not feral (gone wild). She gets scared and nervous at times and tends to hide a lot, but she is still a lovable kitty. Some good food and her coat is getting more softer and shinier like it should be. Most of the time Millie is kept in our bathroom, which makes her cry a lot, but my other cats don't like her so I cant let her out much. Earlier today she fell asleep on my lap while I petted her. All Millie needs is a warm place to be and a little love and she should do fine, she is still young. Below are two pics of Millie. <br /><br />(http://www.mariesenchantedgarden.com/mbpics/millie1.jpg)<br />(http://www.mariesenchantedgarden.com/mbpics/millie2.jpg)
