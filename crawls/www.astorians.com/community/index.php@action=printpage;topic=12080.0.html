				Hi! I&#039;m a first time poster here and I am looking to move to Astoria by Oct. 1. I&#039;m a little crazed and overwhelmed by the process of searching for an apartment here. I&#039;ve only ever lived in places where good ole&#039; craigslist will do fine to nab a great space, and where enlisting the services of a broker is unheard of. But looking for a place here without a broker is like looking for the lost city of Atlantis it seems. Is it generally accepted that a broker (to whom, it seems, you pay your entire lifesavings and promise your firstborn) is necessary to find a good place? <br /><br />On the off-chance that this isn&#039;t so, I&#039;m looking for a 1-2 bedroom in the 1300-1500 range---my fiance and I are a young, professional, non-smoking and respectful couple, and we are desperate to secure a place to live before Oct 1. <br /><br />If anyone can be of any help in the first matter about the broker, please post! As to the second (my desperate plea for help), if anyone could supply a lead, I would be most grateful for a PM! Thanks!

				Jedayla--<br /><br />One other thing about the NY market is that it is often rare to find anything by owner more than a week or two before move in. Apartments turn over very very quickly and you can find one on CL by owner, but it requires checking the listing a few times a day and calling or emailing immediately. <br /><br />On my last apt search, I saw one listed by the owner, emailed immediately and when I went to see it, he told me that he had left the ad up for an hour and a half and already had 300 emails. He went through them in order and picked the first 12 that seemed like they were reasonably together. <br /><br />It is possible, but you have to really put a lot of effort into it. If you don&#039;t have the time to devote to a near full-time apartment search, paying a broker can actually be worth the hours of seeing and waiting that you would do on your own.

				Thanks! I appreciate the response very much. I have two more quick questions--I apologize for sounding so naive, but I&#039;ve never had to deal with this before!<br /><br />How far ahead of a potential move in date should one go to a broker? I called a few yesterday and they all wanted to take me to see places immediately...<br /><br />How often does it happen that a broker turns you on to a place and you put in for it, yet you get denied by the owner (for credit or other reasons)? Do you still have to pay the broker&#039;s fee? Do you have to pay it twice if the broker needs to show you a new place?

				Brokers can usually start showing things a month before move-in. Owners renting the apartments themselves sometimes don&#039;t put them up or list them with a broker and then decide to do it themselves because they didn&#039;t like the tenets the brokers brought them.<br /><br />Also, most brokers know you&#039;re probably going to use more than just them as a resource, so they want to jump on you and get you to go for something right away. <strong>*Don&#039;t give in!*</strong> There are lots of apartments out there and your price range is very reasonable for a one bedroom or smaller two bedroom. <br /><br />As far as getting turned down, that&#039;s part of the benefit of a broker. When looking for apartments on my own, without a broker, I have had landlords turn me down. This was mostly when I was unestablished in the city, had just moved here and did not yet have a solid job. The broker can help convince the landlord to take you.<br /><br />You won&#039;t have to pay the broker&#039;s fee twice. In fact, you shouldn&#039;t give the broker their fee until you&#039;ve signed a lease. You might have to pay for a credit check up front (that should not be more than $30-$35), and when you see an apartment you like, you will want to put down a deposit, but brokers (the good ones) don&#039;t take their fee until you&#039;ve got a lease signed.<br /><br />Also, make sure that you give them checks for any of these things. You want to make sure you write on them what they&#039;re for (ie this one is the broker&#039;s fee, this one our security deposit, etc) so that you know they&#039;re going the right place.<br /><br />There are lots of respectable brokers out there (there are several mentioned in the thread at the top of this board) but be wary of anyone who wants a key fee or to charge you too much for a credit check.<br /><br />Feel free to ask any other questions. I know that I needed a lot of help when I first got here.<br /><br />And good luck!

				hey - I posted this yesterday on the first thread on this board, thought it might be useful for you:<br /><br />I recently found my first apartment in Astoria. Here&#039;s what I learned from the experience:<br /><br />1. Have all the documents you will need to rent a place prepared before you start searching. Including: W2s from past 2 years, two or three pay stubs, a letter of employment, bank statements, divers license (or other form of photo ID), references (phone numbers of friends, old landlords, etc.), and guarantor&#039;s info if necessary. You may also want to run your own credit report for free from one of the credit reporting websites to avoid this fee.<br /><br />2. Take some time to familiarize yourself with the neighborhood on google maps, or by walking around. Go all the way up and down 31st street, from LIC to Ditmars. <br /><br />3. It is possible to rent from owners, and anyone who has some time to search should begin this way. The by owner section of craigslist should do the trick, or look for open house signs in the neighborhood.<br /><br />3. If you are short on time, or cannot find any by owner rentals, using a broker is a reasonable choice. The STANDARD RATE for brokers in Astoria is one month&#039;s rent (~8% of a year&#039;s rent). If anyone charges you more than that, you should neotiate them down before signing a contract with the broker.<br /><br />4. We met with several brokers. I would recommend using multiple brokers, as they don&#039;t all have access to the same listings. Ask about specific details from their postings to make sure they aren&#039;t bs-ing. Be sure you don&#039;t sign any statements saying you cannot use other brokers in the area when you initially meet with brokers.<br /><br />- Angelica, whose office is on 36th and broadway, is a hot mess who consistently forgets important details (eg. how much we were willing to pay for an apt.) She posts exact locations, but her apartments are usually far away from where she says they are. <br />- Buy Sell Realty had excellent customer service, and was clean and professional. I wish we could have rented an apartment through them, but unfortunately they didn&#039;t have what we were looking for.<br />- We ended up using R&amp;R Realty (Richard and Rashida). They were very good, but tried to charge 11% for a broker&#039;s fee. We negotiated it down.<br /><br />5. See as many apartments as you can, even if they don&#039;t sound like exactly what you&#039;re looking for. You&#039;ll have a better idea of what is overpriced and what isn&#039;t if you just look at many apartments.<br /><br />In general astoria is safe, beautiful and a really nice place to live. I&#039;m happy with our decision to live here, and I hope these tips ease the stressful process of finding an apartment.

				A quick note as well from personal experience (actually this happened to one of my best friends and not me).<br /><br />If you are renting a place that&#039;s a co-op or condo make sure upfront that the owners aren&#039;t considering selling it in the near future.&nbsp; What happened with him is he went through everything and dealt with the wife only to find out that the husband had a handshake agreement to sell the co-op to someone.&nbsp; Rather than fighting them since he had already signed the lease he just got his money back.&nbsp; However, when it came to the broker he refused to return the fee since &quot;technically&quot; he had done his job by &quot;finding&quot; the apartment (which was ironically two floors below where my buddy was living at the time.<br /><br />On a side note, it&#039;s always good to make sure the apartment is legally zoned as well.&nbsp; My first apartment in Astoria wasn&#039;t (many years ago) and I had to move after four months because the Landlord got fined.<br /><br />Anyhow, in short, it&#039;s best to make sure that all of your angles are covered.
