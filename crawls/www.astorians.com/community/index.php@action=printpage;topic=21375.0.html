				I&#039;ve been to the new Side Door at Bistro33 and have really enjoyed the Sushi that me and my wife have gotten there.&nbsp; But they have been so empty each time we&#039;ve been that I feel compelled to write a little review.&nbsp; For self serving reasons (I want to eat there) I hope to keep them open a little while.<br /><br />First off the wholle Bistro33 operation has undergone some changes.&nbsp; The Bistro no longer serves Sushi, and instead is the Sushi only Side door, right next door.&nbsp; I think this is a good move, as while I liked the many options at the Bistro, their menu always seemed dysfunctional.&nbsp; The side door is a small space that feels a little larger than it is due to the open layout and large windows.&nbsp; They do not take credit cards yet (a PIA) and do not have a liquor license.&nbsp; They also do not allow BYO because their liquor license is pending.&nbsp; Oh well...not a great start.<br /><br />The menu is strickly Sushi, sashimi, rolls, and raw fish based appetizers.&nbsp; Of course there is a miso soup, and some fried soft shell crab, seared tuna apps, but there is no, Udon, Teriyaki or other generic Japanese dishes for those who do not like Sushi.&nbsp; The apps are between $5 and $12, with the $5 apps a great deal.&nbsp; We&#039;ve had the salmon ceviche twice and it is really a great deal for how much fish is in the dish.&nbsp; It reminds me far more of Hawaiian Poke than ceviche, but this is not a bad thing for me as I miss sitting by the roadside in Hawaii eating raw fish dearly.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have not had the sashimi or sushi yet so I can not attest to its quality.&nbsp; But the rolls are really fantastic.&nbsp; I would say superior to Watawa down the street, both in quality and inventiveness.&nbsp; The basic yellowtail/scallion, tekamaki, or spicy tuna run $5-$6, while the special rolls range from $9-$18.&nbsp; While all the rolls we had were good, the red indian roll, with curry sauce on top was a stand out for flavor and uniqueness.&nbsp; The rolls were really good, kinda reminded me of Sushi in Norther Cali where anything goes.&nbsp; Mango in the roll...sure, curry sauce...sure, what else can we think of...sure.&nbsp; Makes for a fun meal.<br /><br />So that&#039;s what I&#039;ve gathered from my first two visits.&nbsp; I really have to try the sushi and sashimi as these are my fav&#039;s, and also the most difficult to find done well.&nbsp; I hope this post gets the Side Door some business, so they may survive until the liquor license comes through.&nbsp; But that is a tough spot for a restaurant I would imagine.&nbsp; But worth a try.<br /><br />

				We were excited to try it and walked over on a hot Sunday at midday to find it closed.&nbsp; No signage.&nbsp; And the people inside Bistro 33 were as clueless as I always find them.&nbsp; And after weeks, their websites are still underconstruction.&nbsp; I predict this place will be plagued with the same sloppy business sense and bad service that Bistro 33 suffers with.&nbsp; And it&#039;s a shame because the food is very good.&nbsp; They&#039;re also one of those places that insist on having all their windows thrown wide open like it&#039;s a breezy seaside cafe.&nbsp; Meanwhile it&#039;s 98 degrees with 90 percent humidity on 21st Street with buses and cars a few feet away.&nbsp; Get a grip and turn on the AC and give us a break.

				We actually have always loved Bistro33, and have been somewhat saddened by the separation of the Sushi items from the more Frenchified menu. Though we are fans of the cuisine. We also enjoyed Side Door when it was an ice cream parlor run by the Bistro33 folks.<br /><br />We have dined at Side Door only once since it opened. And for the whole time, we were the only people in the restaurant. The no liquor license and the cash only policy are deterring people from coming in (though on the night we were there, I was able to persuade the waiter to run our bill on the Bistro33 credit card machine, so we didn&#039;t have to run out for cash after we had already been seated!).<br /><br />I want this place to succeed, but fear it may have trouble catching on.<br />

				Cash only? In 2011? Unless they are trying to cheat the IRS, why would they do this?

				I highly doubt they&#039;re trying to cheat the IRS because their sister restaurant, Bistro33 does take credit cards. I believe it&#039;s a simple mechanical issue of not having gotten a credit card machine set up within Side Door. <br /><br />And if you lived in Astoria for any length of time,&nbsp; you would realize that quite a significant number of establishments - restaurants, cleaners, retail stores - are cash only. Just the way our nabe works...it&#039;s slowly changing for the better, but it does make things a tad bit inconvenient at times.&nbsp; :grin:

Which could make a difference to a small business trying to manage expenses. That, and there may be a lag time between the transaction and when they actually get the money, which they may not want to deal with.
