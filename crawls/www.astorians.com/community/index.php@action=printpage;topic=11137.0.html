				i&#039;ve mentionde this in several other threads but we use jan from the cat&#039;s pajamas (http://www.thecatspajamashotel.com/) (formerly janimals) whenever we travel. she&#039;s great. she does an in-home interview and meets your cat before your first trip. we always get a lengthy note about what we missed and if there were any problems. i highly recommend her service.

				This is great info.&nbsp; I&#039;m planning on adopting a cat in 2 weeks and Im lining up some local resources for cat sitting as I go away for work often enough.<br /><br />Does anyone have a Vet in the area that they recommend?<br />I live off of Ditmars @ 31st so I would like someone in Northern Astoria but I&#039;m completely open to recommendations.&nbsp; I would rather be happy with a Vet that I have to travel to then be stuck with someone that I (or my cat) doesn&#039;t like.<br /><br />Thanks a lot!

				we go to dr. kamer at astoria veterinary group (718-777-0100). they are located at steinway and astoria boulevard. he spent a lot of time with my cat and was caring and gentle in demeanor. they also recommended a car service that was feline friendly. i would recommend them without hesitation.

				you should contact the new place that opened on Ditmars, Whiskers Holistic Care.&nbsp; They probably know plus there&#039;s a bulletin board up and I&#039;m almost sure someone put something up about taking care of cats.

				I second Dr. Kamer at Astoria Vet Group. He was so sweet and gentle with my Harper and she was calm as can be around him. My husband was shocked that she didnt fuss once...not even when he took her temp... :-o

				I just want to throw my services out there as a cat lover and care-taker!&nbsp; I have three of my own at home and have experience doing everything from bathing to pill taking!&nbsp; My cats also get along very well with other cats, so after a trial, would consider even housing your cat for a couple of days while you are away!<br />Best,<br />S

				On the topic of cats:<br /><br />My wife and I are flying in with my two cats (carrying them on the plane) when we relocate. Any suggestions as to the best way for getting my cats to the hotel I&#039;ll be staying at for a couple of night while the apartment gets cleaned? Will a cabbie have a problem with cats, or do I have to get a car reserved?<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />

				Cabs typically won&#039;t mind cats if they&#039;re in their carriers.&nbsp; And the good thing is that you&#039;ll be in a taxi line for a cab at the airport, so if the first cabbie refuses your fare because of the cats, there will be a bunch of taxis behind him/her that I&#039;m sure will be okay with the cats.

				Does the hotel know about the cats?<br /><br />If they are crated, no cabbie should have a problem.

				The hotel is the only place under 300/night&nbsp; :-o that would take pets. It works out because it is queens. The cats aren&#039;t &quot;crated&quot; but they are in carriers. Thanks for the feedback, this will probably save me some cash for going to a new vet!<br /><br />cheers.

				Re:&nbsp; Joansark - I had her take care of my kitties once, and she did an excellent job.&nbsp; The one caveat I would like to point out is that her policy is to charge you an extra visit fee to stop by and return your keys.&nbsp; I don&#039;t travel often enough to make it practical to leave an extra set of keys with the kittysitter, and even if I did, I&#039;m not quite comfortable leaving my keys just Out There In the World.&nbsp; Fortunately she had another appointment in my neighborhood shortly after my return, so we were able to work it out without my being charged.
