			I pass by this place every night on my way home and I see lots of people in there.&nbsp; They got 5 stars on yelp.&nbsp; The burgers look very big.&nbsp; I don&#039;t even think I could finish one of them.&nbsp; The menu looks very good.&nbsp; The only thing I don&#039;t like are the stools they have to sit on.&nbsp; They don&#039;t have any backs on them and look uncomfortable.&nbsp; They should get some regular chairs<br /><br />
