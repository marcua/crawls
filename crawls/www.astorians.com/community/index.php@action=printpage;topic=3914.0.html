				Long before there were area codes, all we had were telephone exchanges. An exchange was the first 3 digits of your telephone number. You could tell where someone lived by their exchange.<br /><br />For example:<br />721 = <strong>RA</strong>venswood 1-XXXX<br />932 = <strong>YE</strong>llowstone 2-XXXX<br />278 = <strong>AS</strong>toria 8-XXXX<br /><br />Then all 5 boroughs were in the 212 area code. <br /><br />Then we had to dial 1 before getting into another area code.<br /><br />Now we have to dial 11 digits to call the guy who lives down the hall. <br /><br />Ah! Technology!<br /><br />

				What I find really galling is that only the &quot;outer&quot; boroughs are on 10-digit dialing. Manhattan, of course, is the exception. :roll:

				You can still get a pretty good idea where somebody lives in the city, assuming they have POTS service (vs. cellular or VOIP):<br /><br />http://www.telcodata.us/telcodata/telco<br /><br />Put in the area code &amp; exchange (yes, it&#39;s still called an exchange.)&nbsp; You can get the details on the switch type that serves the number, where it&#39;s located, what other exchanges it serves, what other switches are in the building, etc.&nbsp; Verizon isn&#39;t stupid when it comes to copper, people are served by switches in their area.<br /><br />embrace technology, become the machine&nbsp; 8-)

I remember the day the 10/11+ dialling went into effect -- because I dialled a number from my office that I had dialled a day or two before - and was told that it was not reachable.&nbsp; And now, to verify it is the same, before I posted, I picked up the phone (my office phone, a 212 number - but a different office from what I mentioned above) and dialled the home number of a friend of mine (that is also 212 that she has had since 1993).&nbsp; I was told that the number was not in service.&nbsp; I then dialled it with a preface of 1+212 and got through.
