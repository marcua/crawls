				Let&#039;s draft some new candidates and give New Yorkers a fresh choice of who to elect in the next Mayoral election!<br /><br />I nominate Dominic Carter, presently host of Inside City Hall, on NY1.<br /><br />I would really like to see Dominic Carter inside city hall! &nbsp;Usually political discussions put me to sleep, but I&#039;ve enjoyed watching his interviews on NY1, and reporting his show, Inside City Hall, is like having studied for the job. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />http://www.ny1.com/content/about_ny1/staff_profiles/348/dominic-carter/Default.aspx (http://www.ny1.com/content/about_ny1/staff_profiles/348/dominic-carter/Default.aspx)

				<br />Dominic would definitely be an interesting choice.<br /><br /><br />2 more unlikelys that would make me smile:<br />Colin Powell or<br /><br />Martin Scorsese<br /><br />I would not want to take them from their life passions, but they do know NY and they know how to direct a team.

				Not many suggestions, no?<br /><br />Would we see something like they have in other parts, a grander debate.<br /><br />http://www.stltoday.com/blogzone/political-fix/political-fix/2009/03/slay-to-face-challengers-in-mayoral-debate/<br /><br />A mayor facing independents. Though in NYC, the mayor is the once and future independent?

				<br />Marty? Seems to work for some in Brooklyn.<br /><br />Obviously, others and WT are suggesting William &#039;Billy&#039; Thompson.&nbsp; :?<br /><br />http://www.friendsofbillthompson.org/site/pages/about-bill/<br /><br /><br /><br />If he campaigns for every NYer regardless of race, income, borough, baseball team, ... then great.<br />Hoping.

				Guiliani, He was&nbsp; the best Mayor in my lifetime. Liberals I knew&nbsp; who left NYC when it took a dive and had&nbsp; more murders&nbsp; in a year than a war came back after he cleaned it up. As for Dominic Carter and really anyone from NY1, I wouldn&#039;t vote&nbsp; for&nbsp; ASPCA&nbsp; head let alone&nbsp; Mayor.

				Tony Avela of Queens, but he does not have the backing. He is middle of road, sharp, straighforward, and did great job out in Bayside Flushing area as assmblymen.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;I like Christine Quinn&nbsp; :-o<br />Really, aside from gay marriage issue, I like her&nbsp; her politics in general, think she is sharp, and she has guts to stand up to people.&nbsp; &nbsp; We&#039;ve had a bunch of bad mayors, including Guilianni, who is a phoney, and Bloomburg, who gets away with being a lousy mayor since he is madia bigshot, making him first mayor to not have to deal with heavy media pressure.&nbsp; He&#039; s tight with all newspaper, television, and radio owners, since he&#039; s one of them,&nbsp; so he never gets tough questions, or if he gets an occasional one there is no heavy follow up.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Herman Badillo would have been&nbsp; good for last eight years, but he seems retired now.
