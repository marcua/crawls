So says Reader’s Digest.<br /><br />The magazine sent reporters “undercover” to 36 cities, in 35 countries, to measure courtesy. New York was the only American city on the list.<br /><br />In a city with a reputation for being in-your-face, New Yorkers seem to be expressing themselves with a new one-finger salute: a raised pinkie. In fact, they seem to have even better manners than people in London, Toronto and Moscow.<br /><br />In its admittedly unscientific survey, the magazine’s politeness-police gave three types of tests to more than 2,000 unwitting participants.<br /><br />The reporters walked into buildings to see if the people in front of them would hold the door open; bought small items in stores and recorded whether the salespeople said “thank you”; and dropped a folder full of papers in busy locations to see if anyone would help pick them up.<br /><br />New Yorkers turned out to be the politest: 90 percent held the door open, 19 out of 20 store clerks said “thank you,” and 63 percent of men and 47 percent of women helped with the flying papers.<br /><br />In short, four out of five New Yorkers passed the courtesy test.<br /><br /><strong>New York’s mayor unsurprised</strong><br />Mayor Michael Bloomberg said he’s not surprised.<br /><br />He told reporters Tuesday that whenever he travels abroad, he hears nothing but praise for the Big Apple’s good manners.<br /><br />“We are so jaded,” he said. “We want to think the worst of ourselves, and people from around this country and around the world think exactly the reverse.”<br /><br />The rudest continent is Asia, Readers Digest said. Eight out of nine cities tested there — including last place Mumbai, India — finished in the bottom 11. In Europe, Moscow and Bucharest ranked as the least polite.<br /><br />Reader’s Digest, which has readers in 21 languages, is publishing the results in its July issue.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				When I first came here and was on my second job assignment I got lost trying to find 42nd and 7th.&nbsp; *blush*<br /><br />Anyway, a woman noticed my confused expression, walked up to me and asked where I was trying to go, and helped me get there. It was incredibly nice. I mean, 99% of people will give directions if asked, but she just saw me wandering around and came up to help. <br /><br />Of course, the other night I tried to help a guy who was asking if he was on the right train and because I needed to look at a map to figure out if it went to coney island he was rather rude. <br /><br />Oh well, it&#39;s all a balance...<br /><br />I still think people in Oklahoma are *far* more polite, but NYC was the only US city studied.

				Having grown up in the Midwest and lived in other cities, I have to say that I find it easiest to strike up a random conversation with New Yorkers. &nbsp;I am surprised that Mumbai ranked so low - I traveled in India for three months last year, and I found Indians to be *extremely* warm, friendly and open to strangers. &nbsp;People might not hold doors open or say thank you - conventional manners according to American standards - but they certainly show their helpfulness and courtesy in other ways.

				Good point, anzubird. This study is really biased toward American standards of polite, which is kind of sad, considering that New York was the only US city to make the list. <br /><br />ETA: Wait, they mean New York was the only US city studied? This is making more and more sense.

				I&#39;ve found New Yorkers to be very helpful when asked, but they usually give you some distance until they get to know you. &nbsp;They&#39;re also usually very direct (which threw me for a loop when I first moved up here).<br />I&#39;d agree that grocery store staff are pretty universally unfriendly, especially the C Town staff over on Broadway at 29th Street. &nbsp;I think they must have to take a personality test to prove they&#39;re unhelpful and unkind before being offered employment.

				was the quote in the paper &quot;we may not be bright, but at least we are polite&quot;.<br /><br />I remember being amazed how nice NYers were when I first visited on vacation.<br />Can really be appreciated by tourists.

				flying pre-bacon mammals in the sky - too funny!<br />I find Duane Reade varies a lot by store, though they&#39;re usually not very friendly or helpful.&nbsp; Does anyone use the Eckerd on Broadway at 36th Street in Astoria?&nbsp; They&#39;ve become a rather surly lot lately and they never have more than one register open, even if there is a line of ten people.<br />

				Joel, go for the big splurge and get one of those $100-$200 aerobeds. It is the best investment in bed furniture. Cant tell you how great it is and how superior to any other blow up mattress.&nbsp; Bed bath and beyond or Costco has them for a good price.<br /><br />Walking shoes, try the army navy store on steinway between 30th and 31st ave. Good start and decent prices.<br /><br />Good luck on the job hunt and if you&#39;re flying into Laguardia its about a 10 minute cab ride (tops)&nbsp; to your place.<br /><br />have a good trip and welcome to Astoria.

				About the air mattress, I have the under $20 version at Target and I use it for guests.&nbsp; I&#39;ve slept on it and it&#39;s fine and no one&#39;s ever complained.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you plan on getting a real bed very soon anyway, you should save your couple hundred and splurge it on that.&nbsp; Moving is expensive and you could use the dough I&#39;m sure.&nbsp; &nbsp;Guess it depends on if this bed is just temporary and when you&#39;ll be replacing it.
