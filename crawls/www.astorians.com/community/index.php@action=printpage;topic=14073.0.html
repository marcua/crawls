				Hi,<br /><br />The fruit shares are all organic and vary from month to month.&nbsp; For the first couple of weeks the fruits tend to be blueberries and other berries and perhaps occasional fresh juices in place of berries.&nbsp; Towards the later months fruits range from apricots, peaches, nectarines and toward the last months apples, pears and plums.&nbsp; We will not be getting strawberries because they&#039;re incredibly difficult to grow organically.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sorry we took a little bit to get back to you! We are busy gearing up for Sunday...hope to see you there!!<br /><br />-Harvest Astoria Core<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;m really interested in joining! How&#039;s the add-ons work? Do I have to place the order when I sign up for the vege share or I can add it each week/month? Do you guys have a price list of the add-on products? Thanks for organizing CSA! Fresh vege rocks!!!

				has there been any additional info on this new CSA group?&nbsp; I used the website to contact inquiring about any additional sign up dates in April, since, between hospital stays and being out of town, March hasn&#039;t been the best for me, but I haven&#039;t heard back.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping that this might be more fruitful, since I&#039;m really interested in joining, but haven&#039;t been able to get the info that I need, unfortunately.

				Hey,<br /><br />We do have a few more spaces left.&nbsp; You probably haven&#039;t heard back from us yet because we&#039;re still trying to figure out when we&#039;ll have a final sign up.&nbsp; But we will get back to you!&nbsp; If you want, you can send me a message with your email address and I can keep you posted!!<br /><br />-Harvest Astoria Core
