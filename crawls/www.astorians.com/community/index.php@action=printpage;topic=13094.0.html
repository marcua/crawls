				Some of the best sushi in Astoria. Friends from Japan say the Udon soups are very very good.

				It&#039;s amazing. The dinner bento box is ridiculous. So much food--maybe even too much. It&#039;s out of my way--2 subway stops and kind of a walk-- but it&#039;s so worth it. I&#039;ve only gotten it to go though, so I can&#039;t comment on the service.

				We got this ordered-in last night. This is my third JJ&#039;s experience, and it was pretty damn good.&nbsp; Although, my boyfriend was disappointed with his California roll.&nbsp; He said it was too mushy.&nbsp; <br /><br />My King Crab dumplings and crispy duck salad were excellent. And I LOVE that the crispy duck pieces weren&#039;t too fatty.

				I love JJ&#039;s. It&#039;s especially great for &quot;unadulterated&quot; sushi (where the fish isn&#039;t covered in a pile of spicy sauce, tempura flakes, green clovers and lucky horseshoes). I&#039;ve ordered nigiri and sashimi style sushi from them a number of times and have been very happy. <br /><br />Their wonton soup is great too... the broth is more like chicken stock than the yellow tinted water you get at many places. It also tastes like they finish it off with a little bit of butter. It&#039;s a really comforting soup for chilly weather like this! :)

				So I just went to JJs tonight for the first time.&nbsp; The pot stickers are everything they are hyped up to be and more.&nbsp; Dessert (banana spring rolls w/ vanilla ice cream) was also quite good.&nbsp; The rolls, however, did not seem to so clearly be &quot;the best in Astoria.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, they were very tasty and I will definitely be going back.&nbsp; I just dont think JJs was the end-all-be-all of sushi in this neighborhood.&nbsp; In fact, I like Kitaku (on 23rd Ave, b/w 29th and 31st) a little more... and they are cheaper.
