				Hi all and greetings from Astoria, Queens!<br /><br />Our landlord has given us notice he&#039;ll be increasing rent by 12% come the end of July. Is that legal?<br /><br />A few facts:<br /><br />- the building is only about 2-3 years old (so I assume it cannot be rent-stabilized?)<br />- current rent $2,050, new proposed rent: $2,300 (12% increase).<br />- our current rent of $2,050 was a preferential rent. The legal rent (according to our contract) which they could have charged, but didn&#039;t was always actually $2,500. (Even this has increased recently too and is now apparently $2,800)<br /><br />Do we have to grin and bear it ... :-P<br /><br />or is this proposed increase illegal in any way?&nbsp; :roll:

				IANAL, and I&#039;m a bit confused. Don&#039;t &quot;legal rent&quot; and &quot;preferential rent&quot; only apply to rent stabilized buildings? If your rent is not controlled or stabilized, I thought the property owner could charge whatever they felt they could get. <br />

				here is an explanation of rent stabilization.&nbsp; http://www.housingnyc.com/html/resources/faq/rentstab.html <br /><br />If your building doesn&#039;t qualify (and it sounds like it doesn&#039;t) then the landlord can charge whatever rate the market (meaning you) will bear.&nbsp; <br />But, that doesn&#039;t mean that you can&#039;t try to negotiate a bit. If you are a good tenant and the building has some vacancies, your landlord might be willling to deal.

				If the building is new and hasn&#039;t recieved any tax breaks then it&#039;s most likely not stabilized or covered by any rent regulations. The landlord can charge anything and raise the rent as much as s/he/it likes. As rebb says there&#039;s nothing stopping you from trying to negotiate a smaller increase and you do have the option of moving. Probably not what you wanted to hear but I really do think you should just reject the increase and see what happens. If you don&#039;t discuss it with the landlord you are guaranteed the rent will go up 12%.<br /><br />Good luck and let us know what happens. It may help other people who are in your situation.

				The terms &quot;legal rent&quot; and &quot;preferential rent&quot; usually only apply to rent stabilized leases.&nbsp; Look at your current lease or the renewal that your LL sent, they both should say right on the top of the first page if it&#039;s rent stabilized (RS).<br /><br />If your building is only 2-3 years old and you have a RS lease, I&#039;m betting your building was built with the aid of a property tax abatement called 421a. In the 421a program, the developer gets reduced property taxes for a defined period after completion. In return they have to put the building into RS for the life of the tax abatement.<br /><br />So there are 3 possibilities, and the third is the most likely:<br />1) You&#039;re not in an RS building and somehow the terms &#039;legal&#039; and &#039;preferential&#039; are being used inappropriately (it happens, frequently people in property management offices become so mechanized in their processes that they make this kind of mistake, but as above looking at your lease should answer this question).<br />2) If you are RS, the 421a tax abatement could be expiring, at which point the LL can exit RS and charge whatever they want as long as the predicate notices have been appropriately given (I doubt this because 421a in most circumstances runs for 10-25 years depending how it was filed, and the fact that your LL is still using the &#039;legal&#039; and &#039;preferential&#039; terms, but hey, see #1).<br />3) If you are RS, you were given a preferential rent on your last lease(s). Under this circumstance the LL is allowed to bump your rent up to the legal rent starting with the next renewal. But there are conditions to this – you have to be notified in the lease or in a lease rider that this situation exists, what the legal and preferential rents are, and there has to be a statement to the effect that the LL has the right to increase the rent to the legal rent at the end of the current term.&nbsp; If you had multiple renewals from the time you moved in, then you have to be informed of the above with each and every lease – one break in the chain can negate the LL’s ability to charge the legal rent.<br /><br />So you really need to pull out all of your leases and examine them closely to make sure you were given the correct information at that time.&nbsp; If they didn’t do everything correctly, you can file a complaint with the NYS agency that oversees RS, DHCR http://nysdhcr.gov/Rent (http://nysdhcr.gov/Rent). But if they dotted and crossed their I’s and T’s, this is probably legal.&nbsp; For more information go here:&nbsp; http://nysdhcr.gov/Rent/FactSheets/orafac40.pdf (http://nysdhcr.gov/Rent/FactSheets/orafac40.pdf).<br /><br />Hope this helps…<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Alot of new buildings are Rent stabilized , so there is a&nbsp; chance this one is .&nbsp; Not to be confused with rent controlled .&nbsp; &nbsp;You basically have to find out if it does have RS .&nbsp; &nbsp;Ask the landlord ,&nbsp; he should tell you the truth . Then you should check it out with the city .&nbsp; &nbsp;If it is RS&nbsp; , he can still raise the rent but only a certain % per yr as stated in his RS contract .&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />How can I find out if my apartment is stabilized?<br /><br />Call the NY State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR), the state agency which administers the rent laws (718-739-6400 or 212-961-8930) and ask if the apartment is (or should be) rent stabilized<br />

I did indeed contact NY State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) and they referred me to the Department of Finance to check if there is the landlord received a tax abatement when he built. In order to do this, the highly &#039;helpful&#039; lady at the Department of Finance (who kept interrupting me mid-sentence, calling me &#039;Sir&#039; in a sneering way and putting me on hold when I tried to get her to actually do her job) needed a BBL number (borough-block-lot). There are websites to generate this whereby you plug in your address and it&#039;ll generate this number for you. <br /><br />Calling them back later today to try to get the info I need. Will progress report with Dragon-Lady here...

I think you are on to something re: the rent stabilization via the tax breaks route. I reviewed the contract again and there is indeed a &#039;Rent Stabilization Lease Rider&#039; attached. It states <em>&quot;This Rider, with this Notice, must be attached to all vacancy and renewal leases for rent stabilized apartments.&quot;</em> It surprised me, since the building is very new, so it must be something to do with these tax abatement programs.<br /><br />Per my response elsewhere on this thread to Thanos, I am now checking with Dept. of Finance and Department of Housing, Preservation and Development whether this building did indeed receive such an abatement. <br /><br />If yes, which would mean it is indeed rent stabilized, then I&#039;m still confused by your comment above under point # 3: &quot;Under this circumstance the LL is allowed to bump your rent up to the legal rent starting with the next renewal.&quot; <br /><br />My understanding was that if it is indeed rent stabilized, then the maximum increase allowed is quite limited. According to the info I&#039;m receiving from New York City Rent Guidelines Board (RGB), for renewal leases of rent-stabilized apartments in Queens, the following currently (between Oct 1 2010 to Sept 30 2011) applies:<br /><br />- 1 year lease renewals = maximum 2.5% increase&nbsp; <br />- 2 year lease renewals = maximum 4.5% increase&nbsp; <br /><br />Hmmm.....<br /><br />Thoughts?<br />

				Hey Griff.&nbsp; So it does seem that you have a RS lease.&nbsp; If the Dept of Finance or HPD are unhelpful post or PM me your address and I can look up pretty quickly what they’d tell you.&nbsp; But all that’s going to do is confirm why your building is RS, and won’t have an effect on your immediate circumstance.<br /><br />In re: rent increases, I understand your confusion about the RGB guidelines; the RS system can be really byzantine, and 421a abatements can make it even more complicated.&nbsp; The RGB’s mandate is to set renewal rates that are intended to be applied to legal rents, not preferential rents.&nbsp; And where 421a is involved there are certain increases that are allowed beyond that.&nbsp; But conceptually, think of the legal rent as being a rent cap.&nbsp; The LL is allowed to charge anything they want up to and including that cap.&nbsp; If they can’t get the maximum they’re allowed to charge less for the term of a lease and then increase it to that cap (plus any RGB/421a allowed increase) after that lease is over, BUT the tenant must be notified of the situation in writing in the preceding lease or lease rider.&nbsp; If you didn’t get such a notice when you signed your lease, then they can’t increase your rent to the cap.&nbsp; But if you did get such a notice, then they can.&nbsp; <br /><br />So you need to look very carefully at all of your lease documents – you’re looking for something that effectively says that you acknowledge the legal rent is $XXXX, but for the term of the lease you’re being charged $YYYY, and you further acknowledge that the LL can increase the rent to the legal rent plus any lawful increases for any renewal.&nbsp; For 421a there should also be notification of the increases under that program.&nbsp; If there’s no such statement or rider, then they can’t increase your rent beyond the RGB percentages, and you may want to file a complaint with DHCR.<br /><br />Presuming that all of your lease documents are in order, what appears to be happening here is that your LL is allowed to increase your legal rent to a point that is well in excess of what the market will bear, and is increasing your rent to what they believe market rates are.&nbsp; But at the same time they don’t necessarily want you to leave because they’ll lose income while it’s not rented and have to paint/prep the apartment for the next tenant.&nbsp; So if all your lease docs are indeed in order, what I’d do is try to negotiate the renewal rent down some.&nbsp; They may not budge but at least you’ll have taken a shot.<br /><br />There’s a bit more generic info about lease renewals here:<br />http://nysdhcr.gov/Rent/FactSheets/orafac4.pdf (http://nysdhcr.gov/Rent/FactSheets/orafac4.pdf)<br /><br />And info about 421a rent increases here:<br />http://nysdhcr.gov/Rent/PolicyStatements/orap922.pdf (http://nysdhcr.gov/Rent/PolicyStatements/orap922.pdf)<br /><br />If ultimately you think you didn’t get the appropriate notice about the legal/preferential rents and you want to file a complaint with DHCR, the appropriate form is here:<br />http://nysdhcr.gov/Forms/Rent/ra90.pdf (http://nysdhcr.gov/Forms/Rent/ra90.pdf)<br /><br />But If you don’t have a rider or statement in your lease re: the above, before filing a complaint, I’d advise asking your LL for a copy of any notice that they gave you at that time.&nbsp; If they can’t produce it, tell them that they can’t increase your rent beyond the RGB increases.&nbsp; If they persist, then file the complaint.<br />

He didn&#039;t say under what program exactly when I asked, but he was open about the fact they receive tax breaks, because of agreeing to rent stabilize it.<br /><br />RE: <em>&quot;The RGB’s mandate is to set renewal rates that are intended to be applied to legal rents, not preferential rents.&quot;</em><br /><br />And that&#039;s the problem. We were indeed aware of the preferential rate ($2,000 and later $2050) and it was indeed included in the contract and stated clearly. So, based on that, the LL is still well below the legal rent ($2,800) stated on the contract. Jacking it up another $250 &#039;only&#039; brings it up to $2,300. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br />RE: <em>&quot;at the same time they don’t necessarily want you to leave because they’ll lose income while it’s not rented and have to paint/prep the apartment for the next tenant.&quot;</em><br /><br />This guy seems quite confident he can have a replacement in there, lickety split.

And, I understand his point of view. <br /><br />So, my friends, it seems I may have to leave www.astorians.com soon and join www.bronxians.com or something (if that even exists?) <br /><br />One thing&#039;s for sure: it may be a nice apartment and everything, but for $2,300: we are <strong>OUTTA HERE!</strong><br /><br />Now, next steps: any apartment owners out there with a 2 or 3 bedroom reading this who might be interested in having a good couple with cute baby as their next tenants?

				Griff -- I&#039;m sorry to hear that you have no recourse and thanks for letting us know.<br />&nbsp;<br />Does anyone know how &#039;legal&#039; rents are determined for new buildings? I curious to know how the $2800 figure was calculated since it seems to be above current market rates.<br />&nbsp;<br />BTW, Griff is your current place a 2- or 3-bedroom apartment?

				Two things:<br /><br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li>Search the lease and confirm that when the preferential rent is listed it DOES NOT state that it&#039;s for 1 year only.&nbsp; If the preferential rent does not specifically limit itself to a period of time it is deemed to be in effect for the entire term of the lease (including all renewals).&nbsp; That makes the preferential rent the amount that all increases are based on.</li><li>The limits for increases for leases commencing on or after October 1, 2011 are 3% to 5.75% for 1 year leases and 6% to 9% for 2 year leases.&nbsp; Given the timing of your post you&#039;re probably still in last year&#039;s window, in which case the increases are limited to 2.25% for 1 year leases and 4.5% for 2 year leases.</li></ul><br /><br /><br />

				Griff,<br />&nbsp;<br />Is this issue still ongoing, or did you reach a resolution with the LL?&nbsp; If this renewal issue is still ongoing, I have a couple of observations/suggestions, based on your information:<br />&nbsp;<br />1) 421-a is a program administered by HPD.&nbsp; The owner gets a tax abatement on his/her new construction by participating in this program.&nbsp; In return, the owner agrees to be subject to the RSL for a period of 10, 15, 20, 25 years.&nbsp; HPD also establishes a maximum rent the LL can charge&nbsp; (for the building as a whole, and per room), and still receive the tax benefits from the City.&nbsp; The Dept. of Finance is the agency which provides the actual tax break. <br />&nbsp;<br />2) You can verify the 421-a status of the building in a number of ways - check the lease provisions carefully, there should be some language that the building is under the 421-a program.&nbsp; You can also contact HPD to confirm that the building is/was a 421-a construction (they may even provide you with documentation, such as the Certificate of Eligibility).&nbsp; Finally, you can go to DHCR to get a rent history for your apartment, which should indicate the program(s) which it is operating under, as well as whether it&#039;s rent stabilized.<br />&nbsp;<br />3) I assume you are the first tenant in your apartment, since you mentioned new construction built 2-3 years ago.&nbsp; If so, you may want to determine whether being a first tenant may have granted you special rights or privileges under the RSL or RSC.&nbsp; The question is obviously going to boil down to what the initial legal regulated rent for your apartment is.&nbsp; The LL is claiming 2,800, and asserting your rent is preferential.&nbsp; Do not simply assume your LL is in the right because he says so.&nbsp; Note that the LL is required to register rents with DHCR (which is mandatory initially, and annually thereafter), but this registration does not establish this rent as the &quot;legal rent.&quot;&nbsp; DHCR HAS THE FINAL WORD ON THIS.<br />&nbsp;<br />4) As I understand the RSL, it&#039;s supposed to afford great(er) protection for tenants, and supposed to create stability in tenancies through the city/community.&nbsp; Assuming your apartment is RS, the owner&#039;s effort to raise the rent on you by 12% seems inconsistent with RSL.&nbsp; As you mentioned, the RGB establishes percentage increases, which are set for 1 and 2 year leases (421-a also allows for 2.2% increases per year, which must be calculated off the base rent).&nbsp; Allowing the 421-a owner to increase the rent by 12%, or 36% max increase in your situation, seems to either be a big loophole in the law or the LL is making a mockery of the RSL.&nbsp; If you think about it, the prospective 2nd tenant in your apartment will be subject to the same issues you&#039;re currently facing, assuming the tenant pays 2,300.&nbsp; What stops the LL from asking for 2,500 when the 2nd tenant&#039;s lease is up.&nbsp; This is an 8.6% increase, and once again makes the RSL look like a joke.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />5) You may want to consult an attorney if you want to explore all your rights as a RS tenant in a 421-a building.&nbsp; I think the focus should be on the 2,800 figure that the LL claims is the legal rent....<br />&nbsp;<br />Hope this is helpful.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Unfortunately, it&#039;s completely legal.&nbsp; When I moved back to Astoria in 2000 I found a three bedroom apartment and got it for $1,450.00 close to 30th Road and 14th Street (used to be 100% Italian back in the day with a festival on 14th street...days long gone), anyways, even though it wasn&#039;t the greatest part of Astoria it was still OK plus you couldn&#039;t beat that price.&nbsp; The landlords were OK, anyways they sold the building, the new landlord comes to me complaining that I was paying too low, etc., etc., and that if I wanted to keep the apartment I would have to pay an additional hundred dollars (this was in 2003), in 2004 he upped it another 100.00, to make the long story short, by the end of 2005 I was paying $1,700.00, that&#039;s when I moved.&nbsp; Because it&#039;s a three family home he had any right and has any right to charge whatever he wants as long as the people will pay it, I believe at present that same apartment is being rented out at $2,300.00 and the down side is that the area has deteriorated in the past 5&nbsp; years A LOT.&nbsp; Oh...and that&#039;s where I had the bed bug problem too because of a relative of his that brought them in his suitcase from Bangladesh and he did NOTHING about it except buy some spray at the .99 cent store and say &quot;this works&quot;.&nbsp; I feel for you because it stinks when you like an apartment and have to move out because if ID10T landlords that instead of wanting to keep good tenants just care about how much money they can make.&nbsp;
