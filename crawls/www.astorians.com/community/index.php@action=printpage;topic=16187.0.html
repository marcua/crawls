				I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve seen this link posted here yet.&nbsp; NYMag did a small feature on 31st Ave.&nbsp; JJ&#039;s (awesome sushi) and Brick were missing from the list, though.<br /><br />http://nymag.com/shopping/features/59219/ (http://nymag.com/shopping/features/59219/)<br /><br />I love my street! :)

				Oh, I&#039;m kind of glad JJs was left off the list. I hate it when everybody else finds out how awesome something is and then it&#039;s overrun and you can&#039;t get a seat anymore. <br /><br />MMMMMMMM sushiiiiiiiiiii

				Great feature! Now that I&#039;ve moved up to Ditmars, I miss the short walk to 31st that I used to have (especially to il Bambino). Besides all the nice places to eat, I love the &quot;coziness&quot; of the street. It just has a nice vibe, if that makes sense.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=16187.msg181488.html#msg181488">Quote from: cubemonkey on September 22, 2009, 03:55:56 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve seen this link posted here yet.&nbsp; NYMag did a small feature on 31st Ave.&nbsp; JJ&#039;s (awesome sushi) and Brick were missing from the list, though.<br /><br />http://nymag.com/shopping/features/59219/ (http://nymag.com/shopping/features/59219/)<br /><br />I love my street! :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I too am glad JJ&#039;s was left off the list.. I do plenty of word of mouth advertising to all my friends about that place.&nbsp; Bambino is also great.. haven&#039;t ordered from there in second.

				31st Ave. is awesome and I&#039;m very glad to have that cute and quiet avenue to escape to when the hectic-ness of Broadway (where I live closest to) gets a bit much. <br /><br />So, I keep on hearing about this burek but I&#039;ve never once been to Djerdan.&nbsp; I should change that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, I&#039;ve very much looking forward to the cool weather return of Bambino&#039;s soups.&nbsp;

				Don&#039;t forget about Diwine. (not a fan of that name)<br />One of the best and least known restaurants in Astoria.<br /><br />and why is sweet afton on that list?<br />it&#039;s a cool bar, but it&#039;s right off 30th avenue, not 31st.<br /><br />if they included afton, they should also include Seva!<br /><br />whatevs.

				I live on 31st Avenue, but a few blocks away from the places mentioned.&nbsp; I love my street because it isn&#039;t as hectic as the other commercial avenues.

				I love 31th ave. It is one of the longest aves. It is also a two way ave which allows zoning for taller building. It starts around 100 st /Astoria Blvd and extends to Vernon Blvd. It was previously named Jamaica Ave. I purchased Condo on Vernon Blvd/31th ave 3 yrs ago. Before I lived on 82nd St/31th ave in Jackson Hgts
