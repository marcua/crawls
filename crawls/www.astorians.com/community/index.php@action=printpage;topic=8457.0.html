				So, y&#039;all, who wants ARod? Think he and Torre will head west? I can&#039;t imagine the BoSox or the Mets wanting ARod. If the Sox took him, they&#039;d have to dump Veritek or put him on some kind of anxiety surpressant to keep them from beating each other.<br /><br />Also, I really would like to see the Sox keep Lowell.<br /><br />Will the Yanks dump Giambi? <br /><br />Who is gonna buy the Cubs and how much money will they put into it? I&#039;m interested to know what you all think!

				I think ARod ends up in Los Angeles, either with the Torre run Dodgers and McCourt needing to steal some thunder away from the Angels or with the Angels who have been linked ot him for years and have the resources.<br /><br />The Cubs will be bought by Thomas Mandler most likely.&nbsp; Lots of groups have the money (liek Cuban), but Mandler is a Chicago man and liked by the other owners.<br /><br />The Yanks might actually go through a rebuilding process which I think makes sense with a young manager and the emergence of Hughes and Chamberlain in the post season and the parting of Torre and ARod.&nbsp; So yes, that mean Giambi goes as well.<br /><br />Where does Tori Hunter end up? Adruw Jones?

				I thought I would see Torre go to LA, but now with ARod&#039;s announcement I&#039;m wondering if the Angels would take both of those Yanks or if they could afford to.<br /><br />Also, yo, ARod--I hope you realize that part of your problem getting a great deal with a good team is that you&#039;re a pompus ass who has no concept of a team, an issue only further illuminated by the timing of your anouncement. I hope you don&#039;t get more than you got when you were with the Yanks.

				I would like to see the Giants take ARod. At least his douchetasticness is less than Bond&#039;s...<br /><br />And Bonds is really about the only person ARod could hide behind.<br /><br />And they&#039;ve got some good starters already and could go to take division with ARod.<br /><br />And ARod would probably be better off in a less high-pressure team. Where he can be a team of one. Which is what he&#039;ll do wherever he goes anyway.

				He strikes me as a very &quot;I&#039;m a one man team&quot; kind of guy and I almost think that if he were on a smaller team where he could really man up and be the big guy and maybe he&#039;d mature into a leader. Dunno.
