				Hello Mets Fans.<br /><br />Would anyone be interested in a group outing to see the Amazin&#039; play this year?&nbsp; Since I am relatively new to the group and not the best organizer, I defer to the senior members or someone who can manage a little better than me, as to the planning and logistics of such an outing!&nbsp; I have included the link to the Mets schedule, if you want to figure something out!&nbsp; <br /><br />http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/schedule/index.jsp?c_id=nym&amp;m=3&amp;y=2007<br /><br />

				Any particular game you would like to see?&nbsp; I would sort of like to see them play the Phillies because those two teams might be really clawing at each other this season!&nbsp; I just wish the Mets would have got a bona fide starter for their rotation.&nbsp; Pedro isn&#039;t coming back until July, maybe, and Chan Ho Park isn&#039;t the answer, in my opinion!<br /><br />Going to Shea is kind of fun.&nbsp; It might be a crappy stadium, but I kind of enjoy riding out on a lazy summer afternoon and sitting in the cheap seats with my not so cheap plastic bottle of Bud and the questionable meat hot dogs.&nbsp; It was especially nice last year since they were actually winning and the games were interesting!&nbsp;

				Hi, We had a small Astorians gathering at Shea for a Mets game last summer. Basically, I collected names and money and we met up at the stadium. The only problem I had is that some people casually mentioned via they board that they were interested but never sent me a PM to tell me for sure. I only bought tickets for those that were definite and a few people were left out (unintentionally, of course). I would love to go to another Mets game with fellow Astorians this summer, although I am not sure if I can coordinate this one. <br /><br />If you are luck <strong>nycatexas</strong> will print you out the words to &quot;Take Me Out to the Ballgame&quot; for the 7th Inning Stretch.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D

				Erpotown - you did a great job - everyone had a good time. It would be great if you can coordinate another one - or train your replacement to do a job as good as you did. It didn;t hurt with the BBQ afterwards either. <br /><br />Anyway count me in for the next one. Don&#039;t forget the Spanish lessons from Prof. Reyes &quot;BOMBERO&quot;&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				Uggh, two losses this weekend and against one of my most hated teams, the Atlanta Braves&nbsp; :-( .&nbsp; You couldn&#039;t even blame the pitching, either!&nbsp; <br /><br />So, I know it&#039;s early in the season, but I would like to come up with some more opinions about a possible outing to Shea.&nbsp; As I noted previously, past experience has taught me not to try to plan large group outings so I will defer to anyone out there who wants to organize!&nbsp; I have included a link to the Mets schedule for review and suggestions.&nbsp; Personally, I would like to see the Mets play the Phillies, but I will defer to the majority!<br /><br />http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/schedule/index.jsp?c_id=nym<br /><br />Oh, according to the reports, Pedro is making good progress on his rehab&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				Kungfoofool, have a great time at your first game. I just love the atmosphere at a stadium, rather than watching it on TV. I have tickets for Sunday&#039;s game. Let&#039;s just hope it warms up for next weekend.

				The Mets should announce some rain-out alternatives either at the stadium, website, or by calling the box office, I would think.&nbsp; Oh wait, here we are, taken directly from their site<br /><br />What is the rainout policy? <br />In the event a legal game is not played due to weather, the rain check portion of your ticket can be exchanged for the same priced seat for any Mets home game, or refunded during the current or next calendar year. This does not apply if indicated otherwise on the face of the ticket. All rain check exchanges are subject to availability. Please contact the Ticket Office at Shea Stadium in person or by mail to: New York Mets, Ticket Office, Shea Stadium, 123-01 Roosevelt Ave., Flushing, NY 11368-1699. Complimentary tickets have no face value and cannot be exchanged. <br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;m about to disagree with Jtrane on the Virginia shootings thread, but here I have to agree. :lol:&nbsp; I&#039;ve always disliked Clemens for going after Piazza, who by all accounts is a gent on the diamond.&nbsp; He&#039;s a headhunter.&nbsp; <br /><br />I dunno, maybe I should lose player loyalties like that.&nbsp; I still haven&#039;t forgiven Rose for that fight he had with Harrelson.&nbsp;

				Went to the game today - GORGEOUS weather, great for baseball!&nbsp; The crowd was fun, and there were elements of the game (apart from the play itself) that reminded me of the Cyclones game I went to (understandable, since they are both Mets essentially).&nbsp; Mid-game was HOT with great Mets action...unfortunately they couldn&#039;t carry through to the end (crap relief pitchers, mostly).<br /><br />Regardless, I was happy to be there!&nbsp; Had a great time and look forward to my next Mets outing!

				Mets win 9 to 4 :mrgreen:<br /><br />Bit shakey for Glavine (though I love the fact that he&#039;s a good hitting pitcher and can be counted on a hit once in a while), but the bullpen did well.<br /><br />I like Easley, again pulling us up with late inning power, but when are we going to see Valentin again?<br /><br />Atlanta picked up a W, so we are still tied at the top.

				Ugh, a nine run inning for the bad guys.&nbsp; &nbsp;:|<br /><br />If another pitcher is in the cards, it would have to be for one of the mets 12 pitchers.&nbsp; With only five back-ups, we cannot afford to give up an everyday player.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t go tinkering too much at this stage of the game.&nbsp; We are 8 and 4 in our last 12 games.&nbsp; Pitching hads been shakey, but from a morale perspective, I&#039;d leave things be for a bit longer.&nbsp;

				Frappe, <br /><br />You&#039;re correct.&nbsp; Panic can cause questionable decisions that may potentially influence the team for years to come, i.e., giving up young, good talent for some old pitcher!&nbsp; I think Omar Minaya learned from the mistakes of those he follows.&nbsp; There must be pitcher in Asia that we could get, though.&nbsp; Somebody better than Chan Ho, at least!

				<strong>Reyes Mets&#039; newest cueball (http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070512&amp;content_id=1960403&amp;vkey=news_nym&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=nym&amp;partnered=rss_nym)</strong><br /><br />Less than 12 hours after Paul Lo Duca suggested that Jose Reyes&#039; hitting streak had fallen victim to his remaining locks, the Mets shortstop was un-locked too. <strong>Reyes became the 24th player to be shorn</strong>, leaving only Aaron Sele with a full head of hair, and Sele promised he, too, would be shaven soon.<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m on my own timeline,&quot; Sele said.<br /><br />Reyes said his trip to the in-house barber had nothing to do with his hitless game on Friday night. Lo Duca had suggested his teammate had lacked the karma necessary to extend his streak to 15 games, but added, &quot;He&#039;ll come around. <strong>I mean, what would you rather have -- hair or hits?</strong>&quot;<br /><br />Whatever the motivation, Reyes opted for less hair and had his scalp exposed by a cut shorter than he had anticipated.<br /><br /><strong>&quot;I wanted a 1 1/2 [setting],&quot; Reyes said. &quot;I got zero.&quot;</strong><br /><br />Reyes said he had planned all along to become &quot;one of the guys,&quot; but that he had &quot;something to do&quot; on Friday. His hair hasn&#039;t been so short, he said, in four or five years.<br /><br />&quot;It feels comfortable,&quot; Reyes said. &quot;I might keep it.&quot;<br /><br />Told of Reyes&#039; decision, Willie Randolph was pleased.<br /><br />&quot;<strong>I&#039;m sure he&#039;s cute</strong>,&quot; the manager said. Told he and Reyes now look more alike, Randolph said, &quot;<strong>I&#039;m better looking than he is.</strong>&quot;<br /><br />Scott Schoeneweis, one of the first to be shorn in San Francisco on Tuesday night, now has more hair on his face than on his scalp. He was wearing a woolen ski cap in the clubhouse on Saturday and looking a tad ominous. The cap was necessary, he said, because of an air-conditioning vent directly over his locker.<br /><br />Randolph noted that the Mets pitchers have done a better job holding runners and helping Lo Duca produce a remarkably high percentage of runners thrown out while attempting to steal. After throwing out Rickie Weeks in the first inning on Friday, Lo Duca had nailed 10 of 17 would-be base stealers, a .625 percentage. A .350 percentage is considered good.

				Mets - 6 Chicago - 5<br /><br />The Mets were down four runs in the bottom of the ninth and then the pitching fell apart for the Cubs.&nbsp; Delgado, who has been struggling of late, hit the GW two run single.&nbsp; Hopefully, this will help him break out of his slump, especially against the Yankees.<br /><br />It was funny watching Lou go to the mound and angrily confront his pitcher at the beginning of the Cubs&#039; meltdown!&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait for a classic Lou moment to happen this season.<br /><br />Forget two out of three this weekend, I want a sweep of the Yankees.&nbsp; Lets go Mets!

				Mets take series two to three:<br /><br />Well, two out of three is nice, but I wanted a sweep!&nbsp; Yesterday, I was all giddy as the potential future ace, John Maine took the mound against a guy the Yankees just called up.&nbsp; However, similar to the backup quarterback in the NFL, this kid from Kentucky with the awesome baseball name of Tyler Clipper (not as good as Homer Bush, though) really showed his stuff.&nbsp; I don&#039;t particularly care for the Yanks, but that doesn&#039;t mean I can&#039;t respect a good performance.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, the Mets are two games ahead with Atlanta and Florida back to back!&nbsp; Again, two out of three is good, but I want to see sweeps, especially against the Braves!

				As depressing as this weekend was for the Mets and despite the fact that they have lost 6 out of their last seven, they are still two and a half games ahead of the Braves.&nbsp; It was extra frustrating to watch the Tigers take two out of three because they play in the same division as the Twins, the AL Central.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Its funny (or not so funny) that I accept a 7-15 loss so much more then a 7-8 loss or an extra inning loss.&nbsp; When we were hot, we were the ones winning those slim games.&nbsp; Now we are the ones dropping them.<br /><br />We are going through our savings account now and we still are in the black, so its okay, but if we keep this up we&#039;ll run dry.&nbsp;

				While the Cardinals are not the same team that they were last year and it was a home game, it was still great to see the Mets pull one out with a walk-off home run!&nbsp; Sosa pitched a good game and C. Gomez hit a home run.&nbsp; <br /><br />Did anyone catch Willie&#039;s reaction to his home run trot, though?&nbsp; I really have a lot of respect for Willie, unlike Carlos Guillen, or Pinella, he doesn&#039;t have to scream and rant to get his point across to his players.&nbsp; I think they respect him and the way he manages the team and treats the players.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, word is that Alou won&#039;t be coming back until late Juily, and that Omar is considering another hitter.&nbsp; What about a pitcher?&nbsp; Buerle or Contreras (sp?) from the White Sox.&nbsp; OK, now I&#039;m just repeating what NY sports writers are saying, but isn&#039;t it true?!

				Wow!

				(RIP Scooter)<br /><br />(Blase to Bonds, there are fans on all sides)<br /><br />Isnt baseball exciting?<br /><br />As for Bonds, the homeruns and records are greeted with suspicion. But until proof is shown, no suspension. But when using drugs, they should be suspended.<br /><br />But I think you could have made steroids mandatory for everyone and still very few could have accomplished what Bonds did. Maybe it allowed him to be able to take the field more.<br /><br />I thought he was a hall of famer even before the era of steroids. Still amazed how many stolen bases he took. <br /><br />And look at the guys actually suspended for drug use (pitchers - infielders). Very few can compare to Bonds.<br />Records will be broken. It is history in its time.

				Mets sweep!&nbsp; Best record in the NL!&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />Granted, its against the natty&#039;s, but washington is not as abysmal at home normally, so its still good.&nbsp; That leaves us with a five game lead over Philly.&nbsp; Bullpen is looking good.<br /><br />Crazy though how the evil Yankees have nearly the same record as us.&nbsp; Got to hand it to the Bombers, they&#039;ve been tearing ass and I&#039;d bet they are making it into the post-season.<br /><br />Went to Fire Island for vacation.&nbsp; Did not call, check e-mail, watch tv, use internet for nine days.&nbsp; It might only be twenty miles away, but mentally, I was somewhere between mercury and venus&nbsp; :-)

				&quot;HUGE BUMP&quot;<br /><br />In case you didn&#039;t know, the Mets got Santana.&nbsp; Santana is coming to NY and not thankfully, not as a Yankee!&nbsp; I feel conflicted in a way because he is coming from my all-time favorite team, the Twins.&nbsp; However, he was also wasting his brilliant career on a team which is basically The Farm Team for the Better Teams!&nbsp; I think if the old Montreal Expos and the Twins had formed one team, they would have won a WS or two!&nbsp; <br /><br />http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3220894<br /><br />And speaking of my beloved Twins, they got this sociopath over the off-season and lost Torii Hunter, as well&nbsp; :x<br /><br />&nbsp;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delmon_Young<br /><br />
