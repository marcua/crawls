				Depending on my work load, I would be available for most Thursdays and any Friday.<br /><br />As far as suggestions for places on B&#039;way: Do you guys think Time Out Cafe on 45th and Broadway would be receptive to a larger group of &quot;outsiders?&quot;&nbsp; Do they have a garden?&nbsp; <br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t it be hilarious and ironic if we had it at NuBar?&nbsp; Sorry, mcdirk.

				if it&#039;s next week, I won&#039;t be able to make it, as I&#039;ll be in Canadia for a wedding, but based on brunch on Sunday, I&#039;m pretty sure that Time Cafe would be willing to work out some sort of deal for the Astorians gang.

				Time Cafe is probably your best bet.&#160; I use to frequent Crescent Lounge all the time, though <br />completely stopped going as some staff are rude. And frankly, if you&#039;re going to treat me like<br />that, I&#039;ll just hang out in Manhattan and spend my money there.

				Daisy, thanks for making a decision for all of us on the &quot;other side of town&quot;. I do hope you make it that night, I haven&#039;t seen you since the Mets game last summer?!? I am looking forward to this, I have never made it to an Astorian mixer and it is so close to my apt. Seems like all of you are in the area, so it will be great to finally meet my neighbors.<br /><br />For those of you coming from Manhattan, you can get off at the 46th Street stop on the R/V and Time Cafe is only a block away. Or you can take the Q104 from the N/W subway stop.

				I was wondering if someone who has the time and is a little more organized than me (which is pretty much everyone), would be able to start a list for the mixer at Time Cafe on Thursday evening, September 27.<br /><br />Can anyone stop by this weekend to give them the heads up?&nbsp; Do they have outdoor space?&nbsp;

				<b>The next Astorians Mixer is on Thursday, September 27, 2007</b><br /><br />OK, I just got off the phone with Drago, Manager at Time Caf&#233;.&#160; Explained Astorians.com was having a get together next Thursday, beginning at 7pm. Drago mentioned he does not have a Happy Hour, though can prepare appetizers for our group and seat us in a separate area. I&#039;ll reconfirm with him next Thursday morning :)<br /><br /><b>Date</b>:&#160; Thursday, September 27, 2007<br /><br /><b>Time</b>: 7:00 p.m. <br /><br /><b>Place</b>: <br /><b>Time Cafe (http://www.timecafeny.com/index.php)</b> (click to view website)<br />44-18 Broadway @ 45th Street <br />Astoria, NY 11103<br />718-606-0500<br /><br /><b>Directions</b>:<br />For those of you coming from Manhattan, you can get off at the 46th Street stop on the R/V and Time Cafe is only a block away.

				In Key West you can get a ticket for biking and drinking, but I am not too sure about in Astoria. Heck, they don&#039;t ticket the guy that rides his motorcycle on the sidewalk of 41st Street why would they ticket an inebriated bicycle rider?&nbsp; :-o<br /><br />See you all tonight.

				That was so much fun.&nbsp; It was great seeing everyone again, and meeting new people.&nbsp; A special shout out to the owners of Time Café, Drago and Walter.&nbsp; They really went out of their way to make our group feel comfortable, esp. with all the appetizers. Hullo!&nbsp; Was that not a feast! <br /><br />Aquaecny and I arrived early, and sat at the bar, where he ordered an Alabama Slammer.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the bartender didn&#039;t know how to make one. Jokingly I suggested she Google the recipe. And she did just that, using a patron&#039;s laptop, then making the drink.&nbsp; Now that was classy! <br /><br />Of all the bars I&#039;ve sampled since moving to Astoria last October, and I&#039;ve sampled a lot&nbsp; :lol:, Time Café made me feel the most comfortable.&nbsp; I will definitely be returning.&nbsp; Perhaps even this weekend.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />

				Had a blast last night. Love that I have more faces to associate with postings.<br />I have to make it out to more of these. <br />Definitely plan on going back to Time Cafe to sample more of their food (omg, they hooked us up!), maybe even just grab a drink. It is like 2 blocks from my house after all (and way better than when it was Nua, ha!). It&#039;s nice to know i have a spot where I can grab a ($5) glass of wine close to home. <br />Thanks fellow Astorians for making it a super fun evening!
