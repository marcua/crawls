			<br />I am a totally normal ;-) single gal who&#039;s lived in Astoria for a year now.&nbsp; And while I have plenty of friends, I don&#039;t have any friends in Astoria.&nbsp; My ONE good female friend here moved back to the West coast so I&#039;m very sad.&nbsp; And I do have two other friends here in Astoria but would you believe I&#039;ve only seen one of them once in the past year, and the other not at all.&nbsp; Their lifestyles are such that they just aren&#039;t available to meet up (one is a public schoolteacher who then spends her weekends Upstate, the other is a new mom).<br /><br />I&#039;m 50 but have friends in their 30s, 40s all the way up to their 70s.&nbsp; What matters most to me is the person&#039;s spirit.&nbsp; I tend to like people who are a bit quirky, who like to have meaningful conversation, who like nature or foreign travel/film/language, modern art, trying out new restaurants (no fast/junk food please!), or just hanging out at one or the other&#039;s home for dinner or whatever.<br /><br />I&#039;m somewhat quirky myself and most people would probably describe me as adventurous, a very loyal friend, and never boring.&nbsp; I&#039;m always trying something new....nothing like deep-sea diving or bungee jumping or anything like that, but like I am a member of Mealku, I do couchsurfing, Airbnb, travel abroad a lot (often alone), speak a few languages, throw a few parties each year, and am always hearing about cool things to do in the city.&nbsp; I love exploring different nabes in all the boroughs....making a day of it buying ethnic food ingredients, eating at a local restaurant, and then coming back home.<br /><br />Anyway, I know some women think it&#039;s a &#039;weird&#039; way to meet another female friend online..but ...I don&#039;t know how else I&#039;m going to meet a female in Astoria who&#039;s willing and available to meet up once in a while.<br /><br />Btw, I don&#039;t care if you are married or single, childless or child-with, so long as you have the inclination and availability to hang out once or twice a month in the nabe.<br /><br />We could start by meeting for coffee or just exchanging FB profiles!&nbsp; ;-)<br /><br />Let me know!<br /><br />Tx!<br /><br />

			I don&#039;t think meeting new friends online is weird at all.&nbsp; In fact, my closest friends (my longest continuous friend relationships - over a decade) all started online.&nbsp; I have a handful of friends in Astoria, but not as many as I would like, and like you, some of my closest friends have moved away or other life events have severely cut down their social time.&nbsp; Anyway, a good girlfriend&nbsp; (a board member) and I are always looking for others to join our brunch outings or after work drinks/dinner.&nbsp; You should join us some time.&nbsp; :-)

			Hi. My name is Fern and I just discovered this site and went straight to this topic. I am single with an adult daughter who has moved out. I have a dog but he doesn;t enjoy movie, theater, dining out!! the friends I do have are more like acquaintances and we do a monthy dinner. However, other times their lifestyles just don;t allow or they do not want to try new things or whatever. So if you are still interested in meeting female friends&nbsp; am up for it. A little about myself. I am 59(ouch!) and have been living in astoria for over 25 years orginally brought up on LI. I enjoy simple things; movies, dining out, happy hour, galleries, cooking on occasion, shopping and would love to travel more but with the economy the way it is things are tight altough I am trying to save for a nice vacation for my 60th bday. I am pretty straight forward, hate/love all all ethnic groups and religions. I judge a person on themselves not on where they are from. I too have friends of all ages but I do prefer someone close to me so they can relate. I hate cell phones and all this new technology. Anyway, if you would like we could meet for a coffees, drink or whatever. let me know&nbsp; :grin: I also HATE,HATE cold weather!!
