				I am a film-maker working on a film about talking to strangers. &quot;Our Talk Show&quot; follows strangers who all came together through a sign that says &quot;Talk to Me&quot;. Part of the film looks at the lack of public spaces that are for the community: community gardens, community centers, places where people could gather and speak on issues of importance to them. I would be interested in interviewing people who you think are good to interview about the topic. Also need volunteers to go and take a sign that says &quot;Talk to Me About...&quot;, possibly discussing politics, and document people's discussion. Call me at 718 721 4066 or 718 305 4926 or email me directly degamuna@yahoo.com. The film was one of 5 films selected to be presented at Hotdocs Democracy Project recently. <br />Check here. <br />http://www.hotdocs.ca/industry_democracy.cfm <br />Anyone available to do &quot;Talk to Me About.. whatever&quot;? I was thinking of shooting subway stations as people come out to have signs that say &quot;Talk&quot; and film the discussions. I need a cinematographer(so I could talk myself, and I have a camera), volunteers to make signs with me, a volunteer to get people's signs re release forms, or anything that will probably come up. Let me know if you guys are into it. Feel free to recruit anyone else. It would be great if it became a crowd.

				Really exciting idea! &nbsp;I have a friend who is like a walking encyclopedia on environmental issues and really articulate (and eccentric) so I'll ask her. &nbsp;I would offer myself to talk on the government but unfortunately, I only end up ranting and raving and foaming at the mouth on that subject! &nbsp;I think the Drinking Liberally is probably the place for me:lol:
