				With warm weather, a transit fare hike, and new Queens bike lanes all around the corner, it&#039;s the perfect time to buy a bicycle!<br /><br />Our annual sale of &quot;slightly used bikes&quot; starts Monday May 4th! All of these almost new bikes have been assembled and maintained by our mechanics and some have only been ridden once. We&#039;re selling some of them for less than half of what they&#039;d sell for brand-new.<br /><br />Quantities are limited and the selection varies by size. Among the models available are: Jamis Ranger SX for&nbsp; $199; Fuji Montery 3.0 for $250 and Fuji Crosstown 1.0 for $300<br /><br />Spokesman Cycles<br />49-04 Vernon Boulevard<br />Long Island City, NY <br />(#7 train to Vernon/Jackson or G train to 21st Street)<br />718-433-0450

				Just saw this.&nbsp; Spokeman Cycles are a great local shop.&nbsp; The owners Carlos and Ilana really take a huge interest in our neighborhood, they belong to some of the local park based community groups and the shop has always been a big help with donating goods and gift certificates for silent auctions and raffles to help raise money for the same local community groups.&nbsp; Plus, they got great bikes.

				I disagree with this shop being helpful as I didn&#039;t find anyone in the store helpful at all.&nbsp; I walked up to the only person working and I mentioned how I didn&#039;t know anything about bikes but that I enjoy riding and wanted to simply find a bike to help me do that.&nbsp; The guy told me that the only bike for me was a used bike for $299.&nbsp; When I mentioned that I didn&#039;t have $299 to spend on a bike he just stared at me.&nbsp; So I left.&nbsp; <br /><br />I went there mainly for the potential for a good sale but didn&#039;t find one.&nbsp; Last year I had success talking to a guy in a bike shops closer to the 20&#039;s (24th ave-ish I think) and will pound the pavement this weekend to find a bike.&nbsp;
