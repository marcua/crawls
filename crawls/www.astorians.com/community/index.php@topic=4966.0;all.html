								<div class="inner" id="msg_51287">Hey Astorians,<br /><br />So, I have this weird fascination with apartments in NYC.&nbsp; They are all so different, and though I love my apartment and have no intention of moving, I am constantly perusing Craigslist to see what&#39;s out there.&nbsp; I thought it might be interesting for people to describe their Astoria apartments: type/rooms/location/price/roommates/benefits/downfalls, etc.<br /><br />(I put this in the Local Chat section rather than the real estate section, because this thread is not intended to discuss available apartments or people looking for them.&nbsp; It&#39;s rather a forum to share what your living situation is like.)<br /><br />I&#39;ll start.<br /><br />I live with my girlfriend in a 2-bedroom apartment around 36th Ave and 24th St.&nbsp; It&#39;s a 3 family house, we live on the top floor, and my landlord lives on the second floor.&nbsp; The large bedroom is quite sizeable, and the smaller bedroom is used as an art studio.&nbsp; The living room is large, and there is a separate dining room.&nbsp; The kitchen is not huge, but quite adequate.&nbsp; The building is a 1965 rowhouse in decent condition.&nbsp; The view from our bedroom is a fantastic one of Manhattan - Queensboro Bridge, Empire State Building and Chrystler Building, etc.&nbsp; We have two cats and parking is easy...90% of the time on our block...with street cleaning only once a week per side.&nbsp; We pay $1500/month and our rent has blessedly not increased in the three years we&#39;ve been living there.&nbsp; All in all, it&#39;s a great situation.&nbsp; The biggest frustrations are living so close to a slightly-OCD landlord and the fact that we cannot control the heat.&nbsp; That&#39;s not abnormal in NYC, but our landlord will often turn it off all together when he and his family are not home.&nbsp; At least we don&#39;t pay for the heat.<br /><br />What&#39;s your living situation?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

I even have same view.&nbsp; My landlord is like 5 kajillion years old and also controls my heat.. Good thing she has collected so, many sweaters in her lifetime which she layers on for warmth, leaving my apartment at a whopping 62 degrees at most times. Other crappy thing.. She&#39;s buys cheap oil to heat the house so, everytime she burns it my pad smells like a cross between Citronella candles and old shoe leather, umm yum.<br /><br />Can&#39;t beat the price (1550) or that I can do Cartwheels in my living room.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_51298">Cool thread idea.<br /><br />We&#39;re at 35th Ave and 35th Street.&nbsp; My sis and I LOVE our apartment.&nbsp; Loathe and despise our neighbors, but love our actual living quarters.&nbsp; The bedrooms are huge - here is a list of furniture I have managed to cram into my bedroom with loads of room to spare: long desk, filing cabinet with big printer, bookcase, twin bed, 6-drawer horizontal dresser, night table.&nbsp; My sister&#39;s bedroom is even bigger.&nbsp; It has a giant living room, good-sized (small, but workable) bathroom, nice entryway, and hall closet.&nbsp; The kitchen is small and narrow, but well-designed (meaning the fridge, oven, and sink are in convenient places), with more storage space than you&#39;d expect for such a wee kitchen.&nbsp; Plus, it had all been renovated just before we moved in so all the appliances, fixtures, paint, and hardware are brand new.&nbsp; It&#39;s close to the train,&nbsp; Arharn Thai (my new favorite Thai place - sorry Wave), Bravo, laundry facilities, little delis for quick shopping, Pathmark, and makes for a healthy walk when I come up to visit you Ditmars people.&nbsp; Broadway is only two blocks away.&nbsp; If something horrible happened and I had to walk home from Queensboro Plaza, it wouldn&#39;t be too far.&nbsp; The Studios are really close, AMMI is right there, and Sunswick is right up the street.<br /><br />Disadvantages include - and sorry if you&#39;re tired of me saying this - my noisy, obnoxious neighbors (who play in the courtyard despite several signs and who have raucous parties at least once a week in the vestibule and on our landing, complete with beer cans and cigarette butts everywhere the next day), the construction of the Frank Sinatra High School of the Arts across the street, the renovation at all hours of the apartment in the next building which shares a wall with my sis&#39; bedroom and our living room, and the Floridian heat.&nbsp; <br /><br />Other than that, we&#39;re tolerably happy here, and we love our kitty, Bella.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)&nbsp; Oh yeah, and rent is $1600 a month and includes water and heat.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_51312">oooooh good idea! I was so traumatized with moving apartments this past summer that i also haven&#39;t stopped checking out craigslist daily just to see whats out there! lol (we love our place).<br /><br />My BF and I live in a 1br on 23rd ave and 37th street. Its a new building (only 1 year old when we moved in) next to the Amtrak tressle (which is actually quite fun to look at, and not noisy). Its on the 3rd floor and we love it mostly because it was the cleanest place we saw with the most amenities. For 1350 we have a great sized bedroom with a big closet a long hallway and a good sized living room with a cute kitchen. The balcony off the LV is a big plus. Its a walkup but there is a super and laundry in the basement and the best thing is the place is practically soundproof. We&#39;ve had big parties and so have our neighbors and we&#39;ve never heard a thing or gotten a complaint.<br /><br />There are only 8 units and everyone is in their 20&#39;s /30&#39;s and are good for saying hello in the stairwell or making sure someone&#39;s package gets in front of their door. <br /><br />Only complaint is that we pay all utils (Con Ed runs $100 for heat/elec) and we get howlers (i.e. kids that go under the train tressle and howl because of the loud echo at night.) But other than that its ideal. Plus 1 ave from ditmars and a 5 min walk to the train.<br />It was a a long search. lol.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_51320">On Oct 28th I had moved from Clinton Hill, Brooklyn to LIC/Astoria area. I too had frantically searched Craigslist, though to no avail.&nbsp; Almost at wits end, a good friend referred me to his building/landlord, who I signed a 2 year lease with.&nbsp; This landlord offered me a preferential monthly rent (dropping it down several hundred a month so I could afford it). The rent is $1100. Gas &amp; Electric are additional.&nbsp; <br /><br />I live alone in a 4th floor walk-up, 1 bedroom situated on 36th Ave &amp; 30th St. The location is ideal for me.&nbsp; One short block from the 36th Ave N/W stop and less than a 1/2 hour commute. The apartment is a good size for me, has high ceilings (a real plus when you’re 6’4”) and a window in every room.&nbsp; I really like that there is both southern and northern sky exposure.&nbsp; Essentially, it&#39;s a quite buliding and neighborhood.&nbsp; </div>

Real estate is a hobby here. I love to look up at the lit windows at night as I&#39;m walking home and try to sneak a peak into people&#39;s homes/lives. Not in a pervy way, more just fascination. SO many people live on top of each other in this city. Every window is a story, you know?<br /><br />I moved into my place at 31st Ave and 34th St in the fall of 05 after living with a friend in a small 2 bedroom in Brooklyn for two years. I started paying 1,050, but it went up as per the rent-stabilized percentage, last fall. It&#39;s a one-bedroom, which is more than I need or can afford (originally I was looking for a studio), but it&#39;s worth it to me because it&#39;s all my own and it feels like a home and for a homebody like me, that&#39;s key to staying sane. And of course, that&#39;s priceless. :)<br /><br />It&#39;s a small building (7 apartments), and most of the people in it have lived there forever. The landlord is an elderly couple that live upstairs. They don&#39;t speak very good english but I adore them as they keep the building immaculate and everything working properly and are very friendly. Everyone&#39;s really quiet, except for the psycho woman who lives in the building next door, but she&#39;s only an irritant during the warmer months, when she goes outside and hollers at everyone/thing in the street. But she means well...<br /><br />Pluses: huge eat-in kitchen (if you&#39;ve ever seen Jen &amp; Jonathan&#39;s, it&#39;s about that size) though I use the eat-in part as an office; windows in every room and facing both the front and back of the building; fabulous &amp; large laundromat across the street; lots &#39;o storage space including massive closet in bedroom, plus coat closet, and large storage spaces above both of them; the pretty floors and original wood trim around the doorways and the doors themselves, most of which have escaped being painted over.<br /><br />Negs: Street noise, as my bedroom/living room face the street &amp; I&#39;m on the 2nd floor; creaky floor boards - SOO creaky my fat cat even makes the occasional noise as he walks around; ugly carpet in the bedroom, but necessary to help with noise; ugly block, in my opinion (There just aren&#39;t many trees on it, and all the buildings are flat-front and tall.); erratic water temperature in the shower - I call it playing air traffic controller in the morning as I&#39;m constantly adjusting the knobs; the high gloss white paint my dear landlord slapped up on the walls as I was moving in. Yes, I STILL haven&#39;t mustered the strength/energy to prime and paint over it.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_51343">Excellent idea. &nbsp;I too cruise Craig&#39;s list just to get ideas.<br /><br />Private house duplex on 39th Avenue and 28th Street, occupying the first two floors, with a seperate renter above. &nbsp;Upstairs are the two bedrooms and utility room with nice hardwood floors. &nbsp;The office is spacious and has a floor to ceiling bookcase the owner installed. &nbsp;Downstairs is the country kitchen and living room combination with ceramic floors. &nbsp;Also have two storage rooms and a washer/dryer. &nbsp;Nice oakwood steps connecting the two floors. &nbsp;Lots of closet space all over the place. &nbsp;Overall a pretty unique place.<br /><br />Outside is a 1000 square foot backyard, with fig, apple and cherry trees. &nbsp;My landlord lives out of town. Rent is 2000 per month.<br /><br />Drawbacks: &nbsp;Miserly landlord when it comes to heat. &nbsp;The bathroom is nice but small, nothing to write home (or here) about.<br /><br />Love the Dutch Kills location, especially since that&#39;s a five minute walk to work. &nbsp;It&#39;s a bit more industrial than Astoria, but it makes it pretty quaint. &nbsp;Very quiet. &nbsp;It does stink though when going out on Broadway or 30th Avenue. &nbsp;</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_51397">Definitely an awesome thread idea.&nbsp; I have always been interested in RE and just hooked up employment with a real estate company that does rentals and sales, just to pay the bills until FDNY decides the love me, and it&#39;s been a trip seeing all of the places.&nbsp; <br /><br />I lucked out and moved in with a friend, of a friend that&#39;s coworkers, of a friend...kinda like Spaceballs.&nbsp; I lucked out because the guy is cool and everything&#39;s working out well.&nbsp; Not like my college roommate that could have given Animal Planet a run for its money with all of the wildlife that we had in my apartment.&nbsp; Snakes, tarantulas, iguanas, and birds.&nbsp; It was a effing zoo of animals (mostly) that I didn&#39;t want a damn thing to do with.&nbsp; Especially Fluffy the tarantula...&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, we&#39;re in a 2 or 3 family, there is actually a front apartment on the 2nd floor with no one in it, so I&#39;m guessing 3 is right.<br /><br />It&#39;s a super quiet, 2nd floor, 2 bed apartment.&nbsp; Besides for floor creaks and occasional parties on Sunday nights next door, it&#39;s dead quiet.&nbsp; It&#39;s nothing too spacious, but it&#39;s definitely not like we&#39;re bumping into eachother.&nbsp; The living room is probably 15x15, the kitchen has enough room for half a circular table and enough counter space, and the bedrooms hold a full-sized bed comfortably with furniture and desks.&nbsp; The bathroom isn&#39;t very big but it&#39;s big enough to dress in and the shower is AWESOME with great pressure.<br /><br />We&#39;re only paying electric, we have our own heat control, and the landlord is super cool.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#39;s a bit far being around 42nd St. and 21st Ave., especially when it&#39;s Arctic outside, but for $1400 a month, it&#39;s not so bad.</div>

Parking is a dream come true....well, except on alternate side days, but even then no big deal now that I take the car to work before 9:30am.&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />No bedbugs (just a small threat that seems to have been eradicated), roaches were practically non-existant until the blackout and ConEd stirred &#39;em up- now they&#39;re sporadic.<br /><br />I&#39;m stupidly happy here&nbsp; :lol:<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_77417">I just stumbled on this thread and want to revive it!<br /><br />My roommate and I are on 36th Street and 21st Avenue. We have a three bedroom on the top floor of a 2-family home (our landlords are downstairs). We have a Goldilocks set-up--the bedrooms are large, medium and small. Mine&#039;s the big one, my roommate has the medium one, and we&#039;ve turned the small room into a hamster kingdom/office/guest room. We have a very nice sized living room, small bathroom and smallish kitchen, and an enormous private balcony. We pay $1750 per month. <br /><br />Pros: <br />--The apartment was in unbelievably gorgeous condition. When they renovated it, they did it right--high quality tile and wood flooring, all-tile bathroom, granite counters in the kitchen, screens in every window--just really, really nice. It&#039;s still practically gleaming and is very easy to keep clean because every surface is smooth. <br />--The block is quiet and residential, and people are friendly. <br />--The balcony. We can (and have) easily fit 15 people, a table, and a grill out there. We can watch planes take off and land from it. <br />--Our landlords are adorable and really great. They gave us a beautiful rose bush when we moved in (which I am trying desperately not to kill), have brought goodies up to us several times, and are always happy to lend us outdoor chairs when we have parties. <br /><br />Cons:<br />--The large bedroom has no closet, the medium bedroom is right off the kitchen, and the small bedroom is Manhattan-sized and shaped. It&#039;s not our ideal layout.<br />--The walk to the train is a bit further than I would have preferred--but parking is great, and my roommate loves that.<br />--We just saw our third giant roach in two weeks (one outside, two inside). I can&#039;t figure out how the place would be SO clean but have these big roaches, so I&#039;m hoping they&#039;re maybe coming in from outside somehow. Still...ugh.<br />--Despite our lovely landlords, I think I would still prefer to live in a building instead of a private home. We don&#039;t have parties often, but I&#039;d still rather piss off neighbors than someone with the power to evict me. <br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_77455">We LOVE our apartment. <br /><br />we&#039;re on 41st/Newtown<br /><br />Our building is kept in immaculate condition by our landlord.&nbsp; In fact our front stoop is SO appealing that it is frequently used by....the neighborhood teens as a hangout, random passersby, the democratic club going to AC once a month....<br /><br />It&#039;s a three story - three family Brick corner rowhouse.&nbsp; We have windows facing east, west and south.&nbsp; The front of what should be an alley is blocked by our neighbors garage - so there is no access to our yard except through our apartment or our basement (or over the neighboring fences) - excellent - privacy and some security. <br /><br />Interior...<br />It&#039;s basically a railroad +.&nbsp; All very long and narrow - but oh so comfy...<br />front room is our living room - our furniture is way to big for the size of the room - but there&#039;s room to seat 5 or 6 plus a few folk on the floor if we wanted to.&nbsp; Jonathan&#039;s closet is also in this room. <br /><br />Middle room is the office/dressing room - two desks, a couple of dressers and my closet.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dining/Living space opens up in the middle of the apartment - This is the only wide room&nbsp; (the two front rooms share the width of the building with the hallway).&nbsp; &nbsp;We have our dining room table seats 6 (8 if we crowd) - we can open it up and fit 10 (more if we had too).&nbsp; A china cabinet, two upholstered arm chairs with ottoman and small table, bookcase/cabinet. <br /><br />The kitchen - is long narrow - we have a small table in there that we never use - a couple of butcher blocks lots of cabinets - but never enough space - counter, cabinet, refridgerator or anything.... <br /><br />The bedroom is very small.&nbsp; We have a queen size bed with two night tables - a blanket chest and tall dresser (sounds like it&#039;s big) - there&#039;s about two and a half feet on each side of the bed I suppose. <br /><br />The bathroom is miniscule - the toilet and the sink don&#039;t actually both fit - so as you sit on&nbsp; the toilet you get the sink jabbing into your arm if you&#039;re not careful.&nbsp; <br /><br />The best part of the apartment at this time of the year is definitely the backyard.&nbsp; Jonathan has created a beautiful warm welcoming garden/living space.&nbsp; The flowers are great - the grapes are intimidating us with their volume this year - we have a nesting mourning dove in our grape arbor - a grill - room to seat 12+ for a sitdown meal or room - <br /><br />and in general the whole place is QUIET.&nbsp; Beautifully - peacefully quiet.&nbsp; <br />My neighbors with the perpetual yard sale SUCK (see other thread for that info).&nbsp; My neighbors with the perpetually yapping little rat dog SUCK.... but other than that.... our place ROCKS!!!&nbsp; We love our home. <br /><br /><br />location - I thought the walk to the subway was going to be bad - and in the winter - it is a miserable 7 minute walk - but that&#039;s not so bad.&nbsp; We&#039;re too conveniently located to NYSC - I hate the place - but I know that I won&#039;t travel the 10 minutes to another less conveniently located gym.&nbsp; <br /><br />I do wish there were food purveyors between the Steinway St stop and our house.&nbsp; <br /><br />All that for $1850/month.... I used to think it was high... I&#039;m beginning to think that we&#039;ve got a bargain.&nbsp; Shhhh - don&#039;t tell our landlord. <br /><br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_77524">I live in a one-bedroom in a prewar co-op near the Broadway stop.&nbsp; The apartment is designed very rationally: you walk into a large foyer, with the living room straight ahead, a small hallway (containing a broom closet and pantry) and the kitchen off to the left, and the bathroom and bedroom slightly to the left and ahead.&nbsp; Archways separate the hallways and living room from the foyer.&nbsp; I just had my kitchen redone, so it&#039;s completely brand new, but the bathroom will need work eventually.&nbsp; It still has much of the original details--black and white tile floor, clothes hamper built into the wall--as well as the original faucets in the shower.&nbsp; The bedroom can easily hold a king-size bed and dresser with room to spare; I have 2 closets that I would like to combine into one big one someday.&nbsp; The living room is a good size too.<br /><br />The acoustics are such that I can hear everything in the hallways, but generally it&#039;s quiet.&nbsp; Most of my windows face the parking lot of the apartment building two doors down, so occasionally I hear someone&#039;s car stereo at odd hours.&nbsp; (Too bad the lights of the parking lot are on until just before daybreak.)&nbsp; The building is generally well run, and I think they&#039;re planning to redo the lobby this year.&nbsp; I have a storage unit and there&#039;s laundry in the building.&nbsp; I hope to be there for the long haul.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_78535">Me and my boyfriend live in the apartment complexes on Crescent Street between Ditmars Blvd. and 21st Ave. <br /><br />It&#039;s a 1 bedroom and we pay $1300 (it&#039;s being raised to 1325 this year, bleh!). The buildings are older, but really well maintained with a live-in super. We live on the 2nd flr of a 4 flr walk up, there are 8 apartments to every floor.<br /><br />The inside of our apartment is completely renovated as the landlord company renovates all vacated apartments. The hardwood is new, the kitchen has new ceramic tiles, nice dark cherry wood cabinets, and brand new appliances. Bathroom has new features as well, except for the old white &amp; black floors (which I actually love!). It&#039;s sort of set up RR style. You enter a long narrow hallway and the living room/kitchen open up to each other, only separated by a &quot;bar&quot; which is the perfect place to eat. Next is the bathroom and bedroom.<br /><br />Pros: All new! Quiet at night, close to the park and the train, no mice, no bed bugs. I&#039;ve only seen 6 bugs in 7 months! The building has an exterminator walk around the building on the 2nd Saturday of Every month to see if anyone wants their apartment sprayed. We&#039;ve only had him come in once just for the heck of it. He just squirts this stuff in the kitchen and bathroom (take about 30 seconds).<br /><br />Negatives: Directly across from St. John&#039;s Prep HS and the kids can be LOUD. Actually it tends to be the annoying parents who blast really bad music from their cars as they wait to pick up their kids. It&#039;s really hard to get packages delivered because the front door is locked and Fed Ex/UPS never leaves the packages outside. The buildings have a No Pet policy (we really want a dog!). The guy who lives below us is this older gentlemen and the two times we&#039;ve had a small party (everyone was out by midnight) he banged on the pipes to get our attention. I thought it was pretty rude considering we&#039;re quiet 98% of the time we&#039;ve been here.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;8-)</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_78787">I love my pad!&nbsp; I am on 31st Street by 21 Ave and on the third floor of a 3 story house.&nbsp; There is a duplex below, you walk in the front door of the house and there is the steepest stairs you ever seen in your life, then a french door door to another straight set of stairs and then my door.&nbsp; The stairs are a GREAT workout but suck when I am bringing in equipment or laundry. Once you walk in,&nbsp; there is a bathroom to your right, its awesome, completely renovated, huge tub, french doors, the kitchen is really REALLY sunny, and big, got funky 60s mod white cabinets and sink to match, came with new fridge and stove, then the living room, nice space about 10&#039; x 12&#039;, then my bedroom, 10&#039; x 9&#039; and my music studio 7&#039; x 9&#039; and I have 2 walk in closets.&nbsp; The floor needs to be finished though, but its ok.&nbsp; I get a LOT of natural sun light in, the sun rises by the kitchen and sets by the bedroom, there are so many windows so I dont have to turn on any lights until 8pm!&nbsp; Its got a very airy feeling to it and good energy in the house for sure.&nbsp; My view from the bathroom and kitchen windows is of tall trees and cool funky rooftops (the trees are good for privacy) and the view from the bedroom and studio is of the windows from the garden apartments accross the street.&nbsp; My landlord is very nice and lives upstate and I pay 1100/month with heat and hot water included.&nbsp; I am having a housewarming on the 7th, PM me for info&nbsp; 8-)</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_78853">One bedroom Broadway/31st Ave area, top floor of 4 story building with 24 apts in it.&nbsp; I really like living here in my first apt in Astoria/Queens - I grew up in Manhattan and then moved around a lot in Brooklyn.&nbsp; I like the laid back feel of the place and yet it&#039;s so close to the action!<br /><br />Pros:<br />-&nbsp; Exposed brick walls in the LR and kitchen and the rest of walls painted a sunny yellow - recently renovated when I moved in<br />-&nbsp; Close to everything on Broadway but not on Broadway<br />-&nbsp; Apt faces the back, away from street noise<br />-&nbsp; Heat and plumbing is great<br />-&nbsp; Rent just went up to $1231, which no longer seems outrageous after reading what you all are paying<br /><br />Cons:<br />-&nbsp; No sound insulation whatsoever.&nbsp; I&#039;m on the top floor bec I thought I would be protected - no such luck.&nbsp; If my downstairs neighbors really want to get into it, they will keep the volume up way past midnight!&nbsp; So far, there have been 3 different neighbors and these latest ones are the most quiet.&nbsp; I envy the person who posted that tenants could have parties in the building and not bother each other!<br />-&nbsp; For some odd reason, if I want to turn on the oven, the (smoke?) alarm goes off.&nbsp; Also, there is no exhaust over the stove.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think this kitchen was made for cooking.<br />-&nbsp; Tiny closets (2). I had to get rid of quite a lot to move in here<br />-&nbsp; Tiny overall space, I think my place is less than 450 sq<br />-&nbsp; The rent just went up to $1231!<br /><br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_78868"><a href="http://www.rentometer.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Rentometer</a> is a really neat website for comparing rent to other people in the area. Upper Astoria has a lot of entries on here.<br /><br />Our apartment is in a 3 family home on (in the 40&#039;s). We&#039;re on street level, so we get a lot of noise, but the backyard and back porch make it all worth it. It&#039;s almost a studio apartment - the only thing seperating the bedroom from the living room is a set of those folding doors (large cracks around the edges). The house was built in the 1920&#039;s so there are a lot of cool little woodwork details around the windows and stuff. At the same time there are a lot of unrepaired holes in the walls and other similar problems you find in old homes.<br /><br />Our rent is almost $1400 a month, which is a little high for a 1 bedroom, but, again, I was willing to pay for it due to the use of the backyard. We have a nice little tomato garden out back.<br /><br />Our neighbors are excellent. The guys upstairs must work all of the time because I barely hear them (they get in late, but it doesn&#039;t bother me). The guy downstairs threw one party at the end of the semester earlier this year, but he invited us and was highly apologetic about the noise (who cares if somebody throws a party once in a blue moon? If it were every night I&#039;d be pissed, but this guy is pretty friendly so I can&#039;t complain).<br /><br />Over all I like our apartment. I wish it were cheaper, but I&#039;m glad to have a little greenery out back.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_78923">I also don&#039;t love my apartment.&nbsp; I dont&#039; hate it, but I&#039;m always looking for something affordable that I might like more, so I cruise CL all the time.<br /><br />As for the apartment itself:<br />1 Bedroom on the second floor of a 4 story building, 16 units in total.&nbsp; It&#039;s your standard prewar railroad, kitchen to your right as you walk in the front door, then the living room and as you pass the water closet to your left you&#039;ll spot one of our two very, very small closets and enter the bedroom.&nbsp; The apartment has lots of charm in the way of cool detailing on the walls, and the landlord keeps the building up very well.&nbsp; It&#039;s in the back of the building so it&#039;s nice and quiet, which I appreciate.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;ve been in there for just over 4 years at this point, and while it was great when it was just me, it can get cramped with two people living there, mostly due to lack of storage space.&nbsp; We only have two small closets (28&quot;x28&quot;) for the whole apartment, and next to no storage / counter space in the kitchen (we could use new appliances and flooring in there, but I have no clue when a landlord is supposed to replace those sorts of things, so I&#039;m hesitant to ask).&nbsp; Our sunlight situation kind of stinks too, since the only window that gets direct sunlight is the one in the rear of the bedroom, which tends to wake me up around 7AM on the weekends.&nbsp; All of our other windows face the building next door, but I have never seen anything interesting going on in there.<br />Every time my lease comes up, I inevitably look for a new place, but my landlord keeps hooking me up, so I still pay under $1200 a month, and I haven&#039;t seen anywhere else I have really wanted to live for under $1500, which is steep for us.&nbsp; Plus I would only move for somewhere with considerably more storeage and / or a backyard.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_79239">Hey All, Newbie to the forum here, and I thought this would be a good place to start-<br /><br />37th and Ditmars, 2nd floor walk up, 3 Bedroom. I am a musician living with 2 other musicians, also around my age (25), who also work 9-5ers. I think we lucked out huuuuuge on the place. It has a decent sized living room, eat-in (sort-of :-o) Kitchen, 3 Bedrooms, and 1 bath. We also have a good sized roof, with access to go up and BBQ, hang out, lounge, play music, enjoy the awesome view of the bridges and city lights. We live above Martha&#039;s Bakery, so there is no worries about us playing music in the wee hours, and our neighbors don&#039;t care. 24 hour Supermarket downstairs, McCann&#039;s right there and the smell of fresh baked goods when I wake up every morning. :lol:The best part.... $1800/Month Rent Total, so about $600+/- each.<br /><br />The only con: The place needs minor renos- kitchen is kind of old, and the flooring is a bit dated in the kitchen and hallway. (The Living room has nice hardwood flooring.) Could use a fresh coat of paint all around. </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_79260">Corner of 21st street and 24th Drive (last house before the TriBorough Bridge). We live on the 1st floor of a 3 family (originally it was a single family) detached house. (Landlady, landlady&#039;s son, occasionally landlady&#039;s son&#039;s gf, and since December Landlady&#039;s daughter and new twin grandchildren live upstairs. Someone with a sliding trombone lives downstairs but he only plays during daylight and i can&#039;t say the same for our beloved toddler, so i don&#039;t mind) Our private entrance opens up to a weird entryway room. On the right, two equally large bedrooms (we have a kingsize bed and a toddler bed next to each other on one wall, three dressers on the opposite wall, and two square closets in each bedroom) and a regular small bathroom with pink and black tile. To the left, one large enough walk through kitchen (completely unrenovated) to the awe-inspiringly huge, light living room with nice wooden floors. <br /><br />Rent was 1500 when we moved in (three years ago next month!), got raised last year to 1650 and ready to argue if landlady tries to raise it again this summer. For a few days longer we have a subletter in the second bedroom, but he&#039;s found a better place and we&#039;re happy for him. Sniffle. (Maybe it&#039;s time beloved toddler had his own room...)<br /><br />Pros: Huge apt, we enjoy the first and second sunsets the TriB gives us. (Really confused the first time the sun blinked out-- as the passing tractor trailers blotted it out briefly) Landlady takes care of things the second time we mention them (after I say, &quot;shall we take care of it ourselves and send you the bill?&quot;), and a mere block away from Astoria Park. Short enough commute to everything we need and have been here long enough that the neighbors who grew up here are starting to be friendly and involve us in neighborhood stuff. We have access to the big pleasant yard but not allowed to mess with it, so have a huge container garden to ease my need for green.<br /><br />Cons: TriB and 21st St loud. Twins loud. (But then, so is our beloved toddler) Carpet in bedrooms not loud enough. Urge to *own* domestic situation, very loud. :*)</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_79298">There are different configurations in NYCHA apartments, and I have the worst - when you open the front door you are right in the traffic pattern of the apartment - there&#039;s nowhere to step, right, left, or forward, to take off your shoes, so every time we walk in we are tracking dirt.&nbsp; The idiotic arrangement also makes it difficult to bring furniture in, because when you open the apartment door, immediately opposite you is a closet.<br /><br />The apartment is small.&nbsp; Unlike other NYCHA apartments I don&#039;t have a dining area.&nbsp; I have to use half my living room for the dining area.&nbsp; My kitchen is half the length of a normal NYCHA kitchen, and wholly inadequate because the numbskulls (can you tell I&#039;m angry?) who approved the &quot;modernization&quot; plan a decade or so ago put in box style lower cabinets instead of L shaped ones.&nbsp; I have a lower cabinet about 4&#039; wide with a door opening only 11&quot; wide.&nbsp; This replaced a cabinet with not only a normal sized door, but access through it&#039;s own door and the double door under the sink.&nbsp; I now have a 4 foot long space perfect for storing things I never intend to use again!&nbsp; <br /><br />If the housing authority sold the buildings I would buy my apartment, though.&nbsp; As the originator of this thread knows, the intersection of 36<sup>th</sup> Ave and 24<sup>th</sup> St is an ideal place to live!&nbsp; About 5 blocks from the train, about 5 blocks from the river.&nbsp; 3 stops from Manhattan.&nbsp; Great view of Manhattan from street level (I used to see it from my bedroom in my previous apartment.)&nbsp; Now I have a great view of the first branch of a big tree.&nbsp; It&#039;s like living in a tree house.&nbsp; I have squirrel-scape.&nbsp; In the Eastern distance I see the northward landing approach of LaGuardia Airport.&nbsp; I have big windows and get sunlight almost all day.&nbsp; But I absolutely needed to buy two air conditioners.&nbsp; All my windows face the same direction - no cross ventilation.&nbsp; <br /><br />The sidewalks on my block are wide with open spaces at the corners.&nbsp; I have a good view of the moon and there is enough open space to see constellations.&nbsp; The housing projects are planted with many tall trees, so it is like living in a park.&nbsp; If only more people thought of it that way and didn&#039;t drop their garbage and cleaned up after their dogs.&nbsp; There are many comfortable benches to sit on.&nbsp; Ravenswood is on 4 big city blocks, and, going north, are Queensview, also with many trees and benches, and Queensview West, which changed its name to Queensview North, also tree lined with benches.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />My taste in decoration is nautical cottage.&nbsp; It was greatly helped along by a lighthouse shaped lamp I bought at the home furnishing store on Ditmars at 31<sup>st</sup> St for my living room.&nbsp; I always have my walls painted white because it reflects light and keeps the apartment bright.&nbsp; If I bought my apartment I would have furniture custom built to maximize storage and wall space with white wainscoting going half way up the walls and the upper half left bare to keep the airy feeling.&nbsp; My livingroom chairs are too big for my space, but I love them - big pillowbacks from Sears in blue gingham and blue floral, and I love my blue gingham ottoman.&nbsp; I have a white coffee table with wicker baskets that slide out from either the front or back of the table.<br /><br />My bedroom has blueberry colored sheets and a blue and white delft comforter.&nbsp; I had to buy cabinets on wheels for the bedroom because there is so little room to move furniture around when washing the floor.&nbsp; I have wood furniture in a colonial style, and a collection of liquor bottles on a book shelf and various Barbies, including a princess in pink and an Irish princess in green.<br /><br />I have many different fragrances of incense.&nbsp; The fragrance I most recently burned is Ocean, which I bought at Target.&nbsp; It is light and refreshing and smells the way I want my apartment to look.</div>
