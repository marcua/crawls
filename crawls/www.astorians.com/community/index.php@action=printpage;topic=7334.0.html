				With the Democrats nearly falling over themselves making promises to initiate and expand entitlement programs and Republicans having just presided over the single greatest increase in U.S. entitlement program history (Prescription Drug Benefits &quot;plan&quot;), I&#039;m just floored by the utter lack of common sense prevailing in this country right now.<br /><br />The debt of this country&#039;s federal government is approximately 8.9 trillion dollars. Factor in the debt of states and local governments, plus all of the unfunded liabilities such as Social Security, Medicare, federal employee pensions, etc. and you&#039;re looking at close to $60 trillion of debt. That&#039;s $60,000,000,000,000.00.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-o<br /><br />So I see and hear throngs of people who are applauding Obama or Edwards or Clinton or.... gulp...Kucinich.... when they talk about socializing medicine or initiating other new entitlement programs... and I wonder...<br /><br />What on Earth or in heaven or in hell is everybody counting on? <br /><br />I&#039;m not saying the Republicans are any better because they&#039;re really not when it comes time to vote (billions in subsidies). The point is, when you&#039;re basically out of money, you don&#039;t tell the waiter that you&#039;re going to buy meals for everyone in the restaurant, you don&#039;t pretend that you can get something for nothing just because the bill hasn&#039;t arrived yet... you really have no business going out to eat! <br /><br />Leaving aside for the moment the myriad empirical/historical/moral points I would raise to dissuade anyone from advocating that the government of any country intervene in people&#039;s free, peaceful exchanges of goods and services, I just wonder, really, whether any of the people on this board who are enthusiastic about any of the major party candidates are to some extent... to ANY extent... concerned about U.S. debt. It&#039;s kind of an abstract issue, something that I suspect many people don&#039;t really get riled up about because it&#039;s somewhat elusive. But the truth is that we&#039;re talking about the value of the money in your pocket.&nbsp; And we&#039;re talking about the fact that today&#039;s benefits are going to be paid for by our generation&#039;s children and grandchildren. (Every time there&#039;s an ad on tv with a kid being force-fed a line to regurgitate about social security &quot;being there for me&quot;, the brazen cynicism of it makes me nauseous.)<br /><br />For every dollar in your pocket, the federal government owes $4.48. Each U.S. citizen (including babies) &quot;owes&quot; over $28,500. This is unf!ckingbelievable enough, but the idea that people want to ignore this debt and trust our government to render an ever-increasing percentage of our economy wasteful and inefficient is even worse. Basically, our entitlement state is sucking us dry.&nbsp; :|<br /><br />Since the early 1990s, the debt has increased over $15,000,000,000,000. Since 2001&#039;s terrorist attacks, it&#039;s gone up $2,700,000,000,000. That&#039;s not all military spending, folks. The majority of the debt is a result of social security plus medicare/medicaid. Because the federal government (Republicans and Democrats, hand in hand) has been siphoning the surpluses in those accounts to make up for revenue shortfalls, the debt cannot be calculated with great accuracy.&nbsp; For this kind of thing, in the private sector, pension managers go to jail. :x<br /><br />And all of this matters because, in the final analysis, there is no such thing as a sustainable economy built on explosively accelerating debt expansion. Either a crisis precipitated by voluntary abandonment of our debt by our creditors (countries like China and Saudi Arabia), or a catastrophic collapse of our currency system all on its own, or a combination of both is going to happen unless the U.S. government disciplines itself to spend less than it takes from us each year. <br /><br />It&#039;s time to look for ways of solving societal problems through entrepreneurial initiatives that incur no more additional government costs. If you think this will be hard to accomplish now, just wait a while. It doesn&#039;t get any easier, unless you believe that the government can just print up the money and then, presto, no more debt.&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br />TANSTAAFL!
