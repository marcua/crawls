				Question for other people around 33rd and 34th Streets in Astoria - is it just me or is NuBar getting worse again?&nbsp; I&#039;m up at 2:55 a.m. and unable to get back to sleep because of their music and bass vibrations.&nbsp; Anyone else in the immediate area up as well?&nbsp; I really wish this place would try to keep the music down and let folks sleep.&nbsp; One more hour to go.

				Thanks!<br />I just wish they&#039;d keep the noise inside and the bass down.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been in this apartment for over 13 years and they are the first club in the location to cause me any grief.&nbsp; I can&#039;t fathom how loud and intense it must be inside their space for it to vibrate my building, and we don&#039;t even adjoin their property, we&#039;re an entire building down the block.

				Howdy.&nbsp; Just so you know, NYC just started a new noise code that applies to clubs.&nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;Under new rules, cops can cite bars and restaurants for blasting music that is &quot;plainly audible&quot; 15 feet from their establishments, which face fines as high as $8,000 for repeated violations.&quot;<br /><br />I suggest you remind this to the local police.&nbsp;

When I called back again and someone finally picked up, they told me to call 911. And I was like, &quot;Call 911? It&#039;s not an emergency, it&#039;s just really annoying.&quot; So, I call 911 and of course 911 chastised me for calling for something that wasn&#039;t an emergency. Any time I ever tried to call them the phone just rang and rang, and if you do get through they either don&#039;t come at all or come an hour or two later when the situation has passed already. I have a much more serious, and scary story I could also relate about the 114, but frankly it&#039;s too long and to even post here.

				Thanks!<br />We formed an egroup and have been talking and commiserating.&nbsp; We are going to take it to the next level and get some action.&nbsp; I am hoping that the 114th will start taking it more seriously.&nbsp; I just can&#039;t believe they get away with operating past 4 a.m. five nights a week and making all the adjoining and nearby buildings vibrate.&nbsp; It is just an outrage.

				This weekend was the worst one ever, four nights of constant thumping, pulsing music until past 4 a.m.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gotten the drill down at 311, I could probably recite their own speech back to them.&nbsp; Vallone&#039;s office has written two letters and has gotten the 114th to take the issue seriously, but NuBar hasn&#039;t changed their spots at all, if anything, it has gotten worse.&nbsp; Not only did they tear down one of the signs we used to organize local residents, complaining about their noise, but they taped it up INSIDE their window, as if to taunt us.&nbsp; I know this is a long process - I saw it take a year or longer many times when I worked in government, but I had no idea how demoralizing it was to have to go through it every single weekend and show up drained to work on Monday.&nbsp; There should be a way to sue these jerks for the negative impact they are having on so many people.&nbsp; I know I don&#039;t even have it as bad as others - the folks in the adjoining the buildings have it far worse.

				I would send all of this information directly to the mayor&#039;s office, by passing even Vallone.&nbsp; It&#039;s worth a shot.&nbsp; Sometimes it takes going directly to the top.&nbsp; Especially if you make it clear you are getting no response due the conflicting interest of the police/fire department employees.<br /><br />If nothing else, I&#039;m curious why they don&#039;t get fined for littering when all of the extra postcards are dumped onto the street directly in front of the bar.

				I never noticed that, but they could be. Our building doesn&#039;t have a side, so they would have to do it along the front, which also includes trees/plants, but it would be directly from on the sidewalk so I doubt it.&nbsp; Cafe Tre is disgusting, but surprisingly, I never hear any noise from there.&nbsp; They do sweep all of the garbage from the outdoor seating area into the street every morning instead of sweeping it up so I&#039;m boycotting them on that alone.&nbsp; Not to mention, that space has a long history of health violations.&nbsp;

				I don&#039;t think anyone has suggested this yet, but what about trying to get their liquor license revoked? Without that, they really haven&#039;t got much of a business (or at least not one that would run into the wee hours).<br /><br /><strong>What can I do about a noisy or rowdy bar?</strong><br />Contact the police department having jurisdiction at the time the disturbance is occurring. <strong>You can also contact the New York State Liquor Authority by way of telephone, written complaint, e-mail, or personal visit to Zone Office (Albany, Buffalo, New York). </strong> Complainant should make a written record of date, time and nature of disorder documenting specific problems with the licensed premises.

Except as otherwise provided in section one hundred twenty-eight-a, it shall be unlawful for any police commissioner, police inspector, captain, sergeant, roundsman, patrolman or other police official or subordinate of any police department in the state, to be either directly or indirectly interested in the manufacture or sale of alcoholic beverages or to offer for sale, or recommend to any licensee any alcoholic beverages.&quot;<br /><br />§ 128-A provides only that &quot;it shall not be unlawful for a police officer employed in this state, having written permission and consent from his commanding officer, to work in a premises licensed to sell beer at retail <em>for off-premises consumption</em>.&quot; [Emphasis mine -- in other words, not a bar.]<br /><br />If anyone has any further information relating to any amendment (or lack thereof) to these laws, I&#039;d be interested in knowing about it, too.&nbsp; There appears to be a current proposed amendment in Committee in the State Senate to expand section 128-A to include wine as well as beer, but it doesn&#039;t seem to affect the requirement that the sale be for off-premises consumption.&nbsp; The New York legislature website started acting up, so I haven&#039;t been able to confirm whether this proposed amendment is in fact being considered.

Generally, grocery stores would fall under this category. Since ownership of a grocery store would not compromise a police officer in his or her enforcement duties, and beer and wine coolers are basic products in such stores, this bill would have the effect of allowing police officers the freedom of involvement in an area of business unrelated to their other professional duties.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I know nothing seems to be able to be done about NuBar, but I&#039;m really starting to fear for my personal safety.&nbsp; My last few calls with the precinct have made me distinctly uncomfortable and given me the impression that I should back off, which I&#039;m sad to admit I have.&nbsp; I just had a run in with the bouncer/security at NuBar in my local bodega where he seemed to want to goad me into a fight.&nbsp; I just stood still and refused to say anything.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t even respond when he called me a faggot as I passed the club earlier in the night.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s only a matter of time before I get assaulted, especially now that someone I assume is tied to the club is buzzing my buzzer most nights between 1 and 3 a.m.&nbsp; I get it that they want me to stop complaining and leave, but I&#039;d never heard of a club doing this, especially not with the cops seeming to think it&#039;s ok.&nbsp; I found out today that another local resident who has been complaining is also getting the buzzer treatment.&nbsp; It&#039;s just so frustrating.

				Oh my god, that&#039;s really disgusting.&nbsp; I can&#039;t believe our own police department would stoop to such levels.&nbsp; Or maybe I can.&nbsp; I would document anything and everything that happens, just in case. Have you ever contacted Vallone or Gioia about any of this?&nbsp; You would think with the current noise ordinance that Bloomberg put in place, it would be a non-issue.&nbsp; Instead you are being harassed and they are trying to intimidate you.&nbsp; It seems as if the police are in bed with the club, especially if they work there as off-duty officers.

				McDirk, that is pretty egregious behavior on the part of the club.&nbsp; Of course, that goes without saying.&nbsp; Is there any way you could get the local media involved?&nbsp; I guess that might be a naive suggestion.

				Thanks for the suggestions.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been thinking about trying to go the media route.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been talking with Vallone, Jr.s office and they&#039;ve been wonderful.&nbsp; Peter has written many letters and is the only reason they&#039;re not worse than they would be - but I think the problem lies with the 114th Precinct, and I think things are escalating, or about to.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t think I should have to fear for my personal safety or have a bouncer follow me across the street to try and intimidate me in a bodega.&nbsp; The jerks can ring my buzzer as much as they like - soon it will be disconnected and I won&#039;t be bothered by it.<br />I don&#039;t get why they aren&#039;t getting summonses re: the noise.&nbsp; It seems they are &quot;special&quot;.&nbsp; I live more than 400 feet away in a non-adjoining building but can hear them clearly and my building vibrates on occasion from the bass.&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine how bad it has to be inside the club or in the adjoining buildings.&nbsp; The clearly audible noise standard should have shut them down by now.&nbsp; <br />They don&#039;t have a cabaret license - so I don&#039;t know how they have dancing five nights a week, but they seem to live a charmed life.

				What about a serious written complaint to:<br /><br />New York State Liquor Authority <br />Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control:<br />317 Lenox Avenue <br />4th Floor<br />New York, NY 10027<br />Voice: (212) 961-8378<br />Fax: (212) 961-8283<br />enforcement@abc.state.ny.us<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t make any unsubstantiated charges, the facts as they are will speak for themselves. If you have any neighbors who would also like to be signatories on this letter, it would certainly help the cause.

				Video. If you don&#039;t got one already you need to start videotaping this stuff. maybe answer the door when they start buzzing, camera in hand.<br /><br />Right now it&#039;s basically your word against them it sounds like, you want to change those odds. especially if the bouncers are off duty police. Harassing you like that is a crime in and of itself. Get someone calling you a faggot on video and it&#039;s a hate crime. If it&#039;s an off duty cop in the act of doing that, I&#039;m sure IAB would love to see such a tape.&nbsp; &nbsp; Or f___ it, just go straight to the press with video like that. <br /><br />One thing seems clear, complaining to the 114 is a waste of time. <br /><br />a decibel meter and documenting the noise night after night might be a good idea too:<br />http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0007XH9PY/ref=nosim/?tag=dealtime-mi-20&amp;creative=380333&amp;creativeASIN=B0007XH9PY&amp;linkCode=asn<br /><br /><br /><br />bottom line: when it&#039;s just your word against theirs, no good. when you back it up with a lot of proof, it&#039;s harder to ignore. give the press, iab, elected officials, etc-&nbsp; something to run with and you might see better results.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Who watches the watchers indeed! :-o<br />You&#039;d think local channels like ny1,2,4,5,7,9,11 or even a prominent locally themed website like Gothamist.com would be interested in a little stakeout action to record and expose their late night noise, i would think people would tune in to see the old boy cops network operating above the law and callously in what is a great great neighborhood. It&#039;s a shame Mcdirk, I feel for you, but moreover feel for all of us when our grievances fall on deaf ears it is shameful on us all that we tolerate such shenanigans. Kinda makes you want get all &quot;Walking Tall in this beeyotch.<br /><br />(http://www.dailyinfo.co.uk/images/cinema/walking-tall.jpg)<br /><br /><br />sorry I couldn&#039;t find a good joe don baker image from the original movie from the 70&#039;s.<br /><br />

				&nbsp; The Queens North Patrol Borough Headquarters apparently has a Club Unit that is separate from the 114 Precinct.&nbsp; I see them around on weekend nights.&nbsp; Call 718 321-0346 and ask for the Club Enforcement Unit.
