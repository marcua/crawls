				i lol&#039;d.<br />accessible? that shoreline isn&#039;t even visible from any public place.<br />i wonder how much money has already been invested in the planning stage of this (non-existant) public land issue,<br />i&#039;d imagine pistilli charged a nice size retal fee for use in his building for an evening, lets hope it wasnt tax dollars.

				I do believe when they say &quot;waterfront&quot; they mean the grass and path that follows the shoreline and not the actual place where water meets land.&nbsp; If I ever drive down that stretch from 19th avenue, it looks fine to me.&nbsp; &nbsp;I say make Astoria Park closer too 100% before you start worrying about anything else.

				Just wanted to answer a few questions:<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the area we’re focusing on at Wed’s session—the northernmost section of Astoria waterfront, from roughly 20th ave to the airport- is almost all industrial and&nbsp; inaccessible to the public. The exceptions are a small marina and a few ballfields used by local sports leagues. <br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wednesday’s meeting is the first of six we’ll be holding&nbsp; in neighborhoods throughout Astoria/LIC. We’re asking the same questions at all six sessions and want to hear from as many people as possible. So, yes, questions like “Where do you go along the waterfront?” will likely elicit different answers from people who live along&nbsp; Upper Ditmars than from people who live near places like Hallets Cove or Hunters Point.&nbsp; Sorry for not making this clearer.<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Shores NYC is&nbsp; a local non-profit&nbsp; dedicated to improving the waterfront parks and shoreline in Astoria &amp; LIC .We’re entirely run and staffed by volunteers. We’re not part of any City agency.&nbsp; The Trust for Public Land is a national non-profit dedicated to preserving open space. <br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site used by the Long Island City Community Boathouse for free kayaking is Hallets Cove Beach,&nbsp; just north of Socrates Sculpture Park. We’re proud to count the LICCB as one of our member organizations and definitely recommend paddling with them on Sundays! <br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area along the waterfront&nbsp; just north of where Shore Blvd meets Ditmars is Ralph DeMarco Park.<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope this clears up some of the confusion.A lot of the activities we’ll be doing at the listening sessions involve looking closely at giant satellite image maps of the areas being discussed, so please come join us and tell us what you think!<br />
