				Hello fellow Astorians, <br />My name is Frankie and as you can tell by my username I am the manager at Tony’s Bicycles here in Astoria.&nbsp; Although I am a new member, I have browsed this site many times before and appreciate its significance and wealth of local information. I would like to make my first post count by announcing evening bicycle rides throughout Astoria, Manhattan, Queens and many other destinations throughout the cycling season.&nbsp; My goal is to organize as many riders as possible on a nightly basis to participate, meet locals and tour the city.&nbsp; After speaking to Meesh today at the FREEZEPEACH café, we have decided that the café will be the meeting point for these rides. All persons of different skill levels and tolerances are welcome to ride with us each evening. I, myself, will be riding with the group on a nightly basis, so no need to worry about being stuck on the road with a bike that needs repair- you will be riding with a seasoned mechanic!&nbsp; There is no sign-up requiremt for these rides due to the fact that we all lead busy lives there is also no commitment to ride. As the number of participants rise, different groups will be formed that will ride different distances and ride to different destinations if the demand is such.&nbsp; The rides will start at 8:15 each night and other times may be added once the whole event is sorted out. These rides will be great for training for upcoming centuries and the five borough tour. If you would like more information you can contact me at:<br />Tonysbicycles@yahoo.com<br />or<br />Contact: Frankie<br />Tony&#39;s Bicycles<br />3501 23rd avenue<br />Astoria, NY 11105<br /><br />I would like to thank you all for your interest in advance. I would also like to thank the founders of this forum for their contribution to the community.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Frankie and the staff at Tony&#39;s bicycles

				It might also be nice to know if any locals will be doing this years 5 Borough Tour event on May 7th, Sunday. We can ride the train in together....yes I am doing it this year. I almost wasn&#39;t as I did not appreciate the ridiculous wait in SI on Shore Road for the Ferries back to Manhattan. Apparently the City/MTA was unaware that there were literally 30K cyclists waiting hours for the ferries and had the boats on a Sunday schedule. Great. But a friend of mine wanted to go this year...so there you are....

				If anybody has any interest in trail riding, be sure to check out the following boards:<br /><br />www.climbonline.org -&gt; trail building/protection/maintenance and general advocacy<br /><br />www.nycmtb.com -&gt; the new group for NYC mountain bikers<br /><br />Last Saturday, there was a Cannondale Demo at Stillwell, where you could test ride some high-end mtb/road bikes for free. We then went to a bar that night and watched a couple of mountain bike movies, about as much fun as we could ask for in one day! The bar did loads of extra business, and CLIMB raised quite a bit of money for their cause.<br /><br />It would be nice to see a bike community develop out here, most of these things take place out on L.I.&nbsp; With Highbridge and Cunningham Parks now clear for building new trails, I&#39;m hoping to see more mtb closer to the city.<br /><br />Anyway, thanks Frank/Tony&#39;s/FreezePeach!!

				Thank you, Christine for your contribution to this thread. Please feel free to post any new cycling news or events in this thread. I may start organizing mountain bike trail rides later in the season for any interested enthusiasts. Please let me know if there is sufficient interest in a weekend trai riding program organized by the staff of Tony&#39;s Bicycles of Astoria! <br />Thanks!

				We mtb&#39;ers are a passionate bunch, and we&#39;re convinced that there&#39;s plenty more of us stuck in the city without cars to reach the trails. Frustrated, they either let their bikes collect dust or stick with the road (I get my fix by commuting on the mtb these days!)<br /><br />As the community becomes more unified, we can form carpools and such, become better organized and eventually convince NYC Parks to allow more trails (although it&#39;ll take years.)<br /><br />I&#39;ll stop by sometime after work this week and fill you in, maybe drop off some more newsletters if I have any left.<br /><br />There&#39;s a trip to Blue Mountain coming up on May 20th, check the websites for more info. It&#39;s an intermediate-level ride.
