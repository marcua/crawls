				My only comment, as someone who was not living in New York at the time of 9/11 or who knew anyone who was affected by it, is that I would like to see commemoration of the survivors as much as the victims.

				For me, personally, remembering the day is important.&nbsp; I won&#039;t get into the details, but the event fits deeply into an important life transition that was going on in my life at the time.&nbsp; The idea of turning the day into a day of service greatly appeals to me, too.&nbsp; How that service manifests could take a myriad of forms.<br /><br />Frappe, are you saying that we should pull back from recognizing the day and having a memorial service as we are today?

				911 changed the world as we knew it. 19 cowards, with religious zeal carried out an act of war against peaceful&nbsp; innocent civilians right here in my hometown.<br /><br />Heroism was brought out in so many - read about my dear departed friend Ronnie Bucca. Then tell me about over doing it. Better yet - go to the local firehouse and let them know your feelings - and see how well they are appreciated.

				I&#039;m also down for the day of service.&nbsp; I was also here on 9/11 (still a new transplant) and I remember wanting to do something, but not really being pointed towards anything by the powers that be at that time.&nbsp; In fact I seem to remember the best suggestion anyone in government came up with was to go out and shop.&nbsp; More Americans are volunteering or spending time in service now than ever before, and I think its time for our government to take that momentum and do something with it.&nbsp; Time had a neat cover article (http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1657799,00.html) about setting up National Service that had some really great ideas.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think we can or should continue treating 9/11 as a day of mourning forever, but I will say that some of the comments in that article of people that think we should get over it really pissed me off.&nbsp; Its great to know that somebody in Raleigh NC or wherever is ready to sweep all the dust under the rug, but I&#039;m not sure that everyone, particularly those of us that were here and the rescue workers who are still dealing with health and mental ramifications from 9/11 feel that way.&nbsp; I know I don&#039;t yet.

				I certainly agree that remembering the day is important (in my book, so is remembering the Boston Massacre, the Haymarket Riots and My Lai, days which would probably get by those who loudly mourn 9/11), I&#039;m just getting the feeling that it is starting to become too loud, too commercialized.&nbsp; Instead of a frank introspection of the day, it becomes an enforced sentimental whitewash, resulting in responses like BigBryan&#039;s (don&#039;t drop the firefighter bomb on me.&nbsp; I come from a family of nurses, cops and firefighters.&nbsp; I also have a brother in the naval reserve who won&#039;t see a cash payout if he buys it in the service of our country).<br /><br />Granted, I&#039;ll get my wish I suppose, because it will soon 9/11 will turn into a 12/7.&nbsp;

				Here&#039;s an article about turning the day into a day of charity.<br /><br />http://news.yahoo.com/s/csm/20070910/ts_csm/adogood<br /><br />I agree that we should always have some sort of commemoration or memorial service on that day.&nbsp; I like the idea of charity work, and making some good out of the tragedy.&nbsp; I do wish we could move on in other ways though, and I think we are.&nbsp; Each year, I couldn&#039;t turn on the tv because every program had to do with the mourning, or a replay of the footage showing the planes hitting the towers, the naming of the names, documentaries.&nbsp; While I agree there should be coverage of a service, I personally can&#039;t do 24 hours of it.&nbsp; It&#039;s not good for me, I can&#039;t deal with it, and the TV coverage forces you to constantly.&nbsp; So I turn the TV off.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was here that day, and it was awful.&nbsp; I can only lift my head up and move on.&nbsp; But I think TV coverage is trying to move on as well.&nbsp; It&#039;s been many years and I&#039;m glad the infighting has finally stopped and we are rebuilding.&nbsp; I hope New Orleans doesn&#039;t take this long to recover, there was an interesting news article about both tragedies the other day.&nbsp; We need to rebuild our cities.

				Nothing wrong with a moment of silence (well, two) each year, maybe re-run certain shows (like the documentary about how the WTC was built/analysis of how it was destroyed.) <br /><br />Other than that, I agree that enough is enough. It&#039;s difficult enough to get through the morning each year, remembering what it was like that day. Having something for the survivors.......I can&#039;t explain why but that idea doesn&#039;t agree with me at all.<br /><br />And charity work on this day- honestly, if you need an *excuse* to do charity work then just don&#039;t bother. Or wait &#039;til Christmastime like everybody else, sheesh.<br /><br />Sorry if I&#039;m sounding cranky but each individual should commemorate the day as they see fit. I tend to think about those who died pretty often throughout the year so I don&#039;t feel a need to act differently on the anniversary. There&#039;s plenty going on in/around the city in terms of public memorial ceremonies for those who would like to attend.

				I&#039;m personally tired of 9/11 being used so gratuitously by politicians to instill fear into the general populace.&nbsp; People in the middle of rural Iowa voting out of fear because of politicians using imagery of mysterious turban clad brown skinned people sneaking into their cozy little town with a dirty bomb because they &quot;hate freedom.&quot;<br /><br />Each day people so passively allow things like warrantless wire tapping and ending of habeas corpus to happen because of the constant reminders that there are &quot;evil men&quot; out to get us, to me, is a constant reminder that the goals of these terrorists that attacked us exactly 6 years ago today are succeeding.&nbsp; Those that are so willing to allow these principles to be shredded, talking ironically that the terrorists &quot;hate us because of our freedom,&quot; clearly need to take a good long look in the mirror.<br /><br />And each time I hear a politician get up on the stump today, or any other day to invoke 9/11, is a sad reminder we lack true leadership in this country from EITHER party, to ask us to sacrifice for what we supposedly are trying to protect.&nbsp; Freedom.&nbsp; 9/11 is a sad reminder to me of the completely and unforgivably wasted opportunity this country had to forge lasting bonds with the rest of the world when they were willing to reach out to us.&nbsp; I am hard pressed to imagine I will ever see such a display in the rest of my life.

				overdoing it? i dont know about that.<br /><br />it is very important to memorialize this day, lives lost, those who tried their best to save lives.<br /><br />many memorials that are out there are extremely sad. and i agree with another poster, i cannot sit and watch memorial after memorial on this day. no one can. <br /><br />is the media hyping everything? maybe. not everyone has the day off to participate in a memorial. watching or listening to a memorial on television or radio helps someone feel part of the ceremony without physically being there. and it may help someone grieve if they wish to do so. <br /><br />and, of course, the beauty of all of this is, that even though our country was attacked brutally 6 years ago, we still have the freedom to do whatever we want.&nbsp;

				Good god, these are NOT unanswered questions! Haven&#039;t you heard of Google?<br /><br />1. Silverstein purchased the towers just months before, and the huge amount of insurance is because the replacement costs of those buildings was so high. (As we&#039;ve since seen.) Coincidence.<br />2. There&#039;s one videotape of the Pentagon plane hitting the building, and plenty of wreckage was found. Note, most importantly, that the plane was NOT going 150 mph, like it was going to land, it was going 500 mph or so. The kinetic energy of moving objects increases with the <strong>square </strong>of the velocity! &lt;--- Read that again! This means that the plane had at least 10 times the energy of a plane at takeoff or landing, and thus was basically completely shredded when it hit the stone exterior of the Pentagon, and crumbled into the debris.<br />3. Same with the Pennsylvania plane. It was going a LOT faster than typical landing speed, and so its energy was vastly higher, and when it dove into the earth, it was completely shredded. <br />4. I&#039;m not sure how the speed of the cleanup had anything to do with anything...<br />5. There was no unexplained series of deaths among top scientists after 9/11.<br />6. Most likely the anthrax attacks were sent by a disgruntled American biotech worker. Who knows why. They&#039;ve never caught anyone.<br />7. #7 wasn&#039;t demolished, its stores of diesel fuel caught fire due to falling debris from the collapse of the other buildings, and basically softened the steel enough such that it fell on its own. Same mechanism that brought down #1 and #2. Thankfully it was empty.<br /><br />Annoyed that I stooped to a response to this bs...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=7847.msg92011#msg92011">Quote from: Christine on September 12, 2007, 12:59:02 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">A friend of mine brought over a movie last week called Loose Change, that outlined some strange coincidences that could point to a conspiracy (the fact that the towers were purchased months before with tens of BILLIONS of terrorist insurance on them, for example.)<br /><br />Here&#039;s a thread I started in our local bike forum: http://www.visionmtb.com/forumvb/showthread.php?t=12354<br /><br />Anyway, the general consensus is that the entire thing would&#039;ve been WAY too complex to have been a total conspiracy; however, the nagging questions remain:<br /><br />- Where are the videotapes of the &quot;plane&quot; that went into the Pentagon, or the physical evidence (wreckage) for that matter?<br />- Same with Flt. 93- why so little wreckage, when worse plane wrecks had plenty?<br />- Why the swift removal AND destruction of the WTC ,wreckage which was a massive crime scene at that point?

				Thank you Harlan - #4 - Speed of the cleanup - It actually took many many months - but obviously they wanted to recover body parts so the families could have closure. It was many month&#039;s after 911 that hey found Fire Marshall Ronnie Bucca&#039;s body. <br />I love a good conspiracy theory like anyone else, and I&#039;m practically an expert on the Kennedy shootings. But this garbage or fake moon landings I have no patience for.<br /><br />In case you don&#039;t know - Don&#039;t believe everything you read on the internet, and never use it as a sole source. :wink:

				I did look up a few things (being an insomniac) and wanted to edit my list.....but ran out of editing time&nbsp; :|<br /><br />Thank you, Harlan, for &quot;stooping&quot; (and I find it kinda comical that you suggest Google while Bryan cautions &quot;not to believe everything on the internet.&quot; )&nbsp; &nbsp;:lol:<br /><br />It&#039;s just that I&#039;m so jaded over this particular administration that this was a conspiracy theory I thought had some merit, and decided to go the &quot;what if?&quot; route. The filmmakers did strike me as a bit young and prone to exaggeration, and I knew that if the pieces weren&#039;t fitting together, there had to be a good reason for it.<br /><br />For the record, I don&#039;t buy any of the classic ones (JFK, men on moon, Princess Di etc.)&nbsp; :idiot: That&#039;s just crazy talk!! :wink:

				It would be crazy for, say, the British government to kill 3 people (Di, Dodi, and the Driver) but not for the current administration to kill 3000?<br /><br />Look, I dislike this administration just as much as the next decent liberal. I can go on and on about various reasons why. I don&#039;t feel they were elected, NCLB, all that! I just don&#039;t make the leap from that dislike to actually believing they&#039;d do something that awful. I seriously cannot understand the &quot;9/11 truth&quot; movement, or why people are so quick to accept it. I kind of resent the reasons I&#039;ve been told by tons of people. &quot;Well, Bush xyz. He&#039;s evil. He wants a totalitarian government and abc.&quot; As if somehow I can&#039;t hate... all actions and views held by the president, and still believe he, you know. Was honestly just reading a book about a pet goat and not doing anything more sinister.<br /><br />I had to sit through, seriously, at least half the class spouting this tripe in Social/Political Philosophy class <em>on</em> Tuesday. It was honestly one of the most offensive things I&#039;ve ever seen.

The 9/11 &quot;Truth&quot; conspiracy might read better than what really happened, but it&#039;s still garbage.

				To whomever said we should be focusing on surivors (just got home from work and little too lazy to reread the thread...&nbsp; :-) )<br /><br />THANK YOU!!!!!<br /><br />There were many, many people seriously injured in the attacks. Some permanently. These are the people who have to LIVE WITH WHAT HAPPENED IN THE MOST PAINFUL WAY EVERY DAY.<br /><br />And there are those who are emotionally affected by what happened, particularly those who were there and saw the horror unfold.<br /><br />The dead are no longer suffering for they are at peace. It&#039;s the living who should get our support. As much as our hearts can contain.<br /><br />Let&#039;s stop the death-worship over 9/11.
