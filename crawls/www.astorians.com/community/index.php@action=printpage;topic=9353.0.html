				I know what I&#039;d do if I had the time and the money (travel), but unfortunately I only have one right now and I found myself wondering what my fellow Astorians would do if they had more time, but no money. Anyone?

				Most museums have free days or nights - check websites - Also some museums you can donate minimumn like a dollar and go - Museum of NH is one.<br /><br />Bronx Zoo is free on Wed, I believe - double check that day. Libraries have books and movies to rent for free.<br /><br />The Staten Island Ferry is free - check out the Statute of Liberty w/o waiting on line.<br /><br />Parks are free - jog on the track - do the workout stations - ride a bike - roller blade - in summer the pool is open and free.<br /><br />Sat Afternoon 12N to 5 - free tour of Brooklyn Brewery - free beer. :lol:<br /><br />Many things to do - just a few off the top of my head - I bet people here have more - and if you did a search on it - you would find plenty

				Thanks everyone. To be clear I was just curious what YOU&#039;D do, not necessarily looking for suggestions, but thanks nonetheless.<br /><br />Me? I&#039;ve been looking into internships to enhance my skills and therefore become a more desirable candidate for a great job. I am learning to play piano, learning to knit, reading history, making over my home, visiting with friends and family, cooking elaborate meals, biking and enjoying time with my man. Oh! And dreaming about traveling. Sigh.

				I would want to go out and just explore the city, see the free museums, go exercise, or or do anything else, but, unfortunately, most of the time I have trouble motivating myself and I just sit on the couch and watch TV or sleep.<br /><br />I&#039;m workin on it, though.&nbsp; Baby steps...

				i&#039;d want to go to the city and do what everyone else has mentioned.&nbsp; i guess i&#039;d have to walk across the bridge to that.&nbsp; seeing that i didn&#039;t have any money to take the train.&nbsp; once off the bridge, i&#039;d probably make a right and go uptown and explore.&nbsp; i don&#039;t think i&#039;ve explored that part to much.&nbsp; and then i&#039;d back to the bridge walk home and sleep till i&#039;d have more energy to go explore downtown.&nbsp; :-)

				If you really want to travel, you don&#039;t need money to do it. I spent 4 1/2 months traveling on $2,000. You can make that if you really bust your buns for a couple of weeks and then just check out of this popsicle stand. It&#039;s completely possible if you want to do it.

				A person is alot richer when their deficiency lay with money rather than time.<br /><br />I&#039;m fully employed now, but my many, many years as under and unemployed were the best!&nbsp; Saw my friends all the time, drank homemade frappes and played tavli all the live long day.&nbsp; Knocked out alot of books, mooched off women* and was always cooking.&nbsp; Cherish this time.<br /><br />*Best time to date someone is when you are flat broke.&nbsp; You are not expected to produce anything extravagant, she is only interested in you and it allows the simplier things to be focused on.

				Time with no money? I&#039;ve already been there. Twice. It&#039;s called unemployment. No thanks!&nbsp; &nbsp;:wink: :-D<br /><br />But if it should happen, I hope it&#039;s in the summer. I was out of work Summer 2004 and it was a pretty good experience. Got to see a lot of the city (on foot), lost about 25 pounds (actually from exercise, not quite starvation&nbsp; :mrgreen: ), kept in regular touch w/ family and friends.

Scraping by and wanting to do so many things while trying to fight the I&#039;m-a-loser-depression at the same time. Most days are good. My bf works from home, so there is a lot of quality time and we&#039;re actually not getting sick of each other, so it&#039;s a good test being that we&#039;ve only been living together for 3 months. BUT he has a purpose to get up and sometimes I feel like staying under the covers, but then I realize that there are so many amazing things I could be doing (like all the afore mentioned on this thread). Life is good, but too bad it isn&#039;t summer like you mentioned. Sigh.<br /><br />Frappe, where on earth do you work to get 7 weeks PTO?!

				if it was warm enough, I would ride my bike all over the place, and explore NYC via my favorite mode of transportation.&nbsp; &nbsp;A few summers ago I would ride everywhere and I miss it.&nbsp; There&#039;s something totally cool about riding over a bridge, and happening to catch a Latin band practicing in an auto garage late at night, or riding by the water in Brooklyn or Queens with Manhattan all lit up.&nbsp; <br />This town + bikes = amazing
