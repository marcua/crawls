				Hello,<br /><br />so the rent on the room is $693.42.&nbsp; I know, an odd number.&nbsp; The deposit: $693.42.&nbsp; Utilties are usually around 20 - 25$ a month.&nbsp; <br />It&#39;s down near 21st Street and 24th Avenue, a block from Astoria Park and a couple blocks from the Triboro Bridge.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#39;m looking for a roommate who&#39;s willing to sign-on to the lease with me and split the deposit amount.&nbsp; <br />I&#39;m also looking for a roommate that might have some furniture like a kitchen table and couch and chairs.&nbsp; My soon to be former roommate is taking these core furnishings with her.&nbsp; <br />What&#39;s the incentive for my future roommate to do this? Well, you&#39;d get the larger of the two rooms in the apartment.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now, the room available is a nice size.&nbsp; I think it&#39;s roughly 10x12.&nbsp; &nbsp;I need to double check.&nbsp; But, I do know that you can fit a queen size bed, a large bookshelf, and a desk in it.&nbsp; The room also has&nbsp; a built in closet unit and 2 windows that look out onto the treetops of Astoria Park and the twinkling lights of the Triboro Bridge.<br />&nbsp; <br />The apartment is pretty basic looking except for one key and invigorating feature, the kitchen.&nbsp; The kitchen is the largest room in the apartment.&nbsp; It is amazingly large, so large in fact, that anytime a new visitor or guest stops by, their eyes get really wide, and they say, &quot;Wow!&nbsp; This kitchen is amazingly large!&quot;&nbsp; Also, there is lots of light and there&#39;s a great view of the Triboro Bridge from the living room.<br /><br />As for roommate qualifications, well, I&#39;m an actor, and it might be nice to find someone that&#39;s like-minded or in the arts, but really, all I care about is finding someone that is sane, clean, friendly, mellow, responsible, environmentally conscious, cooks, has lived with others, is okay with me subletting my room if I have to go out of town for a show, and is Catholic (just kidding about the Catholic bit).<br /><br />Questions, comments, interest:<br />Jason <br />jrwinfield@hotmail.com<br />415-509-6833
