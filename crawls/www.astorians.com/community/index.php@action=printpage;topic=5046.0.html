				I spent the entirety of Saturday working on a project indoors, so I didn&#39;t venture out of the building.<br /><br />This morning I wake up to the most distasteful signs scotch-taped to the hallway walls, with words to the effect -<br /><strong>&quot;Fellow Tennants - <br />Last night a homeless man slept in this lobby.<br />Please be careful, as the bacteria you take back with you to your room comes from this homeless person.&quot;</strong><br /><br />So this evening, I have affixed the following in two pages Arial Font 22 pt:<br />REBUTTAL - <br />What the hell are you thinking?<br /><br />On the coldest days of the year it upsets you<br />That someone took refuge in our lobby?<br />And your way of pointing this out is to tell us all to be wary of the bacteria<br />on our shoes from the homeless person?<br /><br />It is of such great importance to you<br />That this floor be bacteria-free?<br />Not likely, as this is New York; <br />you probably got worse bugs on the subway, so this is really not your concern.<br /><br />Let me break this to you - For all the boasting self-pride of Americans,<br />My fellow American, our government<br />Does nothing effective to help homeless people<br />The priority of a <em>compassionate</em> person would be that this person not die of exposure outside<br />Would it suit you if we found their lifeless body against the red velvet rope of Kabala Lounge just up the street? Or on the ground by Athens Live?<br /><br />For over two months we didn’t have a working doorknob<br />On the interior door of this “bug-infested” lobby<br />You likely didn’t say anything<br />And last summer when a neighbor was smoking pot in the lobby that was okay.<br />But you drag out your computer and keyboard<br />To show us your unhappy outrage<br />Critiquing someone who is frail and defenseless.<br /><br />NEIGHBOR, I worry most about the bacteria you spread.<br />The germ of hatred and intense paranoia you spew with your computer printer and your insincerity.&nbsp; YOU and your germs are what I worry about more.<br /><br />- Cannibal<br />More disappointed than angry.

				Thank you.<br /><br />Your story reminds me of an article I saw recently about the recent anti-homeless law enacted in Orlando.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />http://www.cfnews13.com/News/National/2007/2/3/orlando_homeless_laws_stir_heated_debate.html<br /><br />Makes you wonder whatever happened to compassion. Or programs of prevention rather than criminalization.

				Bravo!!<br /><br />It&#39;s very sad that there are people like that in this world, but I do believe in universal justice.&nbsp; In the long run that person will get hit with the same hate he/she throws out.<br />

				Many years ago, on my way to work, I found a lady sleeping next to a radiator in my building&#39;s lobby; she was in a fetal position clutching a filled pillowcase; it had to be 7 degrees outside. I bent down and gently woke her, handed her some money, told her to get something to eat, and then I gave her my business card with my home phone number written on the back and asked to to save enough of the money to call me after 6 in the evening. <br /><br />She did, and I asked her to come over. She took a shower while I washed and dried her belongings; she ate a nourishing hot dinner; we talked for hours and she spent the night on the sofabed. She was just like so many of us. One paycheck away from the streets. She had been downsized, unable to find anther job before her benefits ended, and had been evicted for nonpayment of rent. Her life&#39;s belongings were left on the street. She gave her cat to a neighbor. She had never been married and had no family.<br /><br />In the morning she left when I left for work. I gave her some more money and asked her to come back again in the evening. I figured once I got to know her better, and to trust her integrity, I could let her have a key and use my home as a base while she was able to keep clean and well-fed while she looked for a job. Her resume was in order and her credentials were quite nice.<br /><br />I never saw her or heard from her again. I cried to weeks. I searched the neighborhood every night looking for her. I repeatedly called the 114 asking if they had heard anything of her.<br /><br />That spring, on the corner of 41st Street and Third Avenue, on my way to work I passed a Vietnam era amputee on the corner. He smiled a hello, and I smiled back. He was there the next morning also. When I went to get my coffee, I bought an extra one, an egg sandwich and a pack of Marlboro&#39;s. As I walked past him, I handed him the bag. He whispered, G-d Bless You. I gave him breakfast every day and a pack of cigarettes every second day for over a decade. We never spoke. When I retired I asked a coworker to look out for him. The owner of the deli on that corner assumed responsibility for feeding him and my coworker bought him his cigarettes for another five years. <br /><br />I will always wonder what happened to the 2 encounters I had with these 2 people.<br /><br />There, but for the Grace of G-d, go I.

				The sad thing, like you said is that most of us are only a paycheck away from being homeless.<br /><br />Here&#39;s my story....<br /><br />Two years ago I was laid off.&nbsp; It was a good job and my x boss was generous with the bonuses and little by little I was able to payoff credit problems I had accumulated because of divorce and theft (my 2nd x husband turned out to be a con artist, I was wife #5 and he did the same thing he did to me to the prior 4 women).&nbsp; I was ALMOST THERE, one bonus away from paying off the rest of my credit (it was current but I didn&#39;t want to have anymore credit).&nbsp; At the time I only owed only $6,000.00 (Now it&#39;s $15,000 in consequence to that).&nbsp; That was my total debt, and I was only 6 months away from paying that off.&nbsp; Well that didn&#39;t happen.&nbsp; My boss did give me severance but you know that saying...when it rains it pours.<br /><br />Well...I had to move out of my current apartment due to a bed bug infestation, the whole building was infested because the landlords relatives came to visit from Bangladesh and brought them (landlord/owner said this).&nbsp; Unfortunately, because of the fact that it was a three family home it did not fall under the same category of a 6 unit building...it&#39;s really up to the landlord AND at the time there wasn&#39;t a bed bug epidemic in NYC so when I called the Health Department they couldn&#39;t help me.&nbsp; They said that because bed bugs do not carry disease there isn&#39;t a law/protection.<br /><br />I had to move out.<br /><br />Because of that, I had to spend most of my severance pay for a new apartment, new mattresses, new furniture.&nbsp; I lost EVERYTHING, clothes, name it.&nbsp; <br /><br />The sad thing is that at the time I did have a friend that I thought was close, that could have let me and my son stay at his place until I found a job.&nbsp; I wouldn&#39;t have had that expense, I wouldn&#39;t have had to pay rent until I found a job or worry about buying mattresses or furniture until I had a job.&nbsp; Because of the fact that I make over the limit, when I went to apply for foodstamps because I had no food and I had to feed my son...they only gave me $300.00 for three months to feed two people (my son was 10 at the time).<br /><br />I&#39;ll never forgive him for that because those three months would have been the difference between how I could have been and the situation I&#39;m in now.&nbsp; I wouldn&#39;t have touched that severance pay ($10,000.00).&nbsp; I wouldn&#39;t have had to dish out $3,200.00 for an apartment, $1,000.00 for mattresses.....anyways, I had to use my credit cards to make up for the difference, to buy food, cash advances for rent...$450.00 a week unemployment, with no help for food, rent still has to be paid, utility still has to be paid, I have to feed my son.&nbsp; Now I&#39;m so over extended that I have to file for Bankruptcy.....<br /><br />If I would not have found that job at that precise moment I would have been homeless.&nbsp; I would not have been able to pay the rent for the next month.<br /><br /><br />So NYCmacUser, you&#39;re a beautiful person for helping people that you didn&#39;t even know.&nbsp; <br />
