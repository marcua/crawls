				Great choices, but, for me... Hedy&nbsp; Lamarr, sexy and smart. Where&nbsp; can someone&nbsp; find such a woman, let&nbsp; alone&nbsp; a film star&nbsp; today who is&nbsp; even close.&nbsp; :-P<br /><br />An inventor&nbsp; as well.. what a lady. <br /><br />http://www.inventions.org/culture/female/lamarr.html <br /><br />(http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x96/FZ81/HedyLamarr.jpg)<br /><br /><br />Quotes<br /><br />“ Any girl can be glamorous. All you have to do is stand still and look stupid.”<br /><br />“ If you use your imagination, you can look at any actress and see her nude. I hope to make you use your imagination.”<br /><br />“ I must quit marrying men who feel inferior to me. Somewhere there must be a man who could be my husband and not feel inferior. I need a superior inferior man.”<br /><br />&quot;The world isn&#039;t getting any easier. With all these new inventions I believe that people are hurried more and pushed more... The hurried way is not the right way; you need time for everything - time to work, time to play, time to rest.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Perhaps my problem in marriage--and it is the problem of many women--was to want both intimacy and independence. It is a difficult line to walk, yet both needs are important to a marriage.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Hope and curiosity about the future seemed better than guarantees. That&#039;s the way I was. The unknown was always so attractive to me... and still is. &quot;<br /><br />
