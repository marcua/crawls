				We had our Astorians on MySpace thread but what about Astorians on Flickr? I know there is a Flickr group to post pictures of Astoria, but it would be nice to add some Flickr contacts from the &#39;hood.<br /><br />I&#39;ll start:&nbsp; http://flickr.com/photos/lizzyvegas/

				I was hesitant to do it, but I merged my accounts last night. Your name doesn&#39;t change and I couldn&#39;t really see many changes aside from now logging in with Yahoo. I guess it would be annoying if you didn&#39;t have a Yahoo account?!

				If you&#39;re looking for an alternative to Flickr, I use and am relatively happy with Zooomr (http://www.zooomr.com/). It uses OpenID (the same as Livejournal) and has not yet been bought out by a major web portal. :) It does a few things better than Flickr and a few things not as well...<br /><br />I took a series of slow-exposure shots of the N train at night recently that turned out fairly nicely... Here&#39;s the first one. Click on it to go to Zooomr and check out the portals to the other shots...<br /><br />(http://static.zooomr.com/images/681236_a4f752a3b3.jpg)<br />&nbsp;(http://beta.zooomr.com/photos/harlan/681236)<br /><br />

				Title: <strong>Flickr hacking?</strong><br />

				Have any of you heard about the hacking going on at Flickr? Wanted to know what you all thought about it.<br /><br />Here is some info:<br /><br /><em>Dear Flickr friends.<br /><br />During the last several weeks I have seen numerous friends stalked on flickr by a very determined hacker. Several of them had accounts hacked or spoofed and one even had a home computer broken into and files removed.<br /><br />One of my best friends quit flickr over this. I won&#039;t name her, but many of you know whom I&#039;m talking about. When she gathered information about the hacking, and tried to give this information to flickr, they blew her off. Several times. This scumbag is somehow involved in child pornography. I&#039;m not sure of the details, but my friend was scared enough that she quit flickr. It was a great loss to me, and I cannot even begin to imagine her pain and anger over this.<br /><br />This person is determined. Today, they posted a message to several hundred flickr people from a hacked account. This is being talked about at:<br />flickr.com/forums/help/34075/<br />flickr.com/forums/help/34219/<br />flickr.com/forums/help/34168/<br /><br /><br />This message said:<br /><br />(I have deleted the name of the person who was being harrassed)<br /><br />Hello,<br /><br />I Was just wondering, somebody told me you sell naked<br />images of XXXXXXXXXX (XXXXXX&#039;s<br />www.flickr.com/people/XXXXXXXXXXX/ ) daughter(s)<br />and that he has bought some off of you before. I Was just<br />wondering how much you charge, and do you accept paypal? If<br />not then what methods of payment do u accept? Thx and hope<br />to hear from u soon.<br /><br /><br />Enough. Flickr needs to act. They need to identify this person and have their attorneys assist the FBI on criminally prosecuting this person. This person is hurting friends that we care about.<br /><br />The only way I can think of to get Yahoo to take this seriously is either to shame them into it via a viral email/photo campaign and/or to attract the press.<br /><br />Please email flickr. Tell them that enough is enough.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />p.s.<br />PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COPY AND PASTE THIS AND POST IT IN YOUR STREAMS AND TO YOUR GROUPS <br />Comments</em>

				They&#039;re definitely having hacker issues right now, they seem to be the choice du jour for bored kids ... I happened to catch an example of this last week. I was logged in and noticed not only my, but all of my contacts&#039; pics had been randomly replaced by <em>other</em> pics ... For example, your cake pics JD? They had been replaced with a ... <em>err</em> ... different kind of after-dinner treat ...&nbsp; :-o <br /><br />It was rather disconcerting, but from what I could tell was sitewide and only lasted about an hour&nbsp; before the folks at flickr shut everything down. This is only one of the reasons I dislike the fact that they are now a Yahoo company ... I&#039;ve only ever had trouble with hackers and Yahoo, and the only reason I signed up with a Yahoo email address again was so I could use flickr.&nbsp; :|

				Did any of the Astorians on Flickr get a spam from a guy named &quot;Leb/Rami&quot;? It was a very weird spam emailing talking about some picture from a Saudi Bank commercial, asking for comments. I guess because I am writing about this now, I am promoting exactly what he wanted... traffic to his flickr page. I just though the whole thing was a bit weird and I didn&#039;t even realize he considered me a contact. I was wondering if any of you got hit with the same spam. Does this happen a lot on Flickr? I have been a member for over a year and I can&#039;t remember getting an email like this before.<br /><br />Here is the letter:<br /><br /><em>New Self Portrait (UAE Style)<br />&nbsp;Hi there my friend, I hope you will like this portrait of mine, I have taken it while I was casting for a Saudi Bank commercial (Second Commercial I cast in), I hope you will like it, if so please fav it, thanks for your kindness.<br />flickr.com/photos/leb2ashta/466532512/<br />Your friend,<br />Rami.</em>

				They&#039;ve been having problems with security at Flickr so be careful you are not being redirected to a fraudulent site, to gain access to your information.&nbsp; http://www.flickr.com/news.gne#sec_alert2

				More Flickr ridiculousness:<br />http://www.flickr.com/photos/malingering/<br /><br />I am not sure if you can access this or not if you aren&#039;t a contact of Malingering, but apparently she is getting restricted for pictures in her photo stream. I liked Flickr so much better 2 years ago. What&#039;s going on??

				Yahoo bought Flickr and it&#039;s becoming too, too sophisticated.&nbsp; It&#039;s just a matter of time before the ads start popping up when you sign in.&nbsp; How could they possibly resist marketing to all us photographers.
