				Yesterday, the Dutch won beautifully! Defeated Italy 3-0 <br />How sweet that was for the defending World Cup Divers to go down in their opening game!!&nbsp; :lol:<br /><br />Spain handled Russia properly 4-1 today. My favorite Gooner, Cesc Fabregas, scored.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Anybody watching the Spain-Russia game? Is it just me or does Spain look half asleep? And for the record I am a HUGE Italy supporter and I also didn&#039;t see the Italy-Spain match. Damned corned beef! I have to be since I am married to one.

				Ok well in the second half the Spanish monster came alive! I&#039;m happy for Spain, really. Now they just have to beat Germany, who haven&#039;t played that well in this championship. Well as well as they usually do.
