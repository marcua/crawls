				Pottery and ceramics can be a very diverse art, so please expand on your thoughts on what you are expecting to do at Freeze Peach.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t mind doing pottery myself, but I am more into throwing / wheel pottery and I can&#039;t imagine that FP would be able to host that kind of pottery class.

				i have carried my basic pottery tool kit with me on my past 3 cross-country moves and they&#039;ve sat patiently waiting here in NY for the last 5+ years -&nbsp; and I haven&#039;t used them since... 1998.... but haven&#039;t been able to part with them b/c I know that someday I will once again take a pottery class and use those tools (that i&#039;m sure I could have replaced for 20 bucks). <br /><br />But I certainly wouldn&#039;t want to use Freeze Peach as my classroom.&nbsp; I&#039;m need a BIG area to make&nbsp; a BIG mess. <br /><br />

				I have my pottery tools waiting patiently for me as well. :)<br /><br />I took a beginning pottery class down in Chinatown at a Jewish community center (I can&#039;t remember the name of it right off) around 3 years ago. The class was both hand-building and throwing. They had a bunch of different art classes, including several different ceramics classes. They were one of the cheapest in the city I could find as they didn&#039;t charge you per piece, but rather they had a studio fee that covered everything you made. I don&#039;t know if they still do that, though. My only complaint about them was that they were located in Chinatown, so every Saturday was a trek from Astoria down to the Lower East Side.<br /><br />Wasn&#039;t there a pottery place opening up in Long Island City?? Thought I heard about that one here on Astorians a while back...

				I like the idea of pottery but I&#039;d be more interested in other art classes (urm, stuff I&#039;ve already bought materials for) - drawing, pastel, mosaic, paper mache, watercolor, acrylic...
