				i still don&#39;t get why pistilli doesn&#39;t have websites for either of his developments... its like so 1985. Of course i did also hear from a few friends that went to a riverview open house that the man showing the apartments was assuring them that &quot;the prices are definetly going down&quot;. <br />

				Daisy and foodjunkie,<br /><br />What are your issues with coops? I have lived in coops pretty much all my life and never had a problem. <br /><br />If you want a place to live, I don&#39;t think there is anything wrong with a coop. In fact, I would rather live in a place that has a high owner occupancy and where people really get involved. On the other hand, if you want an investment property, or someplace you can rent out, I see your point. <br /><br />

				The number one reason coops don&#39;t appeal to me, probably boils down to privacy.&nbsp; I am very private with my life, both personal and financial, and I&#39;m just not into the idea of my neighbors knowing such personal details about my life.&nbsp; There is the notion that I don&#39;t want to have to seek approval of my neighbors to buy an apartment, to let someone move in, to renovate, to rent it out later on.&nbsp; &nbsp;I also want to own my apartment, as opposed to owning a share of a building.&nbsp; The maintenance fees are usually much higher on coops, making the monthly costs harder to handle, even after paying off the mortgage (especially since I&#39;d like a 2br).&nbsp; Although tax deductable, I would still have to pay those fees every month.&nbsp; I do plan to stay in the condo for a good number of years, but would like the option of renting it out, say if I got married and moved into a house.&nbsp; If I chose to sell, I&#39;d like the process of selling to be easier and without board approval or a flip-tax (not all coops have this).<br /><br />Those are most of my reasons, and I do think it&#39;s just a matter of personal preference.&nbsp; I&#39;m sure if I had to take a coop, I could make it work for me.&nbsp; But if given a choice, I&#39;d prefer a condo.<br /><br />But even better, I&#39;d love a house with space for a garden and a parking spot&nbsp; :)

				Hi, We want to own real estate too. My bf and I have been apt hunting for sometime and noticed there is a lot of new construction going up everywhere. It looks like a few of you are searching, so let&#39;s search together :-o There&#39;s a new condo construction being listed at 23-23 31st Ave. It looks really nice inside and out and the developer seems really nice as well. http://www.ardorny.com. I&#39;m working with Lex, Realtor at ArdorNY, very nice guy. Some apts have really nice views of manhattan and there are duplex apts with a terrace on each floor and the prices are not bad compared to other new condo properties... I think. Some apts do have small BDRs though, which I don&#39;t like. Has anyone checked this place out? We&#39;re definitely interested... Does anyone have any info we should know about?<br /><br />Thanks!

I do think the monthly cost ends up evening out b/c condos tend to be more expensive (also, the common charges for some of the condos in LIC are ridiculous),&nbsp; but yes, owning your apartment rather than a share in the building is a big difference, as is being able to rent out your apartment, and/or sell it, easily. <br /><br />In the end it really is a personal preference. and the most important thing is finding a place you are happy in. <br /><br />Good luck with your search!<br />

				The main reason we are weighing more towards a condo at the moment is as Daisy stated, privacy. We are private people as well (until you get to know us, know us and then the beans are all over the floor, lol) and we just do not like the idea of people knowing certain things about our lives in order to live somewhere. In addition we do understand that coop boards can be very beneficial towards occupants of the building if certain issues arise, however is that really worth them knowing things about us; that we would rather tell people on our own accord!?!? We are really in the early stages and are just looking, however if the right condo listing comes up, we are ready, willing and able to jump on it. Like Daisy, we would love a 2BR, however we may take a one bedroom if it is a good fit :? It is also hard as I have spoken with many different coop owners and everyone has a different take on it. One person I spoke with said that they were having break ins in their building and when it came down to it, it was an inside job and two people turned out to be on the coop board :oops: Another person I spoke with loves her coop, sold one in the same building to by another, another person said if you can get a condo, as when she went to sell her coop it took her almost a year to sell as the board would not approve anyone who wanted to buy, so it really is six of one half dozen of the other. Good luck everyone in their searches and maybe we can chat at some point about our experiences!?!?!

				Daisy,<br /><br />There is an unusual lack of marketing/websites.&nbsp; But the good news (for current owners in the area) is that these places seem to sell themselves before the last cement is poured.&nbsp; There is a lack of new, luxury condos in Astoria.&nbsp; When a building goes up, the units are snatched up in a hurry.&nbsp; Hence the ever rising prices.&nbsp; There are a few medium scale buildings going up on 30th Ave in the vicinity of 21st St.&nbsp; Perhaps signs will go up on the scaffolding soon.&nbsp; Astoria Windsor www.astoriawindsor.com is on 21st St. and 31st Ave.&nbsp; Cool looking bldg. but their website doesn&#39;t have sales info and no realtor seems to be representing it.&nbsp; The bldg looks close to finished though.&nbsp; &nbsp;If I were you, I&#39;d wait for the Pistilli property on Ditmars to open for sales.&nbsp; Not only is it a larger complex, but it will help to establish a new market rate pricing for the area (instead of the free for all happening now).&nbsp; The Riverview (21st and Astoria Park) is a coop - but more unsettling, they are required to convert to condo within 10 years.&nbsp; I don&#39;t care what anyone says - those owners are going to have a shocking expense when that time comes.&nbsp; There&#39;s also Hallet&#39;s Cove condos on Vernon around 31st Ave.&nbsp; I think a few units are still left.&nbsp; They plan to build a second building across the road.&nbsp; I also heard the Adirondack Furniture factory on Vernon is being converted to luxury loft condos.&nbsp; And there&#39;s the not-brand-new Shore Towers, which is undergoing a complete renovation of lobby, halls, etc.&nbsp; Prices at Shore Towers have risen substantially due to the prices being paid in LIC and nearby condos.&nbsp; No condo in Astoria is going to be cheap.&nbsp; But I think it&#39;s a sound investment.<br /><br />Last time I had a discussion like this I was accused of being a developer, etc.&nbsp; Not that it&#39;s anyone&#39;s business but I&#39;m just a resident and property owner - who likes the changes he&#39;s seeing.<br /><br />Daisy - we should all meet again at Hellgate on the Park one night.&nbsp; I recently quit smoking - after all this time!&nbsp; I&#39;ve been scared to have a drink that might trigger a cigarette - but pretty soon I&#39;ve got to get back out there!&nbsp; I never planned on quitting all kinds fun!&nbsp; Just the smoking.

				Yes, there will be commercial space on the ground level - no tenants have been finalized yet.&nbsp; <br /><br />Open houses will begin towards the middle of the summer.&nbsp; Prices can&#039;t be disclosed until final approvals from the Attorney General but they will be competitive with other developments in LIC / Astoria.<br /><br />I will post from time to time with updates.<br /><br />Thanks.<br />

				Truly?! I found it hard to translate some of the info in the (hand-drawn!) floor plans, but that is seriously bizarre. Did you see that first hand?

				That is so strange.&nbsp; The photos even show there is no door to the bathroom.&nbsp; The spiral staircase leads you to the master bedroom equipped with a tub.&nbsp; Where&#039;s the door?&nbsp; I wonder if the toilet at least has some privacy.

				the apartments seem small, but they have terraces! I&#039;d certainly be willing to go to an open house. <br /><br />And I don&#039;t think they&#039;ve been on the market that long.

Normal? It is to laugh. We basically have a choice between a walk-in closet and a vast sprawl. The price starts at around $250K [for the closet] and heads straight for the stratosphere. The building is either right next to a highway, toxins factory, or nuclear waste dump [make sure to double-check that the building isn&#039;t actually a renovated toxins factory or nuclear waste dump], or is a hike away from the nearest train station.<br /><br />I&#039;m not bitter, oh no.

				See this article about the conversion of the Adirondack Furniture factory building across the street from Costco.&nbsp; Sounds like the buyer loves the building and is planning to do a nice restoration as well as renovation.&nbsp; No time table is mentioned.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=18033544&amp;BRD=2731&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=574903&amp;rfi=6%5c
