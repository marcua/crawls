			I really like Manny from Neon Realty. He was really nice and did not pressure me or show me places that were a waste of time. Neon used to be on Broadway- they are now on 31st Street near 30th ave. <br /><br />I worked with Chantel at Aamen Realty years ago and did not like her at all. They were charging a month and a half commission when most of the other realtors were only charing one month and she showed me places that were completely out of my price range.

			I used Remax at Steinway and 34th - nice folks, saw a couple things that were out of my price range, but I liked them overall and found the perfect apartment for me.

I have been in for over 2 years now.&nbsp; Prior to using them, we went out with various realtors who were very pushy and acting like they were doing us a favor.

			I wholeheartedly recommend Kim at Halvatzis Realty (Ditmars, 28th/29th).&nbsp; Several other people recommended her to us, and we had a great experience with her- we found an incredible apartment in our price range very quickly (exact opposite of our experience in the Manhannat real estate market).<br /><br />bennyt
