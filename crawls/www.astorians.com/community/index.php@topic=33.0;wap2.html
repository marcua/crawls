			i just found out from kevin that you guys are running your cafe PC's on linux. &nbsp;I'm not a huge fan of linux on the desktop (servers, esp. colocated ones are more appropriate for unix imo) but it'd be interesting to hear how this is working out.

			The linux machines seem to be just as popular as our one Windows machine. I think that for browsing the net, and editing basic documents, Linux works just as well. We've had no complaints so far. People actually don't even seem to notice.
