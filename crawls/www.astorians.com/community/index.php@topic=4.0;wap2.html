			I wonder if Commerce Bank had it cut down because it was obstructing their sign. Maybe we should go in and ask them if they know why it was cut down.

			I thought for a while that maybe they were going to replant a tree there but it looks like its just gone by the wayside. Maybe I'll sneak out some night and plant one there. Anyone interested in helping out?

			..........There has been a problem with that Asian long horn beetle that is killing alot of Maples....sadly old ones. They supposedly got here from Tiwan inside wooden pallats. Only way to treat an infected tree is to cut it down and burn it.

			That's sad.<br /><br />So let's get over it and replant!!! Anyone have a suggestion. I say we pick a night and head down there with tree and shovel in hand and plant one. We can dress in all black and paint our faces.<br /><br />I know. We can buy some of those water guns that look real just in case someone tries to stop us we can scare them real bad with our fake guns.
