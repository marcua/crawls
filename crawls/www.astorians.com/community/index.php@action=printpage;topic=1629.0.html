				I went to eat at a new Japanese Restaurant on Ditmars near 37th Street yesterday and liked it a lot.&nbsp; It&#39;s small and cozy and casual.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t want to be adventurous with the sushi, so I had a small salad with grilled chicken and avocado with a nice sauce and they give you a cup of green tea for free with the meal.&nbsp; I went by myself and felt very comfortable there.&nbsp; I&#39;m definitely going back.&nbsp; I want to try the cooked salmon and also the soup looks good.&nbsp; &nbsp;:lol:

				The new Japanese place is great!<br /><br />I wanted to like the noodle place so bad, but the guy that runs the place is crazy.&nbsp; Their food was decent when they opened over a year ago, but it got progressively worse over time.&nbsp; I can&#39;t believe its still open.&nbsp;

				PS-&nbsp; What do you think will open next door, where the greek cafe used to be?&nbsp; I used to get dirty looks from the people that sat outside of that place during the warmer months, can&#39;t say I was sad to see it go.&nbsp;

(I think another Bank...) Seems they liked to play alot of backgammon and smoke smelly cigarettes. I guess they are hangin&#39; around the other pastry cafes.Smoking under the &quot;No Smoking&quot; signs. It&#39;s amazing.<br />&nbsp;Kumo, back on topic. Not bad. The sushi I got there one frigid night was fresh and good. The fake tree and river stone and marjon piece wall deco is......different. I just noticed a decided lack of smiles in there. The food was good though!

				I know what you mean about the lack of smiles.&nbsp; I felt the same way when I ate there.&nbsp; The service was good, but the people working there aren&#39;t very warm.
