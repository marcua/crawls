				Anyone watching this sci-fi series on ABC on Thursday nights?&nbsp; I&#039;m digging it so far, but am bummed there&#039;s no new episodes until March!&nbsp; WTF!!!&nbsp; This reminds me of what happened to Life on Mars, another sci-fi type series on TV last season.&nbsp; If I recall correctly, it too went on mid-season hiatus, and when it came back they shortly made the decision to cancel the show and the writers were forced to wrap it up pretty quick.&nbsp; Man...that was a great show.&nbsp; Anyway, hope FlashForward doesn&#039;t suffer the same fate!!!

				I started a thread on it when it first came on.&nbsp; I was enjoying the show, though I was so tired I&#039;d fall asleep and miss part of every episode, but they stopped rebroadcasing on Friday nights and I couldn&#039;t watch anymore.&nbsp; I need to get a Y cable to connect my laptop to my widescreen tv and watch the show online.

				I&#039;ve been watching this show every week and am really bummed that they are on hiatus until March.&nbsp; For some reason that seems to be the trend this year with &quot;Fall Finales&quot;.&nbsp; &quot;Glee&quot;, &quot;V&quot; and now &quot;FlashForward&quot; are now taking multi-month breaks.

				I missed it last night, and didn&#039;t realize it&#039;s going on hiatus.&nbsp; To be honest, I only just like the show.&nbsp; I don&#039;t love it.&nbsp; The jury&#039;s still out for me.&nbsp; I&#039;m already finding myself getting mad at the characters for their actions, and I find it hard to follow.&nbsp; It just does not hold the same appeal for me that Lost does.&nbsp; I am very excited that Lost is starting soon though.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Vampire Diaries and think it&#039;s one of the best shows on television right now.&nbsp; I think people dismiss it as a teen show, when it&#039;s just as good as Buffy was, but much scarier, unpredictable, but not as campy.&nbsp; Way better than yawnful Twilight.

				I like the show as well, but to be honest I was super excited to check it out because of Jospeh Fiennes.&nbsp; I love him!&nbsp; &nbsp;The show hasn&#039;t completely captivated me, but I am looking forward to having a little FF mini marathon (we have a bunch of eps sitting on our DVR). <br /><br />Also, I checked out Vampire Diaries.&nbsp; I found the pilot ep. a bit hokey, but I think I&#039;ll give it another try during this hiatus, or the summer hiatus.

				I liked it at first, and now that I&#039;ve watched it throughout the season (Hulu FTW!), I am loving it!&nbsp; Sorry to hear they are taking an extended break, though.
