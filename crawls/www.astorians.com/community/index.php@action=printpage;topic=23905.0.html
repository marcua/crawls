				Anyone with a child in District 30 should attend this meeting.&nbsp; We need to band together to improve our schools.&nbsp; Of particular concern to many of us is the issue of recess.&nbsp; Inadequate adult/child ratios, lack of indoor space for physical activity, the showing of videos, etc.<br />&nbsp;<br />I learned today that my daughter&#039;s school in particular has lost their temporary lunch aide so the supervision is woefully inadequate. <br />&nbsp;<br />We will also be asking for additional G&amp;T seats to be created to accomodate all the eligible students in our district.<br />&nbsp;<br />Hope you can make it!

				Unfortunately this applies to several schools in our district.&nbsp; My understanding is that there is currently a hiring freeze in place, so even if a school has the budget, they are not allowed to hire additional school aides, safety officers, etc.&nbsp; At PS 150, our wonderful and much needed crossing guard is out because of an injury, yet she has not been replaced.&nbsp; &nbsp;We had a temporary aide helping with lunch, but the aide has accepted a permanent position elsewhere (completely understandable).<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;
