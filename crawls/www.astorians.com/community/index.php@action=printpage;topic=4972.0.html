It is important to note that research is ongoing with DCA, and not everyone is convinced it will turn out to be a miracle drug. There have been many therapies that were promising in vitro and in animal models that did not work for one reason or another in humans. To provide false hope is not our intention. There is a lot of information on DCA available on the web, and this column is but one opinion on the topic. We hope you will do your own research into the situation. So, we have added links to resources at the end of this column. If you are arriving here form a linking website like Fark, then those links will not appear because they tend to grab only the text.<br /><br />END NOTE<br /><br />Scientists may have cured cancer last week.<br /><br />Yep.<br /><br />So, why haven&#39;t the media picked up on it?<br /><br />Here&#39;s the deal. Researchers at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada found a cheap and easy to produce drug that kills almost all cancers. The drug is dichloroacetate, and since it is already used to treat metabolic disorders, we know it should be no problem to use it for other purposes.<br /><br />Doesn&#39;t this sound like the kind of news you see on the front page of every paper?<br /><br />The drug also has no patent, which means it could be produced for bargain basement prices in comparison to what drug companies research and develop.<br /><br />Scientists tested DCA on human cells cultured outside the body where it killed lung, breast and brain cancer cells, but left healthy cells alone. Rats plump with tumors shrank when they were fed water supplemented with DCA.<br /><br />Again, this seems like it should be at the top of the nightly news, right?<br /><br />Cancer cells don&#39;t use the little power stations found in most human cells - the mitochondria. Instead, they use glycolysis, which is less effective and more wasteful.<br /><br />Doctors have long believed the reason for this is because the mitochondria were damaged somehow. But, it turns out the mitochondria were just dormant, and DCA starts them back up again.<br /><br />The side effect of this is it also reactivates a process called apoptosis. You see, mitochondria contain an all-too-important self-destruct button that can&#39;t be pressed in cancer cells. Without it, tumors grow larger as cells refuse to be extinguished. Fully functioning mitochondria, thanks to DCA, can once again die.<br /><br />With glycolysis turned off, the body produces less lactic acid, so the bad tissue around cancer cells doesn&#39;t break down and seed new tumors.<br /><br />Here&#39;s the big catch. Pharmaceutical companies probably won&#39;t invest in research into DCA because they won&#39;t profit from it. It&#39;s easy to make, unpatented and could be added to drinking water. Imagine, Gatorade with cancer control.<br /><br />So, the groundwork will have to be done at universities and independently funded laboratories. But, how are they supposed to drum up support if the media aren&#39;t even talking about it?<br /><br />All I can do is write this and hope Google News picks it up. In the meantime, tell everyone you know and do your own research.<br /><br />PLEASE READ THE EDITOR&#39;S NOTE AT THE TOP OF THIS COLUMN, AND PLEASE CLICK ON THE LINKS TO OTHER DCA RESOURCES LISTED DIRECTLY UNDER THIS COLUMN.<br /><br />This is a column of opinion written by Printz Executive Editor David McRaney.

				Thanks for the post. I want to find more information on this to fully develop an opinion about it from a valid source...if it is the case though....I don&#39;t even know what to say.

				If you go to the source listed at the top of my original post, there are further external links to information about DCA. <br /><br />Please spread the word, even if this is still in the early developmental stages, I&#39;m sure pharmecuticals in the US will never pick this up as we&#39;re (the pass populous) more profitable to keep&nbsp; alive, sick, and dependant on medicine than curing our diseases.

				Careful... There are any number of compounds that kill cancer cells in test tubes or mice, but aren&#39;t useable in humans. Chemo drugs kill cancer cells just fine in the test tube, but they also kill the lining of your GI tract, your hair follicles, etc. Those drugs that stop blood-vessel growth (antiangiogenesis, I think?) looked great in tests on animals about 5 years, and got a lot of press, but you&#39;ll notice that you&#39;re not seeing cancer cured now. <br /><br />This is an interesting new approach, and undoubtably there will be further study, but the article seems a bit hyped. Also note the side effects listed on the Wikipedia entry (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichloroacetic_acid):<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Although dichloroacetate &quot;has actually been used safely in humans for decades&quot;[7] its therapeutic use can cause pain, numbness and gait disturbances in some patients.[8] A clinical trial where DCA was given to patients of MELAS (a form of genetically inherited lactic acidosis) at 25 mg/kg/day indicated peripheral nerve toxicity.[10]</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Also, note that even if drug companies have little incentive to do the trials, the NIH and NCI can fund them.<br /><br />

				I work for the pharma industry and if this works and is safe, they will figure out a way to create a delivery system, or something, that can be patented. They&#39;re not stupid. I&#39;m reading the articles posted and am really intrigued but ths stuff. As was pointed out above, the NIH/cancer advocacy groups will also pounce on any treatment that works. <br /><br />But yes, lots of things work in vitro and in rats but don&#39;t work in people OR kills more than saves (Google Pfizer and heart disease and Phase III clinical trials for the latest big drug that got scuttled). <br />

				Oy Vey! Yet another miracle drug! First of all dichloroacetate has been studied and reviewed for the past 30+ years in every literate country in the world. Most recently, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) did an 8 year clinical trial titled Dichloroacetate Kinetics, Metabolism and Toxicology that ended without any serious conclusions in 2002. <br /><br />Secondly, I get so frustrated when the whole world dumps on the pharmaceutical manufacturers. Our life span has been increased by 10%–22% in just a few decades because of the new innovative drugs and surgical procedures that keep us either free from catastrophic disease or cure us. I use an awful lot of medications to control my physical disability. Almost all of them were not around some 10–15 years ago. Sure they are expensive. But, even though I complain bitterly at times about the cost, I recognize that if a pharmaceutical manufacturer spends $20B to come up with a drug to help people either resume or simply live normal lives, then they are entitled to recoup their expenses and make a reasonable profit from their investment into the health of the world.<br /><br />If the scientific research at this Canadian facility had been done in accordance with accepted practice, the press would have jumped on such a story. <br /><br />Every year we make small inroads to finding cures for all types of cancers and many other aggressive diseases. <br /><br />When I was a little girl, people died of natural causes—READ: old age—in their late 50s early 60s. Look at today. We have people living well into their 80s and 90s. I personally have great faith in medical science . . . it&#39;s the doctors I hate!
