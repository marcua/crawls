				the header in the craig&#039;s list ad says 490.&nbsp; you can get a new tv these days for that, same size and better brand.&nbsp; <br /><br />sorry aspen77 but you posted this same ad a while ago and it didn&#039;t sell.&nbsp; i think that if you really want to sell it you need to lower the price.&nbsp;

				Do the 37&quot; TVs for $490 feature PIP and 8 video inputs with VGA? I&#039;ve seen some cheap models out there, but they seemed to be lacking in capability. I&#039;ve dropped the price down from $600, and I&#039;m hard pressed to drop again, especially because I have gotten some potential interest. We&#039;ll see what happens. May not sell.

				J&amp;R has a 37&quot; Panasonic on their site for $479.&nbsp; The thing that sucks about LCD TV&#039;s is that they love value really quickly - especially the 720p models since newer and better technology is out there now, even just two years later.<br /><br />I just upgraded to a 40&quot; LED-LCD Aquos a couple of weeks ago and was able to sell my three year old 26&quot; 720p Aquos in less than 24 hours on here because it was priced right. <br /><br />I know you are just trying to get a return on your initial investment and hope you succeed.<br /><br />

				Does the Panasonic have 8 video inputs with VGA? One nice thing about the ViewSonic is that, unlike many HDTVs, it does a great job at standard definition video as well as high definition.

				Ya, I mean if you&#039;re someone who has a use for additional video inputs and wants the ability to use the TV as a computer monitor, and cares about standard definition images, then it&#039;s a good deal. On the other hand, if you&#039;re just looking for an inexpensive 37&quot; HDTV then you&#039;re right, you can certainly do better buying a new one, so this isn&#039;t the TV for you.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you&#039;re not interested, or you think it&#039;s a bad deal, then don&#039;t buy it.<br />If you are interested: drop me an email! :)

				The new one is pretty freaking awesome, thanks!&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t disappointed about only making 20% of my initial investment as I knew it would depreciate greatly from when I bought it three years ago.&nbsp; Plus, the person I sold it to is a friend from here so I was happy that it was going to a good home (because it was kind of like a pet to me.&nbsp; *grin*)
