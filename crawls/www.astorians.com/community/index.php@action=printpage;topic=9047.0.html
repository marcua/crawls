				So Saturday night I was at Sunswick with some friends enjoying the incredible selection of fine beers Sunswick offers, and, as is usual when I leave a bar after drinking delicious beers, I found myself in search of a pizza.&nbsp; Unfortunately, for me, I made my way all the way up Steinway, and then all the way down 30th, past the Taco Truck, before I found an open pizzeria.&nbsp; Now mind you, after this search, I did procure a large pizza pie, and walked it back to 44th st, but are there any closer pizzerias that are open late?&nbsp; My normal pizza places all close around 11 or 12, even on the weekends, and sometimes I need that late night pie.&nbsp; <br />Any help would be appreciated.

				It&#039;s funny you mention boston pizza, as I was with two friends after the Giants lost to the Pats, and one of my friends said, &quot;I don&#039;t care where we get pizza from, but it&#039;s sure as hell not going to be any place called Boston Pizza tonight.&quot;<br />But I think that you&#039;re right, the only places that are open late are by the N/W.&nbsp; And yep, 44th btwn 30 and 31st aves.

				I don&#039;t really favor pizza chains, but isn&#039;t there a Papa John&#039;s that recently opened on 30th Avenue around 48th or 49th Street?&nbsp; They tend to deliver late.

				why was this whole thread negative nodded?&nbsp; Is it because I refuse to just settle for El Rey Del Tacos or the late night gyro guy when I want a pizza?&nbsp; Is it because I&#039;m missing the obvious?&nbsp; Is it the most clever subliminal advertising ever undertaken by Papa John&#039;s?&nbsp; Oh the humanity?!??!!<br /><br />(http://images.jupiterimages.com/common/detail/82/17/23211782.jpg)

				maybe someone who hates pizza came through and neg nodded everyone.&nbsp; that person should be tarred and feathered.&nbsp; what kind of human hates pizza?<br /><br />and for the record, i don&#039;t think astoria pizza ever closes (30th ave btwn 31 and 32nd street).&nbsp; i woke up once at 4 or 5 am because i was having a nightmare and decided to go for a walk.&nbsp; and they were open so i got some pizza.&nbsp; obviously, i felt better.
