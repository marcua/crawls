				I bet she livens it up considerably. <br /><br />Rosie never bothered me (not that I&#039;ve watched the show in the past year or so.)<br /><br />I can&#039;t stand the young blonde Mrs. Quarterback. What a twit. But I suppose she serves a purpose- representing the point of view of young blonde twits.<br /><br />Meredith was the one I could relate to the most. Even-keeled and nerdy.

				And since Ms. Barr has already admitted to a case of multiple personalities, she could have all the knock-down, drag out arguments <em>with herself</em>, thereby saving ABC the salary of the blonde bozo who&#039;s going off on maternity leave to calve a Republican!

				Hey PizzaTheHut,<br /><br />&quot;Where is the male representation?!?!&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m going to assume you&#039;re being sarcastic, right?&nbsp; Just in case you seriously believe the show is missing a male voice, the whole idea behind The View is to showcase the different &quot;views&quot; of a variety of women (which is why they keep the dumb blonde girl around).&nbsp; It&#039;s not sexist, it&#039;s the concept of the show.

				I figured it was sarcasm...and did you know, there was a show called &quot;The Other Half&quot; led by Danny Bonaduce that was supposed to be the male equivalent of The View.&nbsp; Quality male representation at it&#039;s finest!
