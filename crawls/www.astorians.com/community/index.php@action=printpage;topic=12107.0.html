				Yeah, Summer Glau drew me to this one too. Terminator 2 is one of my all-time favorite movies, but I didn&#039;t care for the first one and I didn&#039;t see the third one. The couple episodes I caught of the Sarah Connor Chronicles were pretty good (I especially liked the ballet episode), so I&#039;ll watch the new season.

				I couldn&#039;t get home in time to watch the season premiere, so I hope Fox will have it streaming online before next Monday.&nbsp; Though watching TV on a computer (with crappy contrast ratio and no surround sound&nbsp; :-( ) is not fun, at least I&#039;ll get to catch up.

				I&#039;ll have to disagree.&nbsp; I was pretty wowed by the season opener, even watching on computer.&nbsp; It was more like a 45-minute feature film than a weekly TV show.&nbsp; John Connor&#039;s growing independence and Sarah&#039;s inflexibility may be harbingers of change....

				Was there a new one this week? Our DVR crapped out on Tuesday. :( I agree that it has been really good lately. It&#039;s one of the only shows I watch that I feel hasn&#039;t gotten tired yet, although the Brian Austin Green character and his subplots are boring.
