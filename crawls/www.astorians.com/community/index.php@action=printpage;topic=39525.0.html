				<br />As an Astorian whose apartment looks out towards Rikers, I am sickened knowing of what goes on there, and just a stone&#039;s throw away.&nbsp; That&#039;s why I feel compelled to participate in this Saturday&#039;s rally.&nbsp; The fact that so many Mentally Ill people are &#039;managed&#039; by...throwing them into prison??&nbsp; ....is just unconscionable... not to mention the number of other people who are simply held at Rikers indefinitely pre-trial, and who are often eventually not charged and let go but then...it&#039;s too late...the damage to them is already done.&nbsp; <br /><br />As was the case with Kalief Browder, whose brother is one of the speakers who&#039;ll be at the rally...<br /><br />http://www.closerikers.org/media/press/a-growing-number-of-elected-officials-and-a-coalition-of-representatives-from-98-advocacy-groups-march-to-demand-mayor-de-blasio-close-rikers-island-jail-complex/<br /><br />

				How about we march in support of all the Correction officers who are constantly assaulted by inmates instead?

				<br />1) One has nothing to do with the other.&nbsp; Corrections officers being assaulted does not change fact that many prisoners are mistreated &#039;simply because&#039;.&nbsp; Corrections officers being assaulted does not change fact that many are unjustly held at Rikers for far longer than they should be.&nbsp; It does not change fact that the mentally-ill have NO place being thrown into prison as a way of &#039;managing&#039; their illness.<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BkPRtkEXg4<br /><br />2) % of corrections officers being assaulted at any given prison is in DIRECT correlation to how those prisoners are treated.

				&nbsp;Yep,everyone at Rikers is there unjustly,treated unfairly, and completely innocent. I happen to have a bridge for sale if you are interested.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;Are there horror stories? Yes. Do I shed a tear for 99% of Gen Pop at Rikers? Not a chance. For their victims perhaps,but not for them. Certainly not going to march on their behalf, thats insulting to those they have harmed.

				<br />So according to you, 99% of those at Rikers deserve to be there.&nbsp; And not only that, but they &#039;deserve&#039; to be there for the inordinate lengths of time that some of them are there, simply waiting to be officially charged with a crime.&nbsp; Do I have that right?<br /><br />What about the 40% who are there with a mental illness...a mental illness that they cannot control?<br /><br />Guess that blows your &#039;99% deserve to be there statement&#039; out of the water, now doesn&#039;t it?<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/nyregion/for-mentally-ill-inmates-at-rikers-a-cycle-of-jail-and-hospitals.html (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/nyregion/for-mentally-ill-inmates-at-rikers-a-cycle-of-jail-and-hospitals.html)<br />

				<br />1) NY Post story.&nbsp; Thanks for sharing a story from such a reputable tabloid....I mean, &#039;newspaper&#039;...such as the Post.&nbsp; I guess I was all wrong.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; And btw, that story was not about inmates at Rikers being pampered, but a Manhattan prison.<br /><br />2) Riots at Rikers.&nbsp; Treat people like animals and they will act like animals.&nbsp; Prisoners&#039; behaviors in prison is in DIRECT correlation to how they are treated.&nbsp; Those prisons in the world that treat their prisoners the worst....where the prisons are overcrowded, where the CO&#039;s abuse their power...those are the prisons that will have the most riots.&nbsp; <br /><br />There&#039;s a reason why a certain type of person gets a job as a CO...as a bounty hunter...and it ain&#039;t because they want to &#039;help society&#039;.&nbsp; It&#039;s because they are on a power trip and want to kick some ass.&nbsp; For others who aren&#039;t necessarily assholes, they take these jobs because they are uneducated and have few other job options.&nbsp; Once they get in there, they are screwed, as they either must look the other way, bow down to the &#039;tough guys&#039; in the bunch (all to save their own skin/jobs), or else they themselves become hardened, and one of the &#039;tough guys&#039;.<br /><br />But hey....let&#039;s just keep doing it the way we&#039;ve been doing it.&nbsp; The US of A has such a great record of success in &#039;rehabilitating&#039; its prison population.... the LARGEST PRISON POPULATION as a percentage of the overall population, of any country in the &#039;developed&#039; world.&nbsp; The US of A is then followed in order by China, Russia, Brazil, India, Thailand, Mexico, Iran, Turkey, etc.&nbsp; What great company we&#039;re in, eh?
