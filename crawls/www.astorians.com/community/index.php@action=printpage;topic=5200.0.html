				Unfortunately, I didn&#039;t...&nbsp; &nbsp;:-(&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t know, I&#039;m hoping in the Fall, maybe all the Ultimate Frisbee players will want to turn into soccer geeks! I hear they&#039;re looking for a few good women, to play, that is.

				If you ever hold a soccer clinic for women who are nearing 50, please let us know.&nbsp; I think it would be a great way to get exercise and acquire skills.&nbsp; I currently run about 3 miles a day (slowly) and lift weights but soccer seems like such a great team sport!

				I just signed up for this: http://www.zogsports.org/Soccer/Queens%20Soccer.htm<br /><br />I don&#039;t know too much about it and I haven&#039;t played soccer in about 10 years, but it looks like fun.

				oh, we (another young woman and i) were just talking about how fun it would be to play soccer.&nbsp; i see this topic is a bit dated, but maybe if there are a handful of people interested... we could set something up.<br /><br />i am unexperienced, but i don&#039;t see why, if it&#039;s all just for fun, it can&#039;t be coed.<br /><br />thoughts/feelings? :mrgreen:

				I had a friend who did Zog sports and another league in NJ and elsewhere and Zog is great if you&#039;re willing to go traipsing around the city, Queens, Brooklyn,&nbsp; Bronx to meet with other teams to play. I am lazy and would like to play soccer locally. It takes me 20 minutes just to get to Astoria park from where I live, so that in itself will be a commitment, I&#039;d be eager to play something not killer competitive (ahem, frisbee players!) and have fun running around. I used to play on a team in high-school so I&#039;m sure I&#039;ve lost a lot of my skills and don&#039;t remember half the rules. If anyone is interested in getting a group going on the weekends (preferably in the mornings before 12) I&#039;d be down for that. Coed is cool if the guys don&#039;t behave like a bunch of morons and have to hog the ball. :&nbsp; )

				Lobber pretty much covered all bases with our Queens league. Games will be held once a week in Elmhurst. The schedules have not been made yet as the registration is still open. <br /><br />Don&#039;t worry about your level of skill, the league is made to have fun while raising money for charity. Plus, your team can head to organized happy hours after the games (where part of your check goes to charity). Its a really fun way to break up the week.<br />
