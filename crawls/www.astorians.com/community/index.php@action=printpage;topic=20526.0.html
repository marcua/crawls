				I was reading an article about who is running for Mayor in 2013, and it made me think about what happens when Peter Vallone is term-limited out in 2013.&nbsp; Any ideas of who&#039;s out there to run for his seat?&nbsp; 20 months will go faster than we all think!

				I think local activist/District Leader Costa Constantinides would be the front runner for the council seat. I see him everywhere. He&#039;s been in the local paper many times, including the rally to have a speed bump put on 21st Ave. He&#039;s also involved heavily in many civics in Astoria, such as being Vice President of the Long Island City-Astoria Alliance. He served as chair of the Coalition for a Better Astoria, which helped stop Fed Ex from moving their trucking facility into Astoria. He is also the President of the Queens County Young Democrats. Costa has fought to advocate for issues such as marriage equality and responsible development. Someone who is this involved must be the front runner for the Council seat!

				Lots more to do, and the Mayas.<br /><br />Obama will win NY again and very likely will win re-election.<br />What grade would you give him thus far?<br /><br /><br />http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/subjects/politifacts-top-promises/<br /><br /><br />Also I would be curious what kind of Council speaker Costa would like to see.

				Quote: &quot;Obama will win NY again and very likely will win re-election.<br />What grade would you give him thus far?&quot;<br /><br />No. 422 - Create new financial regulations: Promise kept?! Wow, that must be the Bizarro World Obama. The Financial Reform Act of 2010 is an even bigger joke than the Health Care Bill. It does nothing to reenact the key aspects of the Glass Steagall Act, therefore reneging the entire concept of reform. It still allows banks to act like casinos, and does not address the too big to fail problem. If anything banks have gotten even bigger these last 2 years.<br /><br />Obama may be better than Bush in most respects, but he has furthered the Bush agenda more than even what I feared McCain would have done. Sadly Obama proved himself to be a corporatist not a populist. Most informed people who will vote for Obama in 2012 will do so because the alternative is worse, not because Obama is doing what he campaigned on. <br /><br />New campaign slogan for 2012: Obama; I may be lousy, but the other guy is worse.
