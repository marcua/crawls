				Aside from all the candidate&#039;s campaigning on the WWF, which makes me want to vote for nobody, I heard about this:<br /><br />http://video.nbc10.com/player/?id=239889<br /><br />When it first happened.&nbsp; I went back and found the video today, because we were joking about it in the office.&nbsp; That shot she does.&nbsp; Crown Royal.&nbsp; Crown Royal is a Canadian whiskey.&nbsp; How dare she drink a Canadian whiskey with so many fine American whiskeys being distilled.

				I&#039;m saying if you&#039;re trying to become the president of the United States of America, order a Makers or Jim Beam or even Jack.&nbsp; She clearly doesn&#039;t care about her image.<br />I eat, drink, and wear all sorts of stuff from other countries, but I&#039;m not trying to look like a blue collar American, and then drinking a Canadian blended &quot;whisky&quot;.

				Well, by that logic, the majority of candidates and politicians don&#039;t qualify to be there.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure the majority of all their food, clothing, appliances, toys, trinkets, and drink, etc. etc. etc. is imported from other countries.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just how much is really made in America?&nbsp; We outsource everything here.&nbsp; At least she (and Barack) are&nbsp; campaigning to end those lovely tax breaks companies get to do so.&nbsp; I had assumed you were making fun of the way she did the shot, which is just a sip.&nbsp; I gotta say I wouldn&#039;t do a whiskey shot well either.&nbsp; But shots were never my thing :)<br /><br />

				I understand that it is all in good fun.<br />I see Kid&#039;s point about candidates pretending at being something they are not.<br />That&#039;s just a game.

(cars, that is.)<br />Maybe a hybrid with great cup holders.<br /><br /><br />Thanks Daisy for bringing issue positions into this.&nbsp; &nbsp;:wink:<br /><br />Shots are not my thing either.

				I&#039;m just screwing around, but yeah, the whole video makes me:<br />(http://www.webdesign.org/img_articles/2395/The_Cost_Of_Frustration2.jpg)<br />1) she took the smallest sip ever.&nbsp; <br />2) Canadian Whisky over American WhiskEy.<br />3) Pretending to be a down home gal.&nbsp; <br /><br />At this point I don&#039;t think that either Hilary or Barak have a real chance against McCain, which is disappointing, and I still am not sure where my vote will be wasted.

				Actually I really thought all 3 candidates were great with their campaign messages on WWE Wrestling. The lookalike match later left something to be desired, alth the Bill Clinton character tripping Obama up running the ropes was perfectly played.<br /><br />I&#039;ll vote for whoever gets the Democratic party nomination. And I really don&#039;t care if Hillary actually shot Vince Foster and Bill personally dragged his body into the woods, she&#039;s still better than the feeble moron currently residing in the White House.

For what it&#039;s worth, enormous movie productions provide a good many Americans with employment.&nbsp; There are certainly issues with the motion picture industry, such as the majority of the production crew applying for unemployment upon wrapping a movie, but it&#039;s an issue I need to examine more closely.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=10378.msg126947.html#msg126947">Quote from: TRX on May 07, 2008, 10:59:42 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What about vehicle caravans when you travel?

My point was Wal-Mart gets&nbsp; more criticism for selling China products cause&nbsp; it does contribute&nbsp; to Republicans more, while&nbsp; Costco, contributes&nbsp; to Democrats more, this may be the reason&nbsp; &nbsp;you hear more criticism for&nbsp; one than the other.&nbsp; Actually, the Left applauded and encouraged&nbsp; the opening to China, by Nixon, a fierce&nbsp; Anti-Communist. The saying goes, &#039;Only Nixon can go to China.&#039; This same Left wants open trade&nbsp; with Cuba. The thinking being that trading with people makes them less of an enemy. As for business, they would be fools not to encourage such thinking, after all, Armand Hammer had an Apt. in Moscow across&nbsp; KGB headquarters at the height of the Cold War, proving that business and Communism can work together&nbsp; to oppress workers.&nbsp; :wink:&nbsp; Hitler was less&nbsp; successful, combining Nationalism with Socialism, cause the Communists were on board only if they got a piece, but, the pact&nbsp; didn&#039;t last, plus, Adolf was racially obsessed, at least more openly than Stalin. You just can&#039;t trust&nbsp; totalitarians to share power.. shame, shame.. :lol:<br /><br />This is why I try to buy products MADE IN THE USA, or at least a nation that have a higher standard of living, it&#039;s hard. but, not impossible. Caring people, Left, Right or center should&nbsp; be onboard with this I would think, no?
