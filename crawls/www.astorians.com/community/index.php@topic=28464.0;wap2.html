			So I&#039;m an OK runner by nobody&#039;s standards but my own. I&#039;m on my way to my third half marathon next week, and while that&#039;s all good, and I enjoy running, I really want to get better at it, so I&#039;m wondering if anyone has any experience or knows of running clubs in the area. I know of Hellgate Road Runners and Team Trinity, but I&#039;m wondering if anyone has any experience with either, or what I should expect should I decide to join a club. Really I&#039;m trying to find a couple scheduled workouts during the week, and a long run on the weekends. In real life, I&#039;m reserved around groups, especially when they&#039;ve been doing things like running marathons together for years. <br /><br /><br />At the same time, if anyone is interested in the prospect of long runs on saturdays followed by cold beers somewhere, I&#039;d also love to just find some folks who are into that.
