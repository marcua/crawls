				Got one last night :). I&#039;ve never been there though. Saw the reviews from Yelp about the staff are unfriendly but the desserts are good. Has anyone ever try Artopolis before?

				The deserts there are amazing, I don&#039;t think the staff is unfriendly, just disorganized sometimes and they get really busy.

				I love Artopolis, especially all the little desserts in the case (mousse cake, cheesecake, profiteroles, etc.). When they&#039;d just opened there was a language barrier with a lot of the staff since they only spoke Greek, but since then I&#039;ve never had a bad experience. The staff are quite attentive.

				Alison, you convinced me to join Groupon just for this. I haven&#039;t been to Artopolis in a few years since I moved away from Ditmars, but soon I&#039;m going to be moving back up there and this will be a return treat. I also never noticed the staff being unfriendly. They seemed fine to me.

				Artopolis is an amazing bakery if you ask me.&nbsp; We are tremendously fortunate to have it in our neighborhood, and it would be hard to find many places comparable to it in the U.S.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had SO many wonderful things from there, both sweet and savory.&nbsp; Occassionally there&#039;s been something less impressive, but a wide range of truly wonderful stuff.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, the staff has been pretty wonderful in all of my experience there (which is probably too much - ask my waistline).&nbsp; I always enjoy going in the place.&nbsp; I&#039;m partial to the cookies, the savory pies, the breads, the custardy phyllo treats (galaktoboreko?) and especially the amazing tsoureki.&nbsp; If you ever catch that cardamon-orange scented bread when it&#039;s still hot from the oven, better find someplace to sit down when you taste it.
