				In case you missed the buzz, the hot new ice cream was created by a couple right here in the neighborhood. We were able to get a couple of the flavors at C-town on 28th Ave. The Amaretto (for Bayside, I think?) was great, but the Bronx Cha-Cha Chocolate was unbelievable!!! Great chocolate with (yes, people do this) a bit of Cayanne Pepper. I think I&#039;m gaining about 5-pounds just thinking about it.<br /><br />Definately my new ice cream of choice!!!!<br /><br />The couple from the neighborhood who came up with this stuff deserve every bit of good stuff coming to them. BUT, when and where will we see the Astoria Bakla-Wha??? I can&#039;t wait for that one.

				Yeah I was thrilled for the baklava one too but it was discontinued :-(&nbsp; That&#039;s a flavor I would&#039;ve made a special trip for... the others sound like decent but not as enticing. Perhaps they&#039;ll figure out a way to make it again someday.

				The ice cream was a hit on Friday night when I served it to my guests.&nbsp; We had some kind of chocolate called NYPD (I think), a Mango flavor and Amaretto flavor.&nbsp; They loved it!&nbsp; I just wish I did not have to go all the way to 34th Street to get it!&nbsp; Isn&#039;t there somewhere closer that sells it?

				I don&#039;t know where you&#039;re located exactly, but they also sell it at Best Yet Supermarket on 37th Street - between 19th and 20th Avenues.

				Staten Island Landfill is delicious.&nbsp; The residents of the Borough should be happy to have such a tasty flavor named after them.&nbsp; It&#039;s my favorite 5 Borough brand so far, though Rich White Vanilla is pretty great too.

				I understand that the upper east-siders are as offended at RWV being named after their nabe just as the SI bprp president is.<br /><br />Hey, in this case, I guess the truth hurts. :-)

				They were offering samples at Bravo a while back.&nbsp; Bakla-wha? was all gone by the time I came, but I had the Bay Ridge flavor and it was good!<br /><br />How said that no one will be able to have Bakla-wha? anymore.&nbsp; Did people not like it or what?

				Okay so I&#039;m probably missing it given the time and my just arriving home, but all I can find from the mentioned thread is:<br /><br />&quot;Check the website. They had to discontinue it (and I didn&#039;t even get to try it!) A production issue. Probably some problem with the people who make the baklava chunks.&quot;<br /><br />Which is a reasonable guess I could (and did) make myself. Not quite an explanation... Of course we have no grounds to &quot;demand&quot; an explanation, but given the multiple Astorians (TM) inquiring about baklava ice cream, and the obvious potential sales, I thought maybe an answer might be forthcoming... I guess I&#039;ll have to investigate making home-made ice cream or at least the best way to mix-in your own ingredients... (baklava!)

				I grabbed a pint of the rich white vanilla last night at the C-Town on 28th Ave, and this stuf is awesome.&nbsp; They had the mango and the amaretto (which is what I thought I grabbed, but was mistaken).&nbsp; I&#039;d love to find the cha cha chocolate and the NYPB.&nbsp;

				The Bay Ridge amaretto--that&#039;s what I enjoyed at Bravo.&nbsp; And it&#039;s a smooth flavor!
