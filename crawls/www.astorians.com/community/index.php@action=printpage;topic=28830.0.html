				Has anyone been before?&nbsp; I stumbled upon it on accident the other night and was really impressed.&nbsp; I would say (and this is just my opinion) that it&#039;s the best pizza I&#039;ve had in Astoria.&nbsp; I thought that their homemade meatballs were excellent too.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think this place is officially my new favorite.&nbsp;

				We&#039;ve been enjoying Palermo since they opened.&nbsp; Da Franco&#039;s was so bad in so many ways, including the hideous d√©cor.&nbsp; These people added a nice wine bar up front and tastefully redesigned the entire space.&nbsp; The food is delicious and as you say, awesome pizzas.&nbsp; Very reliable delivery too.&nbsp; They&#039;re very strong with seafood.&nbsp; Try their clams and any fresh fish special.

				I liked DaFranco&#039;s too! We tried Palermo once last year and I didn&#039;t care for it. It was right after a snow storm and my boyfriend walked the few blocks to order a pizza to go. When he returned he handed me the box and it felt light as a feather-I thought it was empty. When I opened it I saw a very sad looking margherita pizza. The crust was thin and hard like a matzoh, hardly any sauce and cheese and barely a leaf of basil, and it tasted blah. <br />Maybe I&#039;ll try them again one of these days, but I&#039;m in no hurry.
