				My experience renting from the owner&#39;s other buildings in Astoria was so bad, I don&#39;t think it would be wise of me to purchase an apartment from him.&nbsp; He has such a bad rep that there are realtors in the area who refuse to even work with him, lest it reflect badly on him.&nbsp;

				Gleason, all of your comments make me want to diagnose you with a DSM IV diagnosis, and it&#39;s not looking good. calm down. it&#39;s a little astoria forum board.<br /><br />for your information i&#39;m a female. and go to this forum to read information on things going on in the community. i&#39;m just a little s___ who just moved here 3 years ago, and would so badly like to move out of my cramped basement apartment once i have enough funds. <br /><br />this is not a set up. this is a post from a genuinely interested resident of astoria who would like to purchase something in the same area. that is all. and as far as &#39;taste&#39; of construction... those things do not really matter to me. i would like to live in a nice safe home. that is all. and i would like to be able to afford it. &#39;quality&#39; of construction? i dont know about this either, i&#39;m very new to all of this. that&#39;s why i&#39;m looking to this forum for some more information.&nbsp; <br /><br />and i do remember daisy saying the same thing about this building in another post, i just could not remember who stated it and if it indeed was about this building that we are talking about in this post.&nbsp; <br /><br />now, astorians, please go ahead and post up your truthful experiences about this building. thanks for your post daisy.&nbsp; i really like that area of the neighborhood, i think it&#39;s quite convenient. i would like to hear from other people tho. and i would like to view the apartments. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=4207.msg41961.html#msg41961">Quote from: Gleason on November 25, 2006, 12:43:11 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Daisy, I think this might be a set-up, perhaps in response to the beating up on the Eagle&#39;s &#39;nest&#39; on Astoria park.<br /><br />I mean really, look at his comments - does this sound like someone who is serious about parking most of their assets in a home: &quot;I THINK&nbsp; there was some discussion ...

				Your welcome for the comments.&nbsp; I would like to hear from more people with experiences with this building too.&nbsp; Typing in &quot;Pistilli&quot; does produce alot of results on this board - this is one about the blg - http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=2538.0, but there are others.&nbsp; Most isn&#39;t great.&nbsp; It&#39;s definitely over a 10 minute walk to the train but that might not be an issue for everyone.&nbsp; My number one complaint about condos in the area is that they are far from the train, and the rest that aren&#39;t - are coops, not condos.&nbsp; Number two is cost.

				Gleason, is it really so bad that people want to buy so that they can stay here and start a family without constantly throwing their money out on rent? <br /><br />Maybe what we really need is to encourage developers to build affordable coops and condos (and personally I am in favor of coops which encourage the owners to live in their apartments and not just rent them out) rather than high turnover rentals.

				No absolutely not! Owner occupied housing is always better than an absentee landlord. And I am certainly happy that you want to stay here and invest and LIVE in Astoria. :mrgreen:<br /><br />There are scores of buildings that you can buy that are already here. There is wide agreement that the prewar ones have the best layout and design, especially compared to what is being built recently. The new construction is for the most part, ill-designed. <br /><br />The old factory on Ditmars? People more knowledgable than I have commented on their owner and the quality of their construction, so I will say nothing on those points. I assume you have read those posts.<br /><br />Ramping up the population is not a good idea if you do not have the infrastructure to support it. Do you want your kids to go to school in a trailer in a playground? Raise a family in an area that even the boro president said had inadequate medical facilities? etc, etc etc.<br /><br />Besides, I would not be so cavalier to ignore the little fact that the ENTIRE CITY is trying to stop development. Astoria is almost alone in this manic drive to build. What do we know that everyone else is missing? Or perhaps, just perhaps, we are not getting the full picture?&nbsp;&nbsp; :|<br /><br />The &#39;affordable&#39; part is a bit a cynical - a sad play by the prodevelopment crowd. After you factor in all the infrastructure costs the housing is not very affordable. Now on the other hand, if they brought in good paying jobs and lowered taxes, then housing would be affordable for millions in our city, not just a few hundred lower end units built each year ... but real effort is always more difficult than simple minded sloganeering.<br /><br />Besides, its always a howl when you look at the fine print and find out what they mean by &#39;affordable.&#39; Even in Queens, newspaper headlines have covered that issue!<br /><br />If you want high density, then there are many good high density neighborhoods in NYC and you should feel free to look in those places that already have the high-density infrastructure in place. <br /><br />The point is that Astorians like the feel of a small community. Making Astoria high density would kill the goose that lays the golden egg. It would not be Astoria.<br /><br />I appreciate your question, and would like a lot more people to comment. This board is an excellent place for discussion. <br /><br />

It&#39;s not a pretty picture. Which is why we are always hoping for something nicer. <br /><br />Personally, I&#39;d be ecstatic if more building owners decided to sell out and let their buildings go coop, but that is something that is certainly not likely to happen in this market.

				You both raise some telling good points.<br /><br />Sometimes you might have to be creative. <br /><br />For example, if you bought a prewar six family, like one of the &#39;Mathews Flats&#39; (there are dozens and dozens of these and they are cheap), moved into one unit on the top floor, then one by one took over the other units, you could have a duplex (with what was formerly 4 units with 20 rooms) and lay out the footprint that makes sense for your family.<br /><br />The two bottom units could provide cash flow to cover the property expenses.<br />Check out #44:<br />http://nymag.com/nymetro/realestate/neighborhoods/features/12195/index3.html<br /><br />I know at least two young families that did something like that in Ridgewood and are pleased as punch.<br /><br />You can look at Old Astoria and find a number of very very old homes. Again, I know one young couple that moved from the Village and are extremely happy. They may be pioneers, but they got a lot more for the money than anything in Brooklyn of comp. size.<br /><br />These are two examples. <br /><br />You are telling me that all those homes on 36th Ave to Broadway and east of Crescent are out of reach? I have been in some of those two story places and they are perfect for young families.

				Pistilli also has the co-ops on the park (former eagle electric factory)&nbsp; We went to see them a couple of weeks ago and were VERY disappointed.&nbsp; They had the potential to be really nice, the spaces are large and airy with big windows and (on the park side) great views - however - we couldn&#39;t believe how cheaply they were fitted out.&nbsp; The cheapest ugliest laminate flooring, miniscule kitchen areas (couldn&#39;t even be described as a kitchen), cheap, crappy appliances, cheap crappy looking formica coutertops and cabinets - I could go on!&nbsp; Also, the maintenance is a dollar per sq. ft.&nbsp; and they don&#39;t own the land so they will probably whack on a huge assessment in a couple of years in order to finance the mortgage on the land - NOT WORTH IT!!!&nbsp; It sucks really because this building could have been fantastic for Astoria - never mind!

But that is just a dream for now.

				I&#39;m willing to bet there are a lot of us who can barely be able to afford to buy something under $300 thousand.&nbsp; Finding a 2BR condo/coop or a whole house for under 300 is mostly impossible here, and then when you add in the maintenance especially from a coop, you&#39;re paying through the roof.&nbsp; I&#39;m single yet will have to wait til I&#39;m married or change careers in order to afford to buy around here.&nbsp; The idea of buying a $500 thousand Matthew old tenement flat is completely out of my reach and therefore laughable.&nbsp; It&#39;s anything but affordable.

				<em> I could have looked in Jackson Heights or Forest Hills, where there are literally hundreds of coops and condos, but I wanted to stay in Astoria, and that was what I had to choose from. </em> <br /><br />Huh?<br /><br />Well, move to a community that ALREADY has the character that you want ... its a lot easier than trying to change a community&#39;s character into something YOU want. Even in a place with rabid prodevelopment leadership like Astoria will take years to get moving in the direction you want.<br /><br />You could move into a coop in Jackson Heights next month.<br /><br />If I like a back yard and trees, and lived, for example, in Washington Heights, would I say I&#39;ve been to Bayside and Little Neck and seen lots of places with a back yard and trees, but I like Washington Heights and want to stay there?<br /><br />Most people decide on a community profile they like, then goes out and finds a community that offers it.

				About a year and a half ago, I did look in Western Queens, from Jackson Hts to Astoria, Westchester, Dutchess, Putnam counties, and Jersey.&nbsp; Finding a 2BR condo that isn&#39;t 400 thousand or higher is extremely hard.&nbsp; More doable in Jersey, but I decided I wasn&#39;t ready to move to Jersey.&nbsp; Upstate you have to add in car, insurance fees, and metronorth.&nbsp; Yes, there are coops in Queens but 2 BRs are still expensive plus there&#39;s the higher maintenance - which drives your cost up.&nbsp; Then there&#39;s the board to deal with, and the fact that you don&#39;t directly own it.&nbsp; Your neighbors know all your financial and in some cases personal business, and you have to ask their permission for everything.&nbsp; I&#39;d rather have a condo or a house.<br /><br />I love Astoria but I&#39;m not tied here.&nbsp; The simple fact is the high cost is everywhere I look within the vicinity of an hour and a half of Manhattan.
