				We keep our ground chili pepper in a glass jar, the kind restaurants put sugar in, that has a little flap on the metal cap that covers the pour spout.&nbsp; (It just happens to be the kind of jar my husband bought, there&#039;s no special reason for having it in there.)&nbsp; The jar has been pretty much empty for months.&nbsp; I bought a new bag of chili powder the other day, but I decided to dump the last little bit of what was in the jar in with the other spices I had just put in a bowl.&nbsp; I thought the little dark things in the glass jar were clumps of chili powder, but no!&nbsp; When I dumped them out they started walking!!!!&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what kind of bugs they were or when they got into the jar, but I wouldn&#039;t have thought anything was capable of living in prolonged physical contact with chili powder.&nbsp; Has anybody else ever found things living in their chili powder, and if chili powder doesn&#039;t kill bugs, what does?&nbsp; I thought chili powder was one of those things people are told to sprinkle in their cabinets to keep buts out.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Sounds you might have a type of pantry beetle called sawtooth beetle. There are other similar types in that family of pantry beetle. I have experience with this before. I opened all my spices like garlic powder, honey, oregano and sure enough they were in there. They like cardboard and can be found in bag of flour too. These items seem like they come with the bug or sometime the bug appears and infests the other items. I cleaned my pantry and threw lots of stuff away. I bought new spices and now store them only in the fridge. They continue to appear for a few weeks after the cleaning and haven&#039;t seen them for months now. Oh they hate the light. They like to hide under jars and cardboard boxes. There&#039;s lots of info on them on the internet. I had to start somewhere they were buggin me out lol

				Well yech, and thank you!&nbsp; I just did a little reading about them on the Orkin and Penn State websites.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m about to start my fall kitchen cabinet clean up, so I&#039;ll have a good look at <em>everything</em>.<br /><br /><br />A lot of bugs do hate light.&nbsp; I wonder if our new world of dim bulbs is going to contribute to a rise in bug population.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
