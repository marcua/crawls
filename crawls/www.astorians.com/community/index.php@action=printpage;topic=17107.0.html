				Please , please some advice.....<br /><br />About 2 years ago they began to build on an empty lot next to my building...it unearthed a horrendous rodent problem....first just mice....then hordes of rats....<br /><br />They first appeared inthe garbage area...no one did anything to control them...not the construction people...the landlord of my building or the tenants who did nothing to dispose of garbage in a manner that would not attract the rats in the first place.<br /><br />Now the area next door is all cemented up but the rats that were unearthed have now taken up permanent residence and now have reproduced to a ridiculous number. &nbsp;They have found their way into the basement and in some cases into the apartments.<br /><br />Called the city...inspectors came that were either afraid of seeing the rodents themselves....or didnt see anything at the moment and reported it as unfounded. &nbsp;Landlord refuses to get an exterminator and will do nothing about anything.<br /><br />What is my recourse? &nbsp;Does anyone have any suggestions before someone gets attacked or the droppings of these foul things give us all disease. &nbsp;I&#039;m at my wits&#039; end and need timely advice....ANYONE...thanks<br /><br />

				first of all start taking pictures for starters the lot next door, in front of your house, the garbage that is not put in the cans properly anywhere that you may see rats and keep on calling the city, 311 and also your landlord and let them know that you have pictures with the dates and times on them.&nbsp; Try calling your council person in your area and explain your problem and tell them it is very bad for your health and others around you and see what happens or try calling the Gazette and letting them know your problem also.&nbsp; Good Luck

				Those &quot;inspectors&quot; who were either afraid or reported seeing no rodents should be fired! Next time write down their name and make a complaint. Calm down, they won&#039;t attack you. Adopt a cat for<br />some protection and peace of mind for the time being. Actually adopt 2 of them so when one of them is asleep the other one is awake and on guard. :mrgreen:

				Where do you live? What an awful situation. <br /><br />I live next to an abandoned building and we had a rat problem for a brief time. They were nesting in the backyard and<br />would come out on the sidewalk. But I called 311 and they put those bait &#039;boxes&#039; - I don&#039;t know what else to call them! - <br />and we didn&#039;t see them anymore.<br /><br />I would take photos as another poster suggested. You can also go on the NYC Dept. of Buildings website and find out who<br />owns the property. I did that with this building because vagrants were starting to use it and were climbing out of windows <br />at all hours. I reported it and the owner was forced to board up the windows and put high boards around the property.<br /><br />I&#039;d also call 311 again. It can&#039;t hurt. And if you still don&#039;t get anywhere, contact your local representative. I contacted <br />Vallone&#039;s office when this owner refused to shovel their snow and our block was a sheet of ice. His office followed up<br />with the Dept. of Buildings and got after him.<br /><br />You don&#039;t have to live with this and shouldn&#039;t. But the cat idea is also good. If you can have them, it wouldn&#039;t hurt!<br /><br />Good luck.<br />

				Wow guys ...thanks for the prompt responses....I am so beside myself...I live on the first floor so I am right above these rats playgrounds.....And so far as the tenants are concerned...they are so ridiculous!!!<br /><br />I understand that they don&#039;t want to go near the cans in the back becos they are afraid of the rats...but they are making it worse cos they just throw garbage all over the place...not properly bagged or disposed of...which of cors makes it worse. <br /><br />I can&#039;t get a cat...tried a kitten a few months ago...but my san and daughter are both extrememly allergic...thought they had outgrown it...but they haven&#039;t ...so that was a no go..and these rats????&nbsp; bigger than small dogs....<br /><br />But the pictures are a great idea and calling the local papers and reps ...gonna give it a try.&nbsp; I heard the landlord downstairs today...cos I threatened him with the city....and he was on the phone complaining that his little packets of killer wasn&#039;t doing the job!!!!&nbsp; Is he kidding right now???&nbsp; It&#039;s gonna take more than that.....<br /><br />And I&#039;d like to believe they won&#039;t attack ...but a cornered rat always does...I&#039;ve seen it happen...so I&#039;m petrified...I was loaded with mice in the fall and hired my own people to cure the problem in my apt.&nbsp; ...this one I can&#039;t handle alone.<br /><br />Thanks again for your input...I&#039;m gonna try your suggestions.. wish me luck!!!!<br /><br />

				To keep them from coming inside, try not to leave any food lying around. Also, try to get some peppermint oil and soak cotton balls with it. Then put the cotton balls in areas where you think rats may come in. Rats hate the smell of peppermint and when they smell it, they will leave because it stings their noses.<br /><br />Although the peppermint oil idea may be a good temporary solution, you should really try to contact the city and report the landlord.

				Thats a good hint bout the peppermint oil....I always have some on hand cos it is great for so many things but scaring away rodents was one I did not know about...I will make sure that I use it in places that I am afraid they may make their way in...<br /><br />Landlord still jerking me around...but hasn&#039;t done much of anything ...when I told him that metal cans wtih tight fitting lids would be a good deterrent...his reply?....&quot;Are you serious??&nbsp; Do you know how expensive those things are????&quot;<br /><br />Shows you his level of caring....
