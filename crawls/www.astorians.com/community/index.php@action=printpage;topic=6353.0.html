				Rev. Falwell was&nbsp; a man who gave a voice&nbsp; to tens of millions of religous&nbsp; people who were marginalised&nbsp; by the NY/L.A. Elitists.

				I really appreciate that you have strong feelings about Mr. Falwell. <br /><br />As for the for the &quot;tens of millions of religous&nbsp; people who were marginalised&nbsp; by the NY/L.A. Elitists&quot;...the term &quot;elitists&quot; was coined by the Mr. Falwell (and his compatriots Mrs. Robinson and Mr. Baker) to who refer to appreciated the arts during a time when their religious/political puppet Mr. Helms was opposing government funding to the arts (google it...the word Maplethorp should do it....)<br /><br />As to your point, &quot;Rev. Falwell was&nbsp; a man who gave a voice&nbsp; to tens of millions of religous&nbsp; people who were marginalised&nbsp; by the NY/L.A.&quot;: I had an aunt, a &quot;true believer&quot; (as I think the favored reference at the time was) from Mountain View, AR who was conned by the likes of this man and the Bakers and the Robinsons AND ADOPTED BY THE REAGANS) who was taken for all she was worth by this con man. Don&#039;t give me the argument that it was charlatains who used their name...it was Falwell&#039;s organization that she gave it all to. (No, I would have had no claim to it...I just watched &quot;religion&quot; destroy the rest of the family...then go the hell out).<br /><br />This jerk conned an entire generation and region into thinking that any contrary thought to theirs was obscene, prejicuiced or illiterate:<br /><br />Let me take these apart one-by-one:<br /><br />OBSCENE: Homosexuals, Adultarists &amp; Artists: (the great offenders 1-by1)): Jim Baker, Jimmy Swaggart &amp; Norman Rockwell. I mean no disrespect to Rockwell, just to those who think he&#039;s the greatest artist ever on the planet.<br /><br />PREJICUICED: Historically, these are the same people who supported George Wallace for President...&#039;nuff said (except this: I&#039;ve known many real klansmen in my life...including my step-father and my mother&#039;s southern baptist minister. I don&#039;t say that all southern baptists are klan...I&#039;ve just never know a klansman who wasn&#039;t a southern baptist.)<br /><br />ILLITERATE: Anyone who thinks that what they&#039;ve read is a literal interpretation and the final word and has not investigaged the original Hebrew and Greel texts that make up what are the basis of the Bible (who is Lilith...Buhler...Buhler...?)<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry. I don&#039;t celebrate anyone&#039;s death, but...look at my earlier Bette Davis note. These are the idiots that gave us Reagan/Bush/Junior.<br /><br />Comments?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Rev. Falwell was&nbsp; a man who gave a voice&nbsp; to tens of millions of religous&nbsp; people who were marginalised&nbsp; by the NY/L.A. Elitists. He&nbsp; was not intollerant, he had&nbsp; religious&nbsp; beliefs and debated&nbsp; many folks&nbsp; and even invited&nbsp; his &#039;gay&#039;&nbsp; neighbor&nbsp; to his house.

				Most of my friends have been experiencing the same reaction over this - excited, and yet a little embarassed to be excited about it, because everyone knows it&#039;s not nice to be glad that someone has died.&nbsp; <br /><br />In this case, though, this was not a good man.&nbsp; This was a man who sought to widen the culture divide by brewing hatred.&nbsp; He took good but naive people and turned them into hateful bigots in the name of Jesus.&nbsp; This was a man who inspired intolerance and bigotry and turned families against each other and made outlandish statements to gain media attention for himself.&nbsp; <br /><br />This man and others like him were the reason why kids at my hometown liberal Protestant church didn&#039;t believe they were real Christians, because their classmates at school were telling them what real Christians were and weren&#039;t, and those messages were full of hate, so Christians couldn&#039;t possibly be tolerant and loving and open-minded like our group.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not glad that a person is dead, but I am delighted that I won&#039;t have to keep turning off the TV because I hear his name.&nbsp; I just hope no one tries to turn him into a martyr, and that the effects of his brand of &quot;Christianity&quot; aren&#039;t a permanent effect on the sad culture divide in this country.&nbsp; I wish I could say it was a first step towards fixing the problem, but we&#039;ve got a long way to go to undo the damage.

				Yeah, this was a tolerant man.<br /><br />And, I know that I&#039;ll hear from them for this. But, throwing God out successfully with the help of the federal court system, throwing God out of the public square, out of the schools. The abortionists have got to bear some burden for this because God will not be mocked. And when we destroy 40 million little innocent babies, we make God mad. I really believe that the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People for the American Way -- all of them who have tried to secularize America -- I point the finger in their face and say, &quot;You helped this happen.&quot;<br />-- Rev Jerry Falwell, blaming civil libertarians, feminists, homosexuals, and abortion rights supporters for the terrorist attacks of Tuesday, September 11, 2001, quoted from John F Harris, &quot;God Gave US &#039;What We Deserve,&#039; Falwell Says,&quot; The Washington Post (September 14, 2001)<br /><br />AIDS is the wrath of a just God against homosexuals. To oppose it would be like an Israelite jumping in the Red Sea to save one of Pharoah&#039;s chariotters.<br />-- Rev Jerry Falwell (attributed: source unknown)<br /><br />&nbsp;If you&#039;re not a born-again Christian, you&#039;re a failure as a human being.<br />-- Rev Jerry Falwell (attributed: source unknown)<br /><br />I listen to feminists and all these radical gals - most of them are failures. They&#039;ve blown it. Some of them have been married, but they married some Casper Milquetoast who asked permission to go to the bathroom. These women just need a man in the house. That&#039;s all they need. Most of the feminists need a man to tell them what time of day it is and to lead them home. And they blew it and they&#039;re mad at all men. Feminists hate men. They&#039;re sexist. They hate men - that&#039;s their problem. -Jerry Falwell

				Some Falwell Quotes...<br /><br />On September 13th, 2001...<br />&nbsp;“I really believe that the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People For the American Way, all of them who have tried to secularize America. I point the finger in their face and say’you helped this happen.”<br /><br />He did apologize later...<br />&quot;I would never blame any human being except the terrorists, and if I left that impression with gays or lesbians or anyone else, I apologize.”<br /><br />Hmmmm, sounded like blame to me.<br /><br />About the Equal Rights Ammendment (sorry, can&#039;t find a date on this one)...<br />“I listen to feminists and all these radical gals… These women just need a man in the house. That’s all they need. Most of the feminists need a man to tell them what time of day it is and to lead them home. And they blew it and they’re mad at all men. Feminists hate men. They’re sexist. They hate men; that’s their problem.&quot;<br /><br />“I hope I live to see the day when, as in the early days of our country, we won’t have any public schools. The churches will have taken them over again and Christians will be running them. What a happy day that will be!” – America Can Be Saved, 1979 pp. 52-53, from Albert J. Menendez and Edd Doerr, The Great Quotations on Religious Freedom<br /><br />“...You’ve got to kill the terrorists before the killing stops and I am for the President—chase them all over the world, if it takes ten years, blow them all away in the name of the Lord.” – CNN Debate with Jesse Jackson (October 24, 2004)<br /><br />I must cite campusprogress.org for the quotes.<br /><br />Does this man sound sane? &nbsp;I know I&#039;ve cherry-picked just a few quotes from a lifetime of dialogue, and the man had undoubtedly helped many a soul in his career, but i must say this...<br /><br />He and the Moral &quot;Majority&quot; need to stay the hell out of politics. &nbsp;<br /><br />And my life. &nbsp;<br /><br />And yours.<br /><br />&nbsp;

The problem was most of my schoolmates at the time had no idea what the &quot;Moral Majority&quot; was (this should always appear in quotes since it&#039;s a moniker, not a tangible entity) or what the statement on the button meant. Though they&#039;ve long since been discontinued, there are all sorts of new buttons available from Donnely/Colt (http://www.donnellycolt.com/catalog/peacebutton.html), the original company that made them. I also still have my &quot;No Nukes&quot; button from back then, though now I feel it should say &quot;Maybe Nukes&quot; or, at the very least, &quot;No Coal.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;:-(<br /><br />As for FZ&#039;s comments, you either are in denial or are quite uninformed. And that&#039;s too bad. Right-wing fundamentalist Christian leaders have tainted the collective unconsciousness of many well-meaning folks and have consistently turned fear into hatred into pollitical and financial gain. The hipocracies are endless: Tom Delay, Ted Haggard, Mark Foley, Bill Frist, Scooter Libby, Ralph Reed...oh, wait! I don&#039;t have to list them all, <strong>someone already has (http://www.dkosopedia.com/wiki/Examples_of_Republican_hypocrisy_on_moral_values)</strong>. And they cite sources, too!<br /><br />On a lighter note, here&#039;s a funny bit (http://www.landoverbaptist.org/news0507/falwell.html). <br />

				Actually, the term fits ,&#039;Elitist&#039;, just look at the hostility&nbsp; on this thread? Falwell helped many people, but, it was never reported&nbsp; in the media, which is controlled in the&nbsp; NY/L.A. parts of the country. I don&#039;t have&nbsp; to goggle Maplethorp, anyone who puts&nbsp; a&nbsp; crucifix in&nbsp; a jar of urine and&nbsp; bullwhip up his @$$&nbsp; is hard to forget.:lol:<br /><br />I don&#039;t know&nbsp; your Aunt or&nbsp; her circumstances. Falwell&nbsp; only expressed a reality&nbsp; that many felt. Traditional folks&nbsp; have&nbsp; as much right to speak&nbsp; up and be part of govt. The mere&nbsp; fact that&nbsp; you try to lump them all together&nbsp; says alot about your own prejudice. Think about it. <br /><br />We obviously&nbsp; are miles&nbsp; apart even though we are in the same town. IMO, Reagan was one of greatest Presidents&nbsp; in my lifetime. If anything, the only &#039;idiots&#039; I see are those&nbsp; who opposed&nbsp; him and I&#039;m being charitable&nbsp; as&nbsp; to their motivations. <br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=6353.msg73670.html#msg73670">Quote from: knhs on May 16, 2007, 03:13:46 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I really appreciate that you have strong feelings about Mr. Falwell. <br /><br />As for the for the &quot;tens of millions of religous&nbsp; people who were marginalised&nbsp; by the NY/L.A. Elitists&quot;...the term &quot;elitists&quot; was coined by the Mr. Falwell (and his compatriots Mrs. Robinson and Mr. Baker) to who refer to appreciated the arts during a time when their religious/political puppet Mr. Helms was opposing government funding to the arts (google it...the word Maplethorp should do it....)<br /><br />As to your point, &quot;Rev. Falwell was&nbsp; a man who gave a voice&nbsp; to tens of millions of religous&nbsp; people who were marginalised&nbsp; by the NY/L.A.&quot;: I had an aunt, a &quot;true believer&quot; (as I think the favored reference at the time was) from Mountain View, AR who was conned by the likes of this man and the Bakers and the Robinsons AND ADOPTED BY THE REAGANS) who was taken for all she was worth by this con man. Don&#039;t give me the argument that it was charlatains who used their name...it was Falwell&#039;s organization that she gave it all to. (No, I would have had no claim to it...I just watched &quot;religion&quot; destroy the rest of the family...then go the hell out).<br /><br />This jerk conned an entire generation and region into thinking that any contrary thought to theirs was obscene, prejicuiced or illiterate:<br /><br />Let me take these apart one-by-one:<br /><br />OBSCENE: Homosexuals, Adultarists &amp; Artists: (the great offenders 1-by1)): Jim Baker, Jimmy Swaggart &amp; Norman Rockwell. I mean no disrespect to Rockwell, just to those who think he&#039;s the greatest artist ever on the planet.<br /><br />PREJICUICED: Historically, these are the same people who supported George Wallace for President...&#039;nuff said (except this: I&#039;ve known many real klansmen in my life...including my step-father and my mother&#039;s southern baptist minister. I don&#039;t say that all southern baptists are klan...I&#039;ve just never know a klansman who wasn&#039;t a southern baptist.)<br /><br />ILLITERATE: Anyone who thinks that what they&#039;ve read is a literal interpretation and the final word and has not investigaged the original Hebrew and Greel texts that make up what are the basis of the Bible (who is Lilith...Buhler...Buhler...?)<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry. I don&#039;t celebrate anyone&#039;s death, but...look at my earlier Bette Davis note. These are the idiots that gave us Reagan/Bush/Junior.<br /><br />Comments?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Rev. Falwell was&nbsp; a man who gave a voice&nbsp; to tens of millions of religous&nbsp; people who were marginalised&nbsp; by the NY/L.A. Elitists. He&nbsp; was not intollerant, he had&nbsp; religious&nbsp; beliefs and debated&nbsp; many folks&nbsp; and even invited&nbsp; his &#039;gay&#039;&nbsp; neighbor&nbsp; to his house. He&nbsp; was also&nbsp; a&nbsp; great American who opposed&nbsp; Communism and&nbsp; helped&nbsp; many people. I know my view is a minority&nbsp; here, but, I hope it wil be &#039;tolerated.&#039; <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

This will evidently come as a shock to you, but Ronald Reagan is personally responsible for the deaths tens of thousands (or, more like hundreds of thousands) of poor people in Latin America. This must sound like science fiction to you and I wish it was. It&#039;s all well documented. Get your head out of the sand and look it up. <br /><br />The real shame is that good, honest, moral folk (like yourself, perhaps?) were duped by war hawk, greedy, &quot;Neo-Con&quot; politicians into supporting their ridiculous policies by concocting various boogeymen in the minds of the uninformed masses (that&#039;s right, uninformed, as in let&#039;s strip away all money for education and keep the population &#039;uninformed&#039;) by scaring them into thinking that gay, atheist, drug-dealing, communists were going to come rape their children in the night. This paved the way for them to rig government contracts with their buddies, many of whose companies they sat on the boards of.<br /><br />The amazing thing is that, after everything that&#039;s come out and been revealed about these terrible people, you still support them. It&#039;s no wonder they got away with it and are still getting away with it to this day. Please do yourself and your country a favor a read Thomas Frank&#039;s insightful book, What&#039;s the Matter with Kansas? How Conservatives Won the Heart of America (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What%27s_the_Matter_with_Kansas%3F). It&#039;s an amazingly true story about how an entire state (and a large portion of our country) was manipulated and lied to and left in ruin for political and financial gain. <br /><br />If you can honestly sit here and defend a man who blamed, and I quote, &quot;pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians&quot; for the 9/11 attacks, then there&#039;s really no point in continuing this thread. He was a hateful man, no matter what good you believe he may have done. Christ never taught hate. This man was no Christian. <br />

				I agree to a degree with F-Z.&nbsp; His popularity was genuine and he did give a voice to a fair amount of the population.&nbsp; He didn&#039;t &quot;invent&quot; such sociopolitical views amoungst folk, just as Hitler didn&#039;t &quot;invent&quot; anti-semitism.&nbsp; It was there already.&nbsp; There was no more duping, lying or brainwashing going on then we&#039;d see out of any person of his position (conservatives/liberals/et cetera, no matter).&nbsp; He simply channeled it and put it out there on the national dialogue.<br /><br />That being said, I never liked the guy one bit.&nbsp;

The George Bushes, The Jerry Fallwells, The Wal-Mart executives, The Fox News personel, the Neco-cons, all who claim to be devout Christians? <strong>No.</strong> He would go to the downtrodden, who never got a break in life because of their social-economic, ethnic, religious, or sexual persuasion statuses. He will visit the poor and the sick, the abused , the oppressed and the disenfranchised. He will not be blessing those who spend their lives making money off of others, and marginalising groups of people in the name of God. <br /><br />People need to stop listening to televangelists and hatemongers, and read the bible for what it was intended for. Loving they neighbor is the most important thing in life, but it&#039;s the first thing people like Jerry Falwell had forgotten. But he got rich, didn&#039;t he? Very rich. Going to be awfully hard for him to fit through the gates of heaven now, isn&#039;t it? <br />
