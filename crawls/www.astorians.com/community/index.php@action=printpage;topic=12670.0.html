				Anyone know what the deal is with this place?&nbsp; It&#039;s been closed for over a week... there are some whisperings in the neighborhood about something shady going down...&nbsp; just curious!

				When it first opened, the owner was really nice, friendly etc. Said he&#039;d take requests for stocking certain items, but it never happened. With the new/improved Othello a block away, I just go there instead. The vibe is much better- not sure why, guess it seems more like a real deli than a bodega.<br /><br />

				Maybe this is where the &quot;hooded sweatshirt and jeans&quot; people congregate. After all, it is a shady place&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br />Anyway, I noticed it closed for some time now. Rode by it a few nights back in the wee hours of the morning on the motorcycle and the front gate was open.

				There was caution tape up around that whole corner the other night, looked like there was freshly poured cement and they were fixing up the sidewalk.&nbsp; Not sure if thats the reason they&#039;re closed though...

				The owner before this one survived for the few months he had the store on lotto and beer. Period.&nbsp; He bought the store thinking he&#039;d be able to get people to buy his &quot;healing&quot; drinks, but it didn&#039;t seem to work out at all. He and his wife owned a few stores in the city and decided they&#039;d had enough, so he sold it the last owners, two brothers.&nbsp; These brothers didn&#039;t do their homework at all! They bought the store, didn&#039;t even throw out the old, and i mean old stuff and hoped for business. I must pass the store at least 6 times a day and never would see anyone going in! The few times i actually went in, it would be one of the guys and his girlfriend hanging out. Weird.&nbsp; The first week they opened, they got rid of the lotto (big mistake!). A few days ago I saw the ATM machine go. Then, the sidewalk was fixed, and the exterior &quot;we serve breakfast all day&quot; signs were removed. I think the fat lady is singing on this store.

				The actual name of the deli on the sign is &quot;Ray&#039;s 25th Deli &amp; Grocery&quot;. I guess that means that somewhere soon will be &quot;Ray&#039;s 26th Deli &amp; Grocery&quot;... <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;:lmao: I crack me up!
