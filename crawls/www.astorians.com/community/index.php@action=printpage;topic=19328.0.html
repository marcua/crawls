				<br />My family is stopping by for my dad&#039;s birthday, and I&#039;m new to the 30th avenue hood. I was looking to come up with a couple of options for them, preferably Greek or Italian restaurants (they aren&#039;t really into Asian). I have heard of Vesta and it is close by, I was just hoping there would be a couple of other places in the vicinity for a nice sit down meal with family. They are driving so I also want them to be able to park near my apt and we could walk to the place. Thanks!

				For Greek I really like Zenon Taverna on 31st ave, it&#039;s around 34th st. Good family atmosphere and great food!! They also have hot/cold appetizer platters you can share as a group. The traditional greek wine is interesting to try but I forget the name of it.

				Vesta is a terrific choice. My favorite place for Greek is Philoxenia, on 34th Ave and 33rd St. Vesta is Italian-influenced American locavore, and might be slightly &quot;Brooklyn&quot; in feel. Philoxenia is a rather traditional family-run Greek menu, focused a little less on fish than some other neighborhood Greek spots, in an elegant but homey space.

My favorite is Bahari (Stamatis) but as I said, my family will be parking near my apartment on 30th avenue and don&#039;t want to walk too far to the restaurant. As of now Vesta is the closest option I have. But thanks anyway.

				I second the Zenon Taverna recommendation.&nbsp; I&#039;m a big fan of their sheftalia and even had them cater my wedding.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=19328.msg203023.html#msg203023">Quote from: kem2127 on September 11, 2010, 12:45:04 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The traditional greek wine is interesting to try but I forget the name of it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The name of the wine in the quote is retsina. It may be an acquired taste but it&#039;s pretty remarkable.
