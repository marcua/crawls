				<br />hi all, this is a post for my amazing mom (her name is also audrey!), she&#039;s a babysitter with 24 years experience. see below -- thanks!<br /><br /><br /><strong>EXPERIENCED BABYSITTER AVAILABLE IN ASTORIA/LIC</strong> <br /><br />(based in Astoria/LIC but can watch children from surrounding areas too, including Roosevelt Island! my house is very close to the Roosevelt Island Bridge) <br /><br />I am a 49-year-old English-speaking woman living in Astoria/LIC, near the Isamu Noguchi Garden Museum, Rainey Park, and the Socrates Sculpture Park. I am a mom of a 25-year-old, a 23-year-old, and a 14-year-old. I have helped to raise many children over the years, and when one of the children I had babysat grew up, she actually brought me her own daughter to care for. I have cared for children ages 6 weeks and up. I believe my many references will speak for themselves - please contact me if you are interested so that I can pass along their info and you can speak to them directly. <br /><br />I babysit in my home - I have a backyard with a swingset, and in the warmer months we have a sprinkler and a wading pool.<br /><br />I am available Monday to Friday, 7am to 7pm, but the hours are flexible, and I can babysit after school, too. <br /><br />I have reasonable rates - I can work with you. <br /><br />Please call me at (347) 840-2711 or email me at hummingbird1211@gmail.com for more info and feel free to ask any questions. I will get back to you immediately. <br /><br />Thanks so much!<br /><br />Audrey
