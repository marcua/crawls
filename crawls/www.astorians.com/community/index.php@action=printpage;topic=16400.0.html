				I consider myself an animal lover. I generally try to respect all living things, knowing that they&#039;re just trying to get on just like we all are, and sometimes our habitats collide, etc. Of course this does not really extend to bugs and in general animals that actually come into my apartment (or viruses and things like that, if you really want to get technical), but for the most part I&#039;m kind of a Live-And-Let-Live kind of person.<br /><br />So, why am I posting this thread? Because, this summer, my roommates and I had the unique experience of having a pigeon family grow up in plain view outside our window. We could watch it from our bathroom window because our living room window is about 4 feet away from that, and these pigeons made a nest in the space between the living room&#039;s air conditioner and the side of the window. <br /><br />My roommates and I don&#039;t particularly like pigeons; in fact, I generally keep away from pigeon flocks and get annoyed at people who feed them on purpose. But we weren&#039;t about to toss a pigeon and its eggs off our 3rd story window ledge, so we left it there and enjoyed watching the various stages of ugliness that pigeon babies go through on their path to adulthood. (example: http://pigeonwriter.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/0427buildings0006.jpg)<br /><br />You may not be aware of this, but pigeons typically lay two eggs at a time. This was consistent with our pigeon family. Those pigeons hatched and grew up and were out of the nest all in the span of maybe about 2 months. The first time this happened, we were like &quot;Aw, pigeon family.&quot; Then, the same pigeons made another nest under a board of pigeon spikes our neighbor had skillfully installed next door however long ago. Two more babies resulted from that. After THOSE pigeons grew up and flew away, the same pigeon parents returned to the old nest in our window and laid yet another pair of eggs.<br /><br />By then, we were getting kind of tired of baby pigeons growing outside our window. But we were still content to let them be, as they weren&#039;t really bothering anybody. That all changed when, this past Friday, my roommate noticed a huge swarm of tiny tiny bugs crawling around the inside of that window. They were coming in through the cracks. They were all over the place. They bit him. Totally nasty. So he opened the window, tossed the nest, threw away the air conditioner, and sprayed the hell out of that window. The newest babies were pretty much ready to fledge and did not die upon hitting the ground, and my roommate now has permanent heebie-jeebies. <br /><br />I just happened to be out of town when this happened, but I was curious as to what was going on when I came home to find nobody home, piles of trash bags out in our hallway and the cat&#039;s food and water out of place, as well as a different kind of litter in the cat&#039;s litter pan. I felt like I was in the twilight zone, or perhaps <em>Dark City</em>. Instead, my roommate was freaked out that these bugs were bed bugs and he decided to throw away tons of things. I googled bird bugs and stuff like that, and eventually I found that these things were not bed bugs but bird mites. <br /><br />Anyway, my point in all this is that even if you like animals, and you like birds and you don&#039;t want to keep bird babies from growing outside your window.... <strong>you must not allow bird babies to grow outside your window</strong>.<br /><br /><br /><div align="center"><em>Fin</em></div>

				Yeah, pigeon mites. I though more people knew about them.<br /><br />I&#039;m very sorry you guys had to go through that. I&#039;m getting the itchies just thinking about it. When I lived upstate in an old brownstone, they used to nest in some cavity in the wall (btw the interior wall and the facade), but thankfully I never got any buggers. It was a little unnerving hearing them make pigeon love while I was checking my email.

				right outside of my living room window is the fire escape.&nbsp; there was a tree limb close enough to it that squirrels were using the fire escape as a passage from the tree to wherever they go do their squirrel things.&nbsp; my girlfriend always had heathy snacks such as nuts and berries laying around, so i started hand feeding them since the window was in arms reach of my desk.&nbsp; i befriended a young squirrel who would eventually end up sitting on my desk and we would eat peanuts together.&nbsp; enough trust was built up that i was soon petting him.&nbsp; every day i seen him, he would come in on the desk and rub his head against my hand as a hello, and then we would share a few minutes munching together.&nbsp; it was so freakin&#039; cool.&nbsp; i went away on vacation for two weeks, and when i got home, i noticed he wasn&#039;t coming around anymore.&nbsp; as time went by, the tree was trimmed so it wasn&#039;t near the fire escape anymore.&nbsp; one day i looked out the window and saw the same squirrel on top of the trimmed tree staring at my window (i recognized the markings of the fur).&nbsp; never seen him again after that.&nbsp; our friendship lasted maybe a month, but it was so nice.&nbsp; no matter how rough of a day it was, those few minutes we shared at the end of the day were so relaxing and it just put the daily stress behind me.&nbsp; i don&#039;t think i&#039;d ever do anything like that again, but the memories of it is all i need to unwind sometimes.&nbsp; now i have a kitty-kat, but nothing would ever replace the memories of the squirrel...

				I resent that this thread has been moved to &quot;Random Gabble&quot; as opposed to &quot;Local Chat.&quot; If &quot;Bed Bug Discussion&quot; can remain in the local chat &amp; issues category, so should a thread about the issue of having pigeons build nests in one&#039;s Astoria apartment window and the bird mites that can result.

				Thanks for the stories.&nbsp; I enjoyed them both!<br /><br />And, I agree with essen -- why was this moved?

				If the op hadn&#039;t included the bird mite part, then it would have been random gabble, but I also think it should have stayed as local info.<br /><br />
