			A woman I recently met teaches Alexander Technique stuff in Manhattan, but would like to do a class locally. We think it'll start the first week of May, Wednesday nights around 7:30 pm for a little over an hour.<br /><br />She's particularly interested in having the class be moms and moms-to-be, but is open to other folks if they're interested. At the moment, the probably class-size is three, but she can take five more. Depending on class size, it'll cost between $20 and $25...<br /><br />if you want more info, email me/post here and I'll give you her phone number.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />alia<br />(queenalia@hotmail. com)

			I think most of us don't even know what Alexander technique is. What is it?

			...sort of a body re-education thing. you do really simple moves until your brain makes a pathway for it, and then you change the move enough that it breaks the brain habit.<br /><br />it's very relaxing, very centering, very low physical energy movement... (like, all the stuff i've ever done was ob my back, staring at the ceiling)... <br /><br />i bet you could google for it to find out more. :)
