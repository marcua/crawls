				Ponticello Ristorante on Broadway has closed, after 34 years.&nbsp; It was a classic Northern Italian restaurant with super friendly service.&nbsp; &nbsp;I hate this term, but it really was old school.&nbsp; They closed on January 4th, but i just heard about it.<br />From their website:<br /><blockquote>Dear friends,<br />On Sunday, January 3rd, Ponticello will open and close its doors for the last time. We cherish the relationships we have built with all of you. We owe our success to you, our loyal friends. It has been a joy to call you friends and to serve you. We always felt like you were our family. Our goal has always been to make you feel like youâ€™re stepping into the house of a friend when you came through our doors. Judging from the relationships we have built, over the years, we are confident we achieved our goal.<br />Thank you from the bottom of our hearts,<br />&nbsp;Luigi and Joe and the boys of Ponticello Ristorante</blockquote>

				It is sad news, in a sense.&nbsp; It&#039;s another part of the history of Astoria that is moving on.&nbsp; It&#039;s also indicative of these &quot;old school&quot; spots that have no good reason to stay old school, other than that&#039;s the way they&#039;ve always been. <br /><br /><br />With that said, I am pretty sure the owners of the restaurant also own the land/building.&nbsp; They must have decided that they&#039;d rather sell the site for tens of millions of dollars, instead of killing themselves to keep the restaurant going.&nbsp; I would expect to see this turned into an apartment building in the near future.
