			Besides Astoria Park, I&#039;d love to know opinions on other parks in the neighborhood. Is there a particularly attractive and safe park for toddlers (just starting to walk)? Also, the 38th and Broadway park, I&#039;ve noticed has a lot of big kids and can be loud...is there a time of day that might be better for a small child just learning to move around?<br /><br />Thanks

			I am not a mom, but I live right by the park (name is escaping me) on the corner of 31st street and Astoria Blvd., just down the stairs from the N/W Astoria Blvd Station. This park has two playgrounds. One for younger kids (I&#039;ve seen toddlers on the slides and such) and one for slightly older kids. There are separate swings as well. There is also handball courts and basketball courts for teens, adults, but I&#039;ve never seen any problems there whatsoever and I walk through there everyday at all different times. There is also a water dragon in the summer! It may be worth checking out.

			If you have a car there is a park on northern Blvd and 86th? There is a 7/11 across&nbsp; the street and they have several age appropriate playgrounds. It&#039;s right by a toyota dealership.

			During the day the park on Steinway just off of Ditmars is a good solution for kids. It isn&#039;t a park with grass, etc., but it does have a playground. In the night / evening, I wouldn&#039;t recommend it as much because the lighting over there is terrible and it usually goes to the teenagers and occasionally a homeless guy (although I don&#039;t know if he still goes there).

			The best time of day to be at any park without a lot of big kids is during school - morning till about 2ish.&nbsp; After that, you&#039;re going to have bigger kids who need to blow off some steam.&nbsp; Of course, there might be some larger or rowdier (sometimes my 3 year-old can get crazy at the playground) preschooler at any time of day.....<br /><br />For toddlers, I recommend the playground at Queensview at 34th ave and crescent.&nbsp; It is &quot;private&quot;- it belongs to those who live there and is maintained by their groundskeepers, but many people go there from around that neighborhood.&nbsp; I don&#039;t live in Queensview, but I use that playground all the time.&nbsp; There are lots of &quot;just walking&quot; kids at all times of the day, nice, friendly parents.....&nbsp; &nbsp;
