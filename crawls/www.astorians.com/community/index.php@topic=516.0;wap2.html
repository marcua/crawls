			Just wanted to say hello and to introduce myself here to all of you. &nbsp;I will be moving to Astoria in early August from Long Island. &nbsp;LI is not my native area but I have been living there for the last four years studying music at Stony Brook University. &nbsp;Now that I've gotten my doctorate, I'm moving to Queens to be closer to the city's music scene. &nbsp;I'm a harpsichordist and erstwhile singer that plays and sings both early music and new music; I teach as well. &nbsp;I also love to eat and cook, and am really excited about the availability of good food and ingredients in Astoria. &nbsp;I run, bike, and swim, so Astoria Park looks fabulous. &nbsp;Don't own a car (I have lived on LI for 4 years without a car!) but walk and bike everywhere. &nbsp;I think Astoria will be a good place for me.<br /><br />Anyway, I look forward to exploring Astoria. &nbsp;Perhaps I will meet some of you at some point, too.<br /><br />Meg

			Welcome to the board. And make sure you say hello again once you move here.<br /><br />There's a very friendly crowd that hangs out at the Freeze Peach Cafe, on the corner of 29th St and Ditmars Blvd. You are welcome to stop by and say hello at any time.

			ya know, we should all write a couple sentences about who we are in real life on this thread. That would be kind of neat.

			I knew someone was going to say that. Okay, fair enough. <br /><br />I'm 28 (29 in a week!) and I've lived in Astoria for 7 years. I'm originally from outside Syracuse, NY. I just finished my Masters at Hunter College (phew!). I'm a professional cartographer for the City and I live in the Broadway area of Astoria with my husband. I'm nuts for Astoria and Long Island City and I have my own little website about them footed below. <br /><br />Your turn!
