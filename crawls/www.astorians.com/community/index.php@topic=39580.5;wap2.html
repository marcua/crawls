You don&#039;t make the rules or tell people what they can post about.&nbsp; Treat others with respect - you&#039;re violating the terms of the website - re-read the agreement you signed when getting your account.<br /><br />--- End quote ---<br />I&#039;m not violating any rule. i am voicing my opinion that this type of discourse has no place on a &quot;Local Chat&quot; board.
