			Please explain how/why some threads are thumbtacked... while others aren&#039;t. <br /><br />I can&#039;t figure out the logic.&nbsp; Why is looking for beer, vegan food and fresh direct coupons more important than a tailor, hair dresser or laundromat? <br /><br />

			If you don&#039;t understand why beer is more important than laundromats then I don&#039;t know what we have to say to each other. <br />&nbsp;

			Thumbtacks are &quot;sticky&quot; topics persistent at the top of the forum.&nbsp; Some are more relevant than others I suspect.<br /><br />Hello &lt;&lt; good example of relevant, well used one.<br /><br />Beer and Ethical Consumerism are my favorites.&nbsp; I might be bias :)<br /><br />It seems like there should be others thumbtacked as well as they come up often -- dentists, doctors, vets, parking -- but I don&#039;t know how to sticky everything that seems relevant and not have the page look cluttered.&nbsp; I suppose eventually some of them will get &quot;unsticky&quot; as the subject becomes less popular.&nbsp; Beer might be going that route.

			It seems as if certain threads get stickied because of board member requests.&nbsp; jennifer, is there something not already stickied that you think should be?

Isn&#039;t shopping via Fresh Direct - the antithesis of ethical consumerism???&nbsp; All that fuel and those cardboard packing boxes????&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />
