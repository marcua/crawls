				Hi everyone--<br /><br />I'm not an Astorian YET, but I'm hoping to be in the next six weeks or so.<br />MRM from Freeze Peach (though I've known him for a while outside of that) directed me here, saying you guys were a helpful and friendly bunch. Prove him right? <br /><br />I'm looking for a 2 bedroom apartment in Astoria for my roommate and I. We're both employed full-time and are responsible, clean, pay bills on time, etc. PLUS we're interesting and friendly and have fantastic taste in home decorations/renovations so you can trust us to get/keep/leave the apartment looking lovely. We have no pets right now, and if we can't have any in your place, that's ok with us. We're looking for a long-term lease, hoping to find a place for around $1300/mo. No fee would be great, but we can deal with a low-fee place too. <br /><br />Got anything we might like? Or know a friend of a friend of a friend who might? Please comment here or email me at purplecurlygirl [at] gmail [dot] com. Thanks in advance!!

				I have a big experience in apartment rent. Due to my job, i'm traveling all around the world for ten years. And many times i had to find apartments for short or long periods of time. And the only advise for you purplecurlygirl :)- use internet (www.google.com always helps). For example i searched apartment for rent (http://www.4rentinla.com) in LA some time ago- and it was so easy. Such kind of web sites always offer options (apartment size, price, photos etc, etc, etc..). Use google, search for apartment and be happy...<br /><br />Good luck<br /><br />-------------<br />Marti
