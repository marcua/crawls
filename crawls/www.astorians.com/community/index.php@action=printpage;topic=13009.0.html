				Hello Astorians!<br /><br />My job has sent me to Galveston, TX for the next several months as part of the response to Hurricane Ike.&nbsp; I miss my fiance a lot, so she&#039;s moving down here, ASAP.&nbsp; We are looking to sublet our one-bedroom apartment from December 1 to May 1, &amp; it may be available for longer than that (depending on how long it takes to clean up after the hurricane).&nbsp; <br /><br />Our apartment is located on the ground floor of a four-story apartment building on a quiet street near PS 122.&nbsp; There is a grocery store about two blocks away.&nbsp; A laundromat is located around the corner on Ditmars Blvd.&nbsp; We are a brisk 7-minute walk from the Ditmars Blvd stop on the N/W (with another grocery store located there), and about two blocks from the north end of Astoria Park.&nbsp; Ditmars Blvd. and 31st Street offer a variety of shops &amp; restaurants.<br /><br />Our apartment has a total of four rooms.&nbsp; The bedroom has two large windows as well as a queen size memory foam bed.&nbsp; We will empty the bedroom closet for your use.&nbsp; The living room is outfitted with a large TV and pull-out futon that can sleep two guests. We have a full kitchen with all the amenities and a decently sized bathroom to boot.&nbsp; This apartment would be great for a single person or a couple.&nbsp; Rent is $1,300/month which includes water, gas, wireless internet, &amp; electricity (but not cable).&nbsp; A $1,300 deposit is required and will be returned to you at the end of the sublet.&nbsp; You can contact me with questions, or you can contact my fiance Shannon directly (shannonward@gmail.com) for photos or to set up a viewing.
