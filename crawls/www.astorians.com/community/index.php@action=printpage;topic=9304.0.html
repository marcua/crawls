				So it&#039;s cold and I live with other freelancers and I want to go somewhere to get some writing done during the day. When I lived on the other side I&#039;d go to Waltz. Now I&#039;m on Steinway @ 30th and I&#039;m looking for some personal refs. on places to go around here that won&#039;t be too distracting, yet I won&#039;t feel guilty for sitting for 2-3 hours. Coffee helps.<br /><br />Suggestions?<br /><br />I know there is Esparks, but I&#039;ve never tried to work there. Have you? And there is the new cafe on Steinway and 28th that rumors to have kick ass margaritas and wifi, but I haven&#039;t checked it out myself and I don&#039;t know about writing there. <br /><br />Please don&#039;t say Starbucks.

				If you want quiet, Esparks has comfortable chairs-as long as you buy a coffee from them, they&#039;ll leave you alone. I have seen them throw out after-school kids and anyone else who just wants to sit down, wait for a ride, chat with friends, etc... I tend to like the noisier places, it helps me to concentrate by having all that ruckus in the background and would love to hear recommendations from people as well. Right now, my favorite place is <strong>Omonia</strong> (31st Ave and 34th? st). They are very slow in service (i.e. they leave you alone) and the coffee is great. My husband and I will go there during the weekends/afternoons to write for 3 hours at a time. I&#039;ve seen people sit there nursing one drink for even longer. The only thing I don&#039;t think they offer is wi-fi, but you can check. I&#039;m old school with the paper and pen, so I go there computerless.

				I like going to a bar the way the classic writers did&nbsp; :wink: Sometimes I&#039;ll ask the bartender for a piece of paper, and write stuff on the back of a Guest Check (got very small handwriting so it works.) Having a glass of wine helps get past the writer&#039;s block as I stare at the blank page.<br /><br />Unless it&#039;s late on a Saturday night (not when I do my writing anyway!) there&#039;s just the right amount of ambient noise but not to the point of distraction.
