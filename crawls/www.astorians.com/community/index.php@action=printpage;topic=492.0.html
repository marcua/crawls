				I promised someone, somewhere, that I'd link my review of Mundo here, but I can't find the thread. It's live now just below the fold.<br /><br />http://astorianyc.blogspot.com/

				Mundo was awesome. after reading some words on the place in here i was expecting not much by way of choices (meats that is)<br /><br />The choices were exceptional. <br />&nbsp;The eggplant dip was smokey and very well balanced with mint and cinnimon???<br />&nbsp;empanadas (one with meat and one veg) were terrific. excellent flavors and the dough was flaky and perfect.<br />&nbsp;the meat dumplings with yogurt had a nice luxurious feel and nicely spiced. &nbsp;it was lacking in the meat department but i will overlook this because the whole meal was a winner.<br /><br />service slow, candles on table not lit and it was dark in there but maybe because they were worried about it getting too hot. very very clean establishment. very good light varied and healthy menu.<br /><br />I highly suggest the neighborhood pour in and support this place.
