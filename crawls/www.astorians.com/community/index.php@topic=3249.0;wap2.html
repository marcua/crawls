			hi. i can&#39;t deal with a dirty roommate, i&#39;m ready for a real apartment with art, food, etc... <br /><br />i&#39;m looking for someone who needs a roommate to take a room in his/her apartment, or needs me to chip in on a 2br or 3br. i&#39;m 29, vegetarian, asian, i&#39;m easy-going but clean, and i need a clean roommate too. no pets, but i like them. i don&#39;t watch much tv, i listen to music (at about the same volume). i don&#39;t smoke cigarettes, and i need a roommate who doesn&#39;t either. i like sharing things and like to cook so generally i give more than i take. i need somewhere to park my bicycle. i can give first and last month&#39;s rent, a credit report, emplyoment verification, and references from roommates and my last landlord. i&#39;m never late. i&#39;m looking to move in between now and 10/1. i can commit to 12 months. i&#39;m really easy to get along with, and it&#39;s important for me that my roommate is responsible but cool.<br /><br />i freelance teach, volunteer, and sing, so my schedule isn&#39;t set, but my weekday schedule is something like this: leave house 7:30am 3-4 days/wk, leave house 11am 1-2 days/wk; finish work 7pm 2-3 days/wk, finish 11pm 2-3 days/wk. weekends i don&#39;t work. i like having guests over once a week or so, usually one at a time, occasionally to sleep. i have a girlfriend but she lives in korea so she won&#39;t be visiting anytime soon (februray at the earliest). <br /><br />i don&#39;t myspace but you can see pictures of me on my profile in an online community for hosting travellers: http://www.couchsurfing.com/profile.html?id=BMHVJU.<br /><br />hope you can call me soon. thanks!<br /><br />david<br />347-665-5976
