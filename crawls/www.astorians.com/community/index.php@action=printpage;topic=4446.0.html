				** a slanted historical view, but it ends on a very helpful note&nbsp; :? **<br /><br />http://washingtontimes.com/commentary/20061212-110845-8266r.htm<br /><br />Libertarian GOP defection?<br />By Bruce Bartlett<br />THE WASHINGTON TIMES<br /><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />For many years, those who consider themselves libertarians have been <br />fairly reliable members of the Republican coalition. Though no <br />libertarian would consider himself or herself to be entirely in <br />agreement with either major party, they have historically sided with <br />the GOP. But the relationship today seems more deeply strained than <br />any time in the last 30 years and a divorce may be forthcoming. <br />Basically, libertarians are allied with the right on economic <br />issues and the left on everything else. They believe in the free <br />market and freedom of choice in areas such as drugs, and favor a <br />noninterventionist foreign policy. A libertarian could prefer to <br />ally with the right or the left, depending on what issues is most <br />important to him or her. <br />I first became aware of the libertarian philosophy in 1969 when <br />there was a big split in a college-based group called Young <br />Americans for Freedom, which was supposed to be the right-wing <br />alternative to the left&#39;s Students for a Democratic Society. The <br />libertarians broke with those who considered themselves <br />traditionalists -- conservatives in the tradition of Edmund Burke <br />and Russell Kirk. <br />The problem for the libertarians was they didn&#39;t want to <br />conserve anything. Whereas the conservatives prized order and <br />continuity, the libertarians were radicals favoring change. The <br />traditionalists in YAF viewed the libertarians with horror, like the <br />Jacobins of the French Revolution who destroyed the existing order <br />without putting anything in its place, leading to a reign of terror. <br />The libertarians countered by associating themselves with the <br />American revolutionary tradition of Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry <br />and others. The true conservative, they argued, must defend both the <br />bad and the good in the existing order. But what if there are deep <br />problems in government and society that require change? The <br />conservative traditionalist has little to offer. <br />In 1969, the key issue was obviously the Vietnam War. The <br />traditionalists supported it, the libertarians opposed it. But drugs <br />were also an important issue dividing the groups. Libertarians <br />believe people have the right to do what they want with their own <br />bodies, even if they hurt themselves in the process. Traditionalists <br />take a more Puritanical approach, believing people must be protected <br />against their own folly. <br />Consequently, when I first became acquainted with <br />libertarianism, most libertarians tended to associate with those on <br />the left, where they had more in common. But with the end of the <br />Vietnam War and the huge rise of inflation and other economic <br />problems in the 1970s, libertarians mostly tended to drift <br />rightward. <br />In the 1970s, the left was clueless about how to fix the <br />economy. They had no idea what was causing inflation and insisted on <br />dealing instead with its symptoms through wage-and-price controls. <br />The left was also highly sympathetic to socialism and often favored <br />nationalization of businesses like the Penn Central Railroad when <br />bankruptcy threatened. <br />The right at least understood that excessive money growth by the <br />Federal Reserve caused inflation and that socialism and <br />nationalization were crazy. So most libertarians moved into the <br />Republican Party, which then had leaders like Barry Goldwater and <br />Ronald Reagan who spoke their language and had libertarian <br />sympathies. <br />With the passing of the older generation of Republican leaders <br />that were at least sympathetic to the libertarian message, a new <br />generation of Puritans have taken over the party. They seem to want <br />nothing more than to impose Draconian new laws against drugs, <br />gambling, pornography and other alleged vices. <br />The new Republican Puritans don&#39;t trust people or believe they <br />have the right to do as they please as long as it doesn&#39;t hurt <br />anyone else. They want the government to impose itself on peoples&#39; <br />lives and deny them freedom of choice. <br />At the same time, the Iraq war has aroused the isolationist <br />impulse among libertarians. Only a tiny number of them supported the <br />war in the first place and they have all now recanted. Moreover, <br />Republicans have lost whatever credibility they once had on <br />economics by indulging in an orgy of spending and corruption, and by <br />becoming very unreliable allies on issues such as free trade and <br />government regulation of the economy. <br />Consequently, many libertarians are drifting back once again to <br />the left, where they find more compatible allies on some of the key <br />issues of the day. And a few on the left are reaching out to <br />libertarians, at least trying to open a dialogue where there really <br />hasn&#39;t been one for a long time. <br />Libertarians probably don&#39;t represent more than 10 percent of <br />the electorate at most and are easy for political consultants to <br />ignore. But they are represented in much larger percentages among <br />opinion leaders and thus have influence disproportionate to their <br />numbers. Republicans will miss them if they leave the party en <br />masse. <br /><br />Bruce Bartlett is a nationally syndicated columnist.
