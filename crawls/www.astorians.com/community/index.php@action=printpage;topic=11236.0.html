				NYC Transgender Shelter Says Director Attacked<br /><br />NEW YORK (AP)&nbsp; -- A priest who runs a shelter specializing in outreach to homeless transgender youths was beaten with construction equipment and paint cans by a group of teenagers in a possible hate crime, authorities said Tuesday.<br /><br />Two 17-year-olds and a 16-year-old were awaiting arraignment Tuesday on charges of assault and criminal possession of a weapon, Queens prosecutors said. A 15-year-old was being charged as a juvenile in the Monday attack outside the Carmen&#039;s Place shelter, prosecutors said.<br /><br />The four boys gathered in front of Carmen&#039;s Place around 10 p.m. and started harassing and taunting the residents with homophobic slurs and insults, people at the shelter said. The director, the Rev. Louis Braxton Jr., tried to intervene but was attacked with paint cans, a woodworking tool and other objects found along the street, they said.<br /><br />Braxton, 52, was treated at a hospital for cuts and bruises. A shelter resident also was injured in the attack, which occurred on one of the main thoroughfares in the Astoria neighborhood.<br /><br />Braxton spoke about the attack on Tuesday.<br /><br />``Unfortunately, violent attacks against transgender youth is not unusual,&#039;&#039; he said. ``What made this incident so disturbing is that it occurred on a congested and busy New York City street.&#039;&#039;<br /><br />The incident was being investigated by the police Hate Crimes Task Force, and charges could be upgraded if it&#039;s found a hate crime took place.<br /><br />Carmen&#039;s Place first was established by a missionary named Carmen Solis in the basement of St. Andrew&#039;s Episcopal Church, where Braxton was pastor. The shelter provides beds and food for youths who have been kicked out of their homes or turned to prostitution.<br /><br />When the parish closed in 2007 because of financial trouble, Braxton rented a nearby two-bedroom apartment for the shelter, which currently houses about a dozen transgender youths.<br /><br />The nonprofit runs on a shoestring budget and relies on donations.<br /><br />Shelter spokesman Reggie Johnson said residents there often are harassed and the attack on Braxton is the latest in a string. He said the shelter is working with community leaders and the local police precinct to help make the area safer for residents.<br /><br />http://www.1010wins.com/NYC-Transgender-Shelter-Says-Director-Attacked/2559207 (http://www.1010wins.com/NYC-Transgender-Shelter-Says-Director-Attacked/2559207)

				Thanks for sharing.&nbsp; This is really sad to hear.&nbsp; The link to Carmen&#039;s Place website is below:<br /><br />http://www.carmensplace.org/events.html<br /><br />&amp; the link to an article from the NY Times<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/02/nyregion/02shelter.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin<br /><br />Places like this are needed for LBGT youth because they are so often abandoned by family and victimized on the streets.&nbsp;

				This is very distressing news and I hope Father Braxton is ok.&nbsp; He&#039;s a good man and they work hard for LGBT youth.&nbsp; I hope the police are able to help stop the ongoing harassment.&nbsp; As Astorialuv noted, there are few shelter beds and these services are very desperately needed.

				This makes my blood boil, I can&#039;t believe people would beat up a priest- let alone one that actually devoted his life to helping troubled people instead of just talking about it every Sunday. I hope these punks get the prison shower treatment. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=11236.msg138557.html#msg138557">Quote from: Jiggs on July 09, 2008, 12:02:41 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;m glad priest is o.k., but I don&#039;t buy the idea that transgender teens need to be told they are o.k.&nbsp; They aren&#039;t.&nbsp; They don&#039;t deserve getting beat up, so don&#039;t anyone imply I&#039;m saying that.&nbsp; But they do have a mental problem, I don&#039;t care what politically correct view is popular on it either.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gay is one thing, but deciding at any age, let only as young as 14, to change your sex is another.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Regardless of whatever your ethical qualms with their chosen lifestyle may be, what this priest was doing was not spending time promoting any lifestyle. He was taking in homeless transgender and gay youths who would otherwise be without anybody or on the street performing sex acts to get money to survive. If you actually read what they do (http://www.carmensplace.org/mission.html) they also provide psychological counseling and social work for these kids. A lot of them are troubled teens, who are saved from the streets. <br />I guarantee you a lot of these teens were forced to the street by their ignorant bigot parents with pathetic homophobia complexes. It&#039;s so disgusting how people can be treated for their sexual orientation. It doesn&#039;t matter whether someone agrees with it or not, let people live their lives as who they are.

				No one is saying they don&#039;t have a right to be heard.&nbsp; But you do seem to care more about the four minors that are currently in jail, than the many minors who are on the streets or in shelters because of their gender/sexual identity.&nbsp; It&#039;s also pretty interesting how the issue seems to disturb you so much.&nbsp; As you said...if you don&#039;t like it, fine.&nbsp; But who are you to say that it&#039;s &quot;not okay?&quot;&nbsp; And isn&#039;t it a bit presumptuous to assume that just because they are transgender, they want to have a sex change operation?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Why is it that heterosexuals are never described as having chosen their lifestyle?<br /><br />I know no offense is meant but can we for once stop saying “lifestyle” and “chosen lifestyle” when referencing gay, lesbian, bi, or transgendered people: They are who they are -- it’s not a matter of choice.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=11236.msg138577.html#msg138577">Quote from: Jiggs on July 09, 2008, 01:53:15 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I only mentioned the four minors arrested once, in last post.&nbsp; And I think transgender is different than transsexual, maybe i&#039;m mistaken.&nbsp; One (the fight) has nothing to do with the other ( definition of transgender)</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If four teenagers (two 17-year-olds, a 16- and a 15-year-old who are in my opinion old enough to know better) were hanging outside a senior citizen housing facility and harassing and taunting it’s residents, and then assaulted someone who worked there would any sympathy be spared? Would you be so generous and say “poor them” and ask people to wait to hear their side of the story? What if they did it in front of your house and were harassing you? Why does being transgendered in any way mitigate what they did? <br /><br />Yes the full story will come out and I hope these kids will be judged accordingly but it seems to me that they were looking for trouble and found some.<br /><br /><br />

				This is really upsetting. How unprovoked violence could be anything other than wrong is beyond me. What they will really need in the coming weeks is more support from the community. As the Father is healing likely they will need help with some of the day to day details that he took care of. <br /><br />Im not here to get into it with anyone (that is not what this thread is about) ... but gender association and sexual orientation are 2 very different things. Trangender issues are very complicated and usually do not have anything to do with sexual preference.

				Why is it that when a woman wears a man&#039;s clothes (say, her boyfriend&#039;s underwear or pants) she&#039;s seen as normal, confident, or even &quot;sexy&quot; but the reverse is not true? If a man does the same many assume he&#039;s gay, mental, insecure in himself, or dangerous.<br /><br />I believe it&#039;s because there&#039;s this idea out there that when men aspire to femininity it is demeaning for them, but the reverse not true for women. It&#039;s seen as desirable, confident, or even sexy for women to express a broader gender spectrum.<br /><br />I for one reject the idea that femininity is somehow inferior or demeaning for a man to aspire to (of course I also feel the reverse is true). Both men and women will benefit greatly once society resolves this inconsistency.

				Back to the OP, I&#039;d just like to state for the record that I don&#039;t believe in hate crimes. I think unprovoked violence, whether it&#039;s ethnically motivated or against a member of your own race, should be punished equally under the law, and I say that as a minority. Sure, it makes me more angry, because it seems like a stupider motive, but senseless violence is what it is.

				I will start by saying...this is only my opinion, based on my upbringing and my schooling.<br /><br />i agree with the posting about people fearing what they do not know. <br /><br />Jiggs...<br />I know that you might think that you know what you are talking about concerning transgender issues. However, if you really would like to know more about it, I would be happy to recommend some books to you. There is quite a lot of amazing anthropological and sociological literature out there on Gender in cross-cultural perspective, global variations in Gender, constuction of Gender etc. <br /><br />It is common in this country to want to put everyone and everything into a nice little category with a label. It makes many feel safe.<br />But the reality of life is that we have as many options as we can realize for ourselves. <br />Gender is so fluid in many places in this world...if you look back through history (even Native American history) , it was fluid then as well. <br /><br />My mother always told me, &quot;You have the most to learn from those that are different than you.&quot; <br /><br /><br />

				Holy hell. Over a dozen homeless, broke teenagers living in a 2 bedroom Astoria apt turned shelter. Not to sound completely rediculous, but I wonder if they stated that on the lease. <br />Who cares if it was a preist who got hurt. Who cares if the kids the man was defending are trans-anything, or what team they play on. Who cares how old any of them were. <br />A hanful of humans were in front of their building, where they have every right to be. Another handful of human beings approached and disrespected them. A third party human being, who was also on his home property, intervened in the name of peace, and got beat up.<br />that would be considered wrong, ask any kindergarden teacher. <br />My opinion, kids will be kids. I don&#039;t know how I feel about them going to jail, juvie, community service, etc. I say, get a photo of the priest with the lonely band aide on his finger, and not a scratch on his face, and pass it out to everyone in their school/neighborhood/family/friends, and let them get made fun of incessently for failing to even remotely injure the man, even though it was 4 of them, weilding makeshift &#039;weapons&#039; against the one guy, who happens to be a man of peace. That seems like a punishment they deserve. LEt them see how it feels to be laughed at, mocked, alienated constantly by something they did not intend to become a huge deal. Maybe once they have something in common with the kids at Carmen&#039;s Place, they would refrain from attacking innocent people.<br />About those kids at Carmen&#039;s Place, I can see how one might think they need psychological help. But, isn&#039;t that what they were getting there? They get a bed, some food, and psychiatric help. Maybe Jiggs believes psychiatrists slap their patients and say &#039;WTF is wrong with you, be normal!&#039; but I think most people know that&#039;s not what happens. Who cares if they do need psychiatric help, everyone does at some point in their lives! <br />But seriously, a dozen teens in a 2 bedroom apt!? I say Astorians.com fundraiser for Carmen&#039;s Place! I don&#039;t know how to organize that type of thing. Anyone? McDirk don&#039;t you rock at that? I pledge $20! Who&#039;s with me!?

Father Lewis Braxton, director of<br />Carmen&#039;s Place, was attacked in front of the shelter by four teenaged<br />boys on Monday night after stepping in to defend one of the residents<br />of the shelter who was being harassed and threatened.<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m shocked that this happened on such a busy street,&quot; said Father<br />Braxton.&nbsp; &quot;This speaks to the need for a real conversation about the<br />safety of trans people in this city.&quot;<br /><br />With somewhere between 20 and 40 percent of homeless youth identifying<br />as LGBT and statistics showing that LGBT youth are 3 to 5 times more<br />likely to commit suicide, this shelter meets an essential need.&nbsp; These<br />young people, many of whom have been thrown out of their homes, depend<br />on safe havens like Carmen&#039;s Place and Generation Q to fulfill their<br />emotional, psychological and social needs, and in the case of those<br />without homes, their most basic needs.<br /><br />The youth at Generation Q would like to take this opportunity, while<br />there is a spotlight on the homophobic assaults in Queens, to speak<br />directly to the media and public about the dangers they face daily and<br />the need for hate crimes law, school-based initiatives such as Dignity<br />for All Students Act (DASA) that focus on prevention of hate crimes as<br />well as interventions of identity-based bullying, and funding for safe<br />havens like Carmen&#039;s Place and Generation Q.<br /><br />&quot;This attack is not isolated or an aberration&quot; states Marisa Ragonese,<br />the director of Generation Q.&nbsp; &quot;Our youth come in here frequently with<br />stories of being spit on, chased, harassed, or hit as they travel from<br />the train less than 2 full blocks away to Generation Q.&quot;<br /><br />In response to the harassment that LGBT teens have been reporting for<br />years and the city and state&#039;s failure to implement the (DASA),<br />Generation Q facilitates workshops, free of charge, to schools,<br />after-school programs, and community spaces on homophobia, hate<br />speech, confronting harassment, and developing anti-slur policies.<br />They also strive to create a safe space for LGBT and allied youth<br />facing discrimination, harassment, and assault on a regular basis.<br /><br />However, attacks such as this one further demonstrate that there is a<br />great need for increased services to protect this vulnerable<br />population.&nbsp; More resources would allow community-based organizations<br />to keep drop-in centers open for longer, and open them in more<br />locations, as well as the opportunity to provide educational,<br />leadership, and social services for the hundreds of youth in the<br />city&#039;s largest and most diverse borough.<br /><br />&quot;I shouldn&#039;t have to feel afraid to walk down the street with my<br />partner because of people who don&#039;t want to accept homosexuality,&quot;<br />says Shanel Ford, a 17 year-old Astoria resident who works at<br />Generation Q.<br /><br />####

				All,<br />&nbsp; This thread is getting pretty heated, but I wanted to chime in on both sides of the issue.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;My question to everyone here is why is there even a class of crime that is deemed to be a <strong>&quot;hate&quot;</strong> crime.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;A crime is a crime is a crime...<br />&nbsp; Why should one group expect preferential treatment under the law and, somehow, think that a crime against them is more serious than a crime against others?&nbsp; An assault on an <strong>individual</strong> is, indeed, heinous, but why should the gender orientation/race of the victim be an issue?&nbsp; The crime occurred and should be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest--regardless of whom was victimized. <br />&nbsp;I am a white heterosexual male and have been assaulted several times by people of my race, as well as, those that are of a different race.&nbsp; In my early twenties, half a lifetime ago, I was even assaulted and beaten by a group of bat-wielding lesbians.&nbsp; Was I a victim of a <strong>hate</strong> crime?&nbsp; Hell, no!&nbsp; I was just a college kid in the wrong place at the wrong time.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;For what it is worth, I also was homeless for a brief period as a youth, because of the &quot;life-style&quot; choices that I made that alienated me from my family.&nbsp; My crime, in my family&#039;s eyes, was that I was punk musician from the Midwest that had no interest in going to college--I was aberrant .&nbsp; How is this different than being &quot;LGBT&quot;?&nbsp; After all, due to my &quot;hillbilly&quot; genetic background (from my maternal lineage--all master players), I was genetically predisposed to be a musician.&nbsp; Should musicians and artists also be, equally, protected by <strong>hate</strong> crime laws?&nbsp; I was once beaten senseless by a throng of White Skinheads in Ohio,&nbsp; because I dared to play a synth in one of their clubs.&nbsp; Was this a &quot;HATE&quot; Crime?<br />&nbsp; Again an assault is an assault is an assault.&nbsp; There are no hate crimes--just crimes against an <strong>individual</strong><br />&nbsp; Americans, of all stripes, creeds and colors, must accept that there are certain ramifications about the choices that they make in their day to day lives.&nbsp; They can&#039;t keep buying in to victimhood, and expect the federal government to legislate tolerance/acceptance of their agenda.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; Anyone here have a good OED definition of the word &quot;tolerance&quot;?<br /><br />-+:Astoristani:+-<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				First off, I agree with many of astoriani&#039;s sentiments.<br /><br />Second, I just wanted to tell Jiggs that I am not interested in judging him, but learning more about his experiences and am honestly interested in examining his views as compared to mine.<br /><br />Jiggs--if you&#039;re up for it, PM me and I&#039;ll buy you a beer at Hell Gate on the Park and we can talk. I grew up in a very conservative Catholic environment and have views that are often very different from the majority. I have changed my mind because of my friends, but I still am open to other views. I would love to learn more about why you believe what you believe. I think that understanding another individual brings us closer to the idea of morality and why people are the way they are. And none of that is bad, no matter what you believe or what faith you practice.<br /><br />

I appreciate everything you’ve written in your post and agree with your opinion in principle because I too have a philosophical issue with the hate crime category that I have yet to reconcile. So please do not take this as me saying you are wrong and I am right. But I do remain on the fence about this issue.<br /><br />Because wouldn’t it be a wonderful world if everyone who has had a bat slammed over their head, had that bat swung by a criminal who was solely after the money in their wallet or handbag.<br /><br />And wouldn’t it also be a wonderful world if the victims of all attacks were afforded the same police attention and courtesy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, we don’t live in such a world and until we do, not all crimes are considered equal and I’ll make due with the hate crime label.<br />&nbsp;<br />Hate crimes were not enacted to give certain groups of people preferential treatment. The opposite is true in reality. They were enacted because victims of crimes from certain groups were ignored, dismissed, and worse, told they weren’t really victims of a crime. You can argue that was such treatment is equally wrong, but how do you address the problem if it’s ingrained institutionally? Yes all crimes should be equally pursued and investigated by the authorities but the truth is that often times they are not and until this factor can be addressed I’m staying on the fence, leaning in favor.<br /><br />Think of it this way, carried to an objective end one could argue that the crimes of rape and sexual assault should be dropped in favour of assault because an injury to a person is an injury no matter where on the body it occurs.<br /><br />I don’t make this argument by the way because in my opinion one’s sexuality (among other things) is essential to most people’s identity and who they are as a person – and that’s where the difference lies. Do we only measure only the bruising or broken limbs in regard to classifying the seriousness of an assault or is there room to factor in additional circumstances?<br /><br />I think there are other considerations. Categorizing a crime as a hate crime is a statement that we, as a society, take all crimes seriously no matter who is the victim and we will not accept criminals who single out and assault people solely based on who they are.<br /><br />And by the way: if you were assaulted by a group of lesbians solely because they were out to beat down a heterosexual male, then yes, I would say you were a victim of a hate crime. If you went to the police, made a complaint of assault and it was handled in a considered manner then I hope justice was served in the end by existing laws. But if by chance you were not taken seriously and laughed off for being beaten up by “a bunch a girls” How would you feel? And could you appreciate the added protection could help someone who was in a vulnerable position? <br />

				The punishment for a hate crime is more severe because the motivation for the attack is attacking someone for who they are. It&#039;s not a crime of passion, it&#039;s not a crime of necessity, it&#039;s a random act of violence bred from intolerance and hate. The reason we have punishments for crimes is to deter them (whether or not that works as a deterrent is another discussion). We have more extreme punishments for killing a cop than a civilian. Some people might not think that was fair. We have more extreme punishments for many crimes based on their severity and how much the legal system has decided they want to deter those crimes. After Matthew Shepard, the legal system changed to punish individuals more severely who beat and or kill LGBT people because they are who they are. I personally, am glad there are different punishments for different crimes. I don&#039;t think you getting into a bar fight is on par with someone getting beaten for being gay. There&#039;s really no way I could be convinced otherwise.

I think that a brutal beating is the same thing whether it was out of passion or racism. The point is to keep people who have the capacity to brutally beat somebody off the streets- I don&#039;t discern between a racist or a compulsive psychopath. I would not want either of them roaming my neighborhood. I understand the reasoning behind the hate crime label, but I don&#039;t want the doors open to variable punishment for what is technically the exact same crime. The severity of the occurrence, not the motive should determine the punishment. <br />Continuing on the Matthew Sheopard story, if anyone had done that exact same thing to anybody I know, no matter what the reasoning behind it, I would want them punished to the fullest extent of the law. I wouldn&#039;t want them punished any less than another person who decided to do it because their victim was homosexual.

				So if someone steals food from a store because they are hungry, they should get the same sentence as someone who is stealing food and re-selling the stolen food for a markup? The motive is extremely important in determining the sentence. And the point of the Matthew Shepard example is that the crime wouldn&#039;t have happened to anyone you knew if that person wasn&#039;t LGBT. Those people committed a murder specifically because he was gay. A crime of passion is much, much different from a random act of violence IMO and the sentencing should reflect that. Similar to how premediated murder is a much higher sentence than a spur of the moment homicide. It shows that you had the wherewithall to plan and carry out the act in a state rational enough to make plans and think things over.

				This is something i&#039;ve had some questions about before. <br /><br />It&#039;s tempting to say &quot;all crime is hate crime&quot;, but that&#039;s not quite true. Someone might steal to feed their family. Someone might commit physical assault or even murder to protect a family member. And some things happen by accident. Yes, it&#039;s wrong, tragic, and deserves penalty. But most of us can look at those examples and think - that could be me, if my family was hungry, if my child was attacked. <br /><br />Hate crime seems to take place as a kind of &quot;You belong to that group of people, so I can do whatever I want to do to you. You deserve it. You aren&#039;t quite human. You&#039;re asking for it. I&#039;m protecting my community/defending my way of life.&quot; There&#039;s almost an expectation that society won&#039;t punish the crime at all. Oh, you beat up one of THOSE guys - well, that&#039;s not such a big deal. <br /><br />I do wonder if it wouldn&#039;t be adequate to simply punish the crime for what it is. Or if we do perhaps need that underlining in the law to show that YES, we do protect all of our citizens. Not just the ones you like. I&#039;m assuming that some lesser crimes might be punished more lightly without the hate crime laws, and that there&#039;s a difference in how the system deals with Bob, who punches another guy because he said something about his momma, and Tom, who punches another guy because of who he is. <br /><br />I guess the answer is whether or not hate crime laws work - do they make a difference in future behavior for sentencees and do they make a difference in the way the community as a whole thinks about hate crimes?

				if only there wasn&#039;t a double standard in the definition of a hate crime. Remember when a couple of white males chased a man onto the belt and he was killed by a car, that was a hate crime because the attackers were chasing him because he was gay. But when the 2 black guys uptown beat this white guy senseless, while shouting racial slurs, that didn&#039;t count as a hate crime. Is the difference that the homosexual was killed but the white man lived? Because I think &#039;hate crime&#039; applies to the MO not just the extent of the crime, no?&nbsp;

To keep with the Matthew Shepard example, IF that had happened to a random person that somebody just plain didn&#039;t like, nothing to do with race or sexual orientation, do you think the perpetrator should be punished either more leniently or harshly?<br />I understand the pre-meditation aspect, and I agree with that because I don&#039;t think it falls under the same umbrella as racial motivation. As you said, it is used to gauge if the perpetrator could have been in an impaired mental state as opposed to thinking it through. If a spur of the moment fight breaks out, and it is racially prompted, it automatically becomes a hate crime. If two identical premeditated violent crimes occur, but one is racially motivated, it automatically gets the hate crime attachment to the charge. Yes, I <span class="bbc_u"><strong>hate</strong></span> racists and bigots, but I believe they should be afforded the same rights under the law.

I think shooting someone to defend your family is a completely different category altogether, and in my opinion should not equate to murder. <br /><br />My thing about the starving family example, although it seems intuitive to want to help people in trouble, it doesn&#039;t, in my eyes give them entitlement above the law. I feel terrible when people are put in a position where they are &quot;forced&quot; to commit a crime, but it&#039;s still a crime. We need the rules in place for a reason. I think that petty theft is really the only thing one would need to do to feed their starving family, and is usually very lightly punished. <br />I don&#039;t think that outside of the case of defending your family from a direct threat, that there is a case that killing someone is ever really applicable to the starving family example.

				Here&#039;s the problem killing to defend your family versus killing because you hate a race, gender identity or nationality is not the same as crime versus hate crime.<br /><br />Violence to defend someone else&#039;s life or your own has certain rules and restrictions, but self defense or defense of another tend to be considered valid exceptions to our rules against manslaughter and murder.<br /><br />The difference between a crime and a hate crime is killing someone who pisses you off in a bar because of something they did or said versus killing someone who pisses you off in a bar because of their race, gender identity or nationality.<br /><br />Stealing to feed your family versus stealing to line your own pockets is a closer analogy, but still not the same. A more appropriate analogy would be stealing from a store because you wanted what they had versus stealing from a store because you hated the guys who owned the store for their race, gender identity or nationality.<br /><br />In both cases, it&#039;s wrong. Either way. I don&#039;t think that the idea of a &quot;hate crime&quot; should actually deal with <strong>what someone is convicted for</strong>. Rather, I think that <strong>intent</strong>, in these cases, the deep-seated ideal of hate, should affect the sentencing of such individuals at discretion of the judge. I think over legislating what is or is not hate is not helping the battle for equality. By naming crimes as crimes, regardless of the perpetrator or the victim, I think society will actually end up closer to equality.<br /><br />But, hey, just my $.02.

				I just want to point out that:<br /><br />a) This thread hurts my soul<br /><br />and<br /><br />b) I can&#039;t believe that someone on this thread is referring to transgendered people as &quot;it.&quot; Are you that judgmental of someone else that you can&#039;t even consider them a human being?&nbsp; Or do you just not know how to refer to a transgendered person? In that case, FYI: Transgendered people generally prefer the pronoun of the gender that they identify with. If they do not identify with a gender, they will tell you the term.&nbsp; <br /><br />Jigg, you have such an eagerness to blame on the victims of the attacks- why do you do this?? There have been no accounts to the contrary, and yet, you seem completely unwilling to accept that the teens acted wrongly in attacking the transgendered youths and priest.&nbsp; &nbsp;Why are you so convinced that there&#039;s a differing story to be told here?&nbsp; I find it hard to believe that if it were any other group attacked, you would feel the same way.

Right now, it seems that your bias against transgender people is the only thing that is causing you to believe that the teens in question are not to blame. <br />If you can provide me with some shred of evidence that they are not to blame, just one- an account, a testimony, a <strong>reasonable doubt</strong>, then I will gladly concede that you <em>may</em> have a point.

But the kids did beat up a priest, and I have seen stuff like that in the newspaper pretty regularly. People are interested when it is something that outrages them personally, that&#039;s why the media prints it. When I saw a story about a mother neglecting her child in the paper the other day, it was interesting to me. There millions of kids neglected in this world every day- it didn&#039;t make that particular instance more or less wrong, but it was the point of discussion because that is the story I happened to hear about.

				I read further through the thread and I maust say, I am suprised. Suprised taht a member would spend so much time attacking a groupd of kids that are trying to find a safe place. <br /><br />I had a sweet girl that, while working for me, began the process of changing from female to male. He, as my mind thinks, was very open to me. Then again, knowing that I was gay, it was probably an easy conversation for him<br /><br />The funny thing is this, I think of him as him. It was a natural progression. It is strange to me that others would use the term &quot;it&quot;. It&#039;s much more complicated than that. <br /><br />I can&#039;t possibly post here the complete story....all I know is this. Someone I cared about was going through a process (yes, the term is mechanical...but only in words) and needed my support. <br /><br />And as I think back...one thing I am certain is this.....Kyle (his new name) is not an IT.<br /><br />

				Jiggs, I carefully read the post you find offended you and do not agree that the poster suggested and/or insinuated that you were advocating homicide or genocide.<br /><br />Paratactical, I don&#039;t want to go off topic and discuss a prior suspension, especially since I don&#039;t have any facts or actual knowledge about it and since hopefully moderating on this board is a bit different now.&nbsp; However, I will say that I do not find most of the responses to Jiggs posts to be &quot;more flagrant violations of the rules&quot; than him calling a member a &quot;jackass&quot;.&nbsp; The difference here for me is that if things got heated up on this thread (mods posted warnings 3 times) members took a step back while Jiggs, although he took a step back earlier in the thread, chose to step it up now and called someone a &quot;jackass&quot;.&nbsp; This coupled with the fact that he has been warned about violating the board rules from prior postings on other threads both publicly and privately is why I am suggesting a suspension now.<br /><br />In other news, I don&#039;t want this thread to go further off topic but I personally think it is important to elaborate on some of the actions a moderator(s) might take.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t lock the thread because I thought Jiggs might have something to say in response to my post and wanted him to have the opportunity to do so.&nbsp; I am not trying to set a precedent here.<br /><br />If we can get back on topic, let&#039;s do so.&nbsp; If no one else has anything to say about this topic then let&#039;s end it here.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />AJTNYC,<br />Moderator&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				It looks like we’ve come to the end of the road on this topic. Since no one has anything relevant to add it will be closed to further discussion. Contact one of the moderators by PM if you have any questions.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />28Grand, moderator<br />
