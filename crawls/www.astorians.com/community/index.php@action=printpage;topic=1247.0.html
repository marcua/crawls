				<span style="font-size: 24px;" class="bbc_size">SHINCO DVD-380 DVD Player! Secret Menu/ Region-Free/ NO Macrovision!: &nbsp;$99</span><br /><br />I bought this <strong><span style="font-size: 18px;" class="bbc_size">SHINCO DVD-380</span></strong> 3-disc DVD/ SVCD/ VCD/ CD/ MP3 player for myself, and received another DVD player as a present shortly thereafter. &nbsp;The REGION can be adjusted through a secret menu (which I can show you), and the MACROVISION can be switched on and off (although I have not figured out the Macrovision menu to test that function), as it is the same player as the Apex AD-703, but sold directly out of China, so it should not require a firmware hack. &nbsp;It is possible that Macrovision was never even installed on the unit, since it was not manufactured for sale in the U.S., in which case, no menu is necessary, though I'm not sure either way. &nbsp;Even if it does require a loophole upgrade, it can be found online, info. for which I can provide URLs. &nbsp;I can even provide printed documentation of URLs if necessary. &nbsp;It has both analog and digital hookups (S-Video and Digital Coaxial for sound), and loads of other features: &nbsp;multi-angle, 4x zoom, parent lock, even karaoke!!! As shown in the pictures, the remote control and instruction manual are in Chinese (on-screen display is in English or Chinese), all of which could be a good thing depending on your point of view, whether you speak Chinese, and if the special features this player offers appeal to you. &nbsp;I can also provide a printed English version instruction manual or the corresponding URL, and I have an English translation template for the remote, to boot. &nbsp;In any case, although I have not myself solved all its mysteries, the player is definitely functional as far as I have seen, which was to plug it in and make sure it powers up, but I have done nothing else with it, meaning it is in totally brand new condition! &nbsp;I'm even including the original box and styrofoam inserts! &nbsp;It is however a non-returnable item, as I have Christmas presents of my own to purchase, but this should with a little bit of attention be a seriously amazing gift for that special A/V geek in your life who doesn't like to be told what he can't watch or copy to tape!!! &nbsp;I purchased it for $250; yours for less than half that price at <strong>$99</strong>!!! &nbsp;Please do not hesitate to email me with any questions or call me at <strong>(504) 920-6235</strong>. &nbsp;Thanks!!!<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 24px;" class="bbc_size">PLEASE SEE MY CRAIGSLIST AD FOR THIS PLAYER FOR PHOTOS. &nbsp;THANKS!!!</span></strong><br /><br />http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/ele/116134888.html
