				My husband needs to take driver&#39;s ed here in New York. He knows how to drive relatively well but since we don&#39;t have a car and he has a lot of laws to learn, it&#39;ll be easier with a course. Can anyone recommend one?<br /><br />Thanks!

				Ferrari was good to me.&nbsp; Flexible scheduling of the sessions, if a little disorganized sometimes.&nbsp; I passed!

				Yep, I took drivers&#39; ed in high school. One of the guidance counselors was my teacher. My main memory of learning with her was when I was driving in the car with her and getting ready to turn out onto a busy, main road and she&#39;d tell me to just &quot;goose it and go!!&quot; To this day I still think &quot;goose it and go&quot; when doing that!

				my driver&#39;s ed wasnt&#39; thru the HS, but most of my classmates were at this program with me. i had this great polish woman who smoked marlboro reds like a truck driver and made us drive to cool places, like bagel stores, so that we could buy breakfast and she could stand outside and smoke. when you did something wrong (which when driving means dangerous) she would give us a &quot;cookie&quot; which was a swift slap on the back of the head! it works though. i paid careful attention after my first cookie and never got one again.
