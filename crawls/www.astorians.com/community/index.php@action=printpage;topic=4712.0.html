				Hello people,<br /><br />I&#39;m a 24 year old dutch Marketing Management student who&#39;s looking for long term accommodation on the east side of NYC.<br />I&#39;m going to work (do an internship) in Carle Place for 7 months, I think it would be nice to be close to manhattan where all the action is ;) And i don&#39;t mind to travel for about 35 minutes to work. I&#39;m beginning the internship around the 5th of February..<br /><br />I dont know alot about NYC yet and which places are cool but preferably a room near a J train.<br /><br />I&#39;m an outgoing person who likes to out in the weekends and have some fun, I like to work out and do some wakeboarding over here..<br /><br />I am looking for a room with an internet connection and perhaps cable (don&#39;t know what you guys are watching over there, i like prison break ;)).<br />Sharing an appartment or house with other students would be best, but as long as my roomies are cool and outgoing i&#39;m ok.<br />I don&#39;t want to spend more then 1k on my housing a month, but that should give me enough options..<br /><br />Since all this text doesnt give you a proper view of who I am.. here&#39;s a picture of me in Costa Rica.<br /><br />Send me a mail or reply if you have something for me!<br /><br />Cheers! <br /><br />(http://www.zesuurgeleden.com/me.jpg)

				Carle Place out in Nassau?<br />I don&#39;t think the drive would be that bad from Astoria, though further East in Queens might work better for you.&nbsp; Going East on the Grand Central in the morning shouldn&#39;t be bad, but parking is always hard, unless you&#39;re on a less busy block.

				since he mentioned he needs to be by the J train, i am guessing he is going to work downtown in the financial district.<br />you should look in downtown brooklyn or lower manhattan, astoria is in queens, a bit too north for what would be convienient.

				I took the W to whitehall for over a year. It was an hour commute but I got a lot of reading done.<br /><br />Other people I know with a similar commute transferred at Lex and had a much shorter commute. More like 30 minutes, I think.

				Carle Place isn&#39;t that far. I drive every day to Farmingdale and it only takes me 40 minutes.( on average- not including those days like Sundays and Mondays when the weekend idiots are still around) Anyway i digress. As to your buying a car....I would recommend renting a car since <br /><br />1) You need to provide proof of residency when buying a car in NYS( new york state)<br />2) You need several things when registering a car in nys<br /><br />check out this .pdf from the NYS DMV site:http://www.nydmv.state.ny.us/forms/id82.pdf (http://www.nydmv.state.ny.us/forms/id82.pdf)<br />&nbsp;It should clear things up a bit, but if it doesn&#39;t hit me up and I&#39;ll try and sort out the dirty details for you.
