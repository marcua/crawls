				38-50 21st Street<br />M - Sa 8 a.m. - 9:30 p.m.<br />Su till 8:30 p.m. <br /><br />phone number 718 707 0887<br />(no website, Facebook page seems to pertain to other locations &amp; be outdated)<br /><br /><br /><br />Formerly the site of Pep Boys<br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t get out and about often, so this place was in business for a few months before I even knew it was there.&nbsp; I was passing by in a car as a passenger so I couldn&#039;t get out to investigate, and I already have my preferred places to shop.&nbsp; Recently I checked for reviews on line, that&#039;s how I knew it was open longer than I would have guessed.&nbsp; Most of the reviews were very favorable, but one person hoped they would increase their security because he or she observed a number of people exiting the store without paying.&nbsp; Considering how close it is to the Queensbridge Housing Project, that&#039;s not a hopeful sign.<br /><br /><br />Looking through a backlogged accumulation of store flyers I realized they&#039;ve been sending out flyers for a while, but I don&#039;t think anyone from Astorians has mentioned going to this store.&nbsp; The flyers show famous brand names, and Krasdale products.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried Krasdale foods on 3 different occasions years apart and consider it a hallmark of pure crap.&nbsp; Reviews by shoppers that sounded believable praised their fresh produce, meats, and fish departments.&nbsp; One of these days, when the weather is nice, I&#039;ll go over with my shopping cart, but if you have an air conditioned car, they have parking.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping someone else will go and tell us what you think and what you&#039;re comparing it to.&nbsp; As an incentive, I guess, their flyers boast smoothies &amp; fruit salads.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Store represents everything bad about 5 boroughs supermarkets. Crappy location, poor product selection. This is literally why there is a complete overhaul of supermarkets and food providers in the city. Newcomers to the city would not believe the 3rd world level of our supermarkets 20 years ago.

				I finally got over to Green Apple today.&nbsp; Unless you live in the Queensbridge area, the only reason to go there is to stock up on frozen gyoza, shu mai, and Chinese buns.&nbsp; And Grace&#039;s line of pepper sauces.
