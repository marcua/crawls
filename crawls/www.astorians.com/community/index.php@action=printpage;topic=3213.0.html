				I&#39;m doing some canning (old fashioned, I know) and need to find Pickling Salt and Pectin.&nbsp; Any idea where I might be able to find these in Astoria (preferably) or Manhattan?&nbsp; I&#39;ve looked in my local grocery stores (Trade Fair and C-Town) but without success.<br />Thanks,<br />Liisa

				Jonathan-<br />I normally use powdered pectin (it comes in a box that looks like gelatin) but liquid would work too. &nbsp;<br /><br />As for jars, the discount stores in my neighborhood (there are two on Broadway between Crescent and 31st) seem to carry canning jars and lids in a variety of sizes. &nbsp;<br />L

				This class is not in Astoria, but I thought it might be of interest.&nbsp; Plus the instructor has the greatest name ever.<br /><br />Learn to can this Sunday at 2pm at the Wyckoff House in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, where the organization Just Food is sponsoring a free class. The same teacher, Classie Parker, will lead another workshop on October 7 at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden for a $31 fee. In Manhattan, you can register (for a whopping $90) to attend “Holiday Gifts from the Harvest” at the Institute of Culinary Education, held on September 30.<br /><br />http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/09/14/canning_time.php

				Jonathan-<br />If it&#39;s not a family secret, I would love a recipe for apple pie jam(?)....you have me absolutely intrigued here.&nbsp; Me and my girlfriends had a canning party but stuck to the ol&#39; standards....dill pickles, cold packed tomatoes, plum jam, hot pepper jelly and the like.&nbsp; Any excuse to put on our aprons and drink a little wine:)<br />Liisa

				L, No family secret here.&nbsp; Ill have to bring the recipe home from work.&nbsp; basically its apple jam with some cinammon and nutmeg.&nbsp; Even better, I took some of this jam and blended it with butter to make apple pie jam butter to be served with corn bread.&nbsp; Clients have been raving about it.<br />

				I love the sound of all these recipes!&nbsp; How did the lime pear ginger turn out?&nbsp; (The only thing I&#39;ve really had great success with is grapefruit marmalade, but I&#39;m trying to branch out.)<br /><br />Leezichka, where is the Euro Market?&nbsp; I&#39;m looking for pectin myself!<br /><br />And since Rainbow near the Ditmars stop closed (because a neighborhood just can&#39;t have too many dentists), I&#39;ve lost my local source for canning jars!&nbsp; No more running around the corner while the pot boils to pick up extras...&nbsp; Do you know of a place in the Ditmars area or elsewhere in Astoria that sells jars?<br /><br />Thanks!<br />

				Litza-<br />Euromarket in on 31st Street (under the train) between the Broadway and 30th Ave. stops.&nbsp; They only had a few more boxes when I was there about a month ago but it&#39;s worth a try.&nbsp; See this link for details on the market:<br /><br />http://www.nycnosh.com/?p=66<br /><br />Also, someone above mentioned Whole Foods in Manhattan, that might be worth a shot.&nbsp; As a last option, you can also order it from Amazon (I got a low sugar pectin for one of my jellies this summer).<br /><br />Good luck and let us know how it goes!<br />Liisa

				The pear lime ginger jam turned out very nice. Too sweet though.&nbsp; American recipe.&nbsp; I may look for european recipes, think they might be less sweet?&nbsp; &nbsp;Id like to find a technical site or resourse explaining whys and hows of sugar, pectin and acids in jams,jellies,etc...<br /><br />I was at Euromarket a few weeks ago and they had no pectin.&nbsp; Did find liquid pectin at key foods on 30th ave and 33rd street in the baking aisle by sprinkles, vanilla, jello area.<br />Not cheap stuff.

				Jonathan-<br />On the topic of Pectin and no or low sugar recipes, everything I&#39;ve ever read says that the excessive amounts of sugar in most recipes is necessary for gel factor and preserving the fruit--and whenever I&#39;ve tried to fiddle with the amount it&#39;s always left me with watery jam.&nbsp; However, while searching around I found mention of a new product---I&#39;ve never tried it, and I don&#39;t work for the company, but here&#39;s an article discussing it&#39;s usefulness.<br /><br />http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/plantanswers/recipes/sugarless.html<br /><br />and a link to the product:<br /><br />www.pomonapectin.com<br /><br />Also, I have a Reader&#39;s Digest book called &quot;Back to Basics&quot; which explains how to make pectin yourself (from a crapload of apples, but it can be done).&nbsp; Let me know if you&#39;re interested and I&#39;ll send along the directions.&nbsp; <br /><br />Liisa

				On the subject of canning jam like food (yum, Jonathan!), I have a recipe for lemon curd I&#39;d like to make, but it calls for 1# of sugar.&nbsp; 4 lemons and their zest/juice.&nbsp; Does the sugar content sound unreasonably high?&nbsp; I like my lemon curd tangy and less sweet.&nbsp; I know the English enjoy sweet things (this is an English recipe) rather sweet.&nbsp; Just don&#39;t know if this is a standard level of sweetness.
