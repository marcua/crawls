				I am organizing a happy hour this Friday for about ten to fifteen teachers. I live in Astoria (near Ditmars) and work at a school on 31st Avenue and 50th Street (technically Woodside). <br /><br />We have been to Patio and would strongly prefer not to go there. Dillenger&#039;s is great, but I was wondering if anyone had any other suggestions for happy hour places.... good deals (or good buybacks) that start around 3:30. What do you think of Shillelagh for happy hour? I welcome your comments. <br /><br />Thanks!

				in case any of you are curious, we ended up going to shillalegh.&nbsp; it has a big back room with a pool table, an outside area for smokers, a nice bartender, a juke box, and great drink specials. there was a lot of room for all of us to congregate and move around and it was a great time. I think we will be going back.

The back room is really nice. and they have $15 for buckets of 6 domestic beers. You can&#039;t beat it.

				yes, it was great.<br /><br />i am now planning our school holiday party for dec 12th. do you have any suggestions for that? my concerns about shillelagh is the lack of food and dance atmosphere. <br /><br />do you know of any places that we could either arrange to rent a room or have an open bar/buffet type of thing (we are open to doing it during the week on a thursday or something). if i cant find a place that we can get a good deal with that (i have about 40 people) i am willing to just&nbsp; go somewhere and bring a huge crowd for pay bar.<br /><br />i just moved here a little over a year ago so i have not completely explored the area. thanks for any suggestions that come through!<br /><br />
