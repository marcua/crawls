				FYI - I&#039;m saying it here first.&nbsp; We have company in Astoria.&nbsp; Have you seen them?&nbsp; It&#039;s the Quaker/Monk Parrots.&nbsp; :tongue:&nbsp; &nbsp;I find it exciting. For those who don&#039;t know about them, they been around for ages in sections of Bklyn (Bklyn college campus; Greenwood Cemetary to name a few); JFK area and, well basically all over.&nbsp; They are tough parrots and now making their home in Astoria !&nbsp; You can Google it to read up on them.<br /><br /><br />As a person who likes all birds (pigeons included), I started hearing their sounds late January walking to catch the train in the morning. Finally I got to witness them carrying nesting materials (twigs, branches,etc.,).&nbsp; So my thoughts were confirmed.&nbsp; Their nests are getting larger ~ there are two of them now. <br /><br /><br />Why they choose a certain spot for their home remains a mystery.&nbsp; Do they actually think Astoria has cheaper renting space?<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-family: comic sans ms;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: x-small;" class="bbc_size"><strong>(Pls be kind to our Planet Earth and all its habitats and creatures)</strong></span></span>

				I just did a search to see what this bird looks like and I think I saw 2 of these last year.&nbsp; I was walking down the street on Ditmars Blvd. and looked up and saw them sitting on the telephone wire.&nbsp; Then they flew off and I was amazed.&nbsp; I thought that they must have been birds who escaped from their cage.&nbsp; I hope I see them again.

				I thought I heard the squawks this AM up on or near the Amtrak Viaduct around 36th, 37th Street. Certainly not Pigeon noises or the usual tweets of &quot;normal&quot; birds and crows.

				I&#039;m an amateur birder and I would love to spot these guys.&nbsp; I think I did once: saw it prying a thick blade of grass jutting out from the sidewalk and fly away.&nbsp; Thought it was an escaped parakeet but it matches the pics provided.<br /><br /><br />I would love to spot it again.&nbsp; I want to see a &quot;rare&quot; category on my birdwatching app.

				Thanks for the tip!! Where were they nesting (unless you&#039;d prefer to keep that under wraps). Last fall I saw several of them up on the Amtrak viaduct near 35th Street, and on surrounding trees. Saw them there on multiple occasions, so maybe they were roosting? I&#039;ve also seen larger flocks of them in other parts of Queens. So much fun to spot!

				I guess the rents got too high <span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font">for them </span>in Brooklyn. I overheard the pigeons grumbling about those damned hipster birds invading Astoria.<br /><br /><br />Someone should take a picture of these elusive cuties and post it.

				I was walking on Steinway near the train tressle this weekend and heard these birds squawking.&nbsp; I looked up and saw a bunch of them in a tree.&nbsp; Then I saw one on top of the train tressle.&nbsp; I think that&#039;s where the nest is.&nbsp;

				Greetings folks ~&nbsp; :cool: <br /><br /><br />With all this gusty, high winds still continuing as I type this, just wanted add that the flock is growing and witness a gang of them (at least 10-15) hanging out on a tree right across the street from the Amtrak viaduct in my area early this morning as I was walking/struggling to get to the train station.&nbsp; I made it a point to look up to make sure their nest was still up there intact.&nbsp; From what I could tell, it still was .. whew.<br /><br /><br />Peace out ~ c&#039;iao for now ~<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 0.7em;" class="bbc_size">**Pls remember to be kind to our Planet Earth and all its habitats and creatures **</span>
