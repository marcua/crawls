				I somehow ended up with two extra tickets at the last minute for today&#039;s show at Randall&#039;s island at 3:30, due to circumstances beyond my control. I am going with a friend, but still have two additional tickets that are probably going to go to waste. If anyone out there is interested and didn&#039;t make any plans today, let me know.

				It was a good show, but I enjoyed LCD Soundsystem more :)<br />Les Savy Fav was intense - I hadn&#039;t seen them live before.

				Yeah, I kind of agree. Sort of disappointed in a weird way. It might have been the venue. Blonde Redhead was awesome. Never heard of LCD Soundsystem, and the Wasabi 5 were fuc**ng crazy. <br /><br /><br />e

				I got impatient. Ir eallly really really wanted to see arcade fire, but didn&#039;t realize they wouldn&#039;t go on until later and didn&#039;t have that blocked out in my time line. I also ended up surrounded by a group of highschool kids thrilled with fake i.d.s for beer who enlightened me that I would no blonde redhead because &quot;they&#039;re like from the 90s.<br /><br />So I didn&#039;t get to see the band I wanted.&nbsp; :cry:

				Arcade Fire was pretty good, the mosquitos started coming out a bit too much for my taste during their set, so I left a bit before it ended.&nbsp; It&#039;s a decent place to see a show, better acoustics than I would have expected.&nbsp; The walk back over the TriBoro overpass is a bit spooky alone at night.<br />How late did you stay?<br />What bands did folks think did the best live show?

				Sh*t I drove, could have taken some locals. I was wondering if I could walk but decided against it. You could have paid the tolls and parking which came to $14.50. total. That kind of sucked. But not as bad as the $24 water taxi round trip service the city people were hosed with&nbsp; :lol: <br /><br />Next Conceret anyone. Tonight Sunset Rubdown. Anyone interested, I still don&#039;t know if its sold out and its in williamsberg. (Music Hall) <br /><br />E-mail me and lets go damn it!!!!

				I actually enjoyed the walk over - it was just the walk back that was a task.<br />It looked like the buses were really packed and the parking sounds really out of control - they shouldn&#039;t be charging that much.<br />Lots of great shows coming up - I&#039;m catching Of Montreal and Stars this month.&nbsp; Can&#039;t believe I missed Kaiser Chief AGAIN.
