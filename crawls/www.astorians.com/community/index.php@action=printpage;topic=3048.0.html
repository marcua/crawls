				Hi - I was recently reminded of internet-based banks (Immigrant Bank, ING...) that seem to have better interest rates on basic savings accounts than traditional brick-and-mortar banks.&nbsp; Just wondering: are there any stipulations with these accounts?&nbsp; And, are they all FDIC insured?<br /><br />Thanks!

				I have both ING and Emigrant accounts. ING&#39;s interface is better, but Emigrant gives a higher rate. I&#39;ve moved my savings to Emigrant.<br /><br />I highly recommend these to people all the time. They are FDIC insured, but that doesn&#39;t mean all internet banks are. Getting 1% interest or less these days at a local bank is a bad move all around when options like this are available.

				HSBC has an online savings account of 5.05% interest.&nbsp; FDIC insured, branches everywhere (except Astoria, although I&#39;m told one is opening up here).

				I&#39;ve got an HSBC account.&nbsp; I believe they&#39;ve had the best rates for a while.&nbsp; Their interface totally sucks but you only really need to use it to set up automated transfers from your other bank and to check the balance once in a blue moon.

				Actually Citi has a 5.05% as well I think. EmigrantDirect is 5.15% currently<br /><br />Lots of options! :) But I believe all the above are FDIC insured up to $100k.

				This is all well and good for you people with positive net worths, but for those of us with negative net worths, the real question is where to find a credit card with no transfer fee and a permanent low interest rate! I think I lucked out and got a CapitalOne card years ago that seems to have a locked-in 5% interest rate, although I&#39;m always worried they&#39;ll raise it for no good reason... Does anyone know how to pay off a student loan with a credit card? My loan rate just went above that credit card rate...

				You could always get a card with a 0% for a year intro rate then cancel it and transfer the balance elsewhere after a year.&nbsp; Not sure if that would be <em>good</em> for your credit rating though.

				Thanks for the info thus far - another question: an automated transfer from a different bank account into an internet bank account: does this involve any fees?&nbsp; I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve had money moved directly between different bank accounts of different companies.&nbsp; (as opposed to having just money moved between a single bank).

				I wouldn&#39;t pay off a student loan with a credit card. Credit card companies can raise your rate. Besides, student loan interest is deductible on your taxes, and credit card interest is not. Credit card companies can not be trusted.<br /><br />If you have a decent credit rating I&#39;ve seen generous offers from Citibank Dividend card on balance transfers.<br /><br />Also, if you&#39;re looking for a loan to consolidate your loans check out www.prosper.com . It&#39;s a peer-to-peer lending thing that I&#39;ve been doing for about 6 months. I really like it.<br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind. If you do a balance transfer, transfer the balance onto a card that has a ZERO balance. Then DO NOT USE that card for any purchases until you get the balance paid off. Here is the reason why. Your credit card might have a normal interest rate of 12% for purchases. And let&#39;s say you have $1000 balance on the card at that 12%. Then you take out a balance transfer for 0% on another $1000. Your total balance is now $2000 ($1000 at 0% and $1000 at 12%). Seems like a good deal.<br /><br />Well, when you make payments the credit card company won&#39;t put any money on your 12% portion of the bill, they only apply your payments to the 0% portion of the bill until that full 0% is paid off. Only THEN will they allow you to start paying on the 12% stuff. This is the way that credit card companies &quot;lock in&quot; a high rate on you, is by &quot;offering&quot; you a 0% rate. In reality all they are doing is offering to screw you over. Don&#39;t fall for it.<br /><br />If you are doing a balance transfer, get the balance to ZERO on the card. Wait until next billing cycle (because they take your &quot;average daily balance&quot; and use that trick to charge you more interest) and THEN transfer the balance. Then DO NOT USE THE CARD FOR PURCHASES (since the purchases at the high rate will go in behind your low rate stuff - see above). I just sign up for auto-pay with the minimum deducted from my checking. That is the ONLY way that a balance transfer at &quot;5%&quot; is ACTUALLY 5% on a credit card.<br /><br />Just my $0.02

				Zip: It depends on the banks involved.&nbsp; The receiving bank likely isn&#39;t going to charge you for transferring into their system but the originating bank may.&nbsp; Check with your current bank and see.

If your institution requires a fee paid—get out of that institution. I personally use Citibank (only because of an almost half century history), ING, Fidelity, ML, AMEX and eTrade.<br /><br />Higher rates are genreally obtained by having higher balances. The more you spread your money around the lower the rates will be.<br /><br />Having any monies just sit and not earn appreciable interest is not a very good idea. <br /><br />ALWAYS leave your money where, at least, the original principal will be insured. Otherwise it is *not* a banking situation—but rather an investment.<br /><br />ONE OTHER THING: merm has a fairly good head for finances. Listen to him.

				Yeah, I just consolidated my Federal Loans, and was also upset to find out that the rate changes every July 1st.&nbsp; Darnit!<br /><br />I also found out that Sallie Mae will also consolidate Private Loans in addition to Federal Loans.&nbsp; Many companies told me that noone does this.&nbsp; They lie.&nbsp; Do you think it is a good idea to continue with the private loan consolidation?&nbsp; I have quite a bit of digits on my student loans with more than one private loan.<br /><br />Another thing, I was informed to make sure you start the consolidating ASAP.&nbsp; If you plan on going on to do Graduate Work, consolidate BEFORE you begin, especially if you have to get another loan out because if you have an open loan, you will not be eligibile to consolidate until it is closed/you graduate.

However, whether or not you should consolidate depends on what interest rates you currently have with your student loans. Find out what those rates are, then call a consolidation comapny and find out what your new consolidated rate would be.
