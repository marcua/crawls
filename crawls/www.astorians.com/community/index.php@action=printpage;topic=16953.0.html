				Join Council Member Peter F. Vallone Jr. and concerned community members as we protest the elimination of the W Line and MTA service cuts.&nbsp; We will be gathering outside Vallone&#039;s office at the foot of the Ditmars Blvd./31st Street station on Jan. 5th from 7:30 to 8:30 am. Let&#039;s rally together to show our outrage over these unfair cuts to a line that services a growing Astoria ridership.

				please help me understand this.&nbsp; while I&#039;m right there with you and don&#039;t want to see the W eliminated for us, how does a protest at the foot of a heavily used stairway up to the train on a Tuesday morning during rush hour help our cause?&nbsp; Isn&#039;t that inconveniencing our own?&nbsp; I get that&#039;s where Vallone&#039;s office is, but he&#039;s already committed to the cause.&nbsp; If it&#039;s mere publicity and press coverage that&#039;s the objective, can&#039;t that be done 1/2 block away or perhaps somewhere where MTA officials would be inconvenienced, not us?&nbsp; I just don&#039;t get it.&nbsp; &nbsp;:|

				Granted, I&#039;m a M - F &quot;rush hour&quot; commuter.&nbsp; So I&#039;m thinking that with the Q serving the line during my commute, that it isn&#039;t going to be a terrible inconvenience.&nbsp; Right now most of the time the train is empty enough that I get a seat every time.&nbsp; So I&#039;m finding it hard to understand what I&#039;d be protesting.&nbsp; Like I&#039;ve seen others say, is it going to be even close to as bad as the L train?&nbsp; Or the 4, 5, 6?&nbsp; I doubt it.&nbsp; I&#039;m willing to wait and see.&nbsp; But in this economy, we&#039;ve had to make sacrifices big and small in almost every aspect of our lives.&nbsp; So I&#039;m willing to endure a relatively minor inconvenience with this.&nbsp; If it really turns out that it &quot;hurts&quot; a big population of Astorians, then I will join a protest.&nbsp; So far it sounds like a lot of noise for the sake of publicity.&nbsp; If Schumer didn&#039;t just shoot his mouth off at the airline attendant, he&#039;d probably be pushing and shoving to be in front of the news cameras!&nbsp; And the only way I&#039;d protest at 7:30am is if I was still out from the night before.&nbsp; You want people to take a moment for your cause?&nbsp; Don&#039;t catch them at the crack of dawn while they&#039;re rushing to get to work.&nbsp; Catch them on the evening rush when they&#039;re more alert, and might have a couple of minutes to join in.&nbsp; &nbsp; What an ingenious plan!&nbsp; Not to mention the 2nd work day for many people who took 1 - 2 weeks off.&nbsp;

				There are more to these cuts than just the W train.&nbsp; The proposal talks about taking away free metro-cards from students.&nbsp; It also talks about eliminating door to door service for Access a ride customers and dropping them off at &quot;accessible&quot; train stations.&nbsp; Both of those practices hurt a large segment of our community (children, elderly and disabled riders).&nbsp; <br /><br />Families are already are cutting back to make ends meet.&nbsp; Asking them to pay $4.50 per day to send their kids to school will lead to choices that aren&#039;t tenable.&nbsp; Some parents may just say, we can&#039;t afford for you to go to school this week.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Q won&#039;t be available on weekends either or from what I understand during non-peak hours.&nbsp; <br /><br />A rally will help bring these issues into focus, help better educate the community as to what these cuts mean and organize the neighborhood to move forward against the cuts.&nbsp; Public displays of dissent are useful and can get results. This is why I support this rally.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I&#039;m glad to see the Councilmember taking the lead on this!&nbsp; I hope they keep the W, but baring that, if they would bring the Q out to Ditmars I think that could help.&nbsp; Cutting student metrocards is just wrong - I hope that proposal is removed.

				This is self serving for Councilperson Vallone, this is not leadership.&nbsp; He knows the City Council has absolutely no influence or oversight with the MTA.&nbsp; The rally amounts to scoring brownie points with residents frustrated with the MTA and a photo-op for the Western Queens Gazette.<br /><br />I&#039;ll take the neg-nods, it&#039;s the truth.

				Even though it&#039;s not a city council level issue, I am glad to see leadership on this and other MTA issues.&nbsp; As the MTA is a bi-state agency, it&#039;s very hard to get them to do anything, so I think getting them negative attention in the press does achieve something.&nbsp; I wish Mayor Bloomberg would do something, his &quot;plans&quot; to influence the MTA during his re-election campaign were good, but as he had not done anything on MTA reform in the last 8 years, I didn&#039;t expect anything new from him and haven&#039;t been disappointed.&nbsp; Governor Paterson could certainly do more too - I wish they would do something productive.

				Some of us on here are very lucky to live on Ditmars where you always get a seat in the mornings.&nbsp; But there are many living at the other stations, who I&#039;m sure never get a seat and where it is very crowded.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also been told that they are increasing the wait times at night after 9pm and on the weekends, and that will really suck.&nbsp; I ride trains on those hours quite often and they are usually crowded as well.&nbsp; I really hope they do intend to run the Q all the time, because getting around is going to get much worse.

As one article in the NYT&#039;s noted, Student transportation is traditionally paid for by the Education portion of a government budget not by the transportation agency. <br /><br />It seems to me, and I could be wrong about this, that the Student card was introduced so the City wouldn&#039;t need a fleet of buses to take kids around the city. And that makes sense to me. if the infrasructure already exists, why not make use of it. <br /><br />However, the city and state has cut their portion of the expense and I do feel that MTA has a valid beef in not being happy about that cut. And ultimately, if the state and city is not making a fair contribution to the expenses of the student cards, we, the users of the transit system have to pick up the difference. Or cut the expense. As one article noted. MTA&#039;s stance on this is probably a bargaining tool for what the state and city pays. <br /><br />Overall, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a bad expense. But, it does mean that we could have to pay more to keep the program going. Is it good or bad. I don&#039;t know. aAnd I&#039;m curious what others here think.

				And that&#039;s just the beginning!&nbsp; The cuts are likely not to take affect before June.&nbsp; That&#039;s a lot of time for our politicians to work some miracles - &quot;behind closed doors&quot; of course!&nbsp; Let the games begin.&nbsp; And watch who becomes the heroes in all of this.&nbsp; I&#039;ll look forward to seeing the gang on NY1 making sure they get a nice spot up front.&nbsp; Politics at work - along with the media.&nbsp; I&#039;m OK with the spectacle, as long as the people are served in the end.&nbsp; And as long as the spectacle doesn&#039;t cause crowding and delays when we&#039;re trying to get to our subway!

				Here is an example where leadership would have meant something: when the Triboro Bridge was renamed the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge (evidently because there are not enough public structures around the city named after the Kennedy family) in late 2008 at the height of the second great depression.&nbsp; The bridge is managed by Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, part of the MTA.<br /><br />A host of politicians, including from Astoria, spoke eloquently at the re-dedication ceremony in Astoria Park.&nbsp; None of them mentioned that renaming the bridge (such as replacing all the signs) costed $4 million dollars.&nbsp; Not one word.<br /><br />The next time you are waiting in the freezing cold elevated station for the overcrowded subway to get you to work, you can feel warm and fuzzy inside knowing there is real leadership in Astoria.

				There are other ideas that could be done with regards to the discontinuation of the W service that I know some of you rely on. My son has devised a plan to eliminate the W, not send the Q to Astoria-Ditmars Boulevard, and operate the N local north of Canal Street and headways increased during peak periods from 10 to 8 minutes. There also would be an expansion of QM22 service which has never been mentioned on this board to my knowlege, which would include a new Downtown service. My son has set up a site for these ideas and others affecting the Astoria-Long Island City area on this website: http://nyersforbettertransit.forumup.com/ since he will be writing letters to the MTA, State politicians, etc.
