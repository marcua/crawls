				I currently live in Brooklyn, but may move to Astoria/LIC in April. My son will be 8 this summer. Anyone have recommendations for summer camps that run from 9am - 6pm? He&#039;s not super sporty, but swimming would be nice. Thanks!

				This is not in Astoria, but for the summer we were very happy with Superkickers in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; &nbsp; Our son was just under 3 when he went there, but there were older kids too - just not sure what the age limit was.&nbsp; &nbsp;The camp is mostly indoors at PS 69 in Jackson Heights, but they have sprinklers and trampoline activities outside.&nbsp; &nbsp;Other activities are things like yoga, dance, music/piano, soccer, drama and arts and crafts.&nbsp; &nbsp;A great thing about it was that you could choose from week to week how many days you wanted to register for (online registration)- we sent our son 2 or 3 times a week, but skipped a few weeks when we went on vacation.&nbsp; You can also choose the hours - you can have 9-11, 9-1, 9-5 , etc. And they have early dropoff at 8am and late pickup for an extra charge.&nbsp; &nbsp;Very reasonable prices.&nbsp; &nbsp;The only hesitation I had was that it was a commute to get there on the subway from Astoria, but we liked the camp and the owners and counselors so much that we felt it was worth the commute.&nbsp; &nbsp;The link is www.superkickers.com - I noticed that their summer camp link isn&#039;t live yet, but you can check out the activities they have which are similar to their camp offering.&nbsp; &nbsp;

They seem nice and they have really grown over the years.<br /><br />Also you may want to check out the lic ymca on queens blvd and most precious blood around Broadway and 36. I checked into them but never enrolled cause our situation changed.

				You should check out Immaculate Conceptions Summer Camp. It&#039;s NOT a religious based camp. But they do not have swimming.

				It&#039;s hard for me to recommend my own camp but this summer we&#039;ll be offering LIC Kids summer camp with swimming classes. For more information, please visit http://lickids.com/springsummer_camps (http://lickids.com/springsummer_camps)
