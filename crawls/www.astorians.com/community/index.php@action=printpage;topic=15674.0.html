				http://www.1010wins.com/Animal-Control-Offering-Free-Cats-Through-Labor-Da/4873458<br /><br /><br />if are interested in adopting an adult cat, the city pound is doing free adoptions (with perks) until labor day.&nbsp; <br /><br />i saw the information today on 1010wins.com (link is attached).<br /><br />this is a great thing, so if you&#039;ve been considering it, take the opportunity now...and pass the word along too.

				I adopted Doyle at the Manhattan ACC shelter 2 years ago, and do not know what I would do without him.&nbsp; I highly encourage the adoption of adult cats.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s really awesome that they haven&#039;t had to euthanize any healthy animals due to space so far this year, and doubly awesome that they are waiving the adoption fee for adult cats during prime kitten season!

				On August 4th, there&#039;s a TNR (trap-neuter-release) clinic from 7-10pm in East Elmhurst. You can visit the ASPCA website for more info. Registration is free, and those who take the course can then have access to traps, discount (free?) spay/neutering etc. <br /><br />I&#039;m just so tired of seeing strays multiplying, especially near our office. Maybe I could put a small dent in the overpopulation problem.

				I&#039;m assuming that the idiot who neg nodded the original post is probably the same one that neg nodded the outraged posts in the thread about the girl who microwaved her cat...

				What an excellent idea!&nbsp; Rescue cats are wonderful and older ones (who are sometimes classifed as such by only a year a old!) are great cats.&nbsp; You know exactly what you are &quot;getting&quot; as far as looks and personality and they are usually calmer than kittens and do not need constant supervision (like kittens).&nbsp; Both of my adopted furry children have been rescued at 1 year from a Florida shelter that I ended up volunteering at afterward.&nbsp; I&#039;ve noticed that the little kittens go quickly, but the bigger guys usually stay longer and truely appreciate a loving home.&nbsp; Add a cat to your life today - especially while it&#039;s free!&nbsp; <em>Any number of years spent with a loving cat are good years, for both you and the cat</em>. :-)
