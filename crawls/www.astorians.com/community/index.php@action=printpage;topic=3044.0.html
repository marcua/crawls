				Great question!&nbsp; I&#39;ve been totally frustrated by bowling in Manhattan and never thought about it here...Back in the &#39;burbs you can go out for&nbsp; a night of bowling for $7.&nbsp; In NYC, it&#39;s like $7/game!&nbsp; Outrageous.<br /><br />Anyone ever been to the places above?&nbsp; How are they?&nbsp; Pricey?&nbsp; I hope they&#39;re at least a little sleazy.&nbsp; Nothing beats a sleazy bowling alley!&nbsp; Too bad there&#39;s no smoking inside.&nbsp; Now, I&#39;m definitely not a smoker, but oh, the ambiance!<br /><br />

				it is by the entrance to rikers. as for who bowls there,&nbsp; a lot of korean families seem to like the place. i&#39;ve seem very few greeks, however. and there are always a couple european youths of the ditmars-booming-stereo variety. otherwise it&#39;s a standard working-class crowd.

				its true, i hate lamb. i LOVE rabbit. yeah it could be seen as a bit gross- but look at that pic, its not &quot;bloody&quot;. When you ask the butcher person for the blood, you put it in like a paper coffee cup that is half full of vinegar. yes the blood has to be fresh (still warm) and it curdles or whatever the proper word is when you mix it with the vinegar. Then it becomes a yummy sauce when you do all the other stuff that my mom does to it that i don&#39;t quite get yet.

				So I went bowling at Maric Lanes yesterday.&nbsp; It&#039;s 4.75 per game per person on the weekends, and 2.50 for shoes (I think?). Much cheaper than Bowlmor in Manhattan.&nbsp; (It&#039;s a hike in the boondocks of suburban Queens.&nbsp; You should see these homes!&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; I want to move.)&nbsp; The place is so retro, and definitely has not been renovated since before I was born.&nbsp; &nbsp;The balls kept getting stuck behind the pins and piling up, and the attendant had to fetch them out.&nbsp; If you have your own ball, bring it, there are a lot of bad balls to choose from :)&nbsp; That being said, we had a great time, and really enjoyed ourselves.&nbsp; I think they have leagues all week, so I have no idea when it&#039;s not busy.&nbsp; You might want to call and find out.&nbsp; We waited about 20 minutes for a lane because some bowling masters were practicing with two lanes to themselves each, and there was a birthday reserved as well.&nbsp; Still, this was better than the normal 2 hour wait at Bowlmor.

				I would be down to support or join an astorian.com bowling league! &nbsp;However, is there an affordable, convienant bowling alley to Astoria? &nbsp;The place in the &#039;burbs of Queens sounds like you need a car or a lot of patience and knowledge of the MTA system and I think we all know that Bowlmor and Chelsea are kind of pricey! &nbsp;I used to go with co-workers to a bowling alley/lounge in Sunset Park, near 36th St., I believe. &nbsp;That place had an old school cocktail lounge when you walked in, with really affordable drinks and interesting people and cheap lanes! &nbsp;Is there anything like that closer to us! &nbsp;

				The only thing is, I believe in order to start a league you need to be sanctioned and stuff like that.&nbsp; There are technicalities that go into running a league. Unless you were just interested in meeting once a week for bowling fun.&nbsp; Then again, I don&#039;t know how hard it is to become a sanctioned league either.&nbsp; It might be as easy as signing up and that&#039;s it.

				I&#039;m game if its for fun. I have heard good things about Maric too. There&#039;s a bowling alley in Port Authority, at least there was 4 years ago. But admittedly, they kept the pitchers full so I can&#039;t recall the prices. Queens has to have better rates though. And I agree, a little sleaze is best in a bowling alley. That&#039;s the one thing I remember most about Port Authority...
