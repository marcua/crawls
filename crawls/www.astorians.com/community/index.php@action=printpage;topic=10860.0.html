				Can we make a list?&nbsp; I don&#039;t want this to turn into a &quot;b--- fest&quot; about places that are NOT friendly to people with babies/kids, but I&#039;m sure that we&#039;d all like to know if there are places here that are in any way &quot;welcoming&quot; to people with smaller people in tow (strollers, high chairs, menu choices, etc).&nbsp; <br /><br />Parents with tiny babies:&nbsp; Take your baby, and yourself, out while your child is still so portable in his/her cute little car seat!&nbsp; Go on, treat yourself!&nbsp; Go someplace a little nicer than those places that I mention in my list --- if your baby is asleep for most of the meal, who&#039;s gonna care?&nbsp; If I want to go some place nice with my 2 kids (4 and 1 year-olds), I have to get TAKE OUT or get a baby sitter.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ll start with what I know (I live in the astoria/lic part of the hood):<br /><br /><strong>CUP</strong> -- 35th ave/36th street --- it is a big space, has diner food, can accomodate strollers (and are pretty nice about it), high chairs, and will welcome big groups of parents and kids.<br /><br /><strong>Cafe/Bar </strong> --- 34th ave/36th street --- if you go &quot;early,&quot; they are incredibly accomodating to groups -- they don&#039;t seem to mind kids and babies, and we parked the strollers outside.&nbsp; We used our laps to hold the kids....don&#039;t remember them having highchairs (they are a bar, didn&#039;t really think that they would)<br /><br /><strong>Restau-Rant</strong> ---- 35th ave/30th st --- we&#039;ve gone there at 4 in the afternoon when they first open.&nbsp; They were really great to us....<br />didn&#039;t have highchairs (as it is really a bar, did not expect them to)<br /><br /><strong>Igloo </strong> --- 31st st/ditmars --- very kid/baby friendly, they are used to big groups of people with strollers (you just need to make sure that the stroller is out of the aisle so they can get through), the back space is great for groups and usually less crowded, they will make kid plates, etc, have high chairs.....<br /><br /><strong>Brick</strong>--- 31st Ave/33rd st--- They had a high chair when I last went (but I kept my child on my lap), but the last time I passed by there, I saw a kid in her stroller (but maybe she wanted to be there).&nbsp; They have that nice outdoor area....the food is great (not really &quot;kid&quot; food, though)........I called first to ask about kids, and they said that children were welcome......<br /><br />what else?

				<strong>Igloo-</strong> very baby friendly in terms of brining the baby,but no where to change baby...they were very accomodating though and brought me several chairs into the bathroom so that i could create a make-shift changing area, which is possibleonly because my daughter is 2 months. <br /><br /><strong>Flo </strong> - Also very friendly to babies and children, but again, same changing table issue<br /><br /><strong>Waltz</strong> - doesn&#039;t usually have a crowd during the day so it is a great place to bring the stroller and read with little worry<br /><br /><strong>718<strong></strong></strong> I haven&#039;t been there with the stroller yet, but every time I go by there are couples with strollers sitting in the outdoor area<br /><br />But I also think &#039;summer&#039; baby-friendly is different than &#039;winter&#039; baby friendly as mostly any outdoor cafe doesn&#039;t mind the stroller. totally different story in the winter though as things get cramped. I never had a kid in the winter so i guess only time will tell.

				I&#039;ve been with Mom&#039;s with strollers at Astoria Diner and Las Margaritas, and they even brought over high-chairs.&nbsp; They both seem kid-friendly.

				I take Lily to Sakura (ditmars &amp; 36th) at least once a week for sushi lunch.&nbsp; they are usually pretty empty and they positively fawn over her.&nbsp; They cut her cucumber rolls extra small so she can chew it easier and leave the nori out of her miso soup.&nbsp; they have a high chair and a booster seat.<br />we are also regulars at igloo- lily is practically a celebrity there&nbsp; 8-)<br />

				Mike&#039;s Diner by the Ditmars subway stop is kid friendly and so is Neptune. Neptune doesn&#039;t have highchairs, but they have the chairs that attach to the tables and booster seats.&nbsp; Michael&#039;s over on Broadway has highchairs, too.

				<strong>Tacos Mexico </strong> 38th and Broadway. - You can order a rice an bean roll up and they have good fruit shakes for the kiddies. There is no changing table. But time it right and you&#039;ll be in and out of there before you know it. <br /><br /><strong>Lite Bites</strong> Steinway and Broadway. It&#039;s tight and a little cramped but they have highchairs and it&#039;s a good spot for silver dollar pancakes! Leave the stroller at home or fold it down. <br /><br /><strong>Panera Bread </strong> by the Movie Theater - Not really a restaurant but a good place for lunch none the less. Large, accomodating tables are easy to find. The Bathrooms are clean and well air conditioned, and both have baby changing stations.<br /><br />In the hit or miss category, i&#039;ll have to say <strong>Fatty&#039;s</strong>. Waiting for the food to arrive can be a harrowing experience with the little one. Either bring lots of entertainment or eat in the backyard. If the stars align just right and the food comes before the next administration, the you should be okay. No changing table, and tight spaces for strollers inside. <br /><br />Good luck!

				pizza express (corner of ditmars and 31st street) has an indoor merry go round (just right for the 3-5 yr old set) and an arcade game for the older kids<br /><br />jj&#039;s sushi on 31st ave and 36th(?) ...a little west of brick (whose menu is not kid friendly at all, in my experience)... they did something magical with a rubberband so my then-3yr old could use the chopsticks. he was so proud of himself! (and their lo mein was the best i&#039;ve ever had anywhere) bonus: near il bambino, so cupcakes for dessert!
