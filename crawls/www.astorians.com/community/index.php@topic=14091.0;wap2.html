			<br />
			Kehillat Tikvah: A Jewish Community of Hope will be having a rollicking child-friendly (and adult-friendly!) Purim Party on Sunday, March 8th at 4 p.m. This is a fundraiser, so suggested donation is $36/non-member adult, $18/KT member adult and $5/child â€” more if you can, less if you can&#039;t. Come in costume and prepared to have fun!<br /><br />All KT programs and services are held at the Community United Methodist Church (35th Ave between 81st and 82nd streets) in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />Want more information about our Purim Party, upcoming events or joining Kehillat Tikvah?
