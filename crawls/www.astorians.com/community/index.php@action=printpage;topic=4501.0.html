				I keep hoping to actually see these animals!!&nbsp; All I hear is lots of loud snorting, but the animals never come into view.&nbsp; &nbsp;I do see insects fly around every once in awhile.&nbsp; Someone was moving the camera around a bit before but now it&#39;s static, and I wish I could move it in the direction of the snorting&nbsp; :x

				Am I a dork for turning it on when I was back at my parent&#39;s house in CT for some ambient non-musical noise? Crickets and birds and thunderstorms in the distance, oh my!<br /><br />The thunderstorm in the distance looked way cool since it was night. I also spotted a couple of duck-like birds in that pond and some sort of lizard. And the bugs zipping by the camera, illuminated by the light, looked like little comets!<br /><br />Do we know where in Africa this camera is?

				ITS MOVING!! WE HAVE MOVEMENT, PEOPLE! :lol:<br /><br />It was on a rock...and now back to the lake. Maybe there was some lizard or something there a minute ago? Excitement in the wilderness.<br /><br />Also, there is some bird going absolutely insane off camera right now, from the sounds of it. Maybe she&#39;s having a fight about cleaning the bathroom with her nest-mate?
