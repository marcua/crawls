				Can we agree to keep the political posts out of the Local Chat and Issues section and put it in Random Gabble where others in the past have been moved?

				I don&#039;t particularly have a dog in this fight, but I somehow suspect this argument is a rehashing of some previous fight and not actually about the post at hand. This is not about national politics, but about a LOCAL Astoria senator who started caucusing with a party other than the party whose ticket he ran on. It seems to me that a disinterested third party would classify that as a &quot;local issue&quot; rather than &quot;random gabble.&quot;<br /><br /><br />(Also, you could make a pretty strong case that for a Democrat to caucus with the Republicans is &quot;empowering Republicans,&quot; without resorting to hyperbole.)
