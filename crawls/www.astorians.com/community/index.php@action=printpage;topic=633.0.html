				@ cloudnine<br /><br />Here is one picture of the sound weapon that I was talking about. It's called the Long Range Acoustic Device and has already made a debut at one of the protests. I'm a little fuzzy on the details.<br />The picture that I remembered seeing was more impressive than this however, because it actually showed the weapon deployed &quot;in the field&quot;, iow blocking off a crowded city street right here in the good ol' U.S. of A.<br /><br />http://msnbc.msn.com/id/5841974/<br /><br />Cheers :-),<br />----Zeno.

				150 decibels ... i think smashing pumpkins might have played that loud &nbsp;when I saw them in '98 ... Anyway, seeing that sort of thing on the streets would be scary, yes, but not altogether unexpected. &nbsp; I think I need to go to more protests, just to see this neeto equipment. &nbsp;I was at the last protest in DC before the war began, and we had practically no intervention from the police. &nbsp; There were 3 or 4 older veterans and the college Republicans protesting the protesters, but that's about all the opposition we saw. &nbsp;<br /><br />Its also very funny how the language of the article makes hackers sound like terrorists:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Not many hackers are warning of electronic disruption.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Did I miss something? &nbsp;Is there a color coded warning system for &quot;hacker attack propability&quot;? &nbsp;&quot;Private! &nbsp;Bring us to Hacker-con 4!&quot;<br /><br />And a general nitpick, one which will never be relieved: &nbsp;People that break into systems are called &quot;crackers&quot;, or if they are less skilled (e.g. riding into someone's system via anothers exploit), &quot;script kiddies&quot; ... NOT, I repeat, NOT &quot;hackers&quot;.<br /><br />A &quot;hacker&quot; is a person that is very interested in computers, and wants to learn *all* the ins and outs of operating a computer. &nbsp;A less skilled hacker is a &quot;newbie&quot;. &nbsp;:) &nbsp;Or for an even better defenition, consult the New Hackers Dictionary:<br /><br />http://www.outpost9.com/reference/jargon/jargon_23.html#SEC30<br /><br />-m

				Thank you for voicing the much needed clarification concerning hackers.<br /><br />&quot;A crack is a hack but a hack is not necessarily a crack.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Hackers&quot; helped build the internet as we know it today. People forget that the creator of Apple computers and the open source GUI that Bill Gates stole and renamed &quot;Windows&quot;, Bill Wozniak still to this day considers himself a hacker in the original sense of the word. And as far as cracking, I fail to see the similarity between defacing a website and a terrorist act. Is it possible that dropping bombs on a city with innocent women and children can be considered an act of terrorism? This war of words is very disturbing. Since when did the word &quot;liberal&quot; become a dirty insult, and what are the motives of the people who want to abolish what the word &quot;liberal&quot; means? Are these people to really be considered representative of traditional American Values? Perhaps some day &quot;freedom&quot; will equal &quot;slavery&quot; and &quot;democracy&quot; will mean &quot;oppression&quot;.<br />Someday.
