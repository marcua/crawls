				I tip just as I would in a restaurant . . . between 15 and 20 percent. Most of these delivery people really hustle to make a living and it seems they live off their tips, so sometimes I over-tip!

				Yeah, I usually do about 15-20% too (I do err on the side of overtipping though if I can&#039;t do the math quick enough in my head). I tip more (20-25ish) if it&#039;s crappy weather outside, or if they were really quick.

				yeah i probably should tip as if i were in a restaurant, but don&#039;t.&nbsp; usually i give a fiver unless they&#039;re extra quick or the weather is really bad.&nbsp; i also try to give the tip in cash b/c if i add it onto the credit card receipt, i can&#039;t be sure they get the tip.

				Although I&#039;ve never worked as a server or a delivery person myself, just seeing what they go through as a customer, I have a lot of empathy for people in the service industry so I pretty much always overtip.&nbsp; I don&#039;t eat out much, but when I do (and when I order delivery), I usually tip around 30%.&nbsp; For me to tip 15% which is generally thought of as a decent tip, service would have to be pretty bad.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t know why but I&#039;m just very generous with tips.&nbsp; I think if I went out to eat and the server stabbed me and made out with my girlfriend in front of me, I&#039;d still leave a 10% tip.<br /><br />In general though, I&#039;d say 15-20% is good for delivery.&nbsp; Round up instead of down.&nbsp; And if there&#039;s inclement weather, maybe a bit more than usual.

				Wow.&nbsp; Depending upon how much you&#039;re getting, I think you guys are way overtipping.&nbsp; A delivery person is just bringing the food to your door.&nbsp; A waiter/waitress is taking your order, checking on you to make sure you have everything you need, delivering your order to your table, etc.&nbsp; I almost feel like it&#039;s demeaning to the waitstaff to be tipping delivery guys so much.&nbsp; Heck, maybe I should get a job doing deliveries in Astoria.

				We usually tip around $3, sometimes a bit more, depending upon where they&#039;re coming from and the weather. As eblack said, they&#039;re just delivering the food -- definitely not the same job as the waitperson in the restaurant, so they shouldn&#039;t get the same sized tip. It&#039;s not like the delivery person sticks around to make sure the order is correct and refills my soda.<br />

There&#039;s also the safety factor - they usually carry a lot of cash, and they&#039;re going to the front door of a strangers home, often at night.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know...I will admit that I&#039;m sympathetic to mostly everyone in the service industry (servers and delivery guys alike) - I&#039;ve been part of it myself, and I have friends who are bartenders, waiters, cooks, and a childhood friend even owns a pizza place back home and a bunch of our other friends have delivered for him for extra cash. (Most would quit when they realized they were spending almost as much on gas as they were making in tips.) I guess I&#039;d just rather err on the side of tipping too much than not tipping enough. I figure that if I can afford to eat out or order delivery, then I can afford to tip what I feel is fair.

				Whenever the bill is less than $20 or $25 I throw out the 15-20% rule.&nbsp; The minimum I would tip is between $3.00 to $5.00 or 25-33% depending on the size of the order.&nbsp; Conversely if I go to a restaurant and the bill is over $75 I usually stay closer to 15% unless the service is absolutely impeccable

				If anyone is having trouble getting their food deliveries in a timely manner, perhaps it is time to rethink your tipping policy. I can&#039;t afford to order frequently, but it never ceases to amaze me how these young kids can get me my order—from 10–12 blocks away—piping hot each time.

				+1 on no such thing as &quot;overtipping.&quot;<br /><br />Having worked through college and after in food service and bartending, I really got a good feel for what it&#039;s like and know how great it can feel to get a great tip.<br /><br />As a server, getting that little bit above 20% could put a smile on my face and make me not feel so ticked at a table of jerkoffs that ticked me off earlier.&nbsp; That extra buck might not be a bunch to you, but to a server/bartender that has to tip out on that (busboys, barbacks, door guys, etc.), it puts them back into the 20% range.<br /><br />I always overtip, too.&nbsp; As stated above, the server would have to be TERRIBLE to get only 20% from me because, even then, I understand that they may be new or just having a bad day.&nbsp; Granted, it helps to tell the customers and be apologetic; but some people are stubborn.<br /><br />Some of the best tips I&#039;ve gotten were when I was doing horribly, but apologized to the customer and they could see that I was getting run like crazy by the other tables or that I just had someone bump into me and spill a tray of drinks all down the front of my shirt.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t know what the server minimum here is but, in TX and FL where I waited tables the most, it was $2.13/hr and I had to tip out 4% of my total sales to busboys and bartenders.&nbsp; So, even though you were nice and tipped 20%, I was knocked to 16% immediately.&nbsp; That doesn&#039;t even count taxes and the people that don&#039;t tip.&nbsp; The hourly rate definitely doesn&#039;t make up for that, either.

				They are probably SUPPOSED to get an hourly rate, but I don&#039;t think that some of them do.&nbsp; I know there are quite a few places in Manhattan that have been busted recently for terrible work conditions.<br /><br />There was a place off Union Square, Saigon Grill, that wasn&#039;t paying it&#039;s delivery folks minimum wage, not paying them overtime, and they were sending them to locations that they had been mugged previously and then, to top it off, they were making them pay for the meals and repay the money that was stolen.&nbsp; Even after the employees said they didn&#039;t want to go back to that location because they had been robbed before.&nbsp; <br /><br />If they complained too much, they were fired.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure this doesn&#039;t happen everywhere, but I&#039;m pretty sure that tips make up the largest part of their incomes.

				There was a really excellent article in NY Magazine a few months ago about deliverymen and the abuse they take.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a stingy tipper by any means (so many friends in the service industry) but this article really opened my eyes.&nbsp; If I&#039;m too lazy to cook my own meals or get out and buy my own dinner, I have to calculate the cost of my laziness.&nbsp; It&#039;s simple math.&nbsp; Anyway, read the article.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://nymag.com/news/features/35540/<br /><br />Here&#039;s a section:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">One call from a customer complaining about cold food can be enough to get a deliveryman suspended, so Justin always pedals fast, running red lights and cutting in front of traffic to cross the street. Stopping on 85th between West End Avenue and Riverside Drive, he wraps his chain around a pole, snaps shut the rusty padlock, grabs the bags of food, and hits the buzzer—all this takes just four or five seconds. He collects $50 ($46.82 for the order, $3.18 for a tip), and then he’s back on his bike seat, one bag swinging from his handlebars.<br /><br />Two minutes of pedaling later, he walks into a building on West End, armed with $13.71 worth of Chinese food: beef with garlic, spring roll, egg roll. He walks out with another $15 in his pocket. “They gave me $1.29,” he says with a shrug. By the time Justin gets back to the restaurant, it’s 6:39 p.m. His first round-trip of the evening—nearly one mile of cycling—took thirteen minutes. Nearly an hour into his shift, he’s made just $4.47 in tips.<br /><br />In New York’s expanding service economy, deliverymen occupy a position near the bottom—earning less than doormen, security guards, nannies, maids, tailors, taxi drivers, and trash collectors and working in far more treacherous conditions. They work long hours and cover huge territories, often in inclement weather, dodging perils like potholes, taxi doors, and tow trucks (one of which killed a deliveryman last year)—all the while hoping they don’t get robbed along the way. And they do this for pay that is often less than the minimum wage.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I also worked as a server and bartender for years and I believe in tipping well.&nbsp; I usually tip $5 minimum, more in a restaurant, of course.<br /><br />The last place I worked had a lot of delivery guys and, believe me, they don&#039;t <i>just</i> pedal a bike to bring you your food.&nbsp; They had multiple odd jobs around the restaurant (cleaning, restocking, packing up the deliveries, unloading deliveries for the kitchen, etc.).&nbsp; Also, many of them work 12 hours or more a day and made about $2/hr.&nbsp; If they got injured during a delivery (hit by a cab, slid on wet streets) they were rarely allowed to go home or go get treated.<br /><br />So, please remember that this is their job and, even though they aren&#039;t saving lives or changing the world, most delivery people work really hard.&nbsp; If you can afford to eat out or have food delivered you should be able to afford a good tip.<br /><br />The End&nbsp; :-)

What are far more common are injuries caused by bicyclists <strong>illegally</strong> riding on the sidewalk. I&#039;m sorry, but that&#039;s not okay to me. When pedestrians have to dodge bicyclists, that&#039;s a problem. There are very specific laws that pertain to bicycle riders, but unfortunately many of the delivery people around here fail to cooperate with them. <br /><br />This poster (http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/bikeposter.pdf) is supposed to be affixed at businesses that utilize bicycle deliveries in NYC. The law went into effect in July. How many Astoria businesses are following the law? I would guess very few.

By referencing the poster, I&#039;m simply highlighting the responsibility of business owners and riders in their obligation to provide a safe environment for both riders and pedestrians alike. Unless the restaurants tell their delivery persons to ride on the sidewalk, the rider is the one making the decision to do so, unnecessarily putting pedestrians at risk, in violation of the law.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry, but IMHO, what it&#039;s &quot;like for these guys&quot; doesn&#039;t give them the right to flout the law and endanger people walking along the sidewalk.

				Even though I never worked as a watress, I&#039;m all about tipping well.<br />For deliveries I tried to give at least 30% because bills are usually smaller than let&#039;s say going out to restaurants.<br />It&#039;s only a couple of dollars for me but it may make more difference for the delivery guy.<br />Next time just add another dollar to whatever you&#039;re giving...<br />&nbsp;:wink:<br />

				I don&#039;t tend to tip a specific amount/percentage each time. How much I tip depends on how much I ordered (amount of food moreso than the price) the distance from the restaurant to me, and the weather. Never under $2 though.

Why is it left up to the customers to pay an employee&#039;s salary? There are countries where tipping is not customary. This is because the employees are paid a salary where they work - this means they treat every customer as well as they&#039;re supposed to, regardless of how well that customer pays them after the fact. Why it&#039;s different in America, I have no idea. And why the restaurant industry is so special that they can get away with this crap, I also have no idea about. <br /><br />As for the delivery guys, I don&#039;t make life very difficult for them. I only ever get delivery at work because I pick up my own food when I order out at home. I don&#039;t think I&#039;m undertipping if I give them $15 on an order that comes to $12.50 including tax, for example. I tend to order within a 4-5 block radius, and my order generally fits in a small bag. My workplace has an elevator. I tip more in bad weather.&nbsp; If people who&#039;ve worked in the industry seriously think that&#039;s too low to the point of being called a &quot;cheapskate&quot; and they&#039;d be tempted to screw with my food because I didn&#039;t give them 30%, there is a serious problem with the system as it is. If people really feel that strongly about it, there SHOULD be a movement against the restaurant industry to pay its employees fairly - not try to make people feel guilty for giving a delivery guy $2.50 for a small order.

All the restaurant bills included a 15% gratuity simply built in...I think Essen that this is customary in the cafe parts of Europe especially, which I&#039;m familiar with because A.) You have to ask for a bill, you are never given one. B.) People sit at cafes for HOURS, meeting friends, chatting, maybe eating a meal and then sitting for coffee and then maybe ordering a bottle of wine so C.) adding a gratuity assures that the restaurant will profit from the cafe lifestyle of many European countries where people sit for lengthy amounts of time. American restaurants are not the same, hoping for a fast turn and receiving one. <br /><br />Why do I think American restaurants dont offer their employees a strong base salary, thus making them reliant upon understanding customers? I think it&#039;s because of the decreasing number of farmers in the US and the high property taxes that make even our food in bulk to be much more expensive than say, European cities. Throughout Italy and Switzerland during my recent travels, high quality food, wine and atmosphere (aside from tourist traps) were a fraction of a mediocre restaurant in the US, not just NYC. In European nations, the food is local, not shipped. This is another reason why US restaurants are so expensive to operate, let alone rent, taxes, insurances etc. Small businesses really take a beating in the US...<br /><br />I usually try to tip $3-5 unless it&#039;s been raining, and then there is a solid $5 in it for them.There are a lot of dangerous jobs that seriously suck that we dont tip people for doing-bike messengers, mail delivery, janitorial and maintenance jobs, late nights at convenience stores...So I dont think I should feel inclined to participate to the active support of the delivery man&#039;s income. Maybe I sound harsh, I dont mean to be, I tip and wont order if I cant, but its not up to me to set a standard for what the restaurant should be paying him.

				reading the posts here I get the feeling that I am responsible for the problem we are having with low skilled immigrants, by not tipping them 20%-30% I am not putting food on the tables of their families. I am suppose to be responsible for their salaries regardless of how long it took them to get me my food or if it came complete or not.<br />I tip according to the circumstances if my order is $10 and it came quickly nothing spilled and its hot i will tip $2 if its the oppsite then it will be $1, if that makes me cheap then you can call me cheap.<br />Some of the posts here make it sound like this guys are like doctors or fireman or policeman risking their lives driving through bullet riddled streets with gang members on every corner sporting Uzi&#039;s. THIS IS ASTORIA and the OP asked how much you guys tip here in Astoria not how much a delivery guy should be tipped in Afghanistan or Iraq where it might be a little more dangerous

That way they&#039;d get the money without the restaurant having to raise the prices of the food. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s not your RESPONSIBILITY, it&#039;s you CHOICE.&nbsp; That&#039;s the point of tipping and why, here in the US, we have a tipping system.&nbsp; You don&#039;t HAVE to tip a thing if you don&#039;t want to.<br /><br />The reason they don&#039;t remove tipping and put this in the cost of the food is because, consciously and subconsciously, MOST people look for a deal.<br /><br />Imagine two similar restaurants, both that have food you enjoy and you wouldn&#039;t pick one over the other for taste reasons.&nbsp; One charges a delivery fee of $3 and, because they pay their delivery/service folks minimum wage, they have higher food prices compared to the similar restaurant because they have to make up those costs somehow.<br /><br />Now, you pull out a menu and, taste preference aside, which one are you (or someone new to the area) likely to choose?&nbsp; The cheaper restaurant where you can make your own choice as to whether to tip or not; or the one that charges more for the same sandwich and a delivery fee?<br /><br />Consciously or subconsciously, you&#039;re likely going to be picking the cheaper one.&nbsp; Most of the time, you and most others are not going to factor the potential tip in the price or, if you&#039;re cheap, you&#039;ll find the delivery fee and the increased price of food to be too much; making it cheaper to just buy from the place that doesn&#039;t have the fees and just tip.<br /><br />Free choice.&nbsp; We don&#039;t live in a socialist society (yet, anyway).&nbsp; While you might be berated by others and cursed by the server/delivery person for being cheap, it&#039;s your choice.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think most here would be ready for the costs and product price increases required with removing the voluntary tipping system.

				I&#039;ll drop down a buck and change for pick-ups at restaurants, but not take out joints.&nbsp; Those pickup orders are put together by tipped employees and the house is not paying for their services.<br /><br />Amen for the tipping system around here.&nbsp; Put me through college, grad school and then allowed me to live on half employment through my 20&#039;s.&nbsp;

				I guess I am a bad delivery tipper.&nbsp; I usually tip $2 or $3 plus the change, and I usually order something for $10 to $20.&nbsp; In restaurants, I double the tax and then some.

				I wish we could get someone on this thread who could articulate the other side.&nbsp; Not the little to no tip side, the perspective and experiences of delivery people in Astoria.&nbsp; It would be great to have the real scoop.&nbsp; Any investigative journalists out there?

				When I&#039;m ordering, I am usually ordering just for myself and I&#039;ll give $2 (which is usually more than 15-20%) if I am paying by card.&nbsp; If I&#039;m paying by cash, I&#039;ll give $2 plus whatever the change is, to make it even.&nbsp; While it might not seem worth traveling all the way to my apartment and back, that is the job they chose and if they don&#039;t like it, there are A LOT of other jobs out there.&nbsp; They might not be desirable jobs, but I&#039;ve heard garbage men get paid a ton of money.<br /><br />I think one of my biggest problems is that I usually tip pretty highly compared to the &quot;standard percentage&quot; and I have consistantly received poopie service from the places in my neighborhood.&nbsp; You can say &quot;well don&#039;t order from there anymore&quot; but that&#039;s easy to say when you aren&#039;t having the problems I&#039;ve had with the places in my area.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had to wait 45 minutes for an order of DOMINOS CHEESY BREAD and that&#039;s from someone who is given a Dominos car to deliver in.&nbsp; I had one delivery woman call me from the street and tell me to come outside because there were no parking spots and she was too lazy to park around the corner.&nbsp; I was told later, by a friend, that she probably did that to see if she could get away with it.&nbsp; When I wouldn&#039;t comply, she was up my stairs and at my door in under 5 minutes.<br /><br />I just don&#039;t see why I should have to pay almost double for my meal because these people aren&#039;t paid properly by their employer.&nbsp; ESPECIALLY chain places like Dominos (though the privately owned places haven&#039;t been much better).&nbsp; And don&#039;t tell me they would raise the price of the food...most of these meals are obviously suffering from inflated prices already.&nbsp; Somehow I can&#039;t see how a restaurant can justify charging over $8 for a cheeseburger while the place next to it can charge less for a larger portion.<br /><br />Either way, I don&#039;t think I should be punished or called a cheapskate for the way I tip.&nbsp; $2 might not seem like a lot if you have to bike a 20-block round trip with a plastic bag hanging from your handlebars, but it does seem like a lot when you&#039;re already paying more for your food than you really should be paying.&nbsp; You can say &quot;well don&#039;t order out&quot; but that&#039;s just not happening and it&#039;s ridiculous.<br /><br />People can argue all they way but if 15-20% is standard, that&#039;s what these people should be expecting.&nbsp; I don&#039;t understand people who expect above average rewards for (typically, for me anyhow) sub-standard service.&nbsp; I am not a cheapstake.&nbsp; In fact, I often feel immensely guilty because I tipped more than I should and it is just that much more money that I can&#039;t afford to be spending.&nbsp; I don&#039;t deserve to have someone spit in my food, or put their dick in it, or what have you.&nbsp; No one does.&nbsp; It&#039;s suck, vile, and, to be frank, it&#039;s ghetto.&nbsp; If food service people want to be tipped properly, they should have some class.&nbsp; It might not bring in significantly more money, but it will certainly guarantee that decent tippers like myself won&#039;t be taking out of their tip.<br /><br />Also, I should mention that I had an incident the other day with a delivery guy where he brought me the wrong soda and I said &quot;this is supposed to be x and it&#039;s y.&quot;&nbsp; His response was &quot;uhhh&quot; and I said &quot;well, can you just swing by later when you&#039;re back out on your rounds and bring me the right kind.&quot;&nbsp; I didn&#039;t expect him to rush back with it, though I would think the restaurant (it was a chain) would send someone in a car to correct the error.&nbsp; After all, I&#039;m PAYING for this service.&nbsp; The guy&#039;s response was &quot;it&#039;s too far.&quot;&nbsp; I said &quot;but I ordered x and you are trying to give me y.&quot;&nbsp; He goes &quot;it&#039;s too far.&nbsp; Here, take my tip instead.&nbsp; The soda will be free.&quot;&nbsp; I was aghast.&nbsp; He would rather give up his tip to cover the cost of the soda than go back to the restaurant and say &quot;this is the wrong soda for this apartment and he wants it now, someone should bring him the right kind.&quot;&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t going to take his tip back because I don&#039;t believe in not tipping at all, and I don&#039;t think he should be paying for the soda...the restaurant should.&nbsp; But I was livid and I ended up slamming the door in his face for being so unprofessional as to say &quot;it&#039;s too far.&quot;&nbsp; The saddest thing is that I probably would have tipped the guy again for taking the time to come back and give me the right soda.<br /><br />It&#039;s a sh*tty system but it&#039;s not my responsibility to supplement these peoples&#039; salaries.&nbsp; I have an office job that I have to bust my hump for.&nbsp; I stay late, come in early, take work home almost every night and on weekends.&nbsp; And I get paid less than an executive assistant would.&nbsp; It&#039;s the nature of my industry and I accept that, but if the company didn&#039;t provide so much free food at meetings and if part of my job wasn&#039;t to wine and dine potential clients, I would probably go hungry many days and nights.&nbsp; So it bugs me to think that I should have to give up money I barely have, after working just as hard emotionally and mentally as they do physically, because their employer pays them less than what is livable.&nbsp; My employer pays me less than what is livable and I don&#039;t expect my clients to supplement my income whenever we close a deal.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t accept the nature of the beast, don&#039;t apply for an effing job there.&nbsp; That&#039;s how I feel.
