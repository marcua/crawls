				Passed by today and saw it was boarded up and looked like there was a fire. Does anyone know if they are re-opening? It was the only decent place in Astoria to get my kids clothes.

				It only smells like the place was torched (unlike the New Year&#039;s fire below Broadway;&nbsp; why am I convinced it was a torching?&nbsp; Probably because it&#039;s a restaurant cash biz.) :evil:

				From the Queens Gazette: http://www.qgazette.com/news/2007/0214/features/014.html<br /><br />Steinway Fire Guts 2 Stores<br /><br />A stubborn, smoky, fast-spreading fire gutted two retail shops on Steinway Street on February 7 and destroyed second-floor offices at the two locations, fire officials said.<br /><br />The blaze started at about 9 p.m., in a second floor storage room at The Baby&#039;s Place and quickly spread next door to The Children&#039;s Place, a Fire Department spokesperson said.<br /><br />More than 150 firefighters, paramedics, FDNY Rescue Teams and assorted equipment were called to the scene to battle the blaze at the two clothing stores.<br /><br />One firefighter was taken to a local hospital for treatment of burns he suffered on his hands while trying to extinguish the blaze, fire officials said.<br /><br />The all hands blaze was brought under control at 9:54 p.m., but crews remained at the scene to monitor conditions throughout the night and for most of February 8.<br /><br />Store owners who returned to the site while the stores were being boarded-up on February 10 said they would probably reopen at the location.<br /><br />&quot;This is a real blow,&quot; said one store employee. &quot;What are we going to do now?&quot;- Liz Goff
