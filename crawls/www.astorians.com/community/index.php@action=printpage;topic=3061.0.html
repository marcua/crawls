				Lots of places closing, and opening up these days.&nbsp; <br /><br />Some things I&#39;ve noticed:<br /><br />The former &quot;Rainbow&quot; house supply store on 31st street between Ditmars and 23rd ave is now becoming one of those Dentist chains (Whats the name,&nbsp; Vitaldent?)<br /><br />The greek cafe on Ditmars between 37th and 38th that was shut down a few months back is becoming, &quot;Inside Astoria&quot; a housing boutique and gift shop.<br /><br />What have you noticed lately?<br /><br />

				That&#39;s so great to hear Ditmars is getting another dentist.&nbsp; I was starting to get worried that there weren&#39;t enough dental options.<br /><br />I mean - I&#39;m really glad they didn&#39;t put in like, the first art-supply store, the first indian restuarant, or the first music store in the area.

I was just saying that I needed more 99-cent stores clustering around my home. You know, like 72 more. But one gigantic one on Steinway (less than a block from two other existing 99-cent stores) will do just fine. Thank god, because I was worried that I wouldn&#39;t have enough options for buying more cheap crap to support my wasteful disposable lifestyle!

				Indeed, the greek cafe that closed had bats on the awning, and was frequented primarily by old greek men. &nbsp; Its name was odd, but I can&#39;t remember it off the top of my head. &nbsp;It was alot of constanants put together. &nbsp;<br /><br />When I first moved into this neighborhood my room mates and I went inside to see if they served food. &nbsp;Everyone stared at us, and we were coldly told no. &nbsp;Later my room mate ran into a greek friend, and when he learned that he lived in the neighborhood, urged him to eat at that cafe because they served the BEST greek food there. &nbsp;If you wern&#39;t greek, you wern&#39;t welcome. &nbsp;Such a creepy place.<br /><br />I peeked in the window of the boutique/gift shop yesterday, and they really fixed the place up. &nbsp;I saw a variety of New York themed books laid out on a table. &nbsp;Very curious what else they will sell.<br /><br />

				The Lesbian Landsmanschaft on 31st Avenue seems to have closed, and I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to replace it. &nbsp;I call it that because it seems to have been a club for Greek men from the island of Lesbos, and they had their sign only in Greek lest they attract gay women. &nbsp;I used to point it out as a curiosity.<br /><br />On 34th Avenue, across the street from the S&#39;Agapo Restaurant, a Bravo International Supermarket is being set up.<br /><br />The Corona Bakery on 31st Avenue has bitten the dust, and where the Miles Deli used to be the Astoria Candy Store is going to open. &nbsp;Meanwhile, up the street, the Two Star Candy store has taken down its sign. &nbsp;Is it going to move to the new place, I wonder?<br /><br />Not that Two Star was good for much. &nbsp;I used to go there for Diet Coke when the 20 oz. bottle was cheaper there than anywhere else. &nbsp; But now that the price there is exactly the same, why bother?<br /><br />The little Colombian bakery on the same block as Michael&#39;s has closed, and a French-style patisserie is supposed to open there. &nbsp;A consolation for the absence of Edelweiss?

				Re: the southeast corner of Ditmars and 35th, the mystery corner, where every restaurant that comes in there inexplicably fails.&nbsp; Under a few of the incarnations the place has been, one of the big signs that&#39;s always been placed in the front window has been &quot;Under New Management&quot; -- regardless of whatever different kind of restaurant it was.&nbsp; I&#39;ve always heard vague rumors of mafia associated with that property and wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there never really was any &quot;new management.&quot;&nbsp; All I know is, whatever&#39;s moved in there has always failed miserably, often after months of appearing almost devoid of customers when I&#39;ve passed at various times of day and night.&nbsp; It makes no sense -- that&#39;s prime real estate, and the re-design from clunky video store in the late 90s to whatever that next restaurant was -- was pretty good -- looks like an open, airy space, with a big seating area and a full bar.&nbsp; I could only hope someone sees the light and opens up a really good Chinese restaurant -- in that part of Astoria, which is crying out for one?&nbsp; It would be a goldmine.<br /><br />Re: first music store in Astoria. It came and went.&nbsp; I can&#39;t recall the name of the place, but it was a small walk-in CD/vinyl store on Ditmars, was it around 28th St?&nbsp; Was there up through the late 1990s, but not sure when it opened?&nbsp; Either near where or in the old space that became the tattoo parlor around there.&nbsp; Which, no doubt, will one day make a fine tatoo laser-removal parlor.&nbsp; But unless you were solely into hiphop and 90s soul, there wasn&#39;t much going on there.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyone who wanted to open a small indie music store these days would be better off building a bonfire and shoveling his money into it.&nbsp; These things may not exist in a few years, unless they branch out and figure out other ways to bring customers in that don&#39;t involve the purchase of CDs.&nbsp; These days, even large chains either go under (Sam Goodys, HMV, and now possibly Tower) or struggle to survive -- dark days for brick-and-mortar music stores, which is a shame.&nbsp; When I first moved to NYC in the late 80s, there were literaly dozens of indie record/CD stores in the Village, all thriving -- not anymore.<br /><br />I noticed there&#39;s a new Japanese restaurant on, I think, Ditmars between 37th and 38th, south side of the street.&nbsp; Haven&#39;t gone there, but the menu dropped on my doorstep the other day didn&#39;t look bad at all.

				There&#39;s a couple of places opening up on - I think it&#39;s 38th? - just north of Broadway. One looks like it might be a cute boutique but I&#39;m not totally sure. There&#39;s a big awning that says.. was it Two Rebeccas? I think that&#39;s what it was. But all the windows still have brown paper on em. I&#39;m watching that spot eagerly. Also nextdoor to that place is what looks to be a Japanese Video Store that just opened. I was really confused by that one.<br /><br />I noticed Corona closed on 31st Ave. It&#39;s so close to my apartment - I&#39;ll miss smelling their baked goodies on the way to work in the morning. But I&#39;m also excited about what might take its place...

				I used to live on 38th and Ditmars (bed bug central), above the Bat Cave Men&#39;s Club.&nbsp; &nbsp;Only men were allowed inside except for waitresses.&nbsp; Their back window used to open up into the center courtyard of the apartment building.&nbsp; As residents of this building, we were treated to loud obnoxious music at all hours no matter what day or time of day it was, shouting above that music, and the smoke that would waft into our homes.&nbsp; Every night we complained, called 311, and put up with the assholes.&nbsp; For 3 years I suffered thru this.&nbsp; I guess the landlord didn&#39;t renew their lease because they are not back.&nbsp; But the shoe guy is and some of the other places.&nbsp; I&#39;m happy the tenants are finally getting a good nights sleep, that is if the bed bugs have been totally eradicated&nbsp; :?<br /><br />Oh, and the place across from 718 always struck me as a front.&nbsp; It&#39;s always the same guy sitting in there alone who owns it, yet there&#39;s always a sign looking for new management.&nbsp; I have had food there when it was a Brazilian steakhouse, it was very good.&nbsp; But it&#39;s either a front or is cursed because it&#39;s always going under, and there&#39;s no reasonable explanation for it besides mafia or a ghost.

				speaking of Fat Cat, i was looking around for the local inkslingers and called them after finding them listed somewhere online and called them to see if they were still open. They are, and if anyone is interested- 2810 23rd Ave. (same name diff. business ya think? or some kind of offshoot?) <br /><em>....good idea for another thread!</em>&nbsp; :-D

				Planet Wings is going to reopen under the name &quot;All Star Burgers&quot; or something like that.&nbsp; The franchies fees were too much so the owner is going to slightly modify the menu but will still have wings and such - just not as many sauces...
