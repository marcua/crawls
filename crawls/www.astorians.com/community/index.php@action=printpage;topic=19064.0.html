				Corn was so tender we ate some raw.<br />Squash is practically glowing a deep yellow.&nbsp; Sweated them in a pan with corn kernals and butter. SO freakin&#039; good.<br />Tomatoes are a dark dark red inside.&nbsp; Fantastic.&nbsp; <br />Hungarian peppers were eaten raw and delicious.<br />Grape tomatoes were out of this world eaten at the stand, warm from the sun.<br />Peaches were drippy, sweet and fine.<br /><br />Going back for more on Saturday.&nbsp; Prices were good.

				WOW!&nbsp; Louis has some amazing stuff.&nbsp; Thanks for the heads up about this Pulled Pork.&nbsp; All of the produce looked incredible, it was hard to decide.&nbsp; The muskmelon smelled so good it was irresistable...and it tastes even better.&nbsp; I have yet to cut open the watermelon but it too looks great.&nbsp; I love the fact that he has both seeded and seedless.&nbsp; He had so many types of peppers and eggplants and they all looked fantastic and so fresh.&nbsp; can&#039;t wait to try the corn tonight.&nbsp; so exciting to have such fantastic produce available in the area...saves a trip to Union Square and so far i think i like this guys produce better...and that is a tall order with all of the competition in Un.Sq.&nbsp; His prices are right too.&nbsp; <br /><br />I hope enough people support Louis so he stays around.&nbsp; what an absolute pleasure to have nearby.&nbsp; Right down the road from the Astor Bake Shop too so it is a nice double-header.&nbsp; It seems too good to be true.&nbsp; <br /><br />I expressed my dismay at using so many bags and wished that i had brought my own.&nbsp; Louis said that if i brought them back he would reuse them.&nbsp; I was happy to hear that.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Sorry to hear you had a bad experience, Debbie.&nbsp; We stopped by on Saturday after reading this thread and we picked up some corn, zuchini, peaches, cherry tomatoes and eggplant.&nbsp; Prices are awesome and the produce is all really good looking!!&nbsp; Sometimes you go to a farm stand and everything looks anemic.<br /><br />Corn, zuchini and tomatoes all yummy.&nbsp; Peaches not the best I have ever had, but still nice.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t eaten the eggplant yet.<br /><br />And as a bonus? -- Louis is a total hottie!&nbsp; &nbsp;:wink:&nbsp; (bring on the neg nods)

				I&#039;m do excited about this farm stand! I&#039;m going to walk over in a bit and see if Louie is there today. I&#039;ll post in a bit if he&#039;s there or not. I also hear that Brooklyn Grange sets up a farm stand in front of Vesta (30th ave and 21st street). I think they&#039;re there on weekends but not really sure what time. It seems like a good day for walking so I&#039;ll check it out if Louie is not out today.

				So, I went to Louie&#039;s vegetable stand on 21st st and 28 ave. I bought a pumpkin, 2 apples and a yellow and a green zucchini. Looking forward to doing lots of cooking this weekend. Perhaps some pumpkin biscuits or muffins. I also stopped by Brooklyn Grange&#039;s stand in front of Vesta. They are they only for a few more weeks since the season is ending. I believe they are there on Saturdays from about 11 to 3.
