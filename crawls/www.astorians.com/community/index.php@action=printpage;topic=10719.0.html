				I am looking for someplace, a Church or something, to make clothing donations. I also have baby toys (all brand new) and other random household items to donate. I have tried the Salvation Army and everytime I go by, it is closed. <br /><br />If it is only a clothing drop, that will suffice for now, even though some of the clothes are literally brand-new with tags. But I have things other than clothes to donate as well so would like to only make one stop.<br /><br />I live by the Beer Garden, so someplace near there would be ideal, but I can drive further. <br /><br />Thanks!

				There is a thrift store on Ditmars that takes donations and also on Steinway there is a Goodwill and a Salvation Army if you drive. I also just discovered a clothing drop off place in the parking lot of Best Yet if you do not want to deal with people.

				This past weekend, I dropped clothes off in a drop box in the C-Town parking lot (30 St. and Broadway). Since it&#039;s in a parking lot, no need to find parking if you drive there
