				Does anybody have any suggestions for neutralizing cigarette smoke odor?&nbsp; It has been permeating my apartment from some outside source, to the point where the smell was so pungent that it woke me up in the middle of the night, and I think that our towels and sheets have begun to smell.&nbsp; I would like to avoid using anything that simply masks the smell by emitting its own offensive odor (so I&#39;m guessing Glade Plug-ins are out of the questions).&nbsp; That being said, are there any devices that anyone recommends?

Any one who walks in doesn&#39;t know that anyone smokes. <br />ehiw.com should have some alternates for you. i just read one about cotton balls in vanilla or something. if i can find it i shall share...

				I wonder if that linen scent would be good around the cat box, too!&nbsp; Sometimes, kitty launches a unilateral &quot;offensive&quot;, if you know what I mean...

				I did a little poking around online, and found that a lot of people recommend putting out a dish of white vinegar overnight to &quot;absorb&quot; the odor.&nbsp; Maybe I&#39;ll try that.

				<br />The Ionic Breeze Air purifier (from the Sharper Image) is amazing for this type of thing.&nbsp; My cousin and his roommate chainsmoke all day and they have one of the bigger ones which sucks out any trace of smoke.&nbsp; But the Glade plug ins are a lot less expensive i&#39;m sure!
