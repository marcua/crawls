				For years I&#39;ve gone down to the piers in LIC to watch the fireworks there. I think it&#39;s called Elmer Gantry Park? It&#39;s in front of those huge Citylights buildings. Anyway, it was always the best place to go. I didn&#39;t go last year &#39;cause I was out of town, but a friend told me that he went down there as usual to get a spot on the piers and they were closed off to the public! You could only get a spot on them if you had a pass from Citylights, meaning you were a resident or guest. THIS IS SO ELITIST! Apparantly, the riff-raff (all of us) had to sit farther back in the park. Does anyone know if this is going to be the case this year? I was appalled when I heard about it. Does anyone know someone who lives in Citylights that we could ask, or better yet, someone who is involved in management there? I think if they do this this year, we should protest. These are supposed to be public waterfronts. This is why I&#39;m suspicious of all these big plans that are being made for Silvercup west and the like. They say they&#39;ll improve the waterfront for everyone, but then they restrict it. If Independence Day isn&#39;t the time for activism, when is?

				Isn&#39;t Gantry Plaza publicly owned anyway? Legally they shouldn&#39;t be able to restrict access. This sounds quite fishy. and it&#39;s poop if we all can&#39;t enjoy the fireworks down there. i thought the 2 places usually recommended to queens residents are there and rainey park.

				Citylights is a very expensive coop, one of the biggest blgs in Queens.&nbsp; I went to the fireworks display there last year, and yes, the public was restricted from entering the piers by these really burly security guards.&nbsp; Only if you live in the blg, were you allowed in, or a guest or something.&nbsp; It was very annoying, and I do wonder about its legality.&nbsp; We were stuck on the concrete right in front of Citilights entrance, as there was no room anywhere on the little bit of park that was open to the public.&nbsp; I&#39;m surprised they don&#39;t just close the entire thing off to only Citilights residents.&nbsp; Elitist @#$$^&amp;&amp;&amp;!!!

				If they got additional FAR (floor area ratio) to build the building taller by creating a public park/courtyard, it should have to be open to the public.&nbsp; You can generally check on that by calling the Department of City Planning (I&#39;ll try to find their number and post it).&nbsp; I&#39;d also call Councilmember Eric Gioia&#39;s office and see if they can do anything about it.&nbsp; It sounds like they&#39;re not being good neighbors and maybe breaking their agreements.&nbsp; (Is it that really big building down by the river?&nbsp; 20 or 30 something stories?)

				I found this press release when it was opened/dedicated/redone or whatever and it says the it is a STATE park for the community. It doesn&#39;t say that the community is exclusive to residents of the building:<br />http://www.empire.state.ny.us/Press/1998/QWPARK.html<br />Does councilman Gioia represent that area? I would like to phone his office to ask if the plaza is indeed a public park that is unrestricted. if they answer yes, which they should, then i could ask why is it closed off on the 4th and only city lights residents may use it. Is his number posted somewhere...i think its in the activism thread somewhere.<br />would others be interested in bombarding the appropriate council member with questions regarding this? i&#39;m going to be in philly that morning and travelling to DC that afternoon so i won&#39;t be here to actually see the NY fireworks, but this whole thought of restricted access disturbs me.<br />while my boss is leaving me alone i will see if i can find any more info about the park

				I also went there last year for the Fireworks and was turned away as not having the proper &quot;paperwork&quot;.&nbsp; It is disgusting that this park, which is a state park, does not allow access for all.&nbsp; I agree with welling, it is time to stand up and make our voices heard.

				Dirk, I think that is state property.&nbsp; Curious what input city officials have over Gantry policy.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know if the rumor is true that Gioia has an apartment in Queens West, but he certainly is a big booster of turning over the waterfront to private developers.

				I think Gioia would have some influence over the development as it would have had to go through the city land use process.&nbsp; It would depend on if they got variances in exchange for creating the park.&nbsp; The only way to know for certain is to check with city planning.<br />If it&#39;s a state park, then maybe Cathy Nolan would be a better contact, but today is the last day of the session in Albany, so if that&#39;s the case, I&#39;d wait until next week and reach out to her office.&nbsp;

				Dirk, quick question. <br /><br />Why do you think the the waterfront is being turned over to parkland in Manhattan, and a good portion of Brooklyn (which seems to be the direction most of the county is taking on waterfront use) yet in Queens, its given over to private developers and power plants (well, Greenpoint and Red Hook seem to share our fate, but is it because city planners look down on blue collar folk?)<br /><br />Who did you think locally had a hand in this?<br /><br />And why are we not hearing about these other uses? You know, several thousand people enjoyed Summer Solstice at Socrates the other evening. Why can&#39;t the entire waterfront be like that?<br /><br />And looking forward, how can a 50 story building at Silvercup handle the Fourth with a 40 foot wide easement?

				good questions, I don&#39;t have any answers - I don&#39;t follow Community board 2, Queens, or the projects down there - maybe someone on the board has more information.<br />I think the fight for the waterfront is something that&#39;s going on everywhere in the city - if you look at thevillager.com you&#39;ll see the ongoing fights in the West Village regarding the waterfront.&nbsp; It&#39;s happening up in the Bronx too (especially with Hunts Point).

				Well, actually it is a community board 1 issue, too. <br /><br />No one knows? No one to fess up? <br /><br />Well, lets all of us start asking elected officials and community board people about this: curious as to who IS responsible, why they think our irreplaceable heritage, the waterfront, is better placed in the hands of a few developers than the public.<br /><br />mdirk, you are quick with the Rolodex and those elected officials. Don&#39;t be bashful, go ahead lets all call &#39;em! Lets ask about why we are not hearing about all those other waterfront solutions that seem to reach the ears of those in other boroughs.<br /><br />Well, folks, wasn&#39;t summer solstice wonderful? A little better than a big wall and entrance to a garage, (which is what Silvercup and the others are promising.) <br /><br />Surprised? Well its pretty tough (and not very useful) to condense a rendering of a 50 story building into the one square inch the newspapers allow for it (but they do it!). They usually give a perspective on the face Manhattan sees, rather than the ass-end those of us from Queens will enjoy.<br /><br />

				Nice post Gleason.<br /><br />So until we hear back from someone who can gather that information us (you listening Dirk?), perhaps we can all go over to Gantry Park piers for a picnic this July 4. <br /><br />Lets sit on those piers until we get ejected or asked to leave. After all, our tax dollars developed that waterfront. Why should we step aside for those johnny-come latelies to take those seats we paid for?<br /><br />

				Since we can&#39;t rely on city planning, our community boards (he he), newspapers, or city council to let us know whats going on elsewhere, whet your appetite on this: <br /><br />http://www.worldshipny.com/bklynwalktext.htm<br /><br />http://www.bbpc.net/index.cfm?objectid=F0539988-3048-7098-AF491D355BB4BCB9<br /><br />http://www.inetours.com/New_York/Pages/Emerald_Necklace.html<br /><br />http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/lmr/html/east_river_park.html<br /><br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/erw/index.shtml<br /><br />http://www.senate.gov/~schumer/SchumerWebsite/pressroom/press_releases/PR01063.html<br /><br />I encourage you all to do five minutes of surfing! Beats months of reading the local papers!<br /><br />So, Welling thanks for the info - and astorians.com, does anyone want to invite the community to a July 4 picnic?!?! We can either enjoy the &quot;public access&quot; at Shore Towers, or at Gantry Park. Your choice. Double the fun, how about BOTH locations! <br /><br />Maybe someone can invite the architects of the Queens waterfront plan to share in the fun!<br />Isn&#39;t it wonderful to be reconnected with our waterfront as our leadership (and the press) is saying!<br />

				If I read the initial post correctly, it&#39;s that the <em>piers</em> are restricted, not the entire park, yes?&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#39;m hoping to head down there for the fireworks on the 4th regardless, because it sounds like the park itself is open.&nbsp; Is there any more information about this?&nbsp; I was reading about the fireworks on the about.com page:<br /><br />http://queens.about.com/od/holidays/p/july4.htm<br /><br />And it sounds like the park is open to all.&nbsp; Just not sure about how the access to the piers affect things, having never been there before.&nbsp; I&#39;ve got an email out to John of about.com asking him what he knows.<br /><br />Anyone else interested in checking out the fireworks at Gantry Park on the 4th?<br /><br />And how were the Astoria fireworks on Thursday night?

				Yes the park is open, its the piers that were restricted last year. So the public was in back and the new residents had choice seats in the front. Perhaps second class seating is ok.<br /><br />Afterall, you can still see the fireworks. So &#39;whats the big deal?&#39; <br /><br />Maybe this one year, they will change things and let the public in.<br /><br />But keep in mind, Silvercup has only 40 feet at the waterfront in its plans. Its own tenants will not get a space to stand, let alone the public! Suna laughed that one off when someone pointed that out to him. <br /><br />Of course, Shore Towers is completely closed. <br /><br />And God knows what else is being planned for the rest of the waterfront (not easy trying to figure out a 20 story building rending the size of a postage stamp).<br /><br />Anyone see the WONDERFUL edition of the Tribune. Silvercup in the front cover from the Manhattan perspective. Why can&#39;t we see the &#39;jobs creation public access project&#39; from the Vernon Ave. perspective?<br /><br />

				Has it crossed anyones mind that maybe that Citylights board went to the city and got a permit that allows them to gain exclusive use of the piers for the fourth.<br />Its just like using a baseball field, or picnic grounds at any NYC park.<br />The city gives out permits to almost anyone to gain exclusive use of fields, to use for group outings corporate softball/baseball games and such. You just need to go to the appropriate office get the paper work fill it out and if the space,date and time are available you pay various fees i.e. clean up, and you get use of said field.<br />What I suggest is if you guys are so desperate to see these firworks up close, go to&nbsp; the parks dept and see if you can get the piers for next year or the year after that.<br />But just remember it probably won&#39;t be cheap. Which means many people will have to get together and pay the fees. Which in turn will mean the people who pay will get to pick and choose who gets to view the fireworks from the pier, since there is limited space. But then you just become the same people you are fighting. <br />Hypocrisy is an evil SOB

				Hey everyone, I found out some more info on the Gantry Park firework watching availability.&nbsp; As we&#39;ve learned, it&#39;s a totally awesome place to catch the fireworks show.&nbsp; BeXn posted about her experience last year:<br /><br />http://www.bexn.net/2005/07/aloe-lavender-week.html<br />I read on queens.about.com that Gantry Plaza State Park in Long Island City is the best place to view the show. Even though we arrived at 9:00PM, there was still room and many unobstructed views of the sky. If we showed up earlier we might have made it onto one of the piers, right in front of the 4 main barges on the East River. I&#39;ve also seen the Macy&#39;s show in Manhattan and Brooklyn; Queens by far offered the best view, plus it&#39;s tourist-free. Firework shapes that impressed me: dandelions, petaled flowers, UFOs, stars, apples and my overall favorite - CUBES. Yes, cubes just like you used to draw in school!<br />-------<br /><br />This is worth reading:<br />http://queens.about.com/b/a/096176.htm<br />Be sure to read the comments!<br /><br />There&#39;s also a discussion on the Queens West board about the Security for CityLights:<br />http://www.queenswest.com/citylights/discussion/00005402<br /><br />Anyway, it looks good for Gantry State Park.&nbsp; I&#39;ll be there!

				4 postings from queenswest:<br /><br />And the rest of the community, that doesn&#39;t live in any of these buildings, gets their view cut off by the buildings.Used to be that you could watch the fireworks from anywhere in the neighborhood with an unobstucted view. No more.<br /><br />I wasn&#39;t here last year, but in 2004 Center Blvrd was barricaded by cops. They screened every single person who wanted to enter the park with metal detector wands and made small children open their picnic baskets to check that they weren&#39;t smuggling weapons. It goes without saying that they did all of this with the insolent, indifferent slowness that is the hallmark of airport security and immigration officials the world over. By the time the fireworks got going, there was a vast line of people stretching along 50th Avenue. If someone had wanted to detonate a bomb, they could have killed as many poeple right there as in the park. So it is that on America&#39;s day of freedom the waterfront of Long Island City is turned into a police state.<br /><br />The police are brave men and women who usually act in our interest. On this occasion, their actions were heavy handed and pointless. You could find larger concentrations of people in Times Square every day. I would be interested to know what law they invoke to stop and search people using a public highway. You may think it&#39;s a trivial point, but on July 4th of all days it is important to remember that the government is our servant, not our master. &quot;Those who would sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither.&quot;<br /><br />Home in my case is the Avalon building where I will have air conditioning, a fridge full of beer and an excellent view from my window, so I&#39;m not concerned for myself. But I will feel a twinge of pity for the huddled masses below who will have to wait for hours in the baking sun. The barricades simply create an arbitrary boundary between two large crowds. Either would serve as material for a July 4th massacre, so the effort of mechanical screening will not make the average spectator any safer. You might as well screen everyone who wants to enter Times Square. My argument is not against the police presence, but against creating an arbitrary inconvenience for the sake of being seen to &quot;do something&quot;. You may welcome it, but I see it as a surrender to the terrorists and a step on the road to serfdom.<br />

				It&#39;s not a rumor.&nbsp; I was one of those denied entry on the <strong>piers</strong> at Gantry Park last year to watch the fireworks.&nbsp; Yes, the public was allowed into Gantry Park to view fireworks, but the access to the wooden piers that&nbsp; extend into the river were blocked off by big burly security guards.&nbsp; You could only gain access to these piers if you were a Citilights resident and you had a pass.&nbsp; I had to join everyone else around these piers and it was pretty crowded.&nbsp; A lot of people were turned away from the piers.&nbsp; &nbsp;That said, it is a nice view, just get there early.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would love to know if they have ended this restricted access to the <strong>piers</strong>.&nbsp; Those of you who go, please try and gain access and let me know.

				FYI, my next door neighbor just came back from an appointment in LIC. As I type, she and her sister are packing a picnic and are heading down to the pier. She said there are already a dozen or so aluminum chairs and blankets out there already. She was one of the multitudes in the throng last year that was refused access to the pier, and she is determined not to be denied again!<br /><br />Everyone, have a great time.

				I wasn&#39;t there last year, but here&#39;s what I was told this week by one of the state employees from &nbsp;Gantry Park: There&#39;s no preferential treatment for people from Citylights (or any other group) at all. Access to the piers has always been on a first come, first on basis. Once the piers reach capacity--and this can happen early--access is restricted, but it&#39;s strictly a safety/crowd control issue. At that point, he said, &nbsp;anyone on the piers who wanted to leave to use the bathroom or get a drink was issued a pass so that they could &nbsp;get back on.<br /><br />Again, I wasn&#39;t there myself last year, but this does sound like a reasonable explanation of how a rumor could have gotten started. In past years, we&#39;ve gotten there as early as 2:00 PM and seen the piers closed by about 5 or 6. &nbsp;(One year, the folks seated at those cool metal bar stools tables on the pier told us they&#39;d been there before noon.)<br /><br />If you&#39;ve never been to Gantry, its always a beautiful spot for a picnic, with or without fireworks...<br /><br />

				I certainly hope that ‘megc’ and friends will report with glowing tribute to the location and quality of the fireworks. That someone would choose to enjoy the Fourth at on the East River simply underscores the importance public access to our waterfront.<br /><br />And, although I certainly hope this year will be different, I recall hearing and seeing the same things that ‘daisy’ experienced: the security guards only allowed those with passes to get onto the piers. <br /><br />I wish that ‘Spokesmancycles’ was actually there! I do not recall any security guards on potty patrol. They did not resemble high school monitors giving hall passes.&nbsp; <br /><br />It seemed as if the piers were teaming with a large portion of Queens West.<br />&nbsp;<br />But ‘Spokesman’ did have a good point. Even if a ‘first come first served’ policy was in place, crowd control would seem like a logical reason to exclude people. <br /><br />And thanks to the insightful point raised by ‘the.’ Public property can be leased. <br /><br />‘Public access’ can be something slippery and fleeting, as just about anyone who has fallen in love with our waterfront, and spent time around it, will testify. <br /><br />There will be discussions like this on every inch of ground on the waterfront, especially when more of us will get into the other borough waterfront parks and have a chance to see the realm of possibility.<br /><br />At Gantry Park last year, we are certain that loads of people had fun. However, we found the line of security grim, the plaza hot, and after a few hours, our group retreated back to the old rooftop. <br /><br />There, for years, a ritual repeats itself. We could see hundreds, mostly immigrants, commonly, if only for a moment, sharing an uniquely American experience.&nbsp; <br /><br />The official fireworks&nbsp; began. Citicorp partially blocked one of the barges. We wondered what the waterfront would look like someday, how many more years before view would be forever blocked.<br /><br />A Guyenese buddy came over and we talked as old friends and took turns watching each others stairs. There were bonfires in the streets. Cases of rockets went off. ‘Private displays’ went up around us.<br /><br />After a while, in the distance, the fountains of shooting lava ceased. “I guess its over,” I said, and we shook hands. As he walked away, he smiled and gestured to the private displays firing over our heads unabated, “then the block has won.” <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

They are limiting the number of people for safety reasons. And, YES there are special permits already given out to . . . who knows who. Perhaps dignitaries or special residents or the press. There was also a mention of it being a TV camera location. <br /><br />The Good News:<br />The pier itself, other than those with the special permits, will be first-come-first served. My neighbors talked to a group of folks who will be spending the day there. It seems to me that you may need some kind of shelter if those afternoon thunder storms materialize. Being out on the pier with an umbrella doesn&#39;t sound too safe to me. I always thought this park attracted a lot of the family types. Yesterday it was packed to the rafters with a whole bunch of male, Wall Street types. My doggies proved to be real d*** magnets. Both gals got dates for today. YIPPEE!<br /><br />PUBLIC NOTICE:<br />Two adorable little doggies for rent. Must supply water and healthy treats. I will supply leashes and soft Frisbee. Brushing optional.&nbsp; :-D<br />

				Having just returned from the fireworks show at Gantry I can vouch for this personally:<br /><br />The place is wide open to <strong>anyone</strong> who wants to watch from <strong>anywhere </strong>. I am not a resident of any of those high rise condos and was allowed to roam freely and choose a spot wherever I wanted, including the pier. <br /><br />I dont even know what the fuss about the pier is all about anyway. Its jam packed with people, not very comfortable. Go 15 yards north and theres a nice big patch of grass where you can throw down a blanket, have a picnic and enjoy an un-obstructed view of the show while lying down if you want. <br /><br />After reading these posts on this thread for the last few days I was close to not going out of fear I would be turned away..so i&#39;m glad I did.

				thatjimguy and i went down last night - although we could have gotten in to Gantry at about 7:45 - we chose not to b/c we would have had to leave our bikes outside the &quot;no terrorist zone.&quot;&nbsp; So we ended up paying $5 (for an organization helping kids with cancer??) to gain access to the parking lot OUTSIDE of the watertaxi beach ($120 to get in the beach area - I heard).&nbsp; the location was awesome in that we were CLOSE to the water, between the middle and upper barges.&nbsp; There was fair fare for sale.&nbsp; I had my first deep fried oreos - yum.&nbsp; There was beer for sale - @ $3 a bargain for an outdoor event.&nbsp; There were some kid friendly games/moonwalk.&nbsp; Port-o-potties, elbow room - the only thing missing was... ambiance.... but heckle... you cant have EVERYTHING in a parking lot next to a construction site on the east river in an industrial area of queens.&nbsp; <br /><br />i&#39;d go back next year.

				GB: There is no doubt in my mind that this thread, and all the inquiring phonecalls, to all the local policy makers had a great influence on last nights access. I know that they felt the pressure; I know they had their *private* discussions; I also know that they are seeking private funds for bike racks in the near future.<br /><br />NYPD reported that attendance was down from last year because of the storms. That proved good for the hearty who chanced the weather. <br /><br />Frankly, the view from LIC is far better than from the invite-only gallery on the FDR. At least on this side of the river you don&#39;t have to contend with the lights blaring in your eyes and blocking your vision. I can still remember sneaking onto the rocks behind the tennis courts for the best view. Or better yet, going to Prudenti&#39;s for dinner and having them place chairs in their parking lot during the fireworks.

				I agree with NYCMacUser. Remember watching them from the bridge over Vernon in the old days.<br /><br />That being said, this topic was exhausting. But worth it! for do I sense perhaps a slight shift in the ground on the subject of Queens waterfront use? This thread probably did more to educate the public on waterfront issues than bales of local newspapers and stacks of local politicians&#39; press releases.<br /><br />I would like to learn more, and to take a closer look at, those waterfront parks in NY and Brooklyn.

When those stinkin&#39; rich folks built their HUGE homes and provided an access egress the counties allowed it. Then came the legislative fights. If the egress is on private property, and it is the only way to access the shoreline, is it legal to trespass to gain access.

				On LI my solution was to ride my bike to the &quot;private beaches.&quot;&nbsp; That way I was far less obvious about my being there, and never got a ticket.&nbsp; Many friends did, though.&nbsp; Very frustrating.<br /><br />Whereever I lived in CA the beaches were free.&nbsp; Sure there were state parks, but those aren&#39;t &quot;town beaches.&quot;&nbsp; Indeed, Malibu is one of the more prominent places that has private, inaccessible beaches, but it is an unbelievably affluent area and money talks, I guess.&nbsp; &nbsp;LI has these strange &quot;town beaches&quot; in even the most modest of neighborhoods.&nbsp; And if I couldn&#39;t prove I was a resident of the Three Village Area (Stony Brook/Setauket/Port Jefferson), I&#39;d have to pay $13 just to enter the parking lot.&nbsp; And the beach is just ok, nothing stellar.<br /><br />Anyway, the whole concept of &quot;town beaches&quot; really threw me in NY.&nbsp; That&#39;s why I&#39;d like to find some references having to do with this whole situation and understand how such things came about.&nbsp; I&#39;d rather be educated about it than blindly angry about it.

				the beach thing is WAY off topic... but I have a question<br /><br />If all the coast line is open to anybody who is taking responsibility to keep it up??<br /><br />I&#39;m all for public access.&nbsp; But I&#39;ve seen the damage that the public does to public places.&nbsp; &nbsp;We can&#39;t even keep up with the upkeep of the parks we&#39;ve got.&nbsp; <br /><br />with town beaches - at least there&#39;s a fee collected for maintenance.&nbsp; And there&#39;s a limit to the number of people who can go there - thus protecting a limited resource.&nbsp; It&#39;s elitist - but there&#39;s generally public beaches to be found near the private ones.&nbsp; Yes?? I don&#39;t know ... i&#39;m just spewing.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Discussing beach access is a topic that has been kicking around ever since the first towns were set up on Long Island 350 years ago. Library bookshelves are groaning with dozens of books written about it.<br /><br />The issue of NYC&#39;s waterfront is slightly different. NYC is planning for real parkland on most of the waterfront: not only BOTH sides of the Hudson, but along the East River for the wealthier areas in Brooklyn and Manhattan.<br /><br />In other words, most of the city.<br /><br />In direct contrast, it seems like those private development projects that are cutting the public off from the waterfront (and reserving it for the rich) is just planned for a handful of poorer areas: Red Hook, Greenpoint/Williamsburg, and Queens. &nbsp;<br /><br />Why? Look it up on zoning studies dating back to the early 1990s.<br /><br />Is this fair? Ask our elected officials. Ask our community boards. They voted for it<br /><br />The folks in Greenwich Village (http://www.gvshp.org/) have been doing marvelous work in trying to gain back their waterfront. Check out their work.<br /><br />Unlike the 70s, funding is found to maintain these places. Go ahead, walk along the existing waterfront parks in Brooklyn and Manhattan. They are stunning!<br /><br />merm, how about a new waterfront thread for this and the previous posts on access?

That&#39;s who. Not your fee to use the county beaches. Nah, that money goes into the town coffers. And who pays for the USACE? We do. It doesn&#39;t matter if you own the land, and build your damn house right on the sand, the USACE is responsible for the upkeep of the ocean front. And to make matters even worse, if you choose to build your house on a site that will errode, due to obvious weather conditions, I have to carry the expense for your flood insurance. <br /><br />Ohhhh, wait a minute . . .whhhooooooossshhhhhhh . . . . do you hear that whooshing sound? THAT&#39;S OUR COUNTRY&#39;S FOREFATHERS SPINNING IN THEIR GRAVES.<br /><br />I remember when all of the Rockaways were public access. Now those fancy homes, built in the Breezy Point section, have fenced in *their* private beaches.<br /><br />I am convinced that if we were to have another civil war it would be the rich against the rest of us. Golf courses built on lakeside property; hotels and private homes lining our shores; laws that are being changed to protect and shelter the upper classes from the lower classes— WHEW, I am getting hot under the collar, aren&#39;t I?

				On the subject of local waterfront and shoreline upkeep, I found it very satisfying to participate in the Shoreline Cleanup event that happened last September 17 at Astoria Park (and Rainey and Hallet&#39;s Cove).&nbsp; The shoreline at Astoria Park was INCREDIBLY dirty, from old pier logs to medical waste *shudder*.&nbsp; But we did a good job and it looked amazing afterwards!&nbsp; I would encourage any of you who are concerned about this sort of thing to participate this fall if they have it again (I believe they are).&nbsp; Last year lanseaux, thatjimguy, and a few other astorians participated, and that was pretty cool.&nbsp; Talk about taking things into your own hands and making a difference!

				megc, I remember reading about Long Island farmers in the 1600s chasing each other with pitchforks over the rights to mowing waterfront salt hay. <br /><br />As for more contemporary issues, try Caros&#39; &quot;Power Broker&quot; about Robert Moses. Ask the folks at the Waterfront group for more material.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />But again, I turn our attention to the Astoria WATERFRONT. What happens there over the next few years will have an impact that your great grandchildren will still experience. Lets make them proud of us. <br /><br />Call city planning. Get copies of all those plans. It really is fun reading. For example, one claims that Silvercup&#39;s 50 story buildings will only need a single traffic light adjustment to handle its 1000s. Te he he.<br /><br />Perhaps the waterfront people, who seem to be having meetings through the summer, can get speakers from the other boroughs .... THATS where you will get the real dirt. See what is going on elsewhere. Lets start to ask some tough questions. Call the politicians and community boards, (not only in Astoria, but areas that are getting the parks!)<br /><br />Gatorboy, you out there? Why don&#39;t you send us those links again?<br />

				It&#39;s exciting that the piers were open on the 4th, with no problem - don&#39;t know if my posting about elitist fireworks and the ensuing thread had anything to do with it, but maybe. Anyway, we need to keep talking about this waterfront issue, because even though we weren&#39;t prevented from enjoying the public waterfront space this time, doesn&#39;t mean that big projects like Silvercup won&#39;t be cutting us off from it in the future. I invite you all to continue the dialogue here, but also, I&#39;m going to the LICA meeting on Tues. to have further lively discussion. You can check out their website, LICAlliance.org for details on the meeting. Hope I&#39;m not breaking any rules by mentioning it here, because I did post a notice for it on Community Calender, but I only want to stress that it&#39;s a good opportunity for sharing views on topics like this. Last month, we were able to talk about the hate crime issue and rising crime in Astoria, and it was really enlightening for everyone.

				megc, there is a posting for a waterfront meeting tonight. Why don&#39;t you go an ask them good reference material? Perhaps request a speaker from Manhattan or Brooklyn that can give a presentation showing their waterfront parks. Don&#39;t listen to me, talk to someone who has a park in their neighborhood, show them our plans, gauge their reaction, and share it with us.<br /><br />Open question: can someone get a copy of the waterfront plans, any environmental studies, and any other planning studies of the neighborhood? Like to look at them in detail and go beyond the tiny images, vague description, and flood of ink from the community boards (with ties to developers/banks), civic leaders (with ties to developers/banks) and elected officials (with ties to developers/banks) telling us all how lucky we are (which goes for &#39;news&#39; in the local papers).&nbsp; <br /><br />We need someone with good connections with the politicians to get this info into the community (no I don&#39;t mean going to the community board and trying to read 100s of pages - we need our own copy). <br /><br />Any suggestions?<br /><br />Again, how about waterfront thread on the board, park vs wall?
