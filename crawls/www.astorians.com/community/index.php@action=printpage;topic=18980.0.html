				Hi guys,&nbsp; <br /><br />My cousin drowned in East River last friday and his body was found after five days. After searching a lot for his news on net and watching news, I learned that there was a lot of incidents of same sort around that area(close to Hell Gate) Lets get together and request that the area be more fenced. Stop people from going near the water.&nbsp; Don&#039;t want anyone else cousin, brother or child be found dead in there.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We Are Crying for My Cousin......who will never get his life back..........&nbsp;

				It&#039;s common knowledge that you don&#039;t go over the railing and down by the rocks near the river. <br /><br />It doesn&#039;t make much sense to begin with. It&#039;s quite a step down from street level and there is a chance you will encounter rats down there. Plus the fact it&#039;s simply not safe to be there.

				I am sorry for your loss, that is a terrible thing to have happened. <br /><br />However, I do not agree that more fencing is required.&nbsp; I would like to see less fencing actually.&nbsp; Fencing will not stop kids from getting into the water.&nbsp; The two children that died this summer in the Bronx went through fencing in an area that clearly stated that there was to be no swimming.&nbsp; Kids will do what they want.&nbsp; The kids in the bronx did it on a dare/as a challenge.&nbsp; In that case the fence proved to have the reverse effect that was intended.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t want to see the waterline of the park fenced in like a jail.&nbsp; <br /><br />Might I ask how old your cousin was?&nbsp; I did not see or hear anything in the news about this tragedy.&nbsp; I am curious as to what happened?

				My condolences on the loss of your cousin. The currents near the Hell Gate Bridge as very strong. People do things when they&#039;re with friends which they wouldn&#039;t normally do when they&#039;re alone. I do recall hearing about people drowning in that vicinity in the past, although this is the first in recent memory. Adding better fences would help avoid a similar tragedy in the future.

				I&#039;m sorry for your family&#039;s loss, but there is a fence that goes around each person&#039;s freedom to choose what they do and that person alone is responsible for when to open the gate.

You can build a high fence and someone will find a way to climb over it. Or through it as they did in the Bronx. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what happened that night. But, I haven&#039;t heard a thing that suggest&#039;s that a fence would have changed a thing. <br /><br />The thing is this....we are a city surrounded on many sides by water. And we can wrap those many sides by fences.....But then, wouldn&#039;t feel like a prison? <br /><br />I&#039;ve walked many areas of NYC over the last 9 years. I&#039;ve traveled from Pelham Bay to Far Rockaway. I&#039;ve enjoyed the journey...and I can&#039;t imagine the same experience if there was a fence around the shores of our great city. <br /><br />There are moments....singular....where the world changes.......but we can&#039;t sanitize the world to protect everyone. We can&#039;t build fences around the entire world to save one person.....<br /><br />Again, I don&#039;t know what happened.....but I have a feeling a fence wouldn&#039;t have changed a thing. <br />

				I remember this incident that happened last Friday night. I heard about this on FDNY scanner live online. There were 3 witnesses who saw him jump into the water,there was a huge response from both FDNY and NYPD,but as you know the currents are really strong around there. It took at least 20 minutes before a FDNY marine rescue boat arrived at the scene. I know it wasn&#039;t on the news or anything but something like this happens more often then we think. I am not talking about people jumping off a bridge, but something like this,maybe he wanted to cool off and go for a swim I don&#039;t know the reason why he jumped<br />in the water.<br /><br />You shouldn&#039;t go around trying to blame somebody else,I surely hope no lawsuit against the city is in the works either. You make <br />it sound like it was an accident when you say he was at the wrong place at the wrong time. He wasn&#039;t pushed into the river right?

				I am incredibly sorry for your loss and wish there is something we could do to take away the pain.<br /><br />I think the best solution to the many problems that need to be improved upon int he park is greater police interaction with the community. It is one thing to see police drive by in a cruiser....it is another to see police interact on bikes, go up to people who are clearly intoxicated and by the river (not that your loved one was) but is just an example. <br /><br />Also quality of life offenses will continue unless the police start walking the park, handing out tickets for litter, noice violations, public drinking, thugs menacing families...

				We don&#039;t need more fences, just more common sense. And the ability to accept the fact that things happen in life, and that there is no way to prevent that. No matter how many fences or cops or laws or cameras there are, sometimes accidents happen. Sorry for your loss, and maybe someone will learn a lesson from your family&#039;s pain.
