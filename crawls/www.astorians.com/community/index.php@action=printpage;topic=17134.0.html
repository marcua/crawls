				I would like to call forward anyone who already does or wants to understand Oneness.&nbsp; <br /><br />As most of us are busy on our computers and not out in the cold (I love warmth), I think it would be good to <br />see how many of us we can rally up, perhaps in the spring we can move to a park!<br /><br />What is the purpose?&nbsp; If you are in tuned to your ability to manifest and to heal yourself and/or others, lets see <br />the exponential power of summoning our cumulative energies in focused intention.&nbsp; Sending them out as Ripples of Happiness &amp; Love.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />We can all choose the focus of our intention-we pick and intention, than simultaneously we send our intention out beyond our (*)Etheric bodies. <br /><br />I anticipating seeing an tremendous response of my fellow beings... so we can vibrate ripples of Love &amp; Happiness during conscious awareness at&nbsp; 1:11am, 11:11am, 11:11pm, 1:11am.&nbsp; Pick the intention and focus upon it, at any or all of these times. <br /><br />I am sensitive to this number-actually when I got the inclination to do this it was 1:11am.&nbsp; (I do type slowly.&nbsp; I do most everything slowly &amp; deliberately, with focus and passion, and love.&nbsp; Well, I go of on tangents as well).&nbsp; I stay up late researching the human existence, specifically mine. <br />Recently I have been questioning the numbers that come up during the course of my daydream through life, one manifestation after the other.<br />The clocks, pages of books, billboards, license plates, ect... some of the meanings I choose to believe.&nbsp; (there are many levels of belief, spiritual, universal, cosmic, religious, angelic, political......I choose what resonates with my being) are: <br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>(**)11:11 =Oneness</li><li>(***)111 - Monitor your thoughts carefully, and be sure to only think about what you want, not what you don&#039;t want. This sequence is a sign that there is a gate of opportunity opening up, and your thoughts are manifesting into form at record speeds. The 111 is like the bright light of a flash bulb. It means the universe has just taken a snapshot of your thoughts and is manifesting them into form. Are you pleased with what thoughts the universe has captured? If not, correct your thoughts (ask your angels to help you with this if you have difficulty controlling or monitoring your thoughts).</li></ul>&nbsp; <br /><br />I encourage you to do the same.&nbsp; I am on Facebook, twitter, Youtube, Blogspot and I post links and videos I have accumulated and like to watch over and share.&nbsp; Please do the same find what you resonate with and share.&nbsp; Together we can heal humanity, the earth, all the other Life Forms that contribute to and depend upon it.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />All of my senses are opening!&nbsp; How this came to me.&nbsp; During and After a wonderful almost 2 hr. Bikram Yoga session, I was feeling and focusing my intentions on healing myself, detoxifying my body, strengthening my muscles and bones.&nbsp; Positively affirming my state of being.&nbsp; When I returned home <br />I fed myself with intention-conscious of what I was eating, what values it held, and what was being nourished; showered with intentional cleansing, meditated, and afterward just lay there letting my thoughts drift to people I had included in my prayer intention.&nbsp; &nbsp;My cats love candles, so they were close to me, especially my younger cat, who is also very in tune to vibrations.&nbsp; He lay right on my chest, pawing me and caressing my face with his paw.&nbsp; <br /><br />In that moment I felt such amazing Joy and Happiness, that It consumed every fiber of my being, welling up in my chest.&nbsp; I could not contain my tears, they swelled until ripe and trickled down my face.&nbsp; &nbsp;Words can not convey to immensity of this sensation.&nbsp; I recalled the words my angelic mother saying &quot;when you experience pain and suffering, offer it up to Jesus, and to God&quot;.&nbsp; I don&#039;t wish to re-experience any pain and suffering even for memory and I don&#039;t experience too much of it; because, I am most always happy.&nbsp; I had no sorrow or suffering - so I offered up my Happiness and Love like as throwing pebbles and stones into a pond, In that instant.&nbsp; &nbsp;I released all the energy contained in that Boulder and dropped it into the Universe.&nbsp; It was flowing through me as I reflected on everything I had experienced through out the day, what I was grateful for, conversations and spending time in company with people I enjoy, doing what I love to do. Float thru life.&nbsp; I sent it to Haiti for all and especially Bill&#039;s family, Diane and Christen, Annemarie and Bob, my mother, my daughter, my son, my husband, Carmen, Tanya, Angela...............&nbsp; <br /><br />Today was miraculous!!! I want to feel and share more days like this with all of you who are interested.&nbsp; Just imaging of the magnitude of healing and love we can spread.&nbsp; Being conscience that although we are many-WE ARE ONE.&nbsp; We can break the rules and throw rocks in the times of Oneness. <br /><br />Peace and Love to you all! :smitten:<br />Marlene<br />Please pass this on. <br /><br />Kismet the responsibility of the ascending soul<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvEmWOSjSvs (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvEmWOSjSvs)<br /><br /><br /><br />(*)taken from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etheric_body (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etheric_body)<br />The etheric body, <em><strong>ether-body, Ã¦ther body, a name given by neo-Theosophy to a supposed vital body propounded in esoteric philosophies as the first or lowest layer in the &quot;human energy field&quot; or aura.[1] It is said to be in immediate contact with the physical body, to sustain it and connect it with &quot;higher&quot; bodies.</strong></em>&nbsp; <br /><br />(**)http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnB8znYCWtw&amp;feature=related (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnB8znYCWtw&amp;feature=related)<br /><br />(***) http://spiritlibrary.com/doreen-virtue/number-sequences-from-the-angels (http://spiritlibrary.com/doreen-virtue/number-sequences-from-the-angels)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://angelscribe.com/1111.html (http://angelscribe.com/1111.html)<br /><br />
