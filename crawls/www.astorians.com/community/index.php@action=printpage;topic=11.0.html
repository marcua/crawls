				I like Thirty-One's pizza (31st btwn Ditmars and 23rd Ave). &nbsp;They also have a nice dining room in the back for dinner, but don't go when it's raining -the skylights leak!<br />My wife votes for Pizza Palace, btw.

				I like Last Stop the best because they have really good crust. Otherwise I honestly am not much of a pizza fan - unless it is simple mediterranean style with good crust.

				For terrific italian food, I highly recommend &quot;Phillies&quot; on Ditmars between 20th &amp; 21st Street. &nbsp;Cozy atmosphere, delicious food! &nbsp;Also, for Japanese quisine, particularly sushi, Go Wasabi (on Ditmars off of 31st street). &nbsp;I also highly recommend &quot;Ditmars Pizza&quot; on Ditmars &amp; about 23rd Street? &nbsp;Contrary to the uninspired name and decor, this is a great place for pizza and greek food. &nbsp;They even make terrific homemade rice pudding on occasion. &nbsp;The husband &amp; wife who run the establishment (Mike &amp; Elizabeth) are the nicest people in the world. &nbsp;Check it out and enjoy!

				Rose and Joe's on 31 has very good &quot;bakery&quot; pan pizza. It is the sauce especially that makes it good, however the dour females who work there can be a challenge. Porto Bello in the strip mall down where they are refurbishing the old Steinway Piano Factory on 41st has excellent pizza as well, and smiles too. Pizza Palace now offers whole wheat pizza which is worth a try. They are friendly there too. Last Stop on 31 St. Never had their pizza but the Chicken Parm Hero for $6.00 is great.

				Grand Ave. is good, better than the others I've tried in southern Astoria; I don't know about northern Astoria. &nbsp;But what I really like about Grand Ave. is the peace and quiet. &nbsp;It has no radio, no TV, no canned or live music, just blessed silence. &nbsp;I go there with a book, order a hero, and read before and after I have my meal.

				we are so lucky to have the Golden triangle of pizza right under the ditmars stop. &nbsp;Rose &amp; Joes, Rosarios and Frankies. &nbsp;Pizza Palass BLOWS.

				What is wrong with Pizza Palace? I find it to be quite delicious and very consistent, with generous and tasty toppings (except for the spinach and broccoli, but I would never recommend getting spinach and/or broccoli on pizza to begin with). I guess if you don't like their pizza once you'll never like it, but I think everything about it is perfect.

				I was born and raised in Astoria and like most Astorian's we know for years we have the best bread and pizza in the world, must be something in the water. Now I am not going to say what I think is the best pizza out there but I will tell you of one of the oldest pizzeria's in Astoria. If you go to the corner of 14 Street and 30 Drive. you will find S&amp;S Pizza which has been there for over 40 years and it is still the same great quality of pizza. Sal and Silvio used to run the operation for years but it is now being run by their nephew for some time now. When I am feeling nostalgic I can always count on S&amp;S to take me back to my youth. The whole neighborhood was raised on this stuff... The neighborhood has changed considerably now but this pizza will raise a whole new generation. Give them a try sometime

				I have lately been going to Boston Pizza on 37 Street and Broadway, after my karaoke shows, because they are always opened late... The Pizza is simply great, it sort of reminds me of the old Bakery Pizza by MT. Carmel that we used to get when I was a kid. That was truly the best pizza. Just ask any MT Carmel Alumni and they will all agree. But getting back to Boston Pizza, it is really good pizza and Charlie the owner there is a great guy who will sometimes even serenade you with his singing and guitar playing... Go and check it out! Tell Charlie that Richie the Karaoke guy sent you and ask him to sing you a song...

				IMO Boston Pizza is the WORST in Astoria, followed by Grand Ave. I'm astonished that it does any business in New York, not only with a name like that, but with its awful convenience-store taste. You get better pizza at a gas station off the Thruway. Blech!<br /><br />Star Pizza on Steinway is quite good. A real <em>paisano</em> runs the place.

				Actually, I think Grand Ave's focaccia pizzia great! Grand Ave also makes a really good veggie pie, and killer eggplant parm, but over all their 'za sucks.

				Hmm, I'll have to give Grand Ave's foccacia a try... :)<br /><br />I used to be a regular at Pizza Palace (much to my waistline's chagrin... ;) ) until they upped their price to $2.10 a slice. Now I know a dime's not that much, but it seems too pricy for what is just standard fare as far as 'za goes. Kinda took the shine off going there on a regular basis.
