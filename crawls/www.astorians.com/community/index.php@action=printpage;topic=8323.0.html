				My name is Abby.&nbsp; &nbsp; I have completed a 200 hour yoga teacher training program and I am certified to teach students of all levels.&nbsp; &nbsp;My program was quite extensive.&nbsp; We studied what is refered to as both the “subtle” and the “physical” body and thus gained an understanding of yoga as both a mental, spiritual, and highly physical practice.&nbsp; My teacher training program, therefore also focused on anatomy and taught us how to modify each and every posture for those with certain injuries or lack of flexibility<br /><br />Last year, I taught yoga at my law school.&nbsp; This was a great opportunity to see yoga’s benefits at work.&nbsp; Students were pressed for time, stressed, and needed a quick way to get fit.&nbsp; Our one-hour yoga classed focused on flexibility (sitting and studying is very hard on your body) and stress reduction.<br /><br />I am interested in teaching a class that offers a great mind-body workout.&nbsp; I am able to teach all levels and enjoy working with both beginners and more advanced practitioners.<br />I am available weeknights and weekends.&nbsp; <br />
