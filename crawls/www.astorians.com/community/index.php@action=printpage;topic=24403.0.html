				Hi! I&#039;m looking for an apartment and (a) roommate(s) in Astoria.&nbsp; I&#039;m a 23-year-old female recent graduate from the University of Rhode Island.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for an apartment that must have: 2 bedrooms, dishwasher, a washer/drier in the building, has a parking space for my car, wifi, close to the subway, and preferably under $1,000 including utilities.&nbsp; I would feel more comfortable having roommates that are girls too, who are also neat, drug &amp; drama-free, non-smokers.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Hey Julie , i can see you are new to Astoria&nbsp; , and just to let you know while many apts might have some of your requirements , to get all of them&nbsp; is almost impossible . You have a better chance if you head to a newer or new building to get all that but its gonna cost . No one includes a parking space that i have ever heard of and i grew up in Astoria my entire life .&nbsp; &nbsp;If you want a garage you would have to rent that out at additional cost .&nbsp; Very few buildings include WIFI for free but you might be able to get it added to your rent at a lesser price then you would pay if you got it alone by yourself .&nbsp; Sorry but&nbsp; just being honest .&nbsp; &nbsp;Dishwasher , and washing machines r usually new or newer buildings&nbsp; at higher end apts but they arent cheap . The rents here seem to being going up and up , so you might find something in your range a little farther from the train but def walking distance . If you wanna be very close get ready to overpay .

				Hey Julie,<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m 24 and I just moved to Astoria about 7-8 months ago so I know what it&#039;s like to try to apartment hunt from afar.<br /><br /><br />I think it&#039;s possible for you to get most of those things, except the parking spots. That&#039;s definitely going to be extra, unless you&#039;re willing to either park your car in an inconvenient location where there&#039;s not alternate side parking or have to drive around endlessly looking for parking at night. If you&#039;re willing to live either farther east (Steinway and beyond) or farther north (Ditmars area) you can find things for cheaper. You probably won&#039;t be able to find your own place for &lt; $1,000 but you could probably find a place that fits most of those requirements.<br /><br /><br />Feel free to message me if you have any questions :)

				Julie, my son is 28. He&#039;s in the same situation you are. He&#039;s from Tallahassee, Florida.&nbsp; He has been in NYC since last Thursday. I&#039;m researching all over the internet trying to help him find a place in Astoria.&nbsp; NO, he&#039;s not a momma&#039;s boy. In fact far from it. He&#039;s the quintessential example of small town southern boy heading to the city to live out his dreams. I know I&#039;m his mom, but I have to say he&#039;s a really cute (works out everyday) and sweet. He doesn&#039;t smoke, loves animals and is a hard working guy. I&#039;m gonna miss hanging out with him so much. He has a car and a dog with him and he is convinced, after driving around for the last few days, that he wants to live in Astoria.&nbsp; Maybe you two can combine efforts??? I know I might be reaching for straws here. I don&#039;t know how to support him from such a great distance. I&#039;ve just about worn a hole in my floor pacing back and forth and I have no nails left. Just hoping he finds a place soon. Definitely think the two of you might be able to work something out in Astoria together. :cheesy:&nbsp; Sleep on it and let me know what you think. He starts his first day tomorrow and won&#039;t be available until after 5. <br /><br /><br />Thanks for your time - M

				Hey! So me and my two friends (both girls) recently found a 4BR in the heart of Astoria that we couldn&#039;t pass up. The only problem is that there is three of us and we need a fourth! so we are looking for someone to come live with a group of fun girls who are low key but enjoy having fun. We all are ages 22/23 and work in manhattan. The Apartment is amazing, completely renovated and has two FULL bathrooms so there is plenty of space for all of us. Let me know if you have any questions.
