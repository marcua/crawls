				I know I&#039;ll regret this, but here goes.<br /><br />Are there any theatre artists interested in forming a SERIOUS theatre group here in Astoria.<br /><br />By serious I don&#039;t mean all downcast historical tragedy. (I personally live by the quote. &quot;dying is easy...comedy is hard&quot;.)<br /><br />I mean serious to an ensemble being formed in this neighborhood. Something that can actually become something. <br /><br />I was a part of a great group on Cape Cod that had people who were legends, people who were working hard to make it in their professsion, people who were working hard to make it their profession, people who thought they were gloriously talented but not actually walked onto a real stage, etc., etc., etc.<br /><br />We all have our reasons why we&#039;d want to do something like this, so let&#039;s ge together and find out if it&#039;s possible.<br /><br />Anyone interested?

				This is my own addendum...I&#039;m not just talking about actors. (I&#039;m an actor who found that I was a director...and love doing it...lowest comedy to Shakespeare.<br /><br />I&#039;m talking about directors dcenic designers, costume designers, stage managers, company managers...everyone.<br /><br />Start small and build it.

				This thread sure is quiet. I&#039;d be interested in meeting like-minded theater folk and exploring the possibilities. I come from an acting background as well, but I&#039;ve done a lot of crew work, including lights, sound, props and, of course directing. I&#039;ve also been on the board of a theater group in Tokyo. At different times, I was responsible for assigning volunteers, finding venues (in Japanese no less), interviewing directors, and finding plays/musicals that would be realistic to our budget and talent pool while still appealing to our audience. It&#039;s quite a bit of work to put even a bare-bones production together, so I&#039;d only be interested if I knew I wasn&#039;t going to be the one stuck with having to do all the un-fun work while everyone else was just interested in being superstars.

				I think it&#039;s actually harder to do community theater in NYC than it is in, say, Cape Cod, or in North Carolina (where I come from).&nbsp; <br /><br />Astoria is chock full of terrific, talented theater people.&nbsp; I know quite a few of them.&nbsp; Actors, designers, box office staff, company managers, stage managers, singers, dancers, musicians, etc etc etc.&nbsp; This is a great neighborhood for theater people since it&#039;s so inexpensive, close to midtown, and arts-friendly, but it tends to support a commuting theater population rather than a population that wants to actually do theater out in the neighborhood.&nbsp; The problem is that so many of them are pursuing professional theater careers over on the other side of the East River, and for various reasons (some of which relate to schedules and some of which are more complicated*), it&#039;s difficult to do community theater. <br /><br />I don&#039;t want to make it sound impossible, though, because Astoria has supported some great theater (APAC for one) and I&#039;m sure there&#039;s room for more, plus hopefully we&#039;ll have some community access to the performing arts facilities they&#039;re building at the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts on 35th Ave?&nbsp; Seriously, there are challenges, but I hope you can overcome them and pull something together.&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:&nbsp; There have to be people with other jobs who would be interested in community productions, and hopefully you can get them together.<br /><br />(*I&#039;m contractually forbidden from getting involved with any producing organizations because of conflict of interest issues from my day job.&nbsp; That&#039;s just my own example.&nbsp; :|)<br />

				As far as I&#039;m concerned, anyone doing Equity showcases or non-equity shows in Manhattan as still doing community theater. So it can&#039;t be <em>that</em> hard since a jillion of these productions are put up every year.<br /><br />What I&#039;d have in mind is a group of producers who&#039;d put up a showcase (or something) every few months and just find the crew and talent as we go. There&#039;s hardly a shortage of actors out there who just want something to do. The real challenge is in finding the crew and audience.

				I&#039;m a full time designer but I&#039;m interested in something like this if I could make it work with my schedule.&nbsp; I do a lot of traditional shows in my normal work - in a setting like this I&#039;d like to be working on new, exciting projects that have more to offer artistically.<br /><br />I wonder how much money it would take, and also how much is available, to get something like this going.
