				April 22nd Saturday 8pm - Midnight<br />Zenon Taverna<br />34-10 31st street (between 34&amp;35th streets) Astoria, NY<br />www.zenontaverna.com (http://www.zenontaverna.com)<br /><br />After much consultation with executive board member Flooz &amp; the owner of Zenon, The following menu and pricing is offered:<br /><br />BUFFET DINNER&nbsp; &nbsp;$35.90 per person<br />Available for 25 people minimum.<br />(Menu #3 on website plus the salmon dish)<br />(Includes unlimited beer, house wine and soda)<br /><br />Cold Appetizers<br />Greek Salad&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Tzantziki<br />Seafood Salad<br /><br />Hot Appetizers<br />Halloumi<br />Char-grilled Octopus<br />Spinach Pie<br /><br />Buffet Table<br />Roasted Leg Of Lamb<br />Chicken Francaise<br />Salmon dish (TBD by owner)<br />Fried Calamari<br />Keftedes<br />Sheftalies<br />Pasboobsio<br />Roasted Potatoes<br />Rice<br /><br />Also included: Coffee and Fresh Fruit for Everyone<br /><br />Extra expenses: taxes and a minimum tip of $100 to our waiter for the evening.&nbsp; <br />That shouldnt cost more than about $44 per person.<br /><br />Comments:<br />Can everyone be happy with this menu and pricing?<br />We will have our own private room and sound system. Who will bring the music?<br />You can order hard alcoholic drinks from the waiter (pay as you go).<br />We can remove the unlimited beer and wine ($10.95 per person) but it seems pretty cheap.<br />A 1/3 deposit must be paid in advance (about $350 cash or check, no CC).<br />Final group size will be phoned in on wednesday April 19th.<br /><br />I hope you all say yes to this proposal.&nbsp;

Saving too much room might be constrictive. Perhaps we should build up to gluttony. Though All You Can Eat is a possibility, it is not a dare.&nbsp; :lol:<br />I have a feeling the EATS will be getting the better part of the deal. Or is this the DRINKS.<br />It may be what some spend on drinks in an evening is my annual.<br />Unless you are talking Dr. Pepper. (A big piece of my pie chart. My hope is to be enshrined in their museum some day.)<br /><br />So anything coming up for the fifth evening of the fifth month?<br />Maybe a salad,&nbsp; or a baked potato, or rice&amp;beans, or a moutain side of nachos.<br />(the hot sauce discussion is hilarious; I am a wimp. I remember someone had a homemade sauce and dramaticly dipped a fork in to let drops roll off. Thought it was a joke, until a short time delay after... Not meant for most humans)<br /><br />April seems like a very fine month to have a Gala in Astoria.<br />Again, thanks for the planning.<br /><br />&quot;We ate the food - we drank the wine<br />Everybody having a good time&quot;

				Looks like we are up to 14 people.&nbsp; Thats 11 short of the minimum. <br /><br />Two choices:<br />1. Remove the beer,wine and soda.

				Maybe just wait &#39;til the end of next week before deciding to see who else jumps in? It&#39;s a really good deal ... (I spent as much at the Beer Garden) and sounds delicious ... in the meantime, take backup ideas? Definitely don&#39;t want to see this get cancelled.

				I admit that I&#39;ve been sitting on the fence about the fixed price menu.&nbsp; I echo an earlier post in that I don&#39;t eat very much in one sitting and I am not a big drinker - but that doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t enjoy having good food with good people!<br /><br />Zenon is still good for me (without the unlimited beer/wine) but I will certainly keep checking to see what other ideas come about.<br />

				hmmm, i guess trying to get this many people signed onto to something concrete is a bit difficult. i think for the amount of time this post has been up, we should have already had enough people in. being that we haven&#39;t for one reason or another- i think people should start giving other suggestions. I&#39;d be more then happy to offer my ticket price up now for the down payment but its not looking like we will get enough people. Jonathan-do you think Zenon would let 5 tables worht of us just have dinner? It would be a bit more of a pain in the main room and al but that may be the other option? that way everyone could eat as much or little as they want? Whatever we do, i think we need to decide asap-before Jonathan and Jennifer go on vacation at least!

				I&#39;d say we&#39;re too far away from the 25 min to book anything.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Oh well -<br /><br />so we can see who wants to go and order off the menu - and try to make a reservation for that many (at many small tables).&nbsp; But as I recall Zenon is not a very large place - and there might be an issue with the next day being Greek Easter (I think).&nbsp; So I&#39;m not sure we&#39;ll be able to squeeze in.&nbsp; <br />So if there&#39;s another place people are thinking about....<br /><br />throw it out there.&nbsp; <br /><br />My take on the dinners - 20+ is WAY too many for dinner (my husband would disagree), unless we&#39;re in our own room like we were at the beer garden.&nbsp; I&#39;d like to see more dinners get posted - but closer to the date of the event - so that there are perhaps bimonthly or even weekly gatherings of 10 or fewer.&nbsp; <br /><br />I do love the idea of a potluck.&nbsp; We&#39;re definitely willing to have one here - just not on the day after we get back from a trip.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I still like the idea of Zenon...how, in Astoria, can we have gone so long without visiting a Greek restaurant?&nbsp; But if it&#39;s not the best option, it&#39;s not the best option, so I&#39;m on board for whatever is chosen.<br /><br />Re: 20+: I sort of semi-agree with both J &amp; J.&nbsp; Twenty is a big crowd.&nbsp; It narrows the available options and makes it more difficult to socialize with everyone.&nbsp; On the other hand, it feels really good to see everyone and have almost the whole EATS community together.&nbsp; <br />Also, there are probably others like me who, seeing a proposed restaurant, thing &quot;OOOOHHHH!&nbsp; I got to try that one!&quot; and will end up signing on to nearly all the dinners...how do you keep the numbers down?

Maybe this group works better as a source of friends for smaller, more impromptu gatherings (Wave tonight, that spicy food place you guys were talking about). <br /><br />We can still do larger group dinners, but they&#39;ll just have to be limited to places that we know can accomodate us... It&#39;s not ideal, but there&#39;s also nothing to stop any of us from trying a new spot by just e-mailing out and asking for any takers. <br /><br />As for Zenon, even if it doesn&#39;t work out to go for our big April outing, if anyone wants to go anytime, just let us know... and if people are available, we can make a (smaller) outing of it. If I&#39;m available, I&#39;m definitely in!

				i&#39;m late in commenting on dinner, sorry! It was scrum dilly!!!! meat overload kinda, but dang i did love everthing i got my grubby paws on. The pics this time were minimal sad to say. Its like the hunger took over and by the time i realized i didn&#39;t clic, the food was pretty much gone. My two favorite things i think were those damn garlic mashed potatoes and the awesomely tender and tasty calamari! I will try to get the few pics i did take up soon.<br />It was so nice meeting some new EATers! Welcome BornBKLYN and hikaruhana, hope you make it out to many more. <br />And it was nice to see TRX again, haven&#39;t seen you since Tacos Mexico!<br /><br /><em>* anyone still missing nametags and/or passport and want one please let me know here...</em><br />•MandaT-passport<br />•mightimic-passport/nametag<br />•JustRachel-passport
