				Scott Adams (of Dilbert) published a fantasy of running for president on his blog (http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2006/05/pragmatic_party.html) today. <br /><br />&quot;You need one Big Idea when you run for President. I would explain that our current system of government was conceived prior to the Internet, electronic mass media, and sophisticated polling methods. 200 years ago the only practical form of government involved voting for a small group of individuals that would pretend to represent you. Now we have better tools and we should use them. I would thus infer that my opponents are hole-pooping cavemen desperately clinging to the past. Again, that’s called framing the debate. I’d get lots of TV time because the media would consider me a loose cannon. They like that.&quot;<br /><br />It sounds pretty damn good. Of course, then a system would be set up that might be abusive in the wrong hands. <br /><br />What do y&#39;all think? Would you vote for Scott?

We&#39;ll install him as dictator after the coup -- don&#39;t you induhviduals worry about a thing...<br /><br />It&#39;s actually a pretty interesting article about how he wants to be chairman of a direct democracy. Would I vote for him? Well, no. If cartoonists were running, I think I&#39;d prefer Berkeley Breathed...

				Direct democracy is just about the most dangerous form of government there is.&nbsp; Our founding fathers wisely founded a constitutional republic with some democratic features, rather than a democracy.

				See, I was wondering about that but I was hoping that someone else would do the heavy lifting and tell us all why. <br /><br />Don&#39;t be shy, goldfish boy. Tell us what you think.

				Democracy is mob rule.&nbsp; It&#39;s &quot;there are more of us than there are of you, so what we say goes.&quot;&nbsp; A democracy can legitimize mass killing, torture, whatever as long as a majority wants it.&nbsp; And safeguards (requiring supermajorities, a bill of rights, whatever) are meaningless in a true democracy because a majority can vote to abolish those.&nbsp; Thus, the only defense a minority (anyone who disagrees with and/or is disliked by a majority) has against the majority is armed force--and since the police in a democracy are controlled by the majority, any minority must take the law into his or her own hands--and hope he or she has enough firepower to compensate for lack of numbers.
