				I miss singing! Does anyone else? What style are you interested in -&nbsp; &nbsp; barbershop, madrigals, pop, jazz, or a little bit of everything? <br /><br />anyone interested in getting together for a relaxed jam ... and just seeing if any good vocal combinations pop out of nowhere?

I can sing on key and have a pretty good ear; can&#39;t read music though. I&#39;m just never sure if it sounds <em>good</em> I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some musical term for the quality of one&#39;s voice when singing on key. <br /><br />That being said, I love to sing. Since I moved to the city, I don&#39;t drive, and I really miss it because I used to love to sing in my car.

				Ooh, this sounds great!&nbsp; Count me in!&nbsp; &nbsp;I did everything from regular choir, to all state choir and performing ensemble (16 people, dancing/singing), to Candlelight Processional at Christmas at Disneyworld.&nbsp; I sang first soprano for a little while, but I&#39;m a much stronger second alto and did more of that later.&nbsp; I really really miss singing and have been known to participate in many karaoke rituals!&nbsp; I&#39;ll warn you guys though,&nbsp; I can&#39;t read music, but if someone else can, I&#39;m really quick to catch on.

				Ok, then, I think we have the talent ready.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; When are we gonna get this party started?<br /><br />Oh yeah, forgot to mention, I had a good couple years&#39; worth of vocal lessons as a young teen.&nbsp; Jonesin&#39; for some serious vocalization!&nbsp; I realize the Iron Chef thing didn&#39;t work out for me, so I&#39;m now all about the singin&#39;!&nbsp; Enigmacat, what do you think?

				I think we should find a place where we can get together and sing and go for it! Maybe we can all bring one or two favorite songs to sing (words, sheet music, or just the idea) and just see what happens. <br /><br />I guess I can volunteer my apartment. None of you seem the axe-murdering type... :) How about Thursday after work?

				I may be able to offer my apartment as a meeting space.&nbsp; I&#39;d have to run it past my sis, since she lives here too, and all.&nbsp; Maybe we can alternate who hosts.&nbsp; My free nights are Monday, Tuesday, and every other Wednesday.&nbsp; I have no sheet music, no stereo, but the living room is big, there are lots of seats, and an air conditioner.&nbsp;

				I might be up for this, but I&#39;m a tad shy.&nbsp; :oops:&nbsp; I&#39;ve spent a very small amount of time singing in church choirs... and I used to be a BIG car singer, but alas, that is no more. I won&#39;t even sing in my shower anymore because I know the whole building can hear me (small building, thin walls).
