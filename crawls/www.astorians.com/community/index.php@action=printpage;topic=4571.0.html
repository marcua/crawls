				I think they are really nice, but the apartments they showed my roomate and I weren&#39;t great.&nbsp; They promised us that one apartment was the only 2 bedroom around in our price range and really pressured us into putting down a deposit--we resisted and sure enough the next place we saw (with another broker) was much much nicer.&nbsp; Then again, we also paid a GIANT fee.&nbsp; But it was worth it since we&#39;re sticking around.

				I seem to remember MQ telling me over the phone that they charge 15% of a year&#39;s rent.&nbsp; When I replied that plenty of brokers in the area charge a month&#39;s fee, they claimed their rentals were &quot;the best, and worth the money, and I wouldn&#39;t get the same service elsewhere&quot;.&nbsp; I went elsewhere, and got a great apartment and wonderful service for a month&#39;s fee.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is a thread on here with realtor&#39;s recommendations.&nbsp; We should make it a sticky or somthing.&nbsp; This realtor question keeps coming up.

				MQ is horrible.<br />They will pressure you to put deposits down on apartments they can&#39;t deliver on.<br />Then they have your deposit money and you have to get an apartment with them. Then you will never see something decent again.<br />Run run run.<br /><br />

				yup it was Gary that tried to pressure us.<br />we got suspicious because he actually started sweating and took us outside in the hallway so that the other people siging leases couldn&#39;t hear him convince us that he needed our cash (a full month&#39;s deposit) in order to process the application.<br />He actually tried to walk us to an ATM on a sunday afternoon to get 1300.<br />we ran from there. just felt slimy.

				Oh yeah...MQ Realty. They are infamous for unprofessionalism. <br /><br />Case 1: My ex-roommate was looking for an apartment and used them. They did that deposit scam but she argued her butt off and chased them for days and brought her boyfriend to the office till they finally decided to give her the deposit back. <br /><br />Case 2: I go there and say I want to find an apartment in astoria. The girl looks at me and says, sorry you should be looking in Elmhurst. <br /><br />I guess me and my ex-roommate had good karma because no more than 4 days after our experience, we both found and got approved for very nice apartments in Astoria! <br /><br />FYI - this put down a deposit scam also happens in other places. It happened to me also when I was looking in Forest Hills. But I found the guy at his second job and he had no choice but to give me back the money.&nbsp; :mrgreen:
