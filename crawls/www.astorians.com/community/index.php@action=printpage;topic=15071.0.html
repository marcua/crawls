				I am viewing a studio apt today around the Ditmars area and just wanted to get some opinions.&nbsp; It is a walk-in semi-basement, all utilities included, 1 parking space included, five blocks from the train station, full kitchen, and bathroom for $1100/mo.&nbsp; Is this a good price for a basement studio?&nbsp; Also, does anyone have any advise or share any experience living in studio basements in Astoria?&nbsp; I am a little hesistent because I have heard some horror stories about basement condition (flooding, unhealthy living conditions, etc).&nbsp; Thank you

				Not sure about basement living but if it comes with a parking space that really isn&#039;t a horrible price.

				There&#039;s nothing wrong with basement apartments in general. &nbsp;I&#039;ve been in one for the past year and with exception to the lower than average ceilings I have absolutely no complaints. &nbsp;I also don&#039;t get a lot of direct sunlight, but it also stays pretty cool in the summer.&nbsp; Just like any other apartment you&#039;ll have to some thorough checking for infestations, water damage, etc. &nbsp;<br /><br />$1100 seems within range, not cheap nor overly priced. &nbsp;It would depend on the apartment&#039;s condition to determine whether it&#039;s a good deal. &nbsp;The fact that utilities are included is nice, but also raises a question on the legality of the apartment. &nbsp;Just something to look out for.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ll just say that&#039;s what my sunny, third floor one bedroom apartment costs. But it&#039;s in an older building, and I don&#039;t have a parking space, and my utilities are separate. <br /><br />I think it&#039;s within the range of normal pricing, but make sure it&#039;s a legal apartment. Check out Rentometer &nbsp;(http://www.rentometer.com)to get an idea of pricing, and you can use this site (http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/html/home/home.shtml) to check in the Certificate of Occupancy to see whether the apartment is legal.

				Thanks for all your inputs!&nbsp; As for the legality issue of the apartment, what repercussions am i looking at if caught living in an &quot;illegal&quot; apt.&nbsp; Is this type of living space usually just &quot;looked away from&quot; or is it very common around astoria?

				From what I understand, these apartments are illegal because they can be dangerous to live in. It might not be up to code. There could be problems with flooding, mold, carbon monoxide poisoning, not enough exits in case of emergencies/fires, etc. You wouldn&#039;t get into trouble for living there, but the landlord would get into trouble for renting it out, and you&#039;d probably be required to move. You might have difficulties with rental insurance or other services (if the apartment isn&#039;t legal, it might not be registered at the address and therefore &quot;doesn&#039;t exist&quot; in terms of being insurable).

				Hi Adee<br /><br />If utilities are included there’s a good chance this apartment is illegal. Does it have two exits, i.e., is there another door or window you can get out of in case of fire? If not I&#039;d seriously reconsider taking this place.<br /><br />Also, if the department of buildings finds out about it you could be forced to move out with limited notice at your own expense. And though horror situations may be rare, as you noted if there’s a problem in the apartment, like a burst pipe that causes a flood, you may have limited recourse in regard to recouping any costs relating to damages.<br /><br />

				Thanks 28Grand!&nbsp; I viewed the apt yesterday and fell in love w/ it!&nbsp; The place did have 2 small windows, but big enough for me to climb out..just in case of a fire (kept that in mind when i visited..thanks!)&nbsp; I actually met the neighbors in the apt building and no complaints to any of them about the building and the landlord.&nbsp; The place was newly renovated 2 years ago..new kitchen counter and appliances and new bathroom which is a plus (cant stand dirty old bathrooms!)&nbsp; The only thing left to do is finish some paperworks and references with the landlord.&nbsp; Thanks a bunch everyone!

				Good luck on your new place!&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;m chiming in a little too late, but I think that is an AMAZING price for that apartment when you consider the parking spot.&nbsp; The going rate to rent a parking spot around here appears to be $150 month.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure which utilties are are talking about, but if it&#039;s electricity/heat/gas, that would be another 100-200 per month.&nbsp; If cable/internet is included, that&#039;s another $100+.<br /><br />As for the possible illegality--I used to live in an illegal basement apartment for a year (studio for 1000mo), and never had any problems except my lack of an address (difficult for places to deliver to my separate entrance, and I had to get my mail from the family upstairs).&nbsp; If your future neighbors seem happy and do not have complaints, your landlord probably adequately cares for the apartment and will fix things when you need it.&nbsp; And with the landlord, you really hold all the cards since you know it&#039;s illegal.&nbsp; I believe you can be immediately evicted if the apartment is found out, but if your landlord is a decent person that treats his tenants well, it doesn&#039;t seem they would be reported.

				Thanks newastorian35!&nbsp; The place does include all utilities but not cable/interent.&nbsp; I also have to share a mailbox with my neighbor above me since my entrace is on the back-side of the house...but overall i am very excited and ready to move in by next week!&nbsp; :-)
