				Well I&#039;m sure this will rub many folks differently however I for one could not be more pleased... I stopped by Club Fitness on Broadway last night to check the gym out (super nice but super pricey by the way..($80/month) and asked the manager what was being constructed on the other half of what used to be Crystal Palace....he said he heard rumors of a Starbucks so I e-mailed them and surprisingly they responded already to confirm that yes they are in fact opening the store on 31st and Broadway. <br /><br />So far all you Bucks fans near the area.....congrats!!

				You can get a better coffee at 7-11 and for much cheaper. This amazes me. Anyway, I just brew my own at home and use the insulated mug. Can&#039;t beat that!

				Assuming it&#8217;s a decent size (not like the one on Ditmars) I look forward to it.&#160; <br />I&#8217;m not a big fan of Starbuck&#8217;s coffee, but I do like having a place just to sit with friends for a bit and chat.&#160; Yea, 7-11 and Dunken are just as good but its not exactly a place to hang-out at.&#160; <br /><br />I remember when the first Starbucks opened on Steinway Street; I thought it would be empty because all the &#8220;Astorians&#8221; go to Omonia Caf&#233;, Galaxy Caf&#233;, and others.&#160; I was wrong!&#160; I also found myself frequenting Starbucks more and more; I&#8217;m sorry but I like the self-service style especially as I find the employees of Omonia and many of the other locals to have such nasty attitudes (note: I haven&#8217;t been there for about five years, maybe they&#8217;ve improved).&#160; I mean do we really even need to have a host to guide us to our seats and a waiter just to bring us a slice of cake and a cup of coffee?&#160;&nbsp; <br />

				I hate Starbucks&#039; coffee as much as the next person, but people, the coffee does not cost $4. Their coffee isn&#039;t much more expensive than most coffee shops. It&#039;s the specialty drinks that end up in the $3-5 dollar range, depending on the size of the drink and whatever extra crap you put in it, and similar drinks cost similar prices just about anywhere else you go.

I like going there sometimes (usually in the winter) for one of their flavored latte things because they taste good. I don&#039;t go there for fine coffee; that I can make myself. But in the flavored lattes I usually order them with two shots of espresso, in the tall size, because otherwise I don&#039;t taste coffee at all.<br /><br />It&#039;s kind of funny though, I think - Starbucks, in my opinion, has made the whole idea of the gourmet coffee house more accessible to the average American. Is it just me, or are there <em>more</em> local coffeehouses now than there were before Starbucks was everywhere? I feel like, before, coffeehouses might&#039;ve been seen more as an alternative hangout for teens and college students and where open mics were held, and they weren&#039;t a huge draw for the average person. Again, I could be totally wrong about this since I was never a big coffee shop person until fairly recently, but that&#039;s how it seems to me. I come from suburban Connecticut and that&#039;s how our local coffeehouse was perceived when I was in high school. Now everybody loves Starbucks, and a Starbucks-ish coffee shop opened up in the middle of town and is doing great.

Across the country, the number of privately owned coffee shops has declined. Starbucks has an aggressive policy of expansion, with direct intentions to drive out local shops. This is why you can see multiple stores so close together. There are specific instances of this in Boston and Pittsburgh that I can think of off the top of my head.

				Hey Jay, in case you didn&#039;t realize it, myself and Magicpie were being SARCASTIC, you know, one of the basic tenets of HUMOR? Jeez! And I&#039;m not closed minded, far from it actually. I just find it difficult to believe that someone wouldn&#039;t like Illy and would say that Starfucks is better, when it isn&#039;t. When Italians visiting NYC see a cafe with Illy being served, they swoon to it, honestly. Again, maybe it is being over-brewed, it happens. <br /><br /><br />And, seriously jay, you need to chill out.

Now that they like the idea of gourmet coffee, people want to see what else is out there. There was an article in Slate last year that talked about this: http://www.slate.com/id/2180301/fr/rss/<br /><br />As for Illy espresso, my workplace also used that in the espresso machine and it tasted awful. However, I bought a can of it at Parrot Coffee and ground it for a regular coffee maker, and it&#039;s the best coffee I ever made at home. So I dunno. Sorry if it&#039;s a crime that I used it to make regular coffee, but it was really good. I need a home espresso maker.

				Hi all,<br /><br />I think this is a good opportunity to remind everyone that your posts can set or change the tone of a thread.&nbsp; Pointing out a spelling error, although intended to be a funny and sarcastic comment can be misinterpreted and can provoke a member to defend themselves.&nbsp; The best thing to do when posting is to not attack each other and be mindful of the fact that not everyone will agree with what you are saying.&nbsp; Find a way to respectfully disagree with one another and stay on topic so the conversation does not deteriorate to the point of name calling and members ganging up on each other.&nbsp; <br /><br />Let&#039;s get back to talking about coffee and another Starbucks opening up.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks everybody.<br /><br />AJTNYC<br />Moderator <br /><br />

				Per essen’s post: It always appeared to me that Starbucks created a market for coffee and coffee shops rather than targeting an existing market and putting established shops out of business. <br /><br />Was there really a coffee house culture in New York and across the country that I was unaware of? I don’t have any statistical evidence but it appears to me in Astoria aside from the mostly Greek cafes, most of which are still in business, I don’t recall any coffee shop that shut down specifically due to the arrival of a Starbucks, And as far as corporate chains go, I’m assuming Starbuck doesn’t receive tax breaks (if someone knows otherwise please post) to open up shop, unlike some of the big box retailers. That’s a plus in my book though I still don’t care for their coffee.<br /><br />For what it’s worth my number one stop for coffee beans is Zabar’s, their espresso beans are tops; second go-to is Porto Rico.<br />

				So, I&#039;m a little confused.&nbsp; Has this &quot;Starbucks Next to Club Fitness&quot; been confirmed yet or is it a rumor?&nbsp; I see that they are doing work on that space, but looking in the windows I can&#039;t quite picture how they are going to turn it into a Starbucks.&nbsp; But, then again, they&#039;ve just started work and I bet there&#039;s a lot of demolition still to be done. <br /><br />If is it a Starbucks?&nbsp; I&#039;m of two minds:&nbsp; Yay, a convenient place for me to get a quick on-the-way-to-work breakfast item!&nbsp; And Boo...too tempting and best avoid or my work next door will be all for naught.&nbsp; And RE their coffee.&nbsp; Yeah, it&#039;s way too strong and gross for me, but I can&#039;t take much caffeine anyway, and I just tend to stick to an occasional frou-frou drink or tea.&nbsp; But if it were a perfect world, the Broadway area would have a nifty independent coffeehouse (a la Has Beans on 5th Ave. 18th Street in South Slope).

				Starbucks definitely helped very much to create a coffeehouse culture -- I don&#039;t know that they&#039;re really taken out smaller coffeeshops, as many of those simply did not exist before the Starbucks influx (the Greek coffeeshops are not really the same market). I&#039;ve read that Starbucks is having lots of $$ problems since that culture that they created is essentially taking away their business now - ie, more independent coffeeshops sprouting up, Dunkin Donuts (and soon to come, McDonalds) serving lattes and cappuccinos, etc.<br /><br />Never thought I&#039;d say this, but I&#039;m happy about another Starbucks. Since Dunkin Donuts is my main coffee option on Broadway/30&#039;s, I&#039;m not taking away any business from a local entity. Plus, their coffee sucks but I do love their frappaccinos!

				I&#039;m vehemently opposed to Starbucks, not because of the flavor of the coffee, the fact that Starbucks kills off local coffee shops, or even the fact that they employ the last living unicorns to harvest their beans*.&nbsp; No, it&#039;s the $2-$7 hit my wallet takes for every cup that I might otherwise be interested in. <br />I recently got my grimy mitts on a french press, and that thing rules, I now understand the hype.&nbsp; While I limit my good coffee drinking to the weekends when I can sit and enjoy it, it even manages to make my typical cup full o&#039; nuts taste pretty okay.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 5pt;" class="bbc_size">*unicorn employment may or may not be true</span>

				This article (http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/20061026/starbucks.htm) talks a bit about Starbucks&#039; aggressive growth plans. In 2006, they opened an average of six stores every day. They intentionally purchase stores across the street from one another to drive out local businesses. <br /><br />Starbucks also had problems with the IWW because they fired five employees for unionizing in November 2006. There are pretty many articles out there about it. There were worldwide protests after it happened. I think, for the most part, their employee policies are pretty good for a big company. However, this particular incident was handled about as poorly as one could imagine.

				as much of a starbucks fan that i am, i do agree that having stores across the street from each other is a bit much (or even within one or two blocks of each other).&nbsp; they should definitely close the duplicate stores and move them to areas where there aren&#039;t any (such as the bway/grand avenue area which will soon be getting one).<br /><br />and i was thinking about this....starbucks could never change the <strong>traditional</strong> cafe culture, especially in places like astoria or little italy.&nbsp; it&#039;s a different experience altogether, and i think there is room for both.&nbsp; <br /><br />i am curious to see how places like mcdonald&#039;s cafes are going to compare with starbucks.&nbsp; i think it&#039;s going to be a bit odd to see a real espresso machine in that atmosphere, and although i&#039;ve heard that people like their new (regular and iced) coffee, i think mcdonalds getting into the espresso business is a bit much.

They changed the interior to give it a more sleeked up, cafe/loungey feel - don&#039;t know how that will work, but interesting....

				McDonald&#039;s will not be able to compete.&nbsp; What Starbucks and local coffee shops offer is an experiential coffee experience. When people think McDonald&#039;s they think of french fries and big macs....not a great cup of coffee in a relaxed atmosphere. What may make sense is for McD&#039;s to enter markets and locales where Starbucks will never venture into and try to dominate that market....that is the only way I see the McDonald&#039;s strategy working if at all. <br /><br />

A tall (small) 12 oz. with tax is $1.90. When you get a small coffee from the man at the cart, or 711, or wherever, it&#039;s also smaller than the Starbucks small. A latte or mocha at DD is not really significantly less than Starbucks either. At Starbucks you are also paying for the service and atmosphere too. I&#039;ve watched a person make a mocha at DD and it is def not the same process... and did not taste good at all but that&#039;s my opinion.&nbsp; To each their own but I think a lot of people just WANT to hate Starbucks. I would even bet a number of haters haven&#039;t even tried their coffee...

				Just a tip - if you go to Starbucks&#039; website and sign up for the Passion Panel - don&#039;t laugh, that&#039;s what <br />it&#039;s called - you can get occasional freebies from them. They e-mail you once in awhile with short <br />surveys to answer, which aren&#039;t a big deal. I&#039;ve done them a few times and every so often get a card<br />in the mail for free stuff. <br /><br />The first one was a free beverage - any type, any size I wanted, which even included those $5 + drinks.<br />I opted for a grande regular coffee, but the barista kept encouraging me to go for more. I&#039;ve also received<br />freebies on their oatmeal, smoothies, and some other stuff.

				Yeah, I&#039;m also an occasional Starbucks customer (because I also like to support mom &amp; pop places as well) for the reason discussed above.&nbsp; I had friends in high school who were employees who loved their jobs because they were taken care of well, and they stuck with the corporation through college and have now have Starbucks corporate level.&nbsp; &nbsp;I respect any mega corporation who puts their employees near top of their priority list.&nbsp; So, Starbucks and companies like Costco are aces in my book. <br /><br /><br />RE the rumor of Starbucks in the empty half of Club Fitness:&nbsp; Apparently, they were only in talks.&nbsp; The owners of that space are speaking to a lot of business lessees about that space.&nbsp; If not a Starbucks, I hope for some kind of sandwich shop that sells good quality sandwiches, soups, salads and smoothies.&nbsp;

I could see maybe when they first started opening up that carrying around a frappucino or something was some sort of status symbol, but I would think at this point the place is so ubiquitous that these people just like Starbucks and enjoy the atmosphere and/or their wifi policy. The one person I know who hates Starbucks with a fiery passion has never even set foot inside one.

				Not even Starbucks can afford to pay the insane amount of rent they are asking for the space on 31 st and Broadway. Brokers say they are firm at $70.00 per square foot. Let it stay vacant until the owners realize were in a boarderline depression. After a year or two the rents will recede and the stores and services we desire will open. Greed killed the banking sector and Wall Street. Commercial real estate is next!
