				Are the Daily News and The Post still in business? I read all the important news online from <span class="bbc_u">The Onion</span> (http://www.theonion.com/content/index) and <span class="bbc_u">Fark</span> (http://www.fark.com/).

				<br /><br />It is a little embarrassing sometimes to have the NYT. But less so on Fridays.<br />And the Sun&#039;s sports section is what?<br /><br /><br />With the News and Post, it is only with some rare headlines that it could seem embarrassing. <br />But dont be embarrassed to be a NYer.<br />It is frustrating when the Yankees have played on the west coast, and the paper might have less info.<br /><br /><br />It is good to laugh. So the papers can help with that. <br />The Metro can also be fun on occassion. [But the distribution practices and the ad flyers that end up as hazards all over the place piss me off] <br /><br /><br />If you like Ads, can always try online<br />http://blogs.nypost.com/sports/st/<br /><br /><br />http://bronxbanter.baseballtoaster.com/archives/371994.html

				It&#039;s now all a convoluted bucket of fish. Handing money over to Rupert Murdoch is a bad thing, IMHO.&nbsp; So grab that free promo copy on the street as the newsprint stands a better chance of finding it&#039;s way into the recycling bin in your hands than in the hands of the distributor.&nbsp; Stash it into that manpurse of yours so nobody will see.<br /><br />It is all one big media circus, friends!&nbsp; Am I handing the forces of Evil more income by watching Family Guy or King of Queens reruns on Ch&#039;s 5 &amp; 9?&nbsp; &nbsp;I guess I am, as I too am no&nbsp; :angel:.<br /><br />My favorite used to be NY Newsday in the days of Murray Kempton and Jimmy Breslin.&nbsp; Now I get the semi-literate JS grads of the 90&#039;s who were educated under Ronald Reagan, and it shows.<br /><br />- Cannibal

				Reading the NY Post is somewhat embarassing, it&#039;s only good for the sports pages, the rest is pure trash. The NY Daily News has dropped somewhat in quality in the last 5 or so years, although it&#039;s still much better than the Post. The NY Times is still the best newspaper you can buy.

				I read most of my news online, and the Metro in the morning cuz it&#039;s there and it&#039;s free.&nbsp; I would never read the Times on the subway, as it&#039;s too big and too long to read in one 20 minute subway ride.&nbsp; The NYP and DN are both papers of the tabloid sensationalist variety, but if you realize that and want that, then it&#039;s all good.&nbsp; If the sports section is good on those papers and you like sports, then it&#039;s all good too.&nbsp; &nbsp;I wouldn&#039;t rely on it as my source of news, but the internet is my source of news.&nbsp; &nbsp;For real news, you can do better, but that may not be your objective when reading those papers.&nbsp; I can see reading it purely for entertainment value.&nbsp; It&#039;s not my thing, but it doesn&#039;t have to be.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m also crazy about Fark. (http://www.fark.com) I love their pretty unedited discussion, the quality of the debate and the articles on the politics tab. The sports section is also great, though it&#039;s not NY team specific, if that&#039;s what you want. I&#039;m an admitted BoSox and Boston fan, however, so I&#039;m biased toward places with other coverage.

				I must admit, I &#039;sneak&#039; a look at The Post every now and then, to see what they are writing about.&nbsp; I get a kick out of their stories.&nbsp; For the most part, we get The Times for free, I love the BBC and a bit of Huffington Post once in a while.&nbsp; I love magazines and read as many as possible - Time, Newsweek, Vanity Fair, The Economist, The Atlantic etc.

				I think I&#039;ve said this before, but the Times offers prose that is more technically stylish.&nbsp; This does not equate to a better paper in my mind.&nbsp; Sure, the Times covers foreign affairs better, but I find that the Post and NYDN offer the best local coverage.&nbsp; The papers all have their distinct purposes.&nbsp; I find that if I want a quick, entertaining read the Post is best in breed most days.&nbsp; And the headlines?&nbsp; Inspired!

				one thing i like in the post is the weird but true section; in todays <br /><br />doctors in the German town of hochfranken made a mistake best described as asinine <br />a woman came in for a operation on her leg and wound up with a brand new anus after surgeons apparently mixed up notes for two patients. they&#039;ve been suspended and face a big lawsuit<br /><br />makes me wonder why the surgeons didn&#039;t notice she had a perfectly good anus :lol:<br /><br />only in the post 8-)

				Nah, it&#039;s cheap reading for lunch. Used to read the Post when it was 25 cents, now I prefer the DN.<br /><br />I subscribe to the NY Times, but only when I can get the discount. Also read it online- not so fond of the internet versions of Post and DN due to the trashy nature of them. Not that anybody has ever had the nerve to make a comment!<br /><br />It&#039;s funny comparing the articles from each about the same story. The NYT articles are factual and dry; the DN and Post editorialize like crazy: <br /><br /><em>NY TIMES (City Room): Artist Arrested for 42nd Time, This Time on the High Line<br />By JENNIFER 8. LEE<br />&nbsp;<br />A self-promotional vendor who has successfully used the First Amendment to challenge New York City restrictions on artists’ rights to sell was arrested on Saturday by parks police for hawking his wares on the High Line.<br /><br />The vendor, Robert A. Lederman, president of Artists’ Response to Illegal State Tactics, was handcuffed at about 3:30 p.m. around the West 14th Street section of the High Line. He was issued five summonses, two of which were criminal. The criminal ones included disorderly conduct and failure to comply with directions of officers. The non-criminal summonses included vending without a park permit, failure to have his display comply with required permit and unauthorized vending.<br /><br /><br />NY POST: For Art Peddler, It&#039;s High &amp; Dry Line<br />By JESSICA SIMEONE<br />&nbsp;<br />He picked the wrong park to play in. <br /><br />An artist who waged and won a years-long battle with then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani for the right to sell his work in city parks was busted for peddling his wares over the weekend in Chelsea&#039;s trendy High Line Park. <br /><br />Robert Lederman, who once depicted Giuliani as Hitler, had been busted 41 times before a federal court sided with him in 2001, allowing artists to sell their works in public parks and on city sidewalks without a permit. </em>

				I actually stopped reading the NY Times several months ago when they raised the price from $1.50 to $2.00. I took it in stride when the price went to $1.10, then $1.25, and then $1.50. But I&#039;ll be damned if I&#039;m going to spend 2 bucks each day for a daily paper.
