				Hi everyone,<br /><br /><br />One of my colleagues here at work is leaving us tomorrow. He always used to bring bagels whenever there was any occasion or celebration<br />so I wanted to do the same for him.<br /><br /><br />I live in the 30th Avenue area - any suggestions for good bagels where I can pick up one or two dozen to bring in to work tomorrow?<br />I don&#039;t eat bagels so that&#039;s why I&#039;m asking the experts here.<br /><br /><br />Thank you.

				Thanks Braun. I was thinking of them too, but just wanted to see what other folks came up with. <br />Much appreciated.<br /><br />

				It sounds like the bagels may mean something in this situation - but if not, consider getting something special and unique to Astoria.&nbsp; Yaya&#039;s Bakery is between 30th and Newtown.&nbsp; They have delicious items you can&#039;t find anywhere else.&nbsp; My wife often brings dozens of their amazing, buttery breadsticks to her office and her colleagues go crazy for them.&nbsp; They come in all sorts of flavors.&nbsp; More like a cookie than a breadstick and great for a breakfast treat.&nbsp; Just a thought.&nbsp; I always look for an opportunity to showcase what my neighborhood has that other areas do not.

				Actually, I placed an order w/Brooklyn Bagels last night to pick up this morning. My coworkers are enjoying them now - the bagels are huge and delicious. They had everything ready for me to go when I arrived there this morning. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;d definitely recommend them again for quality and service. <br /><br /><br />I know Yaya&#039;s bakery - it&#039;s wonderful. But for this occasion, the bagels are symbolic. Two of my colleagues are leaving us today - they were let go a few days ago. <br /><br /><br />One of them always brought bagels for every holiday and celebration. So I wanted to do the same for him as a sendoff. <br /><br /><br />Thanks very much!<br /><br />
