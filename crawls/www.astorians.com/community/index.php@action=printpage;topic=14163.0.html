				Glad to see this addition to the community events section!&nbsp; I think it is important to distinguish between real community events, which are non-profit or no fee and commercial ones.&nbsp; And I don&#039;t envy you the task of parsing the posts, but I think a distinction should be made between donation events and fee events.&nbsp; It seems to me that the Autism post belongs back where it was not with, for example, real commercial events like those by Hell Gate Social, Bugalo, etc.&nbsp;

				Thanks for you post pineapple.&nbsp; I moved the post&nbsp; :|&nbsp; Although the entrance fee is a donation it is required for entry to the event which is why i thought it was appropriate to move.&nbsp; Also, they are requesting a minimum of $10 to be spent on food and drinks.&nbsp; In any event, I will consult with the other mods.<br /><br />A worthy event, no matter which category it is in.

				I see where you&#039;re coming from.&nbsp; Both the Autism event and the Kehillat Tikva Purim Party have &quot;entrance fees&quot; but the Hell Gate Social one doesn&#039;t.&nbsp; But I do think a distinction between a donation or a fee paid towards a non-profit and a no-cover but commercial enterprise ought to be made.&nbsp; To me the logic is to switch where they are currently posted, but that&#039;s just me.

				&nbsp;:|<br />Not too unusual, but I feel retarded and confused. Was there a desire or need for this distinction?<br />?<br />I just dont get it.<br /><br /><br />Maybe I should give it time to see how having the 2 boards is a benefit. And I am sure the board guiders gave this thought. <br /><br />

				Yes we found a need for it.&nbsp; We are trying this out for now and may add other categories.
