				<br />CBS doubles bandwidth for NCAA streams <br />By SETH SUTEL, AP Business Writer<br />Thu Mar 8, <br /><br /><br />While CBS Corp. is doubling the amount of bandwidth available for viewing NCAA tournament games this year, it will still restrict the number of viewers to keep the system running smoothly.<br /><br />The video streams proved very popular last year. CBS is also beefing up the image quality for the video and making the online video player larger, which will take up some of the added bandwidth.<br /><br />Joe Ferreira, the vice president of programming at CBS SportsLine, says the site is aiming to accommodate up to 300,000 viewers at any given time, up from around 175,000 simultaneous viewers last year.<br /><br />Once that limit is reached, fans will be diverted to online &quot;waiting rooms&quot; until enough other users leave to allow new ones in.<br /><br />CBS has been offering online viewing of the NCAA basketball games since 2003, but this is only the second year that they will be offered for free and supported with advertising. In previous years, fans had to pay for a subscription to view the games.<br /><br />...<br /><br />As for whether CBS will be encouraging slacking off at work, &quot;employees and employers across the country are going to make individual decisions about what they do,&quot; Ferreira says. &quot;We think it&#039;s a great perk.&quot;<br /><br />In case some employers disagree, CBS does explain in a Q&amp;A page on its Web site how companies can block online access to the video player. <br /><br />___ <br /><br />On the Net: <br /><br />http://www.ncaasports.com/mmod/faq<br />

				TRX,<br /><br />Reading your post about UCLA basketball sort of makes me wish I went to a big athletic school.&nbsp; Hell, I would have even settled for any intercollegiate athletics!&nbsp; There was a rumor that we had a soccer team, but no one ever knew where they played on the campus.&nbsp; Our college basketball team would sometimes play games against other small colleges, but that was even questionable.&nbsp; The only thing that kept our gymnasium open was the Knicks, who practiced in our facilities.&nbsp; If you were lucky, you could actually watch Ewing &amp; Co. practice from a window high above the court!&nbsp; When they got really popular, however, it was impossible to see them at all.<br /><br />Anyway, I wish your Bruins well.&nbsp; I&#039;m sort of cheering for Georgetown, though, because of my fond memories of the Hoyas in the 80&#039;s.<br /><br />I do, however, follow the UCLA football team.&nbsp; The game against USC this past year was one of the best upsets I have ever watched!&nbsp; No one had the Bruins winning that one and even the sportscasters, who are so blatantly USC fans, had to give UCLA their props!&nbsp; Back in the 80&#039;s, I rocked a UCLA Bruins jersey EVERYWHERE after I found out that their kicker, John Lee, was Korean!&nbsp; Plus, I really wanted to move to L.A.

But when it comes to success in the classroom, the student-athletes in the women’s field remain far ahead of their male counterparts. <br /><br />Fifty-two of 64 teams in the women’s tourney have graduated at least 70 percent of their players, compared with only 24 of 65 men’s teams, according to the study by Richard Lapchick, director of the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport at UCF. The data reflects six-year graduation rates for freshmen classes that enrolled between 1996 and 1999. <br /><br />“The academic success of the women in the tournament is a great story,” Lapchick said. “They are the epitome of what it means to be a <strong>student-athlete</strong>.” <br /><br />...<br /><br />

				I was really, really hoping for a UCLA vs. Georgetown national championship with Georgetown winning.&nbsp; Sorry TRX.&nbsp; Now, I think I&#039;m rooting for Florida, largely because the group that won last year committed to coming back this year and I kind of like Joachim Noah (his father is Yannick Noah, the French tennis player).&nbsp; I might not even stay up for this one, though, as I have to be at work really early the next day and I&#039;m not as interested.<br /><br />
