			Stolen from my craigslist post:<br /><br />I am a recent college grad who will be moving to NY to start a job as an accountant with a large Manhattan based CPA firm. I am extremely responsible, hard-working, and respectful person. I always pay all of my bills on time. I am very clean and quiet, do not party, smoke, or do any drugs. I do not have any pets except for a couple of fish tanks that I would like to bring with me.<br /><br />I am looking for a studio or 1 bd apartment in Astoria for around $1000/mo, but up to $1100/mo. I would like to be north of Broadway and no more than a 10 minute walk to the subway stations on 31st St.<br /><br />No Basement or Garden Apartments.<br />No Brokers and No Roomates Please! <br /><br />I am looking for an October or November move in date.&nbsp; I will be in nyc from the 23rd-29th, and would like to set up to see something then.&nbsp; I have friends in the area that could check out something for me sooner though.<br /><br />email me if you have or know of something: acctnyc at yahoo dot com<br /><br />Thanks!

			Welcome to the neighborhood.<br /><br />I presume you&#39;ve already checked out craigslist for the type of apartment you&#39;re looking for. The truth is, most of the listings, if not all, involve some sort of broker fee. That&#39;s the reality of this market. Also, you may be hard pressed to find a 1 BR in that price range, especially close to the subway. The rents are going up all over.<br /><br />If you still want to forego a broker, you could scour the bulletin boards (real, not internet ones) for postings. You&#39;ll usually find them in supermarkets and laundrymats. Most of the ones I&#39;ve seen are for rooms for rent in a house; basically a boarding-room type situation.<br /><br />Good luck.

I remember a garden apartment being a unit in a complex of low-rise apartment buildings (usually 2â€“3 walk-up floors) that is part of a lush landscaped environment.
