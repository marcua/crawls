				I grew up in Astoria....born in 1962. I saw some wild characters in my day. Here are a few....<br />&quot;Cry aloud!!!!&quot;...This guy was on the RR train in the 70s....He died in the early 80s. His most famous line.....&quot;Believe in the lord Jesus........And you shall be saved!!&quot;<br />Another Preacher/bum was &quot;God is coming..God...&quot;<br />A deranged black girl that would come into the car and start yelling and cursing at everybody. One day I told her to shut up and she proceeded to run after me!!<br />Finally....Harold...I&#039;ve known Harold since I was in 1st grade at PS 122. back then he used to hit a Spalding ball back and forth in the schoolyard by himself. Today...Hes riding the N train and singing 50s tunes.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Don&#039;t think of the homeless as a cast of charming characters myself. There&#039;s a guy in Astoria Park who&#039;s always hanging out on the same bench when I go for a run, but that&#039;s the only &quot;regular&quot; I can think of.

				We have a bunch of regulars hanging out on Ditmars all the time.&nbsp; I actually have a hard time believing any of them are really homeless or really helpless.&nbsp; Most seem more like shysters, scam artists.&nbsp; One even owns a cell phone and has no problem finding decent clothes to wear.&nbsp; There are at least 6-10 of them at Ditmars alone.&nbsp; And we have no shelter so that&#039;s not the explanation of why there are so many of them hanging out there.&nbsp; The only ones I see as pretty harmless is the one in the park who never talks to or bothers anybody and the blind one with the radio outside Key Food.&nbsp; The others just seem to be scammers, and get drunk, are loud all day and night, start fights with each other, etc.

				Hi Everybody<br /><br />First, Harold isn&#039;t homeless. He has his own place for years. Though poor taste in clothes.<br />Daisy is right. The characters in the Ditmars area are scammers and causing a lot of trouble with their drinking and fighting.<br />All receive their monthly disability checks and live within a few blocks of one another.<br />Many people believe that they&#039;re homeless,this is false.

				I&#039;ve lived&nbsp; in astoria, give a or take a few years away, for over 40 years, grew up here. The so-called&nbsp; homeless today are mostly scam artists and&nbsp; drug/drunk addicts. The worst is these&nbsp; guys who roam the neighborhoods with carts and get inside buildings and private home yards, urinate, defecate and in one case I know this &#039;couple&#039; was&nbsp; having sex behind a&nbsp; dumpster :-o&nbsp; &nbsp;The congestion is getting so bad that it has weighted down hospitals, housing&nbsp; and&nbsp; other essential services. No solution except to try and weed out who really needs&nbsp; help from those who should be incacerated.

				I&#039;ve been in astoria half my life and I think the homeless situation has vastly improved. 8 years ago. It improved when OTB got moved and redone. I should hope the whole OTB thing gets shut down forever though.

				The old man on the N train with the portable keyboard asking for donations is still around. Saw him the other day.<br />Seems to be wearing the same clothes for years. Perhaps receiving a SS check and this is his way of making extra cash.<br />By the way, he lives here in Astoria.<br />The old lady, a class act deserving an Oscar award.<br />Sometimes outside of CVS or the bank on Ditmars and makes a lot of money.<br />But what most people don&#039;t know is, her husband is nearby. Sitting&nbsp; on a bench or in a parked Lincoln.<br />There were times I saw them get into a private taxi. Usually on a side street where they won&#039;t be noticed.<br />I heard from several different sources, that they own two houses by Astoria park.<br />Try next time to offer her something to eat and watch her reaction.

				They guy who coaches basketball and begs on the N train is also a regular.&nbsp; My feeling is that you give to reputable charities.&nbsp; Go ahead and give to soup kitchens and shelters if you like.&nbsp; But NEVER EVER give to anyone on the street or in the subway.

				Hey everyone. I just moved here a few weeks ago, and wanted to share a funny experience I had one of my first days here.<br /><br />I was waiting for the N train at Ditmars and 31st, and this guy who I presume was homeless (he was tall, no shirt, huge nasty beard, huge nasty beer belly and super white skin, and pushed a small cart) was asking people &quot;Do you have any chaaaange??&quot;. Well after he asked me for change, he went over to this older black guy coming up the stairs and asked him. The guy replied &quot;Dude man...I&#039;m homeless!&quot; and gave him a &quot;wtf&quot; kinda look. It was a good laugh.<br /><br />Anyone know about the guy I&#039;m talking about?

That&#039;s the problem with Astoria today, it&#039;s filled with transplants that think NY is &quot;SCARY&quot; and think they have the right to be better or special. Wake up, people fail at life and need some help. Every NYer doesn&#039;t fall for this crap-some of us care about other people, transplant.

				I have to agree. It&#039;s human nature to want to help people, and every time I jog past the quiet guy on the bench in Astoria Park, I&#039;m tempted to run home and bring him a sandwich. But I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not the only one who wants to do that, and I&#039;m sure plenty of other people take care of him in some way. Many homeless prefer this kind of life, despite the drawbacks, than having to shoulder the responsibility of getting their own subsidized apartment.<br /><br />Food is still a better option than giving money, though. There are so many beggars (not necessarily homeless) looking for money, and who knows what it&#039;s really being spent on, or if it&#039;s even really needed. Offer food, and that often gets a reaction that&#039;s telling.

				Most of New York State&#039;s mental hospitals have been turned into prisons, thus creating the problem of mentally ill people slipping through the cracks and ending up on our streets. Try to keep that in mind when you see the loneliness and sorrow on these people&#039;s faces.

				I totally agree about the shelters not being much help, but I&#039;m referring to those who have opportunities to move into their own apartments, and don&#039;t hold up their end of the bargain, however little it may be.<br /><br />Also, it&#039;s tough to tell who&#039;s scamming and who&#039;s truly desperate sometimes. I once asked my cousin, who works for the DOH, why they have volunteers go out after midnight in the dead of winter to do the homeless census. He explained that only the truly desperate would be outside under those conditions.

I just moved here a few weeks ago, and wanted to share a funny experience I had one of my first days here.<br /><br />I was waiting for the N train at Ditmars and 31st, and this guy who I presume was homeless (he was tall, no shirt, huge nasty beard, huge nasty beer belly and super white skin, and pushed a small cart) was asking people &quot;Do you have any chaaaange??&quot;. Well after he asked me for change, he went over to this older black guy coming up the stairs and asked him. The guy replied &quot;Dude man...I&#039;m homeless!&quot; and gave him a &quot;wtf&quot; kinda look. It was a good laugh.<br /><br />Anyone know about the guy I&#039;m talking about?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, I do know the guy.&nbsp; I usually see him at the Broadway stop.&nbsp; He&#039;s been around for a little over a year, as far as I know.&nbsp; I remember when his beard was much, much smaller.&nbsp; Now with the insane heat, he walks around shirtless, asking people for change.&nbsp; Sometimes I see his heap of bags on the platform but he&#039;s not around.<br /><br />But there are a group of homeless on 30th Avenue I&#039;ve been noticing a lot.&nbsp; One of them is usually passed out in front of the Rite Aid near the stop.&nbsp; Hell, one of them was so passed out one time that he went to the bathroom on himself and some passerby thought he was dead and called the cops.&nbsp; Today, again, one of their group was passed out in the front of the Rite Aid with no shirt, another asking for change on the intersection of 30th Avenue and 31st Street.&nbsp; One came into my barbers&#039; joint (he was really drunk) and began washing his upper arms in the hairwashing sink (gross), but my barber knew him and allowed it.&nbsp; He even offered to give him a spare pair of sneakers.

				I saw the shirtless, tattooed chubster lying outside of Rite Aid today around 6 or so.&nbsp; Seemed like a junkie to me.&nbsp; I could be wrong though.
