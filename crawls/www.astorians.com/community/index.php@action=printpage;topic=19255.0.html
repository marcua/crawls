				We found a loving and definitely housebroken kitty tonight on 41st St between 28th and 25th Aves. He has his rear claws removed but is definitely someone&#039;s pet and has been lost for a few days, he helped himself happily to a lot of our dog&#039;s food and water. The little man has been given a bath and we&#039;re taking care of him. If he is your cat or you know his humans please contact us at 201-788-5744. <br /><br />(http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4088/4955840203_c88d4fe918.jpg)<br />(http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4128/4956432740_c668f1f4d1.jpg)

				Darn.. I saw a xeroxed flyer on my way to the subway Thursday about a lost cat. I don&#039;t remember now whether it was all black or black and white like that one.<br /><br />The flyer was taped to a tree on 41st St between 31st Av and Broadway. It said the cat was perdido since the 20-somethingth of July - I remember at first wondering if the cat&#039;s name was perdido.<br /><br />I walked down there today to look, but I couldn&#039;t find the poster. If it is the same cat, he probably speaks Spanish. You might check bulletin boards particularly in Spanish-speaking establishments in that area.&nbsp; Best of luck to you.

				The flyer is still up at the Steinway/Broadway entrance to the R/M train. I also noticed a few additional flyers on 41st and Broadway. The cat in the picture is black, but not sure if it is the same cat. I hope if it is the cat, it is reunited with its owners.<br />

				What to do if you find a lost pet<br /><br />&nbsp;Tips For PetRescuers <br /><br />So you&#039;re a PetRescuer, now what? Follow these tips to be safe and savvy as you look for lost HomeAgain pets:&nbsp; <br />• Read your Lost Pet Alerts and take note of the missing pet&#039;s description. <br />• Keep a lookout in your neighborhood, during your commute, and talk to friends &amp; neighbors. <br />• If you&#039;ve seen or found a pet from a Lost Pet Alert, report it to HomeAgain. <br />&nbsp;<br />What to do when you find a lost pet:&nbsp; <br />• Assess the situation carefully. If you feel safe, slowly approach the lost cat or dog. <br />• If the lost pet is aggressive or otherwise unstable, call a local shelter or animal control for help. <br />• If you feel safe approaching the pet and it is wearing a collar with ID tags, check for information about the owner and let them know you found their lost pet. <br />• If the pet is not wearing visible identification but you are able to safely approach the pet, take it to the nearest animal shelter or veterinary clinic to be scanned for a microchip. <br />• If you are unable to approach the pet or determine the pet&#039;s owner, contact your local animal control agency. Animal control can scan the pet for a microchip and get the pet off of the streets, so it doesn&#039;t get injured. <br />&nbsp;<br />Some PetRescuers may decide to shelter a friendly cat or dog until the owner can be contacted or while waiting for the owner to arrive. In those situations, it&#039;s important to keep the lost pet separate from your children and pets. Even the friendliest pets may act out in an unfamiliar environment! <br />
