				Hey Guys!!!<br />Trying to get some ideas of what our wonderful Astoria Community wants in Astoria.<br />Let me know your thoughts and where abouts....like a Watawa on 30th, or a bakery on Ditmars.<br /><br /><br />Thank you all!!!<br /><br />

				Are you going to open a place? If so, are you seriously suggesting that Ditmars might desire additional bakeries, or that 30th Avenue might want &quot;a Watawa&quot;? If you are looking for ideas, a good rule to follow is that if it&#039;s some sort of ethnic cuisine, it should be authentic and something the owner is really passionate about. Don&#039;t open a place just because it sells food that seems to be trendy and then fail in the execution because you really don&#039;t care about the food. In general I think the people who post on this board just want stuff where it seems like the people running our local businesses care about the quality of what they&#039;re selling, and that it&#039;s not an act just to attract the kind of customer who cares about that sort of thing. We can tell the difference.<br /><br />I would appreciate a kitchen store that sells good quality cookware for a reasonable price on Ditmars. You&#039;d never know by looking at the businesses in Astoria that anyone actually likes to cook at home. But a lot of people do, and if I want to buy good quality cookware for a reasonable price, I have to go into Manhattan.

				You might want to look into the area between Hoyt Avenue and Astoria Blvd from 31st to Crescent, this area badly needs a food store and a nice landromat. Not sure if restaurant will work there, but on the other hand Basel and BZ Grill seem to be doing okay. <br />

				A legitimate JAPANESE sushi establishment.&nbsp; I live near Watawa, Sakura, and Kumo, but I currently go to Linn&#039;s at Broadway for my sushi fix.&nbsp; I feel there is a huge variance in quality and taste there.&nbsp; A Linn on Ditmars would be nice.&nbsp; I have no issues with the current owners of sushi establishments in Astoria not being Japanese.&nbsp; In my experience the Japanese chefs had better training and know how to prepare sushi, so that is what I prefer.&nbsp; I would pay more for quality.

				Anything Vietnamese would be stellar. A kitchen store would be awesome. I feel like there are a lot of bases covered in our neighborhood, so most importantly, as others have said, whatever it winds up being, should be sincere in it&#039;s attempts to make the best whatever you&#039;re offering.

				Yeah, TJT, the sort of place I had in mind when I posted about a kitchen store is Broadway Panhandler. I like that they carry a range of things from very nice to budget, while none of it seems crappy, and it&#039;s the sort of place where you go in with one thing in mind but end up looking at everything else in wonder. They carry a thoughtful selection of products. Ditmars Panhandler!

				I don&#039;t think a high end kitchen supply store would do enough business to maintain rent in Astoria. Plus you have to compete with Amazon&#039;s low prices and BBB&#039;s endless coupons. I&#039;m not gonna complain going into Manhattan for kitchen supplies because I don&#039;t do it very often (and I work in a kitchen).<br /><br /><br />But opening a kitchen supply store is very different from opening a restaurant or cafe or bakery (which I think the OP wants to get into). I would like to see a casual seasonal restaurant. I like the green-sourced philosophy of Bareburger and Butcher Bar, but something with more variety (not just meat focused, but seafood and vegetables and innovated cocktails that aren&#039;t a variant on a girly martini). The problem is trying to find quality chefs and cooks who are knowledge beyond just heating up familiar foods.

				I wasn&#039;t actually talking about a &quot;high end&quot; kitchen supply store. Broadway Panhandler was the closest thing I could think of in the city for the range of things it sells without being a behemoth like BB&amp;B (which I hate going to despite the coupons) or as generally expensive as Williams-Sonoma, but maybe there are better examples. If done right, a store like that could do very well here.<br /><br />If we&#039;re talking about restaurants only, I will second the return of La Papa but would also appreciate Vietnamese. Something more original than simply [insert cuisine here] would also be cool.

				Both rents and food prices in Astoria are fueled by demand. Young professionals are moving in and they don&#039;t mind paying extra for organic food or proximity to the city. I think, potential and existing business owners need to focus more on presentation and quality, rather than prices in Astoria.

				A good discount clothing store like TJMaxx or Century 21.&nbsp; Please no more overpriced food places just get more parking spots for food trucks.&nbsp; Similar to what LIC has by Court Square.&nbsp; More parking lots/garages would be great.&nbsp; Too many double-parked cars.

				I think that living around 30-th. Ave. does not call for anything else as we have almost everything there ... but what I really fear is&nbsp; Astoria loosing the variety of food restaurants (greek, mediterranean, bosnian, etc) it was known for.&nbsp; There is a recent trend of opening bars and lounges and boston pizza places.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />What about a Cuban - Caribbean/Spanish restaurant ?

				Agree, there are very few quality chinese restaurants that are not just take-out/delivery spots. And they tend to cluster in meighbourhoods with large chinese population. It might be a cool idea to have a modern chinese place like they do with Thai and Indian places.
