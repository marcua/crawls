				I&#39;m fairly new to the site, but am curious if the lack of zip cars in Astoria has ever been discussed here. I would be one of their best customers if I didn&#39;t have to take the subway to the nearest pick-up location -- sort of defeats the purpose. Anyone else feel the same way? Maybe we can bombard them with requests for a few Astoria cars. <br /><br />

				There are a couple of threads here on Zipcars:<br /><br />Here&#39;s (http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=2375.0) the more recent one, which references the prior one.&nbsp; <br /><br />At the solstice opening at Socrates in June, Zip Car had a car and rep there, and I was under the impression that they now had cars in Astoria.&nbsp; But I didn&#39;t check it out, so I don&#39;t know for sure.

				If you go to their website, they have a car locator. The closest one is somewhere in LIC. I&#39;m not even sure how to get there.<br /><br />I want to buy a car, anyway. It&#39;s too hard having a dog without one. Those rentals add up and I don&#39;t even have anything to show for it.

				Thanks -- I do know how the site works (I&#39;m a member) but as far as I can tell, the nearest ones to my home are still a train ride away, and since I have a baby/stroller/diaper bag/etc this is a big pain. We are considering buying a used car, but I love the eco philosophy behind Zip cars and wish I could take advantage. Anyway, thanks for the info. I&#39;ll triple check the locations, maybe they will add more cars.

				I had checked Zip car out in the past and it didn&#39;t seem to make financial sense compared to just renting a car when you need it.&nbsp; Do you find that there is a savings in the long run?&nbsp; (aside from the closest cars being in LIC, which makes it sort of useless)
