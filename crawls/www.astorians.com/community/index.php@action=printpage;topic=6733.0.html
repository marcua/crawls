				This Thursday we will get a blast from the past with this character filled corner on Ditmars and 32 street. <br />Oleput, Tupelo spelled backward is the brainchild of Helen her brother Emmanuel, Evan and perhaps some other creative people.<br />It will be a Soda fountain and old fashioned candy store type place with a juice bar and cheeses.<br />I welcome them warmly to our Boulevard. Best of Luck. Geo :mrgreen:

				I peeked in the window tonight on my way home. It looked like they had coffee on the shelf- do you know if they will have coffee? I&#039;d love to have a non-Starbucks/Dunkin Donuts place that serves coffee on my way to the train (which, granted, is only about 3 blocks so I&#039;m not complaining). Either way, I have been very much looking forward to this.

				I stopped in on my way home and turned out to be their very first customer!&nbsp; It&#039;s really cute inside, and in additon to coffee, ice cream, NY State jams and jellies, pies and other baked goods, they&#039;ve got old-fashioned candy and a small selection of &quot;general store&quot;-type goods.<br /><br />I tasted the chocolate ice cream and it is very good.&nbsp; The pies are indeed Briermere&#039;s, and I am very excited.&nbsp; Briermere Farms is in Riverhead, on the North Road (Sound Avenue), heading out to Orient.&nbsp; Their pies are really excellent.<br /><br />I&#039;m very excited they are open!

				Jayme - <br /><br />Not sure about the exact hours but they were mopping the floors last night at 11:300 when I walked by (maybe they close at 11?)<br /><br />Also, they were open at 8:10 this morning when I walked by so I stopped in for a coffee.&nbsp; They had a nice selection of breakfast pastries in a case and the coffee was really good.&nbsp; I especially liked that the milk options in the canisters were skim or soy (although they were pouring fatty milk into someone&#039;s coffee behind the counter at their request).&nbsp; The space is pretty fantastic&nbsp; (much more impressive than just staring in thru the window).&nbsp; I wanted to poke around a bit but was already running late for work.<br /><br />This is definitely a welcomed addition to our neck of the woods - especially ConEd took away our other ice cream options last summer.

				Checked it out quickly this afternoon, very cute! Maybe a tad Brooklyn hipster-ish with the decor, but it&#039;s a great alternative when Starbucks is overflowing and FreezePeach is closed.<br /><br />Felt a little claustraphobic, though I&#039;m sure if I just sat down in the back it would&#039;ve been fine; I was just trying to get a look at it.

				I tried this place the other night and I really liked it.&nbsp; I had a banana smoothie (not exactly taking advantage of all the great old-fashioned things they make, but I was in the mood).&nbsp; The smoothie was good and the staff was nice.&nbsp; It is a bit narrow near the counter, so don&#039;t forget to look up and around at the high ceilings and notice all the little touches the owners added to provide the all-encompassing old-school experience.&nbsp; I found the old coca-cola icebox to be a great touch.&nbsp; For all the classic touches, there&#039;s certainly a modern streak to the decor as well.&nbsp; Next up, jam/maple syrup and a slice of pie...

				I (FINALLY!) stopped in here yesterday after hitting up Trade Fair &amp; Top Tomato for the week(ish), and I got my first root beer float of my life. I don&#039;t know how I made it to 28 without ever having a root beer float either, but I&#039;ve been talking about it for awhile now. It was decided (by my mom, haha), that I had to get it from a &quot;cool&quot; place (or at the very least, Dairy Queen back home) and that I couldn&#039;t make it myself.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I had to get it to go because I had frozen goods melting in my bag, but it was AWESOME. And walking back to my apartment from there was equally awesome because it was my idea of a perfect summer day (80, dry, sunny) and I had a root beer float! Everything = perfection!<br /><br />Love the old-school Coke cooler, and the people working there were totally cool/friendly/chatty too. Yay Oleput!

				Comparatively speaking, this place is more expensive for a muffin and iced mocha than Starbucks, but I&#039;m happier to spend my money here in order to support a locally owned business.&nbsp; I just have to remember to tell them to use skim milk, because they are using whole milk automatically.&nbsp; Granted it&#039;s organic, but that doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s not fattening.&nbsp; And I don&#039;t know about the brownie, but the ice cream I got the other day was most certainly not healthy, but a hell of a nice treat for myself :)

				I got an iced americano there today that was very good. However, I was confused when they put it in a hot coffee cup. Then I couldn&#039;t get the lid to stay open and it made me feel dumb. Dumb. However, I would do it again, while hoping they get different lids for the cups. Cause those raised ones with the hole are better for walking around and taking on the subway.

				I&#039;ve been in there with a friend, but didn&#039;t eat anything there yet.&nbsp; One of my friends told me that he got a milkshake and was surprised to find that it had ice in it.&nbsp; He also said that it was overpriced.&nbsp; When I was in there I saw them serve a milkshake to someone and it overflowed the glass and they wiped the sides of the glass with a towel.&nbsp; It was kind of messy.&nbsp; Maybe they dont&#039; know how to make milkshakes too good.&nbsp; I also thought that the glass was kind of small for the price.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s a nice place for atmosphere, but personally I think the prices are kind of high, except for a cup of tea.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s more of a place for atmosphere.&nbsp; If I want icecream I would rather go to the new Hershey&#039;s place which is a few blocks away.

				I am under the impression that they try to use organic products and maybe that is why some things cost more since it costs more for organic. Besides, they are the only ones in the neighborhood that have soy milk.

				I went there last night and had a scoop of vanilla with caramel, my husband had an cappuccino milkshake. We both really enjoyed them -- I particularly enjoyed the fact that they didn&#039;t charge me the extra 50 cents for the caramel. Good customer service! It was $3 for the ice cream and $4.50 for the milkshake. A little pricey, but reasonable for boutique ice cream I think.<br /><br />I recommend you stop by and give them a try.

				Actually FreezePeach has been offering Organic, Soy Milk, Homemade Ice Cream, etc for quite a while now.<br /><br />I had a vanilla shake in Oleput...everyone seems to pronounce it like &quot;Lilliput&quot;...as in Gulliver&#039;s Travels...which happens to be one of the used books on the shelf.<br /><br />Yup, $4.50. A bit pricey in the standard soda fountain tall tulip shaped glass. But tasty. I miss the &quot;extra / leftover shake&quot; in a small side glass from the blender cup that some places give you. It always irked me to see my presentation glass filled and the left over just dumped down the sink.<br /><br />These are the same owners of Sparrow across from the Beer Garden. They are making a try of it. In some ways it kinda reminds me of The Waltz start up with the old fashioned candies et al. But what soured me on the Waltz was their $$$. I remember getting a coffee and carrot cake and paid $9.00 for it last year...that&#039;s a Brunch...almost....or one glass of Chimay ($9.75) at Crescent and Vine...so i guess i shouldn&#039;t complain.<br /><br />The free WiFi...which is also available at Sparrow...is a nice addition. The place is so small I wonder if you could &#039;hangout&#039; long enough to use it.<br /><br />The decor reminds me more of the kind of establishment you&#039;d see in a college town like New Paltz. I agree that if it was another nail salon or bank I&#039;d just scream.<br /><br />Good luck to them, they appear to be off to a good start.<br /><br />{{ Sorry for the double posting.

				It is a little small, but it depends on the time of day how comfortable you can get. I sat at the bar on Saturday preparing lectures for about 4 hours, was comfy in the stool chair, and had full access to the internet. But if gets crowded I feel funny taking up a seat working...whereas at the waltz I don&#039;t get that feel. <br /><br />I had an iced coffee and a muffin...4.25...that doesn&#039;t seem excessive to me, but it might depend on what you get. Plus the internet if free which is charged at Freeze and Waltz. Not that they shouldn&#039;t charge, but it does bring down the price of the coffee if you use it and are used to paying.

Now the subject of gas, because of people complaining of the high price of gas and it&#039;s affects the govt is pushing ethanol. Ethanol is made of corn, you know what else corn is used for? Cow Feed.&nbsp; You know what the main ingredient in ice cream is? Milk. And where does milk come from? Cows.&nbsp; Now due to the fact that so much corn is being used for ethanol the price of corn has skyrocketed.

These are the same people who complain that Con Ed doesn&#039;t do enough to prevent power outages during the summer when usage is at it&#039;s highest. Yet when Con Ed wants to build a power plant near them they complain yet again. Instead of complaining come up with a better solution. Or just go back to Iowa where everthing is still a nickle. Now I must step off my soapbox and&nbsp; drive my SUV&nbsp; to my air conditioned home, and eat my expensive ice cream.<br />

I guess you didn&#039;t know, pink_floyd, that rents on Ditmars, for a 1-bedroom are hovering around $1400? Yes one bedroom. Not 3. I really don&#039;t see a problem paying for a premium product, occasionally, but then again I don&#039;t eat ice cream everyday. I consider it an indulgence, like gelato, for example, which is sold at La Guli ( and Marthas but they are wayyyyyyyyy overpriced). Now if I want something completely fabulous, I will cave in, and go buy a pint of Ciao Bella gelato at the Fresh Start Market.<br /><br />&nbsp;I know it can be upsetting to see that prices of certain products are heading into the stratosphere, but such is life and inflation. Remember that, that which happened in the 70&#039;s? A lot of us who lived in NYC back then can remember.<br />&nbsp;Now as for the remark about $3 gas prices being &quot;shoved down our throats&quot;. No one told you to drive an SUV&nbsp; which gets 18mpg! Buy a hybrid or better yet go here http://www.zapworld.com/Default.aspx (http://www.zapworld.com/Default.aspx) and get one of those.<br /><br /><br />

Ice cream is, as previously mentioned, an indulgence. But even if their prices are considered a rip-off for what you&#039;re getting, you can still just as easily go to your local grocery store and get a tub of ice cream, along with being able to go to a few local restaurants/bakeries and getting ice cream there. It&#039;s not like they have an ice cream monopoly. <br /><br />Overpriced or not, I am happy that Oleput is here and I think they&#039;ll find that enough people around here are willing to spend that kind of money on that kind of thing in that kind of environment. Not everyone wants the cheapest stuff available in a crappy setting; some people want to feel like they&#039;re getting something good. I wonder if they&#039;ll have seasonal offerings there.

				I went here over the weekend and thought it was horrible. They really need to bring prices down-- or actually fill the cup (when you fill a cup half-way your customers notice!)!? The ambiance was pretty good, half old malt shop half take-a-book-leave-a-book coffee shop. They had way too many people working though the day I went (Sat) and everyone was bumping into each other back there. Also, the person at the register couldn&#039;t speak English and didn&#039;t understand what we were ordering?! <br /><br />I sat in the back and the owners, or worker&#039;s friends (?), were all hovering around back there looking all paranoid. They kept going to the basement in groups-- &quot;is this place some sort of cover operation&quot; is all I could think...

				Belle, that is strange about those people going to the basement in groups.&nbsp; I only went there once and thought the atmosphere was nice.&nbsp; I liked the music that they had playing, but the prices are ridiculous.

				I&#039;ve definitely enjoyed Oleput&#039;s coffee (iced Americano) and snack treats. I&#039;ve yet to venture into their sodas, but they had an all-natural lemonade sweetened with apple juice that was outstanding.

I&#039;ve tried the limeade as well, but the lemonade is waaaay better in my opinion. Really delicious even though I thought they had given me the wrong beverage at first because of the color.&nbsp; :-)
