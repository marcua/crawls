				Does anyone believe this bs? :shocked: <br />I sure hope it&#039;s not true, because I&#039;m moving in to a new place on June 2nd!

				Well according to Harold Camping, the Rapture starts at 6:00 p.m. on 5/21/11, New Zealand being the first one hit.&nbsp; Well......as of now, it&#039;s 7:00 p.m. in New Zealand and there&#039;s no earthquake, and people over there are like &quot;what happened?&quot;.&nbsp; Honestly, I don&#039;t want to know when the end comes, I prefer to not know.&nbsp; That way, since I don&#039;t know each day that I wake up I will continue to try to be the best person that I can be, and when I make mistakes to make sure I reconcile them and apologize to whoever I have to, face up to my errors, and really try not to make the same error again, that way whether it&#039;s my time to go or everyone&#039;s time to go, I&#039;ll try to be prepared but not because I know, but because...I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; :kiss:&nbsp; &nbsp;I hope all those people that spent their life savings...didn&#039;t spend ALL of their savings, I have no idea what they&#039;re going to do to continue living in this world without anything to their name and I doubt that Mr. Camping is going to open his home and help these people out.

				I guess there&#039;s some confusion going on.&nbsp; I thought if Greenwich Mean is zero, then the rapture would start 6 pm their time.&nbsp; Was it supposed to start at 6 pm in the Greenwich -12 time zone?&nbsp; Or at 6 pm in California, where this nut-case preacher is?&nbsp; And if the world ends, doesn&#039;t it end all at once?<br /><br /><br />On a serious note, we all know that this preacher is going to say that we were spared, that God had mercy on us and let us live or that the pure weren&#039;t pure enough for the rapture.&nbsp; That is, if he and his followers are still alive.&nbsp; I can&#039;t help but wonder if these nut-cases are going to have Jim Jones, Heaven&#039;s Gate style mass suicides or start mass murdering non-believers.<br /><br /><br />As for believers and their non-post apocalypse finances, Sherri Shepherd said on The View that when she was younger she ran into financial problems when another nut-case preacher said the world was going to end and she didn&#039;t pay her bills because after x date it wasn&#039;t going to matter.&nbsp; It took her a long time to get herself together financially after that.<br /><br /><br />But, there&#039;s only 2 hours to go locally, so..... party on! :tongue:&nbsp; &nbsp;:kiss:&nbsp; &nbsp;:cool:
