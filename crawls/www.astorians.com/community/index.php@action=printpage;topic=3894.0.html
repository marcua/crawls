				As you may or may not know, I now have braces.&nbsp; They hurt a lot and I had no idea that they would inhibit my eating so much.&nbsp; So I&#39;ve decided to make a couple of smooth soups.&nbsp; I am thinking about a butternut squash/leek/ginger number.&nbsp; Does anyone have any other ideas?&nbsp; I am not against blending veggies.&nbsp; Small rice might be okay too.&nbsp; Thanks!&nbsp; :-)

				I just bought Trader Joe&#39;s pumpkin butter, which the jar says can be easily be turned into a pumpkin soup by adding like, a quarter cup of sour cream (or something like that) and heating ... if you&#39;re looking for a super-easy suggestion. Pumpkin soups are so good!

				Buy a cheap stick blender ($20)<br />Roast some veggies like squash, tomatoes, onions<br />Put roast veggies in a pot with some water or veg/chicken stock, butter. Puree till smooth.<br />Add seasonings: salt, pepper, basil, oregano, cumin and eat.<br /><br />Check Food network or Epicurious and search soups or soup puree.

				This might sound odd but if you puree up some fettucine alfredo it makes a great soupy dish.&nbsp; When I was a kid I had a bit of a daredevil trick gone wrong on my bike and bit straight through my tongue which required stitches and no solid food for a few weeks.&nbsp; That was one of my favorite &quot;meals&quot; while I was healing up.

				Don&#39;t forget smoothies, too! Just because it&#39;s cold outside doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t still enjoy those. They might even be soothing to your mouth. <br /><br />I had braces for three years starting in 7th grade. Even though it was so long ago I still remember how painful those first few days were. Whenever you go in for adjustments or if you ever have to use rubber bands you&#39;ll be wanting smooth soup again, although it&#39;s never as bad as the first days of getting used to braces.<br /><br />How long will you have them?

				Ever since the weather got cold I have been making soup like a fiend, here&#39;s a simple way to make any veggie soup:<br /><br />Onion, carrots, and celery, and chicken or veggie stock. These are the basic stock ingredients, keep these on hand at all times. I prefer chicken stock over veggie for flavor.<br /><br />Chop an small onion, two stalks of celery and one large or two small carrots.<br /><br />Use a root or squash veggie as your main ingredient. I use pumpkin, butternut squash, sweet potato, potato, etc. Peel, de-seed, and chop up about two-three cups.<br /><br />Heat a large soup pot and a tablespoon of butter, or olive or canola oil, whatever you prefer. Throw in all the veggies and saute for 5 minutes. This &quot;sweats&quot; the veggies releasing their flavor.<br /><br />Pour in the chick/veggie stock. Pour just enough to cover the veggies, usually a 32oz container is more than enough. Simmer the veggies for about a half an hour until the carrots are soft. Let the soup cool a bit.<br /><br />Put soup in blender and blend in small batches until smooth. Pour back into pot. Add salt and pepper to taste. If you want it creamy add some whole milk or half and half. I usually don&#39;t put cream or milk in it.<br /><br />This batch will make about 48oz. 1 1/2 of those large chinese soup containers.

				another blended soup that I really is something my mom makes with peas:<br />basically, you blend together about one and 1/2 cup peas (defrosted from a frozen pack ok) with one cup broth (vegetable or chicken - you can buy them prepared) and adding some fresh mint and thyme (about 1/2 a teaspoon each) as well as salt and pepper to taste...<br /><br />have you tried any of the soup recipes yet, artstar?

				If you don&#39;t feel like making it yourself, a good store-bought option is Campbell&#39;s Select Gold Label butternut squash soup (it&#39;s packaged in a little carton). Very tasty, I&#39;ve been buying it often lately. Makes for a nice Fall soup, and something a little different/nicer than most of the canned soup you usually see. They carry it at Key Food, don&#39;t know about the other markets...

				Speaking of butternut squash...<br /><br />I made this http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_25678,00.html?rsrc=search (http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_25678,00.html?rsrc=search) recipe this afternoon and it came out fantastic!&nbsp; I substituted chicken stock for water, cut the curry by half a tablespoon and added a teaspoon of powdered ginger.&nbsp; YUM!
