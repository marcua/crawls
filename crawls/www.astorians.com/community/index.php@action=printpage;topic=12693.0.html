				Don&#039;t know if this is the right place to post but...I&#039;m new to the area and have been living here for a few months.I happen to live by 30th avenue and every weekend the cafes that line up the street are packed with very good looking Greek girls or Eastern European girls.What can I say my eyes almost popped out of my head!! lol I&#039;m from Tampa and we have some cute girls but not as well dressed and good looking as these girls at the cafe.After some time I ventured to a Greek club called Caprice which a waiter at a cafe recommended going.Again very nice music,crowd and lots of good looking ladies.<br /><br />Now my dilemma.I have noticed that at the cafes it seems like everyone goes in groups like 4 or 5 girls at a table,all dressed up looking good,showing off but I see no men approach them.Men eye them but thats as far as it goes.Next you have the mixed groups like 3 or 4 girls with 4 or 5 guys lets say.You figure some are relatives,maybe siblings and the rest their boyfriends.Again no flirting no one approaching ladies.It seems like people either go with their friends,relatives or boyfriends but no single ladies to be approached or if there are a few you must have some wingmen.Same thing with the Greek club Caprice all I saw were couples or big groups of friends but no one actively pursuing.A few drunk guys leering and staring at girls but for the most part nothing there.<br /><br />To wrap this up my question is... Where do you go to find a Greek girl to have a relationship with?? I&#039;m not asking for hooking up or one night stand just to talk,hang out and take it from there. Where did all these people who are Greek that I have seen at the cafes and clubs meet up? Do you have to be part of some social club,a church or maybe have lots of Greek friends to network off and introduce you? Because from what I have seen the Greek places are totally opposite of the American bars in Manhattan where people do go to meet up as opposed to people watch and show off.

				[Statement in violation of board rules deleted by Mod - AJTNYC]<br /><br /><br />Ok in response to the original post .....<br /><br />Are u greek ?&#160; What kinda job do u have ? What kinda car do u drive ?&#160;&nbsp; :-D&#160; Just kidding , not all greek girls are like that but sad to say many are .&#160;&nbsp; <br /><br />Ok seriously , how old are you ? And what nationality are u &gt;? Cuz most of the those cafe dwellers are early to mid 20&#039;s / To be honest alot of greek chics stick with their own .&#160; Not all but alot do .Many come from bklyn , bronx , nj and Longisland just to be in the greek scene and chill . Greek clubs/bars like caprice are mostly clicks . Cavo , another astoria greek club , is more mixed european and not all greek.&#160; Not many go to caprice&#160; to pick up , even though some might . Again money doesnt hurt .&#160;&nbsp; Greek women seem to be very spoiled in the upbringing dept , wanting Mr. Donald Trump in a Brad pitt body to show up at their door / <br />Again im not saying all greek girls are looking for a greek guy , but those at greek places probably do . <br />Its a pretty funny scene though , they will spend tons on getting nails , hair , top designer outfits and bags&#160; , doing top notch makeup&#160; yet when a&#160; guy with kohones steps up&#160; , they will roll their eyes&#160; and walk away .&#160; I see this allll the time in those places and its&#160; funny .&#160; So i wouldnt pick a club in astoria to meet a future girlfriend . At a cafe unless the girl is right next to u that u want to talk to , its kinda hard to&#160; step to her table and just start talking to her . But then again , maybe it isnt .&#160; Either way , unless u make a move u wont know what can happen . <br />

				If you want a high-maintenance girlfriend, then make sure you have the money and look the part. Any woman who goes through those kind of lengths to look hot on a regular basis is on a mission. And if she&#039;s natrually good-looking to begin with, she&#039;s being approached constantly, so she can afford to be picky.<br /><br />Besides, what&#039;s so special about a Greek woman? You&#039;re limiting your options for no reason, considering how many terrific single women there are in the NYC area from all different cultures. People sometimes think <em>I&#039;m</em> Greek (coming up to me in the store and speaking Greek) but I&#039;m far from it! <br /><br />Maybe become a regular at your local cafe so that the women there get used to seeing you. Be friendly (not flirty) and chances are the women will take notice. Dress nice without looking like you&#039;re trying, read a book, sit near the window. If I worked at a cafe and knew that such-and-such a guy would be coming in regularly, I just might mention him to my single friends.<br /><br />Anyway, I don&#039;t belong in this forum anyway, just had to give my 2 cents......<br /><br />

				I think it&#039;s important to note that not everyone at these cafes and clubs is Greek.&nbsp; It&#039;s also important not to paint all Greeks in the same light.&nbsp; There are many beautiful women that go out in Astoria that aren&#039;t Greek, and why limit yourself to just one ethnicity?&nbsp; I&#039;ve had similar thoughts towards many of the handsome European men here, and in Cavo and Central, flirting is common.&nbsp; And I&#039;m not Greek.&nbsp; But I will tell you that bars and clubs are often not the best way to meet someone for the long term.&nbsp; It&#039;s often a good way to meet a jerk or ditz.&nbsp; Try meetup.com and join a local group that shares a common interest with you.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve met a lot of fun people this way.&nbsp; Just get out there and enjoy yourself.&nbsp; &nbsp;And don&#039;t be afraid to say hello to a girl.&nbsp; They&#039;re not all going to ignore you and if they do, they weren&#039;t worth your time anyway.&nbsp; You never know who you&#039;re going to meet unless you take a chance.

				I think your best shot is to get buddy buddy with some Greek grandmas and help out at some Church socials.&nbsp; It&#039;s almost like the Greek families around here have arranged marriages so when you are young and still single you look good, go out, flirt but it is not how you meet your future spouse.<br /><br />Not Greek and not too serious about this but have wondered about it myself.

				I am not Greek but if your goal is to have a Greek girlfriend, it helps to learn about their culture and history and be willing to learn some phrases.<br /><br />Spend some time talking to Greek people in the neighborhood and make friends with them, and see if that can lead to an invitation to social outings or perhaps meeting an extended family at a gathering.&nbsp; This is a much better way to meet women as you are introduced and in the company of mutual friends.<br />

				Pulled Pork , sorry but i know tons of greek girls and tons of greek families ., Non of which have or want arranged marriages . Dont know where u base your info from , but maybe u are confusing getting set up or introduced to someone who is the same nationality . But arranged , no way .

				While it might make for interesting people watching, cafe&#039;s aren&#039;t really where you go to meet a greek girl. Generally as a culture, an individual coming up to the girls to chat them up is seen as odd. The way in is through a friend, or a friend of a friend. Rarely is there another way into the group. We don&#039;t go to cafe&#039;s to meet others, but to meet with friends, and meet our friends friends. Clubbing is the same... if a bunch of girls are in a group, it is seen as sort of odd for someone not part of the group, or that they haven&#039;t been introduced to, to try and join in. <br /><br />However, i&#039;m not sure if seeking out a girlfriend based on her culture and ethnicity alone is the best way to go. And speaking as a greek girl, it can be somewhat more challenging to infiltrate this group if you aren&#039;t greek...not impossible, just challenging. <br /><br />And not all greek girls are high-maintenance, but even if that were the case, why does everyone hate on the high-maintenance? Let them spend their money on hair nails and bags...what does anyone else give a s___ about that...live and let live. <br /><br />

				<em>why does everyone hate on the high-maintenance? Let them spend their money on hair nails and bags...</em><br /><br />It&#039;s the long-term implications with such a person (man OR woman, but most often women.) An outdoorsy type of guy isn&#039;t going to have much fun with a woman who&#039;s loathe to break a nail, and vice-versa. A guy who doesn&#039;t make much money won&#039;t be able to make her happy.

				Well alot of times , those high maintenance women depend on a man to support their habits . God forbid u dont comply with their wants, u might be out the door . When u see teenyboppers with $1500 Dior hand bags , seems like spoiling is from their up bringing and its what they are used to and look for later in life.

				The Astoria Greek scene is not the best place to hook up or meet a girlfriend.&nbsp; Many of the girls are very into themselves and care a lot of what other people think, so if they get seen hooking up or talking to a stranger they will start to be labeled as a whore.&nbsp; Unless you know people in the clique you will not be hooking up.&nbsp; I am not saying its impossible to hookup at these Greek places (I have a few times) but it is just very difficult.<br /><br />As for the women who are with guys for their cars, trust me they are not getting any action the old ugly farts just like to show off and spend money on girls they will never have.&nbsp; Losers in my book.&nbsp; Yea let me lease a Mercedes so I can show off to some 20 year old Greek girls and buy them drinks at Cavo or Central lol makes me laugh.&nbsp; Cars don&#039;t mean much now.&nbsp; There are guys in Astoria driving Bentleys and Lamborghinis the girls don&#039;t care about that stuff as much as you think.&nbsp; The ones who do care about that are girls you don&#039;t want to be in relationships with.&nbsp; <br /><br />Best bet is to just have a good time and be confident.&nbsp; If you see a good looking girl give them a smile maybe a little chit chat but don&#039;t get desperate and start buying them drinks unless you know your gonna get something out of it.&nbsp; A lot of these European girls like to play hard to get too, so they will be interested but will not show it.&nbsp; I don&#039;t go for that crap&nbsp; though.<br /><br /><br />

				Is it yellow? I&#039;ve seen an ultra-fancy car every so often not far from here. <br /><br />A gull-wing Ferrari (?) once pulled up to Corona Ice King while we were getting ices this past summer. That was fun to watch. Even Ferrari drivers like their $2 ices&nbsp; :lol:

				I like how you guys changed topics LOL<br /><br />BTW not all Greek girls have that typical &quot;money-hungry, high-maintenance, my daddy buys me sh*t for me&quot; mentality. <br /><br />Going back to the OP&#039;s Question-- It&#039;s hard to meet anyone in a club to begin with because it&#039;s loud, which means you cannot hear anything half the time, and girls kind of find it annoying or as a turn off. <br /><br />I am in a lot of organizations so I tend to meet a lot of people through there. I would suggest you going to the Hellenic-American Chamber of Commerce Events. Their events are typically in Manhattan, but you can meet a lot of Greek-American young adults and network this way. Do you go to church at all? <br /><br />BTW- I love Caprice, i&#039;m there almost every Saturday :) I can definitely this is the best Greek club in Astoria ;)<br /><br />

				the way you meet a greek girl is the same way you meet every other girl: you know! you go up to the tribal chief and tell him how many goats you have and how many you are willing to offer to the clan...then he cuts your balls off because you ask unremarkable questions.....

Generally as a culture, an individual coming up to the girls to chat them up is seen as odd. The way in is through a friend, or a friend of a friend. Rarely is there another way into the group. We don&#039;t go to cafe&#039;s to meet others, but to meet with friends, and meet our friends friends. Clubbing is the same... if a bunch of girls are in a group, it is seen as sort of odd for someone not part of the group, or that they haven&#039;t been introduced to, to try and join in. <br /><br />However, i&#039;m not sure if seeking out a girlfriend based on her culture and ethnicity alone is the best way to go. And speaking as a greek girl, it can be somewhat more challenging to infiltrate this group if you aren&#039;t greek...not impossible, just challenging. <br /><br />And not all greek girls are high-maintenance, but even if that were the case, why does everyone hate on the high-maintenance? Let them spend their money on hair nails and bags...what does anyone else give a s___ about that...live and let live. <br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Very true<br /><br />Every Greek girl I met was from a friend or friend of a friend.&nbsp; Its just how the culture is.
