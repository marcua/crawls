				Hi everyone! I&#039;m knew to this board and have been soaking up all the information. My roommate and I are relocating from Michigan, and I am a little nervous about finding a place. I&#039;ve visited Astoria a few times, and I love the atmosphere there (a friend of mine lives off the 36th street stop.) Since we&#039;re moving from so far, I&#039;m trying to get all the help I can. We aren&#039;t using a broker, so I&quot;m rallying all my resources. <br /><br />My roommate and I are coming into the city around the 20th of this month, and would love some leads on places or if anyone knows of anything. Or general moving tips would be great too; I&#039;ve learned so much from browsing the threads that I realize you all are a wealth of information. We are looking for a 2&nbsp; bedroom, around 1400 and we are first time renters. It&#039;d be nice to be near the N,W trains for work. TIA for your help!!&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />

				use a broker. you can get lucky but honestly, use a broker.<br />or<br />call the management company on 21st street and 21st ave (thats where the office is, they have apts all the way up to 28th street.).<br />they have nice 2br&#039;s for 1450. i honestly don&#039;t think you&#039;re going to find a better deal. most real 2br&#039;s are going for at least 1600 these days, and you won&#039;t have the time to pound the pavement for several weeks.<br /><br />good luck!

				And if you really really really want to go the no broker route, you ought to sublet first and hunt from there so that you have time to actually not end up in some illegal basement apartment.

				I must have lucked out because my husband and I found an apartment in two days, and rented directly from the owner so no broker&#039;s fees.&nbsp; We used the ads in the back of the Village Voice and just made a bunch of phone calls.&nbsp; So there is some hope!<br /><br />Otherwise, I would agree with the others that the NYC housing market is insane, be ready to make a decision on the spot, and make sure that you have all the paperwork with you that you&#039;ll need - such as two forms of ID, a letter from your employer stating your salary, a credit report if possible.

				This might be useful for the OP - did you pay the realtor/broker/landlord in cash, money order, or personal check?&nbsp; We paid our landlord using an out-of-state personal check, but maybe that is not the norm?

				You guys have been very helpful. My roommate and I have a place to stay until we find a place of our own, so our time window is pretty flexible. <br /><br />I am still really interested to know the type of paperwork everyone had to bring, particularly those who relocated from out of state. I realize i am at a loss as to what I&#039;ll need. The job i am leaving pays significantly less than the job I am coming to, so my pay stubs aren&#039;t going to be an accurate reflection of what I can afford in rent: how would be the best way to present that? You all have been supremely helpful, and the more information you can give me, the better. thanks.
