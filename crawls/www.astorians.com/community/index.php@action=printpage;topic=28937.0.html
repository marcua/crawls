				Hey, does anyone know what happened to Michael&#039;s diner on Broadway? I just walked by this evening (2/20) and noticed it was closed, and it looks like they&#039;ll be closed for good. Too bad. I like that place.

				If you call them, eventually it goes to message &quot;due to fire upstairs we will be closed until March 5.&quot;

				Yes, I walked by the other day and noticed a lot of fire debris on the ground and the upstairs apartment or office windows boarded up.&nbsp; Sounds like they have some renovating to do before they reopen.

				I drove by this morning past 34th &amp; Broadway and noticed the old Uncle George on the corner next door to Michaels was boarded up. Was that due to the fire as well?

				Sorry AlexNYC, Uncle George&#039;s has been closed for several months now. Nothing to do with the fire.

				But I don&#039;t think Uncle George&#039;s had been boarded up until recently. It might be progress on the new restaurant coming in:<br />http://weheartastoria.com/2015/02/rumor-new-greek-restaurant-to-open-in-uncle-georges-space/ (http://weheartastoria.com/2015/02/rumor-new-greek-restaurant-to-open-in-uncle-georges-space/)<br /><br /><br />

				It looks like Uncle George&#039;s was affected by the same fire as Michaels. And by the looks of it Michaels will not be open by March 5th.

				I actually met someone yesterday who is a Michael&#039;s regular and this came up in conversation.<br /><br /><br />There was a fire in an apartment above the restaurant and as a result they suffered smoke and water damage. <br />Seems the fire was started by someone smoking in bed.<br /><br /><br />Staff has been told it will be closed for 6 to 8 weeks to do repairs, but possibly longer if delays occur. I just feel <br />sorry for the workers as they need to find temp jobs until it reopens. <br /><br />

				Walked by this morning as people were taking down the awning.&nbsp; Asked if they were renovating or closing and was told &quot;closing.&quot;&nbsp; Said they hoped to reopen &quot;somewhere&quot; in the neighborhood.

				That stinks. No more diner food on Broadway unless you count the Doral Donut shop on 32nd st and Broadway. Then you have Sanfords, but I don&#039;t classify it as an old school diner. I guess then it&#039;s the Bel Aire all the way on 21st.

				They have a new awning up and a sign in the window that they will be opening on Saturday, 4/4.&nbsp; I&#039;ve missed them and really happy they will be reopening very soon.
