				So many events...phew! Anyway, again, thanks for supporting the Astoria Music Now Festival. Continue on to this one and I swear a good time. This event is my baby at Waltz-Astoria every month and I&#039;m really excited about this Thursday. Tony O&#039;Neill is not only an excellent writer but an engaging reader. I&#039;m actually really proud of every one that is performing this night. It&#039;s a very unique experience because it&#039;s more than a reading and just underneath a balls out party. Here&#039;s the info...there&#039;s nothing in Astoria like this. <br /><br /><div align="center">Thursday July 31<br />A Night With The Whiskey Dregs<br />a one night stand<br />Thursday, July 31 @ 8PM - 11PM<br />at Waltz-Astoria<br />Enjoy edgy and contreversial poetry, short stories, and musical acts with A Night With The Whiskey Dregs<br />Hosted by Carlos Detres<br />Thursday, July 31, 2008<br />at Waltz-Astoria (www.waltz-astoria.com)<br />(71 8) 956-8748<br />23-14 Ditmars Boulevard<br />8:00 PM - 11:00 PM<br /><br />The Waltz-Astoria is an intimate setting with a vast selection of beers and wine as well as tea and coffee.

Here are your performers:<br />Tony O’Neill - writer of Diggin’ the Vein and the upcoming books Hero of the Underground and Down And Out on Murder Mile.<br />Nate Metzker - Musician.

				The new issue of The Whiskey Dregs: Unplugged just came out and will be on sale tonight at Waltz-Astoria as a pre-release. Chris designed this and it looks pretty amazing. I&#039;m impressed with it and I&#039;m not just saying that because it&#039;s our release. <br /><br />We&#039;re an Astoria-based publisher and rely on your support to keep doing what we&#039;re doing. <br /><br />Go here for more info:<br /><br />www.whiskeydregs.com

				Hey, all. Thank you SO much for coming out and supporting last night. It was a really great turn out and almost everyone who attended was from Astoria, which strangely has never happened before. They&#039;re usually from all over the city so it was great to see people from our neighborhood.<br /><br />A lot of people asked about Tony O&#039;Neill afterward. The books he&#039;s written taht you can buy are:<br /><br />Seizure Wet Dreams (poetry)<br />Songs From The Shooting Gallery (poetry)<br />Diggin&#039; The Vein (novel)<br />Hero of the Underground (novel)<br /><br />You can get all of his work from Amazon.com. I&#039;m reading Songs From The Shooting Gallery and Hero of the Underground now and they&#039;re really f&#039;ing good. I really believe that he&#039;s one of the most important writers out there right now.<br /><br />Thanks again.
