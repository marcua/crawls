You get Laban Movement Analysis and the Bartenieff Fundamentals exercises designed to facilitate integration and expression in movement.<br />The fundamentals are based on anatomical principles that work with alignment, &nbsp;coordination,strength, flexibility, mobility and kinesthetic awareness. They will also reduce physical stress and injury.<br />When you combine Laban Movement Analysis and Bartenieff Fundamentals you will get greater understanding of yourself and others as well as be able to enhance the quality of all kinds of movement and performances.<br /><br />This class will give the opportunity to explore your own ways to move.<br />You will &nbsp;learn; create movement; &nbsp;and understand how to relax and reduce stress through everyday &nbsp;movement.<br />This class is appropriate to everyone, because this is a new language.<br />From theater, dance, phisycal education, music, therapy,athletics,non-verbal communication, cross-cultural or &nbsp;just to understand &nbsp;movement &nbsp;you will have a great benefit of this class, come and see it.<br /><br />Ceceu kingshill is a Brazilian/American.<br />&nbsp;She is a Certified Movement Analyst for over 11 years<br />She has taught movement analysis courses in New York, California, Thailand and Brazil. <br /><br />&quot; Each bodily movement is embedded in a chain of infinite happenings...In every trace form created by the body, both infinity and eternety are hidden&quot; &nbsp;Rudolf Laban.
