				I think it&#039;s messed up for places to charge cover on New Year&#039;s Eve. There&#039;s a level of conceit and it forces people to buy in for something they may not even want. It&#039;s like a punishment for people that otherwise would want to spend time there.

				No one said they are forced, but if it s place you otherwise enjoy frequenting, it is disappointing when regulars are unable to enjoy their favorite spot because of what is essentially price gouging. I just see it as such places looking to milk their customers.

				How is this price gouging? A fixed price was charged for a special party on a special night. It wasn&#039;t a cover charge just to walk through the door, or <span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font">something for nothing. </span>For $60, five drinks, a glass of champagne and three food courses were provided.<br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t go out on NYE, so I&#039;ll leave it to the people who do to decide whether $60 is reasonable or not but it sounds just about right to me considering the menu.

				Establishments also charge a cover for NYE because there are people who hop from place to place, which creates a hectic pace of in and out customers. Paying prix-fixe for an evening is better for the bar or restaurant and its customers. $60 seems very reasonable given the outrageous cover some places charge.&nbsp;

				There&#039;s no such thing as &quot;price gouging&quot; on goods or services that are clearly non-essential. It&#039;s a free market, some places decide to charge a fixed rate on holidays like this, other&#039;s don&#039;t. There&#039;s certainly lots of choices for those who decide to go out. If you don&#039;t like the price, go somewhere else.

				Actually, if the $60 price included all of what was listed - the five bar drink vouchers, the food, seating, etc. that was a very good deal. We paid $40 for a prix fixe dinner at Thirsty Koala, which was delicious and a great evening, but drinks were separate. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m told Mojave was charging $120 per person because they had a live band. <br /><br /><br />It&#039;s much easier to budget with a fixed cover price so you have no surprises. And with so much variety/choices now in our<br />area, we have a lot of wonderful options so I don&#039;t see a need to complain.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m not waiting until New Years Eve then! We&#039;re always looking for good local spots like you describe TJT. Based on Astorians opinions we tried Enthaice and were really impressed.

				Watch out for the pricing structure here though. When I went (and didn&#039;t go back btw) we ordered Old Fashioned off the menu. It had one price printed next to it. I asked the bartender out of curiosity which brand Rye they put in it, and he said &quot;Your choice.&quot; So me and my friend picked whatever we wanted.<br /><br />When the bill came we were charged not the price on the menu, but prices according to the Ryes selected, along with a surcharge for the ice in the drink (as if ice isn&#039;t water).<br /><br />Decent enough atmosphere, I&#039;d say poor service, but a well tasting Old Fashioned.<br /><br />You&#039;ve been warned though. Charge for ice???...

				Just wanted to mention that Rocco contacted me via Yelp to offer a gift card or something to make up for it. I replied via email then heard nothing. Then I got an email to my personal account asking if I used the gift card I never received so I replied again. Then I heard nothing until today when I realized I&#039;m now on the Bourbon and Vine email-list&nbsp; :angry: <br /><br />Still can&#039;t recommend the place unfortunately. <br /><br />On the bright side of things northwestern Queens is now really expensive for housing. Perhaps this place fits like a glove.
