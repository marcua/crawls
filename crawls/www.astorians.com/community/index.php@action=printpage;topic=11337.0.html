				Hi guys! I&#039;m moving at the end of August so I thought I&#039;d get a jump start on the items that i won&#039;t be taking with me to my new place. <br />I&#039;ve posted them on craigslist, but I&#039;ll give preference to my fellow Astorians first! <br /><br /><br />2 Target bar stools, $40 for both:&nbsp; http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/fur/756667266.html<br /><br />Ikea dining table and 4 chairs, $50: http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/fur/756694062.html<br /><br />Target brown/black &quot;leather&quot; ottoman: $25: http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/fur/756702291.html<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Also selling: (I&#039;ve got pics of all of these that I can email you.. can&#039;t seem to resize them)<br /><br />Digital Camera, $60. (I just got a new one, this still works perfectly): Olympus Camedia Digital Cam, D-540 Zoom, 3.2 megapixel<br /><br />2 Ikea thin bookshelves, each 7 feet tall! $50 (costs $200 total). Was part of a large entertainment center. Looks like this: http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50029256&nbsp; ... but each bookshelf is 6 cubby spaces high, making it much taller.<br /><br /><br />Ikea TV stand, $50 (costs $220), has pull out storage for DVDS, etc and built in spaces for cable box/DVD/VCR, in &quot;medium brown&quot; color, see on Ikea&#039;s site: http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/90086805&nbsp; ... has 2 small chips on it, but really great deal anyway.<br /><br /><br />RCA VCR with remote control, $15 (still works, I just don&#039;t use a VCR anymore)<br /><br />Granny/Shopping Cart, $5<br /><br />Tall, adjustable floor fan, $10 (white, works perfectly, just don&#039;t need it in my new place)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I&#039;m in the Ditmars area and anything you see here can be picked up this weekend. Just PM me, respond here, or reply to the craigslist ad (mention you&#039;re from Astorians). Thanks guys!&nbsp; :-) Amy<br />

				You still have the bookshelves? I was just going to bite the bullet and go to Steinway and get something this weekend, but if yours work for me, I&#039;ll take them. What color are they? PM me, thanks!<br /><br />-randall

				Hey... yeah a few things are for sale still. I actually just posted this stuff up on Craigslist again last night.<br /><br />http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/fuo/797462203.html<br /><br />I&#039;ve already gotten replies for the TV Stand and the VCR, so this is what&#039;s left for sale:<br /><br />Available: Schwinn Bike, Ikea Bookcases, Kitchen table and chairs, standing fan.<br /><br />Thanks!

				Thanks! I actually can&#039;t be in Astoria during those times so let me know if someone is a no-show again on you! I&#039;d definitely be interested in the standing fan, 2 bookshelves and possibly the tv stand (if person doesn&#039;t collect).

				Great! I got another batch of no-shows this morning. Selling on craigslist and astorians always brings out the unreliables I guess! I&#039;ll PM you so we can set up a time that hopefully works for both of us.
