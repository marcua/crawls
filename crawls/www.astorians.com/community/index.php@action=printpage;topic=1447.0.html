				Well, friendly with the Pakistani government, which is a highly non-democratic military junta, and really only because they&#39;re pushovers. The area that the bombing occured in is, to the best of my understanding, only nominally Pakistan. The central government has very little control over it. Which is why the remnants of Al Q is able to hole up there. <br /><br />I wonder what sorts of reaction there would have been in Pakistan if Zarqawi had actually attended the dinner and been killed...<br />

				Actually it was neither of them because neither of them were there. ;-)<br /><br />... I wonder how people would react if he actually did attend the dinner and got killed... but the dinner was in Austria or France.

				Zawahiri was the supposed intended target.&nbsp; But was not there.&nbsp; They&#39;re saying that Al Queda&#39;s bomb expert might have been taken out, though.

				Whew!,<br /><br />That&#39;s a relief. Al Queda is now deprived of bomb making resources. Again, thank God and GWB we are yet again <span class="bbc_u">safe</span> from the evil terrorists.&lt;/wiping sweat off forehead&gt;<br />(I just hope that they don&#39;t start taking up residence near me or my impoverished village!)<br /><br />-An American P.A.T.R.I.O.T.

				18 Pakistani Villagers were killed.&nbsp; A small price to pay to take out a bomb maker, I guess?<br /><br />Hmm...
