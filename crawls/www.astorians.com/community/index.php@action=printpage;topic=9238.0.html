				I order from them from time to time and 90% of the time it has gone so smoothly, usually they send it via UPS and if I am not in, they leave the package with my super.<br /><br />My order this week got sent via A-1 Courier Services (what?! who are they?), who left me a note telling me to contact Amazon, with none of their contact information (why would you ever let people contact you?).&nbsp; They did not leave another note and when I called Amazon today to see what was up, the Amazon tracking mechanism tells me the package has both been delivered and is undeliverable.&nbsp; It appears after one attempt (in the middle of a work day on Thursday) they sent it back.<br /><br />Has anyone else had this problem?&nbsp; Anyone heard of A-1 Courier Services?&nbsp; I got their number and called them, but you can not get an answer and there are no supervisors.&nbsp; I just got lied to (we tried to deliver it three times and left delivery slips, Thursday, Friday and today?&nbsp; Thursday, Friday and a second attempt on Friday?&nbsp; &quot;I have no idea, you should have been there to pick up the package.&quot;) and given the run-around and told to call Amazon again.

				Amazon usually has some of the best customer service so I&#039;m sure it will be okay. Did you order direct from Amazon or one of the merchants that sells through them? If it&#039;s one of the merchants then you might have a harder time.<br /><br />I&#039;ve not had a problem with Amazon in this way though. They usually ship USPS or UPS. Though even those two carriers will try once and then say they&#039;ve been there three times. I think delivery in NYC in general is pretty bad.

				Probably true, just can&#039;t believe how bad A-1 was!<br />I ordered directly through Amazon from Amazon, so I&#039;m sure all will be made right.&nbsp; I just hope they aren&#039;t moving over to using these weird, unreliable delivery services.

				No troubles here- even with an &quot;A1 courier&quot; thing. I wondered about it when I ordered something for the holidays. It turned out they mailed it USPS and was in my mailbox in 3-4 days. &lt;shrug&gt;<br /><br />

				After this past mothers day I will never use Amazon again.&nbsp; My wife and I ordered a lenox flower vase for her and my grandmother.&nbsp; One was being shipped to NY the other Florida.&nbsp; We got ours but then they said for the other one that it was out of stock and they would let us know when it was in stock again.&nbsp; After waiting about 2 weeks, we find out that my Grandmother never got it.&nbsp; We went onto our account and saw that they cancelled the order.&nbsp; We we called them up to explain it, they were very rude and unhelpful.&nbsp; When we looked up the item again online, it was still showing out of stock.&nbsp; I then went to Lenox&#039;s web site, and found it for the same price and they had it in stock...amazing.&nbsp; Within a day my Grandmother had her gift finally.&nbsp; After they dropped the ball on that and the rude customer service I said never again.

				i tracked something once or twice and it also mentioned the A1 thing.&nbsp; Both times turned out to be delivered by the post office.&nbsp; If I were you, I would just wait a little longer as stuff does usually show.&nbsp; <br /><br />I live in the Ditmars area and I find the postal guys to be pretty crap overall.&nbsp; If they tried to deliver and you weren&#039;t home, they probably just failed to leave a notice.&nbsp; Eventually they will and then you can just pick it up at the post office, or they&#039;ll just leave the package on your stoop (if possible).&nbsp; Both have happened to me.&nbsp; <br /><br />I love amazon.&nbsp; overall i find them pretty reliable.&nbsp; if the package does go missing just contact amazon.&nbsp; they&#039;ll resend the package without issue.&nbsp; then if the original does show, just refuse delivery.

				Have you been able to speak to a real live human being at Amazon, in order to find out what happened?

				My co-worker ordered a XBox for her husband through Amazon three weeks before Christmas and was promised it would be here by December 22nd. It still hasn&#039;t arrived. Amazon refused to give her a refund and she&#039;s been forced to go to her bank to get her money back. Now, it didn&#039;t happen to me, so I don&#039;t know the specifics, but I have heard of people having really really miserable times getting their stuff or money back from Amazon.

				Wow I am shocked to hear all these stories about problems with Amazon&#039;s delivery. I order from them all the time and have never encountered any sort of problem what so ever. I do however ship everything to my office instead of my apartment to avoid missing any deliveries. I have had problems with other companies in the past trying to deliver stuff to my apartment when I am not home. <br /><br />McDirk I hope you get your shipment soon. Good luck and let us know how it turns out.

				you might have mentioned this already, but have you done the online tracking via amazon recently?<br /><br />also, i&#039;ve found that amazon has pretty decent customer service if you want to speak to someone.&nbsp; just find the link on the site and go through the steps.&nbsp; you enter your phone number online and then the phone will ring with a customer person (how do they do that?!).&nbsp; but like dealing with any customer service person, keep your fingers crossed that you end up with a good one.&nbsp; it can be a little hit or miss dealing with an actual person, but as a company policy, i think they&#039;ll fix it for you so that you&#039;re satisfied.<br /><br />i love amazon...they&#039;re the best online company out there, i think.

My coworker, mentioned above had spent a week demanding a refund from Amazon, since they never received the XBox, but didn&#039;t actually get it until she went to her bank. The bank denied the charges and refunded the money, but Amazon refused to do so.
