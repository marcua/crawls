				I nominate our very own <strong>Mr. Abusive Dangerous Homeless Guy</strong> (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=8330.0) who helped get out a lot of pos/neg nods lately. If he&#039;s ineligible due to no fixed address, unavailability, or (as I suspect) he&#039;s actually from Bayside, then I&#039;ll have to go with Chuck Norris.<br /><br />&nbsp;:-D

				You can&#039;t nominate Chuck Norris because he&#039;s already won everything.

				Before you start casting your votes, I&#039;d just like everyone to know that after I moved to Astoria, the New York City crime rate dropped to its lowest point in... like... a really long time.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sure, it could just be a coincidence, but it&#039;s probably not.&nbsp; Vote for me.
