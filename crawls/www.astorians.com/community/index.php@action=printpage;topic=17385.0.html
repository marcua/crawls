				March 2nd @ 7:00pm<br />Joe&#039;s Pub<br />425 Lafayette St.<br />Get tickets HERE (http://&quot;http://tickets.publictheater.org/calendar/view.asp?id=12016&quot;)<br /><br />w/ special guest Greg Holden<br /><br />(http://www.joespub.com/images/artists/2135/photos/small/Ian%20Axel%20purp.JPG)<br /><br />New York based singer/songwriter Ian Axel rings in 2010 with his first full length album, This Is The New Year. Released January 5, the 13-track collection is a follow up to Axel’s critically-acclaimed debut EP I’m On To You. <br /><br />Music supervisors have fallen in love with Ian&#039;s songs, placing his music in episodes of MTV’s “The Real World” (Brooklyn, Hollywood, and DC), “The Hills,” and ABC&#039;s “Private Practice.”&nbsp; In 2009, Apple included his songs &quot;Afterglow&quot; and &quot;We Are&quot; on the playlists of over 250 Apple Stores worldwide and invited him to perform at over 20 retail stores around the country!<br /><br />This is the New Year was recorded in Spring of 2009 by Dan Romer, who has also helmed sessions with indie-poppers Ingrid Michaelson and Jenny Owen Youngs.&nbsp; Through tight and melodic songcraft, Ian captures the wonder of our earlier years.&nbsp; He says, &quot;I always feel like I&#039;m trying to reconnect with something I had when I was a kid.&nbsp; Children have a glow and an energy we seem to lose later.&quot;<br /><br />An album of beginnings, This is the New Year taps into that innocence. With Ian Axel in your headphones, it is almost impossible not to feel some part of you beaming, embracing the open future that stretches ahead.&nbsp; Your fresh decade starts now, and this is its soundtrack.
