				Ok. I&#39;ll&nbsp; bite as I&nbsp; don&#39;t think I&nbsp; ever posted an intro to myself at the old OUT Astoria site.<br /><br />I moved to Astoria from Kyoto in August with my partner, who will be returning to the U.S. at the end of November. I&#39;m still getting used to the neighborhood (and the rest of New York), but am thrilled that the Family Market is on Broadway and am loving the local restaurants. <br /><br />I&#39;m originally from California (and am a very proud banana slug), but have lived in Ithaca; Bloomington, Indiana; and Japan for lengthy periods as well.

				I think I posted this back at the old OutAstoria site, but I could be wrong.<br /><br />I&#39;m Dirk, a 13 year resident of Astoria (over 15 in NYC now) and am a transplant from the South.&nbsp; I live at 34th and Broadway with two wonderful, but difficult cats.&nbsp; My interests include local politics (I&#39;m the President of the Stonewall Democratic Club of NYC, the citywide LGBT Democratic organization - sdnyc.org), science fiction and fantasy books, cooking, indie music and my boyfriend has recently gotten me addicted to Project Runway.&nbsp; I&#39;m pretty active locally as a Board Member of the Powhatan Regular Democratic Club, a member of Trinity Lutheran Church (up on 31st Avenue at 37th Street) and in Astoria Kiwanis.

				Hi Guys,<br /><br />I am new here and I posted this on the old board before it went under. In reading this thread so far, I think I have all of you beat as far as how long I&#39;ve lived in Astoria. <br /><br />I have been an Astorian for 22 years. (Since I was five years old)- cool, huh?<br /><br />Anyway, my name is Valentine and I work in a bookstore in the city and I have lived in NYC pretty much my entire life. <br /><br />I guess I joined to network with some Gay Astorians and it sounded like fun. <br /><br />I am on myspace as well under hoffsteele.

				Ok folks here goes...I&#39;m a native New Yorker, born and raised. I lived in Boston for 5 years and came back in fall of 2004. I&#39;m now looking to move into fabulous Astoria. I actually remember that neighborhood from when I was a kid, pre-gay days. I live in Elmhurst and I&#39;m play soccer for the NY Ramblers and am active in the LGBT community working with a gay rights political group. <br /><br />Professionally I am an attorney and I&#39;m counting down the months till my big 3-0. Anyway, that&#39;s a little glimpse, say if you like and I look forward to hearing from some of you guys. <br /><br />I&#39;m looking for an apt, so any advice or leads would be much appreciated. <br /><br />Ken

				Wait, are there no lesbians in all of Astoria? How odd. I could swear that I see gaggles of &#39;em waiting for the N train on any given morning. Could my gaydar be that off?&nbsp; :wink:<br /><br />And I think I&#39;ve got everyone beat as to time living in Astoria -- born here 37 years ago, though I lived in Manhattan while in graduate school and law school (and Chicago for a summer). <br /><br />So here&#39;s a question for you folks -- what&#39;s your take on Astoria gay PDA? We&#39;re talking minimal PDA, like hand holding. My girlfriend and I bicker about this -- we&#39;re both out, so that&#39;s not the issue, but I do worry about being harassed and there are other places in the city (i.e., Brooklyn Heights/Park Slope) that I feel more comfortable with the PDA than I do in Astoria. She thinks I&#39;m crazy.<br /><br />Thoughts?

				Hello, <br />My names Kelly, been in Astoria 1 yr this month, lived in Forest Hills 1 yr-orig from Boston.<br />I mived here to be a Flight Attendant for JetBlue Airways. I have a few friends here in the hood but don&#39;t have nearly enough friends here :O(<br />Its tough because being an FA most of my acquaintances/friends are from all over the country-not Astoria. I actually chose to live and dtay here-I love it. So, I get bored but try to be productive-I walk alot since i&#39;m conveniently located at Ditmars &amp; 38th. I love the arts, writing, going for coffee. I&#39;m thinking of checking out this place someone posted called&nbsp; Womens Studio Center--has art classes (painting, writing, pottery) etc...<br />I&#39;d love to meet some new people and if anyone has any suggestions I&#39;d love you forever.<br />Anyone involved in anything like this? <br />Happy Holidays to everyone&nbsp; :-)

				Hey thanks for the welcome ... :-D<br />I am looking for people more so in the Astoria area. I know a few people in the city but most that I know are hard to get together with because of the job. I do mostly redeyes so i&#39;m around more so in the day and have days off more often during the week. <br />I am sort of looking for other options as far as work goes too...i&#39;m a bit bored. I like it but I don&#39;t feel like its what i should be doing in the long run.<br />tough decision to make as far as that goes too. I feel like if i had a more ...grounded job (no pun intended) i&#39;d meet more people and actually be able to be more social.<br />I have a background in the Caribbean travel industry and psychology..and now this. I&#39;d like to get involved in maybe teaching/writing/english/history.. or something to do with the arts. I would like to be involved in something that will make a differance...bring people together maybe. <br />Anyway....yeah....people in the area would be ideal. <br />Thanks for asking, you guys all seem cool on here.

				Kelly, <br /><br />It seems that you wanna teach potentially, maybe you should look into the NYC Fellowship for Teachers, they pay for your masters and then you get to teach in the NYC public schools. Now I totally know what your initial reaction is, NYC PUBLIC SCHOOLS :?...BUT, the benefits are good and the&nbsp; salary at first is eh, but gets much better with time. And then you may be able to use the things you know, Carribbean travel, psychology, etc to teach. Think about it. I&#39;m not using my degree in what I do lol, and hell I think I&#39;m gonna be very happy. <br /><br />Ken

				Hey Ken,<br />Thanks for the suggestion.

If I have a nine to fiver i&#39;d reconsider---or just something that would allow me to have a more appropriate schedule to attend school.

				Hi,<br /><br />I just joined this site. I&#39;ll be the third lesbian to introduce myself. I&#39;m a writer who just moved to Astoria a few months ago after years in Manhattan. I love it here. I was disappointed to see so few women posting but that seems to be the case in most venues--the guys are way more active and &quot;out there&quot;. Hope more women will join and post.

				Hi Fellow Gay Astorians:-),<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have been on Astorians for quite some time now and just today said hello in the &quot;hello&quot; thread, therefore I figured I would alter my blurb a little and post it on the out thread as well.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My name is Vincent (however I usually go by Vinny or Vin) and I have lived in Astoria for four years now with my partner Andy, of six years. We live off of 31st Ave. and are in love with the area! <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I enjoy this board tons and I am sooo glad I found it (by accident, was searching for a place to eat in Astoria (hence the the screen name) and low and behold, my new home away from home, lol). <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Some of my interests involve cooking, anything to do with food, eating at great restaurants, going out dancin, dancin, dancin to great music (I am a club kid in a 30 year old body). I enjoy meeting new people, sharing great times with old friends, reading this board and the occasional book, lol and watching food TV. I work full time and attend school part time, working towards a degree in Nursing. I think that is enough rambling for now, so hello.

				Grew up on 37th Street (right across the street from Most Precious Blood - took my first communion there).<br /><br />Used to go there during summer break, at that time it was FREE, you could go to the gym and they had tables set up to do different things and they used to keep the play area open outside and the kids played street hockey...those were the days (mid 60&#39;s - early 70&#39;s).<br /><br />The moved to Florida in 1973 (hated it).<br /><br />And in 2000 the new Millinium...blew me back to Astoria and I&#39;ve been here ever since (will be 7 years in May).<br /><br />Will I ever leave Astoria...I never left Astoria, even when I didn&#39;t live here. (Awwwwwwwww)<br /><br />Since coming back I lived for 5 years around 30th Ave. and 14th Street (WOW THAT AREA CHANGED!&nbsp; I remember the Italian Festival on 14th Street -- that&#39;s long gone).<br /><br />For the past couple of years I&#39;ve been living on Ditmars right by the park. <br /><br />I will say one thing, Astoria has changed.&nbsp; I do miss the way it was, it was like living in a small village/town.&nbsp; People used to sit on their doorsteps during the summer, everyone knew everyone.&nbsp; All the parents watched out for everyone&#39;s kids.<br /><br />It&#39;s still a great place to live but those of you that were around way back when...you know what I&#39;m talking about&nbsp; :wink:

				Hey everyone...<br /><br />I found this website by accident and it seems very informative and fun.&nbsp; I have been in Astoria now for a little over a year and really like it here.&nbsp; Hope to be going to Bungalow this Wednesday for beer! and meeting some of you guys.&nbsp; I work and go to school in the city, so am mostly tired and as some of you will probably find out, I&#039;m a bit of a loner due to the amount of stimuli I receive from working in the city.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather go back to my apartment with a book, listen to music or just kinda lay there quiet than go out, but I&#039;ll put my anti-socialistic personality aside and have some beer at bungalow soon.&nbsp; Oh and I really dig music like Arcade Fire, the Shins, Iron and Wine, Fiona Apple, etc...&nbsp; later astoria gators.

				Chello OUT Astoria.<br /><br />mcdirk and stephaniel used their wiley charms to lure me over from the general introduction thread... so I&#039;ll reintroduce myself here. As far as my LGBT-related intro goes: I&#039;ve been out as bi since I was about 18. I&#039;ve been in serious, long-term relationships with both men and women and am currently single.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m fairly committed (there&#039;s always more that can be done) to LGBT rights and issues - particularly in the legal realm (simply because that&#039;s what I&#039;m studying). Just as an example - I&#039;ve recently found myself embroiled in the midst of a heated debate about the FDA&#039;s policy which restricts blood donation from men who have had sex with men (and women who have sex with those men). The question is whether having a blood drive on our lawschool campus would be a violation of the our human rights policy which forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. <br /><br />As far as being the B in LGBT, I&#039;m well practiced in explaining my sexuality to both straights/queers who stereotype bisexuals as indecisive, selfish and unfaithful. I&#039;m almost always happy to engage in the friendly debate on the topic. I sometimes find myself (don&#039;t all LGBT people to some extent?) as somewhat of a (hesitant) ambassador for being bi.&nbsp; I end up just trying to explain -my- own particular experience and feelings and try to explain that I&#039;m not trying to prove that all bi people are like me but that the danger lies in making presumptions about people&#039;s attitudes and behaviors on the basis of their sexuality. <br /><br />The length of this introduction/mini-rant prolly demonstrates that I&#039;m procrastinating from studying for my finals again. Back to it!<br />-Ericka<br /><br />(posted on the general introductions thread)<br />-------------------------------------------<br />I&#039;ve been a meek-lurker on astorians for a little while and am semi-new to Astoria. I live on Crescent near the Tri and have been here since fall of 2005. I used to be a professional geek (doing webmistressy stuff and unixwork), but now I have amateur status as I&#039;m in my second year of law school. I like violent videogames and highly unrealistic media (read: movies/tv with superheroes and/or robots). I&#039;m not a musician, but I am a fan (Flaming Lips and Cibo Matto top the list) and would be making mixcds and attending concerts much more if it weren&#039;t for this bloody homework.<br /><br />What else? I&#039;m a single, bisexual, civil libertarian girl who is fast discovering that writing this kind of general introduction sounds a heck of a lot like writing a dating site profile. That was really not my intent! (Unless you&#039;re clever and cute.).<br /><br />Nice to &quot;meet&quot; you all!

				Hey everyone!<br /><br />I&#039;m new to Astoria (moved to 24th ave/27th st a month ago) and i LOVE it!<br /><br />I moved to NYC two years ago from Arkansas and I haven&#039;t looked back.<br /><br />The boyfriend lives way down in Brooklyn so we don&#039;t spend as much time together as I&#039;d like.<br /><br />...so, I need local Astorian friends to pal around with.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m nuts with history and dining out. I&#039;d love to make one of those dinner-events that I&#039;ve read about on Outastoria.com.<br /><br />I&#039;m political (and frustrated with the country at the moment) but NYC is the best place in the country to live IMHO. I adore NYC and I&#039;ve also just became a volunteer guide with Big Apple Greeter. Google &#039;em :)<br /><br />I live next to the Beer Garden and down the street from the Albatross.

				Hi everyone.&nbsp; I&#039;m new to the board but I&#039;ve been in Astoria for about 2.5 years now.&nbsp; I just heard about OutAstoria and I&#039;m glad there is a message board.<br /><br />I guess I&#039;m here because I have trouble meeting gay men (for both friendships AND dating).&nbsp; I don&#039;t know why, but I get really nervous around men, esp. gay men.&nbsp; I&#039;m usually pretty out-going, friendly, extroverted and fun.&nbsp; The idea of going to one of the OutAstoria dinners/brunches sounds like a lot of fun, but it also terrifies the hell out of me.&nbsp; So I guess it is good that there is a message board where I can get to know some of you all first, because I need more gay friends.&nbsp; No offense to the straight women of the world, but they just aren&#039;t enough.<br /><br />A little about me?&nbsp; I&#039;m a book editor, an admitted workaholic, a netflix addict and like most people in NYC, I can be found with my MP3 player permanently attached to my ears.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a huge fan of bars and clubs (too dark, too loud, too shallow) and I&#039;m not a big drinker (I know, what kind of gay man am I?) so I haven&#039;t met many gay men.&nbsp; Most of my interactions with the gay community are with people who are only looking to hookup or a few one-time conversations where I wasn&#039;t sure what to say.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking at this place as somewhere I can be myself, where I can get to know some friendly people and eventually work up the nerve to come to one of the dinners once I&#039;m ready to meet those friendly people face to face.&nbsp; And hey, maybe I&#039;ll find a few people who understand the nervousness.

				Hey guys. I just moved here (literally 2 days ago) from Memphis. I&#039;m originally from Birmingham, Alabama. I just graduated college and am here because, well, it&#039;s New York City and I love it. And Astoria is affordable and a really great community from what I&#039;ve seen so far. I&#039;m living with my friend from college on 45th street. I didn&#039;t even know that there was a gay organization in Astoria, but I&#039;m glad I stumbled upon it.

				Well hello there.&nbsp; I was looking for info about any pride festivities happening in Astoria and came across this website!&nbsp; Hello to all.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)&nbsp; I have lived in Astoria since January of &#039;06 - so about a year and a half now (although I was out of town for 4 months last year) and I LOVE IT!!!!!!!&nbsp; I&#039;ve only lived in NYC for one month longer than I&#039;ve been in Astoria (I moved here from Chicago where I had been for 7 years).&nbsp; After staying with a friend in Hell&#039;s Kitchen for a month, I immediately gravitated towards Astoria.&nbsp; It&#039;s just how I like things - close enough but far enough away as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br />I do all sorts of things.&nbsp; I&#039;m pursuing an acting career, I am a certified yoga instructor and I work with dogs (walking, pet sitting).&nbsp; I love doing all three and they sort of come and go in my life.&nbsp; Currently the acting/dog thing is happening.<br /><br />Don&#039;t know what else to say.&nbsp; I still only know a handful of people in New York so it&#039;s always nice to get out and meet new people/make new friends.&nbsp; Don&#039;t get out a lot as I am extremely poor currently but now that the weather has been nice, I&#039;ve been at least getting out for walks all over Astoria.&nbsp; Have been from Ditmars to 36th ave and 19th st to 48th.&nbsp; That&#039;s about my limit for now but as the summer progresses who knows how far I&#039;ll walk!<br /><br />I guess that&#039;s it.&nbsp; I&#039;m off to explore other areas of the board!&nbsp; Enjoy your weekend everyone!!!!!! :evil:<br /><br />

				Hi everybody--<br />Have lived in Astoria for, oh, about five years now I guess (time flies, as does my memory), and have posted only a very little elsewhere on the Astorians board. My partner first moved here from Forest Hills, and it didn&#039;t take me long to follow; actually, I&#039;d lived in Astoria about a dozen years ago, for not-very-long. I work in publishing (where I&#039;ve also been known to spend time gossiping on Datalounge), but spend my real time on art and jewelry. And reading. And music. (My bf would probably add &quot;and shopping&quot; to that.) Don&#039;t really know anyone in the neighborhood right now, and that wouldn&#039;t be a bad thing to change, so I&#039;ll keep an eye out for any upcoming events. <br /><br />Anyway, happy Pride Day this weekend, and be well.

				Hi, kids!&nbsp; Just found this board!&nbsp; My husband and I were married a couple of years ago in Toronto (http://marryus.org).&nbsp; We&#039;ve been together about four years.&nbsp; He&#039;s in publishing and I&#039;m a legal secretary (actor, singer, waiter, writer, stitcher, mover).&nbsp; We&#039;re Ditmars kids down toward the Park.&nbsp; Have lived here about three years now, moved next door to one of my best mates of 10 years who&#039;s ALSO in publishing and also gay, but single.&nbsp; We&#039;re really home-bodies, love Bollywood movies, have lots of friends who are actors and comedians and we go to church at St. Luke in the Fields in The Village (for ever).&nbsp; Totally accepting Espiscopal Church, female rector and the vicar is a lesbian mother of two who&#039;s been married to her wife for 10 years.<br /><br />To address a previous post, there&#039;s a GORJUS and accepting Presbyterian church in the City (i know, wouldn&#039;t it be great to have something in the NEIGHBOURHOOD, tho?) http://www.fpcnyc.org -- 5th Avenue @ 12th Street. The Senior Pastor is a SWEETheart.&nbsp; The Worship services are held every Sunday at 11:00 AM.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s SO FUNNY to hear the ladies talk about PDA!&nbsp; We don&#039;t, really, we&#039;re a bit reluctant ...&nbsp; I&#039;m from farmland in way southern Maryland by the Eastern Shore, been out forever and up here since &#039;82, and my husband is from Jersey and went to a Jesuit High School in the City, so it&#039;s not like we&#039;re shy or new to The Life ... but it just seems weird.&nbsp; To look at us we look absolutely to type for 45 year old bears and I KNOW everyone in the neighborhood knows we&#039;re married.&nbsp; In the last year, though, we&#039;ve see two or three different couples of womyn walking down Ditmars holding hands and we&#039;re like DAMMIT ! let&#039;s DO IT !&nbsp; :-) and if we&#039;ve had some beers, late at night, we WILL ... so ... baby steps and thanks for the courageous example, ladies!&nbsp; We&#039;ve noticed in the years we&#039;ve been here what we PRESUME to be a nice and growing gay presence and I could not be more pleased living where we do.&nbsp; Can&#039;t wait to put our name in for the Dinner emails!&nbsp; Sounds very very exciting.&nbsp; <br /><br />Blessings to us all and I&#039;m sure we see each other around soon!&nbsp; <br />(Maybe we could all wear descrete little badges, OA, for OUT ASTORIA !)

				Hi, Everyone. I am new to this board but not to Astoria. I hail originally from Michigan, that Midwestern bastion of creative people <strong><em>who later flee</em></strong>, e.g. Madonna, Lily Tomlin, Robin Williams, Sandra Bernhard, Jack White...&nbsp; <br />Nowadays I consider myself a New Yorker without the accent, and have lived in Astoria for 20 years, (but have only been out for 1-1/2)! All I can say is I am currently loving life and have never been happier.&nbsp; I do live concert production work for a living, and summer is a very busy time for me, but I do like to balance the long hours of work with a healthy social life.&nbsp; I think this board is great, I can&#039;t believe I didn&#039;t find it until recently.&nbsp; You&#039;ll most likely see me cruising around the neighborhood on my trusty Canondale.&nbsp; I hope to meet some of you sooner rather than later, and wish you all a great Summer!&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br />

				Hello All,<br />My name is Bill and I moved to Astoria a year ago February from Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. (Delaware is a state south of here, it is not where the Water Gap is located! :wink: ). I am a retired college instructor in my 50&#039;s (I can still say that for a little while longer.) I am currently volunteering with immigrant issues and animal rescue. I travel a lot, particularly to Mexico.<br /><br />My boyfriend Luis, who is 29, is from Veracruz, Mexico. He moved in with me in June and despite living in a small one bedroom / one bathroom apartment, we are still getting along really well. We hope to spend next winter in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.<br /><br />We would really like to meet other gay Astorians. Right now we schlep into Manhattan to socialize with other gays. I&#039;m very glad to have stumbled on this board. We look forward to making new friends here.

				Hey everybody, I&#039;m Josh. I live in LIC with my partner David and we&#039;re hopefully moving up to Astoria sometime in the next couple months.&nbsp; We&#039;re 32/28. I&#039;m an artist/designer and he&#039;s a teacher. We&#039;re into scifi, video games, art, comics, indie rock, theater, travel, and general good times.

				Hello... I just moved to Astoria a little over a month ago and now I live right off of Ditmars.&nbsp; My name is Bridget, I&#039;m 24 and I&#039;m from CT.&nbsp; I&#039;m an aspiring actress, though I haven&#039;t acted in anything in NY yet.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done a lot of work in CT and was in my friends&#039; independent film this year.&nbsp; To pay the bills, however, I work at the Apple Store on Fifth Ave.&nbsp; I&#039;m extremely passionate about the environment and sustainability, and I also love biking and am slightly obsessed with movies.&nbsp; <br />I keep reading about brunches and get-togethers that OUT Astoria sponsors and I would love to get involved and maybe meet some people.&nbsp; I only really know my roommate in Astoria, so I&#039;ve been kind of lonely since i moved here.&nbsp; So, I guess, that was my introduction...

Not that I would ever expect to be swarmed with offers for an alternative.<br /><br />Got on here tonight hoping to find contact info for Robert and see if he&#039;d join me for dinner. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s possible, But I don&#039;t know where to even start. <br /><br />So if by some odd chance someone reads this on Saturday, December 20, 2008 and wants to join me for dinner later, my number is 917-363-7044<br /><br />Shaun<br />

				Hey folks!<br />I&#039;m Jesse and I&#039;m making a shout out to all registered voters!&nbsp; It&#039;s super important that the entire LGBT and Allied Community gets out and votes on Tuesday, Nov 3rd.&nbsp; We&#039;ve got a choice between the incumbent (Vallone) who is AGAINST gay marriage and the Green Party challenger, Lynne Serpe, who is a major advocate of marriage equality and civil/human rights.&nbsp; Check out SerpeforCouncil.com and vote for Lynne this Tuesday!&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				Hello. My name is Justine. I&#039;ll be moving to Astoria next month. WooHoo! I&#039;m 20 years old and go to Marymount Manhattan. I&#039;m bisexual, and am completely out to friends and in college, but only out to my Mom as far as family is concerned. I feel like coming out to more of my family, but I really don&#039;t want to have to deal with any problems. Most would be fine...but eh, don&#039;t wanna stir the pot... The biggest resistance I would get would people think I&#039;m &quot;confused&quot; or who &quot;don&#039;t believe in bisexuality&quot;...and I hate that. So I&#039;m avoiding it for now. All in due time. Most people at college assume I&#039;m straight because I have a boyfriend - whom I love more than life itself. (Or even if they don&#039;t know that, they assume I&#039;m straight because its the default assumption&nbsp; :x .) Today in one of my classes, someone was wondering if bisexuals even exist. I didn&#039;t say anything because...well...I didn&#039;t feel like interrupting the lecture, and I&#039;m stupid&nbsp; :|. I need to stop doing that...<br />Anyway, sorry for the slight ramble. I do that&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br />So, hows the LGBT scene in Astoria? And any sliver of a bisexual scene anywhere? (Just asking for that explicitly, because back in my hometown, the LGBT scene consists of some gay bars, that cater mostly to gay men, and there&#039;s some lesbian activity. But no bisexual activity. And Trans...I dunno if people even know what that is back home... I mean, exaggerating, but...maybe not, hm...)<br /><br />Anyway, nice to meet you all :)

				Welcome Justine.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t seen an organized bi community in Astoria, but there is a bar, Albatross, which is very lesbian oriented, though a mixed crowd, and Out Astoria has a few bisexual members who come (you&#039;re always welcome to join us at our events!)

				Hello! Sarah and Ariana here.&nbsp; Although we are not new to Astoria, we are new to the gay community.&nbsp; We live in the Ditmars area and are looking for some LGBT community support. We have two dogs, Moose (a Frenchie) and Annie a (Wheaten) and we&#039;re always open to finding play dates for them. So if you&#039;re in the area with some happy, friendly dogs, let us know! The dog park is unfortunately a little too far away for us.&nbsp; Nice to meet all of you. Looking forward to this forum.<br />S &amp; A<br />&nbsp;:-D

				Hi there. If you are seeking a church home, check out Trinity Lutheran located at 31-18 37th Street in Long Island City/Astoria.&nbsp; Very very welcoming place - I should know - I am gay and will be their pastor come May 9.&nbsp; It truly IS&nbsp; a welcome place and we&nbsp; hope to make it even more so.&nbsp; You will find many kindred spirits there - they love to have fun - and in October we ALWAYS have a blessing of the animals, which we will post info about later in the summer.&nbsp; Services there are on Sundays at 10:30 a.m.<br /><br />Blessings.<br />Pastor Paul B Milholland
