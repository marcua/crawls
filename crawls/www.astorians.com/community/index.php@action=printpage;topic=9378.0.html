				Why not voting for Hilary makes you a sexist, classist pig. Wow. (http://www.alternet.org/reproductivejustice/75970/)<br /><br />I went to find the NOW thread that had been up earlier and couldn&#039;t find it. But holy moley, is this ever frightening stuff.&nbsp; :-o

This is *another* group of similar disposition, apparently.<br /><br />I guess my problem is that when women claim that these races are unfair or what have you because they are women, I think you end up just turning yourself into the victim. It&#039;s one thing when men say that ladies can&#039;t compete on an equal feild--it&#039;s a whole other level of demeaning when I see other women do it to me. I cannot even express how embarrased these kinds of critques make me of my gender.

				Feministing (http://www.feministing.com/) was all over the NOW statement. It was pretty interesting. A couple of days later the NY Times did a little piece on the uproar... <br /><br />The NOW statement was made by one person in the NY State NOW chapter. The National NOW chapter has made a much more sane statement about Obama and rumor has it they were trying to decide whether to force the writer of the Kennedy-bashing statement to retract, but I haven&#039;t heard anything else about it lately so I&#039;m assuming not.<br /><br />As far as the Robin Morgan statement goes, while it doesn&#039;t really speak for me on most points, I don&#039;t see where it says that not voting for Hillary makes anyone a sexist, classist pig. There *is* a lot of stupid nastiness directed towards Hillary (and Obama, too - I got an email from a relative saying that Obama is GASP! MUSLIM!!!!11one!!!!!!). <br /><br />I have yet to hear a man say &quot;George W. Bush [or Bill Clinton] makes me embarrassed to be a man.&quot; Just to put that in the mirror...

				Tee hee. Love the boobs thing. <br /><br />And, enigmacat, I know the NOW release has been largely dissented from by most of the organization. I also think it&#039;s interesting that some of the more sane feminist posts on the internet, by women whose work I admire, have been written to endorse and support Obama.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: From the Article</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Goodbye to some young women eager to win male approval by showing they&#039;re not feminists (at least not the kind who actually threaten thestatus quo), who can&#039;t identify with a woman candidate because she actually is unafraid of eeueweeeu yucky power, who fear their boyfriends might look at them funny if they say something good about her. Goodbye to women of any age again feeling unworthy, sulking &quot;what if she&#039;s not electable?&quot; or &quot;maybe it&#039;s post-feminism and whoooosh we&#039;re already free.&quot; Let a statement by the magnificent Harriet Tubman stand as reply. When asked how she managed to save hundreds of enslaved African Americans via the Underground Railroad during the Civil War, she replied bitterly, &quot;I could have saved thousands -- if only I&#039;d been able to convince them they were slaves.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is what really peeved me about the article. As if my voting in a way she disagrees with makes me eager to win male approval or afraid of my boyfriend&#039;s opinions of my vote. She never once allows for the concept that I <strong>might</strong> just be a bold young woman who can identify with a candidate personally on levels of gender and power struggles without deciding to vote for he. That I wouldn&#039;t make that decision because of her stances on <strong>issues</strong>.<br /><br />This is one young woman who won&#039;t be voting for Hilary, but it&#039;s not because I&#039;m some &quot;slave&quot; and I don&#039;t know it.<br />

				This kind of argument makes it sound like all of the qualities of a president should be in their crotch and chest, which is what I thought feminists were trying to move away from (i.e. &quot;Respect my feminist body!&quot;). Since when did having a vagina make someone qualified to be president? Or having a certain pigment of skin? Bleh. Bleh. And Bleh.

To me, the descriptions of the people that don&#039;t vote for Hilary are so overtly negative that it&#039;s hard not to feel like she&#039;s saying vaguely nasty, intolerant things about those who don&#039;t. I certainly think there&#039;s a very strong implication of being a sexist, though I suppose it is just an implication and not openly stated.
