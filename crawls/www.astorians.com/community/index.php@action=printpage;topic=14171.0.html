				I was posting in the &quot;closed hospitals&quot; thread when somebody asked this question, and set me off on a rant. As Cannibal mentioned in the Dead Banks Walking thread, &quot;de facto nationalization&quot; appears to be the response.<br /><br />Here&#039;s what I&#039;d started posting as my rant:<br /><br />It&#039;s like the fall of the Roman empire, American capitalism going awry. I always thought that when things collapsed, we&#039;d have to become more like a socialist country (Canada, for example......or France.)<br /><br />Sure enough, there&#039;s now talk about having the gov&#039;t step in to take control of the banks and other private companies until they&#039;re stabilized, then re-sold to the public sector. But talk like this is like blasphemy to many &quot;red-blooded&quot; Americans, who have been trumpeting our country&#039;s super-macho, world-power status and proudly-affluent lifestyle.<br /><br />Now that the Obama-madness has settled down, looks like business as usual. He&#039;s all for asking the rest of us to make &quot;sacrifices&quot; for the sake of our fellow citizens, while our taxes go directly to the screwed-up companies that got us into this mess in the first place. <br /><br />The gov&#039;t has turned into something like a parent that keeps buying new cars for the teenager who keeps wrecking them. WE- meaning, those of us who had been scrimping and saving ALL ALONG, never buying into (literally) the concept of consumerism- must now SUFFER so that we can give OUR SAVINGS to those parents!!&nbsp; :x<br /><br />The threat of the bad economy is what enables the gov&#039;t to keep us enslaved; enables our bosses to treat us like CRAP in the name of some &quot;greater good&quot; that is clearly a giant evil. We&#039;re told to trust the good name of America and its values, while the gov&#039;t exploits our national pride and trust.<br /><br />But it&#039;s all so obviously WRONG. <br /><br />Maybe nationalizing things wouldn&#039;t be so bad, even temporarily: Television would become public, and actually educational with fewer commercials (there&#039;s plenty of gov&#039;t propaganda snuck into TV right now, under the guise of &quot;free press&quot;); banks would be trustworthy; college would be somewhat affordable, as would housing and health care; celebrities might even be paid a little less, as income becomes spread a little more evenly......<br /><br />As Colbert said the other night, &quot;Nobody wants to use the &#039;N&#039; word,&quot; but let&#039;s face it: Our country has fallen victim to its own greed, and nobody is enjoying the standard of living they should be due to corruption.
