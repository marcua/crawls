VERY GOOD CREDIT. No Pets<br /><br /><br /><br />Our BUDGET is around $2000 ............<strong><span style="font-size: 1.45em;" class="bbc_size">AND either NO FEE or NO Security Deposit</span></strong> (So if you are a broker and want to work with us, you must get the landlord to agree to waive the sec deposit)<br /><br /><br />MUST HAVES:<br /><br /><br />- 2 TRUE Bedrooms (although the second bedroom could be small as long as it fits at least a desk and a sofa)<br />- Renovated kitchen with updated appliances <br />- plenty of sunlight<br />- near the subway (just a 5 to 10min walk)<br />- Plenty of closet space (preferably a walking closet)<br />- Clean and well maintained unit and building<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />AGAIN either NO BROKER&#039;S FEE or NO Security DEPOSIT.

				I cant even imagine any landlord not having a security fee . Its like having no backup incase there is some damage done to the apt .Plus not expecting or wanting to give security sends a message that damage might be done and im not paying nor giving any backup to the landlord .&nbsp; &nbsp;I have apts i rent and never ever was i asked once to not include security in the rentals since its a normal and typical to do so .So i find this totally strange .&nbsp; But hey good luck .

				Hi,<br />Thanks for your comment (unsolicited and all). That part of the ad if you read carefully will see is more for the broker&#039;s. I am not suggesting we don&#039;t want to give a security deposit. We have been living in Astoria for the past 4 years in the same apt and have a wonderful relationship with our landlord as we have been terrific tenants and he and his office staff have been great. There is no reason for us not to want to give a security deposit as we have always (the last and only three times we have moved since 2003) have gotten it all back.<br />The idea was to alert brokers about our unwillingness to pay a broker&#039;s fee except in an extraordinary circumstance in which there was no security deposit required for example. Landlords can always add a clause to the contract that legally commits tenants to pay for damages anyway. So it shouldn&#039;t be as crazy to find someone that being our references as strong as they are could be willing to negotiate the security deposit with us. Hence, the comment.

				No one is gonna take a reference or someone elses word saying you were a good tenant as far as security goes . As far as the landlord is concerned a security deposit is always&nbsp; needed , just in case .&nbsp; A brokers fee is totally different . You stated the broker has to get the landlord to waive the security fee . As a landlord who deals with many apts in Astoria&nbsp; i would probably never deal with a broker who even mentioned something like that to me since it seems to insane . Sorry if im coming off strong , but you are gonna live in someone elses house and expect no security for the owner ?&nbsp; You know how many people have good credit , end up losing their job and then dont pay for the next 6 months&nbsp; ? It happens all the time .&nbsp; &nbsp;Security at least is there for some protection .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also using a broker will pretty much mean you will pay some fee , it could be half the rent or a full months rent . Bokers dont work for free . What would be the point of them&nbsp; finding you an apt if they dont get paid ?&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; You can try Craigslist and find something from an original owner with no broker . I actually rent all my apts out from there since like yourself most dont want to pay any fees .&nbsp; Security is another story .&nbsp; &nbsp;Plus anyone with half a brain would take the security money up front than writing it in a contract and trying to collect later .&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Sorry but I do work full time and I am way too busy to engage on any debate on the subject matter. I read people&#039;s posts and unless I have the specific response the want ( in this case an apt for rent) I do not comment as I don&#039;t think we are here to judge people&#039;s posts reasoning or alter motives. I expect other members of this respectable community to do the same. So unless you have an apt that would like to offer us for rent. kindly refrain from further commenting please. Thanks so much for your cooperation.
