				We have a very big birthday Astorian coming up next week.<br /><br />The Hell Gate Bridge turns 100 years old on March 9th when it dedicated and opened for rail traffic. Various events are being planned this year to celebrate including an upcoming lecture Jason Antos at QED on 23rd Avenue on Sunday, March 5 from 3:30-5:00pm<br /><br />If anyone is interested:<br />100 Years: Hell Gate Bridge Anniversary Presentation<br />https://qedastoria.com/ (https://qedastoria.com/)<br />https://www.evensi.us/hell-gate-lecture-qed-a-place-to-show-tell/183426339 (https://www.evensi.us/hell-gate-lecture-qed-a-place-to-show-tell/183426339) <br /><br />Here&#039;s a link to a recent NY1 report about the bridge that has some historic photos<br />http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2017/03/1/hell-gate-bridge-centennial.html (http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2017/03/1/hell-gate-bridge-centennial.html)

				I really hate to take away from the celebratory nature of this, which is certainly deserved and exciting for Astoria.&nbsp; But... I will say that I do hope this shines a negative light on Amtrak.&nbsp; It&#039;s a disgrace that this bridge is left to look in such shoddy condition.&nbsp; They&#039;ve refused to paint this bridge or do anything else that might showcase this bridge as a gem of NYC.&nbsp; So here, at this anniversary, the bridge looks decrepit and worn.&nbsp; It&#039;s a shame.&nbsp; What they DID do recently, was to try and make tons of money off people who have maintained property under the bridge.&nbsp; They backed away from that idea after outcry from our neighbors.

Rust was visible on many parts of the bridge and the towers were covered in black grime. Once the bridge was painted the towers were cleaned as well. The paint might have faded but the protective properties paint is known for are still holding up. Cosmetically it may not look pretty but structurally it&#039;s perfect.
