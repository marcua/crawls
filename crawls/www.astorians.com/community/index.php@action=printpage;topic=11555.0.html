				I gotta say that this is the most hysterical topic I have read in a long time, and it&#039;s a good thing. Actually it&#039;s a pretty kewl idea, different for sure, but unique and you&#039;ll be sure that no one else has even thought of doing it. And being crazy isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing you know.

				BTW plank I haven&#039;t heard anyone call television &quot;the idiot box&quot; since my dad did ( he actually still does even though he watches more than I) when I was a kid. He also called it &quot;the boob tube&quot; because it of all the boobs(idiots) on it.
