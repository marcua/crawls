				Come check it out…&nbsp; 8-)<br />THE LIC CSA’s <br />(Community Supported Agriculture) <br />First Distribution &amp; Sign Up <br />Wednesday June 2nd&nbsp; 4pm – 7pm <br />At the Jacob A. Riis Neighborhood Settlement House <br />10‐25 41st Avenue&nbsp; Long Island City, NY 11101 <br />&nbsp;<br />YOU CAN SIGN UP RIGHT THERE AND THEN! <br />&nbsp;<br />http://liccsa.wordpress.com <br /><br /><br /><br />The 2010 season will begin on Wednesday June 2 and continue until October 27th so we are sending out this letter to provide some basic information about the CSA and how it works.&nbsp; &nbsp;^-^<br />&nbsp;<br />Our mission is to make inexpensive, fresh, organic, and locally-grown vegetables available to everyone in our community and to support local agriculture. The farmers benefit because we provide a direct guaranteed market for their goods. The community benefits because we get fresh delicious organic, healthy vegetables at a great price!<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Our Farm</strong><br />Our vegetables come from the Farm at Miller’s Crossing, a beautiful 200-acre farm situated in the Hudson Valley of New York. Our farmers’ names are Chris and Kate Cashen. You can find out more about Miller&#039;s Crossing through the following web address http://www.farmatmillerscrossing.com Later in the season we will arrange a farm trip allowing members to visit the farm in person! We will also be hosting Farmer Chris when he comes down to Long Island City for our annual Meet and Greet event on May 22nd. We encourage everyone to attend -- meet the farmer and meet your fellow Long Island City CSA members!&nbsp; We will send out the invitation as soon as we pin down the details.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Extra Items,</strong><br />In response to feedback from last year’s member survey we have decided to try a new fruit farm this year. We are happy to announce that we will be working with Hepworth Farms, in Milton, NY for our fruit share.&nbsp; To find out more about the farm and its owner, Amy Hepworth, follow this link: <br />http://www.mypersonalfarmers.com/hepworthfarms.html . We have attached the application for the fruit share to this email.<br /><br />We are equally pleased to announce that we will be offering products from Lewis Waite Farm. They offer a wide range of locally pastured grass fed meat and poultry and eggs. As well as locally made artisan cheeses, jams, breads and granola. And starting this year they will be offering organic NY state grains and beans. For a full list of the products they offer and to learn more about there farm please click on this link&nbsp; http://www.lewiswaitefarm.com/csa.html&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br />These products are available monthly on a ala cart basis.&nbsp; You will be reminded to place your order 1 week ahead of time and you can pay either by using paypal or with a check brought to the distribution. The distribution will be once a month on Tuesdays at LIC Market&nbsp; we will be sending more details about this as soon as we have it all worked out.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Distribution Day</strong><br />Wednesday, June 2 from 4pm to 7pm will be our first distribution day! Our pick-up location is Jacob Riis Neighborhood Settlement, 10-25 41st Ave, Long Island City, in the Queensbridge houses. Pickups continue each week, at the same time and in the same place, through October pick up a bag of assorted vegetables delivered fresh that morning from the farm. Remember, this is not a supermarket and grocery bags will not be provided. Please make sure to bring a sturdy bag to carry your share (we recommend a cloth bag with handles or a backpack) as well as some plastic bags for the individual kinds of vegetables you will receive. For your convenience, this year we will have reusable bags with the LICCSA logo for sale and all proceeds will go back into the CSA to help us fund future events.<br />&nbsp;<br />If you are paying for a portion of your share at pickups (using cash or snap) please bring your first payment.&nbsp; A NYCCAH representative will be available to receive your payment.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Subway</strong>:<br />Take the F train to 21st Street Station or the 7, N, or W to Queensboro Plaza<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><strong>Bus</strong>:<br />Take the B61, Q66, Q67, Q69, or Q102 to Queens Plaza<br />Take the Q100 or Q103 to Queensbridge<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Volunteers</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />All CSA members must volunteer at 4 hours during the season. Please visit volunteerspot.com and follow instructions for signing up. While we prefer members use volunteer spot, a sign-up sheet will be also be available on each pickup day and the volunteer coordinator can enter your info into volunteerspot for you. We would like to fill as many&nbsp; volunteer slots as possible on or before the first distribution day. Volunteer activities typically include: setting-up, facilitating and cleaning-up the distribution site on share pick-up days.&nbsp; Volunteer time may also include activities such as outreach, contributing articles and recipes to our newsletter, organizing group activities or serving on the core group. <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Getting Involved</strong>:&nbsp; &nbsp;^-^<br />Please let us know if you would like to get more involved with running the CSA.

These will include a farm trip or two, a potluck dinner, cooking demonstrations and a wine tasting.&nbsp; We will notify members about these events on our website, in our newsletters, signs at distribution and via emails please keep an eye out for these reminders.&nbsp; If you have other ideas for events or if you are interested in fulfilling your volunteer requirements by helping out, please contact the events coordinator and/or volunteer coordinator.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Google Group and Facebook</strong><br />We now have a Google Group and a Facebook group.&nbsp; These are great forums to post ideas and suggestions or to meet members with common interests.<br />http://groups.google.com/group/liccsa/<br /><br />To join the Facebook group just type “LIC CSA” in the Facebook search box.<br />&nbsp;<br />Thanks and See you Soon!<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The Long Island City CSA Core Group :-)<br />&nbsp;<br />
