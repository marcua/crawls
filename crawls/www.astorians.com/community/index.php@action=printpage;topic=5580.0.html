				There&#039;s a store on 28th Ave around 38th St (?) where I purchased some of my bike accessories - thought they seemed pretty knowledgeable, but then - I&#039;m not.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D<br /><br />And another one on 35th Ave just north of Steinway (42nd St maybe?) - can&#039;t vouch for their knowledge, but they&#039;re probably worth checking out.<br /><br />Good luck!

				Andres&#039; Bicycle Repairman store is tailored to competitive cycle, so he&#039;d probably be able to help.&nbsp; He has lots of high-end racing bikes and equipment.&nbsp; Or, if you find a junk bike that needs some love, he can fix it up for you and he does it really inexpensively.&nbsp; It&#039;s on 35th ave on the corner of 41st street.

				Unlike the poster above, I&#039;ve never had problems with the Bike Stop.&nbsp; When it&#039;s riding season, I&#039;m usually in there once every couple weeks for this or that.&nbsp; That said, I&#039;ve never had any major repairs or overhauls.&nbsp; My girlfriend needed a chain replaced, and they did that quickly and inexpensively.&nbsp; <br />If you&#039;re buying a new bike, any good bike shop should be able to fit you properly and should offer free repairs and tune ups for at least a year after purchase.&nbsp; <br />With that in mind, though, the only shop I&#039;ve really dealt with in Astoria is Bike Stop, and have never purchased a bike from them.&nbsp;

				Andres&#039; Bicycle Repairman on 35th ave at 41st is my pick - i first stopped in over winter out of curiousity and they were really nice. for people without bikes, they said they might start rentals for the spring.&nbsp; it&#039;s definitely geared toward competitive cyclists, but that&#039;s good because they seem pretty knowledgable.

				I like Spokesman Cycles on Vernon Blvd and 50th Ave.&nbsp; They are great.&nbsp; I just got a used bike from them.&nbsp; Also, they are going to be at Astoria Park this Saturday, June 16th for the Health and Fitness Fair by the track to do bike safety checks for free. Talk about community minded.. The event is from 10-2pm if you (or anyone else) would like to stop by!<br /><br />Event details at astoriawaterfront.org

				Do you guys have the same reccos for finding descent used bikes?&nbsp; I&#039;d like to get a bike to ride to work with (live in Astoria, work on the UWS).&nbsp; I am a total newbie to the biking world, as I haven&#039;t been on one since I traded in my Mongoose Menace about 10 years ago for a vroom vroom.<br /><br />I&#039;m guessing I&#039;ll need a mountain bike, just to handle the urban jungle, but I really don&#039;t need ANYTHING crazy.&nbsp; I don&#039;t plan on doing any crazy off-road rides or anything like that (at least until I get super proficient, which will be awhile).<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m just looking to get some help on finding a used bike that won&#039;t be a POS, that&#039;ll be a descent bike to ride 13 miles a day with, and not cost me an arm and a leg. By that I mean less than a few hundred bucks, with under $200 being preferred.<br /><br />Thanks.

				I checked out the Kissena Velodrome this weekend, and am intrigued by track bikes now. Yes, I hate the idea of single-gear fixies without brakes and the concept of crashing at speed, BUT I&#039;d rather be on a closed track than the road while doing it.<br /><br />Besides, I can&#039;t afford a good road bike, and a track bike is cheaper. But I&#039;d like to expand my riding technique. Maybe Spokesman or Andre&#039;s has used track bikes?

				Seminole, try spokesman cycles.&nbsp; My girlfriend just got a used Fuji there for $200.&nbsp; They built up a large number for the 5 boro bike tour, rented them for the day, and they just didn&#039;t have the space for all the bikes.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what they&#039;ve got left, but it was a great deal, and she totally loves the bike (so much so that we just rode down to the Red Hook ball fields from Astoria on Sunday).
