				<br />http://www.independentpoliticalreport.com/2010/06/bill-in-new-york-state-senate-to-expand-ballot-access/<br /><br />a few interesting comments<br /><br />and BAN has a suggested article regarding possible NY nonpartisan elections<br /><br />http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2010/06/02/will-nonpartisan-elections-make-for-dumber-voters/<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />Schleicher, who teaches at George Mason University Law School, is no fan of the status quo. “The current system of local elections is a disaster,” he says of New York City. “But nonpartisan elections take a bad situation and make it worse. In general, nonpartisan elections are a terrible idea.”<br /><br />In his study of partisan competition in municipal races, which was published in 2007, Schleicher compared the few remaining partisan election cities like New York and Philadelphia with the rest of the country. About 75% of American cities have embraced nonpartisan voting, he says.<br /><br />There is a paradox in his findings. The issues that dominate national party politics often have little relevance at the city level, which makes partisan labels a poor indicator for a candidate’s policy positions. “Finding out what party a candidate for Congress belongs to tell you almost everything about her,” he says. “But finding out the same information about a candidate in a local election tells you very little.”<br /><br />Yet in cities with nonpartisan voting systems, where party affiliations are kept off the ballots, citizens enter the voting booth with no information. A candidate’s national party loyalty may tell you little about his or her views on city issues, Schleicher argues, but it’s better than no information at all.<br /><br />Nonpartisan elections “take a situation where you know where little and reduces it to zero,” he says. “All evidence shows that voters in nonpartisan election behave as if they have no idea what’s going on and they turn out in far smaller numbers.”<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				<br />I dont think there will be any reason for me to vote Sept 14.

				<br />It will be interesting when it comes time to trying the new voting machines. Looking over both sides of the ballot, marking smartly, and being certain before casting the ballot.<br /><br />For NYC, the charter proposals were given a fair deal of consideration.<br /><br />* Proposal looks to return term limits from 3 back to 2 terms. I wish it would have a more immediate effect, but it gives voters yet another say which is important. But after the last city election, I will not personally be voting on this proposal. [Though I would have liked voters to turn out incumbents]<br />Maybe in the end the city council will have it as they preferred.<br /><br />* The other proposals are a grab bag of reforms. Wish I knew if there were any special costs, but they all have strong commission support.<br />I expect simply to vote for Yes on 2 and see what effects they may have.<br /><br /><br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/charter/html/home/home.shtml<br /><br />[and for a detailed pdf on how the charter changes would read&nbsp; http://www.nyc.gov/html/charter/downloads/pdf/legislative_text_for_ballot_questions.pdf<br />&nbsp;]

				Debates that Id like to see:<br /><br />http://wnyt.com/article/stories/S1769604.shtml?cat=300<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><strong>ALBANY - Green Party candidate Howie Hawkins and Libertarian designee Warren Redlich want to be included in any gubernatorial debates.</strong><br />Hawkins outlined major planks of his platform while addressing Capitol reporters Thursday.<br /><br />&quot;Making the rich pull their weight in our society by paying their fair share of taxes like the stock transfer tax. I&#039;m for a single payer health care system. I&#039;m for fully funded schools and for, instead of hydrofracking, using natural gas as the next fuel going to a renewable system that&#039;s carbon-free,&quot; he said.<br /><br />Redlich says the problem is the people aren&#039;t happy with both the Republican and Democratic parties.<br /><br />&quot;We were supposed to have hope and change and this and that and the Republican and Democratic parties have failed the people of the United States and the people of New York,&quot; Redlich said.<br /><br />Hawkins and Redlich, along with former madam Kristen Davis and a couple of other people you&#039;ve probably never heard of, will be on the November ballot for governor. If all of them were invited to debate and accepted, it would mean each candidate gets about seven minutes in a hour long format.<br /><br />&quot;Andrew Cuomo is totally in bed with the special interests,&quot; said Redlich. &quot;Carl Paladino cuts out the middle man. He&#039;s his own special interest and if you want politics free of special interests, you need to have candidates who aren&#039;t tied to them.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;We can&#039;t expect to do it in one election,&quot; said Hawkins. &quot;What we&#039;re saying is level the playing field. Make it a fair market without unfair trade practices like excluding us from debates. &quot;<br /><br /><strong>NewsChannel 13 is among the media organizations trying to set up debates among the candidates for governor. Invitees and format are under discussion. Carl Paladino has indicated a willingness to participate. WNYT Vice President and General Manager Steve Baboulis says the station is still waiting to hear from Andrew Cuomo.</strong><br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
