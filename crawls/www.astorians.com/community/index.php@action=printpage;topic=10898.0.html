				I have a story to tell you but first I have to let you know that we have another reading coming up. Yeah, yeah, yeah...<br /><br />Here&#039;s what happened last time:<br /><br />So, Song, from Waltz-Astoria, came up with the brilliant idea of having a pre-party before the reading. The sequence of images I have of going drink for drink with everyone before I had to host this thing sends tremors of horror and delight through my exposed nerves. Before the event, Joe and I had our own private debate of what to read because some of our stuff is...well, it&#039;s not for the weak-hearted. We like to get tough with words and puff out our expressions like we were writing bad obituaries for past sexual experiences or even worse - the mistaken identity of certain appendages. In other words - just another day in the bright and sunny world of The Whiskey Dregs. What began for me as a body full of loose nerves dealing combat to my confidence ended as one of the best experiences I&#039;ve ever had. It was incredibly fun and...some parts of the night are just lost in the wind tunnel of memory.<br /><br /><div align="center"><div align="center">A Night With The Whiskey Dregs<br /><br />a one night stand<br /><br />Hosted by Carlos Detres (me)<br /><br />(The best Poetry/Short Story Night in Astoria. We win by default because no one else is doing one in our side of town)<br /><br />One night stands are fun and so are we. Come join us for this one nighter with the writers of The Whiskey Dregs at WALTZ-ASTORIA on June 26. Get festive with Astoria&#039;s most controversial writers during the pre-party at 8PM. WALTZ-ASTORIA has a great selection of beer and wine and their sangria is a good ride down the throat too. Joe Zito will also be blessing us with acoustic covers of Misfits songs. New writers, new friends - meet them and expand your circle.<br /><br />Make sure to sign up for our limited open mic during the pre-party.<br /><br />A Night With The Whiskey Dregs<br />www.whiskeydregs.wordpress.com<br />Thursday June 26, 2008<br />8PM-11PM<br /><br />WALTZ-ASTORIA<br />www.waltz-astoria.com<br />23-14 Ditmars Boulevard<br />Astoria, NY<br />N or W train to Ditmars Boulevard<br />15 minutes from the<br />The event is FREE<br />Pre-Party and open mic signup at 8PM<br />Readings are from 9-11<br />Make sure to sign up for our limited open mic during the pre-party.<br /><br />Mundo Rivera just got another one of his poems published in the Acentos Review.
