				I have been summoned to jury duty tomorrow.&nbsp; I can&#039;t find anything on the website about what you&#039;re allowed to bring with you (eg. laptop, blackberry, etc).&nbsp; What can/should I bring, or what should I definitely NOT bring?<br /><br />Thanks in advance.

				I went a couple year&#039;s back to Queens Civil in Jamaica.&nbsp; I brought along my Blackberry without any problems.&nbsp; I don&#039;t recall people having laptops.&nbsp; The courts did have computers with Internet access in the large waiting area that jurors could use.&nbsp; I would suggest bringing along something to read, as it can be a long day.&nbsp; Good luck!

				I was assigned to the courthouse in Jamaica about a month ago.&nbsp; You can bring a laptop and they do have wifi.&nbsp; Be prepared to close it up on a moment&#039;s notice if they call your name.&nbsp; I sat there for one full day and then the next day they called my name.&nbsp; &nbsp;I served two days and then they let me go home.<br /><br />There is an area where you are allowed to use your phone but it&#039;s not in the main area.&nbsp; If you use your laptop while the cop is talking, he may yell at you.<br /><br />One tip - pay attention to everything the cop says.&nbsp; &nbsp;He does not like repeating himself and is quite the character.<br /><br />There are plugs near the back of the room for the laptops but I preferred relying on battery power to sit near the big bright windows.&nbsp; It put me away from the break room where everyone is really loud and annoying.&nbsp; If you are near the windows, it&#039;s a lot quieter and nicer.

				Ha, Daisy you just reminded me of the cop at the Jamaica location.&nbsp; I went a few years ago and totally forgot how he was.&nbsp; Thankfully I didn&#039;t get picked and only wasted a day there, but remember the cop the most out of the whole experience.

				I think the cop is in a good mood today. He&#039;s pretty amusing and doesn&#039;t really seem to be bothered by anything.&nbsp; They really do need more power outlets, though.

				Yeah, that cop is a trip.&nbsp; I was there a little early the next day and I noticed that he repeats his whole funny spiel every day, same jokes and everything.&nbsp; He&#039;s funny I guess, until you&#039;re the one being made fun of.&nbsp; I noticed a number of people who did things because they weren&#039;t listening to him, and when he publicly ridiculed them, they got real upset and some words were exchanged.&nbsp; I basically just sat in the back and kept my head down, trying not to be noticed.&nbsp; It seemed better not to draw attention to yourself.<br /><br />Perhaps the most annoying thing was the Fox News they blared before and after the movies.&nbsp; I hate watching news all day, and this seemed like punishment.&nbsp;

				Our punishment today was during the orientation, listening to the judge drone on and on about the different courthouses, movies based on cases tried in LIC, the actors in those movies (he couldn&#039;t remember their names), his childhood, and who knows what else for 45 minutes.<br /><br />What&#039;s weird is that the cop told us &quot;you can go on break before he comes in, but if you do that you can&#039;t come back until he&#039;s done.&nbsp; And if you stay, you can&#039;t be on the computer or cell phone and you have to pay attention to him, or he&#039;ll call you out.&quot;&nbsp; I was like, &quot;why would anyone stay, then??&quot; but stayed anyway because I had nowhere else to go.&nbsp; Big mistake.&nbsp; I hid behind one of the columns where he couldn&#039;t see me, and messed with my phone.<br /><br />The other thing is you could barely hear him even with the microphone.&nbsp; He&#039;s like 90 years old and the break area is NOISY.

				He will repeat the same monotonous speech tomorrow morning as well.&nbsp; I think if you arrive later (they let you arrive later the next day), you will miss him.<br /><br />I hated that break room.&nbsp; I had so much work to do that week and brought the work with me because I could not afford a day off.&nbsp; I tried to stay as far away from that break room as possible.

				After giving some serious thought:<br /><br />Definitely bring:<br /><br />- Pack of grape flavored Bubble Yum<br />- Lucky rabbit’s foot<br />- Library copy of Mein Kampf<br />- Robin Hood-style cap (green tights and pointed shoes, optional)<br />- Boombox playing Whipped Cream and Other Delights CD by Herb Alpert &amp; the Tijuana Brass<br />- Ed Hardy t-shirt<br />- Bag of Nibs Licorice Bits candy (preferably red, with enough for everyone, ergo few hundred people)<br />- Jackie Onassis sunglasses that take up half of face<br />- Chess set with pieces depicting New Kids on the Block vs. Backstreet Boys<br />- Pint of Blackberries, as opposed to Blackberry mobile device<br /><br />Definite DO NOT bring:<br /><br />- 9 MM Glock pistol<br />- Aunt Sophie from Altoona<br />- Vast collection of G.I. Joe memorabilia<br />- Hangups regarding red toenail polish<br />- The grizzly bear in your landlord’s basement that he feeds bucketloads of LSD every day<br />- Your strange friend, the one who smells vaguely of old mimeograph ink and inspires a vague sense of melancholy in all your other friends<br />- Black, full-length graduation gown, curly white shoulder length wig and gavel<br />- Navy blue windbreaker with the word “BADASS” stenciled in rodeo-style print on the left breast<br />- Neighbor who works as birthday party clown but often wears his make-up all the time, especially when toting a six pack of Old Milwaukee in cans and yelling out “HEY CHIEF” to everyone who passes on the street<br />- Vintage Apple IIe computer to pound out important work project on dot matrix printer<br /><br />That about covers it from every angle I could think of.

				TV-B-Gone--maybe that&#039;s the next thing they&#039;ll try to keep out instead of cameras.&nbsp; I&#039;m always wondering what people are thinking who try to create captive TV audiences (except advertising people--we know what they&#039;re thinking).<br /><br />And Fox News--of all channels!&nbsp; Is somebody trying to indoctrinate the jurors?<br /><br />A few years ago I saw a Web page in Portuguese about TV-B-Gone.&nbsp; I liked seeing it explain the name for Portuguese speakers.

				Well, they do put on movies, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.&nbsp; So at least it&#039;s not Fox News all day.&nbsp; I think the movies are there to entertain people because being there is just so darn boring.&nbsp; But I just wish they would stop with the news.&nbsp; Watching news tends to be so depressing.&nbsp; Couldn&#039;t they at least put on Animal Planet or Discovery instead of news?<br /><br />But whatever, at least I&#039;m done for another 6 years :)

				They can&#039;t do that because they also play a video teaching you about jury duty.&nbsp; &nbsp;They don&#039;t really have a TV room.&nbsp; It&#039;s just one big room, with the break room separated by a big wall that&#039;s open on both sides.&nbsp; You hear everything.&nbsp; Basically, the whole experience is pretty miserable, but at least they have wifi - so just bring a computer and headphones and a book and be prepared to chill out for the day.

				Last time I was on jury duty I was at Criminal Court in Kew Gardens, with a TV-free jury room, and somehow we all learned to be jurors.&nbsp; It was the year of the Fat Nick Minucci trial, whenever that was.<br /><br />And last time I was at the Jamaica courthouse, things were slightly different (sigh).&nbsp; They had that obnoxious TV, but the break room was almost empty and during the afternoon of my first day I figured out a modus vivendi where I could sit with a book in the break room.&nbsp; Just a few seconds later, I and some other jurors were released from jury duty for the next four years.&nbsp; Those were the days.<br /><br />But now I at least have the audio equipment to weather it out.<br /><br />Is there still a Jewish-style deli near the Jamaica courthouse?&nbsp; For me, that was the best part of jury duty in Jamaica.<br /><br />ETA: The Fat Nick Minucci trial was in 2006!&nbsp; So I shouldn&#039;t be called until 2012.&nbsp; By then there&#039;ll be better electronics.

				Grand Jury Duty is the best... if you can take the month off. they call you, you go. Unless you&#039;re dead, dying in less than a month, or are a sole provider. No &quot;I&#039;m going on vacation&quot; (well, if you can prove it they&#039;ll give you 6 months- and they WILL call, and you WILL serve then). No sitting around waiting to be called; you get assigned to a jury, they swear you in and take you to one of the Grand Jury Rooms. That&#039;s it, you start right then- usually within about 15 minutes. There is a routine, usually bail jumping warrants are first, then the meaty cases come through. Most are done in less than a day, some go on for the full 20 days you&#039;re there. But it&#039;s not boring repeating stuff. After a few days, people got to know each other and we would bring donuts and the Box o&#039;coffee thing. On slower days we could bring DVD&#039;s and we would vote on which one would be put on. Mostly harmless family type comedies that had the most appeal across the demographics. And you&#039;d be surprised how everybody got along. After a month together, the last day we all went to lunch at the Chinese place across from the courthouse. We had 3 big cases that went almost the whole time, and over a hundred smaller cases that were usually finished in a couple of hours. All were put forward except for one small drug arrest case due to bad presentation by an assistant DA.

				Most people cannot take a month off from their work or their life to be a juror. For people who get limited amount of paid days from their employer for jury duty, or those who get no pay, it&#039;s an unreasonable expectation to take such a financial hit. Why can&#039;t grand jury duty be 1 or 2 weeks, unless it involves a big case?&#160;

				They will pay if you&#039;re employer does not. It isn&#039;t a lot, but it&#039;s something. Your employer cannot take action against you for serving on a Grand Jury- they can be heavily fined, sued, prosecuted or all three. The 20 consecutive days was changed from 1-2 days a week for 6 months... People hated that worse. There was some grumbling the first few days, but then everyone realized that many of the juicy cases could not have been properly presented in a 2 week window. We were lucky that no case needed to be extended and would have been on-call until the case was finished. They will wait to present a big case until a new Grand Jury is seated to be sure to have the most possible time and they make every effort to get it put through by closing. <br />I preferred it to regular JD since it was a regular schedule and could make plans around it instead of calling and maybe having to show, maybe not on a few hours notice.
