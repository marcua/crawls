				Grand Liquor at the 30th Avenue and 31st Street intersection is amazing.<br /><br />I also like the Discount Liquor store at Broadway and Steinway, NW corner, next to TD Bank.&nbsp; They&#039;re really friendly and have a good selection.

				Thanks for the input. I&#039;m specifically looking for the most economical liquor store. Times are tough. I have a place by work in Manhattan which has great service, but the prices are too high. In my experience the best liquor stores are the ones where the employees are a little tipsy. Anyone else notice this? I guess I&#039;m looking for a place where the employees are higher than the prices.

				If your focus is $$ then you should check out the liquor store next to Costco.&nbsp; Excellent prices, but service recommendations for wines can be a bit spotty.&nbsp; You don&#039;t need to be a Costco member to go here, they&#039;re not technically affiliated.&nbsp; I&#039;ve found that their price on hard liquor is great, especially if you&#039;re not shy about buying the &#039;family size&#039; bottles.&nbsp; Totally cheaper than Grand Liquor or Dominick&#039;s.<br /><br />Good part about Grand Liquor is that you can call in an order in the morning &amp; have it delivered to your door in the afternoon.&nbsp; Joleson&#039;s (sp?) on 31st Street (near Ditmars train stop) also delivers and I&#039;ve seen a sign at Dominick&#039;s about delivery, but haven&#039;t actually used it.&nbsp; <br /><br />So stock up &amp; let us know where the party will be&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				I second the love for Grand Wine (30th Ave and 31st St), Domineck&#039;s (Astoria Blvd) and Jolseon&#039;s (31st and Ditmars).<br /><br />But as for prices, go to the Costco store. There are some great deals. The selection is limited, but it&#039;s a great place to go to get your standards in big sizes and on the cheap.

				Grand has the best selection. But I normally just go someplace close, Omega or the place on 21st next to Punjab (little selection, buy open till 12am!).

				I must put in a good word for the great shop on 36th Avenue just west of 31st Street.&nbsp; The guys who own the place are fantastic.&nbsp; Friendly and knowledgeable.&nbsp; In general, the markup on wine is much bigger than on liquor.&nbsp; Therefore, you&#039;ll see much more disparity in wine prices while liquor prices are usually pretty even (give or take a couple bucks).&nbsp; This shop has great prices on wine, and is competitive on liquor.&nbsp; Thumbs up!

				Me 3 RE the place at the 30th Street N stop.&nbsp; They also have good in-store tastings and the staff is very knowledgeable.<br /><br />For my &quot;local tipples&quot; I go to Omega Wines and Spirits on 23rd Ave.&nbsp; It&#039;s small but well-curated, as well as being family-run.&nbsp; Very courteous, helpful folks who won&#039;t try to upsell you.<br /><br />They also have an astonishingly large Greek wine and spirit selection for such a small place.<br /><br />

				Since we are on the topic of alcohol..Does anyone have any suggestions on a good beverage center.&nbsp; I been going to the one on astoria blvd and I believe 41st.&nbsp; It&#039;s a little shady to me and expensive I found on certain beers.&nbsp; I bought a case of beer there a few weeks back and it was outdated also.<br /><br />Any suggestions on a place?

				as per page one, people really seem to like euromarket on 31st between 30 and 31st aves for their beer selection and there is a decent distributor on 21st street between Astoria blvd and 30th ave. I have been to neither, but have walked by both. If you do go to the distributor on 21st i recommend walking a little bit further north as there is an old cemetery with some stones dating back to the 18th century. Could be the 19th century.
