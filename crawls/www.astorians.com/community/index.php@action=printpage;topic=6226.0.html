				Hello everyone!<br /><br />I&#039;ve decided to go to grad school in the Fall (NYU, I&#039;m so excited), and in an attempt to lower my expenses, I&#039;ve decided its probably smart to find a roommate situation. I am looking to spend around $850.00 and would love to find something near the Broadway stop on the N train (but I am open to other areas for the right situation). My current lease ends on July 31 so I can move Aug. 1. My perfect roommate would be responsible, clean, quiet, gay-friendly, and just a really nice person. I am open to either male or female roommates. I&#039;ve had both in the past.<br /><br />A little about me:<br />I&#039;m a 34 year old gay male. I&#039;ve been living alone for the past three years in Astoria. I&#039;m a graphic designer with a full-time job in Marketing. Schools starts in September, but I am hoping to work part-time while in school. I like my living space to be where I get away from it all. I like things clean, so I am pretty good about cleaning. I like it quiet too. I&#039;m not a neat freak but I am organized and don&#039;t like clutter. I have had many roommates in the past, so I am very familiar with what it means to live with another person. I am very responsible and always pay bills on time. I like to workout, run in the park, and I am an avid knitter. I don&#039;t usually entertain at home because I usually go out with friends. While in school I am sure I will be at school more than home. When I am home I am sure I will need to sleep or study.<br /><br />At any rate, if you are looking for a great roommate or know someone who needs a great roommate please drop me a line. Thanks!<br /><br />Alex
