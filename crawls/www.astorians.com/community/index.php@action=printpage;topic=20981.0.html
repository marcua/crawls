				Hello neighbors, or soon to be. I&#039;m moving from Manhattan to Astoria with my GF in June. Looking for a good gym in the area. I don&#039;t mean a sweaty little room full of guys in spandex. I mean a modern gym with new equipment. I&#039;ve heard of the Rock near Ditmars and the new Tightan (used to be Dolphin?), but I have read mixed reviews on-line. I have emailed both and asked for rates, but have gotten ZERO replies.<br />Can anyone give me the scoop on the best gym(s) in the area?<br />&nbsp;<br />Thanks all, JF

				If money isnt an object then the Rock would be your best bet . But theres another gym in the shopping plaza on 47th and Ditmars called The Matrix which is also very good and a little cheaper in price .&nbsp; Planet Fitness on steinway is dirt cheap but i dont think its for the serious lifter&nbsp; because they lack alot of equipment and dont have many free weights .&nbsp; &nbsp;If lifting isnt your main thing , you should check PF out .

				The Rock is a great gym in every way.&nbsp; They often have sales.&nbsp; For example, I bought a year&#039;s membership during a sale for $63 a month and it has stayed at that price for two years now.&nbsp; I think the individual pay-by-month pice is around $90+.&nbsp; I also think they post their prices and packages on their website; check it out.&nbsp; If you can lock in a good price, I think you get everything at the Rock and they&#039;re open 24/7.

				You won&#039;t get an answer from the Rock&nbsp; -- they don&#039;t even answer their member&#039;s e-mails. <br /><br /><br />But it really depends on where you&#039;ll be living. I&#039;m assuming you won&#039;t want to travel too far to a gym.<br /><br /><br />Personally, I&#039;ve been a member of the Rock for five years and I&#039;m leaving in 2 weeks. I&#039;ve been paying for my membership<br />in cash for a few years to avoid credit card charges. I know that the rate a couple of my friends there pay averages about $75 to<br />$78 a month. They do run specials sometimes in the fall though. <br /><br /><br />It&#039;s not worth the money though. It&#039;s become very run down, equipment stays broken for months and not as clean as it used to be.<br />And other members can say I&#039;m wrong, but I&#039;m there 6 days/week so I think I know that when I have to clean hair out of the shower<br />every Sunday morning and one bathroom stall door has been broken since Memorial Day, it&#039;s not worth being the most expensive gym in the<br />area.<br /><br /><br />I have a couple of friends at Club Fitness on B&#039;way. They love it. I&#039;m joining Life-Health Fitness on 35 Avenue. They&#039;re open 24 hours Monday-Friday. Good equipment, well run and very clean. And much less $$$ than the Rock. I&#039;ve heard mixed reviews on NY Sports Club. <br /><br /><br />Why don&#039;t you stop in to the ones you&#039;re interested in and get guest passes? They&#039;ll usually give you a two or three day pass. I know the Rock does do that. Try them out and see where you&#039;re comfortable. <br /><br /><br />One thing I know about Tightan is that it&#039;s very small. I do my laundry near it and it&#039;s tiny. And the hours are not great if you want to go early<br />in the morning before work. They don&#039;t open till 7 a.m. during the week. At least that was on the sign when I saw it earlier this summer. <br /><br /><br />But try places out before paying anything so you don&#039;t wastes your $$$. <br /><br />

				FYI&nbsp; -the Rock is NOT open 24/7. It&#039;s open 24 hours Monday morning through Friday night. Weekends it&#039;s 7 a.m. to 8:00 during the summer.<br /><br /><br />Just posting this in case that&#039;s a deal breaker. It&#039;s also something they never tell new members. I always meet people who show up a little<br />before 7 on Sat. mornings wondering why it&#039;s not open.

				Club fitness on broadway is awesome! it&#039;s clean and modern the staff is very helpful and friendly and its just a few steps away from the train. It does however depend on where you live. Another option is NYSC if that&#039;s something you may already be familiar with from the city there is one on steinway and 30th ave. It&#039;s pretty good, although very crowded during morning and evening hours on the weekdays.

				I&#039;ve been a member of The Matrix now for about a year, and I like it.&nbsp; In the past, I was a member of the Rock for several years, so I have a point of comparison.&nbsp; The Matrix is cheaper.&nbsp; It is more no frills The Rock, and I like that.&nbsp; They&#039;ve been doing some renovations and equipment upgrades in the past year, and they&#039;ve got plenty of machines in good condition.&nbsp; The weight room is pretty well stocked.&nbsp; They&#039;ve got a variety of classes, although I have never taken any, and they offer all sorts of trainer options - private, semi-private, and small group, the latter of which I&#039;ve done and I think it&#039;s a good value.&nbsp; They have a certified sports massage therapist on staff, I believe.<br /><br />If you go to their website, you can print out a 14 day pass to try it before joining.<br />

				I joined Life Health &amp; Fitness at the Kaufman Studios in August and am very happy with it. Great staff, new equipment that&#039;s well-maintained, very clean. Open 24-hours during the week too. Good trainers as well and a variety of classes. Plus the price is excellent and they have different payment options depending on your needs. <br />Location - 37th St. &amp; 35th Ave.<br />

				I replied to this thread earlier - see above - but I can update my response a little.<br /><br /><br />I belong to Life Health &amp; Fitness on 37th Street just off 35 Avenue. Great gym, very clean, nice staff, good equipment and<br />excellent hours. Rates are very good too. You can pay monthly, annually or even for just 6 months.<br /><br /><br />I know Tightan because I do my laundry next door to it. It seems very small to me even though I know they have an upstairs<br />level. And the hours - for me anyway - aren&#039;t good. They don&#039;t open till 6 a.m. - most gyms in this area are either 24-hour <br />or open by 5 a.m.<br /><br /><br />A new one is opening on Steinway St. right near Broadway called Blink. It&#039;s owned by Equinox and is opening in December. <br /><br /><br />I belonged to the Rock for 5 years and do not recommend it. It&#039;s overpriced and overrated. <br /><br /><br />There are also lots of smaller specialized fitness studios and gyms now in Astoria/Long Island City.<br /><br /><br />I take pilates classes at Tone on 37th &amp; B&#039;way. Excellent studio which offers pilates (mat and reformer classes) along with <br />classes in Surfset. There are also places like Simply Fit Astoria, Cross Fit and a lot of yoga studios.<br /><br /><br />You should go on Yelp and look at gyms/fitness in Astoria. You&#039;ll also get real opinions about them. <br /><br /><br />Whatever you do, don&#039;t sign up anywhere right away. Be a fitness tourist and try a few places. They all give passes <br />or have intro specials (Tone has a 3-class newbie special for $30). Explore and see what you like.<br /><br />

				ladydi is right. BQE is a PERFECT gym for me in many ways, but my exercise habits, goals and requirements are going to be different than yours and the next guy. I&#039;d think about the things that you want from a gym in order of priority and then sample a few and see which meets that.

				I don&#039;t care if people juice, but needles left around like that is a major concern. <br /><br /><br />Why at the gym though? I don&#039;t think injections need to be made so immediately before or after a workout that you need to do that at the gym.<br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t use the locker rooms at BQE anyway. I wear shorts and a t-shirt every day, no matter what the weather (boots if it&#039;s snowing), and I wear it from my house to there. Health concerns are a part of why I do this, not to mention concerns about theft, adding to my prep time, and my lack of desire to see old man sack all over. Yamma Hamma it&#039;s fright night!

				Has anyone been to Blink yet? Any reviews on that place?<br /><br />I just moved here and want to join a gym. I also want to get a personal trainer but an affordable one. Blink offers $27 a session with trainers which is fantastic but the reviews seem to be mixed. I really would rather not pay more than $50 if possible. I would use the gym every work day around 6:30 and the weekends whenever so it would be nice if the place wasn&#039;t super crowded. Any suggestions?<br />

				A woman at my gym joined Blink because of the cheap price and it&#039;s closer proximity to her home.<br /><br /><br />She says it&#039;s ok. Equipment is all very good, staff is friendly, helpful.<br /><br /><br />But she said that if weights/strength training are a priority, it&#039;s not the greatest. They mainly have machines,<br />not any free weights or plate-loaded machines. <br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t anyone else who belongs to Blink so I&#039;m going on one person&#039;s comments. You might want to check their<br />reviews on Yelp - people tend to be more detailed there.<br /><br /><br />I belong to Life Health &amp; Fitness on 35 Ave. &amp; 37th Street. It&#039;s open 24-hours Monday to Friday and at 7 a.m. on<br />weekends. They have good trainers and the rates are reasonable - in fact I think it&#039;s within your price range.<br /><br /><br />It doesn&#039;t hurt to check out a couple of clubs just to make sure you get the right fit. <br /><br /><br />Website is http://www.lifehealth-fitness.com/ if you want to check it out. <br /><br />
