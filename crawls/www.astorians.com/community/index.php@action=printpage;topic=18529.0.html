				I&#039;m interested in an intro to yoga class or something equally suitable for a novice (never taken a yoga class). Any neighborhood recommendations would be much appreciated!

				I&#039;d recommend Susan at Creative Vibrations at the Ditmars stop, or Yoga Agora on Broadway and 33rd. <br />

				This is not an Astoria option, but if you&#039;re downtown and it&#039;s convenient, OM Yoga has a Basics class which is great.<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken it twice because while I&#039;ve been doing pilates for about 8 years, I&#039;ve only done yoga a handful of times.<br />Very nice studio, laid back, no pressure to buy anything. And Basics gives you a really good &#039;feel&#039; for yoga, pace is<br />slower and the instructor always asks what level each person is at and what they want out of the class. I really like it. <br /><br />They offer it most days, if not daily. So if you&#039;re in the 12th &amp; B&#039;way area, check them out:<br /><br />www.omyoga.com<br />

				I did this beginner series years ago. &nbsp;It will set you up well technically and teach basics of yoga philosophy. &nbsp;There were only 5-7 of us in the class so there was a lot of individual attention. &nbsp;The people (instructor and students) are friendly and approachable. &nbsp;<br /><br />http://nyc.laughinglotus.com/ongoing_absbeg.html<br /><br />Just a disclaimer, I don&#039;t practice regularly. &nbsp;Typically, I drop-in my local gym&#039;s sessions during the winter months. &nbsp;For me, it&#039;s the most cost effective and since I&#039;m not hardcore it satisfies my needs. &nbsp;That&#039;s not something I would ever suggest to a beginner because you won&#039;t get the proper instruction or attention in a class of 20+. &nbsp;And, if you don&#039;t know what you are doing it&#039;s easy to hurt yourself. &nbsp;I think you are on the right track--find a yoga studio for your first few sessions. Be sure to tell them ahead of time you are a beginner so they put you in the right class. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />
