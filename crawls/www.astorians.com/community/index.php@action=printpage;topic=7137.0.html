				This has really been bugging me lately, and I&#039;m not sure why I&#039;ve become so much more sensitive to it.&nbsp; But it&#039;s the use of the word &quot;like&quot; used as every 2nd word when people talk.<br /><br />Like, I don&#039;t know, like, what I&#039;m, like, trying to say.&nbsp; It&#039;s like, crazy, how, like, incapable people are, like, to not use, like, like.<br /><br />Can you imagine if people actually wrote the way they actually spoke?&nbsp; The word &quot;like&quot; has become the most used word in the English language.<br /><br />Ah, I now remember.&nbsp; I heard a commentary on NPR about the fact that the current generation lacks conviction and it&#039;s apparent in our speech patterns.&nbsp; Use of the word &quot;like&quot; de-emphasizes arguments.&nbsp; It was really a great piece, and I wish I could remember it.<br /><br />But come on people, aren&#039;t we capable of forming thoughts and translating them to speech without that dreaded word?

				I might be guilty of this, Jtrane. &nbsp;<br /><br />I don&#039;t even realize how poor my English skills are until someone has to point it out to me, which is actually one of my biggest pet peeves (you know the whole grammar police). &nbsp;I grew up in a family of &quot;holier than thou&quot; grammar police who were always correcting my speech. &nbsp;I think my form of rebellion was screwing with my grammar! &nbsp;That being said, the overuse and misuse of &quot;like&quot; in conversations used to drive my family insane so you know I was &quot;like&quot; throwing that word in every freaking sentence! &nbsp;<br /><br />

				ROFL. &nbsp;I love the examples...you guys have me chuckling at work.<br /><br />I think I&#039;m guilty of this too although I really try to be aware of it and not say the dreaded word too much. &nbsp;It is funny though, because I think I am similar to Astoria Luv where I come from a family of grammar police and I often am one myself. &nbsp;I think it is true to a certain degree that it comes from not wanting to clearly state a point, but to put some de-emphasis on it so it doesn&#039;t seem too harsh. &nbsp;I think it&#039;s also largely out of the dwindling vocabulary of later generations. &nbsp;When they can&#039;t think of the exact word to express it, in goes a &quot;like&quot; with the next best word. &nbsp;Combined with habit based on everyone around you saying the same thing, it&#039;s lethal.

				Ah yeah.&nbsp; That&#039;s right.&nbsp; Well, the reason I started this thread today, is because I was listening to Soundcheck on WNYC, and they were talking about West Side Story.&nbsp; They had a girl on, I think an actress.&nbsp; Every other word out of her mouth was &quot;like&quot;.&nbsp; She was completely unintelligible.&nbsp; It was so frustrating trying to decipher what she was trying to say.<br /><br />Also, love the fact that the poet is wearing a Scrabble T-Shirt!&nbsp; How appropriate!

				What&#039;s more annoying: &quot;like&quot; or &quot;um&quot; and &quot;ahh&quot;? &nbsp;<br /><br />I was watching an interesting discussion on BookTV (yes, I watch Book TV almost every day!) and one of the panel speakers, who was a professor, kept on saying &quot;ah.&quot; &nbsp;He seemed pretty self-confident and knew the subject matter so I doubt it had anything to do with trying to stall for time or lack of anything to say. &nbsp;Eventually, despite the interesting subject, I couldn&#039;t listen to him anymore and I had to turn the channel. &nbsp;

				As much as I despise this particular usage of the word, I am infrequently guilty of slipping one into a sentence. I&#039;ve got a whole list of language peeves (such as &quot;I could care less&quot;) that just kill me. I don&#039;t think we need to speak like the Queen of England all the time, but a little effort to keep meanings clear would be such a real treat sometimes...

				Once I saw this show with Weird&nbsp; Al Yankovich, where he intercut clips with Eminem so it appeared Al was interviewing him. Every word from Eminem was like, you know, you know what I mean. Weird Al&#039;s intercut footage was - &quot;No I don&#039;t know - No what do you mean ?&quot;&nbsp; It kept going back and forth and was very funny.
