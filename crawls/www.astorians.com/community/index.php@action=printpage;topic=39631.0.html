				<br />Anyone out there who rents an apartment in a private home...from a landlord...or else who rents in a small old walk-up building?<br /><br />I am wondering in these types of buildings, what people&#039;s norms have been over the years with rent increases.&nbsp; Obviously the larger and newer buildings are run by property managers/developer types, who are just plain greedy, and jack up the rent every year.&nbsp; And many of these start out as &#039;rent stabilized&#039; because the developer got a tax write off (421-a), but eventually all these apts will become market rate.<br /><br />I&#039;m more curious about the &#039;average&#039; old-school rentals across Astoria.&nbsp; If you live in such a building or house, what has the pattern been with increases?&nbsp; Have you seen any change in the rent increase as Astoria has gotten more popular?<br /><br />I rent in a small apt bldg. where the LL lives with his family, and he loves to talk about how this is a &#039;family&#039; building but yet, my strong sense is that he&#039;s going to raise the rent every year, &#039;just because&#039;.&nbsp; I just received my second renewal lease since I&#039;ve been here, and just like my first renewal went up $50, to 1800 (from $1750), so too is the rent going up again, this time another $55.<br /><br />I know Astoria has gotten more popular and so property values have increased, and perhaps property tax, but I can&#039;t imagine it&#039;s been so much to warrant yearly rent increases, and of almost 5%.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s just pure greed.&nbsp; So I&#039;m curious how many others in &#039;old-school&#039; apartments are seeing the same thing.&nbsp; My strong sense however is that there ARE some old-school homeowners out there who are not greedy, and simply charge reasonable rents, and raise them only when they need to.&nbsp; (It&#039;s&nbsp; just the brokers who, once they get involved, ruin everything...cuz they inflate the market because of course their commissions % are all based on the price.)

				I live in a rent stabilized 4 floor walk up building.&nbsp; My rent has been going up since I moved here in 1994.&nbsp; I either get a 1 or 2 year lease.&nbsp; The rent is about double what it was in 1994.&nbsp; This year there is supposed to be a rent freeze for 1 year leases.&nbsp; I&#039;m so happy about that.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t live anywhere without a lease because then the landlord could raise the rent whenever he wants to and for whatever amount he wants to.&nbsp; A lease give you protection from greedy landlords.

				<br />&quot;Seems to me that your increase is under 3%, not 5%&quot;<br /><br />Ah, you&#039;re right...I made a math mistake.<br /><br />Anyway, not sure what &#039;consumer price index&#039; means exactly or how that might relate to home-ownership expenses but....<br /><br />All I know is that when I lived in another part of Queens (a part that wasn&#039;t &#039;cool&#039; or hip)...that the LL didn&#039;t raise the rent one iota, in five years.&nbsp; And he was an extremely responsive LL who kept a really beautiful building.&nbsp; Did his expenses not go up at all, or was the rent already able to cover all his expenses?<br /><br />My current LL...he&#039;s ok.&nbsp; Not bad, but not super responsive either when there&#039;s an issue.&nbsp; Of course however, with this LL, we are in a &#039;hip&#039; and gentrifying neighborhood.&nbsp; So I have to wonder.... have costs gone up that much because of the now-higher property values, that he feels he must raise the rent each year?&nbsp; You say my landlord is &#039;not greedy&#039;, but how can you be certain if you don&#039;t know what his expenses are, or if/ how much they might have gone up?&nbsp; <br /><br />As for &#039;cost of living&#039;, all I know is that my salary, and that of most other people, are not going up each year.<br /><br />As we all know, many long-time small businesses are closing up in the nabe, as the commercial LLs start to charge more money for rent.&nbsp; I suppose all those commercial LLs are also raising the rents out of necessity, and not greed?<br /><br />Another reason I&#039;m very suspect about my LL is that he doesn&#039;t go by the book when providing a new lease.&nbsp; He&#039;s supposed to provide some type of a chart ...or a &#039;Rider&#039; or something...with my Renewal Lease (since it&#039;s a Rent-Stabil) apartment.&nbsp; He never provides that form.&nbsp; He&#039;s also supposed to provide a 1 or 2 year lease option, indicating the rental amounts for each.&nbsp; He never does that either.&nbsp; Only gives me a one-year lease option.&nbsp; And whenever I try to question any of this, he plays dumb or twists things to try and intimidate me.&nbsp; I know what he&#039;s doing.&nbsp; But the thing is...since we live in the same bldg., I feel I can&#039;t &#039;challenge&#039; him too much, or things could feel awkward and tense, which I obviously don&#039;t want in the building where I live.&nbsp;

				Yipee, just FYI the consumer price index is a number created by the bureau of labor statistics that reflects any increase or decrease in cost of living for a given US geographic area.&nbsp; It takes into account the prices of many different everyday items.&nbsp; Many pensions, union contracts and other similar contracts use these values to determine rate adjustments.&nbsp; Just because your employer didn&#039;t give you a raise doesn&#039;t mean that your landlord doesn&#039;t have the right to ask for one from you (don&#039;t worry many, many people are in the same boat as you with stagnant wages over the course of this decade).<br /><br />One of the problems is that because the neighborhood has become &quot;cool&quot;, the tax assessors have been dramatically increasing assessed values (and property taxes) over the past few years on anything bigger than a single family home (which have legal rate increase limits).<br /><br />Since you live in a rent stabilized apartment, your landlord can&#039;t ask for any increase for a one year lease extension and a 2% increase for a 2 year lease extension.&nbsp; If your landlord tries to charge you more, you can theoretically sue and get triple damages for every dollar you overpaid.<br /><br />Here are the rate increases as per the NYC Rent Guidelines Board:<br />http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/service/2069/new-york-city-rent-increase (http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/service/2069/new-york-city-rent-increase)<br /><br />It seems that what your landlord is doing is illegal.&nbsp; It is up to you how much of a fight you want to put up.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				<br />Thanks...<br /><br />Actually, some of what he&#039;s doing is not 100% right...i.e., he&#039;s not giving me all the proper paperwork with my lease, nor is he giving me option for a 2-year lease.<br /><br />But I don&#039;t think he&#039;s doing anything &#039;illegal&#039;, if what you are referring to is the actual rent increase itself.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t specify in my original post but... while my apt. is rent-stabil, he was not charging me the full Legal (allowable) Rent in the past.&nbsp; Until now.&nbsp; Now with my new lease, my rent will be AT the Legal (maximum allowable) Rent for my Rent Stabil apartment.&nbsp; So from this point onward, indeed, any increases he wants for my renewal leases can only be for any amount determined by the rent board guidelines.&nbsp; <br /><br />But prior to this, so long as my rent remained below the Legal Rent, he was within his rights to raise my rent as much as he wanted.&nbsp; And while sure, some might say I was already getting a good deal (because I was always paying less than the Legal Rent amount), it&#039;s all relative as they say.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think that what I&#039;d been paying was such a great deal.&nbsp; Sure, it&#039;s a great neighborhood overall, but my apt itself is small, no laundry, and is a 15 minute walk to the subway.&nbsp; I know someone else who pays $1600 for a 3BR in this same nabe...where clearly the LL could get a lot more for rent, but chooses to keep it at a more reasonable level.<br /><br />It&#039;s all relative.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; I know others in the nabe who are paying $2600 for 1BRs in &#039;luxury bldgs&#039;.&nbsp; Course, they have a doorman, fitness center, finished roofdeck, laundry in their apartment, modern fixtures, etc., but then...I don&#039;t think their places are worth that much either.
