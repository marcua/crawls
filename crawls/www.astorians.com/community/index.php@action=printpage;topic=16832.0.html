				Wushu is the art of stopping violence and the grandfather of all martial arts. It is best known in the US thru Jet Li, Jackie Chan, Gordon Liu <br /><br />I&#039;ve been attending Wushu classes for over 8 months, It has improved my strength, stamina, and flexibility. It has taught me that power comes internally and that only your insecurities pose a threat to your achievements. <br /><br />We learn modern and traditional forms and weapons, self defense(Qin&#039;Na), acupressure therapy and massage, SanDa/SanShou(ChineseBoxing) and acrobatics. <br /><br />The classes are off of the N/W at Ditmars. <br />I definitely love the fact that I was able to find this training in the area cuz the other schools I found were located either deep in queens , lower manhattan or brooklyn. <br /><br /><br />Send me a msg if you would like to know more.<br /><br />Cheers&nbsp; :-) <br />J<br />

I know real well about wushu and it&#039;s history. I&#039;ve done some projects on MA (Martial Arts) (now I am doing on brass knuckles (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdOwsEbMMMA)). As for now I am not in US, so I won&#039;t be able to attend any class. but I love to follow wushu training classes. But, Time&nbsp; :cry:
