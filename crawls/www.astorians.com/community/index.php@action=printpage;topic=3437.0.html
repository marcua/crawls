				I like to reconsider the constitution on special occasions. Hopefully all are familiar with our great document of the People. Some highlights and reminders-<br /><br />[Note: Repealed text is not noted in this version.&nbsp; Spelling errors have been<br />corrected in this version.&nbsp; For an uncorrected, annotated version of the<br />Constitution, visit http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html ]<br /><br />We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union,<br />establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common<br />defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to<br />ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the<br />United States of America.<br /><br />Article I.<br /><br />Section 1<br />All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the<br />United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.<br /><br /><br />Section 8<br />The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and<br />Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general<br />Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be<br />uniform throughout the United States;<br /><br />To borrow money on the credit of the United States;<br /><br />To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and<br />with the Indian Tribes;<br /><br />To establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization, and uniform Laws on the subject<br />of Bankruptcies throughout the United States;<br /><br />To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the<br />Standard of Weights and Measures;<br /><br />To provide for the Punishment of counterfeiting the Securities and current Coin<br />of the United States;<br /><br />To establish Post Offices and Post Roads;<br /><br />To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited<br />Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings<br />and Discoveries;<br /><br />To constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court;<br /><br />To define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and<br />Offenses against the Law of Nations;<br /><br />To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning<br />Captures on Land and Water;...<br /><br /><br />Article II.<br /><br />Section 1<br />The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of<br />America. He shall hold his Office during the Term of four Years, and, together<br />with the Vice-President chosen for the same Term, be elected, as follows:<br />...<br /><br /><br />Amendment VIII<br />Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel<br />and unusual punishments inflicted.<br /><br />Amendment IX<br />The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed<br />to deny or disparage others retained by the people.<br /><br />Amendment X<br />The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor<br />prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to<br />the people.<br /><br />***<br />Americans were very concerned about the creation of this federal government and how to limit or restrict the powers. It was accepted on the understanding that the Bill of Rights, the first 10 Amendments would be enacted.<br />The powers of our goverment are granted by the People, by the consent of the governed.<br /><br />Article I starts with Congress. The House of Representatives and Senate. The most local of elections for the federal level create the People&#39;s House, our Representatives.<br />They were not to have infinite powers, but those powers were to be listed or granted in the Constitution.<br />And other powers not listed belong to the States or people.<br /><br />The President or executive is the director who was to remain faithful to the laws set by our Congress.<br />He also has the important power of veto which may then require Congress to seek a greater legislative concensus to override and establish a law without the President&#39;s approval.<br /><br />The President is the Commander in Chief and deserves proper respect as the authority of our military.<br />But it is for Congress to declare whether our country is going to war, allow for the military, tax and budget.<br /><br />Ours is the oldest working constitution in the world.<br />Many blessings.<br />&nbsp;:-) <br /><br />

				<em>“The Constitution is not an instrument for the government to restrain the people, it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government - lest it come to dominate our lives and interests.” - Patrick Henry</em><br /><br />The American Constitution is one of the few truly perfect documents ever written, for all the ways we have muddied it in our human imperfection, the text remains pure. <br /><br />Happy anniversary, indeed.<br /><br />

				<br />Another year and it is Sept 17<br /><br />http://www.constitutioncenter.org/ncc_progs_Constitution_Day.aspx<br /><br />It too has a game quiz.<br /><br />Irony, trying to find the Constitution on their site.
