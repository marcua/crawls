				Just wondering if anyone has any suggestions...there has been extremely loud construction and air horns coming from the Amtrak overpass near 43rd St and Astoria Blvd since about 11pm tonight (Tuesday).&nbsp; The same thing happened last Thursday and went to around 4am.&nbsp; Even with all my windows open and earplugs it made it impossible to sleep. I called 311 but they don&#039;t have an option to register a complaint with Amtrak. The local precinct didn&#039;t have any suggestions either except to call Amtrak and of course, no one from Amtrak Customer Relations is there at non-normal business hours.<br /><br />Any other ideas who to call? It doesn&#039;t seem legal to do it at these hours. Or anyone have any insight how long this project is going to last?

				Since Amtrak is a federal entity you really don&#039;t have much that you can do about it. They are going by work rules for obvious<br />safety reasons by blowing their horns late at night. Hopefully the project that they are working on will be over soon. Deal with it, this isn&#039;t Kansas....

Not that this helps the poster, but if calling to complain you could do works than remind everyone you speak to on the phone that this a major violation of the noise ordinance and that there should be some way of enforcing that. They are supposed to have a noise contact sheet posted visibly at the job site, so if you can find that it may give you some way of addressing the matter. If they are not complying with the laws, then 311 is the only resource at your disposal, but enough patience with that may get you somewhere.

				Wow this thread is nasty. All the OP did was ask a question about the night construction noise. After all, Amtrak is not known for following rules and procedures. Yes, the trains and construction have been loud. The 6:30am Amtrak blows it&#039;s horn pretty loud and long these days, and it does suck. I&#039;m all for construction and repairs, but it would be nice to know how much longer it&#039;ll be going on. <br /><br />But please, don&#039;t take this as a complaint. Apparently unless you were born in a borough you&#039;re not allowed to express frustration anymore. This anti-transplant nonsense is driving me away from this board. Enough. Can&#039;t we just talk about Astoria?<br /><br />That being said, I do enjoy the construction a little... I think it&#039;s kinda cute when the guys blow the air horns, and the train blows it&#039;s whistle back. Like they&#039;re talking to each other.

				Does the early morning construction happen to include a constant beeping, like with a garbage truck or when a truck backs up? I&#039;ve been hearing this in my area (Ditmars near the park) from about 4:30 am to 6 am and have been wondering where it&#039;s coming from. A bit too early and continual for garbage trucks or ordinary construction work. I&#039;m not complaining--much prefer the beeping to blasting music--but just curious.<br /><br />Oh, and I did hear the air horns last night for the first time. Very loud, but at least it was still early in the evening. Would not want to wake up to it.

				I don&#039;t hear the beeping (Thank God!) but the &quot;conversation&quot; between the air horn and the train at 2:30am sounded like there was a great emergency...like a movie where a car is stuck on the tracks and the train can&#039;t stop. <br />Waking up with my heart pounding in the wee hours of the morning is not fun...<br /><br />oh and I&#039;m sorta new here...where do I submit my birth certificate to prove my Queens,NY origin?<br />Does living in Flushing for a decade ruin my Astorian credibility?

				The horns are how the crews communicate with one another.&nbsp; It&#039;s unfortunate that it&#039;s waking people up, but it&#039;s also preferable to track workers being killed.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure if this work could be done during peak travel times it would be, but it is likely that the service interruptions would be too great, so it is instead being done at night.<br /><br />I know that part of their Capital Plan for the 2010 fiscal year was to replace a lot of the overhead catenary and electrical equipment on the hell gate bride most of which dates back to the early 1900&#039;s so perhaps that is part of this work that is going on right now.<br />

				Amtrak is replacing wooden ties and maintaining the over head catenary structures/wires. <br /><br />Calling 311 or even Amtrak won&#039;t stop the crews from blowing their horns. It&#039;s a federal rule that when a train goes through a work area it <strong>must</strong> sound it&#039;s horn. The workers sound theirs back as acknowledgement and to warn their co-workers of a oncoming train. This is a major project and I don&#039;t see it ending any time soon.
