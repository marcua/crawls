				i personally do not think that we should view the actual execution.&nbsp; as horrible as that man was, the birth and death of a human being is something very personal, sacred, and i have no business seeing the death of that man. <br /><br />the 2 images that will forever remain in my head about that man is: when they captured him and a doctor was examining his mouth.&nbsp; and the picture of him with the masked men putting the noose around his head.<br /><br />those images are humblilng i guess. he was a man who thought himself have so much power, palaces, gold, whatever he wanted. to be reduced to living in a hole, being dirty, and having someone poke around his mouth. then to see him in his final moments. there&#39;s no way out of that. all of that power, gold, and palaces he cant take with him, wherever he goes after this.&nbsp; <br /><br />we are all human. the way we run our lives fuckin silly. <br /><br />i k now there is going to be more violence as a result of this. i just hope we can all stay safe.&nbsp;

				Just watched the saturday morning news on Channel 4.&nbsp; They showed footage of Saddam being led up to being hanged all the way to the noose being put around his head.&nbsp; I have never been for the death penalty for various reasons, and the whole shock and joy barbaric quality of everyone, including Bush, celebrating his death makes me sick.&nbsp;

				It&#39;s totally disgusting and unnecessary, and seems really unethical to force those images onto people.
