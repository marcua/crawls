				Since I am a Bosnian living in Astoria for some quite time, I would like to recommend a small Bosnian restaurant&quot; Old Bridge &quot; on 42nd street and 30th Ave. that has free internet acccess and offers best bosnian specialty&quot; cevapi&quot; ( thiny beef sausages with Bosnian bread) in NY<br />They also have delicious burger that comes with feta cheese.<br />If you dont like meat( like all Bosnians do), you can try hot daily soup or salad. Old bridge restaurant is located on 28-51 42 street. You can check out the web site starimostny&nbsp; or oldbridgeny dotcom.<br />

				It looks like Ditmartian does not like Bosnians or/and Bosnian places.... or maybe he can give us a better tip. I &#39;ve been reading different postings for a long time I decided to participate and was thinking to not include addresss about that place but I could not find that anybody mentioned it.<br />I found some discount coupon for Old Bridge but ,at this point, it is not worth mentioning it. Let Ditmartian find it for us.

				I see that this thread been moved to it&#39;s proper section. Thanks to whomever handles these things.<br /><br />User Sarajevo: I happen to love Bosnian food, cevapi being one of my favorites. I&#39;ve also had the privilege to enjoy many a fine local dish and drink with Bosnians in Sarajevo, Tuzla, Banja Luka, Mostar and Zenica. Some of them were war veterans, widows, aid workers, farmers, journalists, teachers and students. Once it was during wartime, and many times thereafter as the country struggled to recover in peace. <em>Da, ja govorim jezik.</em><br /><br />So I politely caution you from being quick to presume what I know and don&#39;t know, what I like and dislike. That said, I do dislike commercial deception, and your retort didn&#39;t leave me with a favorable impression of you, either. You could have gone the honorable route and simply admit that you were in fact posting an advertisement. Instead you opened yourself up to looking more foolish, particularly since I&#39;ve provided information that indicates you clearly have some sort of interest in the business.<br /><br />If you truly want Stari Most to be a success, then you may want to rethink how you choose to market it. Being dishonest generally doesn&#39;t help. Or, try other message boards where people like me aren&#39;t as sensitive to these sort of things. <em>Zivjeli.</em>

				I regret mentioning anything in connection with Bosnian food or businesses. Unfortunately I did not realize that nature of my work in Bosnian community would not allow me to discus about Bosnian businesses because of “conflict of interest”. My intention was not to promote anyone since I did not hide my identity. <br />To Ditmartian: My apology to you since you have provided some information about you….&nbsp; I was under impression that you were someone else and I have reacted so fast. I hope I can be useful to this forum participating in other topics.<br /><br />

				I still think it&#39;s somewhat vague as to whether or not Sarajevo is the owner of the restaurant mentioned.<br /><br />Regardless, I am looking forward to trying it.<br /><br />I also don&#39;t think posting in the Business Listings/Services should be considered negative either.&nbsp; Sometimes I feel like people feel bad if their posts are routed here.&nbsp; The information is still good, people are still seeing it.&nbsp; All is well.<br /><br />
