				Tonight, I used the fava beans and one of the onions to make this recipe, Pasta with Fava Beans (http://www.eleanoraskitchen.com/recipes/pastafava.htm). It&#39;s rather misleading, as the predominant flavors are the pancetta, tomatoes, basil, and mushrooms. I tweaked it a little, blanching the shelled beans for 30 seconds, then removing the skin from the beans before cooking them with the mushrooms. I also marinated for only 30 minutes instead of 60, used a bit more pancetta than called for, and used 1 16-oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of twice that much. It was very good, but the favas were few and far between, and overwhelmed by the other flavors....<br />

				That&#39;s really interesting, Harlan - I was planning on adding caramelised onions and prosciutto to my fava beans - although I had decided against tomatoes because I was afraid they would overwhelm the beans!&nbsp; I&#39;ll admit that the ingredient suggestions weren&#39;t mine, though - I got them from the suggested accompaniments at the end of this recipe (http://www.recipezaar.com/117520).&nbsp; How did the 30 second blanching time work?&nbsp; Was it enough?&nbsp; (I ask because the recipe I found calls for 3 minutes.)&nbsp; I&#39;m very curious to find out whether fresh favas are at all reminiscent of the fresh CSA lima beans of last year - which made me go from hating limas to eagerly looking forward to this fall&#39;s offering.<br /><br />I made the radishes finally, using the recipe provided in last week&#39;s recipe thread.&nbsp; I think I almost like them!

				I&#39;m making a sort of sweet beet salad (moroccan).<br /><br />A friend of mine served it at a dinner party and mmm sounds nice and cool and summery now!<br /><br />http://www.moroccousa.com/health/showrecipe.cfm?id=134<br /><br />I&#39;m using the cinnamon variation.<br /><br />Have not yet done anything with fava.&nbsp; On vacation I was addicted to these little pre-made salad tins of tuna, bean, and tomato.&nbsp; I may do something like that.

				We slow roasted the onions (red &amp; white) with some oil salt pepper. Mixed them with blanched fava beans for a salad with goat cheese.&nbsp; Grilled lamb chops for the entree.&nbsp; Deeeeeeliscious!<br /><br />When is the farmer bringing just picked ice cream and Iberian pork sausage???&nbsp; Could someone get on this right away and let us know.<br /><br />Thank you.

				Ha!&nbsp; Roasted the onions as well, same way...S&amp;P and olive oil.&nbsp; Served it up w/ some marinated skirt steak that had marinated all day.&nbsp; <br /><br />Fava beans (what a terrible yield on these - half were totally empty!!) went in w/ a couple of whole tomatoes, shopped onion, lemon juice, bit o&#39; hot red pepper, S&amp;P, and chopped parsley.<br /><br />The beets are thick-julienned and currently in some red-wine vinegar w/ a touch of olive oil, black pepper, and gray salt.<br /><br />I&#39;m going to use the beet tops for another salad of sorts - just very very loosely chopped w/ a red-wine vinaigrette.&nbsp; I like the tops better than the beets.<br /><br /><br />I&#39;ve recently been hearing some stories about other CSA&#39;s - though they aren&#39;t that close to us - that seem to be...well, I&#39;ll just say &quot;different&quot; for now.<br /><br />Anyone want to talk about their opinions of the CSA thus far?

				I would love to hear what people&#39;s opinions are of the CSA, but perhaps we should start another thread that is specific to that topic?

				I made a particularly tasty quick and easy beet recipe today, as an accompaniment to some interesting fried fish (watch my blog for more about that soon!), and I thought I&#39;d post it here.<br /><br /><strong>Vinegared Beets Nested in Their Greens</strong><br />from <em>Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone</em>, Deborah Madison<br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>1 bunch small beets with their greens</li><li>2 t butter</li><li>salt and pepper</li><li>1 t balsamic or sherry vinegar</li></ul><br />1. Remove and reserve all but 1&quot; of the the greens, scrub the beets, and if larger than 1&quot; across, cut into halves or quarters. Steam until tender, 20 minutes or so. Let cool, then peel and put in a small pan.<br />2. Discard the beet stems and rinse the leaves. Steam until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain, then toss with 1 t butter, salt, and pepper. Arrange on 2 plates.<br />3. Heat the beets with 1 t butter, add the vinegar and shake the pan until reduced. Put the beets on the greens and serve.<br /><br />2 servings.<br />

				Harlan, thanks for sharing the Pasta with Fava Beans recipe. I made it the other day and it was very good! I agree, though, that it&#39;s probably not the best dish to show off the fava beans in all their glory. But we enjoyed it!<br /><br />When I lived in Ecuador, I had fava beans as a yummy snack - habas as they&#39;re known there. They sell them dried and salted, with another soft yellow-ish round bean-type thing called chochitos. &quot;Habitas y chochitos,&quot; the women vendors would call out. Yum! I would have no idea how to dry them properly though.
