				<br />In April my boyfriend and I moved into a beautiful 2br apartment in a small 2 family home the ditmars area. The landlords asked us to sign a 6 month lease, and the broker encouraged us to do so. We were told the owners had a string of atrocious tenants who did terrible things to the property, and as a result now always ask new tenants to do a 6 month lease as a &quot;trial period&quot; to protect themselves from similar situations. We were told that they were looking for a stable couple who would occupy the house long-term. We were also told that in the future the landlords might want to sell the property. We agreed to the 6 months. <br /><br />We were awfully naive and dumb. 2.5 months after moving in the owners put the house on craigslist and are most likely going to sell it within the next month. (As a side note, they&#039;re asking a ridiculously high price and are probably going to get it... )<br /><br />So now it looks like we may have to move in September. We are very upset, having spent so much on moving costs, plus the broker fee, AND being uprooted so soon, and of course, smarting from the consequences of being naive and dumb. <br /><br />The question I have is - does anyone think we might have a shot negotiating a deal with the broker? It was someone highly recommended on this site, and our experience was so very positive, I&#039;m wondering if we approach her in the right way would she be willing to have mercy? Any suggestions on what to ask or how to approach her?<br /><br />I know this is a &quot;buyer beware&quot; situation, in general brokers and the owners are totally in bed together and the tenant/renter often gets screwed, and she has no reason to do anything for us, but it&#039;s just not fair. This was the first apartment she showed us, and the whole deal was taken care of in less than 2 hrs spread over the course in total (the night we saw the apt, and the day we signed the lease and forked over our money.) She hardly did any work and now we will have to go through the same thing all over again.<br /><br /><br />I know we don&#039;t have a leg to stand on, and we certainly learned our lesson, but i just thought I&#039;d put the question to see what everyone thinks.<br /><br />Thank you!

				That sucks, although I don&#039;t see why the new owner wouldn&#039;t let you sign a longer lease? That seems like a reasonable thing to do, or at least let you sign another 6 month lease until you find something else? Would they ask you to move? For what? Are they bringing friends to occupy the rest of the house? Cross your fingers :) <br /><br />Also, I don&#039;t think the broker might have anything to do with this. Unless the landlord went through them to sell the building, in which case, start being super nice. I do think that it would be to your benefit if they did. The broker already &quot;knows&quot; you, and might save the new owners the hassle of finding new tenants. <br /><br />All the best!

				thanks for the encouragement!<br /><br />We just don&#039;t know what the next months will bring. If we&#039;re lucky, the new owners will be thrilled to have preexisting tenants and will not change a thing. Best case scenario: they won&#039;t raise our rent, will continue to let us use the backyard which we currently have full use of (we planted a great vegetable garden and put a lot of love into it,) and they&#039;ll stay more out of our way than the current owners who don&#039;t even live here, but are in our business all the time. <br /><br />Worst case scenario: the new owners either want to raise the rent, or they want to convert this place back to a 1 family home, if they have kids or something. <br /><br />Who knows, really, it could work out just fine, but we need to be prepared to pack up and move in just 3 months. The added stress of coming up with moving expenses for the SECOND time in one year is grating on my nerves. <br /><br />let&#039;s hope for the best!!!

				Hopefully, they won&#039;t get their ridiculously high asking price.<br /><br />And if I had to move out after only six months, I would tear that place up.&nbsp;

				It might be worthwhile to see if the broker knew that they were planning to market the place so quickly when he/she showed you the place.&nbsp; It&#039;s a long shot but may help.<br /><br />When I first moved here (was naive as well) I took a basement apartment in a house and even asked the broker if it was a legal apartment and was told that it was.&nbsp; What a shock four months later when ConEd came to check something out and started asking a lot of questions.&nbsp; Shortly after that I was told by my landlord that the place was zoned as a &quot;storage space&quot; and I had to move out.&nbsp; They (the landlord) not only gave me back all the rent I had paid (when I threatened legal action for being misled) but I actually went back to the broker and was able to get back the fee I paid to them since they knowingingly put me in that situation.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if this will work in your situation but figured it was worth throwing out there.<br /><br />Good luck and please keep up posted on what happens!

				Make them evict you.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just say to them &quot;if you want me out, throw me out.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;You spent money on a broker&#039;s fee and then six months later you have to go through the whole process again?&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;d just say &quot;I&#039;m not moving and if you want me out please feel free to initiate legal proceedings.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; They will probably eventually get you out of there, but not without a lot of expense, anxiety and time spent on their part.&nbsp; &nbsp;You could also negotiate with the old landlord/new landlord for them to pay your broker&#039;s fee/moving fee in order to get you to move.

				I don&#039;t think there is much you can do. To buy a house does take some time so the 6-month lease could run out by then. I think you&#039;ll just have to wait and see what the new owner does. If the new owner is planning on moving into your apartment, there&#039;s really not much you can do since it&#039;s a house.<br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br />

				If it&#039;s a private house, it&#039;s unregulated and the landlords can do what they want.<br />i found myself in a sticky situation recently with the power supply to our apartment. it basically boiled down to if we wanted it fixed we either pay for it ourselves or move out. this would be 3 days before our official move in.<br />the tenant advisor told us that as a private house we had no recourse but to choose from the 2 poopie options.
