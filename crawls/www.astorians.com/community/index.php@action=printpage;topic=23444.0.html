				Dear Families,<br /><br />I just wanted to let you know about some free Music for Aardvarks trial classes being held this and next week. I&#039;ve included dates and locations, as well as a program description below. You&#039;re welcome to drop by any of the classes below. If you have questions, please feel free to email me at info@musicforqueens.com.<br /><br />Thanks so much!<br />Allison Tartaglia<br />Director<br />Music for Queens<br />http://www.musicforqueens.com<br /><br />FREE TRIAL CLASSES<br /><br />Astoria Fine Arts<br />38-01 23rd Avenue<br />Astoria, NY 11105<br />Monday, September 10 at 9:30, 10:30, 11:30<br />Friday, September 14 at 9:30, 10:30<br /><br />Queensview Coops<br />21-50 33rd Road<br />Astoria, NY 11106<br />Wednesday, September 12 at 9:30, 10:30, 11:30<br /><br />Steinway Reformed Church<br />21-65 41st Street<br />Astoria, NY 11105<br />Saturday, September 15 at 9:30, 10:30<br /><br />Music for Aardvarks is a refreshing alternative to the traditional music<br />class for kids. The program was created in 1997 in Brooklyn, NY by rock<br />musician/composer and father of three, David Weinstone. Music for<br />Aardvarks is distinct from other children&#039;s music programs in that all<br />classes are based around Mr. Weinstone&#039;s original songs, rhythms, and<br />chants. With influences of rock, blues, ballads, folk, jazz and pop,<br />Aardvark songs uniquely reflect and celebrate the lives of children<br />growing up today. The music is innovative, intelligent, and irresistibly<br />appealing to both kids and their parents. Our informal, spirited classes<br />are geared toward children 3 months to 5 years old and incorporate<br />singing, dancing, musical storytelling, instrumental jam sessions and<br />more. It&#039;s an interactive musical experience that the whole family can<br />genuinely get excited about! For more information, please visit<br />http://www.musicforqueens.com<br /><br />-$35 discount if you register through September 15!<br />-Tuition includes a free CD. Each semester is a new CD and new set of original songs.<br />-Extremely flexible makeup policy-make up missed classes at any Music for Queens location!<br />-All of our teaching artists sing and accompany themselves on guitar during class. Many of our instructors are also available for private instruction for students 5 and up. Just ask!<br /><br />“It&#039;s no exaggeration to say that Weinstone has changed the musical geography of kids music. As creator of the MFA classes that take place all over the country, his music has gotten thousands of tiny toes tapping.” – Time Out NY Kids
