				Hi everyone... we are thinking of moving to Astoria from Manhattan sometime next year. We have a 4 yo who will be starting kindergarten and (yikes) 6 mo old twin boys. What are good and bad things about living in Astoria with young children? Where are the best places to live-- near playgrounds, stores, and schools. My husband will be commuting into lower Manhattan and I&#039;ll be staying home with the rugrats.<br /><br />thanks for any thoughts, and have a great day<br />Courtney

				I like where I am - near the last stop on the train.&nbsp; <br /><br />I always get a seat on the train and it&#039;s a relatively quick ride to midtown.<br /><br />Immaculate Conception School, PS 85 and PS 122 are within walking distance.<br /><br />Key Food and CVS are right by the train stop so you can grab groceries on the way home. <br /><br />Lots of kid-friendly restaurants like Zorbas, Igloo, Pizza Palace, etc.<br /><br />Public library a block from the train<br /><br />Several good pediatricians nearby including Astoria Pediatrics which has evening hours for working parents.<br /><br />Nearby parks include Astoria Park which has the pool (fun in the summer), Steinway park with a sprinkler, and several others.<br /><br />Steinway Reformed Church hosts lots of classes for young ones including art, dance and music.<br /><br />The Rock gym is right by the train and has free childcare.<br /><br />Checkout YahooGroups to find a couple that focus on parents in Astoria - you&#039;ll find they&#039;re very friendly and full of advice.<br /><br />Welcome!

				Welcome! I can&#039;t speak to any positives/negatives for older kids, since my son is only 8 months old, but so far Astoria has been a wonderful area to be a new mother. Everything we need is easily within reach, and the sense of community is wonderful (we often feel like we&#039;re living in a small town, in the best sense).<br /><br />So far I don&#039;t have any negative experiences to report... in fact, since we&#039;ve become parents we&#039;ve made the decision to buy in Astoria and settle down permanently.<br /><br />I&#039;d recommend that you check out the Astoria Stay-at-home Moms Meetup group (http://www.meetup.com/ASAHMGroup/), though it&#039;s not just for SAHM&#039;s. They have plenty of great activities and I&#039;ve met loads of lovely families that way.<br /><br />Good luck with your move! And with those 6-month-old twins... I can only imagine how challenging that must be!

				From one fairly new resident to one soon to be - welcome.&nbsp; My son (19) and I LOVE Astoria.&nbsp; It is one of the most exciting places I have ever lived in my life - and I&#039;ve been lots of places on the east coast of US. (including Miami)&nbsp; You will find MANY little ones around the neighborhoods, walking, in strollers, etc.&nbsp; It is a kid friendly place.<br /><br />Wherever you choose, please know that Trinity Lutheran (my parish) located at 31st Avenue and 37th Street offers a Toddlers Playgroup - just parents (usually Moms) and their kids coming to the church to play together.&nbsp; Kids do what kids do best and the parents have coffee and cookies and exchange stories/ideas.<br /><br />There is no fee for this program (though if folks want to make donations to help pay for refreshments that is always welcome). You also don&#039;t have any pressure about joining the parish - though expect Pastor Paul (me) to be down there playing with kids and talking to the parents and offering - if folks want - my pastoral services - but absolutely NO pressure.<br /><br />We will open up again in early October.&nbsp; Most likely Oct. 12.&nbsp; Our coordinator (with a preschooler of her own) will be having another child in early September.<br /><br />Feel free to check us out, and blessings upon your intended move.&nbsp; Hope you find the right &quot;fit&quot; for you and your family!<br /><br />Peace<br />Pastor Paul<br />Trinity Lutheran Church<br />Long Island City/Astoria<br />The Welcome Place

				Dear Courtney,<br /><br />The biggest challenge - for me - is that Astoria Park is relatively far away ... unless you live near Ditmars stop (on N line). We live near Broadway (train stop), and it takes me 30 minutes or longer to walk over there with a stroller ... I love Astoria Park with all my heart, but in this heat and humidity it is not the kind of walk I am willing to do often ... Another challenge: playgrounds. There are plenty of them in Astoria but some of them are simpy scary like the one under Astoria Blvd train stop (too many dirty men sleeping on the grounds!), and some of them are simply too small and overcrowded (like the one near our apartment, on 38th Street between Broadway and 31 Avenue). Your best bet when it comes to playgrounds is to go to private gated playgrounds at Queensview North and South, but I can tell you from experience that boys (I have a boy) get bored very quickly with the simple playground equipment installed at those 2 private playgrounds. That is a challenge, too.<br /><br />Other than that, Astoria is great. I&#039;ve been living here for the past 8 years, my son was born in December 2007; this September he will be going to a local nursery school, and, of course, I can&#039;t predict future but for now we are staying put ... :-) Yes, there are supermarkets everywhere and fruit &amp; vegetable stands that offer amazing choices of fresh fruit and vegetables from all over the world throughout the entire year. There are good restaurants, excellent wine shops, amazing bakeries where &quot;everyone knows your name&quot;. As far as children-centric activities go, there are plenty. There are playgroups like the one that Pastor Paul mentioned, but there are also &quot;mommy and me&quot; classes that prepare children (and moms/dads!) for entry to a nursery school; there are music &amp; art classes, free events in Astoria Park and in Socrates Sculpture Park ... let me know if you need information on any of those and I will be happy to elaborate further.

				Waltz cafe is a winner for families - located on lower Ditmars. It&#039;s focus is music &amp; community gatherings. there is always a performance going on. The owner, whose name is Song, is an asset to our community; she has given families and young artists a warm and friendly place to convene and share their art. I believe she even arranges music lessons for youngsters but you&#039;ll need to doublecheck on that. At the very least they can refer people to area educators in music.<br /><br />Fatty&#039;s cafe is a great place to eat with the family for sunday brunch...though it turns into a bar at night, it is still very friendly to families during reasonable evening hours.<br /><br />Wednesday night is movie night in astoria park, and they have concerts as well (more for the senior set).<br /><br />Mamie Fay school is one of the best in the city. <br /><br />Basically any neighborhood this greek is very family friendly! Family is what the Greeks do best!

				I&#039;ve lived in Astoria all of my life and it is very family friendly, with lots of playgrounds, restaurants and shopping everywhere. Close to the city, close to Brooklyn, close to tri-boro bridge. You can get the best of both worlds by looking at apartments in Queensview or Boulevard Gardens - same neighborhood but you&#039;re in a complex with grass, gardens and lots of amenities.<br /><br />

				Elancoln,<br /><br />There&#039;s a good park on 38th street between 31st avenue and Broadway, complete with sprinklers. I live near the park on Astoria Blvd, and honestly, it&#039;s not that bad. I&#039;ve taken my 1 year old there a few times, and never really noticed any homeless.

				I also have 6 month old twin boys , so i share your workload lol . Its not easy&nbsp; &nbsp;and with a 4 yr old on top of it&nbsp; , u must totally have your hands full . Both me and my wife work fulltime and our kids are not in daycare . We are lucky enough that my schedule is very flexible , so i work afternoons while my wife gets home right before i jump on the train . Its def not easy , but that&#039;s life .&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m born and raised in Astoria my entire life ,&nbsp; and i can totally say this place has changed . Some for the better , some for the worse .&nbsp; The reason i say that is cuz alot of new and exciting places have opening thru the yrs&nbsp; , making Astoria more fun to live in . Great food places , lounges and bars are all around . But its gotten very congested&nbsp; ,&nbsp; if you drive ,parking is very hard&nbsp; esp on the days the sweepers come .&nbsp; For me&nbsp; a garage is a must&nbsp; or ill be looking for spots for hours with the time i get home from work sometimes .&nbsp; <br />The main problem i have with Astoria is the schools though .&nbsp; Elementary is&nbsp; good , esp&nbsp; on the Ditmars area which is by far the best to live on .&nbsp; Ps 122 is a very good school ,&nbsp; upper Ditmars ps2 is also a fine school . After that i wouldn&#039;t know where to begin&nbsp; though .&nbsp; Jr highschools like 141&nbsp; have really declined thru the yrs .&nbsp; After the bell rings and the kids get out&nbsp; it looks like a warzone .&nbsp; Cops all over the place ,&nbsp; fights&nbsp; , kids cursing their way up the street (and these are only 11-12 yr olds )&nbsp; &nbsp;Sorry to sound so negative&nbsp; but i see this every day .&nbsp; &nbsp;Private schools like SJP cost an arm and a leg and&nbsp; in the end i dont think you get too much of an education to dish out 25k per kid for 4 yrs each .&nbsp; &nbsp;Lic is totally ghetto and academically just terrible .&nbsp; &nbsp;No way i would send my kids to any of those schools&nbsp; after they finish elementary here .

				Hi Thanos,<br /><br />I hope you get a chance to check out Immaculate Conception School.&nbsp; It&#039;s not expensive (in fact I can&#039;t believe how cheap it is) and one of the things I love about it is that the kids are extremely well behaved.&nbsp; Not in an oppressive way, but they are all truly good kids who go out of their way to help the younger ones, be polite to adults, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp; I send my daughter there.&nbsp; At first, it was because they have great test scores and offered an afterschool program (we needed daycare with our schedules), but now we keep her there because of the wonderful atmosphere.&nbsp; I know she is well cared for and that&#039;s what matters most.<br /><br />I know - I sound like an ad, and I apologize, but I truly believe in this school.&nbsp; And if it&#039;s not for you - then there are other good charter schools in the area.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard a lot of good things about Growing Up Green, etc.&nbsp;
