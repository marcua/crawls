				OK so I know the political commentary on south park has kind of fallen to the way side, but last nights episode was over the top.&nbsp; Seeing those little boys play that video game, get all pimplefaced just to beat this big unknown fat loser was so funny.&nbsp; I like to play video games but not like this. I think my favorite line in the episode was when the guys who created the game said something like &quot;we don&#39;t have an account in this game we have lives.&quot;&nbsp; Go South Park... Welcome Back!

				I just loved how they nailed all the details of the role-playing comuter game world.&nbsp; Cartman&#39;s strategy of &quot;hiding in the woods and killing boars,&quot; even though &quot;they only have like two experience points each,&quot; brought me back instantly to a certain time and place in my past.&nbsp; Amazing how South Park can do that sometimes.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				OMG, I hardly ever watch SP, but was totally sucked into this episode last night. I can&#39;t even relate to that level of gaming addiction, but I was LMAO.&nbsp; :lol:<br /><br />Every time they showed the 40-something perp at his computer, totally blase, and his character dancing around like one of the Village People, I just lost it. Hell, I&#39;m cracking up right now just thinking about it!!<br /><br />That episode was genius. I could watch a whole season of them at this game!!

				I&#39;ve actually never seen a full episode of SP until I saw this one on the &#39;net the other night. That was classic. Wow.
