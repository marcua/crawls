				Aah, sublime decadence! Don&#039;t know where it can be purchased locally (perhaps downtown-Village?), however here are some interesting reads and on-line sources for the green goddess, the queen of poisons:<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/12/arts/12conn.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1<br />http://oxygenee.com/<br />http://feeverte.net/<br /><br />Check out this NIN video &quot;The Perfect Drug&quot; to get you in the mood:<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAuL6Z26fW8<br /><br />Not sure if Trent was an absinthe fan (his addiction was heroin, alcohol) but it is featured here.

				This article (http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/05/dining/05absi.html?scp=5&amp;sq=absinthe&amp;st=cse) from the NY Times profiles two of the four types of absinthe that Sherry Lehmann (http://www.sherry-lehmann.com/wines.asp) carries - they are on Park and 59th, convenient to Astoria. (To pull up their list of absinthe, type absinthe into the search box on the left.)<br /><br />Here are some interesting takes on the new absinthes:<br /><br />http://buyabsinthe.wordpress.com/2007/05/28/absente-absinthe/<br />http://buyabsinthe.wordpress.com/category/lucid-absinthe/<br />http://czechabsinthe.wordpress.com/tag/lucid-absinthe/<br />http://buyabsinthe.wordpress.com/category/swiss-absinthe/<br /><br />Finally, the absinthe buyers&#039; guide (http://czechabsinthe.wordpress.com/buy-absinthe/).

				As I mentioned, Marilyn Manson&#039;s (award-winning) absinthe: Mansinthe. <br /><br />This page (http://www.mansinthe.com/) has a link to where to buy in the USA. May not be local, but would be a good conversation piece!

				I&#039;ve only bought absinthe while abroad. As a general guide, I would say<br /><br />-do your homework on some of the sites around that have already been suggested. <br /><br />-go for a darker, more natural looking green over a neon or lime green<br /><br />-learn how to drink it (whether you do the Czech or the French style)<br /><br />

				Is it really that amazing? Or is it just a strong-flavored liqueur, like Sambuca? Or Vicks Formula 44-D? Is it some kind of special high?&nbsp; :?<br /><br />EDIT: Never mind, just read the article. Very interesting!

				I drank something over the summer called &quot;Lucid&quot; that a friend swore was the same absinthe you get in Europe.&nbsp; He found it at a liquor store on the Jersey Shore.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t seen it&nbsp; around here at all though.

				I picked up a bottle of Lucid, and will be sampling it on Halloween.&nbsp; I&#039;ll let you all know how it goes, though from what I understand, most if not all of the &quot;secondary effects&quot; of absinthe are myths and exaggerations. :)

				Opened up the absinthe on Halloween.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t really green - more of a pale, vaguely greenish milky -cloudy color.&nbsp; I found it very tasty, but not something I wanted to drink a whole lot of at once.&nbsp; I did, however, experience something I&#039;d read about - a remarkably clear-headed drunkenness.&nbsp; I could feel the physical effects of the alcohol, but my mind still seemed very clear, which was kind of cool.<br /><br />
