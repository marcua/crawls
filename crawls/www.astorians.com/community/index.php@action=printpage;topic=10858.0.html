				I just rented an amazing apartment with exactly how much I wanted to pay from Astoria Apartments (31st and Ditmars). I used Tasos and he was such a nice guy. I also have a co-worker who rented from Jenna. They&#039;re honest and willing to work with you. They have great relationships with many landlords in the area. Some brokers I called with a certain amount I wanted to pay for an apartment and pretty much said &quot;you can&#039;t find that with the time you need a place.&quot; But I went to Astoria Apartments and they were able to find me what I wanted. They&#039;re also open every day and late!

				I just rented an apartment through Jenna as well. All the agents I talked to in there were great . Very helpful and cheerful (Tasos was the one who helped me make a decision). I am a 23 year old full time student with no job, so it&#039;s really hard to find a landlord that is willing to put their trust in some stranger with no proof of income. Jenna was able to talk the landlord into giving the apartment to me with no questions asked.. Maybe it helped that we are both Greek. But it&#039;s true that the agents really have great relationships with the landlords. The apartments Jenna took me to see were all great places with more than reasonable prices. I would definitely recommend Astoria Apartments! And as for this being my first post, I actually found out about this site through Jenna. Anyway, it was a good experience, nice clean office, and very quick!!

				So are the good folks over at Astoria Apartments telling their clients to post about their business after they find them a place?&nbsp; I guess that would explain the numerous &quot;one and done&quot; postings.&nbsp;

				Just want to put in my two cents. i have no idea if the previous ones were fake postings or not, but I&#039;ve been living for about 3 weeks now in a really great apartment, and it was the first one I saw through Astoria Apartments. John was my broker and he was very nice, punctual and things moved along very quickly. It&#039;s a pet-friendly fairly large 2 bedroom (well, really a 1 bedroom with a large kitchen/dining room), 1st floor, with a really nice backyard/garden with not one but TWO trees for $1650/mo... I was amazed that it was the first place I was shown.<br /><br />anyway I would definitely tell people to give it a look as the owner guy seems to really know his business (though he was a little bit pushy).<br /><br /><br />

Im just saying.. Apparently the previous tenant was pure American and there was no problem. Don&#039;t twist words around people. I said maybe it helped.. Didn&#039;t say it was the reason i got the apartment. Learn to read before making smart ass comments. And as for recommending people to Astoria Apartments, I could care less who goes or who doesn&#039;t go.. who finds an apartment or who lives on the streets. All I know is they found me a good place real quick. I figured they were nice to me so i&#039;ll write a good comment about them. Honestly you people are ridiculous. OMG THIS MUST BE THE PEOPLE THAT WORK THERE!!!! Seriously guys, get a life.<br /><br />Anybody looking for an apartment? Just go to your nearest real estate agent..

				We are aware of the multiple one time post recommendations, especially from Astoria Apartments, and those we can prove come from the same IP address are being dealt with accordingly.&nbsp; We invite businesses to advertise here, but ask that they do so openly and in the appropriate sections.&nbsp; Please refrain from letting your posts get too personal.&nbsp; It is a violation of board rules.&nbsp; &nbsp;Likewise, please do take care not to assume that all one time posts about Astoria Apartments are bogus.&nbsp; Some will most definitely be legitimate endorsements.&nbsp; Thanks so much!<br /><br />Daisy<br />Moderator

				Well... is Astoria Apartments really that good? I want to know from someone who has rented through them instead of someone who might work there. Hell, if I can get a discount on a broker&#039;s fee, then I might consider advertising for them myself. Any other suggestions on brokers? I really want to move to Astoria from all the great things I&#039;ve heard and read on this site. And yes, I just registered on here today, I&#039;m not promoting anyone... yet. Let me know if you have had any good experiences with anyone!
