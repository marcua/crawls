				Hi all,<br /><br />I am a first year graduate student at Queens College.&nbsp; I am studying to become a certified school psychologist.&nbsp; Part of my coursework requires me to do a number of interviews and tests/surveys/questionnaires.&nbsp; Sometimes professors assign us interviews with parents, sometimes with children.&nbsp; <br /><br />I really need families that are willing to volunteer a small amount of their time.&nbsp; For example an upcoming assignment I have is to administer a full academic assessment (math and reading) of a school age child (2nd to 8th grade).&nbsp; I have done a number of these last semester and both the kids and parents found it beneficial.&nbsp; <br /><br />By the way, I live on 28th Ave and 44th St in Astoria.&nbsp; We can meet at the local library or wherever is most convenient for you. <br /><br />Feel free to ask any questions you have here on the forum or contact me directly if you are interested.&nbsp; <br /><br />capuchin79@gmail.com<br />516-993-5524<br /><br />Thanks!!!<br /><br />-Greg S.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />

				I should also mention, this doesn&#039;t have to be completely volunteer! <br /><br />As a student, I don&#039;t have that much money to spare, but I&#039;d be happy to provide an equal amount of time doing whatever you need (i.e. shoveling snow, tutoring your child (I have 5+ years experience in education), etc.) <br /><br />

				Hello Everyone!<br /><br />OK...unfortunately I haven&#039;t had much luck finding willing participants for the interviews required by my classes so I&#039;ve decided to loosen the purse strings.&nbsp; I am willing to pay $30 for what should amount to about 2 hours (give or take) of your time.&nbsp; This is what I need to do for this assignment:<br /><br />1. Take a full developmental history of your child (questions like &quot;When was his first word? When did he starting walking? etc.)<br /><br />2. Do an interview to gather information about your child&#039;s adaptive behavior.&nbsp; Adaptive behaviors are behaviors that help an individual to take care of him/herself and get along with others.&nbsp; So there are questions about communication, daily living skills, socialization, and motor skills.&nbsp; <br /><br />3. Last I need about a 1/2 hour to speak with your child and conduct a primary interview.&nbsp; Basically, I&#039;ll ask questions about interests, feelings towards school/teachers, friends, very routine stuff.<br /><br />So if anyone would like a little extra cash and really help out a busy graduate student, call me or reply! I pay cash.&nbsp; Also keep in mind that whatever you tell me is strictly confidential (you don&#039;t have to give me your last name or anything anyways). I&#039;ll keep it brief and professional and will really appreciate it!<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />Greg<br />516-993-5524<br />capuchin79@gmail.com

				Have you considered sending letters asking for help to some of the local churches and community groups?&nbsp; I would go to places with large numbers of children - you might have a bigger target audience (though there are many posters with children on Astorians.com).<br />

				That&#039;s a great idea.&nbsp; My whole point in posting on astorians.com was so I could keep it local.&nbsp; Thanks!

				Hi!&nbsp; I&#039;d be happy to help you and you don&#039;t need to pay me.&nbsp; My kids are 9, 6.5, 2.5 and 8 weeks old.&nbsp; Feel free to reply here, privately or via AIM (Worfanddax).<br /><br />-Sandra

				My daughter is too young for your current study, but I&#039;d be willing to help out on future projects if they&#039;re appropriate.

				Thanks to everyone who has replied to my post.&nbsp; Although I&#039;ve had about 15+ practice administrations to do this semester, its actually looking like I&#039;m going to pull it off! Thanks!<br />&nbsp;
