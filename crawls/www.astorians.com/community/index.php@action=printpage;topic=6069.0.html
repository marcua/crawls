He criticized the severance package awarded to former Home Depot Inc. Chief Executive Officer Robert Nardelli in January as a ``$210 million good-bye kiss.&#039;&#039; <br /><br />There isn&#039;t a uniform, legal right for shareholders to vote on pay packages, Frank said. The legislation ``will strengthen the hands of those in the corporate world who have been trying to slow this down,&#039;&#039; he said. <br /><br />Investor advocates have pressed companies to allow shareholders to vote on pay, which they say has gotten out of hand. Median pay for chief executive officers of U.S. companies rose 9.3 percent to $2 million in 2006, according to the Corporate Library, a corporate-governance research firm-based in Portland, Maine. <br /><br />...
