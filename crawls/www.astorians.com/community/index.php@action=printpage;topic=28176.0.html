				There seems to be something going on at the space that used to be a pizza place on 38th and Ditmars.&nbsp; I heard it might be an italian rest? Any details?

				No, Alba&#039;s is 37th. It was a short lived pizza place, I think called Rosarios.

It took them almost two years to develop and open up, and I think it was closed in less than 6 weeks.

				My husband asked one of the workers, who said it was going to be [another] pizza place. Haven&#039;t we reached the saturation point with those on Ditmars already? They&#039;re still going to have some stiff competition. Still, I&#039;ll take just about anything over a shuttered storefront. And at least it&#039;s not a bank, cell phone store, or nail salon!

				I agree that there is far more sushi and they seem to all be sustainable for the most part.&nbsp; Albas and Tuffino are very different and if this new place is not like either, it could work.&nbsp; There&#039;s another popular place up in the shopping center but I think that caters more to people who look for a parking lot and who go out by car.&nbsp; There are also a lot of homes between Ditmars and 20th and to the garden style apartments up near the airport.&nbsp; These businesses on Ditmars closer to Steinway probably serve all those people.&nbsp; What is curious to me is how Pizza Palace stays open.&nbsp; It&#039;s not very good pizza and the place is stuck in the 70s.&nbsp; It looks so out of place at this point.&nbsp; More like Coney Island.

				I stand corrected- it doesn&#039;t look look there&#039;s enough room for a large amount of seating in the place for a more &quot;restauranty&quot; type of place. Two big counters in the space. Which I think might have been a downfall for the first one. Unless you plan on making all your money on deliveries and pickups. And people generally already have their favorites for that. If you can&#039;t change their mind in one go, no repeat customers. I hope they can make it work for at least a bit longer than the last place. I&#039;ll try them once they&#039;re settled in and they work the bugs out. But if they don&#039;t knock my socks off, it will be back to my usuals

				I don&#039;t like the way the outside looks.&nbsp; It looks old fashioned.&nbsp; I dont&#039; understand why they have the roll down gates inside of the windows.&nbsp; I never saw anything like that before

				I looked inside and saw that it is mostly counterspace and it still looks like a pizzeria.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think there will be much room for seating
