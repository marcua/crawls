				Good question. Avoid Key Foods, of course. Mediterreanean Foods II, on 31st near 23rd Ave, has a selection of nuts in large (2-pound?) packages that are relatively fresh and inexpensive. When you walk in the door, they&#039;re all the way on the right, toward the back. If you&#039;re on 14th St. in the city, Trader Joes off of 3rd Ave often has good prices on nuts. For bad prices but a great and eclectic selection, try Kalustyan&#039;s on Lex and 23rd...

				The little grocery under the Ditmars station has some nuts in bulk.&nbsp; I buy pine nuts there.&nbsp; I always buy so little that price is not so much an issue, so I&#039;m not sure of overall prices&nbsp; But it would be worth checking into.

				If you are in Jackson Heights (convenient for you if you are near the V or R -- take train 4 stops from Steinway St. to 74th/Roosevelt)<br />there are several Indian grocers that sell very cheap nuts in large-size packages.&nbsp; I think the price for a 4 pound bag of almonds is $14, which makes it $3.50 per pound.&nbsp; they also have pistachios and other nuts, but I&#039;ve only checked the price on almonds.<br /><br />The big three are Patel Brothers, Apna and Subzi Mandi.&nbsp; Addresses linked here http://www.desijacksonheights.com/grocery-stores.html

				I use Bulk Foods for my Bulk Nuts (http://www.bulkfoods.com). They have a lot of other bulk stuff there too, but their nuts are actually a pretty good deal if you can get at least 5lbs.

				There used to be a place called Sweet Nut in that odd little commercial space on the 2nd floor right off the Ditmars stop.&nbsp; They had all sorts of bulk nuts, seeds, snacks and dried fruits, as well as candies and coffee.&nbsp; I miss it, and I haven&#039;t found a good local substitute.&nbsp; Having a local place is good when all you want or need (or can afford) are small amounts. <br /><br />Bigger health food stores (I&#039;m thinking specifically of Perelandra in Brooklyn Heights, Back to the Land in Park Slope, and the (mostly) unlamented Healthy Pleasures on University) usually have a separate bulk section, and now that I think about it, I think Fresh Start has some bulk nuts and dried fruits (as well as grains) shoehorned in in back.&nbsp; I need to check out their prices.

				Its kind of far from you and you need a membership, but I think Costco on Vernon Blvd. has pretty good prices. I usually buy walnuts and pine nuts from there. 3lbs of whole walnuts were $10.69. I forget how large the pine nut bag is, but its about a pound of so for $13.89. If you know someone with a membership maybe they can pick it up for you.

				Thanks for pointing that out.&nbsp; I was wondering about that when I was typing the prices - they seemed very low.&nbsp; Making the per-unit price 1/4 or 1/2 lb. is actually very common around the city; it wouldn&#039;t prevent me from shopping there for those items if I needed them.

				Yeah, I have seen that type of pricing elsewhere as well. For whatever reason their &quot;1/2lb&quot; writing is so small that it gives me the impression they are trying to keep people from noticing. That being said I do buy lots of veggies and other stuff there - just not bulk items, but that&#039;s probably because I&#039;m buying stuff in 5lb bags that last a really long time. :)

				I have purchase nuts in most of the above.&nbsp; I find however, that the least expensive nuts are at Costco.&nbsp; They are by far the cheapest.&nbsp; I use lots of nuts in my baking and especially for pecans, pinenuts and almonds, no one beats Costco.

				Well, now that it&#039;s close to Thanksgiving, Key Food has a lot of nuts for sale.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s been disparaged already, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s that bad.&nbsp; There are quite a bit of nuts all over that store, and lots in the front on sale now.&nbsp; I would have bought some but I didn&#039;t want to crack them all open.

				I&#039;d like to revive this topic. I&#039;m looking for nuts as well, but not necessarily in &#039;bulk&#039; but&nbsp; I&#039;m not feeling the expensive packaged nuts I&#039;ve been seeing. I also don&#039;t want salted nuts. Mr. Peanut is not my friend. I&#039;m looking for pine nuts, sliced almonds, but my biggest issue is shelled sunflower seeds. i dont know if thats the right term, but im looking for seed with no shell, and NOT salted. <br /><br />I&#039;m making granola :)

				Med Market on 34th just south of 30th ave is great for nuts. Not &quot;bulk&quot; but fairly inexpensive and good. Some interesting mixed nuts (salted and non) too. Greek House on 30th ave just west of 33rd st also has a similar selection. Sai Organics has bulk nuts, but they&#039;re pretty expensive, though great quality. But yes, Costco has the best deals around.

				Mediterranean food on 34th st off 30th ave was AWESOME! thanks for the suggestion! I finally got a chance to stop in there tonite, (before dinner at opa .... mmmm lamb....) and I was happily surprised with their selection. I got my sunflower seeds and chopped almonds, and I was <em>very</em> tempted to buy the hazelnuts, and while $7 for what I assume was 1lb seems reasonable, I didn&#039;t want to spend that much right then. My boyfriend was SUPER happy because he got his shelled pumpkin seeds that he&#039;s been wanting for like 2 weeks. My only disappointment was that they didn&#039;t have pine nuts, but for all I know they might not be in season ... if nuts are something that grow in season .... I&#039;m going back on payday for those hazelnuts and some olives!!! The olives looked delicious!!

				That new Bulgarian owned grocery store &quot;Parrot&quot; something or other has bulk nuts and the prices seem very reasonable.

				I happened to find a nice selection of smaller qty packaged nuts closer to home, at &#039;smiley&#039;s deli&#039; or something on 46st between queens blvd and greenpoint. I got hazelnuts there, the package says &#039;filbert&#039; but whatever they&#039;re hazelnuts. about 2 handfuls of nuts $2.80, it says $8.49/lb, which is more expensive than met. foods, but since I didn&#039;t need whole lbs this worked well for me. AND they had pine nuts :)
