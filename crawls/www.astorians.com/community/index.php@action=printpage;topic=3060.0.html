				okay so having met George (mister hell gate social himself) and having seen the actual venue twice now (once at night, once at happy hour) i&#39;m convinced that this place deserves at least one evening of f*g**try per week for the astoria &#39;mos!<br /><br />so given they want to get some gay happy hour thing started George is willing to do us happy hour deals from 7pm to 9pm this and each coming monday at his bar Hell Gate Social!<br /><br />our happy hour will consist of $4 bottled beers, martinis and well drinks - they have quite an impressive list of wines by the glass too and they&#39;re all under $10...actually the most expensive wine by the glass is $8 and rest clock in somewhere at $6 - and you KNOW for a big wineo (like me) that&#39;s more than enough reason to have a few glasses!<br /><br />http://www.hellgatesocial.com/<br /><br />you have got to see this place to believe it....the bathroom sink alone is quite the conversation piece:) but you&#39;ll have to see it to know what i&#39;m talking about....or just go out into the rear courtyard, take your shoes off and lie back on the grass, or sit on one of the long park benches and watch the sky during sunset...and of course, smoke em if you got em out there...thats why all these stylish new places HAVE courtyards!.<br /><br />so stop by on your way home from work on Monday....and spread the word!<br /><br />get the word out to those chorus boys you know...they don&#39;t have shows on monday nights, and I know how many of them live out near us! <br /><br />use it as a reason to get more numbers into your cell phone, and feel free to invite that ambiguously gay guy who lives on the third floor - even if he&#39;s actually not gay he&#39;s still pretty nice to look at! but for god&#39;s sake, let the name of the place be a good example for ya...it&#39;s a SOCIAL people...so come and be sociable with the local &#39;mos! <br /><br />make sure you know where you&#39;re going though...remember that astoria boulevard curves around the closer you get to the park -yeah it is actully easier to get off at 30th Avenue and walk over from there...the way astoria blvd curves puts it closer to that avenue than the stop at astoria blvd. however, J2 and I have done the walk from the door of Hell Gate Social to the door of our apt, and it was about 15-20 mins and a nice walk in the evening.<br /><br />see you guys tonight around 7:00 PM!<br /><br />(and yes, feel free to forward this notice)<br /><br />--jonathan*social*blue<br />jonathanblue@earthlink.net<br />917-414-0221
