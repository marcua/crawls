				Greeting!<br /><br />This is my second year belonging to a Community Supported Agriculture group, and I thought that it would be a good idea starting a topic devoted to another side of the CSA which I feel needs to be brought more out into the open.<br /><br />There is no doubt that recipes are cool, and that the health benefits from eating organic vegetables are not very disputable. Organic food <em>tastes</em> better and we could probably all go on and on about just how excellent it does taste. This is all good. :)<br /><br />But there are other reasons why people may join a CSA. Reasons that are ideological, even political in nature. I count myself as one of those people. For me, the health and taste benefits (great though they may be) are still for me...fringe benefits. I joined the CSA for one overriding reason...and that is... it was the Right thing to do.&nbsp; One of the things that Cara (who helped bring us together) liked to talk about were the &quot;hidden costs&quot; that inevitably went along with foods that are mass produced. Apples at X-Mart may cost less...but just how costly is that cancer that may go along with the insecticides that Mass farmers use? Is rBGH&nbsp; really an option? What was that thing that farmers used to do in the way way distant past? ...something about allowing the land to lie fallow...rotation... someting........<br /><br />When we give our money to an organization, whether we like it or not, whether we know it or not, we have made a political decision. I wore Nike for many years...and then one day I found out that Nike employed child labor. Needless to say I don&#39;t patronize them anymore, because to do so may save me money in the short run but is ultimately... unequivocally... unethical. Hidden costs.<br /><br />A few people have already written posts concerning this aspect of CSA, and one person even linked an excellent article (which I will find) concerning hidden costs of mass food as well as the economic benefits of CSA and sustainable agriculture in general, including the disturbing nature of supermarkets (as experienced by the author). I hope this thread will see some action as I think it is important for us to understand <em>why</em> we do things as much as it is to understand what things we do and how we do them.<br /><br />Salutations!<br />zeno.

				You may be preaching to the choir!&nbsp; I&#39;m reading &quot;The Way We Eat&quot; right now by Peter Singer and Jim Mason.&nbsp; Every food and food source has its problems from things ranging from the CO2 emissions emitted during food transportation to the fossil fuel consumption in maintaining hot-houses so we can eat out-of-season foods.&nbsp; <br /><br />And it&#39;s even more complicated than that!!<br /><br />It&#39;s more eco-ethical to eat organic rice imported from Southeast Asia than from California because of water consumption, energy use, and land use.&nbsp; Food production, transportation, processing, preparation, and manufacturing account for AT LEAST 12% of the US energy supply.&nbsp; 11% of that is transportation alone.&nbsp; But here the real killer 26% of that is from home preparation.&nbsp; Cooking at home uses a LOT of our energy.<br /><br />But wait!&nbsp; There&#39;s more!&nbsp; Yes, CSA&#39;s keep money local and out of the hands of the multi-nationals....but we&#39;re the wealthiest nation on the planet!&nbsp; Therefore, it&#39;s more ethical to buy things like coffee from places like Kenya because they need the money more than we do.&nbsp; And if you buy it &quot;fair-trade&quot; then the money really does make it to the farmer.<br /><br />Most of the US suspect farming/rearing practices have been banned in the EU for years and they have more people in the EU than we have stateside.&nbsp; Why are they able to produce healthy food choices for reasonable prices?&nbsp; Government conspiracy?&nbsp; Most likely.<br /><br />Corn in this country is so heavily subsidized by the US government that the huge corn producers can afford to sell corn to beef/swine/chicken factory farms for BELOW PRODUCTION COST and still stay in business.&nbsp; <br /><br />Pigs, cows, chicken, and whatever other animals we eat (including fish) are eating corn in some way or other.&nbsp; This is not part of ANY of the diets of these animals (one of the reasons for the need of antibiotics.)&nbsp; This may actually be one of our biggest problems - we are a corn-based society.&nbsp; Corn syrup, corn meal, corn starch, corn oil....it&#39;s in everything!<br /><br />I&#39;m starting to think that this is at the root of the world&#39;s heal problems but that&#39;s just a fairly uneducated, conspiratorial opinion.<br /><br />Phew.
