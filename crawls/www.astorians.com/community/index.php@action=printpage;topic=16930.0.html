It used to be landlords only rented 2+ bedroom apartments to families with children. Now they are all roommates. <br /><br />Also, with the transit cuts, and the Access-A-Ride cuts, and the Metro card for students cut, I&#039;m guessing Astoria will nt longer be an attractive neighborhood to the pseudo-affluent and perhaps Astoria can go back to what it was really meant to be . . . a blue collar, lower middle class neighborhood.

				That&#039;s because most of the landlords don&#039;t live here; they live in Bayside and Long Island.<br />They just keep their property here and create the Greek neighborhood patina, which keeps the rents high.<br />Makes you wonder where all these kids from the Midwest are getting the money to live here, even if they&#039;re splitting the rents fifteen different ways. They&#039;re working at low-end service jobs or saving the world in nonprofits for 32K while they wait for their big break on Broadway--Manhattan, that is. The big break that comes on Queens&#039; Broadway is that the day laborers get picked up for sub standard wages.<br />It&#039;s all very depressing.

This was before they redid the windows, and allowed air conditioning, and had gardens. When you were not safe walking through the projects at night, and took the long way outside in the street. Astoria is a paradise compared to those days. At least these young people give the area some energy, and a bit of a buzz in the air. Is it perfect-of course not, but it could be much, much worse.

				I couldn&#039;t agree with Jess5885 and Para more!&nbsp; I also grew up in the midwest and escaped for the same reasons para described for the same life she has.<br /><br />The OP of this subthread seems to have an issue with people from the Midwest (assuming we are all hipsters from some of his previous posts).&nbsp; The thing that made me chuckle out loud though is that he listed in a previous post that he&#039;s lived in the area for 10 years.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been here for 13 and you don&#039;t see me complaining about people who have lived in the area less than me!&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;:-o

				Yes, Yes, Yes!<br />That&#039;s it!<br />It&#039;s evolving! The neighborhood is evolving! How could I have missed this after living here all these years?<br />Pushing the rents up and the wages down, turning the neighborhood into a dormslum: why, that&#039;s evolution!<br />I should move: that the answer, if I can&#039;t accept the Hispter Theory of Evolution.<br />Well, I&#039;m a fan of Reconstruction: why not stay home in Midwestern suburbia and build the place?<br />Why abandon your roots in search of fame and&nbsp; money (neither of which you&#039;ll get in NY anymore)?<br />No sense of loyalty: And you&#039;ll be outta here, too, if things get bad enough, right?<br />

				Everyone has a right to live where they want to live , say they can afford the rents /mortgages . Who is anyone to say , u should stay in the midwest or anywhere at all ? If someone from a&nbsp; small town , wants to move to Astoria they have every right to . Yea rents have gone up and home prices here are still very high&nbsp; but Astoria has grown to a very high demand place to live .&nbsp; &nbsp;As long as you are a&nbsp; good person , what does not being born in Astoria&nbsp; have to do with anything ?&nbsp; I mean were your forefathers and so on&nbsp; all born here ? Im sure they came from somewhere too . Europe , Asia,Africa , or maybe Canada even&nbsp; ?&nbsp; so someone then from here couldve told them to stay in their country&nbsp; and &quot;just try and build it up &quot;

				It&#039;s a matter of preferences, not rights. I&#039;d <em>prefer</em> it if people who came here were interested in building a life for themselves, which means, of course, setting down roots, establishing stable residences, taking an interest in the community, etc. Someone mentioned the first wave of immigrants (not the Mayflower, but the Italian and Greek version); they really built something here. What we&#039;re witnessing is a mass migration based on an urban fantasy, the result of which has been neighborhood decay.<br />Now if it were a matter of rights, shouldn&#039;t landlords have the right NOT to rent their property to unrelated individuals in favor of married couples and families?

				How do we know people that come from areas like the midwest dont want to build a life for themselves ? Im sure plenty want kids and want to get married or might even already be and have kids . Plenty of greeks and italians that were here for generations , now have moved on to places like whitestone , bayside and longisland .&nbsp; Not everyone plants their roots here for good or should . Astoria is known for having a huge greek community&nbsp; but its cant all be greek with no &quot;outsiders&quot;. By the way i am&nbsp; greek , so i feel i can say that without a problem . Oh and as a landlord if you are renting out a place , its against the law to pick and choose someone on their race creed color or handicap .&nbsp; Be cool , not everyone outside of astoria trying to get in is bad . Plenty want to come here the way your parents or grandparents did for a better life and opportunity .

				Here&#039;s how we know: They don&#039;t stay. The turnover rate among people 22-35 is amazing; the Greeks,&nbsp; Italians and other first-wave immigrants stayed for generations before they started migrating to suburbia. This is why the analogy doesn&#039;t hold: The kids who are coming here are coming f<em>rom </em>&nbsp; Suburbia and bringing with them that isolationist, Me mentality that hasn&#039;t done the suburbs any good.<br />But there is a silver lining to all this: If the landlords keep turning their properties&nbsp; into dorm rooms and rooming houses because of blind greed, nothing will be worth anyting before long. They&#039;ll get exactly what they deserve: Detroit. <br />My wife and I went looking around Astoria before we settled here: the real estate agents showed us 2 and 3 bedroom apts. that were filled with, as she described them, &quot;college kids&quot;; a pig sty,&nbsp; which is probably neater and without the empty pizza boxes and semi-used bongs, would have been more attractive to any civilized grown-up. <br />I often feel like I&#039;m in a Peanuts movie: Where are the parents? Did they leave them to rot in the icy cold of Michigan while they came here to get rich and famous?&nbsp; Lot&#039;s of luck with that, here in Bloomberg&#039;s NY. <br /><br /><br />

You also blame &#039;greedy&#039; landlords but those landlords are the same Greeks and Italians that supposedly built this neighborhood. This is a never-ending argument with no reachable concensus because there are no facts, only opinions.<br /><br />That&#039;s not right, there is one fact, a very sad one: The Greeks and Italians who built this neighborhood are also dying off (just like the German and Irish before them). How do I know this? I know it because my parents are dead and my neighbors are dead or they are very old.<br /><br />I don&#039;t like many of the changes in Astoria but not all have been bad and you have to go with the flow. For me, I miss some of the shops and many of the people but if I&#039;m honest, most weren&#039;t forced out -- they died -- that&#039;s life.<br /><br />People who come to New York do so for many reasons but mostly they come to work. In Astoria the Germans and the Irish came to work. The Italians and the Greeks did the same: to work. Now it&#039;s young 20-somethings, I know some of them and they all have jobs. Whether or not they stay is none of my business. Just like it&#039;s none of my business to judge the people (i.e., the Greeks and Italians) who moved somewhere else.<br /><br /><br />

				I may be in the minority but I like that Astoria is becoming a place for young, single professionals instead of families.&nbsp; It&#039;s because of this evolution that we get Sweet Afton, the new Beer Garden, Petey&#039;s, etc.&nbsp; Some of us like that its becoming a big dorm room and guess what, we probably make more money than you!&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait for the John B&#039;s of the hood to finally decide they can&#039;t take it anymore and leave altogether.&nbsp; The idea that we should be longing for the day that Astoria reverts back &quot;to a blue collar, lower middle class neighborhood&quot; is ridiculous.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				This subject annoys me every time I hear it whether on the site, or in person. <br /><br />I am a native New Yorker(from Queens) and decided to move to Astoria when I was 23 because I liked it, the rent was reasonable and it was a safe neighborhood. I live in a 3BR with 2 kids from the midwest, and I love it. Across the hall are 3 other 20-somethingers in a 3BR apartment also. <br />Sorry if our age &amp; means of income offends you, but we pay rent, taxes, vote, spend money in restaurants, bars and grocery stores here. Deal with it. Neither I nor my roommates have done anything to offend the neighbors here- we live our lives, go to work and spend our hard earned money just like everyone else. Sorry we&#039;re not raising a family right now, but guess what? Our local taxes still pay for your kid&#039;s schooling and neighborhood betterment.

				Another silly conversation (like the Peter Valone thread above).<br /><br />I&#039;ve lived here all my life, went to school here, now raising a family here.&nbsp; And while things change, very little of it is negative.&nbsp; The &quot;youthful energy&quot; of the community is not a bad thing...certainly brings in more new business and attention to the neighborhood.<br /><br />Yes, I can understand that people have a problem with overdevelopment.&nbsp; But that&#039;s the complete opposite of the &quot;Detroit&quot; analogy offered earlier.&nbsp; &nbsp;The development has happened because people want to live here; good neighborhood, relatively low crime, access to public transportation, good schools, etc.&nbsp; And what you&#039;re probably going to see happen over the next few years is that those same people who live here with a roomate eventually will marry someone, then move into a bigger apartments.&nbsp; Then, when they start a family, they&#039;ll look to own here.&nbsp; There are plenty of young families all around the neighborhood already in that situation; all you have to do is look around the street at any given moment.<br /><br />So unlike Detriot, NYC (and Astoria itself, by extension) benefits from more people moving in and eventually seting up roots in the community.&nbsp; That doesn&#039;t create Detroits&#039; urban blight; that creates prosperity.<br /><br />How this is somehow a &quot;bad&quot; thing is beyond me.&nbsp; Then again, if I wanted a nice quiet communities with very few young people and wide open spaces, isn&#039;t that what Florida&#039;s designed for?<br /><br /><br /><br />Again, this is a silly thread.&nbsp; Do people have nothing else to talk about than &quot;you young people get off my lawn&quot;???

				I think people are probably upset because they see themselves being priced out of the neighborhood due to the influx of more affluent people who can afford to pay more for rent and the landlords raising the rents accordingly. That may be why the older residents in this thread are so upset. As someone who was born and raised in the NYC area, it is frustrating to know that I can&#039;t afford the same lifestyle that I was raised with and I can&#039;t afford to raise my family in the way that I was raised but que sera sera. Most of the people I grew up with realized they couldn&#039;t afford the area anymore and moved away. I think there&#039;s a lot of resentment that comes with that. I don&#039;t really feel it but when I go to my old neighborhood and see so much wealth in a neighborhood that lower middle class and middle class people used to be able to own a home, have good schools, and a safe place to raise kids, it is kind of sad. Where are all those people supposed to go now to raise their families? I have a good job and there&#039;s no way I could afford to buy a house like the one I was raised in. I&#039;m just trying to explain why the people might have resentment and anger to the neighborhood changing and what they perceive as the problem.

				Of course this is a mass generalization, but I assume many of the &quot;older&quot; people in Astoria have rent-stabilized apartments. Why should someone who is paying 1/2 of market rate be angry at increased wages, increased taxes, and increased quality of life when others are footing a large part of the bill? It seems to me that the rent laws in NYC allow a neighborhood to &#039;evolve&#039; and draw in younger professionals while <em>not</em> pushing out those who are of lesser means.

				Doglover is the only insightful person on the whole board and probably in all of Astoria, except of course the Vallone Family.

				Whether people mean to or not, the fact that 20 somethings now find Astoria desirable has changed the neighborhood. The influx of people willing to pay very high rents to live in areas they deem desirable has jacked up rent prices in neighborhoods that you used to be able to afford to raise a family. The fact that in order to have the same standard of living that I had growing up means that I would have to move an hour or more from the place where I have roots and family even though I have a good job is sad. It&#039;s a different time and a different place. Places change, yes. The NYC of the past was not ideal by any means. What I really lament is the decline in the standard of living for the middle and lower middle class. I think people are taking out their anger on the fact that they are priced out of the neighborhoods that people used to be able to go to raise families. Manhattan used to be where people lived when they were of a certain age group and lifestyle and people moved to Queens, Long Island and Westchester to raise families. Now those 20 somethings are priced out of Manhattan which has been scooped up by the uber-rich and those 20 somethings who are not uber-rich but have plenty of expendible income have moved to Queens and Brooklyn. &nbsp;Long Island and Westchester are very expensive and now Queens, the last bastion of middle class affordability is going the way of Brooklyn (given, you can go further out in Queens and it is cheaper, but not by much). There really aren&#039;t any middle class enclaves anymore. I think that&#039;s more of a sign of the shifting demographics of the country in general and the shrinking of the middle class.

				I don&#039;t buy the &quot;march of history&quot; idea; that was discredited in 1989 when the Berlin Wall came down. <br />People make choices and there is nothing inevitable about local politicians like Vallone Inc. selling the neighborhood out to real estate developers, which would be resisted except that the 20 Somethings in question don&#039;t believe in neighborhoods; they revel in anonymity and they romanticize the bleakness. Why, one proudly proclaimed that she had &quot;left everyting behind&quot; in the Midwest to come to the big City. It&#039;s what motivates people that matters. Go to Jackson Heights, Flushing,&nbsp; or real immigrant communities and just about everyone who comes over here from India or Hong Kong, Colombia or wherever, wants to bring their families over. What we&#039;re dealing with here in Astoria is not that; it&#039;s self-centeredness, only the irony is that they don&#039;t yet have selves to center. They are, for the most part , little collections of trends. The Greeks and Italians and first-wave immigrants who made this place a desirable place to live lived for family and tradition and the continuity of generations, not some abstract and idiotic notion of Self.

				So because you moved to Astoria from Woodside and I moved here from the Midwest (btw - I&#039;m a man not a &quot;she&quot; as you quoted) that gives you more right to live in Astoria than I do?&nbsp; Yes, I did move to NYC to pursue a better career right of college and yes I did move to Astoria in 1997 because it fit my budget for a studio apartment that I occupied alone. Yet 13 years later, I&#039;m still here, have lived in my current apartment for the past six years, met and married my husband, know my neighbours, stop and talk to people on the streets that I&#039;ve met through Astorians.com and have established firm roots in this community.<br /><br />Could I be a more active citizen?&nbsp; Or couse!&nbsp; Everyone could be.&nbsp; But I&#039;ve actually enjoyed seeing the neighbourhood transform over the years, to see better dining options, a large movie theatre, a Best Buy within walking distance, etc.&nbsp; Evolution is what makes an area great.&nbsp; Sure there is a lot of overdevelopment (which isn&#039;t a problem specific to Astoria) but there is also a strong sense of community in Astoria which I feel you are missing as you are too busy standing on the corner with a megaphone preaching the end of the world because (GOD FORBID) someone moves here from outside the five boroughs because they want a better life for themselves and eventually their families.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m going to get a bit personal here, only because I think it&#039;s important. During the first 18 years, I lived in 14 different places. During the last 6 years I have lived here. It is the longest period of my 42 years that I have lived in one place. It is the first time in my life that I can say I truly have a home. Everyone here knows how passionate I am about that. You know about my passion regarding the ability to protect my partner on the same level that a straight couple can. You&#039;ve seen the pictures of my apartment. <br /><br />And John B is not going to take away the joy I have living here. He can rant and rave all he wants but it means nothing to me. <br /><br />For the first time in my life, I truly have a home. Here in Astoria.

Frankly, most of the people my age I know here are very intelligent, hard working and have a decent sense of community. They want to keep a safe, clean and prosperous community growing here. It seems to me that the only people here who want to ruin the community are the ones trying to create barriers between the people living here by trying to incite animosity between the old residents and new ones.

				I&#039;m a transplant from rural America (not quite the midwest, but may as well be), lived here since 1997, spent a decade before that living in a deeply rundown section of the Bronx.&nbsp; Moved here because the rents were entirely reasonable, and if I&#039;m being honest, I missed white folks, having lived so long being the only one one the block.<br /><br />So I understand both sides of the issue to a certain extent.&nbsp; In my mind, and what&#039;s not being noted here, there&#039;s a radical difference between someone who would move to a previously unheralded middle-to-working-class neighborhood for a basic, sound reason like cheap rent ... and someone who would move to a wildly overly-hyped, increasingly midde-to-upper-middle class neighborhood with what I can fairly describe as extortionate rents and inflated property values.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t move here now based on that alone.&nbsp; Since I&#039;m here, I&#039;ll ride it out as long as I can, as I don&#039;t own my apartment and have been renting the whole time.&nbsp; (I will not post my rent and make many of you weep.)<br /><br />That&#039;s the difference I sense between me and newer arrivals ... and I&#039;m denoting a basic difference in social class more than anything.&nbsp; I came here with zero expectations after being raised in an economically-depressed rural area, then spending my 20s and early 30s in en economically-depressed and crime-ridden urban area.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always felt more at home, and identified much more, with working-class people, as that&#039;s how I was raised, and that&#039;s where I&#039;ve lived most of my life.&nbsp; Since I put myself through college and work in an office, I&#039;ve surely been exposed to middle and upper-middle-class folks for a long, long time now.&nbsp; Again, if I&#039;m being honest, I don&#039;t like or covet the lifestyle and sense a deep emptiness about it based on too high an emphasis on status.<br /><br />Of course, not everyone moving here is &quot;like that.&quot;&nbsp; And most of the &quot;Midwest kids from the suburbs&quot; are in fact well-heeled daughters and sons of tristate area suburbs (if you&#039;re paying attention to their accents).&nbsp; It&#039;s a double-edged sword for me.&nbsp; There&#039;s a lot I don&#039;t like going on, and a lot I do.&nbsp; (I surely don&#039;t miss the lower-end scumbags who were over-populating this place when I first moved here, and a lot of them didn&#039;t get the memo yet about moving out.)&nbsp; I try to keep an open mind.&nbsp; But I surely understand where John B is coming from on this issue.

So maybe you need to &quot;get it&quot;?&nbsp; :wink:<br /><br />If you want to live among old people, move to Florida. If you want a down home community, move to the suburbs or the sticks. We live in a city that harvests some of the hardest working, competitive, innovative and progressive people in all facets of business, technology, culture and the arts - both young and old. It&#039;s competitive. It&#039;s what drives this city to grow. It&#039;s what keeps businesses alive. It&#039;s why people come here. People don&#039;t come here to cities to be stagnant. People come here to succeed.<br /><br />I plan on raising my family here some day, and yes, I&#039;ll probably complain that things are expensive, but it beats the alternative (See: Detroit).

				I can&#039;t help but think most of this discussion and anger comes from the newer resident&#039;s defending their right to be here and feeling attacked. I&#039;m sure most of them are aware that their presence here has altered the demographics. It&#039;s not that there haven&#039;t been demographic shifts before and there have always been new immigrants and nationalities but Astoria was solidly middle class and blue collar for the most part. The shift is in the fact that now the people moving in are white collar professionals with money. The appearance of cool new bars and nice restaurants is great for the people who live here but it&#039;s made it more desirable for people with more money who are willing to pay more for rent and therefore it raises rent prices across the board. This in effect makes the residents who live in the area already and are renting unable to find new apartments in their neighborhood or are being pushed out by landlords who want to re-rent at a higher price. It&#039;s great for the homeowners but a lot of older homeowners sell when the prices get higher and they sell to people who have enough money to afford the more expensive prices and bam... no longer a middle class neighborhood. Yes, this is all the way this city works (I lived in Williamsburg and got priced out in the 90s) and it&#039;s the way gentrification works but it doesn&#039;t stop the older residents from feeling resentful and angry and territorial. The fact that Queens is one of the last bastions in NYC of affordable middle class living for families makes people especially weary of change.

				I researched and found John B&#039;s first post....complaining about the same thing he is in this thread. College Kids. Yep, 2 1/2 years ago, he posted this. <br /><br />It&#039;s great that so many people responded to my letter. It means I&#039;m actually saying something, as opposed to merely offering a report on my emotional state or why I feel so good about living in the big City. Let&#039;s start by getting a few things out of the way. First, I love Astoria, or what&#039;s left of it, and that&#039;s why I bother to write. I want people to see what I see and I want to see some of these trends reversed. <br />I&#039;m aware that there are lots of twentysomethings with college degrees using the place as a dorm room and the fact that it&#039;s so close to Manhattan means that they think they&#039;re in paradise. But a community should never be defined by how close it is to someplace else; it needs to have its own character. People shouldn&#039;t confuse nostalgia with historical memory:&nbsp; It really was a much better place years ago.

				There has been a lot of denial that the changes to Astoria in character might be doing anything but good and everyone seems to think they are only doing good for this neighborhood. I realize it&#039;s hard to look critically at one&#039;s own actions but the fact that a once middle class neighborhood of families is now one of the many cases of a neighborhood in this city that young people with expendable income moved into and then it became desirable for people with money once the neighborhood changed to accommodate the young people&#039;s needs and the families were pushed out due to rising costs... the young people moving here have to realize that&#039;s what&#039;s happening and that they may be part of that right? And you do realize that this will incite anger in many of the people being priced out? It happens all over this city but historically, the elimination of middle class enclaves in the city is a relatively recent phenomenon. One could claim that the white flight in the 70s might be the opposite of what&#039;s going on in the last decade and a half (the upper class leaving in the 70s and lasting until the early 90s due to crime and relocating to the wealthy suburbs, leaving the lower classes to the urban areas as opposed to now lots of the wealthy suburban people moving to urban areas and pricing out the lower classes). This is a sociological argument, not a personal one.

Not much crime, great stores, good transportation.<br /><br />And the notion of class... I remember an article a few years ago where 98% of New Yorkers consider themselves to be middle class. Astoria isn&#039;t Fifth Avenue. If anything, I would call Astoria a lower-middle class neighborhood. <br /><br />Sorry to be all over the place in this post, but it just seems like some people&#039;s perspectives are way out of touch with reality.

				Couldn&#039;t one argue that the overdevelop issue is a NYC thing, a NY state thing, or US thing, and <span class="bbc_u">not</span> just an Astoria thing?&nbsp; Look at the bigger picture... Nothing anywhere is the same is at was 30 years ago.&nbsp; When I go back to my hometown in eastern Long Island where I have not lived in 10 years, the streets are overly congested with cars, houses are popping up on top of one another, etc.<br /><br />(yes, I understand the the topic is *Astoria Transplants* but it&#039;s not like Astoria is the only neighborhood in the world that is changing.)

				Yes Alyssa726 you&#039;re right, the problem is that people with averages salaries are being squeezed out everywhere. It&#039;s not Astoria-specific, but given this is an Astoria-based website and many people truly love the neighborhood and are sensitive to changes here the focus is narrowed.

				I wanted my point to imply itself- but just in case...&nbsp; wouldn&#039;t it be *strange* if the whole world were changing and evolving and Astoria stayed the same forever??<br /><br />It&#039;s sad that people who have lived here for 50 years don&#039;t love the neighborhood like they used to, but things change!&nbsp; Let&#039;s all live happily amongst each other.&nbsp; Things are going to keep changing, I hope everyone can find a way to accept what they don&#039;t like and hold onto the things they do.<br /><br />

				I think this is an interesting discussion.&nbsp; My family moved here in 1972 and following a 10-year stint in Manhattan, my husband and I purchased a house and moved back ten years ago.<br /><br />Some observations:<br /><br />I do admit to getting tired of the complaints.&nbsp; Bad smells, trash, homeless etc.&nbsp; Although they are valid complaints, for someone who has lived in NYC all her life, I am not sure that these issues can ever be resolved permanently.<br /><br />Secondly, there are rentals on my block.&nbsp; Over the past three years, a family with four children of varying ages has moved into the neighborhood, a family with one child moved into the corner house and a family made up of mother, grandmother and 2 daughters moved in down the block.&nbsp; Not bad at all!&nbsp; Yes, there are younger single people interspersed amongst these transplants but we all get along beautifully!<br /><br />Thirdly, I am not sure who the rich kids are.&nbsp; The newcomers (single from outside of NY) seem to watch their pennies carefully, which is a good thing!&nbsp; Just read some of the posts regarding the prices of fruits and vegetables, the prices of restaurant meals and other items.&nbsp; I do not think the new transplants are &#039;wealthy&#039;.&nbsp; They are working people trying to make a living.&nbsp; They may or may not get married, may or may not have children, may or may not move away.&nbsp; This is how it is these days.<br /><br />And finally, I do not miss the Astoria in the 70&#039;s.&nbsp; Sorry but it was pretty boring.&nbsp; Yes, there were families but hardly any good restaurants and not much to do.&nbsp; I was a teenager then and my contemporaries were not very interesting at all.&nbsp; No one had traveled anywhere and hanging out in the candy store was not my cup of tea.&nbsp; I really wanted to get out in those days.&nbsp; Sorry if I sound elitist, but now I can chat with my neighbors about so many interesting subjects.<br /><br />

				Debbie - yeah, I&#039;m not sure who these rich kids are either.&nbsp; I&#039;d say the majority of the 20 and 30 somethings that live here in Astoria come from middle class backgrounds and came to NYC (loaded down with college loans) for a whole variety of reasons, and of which being that it was a place of opportunity for career growth.&nbsp; And the funny thing is, many of us who live in Astoria, and who make an okay living (especially compared to what our parents make) aren&#039;t even considered middle class in NYC.&nbsp; I saw this study about a year ago and it really struck me as a bit depressing: http://wcbstv.com/topstories/middle.class.nyc.2.929048.html<br /><br />Apparently, middle class equals six figures.&nbsp; <br /><br />

Sure, but I choose not to. <br />If someone thinks that their rent is worth 80% of their income, then who gives a crap?

Long before most of your parents were married!<br /><br />We have apartment doors made of steel. Plus we also had screen doors. No-one ever had a lock on those doors. There was no air conditioning as at that time this pre-war building was not wired for it. So, in the warm weather, we slept with windows open and a brick to hold open our apartment doors.<br /><br />Around 7:00 AM every morning people would stand in the halls and all you could here was: &quot;Angel come home&quot; Missy where are you&quot; &quot;Foxy, here puss-puss&quot; &quot;Comon George I have to get to work&quot; <br /><br />I never know whose bed my beagle was sleeping on. I always woke up with 2 or 3 cats, that weren&#039;t mine. <br /><br />Neighbors shared meals with neighbors. When someone was sick a neighbor cooked for them, shopped for them and even cleaned their house. <br /><br />When I gave birth to twins prematurely in March of 1970 my neighbors saw to it that I wouldn&#039;t have to worry about cooking for a month. Casseroles, stews, goulashes, lasagnas, baked macaronis, cakes, muffins . . . we were not just neighbors, we were friends. We new each others names, where we worked, we babysat and dog walked for each other, when someone had problems we were all there to help solve the problem. We went on picnics together, we held a pot luck block part each summer. One of us was always responsible for the fire hydrant sprinkler for the kiddies on those brutally hot summer days.<br /><br />Boy-oh-boy how things have changed. <br /><br />Now neighbors don&#039;t even greet you on the way to the compactor chute!

				I know what you guys are talking about.&nbsp; I was born and raised here in Astoria and have never lived further than Upper Ditmars.&nbsp; I remember 30 years ago going over to my Greek neighbors house and playing for hours and then the next day the kids coming over to play in our house.&nbsp; I used to watch the mom cook all those wonderful dishes (that I can now make) and be so impressed.&nbsp; That was just typical and the norm.&nbsp; Who ever was available to watch the kids would do it but today I have neigbors that don&#039;t even look up to say thank you for holding open the door.&nbsp; The neighborhood sure has changed and it just makes me long for the old days when everyone was happy to have enough food to eat and a roof over their heads.&nbsp; It&#039;s sad that such a great place has become just an extension of the NYC when to me Astoria represented so much more.&nbsp; It used to be a community but now it&#039;s just a place that&#039;s not as expensive as the city to live.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not saying that change isn&#039;t good but when I think back to what Astoria used to be it&#039;s just sad. :-(

I work and spend as I see fit, and it is not my responsibility to society whether I choose to squander my money on expensive and unnecessary goods, or whether I choose to invest in real estate. <br />I can empathize with people struggling to keep up with rising costs, but the fact is that daily challenge is faced by everyone, not just old residents. The choice is made for <span class="bbc_u">all of us</span> that we have to compete, or go under- it&#039;s been the law of nature for all of existence. Spiraling costs are the byproduct of an ever-changing world. It&#039;s like complaining that hamburgers no longer cost a nickel, that&#039;s just what happens over time. <br />I can see why people are upset about it, but I think there is no reasonable resolve to this issue- that&#039;s just the way the city changes, and has been for generations. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=16930.msg186561#msg186561">Quote from: billyboy on December 29, 2009, 01:28:06 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I think you&#039;re going to pick up on money, empathy and how both affect each other and inter-act over the next few decades. &nbsp;If it&#039;s important for people to view their neighborhood as a status symbol, which is exactly what&#039;s going on here, it&#039;s pretty much the opposite of what this neighborhood has traditionally represented. &nbsp;And I can&#039;t help but think all the older Greeks and Italians rubbing their hands together over rising property values don&#039;t seem to realize they&#039;re not going to want to live here 10-20 years from now, yet won&#039;t be able to find that strong sense of home and place they willingly sold out from underneath themselves.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I find it condescending that you just assume I know nothing about money, empathy and their interaction merely because of my age.<br />And you blame the old homeowners for selling their property at a premium because they can?

				I think the OP might be Senator Onorato...&nbsp; :-D<br /><br />Seriously, though, he actually makes a few decent points that get completely lost when sidetracked by the inflammatory nature of the entire post. My grandparents bought a building here in the early 1950s. A six family house where, at one point, my parents lived on the 3rd floor, my grandparents on the second, and a great aunt on the first. In the other apartment on the top floor lived a couple and their daughter (the parents died, the daughter -- now in her 50s -- still lives there), growing up, the other apartment on the first floor lived a young Greek couple who raised their two kids there for about 10 years or so, the other apartment on the second floor had a single mother and her two children (the now adult children have moved, but their mother still lives there). In the summertime, everyone sat outside on folding lawn chairs -- neighbors knew neighbors, everyone watched each other&#039;s kids, etc. It was nice and had the best of both worlds -- the closeness to the Manhattan and its museums and culture, the gritty reality of city living, but also the somewhat bucolic experience of living in pseudo-suburbia. <br /><br />Now, I don&#039;t know my neighbors (except for the landlords who still live on the premises up and down the block), there are always moving trucks dotting the landscape at the end and beginning of the month, there&#039;s been a revolving door on apartments in my own building. It&#039;s kind of sad. <br /><br />So I think what the OP was getting at was that Astoria used to be the town where families raised their kids and the kids grew up and moved on, but now Astoria is the place where the kids from other places move on to, albeit temporarily at times, en route to the place where they will ultimately settle down and raise <em>their </em> families. I don&#039;t necessarily think that&#039;s a bad thing -- the &quot;transplants&quot; have brought with them the demand for restaurants, bars, and entertainment that local businesses have responded to. I do have an issue with small houses being torn down for the sake of building multilevel apartment buildings -- and when they tore down the old Presbyterian Church on 33rd Street that was like a dagger to the heart! -- in that respect, we lose the flavor and character of the neighborhood. <br /><br />Blaming it on newcomers from the Midwest, though, is just scapegoating and unnecessary. I&#039;m sure there are much more worthy recipients of the OP&#039;s ire.

				There are ways to take care of them, my sons proposal is one of them. Since the W is being cut, increase the N but&nbsp; not double the service and drastically increase QM22 service. They would be priced out of here because the Express Bus is $5.50 per ride and that adds up. These &quot;transplants&quot; will affect the political balance and that is not good, especially with my views and what I want as a Conservative and I do not have to worry about what happens because &quot;nobody cares like Frank&quot; in my State Senate district. I am so glad that I got out of here in time and settled in my neighborhood where it is the Old Astoria with no apartments and small mom and pop stores along the main street and I do not have to worry because I have no subway and only the bus to Flushing and the Express Bus in my neighborhood.

				For those who long for the days when other people&#039;s cats slept with them and neighbors assisted each other and things were so wonderful - I think that was probably the case in much of the city.&nbsp; I grew up in Washington Heights until we moved to Astoria and we too kept our doors open and the milkman delivered milk and the cats walked around the hallways etc.<br /><br />Washington Heights is not like that anymore.&nbsp; I would imagine that parts of Brooklyn are not the way they were 30 or 40 years ago and parts of the Bronx are not like they were 40 or 50 years ago.&nbsp; Heck, remember Hell&#039;s Kitchen and the Bowery?&nbsp; What was Tribeca like back then?&nbsp; What about the Lower East Side?<br /><br />Everything has changed.&nbsp; That&#039;s life.&nbsp; We all long for things from the past.&nbsp; We must also learn to appreciate things that we have now.&nbsp; Although I long for some things from the past, I am also happy with what I have now.

I think the construction sign says it will become a senior living center or some such... So that seems kind of cool. I wonder if measures will be taken to crackdown on the noise level in that area though. A lot of people like revving their motorcycles and cars because it&#039;s such a wide street.<br /><br />I felt bad seeing the Church torn down. Especially for the pigeons that inhabited it&#039;s attic area. It seemed to be a home for a lot of pigeons and as the Church was slowly torn down, they never let go of it. They&#039;d all wedge themselves on it&#039;s remaining sections in the freezing cold and soon had to seek refuge on the adjacent Church building until that was torn down as well.<br /><br />With regards to this thread topic, I&#039;ve voiced my opinion before in a similar thread and quickly got neg nodded. I&#039;m a native Astorian, it&#039;s the only neighborhood I&#039;ve ever lived in. When I lived with my parents we moved three times and we&#039;ve always stayed here. When I moved out on my own I was lucky enough to remain here. But I&#039;ve got to deal with the rising rent costs because of the gentrification. If my rent goes up next year I&#039;ll have to consider moving. Hopefully I can find something a little further away from the trains in Astoria, but if that doesn&#039;t happen I&#039;ll be forced to move away.<br /><br />I think that&#039;s where some people might be coming from when they express some disdain for the changes. Sure, I like the new restaurants and bars but I&#039;d still would have chosen to live in Astoria without all that. I just read someones comment about how many of the new people that come to Astoria are just passing through. And while my experiences don&#039;t define the situation I&#039;ve seen and heard many people treat Astoria as just some trendy place. And sure that&#039;s nice, and I realize being trendy comes from having a lot interesting places to visit, hang, drink and eat at and all those places are a product of the citizens in a neighborhood and I&#039;m sure many of those places could only have been created by newcomers but the downside comes when too many people, at the same time from out of the area start turning their heads to see what&#039;s going on here and especially when it&#039;s only because they get off on planting themselves in places that a magazine or something defines as cool and hip. That attitude is not something I think long time residents or people who plan on staying here for a while want to have.<br /><br />I want to finish off this post with something positive and that&#039;ll be that we can&#039;t stop the changes. Many more people will come through Astoria and I&#039;ve personally made some friends with out of towners or whatever you want to call them. They&#039;re genuinely good people. I just hope that Astoria doesn&#039;t become overpriced and only recognized as a place to hang out latenights and weekends. There are* people who want to live here because of some connection to their past. They can accept changes but you can&#039;t blame them for being angry that they&#039;re forced out by skyrocketing rents and a changing sense of community brought about by people who came here to hang out because some magazine said its hip.

I respect all people of all ages, however their political affiliation annoys me and I own property here and I do not want people like Frei-Pearson running the show because once the young get out of Astoria they will leave this place like a bomb went through it. They only care about gay marriage and legalizing marajuana and getting drunk. There are ways to drive the new people out of here I have mentioned it. I am also glad that I am up in where I am where there would be no young transplants because there is no subway and we only have the QM2A to Manhattan and the Q16 to Flushing which runs every 40 minutes on weekends. They are here for the subway and only the subway. If we fixed the transportation services around here, then we could drive them out. The new young people say they are here, vote, and to screw Astoria up. I&#039;d rather live in Brownsville, East New York (if there was less crime and no projects) where people have a sense of morality. Rather than &quot;mass man&quot; that the young people desire and are accustomed to. None of them realize that we are human and not all the same, and humans are not just like items on an assembly line.

I am not talking about Rush Limbaugh or Sarah Palin, but the hardworking, responsible people who earned their standard of living. Also criminals are not a problem in my part of Queens. I have more problems like the Q14, Q31, and Q76 facing elimination and the QM2A facing service reductions. Have you ever whined about service being cut in Astoria? No. Did you know that the QM22 and W is being cut. Worry about that. Also the young clowns are that clowns and there are much more things to worry about.

				I&#039;m catching up on this thread and putting on my moderator hat if I may: If you don&#039;t have anything to add to the conversation other then posting a pic -- please refrain.<br /><br />If you re-read page 1 this thread, the OP attacked both kids from the Midwest turning the neighborhood into a “dormslum” and the Greeks who no longer live in the neighborhood but enjoy the high rents they make from them. Everything else ensued from that premise. It&#039;s no wonder that newcomers and oldtimers alike feel &quot;attacked&quot; because both groups were essentially. So let&#039;s move on from who bashed whom first.

				OK, if someone did a brain transplant to you, do you think that would make you a different person or do you think you would still be the same person, just with a different brain?&nbsp; For the sake of argument let&#039;s say this happened in Astoria.

				To be fair Clearview, the QM22 has very, very limited service. There are two trips into Manhattan in the early morning and two back to Queens in the early evening. It&#039;s elimination will not affect that many people. Though I understand that the riders who use the route will be inconvenienced, there are other buses to the subway that can be taken.<br /><br />If you are concerned about the QM22 being cut you&#039;re more than welcome to start a thread on it, but given you live somewhere in eastern Queens, I can see why it wouldn&#039;t be important to you.
