				No big surprise, but just another example of how much we were lied to, in the effort to justify the invasion of Iraq!&nbsp; <br /><br />Hussein&#039;s Prewar Ties To Al-Qaeda Discounted<br />Pentagon Report Says Contacts Were Limited<br /><br />By R. Jeffrey Smith<br />Washington Post Staff Writer<br />Friday, April 6, 2007; Page A01<br /><br />Captured Iraqi documents and intelligence interrogations of Saddam Hussein and two former aides &quot;all confirmed&quot; that Hussein&#039;s regime was not directly cooperating with al-Qaeda before the U.S. invasion of Iraq, according to a declassified Defense Department report released yesterday.<br /><br /><br />The article in it&#039;s entirety can be opened in this link:<br /><br />http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/05/AR2007040502263.html?hpid=topnews<br /><br />

				and yet, I suspect few of the people who used this to justify the war will ever accept it as the truth, and most won&#039;t even hear about it as it won&#039;t get a lot of coverage on right-wing talk radio.

				When the ancient Persians captured a town which resisted it, all of the men were often killed, unless they had a specific skill which the satrap might find useful.&nbsp; When an unskilled Greek captive was facing the executioner, he begged the satrap to spare him.<br /><br />&quot;Why should I spare you?&nbsp; What skill do you have?&quot;<br />&quot;I can teach your horse how to talk&quot; the Greek responded.<br />The satrap held up his hand and asked how.<br />&quot;It is a skill my father taught me.&nbsp; In one year&#039;s time, I can teach your horse to talk.&nbsp; If I cannot, I shall gladly submit to any punishment you deem fit&quot;<br />The satrap then agreed and the life of the Greek was spared.<br />Later, his friend came upto him and admonished him.<br />&quot;You can&#039;t teach a horse to speak, that&#039;s not the <strong>truth</strong>&quot;<br />&quot;The real truths are that over the next year, I may die, the satrap may die or the horse may die&quot;

				I think there are people who don&#039;t even realize they are drinking the kool-aid - people who genuinely think Fox is fair and balanced.&nbsp; <br />Did folks see McCain&#039;s walk through Baghdad?&nbsp; These Republicans are living in a fantasy world where the war is going well.
