				New to the site, awesome, has already been very informative. Was wondering if anyone knows what the store next to the Keyfood is going to be near Ditmars(Formerly Rainbow something, sold kitchen stuff). Looks like it might be a restaurant....

				Yesterday while I was in the bank I was told by one of the bankers that it was going to be a bank. Not a national one, just some local bank.<br /><br />He also said that there&#39;s an HSBC going in further down the street on the corner of 23rd Ave and 31st Street.

				I think this may be the new BCP Bank location.&nbsp; They&#39;re big in other parts of the country, but only have two other branches in NYC, one in Astoria at Broadway and 35th Street.

				Personally I wish it was a Baja-style Mexican food joint going in. I&#39;d love it! I don&#39;t think we need more banks.

				We definitely don&#39;t need more banks, at least not in my opinion.&nbsp; I&#39;d like to see decent Chinese somewhere.&nbsp; How does Baja-style Mexican compare to other Mexican cuisines?

				There&#39;s already Mexican (Los Amigos, I think it&#39;s called) right up the street from the Rainbow location, so I doubt they&#39;ll open another one. Good take-out Mexican would be good though. Los Amigos is pretty meh.

Their tacos are pretty good, and dirt cheap. I liked their mole. Their tortas are OK. But anything that looks like a burrito or enchilada was pretty bad...

				If it isn&#39;t a bank, please let it be another cell phone store. We don&#39;t have enough of either!

				I want a bookstore in the worst possible way.&nbsp; I&#39;d even take a chain at this point, Barnes and Nobles or Borders, though I&#39;d prefer a competent small community bookstore.&nbsp; With all of the Starbucks openings and the two Coldstone Creamery stores, why haven&#39;t these chains sought space on Steinway?&nbsp; Barnes and Nobles is in Brooklyn Heights, Co-Op City and Forest Hills, why not Astoria?

				The inside seems to remind me of how they built the&nbsp; Vital Dent on Steinway b/t broadway and 31st ave. If you look on their site it lists a location at 22-29 3st click on it and it basically points to the same location that was rainbow.
