				You get today&#39;s &quot;go get em&quot; award! I hoped that eventually someone would take the bull by the horns and go for it, and here you are. I&#39;m sure that the majority of us here will be behind you 100% with this and i for one would love to help out in whatever way i can. I&#39;m not a very organized or put together person so having someone in charge is good- i take orders well&nbsp; :-D <br />• I do think there is a Spanish niche here but i&#39;m not sure what the trend is on foreign language bookselling.<br />• I look for a comfy place and an eclectic variety of books with the option of ordering the harder to come by titles. A little lounge/cafe corner would be nice too (depending on size)<br /><br />good luck! i&#39;ll be keeping an eye on this thread <br />

				I think that you want to get as many people as possible using you to purchase books. You may want to come up with some way that people can reserve or request a book online, and then pick it up once the order for their book comes in. If your prices are reasonable I don&#39;t see why people wouldn&#39;t want to support a local place.<br /><br />You might also want to offer the option of selling books back to the store at half price or something.<br /><br />Running a small bookstore these days isn&#39;t easy, I wish you all the best!

				another option, which is how an acquaintance of mine started his local bookshop after college, is this:&nbsp; <br />tap into the student population of Astoria, figure out what books they need and see if you can get a used book and at cost trade going in addition to the other stuff...<br />although you won&#39;t necessarily make money at first this way, it&#39;s a great way to build a market :)

				Whereabouts in Astoria are you looking for space?&nbsp; You&#39;re going to want something on a major commercial strip, or right off it, and close to the trains, if possible, so people can stop in on their way home.

				If you want ideas, a good field trip would be to Bookcourt on Court Street in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn.&nbsp; No coffee lounge :( or wifi, but it&#39;s an excellent independent bookstore, and they seemingly pack a Barnes &amp; Noble-ful of books into a much smaller space without feeling cramped.

				Good luck, but I would be very, very cautious on this.<br /><br />Here are a few things to keep in mind.&nbsp; The American Booksellers Association, the primary trade organization for independant bookstores, had 5000+ members about 10 years ago.&nbsp; That number has dropped to about 1700 members today.<br /><br />Finances for bookstores are tough.&nbsp; For inventory alone you will need to be spend a lot of money.&nbsp; As an example, most general bookstores try to turn their inventory twice a year.&nbsp; This means that if you have $1 million in sales per year, you will need to have $500,000 in inventory at any given time to sustain this.<br /><br />That $500K (at retail) will cost you approx $300K (at wholesale), and most publishers and wholesale companies will only extend 30-60 days of credit.&nbsp; The back-of-the-envelope calculation means that you will be able to float $100K (at cost) of inventory on publishers credit (assuming an inventory turn of 2, $1 million in annual sales, and 60 day credit for all of your inventory), but the other $200K (at cost) of inventory will need to be paid for before you sell it.&nbsp; In other words, out of your pocket.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is just the inventory cost.&nbsp; You will also need to pay for real estate, wages, fixtures, cash registers/computers, advertising, legal fees, etc.<br /><br />Mirki2&#39;s suggestions are more suited to a college bookstore business model.&nbsp; &nbsp;I do not htink that this is what you are thinking about, but it is also not terribly suitable to Astoria, as there is no easy way to connect with the student population as a whole, and any students in the area will be attending a number of different institutions.&nbsp; Plus, the college bookstore market is highly seasonal and operates on much lower gross margins than trade bookstores.

It was my feeling with Astoria that it&#39;s not as transient as other hoods because people seem to like it here, hence the suggestion, but I of course could be wrong about this....

				No problem.<br /><br />University towns are generally good places for bookstores.&nbsp; When I read your original post, it sounded like you were talking about textbooks.&nbsp; This is a viable business in and of itself, but it has an entirely different set of dynamics from a trade book store which is what the OP was talking about (I think).&nbsp; As Astoria does not have a sizable university/college (like UC-Santa Cruz), a student bookstore would simply not work.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now, a used bookstore in general might.&nbsp; The con to this is that pretty much all of your inventory must be paid for up front, and your selection will vary depending on what is available to be purchased.&nbsp; But, margins are generally pretty high, as you are purchasing the books at 10% of cover price (approx), and selling them at 50% of cover price (again, approx).&nbsp; This gives you an 80% gross margin on inventory.&nbsp; <br /><br />Once a used store is up and running, you can start to obtain inventory from your customers, paying them in store credit to be used on future purchases.&nbsp; This will help ensure a steady supply of &#39;new&#39; inventory, plus a steady supply of returning customers who want to use their credits<br /><br />People browsing in used bookstores are generally more tolerant of dated/utilitarian fixtures (look at the Strand compared to B&amp;N for an example), so one would save $ in the initial setup process of the business.<br /><br />I am not sure what an industry average inventory turn might be on used books though, and acquiring your initial inventory might be tough.<br /><br />

				Even a good used bookstore would be preferable to Seaburn.&nbsp; I took two friends who work in publishing on a walking tour in Astoria recently and they wanted to check it out.&nbsp; They were shocked and horrified by the selection - I found their reaction very interesting, but none of us can figure out how they decide to order what they order.&nbsp; A nice used bookstore would be a welcome addition to Astoria.

Steinway Street would be ideal but rent??? Probably astronomical.

				Thank you all soo much for your comments.&nbsp; I really am seriously devoting myself to this for the next year.&nbsp; As an avid reader and explorer of indep. bookstore, I&#39;m really hoping for a cross betw/ Strand, Housing Works &amp; Bluestocking on the L.E.S.&nbsp; I also believe in community and was wondering how a cooperative bookstore would fly.&nbsp; I used to be a member of a coop grocery and it was great.&nbsp; my aspirations:<br />1. good selection and balance betw/ new &amp; used<br />2. basic cafe/sitting/drink area<br />3. community events -&gt; readings, art shows, poety nights, singles events<br />4. hours 12-10<br />5. store credit for book purchases<br />6. discounts for members, seniors<br />This is actually a very exciting process, again if any of you are actually interested in partipating I know we&#39;ll need figure-heads, insider info on possible location spots, free/cheap legal advice, foot soldiers.

				I spent 5 years in sales and marketing for a major book publisher and am a marketing/web director.&nbsp; As mentioned earlier independent booksellers face major competition, declining sales, etc.&nbsp; The most successful stores focus on a particular area or two.&nbsp; Depending on the local population/foot traffic and you pretty much have to allow for additional revenue streams.&nbsp; Coffee sales, gifts, dvds, etc.&nbsp; You&#39;ll find the add-on sale vital I&#39;m sure.&nbsp; An example I guess would be a book store that opened in Park Slope focusing on children’s books and parenting books because of all the yuppie families moving into the area.&nbsp; Also, successful ind. stores usually develop a few key areas they concentrate on and supplement in store sales with a website.&nbsp; In fact, for many stores, they sell way more product online then in person.&nbsp; As far as Astoria, I&#39;m not sure what to suggest, it would depend on the area.&nbsp; Wifi is bad if you don&#39;t offer something for people to buy or require a purchase. People probably won&#39;t need to pay for your wifi service because it&#39;s likely they can latch on to a nearby store or apartment&#39;s open access.&nbsp; People sitting all day reading/surfing don&#39;t necessarily buy anything when the research is done and you&#39;re left with worn books and magazine.&nbsp; Stores like B&amp;N can afford to do this as the huge numbers they attract bring in enough real sales and publishers let them return unsold books (meaning all those books they order knowing they will never sell, but use for display as well as those that are ruined by people using the store as a reference library). <br /><br />&nbsp;I don&#39;t mean to discourage you, just wanted to point out some things to think about. By the way, many websites, such as yahoo, allow you to set up web stores with as many as several hundred products very inexpensively and easily. You probably already use stores hosted by them and don&#39;t even know it.<br />

				GenXnyc makes several excellent points, although I will offer a slightly different view for some things.<br /><br />An ecommerce capable website is probably not critical.&nbsp; If you are selling used books, simply set up as a seller on half.com (aka ebay) and/or abebooks.com.&nbsp; This is an inexpensive way of getting huge distribution on the internet.<br /><br />For new books online, simply realize that you will never be able to compete with amazon or bn.com.&nbsp; Setting up your own site using yahooshops or a similar service will actually be a huge timesink.&nbsp; (jacket art, blurbs, navigation, etc)&nbsp; Now, having a website is critical for advertising purposes, but you want to put as little effort as possible into this.&nbsp; For a good, easy, cheap option, checkout www.booksite.com.&nbsp; For the record, I am not affiliated in any way with booksite, so this is not a self-interested plug.<br /><br />All bookstores have return options with publishers.&nbsp; This is generally for credit only on future purchases, and may be at a penalty.&nbsp; The books must also not be shopworn (as Genxnyc describes).&nbsp; Do not view this as a get out of jail free card if you make bad buying decisions.&nbsp; You will need to pay freight on incoming shipments, out going shipments (for returns) plus the labor involved in initially receiving the books, then pulling them for return, plus all of the accounting.&nbsp; Returns are very costly for the bookstore, even if you get full credit.<br /><br />Be careful on the discounts that you offer to people.&nbsp; Discounting is a valid way of attracting customers, but each and every penny of discounting comes from your gross profit margin.&nbsp; You will also need to be very, very careful about your budget in terms of wages.&nbsp; Go to the American Booksellers Association and get all of their literature.&nbsp; If I remember correctly, they offer sample guidelines as to what percentage of overall sales you want to spend on rent, utilities, wages, freight in, freight out, credit card fees, etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />Community events are a great way to build a loyal following, and hopefully some paying customers.&nbsp; One thing to watch out for is to not be too obscure in your offerings.&nbsp; As an example, most bookstores need to carry poetry, or else they loose credibility with their customers.&nbsp; Overall though, poetry is not a category that sells any books.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sidelines.&nbsp; Do it.&nbsp; Coffee sales, I Love Astoria T-shirts, greeting cards, whatever.&nbsp; You will make more money from all of these things than you will make from the books themselves.<br /><br />

				Oh yeah.&nbsp; I agree with all of that.&nbsp; I suggested yahoo, as it works for a particular account I have, but it depends on how much flexibility you like and your level of interest. <br /><br />Good catch on clarifying on the return issue.&nbsp; Returns are possible, it&#39;s the return shipping, boxing, packing, accounting, etc that adds up.&nbsp; But, the definition of new and shopworn is subjective ;)<br /><br />Just an aside...the last account I worked with thought they wanted to open a bookstore with a small coffee shop, they opted instead for a coffee shop with a small paperback/magazine/used section and are doing well still.&nbsp; So I guess the point is you never know where your idea might take you...<br /><br />Have you given any thought to what area of town?

				Again, many thanks for the great advice &amp; the Book Court info.&nbsp; I&#39;ve never heard of it, but then again I rarely venture to BK &#39;cuz of the commute.&nbsp; this is a great looking store &amp; i definately plan to investigate it further.&nbsp; right now we are planning to locate a space near the subway, but not necessarily on Steinway.&nbsp; mostly we&#39;r concerned w/ a flexible space, allowing us room to grow.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				1) I&#39;m always amazed that B&amp;N and Borders let you sit in the cafe, read the book and then leave the book behind - used. <br /><br />I would definitely have a &quot;purchased merchandise only&quot; rule in my book cafe.<br /><br />2) Is it possible to sell used books on consignment?&nbsp; That way you don&#39;t have to lay out any money for inventory.&nbsp; Your &quot;suppliers&quot; come by once every few months to either pick up a check (say 40% of sold) or if they opt for store credit it could be a higher percent.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				a usable bookstore in the neighborhood would be awesome! I will happily switch all book purchases to your store.&nbsp; <br />there are a couple emtpy places on 31st ave, near 2 fantastic vintage/local arts stores/a &quot;coffeeshop&quot; that isn&#39;t open during the day (himalaya, I am talking to you. I need coffee in the morning, why aren&#39;t you open??)/a huge busy restaurant/ and what appears to be a blossoming area for shopping independent in astoria.&nbsp; maybe it is just wishful thinking.&nbsp; not a ton of foot traffic, but it looks like you have plenty of people willing to help you with word-of-mouth advertising. <br />just a thought.&nbsp; and best of luck!&nbsp; <br />please let me (us) know if you opt for used books... I am about to purge my shelves, but it can wait til you need them if you do.<br />

				Please, go for it! You have no real competition and I think would have lots of interested customers. The used bookstore suggestion is a less appealing to me than a nice, independent bookstore stocking new books, but honestly, I&#39;d be delighted to see any ol&#39; bookstore move in. Also, if you included a small section with non-cheesy cards and a limited selection of decent little luxury items (similar maybe to the vibe of Alphabets or Exit 9 in the East Village) for extra revenue, I think that would be welcome addition. There&#39;s nowhere in the area to buy that kind of stuff, at least not that I know of -- I feel like I have to get on the train every time I need to find a gift. But maybe this is off the topic.<br /><br />Another option, if your space is large enough, is to consider holding events for kids in the mornings. It might not be your thing, but there are a lot of young families nearby, and very few activities for the kiddies, especially in the colder months. This might bring new customers in, and depending on the type of event you might even be able to charge something. Or, why not have a weekly storytime for toddlers during a slow time of day, and push the featured book(s) for sale right afterward? Or maybe organize some kind of book club that older kids can sign up for at the beginning of the season, purchase a specific collection of books up front and then invite the families &quot;in the club&quot; to come to a related little musical event or discussion about each book on scheduled days throughout the season.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure how big a children&#39;s section you would like to have, but I&#39;m just saying that people pay $20 a pop for silly 45 minute sing-along classes for their little ones, so why not cash in on that market to supplement the book sales? <br /><br />Good luck, and let us know what you decide to do! Your customers are waiting...<br /><br />Beth<br />

				Alphabetize your store. That&#39;s #1.<br /><br />Don&#39;t overcrowd it with annoying spinning racks, like Seaburn books has.<br /><br />Think of the foot traffic in the store, keep the place easy to manouver around in.<br /><br />Don&#39;t sell remainders.<br /><br />Have lots of classics and famous authors.<br /><br />Have book readings, with free coffee.<br /><br />Don&#39;t have 50% of your store full of outdated recipe books.<br /><br />and please, please open a new bookstore!

				I just read this article on Wired News. While it is a discouraging article, you may be able to figure out some ideas based on other bookstores&#39; struggles. It does help, I think, that there is not a chain bookstore (that I know of anyway) in Astoria.<br /><br />http://www.wired.com/news/columns/0,71933-0.html?tw=rss.index

				Fantastic! I&#39;ve been living in Astoria for 10 yrs. now and have thought about this idea on and off and everytime I see another Greek cafe/lounge open up. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a joke in there somewhere...how many Greek cafes does it take to close down 1? I would love LOVE it if this works out for you. I think if you can make if financially viable, there are so many young/couples/families coming into this neighborhood that the community support could be there, especially as someone pointed out, since you HAVE NO COMPETITION! I don&#39;t mean that ridiculous Seaburn place on Broadway. What is that anyway, someone&#39;s closet???! I can only guess that anything on Steinway might be expensive, but the space on the corner of Steinway and 28th Avenue is for lease currently. Realistically, I don&#39;t know if it is big enough for a bookstore, but they already have a kitchen area if you were thinking of including a cafe/selling bar items. If you do decide on the coffee/food thing, do not half-ass it like Wassi (sorry Wassi!) which has a great vibe, good coffee but horrible sandwiches and extras. And of course, readings/entertainment/community events would be great for not only drawing people into the place but making money too. Look at http://corneliastreetcafe.com/ as an example of that—a reading/musical event almost every night. I agree that there is definitely a market in this neighborhood for kiddie events and a Spanish language niche. (By the way, the learning center for kids [don&#39;t remember the name] is just down the block on Steinway, as well.) Good luck and keep us readers posted. p.s. I work at Random House and will find out what the big houses do with their remainders, if they sell to independents, etc... Maybe there&#39;s a way for you to buy their remainders, depending on selection, of course, at some discount? more than my two cents, edava

				Hi,<br /><br />I happened to be browsing at Bluestockings yesterday, and I came across this book: Rebel Bookseller.<br />http://www.rebelbookseller.com/<br /><br />Sounds like just the book you need to read!&nbsp; It was written by Andy Laties, who currently runs Vox Pop in Brooklyn.&nbsp; He self-published the book, so I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s being sold in big mega-stores like Barnes &amp; Noble, but you can definitely find it at Bluestockings.<br /><br />The website also links to his blog.&nbsp; I only skimmed through some of these posts here and the blog, but here&#39;s the gist of what I understand:<br /><br />~You can&#39;t start up a &quot;middle-of-the-road&quot; typical-looking indie bookstore.&nbsp; It has to be specialized in some way for people to want to keep coming.&nbsp; <br /><br />~Laties has opened other bookstores in the past, and made alliances with powerful non-profit organizations/institutions, like museums.&nbsp; He would essentially be the museum&#39;s affiliate gift shop, so the museum&#39;s patrons would always flock to him.&nbsp; He also sold non-book, high-markup goods as well in his bookstores.<br /><br />You might even be able to contact Mr. Laties, since he&#39;s operating a bookstore in Brooklyn now.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />~kickingchicken

				I&#039;ve always thought that a great way to start up a bookstore, and get people interested without the huge financial commitment of a storefront, would be to have a bookmobile.&nbsp; Growing up in Michigan, libraries used to send these around into neighborhoods without local branches and loan or sell books to kids.&nbsp; All you&#039;d need is a van/truck large enough to allow people to browse inside.<br /><br />Just a thought:)<br />Leezichka

				perhaps a subscription library service option? pay $50 a year, you get to borrow books for some (long) period of time, then bring them back when you are done?<br /><br />a friend supports herself and two children by selling books online that she picks up by traveling to various used book sales-- usually libraries pruning their shelves. boxes of books for $1 a piece. that would be a way to fill your shelves quickly and cheaply.<br /><br />many many chairs.<br /><br />be nice to the Mommy Mafia. ;)<br /><br />alia

				To all who have been part of this thread:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is good to see the interest in having a bookstore come to our neighborhood.&nbsp; It&#039;s been an intellectual fantasy of mine for a few years, and I&#039;m beginning to realize that it won&#039;t happen unless we all do something more than just talk about it in forums.<br /><br />To that end, I want to move this forward into reality...I&#039;ve been sending out surveys to friends and colleagues to glean their reading habits, an am designing a postcard to pass out to commuters at the subway stops to gauge the community interest and support (outside of ourselves ) for a bookstore.<br /><br />At first glance, it seems to be a daunting task - the logistics, the money, the staff, etc.&nbsp; But if enough of us can get involved with each of our experiences/strengths/contacts to put together a proposal (I would be asking for a time commitment, not a money commitment) this ideal bookstore that we have in our heads can become a reality.<br /><br />So the question I have for each of you are: what are you committed to doing to make this happen?&nbsp; Let me know, as the more people we have behind this, the better.&nbsp; Let me know your thoughts and your interest in being part of this.<br /><br />Matthew<br />goodreadingbooks@nyc.rr.com<br />

				I&#039;ve been a small town reporter, so I can probably write (or at least edit) press releases as needed. I can contact the mommy mafia (either informally or with surveys in hand). I also worked in a small local bookstore, come to think of it, though that was a long time ago before amazon. I could probably still connect to my ex boss and see how he survived the great internet behemoth.<br /><br />cheers,<br />alia

				Thanks, Alia - <br />Having someone who knows how to write press releases will be great, as I know nothing about it myself...so when the time comes, we could really use that skill.<br /><br />Talking with the Mommy Mafia will be great - I think I can create a shorter survey, but more importantly, I want to hear what they think is important to have, as they may be the center of the daytime crowd...plus the fact that we will want storytime programs, a children&#039;s area, etc.&nbsp; What would make a store more kid-friendly - what do they really want to see in a store?&nbsp; what has been missing?<br />And yes, it would also be good to have input from your ex-boss - would be good to hear a voice of experience.<br /><br />is there an e-mail address I can reach you at? feel free to e-mail me at goodreadingbooks@nyc.rr.com

				I currently work as a publicist at a major publishing house and it is tough.&nbsp; I have thought about opening a bookstore in this area, but the start-up costs are astounding and I work in publishing.&nbsp; But what makes an indepenedent bookstore successful, here are some things I&#039;ve learned from various booksellers across the country:<br /><br />Know your customer, really know them.&nbsp; Know their names, their preferences and most important their email address.&nbsp; Which leads me to the newsletter.&nbsp; You want an extensive email database to send out information.&nbsp; <br /><br />You&#039;re not going to get famous authors, there are too many established indies and the chains in the city for you to even think of getting a big name.&nbsp; Don&#039;t rely on this.&nbsp; You can do authorless events.&nbsp; There is a great childrens book called Fancy Nancy.&nbsp; Hold a best Fancy outfit contest for girls aged 4-12 and they win a book.&nbsp; You have to be creative with your events.&nbsp; If down the road you do get a big name, sell tickets that include the price of the book.&nbsp; Publisher&#039;s love this because we can quantify how successful an event is.<br /><br />And I totally recommend alcohol.&nbsp; It loosens people up and they end up buying more.&nbsp; Pair it up with a wine book or a travel through Tuscany book.<br /><br />You have to be the go to place for people to talk about what is going on in the community.<br /><br />BOOK GROUPS!!!!&nbsp; I know one indie that has over 200 book groups in their store.&nbsp; You will need one staff person to organize this, or someone from the community.&nbsp; You can offer suggestions, a place to meet and the possibility of getting in touch with the author if it is a mid-list or debut author.&nbsp; And even better, you know what they like b/c of their book group preference and can suggest other reads.<br /><br />You are lucky enough to live 20 minutes away from all of the major publishing houses.&nbsp; Make friends.&nbsp; Call their customer service numbers and see if there is someone that will talk to you about starting a new bookstore.&nbsp; Call other indies from around the country - Schwartz (the midwest), Tattered Cover (THE indie bookstore, located in Denver), BookPeople (austin), etc.<br /><br />Search for and join NAIBA - it&#039;s a regional organization for independent booksellers in the North Atlantic.<br /><br />Don&#039;t be a literature snob.&nbsp; There is a reason why Mary Higgins Clark, Janet Evanovich and Nora Roberts are on the bestseller list - THEY SELL.&nbsp; &nbsp;Get a subscription to Publishers Weekly to see what is doing well and what trends the industry is facing.&nbsp; To that point mass market romance readers are rabid readers - up to 6 to 8 paperbacks a month, we like them.<br /><br />Publicity - this is a great story... pitch it.&nbsp; And annouce every event or sale you have.&nbsp; Make friends with local reporters, create a media list.&nbsp; Publicist will ask for this when they call your store to book an author, if you don&#039;t have it, it means more work for us and we don&#039;t like that.<br /><br />I&#039;m getting wordy, so here a couple more and then I&#039;m out:<br />A great website<br />A lounge/event area<br /><br /><br />

				It would be lovely to have an actual book store (e.g. one that sells books one might like to read) in Astoria.&nbsp; I would be willing to curate a reading series and/or the poetry section.<br /><br />Info. about me is here: http://www.marklamoureux.com<br /><br />Based on friends I&#039;ve had who have run independent bookstores and kept them going, it is more or less essential that they have an online component, since most of your business will come by way to that avenue.&nbsp; At this point (sadly) an indy bookstore storefront is pretty much icing on the cake of other distro. components. <br /><br />As an indy, it is important to develop a core audience, and a sense of community--it is essential to develop specialties and a relationship with local readers.&nbsp; With all due respect to danielle1028, trying to run an indy by kowtowing to mass-markets is a fool&#039;s errand--these titles can be obtained at bus stations, airports, and places like Amazon.com at deep discounts that an Indy cannot compete with.<br /><br />

				Personally, I would vow to stop using Amazon.com for my books (I purchase about 5&nbsp; per month) and will come to the bookstore.&nbsp; I also purchase many Coffee Table Books every month for work.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just some info - Years ago, there was simply no market for a bookstore in Astoria.&nbsp; Most of the locals were either first generation immigrants or people who lived here for generations but whose reading capacity never went beyond the New York Post.&nbsp; Now, there is a market.<br /><br />When Susan Terry&#039;s on the corner of 31st and Ditmars went out of business, Barnes and Noble received an amazing number of phone calls to open there.&nbsp; Naturally, an independent bookstore is preferable, but it goes to show you that there is a market.<br /><br />To those of you who mock all the Greek Cafes, I prefer them to all the banks and places like Kay&#039;s Jewelry (sp?), Starbucks, fast food stores, Payless Shoe Stores etc. that seem to be going up all over Manhattan.&nbsp; In the neighborhood where I work in Murray Hill, all of the interesting little shops have closed and all of the aforementioned have opened.&nbsp; Furthermore, there are four Starbucks within a five block radius.&nbsp; Would you prefer to have Starbucks replace all of the Greek Cafes?&nbsp; At least the offerings and design of the cafes vary somewhat!

				Back in the early 90s, I believe, the bookstore on Broadway had different owners, who regularly held poetry readings from poets both published and unpublished, readings from Kerouac&#039;s novels and essays on his birthday, and many other literary-oriented activities.&nbsp; I really missed them when they ceased after the bookstore had changed hands a few more times.

				I am being a voyeur and I shouldn&#039;t be - I should chime in! <br /><br />I, too, am in the throes of opening a bookstore/cafe (more bookstore than cafe, but people seem want a cafe too). Not that business shouldn&#039;t be competitive, but I believe there is room for more than one to be successful in Astoria (perhaps one on the Ditmars end and one in the 30th Ave/Steinway area, at least that&#039;s the areas my research shows) and I am just so happy that there are so many people interested and supportive of the ideas being put out there. <br /><br />Astoria is a fantastic community filled with voracious readers, artists and people who I believe would truly welcome and support a bookstore(s). I will tell you this idea of mine (and obviously many others) is an exciting one, if not slightly daunting. Everyday I get a little nervous, but I am definitely driven and even more excited. Good luck to all who are looking to open independent businesses in the community - we need &#039;em, we want &#039;em!

				I&#039;m also bursting with excitement to even see talk of this ambitious endeavor!!!! I’m in agreement with everyone who has mentioned keeping it small and focused. Small local business with that model seem to be most successful….so said the research I did before setting up my own. Be ruthless about overhead and get the longest lease you can- rent and opening merchandise costs will be your biggest expenses…keeping your rent rates low will help keep your doors open for a long, long time. <br /><br />On that note, I was able to use 100% Astoria resources (accountants, contractors, and most important of all…lenders) to open my store SITE. If you all need great references, email me, I’d be happy to help in anyway I can!!! mackenzi@sitedesignnyc.com&nbsp; <br />

				What about a program where you can trade in used textbooks? As a grad student at NYU, i would love somewhere I could turn textbooks in for more than $5 each. I pay over $100 a book and the school only gives you back $5. Even if you don&#039;t give back $$, gift certificates to other books in the store, cafe gift cards for coffee, anything would be better than the insulting $5 they offer you back.

				To all who are part of this post...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks for keeping this topic alive...<br />Last month I stood at the subway at Astoria Blvd and at Ditmars, handing out cards asking for people&#039;s input about what they would want in a bookstore...and the responses I got were spectacular.&nbsp; Whether it was event-related, cafe related, or book subject related, you all had gold to offer.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;As a result, I&#039;ve decided to move ahead with making this happen.&nbsp; The plan in to create a new and used bookstore (the final decision as to whether it is profit or nonprofit is pending) with a cafe that specializes in board games, toys, and puzzles - and changes in purpose from morning (getting your coffee and a magazine to go) to evening (imagine the possibility of coming home to Astoria and having a cafe to sit down, drink a glass of wine, and curl up with a good book) with plenty of events and programs to go around.<br />Currently, I have a business partner who is in charge of the cafe side of the project, and we have begun to put together a business plan...in addition, there are a few of us who will be meeting and brainstorming regarding details and events.&nbsp; To be honest, though - i could definitely use the community&#039;s help... I asked a while back and got a few responses, but was not really ready to move forward with the project, so I did not follow up very promptly....so now I ask again - who would like to contribute to strengthening our neighborhood?&nbsp; Who would like to have a place to read, a place to work outside of your apartment, a place to go after work to relax?&nbsp; And what are you willing to do to make it reality?<br /><br />I recently started a blog at http://goodreadingbooks.blogspot.com/ , which will, as long as I keep in integrity about it, show the progress made on the store.&nbsp; Feel free to stop by, comment, or send an e-mail to goodreadingbooks@nyc.rr.com. and thanks for all to support so far.

				i would LOVE it if there was a bookstore opening in astoria. i too remember when susan terry closed and there were rumours flying EVERYWHERE that B&amp;N was going to come in.<br /><br />at one point there WAS a bookstore at ditmars, right under the train where the italian food store is now (drat i forgot the name, i have been gone too long!) - it was there when i was in middle school (mid 90&#039;s) because i remember getting some Nancy Drew Goes to College books. I was really dissappointed when it closed...but it seemed really sparse now that I think about it. there was just alot of space and not enough books. <br /><br />thats one thing...try to make the most out of the space to give the most offerings. this may seem obvious - don&#039;t clog up the shelves with like 5 copies of the same book on the shelf (sometimes i see that alot in bookstores in nyc)...one, maybe two will suffice especially if its a thick book. <br /><br />i see this alot in the shops in japan - they don&#039;t have much of one thing out on the floor, so that they can display the most amount of merchandise as possible, same thing goes in japanese bookstores, there is only maybe one, two copies of a book and if its not there is ask - most of the time its in the storage section. if you can say find a way to keep one or two copies out to maximize the shelf space, then say if a customer buys the book make a note of it, and refill the slot when necessary; to encourage people to ask if you have a particular book, u can place a sign or a notification to encourage people to ask the booksellers. <br /><br />pity harry potter is over - that would be a great way to bring people to the bookstore with a party like that - i remember mentally bitching on how i ended up slogging voluntarily to manhattan to wait all night for number 6.

				I would have sworn I searched this site on this topic before today, but maybe not!&nbsp; I, too, have a dream of a good bookstore in Astoria, and posted about a market research survey in another topic.... I truly believe the market is here, so if someone else is making the store a reality (it&#039;s just a dream for me so far), I will definitely be a customer!

				From his blog (http://goodreadingbooks.blogspot.com/), it looks like vinegartom is pretty serious and moving forward -- if that&#039;s the case, B&amp;N could kill an independent pretty quickly, if the indy didn&#039;t have a following yet.&nbsp; I&#039;d guess.

				I am SO much more interested in an independant bookstore-&nbsp; please don&#039;t lobby for a chain!&nbsp; It is harder and harder to find an independant store in the city at all.&nbsp; As a community we can support a local store, something that will contimue to make where we live special and unique!&nbsp; Isn&#039;t that more important?

				I think many here would love to see a bookstore open in Astoria.<br /><br />It seems though it would have to be a labor of love more than a desire for financial success.<br /><br /><br />Just got to wondering about a favorite book store in another city. To my relief, they are still open after many years. <br />May your hopes become real and thrive.&nbsp; &nbsp;8-)

				<br />i always hoped for a bookstore in astoria....and wondered why one doesnt exist.<br />I remember one opened up in the early 90&#039;s right under the N train (ditmars blvd station)<br />and it closed fairly quickly)<br />I think this time astoria would be ready for a bookstore, since we have alot of young and educated people moving in. The suggestions here are all great, about the caffe/lounge type of place, and being able to order books &amp; pick them up........<br /><br />Good luck...astoria really needs a bookstore........<br />but i also agree that it is very difficult for a small bookstore to succeed, and hopefully no competition like a barnes in nobles moves in somewhere.....<br /><br />

				I love disorganized weird little bookstores. Always have. It&#039;s not about finding THE book, it&#039;s about being lost in a mass of books. Which is wonderful. I do like the store on Bway. Interesting people work there and I nearly always find the book that I want. More often I find the book I didn&#039;t know I wanted.<br /><br />Oy, yes. I&#039;m uneducated and smelly.

				I agree - although organized book stores are nice, they are a bit antiseptic.&nbsp; You should go to Charing Cross Road in London.&nbsp; Those are bookstores!&nbsp; They are filled with old dusty volumes and one can spend hours looking through them.&nbsp; And yes, there is a stale book smell but that is part of the charm.

				I think a bookstore in Astoria would be great - especially one with a cafe and readings for children, poetry readings, etc.&nbsp; The more the store diversifies, the better the chance of success.&nbsp; To whoever started this chain saying they wanted to open a bookstore - if you get to the point of really doing it - contact me, maybe I can help.&nbsp; The question is where - Ditmars or Steinway - more traffic on Steinway, but more expensive.&nbsp; Ditmars more classy . . .
