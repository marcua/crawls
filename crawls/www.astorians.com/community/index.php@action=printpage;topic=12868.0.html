				We still have a good number of weeks in 2008, but I ask what are the outstanding films and suggestions for award nominations.<br /><br /><br />Recently saw<br />CHANGELING.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Eastwood. I knew very little about this film but was curious about the cast and period.<br />For me, it was a very interesting surprise.<br /><br />It is an excellent production. Not one of of Eastwood&#039;s very best, but still very good.<br />However, my taste is not so much for such drama and heaviness. And the film/story is a long one to tell (almost 2.5 hours).&nbsp; <br />Aspects of the story are certainly tragic.<br />It involves a mother in 30s Los Angeles, CA who has a missing son. And corruption of authorities who should have helped more. (That was what I understood going in.)<br /><br />The film is in muted color.<br />It is based on true history, otherwise I could not have believed such terrible events.<br /><br /><br />I hope nominations would include as well the script. From a writer who worked on Babylon AD?<br />Thumbs up, for those with even a casual interest.

				A bit about Slumdog.<br /><br /><br />It was a happy case where I did not know much about the film going in. If I had, I might have been less likely to see it.<br />So far, I think the marketing does not really reflect how the film is.<br /><br />The movie is not PG. <br />It is based on a story called Q and A which might be interesting to find.<br />The film shows episodes with some rough answers to questions like how and why does a boy growing up in the slums in India end up on a tv quiz show.<br /><br />With a standout soundtrack.<br /><br />http://www.slashfilm.com/2008/11/21/slumdog-millionaire-soundtrack/

				A couple more movie considerations.<br /><br />Surprised to have enjoyed a DVD documentary from a few years back - Wordplay.<br />As the director notes, you probably would not expect much at all of a film project about crossword puzzles, a puzzle tournament, and the people involved.<br />I loved how the movie comes together, great soundtrack, very nicely done graphics (whowouldathunk). And it probably helps that the greater NY area is featured.<br />It includes a brief interview of Mussina from the Yankees. Also, a funnier interview makes it hard for the cameraman to keep the camera from shaking.<br /><br />***<br />Saw Doubt. It has very fine acting performances. A very good script. But I dont know if the film will stick in my memory very long.<br />The writer directed the film and I liked how it appeared to me like a wonderful photo album. Around a NY church school.<br /><br />perhaps of interest, a review about the play<br /><br />http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9801E4D8123CF932A35757C0A9639C8B63<br /><br /><br /><br />As a Nun Stands Firm, The Ground Shifts Below <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&#039;&#039;Doubt, a Parable,&#039;&#039; the tight, absorbing and expertly acted new drama by John Patrick Shanley. <br />And it will probably surprise no one that this rigidly assured figure is both a nun and the head of a grade school. <br />

				More and more, I find myself wondering - <br />What films this past year did you like better than the <span class="bbc_u">Dark Knight</span>??<br /><br /><br /><br />No film yet that I&#039;ve seen really stands out for me the way <span class="bbc_u">Letters from Iwo Jima </span> did in recent years.<br /><br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Doubt </span> and <span class="bbc_u">MILK </span> have very good performances. Both are well made, though Milk seems a better film project.<br /><span class="bbc_u">Benjamin Button</span> is a pleasant surprise. Quite a draft from the adapter for Forest Gump, though I much prefer Button to, uh,Gump.<br />It is to me like a picture puzzle with many wonderful pieces but it loses me after strong passages from the start and in the middle. The supporting characters add a great deal.<br /><br /><br />

				Where the Wild Things Are;<br /><br />It&#039;s definitely not meant to be a kids movie and it gets pretty intense in both imagery and themes. I doubt anyone under the age of 13 could relate to the film.<br /><br />Production values were fantastic, notably the original soundtrack by the Yeah Yeah Yeah&#039;s Karen O, but overall I felt the film was a little too heavy-handed and not particularily subtle. It was like an over-analyzation of what childhood was like...except when we were kids nothing was over-analyzed...sooooooo I didn&#039;t really buy into it.<br /><br />I&#039;d see it just for the sensory aspects.

				I flipped a coin and was glad with the result. Caught the MJ rehearsal docu film.<br /><br />Would have enjoyed it even just for much of the music in a theater sound system. The first half is stronger to me. My favorite highlight is near the middle. Shocking that I never really enjoyed Thriller, the song/video, but it shows with much fun.<br /><br />What I missed though was a sense of recent creation. Lots of great hits, mostly nostalgic. The surrounding performers, dancers and musicians, bring more youthful energy.<br /><br /><br />http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1477715/<br /><br />Mostly agree with this person&#039;s notes:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />No one has any apology to make about this wonderful documentary, least of all Kenny Ortega. When I heard he intended to take &quot;rehearsal&quot; footage of the &quot;This Is It&quot; tour and market it as a film, I assumed it was an attempt to recoup the investment made in the project. Who could have guessed that this film would stand on its own and also enter the echelons of the &quot;best&quot; documentaries about rock music ever made? No less, Michael Jackson reveals more about himself in this footage than we&#039;ve ever seen before. It&#039;s his premiere moment on film, and I would guess he would not have wanted it shown only because we see—for the first time—Jackson without a mask. I won&#039;t attempt to characterize this complicated, insanely talented, person, but basically he&#039;s painfully shy. And he excelled at one of the most public vocations there is: performing.<br /><br /><br />What&#039;s interesting about the footage is that it exists at all. But since concerts today use video projection for the large venues where they play, it was natural to include the cameras during the rehearsal period. And it&#039;s riveting! Nothing is ever less than compelling in large part due to the level of talent in all quarters. The dancers, the musicians, the back-up singers, sets, costumes…it&#039;s a parade of the best of the best. While Jackson is the center of all of this, if you don&#039;t care for him, there&#039;s plenty of other things to look at and enjoy.<br /><br />Any sadness is brought by the viewer. There&#039;s not one nod to Jackson&#039;s demise or when it occurs. He looks thin, but even in a rehearsal mode, he&#039;s electrifying, and I think that&#039;s why the film works. We&#039;re not at some huge arena (for which the concert was conceived) with 10,000 screaming fans. And <strong>rather than missing that electricity, we get intimate performances </strong> &nbsp;of familiar Jackson material. But it&#039;s re-imagined and you never know what&#039;s coming next.<br /><br />An alert: there is footage throughout the final credit sequence and after the credits end. And if you can, see it in a DP theater...for the sound alone. An amazing experience! <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Just saw Fantastic Mr. Fox the other night and it was really amazing.&nbsp; You can read my full review here:&nbsp; http://blogs.pavaline.com/dgonzalez/post.cfm/fantastic-mr-fox-is-fantastic<br /><br />It would be really cool if it got the Oscar win, but I can&#039;t decide if I liked this or the Secret of Kells better.&nbsp; So many great animated films this year!!!&nbsp; Must go see Princess and the Frog soon - maybe this weekend.&nbsp;

				Hmm, wonder if FFox should be our next movie outing.<br /><br />Any other recent recommendations?<br />I thought Up in the Air was pretty empty. Avatar is an action scifi spectacular.<br />Very glad to see The Hurt Locker is gaining some appreciation.<br />&nbsp;:-o&nbsp; &nbsp;:-o<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Finally, but painfully, caught up with last year&#039;s Synedoche NY. WTF<br />Really, WTWTF. Makes Leaving Las Vegas to me a slapstick romedy.<br /><br />&nbsp;:x&nbsp; &nbsp;:cry:&nbsp; &nbsp;:killme:<br />[I wonder what Ebert likes to drink]

				Does anyone stream movies?<br />The discussion below has me wondering more.<br /><br />http://www.slate.com/id/2240458/entry/2240462/<br /><br />[Not a big fan generally of the slate site]<br /><br />DGA has their nominees.<br />I have no real guess who would win, but I would love to see Bigelow awarded. <br />It would also be fun to see Tarantion take it.<br />Has anyone actually seen Precious, and if yes, is it really so well put together? <br />Odd that I thought I could handle Basterds, but not the other. I guess cinema fantastique is easier for me.<br /><br /><br />http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-dga8-2010jan08,0,6644510.story<br /><br />Hurt Locker<br />Inglorious Basterds<br />Precious<br />Up in the Air<br />Avatar<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />An older, and very very very lovely review.<br />http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100102/REVIEWS08/100109999/-1/RSS<br /><br />

				<br />A caution for the movie Shutter Island.<br />Like a few of Scorsese films, I was disappointed but find myself thinking about it at times.<br /><br />May write more if any would be interested. There is a lot of talent involved (fun casting), but the bizarre and dark subjects were almost campy.<br />I actually wonder if another director could have made a much better picture with the script.<br /><br />If I were seeing it again, I would pay closer attention to the various characters and for me especially the scene where he is interviewing patients.<br />Creepy, unfortunate to not recommend it.<br /><br />&nbsp;:cry:&nbsp; &nbsp;:evil:

				Oh that&#039;s too bad to hear.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only heard good things, but they all agreed it was creepy.&nbsp; I think I&#039;d like to check it out regardless.<br /><br />I did see Crazy Heart and it was really great.&nbsp; The soundtrack was fun and enjoyable and the acting was superb.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Wolfman on the other hand....&nbsp; ick.&nbsp; Just didn&#039;t live up to expectations.....

				Where is the real Shutter Island?<br />There are debates whether the film is predictable. I was thinking of other films, but Ebert interestingly ties it to Edgar Allen Poe.<br />Though I thought the movie was not worth the ticket price, I am very intrigued by the idea of the graphic novel (and the novel as well).<br /><br />http://www.tokyopop.com/product/2857<br /><br /><br />And I think this interview is really kinda kick ass talking about adaptations and writing:<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-yaCVM6to<br /><br />&quot;I owe it artist to artist to shut the hell up.&quot;<br />[The ideas that inspired him are quite interesting. And he actually played in an old mental institute growing up. Yikes.]<br /><br />Anyone seen, recommend, Gone baby gone<br /><br /><br />[<br /><br />http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/02/lawmakers-renew-patriot-act/<br /><br />]

				<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/movies/awardsseason/07Scott.html<br /><br />Whatever happens (almost), great.<br />Just please, Avatar really the best picture???<br /><br />It would be nice for Bullock. I wonder though if there should be a lifetime honor already for Streep.<br />Most interesting may be the writing awards.<br /><br />&quot;The Hurt Locker&quot; and &quot;Up in the Air&quot; have won the top feature screenplay awards from the Writers Guild of America.<br /><br />Might want to see Crazy Heart at some point.
