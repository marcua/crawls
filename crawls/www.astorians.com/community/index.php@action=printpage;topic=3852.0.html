				Jumping to a new thread from the Project Runway one - I did catch ATC last night and thought it was great.&nbsp; Some real characters in this one - it should be interesting.&nbsp; Lots of New Yorkers as well - I like the woman from Brooklyn, and the guy who won the competition last night seems very interesting.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t like the ingredients this episode and hope they&#39;re not going to be so &quot;out there&quot; all season - frog legs and liver?&nbsp; I&#39;m squeamish about weird meats myself, but I liked seeing what they came up with.&nbsp; Who else caught the first episode?

				I of course caught the first episode... I was sorry that they let go the woman rather than the man, even though both were caught up in nerves. but oh well...<br /><br />and why am I not surprised that once again, one of the chosen contestants is an ego trip and a half who thinks he knows flavors and will go over the top.<br /><br />so far I&#39;m rooting for Ilan and also the woman chef from Mexico... but we&#39;ll see what happens.

				Im going to hold off a bit on reaction and favorites and see where it goes.&nbsp; We all know they get people baed on emotions and style not just chef skills.&nbsp; We saw last season pared down to those with skills and those without. Nice to see Harold perk up once cooking and tasting got involved. He doesnt look too comfortable just standing there.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyone know about his new place opening in NYC?<br /><br />

				I always take a wait-and-see attitude for the first few episodes of a reality show. I get too involved with looks and personalities . . . and then on to the project at hand. Remember me, I started the thread <span class="bbc_u">Addicted To Non-News TV</span> (http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=2986.0). But, there is something abut Otto that I already like.

				Yes, I have Colicchio&#39;s Think Like a Chef book. It&#39;s very good. Not a comprehensive cookbook at all, and not really a traditional celeb-chef &quot;these are my best recipes&quot; book, but basically its title. The core of the book are several chapters where he takes a trio of ingredients and does a series of variations on them. I definitely recommend it. It&#39;s helped me get more creative with recipes.

				Harlan&#39;s reveiw is dead on. One of the best books for people to see the simplicity of serious technique.&nbsp; The chef focus on technique rather than recipes lets you see the importance of skill over collections of recipes.<br /><br />Highly recommended<br />Easy to understand<br />Strong on technique and ways of thinking around cooking

				We&#39;ve been watching. New one tomorrow.&nbsp; Cliff may be turning out to be a jerk or just a very cool solid chef.&nbsp; Betty is fun and sweet but will most likely be out soon.&nbsp; I think Elan will go to the end, maybe Sam too. Mike will go out pretty quick at this point.&nbsp; If Elia makes it to the end, it will only be because somehow she didn&#39;t ruin her chances along the way.<br /><br />Love the new host.

				You were right about Betty!&nbsp; What did folks think of last night&#39;s episode?&nbsp; I was shocked by Elan&#39;s outburst, though I think he looks like a good chef.&nbsp; Is Marcel really that irritating?&nbsp; I just find him mildly annoying (and I suspect that&#39;s as much for the bad hairdo as the foams).

				I think Marcel is just a kid but an extremely educated (Master chef rating) and smug individual and that might get in his way.&nbsp; On the other hand its all about the food in the end and his skills are very strong. <br /><br />Elan might have been booted off because of dissing marcel to the guests and getting the other chefs not to help Marcel serve.&nbsp; If the other chefs did a better job and all the food was good, I bet he would have been kicked off for potentially wrecking a dinner and that is a big no no.&nbsp; And yes his outbursts were surprising, same for Sam.&nbsp; I bet some behind the scenes footage would explain a lot.<br /><br />Elia will probably get herself tossed just before the end.&nbsp; She doesn&#39;t get anything about this country or teamwork.&nbsp; She is very talented but unless she comes around she might ruin it for herself.<br /><br />Love Mike. He&#39;s a misfit and not as talented but he sure can pull off some amazing dishes.<br /><br />Sam is doing great as a leader and strong talent but has won anything for his food recently?<br /><br />Cliff is a dick and proved it with the holiday episode. Talented yes but also a sneak.<br />

				I do hear you - but he has been a judge on there, right?&nbsp; Maybe he could be a regular judge and they get another mentor - I just would like to get more of an idea of what they&#39;re cooking and what they&#39;re thinking.&nbsp; It does move in a different pace and manor than Project Runway.&nbsp; I do think an actual chef would be a good idea!<br />I&#39;m actually not as much of an Elan fan as I was, I think he&#39;s been a bit juvenile in his reactions to Marcel.&nbsp; I had been a big Betty fan, but at this point I like Sam and Elia best.&nbsp; Cliff seems really mean, though probably a good cook.&nbsp; Marcel has such weird ideas.&nbsp;

				Good point about Elan.&nbsp; At this point I am thinking of just two things; Cooking skill and management /people skills.&nbsp; That would be Sam first.&nbsp; Cooking skills only would be Elia, Elan or Marcel then Cliff.<br /><br />A good idea might be a take off on a confession booth room.&nbsp; They could talk about that days quick fire challenge and the cook off.&nbsp; See where their heads were about food/idea/plan. Vent about food, judges and fellow cooks. It would give us more insight into their personalities.&nbsp; Not that any of it matters in the end but it would let the viewers learn more.

				Same here.&nbsp; Can&#39;t believe they got rid of Sam.&nbsp; I think over all he should have made it to the finals. Marcel deserved it, he really blew them away last night.&nbsp; That being said, it is about the food that night. Elan did great but Sam is very talented.

				Last night really upset me :x IMHO it came down to the fact that they (the producers, judges, etc.) want to see Elon and Marcel go at each other in the final challenge. I feel that Sam carried himself strongly throughout the whole competition and although he did not win too many elimination challenges, won many quick fire challenges, was a strong leader, had great dishes (minus the beach disaster, lol) and although at times came off a little cocky, should have gone up against either Elon or Elia, Marcel I think almost did a doo doo in his pants when they announced he was a winner and quite honestly he really has not impressed me at all this season (not that many of them did) except for the fact that he really did an outstanding job at getting under peoples skin. If I decide to watch the finally (me and a Dr. I work with said today we were boycotting the last show, lol) my vote will def. be for Elon. Once again Bravo threw us a curve ball just like on Project Runway :roll: Just my .02 <br /><br />P.S. Gossip, Gossip :-o Did you hear that Elon left Mario Batali&#39;s Casa Mono??<br />http://gawker.com/news/top-chef/top-chefs-ilan-quits-his-job-at-casa-mono-because-231215.php

				very interesting!&nbsp; and thanks for the link.<br />Bravo does love their drama - I got too wrapped up in the Project Runway Season 3 drama, though I liked all four finalists.&nbsp; I do agree that Sam should not have been eliminated.&nbsp; Ilan has been good throughout the season, but strikes me as a bit immature, though he&#39;s been more consistent than Marcel, who has come up with some really scary looking stuff throughout the competition.&nbsp; In his defense, he did seem to come up with the best dish that episode.&nbsp; I still miss Betty and wish that Carlos or Mia had remained.
