				They have it at Indigo (31st St, betw. 30th Ave &amp; Newtown -- right by the 30th Ave subway stop). I&#039;ve gotten the eggs benedict a couple of times and thought it was good. I recommend their bloody mary as well.<br /><br />Indigo is great for brunch in general-- $13.95 for brunch entree + 2 drinks. And they serve brunch Sat &amp; Sun til 4:00.

				Ah ha, a question I am very qualified to answer!&nbsp; I eat eggs benedict every week for brunch, it&#039;s required, so I know pretty much every restaurant in the &#039;hood that serves &#039;em!<br /><br />Like said above, Ovelia and Indigo are both pretty good.&nbsp; Last time I visited (which in some cases has been awhile, so YMMV!), you can also get &#039;em at:<br />*Flo (38th St and 30th Ave)<br />*718 (Ditmars and 35th St)<br />*Blackstone (38th and Broadway) - although, hmm, they were renovating last time I went a few months ago, anyone been recently?<br />*Michael&#039;s Restaurant (33rd and Broadway)<br />*Stove (45th St and 28th Ave)

				fyi wrt Blackstone - walked in last week to ask if they still had brunch since I didn&#039;t see the menu in the window.&nbsp; The bartender said yes BUT NOT WITH THE UNLIMITED DRINKS!&nbsp; We&#039;re devastated.

				If you&#039;re feeling extra ambitious it&#039;s an easy dish to replicate in your home.&nbsp; Alton Brown&#039;s Hollandaise recipe is super easy, albeit slightly time consuming:<br />http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/hollandaise-recipe/index.html<br />Any time I make a ham I inevitably buy a good loaf of bread at Gian Piero and make myself my some eggs benedict, an unconventional eggs benedict for sure, but a better-than-a-restaurant version for certain.
