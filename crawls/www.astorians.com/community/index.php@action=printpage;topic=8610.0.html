				So the new season of Amazing Race has begun, sooner that earlier reported (I think it was supposed to be a mid-season show but they cancelled Viva Laughlin).&nbsp; I also read somewhere no non-elimnation legs this season.<br /><br />So anyone watching?&nbsp; Any thoughts.&nbsp; I was glad to see that the shallow girl and her shallow catty gay best friend were eliminated first leg for not knowing how to treat a donkey with respect and I&#039;m waiting for the asian father daughter team to have a total meltdown (he&#039;s insane).

				Was he gay?&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t certain if he was or wasn&#039;t.&nbsp; He annoyed the daylights out of me and I have to admit I was happy to see him go.<br /><br />I was sad to see the lesbian ministers go.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to see the Asian dad gone next - I can&#039;t believe how he talks down to his daughter.&nbsp; I think the grandson, grandfather team is likely to be gone soon.&nbsp; The goths amuse me.&nbsp; <br /><br />I love this show!

They are adventuresome and they seem to get along so well with each other. The Asian Dad and Daughter just might have the best learning experience of the entire show. If he would only take a few more minutes to listen to how his words affect her (and their relationship) they could end up being a happy family. I keep wishing for an all girl team to win. I&#039;m not sure the blondes stand a chance, though.<br /><br />This is the only reality show that ever won an Emmy. It&#039;s still my favorite.
