My Express bus driver on the QM2A is black and he is a very nice person. Plus East Elmhurst is shady and deeply run down and I was attempting to strike a comparison between what Billyboy said about the South Bronx and East Elmhurst. Transplants who try unbalance a neighborhood and run away from it because it is not &quot;cool&quot; anymore annoys me more than all the blacks, hispanics, and any other minority in the world becasue there are very nice people in those groups. Heck the White people in Key Food on Parsons Boulevard and Willets Point Boulevard are absolute rednecks and bastards and the Indian lady &quot;Konta&quot; is very nice compared to &quot;Jenna&quot; and &quot;Andrea&quot; in Dan&#039;s Key Food on 25-03 Parsons Boulevard.<br />

				You&#039;ve got Mermaids on 31 Street somewhere, and Riviera on Steinway.&nbsp; Then there are Scandals and Gentlemans Club in Queens Plaza.&nbsp; There used to more, along with some prostitutes working the cars, but they&#039;re long gone...&nbsp; Don&#039;t know if Club 23 is still open.<br /><br />I think they&#039;re still around, but probably just behind closed doors...
