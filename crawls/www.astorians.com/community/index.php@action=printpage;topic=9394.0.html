				Hey Astorians!<br />I&#039;ve been here awhile but not sure where to go on this one. I&#039;ll have a group of 8 people looking to imbibe at 11pm on Saturday. I was thinking about finding a spot where I could reserve some space.It&#039;s a busy time so I know I don&#039;t want to be standing up squashed with all my peeps trying to have a conversation. Any ideas of bars that would let me reserve some space near 34th St &amp;&nbsp; Broadway? Something chill,lowkey. Townie barish. No Cavo nightclubiness.Any recommends are helpful.<br />Cheers!

				The ONLY place I can think of in that area that has a nice backroom is Cold Stone (formerly known as Mary Mcguires) on Broadway btw. 38th and Steinway.

				Indigo Lounge on 31st and 30th Ave has a second floor.&nbsp; Someone also recommended McLoughlins and Brick to me, although I&#039;ve never been to McLoughlins and I&#039;ve been to Brick but I can&#039;t visualize a party room there.

				McLoughlin&#039;s is a slightly divey Irish bar- my favorite kind! They have a pool table and a decent juke box. Not sure what the back room looks like- but I can&#039;t imagine that its too fancy.<br /><br />It is located on Broadway between 31 Street and 32nd street- near the Army Navy store.
