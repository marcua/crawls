				They used to (still may) have a digital design posted outside, it looked awesome. For me the most important part of places like that is seating, and it looks like it&#039;ll be a nice place to grab a coffee, bagel and read for a while. I think it&#039;ll be a great addition.

				Anyone heard any further word on this? I walk by every day hoping it&#039;ll be open, and it&#039;s still being worked on. The other day they were sweeping the floors (which seems like a good sign), but I didn&#039;t get to ask said sweeper when they planned on opening. Just wondering cause it&#039;s been a long time......

				So we checked this place out today!<br /><br />We were super excited, because though we love Brooklyn Bagel and Astoria Bagels, we really did need another bagel place in this area, in my opinion. Brooklyn Bagel is delicious, but it always has a line out the door and it&#039;s hard to find a seat. I like Astoria Bagels because it&#039;s right next to my house and cheap, but they don&#039;t cook eggs. Neither place is open late though, so you can&#039;t just go hang out with a coffee in the evening (which you can&#039;t at our Starbucks either). This new place is open till 10pm! yay!<br /><br />First thought upon walking in - terrible music (which Brooklyn Bagel also suffers from), TVs (which we don&#039;t like because you end up just staring at the TV... also when we were there they were showing Dr. Oz and something about intestinal parasites, not good to watch while eating, AND it was on Fox... BUT I can understand the really early morning crowd probably wants to watch the news there... but seriously, Fox?)<br />Second thought - hats. I felt like I was in Brooklyn... I guess its kind of cute, but I can&#039;t help thinking everyone wearing this cute matching fedora hats... is dumb. We&#039;re in Astoria. Just got a super hipster impression. Lots of seats though!! And the interior is really nice.<br /><br />Food and coffee though - delicious! Pricier than the same order would be at Brooklyn Bagel, and we ordered mini bagels. Note - the mini bagels are really small. These aren&#039;t Brooklyn Bagel mini sizes. They are small. Next time we&#039;ll be ordering the regular size. They were super tasty though. We got two everything bagels, one with veggie cream cheese, and one with ham egg and cheese. Yum! The iced coffee was great too, and we liked that you can put your own sugar and cream in, so you don&#039;t have to worry about it being too sweet. Pretty sure there&#039;s a bathroom in the back too, always good. And the pastries looked awesome.<br /><br />Anyway, there is my first impression. I will definitely be back!!!<br />

They are around the same price, but you get more food at Brooklyn Bagel (BB). We just compared our bill to the same bill at BB and BB actually cost around 20 cents more (for the same order), BUT the mini bagels are so much bigger at BB. The minis we got at the new place were really small. Maybe it was just that time, I&#039;ll have to go again and compare! So I&#039;d say they are around the same. I&#039;ll have to also compare their big sizes. I can barely eat the large at BB, but I do love me some bread, so those tiny bagels just didn&#039;t cut it for me. I will only order the bigger size at the new place now.<br /><br />To put it briefly - a regular ice coffee at the new place was 3.00. At BB, 2.50. The bagels at BB cost more... but are also bigger. I will continue to go to both places!<br /><br />As for the music, I admit my taste is different from others, but they definitely played an old Goo Goo Dolls song, and all of the music was similar to that.... not my thing. I don&#039;t expect anyone to play my kind of music (metal) in a restaurant, but I do like many other things. Anyway it&#039;s not a big deal, it was just a first impression!

BB&#039;s &quot;mini&quot; bagels are still pretty big and not really &quot;mini&quot; in my eyes. I much prefer the size of mini bagel at the new place. I also had a second cappuccino - really solid and tasty. The place was pretty busy, which is good to see. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves, too. I can see myself being a regular there. I will still patronize The Coffee Pot, though, located across the street - I love their coffee.

				I stopped in yesterday to check it out.&nbsp; To me, it looks like it was heavily influenced by Brooklyn Bagel in terms of set up - which is not a bad thing, IMO, since I like Brooklyn Bagel.&nbsp; The interior design is definitely more modern and nice, tho.&nbsp; Much more spacious, too, which is great.&nbsp; The small amount of seats at BB has always been annoying.&nbsp; I like their iced tea more than BB.&nbsp; I only ordered a bagel for my husband, who proclaimed it more bready than the ones at BB, but maybe he just got a dud.&nbsp; I&#039;m excited about the place - BB was such a long haul for us and Astoria bagel is decent, but not a place where you&#039;d really want to sit down and spend time.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Hahahah, I went in yesterday with my kids and my son (he&#039;s 4) was asking me about the music.&nbsp; I told him it was an &quot;old&quot; band - the Red Hot Chili Peppers.&nbsp; Funny enough, the songs my kids think of as &quot;oldies&quot; are the ones from the mid/late 90&#039;s.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I really liked the place, though!&nbsp; My son and I split a mini bagel with cream cheese and a blueberry muffin, and that plus a small coffee was about $6.25.&nbsp; Reasonable, and the interior was nice and seating was comfy. <br /><br /><br />Definitely a good addition to the neighborhood, and packed at 10 on a Friday morning.&nbsp; I think they&#039;ll do well.

				I&#039;ve been nearly every morning since the Saturday after they opened, whenever that was. On weekdays I get a bagel to go and a cup of coffee. I think the coffee is better than at BB. I think the bagels at BB are better, though. NYCBCH bagels, to me, are good enough. Nice chewiness on the outside but maybe a bit too light and airy on the inside. I like a bagel with a bit more density and chew--like at BB. That said, the bagels are not a dealbreaker for me. <br /><br />The one thing that&#039;s started to drive me crazy there, though, are the cashiers—or, really, the computer cash-register.&nbsp; The cashiers are nice, friendly people, don&#039;t get me wrong. But only twice have I given my order without them asking me to repeat it. It&#039;s clear the cash register is prompting them on all the steps—from whether its to stay or to go, to whether you want your cream-cheese bagel toasted, to whether you want light- or dark-roast coffee. So no matter if I give a simple order all at once—&quot;sesame bagel with cre cheese, not toasted, and a small dark-roast coffee&quot;—they&#039;re fiddling with the cash register, not listening, and then ask for each detail of the order again: &quot;What kind of bagel? Do you want anything on it? Toasted?&quot;<br /><br />I hope the owners notice this and fix the system, as it a bit annoying. <br /><br />Other than that, I really like this place and am glad to have it as another option to BB, Astoria Bagels, and Bagel House.

				I had the same experience on my 2 visits to NYCBCH.&nbsp; &nbsp;One time I ordered a large coffee and a half dozen bagels to go.&nbsp; It turned into a debacle and I was ready to walk out.&nbsp; &nbsp;3 people had to work the register for a rather simple order.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />I agree that the coffee is better here but the bagels are better at Brooklyn Bagel.&nbsp; The thing that I like about BB is that they are always fresh and sometimes warm.&nbsp; &nbsp;While the bagels ate NYCBCH were not stale...they were not super fresh either and I think this is unacceptable on a Sunday morning.&nbsp; &nbsp;The are a little too airy as you mentioned and I think they could use some more flavor too (malt?).&nbsp; &nbsp;The other thing that I thought was odd was that they wrapped the bagels in sets of twos.&nbsp; kind of a waste and unnecessary.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />When I was there the owner watched the debacle at the register and followed me outside when i left.&nbsp; He apologized for the problems and said they were still figuring things out.&nbsp; I am sure that he realizes that BB has a system that will get you in and out in minutes even with a line out the door.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />I like this place and it is much closer to me than BB.&nbsp; &nbsp;I hope that it gets past some of these early hiccups which are not too big of a deal.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve become a big fan of the cold brewed coffee there at NYCBCH (amped up with half-and-half). I am an &quot;every once in a while&quot; sort of bagel eater - 5 servings of bread at once is hard for my digestion to take. Their mini bagels (maybe 2 servings of bread there) suit me fine every once in a while. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve not had any noticeable problems with the cashiers but my orders have always been painfully basic, with little opportunity to screw it up, so I&#039;m not a good standard to hold to in this respect. I love that they are so close to my apartment. On one of the warm days this week they had the big front door-windows open. It was pretty neat to see.

				@megc: The mini bagels are a good size, I agree. I like the place a lot. (Was just there this morning again.) My orders are painfully basic, too. &quot;Sesame bagel, cream cheese, not toasted.&quot; This morning, once again, &quot;What kind of bagel?&quot; I also think the system must start all the prompts with &quot;For here or to go?&quot; because they often interrupt me as I&#039;m partway through ordering to ask if I&#039;m staying or going. If they insist on using this computer, it should have the flexibility that you can input To Stay or To Go at any point in the process.

				I tend to speak my order slowly on purpose, especially when the place is crowded and loud, like yesterday late morning. I couldn&#039;t believe how busy it was! After I told the cashier my order, she repeated it back to me without error. I could tell, though, that it was hard for her to hear because of the din. My bagel was pretty fresh - still warm so that it started to melt the cream cheese a little bit.

				Following up here to amend something I said earlier. In the month or so after it first opened, I groused about the cashiers&#039; lack of listening.<br /><br /><br />That&#039;s changed. Either they&#039;ve gotten so used to their cash-register system or the owners have changed it, but the service has noticeably improved and is nearly flawless and smooth now. Just wanted to give credit where credit&#039;s due.

				I also have revisited (many times) since they opened and agree that the register issues are long gone.&nbsp; &nbsp;they have the place running very smoothly at this point.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I think that the place is fantastic.&nbsp; I find the bagels to be some of the best around.&nbsp; I prefer their minis.&nbsp; They have the nice crisp outer crush with a dense/chewy center.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />they make a mean breakfast special too.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Am I stupid or what. I eat bagels maybe twice a year at the most, but figured I&#039;d give this place a shot since I walk by everyday. I ordered a plain bagel lightly toasted with lox, cream cheese, onion to go. I paid 10.98 for this- temporary insanity, I suppose. Walked home salivating, thinking how wonderful this very expensive bagel was going to taste, trying to justify the high price. Boy was I wrong. The lox were very bland, the shredded red onions must&#039;ve been (par)boiled there was no taste, I had to add a slice of red onion from my fridge and the plain bagel was just plain wrong--slightly sweet--yuck. What a disappointment-especially at $10.98! What a waste.<br />Next time I want to spend over ten bucks for a bagel I&#039;ll get a super Heebster at Russ and Daughters.

				Yeah, I thought I was being a bit harsh, and I know I have only myself to blame-no one forced me to pay that much for a pretty lousy tasting bagel, and I know the owners have to pay for the fancy decor, but I&#039;m not rich and $10.98 is way too expensive for this Astoria resident.

				Next time I get a craving for cream cheese and lox I&#039;ll try Brooklyn Bagel. I would pay ten+ bucks once in a while if it&#039;s really really tasty.

I&#039;m not aware of any place in Astoria that sells lox anywhere near the quality of what&#039;s offered at Russ &amp; Daughters. <br /><br />That said, I tried this place for the first time over the weekend and was pleased with my mini-everything bagel (which, like Brooklyn Bagel&#039;s mini bagels, are the size of a normal bagel) with the lox-flavored cream cheese, which cost $3. I also like the coffee lids they use, the kind you can close.

				Thanks essen. You just saved me ten dollars and I won&#039;t have to subject everyone to my rant about Brooklyn Bagel&#039;s lox. Maybe I&#039;ll just purchase a couple of mini bagels to go and prepare my own breakfast at home. This new place is just too hectic and noisy for me on a weekend in the AM.<br /><br /><br />No, Yaxpac I wasn&#039;t expecting Russ and Daughters quality,&nbsp; I just really didn&#039;t like the taste and I don&#039;t think it&#039;s worth almost eleven dollars. I&#039;ll save my money instead.<br /><br /><br />

				Hey ACME isn&#039;t half bad. I love their smoked white fish and some will say their products are just as good as Russ and Daughters, but this bagel was bad. Maybe they blanched the salmon as well as the onion.

				Try Bagel Nosh on Broadway. I can&#039;t guarantee you&#039;ll like it but I find both the bagels and the nova better than I&#039;ve found at any other Astoria bagel shop. The bagels don&#039;t have the weird hint of sweetness that other shops&#039; bagels have, and the nova is sliced thinner and more tender. They&#039;re no cheaper than the other stores - maybe even a little more expensive.

				Thanks goldfish boy. I&#039;ll check them out. I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll like it better than the place on 23rd Ave! I&#039;m not a cream cheese and lox snob and don&#039;t mind paying a little extra for something if it&#039;s tasty and made right.
