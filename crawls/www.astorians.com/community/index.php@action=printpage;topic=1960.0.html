				Anyone know of any lounges in astoria - that might be good to bring a first date?&nbsp; On a wednesday?&nbsp; Something where the music isn&#39;t too loud, or the entertainment too distracting, so that you could get to know one another?&nbsp; &nbsp;Or should I just settle for a greek cafe?&nbsp; <br /><br />Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Websites are also helpful.<br />Thanks!<br />

				Rapture is on 28th Ave and 35th St. but i think the music can be a bit overwhelming for a first &quot;getting to know you&quot; date. A cute little cafe opened up down the block from it though - Wassi. It could almost be a regular Astorian Greek joint, but its really quaint looking with a 2 tables outside and a small inside. its on 28th Ave and 37th i think.

				Cafe Bar is great. Its on 34 avenue and 35 or 36th street. The service is a little slow, but the food is good and it is a mellow relaxing atmosephere. They serve alcoholic drinks, all differant types of coffee and food.<br /><br />I went on my first date with my now husband there!&nbsp; :-D

				thanks guys, I think we may try Sunswick and possibly Cafe Bar if we don&#39;t like Sunswick.&nbsp; &nbsp;I do want to try Rapture at some point, but maybe not on a first date.&nbsp; Maybe the second or third though :)&nbsp;

				I would like to let everyone know that Sunswick bar is a great place to bring a first date.&nbsp; The music is not too loud, the place is not too crowded, the food is awesome, and the staff are really friendly.&nbsp; I had a shrimp quesadilla and it far surpassed most pub fare.&nbsp; My date had a burger, he seemed to enjoy it.<br /><br />Thanks for all your suggestions, I definitely still have to try them, they all sounded really good.&nbsp; By the way, I did learn about Sunswick from this board,&nbsp; and joey in astoria.&nbsp; &nbsp;Do they still have ladies night?&nbsp; Anyone want to organize that?

				So what happened to Ladies Night?&nbsp; I&#39;ve been in Astoria for six months now, and I&#39;m finding it hard to meet new people without going to one of the big loud clubs, which is really not my scene.<br /><br />I&#39;d love to put together a ladies night.&nbsp; If anyone else is still interested.

				Sunswick is right on the corner of 35th St and 35th Ave.&nbsp; I&#39;ve only been there once, for lunch, but the waitress was great - attentive, yet not annoying, and really sweet - and my burger was delish!&nbsp; Great atmosphere,&nbsp; even at lunch. Cozy, fun, warm (not temperature, but friendly-wise), an interesting mix of people.&nbsp; I&#39;m looking forward to going there again.
