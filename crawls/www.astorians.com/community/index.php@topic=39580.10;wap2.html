Pointing to the National Review for any substantive news, the publication that *still* decries the civil rights movement, is like grocery shopping in a dumpster.&nbsp; How can you possibly beleive that Trump is not a crimnal? How could you possibly beleive he gives a s*!t about the working class? This man has never had to work for anything. Not withstanding that he denies that climate change exists, wants to overturn the 35 year old Roe v. Wade (what&#039;s next, woman can&#039;t vote?), and his running mate has said that he believes in shock therapy as treatment for homosexuality.<br /><br /><br />This election will affect all Americans, and all Astorians. In day one after the election there are myriad reports of hate crimes happening en-mass around the country. Trump himself is not the biggest problem, he is too stupid to do too much damage alone, but he has given a voice to the far right who still believe that this country should by white and christian.<br /><br /><br />How do you reconcile the KKK publicly supporting Trump for President? How do you feel about the KKK and White Nationalist throwing a &quot;victory party&quot; to celebrate the elections? This is not 1930, we are a nation of immigrants, we celebrate religious, ethnic and gender diversity. Mexicans are not coming here to take your jobs, all Muslims aren&#039;t terrorist, and homosexuality is not metal illness. New York and Astoria in particular are melting pots built on the hard work of immigrants and we intend to not let our country roll back to the stone ages because 59 million under-educated, under-informed, naive voters don&#039;t care if we go down in a ball of flames.

			Then you too, should be dissatisfied by these results. I&#039;m not saying Hilary is perfect, but I did vote for her for the good of my black, latino, muslim, and gay friends, and for the safety of our planet.
