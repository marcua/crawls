				This is my livelihood, I work at an investment firm and how we do all depends on the market...this is why I&#039;m struggling to start a business on my own.&nbsp; So far I have a corporation set up for my coffee (which is taking off slowly but it is taking off) and my sole proprietorship &quot;Pegasus Painting Services&quot; which has really taken off quite well (I just have to take real good care of the painter ... smirk smirk).<br /><br />My opinion?&nbsp; It&#039;s going to take at least two terms before we see the economy change for the better.&nbsp; This administration has incurred way too many debts and even though I look forward (as I&#039;m sure everyone else) to the rebate check I can&#039;t help but to think...where is this money coming from if this country already has a catastrophic deficit.&nbsp; It&#039;s a short term solution that may cause even more long term problems.

				When the stock market goes on sale like this the world&#039;s greatest investors don&#039;t let their money sit idle, they BUY. Do what Warren Buffet does, when the market goes on sale buy more. That&#039;s what I&#039;m doing. Once you get close to retirement slowly change your portfolio to more conservative stuff. Just think of the people who were buying in 2002, right after 9/11 when we all thought the world was going to end. Because they bought at low prices they are now doing very well, despite the recent downturn in the market.

				What do you think of this? Seems like this current crop of Republicans have been capitalists only in philosophy, the governement is partly responsible for the recession we&#039;re in now, financial experts have complained about government&#039;s big spending and now they are saying that if a democrat gets into office, not only will the President be a democrat, but also the House and Congress. That will mean bigger spending, expanded government rather than limited gov&#039;t, higher income taxes, goodbye capital gains, dividends, etc...<br /><br />http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS123428+02-Jan-2008+BW20080102<br />

The market has increased thousands of times over since 1900.&nbsp; The direction of the market is up and, while there might be a few months/weeks/years of pain, the market has always recovered and went on to new highs.&nbsp; Even during the crash of 1929 and subsequent depression, stocks rose dramatically above that level.&nbsp; It took 20 years, but it still occurred.&nbsp; <br /><br />2. (Most important) Because you are investing over a long term and have many years till you are going to be using the money in your 401k, you WANT the market to go down.&nbsp; When the market goes down, you are getting more for your money.&nbsp; That same amount you have always aside monthly from your earnings is now buying MORE shares than it was when the market was up.&nbsp; It&#039;s called Dollar Cost Averaging and, in down markets, is a great thing.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, don&#039;t drive yourself nuts worrying about where your 401ks are now, because it&#039;ll only make you crazy.&nbsp; Personally, I think we&#039;ll see the market drop down quite a bit more over the next year or two.&nbsp; If that&#039;s the case, your balances are only going to shrink more.&nbsp; BUT, remember that you are also adding MORE to your position each month at a lower price, which lowers your overall buy-in average, and only means that you&#039;ll make even more money when the market goes back up.<br /><br />If you&#039;re not currently investing in the market and you&#039;re considering it, holding off might not be a bad idea.&nbsp; It&#039;s never good to try to &quot;pick a bottom&quot; and invest when you think something has gotten &quot;cheap,&quot; because, inevitably, it will drop further right after you by.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s a stock investment axiom.&nbsp; <br /><br />Much like the subway axiom: Whichever train you are waiting for, two will come that are going the other direction or pass the station going express before the one you need shows up.

Nationalized healthcare won&#039;t cost us anything, class warfare is good for the country (aka contempt for capitalism), abolish the IRS, tax the corporations even more (I&#039;ve heard American corps. are already some of the highest taxed in the world), mortgage bailouts, pie-in-the-sky blather; McCain is now jumping on the tax cutters&#039; bandwagon, saying how he backed Reagan&#039;s tax cuts and how he is a fiscal conservative! This election and all the candidates are really starting to annoy me.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I couldn&#039;t agree more.&nbsp; But, it sure sounds great in a sound bit and the sheeple love it!&nbsp; I&#039;m curious how the hell we&#039;re going to pay for this tax cut and $140 billion dollar stimulus package.&nbsp; Maybe just print more money and increase the national deficit?&nbsp; Sounds like a great plan.&nbsp; If people spend the $800/$1600 that they get on debt, it is not going to help the economy as it is considered past GDP growth.<br /><br />To me, this economic bailout highlights a much larger problem: The lack of taking responsibility for one&#039;s own actions.&nbsp; Flippers, real estate agents, mortgage brokers, Wall Street banks, and, yes, the Average Joe/Jane all let greed run their judgments and get us in this mess.&nbsp; Common sense (you want HOW much for that house/condo/co-op?) went out the window because all they could see was profit.&nbsp; It was a game of musical chairs, passing property and profits along until the music stopped.&nbsp; Well, the music stopped and there are a ton of people left standing.&nbsp; <br /><br />Instead of &quot;taking their medicine&quot; for being greedy, they want bailed out.&nbsp; The politicians clamoring for office are all too quick to promise the bail out, yet they give no explanation as to HOW they&#039;re gonna do it or how our government can afford it without driving further into debt.&nbsp; <br /><br />They just keep promising unicorns and rainbows and they&#039;ll get elected; likely whoever paints the prettiest picture.&nbsp; Unfortunately for them, and for the public, they aren&#039;t real or you can&#039;t touch them.&nbsp; We&#039;ll have to pay for this greed sometime.&nbsp; Maybe the politicians can work something out that abates it for awhile, but it&#039;s only going to drive us further into debt.<br /><br />People seem to forget that everything in life goes in a cycle.&nbsp; It&#039;s unavoidable and, unfortunately, people have to pay in the down cycles.&nbsp; But, you can&#039;t stop it.&nbsp; It&#039;s a fact of life.&nbsp;

				No problem, Daisy.&nbsp; While investing can be very volatile in the short term, it has been an absolute boon for the long term.&nbsp; The earlier you start in life, the better you are...EXPONENTIALLY.&nbsp; If you kept all returns the same (ie, 8% per year every year), you&#039;d have more money when you retire at 65 if you were investing for 10 years between age 25-35 than you would investing the same amount of money each year between 35-65.&nbsp; So, if you invested 2k per year, you would invest 20k total between 25 and 35 and, when you&#039;re 65, have more money than if you invested 2k per year between 35-65, which would be 60k total invested.&nbsp; Time and, through time, compounding interested (look that up if you don&#039;t know what it is) will provide you with MUCH more more money.<br /><br />Another example: I have a guy that I talk stocks with that invested $300 (in 1967 dollars, so factor in inflation) in what&#039;s called a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (look that one up, too) with General Mills (the cereal company) in 1967.&nbsp; General Mills isn&#039;t a big growth stock, but just the time and dividend reinvestments over a 40 year period turned his $300 (again, in 1967 dollars)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;into $160,000 today.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now, growth in the stock market was pretty enormous over that time and it MIGHT not be quite so large over the next 40 years, but still...shows how worth it even simple investing can be.<br /><br />Good luck with your research and post up any more questions that you may have.&nbsp;

				I helps not to start investing at the beginning of a bubble, though. At the beginning of grad school, I put $1000 into a SR mutual fund, and then started putting in a small amount every month (dollar-cost averaging). That $1000 was cut in half by the collapse of the .com bubble, and the markets have been basically flat since then, unless you invest in oil companies and defense contractors (which my SR fund doesn&#039;t). So I have earned about negative 2% on my investments over the past 8 years! In retrospect, I would have been better off putting that money in a savings account, or in gold ($1000/oz!), but of course there was no way of knowing that then... Good thing I won&#039;t need it for a long, long time...

				I lost my first foray into retirement account investment in 2000 as well.&nbsp; Put about $5k I had saved up for awhile into an IRA account right around the highs in 2000.&nbsp; Then, at one point, I lost up to 60% of my initial investment.&nbsp; It came back to being down about 40% when I finally closed it out 5 years later.&nbsp; <br /><br />From that point, I vowed to not let anyone else control my future investments.&nbsp; I also realized how to look at the market overall and stay way from bubbles; kinda like we saw at the end of last year.

				I think I&#039;ll just sell some of my gold jewelry at the (hopefully) pawn shop going up on 31st Street Ditmars. When I bought the stuff while I was working in the jewelry industry just a few years ago gold was $260 an ounce! Laughably cheap!<br /><br />Hurry up guys and build it! Gold hit $1,000 an ounce! :-P

				<br /><br />http://money.cnn.com/2008/06/04/news/newsmakers/buffett_bet.fortune/index.htm<br /><br />I just tripped across this article, and it seems full of interesting items. From market predictions to charity bets.<br /><br /><br /><br />(Fortune Magazine) -- Will a collection of hedge funds, carefully selected by experts, return more to investors over the next 10 years than the S&amp;P 500?<br /><br />That question is now the subject of a bet between Warren Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, and Protégé Partners LLC, a New York City money management firm that runs funds of hedge funds <br />&lt;&gt;<br />We&#039;re way past theory here. This bet, being reported for the first time in this article (whose author is both a longtime friend of Buffett&#039;s and editor of his chairman&#039;s letter in the Berkshire annual report), has been in existence since Jan. 1 of this year.<br /><br />It&#039;s between Buffett (not Berkshire) and Protégé (the firm, not its funds). And there&#039;s serious money at stake. Each side put up roughly $320,000. The total funds of about $640,000 were used to buy a zero-coupon Treasury bond that will be worth $1 million at the bet&#039;s conclusion.<br /><br />That $1 million will then go to charity. If Protégé wins, it has asked that the money be given to Absolute Return for Kids (ARK), an international philanthropy based in London. If Buffett wins, the intended recipient is Girls Inc. of Omaha, whose board includes his daughter, Susan Buffett.<br />&lt;&gt;<br />To see today&#039;s Long Bets listings, go to http://www.longbets.org/. <br />Some bets catalogued there sound as though they were made in sports bars: Actor Ted Danson garnered $2,000 for a charity when the Red Sox won the World Series before a U.S. men&#039;s soccer team won the World Cup. <br /><br />On a more cosmic front, Lotus founder Mitchell Kapor and inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil have a $20,000 bet on the proposition that &quot;by 2029 no computer - or &#039;machine intelligence&#039; - will have passed the Turing Test,&quot; meaning that a computer won&#039;t have successfully impersonated a human. Kapor made that prediction; Kurzweil disagrees with it. Each man, following the rules of Long Bets, has supported his point of view with a brief statement that is posted on the Web site. Buffett&#039;s and Protégé&#039;s arguments will appear there as well (and are listed here).<br /><br />&lt;&gt;<br />All that&#039;s history, of course, so let&#039;s get back to the bet: Buffett and Seides agreed that they&#039;d periodically disclose where the wager stood. Seides wanted this disclosure to take place whenever the market fell by 10%, because he believes that one of the virtues of hedge funds is their ability to weather tough times. Indeed, in the first quarter of this year, during a down market, Protégé Partners LP fell by only 1.9%, while the Vanguard fund dropped 9.5%.<br /><br />&lt;&gt;<br />Buffett himself assesses his chances of winning at only 60%, which he grants is less of an edge than he usually likes to have.<br /><br />Protégé figures its own probabilities of winning at a heady 85%. Some people will say, of course, that just by making this bet, Protégé has acquired some priceless publicity.<br /><br />&lt;&gt;<br />
