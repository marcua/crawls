			<br /><br /><br />Nice closing note and words.&nbsp; I get it.&nbsp; It makes sense, and yeah, nice to close things off before all the spammers and bots take over.&nbsp; Indeed, I&#039;d actually &#039;forgotten&#039; all about this site.&nbsp; It&#039;s been a long time since I used it.&nbsp; Local conversations seemed to turn to local FB pages and Nextdoor.com, from what I&#039;ve seen.<br /><br /><br />I remember using Astorians.com to learn about all the great new places to eat in Astoria, but at a certain point it became moot, since the great food options here are now endless.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Thank you for all the great work in maintaining this site!<br /><br /><br />Godspeed to one and all!&nbsp; ;-)<br /><br /><br /><br />

			This is an irreplaceable record of a decade in the community&#039;s life and should not disappear. Reach out to the Astoria Historical for<br />assistance to keep this photo of our community in a permanent archive after it&#039;s taken down. <br /><br /><br />info@astorialic.org<br /><br /><br />and thank you.

			I appreciate all of the work that went into site maintenance.&nbsp; THANK YOU.<br />And I loved so many posts here throughout the years.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I first started visiting this site, the internet was a saner place.&nbsp; Arguments were like discussions.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Maybe the most important part of this site&#039;s history to me is that it was a great place to post about missing/found pets.&nbsp; We found a dog about ten years ago and I posted info and pictures here.&nbsp; After three days, the owner finally called and it turned out she lived just a few houses down our block.

			Sorry to see you go. I felt a sense of community here even though I never made it out of tourist status. I perused for all sorts of things when I moved into the neighborhood in 2007, dry cleaners, nail salons, etcâ€¦I posted during Hurricane Sunday needing help for those in the rockaways. I wish you all, all the best.
