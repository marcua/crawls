				In case you didn&#039;t know already, Obama and Huckabee won last night in Iowa.&nbsp; The first couple of paragraphs from the CNN website appear below.<br /><br /><br />http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/01/04/iowa.analysis/index.html<br /><br />CNN - Mike Huckabee needed incredible turnout from self-described evangelical voters Thursday to win Iowa. Hillary Clinton was counting on capturing the women&#039;s vote to carry the day.<br /><br />Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee scored well with evangelical voters. <br /><br />Huckabee succeeded, while Clinton did not.<br /><br />So goes the tale of two very different presidential campaigns that appear to be on separate arcs: Huckabee up, Clinton down.<br /><br />Two new front-runners for the 2008 race for the White House have emerged. For Republicans, it is Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor. For Democrats, it is Sen. Barack Obama. <br /><br />With 95 percent of Republican precincts reporting, Huckabee, former governor of Arkansas, had the support of 34 percent of voters, compared to 25 percent for Romney. Fred Thompson had 13 percent, McCain had 13 percent and Ron Paul had 10 percent.<br /><br />With all Democratic precincts reporting, Obama had the support of 38 percent of voters, compared to 30 percent for John Edwards and 29 percent for Hillary Clinton.<br /><br />

				Alot of Democrats have a grudge against Edwards though becuase they do not feel he campaigned hard enough for Kerry once he was chosen as VP candidate. I am thrilled, though about Obama, but also kind of happy that McCain showed pretty well considering he has been focusing so much on NH. If the election came down to Obama v McCain, I wouldn&#039;t want to play first-person frogger on the BQE if Barack lost like i did with the last election.

				I adore Obama. I didn&#039;t think he&#039;d have the potential to get the nomination, but I think he can whallop Huckabee.<br /><br />This has been going through my head all morning:<br /><br /><em>I see a White House and I want to paint it black<br />No Clinton anymore I want it to turn black.<br />I see that girl walk by dressed in her war hawk clothes,<br />I have to turn my head until we elect a bro&#039;.<br /><br />I see some Neocons and they&#039;re all painted black<br />With this election landsliding ne&#039;er to turn back.<br />I see people turn their heads and quickly look away<br />Ron Paulies will all cry that &quot;It was rigged this way!!!!&quot;<br /><br />I look inside myself and I&#039;ll be voting black.<br />I see my voter card and it&#039;s been painted black.<br />Maybe then I&#039;ll fade away and the world will face the facts:<br />Once the White House goes black, it will never go back!<br /><br />From sea to shining sea this is the land of the free.<br />Which is why no one will vote for Rudolph Giu-li-a-ni.<br />If I look hard enough into our Congress too.<br />Some changes to our government are way overdue!</em>

				I was leaning towards Obama before the caucus simply because he was a new voice and not part of the old guard.&nbsp; This morning while watching his speech for last night I was impressed with his style, empowering words and sense of unity.&nbsp; The way he talks of the citizens of the USA working together as one country for change. He said something about 9/11 not being used as a scare tactic but a challenge to face our real foes.&nbsp; That really got me.<br /><br />I was left elated and a bit emotional.&nbsp; He has my support.&nbsp; Obama is intelligent, forward thinking and reasonable.&nbsp; Bill Richardson would be my pick for VP.&nbsp; Lots of worldly government experience, Bipartisan respect, And good for the southern and Spanish votes.&nbsp; <br /><br />Best of luck to all in the upcoming elections.

				<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqoFwZUp5vc<br />&nbsp; Obama&#039;s Victory Speech <br /><br />I am struck by how strong the turnout was. More came out from across the spectrum. Rep/Ind/ DEM<br />There, many boomers liked Clinton, but younger folks had a stronger preference for Obama.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see how the candidates do in large states like FL, NY, CA.<br /><br />If you have an interest, it is nice to see the celebration speech from Iowa. Even just briefly.<br /><br /><br /><br />I dont think many candidates will thrill me for 4 years, but I would be curious to see how an Obama administration governs.<br /><br />&quot;Too many took the President at his word instead of reading the intelligence for themselves. Congress gave the President the authority to go to war. Our only opportunity to stop the war was lost.<br />I made a different judgment. I thought our priority had to be finishing the fight in Afghanistan. I spoke out against what I called &quot;a rash war&#039; in Iraq.&quot;<br /><br />Now to see if NH concurs and how the candidates handle the increased spotlight and intensity.<br />Do well People.

				I&#039;m gonna stick my neck way out...how about Obama-Lieberman. :-o<br />I know Lieberman is an independent and endorses McCain, but if McCain and Hillary fall by the wayside and Obama is nominated...<br />Lieberman was reputedly Obama&#039;s mentor when he was elected to the Senate in &#039;05,<br />Obama endorsed Lieberman in &#039;06 when he ran against Lamont in Ct.<br />They both have quite a strong following and Lieberman still has some ties to his old party.<br />

				Hm... My first inclination is that Lieberman is such a pariah with the Democratic Party leadership, there&#039;s no way he could be Obama&#039;s running mate. But I didn&#039;t know Obama endorsed Joltin Joe (;)) during his end-run reelection.<br /><br />Interesting....

				I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if McCain was to win the nomination and he selects Lieberman as his running mate. Regarding last night, I think Obama&#039;s victory can begin a major change to the American political landscape, but nothing is certain until Tuesday&#039;s New Hampshire Primary which Obama must win in order to stay on top. Personally I&#039;m still leaning toward Hillary (not because I love her stances, but I think if Hillary is the nominee it will bring out more Democrats in New York State and it will help the Democrats take over the State Senate in November). If Obama wins NH on Tuesday, and the South Carolina primary later in the month, the race for the Democratic nomination will be blown wide open. While Obama gets the momentum from last nights victory, Hillary still remains the national frontrunner, so a lot will be at stake at Tuesday&#039;s primary.

				Nah, McCain probably won&#039;t get nominated because of his soft stance on illegal immigration-among other issues, that make him look more like a liberal democrat. Read below:<br />http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MTg4OTM5NzNhY2E1MmM1MGRlOGNkYTViYWI1ZDAyNmU=<br /><br />And he seems a little scary.
