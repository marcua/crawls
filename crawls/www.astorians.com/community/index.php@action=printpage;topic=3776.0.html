				Hi. One of my clients is a retired professor and he has a huge book collection (over 4000 books) that he needs to donate to clear space in his house (it&#39;s really cluttered right now). His collection includes books on Art, History, Music, Archeology, Anthropology, and much more. I would be happy to connect my client anyone that is interested in browsing and taking some of his collection...<br />I would also love to help him make a library donation - any high school librarians interested? <br /><br />any and all interested parties, please PM me.<br /><br /><br />Thanks!

				mirki, did this professor teach in the New York area - is it an option for him to donate the library there, or to his alma mater?&nbsp; I was also wondering whether it&#39;s better to keep the library together, or break it up - depending on the coherence of the collection.&nbsp; Can you give more specifics?<br /><br />I&#39;ve also seen previous instances in which retired professors have set up a website listing the titles available, and circulated the info to academic listservs and departments.&nbsp; 4000 books is a lot of books!

				Thanks MCW for the tip. I&#39;m not sure how computer savvy he is because he&#39;s been retired for some quite some years already but I can certainly try and work with him to create a log of his books and put them up on the internet.

				Although I think it is a great idea to try to donate the whole kit and kaboodle to a universtiy/school/public library, I have to admit I would love to grab a few of those books for my own collection.<br /><br />I love books in general, but going thru a retired professor&#39;s stash would be a real treat. Please keep me posted if there is a &quot;browse and keep&quot; day.&nbsp; I would be so excited!

Especially (being a student and lover of the arts) the Art books. There are some that I desperately want, but they&#39;re out of print, so I keep my eye open at used bookstores and whatnot.<br /><br />Have you thought of helping him organize a used book sale maybe? Or maybe contacting a used bookstore, provided they&#39;re in resaleable condition? I know he doesn&#39;t seem to want to sell them, but it might be an option, and then if he wants, he can donate that money to chairty or something.

				Consider contacting The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts (http://www.nypl.org/research/lpa/lpa.html) for the music collection and the Humanities and Social Sciences Library (http://www.nypl.org/research/chss/index.html) for the anthropology, archaeology, history, et al. I believe that the research libraries do accept collections.

				Just to update, I made an appointment next week with my client to catalog&nbsp; his collections after hours and to discuss what collections he wants to get rid of to clear space. Once that portion of this project is complete,&nbsp; I&#39;ll post a list of what&#39;s available and I&#39;m also thinking, if there is interest, in organizing a sidewalk booksale at his house (located in lower astoria)....<br /><br />so feel free to continue sharing thoughts and ideas :)<br /><br />thanks

				Mirki, on your end, would it be more convenient to schedule a specific day for Astorians to come and look at the books?&nbsp; If so, I&#39;d be interested - I guess I just felt kind of weird about making a one on one appointment with someone I don&#39;t know.&nbsp; And if you need anyone to look through the art history books and organize, I&#39;d be glad to help.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)&nbsp;
