				Has anyone checked out this new restaurant? It is down on 20th Ave and Steinway. My husband and I have been meaning to check it out but I always slips my mind until I pass it on the way to Best Yet. It looks a bit &quot;fancy&quot; from the outside but I havent heard anything about prices....

				Nice review...and I guess we will have to wait for a special night to go there. It is def too fancy for us to drop in after work. Maybe someone who is well versed in Astoria&#039;s Greek cuisine will go and tell us how it stacks up to the neighborhood mainstays?

				chill dude - this is a friendly forum!<br />I researched for you, the chef is &quot;Christos Chistou&quot; who has worked in many of the Greek Upscale restaurants in Manhattan like Trata.<br />They have all the classic staples of a Greek restaurant, therefore too many to mention since I have tried most of the menu by now and liked everything I ate. (&amp; being Greek myself I know Greek food)<br />If it helps you, my favorite appetizer is the Zuccini balls &amp; my favorite main is the seafood pasta.<br />They often have daily specials as well.<br />Why don&#039;t you go yourself and write a professional review for the rest of us amateur writers!<br />Speaking of write-ups, they have gotten quite a few good ones recently.<br />To anticipate your asking in which papers, sorry, as an amateur I don&#039;t remember, but if you go eat there, you will see them displayed!

				Thanks, Artie G for the recommendation!<br />If this place treats its customers as well as you say (not rude and condescending), the food is outstanding (not soggy, greasy and overcooked), the price is reasonable, and the restaurant clean (doesn&#039;t stink like dead fish) I&#039;ll definitely check it out.

				Aegean Cove is an excellent restaurant! Why all the questions about it?? If u pass by, stop one min check out the prices on the menu outside...and as for the rest of u go on the website and check out the prices..things are easier than we make them out to be...unless u all just want conversation bc ur bored!!&nbsp; The food is very good! Not heavy and definitely not greasy!! the truth is astoria has a lot of restaurants but very few Greek fine dining restaurants that don&#039;t break the bank!!! If i go out for grk food it would def be there!!! as for dress code if u feel underdressed u can always sit in the front dining area or at the bar...but honestly i don&#039;t believe its much of an issue....some recommendations would be the octopus, fried zucchini, crab cake, liver as for main courses i love the stuffed peppers or salmon etc.... I think that what will def. make this restaurant a hit is the outdoor patio which i wish was open already but they still need some time...hopefully in the next 2 to 3 weeks....

				I visited the place bfeore they opened and met one of the owners he was very helpful and refered me to the chef &quot;Christou&quot; (He was at Ahthens Live 36th Ave for a short while). I have heard many great thing about him and think he is a nice straight forward guy.<br />As for eating their, just hasn&#039;t happened. I do look forward to going their very soon and comparing it to Louk... (can&#039;t remember how to spell). The place does indeed look really nice and welcoming. Very tastfully decorated and not cheesy. Certainly won&#039;t go in flip flops and shorts. <br />

				Finally tried AC. The owner was welcoming. The bar is well stocked and the dining area is warm and comfortable (they also have a fire place). There was a live songstress (this was TH night about 9 pm). My companion disliked her but I didn&#039;t mind; if I loved Greek standands I probably would have been happy as were the majority of Greek diners in the room.<br /><br />Our food was delicious because it was well-seasoned, neither under- nor overcooked and packed with all the flavor you&#039;d expect from this cuisine.<br /><br />I had:<br />Creamy hummus with fresh hot pita on the table (came free as starter)<br />Grilled halloumi with chopped tomatoes, red onion and cucumber; drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic; outstanding flavor of cheese, vegetables and herbs without any one overpowering.<br />Masterful bifteki - two generous patties mixed with plenty of herbs and cheese, served with not-greasy lemon potatoes and garlic- and dill-loaded tzaziki<br />(What had to be) Fage Total yogurt with walnuts, honey and cherries as the house dessert; full fat, creamy and delish.<br /><br />I sampled my friend&#039;s Makaroni - just-tender linguine with rich ground beef and tomato sauce; we thought we tasted a hint of nutmeg - that&#039;s what I will have for my own next time!<br /><br />They had a decent international wine list. After dinner, I tried Greek port for the first time and loved it (ruby not tawny, served cold).<br /><br />My only complant was that our waiter was very attentive to the large table ordering many bottles of wine and we had to flag down another waiter for after-dinner drinks, dessert and the check. The other servers seemed much better at keeping up with all their tables, but our guy&#039;s defense, you will never feel rushed through a meal here - our server even asked us if we wanted our entrees right after appetizers or if we preferred to wait.<br /><br />I will definitely visit again.<br />

				Hey, there *are* viral marketing schemes, so healthy skepticism is okay in my book. If I went running for every time I came to this board for a restaurant review, I&#039;d be in great shape!! Maybe I&#039;ll just run by places instead :lol: (not a bad idea actually.....)<br /><br />A couple years ago, seemed like every place I went I was being told what a great place the Water Taxi Beach was to hang out at.

				I got to try AC for lunch yesterday for a work luncheon.&nbsp; I was pleased b/c I live only a few blocks away and have been interested in trying out the place but just never actually made it.&nbsp; It always looked nice from the outside, but it is certainly in a horrible location.&nbsp; I can not imagine how they will stay in business in that spot. <br />But the food was outstanding.&nbsp; We had a price fix deal because there was 16 of us, but everything that came out was of the highest quality.&nbsp; I would definately put the food on par with the better Greek places in the &#039;hood.&nbsp; ie: Agnanti&#039;s, kylcledes (sp?), and Elias&#039;s corner.&nbsp; But I think the decore is better than all three.&nbsp; It really seems like an upscale place.&nbsp; So at least it feels like their pricing warrants the extra cost over the aformentioned places.<br />I only had mezze&#039;s so I can&#039;t wait to go back.&nbsp; The food was in fact quite tasty.&nbsp; But I still think they will have trouble b/c of the location.

				I ended up at Aegean Cove last night (should have stuck to my instincts and tried Philoxenia) and it was a truly unappetizing and bizarre experience. The server was trying way too hard (madame, sir, presenting the menu with some weird &quot;zoro-esque&quot; bow), but did not appear familiar with the menu at all. The first couple dishes were tasty, in particular a good Greek salad and great beets.<br /><br />But then a dish appeared that we didn&#039;t order, so it was taken away. Then another dish appeared that was the wrong order, it took the 5 minutes to get the server to tell him (we were 1 of 3 tables in the place), then it took him 5 minutes to work it out with the manager. Finally they returned and said that we could keep this shrimp entree (it was supposed to be an app) and that they would only charge us the app price. Problem was, after passing the plate around for 10 minutes and bringing it to the kitchen the food was now cold, only worsening the overcooked shrimp.<br /><br />Finally, when the grilled fish came out it tasted incredibly fishy and was gray. When we mentioned this to the manager he said it was supposed to smell like that, and that anyway &quot;that fish is meant to be fried&quot;. A) it was definitely not fresh B) if the fish is meant to be fried why offer it grilled on the menu?<br /><br />Overall experience was not good at all. The people that worked there hovered around the table making us all feel very uncomfortable. And another weird thing, I waited at least 5 minutes for the bathroom. Finally, it was the male manager that exited the woman&#039;s bathroom and then when he saw me ran back in to &quot;make sure he flushed&quot;. I can&#039;t really recommend this place to anyone. Truly bizarre.
