				Hello Astorians! <br /><br />I am looking to move to Astoria eventually and am looking for some advice or information from someone who lives there or knows the area. I graduated from a master&#039;s program in May and started my first job in Manhattan. I am currently living at home in the suburbs with my parents, commuting almost 2 hours each way to get my feet on the ground and pay off some of my student loans&nbsp; :lipsrsealed: . I am hoping to stick it out for a while longer to save up some money, but am obviously looking to move in closer eventually. At this point, I am pretty certain that when I do move it will be to Astoria, as it&#039;s nice and close to my job in Manhattan but a lot more affordable.&nbsp; Currently, I am sending almost my entire paycheck directly to Sallie Mae (ouch), but I am mapping out a budget for the next few months to make sure that I am holding on to enough that I can move out when the time comes (probably July or August).<br /><br />I am looking to save money, so will probably be looking at either a studio or 2BR with a roommate. Can anyone give me some information on what is typically required? How much will I need to have saved up just to get myself into an apartment? What type of information are landlords typically looking for (e.g., pay stubs, bank statements)? Just looking for a general idea so that I don&#039;t end up sending all of my money to my loan lender and stuck with my parents for a few extra months. Thank you! <br />&nbsp;

				In general, I believe you need 4 months rent saved up.<br />&nbsp;<br />First<br />Last<br />1 month as security deposit<br />1 month as broker fee<br />&nbsp;<br />You&#039;ll want to have at least another month in the bank beyond that for emergencies.

				You should have more than that unless you know for sure your parents will back you up in case of an emergency .&nbsp; &nbsp;Someone can lose their job and not have success right away finding something new . When rent and bills are due thats when your real troubles begin .&nbsp; I would always have 6 months rent available just in case . It might sound like alot but you dont need your credit getting hurt if something like that happens and you cant pay .&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />1 month security deposit <br />1 month rent <br />If you are gonna pay a broker have money available for that <br />min 6 months rent and extra emergency money avail on hand .<br />Also dont forget besides rent , bills ,&nbsp; food , and im sure you might want to buy something like furniture for your new apt . So&nbsp; additional money is needed for that and more . <br />&nbsp;<br />I see so many people going looking for apts with barely anything in the bank and they wonder why they cant lock down the apt when they go see it .&nbsp; I had a woman yesterday come in looking at an apt i had with the security and first month and not a dime more in the bank .Her job was new and she was on probation .&nbsp; &nbsp; A month ago someone tried to scam me by renting an apt with ZERO money in their account . And i mean Zero . They wanted to get in and live for free im sure .&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Im not saying you would do this&nbsp; but you have to see how landlords look at things since they happen all the time .

				This is exactly the type of info I&#039;m looking for. It seems like I&#039;ll need 4 months plus emergency cash. Thank you!
