				Since I work in downtown Manhattan, 9:30 to 5:30, I never get back to Astoria before 6:40 or later. &nbsp;Just speaking for myself, I would like to have classes that start at 7:00 during the week.

				I sent an email to the &quot;info&quot; address a few weeks ago and never received a reply.<br /><br />Responding to emails might help open up a dialogue. &nbsp; :)

				It's taken me a while to finally get to the pilates place but I made it -- and it's pretty cool. &nbsp;I took a session with Mary and have nothing but good things to say.<br /><br />Having increased running miles lately, my muscles have been a little unpleasantly tight lately -- the cure to this seems to have been an hour or so with the reformer. &nbsp;Scary name but pleasantly relaxing in the end. &nbsp;It was my first pilates experience -- but it seems a little bit like yoga that's more concentrated on specific muscles. &nbsp;Yoga with resistance.<br /><br />Anyhow, if you haven't checked it out yet, you should. &nbsp;It's lovely. &nbsp;Prices and class offerings vary. &nbsp;The Thursday evening yoga class is also highly recommended.<br /><br />cheers,<br />jayme
