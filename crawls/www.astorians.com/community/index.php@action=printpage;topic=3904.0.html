				My studio is closing in the new year and I&#39;m looking to rent a spot in a new one.&nbsp; I prefer a space that already has a kiln that I would have access to.&nbsp; I prefer something in Astoria/ LIC area.&nbsp; Anyone know of anything?

				This may not be helpful at all, but there&#39;s a sign on 31st St. just south of 24th Ave. that seems to be an art studio with a ceramics shop.&nbsp; I don&#39;t really know much about it, though.

				There is something in Brooklyn near the Brooklyn Queens border. I can&#39;t remember the name of it but it&#39;s an artist space where you buy a membership and you can use the all the equiptment they have. I&#39;d say go to P.S. 1 and ask around there.<br />

				I know that there were some people in Astoria who were going to try to create a space, but not sure if this fell through or not. I also know that there are people who have their own private kiln and wheel, but I don&#39;t know them personally. Maybe you could find something that way. Man I miss doing pottery - I just don&#39;t have the time or money for it anymore.

				Ohhh I am totally tempted. Not sure if I can do it, but thank you so much for passing this link along! I was taking a pottery class a couple of years ago Sat. mornings in Chinatown - would love to go to a class that&#39;s closer and this sounds like a good solution. Thank you!!!

				BTW Belle - Do you know if pieces made are included in the cost of the class? The class I took in Chinatown did include all pieces made, but I know other places require you to buy your pieces apart from the cost of the class. I looked on the website but didn&#39;t see any of that sort of information there...
