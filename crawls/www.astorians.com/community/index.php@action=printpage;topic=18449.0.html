				Hi guys,<br />Just bought a suit that needs alteration/fitting...some sleeve and shoulder work (which I think would be more complicated).&nbsp; Anyway did a search here and read good things on Jack at GVD Cleaners and San Remo&#039;s.&nbsp; Since the suit needs some shoulder work too, where should I go between the two?&nbsp; Is there another place you guys recommend?<br /><br />Thanks

				I recommend Elena and her Tailor shop (31st Ave and just around the corner on 36th Street [towards 30th Ave.]).&nbsp; She has done my last 4 alterations including my wedding dress.&nbsp; Her prices are reasonable and she does amazing work.&nbsp; She was the in-house tailor for Bloomingdales for over 20 years.

				Elena said she couldn&#039;t do my wedding dress, although it was very simple- no beading or precious material&nbsp; :? But another tailor around here also rejected it- not sure why.<br /><br />Based on all the recommendations, she&#039;s doing SOMEthing right, so I&#039;ll have to give her another shot. We have some suits that need work.<br /><br />If all else fails, Tony the Tailor in Manhasset didn&#039;t bat an eye when I brought in the dress, and was also resonable given the pricy area.

				We&#039;ve been using Jack, who is now at GVD Cleaners at the corner of 23rd Ave. and 32nd St., for many years.&nbsp; He used to be at Ferrari Cleaners on Ditmars, and was then at the tux place before moving to GVD.&nbsp; We&#039;ve also recommended him to friends who have been very pleased with his work.&nbsp; He has done extensive alterations on good-quality suits, including sleeve and shoulder re-setting, that have been very well done.&nbsp; 718-274-1701 or 646-623-2633

				It was the dry cleaners on the corner of Ditmars and.....24th St.? Right around there. Great dry cleaners, fine for basic stuff like hemming, but they just refused the dress, claiming the armholes were a problem somehow. <br /><br />Elena said that her place was too small to deal with my dress; she&#039;d need more room to work on it. The dress was form-fitting, not big and poofy, so I still don&#039;t quite get why she&#039;d say that! <br /><br />I was starting to freak out at that point, and called the place I bought it from. They said, &quot;All wedding dresses are designed to be custom-fitted,&quot; so they were at a loss to explain the difficulty I was having. (Would&#039;ve had it done at the store, but they overcharge for alterations.)<br /><br />&quot;Tony&quot; the Tailor (actually the son of Tony) was baffled by all this. Really didn&#039;t see a problem at all.<br /><br />

				Hmm...that&#039;s so odd, Christine.&nbsp; Was this more recently, i.e. nearing wedding season?&nbsp; Maybe she just didn&#039;t feel like working one something that&#039;s bigger/a little more complicated than regular dresses.&nbsp; I brought her mine at the beginning of February and she admitted it was her slow season.&nbsp; My dress was also pretty simple and all she needed to do with it was adjust the straps and put in a bustle.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, sorry you had two places turn down altering your dress.&nbsp; How frustrating.

				Thank you all for the response.&nbsp; I will check out the places you all recommended.&nbsp; So Elena works on Men&#039;s suits as well?

				Thanks! No big deal really, just odd. Maybe my story might help other women not freak out if it happens to them.<br /><br />If it were the height of the season, they could&#039;ve said so!&nbsp; :-P
