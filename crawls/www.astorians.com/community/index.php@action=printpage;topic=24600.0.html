				&nbsp; &nbsp;I just signed the lease on a great 2 bedroom apartment on Broadway and I&#039;m seeking a roommate for the 2nd bedroom to start on April 27th. The apartment has a large living room, eat-in kitchen (no dishwasher), and a nice bathroom with shower/tub. The bedroom fits a full bed (may be able to fit a queen) and a dresser comfortably- has its own closet.<br />I have 1 cat, so please make sure you are not allergic and that you like cats. He is very friendly and well-behaved with a big personality. No other pets are allowed in the apartment as per the lease agreement.<br />The rent per person is $1150/month (cash only as per the lease agreement) plus utilities and internet/cable. This is a month to month lease, but I&#039;d like someone to sign on for at least 6 months.We will sign a notarized agreement on our own.<br />I am seeking a roommate who is very clean, responsible, quiet during the week (I work 9-6 in the city and I&#039;m exhausted when I come home) but also someone to possibly hang out/have fun with on the weekends. I don&#039;t mind the occasional party, but it needs to be planned beforehand. The same thing goes with guests. I&#039;m a what&#039;s mine is mine, what&#039;s yours is yours type of person- I will never take anything that isn&#039;t mind without asking first and I expect the same from roommates.<br />Please let me know if you&#039;re interested and we can discuss. Thanks!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;
