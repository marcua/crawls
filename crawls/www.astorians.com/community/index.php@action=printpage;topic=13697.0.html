				Please join me in my fight to make a difference in the lives of the more than 1 million Americans living with autism today.<br /><br />I am participating in Walk Now for Autism to help find a cure for autism. Autism is the second most common developmental disorder in the United States affecting one in every 150 children born today and within that, 1 in 94 are BOYS...those numbers scare me to death!<br /><br />Despite some promising discoveries, the cause of autism is unknown and a cure does not exist. Research is crucial. Every 20 minutes another child is diagnosed with autism. Not only must we find ways to improve the quality of life for children and adults with autism, but we also must find a cure, and soon. <br /><br />Walk Now for Autism is our chance to make a difference in the fight against autism by raising money for autism research and heightening public awareness. Please join me in my fight as I raise money to help fund essential research. You can donate to Walk Now for Autism and/or join my team online using the links at the bottom of this page. Donations can also be mailed to Autism Speaks using the donation form located on my page or send me a check made out to Autism Speaks. My team hopes to raise $2,500 and any amount that you are able to donate would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Thank you for taking an important step in the fight against autism.<br /><br />Donations are tax deductible to the fullest extent allowed by law. <br />Autism Speaks 501 (C)(3) Tax Id #: 20-2329938<br /><br />Matching gift program: Many companies provide their employees with matching gifts. If your company would like to make a matching donation, or become one of our Corporate Sponsors...please have them visit our Donation page or email me directly at katherinempapa@gmail.com<br /><br />http://www.walknowforautism.org/nyc/astoriamoms<br /><br />
