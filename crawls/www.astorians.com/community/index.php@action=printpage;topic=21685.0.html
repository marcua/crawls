				It looks as though a 7-11 will be taking over the old beach bum tanning on 31st street right off of Ditmars.<br /><br />http://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/JobsQueryByNumberServlet?requestid=2&amp;passjobnumber=420462724&amp;passdocnumber=01 (http://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/JobsQueryByNumberServlet?requestid=2&amp;passjobnumber=420462724&amp;passdocnumber=01)

				Seems like an odd space, but it will be good to have one less vacancy.&nbsp; <br />

				I&#039;ve noticed the beginnings of some construction going on there, but couldn&#039;t tell what it was. They might do well, especially if they&#039;re open 24 hours. Nothing like that is open on that block overnight so it might be good.

				Not sure about nothing like that being open.&nbsp; CVS and the little veggie stands both sell soda and chips.&nbsp; Dunkin Donuts around the corner sells coffee.&nbsp; What is unique about 7-11 (besides the slurpies which my daughter is going to go nuts for)?

				Sometimes there&#039;s something nice about a reliable, clean, predicatable, good old American franchise.&nbsp; And sometimes there&#039;s not.&nbsp; &nbsp;But I think this is a good thing for the Ditmars area.&nbsp; I think the one on 30th does very well.&nbsp;

				The organic vegetable store that&#039;s next to it closes around 2 a.m. For anyone who does need anything on their way home from the train - milk, coffee, etc. - a 7-11 may come in handy. And yes, it is clean. I&#039;d rather go in there for milk than some other places, especially in the overnight hours. Plus it&#039;s just good to see a business move into a long-empty space and <br />provide some jobs. That&#039;s always a good thing.

				Someone going in to a 7-11 at 2:30 am is hardly looking for &#039;organic&#039; veggies and fruits. I&#039;m thinking more along the lines of organic munchie food like twinkies and ho-ho&#039;s.

				I know that a lot of people like the way you pour and prepare your own coffee.&nbsp; The store is usually well lit, clean, and well organized.&nbsp; It has a consistent variety of basics.&nbsp; A pretty good newspaper and magazine selection.&nbsp; And it&#039;s very popular for late night beer runs.&nbsp; You always know what to expect in 7-11.&nbsp; And the pricing is fair.&nbsp; It&#039;s nothing special.&nbsp; But I think people trust the store and feel comfortable buying whatever they buy there.
