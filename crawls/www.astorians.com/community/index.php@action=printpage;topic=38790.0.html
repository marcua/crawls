				<span style="font-family: Bitstream Vera Serif;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: medium;" class="bbc_size">Sadly, our roommate is leaving us therefore we have a room available in our beautiful/spacious 3-bedroom apartment in Astoria, beginning around Sept 5th.</span></span><span style="font-family: Bitstream Vera Serif;" class="bbc_font">[/size]<span style="font-size: medium;" class="bbc_size">The room is 14&#039; x 9&#039;. Rent is $800/mo plus utilities/internet which is about $60/mo. Extra if you&#039;d like cable. We prefer someone to stay long term and must have proof of income and good credit.As you can see from the pictures, the apartment is very spacious and we get a lot of great natural light! Large living room, large dining area, and large kitchen with its own bar table with stools. Great home if you like to invite company over. We&#039;ve just moved in so we don&#039;t have too much so maybe you have some cool ideas to help us decorate.We live on the first floor and share the building with another apartment upstairs. It&#039;s a gated building and we have roof top access which has a nice view of the Manhattan skyline!Its a short walk to the subway and there is a grocery store and laundromat on the corner.You will be sharing the apartment with 2 other roommates.Myself, I am in my mid-twenties from Portland, OR. Working as an engineer. The other roommate, she&#039;s from California and working in finance.We&#039;re both really chill, nice, love to hang out, and eat! We&#039;d like to keep that same vibe going. . .If you&#039;re interested in our super cool apartment and becoming our new roommate, tell us about yourself. LinkedIn or facebook would be helpful as well!Thanks!<br /><br /><br />Hers&#039; the craigslist link -- http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/roo/5189030830.html</span></span>[/color]
