				Best show on television.&nbsp; I happen to think the Brits made a better show than the Yanks, but I&#039;ve met alot who feel just as strongly the other way.<br /><br />(I wonder if francophones have the same discussions between the French <em>Le Bureau</em> and the Quebecian <em>La Job</em>)

				I&#039;ve recently watched a couple episodes of the British version and their &quot;Michael&quot; (not sure of the Brit&#039;s boss&#039; name) is not nearly as funny I think.&nbsp; The British boss is just sad, everyone hates him.&nbsp; Jim, in the American version, seems to get a kick out of Michael.&nbsp; I know the staff are not Michael&#039;s biggest fan, but they do seem to enjoy his antics sometimes. Eh, just my 2 cents y&#039;all. Thanks for stopping by.&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				Ricky Gervais is way, way funnier than Steve Carrell IMO. Although the two characters are totally different from one another, comparing them is kind of useless. Ricky Gervais is a genius and his comedy is hard to understand for many Americans, I think. The British Office is altogether far more subtle than the American version and I think the jokes are more complex. The British Office is funnier, although the American Office has vastly improved lately. The first episode of the newest season was unbelievably funny.

				I love The Office- though I have to say I am not loving this season. So far the only episode that really made me laugh was when Michael Scott yelled &quot; I declare bankruptcy&quot; across the office. Other than that I have giggled a bit, but not laughed like I have in the past. My favorite episode ever was when Michael burnt his foot on the George Forman grill. I think I laughed for a good half hour after that episode ended. <br /><br />As far as the British version versus the American version- they are both good. British humor is very differant from American humor. I really appreciate both. I love Steve Carrel, but I also think Ricky Gervas is a comic genius. <br /><br />I hope I am wrong, but I honestly can&#039;t see the US version of The Office lasting too much longer.&nbsp; :|

				Yeah, I think it&#039;ll go on for a couple more seasons. I&#039;m glad the episodes are no longer an hour long. It was nice for the first one or two episodes and then it just got too long. Some good material, but often not enough to fill an entire hour; too much character development.

				I, like others here, prefer the British version.&nbsp; I think that the depressing, awkward tone of the British version is what I really love about it, and that&#039;s the part that didn&#039;t translate in the American version.&nbsp; I also think that the reason I didn&#039;t like the American version, initially, was because what I saw of the first season was basically a less funny version of the British version, almost scene for scene.&nbsp; <br />I have, however, recently gone back and watched the whole second season of the American one, and have laghed my pale butt off.&nbsp; I will probably start the third season tonight.&nbsp; <br />Chris Finch &gt; Todd Packer, even if Packer did make a mess of the carpet.&nbsp;

				I find the American version more enjoyable but the British version more realistic. I don&#039;t like it when the American one turns into a soap opera though.

Gone is the biting satire that I loved. Now that Dwight&#039;s a lovable oddball (instead of a wannabe fascist) and Jim and Pam are getting it on, it&#039;s like &quot;Cheers&quot; in an office.<br /><br />And I prefer the US version to the UK version. The British brand of humor was too wry for me to really get into it. And as someone else said, more bleak and depressing. I work in an office, and I prefer to be invited to laugh at it all than commiserate.

				Okay, I started watching the third season last night, and while there are some serious LOLs in there, I can&#039;t get over the fact that they&#039;re still harvesting jokes from the British version.&nbsp; <br />Now I just have to wait for a Young Ones remake...
