				I decided to go see and hear Jeremiah Frei-Pearson at his campaign rally this evening to see what he is about.&nbsp; The event was moved to a pub on Steinway Street at the last minute because of the pouring rain. <br /><br />As soon as people got in the door, his volunteers were asking people to fill in a contact sheet that they can later be contacted later for support or to volunteer.&nbsp; I just wanted to sit and listen to what he had to say.<br /><br />For about an hour there were stage performers singing Broadway songs, the crowd numbered about a hundred people.&nbsp; I do not mean to generalize, but I had the impression that many of the supporters represented the LGBT community.<br /><br />It also seemed most of his supporters were not long time residents, whereas Aravella Simotas supporters seem to be long time residents.&nbsp; This is debatable of course.&nbsp; I wonder if the Western Queens Gazette will devote as much coverage to Jeremiah&#039;s kickoff campaign as they did with Aravella&#039;s kickoff campaign.&nbsp; Put another way, I wonder if the Gazette will even cover Jeremiah&#039;s campaign.<br /><br />Interestingly, I saw a few faces that I normally see at the Powhatan Democratic Club.&nbsp; The leadership of the club is endorsing Aravella Simotas but without the benefit for members to get to know both candidates at the club itself.<br /><br />When Jeremiah finally spoke, he covered these topics:<br /><br />-- A broken and corrupt system in Albany, his support for term limits and the financial mess in New York.<br />-- His representation of Power for the People that resulted in a financial settlement and apology from Con-Ed including rebates for affected residents from the blackout<br />-- His experiences as an attorney representing the needs of children in the court system<br />-- His support of marriage equality<br />-- His support for better education and need for more hospitals<br />-- His support of President Obama and shifting change for progressive Democrats<br /><br />Jeremiah spoke in generalities about the issues, but I wanted to hear specifics.&nbsp; I am not a fan of political rallies because to me what matters are the issues.&nbsp; However the outcome, the right candidate should win on the basis of a plan to address problems.&nbsp; And I don&#039;t care about who is endorsing whom.
