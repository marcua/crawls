				<br />I know there is a health reform thread, but I will throw this here. It does come over the holidays. But that is when this looks to be going down.<br /><br /><br />http://sanders.senate.gov/<br /><br />Sanders is an independent/socialist/democrat Senator from Vermont. He should be on ABC <span class="bbc_u">This Week </span> on Sunday likely speaking on his side of these positions.<br /><br /><br />He does not represent NY, and is actually near opposite of conservative positions.&nbsp; &nbsp;:|<br />But I respect his independence and integrity.

				The AMA has weighed in on the new health<br />&nbsp;care plan being developed by team Obama.<br />The Allergists voted to scratch it, but the Dermatologists advised not<br />to make any rash moves.<br />The Gastroenterologists had sort of a gut feeling about it, but the<br />Neurologists thought the Administration had a lot of nerve.<br />The Obstetricians felt that they were labouring under a misconception.<br />Ophthalmologists considered the idea short-sighted.<br />Pathologists yelled, &quot;Over my dead body!&quot;, while the Paediatricians<br />said, &quot;Oh, grow up!&quot;<br />The Psychiatrists thought the whole idea was madness, while the<br />Radiologists could see right through it.<br />Surgeons decided to wash their hands of the whole thing. The<br />Internists thought it was a bitter&nbsp; pill to swallow<br />and the Plastic Surgeons said, &quot;This puts a whole new face on the matter&quot;.<br />&nbsp;The Podiatrists thought it was a step forward, but the Urologists<br />were p-eed&nbsp; off at the whole idea.<br />The Anaesthesiologists thought the idea was a gas, and the<br />Cardiologists didn&#039;t have the heart to say no.<br />&nbsp;In the end, the Proctologists won out, leaving the entire decision up<br />to the assholes in Government.<br /><br />

				When &#039;A&#039; goes to &#039;B&#039; and states that for &#039;X&#039; amount in contributions, they will vote a certain way, not only is our government broken, Democracy is broken.&nbsp; This has been going on for years and continues.&nbsp; I no longer have faith in either party.&nbsp; I think there should be term limits for members of Congress and the Senate.&nbsp; I think career politicians need to go.&nbsp; The system is broken and I am not sure it can be fixed.

				I was telling everyone before the last election that Obama had no clue what he was doing. Hope and Change? Yeah right. That stimulus did nothing but balloon our national debt by about ten trillion dollars. Iran is going to have a nuclear weapon and they think Obama is a punk with no balls.

Why dont you read a review of the stimulus and how much it is going to cost before you start making wiseass comments. 10 TRILLION DOLLARS. And it has nothing to do with Bush. So stop crying about the last president. Obama is spending OUR money, do you not get this? <br /><br />Now did Bush and the Republicans spend too much money? YES! They were reckless in thier spending and they got thrown out because of it. But what this president is spending is totally irresponsible and dangerous and unprecedented..

				Will move a bit OT<br /><br />http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/19/AR2010031900424.html<br /><br />Not a factual question, but what I pose to myself is would I pay about 5% more in insurance to cover the uninsured.<br />I think most appreciate the effort, but I will still question the costs, who is paying, and how it is paid.<br /><br />If a state like Australia can take care of its own, our states like NY should be able to as well. One point of interest to me is the timing of transition.<br />The most important economic factors are not in full effect until end of the decade.<br />What I would like to know from the opposition is what would be done, should have been done, to reduce costs and deficits. It appears likely that we will see billions in increased taxes. I am very skeptical that we will see more efficiency.<br /><br />[Nice notes on Federalism.<br /><br />http://www.usconstitution.net/consttop_fedr.html<br />]<br /><br />There is a great deal of heat on reform and other issues. If you care a good deal about our Congresswomen&#039;s representation, you might want to let her office know before they vote later this weekend.<br /><br /><br />In other news, Congress had a vote on timing of our troops coming home from Afghanistan. It was soundly defeated, alas.<br />Maloney, much of the NY delegation, and curiously 2 GOP voted in suppot.<br />&nbsp;:mrgreen:

The administration was left to again create a commission to focus on recommendations.<br />I am encouraged by many of the participants including the picks by Senate Dems and Obama.

We can&#039;t tax our way out. . . . The reality is we&#039;ve got to do exactly what you all do every day as governors. We&#039;ve got to cut spending or increase revenues or do some combination of that.&quot; <br /><br />Bowles pointed to steps taken recently by the new coalition government in Britain, which also faces an acute budgetary problem, as a guide to what the commission might use in its recommendations.
