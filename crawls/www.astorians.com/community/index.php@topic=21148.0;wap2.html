			Hi there -<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m looking for someone who knows how - FOR SURE - to install (mainly hang) pictures/paintings/shelves and in particular install a flat screen television that has a Rocketfish TV mount (it&#039;s a monster - tilts and turns in every direction which is why I bought it).&nbsp; It came with (and was meant for) wooden screws for 16&quot; or less wooden beams; however I live in one of the older homes in Astoria 2 blocks from Astoria Park and the wall I want to mount on, I don&#039;t know what is behind.&nbsp; Something is there b/c the wall supports the second floor (that my landlords live on).&nbsp; There are other walls that I would like to have shelves mounted to, but whatever is behind the walls varies from what seems to be sheet rock to cement that Superman himself couldn&#039;t blast through.<br /><br /><br />So, I am looking for someone who is familiar with how to drill through walls of varying consistency and one who is meticulously correct the first time; my landlords are two sisters who watch like hawks what is being done to the first floor apartment.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;d love to get a couple of references, as it isn&#039;t my home, I need to have some security that I did research on the person I chose so I can satisfy them.<br /><br /><br />I look forward to hearing back from you.<br /><br /><br />Thanks!<br />michelletheatre
