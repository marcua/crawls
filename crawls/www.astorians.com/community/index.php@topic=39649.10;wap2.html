			What, exactly, is your problem?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- Quote from: Eamonn on February 14, 2017, 02:52:58 PM ---&quot; Jose Peralta: Stop Empowering Republicans!&quot; That is a direct quote. If you don&#039;t see how that is political posturing, then there is no reasoning with you. <br /><br />--- End quote ---<br />

			I don&#039;t particularly have a dog in this fight, but I somehow suspect this argument is a rehashing of some previous fight and not actually about the post at hand. This is not about national politics, but about a LOCAL Astoria senator who started caucusing with a party other than the party whose ticket he ran on. It seems to me that a disinterested third party would classify that as a &quot;local issue&quot; rather than &quot;random gabble.&quot;<br /><br /><br />(Also, you could make a pretty strong case that for a Democrat to caucus with the Republicans is &quot;empowering Republicans,&quot; without resorting to hyperbole.)
