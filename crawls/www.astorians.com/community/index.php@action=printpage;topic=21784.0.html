Weekend trash pick-up is nonexistent and trash seems to accumulate all week long. Monday morning walks to the train are nauseating at bestâ€”our streets are filthy.<br /><br />Recently, large numbers of raccoons have been making appearances in our yards and near our apartments and houses, leaving their feces and germs behind for our children to stumble onto. <br /><br />The visual picture of sanitation in Queens does not reflect its proud and lively, growing population.<br /><br />Please help petition our elected Queens City Council members and Mayor Michael Bloomberg to prove that our neighborhoods matter by adding weekend garbage collection and more trash receptacles. </span></span><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica;" class="bbc_font">[/size]</span>[/color]<br /><span style="font-family: helvetica, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;" class="bbc_font">[/size]<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">Follow the link to sign our Change.org petition. http://www.change.org/petitions/queens-city-council-clean-up-garbage-on-the-streets-of-queens</span><span style="font-size: 13px;" class="bbc_size"></span></span>[/color]

				While I agree that weekend trash collection would be nice, it would cost money and cities just don&#039;t have it right now.<br />&nbsp;<br />I&#039;d like to see more people get involved and take responsibility.&nbsp; There&#039;s no excuse for the littering that goes on in our neighborhood.&nbsp; If the residents (and visitors) were just a little more careful, there could be a big improvement.

				Does anyone know if the law requires residential homes to put their trash in cans? There are many people in on my street who put out their bags (small grocery bags) on the sidewalk. It seems like it could easily blow around in bad weather, get torn up by hungry dogs and raccoons or kicked around when I get too drunk.

				Nope - plastic bags are considered fine.<br />&nbsp;<br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/dsny/downloads/pdf/rules/digest/DSNY_Rules_Reg.pdf (http://www.nyc.gov/html/dsny/downloads/pdf/rules/digest/DSNY_Rules_Reg.pdf)<br />&nbsp;<br />And interesting - in reading this, both merchants and residential owners are responsible for cleaning the sidewalk in front of their property and an additional 18 inches into the street.<br />&nbsp;<br />So it&#039;s not the city&#039;s problem - it&#039;s a public problem. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

				I get angry whenever I see anyone litter out of sheer laziness.&nbsp; But I agree that in Astoria there is a growing garbage problem on the streets.&nbsp; I see overflowing trash pails on nearly every corner.&nbsp; And on some stretches of heavily traveled streets, there isn&#039;t a trash pail for several blocks.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see that being the case in Manhattan.&nbsp; It shouldn&#039;t be tolerated in the outer boroughs - on any day of the week.&nbsp;

				The areas I see the most trash in are actually ones where there are garbage cans nearby. Like on the walk on 31st Street from the Ditmars stop to Ditmars. Where does all that stuff come from? Is it mostly people throwing their crap on the sidewalk, or are properly disposed of garbage bags ripping, or are cans overflowing and stuff is blowing out of them? Lots of times, I have seen people throw trash on the ground despite there being a garbage can nearby.

				Im in upper ditmars and they havent picked up recycling for 2 weeks now . They did the same thing last x-mas where they skipped out an entire month . Everyones cardboard and paper was out after the holidays so it was a total mess . The worst part is 311 tells us they are gonna pick it up the next day , so we leave it out , it never gets picked up and just gets blown around or ripped up by bottle bums.

If you place your garbage in the alley perhaps someone blocks the entrance with their vehicle(s) on pickup day(s)? We had a similar problem last winter which was caused by an extremely inconsiderate neighbor who bottlenecked the entrance with her and her daughter&#039;s SUV&#039;s pretty much all winter. The &quot;normal&quot; residents were peeved to say the least. It ain&#039;t gonna happen again this winter, I can tell you.<br /><br /><br />And yeah, I had it out with this same neighbor because she had a nasty habit of letting her flyers pile up in front of her door for days and days. Then, suddenly she&#039;d&nbsp; get a strange urge to tidy up...by throwing these flyers in front of my house into the 18&quot; zone of the street that I am responsible for keeping clean! I caught her red handed one day and asked her why she doesn&#039;t throw her trash into her garbage can, rather than in the street. She told me to drop dead, I told her she&#039;s a litterbug, she cursed at me and I called her a filthy pig. Sometimes you have to bite the bullet, be brave and speak up. Now this particular problem with this particular problem child no longer exists, because my next step would have been to report her to the DSNY. <br /><br /><br />Talking to other Astorians around the neighborhood there&#039;s always someone on the block who lives in their own world and just doesn&#039;t give a crap about anyone but themselves, but eventually you have to speak up!<br /><br />

				take our block some people put a padlock on the gate and outlawed sanitation to do pickups.&nbsp; they were not allowed to go through the alley to get our trash.&nbsp; i had to walk a long distance and ask one of my neighbors if i could leave my&nbsp; trash there, and explained what happen.&nbsp; when the people on this block see me trying to&nbsp; open the padlock so the sanitation&nbsp; can get through the alley, they get very angry. one man spit on the ground because he does not want the sanitation trucks to pick up the trash in the alley. try dealing with these people.&nbsp; last dec. we had all the storms so what happened could not be helped. that should not be compared.&nbsp; dumpers are every where, and people through trash while they are walking on the side walk, and from moving cars.sanitation people have to put up with a lot of nasty people, after all they even get killed here.&nbsp; does anyone remember that, he got killed while he was doing his job.&nbsp; he was a very nice guy always had a big wave to give to me.&nbsp; how many remember.&nbsp; i am getting the impression that no one will stop throwing the trash on the street instead of taking it home with them.

				It&#039;s illegal to fence or gate an alleyway. It&#039;s also illegal to block access in an alley with vehicles. If people don&#039;t like it they should get together and do something about: chip in and hire a lawyer/sign a petition.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m not surprised. :sad: <br /><br /><br />Once it&#039;s up it becomes a civil matter.<br /><br /><br />That&#039;s the problem around here-dirtbags&nbsp; do whatever they want because they figure (often correctly) that nobody will do anything about it. I&#039;m sure whoever spent money on that gate and padlocked it did it only for a selfish reason and knew he/she could get away with it. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m sorry you have to put up with such nonsense Kathleen.&nbsp; :sad:

				I&#039;m seeing more and more of those pre printed blue and white ones on homeowners&#039; gates around my area. I&#039;ve been tempted to slip one in my neighbor&#039;s mailbox as a hint, but she&#039;s so unstable she might think it&#039;s&nbsp; laced with anthrax. I&#039;m sure the local hardware stores carry them-definitely Home Depot. <br /><br /><br />I know leaves aren&#039;t technically garbage, but I hate when people use blowers or brooms to push the fallen leaves into the middle of the street thinking that&#039;s the proper way to clean their property. How about bagging those leaves, so they don&#039;t end up on someone else&#039;s property?!
