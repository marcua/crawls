				Hey All,<br /><br />My name is Joseph Lara and I am the publisher of the all new Astoria Celebrity &amp; Entertainment Magazine (www.astoriacelebrity.com) coming to newsstands in August of 2009.&nbsp; As part of our new venture in Astoria, we are starting a column called &quot;TalkBack&quot; in which You, the people of Astoria/LIC, can have your voices heard.&nbsp; Each issue we&#039;ll ask a question here on Astorians.com and publish the best responses we get.&nbsp; <br /><br />Our first question for our inaugural issue will be &quot;What Do You Love About Astoria?&quot;<br /><br />Thanks, and I look forward to seeing all of your great responses!

				What do I love about Astoria..let&#039;s see....<br /><br />I love the dog doodoo all over the sidewalks, I love the overflowing DOS trash cans, I love the filth in the streets, the foriegners that don&#039;t speak any English and rifle through the garbage, the crazy homeless people that the cops do nothing about, the double parkers, the motorcycles with the loud mufflers, the restuarants that have menus in arabic so they only attract middle easterners and discriminate against everyone else, the smell of hookah on Steinway btwn 25th and 28th ave......I can go on.<br /><br /><br />And in case your wondering...that was sarcasm&nbsp; :evil:

				Take a lesson from Time Out and get out there on the streets of Astoria, in the bars, at the fairs, at the lounges - and ask these questions.&nbsp; You are more likely to get responses from a larger sample of Astoria&#039;s residents, out and about, enjoying Astoria.<br /><br />Bring a video camera or a regular camera, get people&#039;s names, and print them with their quotes if they&#039;re into it.

				and offer them something for their help... buy them a drink, maybe one of the free meal passes you probably have since you are advertising and writing articles about local restaurants, or at least a free subscription....

				I&#039;m sure the cafes that serve <del>coffee</del> premium lattes to <del>pretentious yuppies and eurotrash</del> patrons who like to dine in the middle of the sidewalk will appreciate the important work and visibility you will bring to our community.&nbsp; The delicious pastries these fine establishments serve everyday is as frothy as the puff pieces your magazine aims to deliver.&nbsp; The <del>noise</del> excitement of the local nightlife is something that certainly keeps the residents up late into the night.<br /><br />To answer your question, I love everything about Astoria.&nbsp; Why go to fancy places such as Hunters Point, Corona or Flushing when Astoria has it all?&nbsp; The <del>swill</del> swell drinks they serve in those upscale lounges are just as good here and you never know when you might even bump into a celebrity!<br /><br />Let me be the first to congratulate you on your fine <del>pennysaver</del> publication.&nbsp; I know we have not done enough to sing our own praises.&nbsp; We can all drink <del>the Kool-Aid</del> to that!
