				Anyone belong to writing groups either online or in real life? Not necessarily in Astoria, but in NYC in general? Which ones, what are they like, how often does everyone meet? OR have you taken classes around the city, whether free or with a university around the city? I&#039;m trying to know more about the writing community around the city and hear experiences from people who are doing it for real.

				I belong to a writer&#039;s group that meets locally in LIC every three weeks.&nbsp; We all met in grad school and so we just bring our writing to the group and give feedback on it.&nbsp; But I&#039;ve also belonged to prompt groups -- this is when a group of around 4 - 8 people meet weekly and write together; each member takes a turn once a week to bring in a writing prompt.&nbsp; New York Writer&#039;s Coalition does prompt workshops -- I belonged to a really great group a couple of years ago.<br />I went to Columbia MFA program, and haven&#039;t really tried other schools/programs, but I&#039;ve heard good things about the Writer&#039;s Voice at the West Side Y on 63rd St.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard mixed things about Gotham, from both instructors and students.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Actually I will be teaching a writing workshop on cultural identity this summer in Woodside.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be posting a notice about it soon, I guess in the calendar section.&nbsp; It will be ten weeks, starting as a prompt workshop but also discussing readings, then halfway through people will bring in their writing for feedback to polish it, and then a reading to the public at the end of the 10 weeks.&nbsp; It will be free but everyone will pay a sliding scale donation as a form of commitment.&nbsp; I think free workshops like this are harder to find, but Cave Canem was advertising one not long ago, and I think the Asian American Writer&#039;s Workshop also does community based writing workshops like this too.&nbsp; You can try the Poetry Project as well.<br />Good luck.

				Gotham is offering free writing workshops next Tuesday.&nbsp; I just signed up for one of the fiction writing classes.&nbsp; Why not, right?&nbsp; <br /><br />Here&#039;s the link: http://free.writingclasses.com/CourseDescriptionPages/FreeWorkshopPages.php/type/L
