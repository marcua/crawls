				Hey all,<br /><br />I leave for Egypt next Wednesday.&nbsp; I will be there for 9 days and already have much of the itinerary set through www.gate1travel.com, however, 2 days with nothing planned.&nbsp; My itinerary does include the pyramids, temples, as well as a 4-day cruise on the Nile River.&nbsp; I am mostly looking for things to do at my own leisure while in Cairo.&nbsp; Any hints?!<br /><br />Also, I have a 7-hour layover in Paris on the way home from Egypt.&nbsp; At this time I also have transfer from Orly Airport to De Gaulle.&nbsp; It&#039;d be nice if someone who has previous experience in doing this knows of an efficient, relatively inexpensive way to do this, that would be awesome.&nbsp; I think I should also have time to stop for lunch or something.

				don&#039;t know if you&#039;ll have the time, but there&#039;s a really nice restaurant i think everyone should go to if in Paris, it&#039;s called &quot;La Coupole&quot;... just looked it up and it&#039;s located at 102 Boulevard du Montparnasse, looks like it&#039;s also in the center of Paris between the 6th and 14th arrondissements. Anyway, this place has amazing food... it&#039;s a little pricey, but it&#039;s worth it, and you&#039;re in Paris!&nbsp; when it&#039;s someone&#039;s birthday they turn down the lights in the entire restaurant (it&#039;s very large and spacious) and they light a sparkler on a cake and sing happy birthday loudly in French as they walk to the table.. it&#039;s just so nice.&nbsp; :smitten: ahh wish I was there...
