				<br />Hello all,<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve recently moved to Astoria but before that happened I was shopping around for apartments. I went through craigslist (what a mistake) and met a guy going by Mario Lalicata who was fronting to be a rental agent for the owners of the apartments in the Astoria area. It seemed very legitimate. He showed me about 6-8 apartments over the course of meeting up a few times. He even wrote me up a contract stating that the deposit I gave him was refundable. Low and behold he eventually stops returning my calls, I gave to the address stated on his license only to find out that the place is vacant and is possibly in foreclosure (according to property shark). I googled him and found out that he&#039;s pulled this s___ before but unfortunately to the other victims, the deposits they put down was significantly higher. <br /><br /><br />Does anybody have any experience with the proper recourse or could point me to the right resources for this? I read that the only way to go about this is small claims court but I&#039;ve also been told that most likely he won&#039;t show up for the court date but then its up to me to locate him to collect...which usually doesn&#039;t pan out successfully. <br /><br /><br />If anyone is searching on craigslist for an apartment in Astoria this guy Mario operates under the number 917-238-4897 (or he did), beware. Any advice is appreciated.

				you need to go to the nypd 114th precinct and make a complaint for fraud.&nbsp; if the police does not take the complaint and tells you that it is a &quot;civil matter&quot; then request that the officer give you his full name, shield number, and tax id number.&nbsp; you can tell him that you will report him to the queens county d.a. and to the nypd internal affairs dept for not taking the complaint.<br />also, i heard that many people were defrauded by mario and that others have already made complaints about him.&nbsp; if enough people complain hopefully the police will arrest him.<br />do you have a copy of the paperwork that he gave you?&nbsp; that is evidence of his fraud.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;

				Thanks for the reply. I have gone to the 114th precinct and they fed me the same bs about it being a &quot;civil matter&quot;. I had no idea what to say or do since I&#039;ve never had this experience before. I might have to go back there and do what you suggested here. <br /><br /><br />For anyone else reading this and is looking for an apartment in Astoria this guy Mario is a heavy set, balding prob around late 50&#039;s at around 5&#039;8&quot;-5&#039;9&quot;ish, drives a poopie car. He&#039;s pale and looks like hes perpetually sick. He preys on people looking on apartments by pretending to be an agent for his friend, the landlord and will feed you s___ about how he grew up in the neighborhood and knows everybody. Beware!

				I have the same problem too, i guess mine was before since Jan, 1. I paid the rental and deposit also signed contract but cannot move in until mid of Jan. I just went to his place and saw his wife and his mum at&nbsp; 25 55 48th street,Astoria 11103-1110. Car registered&nbsp; Fpb1103 Volvo. Last time i talked to him over the phone, he promised to return all my deposit but i cannot get through him anymore. I went to the court and submit all paper, now just have been waiting to go to the court on October, everything seems slow :( What about you now, any progress??

				Hello all.<br />&nbsp;<br />I also got scammed by Mario Lalicata. He never found me an apartment neither got my deposit money back.&nbsp; I filled a small claim against him and the court date is tomorrow.&nbsp; I hope he will paid for all that he did and all the hussle.&nbsp; Having more witness and people that also got scammed by him will definitely make the case stronger and eventually put him behing the bars.&nbsp; I can be contact through this site.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Cheers,<br />&nbsp;<br />C.

				Thanks Daryl, I just tried calling to report my story but got a message instead to call back on tues because the gentleman is out until then. I then tried searching for info on this case by using the case number on the Queens DA website but didn&#039;t find anything. Is there part of the site where I an read up on the case?

				I don&#039;t think there is anywhere to read up on it yet, as it is still early in the investigation.&nbsp; At this point there are several complaints that have been submitted.&nbsp; There is a certain number that need to be registered in order to trigger an arrest warrant, so every testimonial does make a difference.&nbsp; I would encourage you to try them back on Tuesday.&nbsp; Thanks for your dedication to making Astoria a better place!<br /><br />~Daryl~<br />

				<br />Help! I&#039;m Mario Lalicata&#039;s next deposit fraud victim!<br /><br />Mr. Lalicata posted an apartment on Craigslist and he had me come see it. It was a basement apartment in his own house on 22-55 48ST. I liked it, gave him a deposit, and he gave me a receipt writing that the deposit is fully refundable. He also gave me the key to the apartment. Then, he never let me move in. He locked the gate leading to the basement apartment entrance (new key). He kept saying that the &quot;inspector&quot; hadn&#039;t signed off on the electrical work. I asked for my deposit back. He said he already spent it on electrical work (illegal, you aren&#039;t suppose to spend deposits), but he would get me the money in a few days. It has been weeks now and he no longer answers my calls. I now understand he has no intention of returning the deposit.<br /><br />Based on the information in this forum, I&#039;ve taken the following steps:<br /><br />1. Called Astoria police at 718-626-9311. I went through their menu to community affairs and got a voicemail. Will try again.<br />2. Called Queens DA at 718-286-6000 and tried to get Richard Brown on the phone. No luck yet.<br />3. Called Greg Pavlides at 718-286-6673. Left him a voicemail.<br /><br />It seems like my next step is to file a small claims court case. I have tons of evidence against him. But I have no experience with this kind of thing. Any help would be appreciated!!! For example:<br /><br />What do you guys recommend I do next?<br />Was anyone successful at hiring a Marshall to get their money from him?<br />How much did it cost?<br />Did anyone sue for more than their deposit to cover these costs?<br />Did anyone use a lawyer they liked?

				Wow he is such a liar. I&#039;m sorry. I feel for you. I went through the same thing. <br />However I WAS ABLE TO GET MY MONEY BACK FROM THAT SCUM.<br />He had done the same thing to me back in November. I paid the deposit and then he said that he needed more money to finish the repairs to the apartment, which was electrical and the plumbing. He said I would be able to move in Jan 1st 2013. When the day came to move he said nothing was finished, he kept stalling me. When he did not honor our agreement I made him write a written contract stating I would move in a week later than expected, signed by both him and his mother and I kept all my receipts and made copies. When he did not honor the contract and sensed that he was lying I had enough of his bullshit and I told him I knew his real name (He was using a different name under Mario LaMagra ) he got scared and I threatened him, and told him I had spoken to a lawyer along with my mother and told him that if he didnt return the deposit in a few days I would not only be contacting the Marshall, the Police, the NYC Housing Dept, but I would also take him to court for the money he owed me and I would also sue him for emotional duress. He gave me a certified check to me the next week. I would suggest you threaten his ass. Or show up there. His wife and his mother who I never met def know whats going on. They are in on it too.<br /><br />What&#039;s funny is I ran into him the other week at the pizza shop. He didn&#039;t see me but I saw him. I wish I could of spit in his slice.<br />Best of Luck.<br />

				Hi Defy1x - I&#039;m so sorry Mario screwed you too. I&#039;m also encouraged that he responded to your threats! Hopefully he will respond to mine. But the longer he takes, the further down the process of suing him I get. Thanks for reaching out.

				Hi guys,<br />Now I too have been scammed by this scum! My friend paid him 1200 and i gave him 600 to share his downstairs apartment at 25-55 48th st. He then postponed our move in date by a month, claiming it didn&#039;t pass inspection due to an electricity problem, and now won&#039;t give us our deposits back! I have called the queens county DAs office and added my case to the investigation. If we get enough witnesses to his crimes we can put this asshole where he belongs! Please contact me if you have also been involved with this guy. The more we network the closer we can get to justice.

				Hey all, I have also met with the assistant DA today. I also went to Mario&#039;s place to get the money back and had the police meet me there. They couldn&#039;t do anything because they couldn&#039;t prove intent. However the DA is on the case. If you have been involved with Mario Lalicata, PLEASE call the DA and tell them your story. The assistant DA I have been in contact with is<br />Lauren Steele<br />718-286-5867<br />LDsteele@queensda.org<br />The more people contact the DA, the stronger of a case they will have. Thanks!

I met with Lauren today and gave her all the evidence I could, but you have even more evidence than I do.

				BTW everyone, if you could also please contact the local police precinct (114th precinct) and file a complaint, it will help their investigation as well.&nbsp; They now have two open complaints of Grand Larseny against this guy, the more they get the more likely they will be to investigate the matter.&nbsp; Their number is (718) 626-9334 or (718) 626-9311 .&nbsp; Their address is 3416 Astoria Blvd S, Astoria, NY 11103&nbsp; &nbsp;They might try to tell you it is a civil matter, but that is false.&nbsp; We were able to file the complaint as Grand Larseny and don&#039;t give up until you are able to as well.

				I have been a victim of this guy named Mario too. I checked his semi-basement place on 25-55 48th St. back in March 23 and gave him a deposit with the fixed move in date. Since then he has been changing the date with the same bs inspection story and now wouldn&#039;t return my money or my call.<br /><br />So far I made a complain to:<br />1. NYC Consumer Frauds &amp; Protection Bureau<br />2. IC3 (Internet Crime Complaint Center<br />3. NYC Housing Dept.<br />4. Queens DA Office through the general email<br /><br />I am not sure how effective those offices would be on my case but now I need to talk to Greg Pavlides and Lauren Steele from DA office, which I think would be the best bet. Appreciated to all who share their advices and for those who still haven&#039;t got their money back, let&#039;s fight till we get our money back and keep this monster out of the neighborhood.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Also please go to the 114th precinct and file a complaint against him of grand larseny. We just went on Wednesday so they are familiar with him. I would also like to get you in contact with chinony, who is speaking with a reporter from Fox News. Call me at 415-342-5161 to discuss further please. Also, show the police and the DA his picture. We now know of 5 people who were all supposed to move in around the same time. This proves that he never intended us to move in, since 5 people can&#039;t move in to a 2 bedroom apartment.

				Thanks to all the victims for your bravery...keep working until justice is served...<br />&nbsp;<br />For everyone&#039;s knowledge, according to the department of buildings, Mario Lalicata aka LaMagra doesn&#039;t own the house at 25-55 48th street, nor is he the landlord or caretaker at all.&nbsp; Neither do his wife nor mother own the building.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, he hasn&#039;t been paying his rent, and the actual landlord has filed an eviction notice.&nbsp; Also, the basement apartment, is actually an illegal cellar, in a 1 family house.&nbsp; It is illegal to occupy it, and the fire department could actually force you out to a hotel.&nbsp; I would recommend that in addition to filing grand larceny charges with the precinct, and talking to Ms Steele, please call the buildings department at 311 as well as the fire department, to report the illegal conversion of the cellar, and the fire hazard associated with its occupancy.&nbsp; I think going to the media makes sense too.&nbsp; Other people need to know these stories, so that they don&#039;t fall into the same trap.&nbsp; Call the television stations, and the local newspapers.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />I hope this helps...<br />&nbsp;<br />~Daryl

After that I also went to the small claims court and set a court date.<br />BTW he is not picking up my call at all, does anyone have any luck getting him on the phone at least?<br />Also, is his real name Mario Lalicata or Mario Lamagre?

				His real name is Mario Lalicata. He started using an alias after the initial complaints started going to the DA&#039;s office. His wife&#039;s name is Angela and his mother is Calogera or Lina. I would not try to make contact with him, if I were you. Have the police or your lawyer reach out instead.

				<br /><br /><br />Hello,<br /><br /><br />Unfortunately, I am one who has been caught in this scam. In mid april, I was shown a downstairs apartment at 25-55 48th st.&nbsp; I was given &quot;Mario Lamagra&quot; as his name and I had made a bank check for $1200 to a Calogera Lamagra, at his request.&nbsp; Mario claimed that this was his mother and told me the place would be Move in Ready on May 1st.&nbsp; We have spoken at least once a week regarding delays and the need for further inspection.&nbsp; He posted that he will compensate me for my time renting a hostel (which I am at).&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />The last I met with him was LAST monday (May 13) on Steinway and 30th at a convenient store as he had promised to give me some of my money back.&nbsp; He did not and instead gave me $100 and another time to meet him.&nbsp; I am thinking that he is scamming others to pay others back and this is what he is waiting for.&nbsp; I will pursue the actions that others have described here and I hope we can get this low-life.&nbsp; I am going to attempt to schedule a meet up with him again, but he bailed on our meeting yesterday and was a no show.&nbsp; I will let you guys know what if there is a meet up.&nbsp; We should get the police involved in arresting this man.

				<br />It looks like, according to NYC housing records, that Mario Lalicata sold the apartment (25-55 48ST) to Giuseppe Mattina on December 15, 2011. I looked this up using Acris which is available online here: http://a836-acris.nyc.gov/DS/DocumentSearch/PartyName<br /><br /><br />The contract itself is viewable here: http://a836-acris.nyc.gov/DS/DocumentSearch/DocumentImageView?doc_id=2011121501053001<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m not a legal eagle, but it looks like Giuseppe Mattina owns the apartment, not Mario or his mother Lina. Has anyone else tried to interpret this document? I think it strengthens our case to show that he didn&#039;t have the right to rent out the basement apartment in the first place.

				Mattina owns the building, but noone has the right to rent the basement because it is actually an illegal cellar. It is illegal to live in a cellar in nyc. The buildings department can force you out of a cellar and into a hotel.<br /><br />~Daryl

				Thanks Daryl! Quick follow-up: How did we find out that the basement is an illegal cellar? I would love to be able to print off the supporting document to be able to show a judge/investigator so I can prove the basement is an illegal cellar. Is that a public record, or is it online somewhere? Thanks for your help!

				I am able to find, via the NYC buildings page, that 25-55 48ST is listed as an &quot;A5-1 FAMILY DWELLING&quot;. You can see this document here: http://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/PropertyProfileOverviewServlet?boro=4&amp;houseno=25-55&amp;street=48ST&amp;requestid=0&amp;s=A03C41B885B461E4F46BD08866A7430E (http://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/PropertyProfileOverviewServlet?boro=4&amp;houseno=25-55&amp;street=48ST&amp;requestid=0&amp;s=A03C41B885B461E4F46BD08866A7430E)<br /><br /><br />The definition of an &quot;A5&quot; dwelling, according to the NYC.goc website, is a &quot;one family attached or semi-detached&quot; building. Definition here: <span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">http://nycserv.nyc.gov/nycproperty/help/hlpbldgcode.html</span> (http://nycserv.nyc.gov/nycproperty/help/hlpbldgcode.html)</span><br /><br /><br />Because 25-55 48ST is defined as a &quot;one family&quot; building, that seems to suggest that a basement apartment would be unauthorized, since it would need to be considered a two family, or something like that. But d<span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">oes this convincingly show that the basement is illegal as an apartment? Does someone have documentation, or the legal knowledge, to prove that it is illegal?

				The terminology is a bit confusing, but a basement and a cellar are very different in nyc. A basement is defined as having at least 50% of it above ground. It is possible to legalize a basement and rent it, by applying at the buildings department to convert from 1 family to 2 family. If you dont do that, then it is illegal to rent it. A cellar is defined as being more than 50% below ground. A cellar can never be rented or occupied legally in nyc, it is used only for utilities and storage.<br /><br />Either way, that was an illegal apartment being offered by a con artist who had no jurisdiction over it anyways.<br /><br />~Daryl
