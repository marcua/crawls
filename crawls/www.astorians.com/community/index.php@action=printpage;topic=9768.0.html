				I spent my day with four former female colleagues. We stayed inside and away from the rain, talked about everything and anything, and ate cheese and chocolate fondue. Such a total &quot;chick flick&quot; kind of day. When we planned our visit we did not know it was International Women&#039;s Day. Spending time with four dynamic women made my first (known) IWD quite special.<br /><br />One of my friends that was with us today was born and raised in Russia. Apparently, this day is celebrated much more internationally than it is in the US. My friend said as a child in Russia, women were given flowers and small gifts on IWD. Throughout the day today, her Russian friends were calling and texting her to wish her well on International Women&#039;s Day. I thought this was quite beautiful. <br /><br /><em>Celebrated on 8 March, International Women&#039;s Day (IWD) is the global day connecting all women around the world and inspiring them to achieve their full potential. International Women&#039;s Day has been observed since in the early 1900&#039;s, a time of great expansion and turbulence in the industrialized world that saw booming population growth and the rise of radical ideologies.</em><br /><br />http://www.internationalwomensday.com/about.asp<br /><br />Happy International Women&#039;s Day to all of our dynamic Astorian Women!
