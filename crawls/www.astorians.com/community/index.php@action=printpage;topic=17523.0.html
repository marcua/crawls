				Last Friday night, my wife and I went into Astoria Wines to purchase some wine and enjoy the tasting they do, every Friday night. I&#039;ve been in the past and my experience was always superb. However, at the most recent visit, we were not greeted by anyone and their was no tasting. Ok, not really a problem. Until I noticed 3-4 employees (?) eating food and drinking wine at the register. They did not acknowledge a single patron that came in to buy wine, only those who seemed to be friends and have some food/ wine with them. Upon choosing a bottle for the evening, my wife asked if there was to be a tasting. The reply: &quot;We don&#039;t know, waiting for someone to come and do it.&quot;<br />A couple moments later, I tried to approach the register (which was essentially the dinner table for the employee group assembled there) and asked &quot;may I purchase this wine?&quot; One person snickered at me, and the cashier rung me up. <br /><br />The wine selection here is good, and the prices are also good. They&#039;re not amazing, but I feel that it&#039;s ok to pay 10% more for personalized service and attention. I will probably go back, but if I receive this kind of (in)attention again, it will be the last time.

				I haven&#039;t been there, but it sounds an awful lot like my brunch experience at Sparrow a few months ago.&nbsp; The waitstaff and bartenders could barely be bothered to acknowledge any customers, but had all sort of laughs and attention for their friends and co-workers.&nbsp; Way to go, guys.&nbsp; You got a lousy tip for it and we haven&#039;t been back.

				wow.&nbsp; I go in Astoria Wine and Spirits with some regularity and they&#039;ve always been very attentive.&nbsp; Maybe it was an off night?&nbsp; They&#039;re usually so eager to help.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t made it to a wine-tasting there, but I&#039;m looking forward to checking one out.

				The owner must&nbsp; not have been there.&nbsp; He is usually on top of everything.&nbsp; I would call the store and ask to speak with him and explain what happened.&nbsp; He seems to be the responsive type.&nbsp; If I were him and knew my employees were acting in such a way I would want to know about it.

				I&#039;m really surprised that you had a bad experience there.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been in there at least a dozen times and NEVER have had anything close to bad service.&nbsp; In fact, they usually go out of their way to help.&nbsp; I agree - chat with the owner and let him know because I&#039;m sure he won&#039;t be too happy to know his employees are potentially damaging his hard earned reputation.<br /><br />FYI he&#039;s referring to the one on Broadway between 34th and 35th Street.

				Sounds like the same experience i had at the liquor store on 34th and 30th.&nbsp; I think its more of a New York thing.

				What are some of the better wine/liquor stores in south Astoria?&nbsp; I usually go to the one on Broadway between Crescent and 23rd Street, and their wine selection is decent but nothing special.&nbsp; The one on 34th Avenue between Crescent and 24th Street caters more to the liquor drinkers and gets very sketchy late at night...but I never know where else to go.

				I&#039;m lucky enough to live near Grand Wine &amp; Liquor - right on 31st Street just off 30th Ave.<br /><br />Excellent wine and liquor selection and the prices are very good. I honestly never go anywhere<br />else unless I need something last minute while I&#039;m at work in the city. <br /><br />And FYI - if you&#039;re in Chelsea/Flatiron area, try Bottle Rocket Wine &amp; Spirits on 19th Bet. 5th &amp; 6th Ave.<br />Great selection, good prices, nice staff. They do frequent tastings and also hold classes. And their cream-<br />color labrador who holds court near the door is a real sweetie!<br />

				For wine I like Off The Vine, 44-21 30th Avenue.&nbsp; It&#039;s small but has a good selection.

				The liquor store on 31 st between Ditmars and 23rd Ave is awesome.&nbsp; They are extremely helpful and always very friendly.&nbsp; I highly recommend them.

				Grand is good but it sometimes feels like I walked into a high school party.&nbsp; Seems like mostly high school girls work the registers... when the owners/managers aren&#039;t around the maturity level drops there too.&nbsp; Not a big deal to me but Astoria Wine and Spirits isn&#039;t the only place it happens.

				I have to say, I&#039;ve had nothing but good experiences at AW&amp;S. They&#039;ve never steered me wrong with a recommended pairing for whatever meal I have planned and I&#039;ve always found the folks there friendly and helpful.
