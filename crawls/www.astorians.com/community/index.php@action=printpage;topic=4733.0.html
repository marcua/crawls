				... on the way to the pastry shop.&nbsp; So I&#39;ve just started an externship at a wholesale bakery on the lower east side. I&#39;d worked there two days, today being my third.&nbsp; The plan was to arrive there at 11 this morning.&nbsp; Easy, right?&nbsp; Yeah, not so much.&nbsp; During the week I can take the V train straight there, from the 36th street station.&nbsp; Well, who knew the V doesn&#39;t run on weekends?&nbsp; I didn&#39;t.&nbsp; So I have to wait about a week for an R.&nbsp; I get off at 34th Street, call the chef to say I&#39;m going to be a bit late, she&#39;s cool with it, and I head back down to the F train.&nbsp; Everything&#39;s great on the F till West 4th Street, then it decides to run along the A train line.&nbsp; What the hell?!&nbsp; Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t figure out what was going on till Brooklyn!&nbsp; I get off at High Street/Brooklyn-freakin&#39;-Bridge and call again, only this time I&#39;m practically hyperventilating.&nbsp; At this point I&#39;m half an hour late!&nbsp; So the chef&#39;s delightful business partner tells me not to panic and get a cab.&nbsp; I don&#39;t have money with me.&nbsp; She says they&#39;ll take care of it.&nbsp; So the driver takes me to the place, and I hurry in to get the money.&nbsp; In my haste to get the driver his money, I open the door and somehow the metal rod from the canvas blind catches on the doorframe.&nbsp; Naturally, as I am the world&#39;s clumsiest person, I trip directly over the stuck rod, which has now been mostly ripped from the canvas. There is a table right by the door, on which my friend Lori and the chef are decorating a very intricate wedding cake (which had a dramatic episode before I even arrived), and if I had tried to catch myself on the table, the cake would have been flung across the shop into the wall.&nbsp; But instead,&nbsp; I tumble out the door, the two chefs trying to catch me by my jacket, but they&#39;re a bit too late and I end up sprawled all over the street.&nbsp; Fortunately, my only audience are my colleagues, the cab driver, and a dude standing by the pastry shop smoking.&nbsp; He says to me, while laughing heartily, &quot;That was nice.&nbsp; Thanks for that.&quot;&nbsp; The girls are laughing, the cab driver is laughing, and my buddy the smoking dude is laughing.&nbsp; Not only do I feel like an arse, but I have hit my arm on the step and torn open my lovely, and on-the-severe-side burn that I achieved on Friday while removing tarts from the oven.&nbsp; I&#39;m bleeding, in pain, having proven I&#39;m a total prat, and am now nearly an hour late.&nbsp; I am so glad to say that I hit the jackpot of externship sites, and my tardiness is completely forgiven. I mean, they paid for my cab!!&nbsp; We just laughed the whole thing off and I was given a few minutes to chill out before diving into the pecan bars.&nbsp; <br /><br />I just had to share that story.&nbsp; Too ridiculous!&nbsp;

				Oh my god, I do NOT miss the F. You think it taking a trip over the A-line is scary (which it does commonly), you don&#39;t even want to KNOW what it does when it gets into Brooklyn. (Okay, try turning into a C train so you have to transfer to a G which becomes an F after Smith &amp; 9th. Whee!)<br /><br />Trains in Queens seem so SANE compared with the crap I used to deal with in BK. Either way, I&#39;m glad you made it to work!&nbsp; :-)
