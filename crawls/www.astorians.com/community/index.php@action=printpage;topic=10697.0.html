				hi! <br />I play on a women&#039;s soccer team based here in astoria. sadly our season has ended until the fall, so while we will no longer be having organized practices, we will still be playing thoughout the summer. <br /><br />we wanted to throw an invite out to anyone, male or female that would be interested in playing. <br />tuesday nights at 7pm in astoria park. we usually meet by the benches south of the hellsgate. if the group gets big enough we will have to migrate to a new spot! hope to see lots of you there.

				I know it&#039;s a park and people like using it to play sports, but truthfully Astoria Park is unlike other parks in NYC like Central Park and Prospect Park in that the fields are non-sustainable. There are no sprinklers to water the lawns ( only rain) so if organized sports are played on the lawns, they will get ruined in a very short amount of time. Plus, technically, if you have groups bigger than certain sizes, you will need to get a permit to play on the field. You can go to places like Flushing Meadows Corona Park where there plenty of soccer fields with astro turf no less that you won&#039;t have to worry about killing-LITERALLY. The lawns at Astoria really can&#039;t take much more of people playing organized sports on them who don&#039;t know, or even worse, don&#039;t care that soon we won&#039;t have lawns to play, rest, or picnic on anymore. And it really doesn&#039;t take much for it to turn into a dustbowl. Have you ever wondered where those bare patches came from, which we have at the top of the great lawn in Astoria Park next to 19th Street? Or the one north of the Hell Gate Bridge, which has slowly been repairing itself, due to the huge amounts of rain that we have had lately? I am not against sports by any means, but we have parks nearby with purpose built facilities, like Whitey Ford field ( 1st Street and 24th Ave-formerly Hell Gate field) http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=whitey+ford+field&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=31.095668,59.765625&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=40.774724,-73.933439&amp;spn=0.007247,0.014591&amp;z=16 (http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=whitey+ford+field&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=31.095668,59.765625&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=40.774724,-73.933439&amp;spn=0.007247,0.014591&amp;z=16)

				i get your concerns, but astoria park is an open park for everyone to enjoy. playing soccer is no different then the group of guys who play flag football or ultimate frisbee or the kids who have little league practice in the park. the park is there as open space for everyone. <br />as someone who also enjoys having a picnic in our park, I can say that I love it when there is a group of kids or adults in the park playing sports or hanging out. it makes it a real park, not just a place to sun yourself.&nbsp; there may be some bald spots, but astoria park is by no means a dustbowl. and if the activities stick to those places, then there isnt a problem. <br />i&#039;m more upset with the picnic-ers who insist on leaving their trash behind. <br /><br />also, just to be clear you need a permit to use the soccer fields in flushing meadows park, as well im sure whitey ford field. as you do on our field we rent to play and practice on during the season. the park is a back-up spot where we can invite more people to come out and play and enjoy the park alongside those resting.

				They aren&#039;t just concerns. Actually Astoria Park is not a &quot;back up space&quot; for those who wish to play organized sports. That&#039;s what Whitey Ford field is for. Also, I have never seen groups of little leaguers practicing in the park, which is interesting since there isn&#039;t a baseball field to speak of. I too enjoy things like frisbee, but not at the expense of our grassy areas. And to say that if people keep to the bare patches, well that&#039;s just a little ridiculous. The bare patches became bare because of sports being played there in the first place! And if you think people will only play on those bare spots, well I&#039;ve got news for you, they don&#039;t. Hanging out in the park is one thing, having a full 7 on 7 or 9 on 9 soccer, frisbee or rugby game is quite another. That&#039;s why those groups are asked NOT to play on the fields in Astoria Park. You completely ignored what I said about WHY they can&#039;t play there. And I know about the need for permits to play. The permits are issued because they are for organized games, meaning it&#039;s not just a &quot;pick-up game&quot;, like a father booting the ball around with his kids. And I honestly hate that people can&#039;t pick up their own trash. But it isn&#039;t just picnickers, it is people who sit on benches and leave their dunkin donuts cups &amp; bags, starbuck&#039;s cups, Martha&#039;s bakery boxes, etc etc.

				i&#039;m really sorry you feel this way, but a tuesday night friendly game is by no means &#039;organized sports&#039;. <br /><br />i didnt ignore what you said, i just disagree. there is nothing in the park rules that says a group of people from the neighborhood cant play a pick-up game in the park. <br />i cant speak for everyone, but i can speak for me. we do play in the already bald spots. these spots did not become bald this year, they have been like that for a long time because people have been playing sports in the park for a long time. it is a park, that is what it is for.

				If you saw what happened to the field inside the track area a few years ago when &quot;pick up&quot; soccer games were played there you would&#039;nt be so cavalier. It literally became a dust&nbsp; bowl, not only unsightly, but the dirt and dust swirled through the air making the entire area uninhabatible and the air unfit to breath.<br /><br />If you had the slightest concern for the parks environment and the use of the parks by others, you wouldn&#039;t be so&nbsp; unconcerned about this issue. Why do you think Parks places boulders in grassy areas where people keep flagrantly keep disobeying the park rules? Or do you think the rules&nbsp; don&#039;t apply to you and your group ?<br /><br />Pls keep soccer games to the areas made for them using permits for those fields.&nbsp;

I&#039;m at the park EVERY DAY, in the morning in the afternoon&nbsp; and most nights, and I have seen those spots come and go, and the bare patch&nbsp; north of the Hell Gate is finally recovering, on its own I might add, but the two, and soon to be three bare spots, on the great lawn have not recovered. If you keep playing, those spots will only get bigger and then soon enough we won&#039;t even have a lawn to speak of.

				i really am sorry that we have such a difference of opinion. i really dont have an attitude, ive been trying really hard not to have an attitude. I put a friendly post up to invite other people to join me and my friends and have a nice evening in the park, and the two responses i got were full of attitude and judgement. <br />i am in the park quite frequently myself, but just because i enjoy playing soccer in the park doesnt mean that i dont respect the park or the other patrons.<br />all im trying to say is that we have different opinions on this topic and i understand what you are saying, but im just saying im coming from a different perspective.&nbsp;

				It isn&#039;t only a matter of differences of opinion. The Astoria Park Alliance is working closely together with the NYC Parks Department to prevent sports from being played on the fields and trying to bring back the grass that was lost due to such behaviors and attitudes. So it isn&#039;t just my &quot;opinion&quot;.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t attitude and judgement on my part, it is a fact of life in our park. And yes, playing a pick up game of soccer on our grass does mean that you don&#039;t respect the park. We ( The Astoria Park Alliance) have been working really hard to prevent sports from being played on the grass since it causes the dust-bowl effect. I am not being judgmental, just honest and truthful in the best way possible.

When you don&#039;t see the whole picture and understand exactly what I&#039;m talking about and know that Astoria Park is NOT a sports facility, then you make comments like you just did. The park is maintained, you may not think so, since there tends to be a lot of litter, but don&#039;t blame the maintenance workers, blame the citizens of Astoria or whomever uses the park for not taking out what they take into the park. The workers who maintain Astoria Park also do maintenance at approximately 20 other parks in Western Queens. I bet you didn&#039;t know that. So they can&#039;t be around 24/7 to keep tabs on people littering, that&#039;s why you will see me, almost on a daily basis, picking up what other, more insensitive people, have left behind. The issue of not playing isn&#039;t that we are against soccer or football or rugby, it&#039;s just the fields get torn up, and it is a real shame, cause I&#039;m sure you&#039;d rather go and lay in the sun on a grassy field rather than a dust-bowl. I know I would. And I will tell you this. I have noticed that in the last week or so, the area at the top of the great lawn has almost doubled in size. And the bare patch north of the Hell Gate bridge? Well, that started to heal itself, but last Saturday I noticed another bare patch starting to form. And today it was 3 times as large as it was then.<br /><br />&nbsp;So to those who will answer me sarcastically, or think that I am off my rocker, or neg nod me or what have you. Go ahead, make jokes. But don&#039;t come running to me when there is no damned lawn left to speak of. Because then all I will have to say is: i TOLD YOU SO.

				I appreciated your sarcastic sense of humour, so it didn&#039;t piss me off.<br /><br />But seriously no one is ostracizing anyone who wants to play sport. Just do it on the designated fields (with a permit if neccessary) and follow the rules.<br /><br />Just a few years ago - when the Track became a dust bowel (Literally) that whole half of the park was unusable and unfit for human life. The entire field was all dust and it blew around everywhere and would get in your lungs.<br /><br />Look up the definition of a dust bowel.&nbsp; Believe me if we had one summer of&nbsp; &quot;pick up soccer games&quot; in the park that would do it.<br /><br />I&#039;m suprised that all the young otherwise environmentally educated people here don&#039;t see this - or argue the point when they are informed.

				I understand you are trying to protect the grass and prevent the dreaded dustbowl effect that has happened before, but tell me, do you let your dog run off leash through the grass after it rains (during off leash hours of course)?&nbsp; Do you let your dog continue to play with other dogs in the same part of a field?&nbsp; Does your dog chase Birds, Squirrels or other parks creatures?&nbsp; Do you let your dog drink from the fountain?&nbsp; Have you ever walked your dog through the play ground between the pool and the river?<br /><br />These are all things that parks asks you not to do (http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_things_to_do/facilities/af_dog_runs.html), yet when I am out with my puppy I see happening all the time.<br /><br />Yes I understand that the grass is fragile, but there are large open spaces and people, who are not violating any rules of the park, want to enjoy the park the way they want to.&nbsp; I’ve seen signs by the parks department in small parks down by my offices, asking people not to lay out blankets on the grass because it can kill the grass, yet people seem to have no problem with people laying out a blanket all day on the grass, stopping it from getting needed sunlight.&nbsp; I see people driving/parking on the grass to set up things for their event (like a concert last week).&nbsp; Unless people want to turn all of the grass into an off-limits area, or out-law any type of activity on the grass, then maybe people should concentrate their efforts on getting more fields developed for people to play soccer/sports that are made of Astroturf.<br />

				I think there&#039;s a difference between a couple of people kicking around a soccer ball for fun and a whole &quot;team&quot; of people who are playing a serious game of soccer for hours on end.&nbsp; It was hard to tell from the OP which one of these categories she fell into but it sounded more like the latter which is why there&#039;s some objection.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think anyone here is against people using the grass for recreation like frisbee or playing catch or dogs playing, etc. - but using it as a &quot;sports field&quot; for real, full length games is a whole other thing.&nbsp; That will do damage to the park if it&#039;s done with any frequency.&nbsp;

When you don&#039;t see the whole picture and understand exactly what I&#039;m talking about and know that Astoria Park is NOT a sports facility, then you make comments like you just did. The park is maintained, you may not think so, since there tends to be a lot of litter, but don&#039;t blame the maintenance workers, blame the citizens of Astoria or whomever uses the park for not taking out what they take into the park. The workers who maintain Astoria Park also do maintenance at approximately 20 other parks in Western Queens. I bet you didn&#039;t know that. So they can&#039;t be around 24/7 to keep tabs on people littering, that&#039;s why you will see me, almost on a daily basis, picking up what other, more insensitive people, have left behind. The issue of not playing isn&#039;t that we are against soccer or football or rugby, it&#039;s just the fields get torn up, and it is a real shame, cause I&#039;m sure you&#039;d rather go and lay in the sun on a grassy field rather than a dust-bowl. I know I would. And I will tell you this. I have noticed that in the last week or so, the area at the top of the great lawn has almost doubled in size. And the bare patch north of the Hell Gate bridge? Well, that started to heal itself, but last Saturday I noticed another bare patch starting to form. And today it was 3 times as large as it was then.<br /><br />&nbsp;So to those who will answer me sarcastically, or think that I am off my rocker, or neg nod me or what have you. Go ahead, make jokes. But don&#039;t come running to me when there is no damned lawn left to speak of. Because then all I will have to say is: i TOLD YOU SO.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Lighten up francis&nbsp; (hey I should put that in the movie quotes too&nbsp; -- any guesses?)

				I would love to play pick-up soccer, but, alas, I&#039;ve never actually played the sport.&nbsp; It sure seems like fun.&nbsp; I mean everywhere, all over the globe, in parks, dirt lots, and just about anywhere folks are playing soccer.&nbsp;

				This has been a really interesting thread.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always wondered why the grass is so sparse in certain areas of Astoria Park, especially at the top of the big open meadow where everyone lets their dogs run.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t sure but then had to assume it&#039;s become the official unofficial dog run.&nbsp; In places like Central Park, an entire lawn will be roped off and seeds planted, so the grass can recover and the park look green again.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t really seen that happen in Astoria Park too much.&nbsp; I know the frisbee team plays there a lot and was told they actually were given the middle track field to play in this summer.&nbsp; I saw video of the storm we had a few weeks ago and that area was a dust bowl.&nbsp; I thought the sand came from the shot put area, but I wouldn&#039;t know.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway, if there are designated areas for organized play and for lounging around and for an unofficial dog run, I think a good compromise could be reached.&nbsp; Seems as if none of this is spelled out, and the Parks Alliance should address this if they haven&#039;t already.&nbsp; It&#039;d be nice if our park had its own staff so that rules against littering and such could be enforced.&nbsp; I do like that park but some of it is clearly an eyesore and should be rehabilitated so the grass can grow back.&nbsp; If for no other reason than dirt is pretty ugly.&nbsp; And dirty.

				Daisy, if a dog run were to be established in Astoria Park then our dogs would lose their off leash privileges in the park. The bare patches were not caused by the dogs being off leash, since we walk in all the grassy areas of the park with them. You mentioned Central Park having bare patches roped off and seeded. Well&nbsp; Central Park and Prospect Park get more money since they both have conservancies, which Astoria Park doesn&#039;t. We are only able to get basic maintenance. Perhaps one day after the Astoria Park Alliance has grown and we are able to raise the funds, then perhaps our park will be able to afford these luxuries that Central Park and Prospect Park has. Until then, we all have to work <em>together</em> to try and make our park accessible to all, and to understand the limitations set by the Parks Department on the fields of Astoria Park.

				I wasn&#039;t trying to say we shouldn&#039;t work together, or that dogs should lose their off lease privileges.&nbsp; I was just making some observations about the park, and that I actually agree organized sports should be in designated areas.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know much about the Park Alliance but assume they are a community organization that can help us all work together to make the park better, and there&#039;s no harm in setting goals for what we&#039;d like our park to become.
