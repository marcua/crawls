				Thanks to everyone who helped us with names. We took them all into consideration but when it came down to it, we decided on something basic so there would be little explaining. Without further ado... we are:<br /><br />Astoria CSA <br /><br />We have a website (with little on it but more tk): www.astoriacsa.com<br />We are working on a brochure<br />We are hashing out our membership contract<br />We have a phone number to leave your questions/ comments/ concerns (will be posted to our website)<br /><br />Things are going to start moving VERY fast from here out so PLEASE spread the word! Our farmers need the bulk of funds by the end of March! <br /><br />Our next public event will hopefully be March 20/21/22. Exact date to be confirmed. It is a Membership Drive, Q&amp;A with our beautiful farmers and an opportunity for those looking to split shares to find a buddy at Cafe Bar. Special gifts will be given to those that register that evening (we will be receiving checks and will prob have a computer for credit card registration on hand).<br /><br />That said, if you&#039;re looking to split shares (shares feed 3-4 non-veggies) please start a forum here. <br /><br />Once we get a few dates confirmed keep your eyes peeled for some green fliers about the neighborhood! And if anyone is willing to help with members in some way, let us know!!!<br /><br />Thanks!

				Price is $500 and feeds 3-4 non-Veggies. We realize prices are high and are *helping* people find share partners to split costs (though are not responsible for pairing). Members will also be able to buy into fruit shares ($130), tomato shares (one-time bulk drop, 20 lbs, $25) and we will have grass-fed beef, dairy, cheese, honey, bread supplies delivered monthly from upstate (orders up to individual and delivered monthly).<br /><br />A Q&amp;A/ Member Drive with out lovely farmers of Golden Earthworm Organic Farm will take place at the end of March. It will also be an opp for people to pair to split shares.<br /><br />Pick up will be Thursdays, 4:30-7:30 at Cafe Bar (36th St and 34th Ave)<br /><br />Another plus-- we&#039;ll be famous! Look for articles in Time Out NY and the Queens Chronicle in the coming weeks!
