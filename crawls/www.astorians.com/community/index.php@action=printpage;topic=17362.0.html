				true - but I would imagine it will be competing with Michael&#039;s, just down the street on Broadway.&nbsp; I wonder how Moonstruck will fare.

				I&#039;m happy to hear this.&nbsp; We get our diner fare from Bel Aire and Sanfords.&nbsp; And I&#039;m not the biggest fan of Sanfords, and Bel Aire is good but during&nbsp; the winter food often arrives either sort of cold or soggy.&nbsp; It&#039;ll be nice having a diner just a block or so away.&nbsp;

				I ate at a Moonstruck in the Village a couple of years ago and wasn&#039;t too impressed. Chain diners aren&#039;t really for me (not that I adore Michael&#039;s)- I feel that diners are supposed to have character.&nbsp; Hopefully this one won&#039;t be another cookie-cutter restaurant.

				Been inside, the place on the corner looks really nice the other tunnel like space looks nice also I just don&#039;t think they work well with each other. I know the food will be somewhat modern diner fair. Looks like Broadway is having a revival with all these new places Pomme, Rioja, The greek around from Mundo (can&#039;t remember name).

				Bihari I think is the Greek place on Broadway near Mundo (they say it&#039;s the same old owners as Stamatis and the same staff are in there, decent food though nothing particularly exciting).<br /><br />Has anyone tried Pomme?

				i wish they had taken the old astoria diner space on steinway instead. there&#039;s precious little to order from in this neck of the woods and i&#039;ve been waiting for a decent diner to take over that spot. it&#039;s been vacant for ages.

				It looks like they may only be taking part of the space, the second floor still is for rent and there is no signage on the space next door.&nbsp; Is it only the ground floor of Kolonaki that they are taking?

				I wish it were on 30th Avenue.&nbsp; 30th Avenue needs a good diner to replace the Keystone.&nbsp; But that stretch of Broadway already has Michael&#039;s, the best diner in Astoria.

				It&#039;s not that large...I think there were perhaps 10 tables downstairs when it was Kolonaki?&nbsp; And that was without a kitchen.&nbsp; Perhaps they&#039;re taking over the spot next to Kolonaki as well?

				I&#039;m not really impressed with Michael&#039;s.&nbsp; My guy and I have been there twice for breakfast food and both times the food was pretty horrendous.&nbsp; The scrambled eggs were especially gross.&nbsp; They were undercooked and covered with cooking grease.&nbsp; I figure if you can&#039;t do scrambled eggs half way decently, it&#039;s not worth checking out the other food.

				I&#039;m a big Michael&#039;s fan and eat there many times a week.&nbsp; In 16 years I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve had more than one or two bad meals there (I don&#039;t like meat with bones, so that was the cause both times).&nbsp; I am not really a breakfast person, so I do the salads, the chicken dishes, the wraps, they have amazing cakes and pies.&nbsp; The staff are great in person, not as good on the phone (though that&#039;s just a language/cultural issues in all honesty).

				When I am free on a weekday morning, I often go to Michael&#039;s to have their challah French toast with bacon.&nbsp; The best heart-attack special in Astoria IMO.&nbsp; The French toast is usually so saturated it&#039;s like custard.&nbsp; The other meals I&#039;ve had have nearly always been very good.&nbsp; To my mind it&#039;s the best diner in Astoria.<br /><br />If Moonstruck opens a block away I&#039;ll be going to Michael&#039;s even more.&nbsp; I&#039;d hate to see it killed by a chain business.<br /><br />Funny, I&#039;ve never seen you at Michael&#039;s, mcdirk.

				Ladywithpans - I&#039;ve seen you outside, but never inside Michael&#039;s - we must be two patrons passing in the night (or day).&nbsp; I generally eat there late, 8 or 9 p.m. onwards, and almost never on the weekends.

				Okay - so after posting my Michael&#039;s dislike post again, I gave it some thought and figured if there were some folks here that really liked the place I should give it another try.&nbsp; So my guy and I went last night.&nbsp; We both had a cup of Manhattan clam chowder and I had the corned beef panini and he had a burger.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have to say, the manhattan clam chowder was awesome!&nbsp; My guy is somewhat obessed with the soup, so we tried several in the neighborhood.&nbsp; He still prefers Sanford&#039;s, but I thought Michael&#039;s was the best.&nbsp; It was very slightly spicy and had tons of vegetables in it.&nbsp; Nice and chunky and awesome! <br /><br />My panini was awesome as well.&nbsp; The corned beef was perfectly cooked and almost no trace of fat. And I asked for well done fries .&nbsp; They didn&#039;t initially didn&#039;t come out well done but the waiter caught the mistake before I did and took them back for some well done ones.&nbsp; <br /><br />My guy&#039;s burger and fries were average but good. <br /><br /><br />So anyway, we&#039;ll be going back.&nbsp; And a plus, it&#039;s next to my favorite bodega!

				Walked by earlier tonight and Moonstruck is open for business.&nbsp; They not only took over Cafe Kolonaki but also Ethos next door (so much for whatever restaurant had been &quot;coming soon&quot; that had a sign on their door for years).&nbsp; I glanced at the menu, nothing that impressive and prices are roughly what I would expect to pay at a diner.

				Anyone know if they have any plans for the upstairs?<br /><br />The place is def trying to look nicer than most Moonstrucks I&#039;ve been to...inside reminds me of Sanford&#039;s.&nbsp; Probably going to be hardest on Michael&#039;s and Sanford&#039;s...only places with similar foods.

				Tried Moonstruck last night.<br /><br />The atmosphere is very nice.... but then you think &quot;hey I&#039;m in a Moonstruck Diner&quot;.&nbsp; The menu was typical to Moonstruck--regular diner food, though more expensive than I remember.&nbsp; Though the Steak and Seafood was under 25, the chicken dishes were still 15 and up.<br /><br />We were one of two tables there, and the waitress was not the most attentive, but very possesive.&nbsp; She didn&#039;t want the male bus boy to get our drinks and yelled at him in front of us, which was awkward. <br /><br />I ordered&nbsp; a Lettuce Wrap... which I had read meant it was a sandwich wrapped in lettuce, but it was just a regular wrap.&nbsp; With a ton of fries (which defeated the low carb wrap LOL).&nbsp; My partner ordered their Fundango Salad.&nbsp; The waitress proudly brought the food, and remarked about how BIG the food was.&nbsp; I asked for some Mayo (because oddly I dip my fries in mayo) and was given a thimbles amount for the 3/4 plate of fries.&nbsp; I tried their milk shakes, and they weren&#039;t too bad...not as good as bareburger, despite being the same price.&nbsp; <br /><br />My partner said his salad was good.. a lot of chicken on it, and it was well plated.&nbsp; He wasn&#039;t offered any additional coffee from the one cup that came.<br /><br />My biggest problem, is that we came in, took of our jackets, and then through the meal put them on because they had all the windows and doors open at 10pm at night.&nbsp; THe other table also joined us in putting on jackets.... What that meant to me was that the host didn&#039;t really care about the customers or observe them to notice they were cold.&nbsp; Not a good sign.&nbsp; <br /><br />With the place as big as it is, and only 2 tables filled... we&#039;ll see how long it lasts.<br /><br />3/5 stars thus far.

				I&#039;d say slightly more... closer to Stanfords and Michael&#039;s entree prices, not as high for seafood but higher for chicken... I was shocked to see chicken francais for 18 bucks.&nbsp;
