				Battlestar in nine months??? Can it be true, is it truly thus? I guess I&#039;ll have to get my fix with the last seasons&#039; dvds. The only saving grace has been an episode of Lice (global warming) South Park.&nbsp; :&nbsp; &nbsp;)

				I&#039;ve yet to catch up on this series beyond the first miniseries. I&#039;ve only seen a couple of episodes here and there, but my scheudle never seems to be regular enough for me to actually make time to catch it. It&#039;s agood thing I can get them on DVDs. I&#039;m tyring to get the missus interested as well and she&#039;s pretty good about checking out some geeky sci fi with me. Although it&#039;s not her usual cup-o-tea.&nbsp; :-D<br /><br />Last Thankgsiving we went on a total <em>Lost</em> spree; and now can&#039;t wait for season 3 to be over so we can rent it.

				I think i am already in withdrawl.<br />i was about 4 episodes behind and staged a DVR marathon just so that i could watch the new one (if i miss one i won&#039;t watch the new one until i am caught up) had i known i would have to wait untl next friggin year to get to season 4 i would have spread these bad boys out.<br /><br />According to the link provided they should have gotten a no go or the go ahead this month. I checked IMDb and it says it is scheduled for April &#039;08 http://imdb.com/title/tt0799862/ <br />there goes any chance for not suffering withdrawl anytime soon.<br /><br />I think i nodded off for a few minutes...ok i did because i missed the actual reading of Baltar&#039;s verdict (have no fear it was DVRed and i can hopefully stay up late enough to watch tonights reair) did they reveal ALL 5, or just the 4 that were shown coming together?<br /><br />edava: that South Park episode is hillarious. i keep saying &quot;my bebbe&quot; (b/c that&#039;s how it sounds when he says &quot;my baby&quot;, and for some reason i think that is funny as all hell)

I&#039;ve really enjoyed the political episodes (the union episode, for example), and the trial of Baltar, but I agree that it got a little soapy at various points. I found the end of this season somewhat unsatisfying in some ways, but it still makes me think after the end of each episode, so it&#039;s still good TV! I wish that they would have the courage to actually plan to end the series at some point, so that they can have a well-constructed story arc without needing to have tons of filler and twists.

				The four shown ARE cyclons.&nbsp; This was confirmed by the head writer for Battlestar.&nbsp; I still think Baltar is the fifth and probably big leader.&nbsp; As for Starbuck, my guess is she went through a wormhole.

				Starbuck is still Starbuck. Or I&#039;m gunning for those writers. <br /><br />Original series provides a hint - there&#039;s an ep. where Starbuck (but also Apollo and I think someone else) go to a &#039;ship of light&#039; and come back having seen Earth, able to lead the fleet to it. So I&#039;m hoping wormhole or something like that as an explanation. At any rate - not a cylon as we understand it. But then neither are the final five. <br /><br />And absolutely the cylons are MUCH more than we&#039;ve been led to believe. <br /><br />I just thought the All Along the Watchtower bit was totally cheesy and out of character for the series. But it has been a patchy season.

				The ONLY argument that can be made for &#039;all along the watchtower&#039; is that it has started us thinking about Earth. What is it going to be like when they find it? What year is it on Earth? Will we recognise it? after all, why do colonists wear clothes like ours? What&#039;s up with that? (apart from easy wardrobe stuff!) they look heaps like our modern society, and yet the &#039;all of this has happened before and will happen again&#039; stuff could suggest some antiquity. The greek/roman pantheon is curious too. And Baltar&#039;s storyline has suggested &#039;Jesus&#039; to me more than once. Now he&#039;s got his own cult of women rushing him away to his new life.. Meanwhile, I believe the four who heard the music heard it because they have some link to the thirteenth tribe. I&#039;m not sure if this means they are cylons or not. I&#039;m kind of curious about the whole bulletheads into androids thing. If the bulletheads are incapable of telling them apart and have no real consciousness, but they were first - how did the new cylons come about? Who or what made them? Or were they made at all?? What if they&#039;re the thirteenth tribe? Or clones of them. Or some group of them sent back to watch, who had a schism between 5 and 6 (isn&#039;t it odd that now there are 12 cylons, and not 13? 13 tribes, is there a missing cylon?) about how to do so.. or the 6 discovered rebirthing and the others didn&#039;t.. <br /><br />Starbuck may well be the first human-cylon hybrid, not Hera. Her mother was in the first war. Her mother insisted on her &#039;destiny&#039; from day one. Her father is completely absent. Her aptitude may be no normal human thing. Or perhaps, if my theory about android-cylons is correct, Starbuck is in fact a thirteenth tribe member as well. The signposts to Earth are awfully handy, Tyrrel&#039;s already shown his ability to recognise them (eye of jupiter), and the beginning of the music could have been in the maelstrom episode, which sent Starbuck into the mandala. <br /><br />Anyway. We have a year to make s___ up. Woo!

Start with the miniseries (a 3-hour pilot), then there are Season 1, Season 2, and Season 2.5. I imagine Season 3 will be out this Fall. I also believe you can view the show on iTunes for $2/episode.

				I think Lee Adama&#039;s defense of Baltar is genuinely because he believes in the legal process, which would be consistent for his character.&nbsp; He&#039;s done similar things in the past, e.g.&nbsp; in Seasn II standing up to Tigh and his father when they declared martial law and deposed President Roslin, and getting thrown in the brig for his efforts.&nbsp; Every so often he makes dramatic speaches about how he took an oath to uphold certain principles and blah blah.&nbsp; These are great occasions for the kind of campy scenery chewing that, crossed with the serious ethical issues being grappled with, make me like the show so much.
