				A French friend of mine is visiting next week for a couple of days, just wondering if there&#39;s anyplace in town where we&#39;d find other Francophones (she doesn&#39;t speak much English.)<br /><br />I know the owners of 718 are French, but it&#39;s a little expensive there. Any other places?<br /><br />Not that it really matters, so far she&#39;s just thrilled the outdoor cafes turn a blind eye to the smoking&nbsp; :roll:

				I&#39;ve already threatened to take her to some French bistros. I mean, she eats nothing but fast food at home so it would actually be a new experience for her! :D<br /><br />There&#39;s a couple of bistros around, it seems, one on upper Ditmars from what I&#39;ve read here; one in LIC (Tournesol.) Sans Souci would be the closest, thanks!<br /><br />Keep &#39;em coming if there&#39;s any more....

				718 has a lunch menu that isn&#39;t too expensive.&nbsp; &nbsp;Their signature burger is one of the best burgers I have ever had, and with the lunch menu it only cost $9 (and it included fries and a salad).&nbsp; Sure, its a little pricey for a burger, but it is soooooooooo good.

				Tournesol (http://www.tournesolnyc.com) is fantastic. I was there for dinner the other day, the second time I&#39;ve been there, and was impressed with everything. They have very elegant plating, but charge the &quot;Queens discount&quot; compared to Manhattan prices. Entrees were $15-20, with specials $20-25. Oh, and the waitstaff is all French, I think.<br />

				Tournesol is very French - I can go there and not speak a single word of English the entire meal.&nbsp; It&#39;s great - and the food is, too.

				I&#39;m sure your friend has already come and gone, but I have to sing the praises of Le sans Souci.&nbsp; <br /><br />Let me preface this by saying that I went to a french school from age 2-12, and have been mistaken for French most of my life as soon as I start speaking it.&nbsp; I&#39;ve lived in a small town in southern france for five summers, and feel more comfortable in France than in many states of the union (like Texas).<br /><br />When I walked into Le Sans Souci, I was greated by a hansome young man who spoke to me in French.&nbsp; We had a long discussion about music as I ate some of the best food I&#39;d had since moving to New York.&nbsp; It was a croque Monsieur, and it tasted just like the ones I&#39;d had at the local diner in Villeneuve-sur-Lot.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was invited to come back and hangout, and it&#39;s been my favorite hangout ever since.&nbsp; It&#39;s a wonderful place to just go and have a glass of wine, and enjoy the French atmosphere.&nbsp; The garden in the back is lovely, and hopefully they&#39;ll be starting up French film night again soon.<br /><br />Chef Eric is a genius, making incredible food with the perfect balance of fresh ingrediants.&nbsp; I recomend getting the Prix Fixe, which is always they&#39;re specials for the day.&nbsp; <br /><br />Le Sans Souci rocks!&nbsp; Try it out.<br /><br />

Most people there seem to prefer other options. I like Lil Bistro &#39;33, on 36th Ave., for example. Neither go out of their way to be Francophone in the way that La Sans Souci or Tournesol do, though...
