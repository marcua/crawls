				Haha! I actually know what happened with the dog, which is so weird as I live nowhere near this intersection!&nbsp; I went to get my hair done by the guy who lives right there on the top floor, and I arrived right after the situation had resolved.&nbsp; He said hundreds of people were outside his window, so he looked along the ledge, and his neighbor&#039;s dog was right there.&nbsp; He tried to get the dog to come over but it wouldn&#039;t.&nbsp; The fire department finally came and got it down, but it then bit them and started running down the street, prompting the mass of people to begin chasing after it.&nbsp; By the time I got to his apartment, it had been returned to its owner, and the firemen were still around.&nbsp; Strange but funny&nbsp; :lol:

				I&#039;m not sure, but I think it was something like the size of a pomeranian... and it was on the outside ledge, so it wasn&#039;t too small a surface.
