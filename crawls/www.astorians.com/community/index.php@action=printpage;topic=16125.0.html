				Am I the only guy who gets crushes on random folks around the neighborhood? I have a few:<br /><br />-Some lady who gets on the same train as me every morning, and gets off at the same stop as me. We smile at each other consciously. And then I cut her off all the time on the way up the stairs because she walks too slow during morning rush hour.<br /><br />-One of the girls at the McDonald&#039;s drive-thru on Broadway. She&#039;s beautiful.<br /><br />-The Asian lady at my favorite bodega. But I feel guilty, because her husband is a real cool dude.

				There was one guy on the N train towards Ditmars a couple years back that caught my eye. He reminded me of my boyfriend in that sort of quiet, naturally mean looking dude kind of way. Anyway, so he was sitting across from me, and there was this group of females standing in the middle of the train and gabbing at the top of their lungs. Really loud and shrill voices, and the subject matter was annoying too, whatever it was. This guy was silent but had a really peeved look on his face as he stared straight ahead with his arms crossed. The girls got off at 30th Avenue or something, and as soon as they left, the guy said to himself, &quot;Jesus Christ.&quot; It made me smile.

				Maybe not an actual &quot;crush,&quot; but certainly crush-worthy: The guy working the customer service counter @ Key Food last week, helping me rent a rug cleaning machine.<br /><br />This became comical when the FDNY grocery shopping crew showed up at the counter, in uniform as they often do- it was like Hunk-O-Rama&nbsp; :lol:&nbsp; :mrgreen:&nbsp; :-D
