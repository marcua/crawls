				Got royally ripped off with my last car by some place that AAA recommended. &nbsp;I drive a no-frills 1987 Pontiac 6000, it could use a nice tune up once or twice a year to keep things running smoothly :)

				I had two good experinces with Hi-Tek on 21st St. and 38th St:<br /><br />My first was when I had a headlight out and my hood wouldn&#39;t close properly - at 2AM. They were able to locate a headlight for my car (&#39;99 corolla) and adjusted the hood latch so that it would close properly... both have worked fine since.<br /><br />The second experience I had with them came after I brought my car to Pep Boys across the street for an inspection. ( I only brought it there because it was early in the morning and they were the only place that I could get on the phone) Pep Boys said my car failed the emissions part of inspection and that in order for it to pass it would cost around $400. They said I hadn&#39;t changed my oil often enough, I had problems with my spark plugs, and some other crap I forget...<br />&nbsp;I told them not to touch anything. I then went across the street to Hi-Tek where I showed the guy behind the desk my failed inspection from Pep Boys and asked him how much he thought it would cost to have my car pass inspection. He said that Pep Boys was using the wrong machine to check the emissions, and that my car should pass no problem. <br />I told the guys at Pep Boys what the guy at Hi-Tek said, and they got all defensive - saying that they had permission to use the old maching to check emissions.. but that if my car passed the emissions test they would give me back the money they had charged for their inspection. <br /><br />Well, my car passed the inspection just fine at Hi-Tek and I got my money back from Pep Boys. It took Pep Boys 2 hours to do the inspection where Hi-Tek took 5 minutes. I&#39;m never going back to Pep Boys... Incedentially - as I was leaving I heard them quoting an estimate on repairing a guys brakes: $400. <br /><br />Well, Hi-Tek has done well by me twice. I&#39;m planning on bringing my car back there next time I need service.

				After an assortment of disasterous experiences at various mechanics in Astoria (the worst of which was when one place backed a tow truck into our &#39;96 Subaru after inspecting it), we&#39;ve been pleased with<br /><br />Richard Ley&#39;s Automotive and Repair Service Inc.<br />19-73 Steinway St.<br />718-728-9713
