				My Ma&#039;s husband is retiring from the police department and as a retirement present my brothers and I want to send the both of them on a trip to Europe.&nbsp; We were figuring on flying them into London, stay there for a few days, then a few days in Paris and then finally for a week in a villa in the French Riviera.<br /><br />As this is a little more complicated than the Star Trek DVD collection I got him for X-mas, I wanted to feel out for some advice if anyone has some.&nbsp; Neither have ever been out of the country, both are active (although he is considerably younger than she is) and both certainly don&#039;t mind being straight out touristy at times.&nbsp; <br /><br />1.&nbsp; When going from London to Paris, fly them or have them take the chunnel train?<br />2.&nbsp; Same, when from Paris to South of France, fly them or have them take the bullet train?<br />3.&nbsp; If taking the train down from Paris, considering having them stay in a some small town overnight.&nbsp; Any suggestions of a cute little town on the way from Paris to the Riviera?<br />4.&nbsp; Suggestions on what town in the Riviera is good to stay in?<br />5.&nbsp; Suggestions on where in Paris is good to stay?&nbsp; <br />6.&nbsp; Any respectable realtors/websites of good standing to help in the renting of the villa?<br />7.&nbsp; Any tips, pitfalls to look out for?<br />8.&nbsp; Any other recommendations on things to do, day-trips, places to eat, et cetera.<br />9.&nbsp; Finally, any suggestions on how to present it to them as a present.&nbsp; Naturally, we can&#039;t give the tickets and stuff until we confirm with them when they can travel, but it would be nice do something at the retirement party to signify the present.&nbsp; One part of it I figure would be to get them the lonely planet travel guides to the places they&#039;ll be going to, but I&#039;d like to put that extra &#039;umf&#039; in it.<br /><br />Thanks, I do appreciate any advice that can help me get this off the ground.

				Have them take the chunnel. It&#039;s just really cool, smooth ride. Goes city center to city center. Flying is faster but it leaves you on the outskirts of the city.

				Trains work well in France, and I&#039;d recommend the TGV (bullet train) over flying to head south from Paris.&nbsp; Thing is, though, that the TGV doesn&#039;t really stop in small towns, nor does it take long enough to really need to do so.&nbsp; It really is fast.&nbsp; &nbsp;8-)<br /><br />As for places to go in the south of France, there are several options:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Classic Riviera/Nice region.&nbsp; If this is your choice, Nice is a must-see, but I think my favourite smaller town is Saint-RaphaÃ«l, a bit west of Nice.&nbsp; The whole region is choked with tourists as the weather gets warmer.&nbsp; To the west, not really part of the Riviera but not too far away, is Marseilles, which has a totally different feel.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; North and west of there is the heart of Provence and surrounding region, which is lovely, with charming towns with a lot of Roman history - and ruins (sometimes still in use).&nbsp; Aix en Provence, Arles, Avignon (which is a bit farther west), Orange - and my favourite, Vaison la Romaine, are all within the area I&#039;m talking about.&nbsp; <br /><br />3.&nbsp; The western part of the Mediterranean coast, basically starting west of Marseilles and extending to the Spanish border.&nbsp; This region is called Languedoc-Roussillon.&nbsp; Here, my favourite city is Perpignan, which is somewhat off the beaten tourist path (but which still has a lot of tourism).&nbsp; It is quite close to Spain and in the heart of the French part of Catalunya, so it has a somewhat different feel to the Riviera region, but I love it.&nbsp; A really interesting and beautiful ancient fortified city in this area is Carcassone, which I think is a World Heritage Site.<br /><br />I&#039;ve lived in France and travelled extensively all over the country, so I&#039;d be happy to give further detail/impressions on any of the above or other points.&nbsp; Feel free to PM me as well if you want to discuss things in more detail.

They have very strict weight requirements for luggage and most people end up having to pay extra baggage fees. <br /><br />
