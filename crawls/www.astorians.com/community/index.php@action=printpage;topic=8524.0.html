				I was there last night.&nbsp; It&#039;s a nice wine bar with a small menu of specialty meats and cheeses and tasty paninis.<br /><br />The bar itself is comfortable.&nbsp; The wine list has selections from Australia, Chile, Italy, France and the US.&nbsp; maybe more, I forget.&nbsp; The quality of the wine is midrange.&nbsp; Nothing spectacular.<br /><br />The patrons seemed diverse enough, although there was a Serbia heavy representation there.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think this wine bar is meant to be mono-ethnic.<br /><br />Overall, good spot.&nbsp; I recommend to try it.

				I think I heard about this bar from Darren at Il Bambino months ago.&nbsp; I had almost forgotten about it!&nbsp; Sounds worth checking out, definitely.

				I was there the other night... It&#039;s called Rest-au-Rant... It&#039;s a great little beer and wine bar...low lit, candles, that kind of vibe... The crowd was diverse... They had a great selection of beers... Belgium, French, German, Czech... and a pretty good wine list... reasonably priced too... $5 for a beer... Right now they serve tasty little paninis and dips and spreads and the like, but they said they&#039;ll be expanding the menu soon... they&#039;ve only been open a couple of weeks.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend checking it out...

				There&#039;s a new place that just opened at <strong>30th St. and 35th Ave</strong>., <strong><span class="bbc_u">Rest-au-Rant.</span></strong><br /><br />It used to be &quot;Cafe Blue Light&quot;, but is now under new ownership and is completely renovated. It&#039;s a wine and beer bar, they have coffee and food. <span class="bbc_u">THEY HAVE TAPS! With good beer available!</span>(Guinness, Blue Point, Stella, and others). The wine is terrific. Pints are generally $5.<br /><br />And... they have NO T.V.&#039;s!! Finally, a bar has the right state of mind to open without wanting a sports crowd.<br /><br />They play decent music, not too loud. It&#039;s all dark wood with a dark wood beam ceiling.<strong> Great feel.</strong> <br /><br />They have roughly the same hours as &quot;Locale&quot;, they open at 4pm during the weekdays, and 11am/noon on the weekends.<br /><br />Check it out if you&#039;re in need of a new place to try.

				Yeah, I was there the other night... It&#039;s a nice place... Great selection of beers, both in the bottle and on tap... Delerium Tremens, Franziskaner, Stone IPA, Stella Artois, Kona Hawaiian Lager, and I saw Scrumpy&#039;s Cider... Great vibe... diverse crowd... great wine list... wines from all over the world...<br /><br />would definitely recommend checking it out...

				Not sure about the Bloody Marys<br /><br />I&#039;ll find out<br /><br />I really hope they pick up traffic soon<br /><br />I&#039;d hate to see it go<br /><br />I believe the new owners use to be managers at Brick Cafe<br /><br />Really nice and working hard to make the place great

				I finally checked this place out.&nbsp; It&#039;s cute with a nice vibe.&nbsp; I had a cocktail which was quite good.&nbsp; However, I made the mistake of thinking I could get away with having dinner there.&nbsp; Unless you are a very light eater this place won&#039;t due.&nbsp; They did have a list of panninnis but none of them interested me.&nbsp; My friend and I settled on a platter of cheeses and salami and the hummus with pita.&nbsp; Those items were quite good.&nbsp; We went elsewhere for dinner with a lovely little buzz.
