				Hi, All:<br /><br />I&#039;m new to the board and have enjoyed reading so many of your posts. They are very informative and useful. I will be coming to Astoria to stay with a friend May 23-27th. She is also from Memphis and she LOVES the area.&nbsp; Hopefully, I will be able to secure my own apt during that time, in hopes of moving in July. I&#039;m a 30yo psychologist, and I will likely be working in both Manhattan and Queens. <br /><br />I was wondering if you guys ever get together? Have many of you met? If not, I&#039;d love to join a group of you one evening for drinks or coffee while I&#039;m in town, maybe the 23rd or 24th?&nbsp; When I move, I&#039;ll only know one person, and I&#039;d love to expand on that as soon as possible!

				Yep, we do - Check out the Community Groups, Activities, Clubs section (http://www.astorians.com/index.php?board=3.0) - there are a handful of regular get-togethers (the bookswap and knitting groups come to mind), and occasionally we get together to eat and/or drink. When I moved here, I had friends in New York, but none in Astoria. I moved here because I fell in love with the neighborhood the first time I came here. I&#039;ve met a bunch of people/friends from the neighborhood through this site, which was really nice.<br /><br />I know its a bit early, but welcome to the neighborhood! :)

				Here are two suggestions:&nbsp; Do either sound good to you guys?<br /><br />Irish Rover, on 28th Ave at 38th St : Every 3rd drink is on the house, I hear&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br />Beer Garden (24th Ave &amp; 29th St): has a patio and serves food...but I hear terrible things about lines...<br /><br />LMK if you have another suggestion/preference and what time would be most convenient for you!

				You can&#039;t live in Astoria and not go to the Beer Garden, so I definitely have to vote for that one.&nbsp; And the lines can be avoided by going early.&nbsp; But I haven&#039;t tried Irish Rover yet either.

				Ha, you haven&#039;t been to the Beer Garden, I forgot.&nbsp; There is no calling ahead for a table :)&nbsp; You just show up, and pick amongst the available picnic tables, it&#039;s first come first serve.&nbsp; And another tip, don&#039;t come starving.&nbsp; Food takes awhile as there is only one waitress for the whole place.&nbsp; But it&#039;s not really about the food at the beer garden.&nbsp; It&#039;s about getting together with friends and relaxing (with a few pitchers usually).

				You know, normally, I&#039;d be there a good long time (like forever), but Lost will be having it&#039;s 2 hour finale that night, so I may have to be cutting out to make it home by 9pm, so I&#039;ll probably be there til 8:40.&nbsp; I&#039;d hate to miss the finale and have to hear about it before I actually see my VHS of it.&nbsp; Too bad Beer Garden can&#039;t put TV screens all over like they did for the World Cup!&nbsp; That would be awesome!!

				Hey guys, I have some bad news.&nbsp; Only a month into the job, the entire staff of a newly formed company was laid off, including me.&nbsp; Those are the breaks in this crazy business I&#039;m in, but it still throws you for a loop.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been invited to a Lostie party by a few good friends, and I&#039;ve decided to go, but it&#039;s in Park Slope.&nbsp; So sorry I won&#039;t be able to meet most of you!&nbsp; If any of you are around before 7pm and want to get there early, I&#039;d be up for a drink, say 6pm?<br /><br />If not, enjoy yourselves and have a drink for me!&nbsp; I&#039;m sure could use quite a few right now!!

				That&#039;s awful, Daisy&nbsp; :?&nbsp; :-(&nbsp; <br /><br />I know it&#039;s early and you&#039;re probably still dealing with what&#039;s going on, but if you need any leads as far as agencies go, PM me.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what kind of work you are looking for or what you want to do, but I relied on temp work for four years to pay bills and live in NYC while I looked for the right job and in the process, developed some contacts.&nbsp; Feel free to contact me and again, sorry to hear about your job.

				Oh Daisy, that really sucks! We are together in the artsy job-hunting boat now. We should do some tag-team job hunting, heh.<br /><br />Anyway, since I&#039;ve been spending my days scouring the internet, I&#039;ll totally be around at 6 if you still want to go. I&#039;m gonna PM you my number, check your mailbox!

				Thanks guys!&nbsp; Networking is par the course in my field, and it&#039;s such a blessing that the majority of people I work with are such talented, friendly, wonderful people.&nbsp; &nbsp;I haven&#039;t quite decided what I want to do yet, but I may take some time to recup and enjoy a bit of summer, before rushing on back into something.&nbsp; I will definitely keep your tip about the agencies in the back of my mind, Astoria Luv.&nbsp; Thanks so much!!&nbsp; <br /><br />Alison, I&#039;ll give you a call.&nbsp; Sounds like a plan!&nbsp; See you there at 6pm!
