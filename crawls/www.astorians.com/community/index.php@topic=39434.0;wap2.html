			Hi! I&#039;m a professional photographer, and would love to take your pictures. <br />If you check out my site, and other social media pages, you will see what types of photos I do. Im also open to ideas as well. <br />Usually I charge $50 for a sitting, and give all of the photos on a cd to you, or via email. We can talk about pricing, and ideas. Please feel free to contact me at any time. <br /><br /><br /><br />Check out my website, and other social media:<br />http://www.micheleangelinaphoto.com/<br />https://www.facebook.com/MicheleAngelinaPhotography<br />https://www.instagram.com/michele_angelina_photography<br /><br />Michele
