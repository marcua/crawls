				Here&#039;s the ride we did today: http://www.mapmyride.com/ride/united-states/ny/astoria/683137651787 <br /><br />Crossed the Triboro/Williamsburg/Brooklyn/Manhattan/Pulaski bridges, plus the pedestrian bridge from Randall&#039;s Island to NYC.......not the Queensboro though!<br /><br />But I often ride over it whenever I&#039;m going into the city; more so when I was commuting there.

				There&#039;s already a Queens division of Transportation Alternatives; I think an Astorian bike group would be terrific. I&#039;d be happy to get some beginners out there. The biggest problem I find is that people just aren&#039;t motivated to practice on their own and then have no confidence to join fun group rides, even the easy ones.<br /><br />I&#039;m already involved with a Long Island-based group of mountain bikers. This was just an unexpected day of biking when and the BF were going to do just a couple of miles, but kept on going!<br /><br />Next Saturday, Park Avenue is closed to car traffic from 7am to 1pm, between 72nd Street and the Brooklyn Bridge. Not a bad way to get acclimated. That&#039;s all we were going to do originally.<br />

				I totally agree with you however people with lack of motivation can change if they want to be apart of<br />an active group. The next steps would be to attract more local riders to our goal

				Anyways summer Saturdays is not the end of biking in the city, I like to hear from local riders if they would be willing<br />start a bike group. I used to belong to a similar group when I live in Williamsburg Brooklyn, its fun to tour the city and also<br />venture out of the city in a nice group.

				There have been a few bike tours done through T.A., sometimes I see them down by the water on Shore Blvd.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t mind leading a beginner trip of some kind, for an hour or so to get people used to the idea of city biking. Say, from the park over one of the bridges. Or a mountain bike skills clinic- comes in handy for city riding.<br /><br />

				I wish I could bike to work but 1) there are no locker rooms / showers, so I&#039;d stink all day 2) the building won&#039;t let bikes in and 3) I won&#039;t lock my bike anywhere that I can&#039;t see it for more than a few minutes, regardless of the fact that I have one of those NYC Kryptonite locks.&nbsp;

				Kryptonite lock don&#039;t mean anything, a few weeks ago I went to staples to shop. On my way out, my lock was snipped but not completely, a man in a park<br />car made some noise and the thief left without completing the job. I am glad the man in the park yelled at the thief or else today I would have no bike :mrgreen:
