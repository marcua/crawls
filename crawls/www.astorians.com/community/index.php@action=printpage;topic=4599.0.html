				Where do you guys recommend I should go for a butcher shop?<br /><br />Ive lived here for 4 years and just now learning more about the neighborhood (go figure). <br /><br />Im sick of buying anorexic looking chicken drumsticks at C-Town on Broadway, so I want to buy some normal sized poultry..... :|

				Akropolis on 31st and 31st is very good, and since you go to CTown, you should just walk across the street to the Broadway butcher who is really good too. <br /><br />Honestly, I haven&#39;t been to any bad butchers in Astoria. Astorians really like their meat.&nbsp; :-P

				I just noticed some D&#039;Artagnan chicken, which I think (?) is organic, in the window of the International Meat Market on 30th Ave between 36th and 37th streets.&nbsp; D&#039;Artagnan&#039;s some expensive stuff all right, but it is delish.&nbsp; Might be an option and even an indicator that they have more options inside.&nbsp; I&#039;ve still been striking out at other places in my nabe and just buying chicken at Whole Foods or Garden of Eden when I need it.

				I would say from my experience, the butcher shops I prefer in Astoria are the International Meat Market, on 30th Avenue between 35th and 36th Streets; Akropolis, which is right off the corner on 30th Avenue and 31st Street; as well as the meat market within Berry Fresh Farms Supermarket in the Ditmars Shopping Center, Ditmars Blvd. and 44th Street.&nbsp; <br /><br />Both International and Akropolis are very clean, especially International, and I&#039;ve never had an issue with meats I&#039;ve purchased from there.&nbsp; International seems to be especially busy around the holidays...Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter, etc., which probably bodes well as to its reputation in the community.<br /><br />The meat market inside Berry Fresh Farms was a bit of a surprise, but it has a great selection of meats, and Joe, the friendly Italian butcher, is especially helpful.&nbsp; They have a larger meat selection than any supermarket I&#039;ve ever seen, more diverse than Western Beef, and cleaner too.

				I like K&amp;M for the sawdust/old time flavor on B&#039;way b/w 37/28, but I LOVE International on 30th ave b/w 36th/37th. They really know what they&#039;re doing, carry organic and free range chickens, great quality beef (though it&#039;s not grass fed, I keep asking for it). If you buy something you&#039;re unfamiliar with they can give you cooking pointers and will cut apart, debone, butterfly the piece for you... Never debone though. FLAVOR is in the bone. They laugh at the people that get it deboned and once it&#039;s requested I ask if I can have their bones for soup! Suckers...

I go there almost every week and have had nothing but great experiences. The guys couldn&#039;t be nicer, the meats are very good, and the prices can&#039;t be beat. Their souvlakis are the best deal in the city and are so tender and delicious (lamb and pork are my favorites). Sure, they don&#039;t have the quality and service of Lobell&#039;s, but for a neighborhood butcher I think they&#039;re more than solid.

He said, &quot;I&#039;ve got some others I can show you.&quot; Just once. I never forgot how willing they are to make sure you are pleased with your order. I call them and 2 hours later pick up my order, packaged the way I like it. Sometimes I ask for freezer packaging and they do such a great job I just take it home and throw it in the freezer. I&#039;ve said this before in other threads, but it might bear repeating here. I also do some meat shopping at Costco. On certain items, their quality at their price simply cannot be beat.

				seconds, thirds on International and Marino&#039;s for fish. Walked into the butcher place on Broadway (35th? st) to check it out for the 1st time and felt grossed out. From the way they display the meat, the sawdust on the floor-makes me think they carry it from the front door and the dust is for blood drippings, I have no reason for returning-don&#039;t care how cheap it is.

				Had a terrific experience at International Meats the day before Thanksgiving.&nbsp; While it was really crowded and busy, the guys behind the counter made me feel like I mattered as a customer, and were attentive and profesional.&nbsp; Trimmed the chicken breasts I bought, and wrapped them up well.&nbsp; I used them for tortilla soup on Thanksgiving and the chicken was delish.&nbsp; Would happily go back again.&nbsp; Highly recommended.
