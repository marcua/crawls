				Anyone have problems with their car radio? It started write after the 6/12 DTV switchover. Satellite radio is fine but the FM stations have static and come in and out.

				I haven&#039;t noticed anything different about radio reception and there&#039;s really no reason why the DTV switchover should interfere in any way with radio.&nbsp; If anything, because the analog stations have mostly been switched off, there&#039;s less RF &quot;noise&quot; which should reduce interference.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, this is usually the time of year that two atmospheric phenomenoa, &quot;e-skip&quot; and &quot;tropospheric ducting&quot; come into play, bringing in FM signals from a large distance which normally would not be heard in the area.&nbsp; Even so, this would really be noticeable on frequencies not occupied by NYC radio stations.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, which stations are you trying to receive?

				Really no reason any of those stations should be having problems.<br /><br />The only other thing I can think of is that due to the work of removing the analog TV transmitters from the top of the Empire State Building, radio stations may be powering down at times or broadcasting from backup transmitter sites elsewhere in the region.&nbsp; This wouldn&#039;t be continuous, however, but during those times, there&#039;s a good chance that the signals of the FM stations will be noticeably weaker.
