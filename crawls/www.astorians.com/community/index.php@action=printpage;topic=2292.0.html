				A couple months ago we came across the Green Power option listed on ConEd&#039;s Website.&nbsp; You can even enroll online.&nbsp; It does cost a few bucks more a month but at least it is 100% renewable energy.&nbsp; They use a combination of wind power and hydro-electric.&nbsp; Of course I would prefer 100% wind power because of the environmental effects of dams but at least it doesn&#039;t use any fossil fuels.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you sign up, you get a 25.00$ rebate on your energy bill plus no NYS sales tax on your bill.&nbsp; <br /><br />It seems like a good alternative that everyone can do to decrease use of fossil fuels.&nbsp; If anyone figures out how to switch to 100% wind and solar power please let me know.&nbsp; <br /><br />Check out the option at www.NewWindEnergy.com/nyc

				I just signed up for 100% Wind Energy.&nbsp; Thanks a bunch Mark!<br /><br /><strong>So for less than $100/year, I save the earth.&nbsp; </strong> <br /><br /><br />Look How It Works:<br /><br />- $25 Refund right off the bat<br />- No NYS Sales Tax (Exemption) - thats 4.00% off your bill<br />- 100% Wind is $0.19000/kwh and the rate last month was $0.198635/kwh**<br /><br /><br />** I did note some sort of Adjust. Factor Credit on my bill of $0.034157/kwh but I&#039;m not sure what it is or when it will go way.<br />So lets do the calculation to see how much more it will cost using a conservative assumption that includes the credit..<br /><br />With the credit cost/kwh = $0.164478<br />100% Wind Green Energy = $0.1900/kwh<br />Difference=$0.025522 or 15.55% <br />Less NYS Sales Tax Exemption of - 4.00%<br /><br />Total Bill Increase w/ Green Power - <strong>11.55%</strong><br /><br />That Translates into an additional $7.83 based on my last months bill (11.55% x $67.82 elec)<br /><br /><br /><br />Wow.&nbsp; I feel good. 8-)<br /><br /><br />www.NewWindEnergy.com/nyc

				Those numbers don&#39;t look right to me. I think the costs you might be looking at are the supply + delivery costs. You need to be looking at the supply costs only, delivery costs will be in addition to the supply.<br /><br />When you get a quote for power (even through ConEd Solutions Green Power) from any ESCO they are only quoting you the supply costs. ConEd then adds the delivery costs to that when you get your bill.<br /><br />So, to compare apples with apples you need to get the supply cost for the green power, and supply costs for the non-green for the same month&#39;s period.<br /><br />I&#39;m VERY interested in finding out more about this. If the cost is close I&#39;ll switch too.

				Yeah, so you compare that &quot;This bill includes an electric supply cost of 13.9¢ per KWHR&quot; with whatever the rate quoted you by the ESCO (wind people, or whatever).<br /><br />The $0.20/KWh is INCLUSIVE of the charges that ConEd passes along to you (some $0.06/KWh) for the upkeep of the electric lines etc. You are being charged that no matter if you get wind or regular power.

				Keep in mind the billing cycle for each person is slightly different, also, since the cycle is different and your energy provider computes the charge of electricity on a daily basis and then averages that number, that everyone&#39;s cost will be slightly different depending on their billing cycle. However in the long run it should even out.

				Can anyone update their experiences a year after switching?<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking to go Wind month to month but would like to hear from people who have made the switch.<br /><br />They offer month to month, green for $.01 more per KWH and wind for $.025 more per KWH than their standard costs.&nbsp; My electric bill has generally been about $50/mo, but with the AC last month my newest bill was $84.&nbsp; So even the Wind won&#039;t affect it that much.&nbsp; I like that there is no sales tax, my current bill would be about $8 higher for wind but current taxes were 3.23.<br /><br />FYI (probably unnecessary): my electric rates were 21.871 cents for first 266.7 KWH and 22.5813 cents after that.&nbsp; There was an adjustment of .7210 cents.<br /><br />Also, the $25 credit mentioned previously (from 2006) is no longer valid I believe.&nbsp; Does anyone know if I&#039;d be eligible for the 7% power move credit?&nbsp; If so, I wish I did this before summer so I could get the 7% on my highest bills!<br /><br />Let me know!

				EDIT---<br />Ignore the part about saving 7% on my highest bills, it really wouldn&#039;t make that big of a difference anyways.<br /><br />What I am thinking though is that at 314KWH an extra 1 cent to go green would be $3.14 however I would save $3.23 in taxes.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have any old electric bills around but I figure that when my usage is lower I should still about break even.<br /><br />100% wind on the other hand, would always cost a little more (about $5 this month after tax break).&nbsp; <br /><br />Financially, the decision should be to go green, not 100% wind.&nbsp; But how great is the benefit of 100% wind over 35% wind?&nbsp; At my usage level (LOW)&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure there is much benefit of 100% wind over 35% wind but would like to hear someone more knowledgeable about this chime in.

				I&#039;m on wind power and have been for... 18 months or so?<br /><br />There are 2 charges -- cost and supply.&nbsp; Supply cost is cost per kwh for wind (locked in rate) and service charge fluctuates (I think) and is charged by coned for delivery.<br /><br />Bill for 7/2/07:<br /><br />used 169 KWH (over 31 days) -- $0.068580/per KWH ($11.59) &lt;&lt; service<br />used 169 KWH (over 31 days) -- $0.185000/per KWH ($31.27) &lt;&lt; supply cost for wind<br /><br />It&#039;s a little confusing, I guess.<br />&nbsp;

				Thanks Jayme.<br /><br />I&#039;m on regular &quot;dirty&quot; (well, some clean, but mostly dirty) energy from MX Energy.<br /><br />During the same period I paid:<br /><br />Bill for 7/2/07:<br /><br />$0.068138/per KWH &lt;&lt; service (basically the same)<br />$0.158000/per KWH &lt;&lt; supply cost<br /><br />Looks like it&#039;s $0.027 more for wind (per KWh) compared to my current provider. A price difference of about 17%. I did lock in my energy price for 1 year a while ago though so I&#039;m sure that&#039;s why I&#039;m seeing a slight cost advantage. Some months I think my rate is a little higher than the variable rate, some months lower.

				Bit the bullet and signed up with ConEd Solutions today.&nbsp; Well, I started processing through PowerMove, they need to get back to me still but I&#039;m on my way!&nbsp; I&#039;m going to do variable rate hydro/wind.&nbsp; 1 cent more per KWH less 4% sales tax would have broke even on my last bill.&nbsp; I&#039;m not expecting any real change.<br /><br />I really think a better job needs to be done by the power companies to promote green energy.&nbsp; I was surprised to see how little of an impact it will have on my bill, yet how good it is for the environment.&nbsp; I read somewhere that an average household using 520 kwh/mo of green energy instead of coal would reduce carbon output equivalent to a car driving 3,000 miles.&nbsp; That&#039;s pretty significant!<br /><br />I&#039;ve talked a couple friends into getting green energy now too which is always a good thing.&nbsp; So, if you&#039;ve made the switch TELL SOMEONE YOU KNOW!&nbsp; Let them know how easy it is and how little change they will see in their bill.&nbsp; &quot;Green Energy: Light on the environment AND light on your wallet!&quot;
