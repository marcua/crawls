				I have a friend of mine arriving to visit us from Sweden.&nbsp; It is their first time in the US &amp; to NY.&nbsp; They have a 3 y/o &amp;&nbsp; 5 y/o girls.<br />They will only be in NY for four days.&nbsp; What do you think is at the top of the list of things we should make sure to do with them?

				In no particular order, here are some of my kids&#039; faves:<br /><br />Central Park (the Heckscher playground, followed by a ride on the carousel, and sometimes the CP zoo)<br /><br />Staten Island Ferry (best free entertainment in the city)<br /><br />NY Hall of Science (but bring your own food!)<br /><br />Queens Zoo petting zoo and the Playground for All Children which is in the same corner of the park<br /><br />Museum of Natural History (don&#039;t miss the whale room and the dinosaurs)<br /><br />If you have a car and don&#039;t mind the drive, the Brooklyn Children&#039;s Museum is a pretty great place for kids too<br /><br />I would strongly recommend against the Children&#039;s Museum of Manhattan - that place is a nightmare!!

				Go to the Empire State Bldg or Top of the Rock to get a view of the City<br /><br />Statue of Liberty...come on everyone should go there once.<br /><br />If they like military stuff...go to the Intrepid Museum<br /><br />Kaufman Studio Museum---if it is open

				I don&#039;t have/have never entertained kids in NYC, but you may want to check out Time Out NY Kids (http://newyorkkids.timeout.com/). They also have a print version, although I&#039;m not sure how often it comes out (probably not weekly like the regular Time Out).<br /><br />This may seem silly, but do they have ice cream trucks in Sweeden? If not, they may think the idea of Mr. Softee is AMAZING. Chase Mr Softee down the street if you hear him coming :)

				When my niece comes to visit (she&#039;s 5) we take her to Dylan&#039;s Candy Bar and let her pick out a treat followed by FAO and usually brunch at American Girl Place (but it&#039;s way to late to get a reservation there unless there is a cancellation).&nbsp; She also likes Toys-r-Us and the Ferris Wheel.

				Thank-you to all for your many responses, I have kids and love... to explore NY.&nbsp; I am more interested in hearing about what do you think are some things I MUST do with them.&nbsp; They are only here 4 days and with small kids, the days are short.&nbsp; So what would you prioritize?&nbsp; They are girls who are visiting and I&#039;m not quite sure what they are into it.&nbsp;
