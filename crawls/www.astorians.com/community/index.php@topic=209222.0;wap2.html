			For the fifth time in under two weeks I am waking up to the strong smell of the air pollution by the power plant(s) at the northern end of Astoria. The smell is very similar to that of what an insect smells like when it&#039;s been burnt by a bug zapper. I am just under 2 miles form the plant but I that is where this smell is coming from since I used to go for early morning walks in Astoria Park and that is where the strong smell emanated. Some nights or early mornings you can also hear the loud sound of a rumbling similar to a jet engine which would go on at the same noise level for several minutes (maybe 10-15) and then shut off instantly. The brunt smell is even managing to infiltrate my double glass windows. Whether they are releasing steam or exhaust it is a hazard to our health to be exposed to this in our breathing air. Why is nothing being done about this?
