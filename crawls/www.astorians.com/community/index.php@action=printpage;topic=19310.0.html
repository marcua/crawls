				Am I the only one noticing this more often lately, the trains come into QBP and then say they&#039;re going express to Astoria Boulevard, at weird hours of the night, it makes no sense, so you get to wait or double back.&nbsp; &nbsp;What&#039;s up with the interruptions?&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve noticed it a lot in the evening, in the 7:30-8:30pm hour. I usually hit it 1-2 times a week. I love it because I get off at Ditmars, but I can imagine it&#039;s annoying for people south of me.<br /><br />Although, I&#039;ve glanced back as the train curves up 31st St, and it seems like the next train is always pulling in just behind mine, so maybe there is a method to the madness? That second train would have had to sit and wait in between stations after every stop until the first train cleared the station.

				My guess is that it is residual from rush hour. Figure a ton of trains are getting held up in line to get to Ditmars because there are more trains during rush hour, so they try to clear the end of the line out faster to make room.

				and then the trains tonight, egads, two Ns coming from Astoria on the Queens bound side of the track - I waited about 40 minutes and no trains coming towards Queens and finally gave up and grabbed a cab.&nbsp; Anyone know what was wrong with the Manhattan side tracks?&nbsp; I heard they were running the R on the F tracks.

				I got lucky......When I got to 34st Herald Sq, they were just starting to move the R to the F line which allows it to go local at 36th Ave.&nbsp; I was at the NRQ platform and an R showed up after I watched the N leave the station.....but as i got on the train, I noticed that the N that had left was only 20 feet down the tunnel. They had already started the announcements......but I think it was at the time they were making the changes so there was still R trains on their normal path. <br /><br />So, I told myself, lemme go back to the Sixth Ave platform and catch a M train if possible. Because I knew something was up with the 59th st tunnel. <br /><br />I caught an R on the F line and was able to get home quickly.......<br /><br />I am so glad I live halfway between the Steinway station and the 30th Ave. station.

				It took me 2 hours to get home - the Q train sat for awhile when I got in at 34th St at 8pm, then moved to 57th where it promptly told us to get out.&nbsp; Waiting forever and a half to realize that an N may never show up, so I hopped on the second R that showed up, thinking I could take that to Queensbridge and then take the Q69, but the bus took forever too.&nbsp; Ended up on a Q66, unsure of where it would bring me, then on a Q69 20 minutes later when it didn&#039;t get me as far as I&#039;d like.&nbsp; And boy was that bus crowded - why in the world is there an hour gap between buses??????&nbsp; &nbsp;And then I had to sit next to a screaming laughing child whose family could care less that she was annoying the crap out of the whole bus.&nbsp; Thank you MTA, you suck once again.&nbsp;

				The worst is when they make the annoucement that the train is running express AFTER it pulls out of QBP. I was on a train a couple of weeks ago where they made the annoucement after pulling out of the QBP station, went express to Astoria Blvd., then when the Manhattan bound train came, it too ran express. I had to get off at QBP and wait for another Queensbound train, which then (luckily) ran local.<br /><br />While it totally sucked for the passengers were were trying to get off at 30th, Broadway, 36th and 39th, it must have been really perplexing to those waiting on the platforms at those stations to see multiple trains go zipping by them.

				yeah after trucking to grand central - not too big a deal for me as I work off the 4-5-6 - and got to QBoro and waited 20 minutes before they suggested taking the bus. I hopped a cab instead. &nbsp;These budget cuts are really biting the MTA in the A**....crap is breaking left and right ....
