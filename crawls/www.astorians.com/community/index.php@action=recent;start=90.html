					<div class="list_posts"><br /><br /><br />An open note to car-owners...especially those with massive SUVs:<br /><br /><br />You should ALWAYS give a quick beep before pulling out of your driveway, ESPECIALLY if you are BACKING OUT.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Sidewalks are intended for PEDESTRIANS.&nbsp; I am stupefied at how many car owners never seem to consider that maybe, just maybe, a pedestrian may actually be ON the sidewalk right when they are about to pull their 2-ton vehicle out of the driveway.<br /><br /><br />Really, how HARD is it to just give a quick beep?&nbsp; Isn&#039;t it better to be safe than sorry?&nbsp; The onus is on you, the driver of the 2-ton vehicle, to watch out for pedestrians before pulling out.&nbsp; In addition, even then, you might not SEE the pedestrian...maybe just as you turn your head to one side, they are coming up from the other side.&nbsp; Or maybe the pedestrian is a toddler...the neighbor&#039;s kid...maybe your own kid.&nbsp; Either way, give a beep.<br /><br /><br />Today I almost got hit (yet again!) by an SUV that was backing out of its driveway.&nbsp; I (nicely) told the driver that it&#039;s a good idea to give a quick beep before pulling out.&nbsp; He said he was sorry.&nbsp; So all was good.&nbsp; But again, drivers need to understand that the onus is on THEM and their 2-ton vehicle to be more cautious.&nbsp; The sidewalk is for pedestrians.&nbsp; And while I understand that yes, cars may be pulling in and out, I can&#039;t be stopping at every single driveway before passing it, to first check if the car is occupied...engine on...passengers inside or not.&nbsp; I use my general awareness of course...if I see something obvious... but if it&#039;s during the day...and maybe no cars lights are on..and the car isn&#039;t moving yet...I may not realize there&#039;s a driver inside who&#039;s just about to back out.<br /><br /><br />So just give a quick beep.&nbsp; It&#039;s not that difficult and could save a life!<br /><br /><br />Trucks now make automatic beeping sounds as they are backing up.&nbsp; Clearly this was a new design intended to ALERT people that the truck is about to move, or IS moving.&nbsp; Cars don&#039;t have this option, so in the meantime the onus is on the driver to alert others around them that they are about to pull out.<br /><br /><br />Thank you!!!!</div>

					<div class="list_posts">Hey yippee....I don&#039;t visit this site much anymore. It&#039;s probably been a year or so. I&#039;m actually constipated on the bowl right now and was super bored so I decided to take a gander on the site. It seems like there may be 3 active members left.<br /><br />I was not surprised at all to see you complaining once again about Astoria residents and their cars. Glad to find you are at least now concentrating on a specific type of car (i.e. the SUV). It was hilarious to see that a few threads down from this very thread, there you were again with a stupid &#039;open letter&#039; post to people that drive.<br /><br />Why are you so obsessed? Do you really think that people that pay 3k in monthly rent or drop a million on a delapitated home really give a s___ about your concerns about their driving habits and their large SUV&#039;s? If they want to pick up their kids from school or take a drive and get a coffee who the f___ are you to comment? <br /><br />Are you that bored? Why don&#039;t you go volunteer and keep yourself busy. Maybe go direct traffic. Help the cause. <br /><br />I have to go now. Thanks for keeping me busy.</div>

					<div class="list_posts"><br /><br /><br />I&#039;m always amazed at how attached so many NYCers are to their cars.&nbsp; They&#039;ll say they &#039;need&#039; a car for this and that...coming up with a litany of explanations as to why they can&#039;t do without a car.&nbsp; Often they&#039;ll say they have a car out of goodness for someone else, i.e., for their kids or their elderly parents.&nbsp; But...somehow, many folks with kids...many elderly...get along just fine without owning a private 2-ton street-hogging, gas-guzzling car, not to mention an SUV!<br /><br /><br />SUVs are like a virus...everyone now having one for &#039;safety&#039; or &#039;so they can see over the other cars&#039;.&nbsp; So what&#039;s next?...everyone is gonna start buying low-end priced Hummers for safety...because everyone else has a Hummer, so now I need one?<br /><br /><br />Back in the day entire families managed with a single car.&nbsp; Now everyone must have &#039;their own&#039; car, and typically an SUV.&nbsp; People grab the car keys to go 4 blocks to McDonalds for their Big Mac.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I heard someone make a very interesting observation recently, about the strong car culture we have in the US.&nbsp; They said that, can you imagine private citizens demanding that the city allocate public space to them to keep a private possession?&nbsp; In other words, cars are private possessions, and yet drivers demand street parking.&nbsp; Take away a lane for them, for health-friendly, enviro-friendly bikes, and they get all up in arms.&nbsp; It&#039;s sorta like how gun-nuts get when we say we simply want gun control.&nbsp; &quot;Oh, no, you&#039;re not gonna take away OUR parking spots....you&#039;re not gonna take away a car lane from us for those &#039;bike people&#039;!!&quot; <br /><br /><br />Today it so happened I was out and about in Astoria, and right around the time when school was getting out.&nbsp; I was walking down ...I think it was 38th Street....towards 21st Avenue.&nbsp; I saw lots of schoolkids walking down the street, but what also struck me was.... there was an entire ROW of DOUBLE-PARKED cars down the entire length of 38th Street.<br /><br /><br />As I got to 21st Ave, same thing.... it was utter chaos....cars double parked on this block and that... all to pick up their spoiled lazy kids.&nbsp; I&#039;d be willing to bet that for a number of these kids, they live within a ten-block radius, yet here are the parents, chauffering them.&nbsp; There are other kids that surely live further away, and who are getting picked up.&nbsp; But then, I see plenty of other kids waiting for MTA buses to get home.&nbsp; Why can&#039;t these other kids do the same?<br /><br /><br />Sheesh.&nbsp; Talk about lazy, entitled, self-centered people.&nbsp; Nowadays, parents baby the kids.&nbsp; And the parents think nothing of causing major traffic jams to pick up their precious little darlings.&nbsp; If we don&#039;t like them double-parking....pulling out into traffic....blocking bike lanes.... tough luck!&nbsp; &nbsp;F U!&nbsp; Mind your own business!&nbsp; Right???<br /><br /><br />My word... people are just so self-centered nowadays.</div>
