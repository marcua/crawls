				Hi all,<br /><br />I&#039;ve lived in Astoria since May 2008 and walk along Steinway St. from 31st Ave to the R/V subway station every morning.&nbsp; I notice an inordinate amount of trash along the sidewalk every morning and wonder why this is.&nbsp; Just curious I suppose -- it always seems to be cleared up by the time I get home.<br /><br />Anyone know?

				Does Steinway have a BID?&nbsp; that would explain why it is cleaned up by the time you come home.&nbsp; As for what generates it, well the bars / clubs that are open late, and combine drunk people with street food carts means litter I&#039;ve always assumed.

				The Ditmars Blvd area is the same trashy way every morning, and about 9am the trash guy that Vallone paid for comes by and cleans it all up.&nbsp; Ditmars is also not around many bars and restaurants.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have surmised that there are just a lot of dirty trashy people around here that throw their garbage all over.&nbsp; Even the store owners do it.&nbsp; It&#039;s disgusting, but it&#039;s not limited to just Astoria.&nbsp; I see trash all over NYC all the time.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are those who just don&#039;t care enough about their environment to take care of it.&nbsp; It&#039;s unfortunate but true, and I&#039;ve been noticing the trash more and more.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m glad Ditmars has someone who is taking care of the garbage, but I wish it wasn&#039;t such a big problem in the first place.&nbsp;

				<br /><br />I agree.&nbsp; :roll: Ditmars Blvd. is a mess in the morning. It is even worse in the Summer months when the restaurant owners put out rotten food in cheap garbage bags and a terrible stench radiates all around the area by the subway. <br /><br />Vallone really has a hired somebody to clean this up? If so they are doing a horrible job. It also doesn&#039;t help that you pass about 15 people passing out flyers on 31st street/Ditmars area.&nbsp; From Choo-Choo&#039;s Chicken, &quot;free&quot; drinks at Mezzo, to karate lessons, enough is enough.&nbsp; :x&nbsp; I&#039;m not blaming the flyer people, but the people who take them, take a quick glance and throw it to the curb. <br /><br />I wonder if we can get some sort of organization to help out with the problem.&nbsp; I know by my office they have the &quot;Downtown Alliance&quot; similar to the one in midtown that goes around and cleans for a few hours a day.

				I say they just ticket the people throwing trash on the floor. Also, ticketing the jerks who won&#039;t pick up after their dog. If I have to clean up sh*t, then they should have to also! :x
