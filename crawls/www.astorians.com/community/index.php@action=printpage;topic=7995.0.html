For those of you that are experts, is this because of our poor economy, or because the Canadian economy is improving? Or both?

				You can have a very strong economy with a weak USD. The recent changes in the FX rate (The EURO is at 1.4) are because of the lowering of the fed fund rate on tuesday. The Macro result of this is that USD denominated securiies will not be in as strong of demand since they will be paying less in interest. As a result, foreign govt&#039;s who may own USD bonds, may sell them (and therefore sell USD) and buy higher yielding securities in other currencices. The benefit of having a weak USD is that goods produced in this country are cheaper to overseas markets. There are too many reasons to go into right now as to why this decision was taken, but the gyst of it, inflation not a concern and it is proving hard to borrow money right now with the sub-prime mortgage crisis. <br /><br />The CAD has been very strong for a while. Their economy has been doing very well, primarily driven by the many raw materials, primarily oil and wood. So basically if someone wants to buy a canadian oil stock, they will needto buy CAD, which results in that currency appreciating.

				In my &quot;Economics&quot; classes (I was a business major, but not a finance major) they taught Keynesian economics, which basically says &quot;the US debt is irrelevant.&quot; I remember thinking that such an assertion was a little iffy. I guess it&#039;s true if you can print the money to pay your bills with (yes, I&#039;m being sarcastic). Still, it explains why those in government positions seem to consider the mounting debt to be such a non-issue.<br /><br />I&#039;m more of the Friedman/Mises persuasion when it comes to economics.

				Technically the 2 decisions are independent of each other. The gov&#039;t may find it harder to borrow money with the Fed lowering the rate, not easier, so one decision really wasn&#039;t the cause or reason for the other. The Fed doesn&#039;t (or at least really shouldn&#039;t) care about govt spending.

				Yeah to the decision for a rate change I don&#039;t know what impact national debt has, but to put it into perspective:<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_public_debt<br /><br />The FX rates are just part of the ebb and flow, and at the same time a game.&nbsp; They aren&#039;t a good look into economic standings, especially with them being manipulated by things like carry-trades, where huge amounts of foreign currencies are borrowed to be invested in countries with higher interest rates.&nbsp; Even the markets themselves are not good economic indicators.&nbsp; <br /><br />Wall street was begging for the rate drop, but i think a lot of people were surprised by it, because it would be considered as just a bailout.&nbsp; If the economic data coming out is showing increases in unemployment, larger inventories, and cuts in spending then I would be a little worried.&nbsp; <br /><br />At least we&#039;re not Zimbabwe.

				Fiscal responsibility != country&#039;s economy.&nbsp; <br /><br />There is overlap, but you have to really distinguish the two of them.&nbsp; Spending 1 billion on a bridge to nowhere in Alaska does not mean that inflation will go down or interest rates will go up.&nbsp; What it does mean is that the money will come at the expense of other social programs with larger implications down the road.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to think of the most direct correlation between gov&#039;t and economy, I can&#039;t think of any more direct than taxes, an increase of which may result in a decrease in consumer spending, purchasing of cheaper products overseas (trade deficit), etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, the CAD was worth more than the USD in 1976, where did you read that it wasn&#039;t?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=7995.msg93615.html#msg93615">Quote from: AlexNYC on September 20, 2007, 10:15:20 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Under Clinton&#039;s policies we were heading for surplus by 2008.
