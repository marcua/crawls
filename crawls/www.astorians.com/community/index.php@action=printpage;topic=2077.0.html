				The ice cream truck is blasting his music full blast on my block all day, and then at night all the men who forgot to grow up come out with their Harley&#39;s and set all the car alarms off all the way down the block. Or sometimes they get &quot;challenged&quot; by some other 14-year-old stuck in an old fat man&#39;s body and decide to race. Yay, how fun and mature for all.<br /><br />Coming up next week, motor scooters!!<br /><br />A friendly reminder to anyone who cares about noise pollution:<br /><br />1. Call 311<br />2. When you get an operator say you are calling to report &quot;an illegal noise coming from outside&quot;.<br />3. They will ask your address, you can just give them an intersection.<br />4. They will ask for your name, you can say &quot;anonymous&quot;.<br />5. They will give you a confirmation number and send it over to the local precinct.<br /><br />There is no way that these noises are within the legal limit. It drives me CRAZY to have these guys cruising up and down Ditmars at 10, 11, and sometimes LATER at night. I can&#39;t be the only one.<br /><br />Oh and how appropriate, just as I&#39;m finishing this letter a Harley and a speedbike are racing down Ditmars. Yay!<br /><br />Go go gagdet rocket launcher.<br /><br />[boom]<br /><br />Okay, not really. But I did call 311.

				&nbsp;:-(&nbsp; I was just thinking of that this afternoon........ I went to pick up a pizza on Broadway and 31st Street and I had to put my hands over my ears. Between the trains rolling overhead, the people in their souped up cars that are altered to make more noise and the ambulance that came down the block....I feel like I have hearing loss.&nbsp; I need what the people on the tarmac use around their ears to block out the plane engine noise as they&#39;re directing the planes which way to go.

				Yup, there&#39;s a guy around here with a bike that SNORTS at unbelivable decibels. Up and down he goes, up and down and up and down and around the park- I can hear him from miles away.<br /><br />Luckily :-x he lives in OUR back alley. <br /><br />Seriously, I&#39;m surprised there isn&#39;t a crowd of snipers lining the sidewalks. I can&#39;t POSSIBLY be the only one who hates this guy and his cronies.<br /><br />I&#39;ve called 311 and reported &quot;drag racing&quot; many times, they switch you over to 911 where it&#39;s a similar procedure (anonymous report with a number, etc.)

				Oh Man!&nbsp; Don&#39;t get me started. I hate my new neighbors. In a matter of three weeks my neighbors have decided to reconstruct the entire contents of their house- doing all of the construction work on Sundaydays/evenings and weekday evenings starting at 6pm and ending at 11pm. (only because I go over there like a raving lunatic). The first couple of times my husband and I tried to be nice- because they are are new neighbors and we didn&#39;t want to get off to a bad start with them. But come on- enough is enough.<br /><br />Are people really that inconsiderate?! What gives??&nbsp; :-(

				The key to be heard is if all of us make sure to call 311 (or 911 if it&#39;s something illegal like speeding or racing) and make our voices heard. I actually talked to a sargent at the 114th precinct last year and he said that he does get a report of all the &quot;quality of life&quot; complaints and they do try and do something about the issues that he sees. I know that they have put at least one cop car on my block waiting for the Harley&#39;s one time. We just need to make sure that our noise is heard above the noise pollution and something will happen.<br /><br />One thing that we could do for example is figure out how to get decibel meters into the hands of our local officers. So that they can actually tell when someone is breaking the law by being too noisey.<br /><br />In the case of your neighbors I&#39;d do the same thing. Call 311. If they can&#39;t be reasonable after that then call the department of buildings.

				311 is definitely a help with noise complaints - it helps the local police precinct and DEP determine where the problem areas are and gets us more attention and resources, even if it doesn&#39;t always result in a quick resolution of the problem.<br />The motorcycles are pretty noisy - and when they set off the car alarms, it&#39;s even worse.&nbsp; Hopefully we get increased enforcement this Summer.

				311 helps only when the establishment or individual offender is not part of some organized mafia or paying off the police.&nbsp; I lived for three years above a cafe on 38th and Ditmars, which blared music and whose patrons yelled at all hours, Monday thru Sunday - it was a 24 hour spot.&nbsp; One of those men&#39;s clubs where all they do is talk and drink coffee with each other, and the only women around are the waitresses.&nbsp; This cafe&#39;s back windows opened into my apartment building&#39;s inner courtyard, where their loud voices and incessant nonstop music would echo all night.&nbsp; We had a tenants organization, and we tried to no avail to get them out.&nbsp; We called 311, one woman lived right above it - she called nightly.&nbsp; They take your name, and detail of what is happening, and then you never hear back from them.&nbsp; I was there for three years.&nbsp; Many other people were there longer.&nbsp; Nothing was ever done.&nbsp; I began to think the police were just paid off.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Incidently, now I&#39;ve moved, and the entire block of establishments including the Olympic Diner, the noisy cafe, and the shoe guy were all thrown out sometime last year.&nbsp; A bank owned by the landlord is moving in.

				Interesting to hear about the 311 situation. I thought about calling a number of times but never did, usually in reference to the guy who lives nearby and parks his motorcycle just outside my building. Then he gets up early in the morning and turns it on and &quot;warms it up&quot; for a while. I&#39;ve seriously considered throwing things at him/at his bike/pushing his bike over when he&#39;s not around/reporting his bike to the police when he parks it on the sidewalk.<br /><br />However I&#39;m finding that he&#39;s nothing compared to the mental defectives who have come out with the advent of the warmer weather. They drive their motorcycles round and round the block on weekend afternoons. I had to kick one off my stoop the other day so I could exit my building - I know they don&#39;t live in my building so I&#39;ve got no problem with being rude to them. <br /><br />Meanwhile I dream of buying double-pane glass windows with noise-reduction properties... but then there&#39;s always the summer. You&#39;ve gotta open them! Oh well...

				Call the 114th Precinct about the guy warming up his bike - that sounds like something they could do something about, even if it&#39;s only giving him a warning.<br />With regard to the construction, call Department of Buildings - check on their permits and see what time they are allowed to start and by what time they have to stop.&nbsp; You should call the Councilmember&#39;s office on this as well.

				Is anyone besides me bothered by the Greek orthodox festival sponsored by (deep breath) The Sacred Patriarchal and Stavropegial Monastery of Saint Irene Chrysovalantou? It takes place the last week of July. A band starts playing at sundown at 23rd Ave and 36th St. <br /><br />The band is under the viaduct and hooked to a PA system. I can hear them with my windows closed, air-conditioners on full blast, and pillow over my head, from half a block away. They don&#39;t stop playing until after 11 pm.<br /><br />Every year I call 311 and lodge a noise complaint, and every year nothing happens. I assume that the local precinct gets bought off. If anyone has any suggestions (other than violence) I would be most grateful.

				Book Minstrel, the church probably has a permit to play music in public up until a certain time. I have a similar situation with Saint Rocco every year, on their day of celebration, I&#39;ll hear music all evening until about midnight. I don&#39;t complain since it&#39;s only once a year, but I do close my windows.&nbsp; :wink:

				Ah yes, beeping trucks (and heaven only knows what else).&nbsp; Welcome to my world, ladies and gents.&nbsp; I&#39;m quite sure I&#39;ve mentioned this before, but the construction of that @*$&amp;^$# high school across the street from my apartment begins work every weekday morning (and sometimes Saturdays) from between 5:30 and 6:30 am.&nbsp; And they won&#39;t be done till sometime in 2007.&nbsp; After staying for 3 weeks in my mom&#39;s very quiet home in California, it is none too pleasing.&nbsp; And I can&#39;t close the window or I will die from heatstroke.&nbsp; Ain&#39;t life grand?

				Ah yeah, the motorcyclists.<br /><br />I hate them.<br /><br />I live on Ditmars by the park which is where these upstanding citizens congregate and zoom down the one stretch of road surrounding the park without speedbumps.&nbsp; I often wish that a few of them would skid off of the road and into the river while turning onto Shore.&nbsp; Not all of them, necessarily, but just enough to scare the rest into not hauling ass down the street at 1am on a Tuesday.&nbsp; What&#39;s up with that?<br /><br />Today I got woken up at <strong>8</strong> by someone roaring down the street.&nbsp; I assume at this point that these people are being straight-up malicious to the people who live here because there&#39;s no other good explanation aside from being an utter failure at life.

				And we&#039;re back folks! Spring as arrived and the modified Harley&#039;s are in full bloom this year speeding up and down residential streets.<br /><br />I just saw two of these assholes on LOUD bikes racing down my street and called 911. Please folks, if you see these guys speeding, racing, or running red lights in your neighborhood please don&#039;t hesitate to call 911. If the bikes are modified (extremely loud) call 311 and file a noise complaint.<br /><br />The only way the NYPD will do anything about it is if we manage to make more noise than the bikes do (sadly). Go figure. <br /><br />Please keep calling when you hear or see anything and let&#039;s try and keep this summer a reasonable one when it comes to noise pollution.

				i guess living in nyc for 27 years has made me immune to noise. i don&#039;t notice the ice cream trucks unless the song is in my head (and i lived right next to a playground for 2 years, so that was non stop-still didn&#039;t bug me...if anything it motivated me to get out of bed when i was depressed). <br />yelling in the street is just something i&#039;ve always been used to seeing, hearing and doing. If i see my friend across the street i &quot;pull a queens&quot; I yell across the street at &#039;em. don&#039;t really notice the hogs either...but i suppose if i lived right where they were constantly going back and forth it could drive me batty.<br />honestly; if astoria were quiet like a suburb, i would move. quiet creeps me out. give me the city life and all the noise that goes with it any day.

				P.S. I would like to clarify something. Firelight I did not mean to infer that you were an idiot for yelling across the street- I was referring more specifically to the people who insist on doing it late at night while everyone is sleeping.

				If you live in NYC I think you have to be used to a certain level of noise. But some of us live on streets where the Ice Cream trucks blast their music full blast, or where the idiot motor cycles drag race up and down our streets setting off car alarms all the way down the street in the middle of the night.

				As a native Astorian I have to tell you that the noise level has always been the same. From the bikers to the ice cream trucks. It is really part of the Springtime and Summertime charm of the neighborhood. Groups of roving teens blaring their music; car washing with the car doors open and the music blaring; spontaneous foot- stick- baseball games with the local girl cheerleaders screaming; dogs yapping; people who know each other yelling to each other; Moms calling their kids from the windows; the little girls squealing playing hop-scotch or potsy; groups playing handball or stoopball.<br /><br />Those bikers you see in and around the park today, are the offspring of the last generation who did the exact same thing. <br /><br />The passing red lights, stop signs . . . well that has always been illegal, and should be reported; but it won&#039;t stop it. It happens everywhere.<br /><br />I love this neighborhood. I also love change. But if you remove the bikers, and the teen groups the change might be that the flavor of the entire area will change forever. I also have to admit that the sound of the ice cream truck makes me smile. It reminds me of hearing it and having to run for my wallet because my children would start their begging. They were really good times for kids. The music alerted them to the treats waiting for them outside. Don&#039;t you have things from your childhood that bring back sweet memories of the summers of your past?<br /><br />Seek out the help of the local precinct to more closely monitor the area around the park—night and day.

				lets face it, I&#039;ve been here in Astoria the longest. Most of these people just read about how &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;Up and coming&quot; Williamsburg is, and since they couldn&#039;t afford it, they move here. These jerks were on Astorians.net 2 weeks ago asking which side of Astoria Blvd. is better to live on! You dicks. One of you even said that Pizza Palace is good. Oh my god. Listen, if you don&#039;t like the ice cream truck music, there are a bunch of options: 1)tell him to turn it off, if you have the guts. 2)put cotton in your ears. Or better yet, use your NY Times. 3)Go old school, and throw an egg at it from your window.&nbsp; But we&#039;re REAL NY&#039;ERS, and we are LOUD. Go back to Kansas if you like to hear the wind through the corn stalks, for goodness sakes.

				Some noise is to be expected in any neighborhood in a city, but some noise is unnecessary, and I think that motorcycle noise is a big problem.&nbsp; It&#039;s not just the noise of the bikes, but that they set off all the car alarms, often in the middle of the night.&nbsp; I never found Astoria to be that noisy, especially not compared to parts of Manhattan I&#039;d lived in back in the early 90s, but over the last two years, I think it has gotten noisier.

It is not the fault of the bikers, or the truckers, it is the fault of those people who have car alarms that are set to go off at the slightest movement of the pavement. They are all adjustable, you know. We had a problem on my block a few years ago. When a car alarm went off in the middle of the night, a pre-printed note was left for the owner advising them that their alarm is set to a too sensitive level and needs to be adjusted. Sometimes a fire engine or ambulance siren would set them off. No-one ever complained about fire engines or ambulances. Just bikers. <br /><br />We no longer have car alarms going off all night long.

If you can&#039;t see the value in enforcing your own laws then I&#039;d argue you don&#039;t have the city&#039;s best interest in mind, no matter where you were born.

				Your ears are not genetically different because you are a lifetime New Yorker and claim a greater tolerance for noise.&nbsp; Noise pollution is not a quality of life issue, it is a human health issue.&nbsp;<br /><br />Long term exposure to noise pollution results in reduced hearing, increased stress levels, lost sleep and productivity.&nbsp; The cacophony of noise that many of us are exposed to is harmful.&nbsp; Noise pollution is nerve shattering to adults and frightening to young children.<br /><br />For some people, the levels of noise are so great that they are forced to move from their apartments or suffer in silence.&nbsp; A few even resort to medications as a means to cope with the noise even though there is nothing wrong with them.<br /><br />Ten years ago, no one knew what a boom car was, now they are everywhere.&nbsp; Motorcycles and hot-rods are much louder than they were because the EPA has not enforced noise emissions from aftermarket exhaust systems manufacturers in twenty years.&nbsp; For all the screaming noise of car alarms, they just don&#039;t work - thieves intentionally trip the alarm to mask the sound of breaking glass.<br /><br />Astoria is flooded with noise and if you live near a busy thoroughfare as many of us do, it is a nightmare.

				I actually moved to Astoria precisely because it was quiet. Especially the side streets. Taht&#039;s what struck me the most when I first checked out the neighborhood. I&#039;d lived in a far, far noisier neighborhood in DC for many years. :mrgreen:<br /><br />Yeah, and the scooters and motorcycles were a pain. At least I no longer live on the Scooter Raceway street.&nbsp; :-D But the Mr. Softee makes my skin crawl eveyr time I hear it. It&#039;s painful. When I was a kid the local ice cream trucks just had a couple of bells on a string they would ring manually.

				Since the civility of this thread is starting to wane I decided to read through it again from the beginning.<br /><br />Upon first viewing my feelings were of sympathy and amusement, mainly because longer-time residents have been complaining about this same issue for decades and I’m more than happy to give you younger (or maybe not so young), whippersnapper (or maybe not so snappy) newcomers a go at tackling it.<br /><br />But let’s tally the list of items that need to be banned (in order of mention):<br /><br />Ice cream trucks<br />Motorcycles, specifically Harleys<br />Car alarms<br />Motor scooters<br />The subway<br />Neighbors<br />Restaurants, cafes, or bars<br />Construction<br />Street fairs<br />Auto dealership parties<br />Saint Irene, Saint Anthony and Saint Rocco<br />Beeping trucks<br />Yelling in the street<br />Playground noise<br /><br />Can some of you understand why the complaints have bothered some? This is life in the city. It’s noisy and compromises have to be made. If you start eliminating items from the above list you forever change the essence of city living -- and it seems why live here if you are so affected by such things?&nbsp; <br /><br />Now I totally sympathize to individuals who have to suffer living above or near a business that generates continuous noise, especially late into the evening. It’s very detrimental to quality of life and there have been good suggestions posted here to help you alleviate the problem (though in my opinion the only way to deal with it is to move).<br /><br />And during the summer it’s especially not fun for the people who live around the edges of Astoria Park. I did for a couple of years and it was really rough to deal with the nightly car-cycle-traffic cruising noise. (Though I did feel it was payback for all the summers I did the same exact thing in my teens-20s). For a couple of summers the 114th set up road blocks around the park and it seemed to help (or at least push the problem to other areas). I’m not sure why they stopped.<br /><br />I’m not saying anyone should stop being annoyed or bothered by the noise but a perhaps a different perspective would be helpful.<br /><br />

I don&#039;t see the complaints as being about &quot;banning&quot; the subway, or parties, or babies; but more that people are frustrated that <em>existing</em> noise laws are not enforced. I can see how someone could be upset if they thought that people were wanting to create new laws that &quot;ban&quot; children from playing on playgrounds, or any other of the things that you&#039;ve summarized. But if you re-read the thread you&#039;ll not see people even want that.<br /><br />For some of us who live on the particularly noisy streets of our town we&#039;d just like to see things kept to more reasonable (real LEGAL) levels, nobody wants to &quot;ban&quot; all noise - that&#039;s not realistic.

				Hi Merm -- Please don&#039;t think I intended to trivalize the problems experienced by you or anyone else who posted in this thread. I too think that noise levels are out of control in some areas in the neighbourhood -- especially in regard to bars and restaurants -- and I think I did point out in my post that noise has been and is an issue.<br /><br />All I meant to add was a bit of perspective -- nothing more.<br /><br />The list mentioned everything in the thread that people found noisy, not necessarily noisy enough to make a complaint about it. I wrote &#039;banned&#039; because it seemed to me a suitable word -- not in the literal sense -- but how else is the noise problem to be solved to everyone&#039;s satisfaction given the litany of complaints and the personalities of the people making them? <br /><br />An ice cream truck, street fairs, kids screaming, people out in the street late at night...summertime! Annoying to some yes, sometimes or all the time but to me this is the essence of living in the city and I&#039;m sorry but my opinion is deal or move to a less urban environment.<br /><br />Noise is subjective making it a complicated problem and I think a distinction should be drawn between fleeting noise and continuous noise. <br /><br />A Mister Softee truck playing its tune for a few minutes as it stops to sell a cone is not really all that much of a bother is it? But an ice cream truck parked down at then playground for a couple of hours, or all day! on endless loop -- now that&#039;s a problem! Another person might be driven to drive-byand shoot by just one drive-by of the truck<br /><br />A motorcycle passing by is noticable for a few seconds and hardly a bother, right? When we&#039;re talking ten in 30 minutes say, then even I&#039;m bothered. Another person my be annoyed at just the one and feel the need to call the police about it. <br /><br />You say no one is talking of banning children from playgrounds but there are people who complain to the cops about it. I&#039;m talking normal kid-stuff mind you, running around screaming during daylight hours, not kid&#039;s causing trouble kinda noise. It happened when I was a kid (way back when) and it continues today. <br /><br />How do the police balance all the competing interests? I cite the police because they are &#039;the&#039; law enforcement agency in this city.<br /><br />I agree that existing laws should be enforced but how? -- especially since no one has been able to find a solution (especially to the motorcycle issue) in the time it has taken me to age into an unsuitable demographic?<br /><br />I think you all know how I feel about the subject (mixed up!) so I&#039;ll stop now. <br /><br />But I want to generally ask everyone how do you expect the police to deal with this?<br /><br />To me the biggest problem to the public in general is motorcycles and illegally modified cars -- whose drivers are very reckless much of the time. I would like to see more checkpoints more often at the park and along Ditmars and other thoroughfares where it&#039;s a problem. It won&#039;t make them go away but hopefully this will make the streets a bit more safer and quieter as well.<br /><br />Second, more enforcement of noise laws concerning bars and restaurants. But I&#039;m not sure how this can be done other than putting pressure on local pols, police, liquor authority, etc. which everyone knows has limited effect.<br /><br />Any other ideas?

				Illegal immigrants come from more areas than just Latin America and Muslim countries.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure no one appreciates loud music pouring out of cars, but that happens from people who are American citizens as well.&nbsp; I wonder if some of the folks who &quot;share&quot; their music with everyone are partially deaf.&nbsp; I would think some of them have to be from how loud they have the music cranked up.

				There are some types of noise that can be mitigated and other types of noise that can be abated.&nbsp; Car alarm noise can be be abated; there are better technologies such as silent pagers that can alert the owner directly if the alarm is tripped.<br /><br />Most businesses can effectively mitigate noise if it proves to be a problem for neighbors, that includes better policies on music playing, improved insulation, and following existing noise codes in place.&nbsp; Better legislation and enforcement on loud motorcycles and boom cars is another means to reduce noise.

				I&#039;m not sure why some of you thoughtful individuals are even responding to &quot;real astoria fella&quot;...what an ass..<br /><br />Personally, I think the ranting of noise pollution is a little out of control. Living in a densely populated area, in a cityish place like Astoria, it isn&#039;t going to be quiet. If it is so troublesome, then this is not the place to live for you. Period. <br /><br />Plus, subjectivity of noise interpretation, does make it difficult to rule on as 28grand pointed out...what is okay and what isn&#039;t? I&#039;m not sure I&#039;m comfortable outlining allllll the guidelines of what is okay, nor do I think that resources should be spent in that direction. But I don&#039;t have a good answer for it.&nbsp; :cry: <br /><br />Coincidentally, I was walking down ditmars yesterday, and there was a guy, sitting on a motorcycle, talking to someone for a while, and had his very, very loud bike running the entire time. This was very annoying and I couldn&#039;t identify exactly what the point was, so it bothered me, but what do you do?

				I think it&#039;s funny when people who don&#039;t like a certain group of people hang out with them (or visit their website and read their posts) just so they can complain about them. It doesn&#039;t make any sense. Why be around people (or read their thoughts) if they irritate you? The nature of free will (and a free country for that matter) is that you don&#039;t have to read stuff or hang out around people you don&#039;t like. Isn&#039;t that wonderful? Let&#039;s all make sure we&#039;re exercising that free will in our own lives, shall we?<br /><br />Back to the subject of the topic as it was intended.. I felt like my street sounded like a block party was going on Tuesday night! It&#039;s just what comes with the warm weather though. I get my own joy out of the warmer weather (getting to open my windows, eating lunch outside, going to the park), so I try and let that outweigh any aggravations that might come with it... (That said, yes the return of the motorcycles is a bummer.)
