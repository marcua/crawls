				I was thinking of trying to organize a dart outing sometime in the future.&nbsp; &nbsp;Are there enough people interested in playing a few matches or maybe an elimination thingy for me to make the effort?<br /><br />The only bar I know that has room and where we can hijack the board(s) on any particular evening is Lavelle&#039;s on Broadway and 46th.&nbsp; &nbsp;An old man&#039;s bar, I know, but they had 2 boards set up the last time I was there so that alone gives it my vote.&nbsp; &nbsp;Pat could use the business I&#039;m sure.&nbsp; &nbsp;(I built one of the backboards, so it gives me a chance to show off my carpentry skills to anyone interested....or not.&nbsp; Haha)&nbsp; *pats self on back*<br /><br />A decent response, and we&#039;ll make it happen.<br /><br />(http://a266.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images01/13/m_f539171a8a4f10d43d467844d61bec51.jpg)

				Do they have real boards or those &quot;baby boards&quot; with the holes holes that only accept those plastic tipped darts? If it&#039;s the former then I&#039;m game, although I must say that I haven&#039;t played in ages, even though i have two sets of darts (20 grams &amp; 24grams) My flights are not what they used to be, plus I have no idea where in this great city of ours I can buy any!<br /><br /><br /><br />Hit me up...

				Oh no... we&#039;re talking real bristle boards, regulation distances and plenty of room.<br /><br />I usually order my flights online, but the sports authority has basic ones.&nbsp; I think I have brand-new budweiser flights that I&#039;ll probably never use (sorry jayme) that you can have.<br /><br />Hope it turns out to be more than just the two of us.&nbsp; &nbsp;Newcomers welcome.&nbsp; :-)

				well, to be honest, I was waiting to see about the response before I got all excited about a time-frame.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was thinking mid-late March.&nbsp; &nbsp;Once we got a good following here, or at least 2 or 3 more, I&#039;d head over there and see if there was a league night, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp; If a league night seems best for everyone, we could wait for an away night for the bar.&nbsp; (it usually alternates)<br /><br />Still waiting for more ppl befoer I get excited over it.&nbsp; (that sounded less discouragaing inside my head)&nbsp; :-P

				If you need the supplies, check out any of the local dart bars on a league night. A lot of bars will have some of that stuff in stock- flights, shafts, etc... Or they have a number of the local League supplier and he will show up at various bars to sell his stuff.

				Break on 32nd and Broadway has one of those electronic dart boards which make it easier for beginners like me to keep track of scoring. It still helps to have someone explain the rules, though.

				Hey! This sounds fun. I&#039;ve only played darts on one of those wussy electronic boards, but I could be interested! I have this tendency to hit the bullseye when I&#039;m not even trying.<br /><br />Question: do I have to bring my own darts? Because I don&#039;t have any. If yes, does someone have some I can borrow?<br /><br />Please don&#039;t plan it around this, but if you guys end up having it the weekend of the 15th or the 22nd, I won&#039;t be able to make it, I&#039;m going to be up in CT both weekends. (Gah, I feel like I&#039;m spending more time up there lately than I am here, but those 2 weekends are family things, so I&#039;ve gotta go.)

				Ooh, I might be interested, depending on the time of day, and what night it was.&nbsp; I used to play darts with my dad, and actually got fairly good - but I haven&#039;t played in several years so I probably suck again.&nbsp; I&#039;m down if no one minds someone who&#039;ll be easily whooped in a game.
