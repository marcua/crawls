				I know this question may be a bit intrusive, so forgive me if I&#039;m being too obnoxious, but I&#039;m trying to get a feel for what I should expect to pay for PT childcare. I&#039;d like to know what other Astorians are paying for childcare. I have a 4 year old and a 1 year old. I would need babysitting 3 mornings a week for 3-4 hours. What should I expect to pay? I was kind of discouraged by the hourly rates I was given by a babysitter I really liked. It made it a wash for me to even bother working since I would just be working to pay the sitter. Daycare didn&#039;t make sense either since I&#039;d have to enroll the children at two different schools due to their age difference and one being in diapers. My 4 year old also goes to preK in the afternoon, so I would end up spending most of my day carting the kids around instead of working. I guess I am curious as to what other Astorians are paying if you don&#039;t mind telling me. Thanks!

				We went to an open house at The Learning Odyssey Day Care center yesterday.&nbsp; They charge $400 a week for 8am - 6pm for infants (less for toddlers).&nbsp; Plus more if you need to drop off before 8 or pick up after 6.&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought it seemed kind of high for a day care - and would rather have a 1:1 situation at my home for a little more $$.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Our daughter is at Learning Odyssey and I can&#039;t say enough good things about it.&nbsp; Yes, you pay more, but that is because you get <strong>so </strong> much more.&nbsp; They have more providers per child than any place I&#039;ve seen.&nbsp; All their teachers have a great deal of experience and training.&nbsp; The facility is gorgeous and you will NOT find any place cleaner or more concerned with maintaining the kids&#039; health.&nbsp; They wash hands frequently.&nbsp; They help the children brush their teeth after meals.&nbsp; They do educational activities.&nbsp; They have a great outdoor play area attached to the facility.&nbsp; They have cameras, excellent security, its convenient to transportation, etc.<br /><br />I&#039;ve looked at other places in the neighborhood and there really is no comparison.

				I&#039;m starting with a nanny this week...I&#039;ve met with her and adore her. We will be trialling next two weeks with me in the home and then start to try without...my daughter is 3 months old. I&quot;m not comfortable with day care quite yet. I know everyone says they need to be around other children, but I don&#039;t know how much I agree with that as a &#039;need&#039;...there are benefits and negatives to both. I&#039;m paying the sitter/nanny ten dollars an hour. What quotes were you hearing that upset you?

				We found the nanny through a local democratic club she belonged to and she is greek. It was important to me to have greek so that she will speak to my daugther in greek. She is a graduate student at Hunter (coincidntally where I am a professor). I don&#039;t need her full time however, which is why the cost is more manageable for me. <br /><br />ARe you looking Jennifer or are you going to go the daycare route...and shouldn&#039;t you be delivering sometime soon?

				From what I hear, ten dollars an hour is about par for a nanny, depending on where you are though...I know some that pay eight...I was going to offer twelve and many people told me that was too much and gives you nowhere to go for a raise.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what the hourly rate for day care would be....if you are doing forty hours at four hundred dollars, that is ten bucks an hour, and I would rather have the nanny personally. Socialization can be found everywhere, cousins playgrounds, and I value the 1:1 that the child would get, as long as it is someone that I can trust.

We decided to pass on it and opted for a nanny instead.&nbsp; We got lucky with our current nanny (after having 2 other horrible nannies).&nbsp; We met her by word of mouth through my mother in law&#039;s cleaning lady.&nbsp; The cost for a nanny is dependant on what your agreement with her is.&nbsp; We pay about $10 per hour.&nbsp; Some nannies charge more and require that you provide them with breakfast and lunch among other things.&nbsp; Again this is all&nbsp; based on your agreement with her.&nbsp; <br /><br />A friend gave me a website - Care.com.&nbsp; This website post profiles for a wide array of babysitters and nannies / their rates / and available times.&nbsp; My friend was able to get a part time babysitter who picks up her son from his day care and stays at home with him until she get home from work.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hope this helps.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)

				We have looked at 2 full time day cares so far (I&#039;m due in Sept), both of which we liked: one in Astoria that was $1200 per month for infants, and one in Manhattan that was $2310 per month for infants. the one in Astoria though was 8-6, while the one on the rock was 9-5 -- the rate goes up to $2449 per month if you want an extra hour. At both the cost was less for toddlers, and in Astoria you could do 2/3/4 days/week or just mornings/afternoons for less. Oh, and the one in Manhattan charged us $150 to get on the waiting list... which we forked over even though we don&#039;t think we&#039;ll go with that place (mostly b/c of the logistics of commuting with baby seem insurmountable -- it was extremely nice), just so we have options when the time comes!<br /><br />I haven&#039;t looked into nannies but $10 an hour is on par with what I&#039;ve heard from friends. I&#039;ve also heard that you can pay a bit less -- like $7 or $8 an hour -- if you share a nanny with another couple. I think we will explore the nanny option too but not until the baby is here.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				It was, um, Happy Days Learning Center I think (definitely Happy Days something -- sorry, at work &amp; don&#039;t have paperwork in front of me). Someone on Astorians had recommended it on a previous thread &amp; it was in fact quite nice -- little back yard so the kids go outside, which we really liked,&nbsp; and quiet &amp; clean (albeit we saw it at 8am when no one was there yet), and seemed quite well organized -- they gave us a whole packet of info that was really well thought out. And the two women that we met (owner and another; they told us there are 3 altogether) were completely willing to answer all our questions and we got a very good vibe from them. Only drawback was they have very few slots for infants &amp; no formal waiting list so it seems iffy whether one would actually get in or not. We would have signed up on the spot if we could&#039;ve I think! Location is on 36th St. just south of Astoria Blvd. -- pretty convenient to Astoria Blvd. train stop. They have a website also -- again don&#039;t have URL but would think easily googled. They are apparently quite new -- they don&#039;t appear yet in any case in the listings available on NYC.gov (have you checked that out? you can see all a places violations going back several inspection periods, too, although some of the notations are mystifying). Hope that helps!

				Jenr, What is the context for the $7 or $8/hour? It seems very low for NY. I understand raising the salary after a few months/or a year if you have them that long, but is this a price for kids in high school for occasional babysitting or college students, or if they&#039;re just minding the baby and nothing else like housework or making meals? Is this based on the age of the kid, too, like the younger, the less work you&nbsp; have to do, etc...? I imagine that people who are doing this for a living and are qualified and do this 9-5 everyday for families year in and year out, $7/8 seems low. I don&#039;t know, maybe they&#039;re from abroad and are sending money home for their families?

				For ten an hour, i personally don&#039;t expect housework or cooking meals (but this isn&#039;t an issue for an infant). I do expect the babies room to be kept neat, but that&#039;s more a clean as you go type housework (in other words, don&#039;t leave the place worse than when you found it). I also allow free reign on the fridge. I can&#039;t see paying less than that, but I know some who do.

				yes, exactly -- the nanny/sitter makes more than she would for 1 child, but not double, so each family pays less than they would for a 1-on-1 nanny. Again though this is totally hearsay, not based on any&nbsp; actual experience I have looking for such a situation. <br /><br />I&#039;m sure you can also pay more :-) &amp; maybe one would actually want to pay as much as one could afford (or even a bit more) for a great caregiver you feel completely happy leaving your child with, who also comes to you on your schedule, etc. When I think about what constitutes a living wage in this city, it seems crazy to expect a qualified nanny to take less than $30k a year. A full time nanny (8-6) at $10/hr five days a week is close to that but still under ($26k)...&nbsp; <br /><br />no matter how you slice it, childcare is expensive &amp; difficult (&amp; that goes for one parent staying at home, too, I think). An obvious point, but I wonder if other cities/states/countries have their acts together better to support families in this critical area.

				Hi everyone, I&#039;m new here, this is my first post!<br /><br />I researched daycare in the 11103 area.&nbsp; I visited Learning Odyssey, Happy Days and Perfect Angels.&nbsp; All quoted $1,600 per month for an infant with only Perfect Angels offering a part-time option with a reduced rate.&nbsp; Of the 3, Learning Odyssey was BY FAR the best.&nbsp; The staff are all trained and continuing their education in childcare, it was exceptionally bright and clean, there is a monthly curriculum - even for the babies, the ratio is 2:1, there&#039;s a large backyard play area, the play room is separate from the infant nap area... I really could go on and on.&nbsp; Of the three, it was most run like a business which I liked.&nbsp; The Director was very nice and the large staff spent the entire time we were there cleaning, sanitizing and preparing for the next day.&nbsp; We were very lucky to be able to enroll our baby since the wait list is quite extensive.&nbsp; Only 12 children can be enrolled at any given time.&nbsp; Again, another plus.<br /><br />Happy Days had all the same features - 2:1, 12 children - my drawbacks to their facility were that it was only one large room - no difference from play and nap, I only saw one additional caregiver besides the Director and it is very close to Astoria Blvd. which made me nervous.&nbsp; Also, they play the TV during food prep and while they said the programming would be educational, it&#039;s parking the kid in front of the TV to get something done and it made me wonder if it was done more often than they said.&nbsp; They also didn&#039;t seem to have a set learning curriculum and while my baby is only 7 weeks old, he&#039;ll be in daycare until he&#039;s ready for school so I want him to be in a facility that will prepare him for that. They did have a backyard with lots of toys and they were sanitizing while I was there.&nbsp; Also, food is provided which is a huge plus.<br /><br />Perfect Angels, I&#039;m sorry, was a hot mess.&nbsp; Literally.&nbsp; The rooms were very tiny and cluttered.&nbsp; There were post-it notes every where reminding the staff simple things like to wash their hands and the &#039;play area&#039; was a Little Tykes tree house crammed in a small room.&nbsp; There WAS an outdoor play area but you had to go through the Director&#039;s house and even then it was just their driveway.&nbsp; No toys were visible and there wasn&#039;t a safety gate.&nbsp; There was a rubber floor installed though.&nbsp; What I will say about them is the Director was very passionate about the children and you could tell the toddlers were kept very busy.&nbsp; If our child was older, I believe he would thrive there.&nbsp; It was set up like a school and they had a full curriculum.&nbsp; Just not a place for babies and the post-its made me wonder about the quality of the care givers.<br /><br />I would recommend anyone looking for daycare to visit the NYS Office of Child and Family Services.&nbsp; http://www.ocfs.state.ny.us/main/becs/&nbsp; All three above are licensed by the state and subject to its policies and regulations which are quite extensive.<br /><br />While you could get a nanny for possibly the same rate or less... most are paid under the table so you couldn&#039;t claim it on your taxes.&nbsp; They&#039;re not licensed care givers so you really not sure what you&#039;re gonna get.&nbsp; Also, since they are individuals if they are sick or cannot watch your baby for any reason, there is no fall back.&nbsp; For us personally, day care was a better option.

				Kokowillis, thank you for the very comprehensive review, and welcome! I am new to the board also &amp; expecting in a little over a month :-)<br /><br />As a newbie also I&#039;m not sure whether this is appropriate for the thread, but I&#039;m curious to know whether you&#039;re looking for an immediate placement, and how long Learning Odyssey told you you might have to wait? <br /><br />Also I think I said before that Happy Days had quoted me $1200/mo, which upon reading your post I realize was an error-- it was $400 a week for infants, which is $1600/mo, not 1200, duh. My brain is mush! Apologies to all for the mistake.<br /><br />

				Congrats on your impending arrival!<br /><br />We starting looking in May and put ourselves on wait lists back then at all three places.&nbsp; All had &#039;possible&#039; openings in Sept.&nbsp; I was able to get an extension on my leave at work and that worked out with an opening in October at Learning Odyssey so we got lucky!&nbsp; When I followed up with Happy Days last month, they said they didn&#039;t have openings until November.&nbsp; Also, I forgot to mention above that Happy Days is planning on opening a second facility which should open up several spots.&nbsp; I never followed up with Perfect Angels.<br /><br />If you need daycare, you should visit as many places as you can now and put yourself on wait lists.&nbsp; Good luck!!

				Welcome Kokowillis! and congrats on your little one.<br /><br />I opted the nanny route, but the points you made are good ones. WE happen to have fall back childcare in a pinch, but i would imagine this would be a problem if we didn&#039;t. Thanks for all hte info though. That must&#039;ve taken you some time to write out and definitely benefited all of use to read.

				How early should one begin to look for childcare? My wife is not due until mid February and we wouldn&#039;t need care until April or so...but I&#039;m already stressing about this part of it! Are their other website / groups that are helpful to Astoria soon to be parents that people can recommend?<br /><br />Any help is appreciated!!!!

				King -- If you&#039;re going to be looking for day care for your newborn, it&#039;s not a bad idea to start looking now -- there are not very many places that take babies in the area.&nbsp; We actually sent our boys to Tutor Time of College Point until recently because we couldn&#039;t find a place that would take kids under 2.&nbsp; If you have a car, Tutor Time is actually great -- seems to be head and shoulders above the rest for babies --- and only about a 15 minute drive from Astoria.&nbsp; I won&#039;t give a full run down here, but PM me if you want details.<br /><br />That being said, we just moved them to Kid Krazy on 21st Avenue, and it&#039;s great!&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Thanks, we will definitely check those places out. I think we are leaning towards a nanny, at least for the first year or two, but not sure where to start on that one either!

				I typically pay $8-10 an hour for childcare on weekends or school holidays.&nbsp; My son in in K at Immaculate Conception (LOVE THAT SCHOOL, btw) and we do the very convenient, very affordable after-school childcare option--- $75/week from 2:45 until as late as 6 pm. (I always try to collect Anthony before 5, but many parents dont get there until 6)
