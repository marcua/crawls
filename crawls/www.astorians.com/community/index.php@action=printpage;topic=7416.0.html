				That&#039;s my hunch.&nbsp; There were City Council hearings today regarding the steam pipe explosion, and the CEO of Con Ed Kevin Burke failed to show&nbsp; :-o.&nbsp; Even worse, he sends an underling with an uncanny lack of ability to answer questions put to him with anything substantial&nbsp; :lol:.&nbsp; My SpideySense was tingling all evening (there&#039;s already speculation in the electronic media about this).

				Don&#039;t quote me on this...but I heard somewhere that Keyspan buys it&#039;s energy/power/whatever it&#039;s called from Con Ed.&nbsp;

There was&nbsp; an excellent docu on NYC underground&nbsp; infrastructuire on PBS&nbsp; some years&nbsp; back, where&nbsp; they said these&nbsp; things, would happen on occasion&nbsp; as&nbsp; long as&nbsp; the City was unable to shut down and open large sectors&nbsp; of streets. It&#039;s more&nbsp; than just&nbsp; a&nbsp; monopoly not caring, which is&nbsp; also&nbsp; the case, it is&nbsp; drivers and business&nbsp; which would&nbsp; raise&nbsp; holy hell&nbsp; when streets&nbsp; would&nbsp; have to be shut down.
