				Is there still no place in Astoria to buy good whole-bean coffee?<br /><br /><br />I mean fairly-high-quality, not standard supermarket fodder. Here&#039;s what I&#039;ve found:<ul class="bbc_list"><li>Starf*cks&nbsp; - I hate the place. Out of the question.</li><li>Euro Market - Low quality but at least you can buy by the ounce (i.e. not pre-packaged)</li><li>Green Bay on Broadway - Really awful quality. And the beans labeled as decaf always turn out to be regular! ALWAYS.</li><li>Various markets, prepackaged beans, various brands - very expensive (like, Whole Foods prices), not vacuum packed, and often the date has expired. Not okay</li></ul>I posted this 2 years ago; no response; and others have posted the same question and not found any solutions.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Or you can try Fresh Direct or Amazon.

Not a typo - 45 dollars. I didn&#039;t even bother to check whether you can buy by the ounce. <br />If I was going to travel 25 minutes and spend that kind of money - both of which have a zero likelihood of happening - I&#039;d at least go to some interesting part of town and not a hideous car dealer district.

				Kickshaw sells beans.&nbsp; Not sure if you can buy what you want/need or you have to buy the prepackaged bag (generally roasted within the last few days).&nbsp;

				If you&#039;re looking for bulk then coffeebeandirect.com is the place to go. Ok I know it isn&#039;t a local place, but their prices are competitive and they sell in bulk. As in only 1lb, 5lb and 25lb (yes 25 lb!!) packages. The coffee is roasted and packaged within 24 hours of being shipped to you and believe me you&#039;ll smell and taste it. We also used to buy our beans at Porto Rico in Manhattan but coffee prices have been through the roof lately and bulk purchase is the way to go. BTW if you buy 25lbs, or more, you get free shipping otherwise it&#039;s a flat shipping rate of $7.50. And no I am not a shill for them, just love their coffee.

				Thanks for the shout, King of LIC! And hi wildplanet, I&#039;m Dennis with Astoria Coffee. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m sorry to have left you hanging on this thread here, but we would in fact be happy to bag up any amount you&#039;re looking for. <br /><br /><br />Can I ask you to get in touch with me at dennis@astoriacoffeeshop.com if you&#039;re still interested in some beans? <br /><br /><br />Look forward to hearing from you! <br /><br /><br />Thanks, <br /><br /><br />Dennis<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
