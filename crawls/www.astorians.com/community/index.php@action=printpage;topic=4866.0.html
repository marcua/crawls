				Just read this interesting article (http://www.personaldemocracy.com/node/1224) on how well our politicians are doing online in the social networking realm.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">First, and perhaps the most newsworthy: Despite having a far less developed website and online team than the other top tier candidates, Barack Obama is leading the Democratic pack in terms of bottom-up enthusiasm online. He is beating Hillary Clinton, John Edwards and the rest of the Democratic pack across three of these four measures. <br /><br />As of Sunday, Obama had the most friends on MySpace (22,538), the largest number of wall posts, where Facebook members add comments on his official page in support of his candidacy (2,637), and the largest number of incoming blog links according to Technorati (2,988). Only on Flickr was he outpaced, by John Edwards (who had 1,590 photos with his name in the descriptive text, compared to 882 for Clinton and 798 for Obama). <br /><br />That said, Hillary Clinton is also doing very well online. Her MySpace page boasts 16,930 friends; on Facebook she has 2.240 wall posts; and her site has 2,222 incoming blog links. Edwards isn&#39;t that far behind, with 8,991 friends on MySpace (plus another 1,369 attached to his wife Elizabeth Edwards&#39; page, which is not an insignificant factor), 649 wall posts on Facebook and 1,318 incoming blog links. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is all really interesting to me as a decent chunk of my day job is focused on social networking. From what I&#39;ve observed in the last few months is that people on these sites really like to get involved with advocacy or to do something immediate online, so I can see MySpace, etc., being exactly the place that politicians should be right now to garner more support.

				I think you&#39;re right.&nbsp; I see a lot more political groups going online to organize and get folks information.&nbsp; Facebook seems the best online resource for political organizing, at least in my experience, but Friendster and myspace have some interesting groups as well.

				Thanks.<br />I love Personaldemocracy<br /><br /><br />Does Facebook have many users? Who owns that site?<br /><br />I find it intersesting that many political sites ask for contact information before even saying hello. Incredibly direct.<br /><br />

				What is personaldemocracy?<br />What political sites do you frequent?<br />I&#39;m not sure who owns Facebook, probably some horrible mega corporation, they seem to own all the others!

				It&#39;s open enrollment these days and the politicians have gotten really involved there.&nbsp; Best site I&#39;ve seen for political networking.
