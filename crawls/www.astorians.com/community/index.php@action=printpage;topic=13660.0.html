				11 supervisors charged (http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/14/11-con-ed-supervisors-charged-in-kickback-scheme)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Eleven Consolidated Edison supervisors were arrested Wednesday on charges they demanded more than $1 million in kickbacks since 2004 from a construction company on a number of jobs, in return for approving work that was never performed and guaranteeing faster payment for work that was performed.<br /><br />The supervisors — 10 current employees and one former employee — approved invoices for work that was never performed, or guaranteed faster payment for work that was performed, in exchange for the kickbacks, federal prosecutors said. Besides money, some of the men demanded other payoffs, including tickets to a New York Giants-Dallas Cowboys football game, a Blackberry Curve phone, a watch and sunglasses, the prosecutors said.<br /><br />The arrests were made after employees from the construction company wore a tape recorder that captured nine of the defendants demanding bribes of $1,000 to $5,000. Two retired Con Ed employees also wore recording devices. In all, 51 meetings in which the defendants received $80,000 in bribes were recorded.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What really caught my eye was a comment by a reader who is apparently a Con Ed employee. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This is not good for the company since we are in the middle of several audits and the rate case.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Erm, so, the supervisors shouldn&#039;t be prosecuted now because it&#039;s inconvenient for the co? When would be a better time for you?

				Well, they didn&#039;t demand a million up front. This has been going on since 2004. <br /><br />And if they did it with this company, they probably did it with others. <br /><br />Sadly this can&#039;t be blamed on Con Ed. But you never know, some more dirt might come out during the trial.

				This penny ante sh@t is really infuriating and just another example of our never ending descent into third worldism. The most moronic part is that these geniuses gave up six figure (or close) jobs for cell phones and tickets.&nbsp; Con Ed is no different from many corporations that size and they still are far better than the representatives that we fair citizens send to represent us in Albany and Washington.

				I&#039;m glad they got caught.&nbsp; And I hope this makes other people at least think twice before pulling stunts like this.&nbsp; These kind of things happen ALL the time in corporate America, government, etc.
