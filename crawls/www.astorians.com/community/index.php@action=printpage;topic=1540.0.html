				Hi Jayme,<br />This is a timely thread,&nbsp; I&#39;m going to Philly in a few weeks also.&nbsp; Going the b&amp;b route- Thomas Bond House .<br />http://www.winston-salem-inn.com/philadelphia/ &nbsp;(http://www.winston-salem-inn.com/philadelphia/)<br />&nbsp; <br />A mom-friendly place to go is the Reading Terminal Market, fun place to browse, shop, smell the baked goods etc.&nbsp; Supposed to be &quot; America&#39;s oldest farmer&#39;s market. &quot;<br />http://www.readingterminalmarket.org/<br /><br /><br />Another stop on the itinerary is the Mutter Museum of Medical Oddities.<br />http://www.roadsideamerica.com/attract/PAPHImut.html<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The gift shop should be interesting.&nbsp; :-o<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

				Where in Center City are you staying?&nbsp; It would help me make restaurant recommendations.<br /><br />Yes, Reading Terminal Market is a lot of fun.&nbsp; Two caveats, though: 1) it&#39;s closed on Sunday; and 2) if you&#39;re planning to eat lunch there (and you should), you ought to try to see everything first because otherwise you&#39;ll finish a delicious meal and two minutes later see another stand that would have offered you an even more delicious meal (depending on your tastes).&nbsp; Be sure to check out Mueller&#39;s chocolates if you go.&nbsp; It gets reeeeeally crowded and there&#39;s a lot of walking, just in case your mom isn&#39;t up to that.<br /><br />It&#39;s at 12th and Market.<br /><br />The Mutter Museum is great too,&nbsp; but I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s such a &quot;mom&quot; thing, unless your mom likes to be grossed out.<br /><br />Museums: If you want to visit museums, here&#39;s a guide by subject matter<br /><br />University (Of Pennsylvania) Museum: archaeology<br />Academy Of Natural Sciences: geology/biology/paleontology<br />Franklin Institute: earth and space science<br />Mutter Museum: medical oddities<br />Philadelphia Museum Of Art (a.k.a. &quot;th&#39; Art Museum&quot;): the kinds of stuff you would find at the met, plus cheesy Rocky-steps photo ops<br />Rodin Museum: um, Rodin stuff<br />Independence National Historical Park: enough colonial/early US history stuff to keep you happily busy for a month even if you don&#39;t think you&#39;re interested in history<br /><br />Regarding Capo&#39;s voluminous restaurant list: sadly I must inform you that Lombardi&#39;s pizza has closed (but then again you can get that in NYC).&nbsp; And I respectfully have to dissent from the Pat&#39;s Steaks recommendation.&nbsp; Go to Tony Luke&#39;s instead.&nbsp; The old traditional one is way, way down in South Philly on Oregon Avenue, but there&#39;s another one called Tony Jr.&#39;s in Center City, on 18th St. near chestnut.&nbsp; Pat&#39;s has kind of become a tourist trap--high prices, smaller sandwiches.&nbsp; Tony Luke&#39;s is the real deal.&nbsp; (and now you can get that in NYC, too)<br /><br />I&#39;ll say more about restaurants when I find out where you&#39;re staying and where you&#39;ll be for business.&nbsp; If you want a beverage after work, I heartily second a couple of capo&#39;s recommendations: Monk&#39;s (16th St. at Locust) for Belgian ales, and The Bards (Walnut St. btw 20th/21st) for relaxed Irish bar ambiance BUT ONLY IF YOU GO EARLY EVENING BEFORE THE COLLEGE STUDENTS INVADE.)<br /><br />More later.<br /><br />

				Wow, I&#39;m overwhelmed.&nbsp; I had no idea there were so many great looking things to do in Philly.<br /><br />Hotel is -- Philadelphia Marriott Downtown.<br /><br />I&#39;ve read up a bit on the running paths around the river.&nbsp; Any insight on those?&nbsp; How safe are they to run alone, in the early AM hours for instance?<br /><br />I&#39;ll have to start looking up museum hours and planning my agenda to get all this stuff in!&nbsp; Is there anything particularly fantastic that&#39;s open later (like after 5/6?).<br /><br /><br />cheers,<br />jayme
