				<strong>Former CEO Says U.S. Punished Phone Firm</strong><br />Qwest Feared NSA Plan Was Illegal, Filing Says<br /><br />http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/12/AR2007101202485.html?wpisrc=newsletter (http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/12/AR2007101202485.html?wpisrc=newsletter)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Former chief executive Joseph P. Nacchio, convicted in April of 19 counts of insider trading, said the NSA approached Qwest more than six months before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, according to court documents unsealed in Denver this week. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Nacchio&#039;s account, which places the NSA proposal at a meeting on Feb. 27, 2001, suggests that the Bush administration was seeking to enlist telecommunications firms in programs without court oversight before the terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon. The Sept. 11 attacks have been cited by the government as the main impetus for its warrantless surveillance efforts. <br /><br />The allegations could affect the debate on Capitol Hill over whether telecoms sued for disclosing customers&#039; phone records and other data to the government after the Sept. 11 attacks should be given legal immunity, even if they did not have court authorization to do so. <br /><br />Spokesmen for the Justice Department, the NSA, the White House and the director of national intelligence declined to comment, citing the ongoing legal case against Nacchio and the classified nature of the NSA&#039;s activities. Federal filings in the appeal have not yet been disclosed. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br /><br />I knew that the the &quot;war against terrorism&quot; was just a convenient excuse for warantless surveillance, this proves that the spying began even before the attacks on 9/11.

				I know FZ already made this point, but the guy has been convicted of 19 criminal counts.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure that he is the most credible source for &quot;proof&quot; of what the government did or did not do before 9/11.&nbsp; This is not to say that they weren&#039;t doing some kind of wiretaps.&nbsp; Maybe they were, maybe they weren&#039;t.&nbsp; But the source here is rubbish.<br /><br />Also, I think many of you don&#039;t fully understand the wiretaps program.&nbsp; It is only to be employed in exigient circumstances.&nbsp; Meaning people will die if surveillance is not done in the time that it takes to clear the warrant.

				I think the thing about wire tapping and arguements like it are that absolutist positions don&#039;t get you anywhere. I&#039;m sure we can find numerous examples of good use and bad use and one does not excuse or justify the other. We need to refine our definitions of appropriate use and be sure they are followed.<br /><br />So, like, do you think, they&#039;ll, y&#039;know, come after me an&#039; stuff, if my brother dies? Cause I did, like, totally tell him last night I&#039;d kill him if he touched my pumps.

				I wonder what would happen if people could direct their tax dollars towards services they believed in. There is certainly a wide enough array of views in this country to think that people would direct their funds to almost every aspect of government, and then lawmakers would have to work with the money available for any given program.

Why don&#039;t you let them know that you wish SS to disappear? Many seniors most certainly do depend on SS. I come from a generation of stay-at-home Moms, and when the bread winning husband/father either dies or disappears welfare saved many families from having to split up and ship children off to foster situations while Mom gets back on her feet. European countries would never allow their senior citizens to go hungry, or without proper shelter, or medical care including medicines appropriate for their needs . . . but here, in the good old US of A our seniors struggle from poverty not being able to keep up with the rising costs of everything from the basic food costs to staying on their medicines. I am intolerant of those who propose the elimination of public-funded services that keep families together and help older people maintain a healthy life. How we treat the poor and the elders of this country is a shame, if not a downright sin.<br /><br />Even though I did everything I was told to do, my finances went to hell with Enron and a few others and I was left with 50% of what I needed to make retirement comfortable. I personally would not be able to live if it weren&#039;t for my SS. What they need to do, however, is make it adjustable for where you live at the time you collect it. Someone in the midwest might live like royalty on what my monthly payments are, but here in NYC it simply is not enough to survive on, and every month I continue to spend down is one month less that I can live here, where I have spent my entire life. At this rate, I will be homeless in 10 years. <br /><br />Do any of you realize what it takes to get welfare, Medicaid or SSI in this country? Trust me, most of what you hear is myth or apocryphal.

				I&#039;m not literally for allowing people to opt out of their taxes. &nbsp;I was sort of making a modest proposal. &nbsp;If universal healthcare were to pass (I don&#039;t believe it will), I would be bound to contribute. &nbsp;Just as I am bound to contribute to other flawed government programs. &nbsp;Further, I do not believe in taking away safety nets for people in need. &nbsp;But I do believe in reining in entitlement programs. &nbsp;There will always be people who need help, but the government gives right now like Santa Claus. &nbsp;I have to agree with Lobber, need based aid makes much more sense.<br /><br />Also, I would posit that ALL universal health care systems have sucked for some reason or another. &nbsp;Doesn&#039;t matter what government runs them, or whether they are intended for minorities, non-minorities, martians, or whoever. &nbsp;My objection is not that I should be forced to pay for the lower strata of society, as I already do plenty of that through vicious and overused entitlement programs. &nbsp;My objection is that there is the potential for MY freedom of choice to be taken away so that someone else can have what I am sure will be substandard healthcare.<br /><br />And you&#039;d really only have to earn about a hundred grand to more than clear the upper 20 percent of income in the U.S. &nbsp;I intend to be earning at least that much, and I want to maintain the right to purchase my own healthcare services. &nbsp;I do not want to be locked into a government plan.

				Not trying to ruin this great debate, but do you think there should be another thread started and those posts that deal with the healthcare issues be moved?&nbsp; Otherwise, I am really having a great time reading this!&nbsp; I work for a &quot;non for profit&quot; private HMO that manages the medical care of people with Medicare and Medicaid in NYC so I have a little knowledge about the subject (just had to sit through some more training regarding the new 2008 Medicare eligibility guidelines).&nbsp; This is definitely more interesting!

				I understand this is an emotional issue, and as ALL families mine has problems too, which I don;t feel like airing, and I certainly didn;t grow up with silver spoons (mostly plastic ones), but I think you are all missing the point. &nbsp;I don&#039;t agree with entitlements across the board, but I don;t believe in dumping those who need help in the river. &nbsp;Where there is a need, a benefit will be given -- whether it&#039;s a healthcare, SS, or welfare need. &nbsp;I work hard, it took me a long time to get anywhere, I would rather keep my money and prepare for my own needs than to rely on a government program to be around to help me out. &nbsp;

Remember that you will be spending down from the day you retire, and depending on your investments, you might be paying taxes as you spend down your own money. From 30–45 you need to be VERY aggressive in your investments. They need to double in the 15 years you are investing in your future. From 45–60 you need to be a little more conservative and stay away from anything that might adversely affect your capital investment.

The Echelon program was in place well before GW became president.<br />To make it clear, I don&#039;t support random surveillance, but if someone is blaming the current administration, there is a strong likelyhood that your bias is showing.

				To the best of my best knowledge, the Echelon program, as well any investigation done by the NSA and FBI still required the approval by a FISA court judge prior to surveillance on a US citizen. Comparing any infractions of warrarantless surveillance before Jan 2001 to the ones made once Bush went into the White House is like comparing peas to watermellons.<br /><br />Blaming the current administration for systematically spying on US citizens without court oversight isn&#039;t bias, it is fact.

				Alex, I probably should have phrased it better and said that &quot;only&quot; blaming the current administration....<br />Echelon, and other NSA data mining did not require FISA warrants unless they were targeting US Citizens specifically.&nbsp; Also, the FISA standard is a pretty low one. If you are against government surveillance, I would think that you would want more than a secretive court&#039;s approval.<br />My real point is that when GW is out of the WH, the next Pres will continue and expand the program.

				I&#039;m not against all surveillance, but I am against surveillance without just cause and oversight, even if it is a government secret court. I just want to curtail abuses against people for personal or political purposes.<br /><br />I do not believe that whoever is Bush&#039;s successor will continue or expand the warantless surveilance programs. They need to roll back parts of the USA Patriot Act that infringe on abuses of privacy rights, especially by the executive branch of the government.
