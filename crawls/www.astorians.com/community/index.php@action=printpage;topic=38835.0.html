				such a bummer. believe its the liquor license. had an party scheduled for late October. they can&#039;t promise they&#039;ll be back up and running by the time of our event.&nbsp; signed the papers and everything. have an aunt flying in from Texas to be here for it. now we have to scramble to find a new place to affordably put 60 people and feed them and give them open bar.&nbsp; really like the space and the people who work there.&nbsp;

				Wha...they closed?? ;-(&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m confused though...you seem to say they closed because of a liquor license issue?&nbsp; Surely they already had their liquor license in order, since their biggest draw was supposed to their &#039;artisinal&#039; drinks?<br /><br />Anyway, I can&#039;t say I&#039;m totally surprised.&nbsp; I mean, their drinks were great, nice ambiance, and I always had good meals there, but I always thought the space was way too large, and I always wondered how they&#039;d be able to afford maintaining such a large restaurant ($$ rent).&nbsp; I never saw more than a handful of people in there...at least the times I went there.

The first was the one that was opened by the crack team that brought us Canz..You remember that place that brought all the excitement of a Hooters but not as classy. The place fell on its face, huge surprise, and was sold at a cut-rate deal to a guy who reopened FTE as a Irish bar sorta thing. That just didn&#039;t make it for the reasons mentioned above. So the crappy name and the ill-conceived size and scope of the place were all from the original founder.

				<br />It&#039;s a pity the guy didn&#039;t start with something smaller and more manageable.<br /><br />Their bartenders and drinks really were top-notch.&nbsp; I normally can&#039;t tolerate &#039;liquor&#039;...just beer or wine...but the one time I got a drink there, I told the guy my likes/dislikes, and he made something up for me...called El Guapo.&nbsp; It was really good.<br /><br />And the few times I went there to eat,&nbsp; the food was always solidly good.<br /><br />It was the kind of place I would feel very comfortable just saddling up to the bar alone and having a nice drink and contemplating (my) life.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; I don&#039;t know of any other place quite like FTE in the nabe?...as far as the bar goes?

				I totally agree. The last owner of the place did a really good job. The burger specials were amazing and the staff could not have been nicer. I hope they do something else in the nabe.
