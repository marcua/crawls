				&nbsp;Greater Astoria Historical Society<br />35-20 Broadway, 4th Floor, Long Island City, NY&nbsp; 11106<br />718-278-0700 www.astorialic.org (http://www.astorialic.org/)<br /><div align="center"> </div>KEVIN WALSH PRESENTS: The Village of Astoria<br />A Forgotten New York Lecture<br />MONDAY, February 4, 2013 @ 7:00 P.M.<br />An inlet in Astoria was named Halletts Cove after the family that moved to the land 360 years ago. However Astoria was named for a man who apparently never set foot in it: entrepreneur and real estate tycoon John Jacob Astor (1763-1848). Astor was the wealthiest man in America by 1840. (As it turns out, he could see the village from his home on what is now East 87th Street near York Avenue.) This presentation will take a look at Astoria Village, which is now vanishing quickly to new housing and development.&nbsp; Free to GAHS members, $5 to the public.<br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: Wingdings;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="bbc_size"> </span></span><br />EDWARD G. ROBINSON: LITTLE CAESAR (1931)<br />Saturday Afternoon at the Movies with G.A.H.S.<br />SATURDAY, February 9, at 1:00 P.M.<br />This year marks the 40th Anniversary of the death of Edward G. Robinson who is buried in Ridgewood, Queens. Little Caesar, released in January 1931, is Robinson&#039;s breakout movie – it catapulted him to stardom. It tells the story of a hoodlum who ascends the ranks of organized crime, and his inevitable downfall. Free!<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />KOREA: 60 YEARS LATER<br />The History Roundtable at G.A.H.S.<br />SATURDAY, February 16, at 1:00 P.M.<br />Some called the Korean War (or a ‘Police Action’ by a United Nations resolution) the last chapter of World War II, others, the opening salvo of the Cold War. Before it was over, millions of Koreans, North and South were casualties, and more than 120,000 American troops were either killed or wounded. Join us for a look back at America’s ‘Forgotten War’ of the 1950s on the 60<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the armistice ending hostilities. If you know of a Korean War Veteran, please encourage them to attend and share their experiences.&nbsp; Free to GAHS members, Veterans and their families, $5 to the public.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />FILM – A PRESIDENT’S DAY FAMILY EVENT: NIGHT AT THE MUSUEM<br />Family Day at G.A.H.S.<br />MONDAY, February 18, at 1:00 P.M.<br />A newly recruited night security guard at the Museum of Natural History discovers that an ancient curse causes the animals and exhibits on display to come to life and wreak havoc. Museum guard Larry (Ben Stiller) turns to a wax replica of President Roosevelt (Robin Williams) for a little advice on keeping things intact, but Teddy seems to think that a man of Larry‘s greatness needs little help. A discussion and tour of our artifacts follow the film. Bring the entire family. Popcorn and hot chocolate will be served! Free!<br />&nbsp;<br />VICTORIAN GOTHIC: A READING AND DISCUSSION<br />A New York Nineteenth Century Society Lecture<br />SATURDAY, February 23, 2013 @ 4 P.M.<br />Come and learn about old favorites and make new discoveries.
