				Makes for an awesome alliteration. <br /><br />The Bakeway folk of Broadway are renovating the Blockbuster space to turn it into a beer garden or was it a bbq joint? or ... both? <br /><br />I was told it would be open .... soon... that&#039;s relative right? Before summer anyway. <br /><br />

				I haven&#039;t seen anything going on in the Blockbuster space.&nbsp; Are they really working on it now?<br />&nbsp;<br />Also, does anyone know what became of the old bowling alley space under Blockbuster?&nbsp; Did the current tenants (I think a recording studio or something like that) rip out the lanes or has it remained intact?

				It won&#039;t be too welcome by residents who will have to deal with the noise.&nbsp; A place across street, which opened as restaurant but is actually club on weekends, has area going crazy over&nbsp; noise from blasting music on weekends. Now other side of street will have Beer Garden---they are going to be pissed.&nbsp;

				I passed by the old Blockbuster space on Broadway this morning and found the door open.&nbsp; A lot of work is going on in there.&nbsp; The place is totally transformed from the Blockbuster space, but a lot more work appears necessary before it opens to the public.&nbsp; It did look like they are doing quite a nice job in there -- wood paneled walls, etc.&nbsp; I wonder what their projected opening date is.&nbsp; It would behoove them to have it open as early in the summer as possible.

				I didn&#039;t know it was mandatory for a bar to have TVs. Sometimes I want to AVOID the sports scene and will pick a place that doesn&#039;t have that sports crowd. (I like sports...I just tend to get rowdy in that environment and sometimes I want some peace).

				Fair enough, I&#039;m just taking issue with the idea that this place is ready to open &quot;any day now&quot;, which has been said for a good 4-5 months. It&#039;s possible that they won&#039;t have TV&#039;s, but given the size, I would doubt it. Maybe some day it will open and we will see.

				Nah, I don&#039;t really care that much, I&#039;m just curious as to why it has taken so long. If you go back in this thread, they were supposedly ready to go in April. They missed all of summer, which seems strange to me. I hope it opens soon and I hope that it&#039;s a great spot, frankly.

				Yeah you would figure they would take advantage of the warm weather. I wonder why they still haven&#039;t fixed the sides of the store yet. There&#039;s like wood and parts that are sticking out.

				The discussion was about the noise and the smell specifically (but it&#039;s been over a year ago now), but I can tell you what he said at the time.<br /><br />At the time the owner (who also owns Bakeway) didn&#039;t want to piss anyone off (in the back, anyway) with any noise. They planted very tall bamboo in the back and put up a giant fence as noise-muffling things. He intended to be respectful of the neighbors with those measures. Some people were annoyed that the high fence was blocking their view and he promised to cut it down. The vision was sort of a beer garden/lounge/restaurant putside and a full-on restaurant in front.<br /><br />He didn&#039;t say anything at the time about music blasting out of the front; I&#039;ve walked by and heard it too though.<br /><br />He was also planning do the meat-smoking at Bakeway (recent construction in the Strand space seems to indicate that this is not the current plan, but I don&#039;t actually know, I don&#039;t work in the industry and am not sure what to look for). He assured us that he would have &quot;lazy man BBQ&quot; smokers and no one would ever smell it. <br /><br />FWIW, the kitchen at the Broadway Bakeway is impeccably clean and while I don&#039;t think running back and forth in the backyard between establishments with food is a good idea, I also don&#039;t think this will happen now.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know but I&#039;m not that worried. I am kind of deaf and I have a terrible sense of smell. Not to say that makes anything he does OK! I just don&#039;t think it will affect my life or most other peoples&#039;.<br /><br />

				There is a lot of concern from the neighborhood generated over this back Beer Hall ( which was supposed to be a family restaurant) and its &quot;garden.&quot; Not only is the garden for patrons, but it is also a thoroughfare for the food. The Strand&#039;s kitchen in in Bakeway, three stores down, So all service has to be transported through the &quot;garden&quot; which means&nbsp; NOISE for anyone abutting this space! YEp- CLanging pots and pans, workers cleaning up at 1am, bags of bottles crashing together... Along with the live music, the patrons in the garden, and the general issues of a 5000 sq for Hall that can hold &quot;several hundred&quot; drinkers, to quote the owner. Summer? We will screwed.<br /><br />Three residential buildings abut this bar, there is a canyon affect ( louder sounds ) as the talk from patrons bounces along the concrete and into windows. The owner pretty much told the neighbors that visited him whatever he thought would placate - NEVER mentioned live music. How this place was granted permits, without a kitchen, which means the garden functions as an outdoor workplace and a garden ( two noise generators) is beyond me. Does he have a caberet license for dancing? HMMM? GOing to find out!&nbsp; &nbsp;I read on why leave Astoria blog that the first night people were danging to the live bands which he never told the neighbors about. When the neighbors met with him, he said he wanted the garden to be for his workers, kind of a &quot;Zen garden&quot; How stupid does he think the neighbors are?? If it walks like a bar and talks like a bar - it&#039;s a bar!! And it holds several hundred! Monte across the street is a major noise generator and it is a sixth of the size. Now is the time to take action people. Don&#039;t wait till summer!<br /><br />

				Once they get opened, it is almost impossible to shut them down, or even to get them to make any changes.<br /><br /><br />Monte&#039;s, across street, has driven people on 33rd avenue crazy for 2 years, they blast incredibly loud music which mostly travels out back windows&nbsp; &nbsp; till 4 or 5 am every weekend, after saying they were opening&nbsp; a restaurant to get&nbsp; their permit.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />I was unaware of Beer Garden not having own kitchen.&nbsp; &nbsp;With till bands start playing, as I mentioned, I heard them test speakers, they are going to be heard not just by people in the two buildings behind place, but across street also.&nbsp;

				So I went on Wednesday as planned.&nbsp; And I can see the issues and sympathize.&nbsp; The kichen set up, as someone else mentioned, is unbelievable.&nbsp; I was out back for about 10 minutes and saw a poor employee go back and forth outside to the kitchen and back again over a dozen times.&nbsp; What a crazy arrangement!&nbsp; And this transporting of food to a heated steam table in the main area makes otherwise good food seem very unappetizing once it reaches its final destination.&nbsp; The other oddity is the service.&nbsp; Or lack of it.&nbsp; People behing the bar know varying bits of information about the beverages.&nbsp; Then there are a bunch of people working the floor.&nbsp; But get this, they do nothing except hand out water glasses and pick up empty glasses!&nbsp; They really need table service.&nbsp; If they can do it at Bohemian Hall, they can do it at this place.&nbsp; The good news is that I love the selection of beers, kombuchas, and especially the whiskeys and bourbons.&nbsp; The space is nice but they need something to hold people&#039;s coats.&nbsp; Like even hooks screwed into the table ends.&nbsp; I honestly can&#039;t see why they need that garden out back.&nbsp; Honestly, you can practically reach out and touch the windows of the apartments.&nbsp; It&#039;s not good at all.&nbsp; The interior space is huge.&nbsp; There should be no reason to let people outside and become a nuisance.&nbsp; And the zen like garden was pretty poorly built.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a small guy but I&#039;m not huge either.&nbsp; I sat down and the cheaply made bench broke underneath me.&nbsp; If they build a kitchen inside this place somehow and close the backyard to patrons, then this could be a nice situation.&nbsp; There are a lot of quirks about this place.&nbsp; Hopefully the owner and management will work things out so the customers are happier and the nearby apartments are happier.

				Obviously there are a number of issues with this place. Two of which are as follows. If I was going to eat at this place I would be concerned with the food being shuttled from two stores over in the cold of winter and hot of summer. Even if I don&#039;t eat there and was in the back yard drinking and smoking I would be concerned about police dropping in because neighbors will be calling cops every night for as long the restaurant management decides to be a bad neighbor.<br /><br />What I an say about the residents on the other side of Broadway...we are going to fight until we get what we want. I Feel bad for patrons because they are going to be caught in the middle. But make no mistake strand will not be a Monte if it continues to disrespect its community. We are going to enlist every possible resource in this.

				We went over here yesterday and it was...okay. Personally, I think the inside space is pretty great, I like the aesthetics, I love the reclaimed tables / benches (although the benches can get rocky if other people are sitting on them). I thought the covered space out front on the broadway side was a smart addition, since it allows smokers to go do their thing. I didn&#039;t venture out back, so I can&#039;t say too much about that, but it sounds like the lovely neighbors will take care of policing that area (quite literally it seems). <br />The beer list was solid, they had something like 15 taps, all of which were unique enough. The bourbon list was pretty solid, but I would say that, aside from their moonshine offerings (I don&#039;t like clear corn whiskey) there wasn&#039;t much that I haven&#039;t had a bottle of here at some point - which isn&#039;t saying much, honestly, I love trying new bourbons. The price was fair on all the drinks, which I appreciate. Beers were $6 a pop and bourbon was a little more $7 maybe?<br />I stopped by the food station, but when I read the offerings - last night the offerings were ribs, chicken, pulled pork and rib eye - nothing stood out at me. I had heard good things about the pastrami, and was bummed they didn&#039;t have it, and I could have filled up on some brisket as well. Somehow my wife went and asked and apparently they did have pastrami, so she came back with that, a biscuit, corn bread and creamed spinach. The pastrami was okay, the biscuits and cornbread tasted like they were out of the box, and the creamed spinach was overpoweringly creamy and not spinachy enough. I didn&#039;t know about the schlepping of food through hte backyard, although it probably wouldn&#039;t have bothered me too much, but based on the smell, I thought there was a pit in the large room. I guess not. It&#039;s served butcher style like many BBQ&#039;s all over the country, or like Hill Country, John Brown, or Fette Sau for local comparisons. With that in mind, I wasn&#039;t expecting table service, but was thrown off because when you come in, there&#039;s a hostess, who literally just tells you that the bar you&#039;re already looking at is right there, and that you can seat yourself. Overall, I&#039;d rather head to LIC to John Brown or into the city to Hill Country for food (not a fan of Fette Sau). <br />The last thing to touch on is the music, which is bluegrass for the most part. When they have music on, it&#039;s not bad. When the live band started (the band was pretty good, albeit with some schlocky &quot;drink more bourbon&quot; banter) the acoustic shortcomings of the space become apparent. There&#039;s nothing to absorb any sound, so the cavernous room tends to sounds like garbage, and the music sounds muddy. <br />I don&#039;t know, overall, I can see myself going back on those nights when I want to get drunk and wish I was in any number of southern cities, but have to make do with an Astoria knock off. I actually came home and kept drinking and put some Gram Parsons on the hi-fi. That said, there&#039;s room for improvement, and I hope they do improve, because the space is cool enough, although they slightly force the honkey tonk. With a little attention and some grease in the gears, I feel like this place could go from okay to good or even great, but they&#039;ve got a good starting point. <br /><br /><br />To translate for those who tend to judge a place by the following two criteria: Good for &quot;hipsters&quot;: Check. Good for &quot;transplants&quot;: Check. I feel like that will save some folks some wear and tear on their carpal tunnel.

				I&#039;m sorry but when you move to Astoria you should know what you&#039;re getting into. It&#039;s no longer sleepy Astoria. It&#039;s a happening changing neighborhood. It&#039;s a place mostly for young people,hipsters,trendy people,upwardly mobile folk and so on. So If you want peace and quiet than move to Maspeth,Middle Village and other sleepy NYC nabes. Heck you don&#039;t even have to move too far! Upper Ditmars is pretty quiet just ask Thanos27 It&#039;s perfect for families.

Upper Ditmars is pretty quiet just ask Thanos27 It&#039;s perfect for families.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Truth.<br /><br /><br />Astoria is changing, becoming younger and younger like the village, Broadway is a VERY BUSY Street and is NOT quiet EVER.&nbsp; I live on 30th Ave and nightly hear music, honking, arguments, trash trucks, cars squealing, kids out all hours of the night, ect. ect.....ITS NYC!&nbsp; It may be time to move for everyone worried about noise in NYC.<br /><br /><br />Astoria needs a place like The Strand for music, good beers, and good food with a nice vibe.&nbsp; It&#039;s no longer the sleepy greek/irish/croatian homes it was years and years ago.

				No, I&#039;m sorry McNugger, but Astoria is a residential neighborhood. And people do have a right to peace and quiet. And business<br />owners are required to respect the resident&#039;s rights to be able to enjoy their homes without having to worry every night whether or <br />not they&#039;ll be able to sleep and not have their nerves rattled nightly by unnecessary noise. <br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t have to move to another neighborhood. Business owners need to respect the community&#039;s residents and be considerate. <br />They can move elsewhere.

				I think both sides of the argument are right to some degree.&nbsp; This particular business, and others like it, should recognize how close they are to bedroom windows of nearby homes and apartments and try their best to be considerate.&nbsp; As I said, I don&#039;t see the real need for The Strand to have a backyard that offers nothing more than a space for people sit, talk, smoke, and be a nuisance to the nearby apartments.&nbsp; They have a really nice and huge indoor space.&nbsp; And there is a front yard area that should prove to be much less of a disturbance.&nbsp; So they should cut it there and try to be more neighborhood friendly.&nbsp; But McNugger is also right.&nbsp; Astoria is not a sleepy bedroom community.&nbsp; It&#039;s becoming more of a destination year to year.&nbsp; And 30th, Broadway, Ditmars, 34th, and 21st Street are all becoming rather hot dining and nightlife destinations and they will be busier and noisier as time goes on.&nbsp; And I, like McNugger, find those changes in Astoria to be exciting and energizing.&nbsp; If you <span class="bbc_u">choose</span> (because where you live is a choice, after all) to live in the heart of a business district, you cannot seriously expect peace and quiet.&nbsp; I think Astoria offers a very diverse selection of housing options for all wallets and lifestyles.&nbsp; If you live near a bar, then you can expect all the stuff that goes with it.&nbsp; But business owners can take some care to be polite to its neighbors without ruining the atmosphere of their business.

				Any restaurant / club / bar needs to follow existing laws and ordinances which regulate the amount of noise, nuisance, etc. that they cause. People who live nearby have rights no matter what kind of area it is.

				You&#039;re right, TJT. <br /><br />This is NY, I expect a certain amount of ambient noise. I used to live on 27th Street right by the on-ramp to the Triboro and there was always noise. And I can always get a white noise machine. I love my building, love my apartment and am willing to see what happens. <br /><br />It just makes me angry that this guy can be so thoughtless and disruptive. Just keep it inside!

				When I was there, they seem to do most of the initial prep and smoking next door.<br /><br /><br />They then bring it over to finish the cooking and prepping for whatever they are making that day.&nbsp; When I was there for brunch they made, what looked like, most of it right there in the establishment.&nbsp; Only going next door for a few things like the pastrami and what not that was probably coming out of a large smoker.<br /><br /><br />You ever smoke or BBQ outside your apartment or home?&nbsp; What&#039;s the difference if its literally a few feet out the back door and kept warm on seperate heating elements ect.?

				Post by: <strong>noloudnoise</strong> on <strong>November 27, 2012, 09:57:06 PM</strong>
			</dt>
			<dd class="postbody">
				For those who are conjecturing about the those of us who are living next to the new Strands backyard garden, here are the facts from someone who lives 10 feet away from the &quot;quiet zen garden&quot; promised by the owner.<br /><br />1) He is quoted in DNAInfo.Com as saying he wanted to make a family friendly place for mothers with strollers, yadda yadda yadda FALSE. Now we have hipsters out back drinking and smoking and talking loudly.Opening night featured a live band with loud music, dancing, drinking, rowdiness, and nary a stroller in sight.<br />2) Once again, quoted to be a family oriented restaurant for children and moms and dads to enjoy chicken and ribs. FALSE&gt; It is a full fledged whiskey bar WITH LIVE MUSIC. ( Never any mention of live music) AND dancing, Most likely without a cabaret license which is not legal). ( Already the blogosphere is alive with young hipsters telling each other how &quot;awesome dude! The bourbon and dancing are wild). Chicken and ribs my ass.<br />3) The place does not even have a kitchen. Food is ferried back and forth from BAKEWAY to THE STRAND in the open air garden at least 50 to 75 feet. There are pidgeons and other birds sitting right above the heavy steel sliding doors which bang shut every 60 seconds which could defecate in the food, not very healthy. It&#039;s raining tonight, what happens when it snows, or when the wind blows dust and dirt around.&nbsp; Just not very healthy at all.And the place calls itself a restaurant but it DOESN&#039;T EVEN HAVE A KITCHEN. Oh I said that already. Just call it what it is, a bar/club. If it looks and smells like a pig.......... <br />4) 40 to 50 feet of bi-folding glass doors which were supposed to be closed at all times and no hanging heavy velvet curtains to mitigate the sound of the sound system which was going to play &quot;smooth jazz in the background&quot;. Or so people we led to believe. Last Friday night we all came home to the loud strains of a LIVE BLUEGRASS band and the doors where wide open and people outside smoking and drinking.<br />5) There was talk he was going to close the &quot;garden&quot; at 11PM , a so called &quot;reasonable hour&quot;. ( reasonable unless you have to&nbsp; go to work at 6 AM and go to sleep by 10 and have kids etc), but on opening night and subsequent nights tenants have witnessed people outside&nbsp; drinking and smoking at 11:30PM, 12:00AM 2:30 AM etc. Not so reasonable when you are trying to get to sleep to get up for the early morning meeting or the baby is cranky and won&#039;t go down because of the noise. <br />6) He is storing his beer kegs, food carts and other metal materials out back as well where his workers bang them around constantly day and night. Mind you this is affecting over 120+ apartments which are within 10 to 15 FEET of this space. In some cases the fence to his garden is just 5 to 6 feet away from someones windows!<br />7) In the same DNA Info story he is quoted as saying he wants to be a good neighbor but he is anything but. He promised the local tenants who live right&nbsp; behind him, who watched his project going up, and even wished him success, that he would be a good and conscientious neighbor.<br />8) We are not looking to close down the restaurant, we just don&#039;t want 100 plus hipsters hanging out 10 feet from our BEDROOM windows smoking, drinking, yelling, talking loudly and generally getting rowdy. We don&#039;t want to have to hear his workers banging beer kegs around, or slamming heavy steel doors shut every 60 seconds for hours on end every day and night. We simply want our peace and quiet back. That&#039;s all. We are entitled under the law to a certain quality of life. That&#039;s what the NYC Noise Code was established for by Lindsay and them amended by Bloomberg to make it stronger. Noise pollution is the number one complaint to 311 in the city. We don&#039;t want to add to the statistics. The police have greater problems to solve.<br />&nbsp;<br />So the truth be told, he is not being a neighborhood friendly owner nor establishment at present. Think of what is going to happen in the summer when the tables out front (forget the back!) are filled with loud noisy eaters,&nbsp; drinkers,and smokers. Think of the hoards of people who will come on the weekends to listen to live bands hanging out on YOUR streets, blocking your path, puking on your sidewalks, getting rowdy in front of your kids as you walk on by. Those big glass doors will be wide open. All the noise and music will be spilling out and it will not just be the people who live behind the garden, but the those who live across the street who already have to deal with Montes. <br /><br />We are all for progress but at what price? There has to be a happy medium here somewhere. If the owner is not willing to work with the neighborhood to find it, then the neighborhood should not work with him by supporting his businesses. <br /><br />I beg all who are reading this. If you are affected by this , call 311 , go to your local community board leader, go the local precinct and ask for the community affairs officer and tell him what you have witnessed, your concerns etc, take fotos, videos, recordings, call consumer affairs, call the SLA, do not sit down and take it! This is OUR community. It is a residential community. It is, WAS, nice and quiet and peaceful and safe. Don&#039;t let him turn this into Jersey City or Dumbo, or SOHO, . We LIVE HERE. For those of you who are NOT affected, please take pity on those of us who are living with what is slowly turning into our worst nightmare. Please support us in any way you can. Tell your neighbors, help those of us who are most affected.&nbsp; <br /><br />There already is a small but growing band of neighbors who are beginning to take action. You can too by doing some of the things I mentioned above. Our little band is growing and will grow larger and stronger. Again, we don&#039;t want to shut the restaurant down, we want to be good neighbors too. We are all for a safe, thriving, healthy neighborhood too, we just don&#039;t want to have a beer garden or a whiskey hangout for 100 to 200 people right under our bedroom windows at night. Is that too much to ask for??<br /><br />My Apologies for any typos:) I&quot;m a tad passionate about this and not a very good typist and an even worse editor!<br />

				I&#039;m amazed at how this particular business and others are getting these permits for residential areas. <br /><br /><br />This also goes for new residences that are going up as well. A new building was put right next to my apartment building. <br />Originally the space was a 2 or 3 family house that had been split into several apartments. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m on the 3rd floor of my building and the house probably came up to the 2nd floor. But it never blocked anyone&#039;s view - <br />there was also a backyard garden and a lot of trees and shrubs which were nice to look out on. <br /><br /><br />The house was sold last year, torn down and a new building constructed. This monstrosity was allowed to go up 4 floors <br />and completely blocks the windows in my kitchen and living room&nbsp; - the 2 rooms I spend most time in. <br /><br /><br />Now I&#039;m in darkness all the time. <br /><br /><br />During construction, as I saw the structure rising, I too contacted Vallone&#039;s office to ask how this could be allowed. <br />No response. I e-mailed too - no response. The permit on the DOB website for the structure said 2 family house. <br /><br /><br />Well, just check it out at the corner of 30th Road &amp; 29th St. and tell me that&#039;s a 2 family house. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m sorry to rant and stray off the original topic, but my point is that these permits for construction are being obtained<br />and no thought seems to be given for the existing residents, businesses, etc. that are negatively affected. <br /><br /><br />Ruining one&#039;s quality of life is not progress.

				As long as The Strand has the necessary permits and is abiding by law, the best one can do is organize and petition and protest. You can&#039;t expect a neighborhood not to change over time, especially a residential neighborhood. That&#039;s a risk you&#039;ve already accepted when moving into the area.<br /><br />And as for new construction, again if it&#039;s legal and the previous owner could only afford to build a 2 story, but the new owner can afford to, needs to, or wants to build a 4 story, then again that&#039;s a risk you&#039;re taking when moving next door.<br /><br />Everything changes... Sometimes for the best and sometimes for the worst. Loud noise in your backyard, may mean more entertainment options for the locals, more traffic in Astoria, more jobs in Astoria etc. It&#039;s a give and take.

				I live in a building where its backside faces the back of a bar/club and a few years ago it constructed a back yard.&nbsp; Although, smaller in scale, this is the same situation as the back patio of the Strand. Our bedroom window was right above this yard and we heard every word of conversation (and were inundated with a constant cloud of smoke) of these obnoxious clubbers.&nbsp; &nbsp;I did lots of research as to what actions I could take, but ultimately I couldn&#039;t do much about it because the area, despite abutting apartment buildings, is zoned as commercial.&nbsp; If we hadn&#039;t moved to an apartment across the hall (to the street side), we would have moved out of the building.&nbsp; This is to say, that I feel for these residents living behind The Strand, but I wonder what kind of zoning is in that area (forgive me if I&#039;ve missed it somewhere earlier in this thread).&nbsp; If the zoning is commercial this may be a huge uphill battle if the owners refuse to make some very reasonable adjustments to their layout and practices.

				Let me be frank: The Strand is cool. It looks great and it&#039;s the kind of thing yuppie/hipster types like me enjoy. If I weren&#039;t boycotting it (more on that in a minute) I&#039;d love to hang out, have a beer, and see a band. I&#039;m not at all worried about loud drunks walking down Broadway; that&#039;s been happening for years.<br /><br />Now, about that boycott: the back garden has got to go. It&#039;s a crazy way to run a restaurant and it&#039;s incredibly noisy. (Yes, my apartment is one of the ones that abuts the garden. It&#039;s not directly behind it, but the noise carries.) It&#039;s unnecessary and totally unfair to good people who just want a decent night&#039;s sleep. The owners have got to cover it up in a soundproof way or come up with a different system for transporting food. Until that happens -- no Strand or Bakeway for me. (And I *love* Bakeway!)

I didn&#039;t want eggs, I wanted MEAT! and they were out of the pork belly side (that I was going to order 4 of)<br /><br /><br />We ordered brunch and we were given 4 luke warm to outright cold plates of food (with the exception of the Duck Confit which was warm but served on a pile of cold).&nbsp; Our server came to the table, asked if she could take our order and quite literally ran away as we said yes (not that she was busy... she was ... ??? skittish???)

Soon after we told her about our cold food she disappeared.&nbsp; Completely.&nbsp; Totally.&nbsp; Said she&#039;d tell the manager and poof she was gone.&nbsp; Another waitress finished up with us and we were told ours went home... <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m not posting this negative review b/c I&#039;m angry... actually I want nothing more than this place to succeed.&nbsp; But to succeed AND to be a good neighbor.&nbsp; And to be kid friendly and to have good BBQ and good service... I want everything about this place to be good.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />In the meantime... there were 4 adults at our table and 3 kids.&nbsp; A crazy waitress and cold (tasty) food.&nbsp; They recently opened and they were pretty quiet while we were there... not one time did a manager come over and say hello, ask if everything was okay... as I write this... and as I read the post about this NOT being what the owner made it seem like it was going to be..<br /><br /><br />I was happy that it wasn&#039;t going to be like the Euro Cafes on 30th... all glitter and thumping music.&nbsp; &nbsp;Eye candy, coffee and bad food.&nbsp; It may just be.. same baby, different (really different) dress.&nbsp; (with whiskey instead of coffee of course) . <br /><br /><br />What a bummer.... maybe I&#039;ll start a new thread... <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hey jennifer...you want to know why your food is cold, I will tell you why. The strand smokehouse doesn&#039;t have a kitchen. They use bakeway&#039;s kitchen - two stores down. So they have have to shuttle&nbsp; the food over shortly after your order or before and let it sit around. they don&#039;t use any special care, just some poor employee with a tray or metal rolling cart. Food is expose to elements and mother nature including birds and pigeons. I know this because I see the employees going in and out through the backyard. I have some pictures if you want to see but maybe I should send them instead to the health dept. <br /><br />You know you are right....you started this blog post and its unfair that we took it over and all we do is complain about our issues so I maybe I will start a new blog post.

				Yeah, it sucks to live in the nabe next to this place. The smell of smoked meat, however nice it might be at times, is not nice all the time. I no longer open my windows.&nbsp; The Village Voice reviewer notes that it will probably be pretty awful in the summer and I don&#039;t doubt it. Wish the owner had thought about the locals but I guess that&#039;s asking too much and wasn&#039;t on his agenda at all since he put a garden right behind this already massive beer hall. A few people out there and it&#039;s LOUD.&nbsp; I did read from one poster that the Bohemian cares about the locals so it is possible, but I just don&#039;t see how this is going to work. It&#039;s surrounded by apartments so close.

				we stopped by on Sunday and despite the issues this place is causing for some locals and the obvious food flaws, it was jammed.&nbsp; I was honestly surprised at how many people there were - families, singles, groups, etc. - on a sunday evening ~8pm the night before new years eve.&nbsp;

From my apt i have a clear view of the back of the place and a about 3 or 4 tables. The last few nights they have been particularly empty even on New Years eve, even though they marketed their new years eve party all over the place. Granted, i just looked out a few times a night but that is my view from a window.
