				Old Men Bars and Dive&#039;s share many common characteristics....<br /><br />1. Little to no investment in appearance since inception.<br />2. Several different mismatched stools at bar.<br />3. Weird bathroom often accompanied with an unusual smell.<br /><br />The clientele and music/jukebox are what really make the difference.<br /><br />As for Club 23, I&#039;d only go in there (again) if I was wearing a full body latex suit. <br /><br />I think Sparrow qualifies as a Dive candidate.....thoughts?

They&#039;ve paid attention to every bit of decor in that place and you know it. While the bathrooms are weird, the rest of the place is very well thought-out.<br /><br />Plus, you don&#039;t ever see any real bar flies or dive bar types in there. It&#039;s just hipsters. I took a friend there once who is 33 and he said he felt too old to be there. I think Sparrow is actually pretty posh, especially if you look at their food menu, drink prices and beer list.

Anyone ever been to the Gaslight in Sunnyside or Saint and Sinners in Woodside? Those are the kind of pubs I am taking about. Gilby&#039;s just doesn&#039;t cut it. <br /><br />Personally I don&#039;t like the Sparrow. I agree with you Para- I think the &quot;Sparrow&quot; tries too hard. <br /><br />

				http://newyork.citysearch.com/profile/36694496/new_york_ny/patriot_saloon.html<br />The Patriot Saloon is down near the WTC site.&nbsp; They offer a refreshing pitcher of Pabst Blue Ribbon (Pabst won the blue ribbon during the 1893 World&#039;s Columbian Exposition for best beer) for a mere $5.&nbsp; They have additional inexpensive pitchers including Yuengling for a mere $7.&nbsp; If you ask nicely, the bartenders, most of whom were previously employed as exotic dancers, will serve up hot dogs, sliders and other snacks for a low cost, but that exact cost escapes me, as the food at The Patriot Saloon is best consumed when your body contains enough alcohol to counterbalance any potential side effects of eating there.

				I think a criteria for a dive/old man bar is that they have to &quot;crappy,&quot; pardon the pun, bathrooms. &nbsp;None of the air freshner, fancy pump soap and lotions stuff in these bars. &nbsp;<br /><br />For example, the men&#039;s restroom at Patriot bar doesn&#039;t even have a lock on the door and you don&#039;t want to actually &quot;touch&quot; anything inside. &nbsp;

				FLEMINGS!!! It always smells like Urinal Cakes!<br /><br />I don&#039;t feel that the Rover is a dive bar.&nbsp; A dive bar generally consists of a corner of unused/broken furniture(...aka Flemings/Glenn Oaks-ish) with a flair of cobweb appeal (The Rover does have this -just check the hanging image above the bar) and riff raff that is considered sub par (The &#039;tenders are good about getting rid of those most of the time).&nbsp; The Rover is more a &#039;Cheers&#039; bar, once you go there, you&#039;re bound to make friends, get drunk easily and leave feeling either happy and joyous.<br /><br />P.S. The Rover has been smelling lately.&nbsp; One time it smelled like stinky socks.&nbsp; The other time like someone wretched all over the place.&nbsp; Perhaps it&#039;s the Old Man stench or the hipsters haven&#039;t showered?

				You don&#039;t need food at dive bars - if you&#039;re hungry just call some place to deliver.&nbsp; <br /><br />There is a dive a block and a half east of Astoria Manor.&nbsp; We were halfheartedly chaperoning a prom there last year - but there weren&#039;t enough seats for all the grown-ups who showed (and no booze) so we went in search of a bar.&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember the name - but go east and it&#039;s the first one you come upon.&nbsp; <br /><br />There were few patrons - but little by little the place filled up .... but not from the front door.&nbsp; Couples seemed to be coming out of the back somewhere.&nbsp; A man would come out... a little while later and woman would appear and come sit at the bar.&nbsp; And then it happened again.&nbsp; One of the women who appeared from the back room seemed to be dressed in belly dancing gear.&nbsp; so I asked her if she was going to dancing that night... and she said - yes - but not as a belly dancer it turned out.&nbsp; And not as a professional... sometimes she just ended up dancing at (on? ) the bar.... <br />anyway... we decided they were running a brothel out of there.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was quite an <em>interesting </em> crowd.&nbsp; Even more so - when we dragged 6 more teachers in from the prom.&nbsp; <br /><br />I dont think you should need recommendations on dive bars... the best thing to do is grab a friend and head to the least pretentious looking place you can find.&nbsp; Sit at the bar.&nbsp; Talk to the bartender and the locals....drink too much.. have&nbsp; a great time.&nbsp; And then keep it to yourself if you want the place to remain low key &quot;cool.&quot;

				Hmm...I&#039;m a little surprised at the loose definition some people have of a dive bar. <br /><br />Dive bars are dirty, dark, smelly and cheap. The only reason to go to them is because you don&#039;t have much money, you don&#039;t care where you&#039;re drinking and you don&#039;t care much about your personal safety overmuch or you&#039;re under 21 because they don&#039;t card and don&#039;t care. You would never in a million years eat the food there, even if it was free. One of the previous posts description about dive bathrooms (no doors on stalls, smells like barf, unclean) I&#039;d consider applicable. Really, I can&#039;t imagine anyone on these boards wanting to go to a real dive bar. <br /><br />I&#039;ve only been to one in this city which was right off of the N/W 59th st. stop. That was about 3-4 years ago when I had some friends who were under 21 that wanted to go drinking. There was an entire table of kids drinking there that looked like they were in high school and the entire place looked like it had a film of grease and dirt on it. The bathrooms were a joke. The worst part is the drinks weren&#039;t even that cheap! This dive was closed last I checked.<br /><br />Irish rover would never in a million years be classified as a dive bar, or Doyle&#039;s corner for that matter. I&#039;d call them more old men&#039;s bars during the day. Most Irish pubs with older bartenders are old men&#039;s bars during the day. Not dive bars.

				<br />Do dive bars have doors in the bathrooms?<br /><br /><br />Maybe some local corners are fine, but some places you should never have stepped into the first place.<br />You know right away.

				In smaller towns, I&#039;d say yes - dive bars usually stick around for a long time for whatever reason. I have no idea about in NYC. <br /><br />I think the best way to tell if a bar is a dive bar or not is ask yourself: Would you call this place a filthy rat-infested hole? If not, you are probably not in a dive bar.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Mike

				The old Sparrow was a dive bar.&nbsp; The new Sparrow had remnants of a dive bar in that its bathroom door had a huge hole in it, which they taped up with grey duct tape and cardboard.&nbsp; This tape kept falling off and you had to pee and hold the cardboard up at the same time, or risk exposing yourself, which may have been ok in a dive bar anyway.&nbsp; It also had the sink outside the bathroom with the soap poured into an old Poland Spring water bottle with no top.&nbsp; This was how it was last October, and I sincerely hope they have fixed it.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been back since but not because of that.&nbsp; Just because I have not had occasion to go.&nbsp; If they haven&#039;t fixed it though, I&#039;ll be staying away until they do.&nbsp; You can&#039;t renovate a bar, and then go half-ass on the bathrooms.<br /><br />There are plenty of bars in the city that would make dive status.&nbsp; I usually hate them.

Usually if you&nbsp; were underage or looked it, you just didn&#039;t go into those places. They are all gone now, but there was one place, I forget the name ( if it had one) where the owner/bartender was 75, I know it cause he told me, had been running the place ever since his old man died 40 years before. So he went from being a lawyer to a bar owner. Even he himself called it a dive! But the drinks were cheap, talk was easy and so were the women... Gawd I sound like Hunter Thompson! The place closed when he dropped dead one night after last call.&nbsp; Now it&#039;s a nursing home or something.&nbsp; Oh and technically there was no bathroom. If you wanted to &quot;go&quot;, you went out the back door and took a piss in the alleyway behind the bar. Only food was from the White Castle on Queens Blvd.

Honestly, I think a bars ability to change with the times keeps it from becoming a dive -that and the love and care of the establishment by the owners and patrons.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				<br />I agree that the rover is a pretty nice bar and not a dive.<br /><br />they have more then 4 beers on tap, and one of those super-advanced downloading jukeboxes.<br /><br />glen oaks is the diviest bar i&#039;ve been to in the hood, with flemings a close second.<br /><br />ok, an honorable mention to mccaffrey and burke next to indigo.<br /><br />it always has that mens room smell to it, but the bartender there vinnie is one of the best in town!
