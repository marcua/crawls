				Ho ho ho!<br />Here is information about SantaCon! <br />If you have never heard about SantaCon! It’s an event that is zanny, wild, and just damn fun!!!<br /><br />http://www.santarchy.com/archives.html<br /><br />Get together with tons of peope you know and dont know to create a huge Santa Mob going around manhattan!!<br /><br />What is Santacon?<br />It's a not-for-profit, non-political, non-religious &amp; non-logical<br />Santa Claus convention. We do it for absolutely no reason whatsoever.<br />SantaCon happens in major cities all over the world. NYC SantaCon 1998<br />was a blissful three-day affair with more than 100 Santa's flying in<br />from all over the country as NYC hosted the national event. SantaCon<br />1999 was extremely successful with one longer day and approximately 80<br />dirty Clauses. SantaCon 2001 was a single day condensed non-stop<br />blowout with over 150 red suits of naughtiness! 2002 was chock-full of<br />bars, parties, subway rides, shock appeal, dirty xxx-mas carols,<br />jingle balls, elf insubordination, Harry Hanukkah, and non-stop<br />ho-ho-hos, with plenty of visitors from around the globe, many friends<br />from L.A. and SF to boot. And last year, with close to 400 Santa's, we<br />wowed them in Grand Central &amp; roamed across Harlem &amp; caroled outside<br />the Apollo Theater. &nbsp;There were stripping Santa's in the East Village<br />and bowling reindeer games in Central Park all accompanied by the<br />usual decadence and debauchery only residents of the North Pole could<br />appreciate.<br /><br />This year, Santa's will back with a new naughty &amp; demented list of<br />places to wreck havoc on. So get the reindeer and sled ready, cause<br />it's going to be a bumpy ride. We may visit some of the traditional<br />Santa haunts and some new ones as well.<br /><br />Here is the 2004 411 from Santa...the day is Saturday December 11th.<br />Expect to start in the morning around 11AM. A hotline number will also<br />be available if you want to try to catch up with the Santa's, mid<br />rampage. Santa highly recommends spending the whole day until<br />midnight, when you will be delirious and exhausted and you'll be<br />shouting at strangers or mumbling to yourself and the whole thing gets<br />blurry and you wake up the next day in a gutter in the South Bronx.<br /><br />This venerable tradition is almost a decade old, and makes flash mobs<br />look like sitting at home watching C-SPAN. &nbsp;Picture archive at<br />http://www.santarchy.com/archives.html<br /><br />How to be prepared:<br />Definitely bring some money and ID. &nbsp;It's not uncommon for a<br />spontaneous chant of &quot;Santa Needs A Beer!&quot; to initiate the invasion of<br />a bar. Or also times when &quot;Santa needs sophisticated adult<br />entertainment&quot;<br /><br />A bottle of water and some snacks is a good idea.<br /><br />If you bring your own alcoholic beverages PLEASE be respectful of the<br />bars Santa is being allowed to enter and don't drink it IN the bar.<br />Drinks will be cheap at most of the bars we'll be invading so you may<br />not even have to bring your own, unless you're like Santa and have a<br />lifetime membership to AA.<br /><br />Comfortable boots are a good idea.<br /><br />Dress warm, it will probably be very cold and we will be marching<br />around outside at many points of the day. There will be some points<br />indoors where you will suddenly be overdressed. There is nothing wrong<br />with Santa stripping.<br /><br />Bring your &quot;Holiday Spirit&quot; as you understand &quot;Holiday Spirit&quot;, which<br />is to say Santa's are encouraged to let loose, be obnoxious, make a<br />mockery of the holiday, act in a confusing, disorienting &amp; demented<br />manner to holiday shoppers . . . BE SURLY. Yell. Sing naughty carols.<br />Experiment with interpretive dance in front of traffic. But on the<br />other hand do not leave all your good judgment behind. Be aware and<br />try not to do the obscene stuff in front of children, try not to make<br />people feel unsafe, and don't get sent to the hospital or jail. OK?<br /><br />Bring gifts you can give out. If you want, bring naughty gifts to give<br />grown ups. If you want, bring nice stuff to give kids. If you want,<br />bring coal to give evildoers. It's all up to you, Santa.<br /><br />YES! YOU MUST BE wearing Santa/holiday/whatever theme wardrobe. Yes!<br />You can come dressed as an elf/snowman/reindeer/Chanukah Harry/A<br />Sandwich. But you gotta be something and be the hell out of it. No<br />spectators allowed. NO! A Santa hat is not enough. Get a Santa suit.<br />Make a Santa suit. Transform those red long johns. If you don't have<br />any creativity, buy something. If you don't have any money, be<br />creative. If you don't have any money and you don't have any<br />creativity, slap yourself three times and ask god to help you.<br /><br />Note: You get what you pay for in a Santa suit. $10 suits are made of<br />thin, cheap flannel that won't keep you warm and will rip in the<br />crotch. Nuff said.<br /><br />2004 Santa Suit Sources:<br />There are bunches of costume shops and places to get Santa suits in<br />NYC. &nbsp;Santa is compiling an updated list of those stores and Santa<br />will be releasing it in the next day or two for you non-Santa suit<br />owning heathens.<br /><br />If you have ANY questions whatsoever email Santa at<br />santacon.nyc.2004@gmail.com and expect to be belittled and berated.<br /><br />HO HO HO HO!!!!!!!<br /><br />Be Well,<br />Be SANTA…<br /><br />---Brought to you by your local Santa----
