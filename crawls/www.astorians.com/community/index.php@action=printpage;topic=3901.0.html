				Hey everyone. I&#39;m a fiction writer and I am looking for someone to read my stories and give me feedback--and of course I&#39;ll do the same for you. It would be cool if we could have our own Algonquin roundtable here in Astoria...anyone interested?

				There used to be something like this at Freeze Peach - the fiction collider. <br /><br />You could go to the cafe, grab whatever stories/poems were left in a box, read and critique them - then return them to the box and leave your own as well for others to critique. I got pretty good feedback on some poems I left. They might be willing to revive it.

				Hi all,<br /><br />I&#39;ve written two full manuscripts for potential novels.&nbsp; The first has been edited and is in the rewrite stage, the second needs some major repairs, such as a coherent ending (those help).&nbsp; I have ideas for a third novel (ideas presently in the form of 2,100 scattershot words), and I plan to participate in National Novel Writing Month (all of November): http://www.nanowrimo.org<br /><br />Let&#39;s see... I intermittently write freelance for a magazine group located in L.A. (paid, thankfully), and I&#39;m an editor with an indie press based out of Portland, OR.&nbsp; I&#39;m compiling and editing a short story anthology for them right now, actually, titled &quot;Falling From the Sky&quot;... give us a visit at http://www.anothersky.org.&nbsp; It&#39;s a highly worthwhile venture - a different kind of publishing paradigm - and I hope to have the aforementioned first novel out with them next year...<br /><br />All of that said, [sigh] I do have a day job.&nbsp; <br /><br />And I would be happy to exchange works of fiction, be it short story or novel chapters/excerpts.<br /><br />-Craig.

				I&#39;m doing nanowrimo too.<br /><br />And I dislike sharing.<br /><br />But I have been known on very special occassions in a particularly giving mood to hand around a copy of this that and the other.<br /><br />If all goes well one of these special moments might happen at the end of November post-novel.&nbsp; It might be fun to check in again then and see if anyone wants to share the fresh stuff.<br /><br /><br />cheers,<br />jayme

				So what about arranging a time and place to swap stories? It could be a weekly thing, where we would trade stories and meet up the next week to give the stories back with comments and trade again. No huge time comittment necessary, just a quick hi-bye and trade...anyone who&#39;s interested, email me: proud_ophelia@hotmail.com and we can discuss time/place/etc. my name is beth.
