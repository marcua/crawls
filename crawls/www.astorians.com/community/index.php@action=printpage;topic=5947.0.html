				Hey, if you know what that&#039;s from and you are looking to either move to Astoria, find a new aparment or get someone to take a room in your apartment at some time during this summer, we should talk.<br /><br />I am currently living in Astoria near 30th Ave &amp; Crescent. I love that area and would love to either stay in the 30th Ave/Astoria Boulevard area. I am open to almost anywhere in Astoria, though.<br /><br />I have a reliable job and I&#039;ve never been late with bills or anything like that. I&#039;m not a neat freak, but I do the dishes and I don&#039;t mind cleaning a bathroom. I&#039;m a bit cluttered, but I like to have common areas clean.<br /><br />I am pretty social, but am still very new to New York. I&#039;m a pseudo-writer (I try to do it often, and I enjoy it, but I&#039;m no JD Salinger) and it would be really great to live with someone that does &quot;art things&quot; and that would be up for going out with me every now and then or inviting me to tag along when they&#039;ve got cool plans. My favorite housemates have been people who were filmmakers, painters, musicians--mostly, I really like people who have something that they do that they really care about.<br /><br />I&#039;m probably going to post on craigslist, but I was hoping for an Astorian (yay!) and I would like to meet people and find a living situation that would be good for all involved. Ideally, I would want to find a place in the beginning of July, but I could wait until later or could go earlier. If I can find a good place, person and situation, I can make pretty much any date this summer work out.<br /><br />So, if you&#039;re interested, or if you have a friend who might be interested, or you hear someone read a really awesome poem at a sweet open mic and finish by saying that they really need a hip roommate, tell me and tell them:<br /><br />Fight on, fight on, dear old Muncie<br />Fight on, hoist the gold and blue<br />You&#039;ll be tattered, torn, and hurten<br />Once the Munce is done with you<br />Go... Eagles! <br />

				I am not looking to change my living situation but LOVE that movie (especially since I grew up 10 minutes from Muncie!)

				Good to know there are other Eagles in Astoria!<br /><br />And congrats on having a good living situation worked out--that stuff is hard. Keep me in mind on the offhand chance you run into somebody cool or hear from a friend that they need a place or a body in a place.<br />

				Thanks, enigma &amp; CJ. Let me know if you hear anything.<br /><br />Turns out that I&#039;ll probably be shooting for a new abode June-ish. I&#039;d rather sublet with an option to stay than just sublet and get booted again. <br /><br />Thanks again.
