				One of the best bits of advice I ever got was this, &quot;when someone is offensive, assume they mean no harm and simply have pathetic communication skills.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />I thought it was interesting that miscommunication is chalked up to egomania on the part of the writer - the inability to separate their own perspective from other peoples.&nbsp; I think this doesn&#39;t just apply to email.

				I like to practice the zen adage &quot;take nothing personally&quot; -- because even if the intention is snarky, eh, I just don&#39;t need to be bothered by that kind of sillyness.<br /><br />It&#39;s really helped a lot in work perspective.&nbsp; Since I work at home 95% of the time, the majority of my office communication if via email/IM/fax -- which leaves me with a lot of interpretative room.&nbsp; Sometimes paranoia still gets the best of me.<br /><br />HR sent me an email, the subject line &quot;conference call on home design&quot; and I thought, what?! some kind of messy living room intervention?&nbsp; I asked for clarification.<br /><br /><br />

				I actually think that&nbsp; the ambiguity of online communication is one of the things that makes it so amusing. But what do I know: I was surprised that the &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; thing was being read as a flame thing. I found it positively mild. <br /><br />It&#39;s aggravating at times to say things in what I think is the clearest, plainest possible English, only to have it interpreted as snide, ignorant, bilious, or any other random sentiment that has no bearing on the reality of what I said. <br /><br />I, for one, write letters. Stamps, paper, pen... It just feels better than pecking out an e-mail. It doesn&#39;t solve the problem of being mis-interpreted, which is nothing new to e-mail.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been running message boards for over 11 years (which is nothing to brag about), and lately I&#39;m getting a lot of requests from people who ran vanity searches on themselves and found that stupid or somehow embarrassing things they posted many years ago are now surfacing #1 on some search engines when someone looks up their name. Guess it pays to be careful with the invective online, especially if you have a distinctive name. I happen to have a very common name so it&#39;s unlikely anyone would confuse me with the identically-named white supremacist in Pennsylvania, the British comedian, or the car salesman in Oregon. But you never know, because like the Wired story says, believe whatever&#39;s most convenient for themselves.<br /><br /><br />

				They flowery style of letters written by Mozart, Van Gogh and other great artists always left me feeling a bit nauseous to think that they would speak that way.&nbsp; The more I think about those letters now in terms of how offended we can be at email, the less sick I feel.&nbsp; &nbsp; Now I understand why they would write like that, as not to offend and to convey that they were grateful and loving to those they wrote to.<br /><br />So now my posts will be flowing with buttery clich√©s and loving caresses.&nbsp; &nbsp;
