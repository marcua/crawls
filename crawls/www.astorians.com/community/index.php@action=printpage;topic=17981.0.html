				Time for a new picture on astorians.com!<br /><br />Here are the rules:<br />0. Two submissions per person only - show us your best work.<br />1. Your image should be in digital format.<br />2. The picture needs to be taken with at LEAST at 3mp camera. Scanned images must be HIGH quality. (the bigger the better)<br />3. A small version of your image should be posted to this thread with a brief description of what it is. Please embed the image in the post if you can (use Flickr&#039;s link feature, or wherever you want to host it.)<br />4. The contest starts immediately and will run until May 1. At which time the contest will be closed to entries.<br />5. Astorians will then vote on the submitted images.<br />6. A winner will be announced and the graphic will go live on the homepage shortly thereafter.<br /><br />Further details:<br />Your image will run for a period of weeks or months. It should be a picture that captures some aspect of Astoria, and ideally, should be a spring or summer theme. On the bottom right hand corner we&#039;ll provide your name/username/link/email whatever you want (in text) so people can link or contact you. Obviously you are giving us permission to use your image on the Astorians homepage for a duration of our choosing by your submission. We reserve editorial right over your photograph&#039;s use on the website, however we will not resell or claim any other rights to your work.

				I don&#039;t think the pictures of bridges capture Astoria. That&#039;s the view of the city, with the bridges, and the river, standing in Astoria. They are pretty and they are taken while in Astoria, but why don&#039;t we turn the cameras the other way around?

				I&#039;m so happy to see the submissions in this thread. I wish I had the camera and the skillz to produce a good Astoria picture.<br /><br />I must say, as much as I love the bridge shots, I&#039;m kinda craving something different. So far I am loving the trees picture from Daisy and Lanseaux&#039;s street scene. <br /><br />I&#039;ll be ok with any picture across the top, as long as it includes the phrase &quot;Astorians.com...It&#039;s So Totally Astoria!&quot;&nbsp; :-D

(flickr link: http://www.flickr.com/photos/kipatterson/3930488028 (http://www.flickr.com/photos/kipatterson/3930488028))<br />A different angle of the Triboro/RFK Bridge (flickr link: http://www.flickr.com/photos/kipatterson/2854864144 (http://www.flickr.com/photos/kipatterson/2854864144))<br /><br />I am extremely eager to capture the resident red-tailed hawks that nest near the Triboro, the weather is supposed to be glorious this weekend, hopefully I&#039;m lucky. I&#039;ll be sure to share with everyone! Maybe this&#039;ll also motivate me to capture some other views of Astoria. Sounds like everyone&#039;s pretty taxed out on the bridges view.<br />

				there&#039;s a program called &quot;autostitch&quot; that tries to match up pictures and i think it automatically blends them too<br /><br />otherwise, i&#039;m not sure what programs you have access to, but in photoshop you can try removing some of the vignetting on each picture before combining them, that might make it a little more even

				i see my pic is tied for first, but it is flawed since the colors of the sky aren&#039;t balanced.<br />i am not a photo editor.<br />i do not have any photo editing programs, and i have no intentions of installing any.<br />if anybody wants to take a crack at doing a proper job, shoot me a PM with an email address and i will send the original full-sized pics.<br />even if my pic doesn&#039;t get chosen, i will owe the helper a drink because i wanted it done properly for myself anyway.<br />thanks in advance...

				Wow, I&#039;m not the only one voting for Kitty.&nbsp; Thanks, voters!&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not even close to tying, but I would have needed someone else to clean up the picture and put it in the appropriate format.&nbsp; Anyway, I don&#039;t mind saying that my other vote was for Newell&#039;s boat &amp; bridge photo.&nbsp; While we all appreciate a good bridge shot, I think some of the others would better be placed in an Astoria weather contest.&nbsp; A stormy sky all summer is not something we&#039;re hoping for, nor the lightening.&nbsp; Whatever month the photo was taken, Newell&#039;s boat really says summer to me.

				If I were voting for a permanent header, then nothing beats the beautiful Hell Gate Bridge.&nbsp; But another beauty of Astoria is the sweet disorder in its domestic architecture, so one of my votes will be for the street scene.

				Seeing it now for the first time and I like it very much - very representative of Astoria. What block is this? The ivy on that building is great, and there are no parking spaces available. :roll: Congrats Lanseaux!

				As much as I love the park and the bridge shots I think it&#039;s kinda cool to have a more &#039;interior&#039; shot this time too. It really looks nice up there! I love this street too.
