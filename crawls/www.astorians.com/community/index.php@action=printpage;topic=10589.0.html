				I just graduated within the last few days and I want to get a place in Astoria as soon as I get employed.&nbsp; I live in a different part of Queens with my parents right now.&nbsp; I have no credit.&nbsp; My father is retired so he basically has no income.&nbsp; The expected salary range for an entry level job in my field is 25-30k per year.&nbsp; Obviously I&#039;m looking for the cheapest place I can get.<br /><br />Will I be able to get an apartment soon?&nbsp; Can my father be a cosigner even though he doesn&#039;t have a lot of money?&nbsp; If I try to become somebodies roommate and they are already established at an apartment, will the landlord checkout my credit or look for a co-signer?&nbsp; What about moving into private homes?

				You&#039;ll probably have more luck going in as someone&#039;s roommate in an established rental situation or in a private home. I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll be able to find or afford your own place (even a studio) on that entry level salary. <br /><br />I&#039;d start building your credit (get one card and use it responsibly), look for roommate(s), and don&#039;t think about getting your own place for a couple of years. It&#039;s also a lot cheaper to initially move in with someone than finding your own place (no broker&#039;s fee, split security deposit, etc). Just put everything in writing between you and the roommate or you and the landlord and get receipts for any money you hand over. Good luck!<br /><br />
