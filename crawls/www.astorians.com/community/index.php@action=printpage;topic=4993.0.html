				I was just curious what people think of the reaction to this situation.<br />personally i think it&#39;s clever marketing that should have gone through city channels, but to evoke &quot;in a post 9/11 world&quot; i feel is a bit dramatic for a lit up cartoon character giving the finger. <br />the 2 things that disturbed me the most:they&#39;ve been up for weeks and are only now noticed. it lights up at night and is only noticed now? what if it were something more serious? if you take this long to notice something neon, how do you find the more &quot;explosive&quot; for lack of a better word at the moment, stuff?<br />and 2) i wish they put one in queens instead of dumb ole brooklyn. <br /><br /><br />http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070201/ap_on_re_us/suspicious_devices;_ylt=At5kPdxZVodpJSZpcha6zoes0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTA2Z2szazkxBHNlYwN0bQ--

				I agree with the outrage of Bostonians and I think the marketers should be prosecuted. Attaching electronic devices in this age of anxiety is out of bounds and these hipster idiots are old enough to know better.

				I loved this story. But only because they were lights of the mooninite characters from Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Which is absolutely hilarious. If I&#39;d seen a lite-up thing of a mooninite flipping the bird under a bridge or whatever, I would have started laughing. The real problem is no one in the Boston PD is up-to-date with pop culture.

				Maybe it&#39;s just the industry I work in, but I find this whole thing highly amusing and hilarious.&nbsp; These two are my heroes!&nbsp; Serves the media right, and I love how they gave them so much air time.&nbsp; It&#39;s a classic case of overreaction and hypeing up of fear in the post 9/11 era.&nbsp; It&#39;s a glow in the dark cartoon character flipping the bird for crying out loud.

				This was completely and utterly asinine. If these were devices from terrorists... they wouldn&#39;t be glowing bright for everyone to see, they&#39;d be concealed to do their job. They also wouldnt look like cartoon characters would they? People act like they&#39;ve never seen an LED image before.... Light Bright isn&#39;t that far in our past, this looks exactly the same. People need to take a chill pill<br /><br />Regardless, I found this image on the Gothamist, and figured it was appropriate. :)<br />(http://www.gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2007_01_athf2.jpg)

				A little off topic, but if passengers were not required to take off their shoes at the airport<br /><br />would you be more worried about flying?<br /><br />It would make no difference to me.<br /><br />***<br />I think the movie marketing was strangely brilliant, but who noticed the displays before the cops did?<br /><br />And I wonder how I would have reacted if I saw strange electronics by the train.<br /><br />Glad these pranksters have provoked a lot of attention, in more ways than expected.

				It seems like a lot of people are posting without knowing the facts.&nbsp; As GFB pointed out, you couldn&#39;t see the digital display during the day.&nbsp; Clearly, if people could, this situation wouldn&#39;t have happened.&nbsp; The pictures of these things are boxes with 3 or 4 visible batteries along the bottom and wires coming out of it.&nbsp; If the ad agency had just made them without exposed batteries and wires, this problem never would have happened.&nbsp; It could definitely be seen as a bomb.<br /><br />I personally feel that Turner and the ad agency should cover the costs that the city incurred, but no one should go to jail over this.<br /><br />And those two ad guys... hilarious!&nbsp; I think in &quot;taking it seriously&quot; they showed what idiots the media are.&nbsp; Except for the one guy who was smart enough to ask &quot;are you afraid that if you go to jail, they&#39;ll cut your hair?&quot;
