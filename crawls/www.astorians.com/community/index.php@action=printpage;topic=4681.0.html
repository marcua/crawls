Our bus will be leaving from Tompkins Square Park, at Ave. A and East 7th St., at 6:30 AM on that morning. For the return, we will be leaving D.C, at 4:30 PM. Round trip tickets are $35 and some of us are contributing more to subsidize young people who are working with the labor group RAP. Ticket money is due on Wednesday, Jan. 17, the latest, so we can pay the bus company. To pay, please call Ted A. at 347-804-9302 or Ted R. at 212-473-7179, to arrange to meet one of them with your money.

				Carolyn Maloney is wonderful.<br /><br />Here is her statement on President&#39;s Iraq Escalation Plan&quot;<br /><br />Rep. Carolyn Maloney (NY-14) today released the following statement about President Bush&#39;s plan to send more than 21,000 additional American troops to Iraq:<br /><br />&quot;President Bush – after using false information to sell a war to the American people and Congress, after invading Iraq without a plan to win the peace, after time and time again maintaining a failed “stay the course” policy – is now trying to sell an escalation of the war in Iraq as “a new way forward.” I am not buying it.<br /><br />&quot;As the sister of a Vietnam veteran, I still remember vividly our escalation of that failed war and the thousands of additional lives that it cost. I remember vividly the worry I had for my brother and the feeling that our troops would be better served if they were returned home rather than fighting in another country’s civil war. Those are the same feelings I have today about our troops who are serving bravely in today’s failed war, the Iraq War.<br /><br />&quot;I have long stated my desire for the president to begin a withdrawl of our troops from Iraq. I am a member of the Out of Iraq Caucus, and I have strongly supported my colleague John Murtha’s plan to redeploy our troops from Iraq. The American people made it crystal clear at the ballot box in November that staying the course in Iraq is not an option. Yet, President Bush has once again turned his back on calls to end the war, he has turned his back on the will of the electorate, and he is going in the opposite direction with a plan for escalation.<br /><br />&quot;I applaud the Democratic leadership in the House and Senate and its plan for a phased redeployment of American troops beginning in months and for more intense diplomatic outreach. This plan is more sensible and would prove ultimately more successful that digging ourselves deeper in the quicksand that Iraq has become.<br /><br />&quot;Furthermore, I will support any proposal that comes before Congress that would block funding for the implementation of escalation. I will support the effort by Senator Kennedy and my colleague Ed Markey to require the authorization of Congress before the president escalates this war.<br /><br />&quot;As the daughter of a solider and the sister of a soldier, I will always support our troops. It has become clear to just about everyone but the president that the best way now to support the troops is not to send more into the Iraqi Civil War – the best way to support them is to bring them home.&quot;<br /><br />###

				i contacted all my representatives last nite.<br /><br />i do appreciate what our troops are doing to protect us, but i feel that they are receiving POOR direction from the current administration, and would like for them to focus their efforts elsewhere. this is what i wrote to all of them including Ms. Maloney.&nbsp; <br /><br />i hope more people write to their representatives in addition to doing physical protests, etc.

Biden (D-DE), Levin (D-MI) and Hagel (R-NE) &nbsp;<br />Total Co-Sponsors 17 (15D and 2R)<br /><br /><br />Expresses the sense of Congress that: <br />(1) it is not in the U.S. national interest to deepen its military involvement in Iraq, particularly by escalating the U.S. military presence in Iraq; <br />(2) the primary objective of U.S. strategy in Iraq should be to have the Iraqi political leaders make the political compromises necessary to end the violence in Iraq; <br />(3) greater regional and international support would assist the Iraqis in achieving a political solution and national reconciliation; <br />(4) main elements of U.S. forces in Iraq should transition to helping ensure Iraq&#39;s territorial integrity, conduct counterterrorism activities, reduce regional interference in Iraq&#39;s internal affairs, and accelerate training of Iraqi troops; <br />(5) the United States should transfer, under an appropriately expedited timeline, responsibility for internal security and halting sectarian violence in Iraq to the government of Iraq and Iraqi security forces; and <br />(6) the United States should engage nations in the Middle East to develop a regional, internationally-sponsored peace and reconciliation process for Iraq. <br /><br /><br />***<br /><br />http://news.yahoo.com/fc/World/Iraq<br /><br />Crowds on both coasts protest Iraq war

				** After a great start, Congress is having difficulties addressing the war in Iraq.<br />Why cant members of Congress have their say?<br /><br />Best wishes to our Representative, and to the Out of Iraq caucus.<br />Is it possible to authorize supplemental funding for a withdrawal ? <br />**<br /><br /><br />House Democratic leaders circulated a nonbinding resolution Monday saying that Congress &quot;disapproves of the decision of President George W. Bush ... to deploy more than 20,000 additional United States combat troops to Iraq.&quot;<br /><br />The measure, expected to come to a vote by Friday, also says that &quot;Congress and the American people will continue to support and protect the members of the United States armed forces who are serving or who have served bravely and honorably in Iraq.&quot;<br /><br />Debate on the resolution is scheduled to begin on Tuesday, with each of the 435 House members allotted five minutes to speak. It will mark the first debate in Congress on the war since Democrats won control of the House and Senate in last November&#39;s elections. Opposition to the war figured heavily in the outcome of the election.<br /><br />Democratic leaders in the House and Senate have vowed to force an end to U.S. participation in the war, and made debate over a nonbinding resolution a symbolic first step.<br /><br />The House measure was drafted in simple, unadorned terms, an attempt by Democrats to maximize the number of Republicans who would support it and also to emphasize support for the troops. Republican leaders have said they expect at least a few dozen defections when the vote is taken later in the week.<br /><br />House Republican leader John Boehner (news, bio, voting record), R-Ohio, has said the GOP will have an alternative, but it is not clear that majority Democrats will allow it to be offered on the House floor.<br /><br />&quot;We&#39;re going to have Republicans who are skeptical of (Bush&#39;s) plan who&#39;ll probably vote for this,&quot; he said. Asked if he thought House Republicans would lose a third of their members to the Democrats&#39; resolution, he said, &quot;I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll lose that many.&quot;<br /><br />Boehner complained Sunday that Democrats had backed out of a promise to allow an immediate, wide-ranging debate on Iraq.<br /><br />On Thursday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (news, bio, voting record) said Republicans would be permitted to propose an alternative this week to the Democrats&#39; resolution. But on Sunday, Hoyer said that is &quot;not necessarily our plan.&quot;<br /><br />Hoyer, D-Md., said a House vote will be limited to the proposed resolution opposing President Bush&#39;s troop escalation and a Republican alternative would be voted on 30 to 45 days from now.<br /><br />&quot;Live up to your word,&quot; Boehner, R-Ohio, told Hoyer. Democrats, Boehner said, &quot;won&#39;t even let us have a substitute. ... Give us a vote this week.&quot;<br /><br />Boehner said Republicans want to offer a resolution saying a bipartisan panel should oversee the president&#39;s plan, with benchmarks to keep track of whether it is progressing.<br /><br />&quot;You&#39;re going to have that opportunity,&quot; Hoyer replied.<br /><br />The lawmakers appeared together on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; on NBC.<br />

Pelosi and other Democrats have said approval would mark the first step in an effort by the new Democratic-controlled Congress to force Bush to change course in a war that has killed more than 3,100 U.S. troops.<br /><br />Bush administration officials and their allies are resigned to House passage of the resolution and have worked in recent days to hold down defections by GOP lawmakers.<br /><br />But Bush took a swipe at his critics during the day.<br /><br />&quot;This may become the first time in the history of the United States Congress that it has voted to send a new commander into battle and then voted to oppose his plan that is necessary to succeed in that battle,&quot; the president said.<br /><br />The Senate unanimously confirmed Lt. Gen David Petraeus last week to take over as the top U.S. commander in Iraq.<br /><br />Bush said at a news conference Wednesday there is no doubt the Iranian government is providing armor-piercing weapons to kill American troops in Iraq. But he backed away from claims the top echelon of Iran&#39;s government was responsible.<br /><br />Administration critics have accused the president of looking for a pretense to attack the Islamic republic, which is also at loggerheads with the United Nations about what Tehran says is a nuclear program aimed at developing energy for peaceful purposes.<br /><br />Defending U.S. intelligence that has pinpointed Iran as a hostile arms supplier in Iraq, Bush said, &quot;Does this mean you&#39;re trying to have a pretext for war? No. It means I&#39;m trying to protect our troops.&quot;<br /><br />Bush has asked Congress to approve $100 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Congressional Democrats are hoping to insert provisions that would make it harder for the administration to follow through on its plan to deploy an additional 21,500 combat troops to Iraq.<br /><br />Rep. John Murtha (), D-Pa., who is leading the effort, has said the measure may be changed to require that any troops deployed must meet formal Army readiness standards.<br /><br />Murtha also said the measure may be changed to prohibit any military action against Iran without specific congressional approval.<br /><br />Asked about Murtha&#39;s remarks, Pelosi said, &quot;I fully support that.&quot; She added that she would propose it as stand-alone legislation if it is not included in the bill that provides more money for the Iraq war.<br /><br />Bush has said he intends to go ahead with the troop buildup regardless of nonbinding expressions of disapproval in Congress.<br /><br />But, Pelosi said, &quot;I don&#39;t think that the president can completely ignore it.&quot; <br /><br />She spoke down the hall from the House chamber, where Republicans and Democrats alternated turns at the microphone in a debate on the war.<br />

				<br />http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070224/ap_on_re_us/death_in_iraq_ap_poll<br /><br />Americans underestimate Iraqi death toll <br /><br />By NANCY BENAC, Associated Press Writer <br /><br /><br />WASHINGTON - Americans are keenly aware of how many U.S. forces have lost their lives in&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Iraq, according to a new AP-Ipsos poll. But they woefully underestimate the number of Iraqi civilians who have been killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br />When the poll was conducted earlier this month, a little more than 3,100 U.S. troops had been killed. The midpoint estimate among those polled was right on target, at about 3,000.<br /><br />Far from a vague statistic, the death toll is painfully real for many Americans. Seventeen percent in the poll know someone who has been killed or wounded in Iraq. And among adults under 35, those closest to the ages of those deployed, 27 percent know someone who has been killed or wounded.<br /><br />For Daniel Herman, a lawyer in New Castle, Pa., a co-worker&#039;s nephew is the human face of the dead.<br /><br />&quot;This is a fairly rural area,&quot; he said. &quot;When somebody dies, ... you hear about it. It makes it very concrete to you.&quot;<br /><br />The number of Iraqis killed, however, is much harder to pin down, and that uncertainty is perhaps reflected in Americans&#039; tendency to lowball the Iraqi death toll by tens of thousands.<br /><br />Iraqi civilian deaths are estimated at more than 54,000 and could be much higher; some unofficial estimates range into the hundreds of thousands. The U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq reports more than 34,000 deaths in 2006 alone.<br /><br />Among those polled for the AP survey, however, the median estimate of Iraqi deaths was 9,890. The median is the point at which half the estimates were higher and half lower.<br /><br />..

Even though the Democratic Party rode the antiwar wave into Congress in November, they’ve done little since to end the bloody war in Iraq. Just last week House Democrats met to discuss how best to halt Bush’s request to send more troops into the region, but couldn’t come to an agreement on whether or not to put any restrictions on the administration’s plea for an additional $93 billion.<strong> The only way to stop the war, as Sen. Russ Feingold understands well, is to cease all funding for the ongoing tragedy.</strong> But the majority of Democrats, already preparing for the next round of elections, aren’t about to step up and represent their constituents. <br /><br />While some, including John Nichols at The Nation, claimed Washington was being taken over by progressive Democrats, we knew the numbers proved otherwise. Progressive Democrats did gain strength; however, conservative pro-war Blue Dog and DLC patrons gained the most seats in last election cycle. Virtually all ran on pro-war platforms — guaranteeing that they would continue to support Bush’s efforts to eradicate terrorism by terrorizing Iraqis and Afghanis instead. <br /><br />“The Blue Dogs are pretty unified in not wanting to micromanage how the Pentagon conducts the war,” said Blue Dog Rep. John Salazar of Colorado. “None of us will support withholding funds from troops in the field.” <br /><br />Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, also refused to block Bush’s call for additional funds by claiming it would be “immoral” for the Democratic Party to do so. Sen. Hillary Clinton won’t apologize for giving Bush the authority to invade Iraq, nor will Sen. Dianne Feinstein acknowledge that her support for past reconstruction funds has fattened the pockets of her husband, who has large stakes in several companies currently profiting from the war. <br /><br />We may as well call all of this what it is: a willful abandonment of ideals and purpose, which never really existed to begin with. The Democratic Party exerts the same hawkish fervor as the Republican Party. Indeed they have proven that despite the overwhelming opposition to the war nationwide they will not do a damn thing to end it. <br /><br />The time is now, then, for us to come together under a unified antiwar banner despite what our political leanings may be. <span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Liberal, radical, conservative, libertarian</strong></span>, it doesn’t matter. Let’s not wait around for either party to come to their senses. Let’s force them to. <br />

				** I am curious on other views about whether Congress should freely exercise the role of calling an end to hostilities or withdrawing troops? Should the President be able to veto such legislation? Do you see the role of the minority to protect security from a premature withdrawal?<br /><br />I am very glad the Democrats have put this out there and I hope it comes to a vote and passes. It still is likely asking too much of our troops.<br /><br />An aside, once upon a time there was a suggested amenment that any member of Congress voting for war would be eligible to be drafted to fight in the war...<br />**<br /><br /><br />Democrats want Iraq pullout by fall 2008 <br />By DAVID ESPO, AP Special Correspondent<br /><br /><br />In a direct challenge to President Bush, House Democrats unveiled legislation Thursday requiring the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Iraq by the fall of next year. The White House said Bush would veto it.<br /><br />Speaker Nancy Pelosi (news, bio, voting record) said the deadline would be added to legislation providing nearly $100 billion the Bush administration has requested for fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.<br /><br />She told reporters the measure would mark the first time the new Democratic-controlled Congress has established a &quot;date certain&quot; for the end of U.S. combat in the four-year-old war that has claimed the lives of more than 3,100 U.S. troops.<br /><br />Senior White House adviser Dan Bartlett, accompanying Bush on a flight to Latin America, told reporters, &quot;It&#039;s safe to say it&#039;s a nonstarter fot the president.&quot;<br /><br />Within an hour of Pelosi&#039;s news conference, House Republican Leader John Boehner (news, bio, voting record) attacked the measure. He said Democrats were proposing legislation that amounted to &quot;establishing and telegraphing to our enemy a timetable&quot; that would result in failure of the U.S. military mission in Iraq.<br /><br />&quot;Gen. (David) Petraeus should be the one making the decisions on what happens on the ground in Iraq, not Nancy Pelosi or John Murtha (news, bio, voting record),&quot; the Ohio Republican added. Murtha, a Pennsylvania Democrat, has been heavily involved in crafting legislation designed to end U.S., participation in the war.<br /><br />According to an explanation of the measure distributed by Democratic aides, the timetable for withdrawal would be accelerated if the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki did not meet goals for providing for Iraq&#039;s security.<br /><br />Democrats won control of Congress last fall in midterm elections shadowed by public opposition to the war, and have vowed since taking power to challenge Bush&#039;s policies.<br /><br />Pelosi made her announcement as Senate Democrats reviewed a different approach — a measure that would set a goal of a troop withdrawal by March of 2008. Majority Leader Harry Reid (news, bio, voting record) of Nevada called a closed-door meeting of the rank-and-file to consider the measure.<br /><br />In the House, Pelosi and the leadership have struggled in recent days to come up with an approach on the war that would satisfy liberals reluctant to vote for continued funding without driving away more moderate Democrats unwilling to be seen as tying the hands of military commanders.<br /><br />The decision to impose conditions on the war risks a major confrontation with the Bush administration and its Republican allies in Congress.<br /><br />But without a unified party, the Democratic leadership faced the possibility of a highly embarrassing defeat when the spending legislation reaches a vote, likely later this month. establishing a deadline for troop withdrawals.<br /><br />Talking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Bartlett called it &quot;a political compromise in the Democratic caucus of the House aimed at bringing comity to their internal politics, not reflective of the conditions on the ground in Iraq.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It would unnecessarily handcuff our generals on the ground, he said. &quot;Obviously, the administration would vehemently oppose and ultimately veto any legislation that looks like what was described today.&quot;<br /><br />To make the overall measure more attractive politically, Democrats also intend to add $1.2 billion to Bush&#039;s request for military operations in Afghanistan, where the Taliban is expected to mount a spring offensive.<br /><br />The bill also would add $3.5 billion to Bush&#039;s request for veterans&#039; health care and medical programs for active duty troops at facilities such as the scandal-scarred Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington.<br /><br />Democrats also proposed $735 million for a health care program for low-income children. The program is popular among governors of both political parties, but the administration has not signaled its acquiescence to the additional money.<br /><br />As described by Democrats, the legislation will require Bush to certify by July 1 and again by Oct. 1. whether the Iraqi government is making progress toward providing for the country&#039;s security, allocating its oil revenues and creating a fair system for amending its constitution. <br /><br /><strong>They said if Bush certified the Iraqis were meeting these so-called benchmarks, U.S. combat troops would have to begin withdrawing by March 1, 2008, and complete the redeployment by Sept. 1. </strong> &nbsp;<br /><br />Otherwise, the deadlines would move up. <br /><br />If Bush cannot make the required certification by July 1, troops must begin a six-month withdrawal immediately. If Bush cannot make the second certification, the same six-month timetable would apply. <br /><br />The legislation also requires the Pentagon to adhere to its existing standards for equipping and training U.S. troops sent overseas and for providing time at home between tours of combat. <br /><br />Pelosi said the provision was designed to make sure the government would &quot;not be sending our troops into battle without the proper training, the proper equipment.&quot; <br /><br />Yet it also permits Bush to issue waivers of these standards. Democrats described the waiver provision as an attempt to embarrass the president into adhering to the standards. But they concede the overall effect would be to permit the administration to proceed with plans to deploy five additional combat brigades to the Baghdad area over the next few months. <br /><br />The measure emerged from days of private talks among Democrats following the collapse of Rep. John Murtha&#039;s original proposal, which would have required the Pentagon to meet readiness and training standards without the possibility of a waiver. <br /><br />Murtha, D-Pa., and chairman of a House Appropriations military subcommittee, said its implementation would have starved the war effort of troops because the Pentagon would not have been able to find enough fully rested, trained and equipped units to meet its needs. <br /><br />Several moderate Democrats spoke out against it, though. And Republicans sharply attacked it as the abandonment of troops already in the war zone. <br /><br />___ <br /><br />Associated Press reporters Jim Abrams and Anne Flaherty contributed to this story.<br />

				<br />http://www.progressivepatriotsfund.com/Home.html<br /><br /><br />http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=585082 <br /><br /><strong>Senate leader to get behind Feingold plan <br />War funding would cease in March 2008</strong><br />By CRAIG GILBERT<br /><br />cgilbert AT journalsentinel.com<br /><br />Washington - Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid will announce today that he has endorsed a plan by Wisconsin Democrat Russ Feingold to end funding for the Iraq war by March 31 next year.<br /><br />The measure goes well beyond the target withdrawal date that the Senate narrowly approved last week as part of an emergency war spending bill, and it is part of what Feingold describes as a legislative strategy by Democrats of steadily ratcheting up their anti-war proposals.<br /><br />&quot;This is the next significant step toward ending this war,&quot; Feingold said in an interview. <br />In a statement he planned to release today, Reid (D-Nev.) said that if President Bush vetoes a war spending bill over the issue of timelines, Reid will make sure that Feingold&#039;s more far-reaching measure is voted on in the next Senate work period. <br /><br />The measure is similar to a plan Feingold offered previously. It calls for troop withdrawals to start within 120 days of enactment. And it would end funding for U.S. deployment in Iraq that extends beyond March 31, 2008. <br /><br />The only exceptions to the funding cutoff would be targeted, limited operations against terrorist groups in Iraq such as al-Qaida; security for U.S. infrastructure and personnel; and training and equipping of Iraqi forces. <br /><br />The Feingold bill goes beyond the language of the Senate war spending measure, which mandates a starting date for the first withdrawals of troops and sets March 31, 2008, as a non-binding target date for full withdrawal. But that measure doesn&#039;t prevent continued deployment after the March 2008 date. <br /><br />Feingold&#039;s bill also goes beyond what the House recently approved in its version of the war spending bill, which calls for a later withdrawal deadline of September 2008. <br /><br />The Feingold proposal would seem to fall well short of the votes needed for passage. The weaker language on timetables in the Senate war spending bill just barely passed last week with 50 votes when Republicans sought to strike it. That&#039;s 10 votes short of the number of votes needed to overcome a filibuster, not to mention the two-thirds of the Senate required to override a presidential veto. <br /><br />Notes debate shift<br /><br />But Feingold noted in the interview that the center of gravity in the war debate on Capitol Hill has shifted steadily in the past year or two. <br /><br />Feingold first proposed a timeline for withdrawal in 2005 and got little support even from his Democratic colleagues. <br /><br />&quot;Now a majority of the Senate has gone along with it,&quot; he said, referring to the language in the war spending bill passed last week. <br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s the same thing now with a binding timeline and the use of the power of the purse&quot; to end the war, he said. &quot;The very things considered lightning rods or dangerous, these things that in the past were considered sort of extreme steps or premature steps, are now considered mainstream,&quot; Feingold said. He cited Reid&#039;s co-sponsorship of his bill as a sign of how support has grown among Democrats for more aggressive steps. <br /><br />The Wisconsin lawmaker has been part of a small group of senators in the party mapping out a legislative strategy on the war. What emerged from those meetings several weeks ago was a consensus to &quot;move quickly from one level to another level&quot; against the war, to &quot;ratchet up the pressure&quot; by offering ever more ambitious anti-war measures. <br /><br />&quot;This is exactly what&#039;s been done,&quot; Feingold said. <br /><br />Confrontation ahead<br /><br />But now the Democratic-controlled Congress faces an impending standoff with Bush over war spending, a confrontation that will shape the politics of the Iraq debate for some time to come. There are those on both sides of that debate who believe public opinion will be with them if the president vetoes a war spending bill and money for U.S. deployment threatens to run out this spring. <br /><br />Interviewed by George Stephanopoulos Sunday morning on ABC, White House counselor Dan Bartlett reiterated Bush&#039;s vow to veto a withdrawal timeline, whether it&#039;s a mandated start date for withdrawal (as in the Senate bill) or a mandated end date (as in the House bill). <br />&quot;The president has made very clear, and I don&#039;t think the American people think that we ought to replace the judgment of 535 politicians in Washington with the judgment of commanders on the ground,&quot; Bartlett said. &quot;And he has made very clear, they have gotten notice from him, about his veto. He will veto the bill if they bring it to him, and then, hopefully, we can set aside the politics and get a bill that funds our troops.&quot;<br /><br />Feingold called the looming standoff &quot;a very major moment in terms of not only this war but the relationship between Congress and the president.&quot; <br /><br />The Democrat contended that &quot;in the end the White House will have to blink&quot; because Bush will have to defend his own veto of the funding for the war. <br /><br />&quot;Congress can&#039;t afford to be characterized as backing down at this point. . . . If he vetoes it, he&#039;s basically challenging us to accept his will,&quot; Feingold said. <br />

				<br />Reid: Congress will endorse Iraq pullout <br />By DAVID ESPO, AP Special Correspondent<br /><br /><br /><br />Defying a fresh veto threat, the Democratic-controlled Congress will pass legislation within days requiring the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Iraq beginning Oct. 1, with a goal of completing the pullout in six months, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (news, bio, voting record) said Monday.<br /><br />Reid said the legislation &quot;immediately transitions the U.S. military away from policing a civil war.&quot; He said that troops that remain in Iraq after next April 1 could only train Iraqi security units, protect U.S forces and conduct &quot;targeted counter-terror operations.&quot;<br /><br />The Nevada Democrat outlined the elements of the legislation in a speech a few hours after Bush said he will reject any legislation along the lines of what Democrats intend to pass. &quot;I will strongly reject an artificial timetable (for) withdrawal and/or Washington politicians trying to tell those who wear the uniform how to do their job,&quot; the president said.<br /><br />Bush made his comments to reporters in the Oval Office as he met with senior military leaders, including his top commander in Iraq, Gen. David Petraeus.<br /><br />Taken together, Reid&#039;s speech and Bush&#039;s comments inaugurated a week of extraordinary confrontation between the president and the new Democratic-controlled Congress over a war that has taken the lives of more than 3,200 U.S. troops.<br /><br />Negotiators for the House and Senate arranged a late-afternoon meeting to ratify the timetable that Reid laid out. The demand for a change in course will be attached to a funding bill that is needed to pay for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.<br /><br />As part of the same measure, congressional negotiators also tentatively agreed on about $25 billion not requested by Bush for medical care for troops and veterans, aid to the victims of Hurricane Katrina, farm disaster relief and other programs.<br /><br />The add-ons have provoked a separate veto threat from Bush. Negotiators dropped provisions ridiculed by the president such as aid to peanut farmers and spinach producers.<br /><br />Reid said Bush was in &quot;a state of denial&quot; over the war, and likened him to another commander in chief four decades ago. &quot;I remember when President Johnson, trying to save his political legacy, initiated the first of many surges into Vietnam in 1965,&quot; he said.<br /><br />Reid said thousands more U.S. troops died in Vietnam in the years that followed. Now, he said, Bush <strong>&quot;is the only person who fails to face this war&#039;s reality - and that failure is devastating not just for Iraq&#039;s future, but for ours.&quot;</strong><br /><br />Reid drew criticism from Bush and others last week when he said the war in Iraq had been lost.<br /><br />The Nevada Democrat did not repeat the assertion in his prepared speech, saying that &quot;The military mission has long since been accomplished. The failure has been political. It has been policy. It has been presidential.&quot;<br /><br />Reid said that in addition to the timetable, the legislation will establish standards for the Iraqi government to meet in terms of &quot;making progress on security, political reconciliation and improving the lives of ordinary Iraqis who have suffered so much.&quot;<br /><br />The measure also would launch diplomatic, economic and political policy changes, the Nevada Democrat said.<br /><br />Reid also challenged Bush to present an alternative if, as expected, he vetoes the Democratic legislation.<br /><br />The president said that Petraeus will go to Capitol Hill to tell lawmakers what&#039;s going right in Iraq — and what&#039;s not.<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s a tough time, as the general will tell Congress,&quot; Bush said. Still, the president insisted, progress is being made in Iraq as more U.S. troops head into the country to provide security.<br /><br />There is no doubt that Republicans in Congress have the votes to sustain Bush&#039;s threatened veto. <br /><br /><strong>That would require Congress to approve a second funding bill quickly to avoid significant disruptions in military operations. </strong> <br /><br />Reid&#039;s speech blended an attack on Bush, an appeal for patience to the anti-war voters who last fall gave Democrats control, and an attempt to shape the post-veto debate. <br /><br />&quot;I understand the restlessness that some feel. Many who voted for change in November anticipated dramatic and immediate results in January,&quot; he said. <br /><br />&quot;But like it or not, George W. Bush is still the commander in chief — and this is his war,&quot; Reid said. <br /><br />Reid said Democrats have sought Republican support for their attempts to force Bush to change course. &quot;Only the president is the odd man out, and he is making the task even harder by demanding absolute fidelity from his party.&quot; <br /><br />Looking beyond Bush&#039;s expected veto, he said, <strong>&quot;If the president disagrees, let him come to us with an alternative. Instead of sending us back to square one with a veto, some tough talk and nothing more, let him come to the table in the spirit of bipartisanship that Americans demand and deserve.&quot;</strong><br />
