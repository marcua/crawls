			A close friend who lives in Washington Heights belongs to a parents board there that is quite successful. Take a look:<br /><br />http://groups.yahoo.com/group/parentandme1/<br /><br /><br />This group enabled me to meet another mom in Sunnyside (her sister is in Washington Heights as well) and I&#039;m helping her start a Western Queens version of this board. The board in Washington Heights serves as AN AMAZING resource for parents in that neighborhood to:<br /><br />- find/exchange discounted and free baby gear<br />- arrange playdates<br />- find childcare (such as nannyshares and getting recommendations on daycare, nannies, etc.)<br />- vent, advise and share about such things as parks, organic shopping, and other neighborhood topics that might pertain to parenting<br /><br />If you are a parent in Astoria, Woodside and Sunnyside, please join and contribute topics and discussions at:<br /><br />http://groups.google.com/group/western-queens-parents-group<br /><br />Thanks and hope to see you there!
