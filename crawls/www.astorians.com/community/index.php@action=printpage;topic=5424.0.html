				Hi, I&#039;m kind of new to the boards here.&nbsp; I was wondering if anyone had started a group for dog owners in Astoria?&nbsp; (More specifically the Dutch Kills neighborhood?)&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived here for about 3 years now, and had my dog for one year this week.&nbsp; On our walks, we see so many people in our neighborhood with dogs and it would be great to get organized and start doing things like some of the other dog owner groups in the city (such as Fido).&nbsp; <br /><br />We have two small dog runs, one in Astoria Park and one on Vernon Blvd (I think, I haven&#039;t been there).&nbsp; Both are kind of a trek for folks in the middle who don&#039;t have their own transportation.&nbsp; (I have a car, so I usually drive us to the dog run in Astoria Park)- it&#039;d be great to have something in the middle to serve the community as well.<br /><br />On most of the websites I&#039;ve looked at, the first step to starting a dog run is forming a group of owners- so, who&#039;s in?<br />

				<br />http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/Hell-Gate-Bridge-Dogs/<br /><br /><br />&quot;This is a group for the dogs and their people who frequent Astoria Park in Queens, NY. We&#039;re the dogs and people who want to run free --- responsibly and with respect to others and non-dog owners.&quot;

				I&#039;m actually a member of that- but since I live off of 36th Avenue, Astoria Park is kind of a hike for us...&nbsp; We can&#039;t go every day- though we do stop in once in awhile, it&#039;s usually only when I drive there...
