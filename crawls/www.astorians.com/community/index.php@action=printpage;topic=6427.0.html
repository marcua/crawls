				Just needed to vent.&nbsp; Took me over an hour to get to the office this morning (my normal commute is about 25 minutes) due to our friends at the MTA and a broken down W at Astoria Blvd then again at 30th Ave.&nbsp; The conductor told everyone to get off at 30th Avenue and take the train back to Astoria Blvd and to cross the platform for the express train.&nbsp; The sad thing is that he told everyone to NOT go downstairs as the train would open its doors on both sides.&nbsp; Something made me not believe him so I stayed on the train to Ditmars and just started all over but it really irked me to see 100&#039;s of people (literally) cross the platform as they had been told to do only for the train doors to only open on the TriBoro side of the train.&nbsp; You&#039;d think the MTA would actually say something follow through rather than making tons of people late for work.&nbsp; Fortunately I have some flexibility with my arrival time at work but heard tons of people having to call their bosses frantically explaining the train situation.<br /><br />For the record, the MTA didn&#039;t put any sort of &quot;Sevice Advisory&quot; on their website about this.<br /><br />Anyhow, I just felt like venting and hope that everyone on the N line was able to make it to work okay.

				Last Thursday while waiting at Queens Plaza they annouced that a door was stuck on the N Train and there would be no service to Ditmars.&nbsp; It was about 7:30pm.&nbsp; &nbsp;They informed us to proceed downstairs to catch the 19A or the 101 bus. We were all clueless as to where to catch these buses.&nbsp; Such chaos.&nbsp; After following the crowds I waited for the 101.&nbsp; It was a frustrating commute home thanks to the MTA.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I caught the express this morning, yesterday too! It was really nice considering I&#039;m always running a little late for work. They did an awful job with announcements and doors yesterday. They let everyone on at Astoria Blvd, closed the doors, and then proceeded to tell everyone it was an express train. That didn&#039;t leave too many people happy.

				I was on the train around 8:40 - they told everyone at Broadway to transfer to a Ditmars bound train, get off at Astoria Blvd and take the N Express from there. &nbsp;So everyone does that. &nbsp;Then, and I swear they do this to mess with us, &nbsp;the train goes LOCAL and stops at all the stations they told people to leave! &nbsp; Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr &nbsp; &nbsp;Typical N nonsense -- though I am sure my bosses think I am making it up when I am late twice a week or more thanks to the train.....

				So, after so many years, it&#039;s still happening.&nbsp; I have not been on the train for about 14 years and the stories sound the same.&nbsp; Not much has changed.&nbsp; They are absolutely clueless and incompetent.&nbsp; I think the Mayor needs to fix the Transit Authority before he begins thinking about his traffic congestion plan.&nbsp; Imagine that many more people riding the rails?&nbsp; It would be an absolute mess.&nbsp;

				Wow, what a royal pain in the a$*. This makes me glad I leave at 7:00 a.m. <br />It seems the witching hour starts anywhere from 7:45 to anytime after<br />8:00. The train is less crowded then and not as many problems. <br /><br />Supposedly riders were going to be given the opportunity to grade their<br />subway lines.

				I&#039;m with you on this one.&nbsp; The N line is consistently one of the worst lines in the system.&nbsp; Here&#039;s how The Straphangers Campaign has rated the line since 2000:<br /><br />2006: 22nd out of 22 lines rated<br />2005: 22nd out of 22 lines rated<br />2004: 22nd out of 22 lines rated<br />2003: 21st out of 22 lines rated<br />2002: they did not report that year<br />2001: tied for 6th out of 22 lines rated - <em>pretty good year!</em><br />2000: 19th out of 22 lines rated<br /><br />If one thing is clear it&#039;s that the N is consistently crappy!&nbsp; Not sure how these people keep their jobs.

				Hi, I&#039;m new to the boards!&nbsp; Just chiming in, I remember back when it was the R train instead of the N and ac hadn&#039;t even been invented yet!&nbsp; So, what I&#039;m saying is that, things now can be a drag, but as mentioned before they were a hell of a lot worse.

				Okay - so what can we do about this?&nbsp; Years ago, I had tracked down a Supervisor responsible directly for the N Line and we would call him.&nbsp; He tried his best to make things better.&nbsp; I tried to get some information recently but no luck.&nbsp; I may call George Delis&#039; office to see if he knows anyone that we can begin calling.&nbsp; In the meantime, it may be of benefit to call 311.&nbsp; If they get lots of calls, they may pay a bit more attention.

I leave the house at 6:00 and rarely - and I mean <em>rarely</em> - have a problem.

Lo and behold, it&#039;s almost always on time...<br /><br />Before my hours changed to this early shift, though, I experienced a surfeit of hellish moments during the peak of the morning commute. The scales balance - I trade an hour or so of extra sleep for a simple commute (because, uh, I don&#039;t go to bed any earlier).

				I have mixed feelings about the trains, because sometimes I really feel like I&#039;m in a third world country when I&#039;m riding them. The ironic thing is that in other countries the systems are actually better. I lived in Moscow and the trains there are crowded as hell--you can get pushed on to a train by all the people on the platform or pushed out by all the people getting off--but the trains do actually show up every 2 minutes which is nice even though most of the people on the train haven&#039;t showered since Perestroika. So it sucks the trains here can&#039;t be on time/run as often, but at least they&#039;re not that crowded, except sometimes they are, and people here don&#039;t know how to use space efficiently. They don&#039;t get that you can&#039;t just step through the doors and plant yourself there--hello there&#039;s an aisle! Use it! Of course I&#039;m going to shove past you if you stand next to the doors like a lump! <br /><br />Disclaimer: if you&#039;re offended by my &quot;perestroika&quot; joke then you either have no sense of humor or have never lived in Russia or both.

				Yeah, I was late for work too this morning thanks to the N/W line, and it was important that I be on time for a 9:00am meeting. I&#039;m late at least once a week, sometimes twice. The Astoria train service is cleaner and safer than it was 25 years ago, but the service was better then (it was called the RR). Delays were alot rarer then, I almost always got a seat, and I was able to get from my front doorstep to my desk in under 30 minutes like clockwork. Today I travel about the same distance, and takes my 45 minutes on a good morning, but normally 50 - 60 minutes. My evening commute is usually better than my morning one.

				I disagree PJ.On days like that one you could leave your house 45 minutes to an hour early and still be late. <br />For the price we&#039;re paying now - $76 for a monthly ticket - the service should be better.<br /><br />Even more important, the communication during an incident or problem needs to improve. <br />If you&#039;re waiting on a platform at 30th Ave. or B&#039;way (just examples), there&#039;s no electronic board,<br />no loudspeaker, nothing. You wait and wait.....and wait.....until you watch one, then two, then three<br />trains zip down the middle track.<br /><br />And the buses are worse. The Q102 runs so rarely that when I do see it, I check my watch to approximate<br />the time. I&#039;ve never seen it at the same time more than one day. I mention that one since for a lot of us <br />it&#039;s the best alternative to reach Queens Plaza if you&#039;re stuck.<br /><br />Maybe if more of us call and/or e-mail the MTA. They also post notices occasionally about meetings the public<br />can attend. Usually it&#039;s related to a specific project, but I think they sometimes have them about service issues - <br />I could be wrong though.<br /><br />But I think the collective complaining via an official channel is the only way the MTA will at least acknowledge <br />the problem<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;ve been living in the Ditmars area for about 4 yrs now and in the last year the service has noticeably gotten worse. &nbsp;Every evening I have to wait 5 - 10 min on the Astoria Blvd. stop b/c both rails are full on Ditmars. &nbsp;On Friday two weeks ago (5/11) service was suddenly suspended at 7:50AM and I had to take a taxi to work. Since I work all the way in the Financial District, I really didn&#039;t appreciate the extra $40 I had to shell out b/c the MTA couldn&#039;t even put me across the bridge. &nbsp;This is the second time it happens in less than 3 months.<br /><br />Less than two weeks later (yesterday), things started well for me, with the W going express to Queensboro Plaza, when lo and behold, somebody got sick and I had to take the ride from hell on the 7 train where the rudest, less respectful people in the world ride. &nbsp;(Note to people on the 7 train: If you can feel somebody else&#039;s breath while standing on the train you are way too close!) Unless it was the conductor that got sick, I really don&#039;t see why they have to stop service. The conductor can call the person on the booth and have him/her take care of the sick person.

				Now that I work for a city agency, I get to see bureaucracy up close. I also have the pleasure of having to answer the public&#039;s questions about inefficiency. Yee hah.&nbsp; :lol:<br /><br />Why do construction projects take so long? Because these are tax dollars being spent, and thus have to be micromanaged to the point of lunacy. By law, we have to follow certain processes, and when one aspect falls through, the process has to start from scratch. <br /><br />blahdeblahdeblah. It does help somewhat to keep the complaints coming. Call 311 to issue your complaint and they will route it to the right people (I get memos routed on a regular basis: &quot;Caller states that construction is taking too long......caller complained about inconvenience....&quot; etc.) If nothing else, multiple complaints about the same issue force people to find answers thus making responses quicker.&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Yeah that surplus is from some big real estate sales the MTA has made recently, like a Christmas bonus or a wealthy great aunt dying.&nbsp; <br /><br />Biggest problem with out transit system is that since it is cleaner and safer than 20 years ago, and since more people are moving to NYC instead of leaving, more people are suing public transit, which is good.&nbsp; But state and city money put towards public transit is going down so property owners can get their tax cuts.&nbsp; I think I read on streetsblog that under Koch the city spent 200 million, but it&#039;s been cut and cut, so now under Bloomberg, its only 70 million.<br /><br />If only there was some sort of plan that put a price on congestion of the traffic variety, that then used the revenues from that exclusively towards mass transit.&nbsp; Hmmmm.&nbsp; It could be called The Pricing of Traffic Congestion for What to Make Glorious Our Fair Mass Transit System Pricing Plan System of Organization and Tactics Strikeforce.

				I don&#039;t like the wait either, but let&#039;s be honest here: considering everything, it&#039;s a pretty efficient service.&nbsp; The NYC subway will take you just about anywhere in the city for $2; and most of the time it runs ok.&nbsp; Yes, it has problems.&nbsp; But can you really expect a service as enormous as public transportation in a city of 8 million to have no problems?<br /><br />In Washington, D.C. the subways are cleaner and there&#039;s an electronic ticker that displays when the next train will arrive, but you can&#039;t go very many places and the prices aren&#039;t consistent.&nbsp; And if you don&#039;t happen to live in the city itself, but instead live in Northern Virginia or Southern Maryland, chances are you have to drive to the station and pay an additional fee for parking.&nbsp; <br /><br />Maybe it&#039;s because I&#039;m not from around here.&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;ll start to get really frustrated by it in a few years.&nbsp; Maybe I need a few more awful experiences under my belt.&nbsp; But right now, I think the NYC subway system is a really under appreciated and extremely convenient service.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				A lot of other train systems are cleaner and more efficient.&nbsp; But they&#039;re also not open 24-hours a day.&nbsp; DC Metro and the London Tube have the night hours to do track work and other maintenance.&nbsp; This is another reason NYC Subway is below them in consistency.

				The London Tube is definitely cleaner, but it sure sucked the first night that we went out drinking and realized that it closed...<br /><br />But, just as aqua said, it also means they can do track work and station cleaning at night, which keeps daytime trains running consistently and the stations cleaner.<br /><br />I&#039;m also coming from outside NYC as well and to me, regardless of what happens, it&#039;s still much better than having to drive.

				The waiting between Astoria Blvd and Ditmars after work is ridiculous. its EVERY DAY. no matter if I leave work (@ 49th st) at 5:15 or 7:45, we sit and sit and sit at LEAST 3 -5 mins. Once i waited 8 before i got out and walked.<br /><br />The other thing that makes me furious is that they always blame the &quot;Schedule&quot; for the reason. If you have trains backed up before 30th ave (which has happened) because someone at Ditmars is waiting to leave on schedule, thats retarded to me. and if a train is going out of service, pull it out and park it. dont let it sit on the 2nd track for an hour blocking a chute.

				I have a suggestion and I know it&#039;s far fetched but I rode this line from 1973 until about 1993.&nbsp; The issues are the same.&nbsp; Very little has changed except - it is probably safer to ride the subway today than it was in the 80&#039;s, less graffiti and fewer homeless people on the trains.&nbsp; Oh, and one more thing - there are far more people living in Astoria but I would venture to say that the number of trains has not changed much.&nbsp; Anyway, my suggestion is this - every time you get stuck outside the Ditmars station waiting for a train to pull out so that your train can get into the station, when you get to Ditmars walk to the end of the station to the little shack where the conductors and station master sits.&nbsp; It is at the end heading towards Manhattan.&nbsp; Go up the steps and speak to them.&nbsp; Do not accept their BS about schedules and other excuses.&nbsp; Challenge them.&nbsp; If enough people speak out, they may get the message.&nbsp; It worked years ago.&nbsp; I wonder if the little shack is still there - can someone look for it and let us know?&nbsp;
