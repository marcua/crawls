				Bird flu caused by man&#39;s inhumane treatment of animals<br />&nbsp;Posted Tuesday, May 09, 2006 by Mike Adams<br />&nbsp;Print this article&nbsp; &nbsp;Permalink: http://www.NewsTarget.com/019373.html<br />Key concepts: influenza, animal rights and chickens. <br /><br />http://www.newstarget.com/019373.html (http://www.newstarget.com/019373.html)<br />I&#39;m glad someone said it!&nbsp; &nbsp;We are trying to deal with a possible pandemic with new vaccines and drugs. Factory farming practices created mad cow disease too, (feeding ground up cows back to themselves)<br /><br />

				No, &quot;bird flu&quot; was most decidedly not <em>caused</em> by inhumane treatment of animals. The author of that non-scientific article confuses the origin of a virus with issues of transmission.<br /><br />The threat of bird flu as a pandemic, however, is very much related to crowding, both of birds and people. It&#39;s certainly true that crowding of animals, including people, makes it much easier to transmit certain types of disease. More birds will get H5N1 because they&#39;re living in close quarters, certainly. This doesn&#39;t mean that if chickens were all wild birds, H5N1 would never evolve or jump to people, it just means that there would be less opportunity for the virus to spread. Same with people. Cities are a really efficient way for diseases to spread. Back in our hunter-gatherer days, although life would still have been nasty, brutish and short, we certainly didn&#39;t have had nearly as many infectious diseases as we do now (or, particularly, as we did 100 years ago before antibiotics and vaccines). Jared Diamond covers this quite nicely in Guns, Germs &amp; Steel (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393317552/002-0749109-8693627?v=glance&amp;n=283155)...<br /><br />OK, sorry bout the rant...

				no problem for the rant, after all this is the &#39;rant&#39; forum!<br />I want to write more but it&#39;s busy at work.<br />What do you think about MadCow Disease. Caused by feeding meat back to the cows no?

				You could also say that feeding cows cow-parts caused the mad cow <em>epidemic</em>, nitpickety. :wink: You&#39;re missing the point about hamartia.

				Well underneath the beer mustache, Harlan is a scientist so his comments will be of the nitpickey exacting nature.&nbsp; But this is totally welcome. <br />(and yes I realize that article&nbsp; I posted was not scientific, the author is a fitness/health buff but I agree with the message.)

I just think itavoided the point of the (admittedly dodgy) article--that people have a huge role in the spread of these diseases. <br /><br />ETA: I mean an active role, not an I-live-a-big-disease-infested-city role.

				I am glad you posted this Tuesday. I am currently reading The Omnivore&#39;s Dilemma <br />(thanks Jayme!) and it is a real eye-opener into the meat industry. I am not too far into it yet, but it is AMAZING what the food industry is doing. It all boils down to money, but I think nature, ecology, people, animals, the environment, etc., etc., etc. will all pay the ultimate price.

I also agree that living conditions for most farm animals is pretty bad, that stuffing cows full of corn (and antibiotics) so we can have $1 hamburgers is particularly bad, and that governmental policies are supporting exactly the wrong things. On the other hand, I don&#39;t think solutions are easy, and I don&#39;t think that merely treating chickens humanely (which we ought to do anyway) is likely to significantly reduce the likelihood of bird flu jumping to people, as long as we need to raise enough chickens to feed everybody, which we do.<br /><br />Sorry for nitpicking. As Tuesday said, it&#39;s my job. :) I think everyone on this thread supports the same policies, but I personally can&#39;t stand it when people support the right things for the wrong reasons (or the wrong things for the right reasons)...!<br />

				Title: <strong>Conscience of a Carnivore</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				I didn&#39;t want to start a whole new thread for this so I just looked for an associated topic.<br /><br />The Conscience of a Carnivore: It&#39;s time to stop killing meat and start growing it. &nbsp;(http://www.slate.com/id/2142547/) <br /><br />Researchers in Holland and the United States are working on the problem. They&#39;ve grown and sautéed fish that smelled like dinner, though FDA rules didn&#39;t allow them to taste it. Now they&#39;re working on pork. The short-term goal is sausage, ground beef, and chicken nuggets. Steaks will be more difficult. Three Dutch universities and a nonprofit consortium called New Harvest are involved. They need money. A fraction of what we spend on cattle subsidies would help.<br /><br />I wonder if it would taste anywhere near as good as grilled lamb?
