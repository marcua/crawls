				So, what do you have on hand in your pantry with which to make quick meals?&nbsp; Or a quick snack?&nbsp; What are your staples?&nbsp; I&#39;d like to start keeping more such things on hand, so that I&#39;m not so tempted to eat out or eat junk.&nbsp; I keep things like crushed tomatoes, black beans, roasted eggplants, olive oil-packed tuna, dry pasta and rice, olives, things like that.&nbsp; But I&#39;d love to know what you keep, hoping to find some inspiration.&nbsp; Help!<br /><br />

				<strong>Stir-Fry Related Dishes</strong><br />You can throw in all kinds of leftover veggies or food into a kind of stir fry dish. It&#39;s pretty fast to make too when you have ingredients on hand.<br /><br />1. Rice Cooker<br />2. Rice<br />3. Frozen Stir-Fry Vegetables<br />4. Leftovers<br /><br /><strong>Mexican Nacho, Burrito, or Taco Salad</strong><br />1. Tortilla Chips or Tortillas<br />2. Cans of pinto beans<br />3. Various veggies<br />4. Cheese of some kind<br />5. Dairy of some kind (sour cream, cottage cheese, ranch dressing)<br />6. Rice of some kind<br /><br />Throw it all into a burrito or on top of tortilla chips.<br /><br /><strong>Sandwich:</strong><br />1. Mayo<br />2. Tomatoes<br />3. Bread<br />4. Salt<br />5. Some seasoning like dill<br /><br />And of course <strong>Spaghetti:</strong><br />1. Dry noodles<br />2. Sauce in a can<br />3. Leftover red wine<br />4. Veggies<br /><br />Throw all the veggies in a pan and fry them, add red wine. Pour on the canned sauce. Makes a decent &quot;home style&quot; sauce for use with pasta.<br /><br /><strong>Salad:</strong><br />1. Hearts of Palm<br />2. Olives (Green/Black)<br />3. Nuts of some kind<br /><br />I keep those on hand so I can just grab some tomatoes, onions, lettuce on the way home to throw together a salad.<br /><br />That&#39;s some of the main ones I try and keep on hand I think.

				I keep so many things in the pantry and never end up using any of them!<br /><br />maybe that should be one of my new year&#39;s resolutions...<br /><br />But if you have space in your feezer, I suggest cooking up veggies, soups or pasta sauces and freezing them so they are ready when you get home late and don&#39;t feel like cooking<br /><br />

				Not an exact answer, but you&#39;ll probably find these threads over at Ask Metafilter (which I&#39;m also kind of addicted to, but just the Ask, not the blue) interesting:<br /><br />What are ten ingredients that are handy to always have on hand to cook a good meal? (http://ask.metafilter.com/mefi/53886)<br />What&#39;s in your fridge? (http://ask.metafilter.com/mefi/33045)<br />What interesting and nutritious meals can I make out of items regularly given out from the food bank? (http://ask.metafilter.com/mefi/54010) (the poster asked for recipes she could make from basic staples she gets from the food bank, which you might have on hand)<br /><br />Also, the food&amp;drink category (http://ask.metafilter.com/category/12) is always a good one to keep an eye on for inspiration.<br /><br />As for what I always keep on hand - nothing different than what you do, so I&#39;ll be watching this too! I really need to cook healthier and for myself more. :)

				Here&#39;s a good representation of what I keep around:<br /><br /><em>General</em><br /><br />garlic<br />onions<br />extra virgin olive oil<br />toasted sesame oil<br />kosher salt<br />full array of spices<br />mustards<br />vinegars<br />hot sauces<br />condiments (ketchup, mayo, soy sauce etc.)<br />chicken broth (usually Pacific organic in the box)<br /><br /><em>Canned goods</em><br /><br />tomatoes in various forms (whole, crushed, diced, sauce, paste)<br />Trader Joe&#39;s light coconut milk<br />hearts of palm<br />garbanzo beans<br />great northern beans<br />black soy beans<br /><em>light</em> tuna (not white because it has higher mercury content)<br />Trader Joe&#39;s chunk white meat chicken (good in a pinch for chicken salad-type lunch)<br />other canned fish -- sardines, mackerel, etc.<br />water chestnuts<br />things like capers, giardiniera (especially the pickled cauliflower), pickled jalapenos.<br /><br />Also a few ready meals, mostly from TJ&#39;s -- their version of Tasty Bite Jaipur Vegetables (http://www.tastybite.com/product_p/i00005jv.htm), for instance, and a couple of tuna curry meals they offer.<br /><br /><em>Dried goods</em><br /><br />quinoa<br />chana dal<br />green split peas<br />several kinds of lentils<br />wakame<br />nori<br />bonito shavings<br />krupuk (secret vice)<br />falafel mix<br /><br />In the freezer I keep assorted frozen vegetables, which I try to get from TJ&#39;s.&nbsp; I love their frozen green beans, for instance -- they are incredibly fresh and good.&nbsp; I also have extra broths and sauces for quick meals.&nbsp; <br /><br />I buy vegetables and protein on a daily or every-other-day basis, unless I&#39;m in one of my periodic states of trying to be organised and plan our meals, in which case I buy a bunch of stuff over the weekend and cook up batches of food.&nbsp; The problem with that is by the end of the week I&#39;m not in the mood for what I planned, so it&#39;s awfully tempting to end up ordering in, and what I&#39;ve carefully planned and made ends up being thrown out.

				This is a topic very close to me heart. As most of you know, I can&#39;t go outdoors in extreme weather. That makes shopping quite an ordeal for me. A few years ago I finally had to concede that my kitchen and pantry were not conducive to my getting a good meal together for myself. So I did the following:<br /><br />a) I ripped out my old kitchen (which I know most of you can&#39;t afford to do) and started with a new floor. Keeping the kitchen clean can be a huge chore if you don&#39;t have easy to clean appliances and surfaces. I put in a self-cleaning oven and a refrigerator with a huge freezer.<br /><br />b) I broke down my little kitchen pantry and rebuilt a closet across from the kitchen as a pantry. I put in shelves from top to bottom and then placed plastic, expandable shelves on every shelf. That way I can just look in and see everything because nothing is hiding behind something else.<br />(http://www.improvementscatalog.com/HanoverAssets/Improvements/product_images/203003_2x.jpg)<br /><br />c) I made inventory lists for everything important to me; pantry, freezer and spices.<br />(http://farm1.static.flickr.com/134/341806722_9e7f06da2c_m.jpg)<br /><br />Right now my spices and seasonings shelf is fairly stocked. I have:<br />Basil<br />Baking soda and Powder<br />Bay leaf<br />Beef and Chicken Bouillon Cubes<br />Cayenne, Black, Ground, Lemon and Red Pepper<br />Celery Seed<br />Chili Powder<br />Cinnamon<br />Curry Powder<br />Dry Mustard<br />Garlic Powder<br />Regular and Panko Bread Crumbs<br />Ground Ginger<br />Ketchup<br />Liquid Smoke<br />Onion Soup Mix<br />Oregano<br />Sweet Hungarian Paprika<br />Parsley<br />Pure Almond and Vanilla Extract<br />Poppy Peed<br />Red Wine, Rice, Balsamic, Apple Cider and Plain White Vinegar<br />Rosemary<br />Iodized and Kosher Salt<br />Olive, Canola, Peanut and Sesame Oil<br />Tarragon<br />Thyme<br />Worcestershire and Soy Sauce<br /><br />The pantry shelves are also stocked right now because I anticipated a colder winter:<br />All Purpose and Self-Rising Flour<br />Granulated, Confectioner&#39;s and Dark Brown Sugar<br />Boxed Beef and Chicken Stock<br />Biscuit mix&nbsp; <br />Corn Meal<br />Corn Syrup<br />Cornstarch<br />Crushed, Whole Plum Tomatoes and Tomato Sauce and Paste; and Sorisso&#39;s Pasta Sauce<br />Evaporated Milk<br />Honey<br />Jell-O<br />Rolled Oats, Pastina and Farina<br />Corn Flakes, Kix and Shredded Wheat<br />Elbow Macaroni, Egg Noodles, Rotinni, Linguine, Ziti, Angel Hair, Shells and Spaghetti<br />Instant, White, Brown and Wild Rice<br />Roasted Red Peppers<br />Mushroom Pieces<br />Non-Stick Sprays<br />Black and Green Olives<br />Raisins<br />Chocolate and Butterscotch Chips<br />Ketchup, 3 kinds of Mustard and Mayonnaise<br />Relish (for hot dogs and tartar sauce)<br />Pepperoncini (for salads and sandwiches)<br />Canned Tuna, Salmon, Anchovies and Sardines<br />Maple Syrup<br />Peanut Butter and Jams, Jellies and Preserves<br />Chocolate Syrup<br />Seltzer, Pepsi, Root Beer and Diet Coke<br />Apple and Cranberry Sauce<br />Tea, Coffee, Cocoa and Hot Chocolate<br /><br />I also keep a whole shelf dedicated to paper and plastics:<br />Regular and Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil<br />Paper Plates<br />Parchment Paper<br />Plastic Baggies (Freezer and Storage, Sandwich—all sizes)<br />Plastic Wrap<br />Wax Paper<br />Toilet Paper<br />Paper Towels<br />Tissues<br />Plastic Utensils<br />Disposable Cups<br />Garbage Bags<br />Napkins<br />Light Bulbs<br /><br />Then there&#39;s the stuff under the kitchen and bathroom sink for cleaning. I also have a cabinet, above the toilet filled with extras of all personal hygiene products—deodorants, creams and lotions, powders, hair and foot care products<br /><br />In the Freezer:<br />Butter and Margarine<br />Breads, Rolls and Bagels<br />Pounded Chicken Cutlets<br />Boneless Pork Chops<br />Ground Beef and Pork<br />Sausages<br />Shrimp<br />Macerated Fruits (from last summer)<br />Marinated Chicken Parts<br />Vegetables<br />Bacon<br />Hot Dogs<br /><br />(in individual casserole dishes)<br />Sliced Meatloaf and Gravy(3)<br />2 Meatballs and Sauce (5)<br />Stuffed Cabbage (1)<br />Beef Stew (2)<br />1/2 Roast Chicken and Stuffing<br />Chicken Paprikash and Dumplings (2)<br />Chicken Cacciatore (1)<br /><br />I use coupons prodigiously. If I can get something at half price or less (I really like free!), I buy it as an extra. I only buy stuff that I use. That way I know I won&#39;t run out. If I had only been doing this when I worked and had my children living at home I could have saved myself a whole lot of money (on delivery and take-out) and I wouldn&#39;t have had to stop at the grocery store every night on my way home trying to figure out what to make for dinner. Keeping organized has changed my life—and saves me a lot of money. Also, finding out that I can freeze whole meals allows me to cook in big batches that I *don&#39;t* have to eat 4–5 days in a row!
