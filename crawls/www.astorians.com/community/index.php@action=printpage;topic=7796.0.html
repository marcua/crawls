				Has anyone actually gotten through when calling our local police station?&nbsp; 718.626.9311 is the number I found online and thru 411.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried all day since 10:00 this morning.&nbsp; It rings over a dozen times before either giving me a busy signal or a recording that says my call can&#039;t be completed at this time.&nbsp; <br /><br />That&#039;s disconcerting.

				It&#039;s been this way for over a week.&nbsp; They do not seem to be answering their number, but when I&#039;ve called 1 Police Plaza to complain, I am assured they are there.&nbsp; I have taken to calling Queens Borough North and asking to be transfered.&nbsp; They seem to answer when they see the QBN name flash on their screens.

				I filed a complaint with 311 over this and actually got a call back from the station about 1 year ago. The sgt I spoke with said it must have been a fluke because they are always there and he would look into it.<br /><br />Guess nothing has changed.<br /><br />Complain to 311 about it - at least it gets logged then.

				It varies a lot by night.&nbsp; With my NuBar situation I call five nights a week and sometimes you get folks who are very helpful and actually care, and some nights you get folks who wouldn&#039;t know courtesy, professionalism or respect if it bit them on the behind.&nbsp; I wish I still felt they cared, but at this point I feel pretty alienated from the 114th Precinct.

				From what i heard from good sources, on an average 4-12 shift, the 114 is having a good night if they can get 2-3 cars on patrol. Think about that. Think about how many people live in the vast area that is covered by the 114. <br /><br />This sort of thing is happening across the city and has been for a long while now. <br /><br />When you&#039;re in a dangerous situation, you shouldn&#039;t have to wait 20+ minutes for some help. Imagine if the fire dept. had that sort of response time to a &#039;non priority&#039; job...<br /><br />Sometimes I wonder what the heck we&#039;re even paying taxes for...
