				Rumors began circulating at New York Radio Message Board and other places that Jack FM was toast, and CBS Radio would soon be returning Oldies to 101.1 fm.&#160; Whether that means any or all of the jocks from &quot;CBS-FM&quot; would be returning was unclear.&#160; And whether you&#039;d be getting hits from 50&#039;s 60&#039;s and 70&#039;s, or a new audio pattern, was also unclear.&#160; Maybe you&#039;ll be getting 1964 (Beatles) thru some point in the early 80&#039;s (as the definition of what an &quot;oldie&quot; is may be changing) or even the terminology would now be &quot;Classic Hits&quot; as in other markets.<br /><br />- Cannibal<br />So this means &quot;Playing What We Want&quot; wasn&#039;t what NY listeners wanted.

				I liked JackFM, often had some quirky choices. Less predictable, though the &quot;What WE want&quot; concept is a bit obnoxious. <br /><br />Still, I could do without Zep/Floyd/Rush/Kinks/Kansas etc. for a good decade or so. Though I love most classic rock, we need another such station like we need another 99 cent store in Astoria&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br />How about Dr. Demento gets his own station? I miss that nonsense.&nbsp; :lol:

Those &quot;tired old songs&quot; have an audience. When I was a little girl growing up in Astoria, every street corner, every alleyway, every closed storefront, every school bathroom had a group of guys singing <em>a capella</em> harmony. We called it doo wop! Cousin Brucie and Alan Fried were our heroes. Those lyrics and those melodies formed my generation. I have a collection of over 2 thousand records that are historical evidence of that era. NYC has radio stations that play every genre of music, including country-western, but not even one that still plays those oldies. Every market in the country has at least one. We have none.

				I too like those tired old songs, much more than the &quot;fresh&quot; ones.&nbsp; The opinion is the station&#039;s, not mine.&nbsp; The reason I didn&#039;t enclose the phrase in quotes was because I wasn&#039;t entirely sure I was quoting verbatim.

				That really sucks.&nbsp; I don&#039;t listen to the radio much (partly because I don&#039;t have a car), but JackFM was the <em>only</em> good radio station in the New York area.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always been astounded that in such a major city, the radio stations all suck so bad.<br /><br />I was just in Wisconsin and Illinois and was amazed at the radio there.&nbsp; I thought the scan button on the radio was busted, because it kept stopping at almost ever .10 on the dial, but there are just that many radio stations.&nbsp; Maybe the signals carry further because of less interference, but there were a bazillion options.<br /><br />Christine, go to www.wfnx.com (http://www.wfnx.com) and you can listen to their streaming radio.&nbsp; It&#039;s the alternative rock station (though that term doesn&#039;t mean much anymore) I grew up listening to in Boston.&nbsp; They tend to play a lot of good bands before they make it big.

				HALLELUJAH! I missed my cbs fm. All I can say is that when I came back to NY in 2000 and went to my old fave 101.1 and didn&#039;t hear brucie........ :-(&nbsp; and heard this &quot;jack fm&quot;? I was confused and thought that i was tuning into the wrong station. Someone else mentioned that they repeat the same songs over and over. some days it may seem as if they do. On the classic rock station here in NYC (waxq 104.3) they actually do repeat stuff every few hours, and I do listen to them on occasion but I absolutely loathe radio commercials so thats why I have XM. Here in NYC none of the radio djs even have a say in what they play, it is all controlled by the producers and the sponsors, so complaining does nothing.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: To Jack Fm: Jack off Jackass!! and Good Riddance!

				I lived in Chicago for a summer (and spent significant amounts of time there otherwise) and I have to agree, the midwest does have the best radio stations (though it was sad when the all 80&#039;s station turned into a Spanish station). My gf and I were commenting on this yesterday when we heard about Jack going back to CBS (she also lived in Chicago during college and appreciates midwest radio). We both really liked Jack -- they played my Metallica and her Steve Miller Band -- it was the one station we could agree on.<br /><br />Fortunately, 92.3 tossed that all-talk format and went back to hard rock, so all is not lost.

				For those of you who are going to miss Jack FM, all you have to do is put your I Pod on shuffle and you will get the same effect.&nbsp; Add in a few commercials for good measure<br /><br />New York radio is awful.&nbsp; I gave up on it a few years ago and went to XM.&nbsp; I have been very satisfied.&nbsp; A great variety of music with little or no commercials.&nbsp; &nbsp;Over 10 different rock stations alone.&nbsp; I just hope this purposed merger between XM and Sirrus doesn&#039;t screw up this too.

				jack-fm is the worst format of all time. good riddance to something that was completely ill-suited to new york&#039;s (admittedly crappy) radio landscape -- here&#039;s hoping fresh-fm and the &quot;kinder, gentler&quot; wplj are next.

				With all due commiseration for those who really lost loved ones in the 9/11 attacks, one of the enduring effects of those attacks, for me, has been the loss of daytime classical music on WNYC.&nbsp; And they&#039;ve been so high-handed about the change, so downright contemptuous of classical-music lovers--like New York, of all cities, is too good for classical music.&nbsp; And to add insult to injury, they repeatedly invade the time supposedly set aside for the music in order to air talk about music.&nbsp; Yak, yak, yak.&nbsp; Shut up and play!<br /><br />Yeah, I know there&#039;s still WQXR, but during the daytime it&#039;s not the same as Morning Music and Midday Music on WNYC-FM.&nbsp; It&#039;s commercial-studded bubblegum classical music, not the interesting classical music that WNYC-FM plays when it is playing classical music.<br /><br />Yeah, and I know that now there is WNYC-2.&nbsp; Still a bummer.&nbsp; You either have to get special equipment or you have to be immobilized in front of your computer.

				So, um, was anyone listening to Jack FM at like 7:30, 8ish this morning? Because if you were, you may have heard &quot;congratulations to Alison from Astoria&quot; because I won Def Leppard tickets! On their last day! Awwww...and yay! There was a bit of scandal because their phone system was all messed up and disconnected me twice, but I was able to get through again, and the guy recognized my voice. I told him that winning the tickets was a &quot;shining glimmer of happiness in an otherwise crappy month.&quot; Ha! (Dramatic much?)<br /><br />(I didn&#039;t actually get to hear my name announced since I had to work, so if someone else did, I will be happy.)<br /><br />I am going to miss Jack FM - I &quot;discovered&quot; it when I was doing a lot of driving back &amp; forth between Bridgeport and NY when I was apartment hunting in summer 05, so its like my personal little NYC station. At that time, they had hardly any commercials (like 1 an hour) since they were a new station, and they played (mostly) music I like. I agree that the radio landscape in NY is lacking, but of the bunch, Jack was my favorite. Before that, it was 92.7, which is now a Spanish station. Maybe I just shouldn&#039;t like radio stations in NY, because they all seem to go away.<br /><br />Also, I have been hearing commercials for WCBS on Jack - they&#039;re gonna play music from the 60s, 70s, and 80s - the 80s are &quot;oldies&quot; now? Did I just win tickets to see an oldies band? Scary on so many levels!

There is also the perrenial rock station WBAB 102.3, which has been playing the same play list for 30 yrs.&nbsp; However, since I got Sirius radio (and of course the I-pod as well) I don&#039;t think I will ever listen to terrestrial radio again

I really don&#039;t listen to the radio a whole lot these days, but it wasn&#039;t a terrible.station compared to the rest of the junk thats out there. I do have to say I am excited about WCBS coming back on the air. I really love Motown and the Oldies (4 Tops, The Spinners, The Platters, Marvin Gaye, etc.)

				I actually went to Def Leppard show about 1.5 years ago, and they play a lot their hits, as do lots of these &quot;old school&quot; bands that are touring these days. Rock of Ages will DEFINITELY be on the setlist, and I&#039;ll definitely dork out, haha...if anyone is a (even ironically) Def Leppard fan, I highly recommend going to see them live, they really do put on a great show (and I&#039;ve been to a lot, both huge and teeny, big names and &quot;no-names&quot;), and the crowd that goes to see them is chill/fun too. No annoying people is a big plus in my book.<br /><br />I should add that I&#039;m not exactly sad about oldies coming back - its the soundtrack to my childhood (my dad always had the 60s station on!), and that music is great and has lasted for good reason. When I worked at the ballpark, I did the music over the pa system, and I had 3 separate oldies categories. Its fun, awesome, catchy music. And now wcbs will have 80s stuff, which I love (but still am &quot;omg!&quot; about it being oldies). But I will miss Jack.<br /><br />The Beach Boys will be the first song back on WCBS, but does anyone know what the last Jack song will be? If anyone is listening tomorrow afternoon, you have to let me know, I will probably be working (and unable to listen to the radio) at 1 tomorrow!<br /><br />Is anyone listening to Jack today? They&#039;re doing little commercials about how they&#039;re going off the air, sorta, and they&#039;re kinda funny. There was just one about Bob Shannon sending a bouquet of flowers to Jack saying &quot;bon voyage&quot;.

				I&#039;m entering this discussion a bit late but I am a bit of a radio enthusiast, albeit one that agrees with the common sentiment around here that the New York City radio landscape is more of a tune-out than anything else.<br /><br />Count me in among the people that&#039;s going to miss Jack, if only because of the music they played, which as far as commercial radio goes, was pretty diverse and interesting.&nbsp; I especially enjoyed the excellent 80&#039;s weekends and hearing all my favorite 80s new wave classics.&nbsp; I can understand why so many people hated Jack, because it replaced the beloved CBS FM, but I also think that in the two years since the original CBS-FM was &quot;jacked,&quot; nostalgia and a form of romanticism set in amongst its former listeners.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been following the radio landscape for a number of years, including the New York Radio Message Board that was referenced in the first post of this thread, as well as other radio message boards, and I remember that in the couple of years before CBS-FM flipped to Jack, most of what I read about CBS-FM came in the form of complaints.&nbsp; Complaints that the playlist was too limited, that there were too many ads, that they turned off the reverb, that they turned the reverb back on again, that there was no 50&#039;s music, that there wasn&#039;t a lot of 60&#039;s music, that there wasn&#039;t enough 80&#039;s music, that there was too much 80&#039;s music, and so on.&nbsp; And for all the crying about the station changing formats, a lot of people seem to have also forgotten that many legendary CBS-FM jocks were let go in unceremonious fashion long before the format switch....which, of course, led to more complaining.<br /><br />There&#039;s really nothing here to indicate that the &quot;new&quot; CBS-FM is going to be much better.&nbsp; It&#039;s still going to have a 300-400 song (at most) playlist, just like pretty much every other commercial station, and you&#039;re still going to hear a lot of the same burned out songs.&nbsp; There&#039;s not going to be much 50&#039;s music except as an occasional &quot;oh wow&quot; type of moment.&nbsp; There&#039;s surely still going to be a lot of ads, and ultimately, in the end, it&#039;s still going to be a radio station run by a huge corporation in which profit is the only bottom line.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong: oldies deserves a spot on the NYC dial.&nbsp; NYC radio is so bland and limited it&#039;s absolutely mind-numbing.&nbsp; Aside from oldies, there&#039;s so many other formats here that are missing: a good triple-A format, some modern rock (not the dino-rock with a couple of new Linkin Park songs per hour that K-Rock...also a CBS station...features), definitely a real dance station (not the sappy disco and 80s ballads that KTU passes off as &quot;dance&quot; music), a station with that classic alternative/new-wave sound, and, god forbid, even a country music station.&nbsp; Unfortunately though, in a corporate-run radio climate, with CBS and Clear Channel and all those other large companies putting millions at stake, the common thinking is that only a certain amount of formats work.&nbsp; That&#039;s why oldies was taken off the air in the first place, except that Jack largely failed...so CBS is going to give it a whirl with an &quot;updated&quot; classic hits station which might buy it a few good years of revenue and profits.&nbsp; But I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if one day, a few years down the line, when the next format of the moment appears, CBS jumps at the opportunity and ditches its &quot;aging&quot; classic hits format.<br /><br />By the way...it was awesome to see a few other people refer to the old 92.7 WLIR.&nbsp; Now THAT was an awesome station.&nbsp; I was too young to catch the station&#039;s new wave heyday in the 80s, but I listened to the station throughout my teenage years in the 90s and all the way up to January 9th, 2004 when the station was sold.&nbsp; WLIR still exists out on the East End of Long Island, on 107.1, but the signal doesn&#039;t come close to reaching New York City, though I do believe there is an online stream.&nbsp; In my opinion though the station doesn&#039;t sound as good as it did when it was on 92.7, even in its latter days.&nbsp; The station had personality and great music and played a ton of stuff no other commercial station ever touched.&nbsp; I remember LIR After Hours with all the dance remixes of the new wave and newer stuff.&nbsp; I actually was able to get the last few hours of WLIR on 92.7 on mp3, recorded right off the air from Astoria...I listen to it sometimes when I want to remember what real radio (in my subjective, humble opinion) sounded like :)<br /><br />As for the overall radio landscape in NYC...pitiful, for all the reasons stated above and more.&nbsp; But again...it&#039;s the corporate thinking.&nbsp; A full power FM station in NYC is worth upwards of a $100 million.&nbsp; Even WLIR, with its lower-powered signal coming from the Queens-Nassau border, sold for $62 million in 2004!&nbsp; They don&#039;t want to take perceived risks, and they play it ultra safe....though we&#039;ve seen that even with that, they fail and fail bigtime.&nbsp; I don&#039;t consider Jack a big failure, though it was under a dark cloud from day one with the way CBS-FM was thrown off the air.&nbsp; Now...Free FM....now *that* was a failure, especially when the same format was tried, and failed, only a few years before, by the same company, on 102.7.&nbsp; You can also thank the FCC...for never updating its FM allocations from the early days in the 1940s and 50s, leading to a limited amount of stations.&nbsp; Travel to Europe, and FM frequencies are separated by 0.1 or even 0.05 mhz instead of 0.2 here, and in some countries, like Italy and Greece, the FM dial is crammed with stations literally 0.2 mhz apart.&nbsp; I always found it fascinating that I heard more and better American music on the radio whenever I traveled to Greece, than I did in New York&nbsp; :-P<br /><br />

				Ha!&nbsp; Free FM on 92.3 is what I normally listen to since there really isn&#039;t another station worth listening to.&nbsp; However, I do miss my talk radio on this station.&nbsp; I was used to Opie and Anthony, The Radio Chick, Ron and Fez, JD and Elvis.&nbsp; Now it&#039;s just Opie and Anthony from 6 to 9 and the rest is music.

				One theory of what&#039;s coming that was given Monday by the webmaster of NY Radio Message Board, Allan Sniffen, was to me quite on mark.&nbsp; Jack FM could very well make a return to NY airwaves if K-Rock doesn&#039;t show an uptick in ratings *soon*.&nbsp; Now I know it&#039;s only been a while since they put the stake in the heart of Free-FM.&nbsp; but rock radio has never garnered great ratings here in NYC, and a re-appearance of Jack (likely without the Jack name and snarky voiceover talent that basically said to the past station listeners &quot;we play what we want, bleep you!&quot;)&nbsp; They just hired a program director from 97.1 fm, so she had put some real humans behind the mic and had better crack the whip quickly.<br /><br />Cannibal<br />- Headphones on...

				well as for the&nbsp; 80s oldies...so far its springsteen...they sure can&#039;t play Flock of Seagulls, but maybe we will hear some 80&#039;s rock like Fogerty, Traveling Wilburys, Paul Simon etc. <br /><br />My father has been in radio 40+ years and trust me, having the oldies back is a great thing for all markets...the format was on the verge, but now with a flagship like CBS its likely to be &quot;back&quot; ....whats old is new again!!<br /><br />

				I&#039;ll stick with the bottom of the dial: WFMU, WBGO, WSOU, etc... There&#039;s something for everyone on these stations and they&#039;re not ruled by corporate sponsors or underwriters as to what content they can or can&#039;t play. In fact, WFMU is 100% listener-supported and doesn&#039;t take a dime from the government or any corporations. Granted, you might hear Kenny G (the DJ, not the sax &quot;player&quot;) play a baby crying for three hours in the middle of the day, but you&#039;ll also consistently hear and be introduced to a lot of great music--both new and old.<br /><br />I listen online to all of these stations since they lack the giant megawat broadcast towers as their commercial counterparts:<br />WFMU - wfmu.org (http://wfmu.org)<br />WBGO - wbgo.org (http://wbgo.org)<br />WSOU - wsou.net (http://wsou.net)<br /><br />Of course, there&#039;s always WWOZ (wwoz.org (http://wwoz.org)), New Orleans&#039; jewel of a radio station. And then there&#039;s my podcast, Crate Digger&#039;s Gold (http://djarturo.podomatic.com)--one hour of scratchy old 45rpm records from all walks of life!

				The non-commercial stations are quite an oasis in the sea of mediocre commercial radio, but I think even here, there&#039;s programming missing.&nbsp; WBGO is jazz 24-7.&nbsp; WNYU is free-form but with a weak signal and is only on part of the day...the other half is WFDU (Farleigh Dickinson University in NJ) with an even weaker signal over NYC.&nbsp; WSOU is pretty much just hard rock and metal.&nbsp; WKCR is great for certain, specific genres of music.&nbsp; WFUV always came across as too holier than thou to me.&nbsp; WFMU is a great station and truly follows the free-form philosophy, but the signal is bad in Queens (they do webcast, as most of these stations do, however).<br /><br />My alma mater, Stony Brook U., has a great free-form radio station that you can catch over the air if you&#039;re out on Long Island, or online...WUSB 90.1 FM.&nbsp; Everything from polka to techno to rockabilly to alternative news/talk to showtunes.&nbsp; I was program director there as a student for a year and a half...great experience even if some of the staffers there were....interesting, to say the least.
