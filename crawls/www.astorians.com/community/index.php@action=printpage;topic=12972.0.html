				Hi everyone,<br />This year I&#039;ve volunteered to organize a group of Wishmakers in Astoria to give eight kids a reason to smile this Christmas. I have 8 letters from the NYCares Winter Wishes Program and am looking for people to donate money and/or time for shopping and wrapping. :mrgreen: <br /><br />So...<br /><br />1) If you&#039;re too busy to get involved in the nitty-gritty of this project but want to contribute to this project, please consider donating money. We&#039;d like to raise <strong>at least $50</strong> for each child (that includes postage).<br />2) If you&#039;re short on cash this year, we&#039;d love your help shopping for the toys and/or coming out to our wrapping party. <br />3) If you&#039;d like to grab your friends and work on getting gifts for one child together, you can split the costs amongst yourselves. <br /><br />Whatever level of involvement suits you will be deeply appreciated!&nbsp; :smitten:<br /><br />I&#039;ll be having a wrapping party (yes, food and drink&nbsp; :rock:!) <strong>on December 6th</strong> so we can prepare all our gifts and send them out. Please PM me if you&#039;re interested in helping out. <br /><br />Thanks!&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)<br /><br />p.s. If you&#039;d like to know more about the program: <br />http://nycares.org/volunteer/annual_events/winter_wishes/index.php (http://nycares.org/volunteer/annual_events/winter_wishes/index.php)

				My very first job ever, after school (make that high school) was as a Macy&#039;s gift wrapper. I do good work with the right tools! I do all my friends, family and neighbors holiday gift wrapping. I&#039;ll bring the hot glue gun!

				Thanks guys! For those who can contribute by cash or check, I&#039;d like to collect it all by November 25th (gives our shoppers some time to get the gifts). PM me if you&#039;d like to give it in person and we can arrange a time to meet. Bring the gun, I&#039;ll leave the ribbons.*<br /><br />*There may be cannolis.&nbsp; 8-)

				Ok! I&#039;m back. Wow, what a crazy last week.&nbsp; :cry:<br /><br />Right now we have 3-4 letters we can fulfill, but we need to collect for 4 more Kids&#039; gifts this season, that&#039;s about $200-$300 more. If you can help out with any amount of donation, it would mean a great deal.&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />I&#039;ll be at Grand Cafe this Saturday, November 22nd from 11 am. to 12:30 a.m. with a big envelope where you can give me your donation. I&#039;ll put a sign for Astoria Wishmakers so you can find me.<br /><br />Thanks!&nbsp; :lol:

				Count me in for a money donation. I&#039;d love to help wrap too, although, I&#039;m not the best.&nbsp; I can get money to you on Friday evening or Sat morning. Is that too late?

				Hey there! Nope, not too late. We still have some people who are going to be shopping this weekend, Sunday and Monday, so whatever you can donate, I&#039;ll just add to the big pot of gifts. Thanks! Let me know when/where we can hook up for an exchange. I&#039;m around this week/end if you want to meet. Our official wrapping party is December 6th and I&#039;ll PM you details about that.

				Hey fellow Astorians - <br /><br />My friend emailed a bunch of us about the need for more volunteers for this year&#039;s NY Cares&#039; Winter Wishes Program.&nbsp; Below I&#039;ve directly quoted his email to us.&nbsp; This is one of my favorite volunteer/charity activities and it&#039;s a bit sad (although, expected) that they are also hurting for volunteers during this slow economic season.&nbsp; Anyway, I thought I&#039;d help get the word out:<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">NYCares receives letters from families that are not otherwise able to afford holiday gifts. Then, they look for volunteers who are willing to accept one of those letters and fulfill the wishes of one or more people, whether they be a child, adolescent, adult or senior. The giver gets to select an age group and number of people for whom he or she will buy gifts.<br /><br />The point is that, because the economy is suffering, this charity drive is too. However, I believe that giving in times of scarcity is more urgent, not less. As it stands, there are still about 5000 letters waiting to be answered.<br /><br />Please, give some consideration to taking part in this charity. Even if you don&#039;t want to take part, please tell others in the NYC area about it.<br /><br />You can follow the link below to learn more.<br /><br />http://nycares.org/volunteer/annual_events/winter_wishes/index.php<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to read this, and happy holidays to you all.<br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I already sent off my gifts to my Winter Wisher. (10 year old Fanny living in a shelter)&nbsp; I wish I could do more, though it feels very weird when a 10 year writes a letter to Santa asking for skinny jeans and specific CDs that have parental warning labels.&nbsp; I sent her the jeans and some other stuff but not the CDs.&nbsp; Anyway, I encourage everyone to do this and hope that Fanny enjoys her skinny jeans, etc.

				I started a thread about this a few weeks back and lots of Astorians have joined up with me to donate and fulfill the Santa letters this year. So, thanks to all who&#039;ve contacted me and have contributed. I&#039;m hoping we can all do this again next year!<br /><br />http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=12972.0

				I received my letter on Friday.&nbsp; The 12 year-old boy is asking for rollerblades and a $15 Game Stop gift card.&nbsp; Now the gift card is easy, but the rollerblades aren&#039;t.&nbsp; He didn&#039;t give me his size.&nbsp; Do you guys like I should just get him the gift card but at a larger amount?
