				Yesterday I read that they will be building a 3 story retail space where the CVS on 31st St. and Ditmars is currently located.&nbsp; I hope they will have some good stores there

				The CVS is currently in a 2 story building. It seems weird to be tearing it down to replace it with a new building that will only be one floor higher.

				Or they could simply be adding a third floor like a lot of homes in the area have done over the last couple of years.

				Is the CVS location two story? It looks one story to me. It&#039;s essentially a shell: cheap to build, cheap to pull down. I would think given property prices, putting up a three story building makes senses. <br /><br /><br />There&#039;s no residential on that block. I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s zoned for residential, so am curious what will go into the second and third floors. Offices I guess.<br /><br /><br /><br />Braun: Do you have the link to the article?

				Interesting but wonder how much of a pain it will be to deal with the construction walls, etc. <br /><br /><br />As far as residential, there are some apartments above Igloo and a bit closer towards the train.
