				Hi everyone,<br /><br />I just joined this forum after randomly stumbling upon it, though I&#39;ve been in the area for a year and a half now. <br /><br />Anyway, I&#39;m looking for a gym in the area around the N/W broadway stop. I was considering Synergy, however I read horrible reviews of it online. The other alternative near my apartment would be Fitness Point, they seem to be a lot better price and quality wise.<br /><br />Any thoughts or suggestions from someone in my area? I&#39;m looking for a place that&#39;s not going to cost an arm and a leg, but if it&#39;s for a better quality gym because there&#39;s nothing else cheaply available, it&#39;s worth the extra money.<br /><br />Thanks. Hope to post more soon.

				I have been a member of Fitness Point for about three years now. It is not the fanciest gym around and sometimes the wait time for the machines can be a pain in the neck- but in general it is a decent gym. It is very inexpensive and the sales staff isn&#39;t overly pushy or aggressive which I really like. <br /><br />I have never tried Synergy but I have friends that had memberships there and said that the sales staff was very aggressive to the point of almost harassment. They are also more expensive.<br /><br />If you are looking for a bare bones, inexpensive gym I would say Fitness Point is a good option.<br /><br />My other suggestion is that there are two new gyms being built in the area. I don&#39;t know when they will be completed but if you are not in a rush you could find out a bit more information about them. Try searching this board - there is definitely a thread regarding this (sorry I am not exactly sure how to attach a thread otherwise I would have).<br /><br />Goodluck!

				thanks for your input. I&#39;ve decided on Fitness Point given it&#39;s location is very close to my apartment and it&#39;s cheaper. I&#39;d rather join now while I have the motivation to than wait till the others open and I lose the momentum haha&nbsp; :-)

				Well, a few blocks down, there is the Astoria Sports Complex. I think they are somewhere around $300 a year, but you can also choose &quot;by floor&quot;, i.e., if you want the machines, you choose that floor, if you want cardio, you choose that floor, if you just want a pool, you choose the floor the pool is on, and each floor is $100.&nbsp; At least it was that way the last time I checked.<br />Margaret<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=4858.msg64422.html#msg64422">Quote from: King of Long Island City on March 26, 2007, 05:06:48 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Holy crap, wow!

				ASC is also running a special of if you get the pool you get either the weight room or the cardio room free.<br />i don&#039;t recall the pool price but i do know it is more than the cardio or weight room which are $99 (+initiation fee of $59).
