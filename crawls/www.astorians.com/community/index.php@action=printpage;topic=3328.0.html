				I&#39;m voting for Spitzer on the Democratic line, but if people want to empower third parties, I would suggest the Working Families Party line as they are a real party.&nbsp; The Independent Party is a strange amalgamation of groups and beliefs and is barely a party.&nbsp; At least their leadership is trying to remove the Lenora Fulani faction.

				I am thinking about so many advatages that the Parties in power have.<br />And, I am wondering how many candidates (libertarian and otherwise) might not get fair consideration before the voting audiences.<br /><br />(Waiting to hear back from the LofW Voters.)<br />***<br /><br />I wonder what Spitzer might hope to do for Independents.<br />While I often would disagree with the WFP, they seem to be fairly well organized.<br />Much appreciated that one of their candidates has spoken on protecting home owners from having the Govt. take their property to turn over to private developers.<br /><br />***<br />Some friends might find this off track but one campaign worth a brief bit of your attention:<br /><br />http://www.gpny.org/?page_id=277<br /><br />Malachy McCourt<br /><br />Malachy McCourt, New York Green Party candidate for governor, has already started shaking hands with constituents and kissing babies. He shares a moment with New York State committee members James Lane and Daniella Liebling with their son Xavi at the NYS’s Green Party convention in Albany, NY. (Photo: Deyva Arthur, Green Party of New York State)<br /><br />www.malachyforgovernor.com<br />Terrorism — Malachy McCourt On Sept. 11, 2001 <br />Interviewed by Sean O’Driscoll <br />for Forbes.com<br /><br />How did Sept. 11 change your world?<br /><br />It was an extraordinary morning, because my wife, Diana, and I had just arrived into Newark on a flight from Nova Scotia. We landed at 8:50 a.m., the last flight allowed in from Canada, as it turns out. When we got off the plane, Diana looked up and asked if the World Trade Center always pollutes like that. I said, “That couldn’t be the World Trade Center–it doesn’t have chimneys.”<br /><br />We got to customs, and a woman told us that a small plane hit the World Trade Center. Someone screamed, “There goes another one!” People were as shocked as could be, and we kept looking at each other and saying clichéd things like, “This is unbelievable.” Words were not sufficient to express how you felt, and you kept thinking, “Is that really happening over there?”<br /><br />It took us seven hours to drive back into the city, there was so much traffic and confusion.<br /><br />I later learned that two McCourts died on the second United flight, Ruth McCourt and her 4-year-old daughter, Juliana. This caused great confusion, as we were due to fly out the night before and could have been connecting from Boston. I later contacted Ruth’s husband, David, and we became friends. It became very personal and very, very, very sad.<br /><br />Terror is …<br /><br />When a governmental entity inculcates fear to make people give up their rights. It’s a term that has been so widely abused. George Washington was once labeled a terrorist. The British papers called Gandhi a “bandit in a bedsheet.” We should be very careful, as the biggest threat of terrorism can often come from governments themselves.<br /><br />I’ve always found it interesting that the media refers to “American troops” and “Israeli soldiers,” but to “Lebanese gunmen.” “Soldier” adds a respectability that “gunman” does not. We have to be very wary of these terms and question why they are used. It seems that anyone not making money from a conflict is a “gunman.”<br /><br />I am not afraid of terror groups like al-Qaida; they have only a few hundred members, and there are 300 million of us here in the U.S. I’m much more afraid of the abuse of government power, because its effects can cause so much more harm.<br /><br />Malachy McCourt is a New York-based author and journalist.<br />He is the current Green Party candidate for New York governor. <br /><br />***<br />Malachy on “Hardball with Chris Matthews”!<br /><br />Malachy McCourt, Green Party nominee for NYS Governor, appeared on the nationally-cablecast show “Hardball with Chris Matthews” on Sept. 5th. Although Chris is noted for jumping in and stepping all over his guest’s answers, Malachy held his own, got in the name of our Senate candidate, and some of his positions on the issues, and came across as a serious, but lively, candidate!<br />Click Here to Watch the Sept 5th video of Malachy McCourt on Hardball<br />(May require MS Internet Explorer to run)<br /><br />Transcript<br />MATTHEWS: Welcome back to HARDBALL. The New York state governors race has gotten green. Malachy McCourt, an Irishman if there ever was one, will run for New York state governor on the Green Party ticket. If that name sounds familiar, you might remember a little book called “Angela’s Ashes” by Malachy’s brother Frank. Malachy is the author as well, an activist, an actor, and now a candidate. Welcome.<br /><br />Is this one of these old William F. Buckley/Jimmy Breslin numbers you’re pulling here in New York? <br /><br />MALACHY MCCOURT (GREEN), NEW YORK GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: Well, Buckley said– well, hello, Chris– Buckley said that if he were elected, he would demand a recount, and some people asked me if this some kind of a joke? Well, if you are looking for jokes, try the White House or try the mansion house in Albany. <br /><br />Although I don’t take myself seriously, I take what I do seriously. <br /><br />And…<br /><br />MATTHEWS: OK, why aren’t you a Democrat? Why are you a Green? <br /><br />MCCOURT: Why am I a Green? Because I was a Democrat for years, and I was one of those lesser of two evil kind of types, but then came all these sort of wishy-washy, on one hand, on the other hand, like Hillary Clinton and they’re for the war, they’re not for the war… <br /><br />MATTHEWS: OK, let’s not have any wishy-washy. Where are you on gay marriage? <br /><br />MCCOURT: What’s that? <br /><br />MATTHEWS: Where are you on gay marriage? <br /><br />MCCOURT: Gay marriage, there is no such thing. There’s only marriage of people. Look, Adam-these fundamentalists, if they only knew that Adam when God took one of his ribs, it had the same DNA as him. So when he made Eve out of the rib, that’s exactly same DNA, so Adam was sleeping with himself. So he must have loved himself. So I don’t care-look, Mark Twain said, “I don’t care what you do, so long as you don’t frighten the horses.” <br /><br />(CROSSTALK)<br /><br />MATTHEWS: … make bad comments about people who are gay, as somebody did on this show a couple of weeks ago. Look, let me ask you this. Where are you on capital punishment? <br /><br />MCCOURT: Capital punishment? I think that if-I have got to find that guy in Spain who indicted Pinochet and get him for war crimes, and I get him to do the same thing for Bush. And in that case, I would be for capital punishment. Otherwise, I am against it. <br /><br />Spitzer, who is the other guy running here, he is for capital punishment for those who kill policemen. Well, my son is a cop in New York, and if somebody killed my son, and it wouldn’t do me any good or give me any satisfaction to sit there in some death house in Singh-Singh and watch them put another person to death because they killed my son. That would not cheer me up one bit, Chris. <br /><br />MATTHEWS: You just sound like a liberal Democrat, Malachy. <br /><br />MCCOURT: I’m not liberal. I am a human being, because I grew up in poverty and misery, desperation. And all I want to see is that I want to see a government of the people, by the people, for the people, not over the people. This is the Empire State, and we don’t need an emperor, we need a governor. <br /><br />MATTHEWS: OK. How much love do you have for Hillary Clinton? On the scale of one to 10?<br /><br />MCCOURT: It’s not love. She’s OK. I don’t love her. <br /><br />MATTHEWS: On a scale of one to 10, Hillary Clinton? <br /><br />MCCOURT: Hillary Clinton, one. Not one up top. <br /><br />MATTHEWS: What is your beef?<br /><br />MCCOURT: We have got a great guy, Howie Hawkins, running on the Green Party line. They should vote for him. <br /><br />MATTHEWS: The Green Party seems to have candidates all over the country. Are you really a Naderite, is it connected to Ralph Nader anymore? Is this-is he gone now?<br /><br />MCCOURT: No, no, Ralph is sort of out of the picture right now. People-a lot of people are very angry at him because they felt he lost the elections for the Democrats, but…<br /><br />MATTHEWS: Well, he did cost them Florida. <br /><br />(CROSSTALK)<br /><br />MATTHEWS: That’s a mathematical fact. Ninety thousand votes, and we are screwing around here, looking at chads? Anyway.<br /><br />MCCOURT: Well, I am not getting into that, Chris, because I just joined. <br /><br />MATTHEWS: Well, I had to tell you, I hereby make my stand, I like you already. Malachy McCourt, Green Party candidate…<br /><br />

				<br />(I realize that if this is of any interest to even just one person, it might only be McDirk.)<br /><br /><br />&quot;Sweeney’s Hammer<br /><br />A third-party candidate learns the hard way what it means to be considered a threat<br /><br />Eric Sundwall, Libertarian and former candidate for the 20th Congressional District, has had an exciting, if not exhausting, past six months. “I’m Joe Nobody,” he said. “But I’ve been on TV. I’ve been on radio. I’ve been in the paper. And I had a lot more planned.” <br /><br />A lot more, that is, had his application to be included on the Nov. 4 ballot not failed through objections orchestrated, he said, by top Republican players. <br /><br />Sundwall got the idea to run for U.S. Congress back in January while attending Libertarian Party meetings, he said. At the time, he was irritated that no one was planning to challenge his district’s incumbent representative, John Sweeney (R-Clifton Park). <br /><br />“ ‘I’ll Goddamn do it,’ ” he remembered saying to the group of Libertarians. “ ‘Let’s see what we can do here. Let’s raise some awareness. Let’s do something. Let’s not just sit around and whine and debate. . . . Let’s fight! Let’s fight!’ ” <br /><br />So when July 11 (the legal starting date for third-party candidates’ canvassing period) came around, Sundwall began to scour the district, hitting parades, fairs, farmers’ markets, petitioning to get those 3,500 signatures required by New York state law in order to secure his place on the ballot. By the time the six-week canvassing period was up, he and his volunteers had collected more than 5,300 signatures. <br /><br />A strong showing, Sundwall believed, but it would still prove to be too low. He was in for a taste of what he identified with a smirk as “hardball politics.” <br /><br />After he submitted his application to the state Election Board, three people came forward to object to his petitions. That was, to him, a red flag. Traditionally, third-party candidates fly under the radar, he said, pointing to a fellow Libertarian candidate in another, less-contested district, who submitted far fewer signatures than he did and went unchallenged. So to have three people contest his petitions, he said, seemed particularly odd. <br /><br />However, there is an accepted rule of thumb among party petitioners: Get at least double the signatures needed because challenges to petitions for ballot access are a common occurrence. If a candidate is perceived to be a threat, their petitions will almost definitely be challenged. <br /><br />And as surprising as it may seem, even to Sundwall himself, he said, it appears that he was considered a threat. <br /><br />In a poll of the 20th district voters done in June by Zogby International, Sundwall received 2.4 percent of the vote, pulling mostly from Sweeney supporters. Though the Democratic challenger, lawyer Kirsten Gillibrand, still trails Sweeney, it appears that the Republican camp took that 2.4 percent seriously, Sundwall said, and decided to leave nothing to chance. <br /><br />“I knew the minute that Tom Spargo was involved,” said Sundwall, that “this was a GOP hatchet job.”<br /><br />In order to challenge a candidate’s application for ballot access, a person has to review the candidate’s petitions, explained Warren Redlich, Sundwall’s pro-bono lawyer. The only person to review Sundwall’s petitions, Redlich continued, was Thomas Spargo, noted Republican election-law attorney and former Albany County Supreme Court justice. <br /><br />When Spargo filled out the application to look at the petitions, Redlich said, he indicated that he was doing so “on his own behalf.” <br /><br />“Tom Spargo doesn’t live in Sweeney’s district,” Redlich said. “He cannot challenge petitions in that district. There is no way he was doing that ‘on his own behalf.’ ” <br /><br />It is clear, Redlich alleged, that Spargo was operating on behalf of Sweeney, as Sweeney’s lawyer. <br /><br />“Thomas Spargo, the lawyer who with John Sweeney was in Florida in 2000 challenging Gore . . .” Redlich said. “Spargo, who represented Sweeney weeks ago in the Independence Party petition dispute with Gillibrand; Spargo, who has received $16,000 from John Sweeney according to Federal Election Campaign Finance filings in July and August. . . . I am pretty sure he is Sweeney’s lawyer.” <br /><br />Redlich was quick to point out that he likes and respects Spargo, however. “I am not trying to criticize Tom Spargo,” he said. “I am criticizing John Sweeney . . . [who] rather than challenge the petitions in his own name, utilized three people who are essentially unknown, who have not stepped forward,” to object to Sundwall’s petitions. <br /><br />“What it comes down to is—why isn’t John Sweeney putting his name on it?” <br /><br />In the end, of Sundwall’s 5,300 signatures, only 2,000 passed scrutiny. New York state election laws are very strict, Sundwall said, the smallest infraction in filling out a signatory’s information will automatically disqualify that signature.<br /><br />“We are three hours into this reviewing of the petitions,” Sundwall said, “and we had only gone through a third of them. It’s just heartbreaking to see that your wife forgot to fill out the county. And the guy who’s running for lieutenant governor and is a mathematics professor put in nine instead of 10 signatures. And there goes 10 signatures and those 10 signatures are hard-earned stuff. You are in a farmer’s market, just begging for signatures.” <br /><br />Redlich agreed, saying that it is his belief that half of all election-law cases nationwide are brought in New York. “They make you jump through 17 hoops. Other states don’t have these hoops,” he said, and added, “They are high hoops.” <br /><br />Incidentally, Redlich, who is running for Congress in the 21st District on the GOP line, alleged that he had his own run-in with a Sweeney representative. <br /><br />“I was at an event about two weeks ago, like a credit-union-members, come-and-meet-the-candidates, thing,” Redlich said. “And one of Sweeney’s guys was there, named Chris Nedwick.” Nedwick approached him, he continued, and expressed displeasure with Rep. Mike McNulty (D-Schenectady), Redlich’s opponent in the congressional race. <br /><br />“I guess there is this understanding that a lot of congressmen have,” Redlich said, that “ ‘I won’t go against you in your own district.’ And they felt that McNulty, by supporting Gillibrand, was breaking that deal. So he basically offered me money for my campaign.” <br /><br />Redlich said that he refused the offer.<br /><br />Sweeney’s office did not return calls for an interview.&quot;

				** the election seems forever away; things will change so much in many directions as the weeks go by. Very interesting about the concerns and views of senior voters on foreign affairs in this poll. <br /><br />Hopefully wonderful baseball playoffs will kindly bring some joy during this season. **<br /><br /><br />http://www.zogby.com/index.cfm<br /><br />Republican Candidates Trail Democrats by Just 3%; Bush Job Approval Climbs to 39% <br /><br />Following an aggressive media blitz, the latest Zogby America poll finds the standing of President Bush and congressional Republicans climbing as the November elections rapidly approach.<br /><br />The telephone survey was conducted Sept. 12-14, 2006, included 1,034 respondents, and carries a margin of error of +/– 3.1 percentage points.<br /><br />The poll contains good news for congressional Republicans battling a strong Democratic push to retake the House and Senate. While Republican congressional candidates trailed their Democratic counterparts in the “generic ballot” question by a 39% to 31% margin a month ago, today they have whittled the Democrats’ lead to just three points, 37% to 34%.<br />Coming on the heels of a series of policy speeches culminating in a Sept. 11 address to the nation outlining the President’s vision for domestic anti-terror programs and the War in Iraq, the Zogby survey shows President Bush’s standing has increased five points since mid-August, when just 34% of voters rated him positively. Bush had previously risen to 37% in a Sept. 5 Zogby America poll.<br /><br />The poll does, however, suggest a Democratic strategy of “nationalizing” the mid-term elections has succeeded, with 71% of respondents in the poll saying their vote this fall will be driven by national, rather than local, issues. But voters planning on casting ballots for Republicans are more likely than those voting for Democrats to say they are casting their ballot based on national issues by a 79% to 69% margin. <br /><br />Another positive development for Congressional Republicans is that one in four of their supporters—23%—consider terrorism the top issue as they go to the polls, easily the top issue for those backing the GOP. This is the same percentage as say they will vote for Democrats based on the War in Iraq and general U.S. foreign policy. Republican candidates also continue to benefit from the dual issues of morality and values, which are motivating one in nine voters planning to pull the Republican lever this fall. Another 8% of GOP supporters say the War in Iraq and U.S. foreign policy are their prime motivators.<br /><br />For Democrats, meanwhile, the war in Iraq is clearly the top issue, at 23%. But more traditional Democratic issues like jobs and the economy (14%), education (10%), and healthcare (5%) round out the top four issues for Democratic voters. Terrorism barely registers, at 4%, while the environment is a non-issue for Democrats at 2%, despite repeated discussion over the past year of global climate change.<br /><br />War in Iraq, Terror Dominate Mid-Terms<br />Among those voters who say national issues are motivating them at the ballot box, the war in Iraq is clearly the most important single issue, with 22% indicating they will cast their ballot based on the conflict. Terrorism, meanwhile, follows at 14%.<br /><br />The Iraq War remains unpopular, with a narrow 51% majority saying the conflict has not been worth the loss of American lives, with 42% say it has. Interestingly the survey finds that seniors are among the least favorable in their view of the war, with 58% saying it has not been worth the loss of lives, while middle-aged Americans—those 30 to 49—are closely divided, with 49% saying the war has not been worth the loss of American lives while 46% say it has. Voters under the age of 30 are less sure, with 49% believing the war has not been worth the losses, 39% believing it has been, and 12% undecided—the most of any age group.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, Republicans and Democrats continue to view the war in different terms. While 68% of Republicans say the war has been worth the cost in lives, 76% of Democrats disagree. Democrats seem Still, the overall numbers represent a marked shift from early September, when 58% of likely voters said the Iraq War has not been worth the lives lost.<br /><br />Despite Close Battle, Congress Remains Unpopular<br />Regardless of the late GOP surge, Congress continues to be viewed negatively by the vast majority of voters. Just 19% of those polled had a favorable impression of Congress’s performance on the job—a number that cut across party and geographic lines.<br /><br />Pollster John Zogby:“Both parties can find advantages in our latest polling. Democrats have partly succeeded in making the congressional races about national issues – now the question is whether they will succeed in providing an alternative to Republicans. Republicans are helped by President Bush&#39;s improving job approval numbers and by cutting the lead of Democrats in congressional races. While the Republicans benefit from voters who are concerned about the war on terror and moral issues, Democrats are helped by voters who are most concerned about the Iraq war or the economy.”<br />

				October 9 is the PFLAG-NYC dinner (on which I serve on the dinner committee) - what else is up that night?<br />I think the Democratic base is going to turn out this time (of course, I thought that in 1998, 2000, 2002 and 2004 and look what that got me).&nbsp; I think the Republican base is disillusioned with Bush, the more sane Republicans because of his excesses, and the social conservatives as he hasn&#39;t succeeded in delivering much to them except verbal support.&nbsp; I think Independents are breaking Democrat, but that could be me being overly optimistic.&nbsp; I think a lot of Republicans are either going to stay home, vote Democrat or vote third-party this cycle.&nbsp;

				As others would consider, voting is important; counting the votes may be more important.<br /><br />I appreciate that there is greater interest in who runs the election process in various states.<br /><br />While Democrats may be poised around the country for a rally to their party, I will believe it when the votes are counted.<br /><br />Next up, some expected small ring debate programming.

				How many third parties would be on the ballot?<br />other than Green or Libertarian ??<br /><br />http://www.politics1.com/ny.htm<br /><br />I have yet to see from the Board of Elections what is the final listing of candidates.<br />Is this a trick question just to get me to write that there may be not 1 but 2 Socialist candidates for US Senate.<br /><br />But wait, there is more, you may have a chance to vote for Governor for<br />Rent Is Too Damn High<br />(from a surprise smash run for NYC mayor.) (and with concerns for Veteran issues.)<br /><br />It appears that Right to Life may not have gotten past qualifying.<br />But perhaps Faso would welcome votes from their supporters.<br /><br />As for Independence, Conservative and Working Families, some do not really consider them distinct from Republican and Democrat.<br />But I think it could be interesting to see how many votes Spitzer and Faso get on those lines.<br /><br />***<br />some more golden days for baseball before the big Nov election<br /><br />

				I love the name of the Rent Is Too Damn High party and like the concept, but the main guy there, is according to news reports, a raging anti-Semite, so I can&#39;t vote on their line.

				What a provocative statement.<br /><br />Imagine if someone said there are reports that Clinton is an anti-semite.<br />Of course, I would not believe it.<br />Everyone knows she is actually anti-arab<br />(sarcasm).<br /><br />I would be very happy if all the haters, racists were out of office.<br />Incumbency can be very powerful.<br />

				** I definitely plan to take a look at Rachel Treichler&#39;s campaign **<br /><br />Rachel Calls for Real Debates with Dissenting Voices Included<br /><br />http://www.voterachel.org/<br /><br />Rachel Calls for Real Debates with Dissenting Voices Included <br />September 21, 2006. Hammondsport. Rachel announced today that she has invited the other New York Attorney General candidates: Andrew Cuomo, the Democratic Party candidate, Christopher Garvey, the Libertarian Party candidate, Martin Koppel, the Socialist Workers Party candidate and Jeanine Pirro, the Republican Party candidate, to join her in a series of debates this fall.<br /><br />&quot;Including all the candidates on the ballot in the attorney general debates will increase voter interest in the election, and will raise voter turnout in November,&quot; Rachel asserted. &quot;It is particularly important that voters learn about all the candidates in New York&#39;s attorney general race this fall. This election is the last election New York will conduct on its lever voting machines. The next Attorney General needs to take legal action to block the use of unconstitutional voting equipment and make sure that the right of each New York voter to vote and to have his or her vote counted is protected. A poll reported in late August 2006 by Rasmussen Reports found that voters in New York are more likely than voters in any other state to express a concern about voter suppression. Thirty-four percent (34%) of the New York voters surveyed hold this view. We need an attorney general who will make protecting our right to free and fair elections his or her top priority. Neither Cuomo or Pirro has addressed this issue. New Yorkers need to hear the candidates&#39; views on this issue.<br /><br />&quot;We need dissenting voices to create real debate. When third party candidates are excluded from debates, the major party candidates are shielded from addressing issues the public wants debated. Many of the issues New Yorkers care most about— the war in Iraq, the expanding prison/industrial complex, the poisoning of our environment, and corporate domination of our elections—have been ignored by both Cuomo and Pirro. To a growing number of New Yorkers, it is not coincidental that the larger campaign contributors to both candidates benefit from ignoring such issues. With third party candidates excluded, the debates become glorified bipartisan news conferences, in which the candidates exchange memorized soundbites. Genuine debates provide a rare opportunity to hear candidates&#39; ideas unedited and in context.<br /><br />&quot;The League of Women Voters has not invited third party candidates to join their debates for the general election this fall. The League&#39;s claims to be nonpartisan and acting in the interests of voter education don&#39;t seem to mean anything when it comes to organizing debates,&quot; Rachel said.<br />

				<br />FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE <br /><br />NY LIBERTARIANS BACK FEDERAL EMINENT DOMAIN REFORM BILL <br /><br />Albany, NY 9/25/06 -- New York Libertarians are calling on US Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) to unblock legislation that would deny federal economic development funds for two fiscal years to governments that use eminent domain to transfer property to private developers. State Libertarian Chair Richard Cooper terms such economic development schemes “unconstitutional eminent domain abuse and legalized theft.” The “Private Property Protection Act of 2006” must be brought up for a vote by September 29th or die without action. <br /><br />The NY Libertarians have been active on eminent domain cases with some partial victories such as St. Luke’s Pentecostal Church in Nassau County. Cooper and the Libertarians vow to fight eminent domain abuse wherever and whenever it occurs. Currently, they are most concerned about the Atlantic Yards Nets Arena in Brooklyn. <br /><br />Libertarian US Senate candidate Jeffrey Russell declares that “The Fifth Amendment clearly limits the power of eminent domain to taking property for public use. It does not grant the government the power to take private property from one individual and give it to another individual. Governments should not be allowed to seize private property simply because they believe they can get more tax revenues. When property is taken for public use, the Fifth Amendment clearly states that there must be just compensation.” <br /><br />Libertarian gubernatorial candidate John Clifton proclaims that &quot;When property is not for sale, it should not be subject to being stolen. There should be no use of government at any level to seize private property to benefit private developers. From Nets Arena downstate to New York Regional Interconnect power line upstate, developers should acquire property the old fashioned way---through negotiation and purchase contract---and not through land-grabbing. Thou shalt not steal.&quot; <br /><br />–30- <br /><br /><br />
