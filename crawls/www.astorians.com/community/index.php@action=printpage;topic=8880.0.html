				hey there...<br /><br />I&#039;m new to astoria, and absolutely loving it although often I don&#039;t get home until late (and tend to wake up with little time to spare before going off to work), so I&#039;m keeping fingers crossed that a 24 laudromat is somewhere around the Ditmars stop. <br /><br />Anyone know of one?<br /><br />Thanks in advance!<br /><br />

				I don&#039;t think there is one, at least not one convenient to my place on Ditmars. The one next to Trade Fair takes laundry until around 9 every night, though you might have to withstand a frown from people working there if you show up that late (they&#039;re open until 11 or 11:30). I work nights and have gotten to the point where it&#039;s very difficult to get myself up two hours early to do laundry, so I know how you feel. Doing laundry on weekends sucks because the laundromat is always packed. I&#039;m lucky if I get out of work before 11, so after work is out of the question for me with no 24-hour place.

				24th Avenue laundry is not open 24 hrs (i think there hours are 6A- 11P most days) but they are one of very few places that will do your laundry same day locally, usually in a couple of hours. They are more expensive then the other places but, they are well staffed and will do same day service even on the weekends.

				I also don&#039;t think there are any 24-hour &#039;mats in that area. <br /><br />Related, however--does anyone know if any of the Ditmars laundromats (Sunbright on 31st, Seven btw 35th and 36th, the one by Trade Fair) will be open tomorrow?

				I have lived in the area for over 2 years now and have not come across one.&nbsp; This is in the vicinity of 42nd street to the train.&nbsp; I believe they are all are 6AM to 11PM.&nbsp; At least House Of Sudz at Ditmars/42nd is.
