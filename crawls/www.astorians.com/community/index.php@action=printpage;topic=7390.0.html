				FYI everybody: Best Yet Supermarket on 19 Ave and 37th Street now has a nearly full stock of 5 Boroughs Ice Cream. This was as of around 3:00 this afternoon. I got the Landfill and Cha Cha Chocolate flavors. Only one I didn&#039;t see was NYPB, but there&#039;s a chance it was hiding behind other ones because I didn&#039;t dig around. And no, no Bakla-Wah.

				Better yet, find them the baklava to incorporate into the ice cream.&nbsp; Something to the affect of not being able to obtain it from their supplier.&nbsp; I could be wrong but from what I understood, that was the problem.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m dying to try that flavor myself.

				In a recent article in the NYT they said it was temporarily unavailable because of production issues. And the baklava is from Victory Sweet Shop.<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/business/yourmoney/22homefront.html?_r=2&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;adxnnlx=1185291430-THgvNMeoSQfhsThz7SuoXA (it&#039;s archived already...grumble)

				I have to say that the Landfill flavor is impossibly delicious. It is amazing, although the list of ingredients is rather atrocious (it&#039;s not &quot;all natural&quot;). I will happily finish that one over the next week. I tried a small spoonful of the Cha Cha Chocolate tonight. Initially I thought it was just pleasantly spiced, but then my tongue started burning and I started coughing. I&#039;ll probably end up donating that to my boyfriend.

				Yeah, we thought the Cha Cha would be like a nice spiced hot coco--alas, it was pure chocolate fury.&nbsp; If you&#039;re looking for more the spiced hot coco flavor, Haagen Dazs makes one called Mayan Chocolate that&#039;s a lot gentler.<br /><br />I really shouldn&#039;t be thinking about ice cream at 8:50AM...

				When I picked up the Cha cha chocolate, I was actually hoping for something like the hagen dasz mayan chocolate, which is probably the best chocolate ice cream I&#039;ve ever had.&nbsp; I love spicy food so the cha cha chocolate was great, but others were torn.&nbsp; I still need to find the landfill and the nypb, but so far, of the three flavors I&#039;ve tried, I loved all of em.&nbsp;

				I love the cha cha chocolate!&#160;&nbsp; :lol:&#160; It&#039;s actually got several levels of heat that hit you at different times, and I find it reallly intriguing in addition to really liking the flavour.&nbsp; Landfill is also really good - those are the only two flavours I&#039;ve tried so far, but I&#039;m looking forward to trying more.

				Peeps, you MUST get NYPB if its in stock next time you&#039;re ice cream shopping. I don&#039;t even like chocolate ice cream (blasphemy, I know), and it&#039;s AWESOME on about a million levels.

				Not to be a pooper, :-o&nbsp; but after buying and then reading the label I saw &quot;corn syrup&quot; in the ingredients. Would rather support a local place if they were using better ingredients. Isn&#039;t corn syrup for stability? Why would they need that if they&#039;re local and Breyer&#039;s &quot;natural,&quot; gets away with just sugar?&nbsp; :|

				Where is it on the ingredient list?&#160; Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory also uses small amounts of corn syrup in their ice cream, to help scoopability.&nbsp; It&#039;s excellent ice cream.&#160; He is very serious about the quality of his ingredients and does not use it as a sweetener (he uses turbinado sugar as the sweetener in flavours with added sugar).&#160; It may be the same with 5 Boroughs.

				I tried the amaretto flavor and was very disappointed.&nbsp; There was so much cinnamon in the ice cream that it completely overpowered the taste of the amaretto.
