Everyone is entitled to believe or not believe.&nbsp; I consider this too, a way of government interfering in my life.<br /><br />Finally, less government = Katrina disaster.&nbsp; If a hurricane hits our city, and no one is there to assist us, we will all be in the same boat (rhetorically), conservative, liberal, gay, straight, black, white.&nbsp; The only difference is that the wealthy will be able to get out quicker (they will probably use private planes and helicopters) and the poor will be stuck in flooding basements.<br /><br />To me, there is more government where they need not ought to be and less government where we need it.<br /><br />I would love to hear how Conservatives, who supposedly believe in less government feel about these points.&nbsp; <br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I suppose I am what passes as a conservative here, so I&#039;ll try to address some of your questions to the best of my ability.&nbsp; Though please be mindful of the fact that I am speaking for myself, and not some monolithic &quot;conservative&quot; group.&nbsp; I also don&#039;t believe that &quot;liberals&quot; and &quot;conservatives&quot; are two groups for which there is a single, cohesive voice.<br /><br />On the issue of the FBI infringing upon lawful activist activity, I personally believe this is wrong headed on their part.&nbsp; No purpose is served by messing with your EZ Pass.&nbsp; However, I do find it to be a matter of concern that some of the peace organizations have distinct communist or socialist leanings.&nbsp; True, people have the right in this country to cling to a failed ideology, but communist organizations have the nasty habit of undermining legitimate governments.&nbsp; So in the extreme and improbable case that there is some organization plotting to overthrow the government, I would be in favor of the Feds being all over that.&nbsp; Also, I feel that the Feds as well as local law enforcement have the duty to intervene when lawful protest behavior becomes unlawful.&nbsp; For example, blocking the roads or otherwise trying to bring a shut down to the lawful activities that other people wish to engage in.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure that the founding fathers would be with me on that one.<br /><br />As far as the undercover cops looking for men having sex with other men, I don&#039;t think you&#039;re looking at it in quite the right way.&nbsp; People in this country have the freedom to engage in whatever acts of sexual congress they wish.&nbsp; That freedom does not extend to public bathrooms.&nbsp; I am sure that if you attempted to have heterosexual sex in a public bathroom and were caught by the same cop, you&#039;d suffer a similar fate.&nbsp; For obvious logistical reasons, same sex cruising is much more prevalent in public restrooms than opposite sex cruising.&nbsp; Also, I am not sure what you mean by the hypocrisy of the &quot;right,&quot; as I am quite sure that if you try, you&#039;ll find hypocrites of all political leanings.<br /><br />I don&#039;t like religion mixing with politics either, and I am sure that many conservatives feel the same way.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how the government is interfering with your life in the religion department, but if they are, they should not be.<br /><br />Regarding the Katrina situation, I would say that the primary failure was on the part of the local government.&nbsp; It is the responsibility of the state and localities to mitigate natural disasters, with the assistance of the federal government.&nbsp; There were obvious failures at the federal level, but the main burden rests with the locals on this one.&nbsp; Also, I am not sure how bigger government would have worked in this case.&nbsp; Look, we have a whole big FEMA bureaucracy.&nbsp; But it failed.&nbsp; I&#039;d say the issue is not increasing the size and scope of the Federal government, but making sure that the government that we do have gets it right the first time.<br /><br />Also, not sure why three people thumbed me down on the comment I made above, about Jimmy Justice.&nbsp; Perhaps they misunderstood and thought I was talking about someone on this board?&nbsp; If so, please read my thread.&nbsp; And if the thumbs down were legitimate, I wonder who is in favor of a guy who in the course of waging his vigilante war against parking violations called a woman a cu*t.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_93963">The conservatives of today are, for the most part, are about as conservative as the Liberals are liberals in Austrialia.&nbsp; A conservative of today is more likely to be a right winger then a proponent for less government.&nbsp; I think the mix-up comes from the idea of conservative moral values, along with the slogans often used by the right to&nbsp; (It never made sense to me how Republicans used the phrase &quot;tax and spend&quot; to describe the Donkeys while Reagan was putting this country on a permanent deficit spending program).&nbsp; Without being super up on my terms, I&#039;d guess a libertarian is more like what an old style &quot;less government&quot; conservative would be.<br /><br />And as far as I know, a libertarian would be disgusted by the FBI investigation of peace groups (and the pretext of such investigations, that such might have communist slants is even more appalling.&nbsp; According to the FBI, the Civil Rights movement had communist slants.&nbsp; Though a support for such movements by communists and socialists is certain, to note that the civil rights and peace movements are pinkish is just red baiting).&nbsp; They&#039;d also be disgusted to have public funds to conduct sting operations of sex in bathrooms, be it between men, women or goats.&nbsp; A true old style conservative would never mix politics and religion.&nbsp; As for Katrina, that was a local problem all the way.&nbsp; A true conservative allows for bigger federal government to assist in situations which dwarf the reasonable resources of a local government, however, (and here comes the PC negative nods!) those folks brought it upon themselves.&nbsp; I lived there for two years.&nbsp; Hurricane planning and preperation was a corrupt joke produced by an apathetic citzenry.&nbsp; A bigger FEMA would have not have helped.&nbsp; </div>

Most of these people are shell-shocked by the direction the Republican Party is headed in. <br /><br />The rhetoric of limited government has become dissonant. Prescription drug benefit plans? Airline bailouts? Adding trillions of dollars to the national debt?&nbsp; <br /><br />Some may have held their noses and voted for Bush the first time, simply because they were unwilling to chance Gore. But by the second election, most of the dudes of this sort that I know were politically homeless. Bitterly disappointed, they joined an amorphous group of third party voters and nonvoters who find Republicans and Democrats more allied than not in the alarming growth of state power at the expense of individual liberty.</div>

It&#039;s called democracy - and all you need is a 2/3 vote and you can change anything you want.<br /><br />Overthrowing the government by force is what&#039;s illegal. It&#039;s important to make that distinction.<br /><br />Even if peace groups were plotting to overthrow the government I find it hard to believe they would support doing so by force. <br /><br />Trying to stop groups from overthrowing the government by peaceful and democratic means is the antithesis of the content of the founding documents and is against what the founding fathers envisioned for this country.</div>

There is something utterly absurd and infuriating about how Che t-shirts are commonplace at &quot;peace&quot; rallies. It&#039;s pathetic. There is nothing less peaceful than a socioeconomic system based on coercive wealth transfers and central economic planning, and yet, advocates of such systems are popular at &quot;peace&quot; rallies all over the world. D&#039;oh!&nbsp; <img src="http://www.astorians.com/community/Smileys/SoLoSMiLeYS1/cry.gif" alt="&#58;cry&#58;" title="cry" class="smiley" /> <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=7994.msg94088#msg94088">Quote from: Debbie on September 24, 2007, 09:50:43 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The hypocrisy that I am referring to is this:<br /><br />Extolling family values while having affairs.<br />Preaching against homosexuality while having sex with the same gender.<br />Talking about freedom while spying on your own people.<br />Claiming that you are a devout Christian while your actions indicate otherwise.<br /><br />My question to the Conservatives on this board is simple.&nbsp; I would like to know what you think about the hypocrisy.&nbsp; I would like to know what you think about all the Republicans who have been caught lying, cheating and participating in illegal activities while condemning such actions.&nbsp; Saying that Democrats doing the same thing is not responding to my question.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>&nbsp; <br /><br />1. The impact of fundamentalist religious premises on a person&#039;s sexuality is essentially catastrophic. The repressed homosexual conservative is juggling a lot. On the one hand, eternal damnation, on the other hand, natural desires. On the one hand, incentives to present a certain appearance in order to preserve a political career/reputation/marriage, on the other hand, a basic human need to experience a little happiness in this life (i.e., anonymous sex in bathrooms). You can call Craig a hypocrite, because he is one, but his life&#039;s tragedy is played out in the lives of so many people, and &quot;hypocrite&quot; doesn&#039;t really cover the extent of the tragedy. <br /><br />2. What decent person who happens to affiliate himself/herself with any political party would feel anything but contempt for the hypocrisy of political leaders who vote one way and behave contradictorily? What is your point, Debbie? I mean, of course you cringe when members of the party of civil liberties vote to increase the power and budget of the drug enforcement agency, or when the Supreme Court&#039;s liberals vote against homeowners&#039; rights (Kelo vs. New London), or when the Democrats continue to vote to fund the Iraqi war, or when the party that supposedly values education votes regularly to stifle competitive forces and innovation in that arena and instead placates the teachers&#039; union?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=7994.msg94088#msg94088">Quote from: Debbie on September 24, 2007, 09:50:43 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">My personal favorites include Larry Craig, Mark Foley, Bob Allen, Glenn Murphy Jr and my all time favorite is Ted Haggard.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard that Ted went through some sort of ritual which &#039;cured&#039; him of homosexuality.&nbsp; Amazing!<br /><br />Others include Scooter Libby, Jack Abramoff, Tom Delay, Paul Wolfowitz and the lesser known Lester Crawford, Rick Renzi, Steven Griles and Dusty Foggo.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br />Conservatives are just going to say what leftists would say about the same phenomena: when they betrayed the values they espoused, it was disappointing, frustrating, enraging....<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=7994.msg94088#msg94088">Quote from: Debbie on September 24, 2007, 09:50:43 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I am not saying that Democrats do not have scandals.&nbsp; They do, but they do not necessarily claim to be the party of family values, God and Christian virtues.<br /><br />Can someone please explain this to me?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I can&#039;t explain it without attacking mysticism. <br /><br />&quot;The party of family values, God, and Christian virtues.&quot; Sounds like a pretty arbitrary political party. I mean, really, what is your basis for expecting such a party to engage in logically consistent moral behavior? Of course, the Republican Party does still have some principled advocates of limited government, but those voices have been marginalized by both parties.<br /><br />On the other hand, the Democrats seem to kind of sort of want to be known as the party of Reason, and yet they fall over themselves to trumpet their religious credentials, they advocate &quot;progressive&quot; economic policies that nearly all modern economists agree and mountains of readily available data confirm are simply harmful and irrational, and they are as motivated as Republicans by a set of corrupt incentives that make it nearly impossible for any of them to consistently preserve our liberties. Check out &quot;public choice theory&quot; at wikipedia, Debbie.<br /><br />The problem is not Democrats. The problem is not Republicans. The problem is Professional Politicians, the incentives inherent to public sector institutions. The problem is an electorate distracted by the promises of free lunches. There ain&#039;t no f-ing thing as a free lunch!</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_94123">Adam, well done.&nbsp; Seriously well done.<br /><br />Debbie, not to be contentious, but what is the point of your questions?&nbsp; Are you honestly seeking a better understanding of people who don&#039;t share your belief system?&nbsp; Your first mistake is that you are looking to engage with a monolithic &quot;conservative voice&quot;.&nbsp; I would argue that such a voice does not exist, nor does a monolithic &quot;liberal&quot; voice.&nbsp; No two people have identical beliefs, whether they are in the same party or not.&nbsp; <br /><br />Again, I&#039;m not trying to be a snot.&nbsp; But it seems to me that you are looking to bait or goad conservatives into an argument in the mold of &quot;A Modest Proposal.&quot;&nbsp; We all understand that you are very frustrated with the policies of the Bush administration.&nbsp; I am too, in very many regards, and I self identify as a moderate conservative.&nbsp; But you are asking people to explain their belief system in an unfair fashion.&nbsp; According to your equation, conservatives are supposedly the party of God, so they should have to answer for their faults while liberals should not.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think that&#039;s a very fair calculus.&nbsp; First of all, not every conservative wishes for a &quot;party of God.&quot;&nbsp; I don&#039;t, as I believe in the separation of church and state.&nbsp; Second of all, I am disgusted when people in <strong>either</strong> political party do things that are hypocritical, or wrong.&nbsp; For the record, in order to be a hypocrite, you have to be duplicitous or insincere in your beliefs.&nbsp; So Craig, for example, is not necessarily a hypocrite.&nbsp; He might believe in his heart of hearts that homosexual acts are wrong, yet still engage in them.&nbsp; Of course, I find Craig disgusting not because I am against homosexuality (I am not), but because I think that the solicitation of a sex act in a public bathroom where children could be present, is disgusting.&nbsp; On a similar token, Congressman Jefferson of Louisiana might not be a hypocrite either.&nbsp; He could believe that taking bribes is wrong, but still feel compelled to do so.&nbsp; I would argue that his offense is at least as disgusting because it involves a more direct and willful violation of the public trust.<br /><br />If you would honestly like to discuss how my beliefs compare and contrast with yours, I am more than happy to go down that road.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s great to learn about what other people believe.&nbsp; That is how we reinforce our own beliefs.&nbsp; And of course, I can&#039;t claim to speak for &quot;conservatives,&quot; as I don&#039;t believe in such a monolithic group.&nbsp; So, sure, I&#039;ll discuss what I believe.&nbsp; But the way in which you frame your questions makes me suspicious that you have likely already made up your mind, and you&#039;re just fixing to let out your pent up feelings about the way things are going in this country.</div>

I&#039;m pro-gay, pro-porn, pro-prostitution, pro-legalization, pro-gun, pro-flag burning, pro-Constitution, pro-free trade (w/out govt involvement), pro-atheism, pro-free thought, pro-crap TV, pro-gangsta rap, pro-trash culture.<br /><br />Don&#039;t like it? then don&#039;t do it. Just don&#039;t tell me what I should or shouldn&#039;t like. And don&#039;t even think about using my tax money to push your preferences on me. That goes for PC group-think and the canard of preventing &quot;hate speech.&quot; What a crock...</div>

Although she has the unscrupulous audacity to suggest that she&#039;ll do this without imposing higher costs on taxpayers and consumers and business owners, there is this annoying thing called REALITY that can&#039;t be evaded in the end.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not going to take the time in this post to point out the problems with each of these proposals one-by-one. But here are some of the problems with her proposals, on principle, in general, based on current, up-to-date economic science.<br /><br />1. Central planning of human behavior on a societal level is both extraordinarily inefficient and lethal to human progress. Why? <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a) There is a knowledge problem: specifically, there are no experts capable of knowing from one moment to the next what are the best ways for individuals to use their time, skills, and resources, the best ways for them to respond to adversity and opportunity, the best ways for them to develop and adapt, intellectually, emotionally, professionally as unique individuals. Furthermore, it is impossible for a central planner to implement policies that respect individual choice and experimentation; the nature of central planning is to substitute objective plans and priorities for subjective individual plans and priorities. Human progress is based on dynamic and spontaneous discovery and experimentation, which complying with &quot;expert&quot; plans discourages and destroys. Examples? See the world today. The rate of discovery and innovation is greatest in the countries whose governments are least interventionist. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b) There is the conceit of expertise: specifically, once central planning starts, its systematic response to its own failures is to introduce more and more &quot;expertise&quot;, in the form of more severe and ubiquitous interventions. Today, government involvement in health care has produced myriad problems (e.g., people don&#039;t think they are responsible for their own health care spending because employers are mandated to provide coverage, insurance companies are far too involved in common interactions between doctors and patients). Of course, Hillary&#039;s solution involves the introduction of more government experts and less individual choice.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c) Central planning versus PROFIT/LOSS system: when you and I approve of goods and services offered at prices we can afford, we buy them up, and both the consumer and producer win. Competition ensures that some producers will make money, while others will fail. Most entrepreneurs fail a couple of times, but they learn from their losses and adapt. The best of them end up succeeding in proportion to their ability to offer you and me something we value for less than it costs them to produce it. ON THE OTHER HAND, central planning government officials are not bound by Profit/Loss parameters. They regularly force us to pay for things and services we don&#039;t want at higher prices than we would ever be willing to pay voluntarily. They have no systemic profit/loss system to learn from. In fact, they actually have institutional incentives to spend more than they should on projects that are failing, because doing so becomes the basis for requesting budgetary increases. The current debt of the country, tens of trillions of dollars, is a reflection both of the electorate&#039;s willingness to tolerate the deferred costs of free lunch programs and politicians&#039; understanding free lunch promises &quot;work&quot; for only one purpose, getting them re-elected.<br />&nbsp;<br />2. What happens when a scarce resource is declared &quot;free&quot;? What happens when the government acts to distort prices?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a) Prices play a critical role in human society. They communicate information that is vital to our daily decision making about how we invest and spend our time and money. Many of us try to increase the price of our labor and/or products so that we can afford the prices of things we aspire to experience (home ownership, travel, hobbies, new socks). Some of us are happy to pay the price of an iPod, while others of us would rather pay the price of a car rental for a weekend hiking experience. Our responses to prices are completely subjective, based on specifics of time and place and individuality and culture. In this way, prices arise spontaneously, they are not planned by experts. They are a result of human behavior, not of human design.<br /><br />What happens when prices are designed? When an expert says, THE PRICE OF LABOR CANNOT BE LOWER THAN $8.00 AN HOUR -or- THE PRICE OF HEALTH CARE WILL NOW BE $0.00.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b) The &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; is a description of how people overuse resources that are priced at $0.00. This should be intuitive to most of us, but people are often blinded to the problems that arise from it by the prospect of utopian results. &quot;Everyone will have health care! How can that be bad?&quot; Here&#039;s how. When the population of doctors are declared a public resource that can be used without cost, they become over-used and poorly compensated. The impact on a doctor&#039;s incentive to provide the highest quality of care possible is extraordinarily negative. Why aspire to be the best doctor if your time and expertise will always be valued at the same rate? Would you try to be the best at what you do if there were no increased compensation associated with greater knowledge and skill? In every country that has socialized medicine, there are 2 discernible phenomena: (1) the best doctors and researchers leave (brain drain) for countries where they will be better compensated, and (2) fewer people go into medicine and medical research, leading to a shortage of medical providers to a population that believes it is entitled to cost-free care... which leads to waiting lists for life-saving procedures and reduced access to medical breakthroughs (in France, for example, a huge percentage of men die of prostate cancer compared to the mortality rate in the U.S.). <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; c) When the price of labor is set artificially high, the employers have 4 choices: not hire labor they could really use, making it hard for them to grow their business; hire labor off the books, which opens them up to fines and lawsuits, making it harder for them to grow a business;&nbsp; fire labor to make up for increased labor costs, which is a tragedy for the business owner and the lost employees; or move business to a place that lets them hire labor at costs they can afford, which unnecessarily disrupts a business and harms the economic prospects of a community.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who the hell is any one of us to presume to interfere with a voluntary, mutual contract between an employer and a laborer?&nbsp; Some of us think that labor should have an OBJECTIVE price, but, as I&#039;ve described above, that is not how pricing works. Costs of living and costs of starting different businesses vary across the country, the world. Employers need the flexibility of contracting for labor at lower costs, and low-skilled laborers need the job opportunities that arise from an unregulated, highly competitive industry. The particular circumstances of a person, his educational background and life experience and skill set, may mean that his labor is worth a low price to one employer or another AT A SPECIFIC MOMENT IN A SPECIFIC PLACE. But that person&#039;s labor price is not static. His economic opportunities will improve as he gains experience, especially if he applies himself, learns and improves, increases his prospective value to others.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shouldn&#039;t we all want as low a barrier to gaining work experience as possible, and as dynamic a set of opportunities for employees to increase their labor price as possible?<br /><br />****<br /><br />I could go on and on.<br /><br />The question is, Debbie, when are Democrats, mainstream Democrats, going to stop worshiping the cult of the omnipotent, benevolent State? As a bleeding heart libertylover who cares as much as any leftist alleges to about the plight of the poor and disenfranchised, I wonder when the Left&#039;s leadership is going to acknowledge that economic liberty is as essential as any other liberty to a progressive human society. </div>
