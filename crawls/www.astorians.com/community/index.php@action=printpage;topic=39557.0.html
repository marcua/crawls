				What a drag!&nbsp; This bit is on their homepage.<br /><br />&quot;It is with great sadness that I write Tufino suffered a fire yesterday!! Unfortunately we will be closed for awhile to rebuild. We are hopeful that we will be back up and running soon and better than ever! Thank you to our loyal customers for your support!&quot;<br /><br />I remember the fire several years ago by the Ditmars stop that wiped out the Italian Restaurant called &quot;Thirty One&quot;&nbsp; They never recovered, sadly. Good luck to Tufino.&nbsp; I like that place a lot.&nbsp; I hope they come back better than ever.

There were people there checking out the damage. Lots of water on the floor and that damp, distinct &quot;just put out a structure fire&quot; smell that is so awful. From the little bit I could glance in the front of the building, it didn&#039;t look destroyed but it&#039;s safe to say there was definitely damage. Even if the fire wasn&#039;t too big and was caught early, the floor was swamped.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Anyone know how it started? I am guessing it is related to their wood fired oven, but that is purely a guess.<br /><br />

				<br />It seems &#039;odd&#039; to me that I&#039;ve yet to notice any kind of repairs occurring.&nbsp; I wonder if this fire was enough to take the wind out of their sails...maybe they aren&#039;t sure they have the energy/desire to repair and re-open?<br /><br />What I also found very strange was....maybe two weeks ago, there was a firetruck right in front of Tufino, and a few firefighters were on the sidewalk, and they appeared to be &#039;checking&#039; for something by the door just to the right of Tufino&#039;s.&nbsp; No idea what was going on, and when I later walked by again, I think the truck was still there, but nothing &#039;urgent&#039; seemed to be going on.&nbsp; So not sure what that was all about...

				I&#039;d bet they don&#039;t reopen.&nbsp; We had some very good pizza there but there was always something lacking.&nbsp; Poor service or disinterested staff.&nbsp; It never seemed like a well-run operation or with any passion behind it.&nbsp; We never left feeling like it was a great experience.&nbsp; Just a decent pizza meal.&nbsp; Along similar lines, I can&#039;t believe Via Vai (around the corner) is still in business either.&nbsp; Worst pizza I ever ate in Astoria.&nbsp; And remember that awful place with the gaudy design up on Ditmars closer to Steinway?&nbsp; It seems that pizza is a tough business on Ditmars!&nbsp; Albas has a good thing going.
