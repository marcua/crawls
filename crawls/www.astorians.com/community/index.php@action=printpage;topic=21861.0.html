				Hi , welcome . Astoria has many great areas but it all depends what you are looking for .&nbsp; Broadway and 30th ave are more busy areas with more food places and bar/lounges. There is alot of traffic , late night noise and people going by at all hours , especially during the weekends .&nbsp; Ditmars Blvd area is more residential and the flow is much less and after dark it really slows down . There are plenty of places to eat but only not as many bars as those other areas.&nbsp; It is also the last stop on the train station so in the morning you are pretty much guaranteed a seat . As far as parking goes i would think you have a much better shot to park on the street in the Ditmars area than on 30th ave and broadway where it looks impossible . The amount of people heading twds those areas as well as the ones who live there make spots very far and few . Plus there are alot of buildings which means more people sardined in one block . You can rent a garage for abt 150-200 a month cuz you also have to consider alternate parking rules as well .&nbsp; &nbsp;As far as a pool , im guessing you mean an outdoor community pool and not a pool in a building ?&nbsp; Astoria park has the only pool around and thats at the Ditmars train stop , but you do have to walk abt 8-9 blocks after that .&nbsp; There is one gym that has an indoor pool as well . Astoria overall is safe but again i would say Ditmars is the safest of the areas with less riffraff .&nbsp; One bedrooms in good shape go abt 1200 and up .

				Since you are working near Penn Station, consider living off the R/M line because it&#039;s a very easy transfer to the E train at Queens Plaza, which stops right under Penn Station. Look at a map to see where the N/Q and the E stop at 34th Street to see what would be more convenient for you. <br /><br />I have lived off the 46th Street R/M stop (on 30th Ave east of Steinway) as well as near the Ditmars N/Q and I have not felt generally unsafe in either area. And I&#039;m speaking as a woman who&#039;s lived here throughout her 20s. As a 30 year-old male, I don&#039;t think you&#039;d have anything to worry about in any particular area that would qualify as Astoria. Crap does happen here, but in general Astoria is pretty safe. But you should definitely walk around the area before choosing an apartment, whether you use a broker or not, and try a walk to the subway from any prospective apartment, since you aren&#039;t at all familiar with the area. I agree that a 1BR in Astoria is usually $1200 or more. A newly renovated apartment with fancy kitchen appliances and a nice bathroom is more likely in the $1400+ range, however.<br /><br />The bar/music vibe in Astoria really depends on what you&#039;re looking for. Most areas of Astoria have at least one &quot;cool&quot; bar, with the highest concentration of them being on 30th Avenue. The live music scene in Astoria is not great, but some places do have small bands play and open mics.
