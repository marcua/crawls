Korea testing missiles that are, oh, capable of hitting the West Coast.&nbsp; Who is up in arms about that?&nbsp; No one.&nbsp; Why is that?&nbsp; Oh, because there is no oil and, holy s***, they have a HUGE military.&nbsp; Plus, it might also upset our &quot;buddies&quot; in Russia and China if we go banging around in their backyard.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and what about that fellow that started all of this?&nbsp; What was his name?&nbsp; Where might he be?&nbsp; Does most of America remember that he&#039;s the REASON we started all of this.&nbsp; I, for one, am a little pissed off we&#039;ve been in, what, 6 years of war now and we STILL haven&#039;t gotten the person responsible.&nbsp; <br /><br />We don&#039;t need to prove &quot;Shock and Awe.&quot;&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure the Iranian government, as well as the rest of the world, is smart enough to realize that ONE bomb here would bring about a serious drop in their tourism for the next couple thousand years.&nbsp; So, really, do we need to go rattling our saber over there and, in all likelihood, have the only outcome being that the hatred for us is fueled more?</div>

I also think it&#039;s unwise to think that a more isolationist foreign policy will somehow make the world love America again. It will actually make us more disliked, probably from the same quarters where we&#039;re regarded as a bully.<br /><br />But you know what? That&#039;s a risk I&#039;m willing to take. I&#039;d rather the US mind its own and piss off the world instead of getting into foreign entanglements with the same result.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_104738">But, again, he&#039;s not pushing for us to be isolationist.&nbsp; He wants to be MUCH more open with nations diplomatically and economically (through trade and information sharing, not gratuitous aid and/or harsh sanctions) and remove ourselves from so many of our obligations; military or aid-based.&nbsp; This would mean that we stop funneling billions of dollars into Israel AND their enemy Egypt, of which both use to build up military strength to guard against/attack the other.&nbsp; It would mean we&#039;d stop sending money to future Saddams and Osamas while they are now our friends, yet tomorrow our enemies, to overthrow governments we don&#039;t like.<br /><br />His interest in getting out of NATO and the UN is because we spend HUGE amounts of money on these two organizations, plus we are getting more and more under their controls.&nbsp; Their laws can have effects on our policy; which takes away our sovereignty.&nbsp; Plus, we become obligated to act at the will of these organizations, much like we have asked other countries to do for us.&nbsp; But, why do we need that?&nbsp; If we&#039;re not being aggressive militarily or politically, why do we need to have other nations following our moves?<br /><br />Now, obviously, if we needed to go to war, our reasons were legitimate, AND IT WAS VOTED ON AND PASSED BY THE CONGRESS, then we can ask for assistance.&nbsp; The whole reason Bush was able to get the Iraq War going was because of UN Resolution 1441 and &quot;Iraq&#039;s failure to comply,&quot; not the vote of Congress (and, in turn, the people).&nbsp; <br /><br />If the assistance we ask for isn&#039;t given; screw them.&nbsp; Paul wants a strong military and it will be even stronger under his presidency because we won&#039;t have our soldiers all over the world.&nbsp; Do we really need to have our troops stationed in Japan and Germany for their protection; spending millions (or billions) of our tax dollars?&nbsp; Why can&#039;t they be given the task of protecting themselves?&nbsp; Are they gonna spring up a batch of new Hitlers and Hirohitos?&nbsp; Is someone going to jump on invading them once we leave?&nbsp; Is the Red Army going to rise up again and go rolling across Western Europe?&nbsp; <br /><br />We have tons of troops in South Korea as a deterrent to the North, but is it really OUR job to protect them with our American lives and tax dollars?&nbsp; If you say yes, then do you also believe that we should be in any of the troubled countries in Africa too?&nbsp; Which ones deserve our help and who gets cut out?&nbsp; We tried Somalia, but the &quot;reward&quot; wasn&#039;t worth the risk and loss of American lives to the public then and Clinton was forced to pull us out of there.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />It is THESE types of situations that Paul wants to get us out of; not the ones that are beneficial to the US.&nbsp; If that&#039;s what everyone wants to consider isolationist; sign me up as an isolationist.&nbsp; I don&#039;t, by any means, think that we should just blatantly allow suffering around the world; but there has to be a line drawn.&nbsp; Our situation in the US direly needs attention.&nbsp; What we spend just on our military and gratuitous aid activities OUTSIDE of this country would help bring our budget down, lower taxes, increase take home pay to families and help set up programs (private giving, not government) that can combat hunger, homelessness, or provide cheaper health care.<br /><br />That&#039;s what Dr. Paul wants to get this country doing and that&#039;s why I support him.&nbsp; If fixing things here by doing less in other countries gets that done, so be it.&nbsp; If you&#039;re going to say it sounds selfish, consider something you want (environmental protection, cheaper and cleaner energy, better public transportation, lower taxes, cheaper college, etc.) and REALLY question whether you want to continue to send your money to another country, or whether you&#039;d rather see it go to one of those things.&nbsp; </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_104765"><br />Is it possible that WE do not live in that type of world due to our aggressive foreign policy?&nbsp; I mean, the Swiss, the Aussies, the Canadians, the Kiwis, the Swedes, the Belg...trails off...all seem to be able to be a part of this world, yet remain out of the affairs of the rest of the world.<br /><br />Yes, cause&nbsp; we&nbsp; provided&nbsp; for their defense, the &#039;kiwis&#039;, are they a world&nbsp; power? <br /><br />&quot;All our resources&quot; wasn&#039;t meant to be taken as literally &quot;all&quot; and was&nbsp; misstated on my part.<br /><br />Fine.<br />&nbsp; <br />While I agree with you that these atrocities are horrible and his way of thinking is fatally flawed, not allowing someone to voice their opinion in this country is a gross dereliction of the first amendment right to free speech.<br /><br />Fatally flawed? He&#039;s&nbsp; a monster&nbsp; who executes&nbsp; anyone&nbsp; who is non-Islamic and is spreading an ideology of evil across&nbsp; the planet. &nbsp; <br /><br />Now, I understand you could argue that, since he is not a citizen, he is not afforded a first amendment right, but he was in this country (whether the invite is wrong or not, is definitely debatable) and, IMHO, he is afforded that right, as vile as he may be.&nbsp; It would be pretty hypocritical to sensor someone whom we are upset with for sensorship of his own people.<br /><br />He does&nbsp; more&nbsp; than censor&nbsp; people in his country.He trains&nbsp; groups&nbsp; worldwide&nbsp; to blow people&nbsp; up in cafe&#039;s and public places&nbsp; to spread&nbsp; his&nbsp; form of Islam. Why is this&nbsp; man even alive?<br /><br />Where did you get that Dr. Paul or I are presenting them as victims to anything besides being a-holes?&nbsp; They might be a-holes TOWARD US due to our foreign policy, but that doesn&#039;t mean they won&#039;t be a-holes without it.&nbsp; We just might not receive the brunt of their anger.&nbsp; Besides, there are plenty of Islamic factions around the rest of the world that might treat their populace in atrocious ways, but we aren&#039;t so worried about them.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, our buddies the Saudis, as well as many others in the Middle East that we consider &quot;allies&quot; are just as bad in their treatment of women. <br /><br />The foreign policy of support of Israel and&nbsp; &#039;our&#039;&nbsp; religious&nbsp; heritage is non-negotiatble. I agree&nbsp; Saudi&nbsp; Arabia&nbsp; is&nbsp; a horror, but, Iran is the immediate danger and attacking Saudi , which has islams holiest&nbsp; site, would get the war with Islam I thought we wanted&nbsp; to avoid. Let&#039;s&nbsp; take care of&nbsp; this nut first.<br /><br />Actually, from what I understand, Iranian women have a little more freedom than women in those countries.&nbsp; Now, before you take that wrong, I&#039;m not saying that they are treated well, but their treatment isn&#039;t as harsh.<br /><br />This is incorrect. Iran has imposed&nbsp; strict&nbsp; Sharia&nbsp; law now, an dunder thjis guys, routinely executes women for&nbsp; such &#039;crimes&#039;&nbsp; as being with a man alone&nbsp; and certainly any nuse of alcohol&nbsp; or being gay wil earn you everything from a lashing to a&nbsp; hanging. Yes, Saudi&nbsp; is&nbsp; harsh too, let&#039;s&nbsp; not take on the entire Islamic&nbsp; world&nbsp; at once. If an example is&nbsp; made in Iraq, and Afghan that freedom is possible, we won&#039;t need to send our troops, Iranians&nbsp; and Saudis will see it is possible.<br /><br />I still don&#039;t understand why you think it&#039;s better to go after, at this point, merely a potential threat instead of an actual one.&nbsp; Especially when going after Iran unprovoked would, very likely, incite the Muslim world and rally and unite them against us.<br /><br />Iran has &#039;provoked&#039; us, who do you think is arming and paying the people&nbsp; attacking our trops in Iraq? You want to really incite all Muslims, and it&#039;s&nbsp; apparantly not difficult to do with these&nbsp; people&nbsp; in general, attack Saudi and Mecca&nbsp; and see what happens?<br /><br />So we close our doors to those that are trying to escape this tyrannical government, purely based on their religious views?&nbsp; That&#039;s similar to what we did to the Japanese-American citizens in WWII and it definitely didn&#039;t exemplify the American way.&nbsp; Except, this time, you&#039;re denying them the ability to leave oppression and only further enrage them toward our society.&nbsp; Hypocrisy isn&#039;t the way, in my book.&nbsp; We aren&#039;t going to be able to change the views of everyone the second largest religion in the world, nor do we have any right to.<br /><br />Well, then they have NO right to be in this country, cause&nbsp; their religion does&nbsp; not allow other&nbsp; beliefs&nbsp; in their nations. You don&#039;t let in the enemy during a&nbsp; war.<br /><br />Of course they didn&#039;t.&nbsp; But are you saying that we weren&#039;t meddling in their affairs before then?&nbsp; I think running through Kuwait 10 years earlier didn&#039;t really help things.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure our support of Iraq during the Iraq-Iran war didn&#039;t make us any friends in Iran.&nbsp; Or, how about supporting the Taliban in the Afghani war vs. the Russians?&nbsp; Hell, how about the fact Iraq was arbitrarily slapped together in 1920 by the League of Nations.&nbsp;<br /><br />We were in Kuwait, cause&nbsp; Saddam had invaded. We didn&#039;t support Iraq or Iran during their war, we gave them just enough to kill each other, unfortunately, they both&nbsp; survived&nbsp; intact and&nbsp; then turned&nbsp; on us. Plus, the Ayatoliet, which we can thank France&nbsp; for &#039;saving&#039;, started&nbsp; the islamic revolution to overthrow the Shah, who even Iraninans&nbsp; who ahted him admit now was a million times better&nbsp; than what happened. We did not support the taliban, the Taliban did not exist till the Soviets&nbsp; left. We supported factions of the Muhjahadden, like&nbsp; the Soviets&nbsp; and Chinese&nbsp; supported the Vietcong and screwed&nbsp; us twenty years&nbsp; earlier. These&nbsp; are not saints we are talking about, but, their&nbsp; are people&nbsp; there who want a better life. <br /><br />These are just a few of a million reasons that they might hate us because of our foreign policy and meddling in their affairs.&nbsp; Think maybe they dislike us for these reasons and not because I can drink beer at a baseball game while looking at an attractive woman in a pair of shorts that could be married?<br /><br />They do more than dislike you, they impose laws. I have&nbsp; a&nbsp; few million reasons to hate them, and their meddling and existence&nbsp; on this planet. I hate&nbsp; them and their religion, it is my right. They don&#039;t have that right and they want to impose it worldwide. They are not the &#039;victims.&#039;<br /><br />Look, I&#039;m not saying we need to hug and be friends with everyone and neither is Dr. Paul.&nbsp; I (and, from what I gather from hearing him talk, he) is just of the belief that we don&#039;t need to be so aggressive in instituting our own foreign policy in other countries.&nbsp; I believe more along the lines of Teddy Roosevelt, &quot;walk softly and carry a big stick.&quot;&nbsp; We won&#039;t meddle; but you&#039;ll rue the day you instigate us.<br /><br />Well, they haven&#039;t rued the day. After 9/11, we should have laid waste&nbsp; on such a scale that&nbsp; their would be tens of millions dead, they would have done&nbsp; it to us in a second&nbsp; given half a chance. This is&nbsp; a&nbsp; planet of&nbsp; barabarians, with few exceptions, if we don&#039;t fight to preserve&nbsp; the exception we deserve&nbsp; to disappear.</div>

And I don&#039;t see how the statement above is ANY different than Hitler using the Jews as an excuse for world problems back in the 20&#039;s and 30&#039;s.&nbsp; Lumping tens of millions of people who just want to live their lives with a few thousand whack jobs.&nbsp; You&#039;re no better than the very thing you claim to hate.&nbsp; So put your money where your mouth is and go fight them yourself.&nbsp; And I don&#039;t give a s___ how old you might be and what you&#039;ve done in the past.&nbsp; When you wish death upon tens of millions of innocent people, you lose all moral credibility.<br /><br />You, sir, are a bigot.<br /><br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Why don&#039;t you become&nbsp; a&nbsp; Human shield? What a juvenille&nbsp; answer. At least I hate&nbsp; the people&nbsp; trying to kill you and me, what&#039;s&nbsp; your excuse&nbsp; for&nbsp; hugging them while hating people like me? What garbage&nbsp; bringing up&nbsp; Jews in this context, how do you know I&#039;m not a&nbsp; Jew? I could even be a &#039;Neo-Con&#039;, you know the code&nbsp; word used to attack &#039;conservative Jews&#039; by those&nbsp; who want&nbsp; Peace and Freedom for&nbsp; Al Qeada , but, want the state of Israel&nbsp; to give up land the size&nbsp; of Rhode&nbsp; Island so theircan be &#039;peace&#039; with Muslims who occupy lands two and half times the Size of the former&nbsp; Soviet Union from N&#039;Africa&nbsp; to Asia. <br /><br />Who are you to give&nbsp; anyone &#039;moral credibility&#039;, check&nbsp; that ego at the door. I never said&nbsp; I wanted&nbsp; tens of millions&nbsp; dead, I said that&#039;s what the enemy would do, and we have done&nbsp; far less, yet, poeple&nbsp; like you bleed&nbsp; and moan and supprt them. It&#039;s&nbsp; not a few thousand, it&#039;s tens of millions&nbsp; and they would turn your house into a&nbsp; graveyard in a second, dress the women like mummies, shut down any of the freak&#039;n cafe&#039;s that serve alcohol, execute Gays, Lesbians and Adulters. Yet, I&#039;m &#039;Hitler&#039;&nbsp; and&nbsp; a&nbsp; &#039;Bigot&#039; for point that out. Shalom :-)</div>
