				Anybody been shopping here lately? How are the prices compared to the local supermarkets? A 6 pack of Sam Adams Boston Lager by Trade Fair is about $10 and change now up from 9 and change.&nbsp;

				Shopped there only one time in the summer. Wasn&#039;t too impressed. The prices were OK, some prices lower, some the same as supermarket. Selection was a bit better than supermarket. Be careful to check expiration date on craft beers-including Sam Adams, and make sure there are no &quot;floaties&quot; in bottles. <br /><br /><br />If you can get there:<br />http://www.triborobeverage.com/ (http://www.triborobeverage.com/)<br /><br /><br />That&#039;s where we&#039;ve been purchasing our beers. They have a great selection in their new retail store. This is what we&#039;ve been buying from them every week:<br />Sierra Nevada Celebration-8.99 6 pack<br />Brooklyn Brewery Chocolate Stout-8.99 4 pack<br />These are usually 10.99-11.99 in supermarkets<br /><br /><br />I&#039;d bet the Sam Adams prices are lower. <br /><br /><br />

				I think the most impressive beer selection in astoria, and maybe all of queens, is at Euro Market on 31st street, between, 30th and 31st ave.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Forgot about Euro Market! Yeah, they do have an impressive selection, but how are their prices these days? I haven&#039;t shopped there for almost 2 years.

				they have occasional specials, but beer prices have gone up across the board everywhere.<br />I think the price of hops or barley have skyrocketed.<br /><br />they also have a lot of good beer in cans, which can be a little cheaper, and are good for festivals where no glass bottles are allowed.<br /><br />oh and Best Yet has a really good selection and probably the best prices, but it&#039;s a little out of the way for me.<br /><br />

				+1 to Euromarket.&nbsp; Their beer selection is fantastic, and I think their prices are pretty fair.&nbsp; My only complaint is that, on occasion, they leave a six-pack on the shelves past its sell-by date.&nbsp; But simply being diligent about checking the dates on the bottles before you buy them remedies this.<br /><br />It&#039;s also hard to leave Euromarket without a 1/2 pound of double-smoked bacon...

				Tri-boro Beverage on Astoria Blvd (South) and 42nd St. has seriously stepped their game up. I walked by yesterday and noticed a completely revamped beer room, which they said happened at the end of the summer. The selection is much improved and different than Euro Market; Euro Market of course is heavy on the imports, while most of Triboro&#039;s selection was domestic beers. The prices were reasonable to slightly on the cheap side (I find Euro Market to be on the slightly pricey side). <br /><br />Examples for any beer geeks out there: 750mL Rodenbach Grand Cru for 8.99, 6-packs of Left Hand Milk Stout for 10.99.
