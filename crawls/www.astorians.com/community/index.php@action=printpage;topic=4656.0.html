				I need models, male/female, don&#39;t care about age.&nbsp; Just post a &quot;natural&quot; looking picture of yourself, or a snapshot.&nbsp; I&#39;m looking to shoot two weeks from now on a Thursday and Friday afternoon around Astoria Park.&nbsp; I can&#39;t pay you guys anything, but I know how to put makeup on people (yes, I&#39;m a quasi-makeup artist) and how to make coco rice crispies (which you will eat for free!!).<br /><br />Just a snapshot, no makeup, hopefully in some natural light.<br /><br />Thank you, and help me get back into art school!

As in you take pictures of Pastries? OR you Make Pastries? Either way, you should check out Strobist.blogspot.com . There is a section there about lighting macro food photography.

				I make pastries, but rely on other people to take photos of them as I am not a photographer. One of my lovely friends has offered to photograph my work, and now that I&#39;m nearly done with school and starting to improve at dessert manufacturing, I figured a good portfolio would be prudent.&nbsp; And I decided to stick a picture of myself in there just for added .... something.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know, but it seems like a good idea.&nbsp; That is, if I do not end up breaking uzumaki&#39;s camera.&nbsp; We&#39;ll see.&nbsp; She&#39;s a brave soul to photograph this mug.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for the lighting website idea.&nbsp;

This is an awesome pic and I doubt the others are &quot;hideous&quot; - you silly girl!&nbsp; :-) I think all of my Astoria friends are attractive. I want a group pic of y&#39;all! But not one of everyone eating at a 25-foot long table.... Maybe in the summer we can arrange a group photo at Astoria Park or somethin&#39;.
