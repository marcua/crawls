				To anyone who is interested:<br /><br />My name is Tamara and I'm a Journalism student at Columbia who is covering anything big and small going on in Astoria for the rest of the year. <br /><br />I'm hoping some people can help me out on my current article:<br /><br />I'm intrigued by the fact that Astoria only has one bookstore and I know there have been some mixed reviews about it. I'm looking for anyone who is willing to talk about their likes and dislikes of the bookstore, and more importantly if a local bookstore like Seaburn is sufficient for what you're looking for bookwise. I'm aware of the petition that people have been signing requesting the store to alphabetize their titles and make everything more organized for its patrons.<br /><br />Anyone who has a few minutes to chat about this issue and share your thoughts on Seaburn, please e-mail me at: tjs2113@columbia.edu and let me know how I can reach you. <br /><br />I have a deadline for Thursday, so if you can spare some time in the next couple of days (either on the phone, in Astoria, or over e-mail) that would be much appreciated. I'm flexible, so let me know.<br /><br />Look forward to hearing from as many of you as possible!<br /><br />Thanks &nbsp;:D <br />Tamara

				The only way I can more succinctly put it besides what I posted on the petition is that Seaburn left me feeling icky, like I was in some sort of cult bookstore. At first it was the lack of organization which, while not a huge problem, gave me no compelling reason to return to the store, whether to browse or look for something specific.<br /><br />What did it for me was the basement where there were stacks and stacks of Black Power/Black Nationalism/Black Racism/who knows what books. These were the only thing organized about the place (besides the Greek-language shelf next to the front door on the main floor). And I got the feeling that there was some sort of political agenda at work here behind the business, and I like my bookstores neutral and non-partisan, thank you, not agit-prop centers.<br /><br />My girlfriend as about as liberal as they come and even she was turned off by it. Me, I'm your average bourgeois libertarian, and proud of it, so you can see why I wouldn't want to do business with Seaburn.<br /><br />I know the previous store was left-leaning, and that didn't really bother me. However with Seaburn, after having seen the stuff in the basement, I (being white) had the distinct feeling that I was on some sort of hostile territory...

				Hi Teej - <br /><br />As you know, I created the petition. I did it because I like to read. So does my husband. We would like nothing more than to stroll down the street and pick up some good books. Apparantly, they do have a notable selection of Greek books, and I think they even publish them. <br /><br />To me tho, the selection is really pretty vanilla. Nothing particularly good, or even unusual. Even if there is, I wouldn't know it 'cause I can't find anything. Because they don't alphabetize. It's very frustrating as many on this board, and others, have complained. It's typical really. The folks moving in now are *typically* more liberal and/or educated than the Astorian residents of 10 years ago. It's part of gentrification, for better or worse. <br /><br />And now they sell guitars apparantly? I don't get it.

				I have no personal experience with Seaburn Books, having never stepped inside the shop. &nbsp;My friend Google gave me some information, though.<br /><br />This article (http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/books/story/336753p-287672c.html) from the Daily News discusses &quot;Stores for ethnic &amp; foreign-language books.&quot; &nbsp;Seaburn is the third one profiled. &nbsp;Seaburn's owner is originally from Nigeria and studied dentistry in Greece.<br /><br />Seaburn's own website (http://www.seaburn.com/) lists several ethnic affiliations.<br /><br />I certainly can't comment on the store's organisation, or lack thereof - or their stock of books generally, but it seems that the books that turned Daveed off are part of the publishing side of their business.<br /><br />On their website they claim to have over 150,000 books in stock. &nbsp;iLoveCheese, aside from your petition, have you had any contact with them or discussions with them about their stock or organisation?

				I have to say that after 11yrs in Astoria, ive givin up on &nbsp;printed material around here. &nbsp;<br /><br />Hate to say it but a barnes and noble would be greatly apreciated and it would even have a cafe that did not offer smoking or loud euro house music.

				Well, there's a reason B&amp;N, Borders, etc. are so popular, even in urban areas. Convenience, selection, prices (sometimes), amenities, to name a few. I wonder if any major book retailer has looked into this neighborhood already and decided it wasn't feasible for some reason... <br /><br />Hey, they could always do all of us a favor and buy out Cup and the space above! ;)

I personally could do without another Gap or whatever like you find on Steinway. Or Applebee's and other microwave fare. Then again, there are tons of alternatives to those places.<br /><br />For books, there's nothing else around here. And I actually like stores like B&amp;N and Borders. Sure a local bookseller is preferable, esp for used, imported and outofprint stuff like the pre-Seaburn's store had. But given the dearth now, I'd welcome a big chain.<br /><br />And there's always amazon, where I buy most of my new stuff -- books and DVDs -- b/c it's consistenly cheaper than regular retail stores, not including the sales tax.

				I went to the old book store when I first moved here, and was psyched there was even a bookstore here at all...I assumed there would be a B&amp;N or another one....but no...the old store folks were cool and ordered me what I could not find in the store...and it was organized...the new store is not all that different, but less organized it seems...I go in occasionally, but it has lost it's feel....and the space is small, so you can't really hang...just browse and buy or leave...<br />I'm sure that a huge bookstore will come to Astoria, near Broadway and Steinway...just a matter of time...I used to come here over ten years ago, some of the bars are still there, but stores change...I think the new people who are used to giant bookstores will flock to a B&amp;N, Borders, etc....

				I almost always purchase my books from Half.com (although shipping usually jacks the price up considerably) or Alibris.com. I also am close to a Borders where I work in Manhattan, so I have purchased there as well.<br /><br />It would be nice to have a small used bookstore near Ditmars. There are a lot of open business spaces around here and so you'd think that eventually someone would move in. Unfortunately, though, it is tough for a bookstore to start - esp. a small one. Most definitely you'd need some sort of financial backing other than just a bank. I have also heard that a lot of small used bookstores often survive not because of their local sales but online sales. Starting a business and surviving is a tough thing to do, esp. when your customer base is limited (not everyone likes to read, people even a couple of blocks away don't even know you exist, etc.).

				Last week I walked into Seaburn Books just to see how disorganized they were. I talked to the owner who was very nice. I walked downstairs (after I was pleasantly surprised there was a downstairs) and saw the solitary employee shelving books.<br /><br />I remembered when I was younger bicycling into town to go to all three bookstores in the area. One sold &quot;new&quot; books (some of which had been on the shelves since the sixties) &amp; remembered how one of the proprieters was an old time Beatnick and political activist now grown weary and bitter with age; the other two sold used books... and these were arriving by the day. This was before Border's moved in. I remember just looking at every title every time I went. I remember asking the chain-smoking woman there to hold on to a particular title if it happened to come in. They usually did.. or she went out of her way to inquire. She was a retired English professor grown tired and cynical with age.<br /><br />Then I think about how the proprieter of Seaburn books assured me that she could order anything that I could possibly want. She smiled a genuine smile. When I asked her what her stock was quoted as on the NAS she gave me a puzzled look. I thought about how much more expedient Amazon.com would be. Or, if there was a Border's or a Barnes &amp; Nobles how they would probably already have whatever I wanted already in stock; no need to wait. I thought about how Starbuck's coffee is perhaps more convenient and expedient than the Peach. The staff there usually have better things to do than talk, although they are also friendly and perhaps genuinely so. I thought about how the manager assured me how he wanted to hang a sign in the window for AHR but never did. Probably afraid of corporate policy, I guess. Who can blame him?<br /><br />I wonder what it's like to be a food critic. Going from place to place, determing whether a business or reputation should live or die. I'd never actually have to open my own restaurant, cook dinner myself for my 100 or so guests (if the tempermental chef suddenly decided to take off or quit) what some old school establishments still consider what are now labeled <em>customers</em> or 'targeted markets') or put up with the day-to-day drudgery of trying to please everybody, feeling bad about the few times that I was actually irritable and lashed out with a sarcastic or rude remark to people who have been patronizing me and who I served consistently with a smile for years.<br />Just as long as other people trusted me and my tastes, my livlihood would be secured. Just as long as they served turkey on white bread, I would be lenient. Such power is amazing.

				just to follow up on my earlier post, i would not recommend selling books to seaburn -- i brought in three boxes last week, hardcovers and trade paperbacks, all in fair to excellent condition, and the woman behind the counter wanted to offer me $10. for all three boxes. um, no thanks.

				Since we're moving, anything that wasn't worth selling on amazon (or keeping, of course), I've been taking to the Strand in batches on the way home from work. But if it's not written in much and not totally beat up, they'll usually take it. Some best sellers seem to be exceptions, tho, due to oversupply. It's a pain, but I think I've probably made $100 that way all told.<br /><br />PS. Love your avitar! I miss that little guy!

				Seaburn&#39;s actually improved its organization considerably, at least on the first floor. I, for one, appreciate the randomness of a haphazardly organized bookstore -- it&#39;s how I found many a poetry book -- but Seaburn felt incoherent versus serendipitous. <br /><br />It seems like not that long ago everyone complained about the Borders and B&amp;Ns of the world for draining the soul out of book-buying by homogenizing the experience and squashing the local stores that had some distinctive character. <br /><br />I have no reason to complain about the &quot;black power&quot; books, but I am bewildered by the sheer quantity of some of the titles. <em>Hundreds</em> of copies of the same title, and over time it would not appear that they&#39;ve sold near enough to justify the shelf space. Another source of WTF is in the computer books section. Thousand-page books about Windows 3.1, Netscape 2.0, Photoshop 3.0 -- obviously outdated and unlikely to sail off the shelves, but hogging tremendous amounts of space. Tech books get outdated quickly but these were ridiculous -- haven&#39;t looked lately though so maybe they straightened that out too.<br /><br />Whatever. I like the place and always have. Seaburn issues lovely, articulately printed receipts.<br />

				Seaburn is a nice enough store, but not well organized at all, and a poor selection.&nbsp; They can order books for you, but it can take up to two months, sometimes more.&nbsp; I can order books faster from Amazon!&nbsp; We need a real bookstore in Astoria, or at least a better stocked one.&nbsp; All the big vacant spaces over on Steinway should seem appealing enough to one of the major bookstore chains, but no one seems to be moving in, which is lamentable.

				I agree a nice bookstore would be greatly appreicated. Enough 99 cent stores and crappy clothing stores! Years ago there was a book store on Steinway near 30th ave- but I didn&#39;t last long at all. I think the owners of Book Value (the owners before Seaburn) owned it.

				There was a bookstore on Steinway for a while, though I think it was a religious bookstore if memory serves me correctly - though the one I remember was south of Broadway though north of 34th Avenue.&nbsp; We only seem to get 99 cent stores, banks and greek restaurants on Broadway.&nbsp; I want decent Chinese and a decent bookstore.&nbsp; New restaurants are always a nice thing too.
