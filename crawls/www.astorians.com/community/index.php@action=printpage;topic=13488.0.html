				Last night I couldn&#039;t get in to Kebab Cafe and my friends and I were wondering around with wine wondering where else to go.<br />We ended up at Jour et Nuit which is <em>not </em>BYOB and was a debacle in many aspects worthy of another topic.<br />But I can&#039;t think of any places in Astoria that are legit BYOB - are there any?

				If you know about Kebab Cafe...you should definitely know about Mombar! Tsk Tsk...I think all Astorians should know this ^_^&quot;<br /><br />Next time you know... it&#039;s only a few store down down from Kebab Cafe towards 28th ave. <br />

				Leng Thai was.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if that was a temporary thing until they got their license.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t been in a while.<br /><br />Seva is definitely BYOB.

Anyone know what they charge? It might cut down on the alcohol portion of the check :)

				I don&#039;t remember what 718 charged. My boyfriend and I just thought that their wine was a pretty mediocre selection and it seemed a shame to not have better wine with the food. I think it was 7 or 8 bucks, but it was well worth it for us for that special occasion.<br /><br />Also, I recommend bringing your own corkscrew anytime you&#039;re going to BYOB. Some restaurants without licenses teach their staff how to open bottles, but most don&#039;t, and there&#039;s nothing worse than having an evening spoiled by a waitress corking an expensive bottle.
