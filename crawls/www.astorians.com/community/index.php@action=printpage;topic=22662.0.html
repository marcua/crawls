				Hi My awesome roommate is leaving for 4 months, so I have a room available for sublet starting from around June 15th-20th. If you decide that you would like to stay in the apartment longer than 4 months my current roommate said she would make other accommodation arrangements for herself until the room is available again. <br />&nbsp;About the room:<br />&nbsp;*The room is huge, it has wonderful natural sunlight and the apartment itself is about a 5 minute walk to the subway. <br />&nbsp;*The apartment is close to everything, grocery stores, laundromats, post offices, bike repair shops, you name it it&#039;s within a short walking distance of the apartment. <br />&nbsp;*The room is already furnished with a single bed, dresser, etc. So if you&#039;re moving to Astoria and you don&#039;t have any furniture, it&#039;s not a problem. <br />&nbsp;*The rent is $850 a month, not including utilities. <br />&nbsp;*Utilities usually run from $50-$60 a month. (My roommate has cable in her room which runs for about $100 or so extra, but if you don&#039;t want cable, then I&#039;ll cancel it while you&#039;re staying in the apartment.) <br />&nbsp;*It&#039;s a 2 bedroom apartment, so you have your own space, the room is pretty big, my current roommate turned half of the room into a personal office.<br />&nbsp;*Gas and water are included in the rent<br /><br />Sorry but...<br />*No pets<br />*No couples<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;About Me:<br />&nbsp;*I&#039;ll be your only roommate I&#039;m very laid back, quiet, and clean. <br />&nbsp;*I&#039;m a 28 year old female, and I would prefer if my roommate is female also. <br />&nbsp;*I work and go to school for physical therapy, so I&#039;m not usually home. <br />&nbsp;*Even though I&#039;m not home often, I am sociable when I am home. My past roommates and I usually sit down and have a glass of wine, or dinner together when we both have the time.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;If you are interested in seeing pictures of the apartment, or stopping by to see the apartment, please send me an email. Thanks! :)

While I go through applications this summer/early fall, I will be working full-time in the non-profit world as a policy/admin associate.&nbsp; I am financially reliable with a spotless track record of paying rent/utilities on time. (I can provide landlord and roommate references, if needed.). I tend to follow the motto: we&#039;re adults, we should be able to clean up after ourselves and divvy up basic household chores without it being a big deal. I&#039;m busy during the day and try to go out and enjoy my weekends, but I&#039;m not the &#039;bring the party home&#039; type. (Home should be your palace, right?) In general, I&#039;m pretty easy going and I can get along with anyone, so long as they are respectful and willing to communicate with me about any problems or concerns. I&#039;m looking for roommates that I can get along with and occasionally split a bottle of wine with while chatting/watching a movie. I&#039;m also heavily involved in the feminist community &amp; its events. If that&#039;s a concern, I probably won&#039;t make a good fit. Otherwise, your place sounds like exactly what I&#039;m looking for and I&#039;d love to set up an appointment! <br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks and hope to hear from you soon!</span></span>

				Hey- Sorry it took me so long to respond, I was busy this weekend, but I sent a private message with my email address to those that responded to the posting- it&#039;ll proabably be easier to get in touch with me that way.

				Hi - I&#039;m a single fella so probably not the type you have in mind. I&#039;m looking for a place too, what kind exactly depends on the price and the place; prob want a one or two-bed just for me but would consider sharing with the right person. My daughter comes at the weekend sometimes so that would need to be okay. Anyway if you have any ideas let me know please
