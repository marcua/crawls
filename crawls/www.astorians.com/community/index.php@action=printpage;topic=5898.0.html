				Cabby, Follow That Horse!<br />From Associated Press<br />April 09, 2007 9:02 AM EDT <br /><br />INDIANAPOLIS - A runaway horse pulled a carriage with two out-of-town tourists on a wild ride through downtown streets, until a teenager rode to the rescue in a pursuing taxi, leaped out and grabbed the horse&#039;s reins.<br /><br />The driver of the Yellow Rose Carriage was thrown from her seat when a van crashed into the buggy Sunday afternoon.<br /><br />&quot;The carriage driver lady just flew off the carriage,&quot; said William Basler, 19.<br /><br />Basler ran after the carriage to try to stop it. A taxi driver saw what was happening, slowed and told Basler to jump in. The cab chased and passed the carriage, and Basler jumped out, grabbed the reins and stopped the horse.<br /><br />&quot;It was just instinct,&quot; Basler said. &quot;I was just worried about the people inside of it.&quot;<br /><br />He needed instinct, since he said his only experience with horses was riding one once when he was 15.<br /><br />Police said carriage driver Kathleen Moriarty, 53, was briefly knocked unconscious but was not seriously hurt.<br /><br />The passengers complained of some pain and were examined at a hospital, said police Sgt. Matthew Mount. The horse was not injured.<br /><br />Police said the van driver, Timothy D. Carlson, 46, of Indianapolis, faces several preliminary charges including felony possession of a controlled substance, misdemeanor counts of driving under the influence, public intoxication and operating a vehicle without a license.<br /><br />
