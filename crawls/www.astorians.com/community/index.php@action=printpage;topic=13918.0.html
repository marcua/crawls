				hi all, this is a post for my amazing mom (her name is also audrey!), she&#039;s a babysitter with 22 years experience. see below -- thanks!<br /><br />EXPERIENCED BABYSITTER AVAILABLE IN ASTORIA/LIC <br />(based in Astoria/LIC but can watch children from surrounding areas too, including Roosevelt Island! my house is very close to the Roosevelt Island Bridge) <br /><br />I am a 47-year-old English-speaking woman living in Astoria/LIC, near the Isamu Noguchi Garden Museum, Rainey Park, and the Socrates Sculpture Park. I am a mom of a 23-year-old, a 20-year-old, and an 11-year-old. I have helped to raise many children over the years, and when one of the children I had babysat grew up, she actually brought me her own daughter to care for. I have cared for children ages 6 weeks and up. I believe my many references will speak for themselves -- please contact me if you are interested so that I can pass along their info and you can speak to them directly. <br /><br />I babysit in my home -- I have a backyard with a swingset, and in the warmer months we have a sprinkler and a wading pool. <br /><br />I have a 3 1/2-year-old I&#039;m watching now, who will be going to school in September. I also have a 2-year-old girl who I watch from 7am to 12:30pm. <br /><br />I am available Monday to Friday, 6:30am to 7pm, but the hours are flexible, and I can babysit after school, too. <br /><br />I have reasonable rates -- I can work with you. <br /><br />Please call me at (347)840-2711 or email me at ajdimola@yahoo.com for additional info and feel free to ask any questions. I will get back to you immediately. <br /><br />Thanks so much! <br /><br />Take care, <br /><br />Audrey
