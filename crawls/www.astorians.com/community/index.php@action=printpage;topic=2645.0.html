				It&#39;s almost 9:30 on Friday, and I am about to leave for work.&nbsp; Of course, it is this moment when the skies open up and an incredible thunderstorm begins.&nbsp; This rain is incredible.&nbsp; Man, if I didn&#39;t have to go out into it and could stay home, I would probably go out into it and enjoy it!<br /><br />Oh boy...here I go...

				I work in midtown and the sky is black and our 25-story building is shaking with the thunder. Look out Astorians, here it comes. I always manage to get it when I leave my office building AND when I get back home. <br /><br />Sigh.<br /><br />

				My basement flooded again. This is the second time in 2 months. But before that it hasn&#39;t flooded in 6 to 7 years. Normally it would have to rain more than 2 inches an hour to cause flooding. I just got through replacing the old area rugs, and now I have to dump out the new ones too. I was at work so I din&#39;t get to see the rain much. How much could it have possibly rained to cause such flooding again? My neighbors were flloded too, so I don&#39;t know if it was too much rain, or whether the sewers on my street are clogged up again.
