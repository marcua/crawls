				I am looking for a place in Astoria to throw a birthday party for my daughter.&nbsp; I looked at the Birthday Zone on 21st Avenue and I think it was too small for 16 kids.&nbsp; My hubby suggested renting a center maybe at a church or something&nbsp; where we can decorate it and bring our own food.&nbsp; Any ideas or suggestions?<br /><br />Thanks in advance.

				For our daughters 1st bday, we did a picnic at the park. The second B-day we did MyGym in Fresh Meadows.&nbsp; It&#039;s tough, esp now when all her buddies are so small. <br /><br />How about a party at home?<br />

				Astoria Sports Complex (1 block north of Kaufman Astoria 6 movie theater) has a gigantic party room that comes with blow up slide and choice of sports for kids...they have a website with pics of the room and rate chart. Very reasonable.&nbsp; I&#039;m having my daughter&#039;s party there next month. Also, the China King Buffet (think it&#039;s called Home Select Buffet now) has two nice party rooms that are free.....with purchase of food. I had my kid&#039;s party there last year and it was fine and not very expensive.&nbsp; The larger room has a stage, music capabilities and holds about 100 people. The smaller room holds about 35. The restaurant is located in LaGuardia Shopping Center (43rd and Ditmars). Hope this helps.

				I don&#039;t know if they still do this, but, when I was younger my family had a TON of functions at the Taminent Democratic Club on 23rd Avenue between 33rd and 35th Streets across from Sal, Kris and Charlies Deli.<br /><br />They just recently painted the outside.&nbsp; I do not know how great it looks inside but back then (80&#039;s) it looked OK enough to hold parties in.<br /><br />You have it catered.&nbsp; You can have a DJ.&nbsp; I remember there being a bar-type like area (a small counter in it&#039;s own area) for Drinks and what not.&nbsp; <br /><br />I cannot find the address or phone number.&nbsp; :(<br /><br />

				Thanks to all for your reply.<br /><br />Here is my problem...my daughter&#039;s birthday is at the end of November early December so the party has to be indoors.&nbsp; Also the majority of the kids are under 3 years old.&nbsp;

				I had my son&#039;s birthday party (when he turned 5) at the Astoria Sports Complex.&nbsp; It was nice but expensive.&nbsp; I had about 15 kids and we had swimming and the super slide.&nbsp; (you can choose 2 activities like soccer, basketball, swimming)&nbsp; If I remember correctly it was like $20 a kid plus the pizza &amp; drinks for the adults plus tax plus they also charged gratuity. One of the nice things they do is take pictures for you of the kids having fun and then put it on a cd for you.&nbsp; (you wind up paying for it but it is nice) It was more than I expected.&nbsp; <br />They next year I had has party at the bowling ally (Maric lanes).&nbsp; That was fun!!&nbsp; The kids had a blast.&nbsp; They put up the bumpers for the kids.&nbsp; They also have a room upstairs - depending how many people you are having.&nbsp; <br />Good luck in finding a place.

				I rec. My Gym or orly&#039;s tree house out on Long Island. My gym is awesome becasue they pace the party so well. And they do all the clean up and there is plenty of parking. The floors are carpeted too so crawlers and walkers can all play together!<br />

				There is a party room (or three??) <strong>inside</strong> at the Beer Garden and it isn&#039;t just a bar...it is a community center. I&#039;ve seen many a family having a celebration/function in one of the rooms [they are off to the side of the bar in the adjacent building where the extra (upstairs) bathrooms are located.].<br />They cater with Czech food. <br /><br />You also might want to check to see if one of the bigger restaurants has a party room. Taverna Kyclades might have one.<br /><br />

				I would ask one of the local churches, or something like a St. Rocco&#039;s or the Beer Garden, community centers.&nbsp; They are around Astoria, there are definitely places, but you may need an in or be a member or something.

				About the beer garden..They do have a party room downstairs.. It&#039;s pretty nice.. The only caveat is that you have to use their catering. The space is great though.

				there&#039;s also chuck e cheese. but that would be scewered towards children older than 1-3.<br /><br />good luck finding an appropriate place!<br />when my twin cousins turned 1 they had their party at pelham bay park. perhaps you could do the same at astoria park? a big picnic, some age appropriate games and what not.<br />i usually think of 1st birthday parties as being more for the parents to have a little bit of fun&nbsp; :-D
