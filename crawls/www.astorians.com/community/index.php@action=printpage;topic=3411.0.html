				I was wondering if there are any other fans of the TV show The Office (both US and UK version)? I am a huge fan of the US version- I have only seen a few of the UK episodes.They are pretty funny too. I just think it is such a hilarious show.

				Oh I love Steve Carrell too! I have a huge crush on him. He is amazing on the show. He was also really good in &quot;Little Miss Sunshine&quot;. I can&#39;t wait until the new season of the Office begins next week. I heard some where that the staff from the UK show will be on some of the US episodes. That could be really interesting!

				My wife and I both want to go see &quot;Little Miss Sunshine&quot; (I&#39;ve heard it was pretty good).<br /><br />I have only seen about half of the first season of &quot;The Office&quot; - but only because I had to download each episode (go bittorrent!) because I couldn&#39;t get any of the major networks where I used to live (yes, I lived in the sticks).<br /><br />

				They should seriously do an episode in the same vein as the Bizarro Seinfeld episode, where there are doubles of everyone. I love how the US version mirrored the UK version so well... but then built on that to become its own show. <br /><br />And I TOO can&#39;t wait to see the premiere.

She has a MySpace page and a blog (as does half the cast for that matter) and posts stuff up there while she&#39;s taping - as all the computers on their desks have working internet. Her blog entries are really cute and funny and well written.

				LOVE The Office - both versions.&nbsp; They&#39;re really quite different.&nbsp; I absolutely love Ricky Gervais and Martin Freeman.&nbsp; Steve Carrell is great, too (ditto about <em>Little Miss Sunshine</em>. That movie was terrific).&nbsp; I&#39;m excited about the Jim-Pam thing, too.&nbsp; Roy is a jerk.&nbsp; Pam deserves better.&nbsp; The British one is my favorite, though.&nbsp; As creepily awesome as Dwight is, Gareth Keenan is hilariously obnoxious.&nbsp; Jolly good show, that.&nbsp; The first episode of the UK version is my favorite one, with the stapler in the jelly.&nbsp; &quot;You&#39;ll have to take him into custardy.&quot;&nbsp; It doesn&#39;t get any better.

She totally reminds me of a weirdo that used to work in my office.<br /><br />Speaking of offices- another favorite of mine is the movie &quot;Office Space&quot;. Any fellow &quot;Office Space&quot; fans? That movie kills me. I guess I can relate to both the movie and TV show- because there are so many weird , quirky people that I work with.&nbsp; &nbsp;:lol:

				I&#39;m a big fan of the original, and grew to love the U.S. version. They&#39;ve managed to make it into their own show. I even bought the special box with the first two seasons on DVD and random crap like a pen and magnet, because I&#39;m lame.

				I&#39;ve only seen handfuls of episodes of each version.&nbsp; While I&#39;m more interested in watching the whole UK series than the whole US one, I have grown to like the US version.&nbsp; I heard Ricky Gervais is writing an episode for next season and he commented that it&#39;s like writing for a whole different show--he&#39;s not trying to make the characters more like their UK counterparts or anything like that.

				One of my favorite episodes is when Steve Carell comes to NYC.. He&#39;s the typical tourist &quot; When I come to New York I always have to stop at my favorite Pizza place.. &quot; then the camera pans to a Sbarros.. tooo funny, and waay too true.

				My goodness! It is quite a funny show! We know one of the writers/actors in the show (Mindy Kaling) who plays the Indian woman who is obsessed with the intern BJ Novak, the intern.<br /><br />She also played Matt in &quot;Matt and Ben&quot;, if anyone is familiar with it.<br /><br />Looking forward to the season-starter.

				Yes, I have grown to LOVE the Office! We were eager to see it from the beginning, since my friend from college, Mindy (noted above by Lost Moon), is a writer. But oddly enough, I really did not like the first episode when I first saw it. I found Steve Carell&#39;s character to be TOO obnoxious and I didn&#39;t find it that funny.<br /><br />However, it&#39;s totally grown on me and now I love it, and it&#39;s been so neat to see Mindy&#39;s character get more and more play! PLUS, we saw a picture of her on stage at the Emmy&#39;s accepting an award. She did NOT dress like that (with such bling bling) in college, I can tell you.<br /><br />Also, just to correct Lost Moon - she played Ben, in the play Matt and Ben (written by her and another friend from college).<br /><br />Can&#39;t wait to see the season premiere this week!!

				Last week&#39;s episode was hilarious! I think Steve Carell is pure genius. I feel like I empathize more with him than I did with David Brent/Ricky Gervais. That&#39;s not saying one is better than the other, it&#39;s just a slightly different way of interpreting that character.<br /><br />I love comedy shows where I <em>actually</em> laugh out loud. Doesn&#39;t happen a lot. The Daily Show and the Office are doing it to me these days though.

				Ok so I was disappointed in last nights episode. I just didn&#39;t think it was that funny. I think I enjoyed the season premiere so far the best this year. My favorite episode still to date is when Michael burnt his foot on the George Forman grill- just thinking about that episode makes me start laughing!<br /><br />What is your favorite Office episode ever?
