				i think it would be better to focus on old school Astoria institutions like Agnanti, Elias&#039; Corner, La Guli, and even Sandwich King on 23ave, and stressed how they&#039;ve been feeding generations of Astorians, than on overnight pop-ups that are a little more &quot;transplant&quot;-ey New Astoria, but they definately deserve mention.&nbsp;

				Rizzo&#039;s is my favorite pizza in Astoria, but only if you&#039;re going to get a fresh whole pizza and not just a slice from the display. They just celebrated their 50th anniversary.<br /><br />Other Astoria favorites include Agnanti, Il Bambino, Taverna Kyclades, Tratorria L&#039;incontro. La Guli is a great bakery.

				This will be an unpopular view here but I&#039;ve stood by it and will continue to stand by it: Agnanti = way overrated!&nbsp; Several bad experiences in a row despite once being a regular customer put a stop to any further visits.&nbsp; (They are also definitely not old school...Agnanti hasn&#039;t been around for more than about 6 or 7 years, though there was previously a different Greek restaurant at that location, under different ownership).<br /><br />Now Gregory&#039;s on 23rd Avenue and 26th Street...that&#039;s a not-so-well known gem!
