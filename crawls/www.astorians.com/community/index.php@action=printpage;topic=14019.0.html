				The Active Self-Defense Classes are happening every Wednesday. <br />See Sensei Orlando&#039;s Blog at http://martialways.blogspot.com (http://martialways.blogspot.com) to have an idea of what the class is like!<br /><br />Need I say again that... the classes are <strong>FREE</strong>!<br /><br />Come join us this Wednesday @ 33-50 82nd St. <br />Children 10+ are encouraged to come. (&quot;Learn how ward off Bullies 101&quot;?) <br /><br />You will get in better shape with this class and you will learn how to defend yourself in various scenarios. You will learn what real-life self-defense really consists of (instead of Hollywood-style selfdef, where you can magically fly across the room with a kick!)<br /><br />Contact info:<br />Sensei Orlando<br />MKD Karate for Children &amp; Adults<br />http://www.mkdkarate.com (http://www.mkdkarate.com)<br />http://martialways.blogspot.com (http://martialways.blogspot.com)<br />646-335-6465<br />

				Hello everyone!!!<br />&nbsp;<br />The Self-Defense classes are going so great and every week we have new people joining up! <br />&nbsp;<br />If you&#039;re like me, you have at some point in your life, thought about what actions to take in worst-case/ life-or-death scenarios. The funny thing is that in my thoughts I execute cool movie stunts and all ends well! However as we all know... It&#039;s one thing to think you can fight like Charlie&#039;s Angels, and another thing to actually know what proper actions to take --- to save your life. <br />&nbsp;<br />What&#039;s so cool about these classes?<br />* These classes teach you exactly what you need to know to get yourself out of the bad, worse, and worst situations you can think of.&nbsp; <br />* The group is an incredibly cool and friendly of people, of all ages. Most of them are from our neighborhood, so you get to meet new friends! Some are from other areas of Queens and even Manhattan! If you&#039;re a social bee, consider this your social networking hour while practising your life-saving moves :-)<br />* The instructor is talented, experienced, compassionate and inspiring to the bones. Come to class only once and you&#039;ll find yourself coming every week!<br />* For classes so valuable... they are FREE! Ain&#039;t that a head-scratcher?!<br />&nbsp;<br />Sensei Orlando continues his free Self-Defense classes tomorrow - Wednesday @ 7.30-8.30pm, at St. Marks 33-50 82nd St, JH 11372 <br />His website is http://www.mkdkarate.com (http://www.mkdkarate.com)<br /><br />Just email me back to let me know that you too want to come by!<br />&nbsp;<br />See you all tomorrow!<br />&nbsp;<br />Yours,<br />Dolly<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;
