				Hi all-<br />I have a friend coming in from out of town tonight.&nbsp; I thought we&#39;d go for dinner near my place between the NW Broadway &amp; 36th Av stop, then maybe a drink afterwards.&nbsp; Since it&#39;s sooooo frickin cold out (he brought it with him from Minnesota), I wanted to keep it local and not jump back on the train for a cool bar.&nbsp; Does anyone have suggestions for a good bar around Broadway and 31st?&nbsp; Is the Crescent Lounge any good?<br />Thanks!

				The only problem with the Crescent Lounge is that it&#39;s pretty small.&nbsp; I really like the atmosphere, though.&nbsp; When it&#39;s full it can be very loud (not unlike many bars!).&nbsp; I&#39;ve never been on a Friday night but I would say get there as early as possible to snag a comfortable seat.&nbsp; You can also order food in there -&nbsp; I did that recently and ordered from the new Indian place, Mughal Dinner (not mind-blowing but tasty enough), so I know they have that menu behind the bar.

				Crescent Lounge is a very nice spot, very laid back and you get a good mix of locals and peeps who are just out and about and who happen to stop in for a drink (such as yourselves). We went there a while back after going to Stamatis for great Greek food (right on Broadway in between 31st and 32nd) it was around 9:30 and it was not too full and everyone was just chillin out conversing, having a drink or two and listening to some tunes. I also enjoy the decor, you almost feel like you are in someones private parlor. Enjoy the chilly night out wherever you may end up :wink:

				Crescent Lounge is great. They&#39;re very laid back and your fourth drink is always on the house. The bartender Alex, who works Thursday nights, he&#39;s hot.Â  :wink:

				Crescent Lounge is my absolute favorite bar in Astoria. I do prefer to go on off nights, but the bartenders are always really nice to me and even if I&#39;m alone I can relax and have a drink and not feel uncomfortable at all. <br /><br />i love that it&#39;s neither a sports bar nor a trendy euro-lounge.
