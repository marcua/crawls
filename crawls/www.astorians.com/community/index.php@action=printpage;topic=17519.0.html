				Oh jeez I just got into a heated argument with some guy on my block because my dog was doing its business. Remind you I&#039;m holding a bag in hand bending down when he started to literally go off on me that my dog isn&#039;t allowed to &quot;go&quot; on the side walk. <br /><br />At that point I had a bag of crap and him in front of me, if only I did what I had in my mind :D hehe

				Nah, too bad you didn&#039;t have a well-trained male dog and you could give the command, &quot;PPT&quot; (Potty Protection Time) and allow the dog to lift his leg on the jerk!

				I notice that there is a lot more dog poop on the sidewalk when it snows or rains. Some do owners feel it&#039;s okay to not clean up after their dog if the weather is bad. Going to the store today I counted 5 poop remnants on my block. Curb you dog means try to have your dog do it&#039;s business near the curb. Most of the dog poop left on my property is not at the curb, but by my fence or even in the middle of the sidewalk. Sometimes I&#039;m sitting right on my front steps and people walking their dog allow them to pee or poop within 3 feet of me. Not all people who own dogs are considerate or have common sense.

				I completly agree with you AlexNYC but when you see someone who is picking up your not going to harrass them. <br /><br />I see a lot of people who don&#039;t pick up and I tell them that it&#039;s not fair for us the people Who have the desence to pick up to get the aftermath. Also a lot of people walk their dogs without leashes letting them go where ever they want.
