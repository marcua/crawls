				Hi all,<br /><br />Over the next few days I&#039;m going to be working on doing some major upgrades and updates to the site. For the time being things might look a little weird while I get everything translated from the old software over to the new and get the bugs worked out. Feel free to report any oddities here.

				There&#039;s some cool new features to the forum if you guys haven&#039;t checked them out yet.<br /><br />Under your profile (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?action=profile) for example if you click on &quot;Modify Profile&quot; you&#039;ll see a dropdown there with lots of options.<br /><br />There&#039;s an &quot;Ignore Boards&quot; list where you can ignore certain boards (like Random Gabble)<br />There&#039;s also the ability to ignore certain posters, or add people to your buddy list.<br />In addition there&#039;s some new &quot;notification&quot; options for how you might want to be notified of topics that you&#039;re interested in. It can send you a daily digest of all the topics you&#039;ve posted in, or immediately notify you.<br /><br />The site also now has expanded RSS options. If you prefer to read the site in an RSS reader format you can just go to whatever boards you&#039;re interested in and grab the URL and put it your RSS reader and you&#039;ll get all the posts from that board.<br /><br />Also, don&#039;t forget a simplified version of the site is available on your phone by going here: http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?wap2<br />

				I click the &quot;Unread posts&quot; link when I first get here, then click through the posts I want to read, and use the &quot;back&quot; button to get back to the list.&nbsp; For the record, the site appears to function exactly the same way it did before.&nbsp; I&#039;m confused at what all the fuss is about.

				The difference between using the &#039;back button&#039; and &#039;clicking the link again&#039; on the &quot;unread posts&quot; page actually makes a pretty big impact on the server. Which is why I was caching that page. If you think about the number of new unread indexes this makes the server compile the number goes up dramatically. If your browser goes back to a cached version this page is loaded from the browser, and the server doesn&#039;t have to query the database to determine which posts you&#039;ve read or not.<br /><br />To give you an idea the server goes from around 10-20% average utilization to around 60% utilization because of this page (which is a popular one). That&#039;s not a problem most of the time, but I&#039;ve had a few times where if there are a lot of visitors is overloads the server and slows things down a lot for everyone. Whereas if we cache these pages the server has no problem.<br /><br />Still working on a solution.

				Thanks for making some adjustments, merm. Although it&#039;s been a week or so since you asked your question about how we use the site, I use both the &quot;unread posts since last visit&quot; and the back button.&nbsp;

				2 words: Tabbed browsing :)<br /><br />I click unread posts, then I middle click (or ctrl+click) on every unread post that I would like to read. No back buttons, no refresh, and I have a new page for every topic I&#039;m interested in reading, now, later or tomorrow ;)

				The ban error should be fixed now. Stephanie, when you say it has to &quot;take&quot; where are you looking?
