			PLEASE read the following article. It&#039;s starting to feel like we live in a military state.<br /><br />http://www.ny1.com/ny/TopStories/SubTopic/index.html?topicintid=1&amp;subtopicintid=1&amp;contentintid=45737<br /><br />Then take a second to express your concern: http://mta-nyc.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/mta_nyc.cfg/php/enduser/ask.php

			When will we learn to stop sacrificing freedom in the name of security? Anyone who thinks that laws can stop someone from taking pictures of a bridge or subway needs to stop kidding themselves. With today's technology, cameras and video recorders can be embedded into anything. Therefore, it is impracticle to think that we can detect anything beyond the unknowing tourist taking snapshots of a beautiful sunset.<br /><br />To those that would trade my freedoms I say, freedom has a price. If you're not willing to pay that price, you should pack your things and leave. I do not subscribe to your illusion of false security.

			I have heard from a trusted member of our community that the ban has been lifted. If this is so, then we are headed in the right direction. Please allow me more time to gather details, or please feel free to post them yourself.<br /><br />----Zero.

			I was the one who told Zeno that, but I wasn't aware of the reinstatement of the proposed ban that's mentioned in the article. &nbsp;I was referring to the initial proposed ban, which was withdrawn sometime this past spring, I think.<br /><br />I'm looking into it. &nbsp;The odd thing is that the NY1 article says that it was published in the New York State Register last week, and that the 45 day comment period will end on January 10. &nbsp;I've been looking through the Register, and I can't find any reference to it at all (although I'm not done looking), but even more puzzling, for this week's Register, the 45 day comment period ends November 12. &nbsp;Will report back.

			This article was from several months to a year ago. Unfortunately they (NY1) don't make that clear on their website. That's probably why it's confusing!
