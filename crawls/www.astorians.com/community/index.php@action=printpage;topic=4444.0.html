				It&#39;s finally time after about 13 months of work and jackhammering and trucks backing up at 6:30am, the work on my street (32nd St. between Astoria Blvd. and 24th Ave.) is almost done.&nbsp; The construction crew said it would be done by Christmas and they&#39;re all laid off at the end of the year.&nbsp; It&#39;s actually looking pretty good!&nbsp; <br /><br />They laid in the new street this past week and have started bricking over the ramp/stair part in the middle of the street.&nbsp; I&#39;m very excited to see the finished product and how long we can keep it free of trash and graffiti.&nbsp; I really hope the neighborhood will put an effort into keeping it looking nice.

				Yeah! It&#39;s looking really sharp! The ramp looks like it will be quite attractive when it&#39;s done. I&#39;m also looking forward to being able to take that block of 32nd St to the subway instead of the noisier 31st St route... Steps will be a big improvement over the old &quot;scramble up the overgrown hill&quot; approach from before the construction.<br /><br />It does seem like that block has been a bit of a magnet for graffiti. I hope that the improvements will discourage the street artists some. Will they be putting in decent lighting?

				That&#39;s a cool block.&nbsp; My friend used to live in the apartment that the apartment scenes were shot in for the start of Goodfellas.&nbsp; It was interesting to see the camera angles out the window on the screen and see the same view out the window.&nbsp; Of course, all the fake apartments built across the street weren&#39;t there though ;)
