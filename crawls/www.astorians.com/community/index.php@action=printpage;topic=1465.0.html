				I need a seamtress to take up a couple of hems in some pants.&nbsp; They&#39;re cuffed &amp; I can&#39;t figure out how to do them right.<br /><br />Also need someone to (1) hang curtain rods (2) install light fixture (simple installation -- just need the right screw for it) and more as time goes on!<br /><br />Also, need someone to paint!<br /><br />Thanks

				I have had Lammy over at the &quot;Fabric and Variety&quot; store on Ditmars and 33rd (or so) do a couple sewing related things for me like that and have been really happy. They are also pretty affordable in my opinion.

				Thanks, merm, I&#39;ll try them -- didn&#39;t know.&nbsp; Is that the store that has bolts of fabric outside their front door and is next to GNC, the Thrift shop, etc. -- that block?

				The tailor at the tuxedo rental place on Ditmars and 34th is also very good.&nbsp; I&#39;ve taken a lot to him and have been pleased.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was $10 for a complicated hem though which I don&#39;t think is particularly&nbsp; &nbsp; cheap.

				Yep that&#39;s the one. But it&#39;s not a GNC anymore, it&#39;s a UPS Store :)<br />Just discovered that the other day.

				Thanks both of you.&nbsp; I went to look for Lammy early this morning.&nbsp; They were closed so I continued on until I found the tuxedo/dry cleaning place.&nbsp; I left my pants there to be altered.&nbsp; $11 so that&#39;s good and the man seemed to know just what he was doing.&nbsp; Now all I need is a handyman and painter!

				I used to be a professional house painter and would paint your apartment cheaply if you&#39;re interested.
