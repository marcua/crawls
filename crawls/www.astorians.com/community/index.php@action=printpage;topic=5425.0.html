				Ladies and Gentlemen, the Mega Million jackpot is $340 million!&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t normally play any of the lottery games, or gamble, for that matter (I am the worst person to take to Atlantic City&nbsp; :-) ) However, I sometimes buy a dollar or two worth of tickets if the jackpot gets over a $100 million!&nbsp; For the next drawing, I think I will break my piggy bank and buy $5, yes $5 worth of tickets!&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, I was wondering what you people would spend that sort of loot on!&nbsp; Mainly, what would your FIRST purchase be?&nbsp; <br /><br />To begin with, I would probably purchase a nice house in Westchester County (the groans and boos are so loud, I can almost hear them in my office).&nbsp; I fell in love with the area when I was going to college at SUNY Purchase, and I would like to return there at some point, when I want to &quot;settle down.&quot;&nbsp; And of course, I would keep an apartment in Astoria&nbsp; :-)<br />

				I think about this all the time, because I&#039;m dirt poor.&nbsp; First thing I would do would be to pay off my student loans and credit card debt.&nbsp; Then I&#039;d buy my sis and I a truly kick-ass apartment here in Astoria.&nbsp; After that, I&#039;d put away a load of it to save for when I&#039;m smart enough to own and operate a pastry shop.&nbsp; Then I&#039;d pay off the mortgages for my parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins, and as many friends as I could. And then I&#039;d donate a massive chunk to animal rescue charities.&nbsp; Sorry, but I much prefer animals to people.&nbsp; Oh yeah, and I&#039;d finally go to the friggin&#039; doctor and dentist, since I&#039;d actually be able to afford it!&nbsp; Lord only knows what&#039;s wrong with me!<br /><br />It&#039;s fun to dream....

				Buy a house in Rockland on the water, a house in Donegal Ireland, and a house in San Francisco. Buy my parents a new house- by my inlaw&#039;s a new house.

				Regarding giving your family and friends money - I would imagine that they&#039;d have to pay tax on the money you&#039;d give them, so in order to get around that I&#039;d probably give each person $10,000/year - which for some people in my family would be a very generous gift.

				I have thought/dreamed about this for many, many years. The obvious answer for me would be to gather all my children and my closest friends and tell them that *we* are going to be claiming this ticket as *ours*. That would take care of the gifting. It would be divided among 16 of us. That&#039;s more than enough money for anyone. Then I would set up a trust fund with 50% of my money to benefit stem cell research in the hopes of finding a cure, or perhaps even a preventative, for diseases like MS or Parkinson&#039;s Disease. Then I would take in 2 foster children and fund their education. I would endow a $1M fund for burial services and perpetual care plots at the Hartsdale Pet Cemetery. I would buy a new car. Not a used car, a new car. Since I love where I am living, I won&#039;t be moving. But all new furnishings would be really nice. <br /><br />The remaining monies would allow me to live a healthier lifestyle by allowing me better choices at the supermarket.<br /><br />Ahh, I wish!

				I think about this a lot too, although I never play lotto. Well I might once or twice a year. Not really feeling the urge to go downstairs and get in the line to buy a ticket. But if I did, and I won a nice sum of money...<br /><br />I&#039;d buy an apartment with a nice plot of outdoor space, and get my car back up here, and I&#039;d have a garage space for it. I love astoria dearly - truly I do - but if money were no option I&#039;d buy a place in the west village. Wandering the streets over there feels like being in a fairy tale. I&#039;d go places a lot on the weekend. Like fly down to Austin or to my dad&#039;s place in Louisiana. Just wherever I feel like going.<br /><br />I&#039;d pay off my brother and sister-in-law&#039;s house, and put aside money for their kids&#039; college fund. Buy my mom a condo in Austin. Give my dad the funds to renovate my grandparents house, plus buy him a nice new pickup truck. Pay off my friend&#039;s debts. I would eat sushi like 3 days a week. I would take lots of cabs. I would go see broadway shows and plays, and go see the opera. Replace almost all the clothes and shoes in my closet with new ones. I would buy this (http://www.crateandbarrel.com/family.aspx?c=931&amp;f=6643) sofa and reupholster it in a fabulous fabric. Pay for me and my gal-pals from college to go to Greece (was waiting to do this for my honeymoon, but forget that).<br /><br />And, surprisingly, keep working in New York - at least for the time being. But when the time was right, I&#039;d sell the village apartment and use that money to buy a bungalow in Austin. Eeeee.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and put some in savings. I&#039;ve always wondered what that wealth management service is that advertises on NPR. Maybe I&#039;d give those folks a call.

				Although I have never bought any of these tickets, I wish ....&nbsp; :lol:<br />If I won 350 million dollars, I would do the following:<br /><br />- send 20 million back home to my parents and also pay off their debts and buy them a wonderful summer house with a farm somewhere on the river, so they can enjoy for the rest of their lives<br />- send 10 million to my brother back home and buy him an apartment and a new car<br />- buy myself and my bf a great house ( didnt really think this through so still dont know where, but somewhere outside the city )<br />- buy an apartment in the Village<br />- buy a Mercedes for me and my bf as well<br />- give 10 million to my mother-in-law<br />- since I do not have student loans to pay off because I am going to the cheapest college I can afford, I would transfer to a good expensive college and finish there<br />- open my own business eg. invest in this country so they will give me a green card finally&nbsp; :lol:<br />- give my bf 10 million just for the hack of it&nbsp; 8-)<br />- bring here my little cousin from back home, and pay the best doctors in USA to treat her - she is 3 years old and has nephritis&nbsp; :cry:<br />- give my cousins and relatives and grandparents some money ( to ones that I like&nbsp; :evil: )<br />- build a great house back home so I have where to stay during the visits.<br />- give some money to my best friends who were always there for me<br />- buy a condo on a tropical island and a condo in a ski resort<br />- go for a around-the-world trip with my bf, my parents, my brother and my mother in-law<br />- of course put aside for the education of my children one day and for their houses and cars<br />- put the rest of the money in the bank and enjoy as long as I have the money<br />- and of course give to the charity for the children<br /><br />...and thats &quot;all&quot; I can think of right now...If I think of anything else , will edit later ...<br />How I wish....<br />

				Yeah, and also, that&#039;s $355 million if you take it in chunks of something like $17 million/year for 20 years. (I don&#039;t know the actual amounts or length of time.) If you get a lump sum payout, it&#039;s a lot less, maybe half of that.
