				How about organizing a little low stress pick-up soccer game in astoria park or on roosevelt island? I think if we could get at least&nbsp; five to a side, it would be fun... Any soccer players out there?

				Cool. I&#039;ll try to scope out Astoria Park this weekend, so if we get enough people we can play next sunday (or saturday of there is a preference). Are there any preferences as to time? <br /><br />All skill and fitness levels are welcome. Soccer is a team game, so we can even things out by distributing players of different levels to different teams. In the end, if the teams are even and no one kicks me in the shins, I&#039;m betting we&#039;ll have a good time.

				Either day, but Sunday mornings are preferable for me personally. mightimic, thanks for scoping out a field. Might have a 7th player with me on Sundays but can&#039;t guarantee it....He&#039;s a frisbee player 3x a week and might be too pooped out for another game on Sunday but I&#039;ll do my best to rally him in.

				Well, I did a little investigating, and it seems like the best place to play would be in the middle of the track in astoria park. However, there&#039;s a sign that says &quot;no ball playing&quot;. Does anyone know if they enforce that? It also might be a risk if we send the ball into runners... Otherwise, the field all the way on the north-east edge of the park seems the flattest and least used. <br /><br />As for the time, it seems like 4 or 4:30pm on Sunday (the 23rd) would be the best for most people (I hope you would still be able to make it, edava...). That way we could also grab a beer afterwards if there&#039;s interest. <br /><br />As for organization, I can bring one ball, but it&#039;s always better to have at least two (insert tour de france joke here). Then all we would need are bags or cones to make some goals, and water. I think I can get a couple of my friends to come out from Manhattan, but it would be good to have a couple of more people, just in case, so let&#039;s spread the word...&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Of course, everything depends on the number of people who can make it and the weather...&nbsp;

				I&#039;m all for playing in the middle of the field that is surrounded by the track. The comments have been hit or miss. The few times I&#039;ve brought out my soccer ball out there, we were told once not to play. But I&#039;ve seen people playing there from time to time, too without the reinforcement of the rules, so I&#039;d say we can make it our meeting place but maybe have a backup field in case someone does tell us to go away.

				I agree with edava. Let&#039;s try the field in the middle of the track, and if for some reason we can&#039;t use it or get kicked out, we can try the field to the north of the tracks, by Ditmars. Let&#039;s meet on sunday at 4pm. I tried calling about the field on 33rd and 20th (run by the federation of italian american societies of queens), but they won&#039;t let us use it unless we are an official team with liability insurance for our players. I&#039;m not sure we have reached that level of organization quite yet... <br /><br />To recap:<br /><br />When: Sunday - 4pm<br />Where: Astoria Park - the field in the middle of the track (at least to start)<br />What: Soccer, of course!

				someone was had mentiond the park out here at 48th st. I live on 45th and there is in fact a soccer field at 48th that some of the club teams had been playing at bu i havent seen them in a while. I had been going out and kicking my own ball around so thats something we definitly could do. I would like whoever was is organizing this, to maybe start a mailing list.&nbsp; I work at Modell&#039;s in Times square, and normally work sunday mornngs so if i&#039;m off on time i&#039;ll be out there!

				I like the idea of a mailing list/site, but I guess that would be up to mightimic if he&#039;s up for it. I think you can do something free on a yahoo list (like they do for frisbee) but this might also be a place for us to check if we&#039;re meeting or not, etc...

				The mailing list is a good idea if this becomes a regular thing, which I hope it does. And we can definitely check out the park on 48th for next time too (It sounds like it could be a nicer field than in Astoria Park). However, I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll be able to organize on a regular basis, so if someone wants to take the reigns I am more than willing to hand them over. <br /><br />As far as this sunday goes, we should have enough people when you factor in that a bunch of my non-astorian friends are also coming (ringers?). The weather should be great, so hopefully we&#039;ll also get some last-minute astorian add-ons too. It would be great to have a whole bunch of astorians so we can start a regular weekly game. <br /><br />Who else can make it?

				Hello everyone,<br />I just noticed this thread, and am very excited about this soccer pick-up game idea.&nbsp; I would like to participate, but obviously can&#039;t make the game today, which is in about fifteen minutes.&nbsp; I play Zogsports soccer on Sundays, so as long as my Zogsports games does not conflict with the pick-up game, I&#039;m in.<br /><br />I also wanted to throw out a field idea:&nbsp; Long Island City High School&#039;s field, on Broadway between 21st and 14th St.&nbsp; It&#039;s a huge, beautiful field.&nbsp; It&#039;s usually locked, but there are holes in the fence through which people climb in to use the field.&nbsp; It is definitely used by others, so we&#039;d have to get it at a time when no one else was on it, as we obviously wouldn&#039;t be able to kick anyone off.&nbsp; I&#039;ll scope it out this week and report back.

Got worse this morning, but will basically be healing it all this week and hoping more people will show up for the next game! Very very annoyed at myself.

				Ntrain, So, what was it like at the LIC field, were people there in the morning or afternoon? Sorry, where is Ravenswood Park? If the LIC field is only accessible through &quot;holes in a fence,&quot; is there any place to lock up a bike? <br /><br />If my knee is heeled up by next week, in soccer condition, I might be interested in a pick up game Saturday morning. It would also be nice to have more than 4 people come by since the 1st attempt at this where people posted they&#039;d come, turned out to be only 2 people from Astoria and 2 brave Manhattanites who made the trek to Queens!&nbsp; :&nbsp; )

				This was a 1 time occurence. mightymic got it organized one weekend long ago, but so many people who said they&#039;d be interested ended up not showing up, that it was the 1st and last.
