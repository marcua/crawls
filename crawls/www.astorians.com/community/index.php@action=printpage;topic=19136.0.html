				Come and meet local activists at the Powhatan Regular Democratic Club.&nbsp; We would love to get you involved (find our group on facebook).&nbsp; Councilmembers make recommendations for community board appointments and the Queens Borough President makes the appointments.&nbsp; We are aiming to have her at our October meeting, so you can talk with her in person then if you&#039;re interested!&nbsp; Our September meeting will be about GOTV (Get Out The Vote) efforts for the local Democratic ticket (Maloney for Congress, Gianaris for State Senate and Simotas for Assembly).

				HI Gamer,<br /><br />Here is the information for the Powhatan democratic Club meeting on September 8, all are welcome:<br /><br />http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=19256.0<br /><br />Our next meeting will be held on a special night WEDNESDAY September 8th at our clubhouse located at 41-05 Newtown Road, Astoria, NY 11103 at 7 PM.<br /><br />This is our pre-primary election meeting! We will be joined by our Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, our candidate for State Senate NYS Assemblymember Michael Gianaris and our candidate for NYS Assembly Aravella Simotas. There are important races on the ballot this... primary, come learn what Powhatan will be doing on Primary Day September 14th.<br /><br />Our petitioning effort this year was a huge success! Thank you to all who helped out. We collected over 1700 signatures for our slate. This was the largest number we have had in some time and our Powhatan team really came through.<br /><br />Prior to our meeting on TUESDAY September 7 at 7:30PM, we encourage you to attend the United Community Civic Association&#039;s Annual 9/11 Memorial Candlelight Ceremony. This event is done in conjunction with the Port Authority of NY/NJ. The vigil will be held at McManus Memorial Park at 81 Street/Grand Central Parkway Service Road. We hope that you can attend this important event for our community as well as our meeting.<br /><br />Hoping that each and every one of you had a great summer and we look forward to seeing you on WEDNESDAY September 8th.<br /><br />Light refreshments will be served.
