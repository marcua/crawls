				Does anyone actually <em>like</em> McCain in this election? I mean I can understand not liking Obama or just preferring McCain because he&#039;s a Republican, but do people really like him as he is and the way his campaign is being run? His response to the tire gauge thing has vaguely horrified me, and so did the ad that inspired this response from Paris Hilton, and I&#039;m kind of baffled by him at this point. I&#039;m probably asking this in the wrong city, but even outside of this it seems the McCain supporters are more concerned with insulting Obama than supporting McCain.

(http://gm-volt.com/)<br /><br />Paris says they&#039;d use offshore drilling until incentives allow production of the cars. This is not a possible, factual statement because offshore drilling won&#039;t yield dividends for 7 years and there will already be production before the 7 years are up. Therefore, something that takes longer cannot fiscal support something that takes a shorter amount of time. It is not possible.<br /><br />Now, you can argue that offshore drilling can still be valuable, but it is not a temporary replacement for research and development. These cars will be ready to be in the field before the offshore sites make the necessary dividends. It makes more sense to just invest in the technology that&#039;s coming rather than take on the costs of both.<br /><br />

That fuel needs to come from somewhere.

				Also, let&#039;s not forget the fact that the oil companies are sitting on hundreds of acres of untapped land that they haven&#039;t started drilling yet.&nbsp; Why should they get even more property, when they haven&#039;t taken advantage of what they already have?
