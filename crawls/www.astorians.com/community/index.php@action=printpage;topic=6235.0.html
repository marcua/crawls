				If your pants tear away with a stiff breeze... you may be a stripper<br />If you check your underway drawer for spare change... you may be a stripper<br />If you have an operating tv on top of a non operating tv... you may be a stripper... I mean a redneck.

				My first job in publishing involved a sleazy boss who thought he was SO funny. Like the time he gave me and my co-worker $500 bonuses for exceeding our sales quota.....and paid us in singles.&nbsp; :?<br /><br />Talk about humiliation, going to the bank and depositing a truckload of dollar bills. I felt even worse for the teller.<br /><br />My BF at the time was like, &quot;They probably thought you were a stripper.&quot;&nbsp; :-(

				The teller at the bank when I was a waitress was a skeezy old guy. He thought I was a stripper. You could tell by the way he would touch the dollars when he counted them.
