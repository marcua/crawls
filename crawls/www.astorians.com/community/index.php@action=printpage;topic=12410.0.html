				Hello all,<br /><br />For all of those who are new to the area, or those lifelong residents like myself who smell human feces all day, we have an issue. That smell you are inhaling all day, everyday, is human waste from the Bowery Bay Sewage Treatment plant located near 19th avenue and 46th street. I don&#039;t know about you, but I cannot keep my windows open during the day because if I do, when I get home, my apartment will smell like I have a backed up toilet. This is a serious health hazard that needs to be attended to immediately. If the city can put up two unnecessary new baseball stadiums in less than a year, they can certainly resolve a simple problem that is affecting the lives of so many hard working citizens.<br /><br />I have called Vallone&#039;s office to complain about the smell of human feces that is destroying the air quality in our neighborhood. His secretary, Anne, is writing a letter to the Bowery Bay sewage treatment plant to ask them the status of the repairs of the domes. The domes that usually cover the pools of human waste, are damaged and some are alltogether missing. This is the reason the fumes of your neighbors toilet messes are wafting into your windows. If you enjoy smelling human excrement everyday, then don&#039;t do anything. If you value your health and quality of life here in Astoria, please do your part. Call up Vallone&#039;s office, 718-274-4500, make a complaint. They seem to be willing to write a letter to the Bowery Bay on our behave. Call up the News and ask them to do a story on it. Call 311 and complain. Do something!

				I recall this a few years ago when someone called Gianaris office and they said it was a repair that was to be completed in a few months. (check the thread on this site)<br /><br />This is what happens when you add people without any concern for infrastucture. This, along with the Con Ed blackout, lack of school space, crowded subway and clogged streets, are different parts of the same problem. The community suffers and increasinginly looks rundown and not desirable.<br /><br />The sewage plant is a few blocks from the Steel Equities &quot;public park&quot; location. You should check out the waterfront in that area. I love the big pipe discharging water into the canal that borders the &quot;public park&quot; at the end of 19th Avenue.

				I can&#039;t believe that there are 203 views on this post, and yet only one reply. Is it that everyone doesn&#039;t smell the sewage, or is it that people just don&#039;t care because they don&#039;t plan on living here in a few years?

				I frequently bike up towards Astoria Park and can almost always smell the sewage treatment plant. There&#039;s no masking that scent. It&#039;s sometimes stronger in the early hours. Guess it depends on the wind direction. <br />From the residents I&#039;ve seen they seem use to it, I suppose.

				Astorians,<br />&nbsp; I hate to admit it ( :evil: ), but I have noticed this unique aroma in my apartment as well lately.&nbsp; I thought that it was my imagination and over-sensitive nose or a by-product of living in a large pre-war building.&nbsp; But, I have noticed it from <span class="bbc_u">time to time</span>.&nbsp; I live on south side of the GCP/Astoria Bl. on 44th Street for the record.<br />&nbsp; Again, just a minor temporary inconvenience of living in an urban environment in my humble opinion and, certainly, nothing to write home about.<br />&nbsp; I guess that I&#039;m just too busy focusing all of the great smells that Astoria offers like fresh baking bread from the local bakeries or the fresh smell of the air after a rain shower that wafts into my bedroom window at night to really complain about it.<br />&nbsp; I&#039;m probably alone on this, but I also enjoy walking into my building after a long day at work and trying to figure out what my various neighbors are cooking for dinner (fried fish aside).&nbsp; I love the sights, sounds, AND SMELLS of living in such a great city and such a wonderful, vibrant neighborhood.<br />&nbsp; If I wanted to live in a town with pristine air quality, I would have located to New Mexico, Alaska, or maybe upstate Minnesota.&nbsp; I knew what I was in for before I moved here and I have no regrets...only great experiences and memories.<br /><br />-=:Astoristani:=-<br /><br />

				I spend a fair amount of time on 45th St, north of 21st Ave. It is, on some days, obnoxious indeed. One also has to wonder if the plant is as lax about what goes into the water as it is about what goes into the air.<br /><br /><sub>Now <em>my</em> weekly rant:</sub><br /><br />To some others, I would like to say: this board is a great resource for people, like the original poster, to air their concerns about a problem and try to connect with others who might help solve it.<br /><br />The community district has over 200,000 residents. It&#039;s very likely that any problem a person can choose will affect only some of us. It accomplishes nothing for those who don&#039;t share a problem to deny that it exists.&nbsp; If a problem doesn&#039;t affect or concern you, that&#039;s fine, but I think you might do better to just let it go by. Another person&#039;s concern may be reasonable and legitimate, even when it happens not to affect you.<br /><br />This isn&#039;t the Chamber of Commerce. Astoria&#039;s a fine community, but we don&#039;t have to pretend, well, um, that our s___ doesn&#039;t stink.<br /><br />Of course, if you live in the neighborhood of the plant and you really <em>like</em> for your house and yard to smell like a pig farm, then you have good reason to argue with those object.<br /><br /><sub>Thank you. That&#039;s enough of that for the rest of the month.</sub><br />

				&quot;Why don&#039;t the people on this board embrace the positive things about the neighborhood--that they willingly chose to live in.&nbsp; Instead of constantly bashing it with every little pet peave that comes to their ego-centric, self-absorbed, self-entitled minds?&quot;<br /><br /><br />Glad you brought that up. Because a good neighborhood is one with its residents fully engaged. This is proven time and again.<br /><br />The politicans need us. Not only to keep them on focus, but to give them feedback on what are problems. <br /><br />For example, street naming might be fun, but idea do you have to finally solve our chronically overcrowded schools (come to think of it, funny how we don&#039;t see postings by parents on this board on this issue.)<br /><br />Pointing the finger at Con Ed is not only tiresome (do something about it already and move on dammit) but hollow if you continue to add to the population big time.<br /><br />And yes, this sewage problem has been drifting over our community for years. And all that seems to be done is to let a politician know, watch them clear their throats and say they will look into it, we give them a few months to follow up, then forget about it when the windows are closed in the winter. Next year someone else notices, and repeat the process.<br /><br />What is needed in western Queens is a civic that is not part of the incestuous old boy network, that can look around to other successful efforts in other communities (and they are out there, you just need spend a little effort to&nbsp; look) and BRING NEW IDEAS into our community.<br /><br />Just because there is building going on does not mean our community is gettng better (yes, I know what the newspapers tell us.) <br /><br />I think if you took a poll of people that have lived here 10 20 or more years, the majority will clearly tell you that things are not getting better. <br /><br /><br />

				LeavingSoon, where do you live that you smell sewage?<br />i am literally all over astoria daily, and never get a whiff.<br />i live across from astoria park, and the only time i get a hint of it is if the wind is blowing east (which honestly is almost never for some reason), because of the sewage plant on randalls island.&nbsp; i can actually see it from my bedroom window, and only maybe twice a month do i get a whiff of it for a few seconds.

				Oliver, if you &#039;are all over Astoria daily&#039; may I invite you to go up to Berrian Blvd near the Steinway Mansion. My Hangstoms Map has in big bold letters &#039;BOWERY BAY SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT.&#039;<br /><br />Yup. There is a sewage plant there ... about 2 or 3 blocks from the proposed park on the Steel Equities site. I would suggest you check out the waterfront at the end of 19th Ave across from the proposed park to see what the waterfront next a sewage plant looks like.<br /><br />28Grand, of all the things facing us in Astoria, I find it fascinating that the point about the &#039;old boys network&#039; seemed to have pushed your button. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know what to say, and have nothing to add.&nbsp; :|

				yes, i am aware of the sewage plant there north of berrian, as kids we used to sneak in there on bikes just for the thrill of the chase, our goal would be to get to the north shore before being noticed..&nbsp; i&#039;m always on the 20-00 blocks in the forties and never smell anything.&nbsp; there are only three residences north 20th ave, two on 18-00&#039;s steinway, and the mansion on 18-00&#039;s 41st.&nbsp; all the rest are factories.&nbsp; OP stated &quot;I cannot keep my windows open during the day&quot;, so i was curious as to where they lived.<br /><br />the waterfront on 19ave looks like that because it is still waters.&nbsp; also as kids we used to climb on the &quot;pirate ship&quot; that sunk there, which is really just an old sunken barge stuck in the mud.&nbsp; someone should really clean that inlet out and take some dirt from the mountain that borders the sewage plant and landfill it in.

				I mean, afterall, we should have the expectations that a sewage plant should work, and people are getting paid out of our taxes to make it work and to ensure that the infrastructure does not get overloaded, not that we should move away if it doesn&#039;t or are fools to stay next to it if THEY don&#039;t do their job!<br /><br />Duh-ah!<br /><br />&nbsp;:mrgreen:

				I&#039;m not about to get into the blame game with this nor take sides.<br /><br />But,&nbsp; I live closer to Astoria Park and have many times smelled this foul smell.&nbsp; I&#039;ve smelt it on Ditmars and 31st.&nbsp; In fact, there are tons of threads on here that deal with the smell in Astoria.&nbsp; Just do a search.&nbsp; It&#039;s not everyday and not constant, but I do smell it at least once a month.&nbsp; When running in Astoria Park, that smell is nauseating at times.&nbsp; I think there&#039;s another sewage or trash plant across the water by the park.

				I grew up living near Astoria Park and the smell was more constant back in the late 60&#039;s, early 70&#039;s-just about every other day.

				Hi Guys,<br />&nbsp;<br />I just wanted to take a moment to clarify some confusion about Council Member Vallone&#039;s response to Grant&#039;s posting on Queens Crap.&nbsp; The Council Member did indeed reply to what was an open letter to him on Queens Crap from Mr. Brandeis.&nbsp; In his letter to Council Member Vallone Mr. Brandeis referred to Astoria as a place that was slowly turning into a ghetto, a statement that Mr. Vallone obviously does not agree with.&nbsp; In his response to Mr. Brandeis Council Member Vallone simply stated:<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;I have spent virtually every day of my life in Astoria and could not disagree more with you about your assessment of our beautiful neighborhood as &quot;becoming a ghetto&quot;. If you really feel that way, you should move into some non-ghetto area and make room for one of the many who are clamoring to live here.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />It is clear the Council Member obviously took umbrage with this characterization of his district and home. The above comment is one of indignation, making the point that Astoria can&#039;t be so bad if so many people are moving here. It was intended to be more ironic than accusatory. However, while he sees the ghetto remark as a gross misrepresentation of the truth, it is not to say that Astoria does not have its problems. In fact, the Council Member works hard every day to correct these problems by working with constituents and government officials. He takes pride that this work, and his father&#039;s before him, which have actually managed to keep Astoria one of the most desirable communities in the entire city. Some things are beyond the control of any City Council Member, but Peter will stake his record against any other representative in the city. <br />&nbsp;<br />To that end, the Council Member will be holding a rally this weekend to fight one of the most pressing problems in the area, the threat of air pollution caused by the many power plants here. The state has approved a new power plant to be built along 20th Ave., making it the 6th, and he is calling upon the community to voice their opposition to this proposal. We ask everyone who cares about Astoria to make their opinions heard, not just on this message board, but to every New Yorker, that we will not stand for this. We need your help to make this community the best it can be. We hope to see you there.

				Hey Cathleen:<br /><br />Is is true that Con Edison is the head of the Economic Devolpment Commission in Queens, and that CHOKE recieved $100,000 from the NY Power Authority - BTW, does anyone on CHOKE have evirnmental credentials?<br /><br />... and that all the expanded power plants are a result of more people from overdevelpment and all those open walls on the cafes in the community that wastes energy?<br /><br />So protesting a powerplant without getting to the source is a bit like giving someone a bandaid to cover blemishses from a case of smallpox.

				Well, saying the foul water smell is &#039;natural&#039; reminds me of saying cows are responsible for global warming. <br /><br />Everyone knows that when it rains the water flows into the rivers untreated. <br /><br />Also, the plants (like just about everything in Astoria) was built for a smaller population. I would not be surprised if they are overtaxed from all this development. We just have no information about this although the folks that belittle the problem seem just a tad to glib for my taste.<br /><br />Interesting point: if the waterfront stinks does it make sense to build on it?<br /><br />&nbsp;:?<br /><br />

				OK, why does the waterfront (and the rest of Astoria) stink?<br /><br />&quot;According to Mr. Schultz&#039;s aides, a major cause of Flushing Bay&#039;s pollution is the flow of raw sewage into the bay and its inland-jutting creek -listed on maps as Flushing River -after heavy rains. At such times, the combination of rain runoff and sewage in the surrounding area&#039;s sewers exceeds the capacity of a nearby pollution-control treatment plant. The excess must be discharged without treatment into the bay, an extension of the East River bordering La Guardia Airport. <br />Proponents of the plan say this would prevent further buildup of the toxic sediments that have long plagued <br /><br />Flushing Bay, curbing its recreational potential, reducing the depth of its marina slips and frequently sending a rotten-eggs smell over College Point, East Elmhurst and other nearby neighborhoods.&quot; <br /><br />Full text:<br />http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6D61E30F936A35757C0A961948260<br /><br />Reported in Gazette:<br />http://www.qgazette.com/news/2007/0404/features/009.html<br /><br />Other reports:<br />http://www.cb3qn.nyc.gov/?p=77181<br /><br />http://www.cb3qn.nyc.gov/page/81955/<br /><br />East River Sewage:<br />http://www.springerlink.com/content/x44213r476691224/<br /><br />

				I really like this board and have lots of fun our little community discussing Astoria. <br /><br />Our closest sewage plant is across the river says one ... except, well yes there IS one in our back yard that they now remember sneaking into as a kid.<br /><br />Then there is that little myth that those little bacteria guys in the muck at the bottom of the river are creating all that stink, except, well these pesky little reports by big guys that blame it on sewage.<br /><br />The fact of the matter is very simple.<br /><br />Astoria is NOT getting better. Overdevelopment, and lack of creativity in dealing with this by our leadership, is slowly strangling this community.<br /><br />If its sewage dumped into the waterfront, or a failing electric grid, or lack of seats in our schools, or woefully under equipped ability to respond to emergencies, all have one root cause: overdevelopment.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now those 10 or so people that regularly post on this board that “regularly go around Astoria” but don’t know we have a sewage plant (that has been there for oh 70 years or so) or blame Sponge-Bob and his little buddies for the stench that permeates our fine community will poke fun at these words.<br /><br />Let them. I suspect they have some compelling reasons to do so.<br /><br />But for the rest of you, both those about to move here, and have lived their entire lives here, may I suggest you discuss these issues every chance you get. <br /><br />&nbsp;:mrgreen:

				http://www.awqinc.com/h2s.html (http://www.awqinc.com/h2s.html)<br /><br />Hydrogen sulfide is a naturally occurring gas that causes an odor that can be described as anything from rotten eggs to that of tidal flats at low tide.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gas can be generated in a number of different ways. Decaying organic matter, like that which forms coal or peat moss, can create this gas. A second way to generate this gas is from the reaction of acidic water with aquifer that has a sulfur content. The third way is from the by products of bacteria that use iron or manganese as part of their diet. These bacteria are sometimes referred to as iron bacteria.<br /><br /><br />http://www.armofthesea.info/flora_fauna/ff_kingdomspp/monera.htm (http://www.armofthesea.info/flora_fauna/ff_kingdomspp/monera.htm)<br /><br />The heavier decomposing organic materials drop to the bottom of the water column and end up within the sediments. You have probably been aware of their decomposition if you have ever smelled a rotten egg aroma near the tidal flats and the marshes at low tide. This is hydrogen sulfide, a by-product of the decomposition process in sediments with little or no oxygen. To live in such an environment decomposer bacteria must have anaerobic metabolisms to digest the organic material. In the same way we breathe oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide, anaerobic decomposers inhale sulfate and exhale this hydrogen sulfide.<br /><br /><br />In regard to local waters: The low-tide smell is due to the decomposition of organic matter. This is scientific FACT.<br /><br />It’s particularly bad in Flushing Bay because of pollution, including run-off and that the airport runways restrict the natural tidal action that would ‘flush’ out toxins.<br /><br />The sewage treatment plants, at Bowery Bay and on Ward&#039;s Island across from Astoria Park, add to the smell, but as you say they&#039;ve been there for more than 70 years and it&#039;s something residents of Ditmars, and Ditmars is the main area of Astoria that&#039;s affected, either have adjusted to or have to adjust to because s___ stinks, even when it&#039;s being treated.<br /><br />The recent problems at the Bowery Bay plant, which intensified the odor, have been fix (supposedly).<br /><br /><br /><br />

Why wouldn&#039;t you want the neighborhood you live in to not smell like human feces? Why wouldn&#039;t you want fresh air in your neighborhood? You are right.....we do live in New York, one of the most amazing cities on the planet, and yet we smell Sh*t all day. Doesn&#039;t that concern you? Shouldn&#039;t we have the best of everything.<br /><br />Perhaps you enjoy the smell, or don&#039;t care that your children (if you have any) are inhalling potentially harmful air. I on the other hand am fed up with it. I am not concerned with the new menu at a new restaurant on Ditmars. I am not concerned with how much a gym membership at the Rock is. I am truly and deeply concerned with the wellbeing of both my family and this neighborhood as a whole.<br /><br />I once again called Vallone&#039;s office and complained about the smell. This led to him sending another letter to the head of the EPA requesting they complete the sewage treatment plant. Apparently there was a fire back in 2006 that destroyed the boilers that clean the sludge as well as the domes that cover the pools. This is why we are smelling it everyday. They haven&#039;t replaced the domes. Although I appreciate another letter being sent by Vallone, I just don&#039;t understand why it took a &quot;complaining constituent&quot; to get that letter in the mail? Regardless, I do appreciate the effort and expect the EPA to respond in a manner that is both timely and efficient. I will follow up with Vallone&#039;s office and post the findings. Please call and complain as well. Ask for a copy of the letter. Make complaint calls to the EPA. Get involved.

				Check out a thread from a few years ago. Was similar letter was sent to Gianaris (who is supposed to replace Vallone)? Why don&#039;t you contact him and find out about follow up (or lack there of). Maybe he will tell you what he says about just about anything: its Con Edison&#039;s fault (without admitting that instead of doing something to head off those problems, his contact with them amounted to recieving grants for a school garden and that they make swell opponents at softball) !<br /><br />You can either come to grips with problems, or just put your mind on automatic pilot and parrot what you&#039;ve been told - or remain mute and stick your head in the ground. But you cannot change what will happen around you. Like the commercial says, life comes at you.<br /><br />Certainly the lack of interest (or should we say avoidance) of discussing issues that impact our community is glaring, but don&#039;t worry, other people aren&#039;t so shy. Astoria is getting quite the reputation. Developers do rush in where there is a vacuum.<br />&nbsp;<br />Its ok to set up a relief fund for Katrina. Dozens of our neighbors thrown out on the street from a real estate scam? Yawn. <br /><br />Some yo yo thinks that adding thousands of apartments are great in an upzoning that will be disastorous. Lets talk about a female football player at LIC High School. Amazing. <br />&nbsp;<br />As someone posted on this board recently, they don&#039;t see much problems in Astoria. And our little community gave them a pass. <br /><br />Now, please don&#039;t trouble us with thinking. How would you like to set up the deck chairs on the Titanic? As someone said, do we have to talk about s*ht? Its just so unpleasant.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Its a huge issue, one that spans back years with no end in sight. Your recent post makes me feel that there is no found hope in our cause. If you can ask everyone you know to call Vallone&#039;s office and complain and ask for the copy of the letter he sent. Ask him to resend it to someone who can actually fix the problem. Here is his office&#039;s number. 718-274-4500 . If anyone knows how to submit something like this to Shame on You, or one of those TV News programs, please do it. If you don&#039;t want to, let me know how and I will do it. I am going to scan the letter that was sent from Vallone&#039;s office to the EPA tomorrow and post it if I can.<br /><br />For those of you who don&#039;t smell it, please take a walk down to 20th avenue anywhere between Hazen street and 31st street. I appreciate any help that you guys can provide. Obviously, the two men elected to provide services to this neighborhood and us, are incapable of doing so. I highly suggest that come reelection, you vote for anyone besides them. I know I do everytime.<br /><br />Thanks everyone!

				I have been following this thread and was going to post about the problem, but didn&#039;t know enough to actually put something together.&nbsp; Then NY1 had this great piece and it turns out that there is a problem at the plant that needs to be fixed.<br /><br />Now everyone on here who actually had the audacity to tell those who live in the vicinity that this is NYC and you should &quot;expect&quot; the air to smell like excrement, or those who said others are to blame because they chose to live blocks from a sewage treatment plant look like complete freakin&#039; morons.<br /><br />This is a major part of what&#039;s wrong with Queens.&nbsp; People who speak up about the most obvious thing to be outraged about are lambasted by those who prefer to pretend that everything is just hunky-dory, and the politicians and lobbyists feed off that passiveness.&nbsp; Thus, the vicious cycle of getting screwed time and again.

That smell you are inhaling all day, everyday, is human waste from the Bowery Bay Sewage Treatment plant located near 19th avenue and 46th street. I don&#039;t know about you, but I cannot keep my windows open during the day because if I do, when I get home, my apartment will smell like I have a backed up toilet. This is a serious health hazard that needs to be attended to immediately. If the city can put up two unnecessary new baseball stadiums in less than a year, they can certainly resolve a simple problem that is affecting the lives of so many hard working citizens.<br /><br />I have called Vallone&#039;s office to complain about the smell of human feces that is destroying the air quality in our neighborhood. His secretary, Anne, is writing a letter to the Bowery Bay sewage treatment plant to ask them the status of the repairs of the domes. The domes that usually cover the pools of human waste, are damaged and some are alltogether missing. This is the reason the fumes of your neighbors toilet messes are wafting into your windows. If you enjoy smelling human excrement everyday, then don&#039;t do anything. If you value your health and quality of life here in Astoria, please do your part. Call up Vallone&#039;s office, 718-274-4500, make a complaint. They seem to be willing to write a letter to the Bowery Bay on our behave. Call up the News and ask them to do a story on it. Call 311 and complain. Do something!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I smell it. I have been cleaning it up as well, due to the recent onslaught, the last few years, of so-called&nbsp; &#039;homeless&#039;, often violent and&nbsp; nasty, who actually do defecate, behind stores. It&#039;s&nbsp; all over the place. I complain, and the situation is just getting worse. Lived here as a child, when it was beautful, left&nbsp; for&nbsp; a few years, came back, and discovered&nbsp; Astoria&nbsp; is&nbsp; now part of Manhattan. Sure, I complain, but,&nbsp; the truth is the area has changed&nbsp; forever. We can thank&nbsp; the greedy real estate&nbsp; and landlords in this area.

Didn&#039;t do anything though because the noise went on the whole night....alright back on topic.<br /><br />Thanks to Gleason I think for posting the video link. I am disgusted that they have a completed date of 2012 for the sewage treatment plant!!! They can put two brand new baseball stadiums up in 8 months, but this sewage treatment plant is taking 5 years to complete!?!??! I love how Vallone accepts this as a reasonable timetable.

				I noticed this smell the last few days as well. It seems to be pretty strong. I thought it was a dirty diaper in my house, but I realized this smell seemed to be following me everywhere I went, so I checked my shoes. SHoes are clean, so it must be something in the air.

				My path home, via car, takes me past World&#039;s Fair Marina on the GCP, where I promptly roll up my windows and close my vents. That smell has been determined to be low-tide, but I&#039;m sure LGA isn&#039;t helping. (On a side note, has anyone ever been to the restaurant? How do they handle low-tide?) From there, I take Exit 5, and head north on 81st St, which curves around and becomes 19th Ave. At that point the smell returns. I can&#039;t decide if the smell in this area is the tide, the treatment plant, or both. Those kids who play ball at the ElmJack fields must have cauterized sinuses, and I can only imagine with Rikers smells like at low-tide. From there, I often stop at the Best Yet supermarket on 37th St btw 20th and 19th Ave&#039;s. Most days when I get out of the car I am hit with the treatment plant smell. You can practically taste it, almost ashy in your mouth kind of smell. I&#039;ve smelled the treatment plant all the way by my apartment near Astoria Park. (Though that may be treatment plants on Wards/Randall?) I&#039;ve been woken up by it.

				I lived on Crescent between 21st and Ditmars for 3 years and even there we occasionally got some whiffs, although I didn&#039;t really know what I was smelling. At first, I thought a neighbor&#039;s sewage tank was backed up. But this past summer, especially during July and August, there were some nights when I would be in the bedroom, windows open and then all of a sudden...it smelled like someone had come into the room and taken a crap. Seriously. I remember distinctly one time laughing so hard because of the ridiculous intensity of the stench and I yelled to my boyfriend in the other room &quot;HELP! It smells like sh*t in here! Help!!&quot; and he came in laughing, wondering what kinda joke I was having on him and the second he came in his face turned sour, we shut all the windows and lit 2 sticks of incense. And that was over on crescent street. I can&#039;t imagine what its like living closer...It&#039;s a real quality of life issue.

				i smelled it for the first time a few days ago.&nbsp; was around ditmars and the high 20&#039;s to the low 30&#039;s.&nbsp; it is not the smell of human feces, it is sulfur.&nbsp; i have no idea where it could be coming from, could be carried on the wind from somewhere beyond astoria. it comes and goes in a flash, one minute everything is fine, then a second later its HEAVY, the maybe 15-20 seconds later, it dissappears in a snap.&nbsp; it is definately not a pleasent smell, but if it were human feces, it would be alot worse..

				This problem has been going on for so long why hasn&#039;t someone somewhere used the technology available today to analyse particles in the air to find out what is causing the smell? How long would it take to fix if it was in the Mayor&#039;s neighborhood and he was breathing it. Ridiculous.

				Please tell me that you all smell the sewage these last few days. It is so disgusting I can&#039;t take it anymore. I am finally moving out of Astoria because of it. I want to let you know that the fire at the sewage treatment plant on Berrian Blvd that started this whole situation happened in 2004!!!!!!!! I am bad at math, but I do know that was 6 years ago!!!! The city hasn&#039;t fixed it in 6 years, and the smell is evidence of that. If you smell Human s___ on a daily basis, please do something about it. Call up Peter Vallone&#039;s Office @ 718-274-4500. You don&#039;t have to give you name or even spend any time. Just please let them know that we smell the smell and that they HAVE to fix the issue. I am tired of keeping my windows closed. This is NYC...not a third world nation. Our neighborhood deserves clean smelling air. Please do your part. Just give a call and make them aware. Ask them what they are doing. I am currently in contact with another reporter. I am asking her to write another article. If anyone has connections with news channels, use them. It&#039;s time we breath a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />Thanks for all your help,<br />

				Walking home from work last night....walking to work this morning. It&#039;s beyond disgusting. Please call Vallone&#039;s office and put a complaint in. 718-274-4500. Call 311 and put in a complaint. Please do something to help protect our health. The reason this neighborhood has 7 power plants, a prison, an airport, and sewage treatment plants is because nobody every stands up and says no. Just make a simple phone call.<br /><br />Thanks!!!!

Its unreal that he gets payed to &quot;represent us&quot;. He actually told me, in writing (on the internet), that if I don&#039;t like Astoria and the mismanagement of it, I should leave. That is exactly what I did. No more of this place. Doesn&#039;t matter anyway. It is being overrun by masses of Arabs who don&#039;t want anyone else around them. 5 years, and this neighborhood will be one big mosque. They will push us all out. Say goodbye Astoria.

				My, my, what isn’t Astoria overrun with these days? It’s Wednesday so someone or something new must best clamoring at the gates. In fact I think I hear a din off in the distance now. Brace yourselves people we’ve been down this road before and you know what’s coming . . . could it be the Greeks, Italians, and assorted other Eurotrash, Muslims, Arabs, Mexicans, gays, lesbians, truck drivers, twenty-something white kids from the Midwest and beyond, hipsters, motorcycle riders, street racers, hyperacusis-afflicted sufferers, lovers, haters, Sk8trs, Starbuck cappuccino drinkers, rosemary thieves, college graduates, the working class, helicopter pilots, drunks, people who read books, bad cops, basement dwllers, urban farmers, druggies, smokers, tokers, vicious dog owners, oops I mean owners of vicious dogs, cross dressers, bell ringers, homeless people, gangs, Trader Joe aficionados&nbsp; – you name it, we have the group, subgroup or sub-subgroup representin’ – and, let’s not split hairs, the bigots and or the racists who love to hate them. <br /><br />Yeah we argue and fight and sometimes someone nearly loses an eye but at least we, even the haters, can take comfort in considering ourselves all proud Astorians and that no one can accuse us of saying our s___ don’t stink.<br /><br /><br />Moderator note: <br />By the way in case you, the general you, not a specific you, haven’t notice we’ve been discussing feces of the human kind and the smell of it for nearly two years now so let’s try to get back on topic.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m going to steer clear of recent conversation that&#039;s getting off-topic... I&#039;m getting increasingly concerned about this poop smell!!<br /><br />I&#039;ve lived in the same apt. near the Ditmars stop for 7 years and never smelled poop this far over until a few weeks ago. And have never known the park to reek the way it has almost every time I&#039;ve gone down there recently.<br /><br />Does anyone know why this might be happening? I really want to know that there&#039;s an explanation, and not that this is what we can expect from now on...<br /><br />I called 311 and reported the smell, thinking that perhaps if there are a lot of complaints something might be done (wishful thinking, I&#039;m sure...). You can leave your name and information if you want, and can get a case # to follow up on the complaint. They wanted an address for the plant, and though there doesn&#039;t seem to be a street name, it&#039;s called the Ward&#039;s Island WPCP.<br /><br />And if anyone has any hard information about this situation, please share!!

				I live on Astoria Park and smelled this last night and have occasionally throughout my 3 years in Astoria. I thought it was the tides and the water. I grew up on Long Island a few blocks from the Great South Bay and would smell something similar occasionally during low tides. I haven&#039;t noticed this smell constantly but haven&#039;t been around all that much.

				I put a call into Vallone&#039;s office today (718-274-4500). Spoke to a guy named Thomas who put me on hold to ask about the issue. He came back on and told me the Councilman &quot;has a call in to the Commissioner.&quot; Oh, yes? Which Commissioner? &quot;Uh, I think, the...DEP.&quot; Right. <br /><br />I told Thomas how bad it&#039;s been lately, how difficult it is to enjoy the park sometimes, especially around Ditmars. He said others have been complaining. I think we should all call his office and keep calling. Doesn&#039;t he himself live near the park? He&#039;s got to do more about this than put in a call. If only this were a grafitti problem.

				I grew up on the Air Force base in Dover, DE... located next to a swampy/marsh area known as St. Jones.&nbsp; The morning air was frequently filled with an &quot;eggy&quot; smell that came from the marsh.&nbsp; Typically this was due to an environmental imbalance, and although it was possible for the local government to address this environmental issue and not only kill the smell but help create a healthier ecosystem, we all just got use to the smell and did nothing about it.<br /><br />I&#039;ve smelled the eau de poo wafting about Ditmars and although my childhood experiences with odd smells makes me feel a little desensitized to this issue, knowing that this is a man-made/industrial issue and not just an ecological imbalance makes me wonder why more isn&#039;t being done to rectify the cause.<br /><br />It&#039;s a form of pollution, regulated or not, and needs to be addressed.&nbsp; For those that live closer to the smell, attempting to either open a window or use an a/c unit bascially makes your entire apartment smell like a port-o-potty.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t seen much media attention given to this, so maybe the next step is to try to involve them.&nbsp; Especially if Vallone&#039;s response smells like a load of fresh Astoria air.

				Does everyone still have their head in the sand hoping that one day it won&#039;t smell? Even media coverage doesn&#039;t help.<br /><br />http://queenscrap.blogspot.com/2008/10/why-astoria-smells-like-crap.html (http://queenscrap.blogspot.com/2008/10/why-astoria-smells-like-crap.html)<br /><br /><br />How much more does astoria have to put up with?<br /><br />Have you noticed they built another two smokestacks at the powerplant behing Steinway Piano Factory? STOP VOTING FOR VALLONE!!!!! He is lining his pockets while you and your families suffer the consequences. He should be dragged out into the street and beaten.

				So I am a bit confused as to the origin of this smell.&nbsp; <br /><br />Most people in this thread say it gets worse as you near Astoria Park.&nbsp; However, from the article linked above it lists the source as: Bowery Bay Waste Treatment Facility.&nbsp; Now this place is not near Astoria park...<br />

				This is definitely not low tide, unless there&#039;s been a breach at the water treatment plant and the tide is full of crap :)<br /><br />I don&#039;t smell it at the south end of the park, but at times at the end of the park near Ditmars it can be enough to make you gag. Directly across the river from that spot is the Ward&#039;s Island water treatment facility, so it seems a good bet that the smell comes from there. And I&#039;m smelling it on the breeze coming through my west-facing windows right now (I&#039;m on 33rd St. &amp; 23rd Ave.)<br /><br />The previous reports did refer to smells coming from the Bowery Bay facility, but this time I think it&#039;s the Ward&#039;s island plant. Though that&#039;s a pretty long way for the stink to drift, that&#039;s where the evidence points...

				Although I tend to be a bit blase about smells, this one got me the past few mornings.&nbsp; I jog by the river and it is definetely there - I had to put a tissue over my nose the other day.&nbsp; It is getting worse and worse.<br /><br />I think it would benefit our local politicians to wake up and realize that Astoria is no longer filled with people like my parents, who would simply accept everything because they did not know how to change the system.<br /><br />Wake up community leaders - we may want to get rid of you during the next election cycle!

				Wind from the North = The Stink is from the Bowery Bay plant<br /><br />Wind from the West = The Stink is from the Ward&#039;s Island plant.

				Wherever it&#039;s coming from shouldn&#039;t Vallone--or his <em>people</em>--be aware of it? They could hardly give me any information at all. Amazing and pathetic. So, Pete--is this still about the fire that happened over at Bowery Bay Plant 4 or 5 years ago or is it the Ward&#039;s Island plant? Has the &quot;commissioner&quot; returned your call yet? <br /><br />Maybe we should call Maloney or even Schumer&#039;s office. Peter&#039;s practicing his bass I think.
