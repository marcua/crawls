				So, with the rising costs of everything these days, are you making a deliberate attempt to cut back on groceries?&nbsp; :| Have you changed your habits, or are you more conscious of what you&#039;re spending your money on? Do you plan more or are you &quot;shopping by the seat of your pants&quot; on a weekly basis? What are your aerage costs per week/month? Things like a few misc. household items, included. Are there things you consider as indulgences that are nonnegotiable on a weekly basis? Have you cut back on organic anything? Do you think you&#039;ll keep these habits once our economy improves or is this a temporary setback for the way you eat? (Or maybe you&#039;re cutting back elsewhere in your life—drinks out, movies, etc..?)<br /><br />I&#039;m finding that keeping my protein down and making a few things for the week that alternate between lunches and dinners for two people, with only a few occasional take outs/per week (1-3), our grocery bill per month now is pretty reasonable. I&#039;ve been making soup, sandwiches, grains and veggies to mix with salad or as sides, and a protein for 1-2/day; surprisingly I haven&#039;t been bored yet.

				My boyfriend and I usually go to the store one to three times a week to pick up things for dinner to the tune of $20-$30 each time. We&#039;ll get beer, stuff for the next few days, just a couple of things.<br /><br />We&#039;re both very lucky, though, because both of our industries are doing well, for the moment and we haven&#039;t had to make any cut backs.

				My&nbsp; boyfriend and I have been trying to actively cut back for a few months, before all the economic hubbub started up, because we just felt we were spending too much on food and wanted to save for bigger future plans. We dropped our spending by almost $300 the first month we paid attention to it. <br /><br />For a while we were planning meals by the week and shopping once, with one more trip for fresh produce, meat and milk, which was the cheapest month we&#039;ve ever had. We&#039;ve been trying to get back to it but have been too busy lately to do it regularly. <br /><br />I&#039;d say we&#039;re now spending a little more than $100 per week for both of us. We could probably cut back a little more.

				I spend between 40-60 for two people, but that doesn&#039;t include 3-4 meals. We both eat cereal and make sandwiches for lunches during the week. I look at the sale fliers from the local grocery stores and buy whatever meat is on sale and plan my meals around the sales. It&#039;s been working out really well.

				I&#039;ve been living on a fixed income for almost 10 years. So, I have learned to budget myself. I have changed to some less-expensive brands on non-perishable grocery items, but other than that, I always buy only what I need. Plus, I&#039;ve learned that the more time I spend in a supermarket, the more I spend. So, once a month, I do a HUGE shopping, and have it delivered. Then when I have to go to the market, I go with a list and only buy the fill-in items that I need. They usually consist of dairy and green grocer items. I&#039;ve become the queen of 1001 things to do with ground beef or chicken. I also take advantage of my rather large freezer and my big pots to cook for any army and freeze leftovers. I&#039;ve also become an avid fan of coupons. I run around the internet and collect coupons for all the products I use. I go to the manufacturers sites. The only store that won&#039;t take computer-printed coupons is Trade Fair, so now I avoid them unless they have a really good sale on a specific item I use and then I only buy that from them. I very rarely order take out—or for that matter—eat out. <br /><br />And if every now and then, I get a craving for something special, I budget it in by not buying something else. That way I try to keep myself from feeling deprived.

				Ironically, my cutting back had nothing to do with the souring economy. One day I looked at my bank account balance and said &quot;Holy crap, what have I been spending all my money on?&quot;<br /><br />After checking my bank history and making a budget of my expenses, it turned out I was taking out $200 every 5 days like clockwork for going out to bars, movies and restaurants/takeout and breakfast/lunches at work. It turns out I was spending over a thousand dollars a month on those things which were all completely unnecessary.<br /><br />I went into frugal mode about a month ago and have been sticking with it well. Bought stuff for breakfasts/lunches/dinners, buy beer at the grocery store as opposed to bars now (and have seriously cut back on drinking in general). Order out _maybe_ once a week but only when it&#039;s with someone else. <br /><br />I buy a lot of frozen and canned stuff because I hate buying stuff that will go bad on me. Bread, milk being the only exceptions. I&#039;ve found I can live ridiculously frugally (albeit not the healthiest...the soups are ok, but have a high salt content). I spent about $130 on groceries at the beginning of this week. I honestly expect those groceries to feed me for a month.<br /><br />I saved a ridiculous amount of money last month by doing this, I hope that I can keep it up. But I had a LOT of areas I could easily cut back on. I went from being a super extrovert going out all the time to being a homebody. The fact that I found hulu.com and found something that I really wanted to learn (web design) which takes up all my time has really helped with the lifestyle change.

				Canned soup is disgusting with all the salt they put inside to keep it &quot;fresh&quot; . I find trade fair has some of the best prices around so i usually go there . Sometimes best yet , down the block&nbsp; and because of their huge parking lot is ok too .&nbsp; Last week i bought chicken cutlets and because they had the stick &quot;halal&quot; on it , they were marked down i was told .&nbsp; They had a big inventory on these items due to a big muslim holiday . Well they were going for $1.99 a lb. for the family pack .&nbsp; SOLD!&nbsp; &nbsp;Reg&nbsp; prices are $4.99 a lb for chicken cutlets, so huge difference there . Buying whats on sale&nbsp; , especially if u plan to buy for the week or month&nbsp; , u can save a ton of money which in the end really adds up .&nbsp; It makes sense to remember prices ,if not to write them down .

				I spend about $30-$40 a week on groceries, with an additional every other month big shopping event with the granny cart or a friend&#039;s car to Best Yet or Key Food to stock up on canned goods, meat, non-perishables, big items, etc.&nbsp; These days, I clip out coupons regularly and read the circulars for sales.&nbsp; I plan what to shop for and where.&nbsp; The best deals are sometimes found at the drugstore.&nbsp; Rite Aid has great sales on cereal, CVS on ice cream, you can also find good deals on vitamins, granola bars, laundry detergent, and shampoo just by studying the circulars.&nbsp; &nbsp;Take advantage of rewards programs at CVS and Duane Reade (and practically every other store) and you&#039;ll get coupons all the time.&nbsp; All the stores have their own savings cards too.&nbsp; I don&#039;t eat out as much as I used to, and try and bring my lunch to work.&nbsp; I always hear the excuse that people don&#039;t have time to make their lunch but all it takes is an extra five minutes, or you can do it the night before.&nbsp; I only shop for myself so I save leftovers for the next day or freeze them.&nbsp; Fruits and veggies are often cheaper at the stands all over Astoria instead of the grocery store.&nbsp; &nbsp;Rite Aid has a good rebate program as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;Tip for Key Food - their self check out machines are often wrong so pay attention to the prices, I&#039;ve had to get the clerk to manually enter the price on many an occasion.&nbsp; I have to wonder what the checkout clerk&#039;s machines get away with.

				The Key Food at Ditmars has always been shady with pricing.&nbsp; &nbsp;A couple of weeks back I got into a dispute with the clerk who was telling me that the 2 litre bottles of Coke products weren&#039;t 89 cents as advertised but actually $1.89.&nbsp; I finally had to get the manager involved because the woman was accusing me of lying.

				Trade fair on ditmars also does this alot&nbsp; and even though it may only be cents or sometimes 1 dollar, why should we have to pay extra for something thats already so expensive .&nbsp; The cents&nbsp; they make off each customer who might be not knowing im sure is huge . <br /><br />I bought two 3-liter bottles of coke for 3 dollars and they charged me&nbsp; 4 dollars total . Then i was charged for 5 bagels instead of 4 in the plastic bag ... charged wrong for yogurt&nbsp; all in the same day . They punch it up so fast&nbsp; that u can barely see what is there , so i usually stand with my receipt and see whats on it before i make a u-turn and back to the cashier .&nbsp; If items are marked less on the shelf and then they tell u its a mistake or the item isnt onsale anymore, by law they have to give u the marked price . This happend to me with&nbsp; dog food and it was an 8 dollar difference .

				Best Yet also does this as well...almost every time I shop there, there&#039;s at least one or two mistakes on my receipt where I&#039;ve been overcharged for something compared to the ticket price or the sale price.&nbsp; It really is important to pay close attention to prices on the shelf and in the circulars, and to check your receipt thoroughly after paying.<br /><br />Paying close attention to prices also means that you&#039;ll be able to easily compare store-to-store, and I really have noticed some vast differences on some items, particularly produce.&nbsp; Stores like Key Food and PathMark, for instance, are almost always *very* expensive in the produce department compared to, say, Best Yet or Berry Fresh Farm or Trade Fair, and of course, many of the fruit markets.

				I love the recipes that come on Goya product packages. They&#039;re usually very cheap and easy to make, along with being practical. Last week I made a bulgar pilaf w/cheese, off the back of a package of Goya bulgar, and I already had everything in my fridge aside from an onion, a small can of tomatoes, and shredded mozzarella. It made four servings, and it was also very easy to modify if you like it spicy or want some meat in it. And I still have a ton of bulgar left.<br /><br />I&#039;ve gotten way into frozen vegetables too. I like them not only because they don&#039;t go bad, but because I can leave them in there indefinitely and can turn to them when I don&#039;t know what to cook and just want to throw something together without having to go to the store. I&#039;m rarely ordering takeout anymore, so stuff like this makes it easier for me to stick to that. You can get frozen organic vegetables pretty cheap at Whole Foods.<br /><br />As for making soups, I got one of those Bean Cuisine soup mix things from Key Food because it intrigued me. It says it makes 16 servings of soup... so that&#039;s gonna be a lot of soup when I get around to that. Most of the ingredients can be bought cheap at Top Tomato or Trade Fair.<br /><br />All this is not so much because of the economy but because I&#039;m on a very limited income by choice, only working part time. If I was still at my old job, I&#039;d probably be spending the same way I was before. I&#039;ve never been a huge spender though (having a minimal social life and a very tiny bedroom will do that- I have no room for more &quot;things&quot; here - plus my kitchen is shared with two roommates which limits the amount of food I can buy). My main cutback has been cooking and making my own coffee instead of getting takeout, but that&#039;s also because I now have time to do those things. I have really been trying to get the most out of things I already have instead of just buying new things, trying new products, clothes, etc.

I&#039;ve only been to C-Town once, but I just looked at their circular and they have some nice sale items. <br /><br />In the cold weather I don&#039;t mind going to 3–4 stores to pick up some things. Keeping purchases in my trunk until I get home is sometimes faster than getting a delivery. This way I can buy on-sale chicken at one store and on-sale beef at another. I especially love finding ice cream on sale during the winter. I can stock my freezer and not have it all melted by the time I get it home! (Didja see those Häagen-Dazs bars on sale for $2.99?) YIPPEE!

				Thanks for the links, they are great. I am also an avid coupon clipper and I think that Stop and Shop doubles coupons up to one dollar. I have started bringing my bags and returning my cans and bottles, which saves a very small amount in each shopping trip. I buy chicken and other meats in large packages when they are on sale and usually break up the packages and freeze so I can cook later. I buy my veggies and fruit at the bodegas and fruit markets around Astoria because I find the supermarkets to be more expensive. I also buy some products in bulk. I eat gluten-free due to Celiac Disease so it is often cheaper for me to buy a case of one product&nbsp; online rather than pick it up at the local health food stores. The only problem with that is the lack of space to store the items.

				Wow, those links were very helpful, thanks!<br /><br />Not only do I check out grocery stores for deals, but sometimes drugstores (rite aid, CVS) run deals on dry goods&nbsp; (like baking soda, salt, soft drinks, cereals) and if you pop in for your prescriptions or what not, it&#039;s a good idea to check out the food aisles to see what&#039;s on sale. I&#039;ve bought things there for really cheap. <br /><br />I try to stick to a budget but then end up blowing $20 bucks on imported Parma ham.. I need an intervention :P
