				(This is not a forwarding endorsement. Nor agreement with views and issues noted.<br />My appreciation is simply for elected officials who share updates with neighbors.)<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney&#39;s E-Newsletter February 23, 2006<br />Volume III: Edition III<br />Dear neighbors, <br />Congress has hit the ground running in 2006. Between the State of the Union, the push for lobbying reform and the various budget debates, the beginning of this year is shaping up to be an active and important one.<br /><br />In this E-Newsletter:<br />Oil and Gas Companies Shortchanging Taxpayers <br />Federal Czar Needed for 9/11 Health Crisis <br />Cleaning Up Corruption in Congress <br />The Wrong Budget Priorities <br />Workers’ Wages Losing Out to Inflation<br /><br />Oil and Gas Companies Shortchanging Taxpayers<br />This winter, American families are paying record high prices for gas to heat their homes. Unfortunately, we recently found out that oil and gas companies at the same time are skipping out on paying the bill they owe American taxpayers.<br />These companies owe taxpayers royalties for drilling on government-owned land. As The New York Times first reported, the companies are hiding behind a complex set of regulations in order to pay lower royalties on natural gas than they should rightfully owe. This is completely unfair for taxpayers and is especially distasteful after a year of record profits for the oil industry.<br />A number of colleagues joined me in calling for Congressional hearings on this issue. The oil and gas companies must answer questions about their practices, and Congress should take appropriate action to make sure they aren’t repeated.<br /><br />Federal Czar Needed for 9/11 Health Crisis <br />More than four years after 9/11, health problems persist for thousands of responders and residents who spent time in the toxic soup of Ground Zero – and in many cases, those problems are worsening. You may have read or seen recent news reports about some of these heroes who have passed away in the past few months. It is an incredibly sad situation that deserves much more attention from the federal government.<br />Ever since 9/11, I have worked to alert members of the administration to the 9/11 health issue with in order to get proper federal support for medical monitoring and health treatment programs. To this point, the support has been inadequate. For that reason, Rep. Vito Fossella (R-Staten Island) and I recently called for the creation of a 9/11 Health Czar within the federal government to coordinate and implement the federal response to this health crisis.<br />Marvin Bethea, a paramedic who has experienced numerous ailments since responding to 9/11, sat in the balcony at the State of the Union as my guest. He was there to represent the thousands of heroes still sick and injured and to again make the case for a better federal response. “We will never forget” is a moto that our government should honor.<br /><br />Cleaning up Corruption in Congress <br />The Jack Abramoff scandal has brought to light for many Americans the unseemly ties between special interest lobbyists, their money and some Members of Congress. It is clear that reform is a necessity. I proudly signed the Democratic Declaration, with a goal “to restore accountability, honesty and openness at all levels of government.” And I have co-sponsored our legislation to crack down on corruption in Congress. Among other actions, this bill would: ban gifts and travel from lobbyists, slow the revolving door that allows Members of Congress to immediately become lobbyists after leaving office, and prohibit the practice of sneaking special interest provisions into legislation in the dead of the night, just before the legislation comes up for a vote.<br /><br />The Wrong Budget Priorities<br />One of the first actions Congress took when we returned to Washington this year was to narrowly pass a budget bill that, sadly, will reduce assistance Americans who need help the most. The legislation slashes $28.3 billion for Medicaid over the next 10 years. It increases the costs of college loans and forces students to pay excessive interest rates. And it cuts $8.4 billion from child support collections.<br />At the urging of the drug companies and HMOs, changes in the legislation were made to save those industries $42 billion, leaving behind those who rely on Medicaid.<br />Ironically, the majority titled this bill the Deficit Reduction Act – even though it is part of a budget package that will increase the deficit by $17 billion over the next five years. Only in Washington.<br /><br />Workers’ Wages Losing Out to Inflation<br />As the senior House Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee, I review all of the economic statistics our government produces to gauge the state of our economy. Unfortunately, the latest report on real wages – workers wages adjusted for inflation – is not promising. In 2005, the average hourly wage for the American worker, when adjusted for inflation, fell by 0.5 percent.<br />This means that even though American workers are producing more and working harder, they are taking home less. Middle-class and working-class Americans are, to an extent, being left behind in the economic recovery we have undergone over the past few years, but it should not be that way.<br /><br />Please feel free to share this email with anyone that may be interested in these issues. As always, I appreciate your comments and invite you to write to me through my website. <br />Sincerely,<br />CAROLYN B. MALONEY<br />Member of Congress <br />P.S.

				(Ye olde artists were remarkable.)<br />***<br /><br />http://www.dfnyc.org/cms/node/87472<br /><br /><br />&quot;<br />Come join us at Cinema Classics (332 E. 11th St, btwn 1st &amp; 2nd ave.) on Sunday, February 26 at 8pm for a screening of Harriette Draper&#39;s Documentary Take it Back. There&#39;s an optional donation to DFA of 10 bucks at the door if you can swing it.<br /><br />In January 2004 the eyes of the country were focused on Iowa as many of the nine Democratic presidential candidates gathered for the famous Iowa Caucuses. To everyone’s surprise the front runner was Howard Dean, a name that nine months earlier was virtually unknown. Suddenly, this doctor and six term governor from the rural state of Vermont was poised to lead the challenge against George W. Bush. Many forces, threatened by his populist support, joined together to defeat him.<br /><br />Take It Back tells the story of one of the most extraordinary political campaigns in recent American history. Made by documentary filmmaker Heidi (Harriette) Draper, the film gives us a grassroots view of the forces that propelled Dean ahead of Democratic Party heavyweights John Kerry and Dick Gephardt, as well as the forces that brought Dean’s meteoric rise to an abrupt halt.<br /><br />The film takes us into the eye of what was called ‘The Perfect Storm’ when thousands of Dean volunteers traveled to Iowa from around the country to help their candidate win the crucial first primary. With great humor and poignancy, ‘Take It Back’ follows several of the unforgettable characters who helped lift Dean into the national spotlight, and shows us, from the ground up, their hopes, their frustrations, and their determination to recreate the America of their vision, despite constant setbacks. We are inspired by them to continue to play a part in the movement to take back America.<br /><br />&quot;<br /><br /><br />

Maloney, Murtha Hold Town Hall on Iraq War&nbsp; <br />NEW YORK, NY - Today, U.S. Reps. Carolyn Maloney (D-Manhattan, Queens) and John Murtha (D-PA) convened a town hall meeting on the Iraq war. The event, which was held at the Community Church of New York Unitarian Universalist in Manhattan, gave New Yorkers the opportunity to ask questions about the war and to hear Rep. Murtha, one of the leading experts on military affairs in Congress, discuss his proposal to bring our troops home from Iraq as soon as is practicable. <br /><br />Congressman Murtha has proposed a three-step plan to make fundamental changes in the direction of our country&#39;s Iraq policy: redeploy our troops from Iraq; reallocate the money we would otherwise spend in Iraq to pressing security needs here at home; and re-engage with the world in the fight against terrorism.<br /><br />&quot;There is no greater champion in Congress for our fighting men and women than Representative Murtha,&quot; said Congresswoman Maloney. &quot;He has spoken from his heart to the American people, his fellow elected representatives, and the President himself that America&#39;s current policy in Iraq is flawed and it&#39;s time to make the tough decisions to get it right. This is a time of great anxiety, especially for the families of soldiers serving our country thousands of miles from home, in an unfamiliar and often hostile land. To these military families, I would say, simply, that it is time for your sons and daughters to finally come home.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;The President is using fear to keep our troops in Iraq - fear of what might happen if we leave,&quot; said Congressman Murtha. &quot;He is saying we should have an open-ended commitment to stay in Iraq, yet he has NO plan. His plan is to cross his fingers and hope that the Iraqis will form a unity government. But hope is not a plan. And for as long as he continues down this vague, open-ended path, more American lives will be lost, and billions of more dollars will be spent. It is time to change direction. We should fear only our failure to change. Iraq today is not stable and is not safe. The Iraqis must decide that stability and safety are worth fighting for. An all-out effort must be made by the Iraqis to solve the problems and challenges that are facing them.&quot; <br /><br />Rep. Murtha authored -and Rep. Maloney co-sponsored- House Joint Resolution 73, which calls for the redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq. <br /><br />###<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />http://maloney.house.gov/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney&#39;s E-Newsletter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />May 19, 2006 - Volume III Edition VI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Dear Friends,<br />In my latest update, I have news to report both from Washington and from right here in New York, where we have seen more progress on some vital issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />In this E-Newsletter:<br />Rep.

Murtha Joins Town Hall Discussion on Iraq<br />I very much appreciated seeing so many of you at my recent town hall meeting on an issue that is so imporant to New Yorkers and Americans: Iraq. We were very fortunate to be joined by my dear friend, Rep. John Murtha of Pennsylvania. He is a war hero, a longtime champion of the military, and one of the boldest and most sensible critics of the handling of the Iraq War. His wisdom and experience contributed greatly to our discussion. <br />This war, which was sold to Congress and the American people using false information, has become an occupation with no end in sight. Our government should focus on getting our troops out of Iraq as soon as is practicable. That is exactly the goal of Rep. Murtha&#39;s resolution, introduced in late 2005, which I fully support. As a member of the Out of Iraq Caucus, I have consistently pushed for greater accountability for our country&#39;s operations in Iraq, and I believe a change in policy is long overdue. Many who attended the town hall meeting voiced their agreement. <br /><br />Read more about my Iraq Town Hall &gt; <br />Read more about my postition on Iraq &gt; <br /><br />Developments on 9/11 Health Crisis - One Sad, One Encouraging <br />Recently, we received the somber confirmation that the toxic soup at Ground Zero in the days and weeks after 9/11 is responsible for killing our 9/11 heroes. The autopsy of NYPD Detective James Zadroga, who died in January, officially confirmed that his cause of death was illness developed from the Ground Zero toxins. This is the first official medical confirmation linking a death to the air around Ground Zero. Though it is no surprise to most New Yorkers, who have seen the health of thousands of responders and lower Manhattan residents deteriorate since 9/11, it signals to this nation and, most importantly, the federal government that the 9/11 health crisis is something they cannot ignore.<br />On a more positive note, after prodding from Rep. Vito Fossella and me, the Department of Health and Human Services finally appointed a federal 9/11 Health Coordinator, Dr. John Howard, who could be a willing and active partner in trying to help our 9/11 heroes. Late last month, Dr. Howard met with me, Senator Hillary Clinton, Rep. Fossella, Rep. Jerrold Nadler and 40 organizations in Manhattan to discuss the crisis and a possible plan to deal with it. While it is reprehensible that the federal government has taken so long to act, I am hoping that Dr. Howard will finally beef up the federal response to the 9/11 health crisis.<br />Read more about the first official medical confirmation linking a death to Ground Zero &gt; <br />Read more about my meeting with the 9/11 Health Coordinator &gt; <br />Read more about my work on 9/11 Health Issues &gt; <br /><br />Soaring Gas Prices Need Immediate Attention <br />Record high gas prices do not just cause pain at the pump, but also at the grocery store and construction sites - they send ripples throughout our economy. I believe that action is needed to rein in the prices that consumers are forced to pay while the oil industry is reporting record profits. The policy espoused by the president, which includes the temporary withholding of deposits to the strategic oil reserve and the temporary suspension of clean air restrictions, will do little to provide real relief to the consumer or to fix the underlying problem. <br />I am supportive of several sensible proposals in Congress to aid consumers and do something to solve the problem. Most recently, I voted in favor of legislation passed by Congress, The Federal Energy Price Protection Act of 2006, which would prohibit price gouging in the sale of gasoline, diesel fuel, crude oil, and home heating oil. Additionally, I have cosponsored important legislation which would effectively reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil, promote energy independence, build a market for renewable energy, promote conservation and protect the environment. <br />I am also a long-time advocate of reforming the oil royalty system. Currently, oil and gas companies pay a pittance in royalties to the American taxpayer for the oil and gas they extract from our publically-owned land - The New York Times has estimated that we are being shortchanged $7 billion over the next five years. The royalty rules were written largely by the oil industry in the 1990s, when oil cost half as much as it does now. These regulations clearly do not make sense today, and I have worked with colleagues to introduce legislation to correct this problem so that we can use those dollars to fund alternative energy and conservation programs.<br /><br />Read more about legislation to correct the problems &gt; <br />Read more about my work on ending oil industry fraud &gt; <br />Second Avenue Subway Project is Rolling <br />I&#39;m proud to report more significant progress for the Second Avenue Subway: the federal government has now begun the final design phase of the project. Federal government support for the subway is critical, and we continue to receive important federal assistance, both in planning and financially. The subway continues to pass new and important milestones, and this is yet another. <br /><br />Recognizing the Continuing Importance of Equal Pay<br />On April 25, we observed the day when women&#39;s wages catch up with men&#39;s wages from the previous year. Though women have made many advancements over the past few decades, study after study shows that men are paid significantly more for the same work. The latest analysis conducted by the staff of the Joint Economic Committee (of which I am the senior House Democrat) shows that women are paid on average 77 cents to the dollar compared to what men are paid. Previously, I collaborated with my colleague Rep. John Dingell of Michigan to commission a comprehensive Government Accountability Office report that showed that the wage gap has essentially remained unchanged since 1980. <br />These are troubling facts. They show that women are penalized for their dual roles of provider and family caretaker. They also show that the age-old problem of discrimination still pervades the workplace, even in the 21st Century. We need to remember the situation for women in the workplace, not just on April 25, but always, because women live this reality every day of their lives. <br />Read the Joint Economic Committee&#39;s Overview of the Gender Earnings Gap &gt; <br />Read about the GAO&#39;s report showing a persistant Glass Ceiling &gt; <br />Read about my work toward pay equity for women &gt; <br /><br />Wiesenthal Holocaust Education Legislation Introduced in the Senate <br />I am happy to report that legislation to increase education about the Holocaust in our country, which I have sponsored in the House of Representatives (H.R. 4604), has now been also introduced in the Senate. Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey introduced the Simon Wiesenthal Holocaust Education Assistance Act (S. 2651) in April. The legislation would provide government grants to educational institutions to teach about the Holocaust. Many of those programs are currently struggling for resources. It is my hope that doubling our efforts by adding a champion of this bill in the Senate will lead to its eventual passage. <br />Read more about the Simon Wiesenthal Holocaust Education Assistance Act &gt; <br />New Warning About the Grave Dangers of Skin Cancer from Tanning Beds Needed<br />Millions of Americans, mostly women, use tanning beds, but many of them are not adequately informed of the risks associated with indoor tanning. This situation reminds me of years ago, when the dangers of cigarettes were not fully known. We must now ensure that Americans realize that even one time in a tanning bed might cause melanoma. <br />The current FDA warning label for tanning beds is wordy and is often placed on a part of the bed that the customer never sees. I have introduced legislation - the TAN Act (H.R. 4767) - that would direct the FDA to revisit those labels and determine the most effective way to alert tanning bed users that they might increase their risk of cancer by tanning. Since introducing the bill, I have talked with skin cancer victims who were frequent tanning bed users and had no idea about the harms of those beds. Some were even told that tanning beds were healthy. We can save millions of lives if the public knows the facts about skin cancer and tanning.<br />Read more about the TAN Act &gt;<br /><br />Cargo on Airplanes Must Be Screened<br />While airline travelers are thoroughly screened - even made to take off their shoes - there is absolutely no procedure to screen the cargo that rides in the belly of the very same planes we board. This makes no sense. <br />I am a lead cosponsor of Rep. Ed Markey&#39;s legislation to mandate the screening of air cargo, and I held a news conference about the vital need for this bill in April at LaGuardia Airport. Most people still don&#39;t know about this gaping hole in our security system, so it is tremendously important to spread the word. <br />Read more about my call for instpection of all cargo on passenger planes &gt; <br /><br />Intentionally Deceptive Advertising About Family Planning Services Must Be Stopped<br />I am very concerned that women seeking family planning information and options, including abortion, may be the target of some radical anti-abortion organizations that are willing to intentionally deceive pregnant women in an effort to stop them from exercising their reproductive rights. Certainly, many &quot;Crisis Pregnancy Centers&quot; operate honorably, with no intention to deceive, and I respect their right to their own opinions. However, I do believe that action is necessary to crack down on the ones that use intentionally deceptive advertising to lure women who are seeking unbiased information about abortion. <br />I have recently introduced legislation (H.R. 5052, the Stop Deceptive Advertising in Women&#39;s Services Act) that would ask the Federal Trade Commission to prohibit organizations from advertising with the intent to deceive the public that they provide abortion services.
