				Hi,<br /><br />I just thought I&#039;d start a whole new thread about Freeze Peach, the new Freeze Peach that is.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you haven&#039;t been there lately you should drop by.&nbsp; In addition to new tables and chairs, they are now offering panini sandwiches - cubans, ham &amp; cheese and grilled cheese - and their usual fair of 27 teas and a world of coffees. There are also more edibles such as candy bars, biscotti, etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />Starting Sunday there will be new ongoing hours of 10am-11pm seven days.&nbsp; &nbsp;The new partners have a mind to bring in Emack &amp; Bolios so stay tuned.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The address is: 22-00 29th Street, off of Ditmars.&nbsp; Visit the website: www.freezepeach.org for information and updates.<br /><br />

				<br />I dont know if much has changed since last dropping by. FP still seemed fairly familiar.<br />I like the change of tables and chairs.<br /><br /><br />Still think their teas are better than coffees. Astoria and coffee just dont seem to agree with me.<br /><br />I just re-read. Am I seeing things??&nbsp; &nbsp;:-o<br />Are you serious about Emack!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;:evil:<br /><br />

				perhaps off topic, but when did the panini become a required staple of every cafe in astoria? first there was crescent &amp; vine, then oleput revamped to include panini / charcuterie and now freezepeach. don&#039;t get me wrong i love a good sandwich and like the choice but there seems to be a case of keeping up with the johnsons. other threads have discussed the oversaturation of sushi joints but panini is popping up a lot as well.<br /><br />we should all put money in panini press manufacturing companies because the business is really expanding.

				Hi,<br /><br />I&#039;m glad to see there is so much concern about Freeze Peach.&nbsp; Obviously we all care about the place.&nbsp; &nbsp;Panini&#039;s are a new thing they&#039;re trying out.&nbsp; &nbsp;I haven&#039;t personally tried it out yet but may soon.&nbsp; &nbsp;Several people have given them rave reviews though.<br /><br />About Emack &amp; Bolios, they are seriously looking into it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think it&#039;s definately going to happen.&nbsp; &nbsp;Probably around July 1.&nbsp; I&#039;ll post here the minute I see it so stay tuned.<br /><br />I think that Freeze Peach does tea really super well which is probably why it&#039;s my hangout of choice.&nbsp; &nbsp;I maxed out on coffee a while ago and my stomach can&#039;t handle it when I drink even decaf.&nbsp; Somehow it can handle tea.&nbsp; I personally love the Chai&#039;s.&nbsp; &nbsp;The only place I know of that offers Chai without sweetener.&nbsp; Have you ever tried it at Cosi or Starbucks?&nbsp; &nbsp;You might as well order a sugar latte or an iced sugar latte.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m trying to cut out sweeteners so it&#039;s a help but you can also get it with honey at Freeze Peach.<br /><br />Keep watching here for new developments and stop by the cafe to see what&#039;s going on.

				Panini&#039;s are a great way to offer hot food without the added expense of purchasing a restaurant-quality stove and all the issues/expenses that come along with it. That&#039;s my opinion as to why they keep popping up everywhere.

				Dear TheArtistObjective,<br /><br />Please accept my honest opinion about your posts and my suggestion- I think that your posts are doing Freeze Peach harm. People both new to the neighborhood and those who haven&#039;t visited the coffee house will think that your posts are cheesy advertisements, and they are, and I think you should stop posting if you truly support Freeze Peach. It&#039;s mostly the tone...its like you&#039;re wearing a sandwich board sign rather than contributing to the dialogue on the board.&nbsp;

				No, it translates into sandwich, period. And usually, well, a pressed sandwich denotes hot, not cold. <br /><br />pa·ni·no&nbsp; (p-nn)<br />n. pl. pa·ni·ni (-n)<br />An Italian sandwich made usually with vegetables, cheese, and grilled or cured meat.<br />[Short for Italian panino (imbottito), stuffed bread, sandwich : panino, diminutive of pane, bread + imbottito, past participle of imbottire, to stuff.]<br /><br />* from the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language*<br /><br />And this:<br />A Panino is an Italian sandwich using a small loaf of bread, typically ciabatta or foccacia, that is sliced horizontally and filled with cheese such as fontina or provolone, cured meats such as salami or ham, and various vegetables.<br /><br />The sandwiches can be served hot or cold, but in the United States, panini are usually buttered and then grilled in a Panini Press.<br /><br />One sandwich is called a Panino, while multiple sandwiches are called Panini.

				I went to Freeze Peach today and was very disappointed when my iced green tea, which cost $3.50, tasted more like sweetener than tea. My whole reason for going there was I know they have good quality loose teas, and I wanted a good green tea and not a cup of iced sugar water. I wasn&#039;t asked whether or not I wanted it sweetened and I just figured I&#039;d get the tea straight.. was not happy.&nbsp; :-( I was in a hurry to meet someone, so I didn&#039;t want to tell the girl and wait for a new thing to be brewed up. I know in the past that they always asked if I wanted it sweetened, and even what I wanted it sweetened with. Have they stopped doing that and just assume everyone wants sweet tea?

				As far as I know they don&#039;t add sugar unless you want it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I just ordered a Chai and asked for a tiny bit of sugar in it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I usually ask for no sugar.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also the iced tea I had earlier wasn&#039;t sweetened.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t know what the answer is to that.&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s the particular tea you ordered.&nbsp; Have you had it before? and was it unsweetened.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				It was the butterfly sencha. I hadn&#039;t ordered it before, and I really expected that since it was a green tea they would&#039;ve been more delicate with the sweetener or at least asked if I wanted any. I had to concentrate to taste any tea at all; it was like drinking Snapple&#039;s idea of green tea. Maybe the barista was new.

				Hi,<br /><br />I think the Barista, Steve, has been there a while.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen him for at least six months.&nbsp; Next time I recommend asking for your tea with no sugar.&nbsp; Although you shouldn&#039;t have to.&nbsp; Strange!&nbsp; Perhaps he was having an off moment or confused your drink with someone elses.&nbsp; Still, who in Astoria offers such a selection of green teas.<br /><br />

				Wanted to put in my two cents here.&nbsp; I do not get over to FS that much but have known some of the owners and they were / are nice people.&nbsp; <br /><br />theartistobjective, you need to know that people talk about two things more than anything else regarding FS:<br /><br />1. The uncomfortable (some have used the words &quot;cult like&quot;) vibe when a non frequent patron enters the place.<br />2. You and your past online name going on and on about the place to an obsessive degree.&nbsp; It&#039;s weird and suspect.<br /><br />Stop it, your efforts may actually be hurting the place. We all know your intentions are good but you need to take a step back and see what you may be doing here.&nbsp; Just relax ad enjoy FS, people will do the same if so inclined.

				To be honest, I&#039;ve had some drinks of questionable quality there in the past half year or so.&nbsp; Like, really bad coffee.&nbsp; However, recently I went and had a cup of the April Spice, iced with soy, and it was probably the best cup of iced April Spice I&#039;ve ever had there.&nbsp; Steve also turned me on to this passion fruit flavored black tea, which I had hot and really enjoyed.&nbsp; So, my recent experiences with the teas have been good. <br /><br />The bad coffee I had was a mocha and it was weak and tasted like dirt.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what was up with that. <br /><br />I&#039;m also bummed about the lack of Rose Garden due to the stupid crap value of the US dollar.&nbsp; Apparently this tea has shot up in price and so now they aren&#039;t selling it (understandable).&nbsp; I&#039;ll miss you, iced Rose Garden!&nbsp; <br /><br />Despite it all, I like Freeze Peach.&nbsp; The Hellgate CSA had a meeting there last week with our farmer, and it was a really nice time.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t get the &quot;cult&quot; vibe at all, but maybe it&#039;s because I&#039;ve been a patron there since 2005 when I moved to Astoria, plus I don&#039;t care how people look at me in there.&nbsp; Also, the seating arrangements have changed, with big tables in the front and lounge chairs and couches in the back, where most of the laptop legion was hanging out.<br /><br />With the new management, it will be interesting to see what happens!

				but yeah on a serious note, I don&#039;t have years of perspective like megc, but I&#039;ve not been thrilled with the quality of espresso/cappucinno (but I admit I&#039;m really picky). It&#039;s often burned, so I&#039;ve switched to the iced mocha. Not ideal, but doable. I really like working there and the people are nice, so that&#039;s why I come. I&#039;ve never had a problem with clientele being &quot;clique-y&quot; but maybe it&#039;s because I make an effort to chat people up. But if no one seems chatty or they&#039;re involved in their own chats, oh well, I do my own thang.

				I think it&#039;s just so foreign for many people that someone actually would be in love with a local business and want to promote it. In a city with a Starbucks and Subway on every corner to hear someone rave about any place sounds like marketing and we think it can&#039;t be true or there must be a conflict of interest. In the case of FP there genuienly are people who love the fact that it&#039;s not your typical cafe, and want to tell other people about it. In my opinion it&#039;s unique, but then again I helped originally start the place a few years ago (am not involved for 2 years now). But as with any business discussed on this site, there are people who love and hate everything.<br /><br />As I pointed out before OP doesn&#039;t have any conflict of interest - and I&#039;m familiar with the situation. Either way it&#039;s not a big deal - certainly not as big a deal as people are making this thread.

Moderators do not discuss moderation activities publicly when they contact a member with a warning. Even when a member is suspended as a result of violating board rules that information is not public except when a moderator deems it helpful to let the community know that a user has been suspended. This policy was created to protect the privacy of the person who got suspended, and 90% of the time we don&#039;t announce when a suspension occurs.<br /><br />You are correct that I (and others, including input from members) set the rules of the board, and you agree to those rules upon signing up for the site. The rules frame the conversation, and have made the site the success that it is over the years. We always welcome ideas for how the rules could be changed, but over the years I&#039;ve found that the loudest complainers often just want to complain and are not really interested in contributing to improve the set of rules that guide the site. Hence, they remain what they are today.<br /><br />Lastly, I have more than once fully disclosed my role in helping start Freeze Peach around 2005. However, I&#039;ve also disclosed that I&#039;m no longer connected to the cafe in any way for more than 2 years now. But, I do like it.

				All I’m saying to you is that you are over reacting to this whole thread over a cafe and someone promoting it in a positive way.&nbsp; That’s all.&nbsp; Why are you making such a big deal over it?&nbsp; And for the record, I’ve never set foot inside the place. But I wouldn’t decide to go or decide to stop going based on this thread. But you’re saying you would.&nbsp; &nbsp;So your opinion of an establishment is not based on their merits but on online chat that annoys you?&nbsp; <br /><br />There are a lot of people out there who are not on this site and who don’t care about any one of our opinions about any thing.&nbsp; FP will thrive, or not, based on good/bad business management.&nbsp; To seriously suggest otherwise is silly.&nbsp; &nbsp;That is my opinion.&nbsp; But you can take it any way you want.&nbsp; I may have to go there this afternoon just to see what all the drama is about.

				The next time I&#039;m in the neighborhood I&#039;m going to pop into the Freeze Peach and make a judgment for myself...as should everyone else on this board regardless of their thoughts on the positive/negative posts regarding the place, unless they have to do with the actual product as opposed to the &#039;clique-ish&#039; nature of the clients.&nbsp; I&#039;m intrigued to find out about the teas served by a place that seems as divisive as the current political climate.<br />

People are not opposed to Freeze Peach having a strong community following. This is great for a local business and we all know that. We&#039;ve had plenty of discussions on this board about local businesses that we enjoy. The problem on this whole thing started when someone criticized something Freeze Peach did, like taking donations or something, and then someone else replied with something akin to &quot;you people just don&#039;t understand&quot; and went on about how the place is important to &quot;the regulars.&quot; That&#039;s when I brought up the fact that walking in there makes me feel awkward and strange, and a lot of people ended up agreeing. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been to many friendly neighborhood-type places that have loyal customers, and none of them made me feel like this. So don&#039;t go trying to make it seem like we&#039;re just not used to folks being supportive of their local businesses - this a vibe that&#039;s been specific to Freeze Peach. theartistobjective just drove the point home more. Ultimately I don&#039;t think she caused the place much harm since the people who were so bothered by her posts are mostly people who were already a little uncomfortable going there, but please don&#039;t try to make us out to be chain-happy idiots.

				GenXnyc--<br /><br />I think it&#039;s because there recently have been multiple postings about Freeze Peach from the same two or three people. Even the person who started this thread admits that they posted about FP on their last username, which, seems like it wasn&#039;t too long ago.<br /><br />Just like the &quot;realtor reviews&quot; one or two get over looked, two long threads with similar posts by the OP in each one (really, what in this thread wasn&#039;t mentioned in the other?) starts to feel like astroturfing and it&#039;s annoying.

				&nbsp;:roll: They&#039;ve recently changed the layout of the place and there are now a couple large tables in the front section, and people sitting there are less inclined to stare at the people who just walked in. This is what I noticed the time I went in last weekend and got the inappropriately sweetened tea. So apparently they are trying to do something to change the vibe of the place. Anyone who&#039;s never been there and reads the complaints about weirdly staring people, and then goes in expecting this, will likely have the confused reaction of gud stuf.

				Dear Astorians,<br /><br />I&#039;ve only visited Freeze Peach a few times (I&#039;m actually packing up and heading there soon). <br /><br />I&#039;m a huge fan. It&#039;s comfortable. The employees are friendly and helpful. Their iced tea is the best I&#039;ve had in New York.

				The fiance was getting his hair cut at SPAce and we decided to go ahead and get iced chai teas at Freeze Peach afterward, you know, see what all the fuss was about.&nbsp; They were good.&nbsp; Not the most delicious I&#039;ve ever had, but solid and relatively inexpensive, and served in an eco-friendly cup which I appreciated.&nbsp; People seemed nice enough (no one had the glazed over, slightly fevered look I&#039;d associate with cult members).&nbsp; I&#039;d stop in again if I were in the neighborhood, but I don&#039;t know that I&#039;d go out of my way to get a beverage from them.&nbsp; And that&#039;s my Freeze Peach review, for better or worse.

				Finally tried Freeze Peach a couple times recently after living in Astoria for two years. Bad me. Anyway, enjoyed the chider, though it really just tastes like mulled cider rather than anything having to do with chai. Limonata was good as well, but vanilla flavor was intermittent and mostly elusive. Pumpkin pie didn&#039;t taste like such to me, but had a good blend of spices. I&#039;ll be back.

				Does anyone go to these places simply because they like the seating? I love the chairs there. I had stopped going to FB because if I didn&#039;t get that one leather one chair that I was comfortable doing work in I couldn&#039;t get work done...those new stool-like things rock. Their drinks and stuff are adequate for me, but it just isn&#039;t what I look for when i want to get out of the house and do some work. A good chair and palatable coffee and I&#039;m good to go. <br /><br />I had no idea until reading this thread about he culty thing. Personally, I look up when people enter any place...usually becuase i&#039;m doing work on my computer and will look for ANY excuse to get distracted. <br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m glad to find a place that has a comfy work-chair. (I couldn&#039;t do work in the chairs at the waltz, or oleput, and the greek cafes are just too loud).
