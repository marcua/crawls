			I&#39;m planning on going hiking in late September -- and it will be my first &quot;official&quot; hike and my first &quot;mountain&quot; adventure in the North East.&nbsp; Since I was born in Colorado I&#39;ve done some walking around in the woods and wandering around the Rockies, but this may not have qualified as hiking.&nbsp; I was also young and there were bears (and poison ivy) so memories are not particularly fond.<br /><br />However, I&#39;m trying again.&nbsp; Several friends love this hiking thing so I&#39;m convinced it can&#39;t be as miserable as I remember.<br /><br />My girl problem is this:<br />What shoes do I wear hiking?<br /><br />The promised trail is short and not very vertical (under 3 hours roundtrip).&nbsp; I have running shoes and city shoes.&nbsp; Will running shoes work?<br /><br />I would prefer not to invest in boots but I am considering a pair of trail running shoes as these I can see some future purpose for.<br /><br />Is footwear important on a starter hike?&nbsp; Will trail running shoes work?<br /><br />cheers,<br />jayme<br />

			re: trail running shoes versus lightweigh hiking boots:<br /><br />trail running shoes are probably fine so long as you don&#39;t have any significant elevation gain but you may be able to get a simple pair of ankle height ankle boots for the same price (and in some cases for even less money)<br /><br />what you want to make sure you have for hiking is good support both for your feet and ankles. you also want to make sure your foot isn&#39;t sliding or rubbing - to prevent falls and to prevent blisters.<br /><br />what I definitely would also think about is keeping your feet dry (from sweat, again to prevent blisters). you can purchase a pair of wicking liners at EMS (Eastern Mountain Store) that you wear as a layering pair between your feet and socks. <br /><br />hope this helps.

			I&#39;m no expert on this, but my 2 cents anyway... There&#39;s a lot to be said for the steel shank in hiking shoes and hiking boots when walking on rough terrain. It really helps with comfort and endurance. I&#39;d suggest getting a pair of relatively inexpensive and comfortable hiking shoes. If you&#39;re going to be walking on trails, the ankle support might not be as essential, and the shoes are cooler and more comfortable. I got a pair of Ecco hiking shoes recently that I really like. As for trail runners, I&#39;m not sure that they have a steel shank, so I&#39;d avoid them unless you&#39;re actually going to be train running... And I agree with mirki -- get a pair of non-cotton wicking hiking socks...

			Hmmm.<br /><br />Re: trail running, no I will not be running these hiking trails but I am thinking about doing some trail running.&nbsp; I like the idea of dual purpose shoes but will think on it.&nbsp; I suspect trail running shoes do NOT have steel in them but will look.<br /><br />I&#39;m relatively expert on warm wicking quick dry socks as I&#39;ve run through the cold wet wintertimes and have a small stock of fantastic happy socks.&nbsp; It is a good tip though.<br /><br />thanks,<br />jayme

			My advice is wear your running shoes unless you plan on using trail runners/hiking boots a lot.&nbsp; Go with the cheap route.&nbsp; You shouldn&#39;t need anything more for a 3 hour hike around here.&nbsp; If you are going to the Whites in Vermont or hiking in Penn then maybe get trail runners or boots (very rocky) but still I would think twice about spending the money.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
