				My two favourites were the suadero (veal) from Los Portales, and the barbacoa (barbequed goat) from Original Mexican Food. Both were served relatively unadorned, as I have found tacos in Mexico to be (and hence ready for whatever embellishments you preferred) - but they really won out for their flavour. Both were outstanding- very different from each other, but each with tender, flavourful meat.

				Aldos is one of the three Democratic clubs in Astoria (the other two being the Powhatan, my home club, and the Taminent).&nbsp; I work for an autism agency, so I was there to talk about the services we provide.&nbsp; Alexa and Perchori were talking about autism in general and the current science around it.

				Thanks for the info-&nbsp; i have a student who has autism, mildly, but still takes a bit of work.&nbsp; Umm, i should state, however, that he not diagnosed, but rather has many symptoms. Great kid and doing well in school, but will need some extra support from us.

				So this is an old thread, but figured I&#039;d start it up again to report a &quot;sighting&quot;: the Black family! <br /><br />While brunching @ Othello this morning, overheard a woman entering say something about &quot;the famous Black family!&quot; Looked outside and noticed a familiar face pushing a stroller, alongside his wife. Sure enough, it matched eblack&#039;s avatar, as did the kiddies in the strollers.&nbsp; 8-) Fun!

				Supposedly I had a sighting today at the soap store (told soap lady &quot;hey I heard about your store on Astorians&quot; to which soap lady replied &quot;she [pointing to exiting customer] said the same thing!&quot;). But I don&#039;t know who it was! And they probably didn&#039;t know who I was either! Weird stuff people. Weird stuff.
