				My mom goes to Dr. Falcone. He&#039;s on 30th Avenue, between 35th and 36th Streets - 35-01 30th Avenue.<br />His office is in the old Long Island Savings Bank building that Pistilli now owns. <br /><br />She&#039;s been with him for years and he&#039;s great. He&#039;s also been very good when she&#039;s had <br />emergencies&nbsp; -- has her come in immediately and doesn&#039;t make her wait.<br /><br />Office staff is very pleasant too. <br /><br />He takes a lot insurance plans.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have his number, but am sure he&#039;s in the book. <br /><br />He also does Saturday appointments.<br /><br />

				My partner and I both go to Dr. Falcone. I&#039;ve had ankle problems since a fall a few years back and Falcone specializes in ankle issues. My partner has a bad bunion problem. Dr. Falcone was able to trace the bunion to hip problems she&#039;s having and referred her to an amazing doctor at HSS that he works with. We definitely appreciate Dr. Falcone for really getting to the root of a problem that had been going on for years. <br /><br />Ovidio J. Falcone, DPM<br />3501 30th Ave # 401<br />Astoria, NY 11103-4662<br />(718) 721-9292<br /><br />I had been going to Dr. Glassmith on 31st Avenue for years, but my grandmother suggested I try Dr. Falcone. In addition to being a good podiatrist, he&#039;s also a really nice guy -- always asks about my grandmother (who just adores him), and really takes the time to sit and talk to us and explain everything.
