				They mention the Bel- Aire diner. So sad that they are dying out. I love diners because I like the fact that serve a wide variety of food at practically all hours. Most diners have nice owners or family members that talk to you and make you feel welcomed. I remember one Thanksgiving I couldn&#039;t going away to see my folks and I wound up at the Belaire with a couple of friends who were in the same boat. We got the Thanksgiving special and I believe for $25 bucks we got so much food that it was enough to last for a couple of days! We&#039;ll let&#039;s hope things change for the best and that diners stay around for a long time!

				I just finished reading this article.&nbsp; I hope that his son could manage the Belaire Diner when he takes over.&nbsp; The young people today don&#039;t know how great diners are.&nbsp; When I was younger we used to eat at diners all the time.&nbsp; Most are open 24 hours and have a big variety of food and daily specials.&nbsp; The portions are also very big

				You got that right! Nothing like a NYC diner especially when you can&#039;t figure out what you want to eat!&nbsp; I hope the son does well too. In the this type of business you can&#039;t be a pushover. People are going to try to get over and ask for more money so the owner has to be firm and diplomatic and have good contacts with the suppliers and just everyone in general. Good people skills and also to treat your workers fair and to let them know when they need to do a better job.

				I haven&#039;t read the article but I saw a news report on the subject on tv.&nbsp; I love diners because they&#039;re the only restaurants in New York that serve &quot;American&quot; food (at reasonable prices).

				<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font">Thanks for sharing the article. </span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font"><br />&nbsp;<br />One of my favorite diners in Manhattan, La Parisienne on 7th and 57th street, </span></span>closed this year. It was just a diner, but I loved the neon sign and the name, which I thought meant &quot;the Parisian&quot; but later found out also referred to an ancient fresco painting in Crete.<br />&nbsp;<br />The location was good and I often met friends there for a bite after work. We&#039;d often try to think of somewhere new to go to but La Parisienne, which should be pronounced faux french style, was always our fallback.<br />&nbsp;<br />This was the first time I really felt a kick about an old haunt closing. I&#039;m not one to be nostalgic and try to look forward and find something new to try, but it&#039;s sad to me that nothing new replaces these types of &quot;cheap and cheerful&quot; places in the same way. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;I felt the same about one of my favorite pizza parlors, Stromboli, on University Place which also closed (it was in the same building as Bowlmor) to make way for another useless luxury condo conversion. At least Joe&#039;s Pizza on Bleecker Street and 6th is still going strong.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

				I love diners and I don&#039;t believe they are dying off. I feel their niche is changing as culinary trends shift attention to other types of restaurants. We have so many more sushi, thai, gastropubs, etc than we had even 10 years ago. There will always be diners on the tri-state area food scene.

				The bel-aire diner isn&#039;t that good anymore. For how expensive it has gotten, for the same price you can eat at a lot of other neighborhood places that are a lot better.<br /><br /><br />The Jackson Hole also isn&#039;t particularly outstanding, breakfast is good but the burgers are bland (unless you want 40000 toppings on a giant tasteless slab of meat) and the fries are always god-awful.<br /><br /><br /><br />
