				So now of course I&#39;m even more addicted than ever.&nbsp; Just watched the premiere, and it only served to pique my interest more and opened 10 more questions to solve.&nbsp; Why is Jack under water???&nbsp; Who are these Others and what the hell is their problem?<br /><br />And next week looks so good!

				I stopped watching it halfway through season 2. Every episode leaves more questions and doesn&#39;t really answer much. After a while, it started grating on my nerves.<br /><br />Now, Battlestar Galactica, on the other hand....

				I got into it about a year ago when my roommate got Season 1 for her birthday. I tried to catch up with Season 2 by downloading episodes, but I couldn&#39;t catch up. So I just spent the past couple weeks watching Season 2 on DVD, and I was actually able to watch an episode as it aired tonight! Yay!<br /><br />Its going to kill me watching it as it airs now though because I am so used to watching it on DVD, and if I was left with a cliffhanger (and had time), I could just watch the next episode. I did the same thing with the first 4 seasons of 24 (I used to watch an episode a day on my lunch break), and when I tried to watch it on tv as it aired, I lost intrest.<br /><br />I actually was just looking online because we were wondering what Stephen King book the book club was reading (did anyone notice? just curious), and I came across LostHatch.com (http://www.losthatch.com). Holy crap! I knew there were people who were way into the show, but I never knew I could actually be interested in so many details of A TELEVISION SHOW. THAT ISN&#39;T REAL. Hahaha...<br /><br />I also like the Television Without Pity (http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com) recaps, they&#39;re always funny, and they call it &quot;craphole island&quot; which I think is awesome.

				I&#39;m so upset about Invasion!!!&nbsp; At least now I know someone was as hooked as I was.&nbsp; They definitely cancelled it and left us all hanging.&nbsp; I was upset with the finale of Invasion though, it was pretty dumb.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t stick around to watch The Nine, I don&#39;t need another show to get hooked on.&nbsp; I barely have time for Lost as it is.&nbsp; I admit I get frustrated with Lost, what with the slow plot development and the reruns, but I just can&#39;t help to keep watching.&nbsp; It&#39;s an addiction for sure.<br /><br />I tend to old fashion VCR tape it, then watch it later.&nbsp; I don&#39;t always make it home to watch, so my vcr is set to weekly tapings of it.

				ok, on show talk threads- can we agree to put SPOILER in the subject line for talk about episodes that are within maybe a month of original airdate? I&#39;m used to having that heads up on other sites that talk about shows and i think it would just be easier for people to avoid spoilers. i got 3 words into urrisgirl&#39;s post before i tucked tail and ran!

				Thanks so much for posting that lostpedia site!!&nbsp; I could spend hours in there figuring out what I missed, or just plain didn&#039;t get.&nbsp; I did not see Jacob at all.&nbsp; I have been a Lost fan since day one, especially since my friend worked on it as a location scout in Hawaii for season one.&nbsp; Even when I&#039;m frustrated, I can&#039;t give up watching it.&nbsp; It&#039;s too good!&nbsp; My vcr is set to a weekly taping schedule so I don&#039;t have to remember to set it if i miss it. <br /><br />Favorite characters??&nbsp; I have way too many, they are all so complex and interesting.&nbsp; And I&#039;m glad they finally set an end date.

				I&#039;m OBSESSED with Lost, yay! I&#039;m so glad other people are as well :) I&#039;ve been avoiding this thread because I finally got around to watching last week&#039;s episode.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never really trusted Locke, but I don&#039;t want him to die (I doubt they&#039;ll get rid of him).<br /><br />How many episodes are left in this season? 2? I wonder if anywhere (like a bar or whatever) is going to have a Lost season finale party - my sister used to go to &quot;24&quot; parties when she lived in Boston.

				Ben is the master liar! I don&#039;t know I could be wrong about Naomi but I just have a gut instinct that she is an &quot;other&quot;. I guess we will just have to wait and see. <br /><br />I think the chicks in the Looking Glass are not DI but &quot;others&quot;. I don&#039;t think Ben would have kept any of the DI people alive. Plus Juliette mentioned something about Ben jamming the frequency on the Looking Glass which means his people had to go down there in order to do that. <br /><br />Did anyone watch the show last night that recapped the program?

				I was there last week and it still had a nice crowd with the bad weather.&nbsp; There were still plenty of seats but you have to remember the place is huge.&nbsp; There were some people that did talk during some parts, but there was a lot of loud shhhing going on, and I don&#039;t think much talking would be tolerated.&nbsp; There&#039;s a big sign that it&#039;s a Lost Viewing Party and if you don&#039;t want to watch it, that you should hang out in the other room.&nbsp; They play the show real loud.&nbsp; They also have waiters to bring you food and drinks, but you can also get up and order it.
