			<br />
			For anyone who needs maid/cleaning service I highly recommend: Sophia 718-396-9397. Have been using her from every other week to once a mo. for about a year. Entirely reliable and thorough. Hard working and speedy. In two hours she does more than I do in 6. I got her thru her sister who works at my local cleaner.

			She seems negotiable since she is just starting, but she prefers like $50 or there abouts it seems. If you need to call me with any questions, let me know.
