				It looks like zipcar is coming to Astoria.&nbsp; Has anyone rented one before?&nbsp; How is it?&nbsp; I haven&#39;t but I know they are all the rage with kiddies. <br /><br />See below, last paragraph (Queens Chronicle 6/15/06)<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />06/15/2006 <br />Zipcar Pulls Up In Flushing—Members Only Service Rents Cars For Hours, Days&nbsp; <br />by Liz Rhoades , LizR@qchron.com&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;(Michael O’Kane) A Toyota Scion Zipcar is ready for use in a Flushing garage. Members can rent a car for an hour or more.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;If you’re tired of spending money on taxis or rental cars, a new business in Flushing—Zipcar—may put you in the driver’s seat for less. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The Massachusetts based company was organized in 2000 and now offers cars in Boston, New York City, San Francisco, Minneapolis and Washington, D.C. It also partners with several colleges. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Zipcar began its Flushing service at the beginning of the year at 85 15 Main St., in the Ultra Car Park Garage and company officials say it is gaining popularity. “We have already added another vehicle there and will continue to expand in Queens,” said Zipcar Regional Vice President Julian Espiritu. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;To use the service, you must join and obtain a Zipcard. Then, you can book a car at any time—if a vehicle is available—from any Zipcar location. You go to the site, hold the Zipcard to the windshield and the doors open. Use the car for as long as you’ve got it booked and return it to the original site. The car comes with a full tank of gas, insurance, and an XM radio. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;There are requirements to join. You must be over 21, have a valid driver’s license for at least a year and have had no more than two moving violations and accidents in the last three years and no more than one incident in the last 18 months. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Members must also give a $100 deposit via a credit card, which is returned when you cancel. For the occasional driver, the annual fee is $50 plus a $25 application fee. Hourly rates vary depending on the type of car but start as low as $10 an hour and $69 a day. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;In Flushing, the cars available include a Toyota Prius Pravda, Honda Element Eskimo, Volvo Sturtze and Toyota Scion. Each car comes equipped with a universal gas card and when the tank is down to a quarter or less, members are asked to fill it up for the next driver. The card is accepted at all major gas stations and can only be used for that vehicle. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Be warned, if you use Zipcar, there are no pets allowed, except in carriers and no smoking. There are penalties if people are found to break the rules. Espiritu explained that members treat the vehicles like their own. “They take care of them and report any abuse by the previous driver,” he said. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Cars are cleaned at least once a week and are on a regular maintenance system. “We depend highly on feedback from members,” Espiritu said. “If something goes wrong while driving, there is a hotline for 24 hour roadside assistance.” <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;When you call or go online to reserve a car, the service will indicate if a car is available when you want it. The company says you can reserve minutes or months ahead of time. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Espiritu calls the service, “like a time share on a vehicle,” and says it complements mass transit. “It gives people an alternative,” he added. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;In New York City, where parking is at a premium and costs are high, using a Zipcar can be the way to go. The company says when Zipcars are used, there is less congestion on the roads and less strain on available parking. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;According to a recent member survey, each Zipcar takes over 20 personally owned vehicles off the roads, since members either sell their cars or decide against purchasing one. In the major cities that have Zipcars, over 55,000 members share 1,500 vehicles. That amounts to nearly 20,000 cars off the streets. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The service appeals to college students, who don’t need a car on a regular basis, and city dwellers, where parking is limited. Expect to see more locations in the New York City area in the future. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Other locations in Queens for Zipcars include 47 01 Queens Blvd. in Sunnyside with seven cars and the Citylights Building in Long Island City with one car. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;A new location will be opening soon in Astoria as soon as the cars arrive. Manhattan has numerous locations. As a member, you can borrow a car from any Zipcar location, but it must be returned to the original site. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;For information, go to www.zipcar.com or phone (866) 497 7227.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />

				Here&#39;s (http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=774.0) a thread from last September on Zipcars.&nbsp; As you will see, I think they&#39;re a great idea.&nbsp; I&#39;ve never personally had a Zipcar account, but a friend of mine used to as I described in the older thread, and she really thought it was great.

				I&#39;m a Zipcar member, but sometimes it can be a pain if you want a car on a weekend, or for more than a few hours.&nbsp; I also hate the fact that most cars are the least convenient to Astorians.&nbsp; I do hope they come here...sigh...

				I&#39;ve only had one car with an automatic, and it&#39;s the one I had when I drove between CT and NYC once a week. Getting stuck in a bumper-to-bumper traffic jam with a clutch really sucks. For any other driving, though, a clutch is much more fun!

				I too learned to drive on a stick. They are a lot more fun! Except in San Francisco!<br /><br />Owned a &quot;baby&quot; Blazer, back in the days before SUV&#39;s, and drove it cross-country almost three times. Awesome. Texas + New York,&nbsp; New York + Texas + California, then California + Texas + Boston, and that&#39;s where the story ends because my cute little red friend got stolen in the middle of a weekday afternoon from the parking lot next to the bldg where I worked.<br /><br />I think I created a self-prophecy, or whatever its called, because I was always so worried about it getting stolen. At the time Boston was the car-theft capital of the U.S. and of course I had Texas/Dallas Cowboys stuff all over it (just like my car now) and was afraid that might make it a target but I will remove no Cowboys sticker even to thwart a thief!!<br /><br />Part of the office I worked in overlooked the parking lot so at least a few times a day I went and checked on it. My co-workers were always teasing me by rushing in saying frantically &quot;Cathy, where&#39;s your truck&quot; and of course I would run to the window and they would all laugh...hahaha, uh...yeah....eventually I didn&#39;t worry about it anymore. Then one day someone rushes in and asks where the truck is, I blow them off, ok haha, yes you are a real jokemeister....&quot;no really, where is your truck.&quot; I keep going along, oh yes my truck has been stolen..haha...&quot;NO REALLY WHERE IS YOUR TRUCK&quot;...I go to the window and my parking spot is so empty I swear it looks like the Grand Canyon or something. I call the cops, and this is the saddest part of the whole thing, they wouldn&#39;t even come out and make a report, that&#39;s how many cars were stolen a day. I mean they took a report but not like in person or anything, you know, look at the &quot;crime scene&quot;. His exact words still ring in my ears when I think about it, &quot;Sorry about your vehicle lady, if we find anything we&#39;ll let you know.&quot; That was it. I never saw hide nor hair of it again...... :cry:

				There were some people handing out ZipCar flyers today at the corner of Steinway and Broadway. I have been thinking about joining since my car died a few weeks ago, but didn&#39;t know much about it. I remember Cary saying that she was a member, but was wondering if any other Astorians have joined. It seems like their only Astoria location (30-85 Vernon Blvd.) is quite inconvenient for many Astorians to get to. I also don&#39;t understand how this is any cheaper than renting a car.

				I joined Zipcar and use a pick-up location on Queens Blvd.&nbsp; The daily rates wind up being the same as a conventional car rental, but they also have hourly rates (I believe that&#39;s for a rental period of less than 8 hours) which start at $10/hour.&nbsp; Also, you can pick up or drop off a car anytime, which is convenient for Sundays, as other rental places I looked into either were closed on Sunday or had limited hours.&nbsp; They have different locations in Astoria, LIC, and Sunnyside.
