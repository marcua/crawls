				Now I have another reason not to. Below is from the New York 1 website.<br /><br /><br /><span class="bbc_u"><span style="font-size: 18px;" class="bbc_size"><strong>&quot;Skirt Cam&quot; Found Under Subway Grate On Upper East Side</strong></span></span><br />&nbsp; <br />May 18, 2005<br /><br />Police found a so-called &quot;skirt cam&quot; under a subway grate at 88th Street and Lexington Avenue Tuesday afternoon after a woman called police saying she had noticed suspicious wires protruding from the grate as she passed by. <br /><br />Police closed off the street, fearing the device was a bomb, but soon realized it was a four-inch multi-media camera recording and pointing upward. The camera had an external hard-drive, making it possible for recordings to be broadcast on television and downloaded onto the internet. <br /><br />Police do not consider the camera to be a threat to public safety, but they do consider it a threat to individual privacy. <br /><br />Some passersby in the neighborhood who spoke to NY1 said they would think twice before ever walking over a grate again. <br /><br />&quot;It's pretty awful. It really is. I think that I walk over that every single day, but she actually wears skirts more than I do,&quot; said one woman, referring to another woman with her. &quot;I happen to have one on today. I'm so glad that I was wearing pants [the rest of the time.]&quot; <br /><br />&quot;It's really weird that people would actually do this,&quot; said a young girl. &quot;I think it's disgusting.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;I generally don't walk on grates,&quot; said another woman, who added that she definitely won't be walking over grates from now on. <br /><br />Police sources say investigators are looking into the possibility the camera was installed by MTA workers. <br /><br />The California company that manufactures the camera says it will work with police to trace the serial number back to its owner. <br /><br />A few years ago, Governor George Pataki signed a law making &quot;video voyeurism&quot; a felony offence in New York State, meaning the person responsible for installing the camera could face up to seven years in prison if convicted. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />http://ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=1&amp;aid=50957
