				That&#039;s so sad, I never heard of this story, but that&#039;s because it was before my time, it happened in 1959. Were there any leads or clues about who may have kiiled the boy? Did it happen going to or from school? That&#039;s when alot of abductions occur.<br /><br />Growing up in Astoria in the 1960s, I do recall my mom being very protective against possible child kidnapping. Apparently there had been a rash of them in the late 50s / early 60s, and she would only allow us to play inside the front yard with the gates closed. If someone appraoched us when she wasn&#039;t there we were to either run inside or yell out loud for help.<br /><br />People today have an idealized nostalgia of NY in the 1950s, but it had it&#039;s share of crimes too, some of it horrific like this one. Perhaps some of the older members of the group have some recollection of this tragedy.

				Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; Michael had a little part time job&nbsp; on Saturday evenings putting the inserts in the Sunday papers at a local candy store.&nbsp; He left the store at 9:00 PM and never made it home.&nbsp; Although Michael was a good kid and came from a good family, the police treated the case as a runaway child.&nbsp; When his body was discovered 10 weeks later, they then started to treat it as a homicide.&nbsp; It was raining the night he disappeared, and the family feels that someone local might had offered Michael a ride home.&nbsp; Someone out there must know something.&nbsp; Hoping to help the family find some kind of closure.&nbsp;

				The police had a bad policy back then of treating all children as runaways first. It&#039;s only recently that people have realized that the first few hour and days a child is missing are critical in tracking him or her down before they can come to harm. To assume first that a minor choses not to be home on their own accord is bad logic, and has cost too many lives. At age 12 a child is still basically helpless, especially against an adult. Sadly it&#039;s to late for those like Michael Kelly who may have stood a chance to be located, but at least we&#039;re taking the issue of a missing child more seriously today. If the police didn&#039;t take the matter seriously until after his body was found 10 weeks later, the physical evidence had to have been limited. Only witnesses or people talking through the grapevine could help now. Hopefully somebody remembers something.

				I was in high school at the time, but I have a vague recollection of the incident. I remember parents meeting at, I believe it was, JHS 10, to discuss it with the teachers from all the local feeder schools and the police. I also remember that the idea that it might have been someone he knew was brought up because he was such a good boy. It was a rainy night, and at that time, most of us would have gladly accepted a ride home from a familiar person. My sister and I were instructed to NEVER get in a car with anyone that didn&#039;t use the password our parents&#039; gave us. To this day I remember that password!

				I remember this case very well....there was a prime suspect however his wife provided an alibi which many people at the time believed was a lie.&nbsp; &nbsp;There was a lengthy police investigation only after this boy&#039;s body was found and after the police being prompted by the newspapers of the time, i.e., the Journal-American, if anyone recalls that paper.&nbsp; There was also coverage by the NY Daily News.&nbsp; There was a journalist, Dan Brigham who reported on this case several times.&nbsp; Also the case, once closed, was reopened by the Police Commissioner at the time and was a headline, as I recall it, on the front page of the Journal-American by Mr. Brigham, report of the Journal.&nbsp; &nbsp;Older Astorians might recall this terrible tradegy in 1959 still unsolved to this date.

				Thank you for your reply Kindred.&nbsp; Yes, there was a prime suspect.&nbsp; I was wondering if any of our readers would know how one could go about getting the police to reopen this case.&nbsp; In this day with DNA, maybe this could be solved.&nbsp; Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;

				Brian,&nbsp; Are you in law enforcement currently or have you been?&nbsp; &nbsp;If I remember correctly, this case was handled by the 114 precinct and also the precinct (I believe in College Point) where this boy&#039;s body was found.&nbsp;

				I agree....while I used to live in Astoria, it has been many,many years since I moved away.&nbsp; However, there are some people who have lived in Astoria all their lives and someone must have heard or have known <br />something.&nbsp; Anyway, thanks for your reply.

				Thanks....and I will keep in touch regarding this tragedy.&nbsp; &nbsp; This boy attended Immaculate Conception Church in Astoria and was an altar boy there as far as I can recall.&nbsp; Many of the older people in the area would remember as it was such a tragic case and left unsolved even though there was a prime suspect at the time this happened.

				As my screen name says, I have close ties to Michael Kelly&#039;s family. I am dubious about the claim of wanting closure for the family; the surviving family in fact might not want to bring it up again. That being said, it is my understanding that one of them aggressively confronted the man the family suspected to have murdered Michael (maybe the same one mentioned above whose wife gave him a false alibi): a man very involved in their church, with a number of young sons of his own. I don&#039;t know what was said or if someone vowed to get revenge or justice, but it is my understanding that Michael was a very sweet boy, a good kid, the baby of the family and everybody&#039;s favorite little brother. It truly was a heartbreak to a family that had already experienced too many heartaches, and if there were a way to heal that grief, it would be a blessing from Above.

				Wow<br /><br /><br />I was 11 in 1959, went to Immac and was an altar boy there.&nbsp; Really surprised that I don&#039;t remember this terrible event.&nbsp; Where did the Kelly&#039;s live?&nbsp; You might try to contact the Cold Case Detective Squad of the NYPD.&nbsp; There might be one in each borough, or it might be city-wide.&nbsp; Check their website.&nbsp; Good luck.
