				I&#039;m a big fan of T-Mobile (been a customer for years) but would much rather go to the official T-Mobile store on 31st/Ditmars than an authorised retailer.

We at T-MOBILE def appreciate your input. Nothing is one hundred percent lol. But i know that from living in Astoria for 6yrs and working at our new location on 36st since in opened 6 weeks ago. i&#039;ve had great service! :-D of course not everybody might share the same experience but i have done many new activations in the area especially for customers that live in The Acropolyse and they all get great service too. Not to say that your experience with tmobile never happened. How long ago did you have the service?

We live to provide you with the best service possible. I hope you have one of the new HSPA+ enabled smartphones and are experiencing the fast web experience it offers.&nbsp; :-) To be accurate our store is a Limited exclusive retailer which is has all the same powers as the corporate except for the installment payment plan. One advantage over corporate that we do have is the flexibility to offer the phones at reduced prices. for example we have a promotion going on right now that expires tomorrow where with a new activation* you can own a mytouch 4G or G2 or HD7 for only $50.00. that&#039;s right only $50 bucks. corporate offers it for 79.99. Plus we offer gels and screen protectors for free so you may protect your new investment. You should def pass by if not to buy anything def to check us out see what we are about. Our staff is extremely friendly and we strive to give you the best service possible. Our location def has corporate appeal as well. So we would def appreciate if you stopped by one day to check us out.
