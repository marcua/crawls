				We have some guests from out of town (country) staying with us for the 4th, and they want to see the fireworks. Where&#039;s the good location in our area? They have baby stroller so they can&#039;t travel too far. Can we see from Astoria Park ??? Any advice will be appreciated!!&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:

				I believe that this year all the fireworks on the 4th are in the Hudson River as some commeration.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sadly, Astoria Park is too far north to see the fireworks even when they are in the East River.<br /><br />That said, there are fireworks on Monday, June 29th which take place right across from Astoria Park.&nbsp; We usually go to those each year and then skip the ones on the 4th so that could work if your friends are in town by then.

				Thanks to everyone who gave the Hudson River information - I had no idea about this change till you mentioned it.&nbsp; Anybody know of an especially good viewing site on the West Side?&nbsp; The Macy&#039;s site gives street suggestions, but doesn&#039;t say what&#039;s there.

Here&#039;s a link to the map. http://www.hudsonriverpark.org/explore.html (http://www.hudsonriverpark.org/explore.html) They&#039;ll probably close the Highway like they do with the FDR when it&#039;s on the East River. <br /><br /><br />Well, I just looked closer and viewing will be on the highway. If memory serves me South of 34th st may be the best option. North if full of piers and parking structure and what not. Seeing the ones in the sky will be fine wherever you are. The one thing the Macy site doesn&#039;t show is the Barge locations. If I knew that I could tell you better.

				Thanks, kempsternyc.&nbsp; <br /><br />I spent years perfecting my FDR Drive viewing.&nbsp; Anybody know the best way to get up on the West Side Highway?<br /><br />I don&#039;t think the park is going to be closed - their calendar lists a children&#039;s event in the afternoon.&nbsp; For the fireworks you just don&#039;t want to get stuck <span class="bbc_u">under</span> the highway.&nbsp; The highway above your head would obstruct your view, same as on the East Side.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the Cirle Line cruise link.&nbsp; I&#039;ll tell you in advance - it&#039;s $75 per person.<br />http://www.circleline42.com/site/browse.aspx?product=131 (http://www.circleline42.com/site/browse.aspx?product=131)<br /><br />Good lord, I just looked at the website again.&nbsp; $50 for their rooftop.&nbsp; Food &amp; drink NOT included for either location.&nbsp; But, as money goes, either location is going to be great viewing.
