				ok, so this week- Asparagus! i know that one!!!!<br />I&#39;m making one of my favs. A grilled thing salad.<br />here&#39;s my makeshift recipe:<br /><br />Asparagus - as much as you want i guess? Break them off where it&#39;s dry and hard. Blanch them. Toss with olive oil and sliced mushrooms, season with garlic salt and pepper. Grill them for a few minutes til everything is tender.<br />Meanwhile prep your lettuce. Cut up one onion, a few tomatoes and a cucumber. <br />When the grilling is done, add your salad dressing of choice to the salad mix then throw in all the grillins. <br />and for the meat eaters- sometimes i grill shrimp with it but tonight i&#39;m grilling some chicken chunks. <br /><br />this is really really refreshing for the summer. I think last year, we lived on different variations of this salad all summer long! Its easy and yummy. Might i suggest Ken&#39;s Steakhouse Light Caesar Dressing- it doesn&#39;t taste like ceasar and its not creamy, weird and good and a little goes a long way.

				I&#39;m not part of the CSA, but here&#39;s a great quick recipe for fresh asparagus...<br /><br />Snap woody stems<br />Heat butter &amp; olive oil in pan with a few cloves of thinly sliced garlic (don&#39;t be skimpy with the fats, be sure the bottom of the saute pan is covered)<br />Saute garlic until just starting to turn golden brown<br />Toss in asparagus and squeeze in 1/2 fresh lemon, pinch of salt and fresh pepper<br />Continue tossing until asparagus is cooked to your liking<br />Remove pan from heat<br />Generously sprinkle a layer of grated parmesan<br />Cover and leave off heat for a few minutes to allow parmesan to melt<br /><br />Makes a great side dish or you could cut asparagus into 1&quot; lengths and then toss the mixture with pasta - enjoy!<br />

				<br />Lavendar Lemonade<br /><br />Infuse 1 flower (cut off the part of the stem with no flowers) into a pitcher of lemonade for a unique take on a traditional summer drink.&nbsp; You can add another flower if you want it particularly lavendarry!&nbsp; Idea is courtesy of the beautiful lavendar farm we visited in Maui.<br /><br />- Abby &amp; Tom

				I made the lavender hazelnut bread from the web site that enigmacat pointed out. (Extending the baking time to a much more reasonable 40 minutes or so.) It rose huge, but only tasted fair. The lavender was pretty subtle. The photos turned out pretty good, though! <br /><br /><div align="center">(http://static.zooomr.com/images/5165cf98412bea4c2ee66c90ba19db87b23b046c.jpg)<br />(http://static.zooomr.com/images/6270bea77c06928ef85064ad890e4d3e0ccd1405.jpg)<br /></div><br /><span style="font-size: 6pt;" class="bbc_size">(Zoomr) (http://beta.zooomr.com/photos/1148831001_4085/63911)</span>

I am currently enjoying my first cup of Lavendar Tea, and it is lovely and quite fragrant. I am drying the rest of the lavendar so I can enjoy it over time.<br /><br />So essentially I took a couple of stalks of the lavendar and steeped it in some hot water for a few minutes, then added about a teaspoon and a half of raw honey (which I got at the Green Market in Union Square a while back). Very nice! Thanks Abby and Tom!<br /><br />Oh and BTW - I have done this all at work, so those of you at the office have no excuse if you want to try it! ;)

				Speaking of lavender, I urge anyone, particularly anyone with kids, to read my latest blog entry that discusses a, uh, large health consequence of lavender...<br /><br />http://somethinktochewon.blogspot.com/2006/07/lavender-yep-its-girly.html (http://somethinktochewon.blogspot.com/2006/07/lavender-yep-its-girly.html)

				It&#039;s week 3 again, and lavender is in this year&#039;s week 3 share too!<br /><br />I just ran across this blog posting (http://blog.foodienyc.com/2007/06/lavender_steame.html) for an interesting dish: Lavender Steamed Cod with Cherry Chili Vinegar. Sounds good...!<br /><br /><br /><br />
