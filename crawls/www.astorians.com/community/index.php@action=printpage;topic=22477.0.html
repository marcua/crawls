Anderson and <em>The House of Scorpions</em>by Nancy Farmer, as well as the classic <em>The Lord of the Flies</em> by William Golding.&nbsp; Students will discuss the books and larger issues brought up by the books, like: What does it mean to be civil? and If you could start your own society over again, how would you do it?&nbsp; They will also write an essay on one or more of the books and receive targeted feedback on grammar, spelling, style, and content.<br />An online discussion board will supplement in-person discussion and activities (and allowing vacationing/absent students to remain involved in the class).<br />6 Fridays starting July 13th<br />10 a.m. to 12 noon<br />Limit 10 students (if interest exceeds this number, a second section will be added from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.)<br />$200 per student<br />***<br /><strong>Telling Stories on the Screen<br /></strong>Digital Storytelling<br />for ages 8 and up<br />Telling stories is an innate human activity, so it is no wonder that with the rise of digital technology like cameras and computers our definitions of storytelling has expanded.&nbsp; In this intensive two-week course, students will learn various ways to tell stories using digital technology, such as cameras, flip cams, and computers.&nbsp; Students will start off the workshop by telling a story through images only, then adding narration to a slide show of images, and finally by working with classmates to create a silent movie.&nbsp; In addition to learning and improving various computer skills, students will expand their notion of what it means to tell a story.<br />Monday through Thursday for two weeks (8 sessions total) starting August 6<sup>th<br /></sup>10 a.m. – 12 noon<br />Limit 6 students (if interest exceeds this number, a second section will be added from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.)<br />$250 per student</span></span><span style="font-size: 14px;" class="bbc_size">[/font][/color]<br /><br /><br /></span>[/font]
