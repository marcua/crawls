			<br />Queens Libertarians most often gather at a meeting room at Bohemian Hall. The Brooklyn Chair will join them this Saturday for one of the regular, and open to the public, meetings. He has helped many candidates with ballot access over the years.<br /><br /><br />Bohemian Hall&nbsp; <br />29-19 24th Avenue<br /><br />Saturday, April 10, 2010 at 11:00 a.m. SHARP<br />Independent Nominating Petition process <br /><br />He will speak about challenges that can be filed and how to defend against those challenges. <br />Sample petitions and cover sheets will be handed out.<br /><br />http://ny.lp.org/<br /><br />I am encouraged that SI now has a libertarian chapter. Hopefully some year soon one will be in place in the Bronx.<br /><br />http://serfcity.wordpress.com/2010/03/27/staten-island-finally-secedes/ <br />

			Are the buffalo wings czech? In anycase, they are okay.<br /><br />Heard mention that the NYC charter commission will be meeting again soon.<br /><br />Monday, April 19<br />LaGuardia Community College, Auditorium, 31-10 Thomson Avenue, <br />Long Island City, NY 11101<br />6pm<br /><br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/charter/html/home/home.shtml<br /><br /><br />I think it would be silly and ironic to consider again term limits after the last election. They may want to revisit&nbsp; mayoral succession and if there is a need for public advocate. If the advocate office remains, it should have more autonomy from the mayor&#039;s office.<br /><br />When was the last time there was a vacancy of the mayor&#039;s office?<br /><br /><br />For the LP, it looks like John Clifton of Queens may run again for US Senate.<br />We may have a statewide candidate for attorney general. They may have a candidate for Assembly in another district.<br /><br /><br />How many signatures do the Dems and GOP require?<br /><br />For independents like Libertarian, Green, etc, it apprears that the min signatures needed is 3000 for NY Senate. Others would collect theirs sooner, but indie candidates look to be starting this year July 9.<br />Thank you to all those who help give us more choices this election, to have more reason to vote on election day.<br /><br />Much appreciated. <br />&nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br />Surprised to hear one libertarian may be working with the Census. Consider your questions.<br /><br />http://2010.census.gov/2010census/<br /><br />Natl participation rate is currently about 65% lagging some great lake states.

			<br />In a few weeks, Libertarians will have a new national Chair, and I am curious to see what direction that might mean for the party.<br /><br />Here, the LPNY has an endorsed slate of candidates that will petition this summer again for ballot access.<br />It may not be certain but the expected Dem and GOP candidates would be Cuomo &amp; Lazio. The IP, CP, and WFP would follow those leads.<br /><br />I certainly hope and expect there will be more than the 2 choices. If looking at the main parties, likely would be considering the AG and Comptroller races.<br /><br />NY Libertarian statewide slate<br /><br /><br />Governor: Warren Redlich<br />Lt. Governor: Alden Link<br /><br />Senate (Gillibrand): John Clifton<br />Senate (Schumer): Randy Credico<br /><br />Comptroller: John Gaetani<br />Attorney General: Carl Person<br /><br /><br /><br />
