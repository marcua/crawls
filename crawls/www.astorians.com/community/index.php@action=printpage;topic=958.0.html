				Hello,<br /><br />I work in a Social Service agency. Recently one of our agency nurses was deployed to Louisiana, as you can read below. She just came back this weekend and I spoke to her on Monday about her experience. <br /><br />She feels that after her experience in Louisana, that donating physical goods is still very much needed. &nbsp;She put together the following email while in Louisiana. Her email is as follows.<br /><br />Please pass this onto anyone you feel might be interested.<br />Rosemary<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />HI,<br />As a lot of you may know, I am presently in Louisiana<br />(since last Saturday until Sat 10/15) volunteering.<br />I am working at a Special Needs Shelter, which<br />services evacuees from both Hurricanes Katrina &amp; Rita<br />who have skilled nursing needs, such as residents of<br />nursing homes who were evacuated, dialysis patients,<br />those with disabilities or medical or psychiatric<br />problems, as well as their care givers. &nbsp;The<br />population is around 250, at capacity.<br />The reason I am writing, is if anyone or their job,<br />church, etc, is looking of a place to send donations,<br />they would be gladly accepted here, as this shelter is<br />planning to remain operating for the next 2-3 months,<br />and there are many people here who still only have<br />literally the shirt on their back to wear.<br />The following items could definitely be used here, but<br />the list is by no means exclusive:<br />-mens &amp; women's clothes - ANY sizes, for both warm &amp;<br />cold seasons<br />-men's &amp; women's underwear<br />-socks<br />-toiletries, including shampoo, tooth paste, tooth<br />brushes, brushes, nail files, razors, shave cream, etc<br />-adult diapers/depends<br />-baby wipes<br />-chux pads<br />-latex free gloves<br />-linens, especially blankets, lap robes, &amp; pillow<br />cases<br />-egg crate mattresses, blow up mattresses<br />old wheel chairs, canes, walkers<br />-stuffed animals - for the few children, as well as<br />the elderly here<br />-even cards or drawings by kids to decorate the walls<br />would be nice, because the shelter is set up in a ymca<br />gym<br /><br />The shelter info is:<br /><br />YMCA SPECIAL NEEDS SHELTER<br />2022 FRANK ANDREWS BLVD.<br />ALEXANDRIA, LA<br />71303<br />ATTN: &nbsp;USPHS STAFF/DONATIONS<br /><br />If you'd like to verify the information, the telephone<br /># is 318 767 8828. &nbsp;Feel free to forward this to whom<br />ever you'd like.<br />Hope all is well.<br />Take care,<br />Ginny
