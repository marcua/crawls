				Growing up we only really had one style of pizza (I have no idea what it might be called) and it was only when I got to be older and moved to more urban centers did I learn that there are differences. I like the different regional styles from Italy and have grown to appreciate them, but also sometimes all I really want is just a plain NY slice on a paper plate.

				I agree.&nbsp; With that much crust, you&#039;re really in focaccia territory, which is why IMO what they serve in Chicago isn&#039;t pizza but another entity entirely.

				I love coming here and seeing genuine recommendations like this!&nbsp; &nbsp;:cheesy:&nbsp; There are many things I remember about the time I spent in Rome, but my personal dislike of their pizza is definitely one of them.&nbsp; As for this &quot;chef&quot; who makes &quot;the real pizza from Roma&quot;, the guy at Via VAI who made our pizza could be described in many ways, but I assure you, Italian is not one of them.

				Haven&#039;t tried their food yet, but I like the look of the place and the people inside were very nice when I popped in for a look around. Friends of mine have eaten there a few times now and said that the entrees are excellent. They didn&#039;t try the pizza and I&#039;m nervous to try it now.
