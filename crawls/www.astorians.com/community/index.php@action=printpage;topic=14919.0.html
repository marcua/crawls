				Great pizza place just opened on 34th ave and 31 street.&nbsp; The place is still new, but it&#039;s one of the best pizza experiences I&#039;ve had in NYC.&nbsp; My gf&#039;s pizza was tasty and non-greasy; garlic knots great.&nbsp; I ordered a meatball + penne platter, and it was likewise excellent.&nbsp; Delivery was free.&nbsp; Cannot&nbsp; recommend this place highly enough.<br /><br />http://maps.google.com/maps?rlz=1C1GGLS_enUS291US304&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;q=32-20+34th+Ave,+11106&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;split=0&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=5SoGSs_OAc_Jtgeu3bmSBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1<br /><br /><br />

				Oh sweet! I used to get Lentini&#039;s all the time from the original location on skillman when the DH lived in sunnyside. i still stop by sometimes if im working at Flynn&#039;s or the Gaslight.<br />But I bet they won&#039;t deliver to 46th street even though it&#039;s the same avenue.

				We just got their menu delivered outside our door with a coupon so we decided to keep the oven off tonight and order instead. I have to say I was pretty pleased by the pizza - I consider it on par with Grand Avenue pizza. The sauce was garlicky, but also had a touch of sweetness, and the cheese was quite generous. It wasn&#039;t too greasy. The dough was fresh, but a tad inconsistent. Part of it was nice and crispy and part of it was soft and less cooked. On the whole, however, it hit the spot for delivery pizza. Not on par with Michael Angelo&#039;s or Vesta&#039;s pizza, but I consider those to be in a different realm. As far as good solid delivery pizza goes, I think Lentini&#039;s may be our go-to place from now on, especially given the reasonableness of the prices. An extra-large cheese pie is $11! All in all, I&#039;d recommend checking it out.&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				They are right around the corner from me, so I tried them shortly after they opened.&nbsp; Not a bad pizza, but pretty stingy with the toppings, I was pretty surprised when I ordered a pie with meatballs and got maybe three pieces on the entire large pizza.
