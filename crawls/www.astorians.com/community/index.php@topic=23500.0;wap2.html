			<strong>Debbie</strong>:
			<br />
			As I drove down 31st Street around 6:30-ish pm on Friday, I heard some folks shouting &#039;USA, USA&#039;.&nbsp; As I approached the entrance to the subway, I noticed some people waving a large flag shouting at the cab drivers across the street!&nbsp; I figured it must be due to the recent demonstrations in the Muslim world and these people decided to target the cab drivers.&nbsp; Funny thing is that when I had a close look, I recognized the homeless people who hang around Ditmars.&nbsp; They made up the majority of the demonstrators!&nbsp; The flag looked brand new, so the mystery is was it a real &#039;homeless against Muslim cab drivers&#039; demonstration or was this staged by someone?&nbsp; The reason I was driving around there in the first place was to show an Astoria newcomer the area.&nbsp; Seeing the toothless wonders out there did not really make a very good impression!

			It was actually a couple of guys that came out of the bar waving the flag&nbsp; and then the homeless people joined in the chanting USA USA .
