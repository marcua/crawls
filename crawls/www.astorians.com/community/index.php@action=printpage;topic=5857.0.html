				<br />Not to make light of people who have this condition, but I swear to god the Internet has made me a hypochondriac because of Web MD and other health related websites!&nbsp; Recently, I&#039;ve been experiencing horrible eye aches and neck pains.&nbsp; Both could easily be explained by the way that I sleep (very restless and with crappy pillows that need to be replaced) and the fact that I spend the majority of my day in front of a crappy monitor, staring at the screen.&nbsp; But OH NO! Your boy, Astoria Luv, has determined that according to Web MD, I probably have a brain aneurysm!&nbsp; Now I can&#039;t work because I feel like I should drag my uninsured butt to the nearest emergency room and have this checked out before my aneurysm ruptures.<br /><br />I just needed to vent, but I am wondering if I&#039;m the only one!&nbsp; I called my friend, who is a doctor in Minnesota and he just hung up on me because I relied on the Internet to diagnose myself!&nbsp;

				Aw.&nbsp; Nah, I doubt you are the only one.&nbsp; I think we all use the internet to find out about all kinds of things.&nbsp; It&#039;s both good and bad.&nbsp; I&#039;m often without health insurance and it&#039;s frustrating.&nbsp; I&#039;ve learned to try and stay well by eating better, exercising more often, looking both ways before crossing the street, not getting drunk anymore, not going skiing.&nbsp; I&#039;m in risk aversion mode!!!&nbsp; I look everything up online.&nbsp; Last month, I got health insurance from a job for the first time in a long time!&nbsp; And promptly saw every doctor I needed to see within the span of two weeks!!&nbsp; Health care in this country is truly a joke&nbsp; &nbsp;:-(

				Your neck pain sounds like nothing a good massage couldn&#039;t cure.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve been spending a lot of time in front of the computer, too, and have been using eyedrops for eye dryness.&nbsp; Maybe also try a filter for the glare from the screen?&nbsp; BTW, are you seeing OK or do you need glasses - sometimes that also causes eye pain.<br /><br />Good luck!

				Back in the old days, this used to be called &quot;med student syndrome&quot;! Many med students would be convinced that all of their little aches and pains were signs of XYZ Obscure Cancer and Obscure Neurological Autoimmune Disorder #37. Now, we all get to have that fun!&nbsp; :lol:<br /><br />If you hear hooves, think horses, not zebras.<br />

				perhaps you&#039;re sitting too close to the screen.&nbsp; <br />get an ergonomic chair and try (i said try) not <br />to hunch over the monitor.&nbsp; i know, i know, we <br />all have a tendency to do it.

				I work for a neurologist and also rely on webmd for EVERYTHING.&nbsp; I&#039;ve worked there for 13 years and have managed to come up with a new neurological issue every other year or so.&nbsp; It&#039;s ridiculous.&nbsp; Anywho, I was experiencing eye blinding migraines with associated neck kinks/spasms.&nbsp; I, too, sought out my condition and thought it was possible I had an aneurysm.&nbsp; It was friggin&#039; scary.&nbsp; Ultimately, I went to my boss (hello? neurologist? ahaha) and we managed to pin point what it was.&nbsp; I always do that to myself though so I know where you&#039;re coming from.&nbsp; <br /><br />When I was pregnant?&nbsp; Oh no.&nbsp; You don&#039;t even want to know.&nbsp; lol<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Before the internet, there was the Reader&#039;s Digest Medical Guide. Full of flow charts for hours of hypochondriac indulgence.<br /><br />Once I went to the doctor when I had some strange coating in my mouth and a very sore throat. Did a self-diagnosis and figured out it was oral thrush.<br /><br />Doctor: What makes you think you have oral thrush?!<br />Me: Uhh.....well........the Reader&#039;s Digest Medical Guide.<br />Doctor: Actually, what you have is such-and-such......&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Me:&nbsp; :ugly:<br /><br />The internet just makes it easier to indulge hypochondria.&nbsp; :-P<br />

				I thought I would bring this topic back from the dead since I saw a piece on CNN about self-diagnosing from the Internet.&nbsp; They actually have a term for it: cyberchondiac!&nbsp; The people they interviewed with the condition spent as many as four hours a day trying to figure out what was wrong with them!&nbsp; <br /><br />The irony is that after I watched the feature and learned about the symptons, I am worried that I have this condition and I am now going to do some more indepth self-analysis regarding my new illness.
