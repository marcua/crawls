				O.k., let me start this thing [don&#39;t be shy]:<br /><br />Hi, my name is [zen] Hi [zen] and I am (at the moment) dependant on two (2) chemicals (alcohol (http://www.merl.com/people/frisken/molecule_alcohol.gif) &quot;CH<span style="font-size: 7px;" class="bbc_size">3</span>CH<span style="font-size: 7px;" class="bbc_size">2</span>OH&quot;&nbsp; &amp; nicotine (http://www.worldofmolecules.com/disease/nicotine.gif) &quot; C<span style="font-size: 7px;" class="bbc_size">10</span>H<span style="font-size: 7px;" class="bbc_size">14</span>N<span style="font-size: 7px;" class="bbc_size">2</span>&quot; ) to an unhealthy degree. After a year of abstinence from the former and a month of abstinence from the latter, I have foolishly made a conscious and willful decision to take up again these two unhealthy and self-destrucitve habits. <br /><br />By imbibing alcohol, my home life, my job (and finances), my social interactivity, my health and my self-respect has suffered.<br /><br />By imbibing nicotine: all of the above has suffered, most of all my health and if I can see into the future... my longevity.<br /><br />My plan is to quit (nicotine) forever and reduce my alcohol intake to a moderate degree... iow &quot;once in a blue moon&quot;. If I cannot acomplish this plan of moderate drinking (anyone bored yet?) then I have a back up plan to eliminate alcohol from my life forever. This is an extreme measure that I am not willing or desirous to take at the moment... though I am imagining now the implications of such an act and by no means am ruling it out (but I repeat).<br /><br />Although these two substances are a part of my life now, I do have a long history of addiction since my early teen years... Gambling, sex, sugar, fast-food poison, et alii. These other addictions I believe I have conquered to a satisfactory degree, although at times I find myself thinking about them. These urges are easily conquered but dangerous neverthless.<br /><br />I have experimented with various recovery groups (12-Step) and Rational Recovery, but have found them wanting as far as being a cure. I have been able to take a little of each though and incorporate them into my world-view and I think that this is a good thing. I don&#39;t believe that talking about my addiction or even support from others will cure me of it, but it does seem to help me knowing that I am not alone on embarking on this difficult road.<br /><br />I have come to believe that recovery is a process... but I have no evidence of this. I do believe that many &quot;addicts&quot; have quit &quot;cold-turkey&quot; successfully and were just as every bit entrenched in their addiction as the next gal or guy.<br /><br />I don&#39;t believe that &quot;character defects&quot; or &quot;morality and ethics&quot; have anything to do with my recovery. I have seen ethically horrid people who have never made &quot;amends&quot; recover successfully, while &quot;Saints&quot; that I had the pleasure of knowing, have gone down the proverbial tubes.<br /><br />That&#39;s all I got right now. But let me issue a caution on the off chance that anyone out there decides to quit alcohol decides to quit cold-turkey and is not knowledgable about the effects of this drug.<br /><br /><strong>WARNING:</strong> Quitting alcohol cold-turkey is a serious matter and should not be done unless under medical supervision. Withdrawal from sudden cessation of alcohol can lead to <strong>Seizures</strong> and <strong>Death</strong>! If one decides to quit alone it is advisable (in my humble opinion) to ween oneself off of it gradually unless otherwise directed by a knowledgable physician. It is always advisable [imnsho] to consult a private doctor when quitting.<br /><br />===============================================<br /><br /><strong>Info.org:</strong> I found this radio show http://www.antimeme.org/ informative. And although not directly related to recovery from substance abuse, it does help bring the whole Corporate aspect of addiction into the mix... well, I guess yet more reasons to quit smoking, drinking or eating fast foods, consuming toxic medicines and/or cosmetics etc. etc.&nbsp; Also a good introduction to logical fallacies and &quot;Self-Jamming&quot;.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18px;" class="bbc_size">AntiMeme Radio</span><br />Antimeme Episode 1 - Blackspotting<br />Antimeme Episode 2 - Fallacies<br />Antimeme Episode 3 - Self-Jamming<br />Antimeme Episode 4 - Re: Corpo Influence<br />Antimeme Episode 5 - Holidays<br />Antimeme Episode 6 - Art<br />Antimeme Episode 7 - Logic Basics<br />Antimeme Episode 8 - Laugh Tracks<br /><br /><br />Peace Out V,<br />[zen] &quot;having alot of personal things to work out&quot; :-)<br /><br />[Later:]<br />[zen&#39;s Other] &quot;Like what?&quot;<br />[zen] &quot;The normal things, such as interpersonal relationships, alcoholism and Poverty.

[After 11 days] This lapse in judgement had to do with socializing (as opposed to medicating frustration or depression, or physical withdrawel). Will try again later on in the week or early next week.<br />BJC#00002: After 3 days... emo. &amp; s.o. &amp; sleep wtdrw &amp; fin strs &amp; wrk &amp; over intl stm &amp; bck pns....etc. This looks like it&#39;s going to be a long and winding process.<br />BJC#00003: Can&#39;t really remember.<br />BJC#00004: After 5-6 days sober broke down and bought a 32oz. light beer...which I&#39;m nursing right now. Significant factors include excitability&nbsp; (or excess energy), work (staying up all night), overtiredness (judgment) which initiated a powerful craving. My only fear is that after finishing this one I will crave and through further suppression of judgement will obtain another. Will try again tommorrow. Must say that the 6 days dry felt great.<br />It has been suggested that either excercise or even a daily walk would mitigate the excess energy/excitability. This always happens to me when I try to quit... I am suddenly imbued with more energy than I feel equipped to deal with and hence loose sleep... and then feel the need to take myself down artificially, in order to &quot;normalize&quot;. Not a very comfortable state of existence.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 7pt;" class="bbc_size">BJC#00005: <del>This is a strange one and actually hasn&#39;t happened yet.

				In this post I&#39;ll attempt to explore the ramifications of smoking, the conspiracies that have addicted (millions?) to a substance that has been proven to cause death, and the personal responsibilty involved in resisting this destructive habit as well as my own personal experiences with this battle. It would be nice if other people who have had problems with this substance could find the time to add their input on this particular health crisis.<br /><br />I am looking for possible solutions or tips on kicking the habit, scientific information from those that understand medicine, personal experiences, legalistic implications from those that understand Law, historical information and information on the various corporate bodies that make their livlihood in spreading misery and suffering, governmental organizations that either seek to inhibit or encourage the industry, or any other constructive input.<br /><br />This topic has already been discussed on this board under the topic of Smoking http://astorians.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=823&amp;highlight=smoking which is a great start and I encourage people to add to this. I will be taking a more recovery oriented slant on this topic in this post which I will add to from time to time. So by all means post here or post there until all that are concerned have Exausted this topic... which still has yet to be fully explored. For those non-smokers out there who are judgemental towards those that smoke (or me personally) I implore you to think about the people in your life that you love and respect that have fallen prey to this addiction and try and show some compassion for the remainder of the human race that is so afflicted. We do, after all, come from the same Source.<br /><br /><strong>Personal:</strong> &quot;Am I weak or have I been overpowered?&quot;<br /><em>Nicotine Journal</em> or &quot;Learn from other&#39;s mistakes&quot; or &quot;How I am trying to avoid Cancer&quot;:<br /><span style="font-size: 9px;" class="bbc_size">Log entry#00001: Went one day &amp; ~ 1/2... due to financial consid... Gained back my sense of smell...temporarily.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 9px;" class="bbc_size">Log entry#00002: Today had two (2) cigarettes. Took a Tylenol for the excruciating headache. Only fell asleep once today... the weird kind of chemically unbalanced kind of sleep that narcoleptics may experience... this effect was not nearly as bad as a few days ago when I was forced to stop smoking for a day and a half.<br />Thinking about the possible stupidity of this log on a public forum, but then again if it helps one person to quit or reduce the influx of toxic chemicals then it will have been worth it. Going to move the journal to the smoking topic. Done. Am thinking about a book that someone mentioned to me called &quot;Confessions of Zeno&quot; which ironically enough was about someone who decided to quit smoking and became obsessed with &quot;the last cigarette&quot;... have to read that book. In addition to regaining my sense of smell I am experiencing a phenomenon that I&#39;ll call <em>time dilation</em>. This is the curious impression that time is moving by more slowly and therefor one can get more things done within the same space of time. I fell asleep for what seemed like hours but noticed that only one hour had passed. I sat to work at the computer and noticed that it was 19:53... After getting alot done and thinking that alot of time had passed I had noticed that the clock said 19:58. After some thought I have decided that if (or more realistically <em>when</em> I start actively smoking again... that is the next time I have a cigarette, I will label such an event a CorporateVictory and then a number. I feel I should respond to the &quot;smoking complaints?&quot; topic but something about it rubs me the wrong way.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 9px;" class="bbc_size">Log entry#00003: Today was difficult but rewarding, got alot done. Unfortunately the intense craving hasn&#39;t let up yet nor the throbbing headache. What disturbs me more however is the &quot;addictive voice&quot; in the back of my head that is <em>consistently</em> planning, scheming and grabbing onto any excuse to smoke, whether that excuse be in the present, past or future.. To tell you the truth I don&#39;t feel that confident in my ability to resist. It&#39;s actually a good thing that I&#39;m poor right now, as this gives me even more incentive to quit. The Imminent Eclipse of Human Rights in America is also not very conductive to an empowering sort of mood.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 9px;" class="bbc_size">Log entry#00004: This is it; a Corporate Victory (CV) is imminent. Financial stress and irritabilty + craving that has climbed to a new scale of elevation have me reaching for that one &quot;Emergency&quot; cigarette. Will he do it?</span><br /><span style="font-size: 9px;" class="bbc_size">Log entry#00005: Well, much time has passed since the above failure. Now, I am in the &quot;reduce&quot; stage and plan to make a clean break at a certain date next month at a set date (to allow myself a block of free time in order to cope with withdrawals.) This time, it&#39;s a little different. I have a compact with an outside source (a good friend) who will reward me with a computer if I achieve 30 days nicotine free (in effect quitting). If I succeed, it could be argued that he effectively helped save my life. What a feeling that must be... to save someone&#39;s life.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 9px;" class="bbc_size">Log entry#00006: Well, here we go. This should be interesting</span><br /><span style="font-size: 9px;" class="bbc_size">Log entry#00007: Well, I am in right now what some recoverists call the &quot;honeymoon phase&quot;. That is I feel great and am gaining confidence in myself and my decision to remain sober and smoke free. While some would say that it is dangerous to trust these feelings and that one must ever remain vigilant and not rest on one&#39;s laurels because the &quot;disease&quot; is always there, lurking, ready to pounce as soon as one lets one&#39;s guard down, I do not subscribe to this opinion. The way I feel now is a natural outcome of choosing life over death, health over poison, honesty in dealing with my long supressed emotions in all their undiluted and at times disturbing glory. Security and comfort is for the birds and the oppressed, and one of the main reasons that set me on this path was a desire to break away from slavedom. Let&#39;s hope it lasts.</span><br /><br /><div><strong>24 HOUR COUNT: [48:08:47] <span style="font-size: 5pt;" class="bbc_size">Legend=days:hours:minutes</span> Count-up clock coming soon!

				Hi, I'm glad you found the show (antimeme) informative. &nbsp;I personally don't smoke or drink due to observing others, though I don't look down on the people that do. &nbsp;I would call myself straight edge, but I don't really want to be associated with the group (most of them aren't very nice).<br /><br />I have actually considered doing an episode on drugs. &nbsp;I would be interested in covering the tobacco industry. &nbsp;But also discussing why alcohol is much more legal than marijuana (since alcohol is debatably more damaging to one self and easily others). &nbsp;My personal opinion is that it is very easy to produce ones own pot vs. alcohol, so pot isn't a good business model. &nbsp;Though I'm sure there are other theories.<br /><br />Do you have any good sources (for research) to point me at (to get started)?

				Again, I am honored that you have joined us and responded to our humble forum... <br />(iow I'm thrilled &nbsp;and just a tad nervous :oops: &nbsp;)<br /><br />As far as background research on tobacco &amp; drugs, I believe that I can help you, if only on an experiential level. This subject is so overwhelming and pervasive that it would take think tanks x100 to unravel.<br /><br />Some of the sources that I've found informative (although there are always many ways to look at them) are:<br /><br />the movie &quot;The Insider&quot; (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0140352/) which I found to be pretty disturbing, only because it seemed so real. This was based on a real case, which I remember going on but didn't actually read &nbsp;the whole story.<br /><br />Michael Moore's &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; series... I think it was episode 3 (4/25/99) &quot;VOICE-BOX CHOIR&quot; where Mr. Moore led a group of tracheotomy victims into one of Phillip Morris's building to sing some Christmas Carols in appreciation for all that that company has done.<br /><br />&quot;The Book of Grass: An Anthology on Indian Hemp&quot; by George Andrews was a teenage favorite and is good for some history of hemp through the ages. Alibris ID: 1510267662<br /><br />Drug Policy Foundation http://www.drugpolicy.org/homepage.cfm has always been a good source concerning the political scene concerning drugs and prohibition.<br /><br />&quot;Reefer Madness&quot; is a must see for all those who are fans of erroneous and blatant propaganda.<br />http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028346/<br />http://www.reefermadness.org/propaganda/prop.html<br />http://www.reefermadness.org/<br /><br /><br />DuPont versus hemp connection... I'll say no more out of fear.<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />NORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) http://www.norml.org/ is also a good source as well as High Times Magazine (http://www.hightimes.com/ht/home/) although I must confess I still believe that cannabis is still bad for the body and mind and I personally find the euphoria surrounding the use of this drug childish and ill-informed. A drug is a drug is a drug... and yet I am still strongly adverse to people dictating to me what vices I can or cannot indulge in.<br /><br />Another sensationalized and maybe fictionalized book on the Crack-Cocaine conspiracy that I still found very informative as well as well-written [forgot title for the moment...stay tuned]<br /><br />http://tamara-inscoe-johnson.com/work2.htm<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Lehder<br /><br />http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1190 (Very scary)<br />http://www.davidicke.net/tellthetruth/conspiracy/bushcocaine.html<br /><br />More on this:<br />The movie and book &quot;Blow&quot; &amp;<br />&quot;Traffic&quot; &amp; &quot;New Jack City&quot; also &quot;The French Connection&quot;<br /><br />The book &quot;The Underground Empire -Where Crime and Governments Embrace&quot; by James Mills Doubleday, New York, 1986<br />Excerpt:<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> &quot;[Page 3:] The inhabitants of the earth spend more money on illegal drugs than they spend on food. More than they spend on housing, clothes, education, medical care, or any other product or service. The international narcotics industry is the largest growth industry in the world. Its annual revenues exceed half a trillion dollars -- three times the value of all United States currency in circulation, more than the gross national products of all but a half dozen of the major industrialized nations. To imagine the immensity of such wealth consider this: A million dollars in gold would weigh as much as a large man. A half-trillion dollars would weigh more than the entire population of Washington, D.C.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This book is the schiz-nitz as well as the book...<br /><br />&quot;By Way of Deception&quot; written by an ex-Mossad agent (Victor Ostrovsky) who also has the distinction of having a price on his head.<br /><br />also a classic for all the junkies out there &quot;Drugstore Cowboy&quot; and All the works of William S. Borroughs (who predicted that a &quot;War on Drugs&quot; would be waged as a pretext for the initialization of a Global Police infrastructure.<br /><br />Timothy Leary and Robert Anton Wilson are also great sources (the former may being just a tad twisted maybe)...and the latter far more down to earth and scientific IMHO.<br /><br />as well as the novel by Tom Wolf (who, btw never did LSD before writing his book on th Merry Pranksters...&quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot; ISBN 0-552-99366-2<br /><br />The movies and recordings of Cheech and Chong (for more humorous but neverthless insightful and in depth views of Hippy &amp; drug culture)<br /><br />Arlo Gutherie's Alice's Restaurant (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064002/) is also a classic as well as a personal favorite.<br /><br />...Well, I hope this helps... it's been awhile since I ruminated about such things (excepting my problematic recovery of course). Perhaps during the week I will get the time to put together a more comprehensive list of sources and information. [...more to come...]<br /><br />Cheers,<br />-zeno/-cf

				Even better, let me know if you would be interested in being the &quot;expert guest&quot; on the episode.<br /><br />On another note, I agree that pot isn't good for the system, but I also don't see it as black and white either, media paints it as evil. &nbsp;I don't see it as good, but I don't see it as the thing that funds terrorism either (They actually had anti-drug commercials insinuate that). &nbsp;On a personal note, I don't smoke it. &nbsp;I just find it interesting that alcohol, something arguably more dangerous, is so much more socially acceptable.<br /><br />By the way, are you going to HOPE this year? &nbsp;I'm not an expert on NY, but isn't Astoria just across the water from Manhattan?

				Hi,<br /><br />While I would love to participate on your show I don't really think that the term <em>expert </em>would apply to me. My information comes from being an end-user and my scientific knowledge of these substances is negligible. I'll give it a shot though if you think that I can contribute, as long as you coach me through the process. I am very interested in radio in fact, but have never participated in it. Perhaps with your help I can overcome my fear.<br /><br />As far as all this &quot;funding terrorism&quot; by buying a bag of weed nonsense I can't agree with you more. This is nothing but propaganda, and I think that your reasoning concerning the economics behind the whole thing is correct. Cannabis is a <em>weed</em> &nbsp;and will grow almost anywhere, wheras alcohol has an infrastructure of control surrounding the process and distribution of it. http://www.atf.gov/ Did you ever see the sci-fi series The Lexx? :-) In that show the ATF was the most powerful organization on the planet!<br /><br />It would be interesting to research prohibition and why that didn't work. In the case of pot... it <em>did</em> work. Perhaps many of the popular beliefs that are held by people against this drug stem from that era. Marijuana (although not particularly good for the body) is far less dangerous than alcohol. I have never heard of anyone having a seizure or dying from withdrawal from it. Alcoholic seizures otoh are common. And while it has been shown that cannabis inhalation does in fact affect reaction time and concentration while operating a vehicle it is no where near as deleterious (imho) as driving while drunk, which kills many many people every year. Just out of curiosity, I wonder if the ratio of drunk driving deaths in other countries is similar or different than they are here.<br /><br />I really don't think that prohibition of Mary Jane has anything to do with health or the &quot;common good&quot;. Look at the prescription drug empires and how many people are addicted to &quot;legitimate&quot; drugs prescribed by doctors and psychiatrists. I think this whole thing is about money and control, and the reason that people find alcohol socially acceptable while cannabis criminal is because T.V. tells them so. Do you think that the message: &quot;If you smoke pot you support terrorism&quot; qualifies as a meme? I have actually encountered many people who think that this is a valid proposition post commercial (which I found very disturbing).<br /><br />Oh yes! HOPE or bust! I'm new to the scene so I'm real excited about attending this one. The Hotel Pennsylvania is just a short subway ride away, but I would like to stay on the premises during the event. Let me know if you're ever in town or if I can do anything to facilitate your stay here during the conference.

				I don't think expert would apply to me either (as my critiques would point out &nbsp;:) ). &nbsp;In a way, I'm new to the radio thing too, it's definately a learning experience.<br /><br />I probably wouldn't be doing to drug one for a while, since I kind of have a list of the ones I was planning on doing allready:<br />(<br />I would like to get dual on the next ep and talk about the music industry<br />I plan on doing another logic ep; logical inferences<br />I am also planning on doing an ep on laugh tracks soon too.<br />)<br />When the time comes though, the offer still stands. &nbsp;There's not much to fear regarding the show either, whatever we mess up can always be edited.<br /><br />Also, see you at HOPE.<br /><br />P.S.<br />Welcome to the phx2600 forums

				Thanks again XlogicX,<br /><br />Doing a show later on in the season on drugs will give me time to do some research and study...and hopefully conquer my own &quot;addictions&quot;, as well as improve on my communication skills (which are sadly wanting at the moment).<br /><br />Wow, Laughing Tracks! That is one disturbing topic XlogicX! One that has always bothered me when I found out that the laughter was fake. It made me think of television in a whole new way. What bothers me to know end is when genuinely funny tv shows or series are forced to use canned laughter by the networks because the networks don't trust the consumer's intelligence to &quot;get&quot; the jokes. Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy (BBC) is a case in point and thank my lucky stars they abandoned the idea.<br /><br />Again, call me anytime and I look forward to meeting you at HOPE!<br />Peace Brother,<br />Zeno<br /><br />P.S.: Dual rules! and the listening public (myself especially) needs more episodes on Logic. Props &amp; thanks for the welcome.

				Sorry for speaking off topic rene0226 but HOPE stands for 'Hackers on Planet Earth' which is a conference that is held in NYC every two years at the Hotel Pennsylvania. There have been five so far and &quot;Hope Number Six&quot; is taking place in 2006 on July 21, 22 &amp; 23.<br /><br />Everyone is welcome regardless of interest or expertise, and I think that many come not only for information (which varies in abundance from the heavily technical to the outright political or cultural) but also to have a good time... and from what I've heard in all probability rip-roaringly. I've never been to one myself so it will be a unique experience. It would be nice if we could get a bunch of people from Astoria to go this year (2006) and see what this is all about.<br /><br />You can find more information here: &nbsp;http://www.the-fifth-hope.org/book/book-of-hope-01.html

				Glad to see that communicating online about alchol and cigarettes can be helpful. &nbsp;If I can contribute by saying to Zeno, that it may be hard to slow down on alcohol and quit smoking at the same time. &nbsp;In order to achieve your goals, perhaps you can try one goal first such as slowing down on alcohol. &nbsp;I used to smoke about a pack a day. &nbsp;I thought about quitting along time before I finally did. &nbsp;I had pneumonia, and instead of getting colds I would get Asthmatic Bronchitis. &nbsp;I quit. &nbsp;My dad kept saying, Great, another day without cigarettes. &nbsp;I did eat a lot of hard candy and was short tempered for a while. &nbsp;I did have alot of dental work. &nbsp;But it was worth it to quit. I don't drink to much. &nbsp;I have acid reflux, so lately I get sick, sometimes a reflux attack, if I drink. &nbsp;<br /><br />One thing that is difficult is food. &nbsp;It has been the hardest thing for me to conquer: eating out of mouth hunger, when I am not hungy, but want food. For the past year, I have really been working on my issues with food. <br /><br />I hope my post is helpful.

				Thanks Solange!<br /><br />This is starting to feel like a real recovery group!<br /><br />I just wanted to restate that this &quot;group&quot; is open to all, regardless of addiction (or non-addiction) ... and food can also qualify as a debilitating addiction. I also value XlogicX's input highly and although he neither drinks or smokes his input is valuable for his non-judgmental and constructive observations. Berating a smoker or heroin addict will not help solve the problem... and as far as the second-hand smoke debate... well... I feel the same way whenever a car passes by and I'm forced to breathe in carbon monoxide and fumes. But this is something that I live with. It is all part of living in the Postmodern Age.<br /><br />In life, many things can be considered addictions... from emotional addictions, to shopping or to any other obsessive pathological behavior harmful to the self. I hate to say it... but even knowledge can be an addiction. It all comes to a question of balance. I think that mistakes have been made in the past that tend to lump all groups of different addictions together and assuming that all had a unifying solution or panacea disregarding the different characteristics of the various substances and behaviors. But more on this later when I have the energy.... it is a long and tiresome debate.<br /><br />In my experience however I have found that it <em>does</em> help to have people to talk to and share information with. Since writing this post my blood pressure has in all probability been reduced significantly. Where I diverge from alot of other recovery movements is that there <em>has</em> to be a reliance on groups and meetings. This phenomenon is known to people who study under the SMART school of recovery as the <em>external locus of control</em> versus the <em>internal locus of control</em>... or in other words, &quot;I am incapable of helping myself&quot; versus &quot;I and I alone can take charge of my life.&quot;<br />I'm not saying that either method is better or worse, and of course the true test is whether a particular method works for the individual.<br /><br />I recently saw the movie &quot;What the Bleep Do We Know?&quot; (http://www.whatthebleep.com/) and found their treatment of addiction very informative and scientific... to which paradigm I presently subscribe to.<br />Keep working at it all! I believe that freedom <em>can</em> be found in this life and the solution may reside in something as simple as changing the way we think about a thing.<br /><br />Still in Occlusion and spellbound by Maya,<br />----ZenCFOS Subcortical Architecture Model#9 <em>v.</em>12.1

				I am glad my post was appreciated. &nbsp;I agree that berating a person does not help. &nbsp;However, do you think it may be an expression of the individual's limited perception of the persons problem &nbsp;or the feeling that what you do may cause uncomfortable feelings for others. &nbsp;For instance, I have reflux. &nbsp;I saw a GI (Gastrointestinal) Doctor and he said &quot; You have to lose weight&quot; &nbsp;No one knows more than me that I have to lose weight. &nbsp;But, where is the perception. &nbsp;Could the doctor have said ,&quot; What are you doing to address your over eating or weight problem.&quot; &nbsp;I think I will be proactive and say I know I am overweight and I am working hard with a Nutritionist to address this. &nbsp;If I say this from the get go, I feel like I am advocating for myself. &nbsp;<br /><br />Thanks for listening. &nbsp;I am on a very restrictive food plan because of allergies and reflux and I am taking it one day at a time. &nbsp;I have renewed my efforts to write down what I eat, my mood and so forth. &nbsp;I am just concentrating on this weekend, where I will create new foods. &nbsp;<br /><br />I will let you know how it works out. &nbsp;<br /><br />Solange

				Hey, I'm addicted to food and sleep.<br /><br />I just try to ask myself if this harms myself or others before I make a decision. &nbsp;Of course it's not always that easy, but it is an ideal that I try to shoot for. &nbsp;If I miss, that's ok, as long as I don't forget what I'm shooting for.<br /><br />As far as the food thing goes, the Hackers Diet is a really good read. &nbsp;It was written by the developer of AutoDesk. &nbsp;One thing that is helpful in conjunction with that (for me) is to take a nightly walk. &nbsp;Not only is this my form of meditation, but it has its health benefits too (increase of metabolism, expends calories, decreases stress).

				Thanks xLogicx for the reference to the book. It looks very interesting. For anyone else out there you can find it online here (http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/hackdiet.html)<br /><br />You wrote:<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hey, I'm addicted to food and sleep. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />That's very interesting... I had the same addiction (to sleep) awhile back, and I'm not sure exactly why. Most people told me it was depression, which I guess at times it was. But at the same time my body seemed to need the long hours of complete Delta. I was also fascinated with the REM state and dreams in general... particularly the phenomenon labeled 'astral projection' which I nightly excercised at will... exploring the subconscious Realm consciously; Lucid dreaming, etc.<br /><br />After awhile, I stopped doing this though because I was getting too fascinated by some of the powerful and all-consuming Archetypes of the Unconscious and felt I was being engulfed in that Sea. Also, some rogue complexes (splintered or supressed aspects of my personality) wandering around in my psyche were also quite disturbing and scary to look upon so I made a conscious decision to &quot;close the door&quot; after I had dealt with the more troubling of them. Unfortunately my shut off valve to that World (a known &amp; proven inhibitor) was alcohol. So here I am... in Occlusion, struggling with demons of which I am only dimly aware. I feel that there is some form of synthesis available now, however... as time and some experience have enabled me to deal with some of these enigmas which have plagued humanity since the beginning of time.<br /><br />Astral Projection, Oliver Fox<br />(The first book I read on the subject. Even though much in this book is nonsense let us remember that Oliver Fox was working independently. I have found that when he relates his experiences these are useful... but as soon as he starts theorizing he kind of looses me.

				Heh, I've actually read Lucid Dreaming by Stephen Laberge.<br /><br />When I said that I'm addicted to food and sleep, i didn't mean dangerously addicted, it was actually kind of a joke of perspective.<br /><br />I eat and sleep normally, but it could be argued that if I refrained from either, I would get some nasty withdrawal symptoms

				You've read LaBerge? I wonder what the chances of that are :o. Well, I guess at one time it was a popular book. Did you ever read John C. Lilly? That guys a trip; they actually made a feature based loosely on him called Altered States. He was into dolphins and isolation tanks. Pretty cool... I always wanted to build one.<br /><br />Withdrawel from sleep and food? I guess the same could be said for oxygen! I wonder how much of the malady of 'addiction' is arbitrarily defined. I like that guy Trimpey's take on the whole thing,, that substance abuse is a real problem but has had the &nbsp;undesired effect of spawning a Leviathan which he dubs the American Treatment Industry.<br /><br />Now off to non-sleep! ciao.
