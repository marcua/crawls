And no, it&#039;s not a plan b dive bar. Creehan&#039;s is a plan b dive bar (but I love it) Sparrow is something else entirely.

I also assumed it was more of a dive-y bar, not so much for food—and boy is that wrong! <br /><br /><br />We shared the pork tacos to start. AMAZING. Tender, flavorful and smokey. <br />I had the duck (came with roasted asparagus and mashed potatoes), and he had the chicken pot pie. Both were wonderful. Chicken pot pie is a dish that can have a tendency to become very bland, but Sparrow&#039;s was very nicely seasoned throughout. No need to add salt.<br /><br /><br />Blueberry creme brûlée for dessert. Perfect way to end the meal.

				A couple of weeks ago we had the tacos with a homemade lamb sausage.&nbsp; It was a bit hot and spicy.&nbsp; Really outstanding.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s a special or not.&nbsp; The food is consistently good and the people are very welcoming.&nbsp; I actually don&#039;t mind the bathroom and like the sink being outside the W/C.&nbsp; It think they run a clean operation but enjoy having that bohemian look that can appear unkempt, but really isn&#039;t.

				I&#039;ve been wanting to try Sparrow for a while now, but I have a 3-year-old, and it didn&#039;t seem like an appropriate place to bring him.&nbsp; Any thoughts on whether it might be okay to bring a kid (brunch or early dinner, obviously not prime dinner or late night bar time!)

				Actually I&#039;ve seen people bringing their kids there. Now keep in mind that it&#039;s also a bar, so i am not sure whether it&#039;s a good idea to bring a 3 year old there. Plus i don&#039;t think they have a kids friendly menu.

				i was there Saturday night from about 7:30-9. there was a table near us with two kids - looked older than 3 though.<br /><br />real good food, service was a little slow though. they were very nice and accommodating, just not enough people to go around.<br />
