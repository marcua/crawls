				Looks like ACI (conservative temple on Crescent) is making a come-back-to life. <br />We checked it out years ago and found most of the members to be in their 70s, 80s and probably older.&nbsp; <br />There&#039;s a new rabbi (Rabbi Pearl) and he&#039;s doing his darndest to breathe life back into the place - and I have to say - YEAH!!!<br /><br />Yesterday we went to their first Tot Shabbat (it&#039;s like a mommy and daddy and me for an intro to Jewish culture and celebration of Shabbat) and there were 9 little ones there!! That&#039;s 7 more kids than have been in the temple in probably 30 years or more.&nbsp; The congregation has been around for over 75 years and it will be wonderful if it comes back to life enough to be a significant cultural institution in the neighborhood.&nbsp; <br /><br />First a synagogue - next thing you know maybe there will be smoked white fish, chopped liver, kugel, gifilte fish, challah and shmaltz available at the markets.&nbsp; After that - Purim might be a big hit at the beer garden.&nbsp; <br /><br />They&#039;re organizing events aimed at 20s, 30s and families with children.&nbsp; Check out their events page:<br />http://www.astoriacenter.org/events.htm<br /><br />Tot Shabbat will be a monthly event - usually held the first Saturday of the month.&nbsp; The next one is next week Nov 6th from 10:45 - 11:30.&nbsp; <br />

				Thanks for posting, Jennifer!&nbsp; It was great to see everyone last Saturday, and we&#039;ll be back this coming Saturday for sure.&nbsp; It&#039;s great to see the congregation growing and hopefully more families will be showing up.
