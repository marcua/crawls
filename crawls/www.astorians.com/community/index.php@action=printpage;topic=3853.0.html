				Is it just me, or is service still getting slower and less reliable.&nbsp; Yesterday and today, I watched as 4 (today) and 6 (yesterday) trains went towards Ditmars with no train headed towards Manhattan.&nbsp; When the train finally does come, it&#39;s packed and everyone is in a bad mood, no one can fit, and everyone is shoving in.&nbsp; What is up with them? Is is just bad management skills, poor planning, holding trains until every single berth at Astoria Boulevard and Ditmars is full or just sheer spite?

				Trains have been slow this, although I noticed when I was on around 9am today that it was running much better than M-W of this week.&nbsp; And I heard the delicious words &quot;this train is running express to Queensboro Plaza&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;I had a lovely commute today!

Uggghhh...I guess I am one of the luckier ones though, the Q101 stops right near me, so I could always take that down Steinway to Broadway rather than dealing with the shuttles and take the R in.

				Be warned that the Manhattan-bound R trains have been running express from Roosevelt Av to Queens Plaza during weekends for quite some time <br /><br />Per MTA, for service from 65 St, Northern Blvd, 46, Steinway, and 36 Sts, take a Queens-bound E or R to Roosevelt Av and transfer to a Manhattan-bound E or R. <br /><br />too bad waiting for that queens bound train takes up time and ends up feeling like time wasted

				Hmmmm...how&#39;s the M60 to Manhattan on the weekend? I&#39;d walk down 31st street to Astoria Blvd, it&#39;d be an extra 10 minutes, but whatever. I looked at the bus schedule (pdf file) (http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us/nyct/bus/schedule/manh/m060cur.pdf), and it looks like its pretty quick once you&#39;re on the bus. Of course, there could be gobs of traffic on the bridge. And the schedule says there&#39;s a bus every 10-15 minutes...is this fairly accurate? I usually avoid buses, so I&#39;m not sure if they really stick to any kind of a schedule - I don&#39;t really care if one will be there at whatever minute, but if the schedule calls for a bus every 10 minutes...is there really one every 10 minutes?<br /><br />Anyway - assuming there isn&#39;t ridiculous traffic on the bridge, and assuming that the busses do come every X minutes, do you guys think it would be worth it for us upper Astoria folk to do that? For the record, I head to the Union Square area, so I&#39;d be hopping on the 4/5 at Lex &amp; 125th. Or should I just suck it up and jump on a shuttle?<br /><br />Ugh, whatever, either way this stinks.

Waiting time varies a lot. Once you&#39;re on the bus, getting over the bridge is generally painless. It&#39;s the wait that can be annoying, especially when you wait for a really long time and the bus finally arrives and it&#39;s PACKED. I&#39;ve had some decent trips on it, though. I guess you could wait for both that and the N shuttle at the same time, since I would guess they&#39;d be stopping near the same place.

				I think the Q101 goes up Steinway and then Northern Blvd.&nbsp; Think it ends up at Lex and 59th?&nbsp; I&#39;m also guessing it stops at QBPlaza<br /><br />I&#39;ve taken the Q19A and it doesn&#39;t suck as bad as you&#39;d think.&nbsp; It goes Ditmars to 21st Street to QBPlaza.&nbsp; I took it during OHNY and it was pretty convenient.<br /><br />There&#39;s a bus that goes up and down 31st Ave, too.<br /><br />M60 is fine or hellish, all depending on traffic on the weekend.&nbsp; I find that there can be awful traffic then, so I tend to stay away from it.&nbsp; But if you have to be above 125th Street, it&#39;s certainly an option.<br /><br />I guess the shuttle buses will just stop at the subway stops, so it shouldn&#39;t be so bad.&nbsp; It is more of a PIA than usually, but it&#39;s only for a couple days.&nbsp; I wonder what kind of work they&#39;re going to be doing on the tracks.

				They did this shuttle bus weekend thing a few years ago.&nbsp; If I remember correctly it was 3 weekends in a row.&nbsp; I think the busses all ran from ditmars, making every stop.&nbsp; You can imagine what it was like by 30th ave and broadway.&nbsp; People couldn&#39;t get on.&nbsp; &nbsp;I hope they have dedicated busses for each stop this time.&nbsp; Hopefully, the r will be running and I&#39;m glad to live near that too as back up.

				Where did you see it was dedicated busses for each stop? I looked but just saw a list of the stops.&nbsp; Last time, that&#39;s what the busses did, run straight under the tracks stopping at each normal subway stop on the way.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, the r does seem to be running normally that weekend, so at least the people farther along have easy access to that.&nbsp; Still, I feel bad for people with halloween plans who have to choose if going is worth the hassle.

				just to bitch about the R in general...<br />has anyone noticed that for the past few weeks, especially the last 3 days, the train has just crawled between stations? for no apparant reason? i mean i could walk from steinway to 36th street and back in the time it&#39;s taking to get from station to station. i&#39;ve been having to leave 10 minutes earlier in the morning so that i can barely make it to work on time. the past three mornings it has been &quot;train traffic up ahead&quot; funny because i just waited 10 minutes. or the ever ambiguous &quot;signal problems ahead&quot; Fix the damn signals so that we can go on with our commute to our miserable jobs. <br />Arrrrrgh!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; :ticked: :ticked: :ticked:<br /><br />back to your regularly scheduled programming....

				I took the M-60 into Manhattan today- I was about to climb the steps at the Astoria Blvd. subway, when I saw the bus right there, so I thought what the hell.&nbsp; I would never do it during rush hour, but this was at about 10:25.&nbsp; I got to 125th and Lex in 13 minutes, and I caught the 4, which was waiting for me- I was at Union Square by 10:45-10:50.&nbsp; Pretty amazing, and I suspect VERY atypical.&nbsp;

				I&#39;m quite familiar with the Steinway 101 and the M60, and both are a crapshoot as far as wait times.&nbsp; I have waited 30-40 minutes, and given up sometimes.&nbsp; But when they do come, they are so so convenient, especially that M60.&nbsp; And for some reason the M60 is so much more frequent coming from Manhattan down 125th than going to it from Astoria Blvd.&nbsp; Have no idea why.&nbsp; But yes, even weekday mornings are a crapshoot.&nbsp; If you see it coming take it, but don&#39;t rely on it everyday.&nbsp; I had to a whole week and it was half an hour late 4 of the days.

				It took me two hours to get home from 34th street last night.&nbsp; I strongly suggest staying in Astoria or taking the R train.&nbsp; I&#39;d love to puncture Peter Kalikow&#39;s eardrum and pour flesh-eating bacteria down his ear and into his tiny little brain, but I don&#39;t have a funnel.

				Lately I&#39;ve been noticing that whenever I take the NW train after 10:30/11pm, it takes at least 20mins or more for it to show up.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is during the week and weekend.&nbsp; It is usually crowded by then all the way to Ditmars.&nbsp; Therefore the hour travel time home as opposed to the usual half hour is starting to make me not want to stay out late in Manhattan.&nbsp; It&#39;s really getting to me.&nbsp; It&#39;s faster to take a cab but even that fee has gone up and costs me $20-30 from Manhattan.&nbsp; My friend on the 7 train in Sunnyside claims she never has this problem.&nbsp; I wonder if all the trains are like this.

				I take the N home between 10:30-12:30 almost every night. It really varies. Sometimes it comes soon after I get there, and sometimes I do wait 20 minutes. Normally I don&#39;t think I wait more than 10 minutes though, and I can usually find a seat if I go towards the back. It seems to have gotten better in the recent months than it had been. But generally I estimate it will take me anywhere from 25 minutes to an hour and a half to get home from 57th street at night.&nbsp; :roll: Waiting for the N on Sunday nights is the worst.

				I apparently have bad luck with trains as waiting for 20 mins at least after 10:30 11pm has become the norm for me in the past two months.&nbsp; Bad timing it may be, as it does seem they just do not run many trains at night, perhaps 2 an hour?&nbsp; I wish there a reliable schedule to go by, but I know even if there is one published somewhere it will be useless....

				I have even noticed at times, when I get on at 57th street, I will see an N or W just pulling out of the station and then a few Rs will come in.&nbsp; But yes, I have also noticed that later in the night, it does seem to get crowded, quite frequently.&nbsp; Maybe, it&#39;s only because Astorians know how to have fun?!&nbsp; =P&nbsp; I know I uaually hang out in Manhattan after work because my friends rarely ever want to come to the Foreign Lands.

				I had a pretty easy commute, went to the Broadway stop, the bus was packed and getting fuller when a new bus pulled up right behind, got a seat!<br /><br />Coming back everyone was racing to the buses, when a new bus pulled in stayed at the back doors and with a little pushing got right on and another seat.<br /><br />All in all it wasn&#39;t too much of a hassle, but definitely don&#39;t want this to go on in the future.

				I had to be in Manhattan Sunday for the NYRR five mile race (starting time 9am), so a car was called to avoid any bus/train mess.&nbsp; Was the perfect choice; got to the UWS in like 20 minutes.&nbsp; Took Metro North up to Westchester to play auditions.&nbsp; Took the M60 home around 4:30.&nbsp; Caught the bus at Lexington, so it wasn&#39;t as awful as it could have been.&nbsp; That bus is almost useless in Manhattan on the weekends.&nbsp; Once you cross Second Ave and onto the Triboro, it&#39;s ok.&nbsp; But barf, avoid it if you can on the weekends if you have to catch it anywhere west of Second Ave.

				Well, I had an amazing train experience last night (Sunday), around 8pm. The trains are normally kind of spaced far apart on weekends, as you know.&nbsp; But I caught a Q train about 5 minutes after I arrived at 7th Avenue, it whisked me to 57th Street where I transferred and caught an N about 5 minutes after that.&nbsp; I got to Astoria in record time.&nbsp; Park Slope to Astoria door to door about 63 minutes.&nbsp; Amazing!
