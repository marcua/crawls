				As per this thread (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=9073.msg110480#msg110480), let&#039;s put together a wingtacular evening at Dillinger&#039;s!<br /><br />I understand their wing specials are Tuesday nights.&nbsp; 25 cent wings, I believe, with beer specials as well.<br /><br />I would like to suggest after V-day, too.<br /><br />Monday the 18th is a day off for many.&nbsp; We could make going back to work on the 19th more fun if wings and beer are expected that night.&nbsp; The 26th would be good, too.<br /><br />Thoughts?

				We can get 20+ Astorians for wings &amp; beer specials, can&#039;t we?<br /><br />Heck, I almost never go for drinks or anything for that matter, from Monday to Wednesday, but 25 cents a wing with beer and, oh yeah, great company, seems too tempting to pass up!

				I&#039;m down, I&#039;m soooooooo down.&nbsp; The owner of Dillinger&#039;s is really good and accomidating to groups.&nbsp; Especially since this will be a Tuesday, if one of us gave them a call, I&#039;m pretty sure that they&#039;d give us the whole back area.&nbsp; Based on January&#039;s calendar, it looks like there is definitely a wing special every Tuesday, so hopefully it continues into Feb.

				I would still like to go, but you guys should know that the wing special starts at 8:00 PM.&nbsp; In addition, unless one of the members knows someone there and is a little better at speaking to management, I don&#039;t think we can get anything reserved for us as it tends to draw a lot of people anyway.&nbsp;

He hooked me up with a last minute Super Bowl wing order. I called in desperation looking for some wings 20 minutes prior to kickoff.

At next Tuesday&#039;s <span class="bbc_u">Mini Dillingers Wingtacular</span> (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=9632.0) you eat 16 wings and don&#039;t drink. If you don&#039;t get sick, then you go back the next week and don&#039;t eat any wings, just drink Jameson. If you still don&#039;t get sick, then perhaps, I&#039;m just saying perhaps, you are allergic to Dillingers!<br /><br />If, however, you do get sick next Tuesday at the <span class="bbc_u">Mini Dillingers Wingtacular</span> (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=9632.0) then you are unfortunately destined to a wingless existence.

				I was fine, although I didn&#039;t eat any wings.&nbsp; In fact, at the previous two wingtactulars I&#039;ve had a total of three wings.&nbsp; I like whiskey too much!

Funny story. So Tuesday night at like 11:30, as I&#039;m just getting home, I get a call from a friend of mine from San Francisco. Turns out he&#039;s at JFK. Because he was supposed to be in London. But customs deported him and refused to wait until he could get on a plane to San Francisco, so they&#039;d apparently just dumped him in NY. So I spent yesterday getting him food and helping him try to figure out how to get back to CA. Poor guy. I kinda forgot about the tables! Sorry BigBry!
