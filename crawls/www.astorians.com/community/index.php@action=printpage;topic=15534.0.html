				Title: <strong>ADD care?</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				My boyfriend and I have been looking for a free clinic or a place where we can obtain some medical assistance for his ADD. I have ADD too, but I&#039;ve been taking Ginkgo Biloba for it. He&#039;s having severe problems concentrating, I just became employed recently and he&#039;s having problems focusing on job hunting because his attention problems get pretty bad. Something like adderall or ritalin would really help. Does anyone know if Healthy NYC is worth looking into and if there&#039;s a place to get cheap prescriptions and/or treatment for ADD in or around Queens? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

				Try calling the local ERs and asking who their on call psychiatrists and psychologists are and then call them looking for advice. I have had great success with this technique in the past. I&#039;ve also been told that 311 is apparently of some help as far as information of this type is concerned.<br /><br />Hope this helps, I know how frustrating ADD can be. Ironically, often the biggest hurdle to overcome is finding the focus to seek out help.<br /><br />Wish you the best ...
