Do you disagree with her assessment or do you feel that it shouldn&#039;t be discussed? Nicholas Kristof had an op-ed in the Times this weekend that says pretty much the same thing. Simply looking at the Southern states exit polls shows that identity politics played a big role in his victories there. Before Obama took off, Clinton polled through the roof on the African American vote.<br />What I respect about her statement is that she acknowledges that she was picked for the VP slot because of her gender.<br />

This isn&#039;t Ferraro&#039;s first rodeo. The campaign knew what she was going to say, managed the press to make sure it played big, arranged in advance&nbsp; for Gerry to step, and had the inevitable &quot;apology to African Americans&quot; already written.<br /><br />And why not? It&#039;s get a big name Clinton supporter in the news. Makes Ferraro look like a martyr while falling on her sword. And makes Hillary look magnanimous in her apologies.<br /><br />Obama played it slightly wrong but not terribly. He has gotten to where he is by specifically not playing the race card.

				<br />Not only Obama and Clinton, but also Sen. John McCain, the Republican nominee-in-waiting, was present during the day. <br /><br />In fact, their presence resulted in a rarity at one point, a 50-50 vote on a procedural motion that obliged Vice President Dick Cheney to break the tie. <br /><br />McCain left early for a fundraiser in Philadelphia, with plans to return later in the evening. <br /><br />And for all the campaign talk about differences on issues like health care and trade, Clinton and Obama were in agreement on all the votes that came up during the day. &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080313/ap_on_el_pr/obama_clinton;<br /><br />

It allows everyone to see whatever they want to see in him. <br /><br />So Obama says that he did not hear Dr. Wright say these while he was in Church, or in private company.

				I think it could be interesting to see how faith affects the issues for McCain and Obama.<br /><br />McCain is for now a baptist. So he might find interest in Obama&#039;s historical studies.<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Leland_(Baptist)<br /><br /><br />&quot;The notion of a Christian commonwealth should be exploded forever...<br />Government should protect every man in thinking and speaking freely, and see that one does not abuse another. &nbsp;<br />The liberty I contend for is more than toleration. The very idea of toleration is despicable; it supposes that some have a pre-eminence above the rest to grant indulgence, whereas all should be equally free, Jews, Turks, Pagans and Christians.&quot;
