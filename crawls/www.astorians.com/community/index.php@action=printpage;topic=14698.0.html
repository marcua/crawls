				I overheard some old time Astorians talking the other day and they were talking about the old days and that certain areas are and shops have been involved in stuff like that for ages.So I got curious if anybody knows if mob activities were big in the old days like in other boroughs? If so I would imagine they were mostly Italians and Greeks right? Then I thought about the present and with all the clubs,lounges and strip joints in the area im sure there are shake downs and shops offering protection $ I wonder what shady things happen after hours! Anybody have stories to share?

				People do talk that, but there was really no real Mafia presense, just&nbsp; alot of tough, and half-tough types.&nbsp; &nbsp; Joe N. Gallo, not to be confused with Crazy Joe Gallo, lived on Crescent street off Boradway, and hung out on corner of Cresent and Broadway, and by OTB.&nbsp; &nbsp; He had no activities going on here though. He used Astoria as place to get away from things.&nbsp; &nbsp;Gallo was Carlo Gambino&#039;s counsilerge, or however it&#039;s said. <br /><br />Vincent Pappa, who was involved with the theft of the French Connection heroin, hung around Astoria, but he was not a Mafia guy.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />There are a lot of people from Astoria who think certain old timers were gangsters, but they are usually wrong.&nbsp; <br /><br />A Greek who was big was guy named Spiro, last name started with a V.&nbsp; &nbsp;He had club on Ditmars for many years, I think he is in prison still, unless he was paroled.<br /><br /><br />My father and uncles always talk of the time a bunch of neighborhood guys, all Italians, opened after hours club on Astoria Blvd., in old Ethan Allen building.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Around 1980.&nbsp; &nbsp; They had big money maker, several flooors, and one floor was gambling.&nbsp; &nbsp; Some real gangsters came in, and owners dropped&nbsp; name of a guy named Bobby Capozio, who is now dead, but grew up in Ravenswood.&nbsp; &nbsp; They got left alone--till Bobby Capozio found out these Astoria idiots used his name. He went in, smaked all four owners around in front of everyone.&nbsp; Place closed a week or two later.&nbsp; &nbsp; Those four idiots, two of whom are still alive, occasionally get bought up by oldtimers as &#039;Actual Mafia members.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Capozio is mentioned in the book by FBI agent Joe Pistone, in book that was made into movie with Johhny Depp and Al Pacino.&nbsp; &nbsp;Capozio was not charactor in movie though.&nbsp; <br />Although he was from Astoria, he stayed primarily in Brooklyn, and did not trust guys from this neighborhood as partners in anything.

				Without a doubt there was Mob affiliation and ties with Astoria. That&#039;s a fact. They ran everything from clubs to even street vendors (&lt;----True Story from someone I knew.) <br /><br />But after the 80&#039;s, it pretty much vanished for the most part.&nbsp; <br /><br />Wasn&#039;t there a burial ground they had around here? Rumor has it...<br /><br />

				&nbsp; If I remember correctly, Joe Gallo owned the candy store on Crescent and Broadway.&nbsp; I used to se him on Broadway all the time.&nbsp; He always waved and said hello.&nbsp; He seemed like a really nice guy, and it was only later in the early 90&#039;s I think, that I found out everything he was supposed to be involved in.

Twenty-six people were indicted in connection with racketeering, attempted murder, robbery, extortion, gambling and loan-sharking.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;During a bail hearing for one of the two dozen people arrested in the case, Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy Treanor said that the Albanian mob had taken over the operations of the Lucchese family in Astoria (Queens).&quot;<br /><br />More information on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Rudaj<br /><br />&quot;Rudaj Organization<br />Founded &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1993<br />In &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westchester, New York<br />Years active &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1993-2004<br />Territory &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astoria, Queens, New York City<br />Ethnicity &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mostly Albanian and Albanian-American, some Greek and Italian<br />Membership &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22 defendants charged in RICO indictment<br />Criminal activities &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extortion, illegal gambling, robbery<br />Rivals &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucchese crime family, Gambino crime family&quot;

				Ask your parents/grandparents about Jimmy Napp(i). Joey G had nothing to do with the day-to-day running of Astoria/LIC. He was a made man who ran the book, but nothing else. Jimmy G was the MAN. <br /><br />BTW, we had VERY little crime back then.

Irony is, he got sent to prison right before son&#039;s release.&nbsp; <br /><br />Gallo was not from Astoria, by the way. He was from manhattan, 11th street off avenue A origionally.&nbsp; Moved here I&#039;m guessing about 1950&#039;s. <br /><br />You are right, he was nice, acted not at all&nbsp; like a gangster.&nbsp; He was sometimes pissed off at local yokels who conducted themselves like they were gangsters, and they were banned from area he hung out in.&nbsp; &nbsp;He was let out of prison just before his death so he could die at home. He lived in first building off broadway on cresent street, going towards 31 avenue.

				In the 1980&#039;s there were two seperate arrests in Astoria. In one, police were called to building on 29th street off broadway, behind Sac&#039;s Pizza. (Sac&#039;s was not there at time)&nbsp; <br /><br />The super of building had been robbed, police interupted, found $4 million in cash, and cocaine.&nbsp; &nbsp;Dominicans were involved on both ends.&nbsp; On same block, other side of Broadway,&nbsp; a year later, a car was siezed with two men from Columbia in it.&nbsp; &nbsp; They had several&nbsp; hundred thousand on them, and in their apartment, 29th betwen 33rd and 34th avenue, was found $2 million and cocaine.&nbsp; Yes, the economy was VERY good in the 80&#039;s!&nbsp; :-)

				Some interesting stuff from the New York Times:&nbsp; (I&#039;d like to know where Soccer is or was)<br /><br />Jan. 3, 2006<br /><br />Photo: Alex Rudaj, outside Jimbo&#039;s Bar in Astoria, Queens, on April 15, 2003. Authorities say he runs the Corporation, an Albanian group that they believe is trying to become New York City&#039;s sixth mob family. (Photo by Federal Bureau of Investigation) <br /><br /><br />Beginning in the 1990&#039;s, the Corporation, led by a man named Alex Rudaj, established ties with established organized crime figures including members of the Gambino crime family, the authorities say. Then, through negotiations or in armed showdowns, the Albanians struck out on their own, daring to battle the Luchese and Gambino families for territory in Queens, the Bronx and Westchester County, prosecutors say. <br /><br />During one of these confrontations, in August 2001 at an Astoria gambling parlor called Soccer Fever, Mr. Rudaj and at least 14 of his men served notice of their intentions to an associate of the Gambino family who ran the club, prosecutors contend in court documents. <br /><br />Brandishing guns, one of Mr. Rudaj&#039;s men overturned gambling tables, another grabbed money, and a third pistol-whipped a patron, the authorities said. <br /><br />&#039;&#039;Gentlemen, the game is over,&#039;&#039; one of Mr. Rudaj&#039;s men told patrons playing barbout, a dice game. These details and more have emerged during the trial of Mr. Rudaj and five other men in Federal District Court in Manhattan. A jury is now deliberating charges against them, including racketeering, attempted murder, extortion, loan-sharking and gambling. <br /><br />The defense lawyers have called the government&#039;s claims exaggerated, and although they concede that the six men conducted gambling operations, the lawyers deny that their clients belonged to a criminal organization that used violence and extortion to maintain its network of profitable gambling interests, as prosecutors have said. A verdict is possible this week. <br /><br /><br />Dec. 20, 2005<br /><br />Ms. Rodgers, the prosecutor, said the Albanian crime ring had controlled a network of 50 video gambling machines. The machines themselves, a type of arcade game, are not illegal, but it is illegal to pay money to winners. The ring collected protection payments and illegal gambling proceeds weekly from various restaurants and social clubs in the Bronx and Astoria. <br /><br />One machine, Ms. Rodgers said, could generate more than $7,000 a week. But even by a conservative estimate, she said, 100 machines generating $750 a week would produce $4 million a year.<br /><br />After a showdown between Italians and Albanians at a club called Soccer Fever in Astoria, Mr. Ivezaj was recorded, in a tape played for the jury during the trial, saying that if the Italians had pulled their guns, &quot;Everybody dies. Guaranteed. Nobody walks out of there alive. Either them or us.&quot; The trial will continue today with closing arguments by the defense.<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t resist adding this tidbit, even though it has nothing to do with Astoria:<br /><br />Members of the Albanian organization felt so sure of themselves that they claimed John Gotti&#039;s old table at Rao&#039;s, the exclusive East Harlem restaurant patronized by writers and reputed Italian crime family members, Ms. Rodgers said.<br /><br /><br />

				I still hear about guys who were supposed to be mafia guys from Astoria.&nbsp; I hear people talk about an assh*le named Sonny, who had a bar on 29th and 30th, and then sold that and had a couple of candy stores.&nbsp; I saw him a few times as a small kid, he had Lon Chaney eyes.&nbsp; Average height, dark complexion, and tattoos.&nbsp; Some thought he was gangster, some still do.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have a Sony story that my uncles and friends tell. If you are wondering why I call him assh^le, story will explain:<br /><br />About 1982, a guy I will call Vinny (He is still alive)&nbsp; came into OTB on Broadway. He is on some of those crime charts they occasionally show, and is listed as Genovese Captain.&nbsp; He wa sabout 50 at time, big guy, tough, but easy going. I thought he looked like the late Sam Kinison.&nbsp; Did not dress up much either, looked like a truck driver.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Vinny walks in, and an old man, a retired, on apension, is one of the people he says hi to. Vinny just wants to make&nbsp; a bet, but old man has problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;He tells Vinny that he is owed money by Sonny, a local guy, bookie, who took money and won&#039;t pay him on a few sports bets.&nbsp; &nbsp; Sonny, the &#039;Gangster&quot; is blowing guy off, telling him to get lost.&nbsp; &nbsp;Vinny say&#039;s he&#039;ll see what he can do.&nbsp; <br /><br />Vinny approaches, and Sonny is with friends, who know who Vinny is.&nbsp; Vinny asks Sonny for&nbsp; amoment to talk, Sonny always had a scowl, nasty f#ck, just stares.&nbsp; &nbsp;Vinny, in his easy going way, explains he knows old timer, and asks if Sonny owes him money, and if so, can he &#039;Help him out, and pay him?&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just like that. Sonny replies &#039;Go f#ck yourself.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Vinny hits him.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sonny goes flying.&nbsp; I like the way a bystander explained it to me:&nbsp; <br />&quot;Ever see the Three Stooges, or Abott and Costello, when a guy gets hit with a flowerpot on the head, and just slinks down a wall, and they make that a cuckoo bird sound as guy&#039;s roll up---that&#039;s how Sonny went down.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Vinny ran out.&nbsp; When Sonny woke up (they had to get ice from bar and throw some&nbsp; on him)&nbsp; &nbsp;he was told who he had said f#ck off to.&nbsp; &nbsp;He recognized the name.&nbsp; The old man who was owed the money got it next day.&nbsp; &nbsp; :-)<br /><br /><br />To this day, on occasion, someone will mention old Astoria guys, and Sonny&#039;s name will come up. &quot;He was big Mafia guy, very connected,&quot; someone will say.&nbsp; &nbsp;I wish I had that&nbsp; knockout on video to show them.

				I lived in a cold water flat above an Italian-American Social Club on the GCP side of Steinway in the 50s. It was just down the street from a union hall. I can assure you that there was a &quot;presence&quot; back then. LOL In fact, I distinctly remember, as a 6-year old, being give $5 to take a paper bag up to the candy store just a block away on Steinway. I have the feeling that I may have been the youngest numbers runner ever, BTW, my Mom got megapissed and told the guys to shove their $5. She was one feisty Italian lady. They always treated her with the utmost courtesy after that. True story.<br /><br />BTW, that place is now some kind of silk store or something.

				Isn&#039;t there an Albanian organized crime presence in Astoria?&nbsp; I think I read somewhere there is a bar by 21st Avenue and one of the streets in the 30&#039;s -- 36th, 37th, 38th -- where they hang out.&nbsp; Occasionally, you read of an incident reportedly involved the Albanian criminal element.&nbsp; There was an incident in a pool hall, I vaguely remember, from a few years ago.

				Can&#039;t really say...I left Astoria in 1965...now live in Weedpatch, South Dakota...enroute to my final destination of Fukuoka, Japan in 2013. There I&#039;ll only need to deal with the Yakuza. BTW, my late Uncle Giuseppe spent a considerable amount of time away from his job in the NY Subway System, to work in the &quot;Construction and Sanitation Trades.&quot; (Ahem)

				As for Greek mafia activity, there was quite a few but low-key. Mostly in collaboration with the Italian mafia. Both fought against albanian take-overs during the late 80&#039;s and 90&#039;s. A lot of the social Greek clubs you see have many x-members roaming the streets. I used to do a few runs for some of them while working in their legit businesses back in the days. I believe today they still operate in racketeering, extortion and other stuff mainly in other neighborhoods. One of the more known families are &quot;Velentzas&quot;. I believe they&#039;re still in cahoots with one of the main Italian families.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a little backstory to what happened to some Italians and Greeks when caught sleeping. Albanians took over some gambling spots for a few years. Link Here. (http://johnsville.blogspot.com/2004/11/rudaj-organization-aka-albanian-mafia.html) I believe after these incidents, luck flipped on the Albanians though.
