			I realize this is a very complicated issue, but I can&#039;t be against mothers and young children having a roof over their head at night.&nbsp; I hope as a community we can find a way to make this work and support them, so that this is a transition to something better.<br />&nbsp;<br />Surely it&#039;s in everyone&#039;s best interest if this shelter is able to provide a stable, supportive environment for the young children rather than having them out on the street.&nbsp; &nbsp;

			At the end of the day, I would have no problem showing up and protesting FOR the existence of the shelter. <br /><br /><br />Maybe we can start our own petition?

			This was the scene in Elmhurst a few weeks ago :&nbsp; http://gothamist.com/2014/07/01/protesters_jeer_at_homeless_familie_1.php<br /><br />Instead of teaching their kids compassion, they&#039;d rather teach them hate.&nbsp; I get its a complicated issue but this behavior makes me sick.<br />

I also might go a step further by volunteering and welcoming these families to the neighborhood.&nbsp; A family is a stable unit and parents, by and large, want the best for their kids - that includes a roof over their head and stability before finding permanent home.<br /><br /><br />Just FYI - there&#039;s a volunteer orientation at Women In Need on Thursday August 8th: <br />http://winnyc.org/get-involved-with-win/become-a-volunteer-at-win/getinvolvedvolunteer/ <br />[size=78%] [/size]<br /><br />

			A bit of a bright spot in an otherwise sad and embarrassing situation. Did you know that Queens has the second least number of homeless shelters in the 5 boroughs? Only Staten Island has less than Queens. <br /><br /><br />http://www.qchron.com/editions/central/residents-host-bbq-for-pan-am-families/article_83f0501b-2a45-5669-a34f-f5add297237c.html
