I&#039;d say that would be a good place to start.

				Cookware is sort of dependent on what you want to cook.&nbsp; Even something elementary like scrambled eggs can be a nightmare if the pan is made out of the wrong material.&nbsp; So <em>where </em>you buy your cookware isn&#039;t as important as <em>what </em>you buy, and since cookware can be expensive it isn&#039;t necessarily something you buy locally just for the sake of supporting the community.&nbsp; If you&#039;re new to cooking and don&#039;t know what you want to buy, look around online for information on <em>how </em>to choose, look at big-name stores (Macy&#039;s, Penney&#039;s, Bed Bath and Beyond are just three) online (as well as QVC and HSN) to see what&#039;s currently available and what&#039;s on sale, and go to Marshall&#039;s/T J Maxx to see what <em>they </em>have because it really is half the regular price of the other stores.&nbsp; Also, determine in advance how much space you have to store your cookware because if you&#039;ve got small space available you have to choose pots &amp; pans that can nest inside each other well.&nbsp; While you&#039;re at it, measure the inside of your oven so you know how big a roasting pan you can fit it - assuming you&#039;re going to cook a Thanksgiving turkey.&nbsp; And, unless you&#039;ve got <em>lots </em>of money, you might want to look at recipe sites that let you choose recipes based on ingredients, because it&#039;s a major drag to find out your spices cost vastly more than the main ingredient - you might want to expand your cooking repertoire slowly.&nbsp; And, don&#039;t forget, you have to buy measuring cups, measuring spoons, mixing bowls, cooking utensils, pot holders, oven mitts...<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to discourage you, it&#039;s just a reality check!&nbsp; It&#039;s going to take a while to get up to speed in replacing what you&#039;re been eating in restaurants, so just do some planning in advance. :)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
