				Hi I am a 25 year old female who lives in the Ditmars area of Astoria.<br /><br />I just got a Nikon D40 and am interesting in learning how to use it.&nbsp; I would like to learn how to use the settings on my camera as well as some tips about lighting and portrait photography.<br /><br />I can swap photography lessons for basic sewing lessons...or I can tag along and assist you for free!!!<br /><br />Any takers?

				What&#039;s going on? I take pictures as a hobby and have Nikon D80. Not that much different than your camera outside of basic settings. I&#039;ve been meaning to take more pictures with it as I&#039;ve been slacking lately. This will give me the incentive to go around Astoria and take some pictures.<br /><br />Private message me and we&#039;ll go from there.<br /><br />Congrats on your new camera by the way. You&#039;re going to love it.

				I&#039;m new here (to both Astoria and astorians.com) and have been taking pictures with my D50 for fun for the last couple years.&nbsp; I still consider myself new to photography, but I&#039;m getting better.&nbsp; I especially liked taking lightning pictures during storms in Tucson before I moved here.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t done any kind of portraits or off-camera lighting so I&#039;m afraid I can&#039;t help you there.<br /><br />I keep meaning to go out and take pictures but haven&#039;t gotten up the motivation, and I don&#039;t really know the area or where to go to take cool pictures.&nbsp; If you all plan a meet-up of some kind, count me in!<br /><br />Oh - whiskeydregs, I just read the thread about the music stuff going on this Saturday at the park, I haven&#039;t been to the park yet, but the whole thing sounds like fun, and I&#039;m going to bring my camera, I&#039;m sure there&#039;s lots of stuff going on to get shots of!

				hey, i&#039;m a pro photographer and filmmaker living in astoria. i&#039;ll keep you in mind if I ever need an assistant.<br />(assisting is the best way to learn. i never went to photography school, just worked as an assistant for many years)<br /><br />in the meantime, I would suggest checking out www.photo.net for tons and tons of inspiration and tips.<br /><br />&nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br />

				I think a great way to learn is to shoot shoot shoot.. Read some photo.net post, then Shoot some more. Go to the library/bookstore and shoot some more. Then eat, sleep, then shoot some more..

				Here&#039;s my .02... Every thing you need is online.<br /><br />check out photo.net, strobist, tips from the top floor, and APUG.org (This is about film, but camera principles are universal.)<br /><br />Next, shoot, shoot and shoot some more. Browse the bookstore for ideas if you run out. <br /><br />lock yourself in the bathroom and shoot until you&#039;ve taken 100 frames. (this is a lot harder than you think)<br /><br />Good luck, and stay out of auto mode!<br />

				I&#039;m not a pro but I like photography and am trying to get better.<br /><br />From what I&#039;ve seen shooting really the way to learn. Take notes on the photos you take so you remember what you did. I just found www.photojojo.com They have some cool projects and tips there as well.<br /><br />If anyone wants to get together for a photo walk/shoot let me know.

				Photography has been a hobby for many years.&nbsp; I would love to do a photo walk around the area.&nbsp; I would be more than willing to give out some photo pointers and look behinds your lens as you shoot.&nbsp; That is the way that I learned. Email me and I will send you Link to my website.

				<br />another great way to learn is to take naked pictures of your friends and then send them to me so I can critique them.
