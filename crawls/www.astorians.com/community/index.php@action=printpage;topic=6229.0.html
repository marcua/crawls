				Wow, <strong>barrister15</strong> - you sound like <em>both</em> my parents rolled into one!<br /><br />Since so many people here are mentioning autism, I&#039;ll throw my hat into the ring as a former autism preschool teacher.&nbsp; I taught with a local private school agency for my first two years in New York as the head teacher in an 8:1:2 setting with three to five year olds.<br /><br />They were cute - the bureaucracy was too much, though.<br /><br />And now, I&#039;m in theater.

I think if someone has the means to go to law school without incurring huge student loan debt and they have a genuine aptitude and love of the law, then I say go for it. I&#039;ve been a practicing attorney for about 5 1/2 years and I love what I do, my job is pretty fun and exciting, and I think going to law school was the best decision I ever made (if only I didn&#039;t have the huge student loan debt that went along with it).

				For some people, they love it and the jobs that they do.&nbsp; But I get the feeling for a majority of attorneys, they suffer through the crazy hours and stress in order to pay back loans.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been practicing for nearly 3 years and most of my friends from law school are looking to do something other than Law.<br /><br />When I was a law student, I worked for a Judge in Staten Island, and almost every attorney who came in for pre-trial conferences would tell me to quit and goto med school, which I didn&#039;t understand at the time, but I realized later that a lot were Plaintiff&#039;s attorneys who were paying $30K plus for their experts...&nbsp; <br /><br />I guess my point is its for some people, not for others, but for the huge investment in time, money, and lost earnings for those years, it better be worth it.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad you like your job and are happy with your decision barrister!

				I&#039;m an artist and random day job holder&nbsp; :wink:<br /><br />Right now my day job is working customer service (funny- since I am NOT a phone person) at a company called Active Health Management. Basically we call doctor&#039;s offices all day and provide health info based on health insurance claims. Aetna just bought our company and since that happened it&#039;s been Big Brotherville here. <br /><br />This last &quot;random&quot; job has lasted a bit longer than I would have liked! But it pays well and has benefits etc....always a good thing. However this job is about the furthest on the spectrum of &quot;jobs that suit me&quot; as one can get. I guess you could say I&#039;ve been in a bit of a rut here for a little over a year now.<br /><br />For the past 2 years I have been taking evening classes at the New School in their Creative Arts Therapy Certificate program. It&#039;s not undergrad and not grad- more like a really solid foundation in Art Therapy. I&#039;m almost finished and have an internship next semester (hmmm...opportunity to get out of this crappy job?) LOL<br />Still undecided about pursuing art therapy on a graduate level- I think that I want to be more certain before embarking on that path, but I am definitely gaining a lot from the classes that I&#039;ve been taking there.<br /><br /><br />I also try and find time for my personal work, which is painting and what I went to school for too!&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m also exploring the idea of mural painting/decorative finishes and have been looking into this increasingly. For the time being I&#039;m not quite ready to make the leap into being self-employed in this area...but I am working on building up my portfolio and experience with the idea that someday I could follow that path.<br /><br />I&#039;m starting a mural project soon in the Village in an apartment lobby. I also did a mural at the new Bistro 33- across their bar....by the way- can hardly wait for them to open!!!<br />(I&#039;ve been in Bistro food withdrawal).<br /><br />So that&#039;s my whole long &quot;occupation&quot; description. I guess I should&#039;ve mentioned that my other part time occupation is looking for another day job!
