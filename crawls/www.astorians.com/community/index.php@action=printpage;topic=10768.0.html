				i picked up a share of raw (unpastuerized) organic grass-fed cows milk this week, and it is WAY more than I can consume myself (i got a little more enthusiastic than i probably should have have). if anyone would like the gallon, please let me know asap. i am asking what i spent - 5.50, if you have your own container, or 7.50 with the jar.

				You should make ice cream! The raw milk is so heavy you just shake it up and it&#039;s like using heavy cream (although you could also skim the heavy cream off the top). Or clotted cream. Mmmm the clotted cream you make from raw milk is crackalicious. You can also freeze it. I notice a lot of the farms freeze the colostrum so I don&#039;t think it hurts it. I would put it in smaller containers than the gallon.<br />

				You can also make a simple cheese -- either ricotta or mozzarella.<br /><br />Ice cream sounds tasty though.

				Where do you get raw milk? I want some.<br /><br />I thought you had to be part of an underground anti-pasteurization group in order to get that kind of stuff.

				Only thing close to raw milk that I have bought is organic non-homogenized milk from the farmers market in Prospect Park. Sounds cool. Where do you get it?

				Given how long it&#039;s taking for OP to get rid of the raw milk, perhaps we should edit the thread to say &quot;Raw Cheese&quot;?

				The kind of cool thing about raw milk is that instead of spoiling in the super gross way store bought milk dies -- raw milk just turns itself into yogurt/sour cream.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not saying you should buy it for this purpose or consume it after it gets a bit skunky (too sour for me) but you should appreciate the difference in spoilage.<br /><br />Good for the OP if they haven&#039;t figured out what to do yet :) <br /><br />Really though the milk will stay good for 7-10 days and is viable for cheese making (or yogurt making) at anytime.

				DON&#039;T FREEZE IT! (Ice cream&#039;s ok.) Milk doesn&#039;t freeze well -- when you thaw it, the fat and liquid components separate. (According to Harold McGee, food scientist, as paraphrased by me.)<br /><br />I love to make ice cream though... Next time you get some, I&#039;ll make some ice cream to share with you. :)

				I actually have been making ice cream, with a Simac Gelataio. I&#039;ve been using a quart of milk, 3/4 cup org. white sugar (except vanilla, using two tablespoon less sugar and adding two tablespoons brown rice syrup), two to three teaspoons extract, and in one batch a couple tablespoons of canola oil). I can&#039;t say I&#039;m very happy with the results, as it&#039;s kind of icy/crystaly. I can shave it out and mash it a bit with the back of a spoon. Chocolate (1/4 cup cocoa powder, two teaspoons coffee extract, one teaspoon vanilla) does turn out smooth though. The other flavor I&#039;v tried so far is a roasted almond, pureeing all the ingredients in a blender, for a while (next time I&#039;d let the almonds soak in the milk to get a less gritty texture - my gf recommends coarsely pulsing them - but I was going for a creamy consistency, hoping the &quot;creamed&quot; almonds would make the ice cream more cream and less ice). I&#039;ve been downing about a half pint per evening.

				If you are making ice cream without a custard base (i.e. without eggs - also called Philadelphia-style ice cream), the end product will freeze extra hard.&nbsp; The custard emulsion is what gives regular ice cream a more supple texture.&nbsp; To help with the texture of egg-free ice cream, you can add a tablespoon of vodka or a tablespoon or two of corn syrup to your base.&nbsp; The vodka, which you cannot taste in the final product, makes it more scoopable, but the texture is still a bit rough.&nbsp; The corn syrup is really the best (it&#039;s what the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory (http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/brooklyn-ice-cream02/) uses).&nbsp; (I&#039;m not talking about high fructose corn syrup here.&nbsp; I try to avoid all corn syrup myself, but a tablespoon or two in a quart and a half of ice cream really isn&#039;t going to hurt.&nbsp; I think invert sugar also may do the same thing, but I don&#039;t know much about it.)

				Wow! I use a cheapo Cuisinart ice cream maker, and it&#039;s just ok. But I also make custard-based ice cream, or I use cream, condensed milk, and evaporated milk, but that makes it really sweet. Sugar tends to make it smoother (especially in sorbet).

				Actually if you check the label for corn syrup, the ingredients list high fructose corn syrup.&nbsp; I&#039;m not clear on what differentiates the two forms but corn syrup does contain HFC (at least the readily available varieties).<br /><br />-j

				Karo dark corn syrup does not contain high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />But that wasn&#039;t my point.&nbsp; My point was simply to use non-high-fructose corn syrup.&nbsp; It is in fact available.&nbsp; In addition, Wholesome Sweeteners (http://www.wholesomesweeteners.com/brands/Wholesome_Sweeteners/Organic_Corn_Syrup.html), a brand I&#039;ve seen in many health food stores, makes an organic corn syrup that is HFCS-free.<br /><br />I too use the Cuisinart ice cream maker, and I&#039;ve obtained beautifully silky custard-based ice creams from it.&nbsp;
