				Does anyone have any healthy lunch ideas (bought or brought)?<br /><br />I am trying to eat fewer carb heavy meals but my belly is like &quot;No one understands you like I do, carbohydrates.&quot;

				I hear you - if I eat anything carb heavy at lunch, I&#39;m ready for my mid-afternoon nap.&nbsp; If I stick to protein and veggies, though, I don&#39;t have any afternoon dip in energy at all.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been staying away from carb-heavy lunches for 10 years, and it&#39;s very consistent.<br /><br />I alternate between bringing my own and buying something nearby.&nbsp; I get bored with it, but I try to stick with salads -- a mix of greens, other veggies, and a protein (which for me is usually an egg, occasionally bacon, often chicken, rarely other kinds of meat), basically.&nbsp; If you&#39;re a sandwich person, try having your favourite filling on top of a salad.&nbsp; Sometimes I&#39;ll have a salmon fillet, or tuna steak; sashimi with soup and salad is a good option so long as you don&#39;t eat the whole side of rice.<br /><br />If I bring my lunch, I will try to make extra of whatever I&#39;m making for dinner the night before and bring that.&nbsp; In the winter, I often make up different kinds of stews on the weekend and bring that for a few meals.&nbsp; A favourite is a chicken stew that has lots of veggies -- tomatoes, cabbage, cauliflower, onions, garlic, carrots, etc., but no potatoes or pasta.&nbsp; Today I brought homemade cole slaw (no added sugar) and chicken breast.<br /><br />If you want some grains, quinoa or other whole grains are good options; I prefer to use them as an accent rather than the main focus, but others are less sensitive to them.&nbsp; Lentils, beans and chana dal are also good.&nbsp; I make a great split-pea type soup in the winter in which I mix split peas with both lentils and chana dal (you can get chana dal at the Key Food on 30th Ave., or at the Bangladeshi grocery on Ditmars across from Dunkin&#39; Donuts).&nbsp; I usually put smoked turkey or ham hock into it, but it&#39;s also very easily made vegetarian.

				Nuts are great -- but it&#39;s so easy to add lots of extra calories to your diet one sitting if you&#39;re not careful!&nbsp; An ounce of most nuts has between 150 and 200 calories.<br /><br />(No Uncle Telly innuendo implied or stated.)

				I like the way flooz thinks. &nbsp;Nuts as a snack indeed.<br />Are slim jims really not good for you? &nbsp;Where do you find ostrich sticks and what do they taste like?<br />I tend to do salads for lunch and try to keep them healthy.<br />How about raw vegetables, especially celery and carrots for a healthy snack?

				Well whatever healthy food you do, stay away from spinach!!&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)<br /><br />I go in spurts with my healthy eating. For snacks, I measure out nuts in a little ziploc bag to keep the portion under control. And fruit to keep the 4pm sugar cravings away. I also like these sesame balls with peanuts inside... don&#39;t know what they&#39;re called, and don&#39;t know how healthy they are, but you see them at health food stores.

				Ostrich is delicious.&nbsp; It looks and tastes more like red meat than like fowl.<br /><br />I&#39;ve never seen ostrich on the menu in NYC except once in my former company cafeteria, where it was the most unpopular entree ever (but delicious--no one wanted to try it).&nbsp; I&#39;ve had ostrich burgers many times in Philly and Chicago, however.&nbsp; It&#39;s high in protein and MUCH lower cholesterol and fat than beef.<br /><br />It&#39;s weird that this topic came up because walking back from lunch (where I had delicious split pea soup) I was thinking about a very simple and delicious lunch I&#39;ve had in the past--brown rice mixed with lentils, some shredded vegetables and removable strips of tofu--bland yet satisfying--but I can&#39;t remember where I got it!&nbsp; ARGH!&nbsp; Maybe Manhattan, maybe Brooklyn, not Queens, maybe Philly, maybe Chicago.&nbsp; I just...can&#39;t...remember.

				I always bring my lunch and a few healthy snacks to munch on throughout the day. Almonds are a great snack, but the serving size is only about 17 almonds. I also bring baby carrots and hummus to snack on mid-afternoon. Popcorn is great too and they now make 100 calorie bags of just about everything. I also buy frozen bags of edamame, cook it the night before, and bring it with me to munch on. They taste yummy cold with a little salt.<br /><br />I drink a ton of water throughout the day and always have flavored seltzer at lunch. I buy the seltzer in 12 packs and just pop one in my bag every day. Cutting out soda at lunch is a great way to cut down on unnecessary sugars. If you do need the caffeine fix, stick to tea.<br /><br />I know making your lunch the night before or the morning of work can be a pain, but I eat much healthier and I am saving about $50 a week. (I work in midtown where there aren&#39;t many cheap choices for lunch). Same goes for snacks. I will buy a big bag of SoyCrisps and ration them out for the week. It is much better than buying a $2.50 bag at Duane Reade and then eat them all in one sitting.<br /><br />

				Funny this thread came up because I&#39;ve been trying to eat a lot better over the past few weeks (something in my head finally snapped when i saw what i weigh) and it&#39;s made a difference (7-10 pounds!) also, it&#39;s wicked expensive to eat out, even just salad bar, in the flatiron area.<br />this works if your office has a big fridge.<br />last week i brought some homemade tuna salad and healthy choice turkey breast along with whole grain english muffins(smaller serving and they were on sale, price leads me to most decisions)lettuce and tomato and just alternated the sammys everyday.<br />this week i have lettuce left over so i picked up a pint of grape tomatoes, a cucumber, a huge bag full of baby carrots-which i put into a small travel friendly baggie(i can also snack on these), 2 celery stalks chopped up, 1 green pepper chopped up, and some shredded cheese. i forgot to bring in the chicken i made yesterday. the only thing i don&#39;t prechop is the cucumber b/c i find it goes off faster that way. i get everything prepped sunday night while i am making dinner-it&#39;s just easier for me that way. put everything into individual bags that i throw into a drawer in the fridge at work. come lunch time i just pull out handfuls and prep the lettuce and cucumber. i&#39;ve got a nice healthy lunch made in only a few minutes. if i eat it fast enough i can run out and actually enjoy a lunch <em>break</em> which i don&#39;t often get to do. i did the caloric math, and if i take it easy on the cheese and chicken and make the veggies my main focus, the salad is about 100 calories (a salad doesn&#39;t need a full serving of each veg or topping so i divided into the amounts)oh, and i keep a light italian dressing on hand since dressing makes it easier for your body to absorb nutrients, not so with fat free or naked salads. this usually lasts me all week. sometimes into the next if i get to order on the account, or if i wind up working merchandising and then i usually miss lunch.<br />we have waaaaaaaaay too many snacks here, on each floor(lays, choco chip cookies, pretzels, baked sour cream and onion chips and baked bbq chips) i&#39;ve totally stopped having any. ok maybe one cookie if there&#39;s an open bag, or one pretzel. i&#39;ve brought in a baggie of 4 medium apples and some cinammon to sprinkle on a sliced apple, then i microwave it and it&#39;s almost like a baked apple-so yum and smells so good. and cinammon naturally curbs your sugar cravings. and grapes big ole bag of grapes, this replaces the feeling of eating potato chips. <br />i have trail mix in my drawer that i eat sparingly.<br />so, that&#39;s what i do. cheap and healthy!<br />

				One of my fav lunches is something I used to get at a deli back home - if you have leftover grilled chicken and a microwave in the office, this is perfect.<br /><br />Put all of these in a whole wheat wrap:<br />Hot grilled chicken, shredded/torn, salsa, jack cheese. Roll up and enjoy. The hot chicken will melt the cheese, and you can make it as spicy or mils as you like depending on the salsa. I know that wraps aren&#39;t as healthy as we&#39;d like them to be, and cheese is cheese, but this is all &quot;real&quot; food, and its cheap and tasty :)

				Just something to remember about almonds - they&#39;re only good for you if they&#39;re raw, not roasted. I always thought any almonds were good almonds, but Dr. Oz said on Oprah that if they&#39;re roasted, all the good fat in them turns to bad fat. This is true of a lot of stuff (cooking/roasting turns good fat into bad fat).<br /><br />I was really po&#39;d cos I&#39;d just bought two cans of roasted almonds.&nbsp; :x

				Dang man, I think Dr. Oz just really likes roasted almonds so he was trying to get them all to himself. No worries though, I ate all my roasted almonds (begrudgingly) anyway.&nbsp; :evil:&nbsp; Thanks for the research, Lanseaux!

				My office is moving soon and I will have access to refrigerator and microwave again. I can hardly wait! Here are some of the things I think about making to take in for myself (all precooked and just needing to be reheated, of course):<br /><br />- Bell peppers stuffed with ground meat, onions, raisins, and olives<br /><br />- Acorn squash halves stuffed with quinoa, raisins, chicken, raisins, dried cranberries and parmesan<br /><br />- Cabbage rolls stuffed with lentils, brown rice, pinions, onions, with tomato sauce, cumin, cinnamon and cayenne<br /><br />Clearly I&#39;m into stuffed veg. <br /><br />Curries and stirfries are nice too.... <br /><br /><br />I&#39;m hungry. I think I should go have lunch now.
