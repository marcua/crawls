				do you know what language they were speaking?<br /><br />I emailed Sandra as I couldn't find her number. But she hasn't gotten back to me. I really hope she does. The more I think about it...our attendees won't be getting a tax deduction. Usually when you go to a benefit, you pay a venue for an event, they donate the money, and then get the deduction. Still the collecter has to be a legal entity that can declare the money. this would be either the venue or ARROW or a church or whatever. If it was the venue, they should get a cut - that's only fair as they might otherwise have business that night. <br /><br />So, I think we should put the cabash (sp?) on creating a group and account. Getting incorperated with non-profit status can take a year, plus its a royal pain in the ass. Also, I'm thinking that Accenture is not going to match ARROW's contribution as ARROW doesn't work for them. ARROW can't hand the money off to Chris pre-contribution because ARROW would then have to pay taxes on that income and Chris will get the deduction. Chris you need to let us know about this. <br /><br />As far as I see it we have to let ARROW - or another incorperated group - handle the cash with or without a match. Hopefully with. <br /><br />I know it seems like one of us should be able to just collect the money and donate it, but then we have to declare that income and get a deduction for other people's donations and that's weird. This is too big a thing to do under the table. <br /><br />Sorry to throw this wrench into the mix. If someone finds fault in this logic that would be great. Let me know.

				About the Beer Garden...I really don't think we're not renting a venue. Who's paying for it? If we did we might not even raise enough money to break even. Then we're not helping anybody. If we were going to take that route, we'd first have to get enough sponsers to pay for it. What are other people's thoughts on this?

				Just as an update, I contacted Waltz and am awaiting Song's response. &nbsp;I hope to bring information on that to the meeting on Thursday.<br /><br />Joey, I hope your reader comes to the meeting Thursday! &nbsp;It's always good to have people with event planning experience on board.<br /><br />And regarding checking out the piano wherever we end up, I would be happy to be a tester. &nbsp;I'm sure the piano at Waltz is very good, as one of the owners is a pianist herself. &nbsp;I am curious about the one at the church. &nbsp;In a related note, I've always had very good experiences working with churches for concerts, having played oodles of performances in both sanctuaries and parish halls.

				Okay all - <br /><br />I'm talking to a professional organizer / friend of mine who works for Partnership for Parks. She's the one who's helping me look into the rec center. Her name is Emily Maxwell and she can't make the meeting tomorrow either, but I recommend we try and meet with her and David Kay (other dude I mentioned) this weekend. They really seem to have a grasp on what this will entail. <br /><br />It's pretty unfortunate that ARROW, you guys, the Astoria-LIC Waterfront group and the LIC Alliance are all meeting at the same time! Ack! Since I planned the ARROW gathering (several weeks ago) I have to go to that one. I hope you guys will let me know how things go.<br /><br />Joey

				Fatty's Update --<br /><br />I've acquired information but not spoken with Fernando/Sue directly (does that count as cheating?) -- and Fatty's has a no live music policy. &nbsp;They are in a delicate balance with the neighbors and don't want to make too much noise.<br /><br />I didn't want to speak to them directly yet since I think they would be good people to approach for a donation of goods/services. &nbsp;I'd like to ask them for a dinner package to auction off when the idea gels a bit more. &nbsp;I think they're a better fit in this capacity than as a potential venue (especially in light of the music policy).<br /><br />thanks,<br />jayme

				Have sent an email to the Freeze Peach requesting venue space. &nbsp;Will udpate as to response.<br /><br />As with any venue, we may need to modify our plans to accomodate their guidelines. &nbsp;Since it's not a private hall, for instance, it would be inappropriate to ask for a donation at the door. &nbsp;The freeze, however, is a very organic and uniquely community driven place. &nbsp;I think it would be great to use the resources we have access to -- the people and the place are fantastic. &nbsp;It's ideal for a community project.<br /><br />Next planned meeting is Monday.

				There is no limitation on the match at this time. &nbsp;I anticipate this will change or the amount will be capped if it grows to a very large number. &nbsp;The most pressing issue is to determine a venue. &nbsp;After this is done all other aspects can start slipping into place. &nbsp;Hope is the venue will be determined by Tuesday the 13th.

				This was a meeting primarily about venue. &nbsp;We took a change in tactic and discussed the possibility of having two events at smaller venues (Freeze Peach and Waltz) instead of one event at a larger venue. &nbsp;Jayme will be in charge of approaching the Freeze, and Megc will approach Waltz. &nbsp;It was noted that ARROW Community Center is another potential venue, and the possibility of 3 small venues was discussed but not settled on. &nbsp;<br /><br />At present we are planning to meet Monday to discuss the results. &nbsp; Most likely during Jayme's shift. &nbsp;I vote for 7.00.

				Okay. You guys don't still think it would be tough to get stuff and people in and out of FP or Waltz's? <br /><br />I think that's a good idea, but these are small private business, so we're really asking them to throw benefits more than planning our own. This is okay with me, but let's at least try and have different nights for the different venues. The upside is that they're known and already have food/drink n' stuff. Please post FP and Walt's responses so I know what to do with the rec center and ARROW. If its a private business, they'll be the ones making a donation, not ARROW.

				ILoveCheese, thanks for following up with ARROW. &nbsp;It's great that you got such a positive response! &nbsp;Will you be able to come to the meeting on Monday? &nbsp;Perhaps we can discuss it in greater depth then. &nbsp;<br /><br />Yes, if we have multiple venues we will have different dates - no sense in going crazy. &nbsp;<br /><br />The reasons for approaching Waltz and Freeze were most eloquently set forth by megc, and her major points were:<br /><br />- simplicity - we know the owners and they are approachable <br />- the majority of performers and attendees already regularly spend time in both places, particularly the freeze<br />- a smaller venue does mean that we can't have a 6 piece band in, but it is also more amenable to amatures, which most of our performers will be (with the exception of hardened pros like josh, rudy and megc). &nbsp; <br /><br />I admit that I initially wanted a larger venue, but finding and filling a large space represents a cost of time and money, as well as a risk. &nbsp;I think we can make this work, and do it without driving everyone crazy over the next few weeks.

				huh. Those are all pretty good points. Okay, It is good to start small anyway. Plus then the businesses can handle the money. That's a major bonus for them (write-off) and us (less hassle, but no match). <br /><br />I'll be there Monday.

				thanks, Ilovecheese.<br /><br />-I'll be researching performers and confirming dates with them. - if you have someone you know who would be interested please put them in touch with me (or me with them).<br />-I'll also put together some text for marketing and promotions that everyone can use. &nbsp;<br />- for the next meeting I think we'll try having an agenda! &nbsp;woohoo! &nbsp;so be sure and post if you think something should be on the agenda for the next meeting.<br />- I will help with other tasks as I am needed, asked and able.<br /><br />I think there should be more discussion about sponsorships and partnerships and channeling funds &nbsp;(i.e., with arrow and astorians for peace and justice), but i am not the most informed person when it comes to these so i am eager to learn from those who have more to say. &nbsp;<br /><br />1. &nbsp;What exactly are we asking for when we ask for a sponsorship?<br />2. &nbsp;More about the implications of channeling funds/private businesses/nonprofit sponsors/etc etc etc. &nbsp;I know we touched on this tonight but I think it bears further discussion.

				Hey - I just wanted to add, that I do snappy text all the time for my website. If you want to focus on other stuff, I can totally to the promotional material. Before we do that, we need to decide the media and audience we will be marketing to, however.<br /><br />As for money, if we're using commercial venues we need to know if they want to handle the donations. If so, we don't need to talk about it at all. If we do the rec center, then ARROW gets involved. That's really all there is to it. We need to decide a donee now (as opposed to later) for marketing purposes more than anything else.

				Habitat looks good to me.<br /><br />How do you guys want to go about promoting? I could send stuff to a lot of web contacts. Do you guys also want to do a mailing and/or flyer drop-off? It would be good to get a business to donate paper and printing. Anyone able to hook this up?<br /><br />By &quot;sponsorship&quot; I think an organization has to contibute something money and resources to the event. Then they get thier name in lights.

				so we will consider any business that donates any resources or funding a sponsor? &nbsp;works for me!<br /><br />i just got a call from a great venue i tried to reach several times last week, he was on vacation but is very eager to work with us and I am figuratively banging my head against the wall. &nbsp;who knew TOO MANY VENUES was going to become a problem????<br /><br />for promotion i want to leverage the web as much as possible. &nbsp;i'm concerned that flyers would be more litter than anything else, but if others think they could work then let's pool a few $$ and give it a shot. &nbsp;i think your (ilovecheese's) knowledge of the nyc/astoria blog and online community will be a very important part of our reach. &nbsp;we should also take advantage of any local papers with community calendars that will post our dates for free.

				okay guys - I'm off to VT. Please post notes / action items so I can catch up when I get back. I'm sorry to say that I haven't been able to reach Emily yet, but the shoreline cleanup is this week. She must be very busy. I have been too! I'll get her and Central Astoria next week. <br /><br />BTW, I think businesses should have to contribute <em>at least</em> $100 (or that much in goods and services) to be a sponsor. These small venues are going to make it hard to raise very much at all. <br /><br />In the meanwhile, I was think that maybe people should be tasked to head up certain elements of the event(s). We only have a few weeks now. I would imagine these things to be:<br />1) venue<br />2) entertainment<br />3) marketing and promotion (physical and conceptual)<br />4) donations (business and individual)<br />5) logistics<br /><br />Robyn, I think you're in charge. What do you think?

				Robyn has no opinions in the forum, but enigmacat will speak on her behalf :-)<br /><br />It's actually kind of funny that you bring this up, because lanseaux and i were just talking about streamlining our decision-making process. &nbsp;It would be good to have a committee of about 3 to make decisions as they come up. &nbsp;Right now, for instance, I have a couple of items that I will need to make a quick decision on, and waiting until Sunday to bring it up at the meeting may not be an option. &nbsp;I need to be able to make a few quick phone calls and make a decision.<br /><br />I have a few people in mind, based on what I know of their free time, interest in this project, and skills, but I don't want to anyone to feel obligated - I want this to be a choice. &nbsp;I'll be getting in touch with a few people about volunteering for the committee. &nbsp;If you have thoughts on this, please send me a pm or post here.<br /><br />So that we can finalize this quickly, I'm setting up a meeting for Thursday at 9.00 at the Freeze Peach, and the committee selection will be finalized at that time. &nbsp;Speak now or may your peach be forever frozen!!

				My head is spinning. &nbsp;So much has happened today. &nbsp;Lanseaux and I met with a local business owner who very graciously offered to donate two great spaces, plus free buffet. &nbsp;I have bands lined up for each venue. &nbsp;They will iron out details with the venues. &nbsp;I am not counting chickens until they are hatched, so I will wait until the bands set dates with him before I post names publicly. &nbsp;If you can't wait for the scoop come to the meeting tomorrow night!!! &nbsp;<br /><br />I am very excited about this development because it enables to reach out to a new segment of the population, it has the capacity to make an excellent financial contribution, and it's very low-maintenance on our end. &nbsp;We market. &nbsp;We show up and collect cover charges. &nbsp;The space and the food are donated. &nbsp;The bands are more than willing to donate their time and skills. &nbsp;I'm overwhelmed with the generousity that people are showing, and my faith in the human race is beginning to re-emerge. &nbsp;People get a call from a stranger and say &quot;Sure, I'll give my time, my space, my skills, to help you help people.&quot;

				I just want to confirm that this meeting is at 9pm tonight at Freeze Peach. &nbsp;Is this correct? &nbsp;If so, I'll be there.<br /><br />As far as performing, I'll play on both nights, at Waltz as a piano accompanist and at FP as a harpsichordist. &nbsp;It will just be easier that way, I think. &nbsp;I also asked my friend Gabe if he would like to play on the 7th, and he was very enthusiastic about it. &nbsp;He is a great jazz pianist and plays with a saxophonist, and would love a chance for the two of them to perform together.<br /><br />That's all I have on the performer front. &nbsp;As far as a name, I will think about it.<br /><br />I also like the idea of donating to Habitat.

				The notes from tonights meeting - please share your feedback.<br /><br />this was very productive and efficient. &nbsp;thanks Jtrane, megc and zeno for coming! &nbsp;<br /><br />What we accomplished:<br /><br />1. Finalize a Donee - we decided on America's Second Harvest. &nbsp;It's a well-known organization that people will be glad to give to that is directly involved with relief (hunger). &nbsp;<br />2. Finalize Committee - looks like enigmacat, lanseux and ilovecheese<br />3. Venue News and Issues <br />I'm happy to announce that the Josh Irving quintet or quartet will be playing at Mezzo Mezzo on November the 6th. &nbsp;The owner has graciously donated the upstairs space and has offered to provide a free buffet. &nbsp;<br />check out www.joshirvingjazz.com. &nbsp;another musical night is in the works and hopefully will be announced soon.<br />4.

				I will be at the meeting; it's in my book.<br /><br />A few things came up in my talk with Song last night regarding the Waltz concert. &nbsp;I'd love some input/feedback here.<br /><br />1. &nbsp;I need some sort of descriptor for the series of concerts, basically a press release. &nbsp;I've written them before, so I could go ahead and write it, unless someone else is already doing this. &nbsp;I'd like to be able to get something in the next day or so to Song, so that she can put it up on the website. &nbsp;Ideally, this text will be applicable more or less to each of the events.<br /><br />2a. &nbsp;Reservations/Will Call vs. Door tickets. &nbsp;I think the idea of reservations is kind of nice, and would work especially well for the Waltz show. &nbsp;We would need a phone number for reservations, I guess a different number for each event? &nbsp;Unless someone wants to take on this and give out their phone number, but I imagine this is an unsavory idea for most of us. &nbsp;For Waltz at least, I think their number could be used. &nbsp;Could we use the phone number of each of the venues for the particular concert?<br />2b. &nbsp;Are we going to accept checks? &nbsp;Or just cash? &nbsp;<br /><br />3. &nbsp;America's Second Harvest. &nbsp;Is someone contacting them to have reps. at the concerts? &nbsp;I'd like to do the Waltz event as 2 sets, with talking in between by ASH and/or a rep. from this group.<br /><br />Meg

				Title: <strong>The politics of fundraising</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>Stinger</strong> on <strong>October 06, 2005, 11:21:48 PM</strong>
			</dt>
			<dd class="postbody">
				I was informed recently by Zeno that there was an initiative to contact a local Republican politician about supporting our relief efforts.<br /><br />I would like to strongly oppose this initiative. I don’t think I could support a fund raising group that did allow it self to be the product of a political contribution because it would mean to me that I was supporting that politician de facto. While I recognize that it could enhance our ability to raise funds, it would do so with a political price tag. In essence we would become the tag and the politician would get to be the hat.<br /><br />Some may argue that it does not matter if the object is to raise money and we left it open to all politicians. This is a fair argument, however I will still oppose the initiative since it is late in the game to give all politicians a fair run at representation, and because the object is not just about raising money, it’s about helping people. In my opinion I think humanitarian efforts should attempt to remain politically unbiased. Our goal is not to get people to vote. Our goal is not to make a political statement. Our goal is to help the relief effort. If a politician has an unbiased desire to help he/she should give directly to the organization that we are supporting. &nbsp;There is no need to go through our group.<br /><br />This reminds me of another pet peeve I have. I don’t get the feel that this group that we’re giving the money to is really actively behind us. I could be wrong here, so correct me. But are they helping at all besides proving a link on the web page?<br /><br />I would appreciate more discussion on this issue as well as some kind of justification on the part of the board if they decide to go through with this decision.

				i'm a little concerned that this group wants to contact the local political candidates to this event.<br /><br />i dont know how you are going about it. <br /><br />i wouldnt mind putting up a flyer around their offices, etc, but to invite them to tell about the event... that's just strange.<br /><br />if they were involved in the community they would have known about it and would attend the event, and make their donation.<br /><br />but contacting them, especially when stinger is saying that someone is planning on contacting ONE candidate, is a little suspicious, especially when the election is just 30 days away. <br /><br />this group, this event, does not need political support. i'm actually proud that my neighbors have put together this event all on their own without the help of 'larger, bigger, voices' and admire all the VERY hard work that they have done (i myself put together a benefit concert and can empathize with what you are all going through).<br /><br />but this event that is being put on by astorians is a wonderful thing.<br /><strong>it's one community reaching out to another community in need.</strong><br /><br />candidates, and other political officials can attend/donate on their own accord without your invitation. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />just like the rest of us will when we attend tomorrow and in the weeks to come. <br /><br />Rosemary

				I would like to request that people refrain from posting specific political or performance speculation until we have had a chance to discuss the same in the meeting we are planning Tuesday October 11 at 7pm. <br /><br />Speculation on who we may or may not contact is an internal issue and it is not appropriate to do so in a public forum. &nbsp;Everyone interested in having a voice in the matter is invited to the meeting and is more than welcome to express their opinions and concerns in the context of that meeting.

				I want to apologize for my abrasive nature. It wasn't my intention to bring anyone down. I still believe that I brought up some heartfelt issues, but this has been replaced with only a desire to see the events go through to success.<br /><br />For my own (as well as other's) peace of mind I will distance myself from the group. I will still meet with enigmacat and flooze concerning the silent auction and take part in that event, but I will not be present for the Tuesday meeting nor will I concern myself with any other aspect of the enterprise. Everyone has worked so hard for a worthy cause and know that I am rooting for you all the way. Events in my personal life have taken precendence however, and I feel that the stress that this has caused would only be counterproductive to everyone's sincere efforts.<br /><br />I commend you All,<br />-Zeno.

				I do think if we are having a polical bend to the fundraisng it should be something that can be discussed in the open. People are spending their money and have a right to know these things. <br /><br />I am releived to find out that appears not to be the case.<br /><br />I would like to think that by inquiring about America's Second Harvest I did not lead anyone to the conclusion that we were going the wrong direction by using them. I was just hoping to see a little more about them.

				Hi folks. So -- Steve-o and I are going to do another round of canvassing for the Hurricane Relief events, in the neighb this weekend. If anyone hasn't canvassed or is so inspired to do more canvassing (nothing else gives you that warm, fuzzy feeling!), please let me know!<br /><br />People won't find out through osmosis. Unfortunately.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Cheese
