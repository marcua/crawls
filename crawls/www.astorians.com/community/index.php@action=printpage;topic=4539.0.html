				I just took up knitting - where do all the crafty people around here buy (preferably inexpensive) yarn? I know there&#39;s a Michael&#39;s nearby - are there other options? Or recommended stores in Manhattan? I&#39;ve only been to one so far - seemed kinda pricy.

				There is a little crafty store on Ditmars near 36th Street.&nbsp; I was just in there buying needles and they had a lot of stuff, for such a small store.&nbsp; It so close, definitely worth checking out.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been to the Michael&#39;s on Northern Blvd (thanks, flooz!), and they had some yarn there.&nbsp; I bought some and made a hat (http://farm1.static.flickr.com/128/336960317_f610784b0c_o.jpg) this week from it.<br /><br />I just went to Purl in SoHo (http://purlsoho.com) and they had beautiful yarn.&nbsp; I bought some gorgeous stuff from Manos del Uruguay.&nbsp; Here&#39;s a picture of the colors (http://farm1.static.flickr.com/143/336960314_bb70f6e6ac_o.jpg).&nbsp; I like their statement on the tag: <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Manos was established with a very clear objective: to give support to Uruguayan craftswomen acting as a net of social promotion all along the country. Its purpose was and is the economic, social and cultural development of its members and the environment in which they live.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It is pricy, though.&nbsp; But if I like it a lot, I&#39;d go back from time to time for hot yarn.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#39;m also curious to see what the yarn costs at the USq Greenmarket, too.&nbsp; I know there are wool people there sometimes.<br /><br />I&#39;ve also heard that Smiley&#39;s is a good place, too.<br /><br />Here&#39;s a list of yarn stores in the area:<br />http://www.nyccrochetguild.org/ResourceFile/YarnStores.html
