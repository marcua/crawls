				Here&#039;s the deal folks.

				Well AAPA, I&#039;m not necessarily saying you shouldn&#039;t go to law school.&nbsp; I&#039;m saying you shouldn&#039;t go to law school if the reason why you want to go is to become a well rounded person.&nbsp; I guess you need to help me here.&nbsp; Do you want to practice law?&nbsp; Do you know what about the law interests you?&nbsp; Or what areas of the law interest you?&nbsp; You mentioned wanting to make full use of your entrepreneurial skills but you don&#039;t want to do corporate law, so i&#039;m not quite sure how law school well help you.&nbsp; Unless you are carving some very specific nitch for yourself where you could utilize your law degree, it will be tough.

				law school made me more rounded.&nbsp; I gained about 25 pounds.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br /><br />Law school does not make you more well rounded or more intelligent. Law school is a place where you pay $70 to $100 thousands dollars in order to be an attorney.&nbsp; It doe snot teach you to think, it does not teach you the law, it doe sbnot teach you how to be an attorney.<br /><br />I was an honors student my whole life, i was never so brain dead as the day i graduated law school.&nbsp; Law school as a whole teaches you nothing.&nbsp; It does not encourage critical thinking, just the opposite.&nbsp; There is no intelligent discussion.&nbsp; memorization that is about it.<br /><br />Also Law school is like a loan shark for the legal profession.&nbsp; You pay all this money and get alot of student loans.&nbsp; Then you are out of school and you are an attorney and you say &quot;Oh crap i hate being an attorney&quot;&nbsp; but you can&#039;t change jobs cause you need the extra money to pay for your law school loans.&nbsp; I am convinced that is why law school is so expensive, it is the only way to get people to keep working as lawyers.<br /><br />

				Gentlemen,<br /><br />My interests are in international trade law, real estate law, and entertainment law. Odds are that i will wind up in one of those three fields as I have the most experience and am interested in them. After graduating from law school (if i even attend) i may wind up in a completely different field. Who knows?<br /><br />I&#039;m ready for the next step in my educational career and ultimately want to work for and represent myself. A masters degree would definitely improve my knowledge in the fields listed above. I am intersted in improving my skills of interpretation, critical thinking, and my understanding of the basis of the system and rules that govern the society I live and work in. I have not found an alternative to a JD that offers me this.<br /><br />Matty, I&#039;m extremely interested in knowing where you went to school and what your are doing now.

				I wish you the best of luck on the LSAT and in your career.&nbsp; My last advice to you is this.<br /><br />Work at a law firm before you go to law school.&nbsp; It seems like you have a good job so it might be tough to do, but you would test drive a $100,000 car before you buy it, right?&nbsp; well you will spend that much at law school, you have to know what you are getting into before you spend all that money.<br /><br />Also I agree with AJTNYC.&nbsp; Those are tough areas to go into.&nbsp; And I have done real estate law.&nbsp; The thing about real estate law is this. At the closing, the person making the least money is who?&nbsp; That&#039;s right the attorney.&nbsp; The broker, the people involved in the transaction, even the title insurance guy make more money. No reason to be an attorney if you like real estate, just get your brokers license.&nbsp; <br /><br />

I think lots of people (especially my age) look at master&#039;s degrees as far too expensive for the possible benefits. I think they look to law school as a degree that &quot;means something&quot; and just go for it because it seems more attractive than most. <br /><br />I will probably leave corporate law and try to work either in public law, a non-profit or NGO before I go to law school.<br /><br />I definitely seem to think that it is smarter for me to have more experience and really know what I want before going back to school and, from what I&#039;ve read, the law schools agree.

				I really enjoy all of these responses. Thanks. I&#039;d like to comment on the following entries. &quot;I agree with Matty when he says he law school does not teach you the law or how to be a lawyer.&quot; - ATJ &amp; &quot;Work at a law firm before you go to law school.&quot; Matty3Bucks.<br /><br />I&#039;m not necessarily sure that i want to be a lawyer, but i would like to have a law degree. I essentially work at a law firm. Personally I consult clients on matters regarding federal regulation; when the going gets tough i get one of the big guys in my office on the phone.<br /><br />What I really want to know is:<br /><br /><strong>IS ANYONE ELSE IN ASTORIA BESIDES ME TAKING THE LSAT THIS SATURDAY?</strong> If not, good job ATJ and Matty!

				While I had to do some math to figure out how long ago I took the LSAT, I&#039;ll wish you the best of luck!&#160; <br /><br />Overall, though, I pretty much agree with what Matty and AJ have said.&#160; Like Matty said, law school doesn&#039;t teach you how to be a lawyer - that knowledge is something you can gain only with practice.&#160; You may not want your law degree in order to be a lawyer, but your law degree will be more valuable to you in a <em>non-lawyer</em> position if you have some experience as a practicing attorney under your belt to back up the degree.

				I didn&#039;t want to chime in, but I feel I have to.<br /><br />A professor of mine - a smart guy and a great mentor - begged me not to go to law school.&#160; I was like &quot;how else am I suppose to market myself and stand out from the crowd?&quot;.&#160; Law School was a means to an end.&#160; I looked at it as a ticket to a better career, and by default, a better lifestyle.&#160; Law schools are always touting how much the average salary thier student make the first year out of school.&#160; Let me tell you what actually happened.<br /><br />Law school was extraordinarily difficult.&#160; Life was spent studying, studying, and more studying.&#160; This was not college anymore where I was the lone smart kid in the class.&#160; Everyone at law school is the same smart kid in class.&#160; I couldn&#039;t just read a few pages, cram the night before and still do well.&#160; I had to prepare by reading every night till my eyes bled.&#160; Challenging...Yes.&#160; Fun...absolutely not.&#160; <br /><br />Not to mention your competing against your friends for coveted spots, like law review, student aid positions and summer internships.&#160; You start to learn quickly how real world &quot;politics&quot; actually work.<br /><br />So then you graduate, and it&#039;s off to take the bar.&#160; Again, a summer completely gone from your life (assuming that you pass it the first time).&#160; And right after, it&#039;s off to find a job.<br /><br />Only here&#039;s the part the law school brochures don&#039;t tell you...top firms only look for three things:<br />1) Where you went to law school<br />2) What rank you graduated in<br />3) Whether you were on law review<br /><br />Most of the top firms won&#039;t even LOOK at your resume unless you come from a top school, graduate in the top 10% of your class, and you were on law review.&#160; If you don&#039;t have that on your resume, they won&#039;t even consider you.<br /><br />So if you don&#039;t have this criteria, and you don&#039;t have a good hookup with a law firm right after graduation (which is why they say your 2L summer internship is so critical), you&#039;re now back to competing against all those other people who just graduated all the other law schools in your same year.&#160; And there are a ton of them...all wanting the same jobs your looking for.<br /><br />Now, if you become part of this group of lost souls, you then realize that you&#039;re not going to be making the big bucks, and firms are NOT knocking down your door.&#160; And the salaries being offered at this point for the jobs that are left for recent grads are a lot closer to what many of your friends (who, incidently, worked the last three years and didn&#039;t go to grad school) are making.&#160; Remember in the first paragraph when I refered to those salary numbers that the schools often mention?&#160; Well, you then learn after you graduate that those numbers only reflect the salaries of those grads who voluntarily provide thier salary information.&#160; And guess who those people are?&#160; Yeah, those are the one&#039;s at the top of the class who made law review (or who already had a job through a family member upon graduation).&#160; If the entire class were to put up thier first year salary numbers, the true number would be far lower.<br /><br />Oh, and as was already mentioned, you&#039;ll probably have a boatload of debt that&#039;ll start to come due right out of law school.&#160; And with the strict standards on loans nowadays, banks are not so willing to consolidate those loans into one low interest loan.&#160; So your loan payments are going to be large...very large.<br /><br />And then there&#039;s the issue of job satisfaction.&#160; I&#039;ve only met one lawyer...one...in my entire post-graduate career who was truly happy as a lawyer.&#160; As soon as I got a gig on wall street, you&#039;d be surprised how many of my friends begged me to send in thier resume to my firms.&#160; <br /><br />-----------------<br /><br />I mention all of this, because as was mentioned earlier, it feels as though there&#039;s an ethical obligation to spare others of what the &quot;reality&quot; of getting a law degree is.&#160; But hey, if you can get into Harvard or Columbia law, then by all means go for it.&#160; And even if you don&#039;t do that, maybe you&#039;ll graduate at the top of St.John&#039;s or Cardoza law, in which case, you&#039;re still ok.&#160; And even if that&#039;s not the case either, maybe you have no wife or kids and are sitting on a nice trust fund.&#160; So you&#039;ll get your degree without any financial incumberance.<br /><br />But if you don&#039;t fall into any of these scenarios, as I did, be VERY wary.&#160; The road after law school will be much, much, MUCH harder than you think.&#160; <br /><br />My 2-cents...for what it&#039;s worth.

				NYCGoalie, I agree with pretty much everything you said. I graduated from Cardozo Law (it&#039;s Cardozo, not Cardoza)... a fairly young school (by law school standards) usually ranked around 50 nationally, but they just threw a boatload of money into improving the place, so I&#039;d expect it to continue rising in the rankings over the next few years. That said, it took many of my classmates ages to get jobs after school (and that was before the dotcom bust that had record numbers applying to law school -- I imagine it&#039;s worse now). A lot of my classmates ended up doing temp contract work (and nearly a decade out, some of them still are). Unless you are independently wealthy and will get out of law school without student loan debt, or your committment to practicing law is so great, then I would seriously consider how much debt you are willing to take on for this education -- odds are it won&#039;t pay off for decades. <br /><br />And for what it&#039;s worth, I LOVE being a lawyer... it was worth every bit of the $120K of debt I&#039;m in (providing I win the lottery and can someday actually pay it off). <br />

You have to want to go, even if, in the back of your head, you have read the books and heard the stories and know it&#039;s going to suck.<br /><br />Although I agree that if you get into a good school, make law review and graduate at or near the top of your class, odds are you are pretty golden, but all is not lost if you are not.&nbsp; Just let your ambition, drive and desire motivate you to get where you need/want to be in life (whether you go to law school or not).&nbsp;

				I have a question for all of y&#039;all...<br /><br />While I have really enjoyed living in NYC and will probably stay here for a while, I am definitely thinking about going to law school and really making my home in another city. I am fabulously in love with New Orleans and really think that I could spend the better part of my life there.<br /><br />My questions:<br /><br />1) Do you think that the need to be in a super elite school is necessary primarily in NYC and the north east because of the abundance of T14 schools? Can a smaller school, like Tulane, be a good choice provided that you want to remain in the place with the school?<br /><br />and<br /><br />2) Did you all go to school in NYC? If so, how hard would it be for you to move to another area and work there? What kind of things would you have to do to be able to move if you wanted to still work as a lawyer?<br />

				AJ-- I think once I leave NYC, it will probably be for good. I most likely will not go to law school here and I won&#039;t want to practice here. Part of what I&#039;ve learned in working at this big firm is that I like the work, but not many elements of the atmosphere. I&#039;m much more interested in moving somewhere new for school in a few years (I&#039;m takin&#039; my sweet old time) and then staying there for a while.<br /><br />AAPA -- I think that you&#039;re taking people&#039;s advice and concerns the wrong way. From the responses of several attorneys I know, it seems like everyone who meets an attny is &quot;thinking about law school&quot;. Heck, a lot of my none-too-bright friends are &quot;thinking about law school&quot;. I think they just were asking you questions about what you want to do with your degree and why you want to go because they&#039;re important things to think about. I&#039;ve spent the last year and a half practicing the LSAT, reading blogs and forums about law school and the negative and positive experiences therein and I still want a little&nbsp; more time to prepare and make sure that it is what I want. It&#039;s a big investment that too many people take too lightly. They weren&#039;t trying to be nasty or aggressive, just trying to see how well you&#039;ve vetted the idea. You shouldn&#039;t take these responses as negative.

				It went. Thank you for asking. I will not be canceling my score. Unfortunately I&#039;m really not sure whether I did really well or poorly. I definitely did not ace it. What ever will be will be. Th&#039;s past week was a blur. Seriously it does not feel like a week passed. It hasn&#039;t hit me yet that the prep has ended. I had been studying since June; going to classes twice a week and having no social life a all. I&#039;m pretty buzzed right now. On the road back to my usual self. VIVA LA LSAT. VIVA LA VIDA!!!

				I had books with the previous tests too.&nbsp; But Kaplan does a great job of teaching you logic game strategy to apply to those real questions.&nbsp; So really, you use them hand in hand.<br /><br />Seriously though... I prepped myself for the test last December and did fairly well.&nbsp; Then in the next few months I focused exclusively on the logic games (which was my weakest area), relying heavily on that book for strategy development, and improved dramatically when I retook the test in February.<br /><br />Of course, just taking the test a seond time will always help.&nbsp; But implementing strategy to save time (crucial factor on the test) is big.

				Did those books actually help? I was so busy studying for the GRE and a subject GRE test that I was taking before the LSAT that I never managed to study for the LSAT. I think I took one practice test and that was pretty much it. I&#039;m still considering a JD down the road after I finish grad school, so it may be good to keep in mind. Though for my purposes, I may just need a masters in legal studies or something along those lines.

				Yes, they help.&nbsp; I am sure that private prep courses would help, too, if you want to go that route.&nbsp; But I didn&#039;t have the money for one when I went through the LSAT process, and I had just left a job so I had lots of time to devote to studying on my own every day.&nbsp; I relied on the following three books:<br /><br />1.) 10 Actual LSAT PrepTests (A book containing the questions and answers, but little more than that, from actual LSATs.&nbsp; I recommend a lot of repetition to become as afmailiar as possible with the questions you&#039;ll face on the real test.&nbsp; Additionally, and this probably goes without saying, it&#039;s a great idea to conduct these under timed conditions.&nbsp; The time constraints are a major hurdle on this test)<br />2.) LSAT 180, by Kaplan (This book is a comprehensive review of strategies for all sections, but it focuses on the most difficult questions in each of the sections.&nbsp; As the title implies, the book is designed for people who are trying to get an extremely high score.&nbsp; Depending on your comfort with the material, it may be more adviseable to start with their more general book.)<br />3.) Logic Games Workbook, by Kaplan&nbsp; (As I mentioned earlier in this thread, I found this book to be the single biggest difference maker for me personally.&nbsp; After taking the actual test the first time, I identified that this was an area of struggle for me, and I used every inch of this book to turn that around.&nbsp; They teach you essential techniques about how to map out or sketch out your solutions to the logic games.&nbsp; After using this book and faithfully applying its principles, you should not have a problem with the much feared logic games.)

				I believe that the more time you devote to studying the better you will do on the LSAT. I took Test Masters Prep course and although it was expensive I think it was fairly priced. I knew that I had issues with logic games and I spent a lot of time reviewing my skills. I think Test Masters presented excellent skills for solving logic games. The main issue with me was time. I was working 50 - 60 hrs a week, going to school eight hours a week, and spending all of my free time studying. It&#039;s not easy; it&#039;s a sacrifice. I could have sacrificed more than I did and really kicked those logic games, but i did not. At least I do not think I did. My personal recommendation would be to&nbsp; hire the best private tutor that you can find and get focused.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=12444.msg153717.html#msg153717">Quote from: paratactical on October 07, 2008, 09:25:17 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Well, if you decide you want to retake the test, let me know.

				Oh, I don&#039;t think I would ever go so far as taking a course or hiring a private tutor. I did fairly well without studying; it would just be if I wanted to boost my score slightly. Seems like books would be the way to go for me if that was something I decided to go back to in the future.
