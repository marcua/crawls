				I noticed a lot of cops on foot patrol today in area of 28th and 29th streets, between Broadway and 34th avenue.&nbsp; &nbsp;All afternoon, just standing around, occasionally taking short walks.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not giving out tickets, even more unusual.&nbsp; &nbsp; I was visiting aunt who lives in that area, and did not go far from there all day. I&#039;m wondering if it was like that all around Astoria, or if anyone else in area mentioned noticed.

				That was strange thing, these guys were actually patrolling, and seemed to be looking out for something.&nbsp; No tickets being given out.&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe they had reports of crime in that particular area, or were there as deterant?

				I saw an unusually high amount of police in the subway stations I passed through yesterday. (I take the N to Herald Square.) I wonder if it&#039;s related?

				My N train was held in Queensboro Plaza for around 15 this morning while the police searched for a bank robbery suspect.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s related, but there were a lot of cops in the station.

				I was on the same N train held in Queensboro Plaza this morning.&nbsp; Cops came into the cars to look around a few times.&nbsp; I strongly suspect that that and all of the other police activity is related to a bank robbery which took place this morning at 31-16 30th Ave.&nbsp; I think that is the Flushing Savings Bank...am I correct?<br /><br />From Gothamist.com newsmaps:<br />Bank Robbery | 31-16 30th Ave Queens, NY | 3/16/2010 9:20 a.m.
