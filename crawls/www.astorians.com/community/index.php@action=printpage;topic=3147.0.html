Most of them (http://www.ffpc.com/images/HardRock2.jpg) already come ready to put on with a small rubber band. If you search, probably eBay, you might be able to get someone to give you a quantity discount since you want them all to be the same<br /><br />Any way you do it, they are gonna be adorable.

				<em>1) Do you also want the ties to be waterproof?</em><br />yes. they&#39;ll be floating in a non-swimming pool<br /><em>2) What fabric did you have in mind?</em><br />none really. whatever&#39;s easiest. i had imagined ribbon.<br /><em>3) Do you care if the ties are *not* removeable?</em><br />nope. i intend on letting people steal them at the end of the night.<br /><em>4) What is your time frame?</em><br />september 30th<br /><em>5) What color?</em><br />black. these go with some girl duckies (http://eprice.stores.yahoo.net/minirubberduck.html) that will have veils. (for my wedding&nbsp; :smitten:)<br /><br />the labor intensive portion would bother me at all. i could teach my mother how to make the bows too and i think we could have 50 of them made in one night. the other advantage to making them myself is they can be fitted to just the right size, where some of the infant bows still seem like they&#39;ll appear to bulky. the ducks are small [2.5&quot;(L) x 2&quot;(W) x 2.25&quot;(H)]<br /><br />thanks for your interest NYCMacUser!

				At the risk of sounding like a *insert non-offensive, less-than-a-man term here*... I think that&#39;s an adorable idea.&nbsp; &nbsp;:oops:<br /><br />Best wishes for your upcoming nuptials.&nbsp; (however you spell it)
