				I also think it&#039;s the fact that he seems to hold little respect for the record he now holds. I know I&#039;m not the only baseball fanatic who wishes that there were the kinds of stand up, respectable, well-spoken men that used to play the game on the feild today. We want our records holders to be good guys; we want heroes. Bonds hasn&#039;t given us any reason to put him in that cateogory. If he&#039;d been even the least bit respectful, the asterisk wouldn&#039;t have ended up on that ball. <br /><br />Frankly, you&#039;re right and maybe it&#039;s flawwed to want that from our players, but they have such potential to be such powerful, positive forces on their fans, children and adults alike, that it seems so incredibly foolish to squander that opportunity the way Bonds has.

				Bonds is a jerk and everyone knows it.&nbsp; But Ty Cobb was the biggest ass of all and they didnt remove his records because of it.&nbsp; <br /><br />As there was not any rule in baseball banning steroids or &quot;performance enhancing drugs&quot; at the time of his record, then there is no argument. The record is his; but should one not wish to recognize it, that&#039;s their opinion.<br /><br />Personally I can&#039;t stand the bastard, but then again neither can anyone else. <br /><br />&nbsp;
