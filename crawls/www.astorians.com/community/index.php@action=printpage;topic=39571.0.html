				I live in a rent stabilized building in Astoria. My landlord is trying to raise my rent a crazy amount. I consulted with an attorney who said this seems to be illegal based on the rent history and paperwork. The legal fees to fight this, however, will probably be $7500-$10,000. Has anyone ever had a similar situation? I don&#039;t know where to turn to for help. It seems that even with stabilization laws, the landlord can do what he wants unless I want to take him to court or spend two years waiting for a ruling from DHCR. If anyone has advice or has successfully beaten this type of situation, I would love your input. I also don&#039;t want to end up on the black list.

This is your <span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 16px;" class="bbc_size">&quot;legal regulated rent&quot;. </span></span>He/She can only raise your rent by the prescribes amount. Anything outside of that is really easy to dispute. If you take him to Housing Court, he will be fined and your rent will be regulated at the legal amount. You do not need a lawyer for this.

				I believe that the city is starting to provide more resources to tenants who are being harassed by landlords or who are facing illegal rent increases, so you may not have to pay for representation.<br /><br /><br />It seems like a good first resource might be to call the city&#039;s Rent Info line (718-739-6400). They also have an email address listed on their page: http://www.nyshcr.org/AboutUs/ContactUs.htm. (This page may also be informative: http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/service/2340/rent-regulation)<br /><br /><br />Good luck! This must be very stressful.

				be sure to check if the rent you started with was a &quot;preferential&quot; rent.&nbsp; If so, they can raise it up quite a bit more than the usual 2%.

				Knowledge is power as they say, and it&#039;s a good idea for all tenants in Rent-Stabil apartments to know the rental history of their particular unit, and the term length (expiration date) of the 421(a) tax abatement status afforded to the building/landlord.<br /><br />Much to my surprise, I found the NYC RGB or DHCR (can&#039;t recall exactly which office I contacted....) very helpful in answering questions over the phone, and providing me with hard copy documentation showing when rent-stabilization for my building as a whole would end (and all apartments within then become &#039;market rate&#039;).&nbsp; I also got a document that listed all former tenants of my particular apartment, the term lengths of their leases, and how much the rent increased each year, and how much the rent increased when one tenant vacated and a new tenant moved in (i.e., &#039;vacancy lease&#039;).&nbsp; This in turn gave me insight into the Landlord&#039;s M.O.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; &nbsp; I saw that prior to say 2010, the rental increases were very low to none, from one year to the next.&nbsp; Once the LL realized that Astoria was becoming &#039;hot&#039;, suddenly the rental increases were higher.&nbsp; And of course, for vacancy leases, the rent was a few hundred more than for the tenants who had vacated.<br /><br />As others here have said, the law is very clear and you shouldn&#039;t need a lawyer for this.&nbsp; Your LL is probably just trying to &#039;intimidate&#039; you into submission, but most people who own property are not dumb, and they know they law.&nbsp; If you show indication that you too know the law, the LL&nbsp; would then be smart to back down.&nbsp; So long as your unit truly falls under Rent-Stabil guidelines, then he cannot raise your rent as much as he wants.&nbsp; He can only raise it as high as the &#039;Legal Rent&#039; amount determined by the city, for that unit.&nbsp; However, some landlords charge below the Legal Rent ceiling, at what is referred to as &#039;Preferential Rent&#039;.&nbsp; In such an instance, it doesn&#039;t matter if the Preferential Rent charged is even Hundreds of Dollars below the maximum Legal Rent amount.&nbsp; If at the next lease renewal, the LL then decides that he is going to up your rent by Hundreds of Dollars, to bring it up to that maximum Legal Rent amount, then that is within his rights.<br /><br />So.... find out what is the legal Maximum Rent for your unit.&nbsp; Find out when the 421(a) Tax Abatement status for your building comes to an end.&nbsp; And get a record of the rental history for your particular unit.&nbsp; Good luck!<br /><br />+++++++++<br /><br />To first determine if in fact your bldg. is Rent-Stabil, check this listing.&nbsp; It is sorted first by zip code.&nbsp; Once you locate your zip code, buildings are sorted by Streets, Avenues, Blvds, etc., and within each of those, in numerical order...<br /><br />http://www.nycrgb.org/downloads/resources/sta_bldngs/2014QueensBldgs.pdf<br /><br />
