				Hey,<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;ll get a share this year but it would be great if I could line someone up to do the share with me if I get it!<br /><br />Please PM me.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Cheryl

				My husband and I are on the waiting list for a share too (and can take a full share or split one, whichever allows us to actually join!). They sent me an email saying that it was unlikely we&#039;d be able to actually join this year. Please PM me if you get to join and still need a partner. Thanks!

				Hey,&nbsp; I am still on the list and haven&#039;t heard anything yet.<br />I definitely need a share partner...can&#039;t imagine having all of those veggies for just me.&nbsp; It would be too much of a waste of food.<br /><br />PM me and we can chat about it.<br />Thanks!

				How do you find out if you are of the lucky few who get to join?&nbsp; I&#039;m on the waiting list as well (I would love to share w/ someone if that is an option), and I&#039;ve emailed asking what was going on, but haven&#039;t heard anything back.&nbsp; My understanding is that it was going to open up to new members around March 13th.&nbsp; Is that not true?

				I am a little confused.&nbsp; Does the farm not have enough vegetables and fruits for everyone or are they just limiting what they give to a CSA and what they choose to sell on their own?&nbsp; If they have enough to sell off, then why not just add more people to the CSA?&nbsp; <br /><br />Sorry if I sound ignorant on the subject but I am just learning about CSA&#039;s.

				Unfortunately, we are limited to a certain number of shares by what the farmer can give us.&nbsp; Our farmer supplies several CSAs around NYC, in addition to selling produce at a farm stand.&nbsp; Right now, city-wide, there is an incredible demand for CSAs, and it&#039;s putting a real strain on area famers to supply everyone with good quality produce.&nbsp; Just Food, the CSA umbrella organisation in NYC, is working hard to expand supply, but it&#039;s not easy.<br /><br />To all of you who are on the waitlist, we&#039;re keeping track, and you should be hearing from us soon!&nbsp; Astorians is a great place to find a share partner - threads like this are perfect.
