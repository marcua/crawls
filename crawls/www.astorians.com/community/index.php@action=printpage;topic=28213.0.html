				I&#039;ve been writing to them about the 103 for years.<br /><br /><br />It still stops running bizarrely early.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if the service has started yet, but if you wanted to take the 103 to the Gantry area to try to see the fireworks on the 4th, you&#039;d still have been screwed when it&#039;s time to leave.&nbsp; And if you don&#039;t think it&#039;s a long hot scary walk to any other bus line, you&#039;ve never walked it.&nbsp; Apparently no one in charge at the MTA has walked it.<br /><br /><br />It&#039;s better, but not where I want to be yet.<br /><br /><br />Thanks for reporting it, 28Grand

				I have no experience w/the Q103, but the adjustment on the Q102 is ridiculously inconvenient and not an improvement for the people who&#039;ve now lost service. It now runs pretty much the same as the Q18. For people who used those stops on Crescent and on Newtown Avenue, this &#039;adjustment&#039; means they&#039;ve lost their bus route. <br /><br /><br />Not sure if this is true, but one thing I&#039;ve heard is that this &#039;improvement/adjustment&#039; was to create more parking spaces. If that&#039;s true, that&#039;s a lame reason to inconvenience paying riders. <br /><br /><br />And if that&#039;s not the reason, why was the route really changed?

				ladydi -- from the Queens Chronicle article it appears that the Q102 route was changed to increase speed (and the extension of the Q19 to accommodate the stops that the Q102 doesn&#039;t stop at anymore):<br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="bbc_font">&quot;The MTA said changes to the Q19 also will accommodate those aimed at making the Q102 route a faster one.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="bbc_font">The Q102 in Astoria has been adjusted to keep the route on 30th Avenue between Crescent Street and 8th Street.&quot;</span><br /><br />

				I did read the article. I just know that my significant other lost the stop that&#039;s been in front of his building for many years. Expanding the other route doesn&#039;t do him much good. <br /><br /><br />Now when it&#039;s raining hard or snowing, he doesn&#039;t have the convenience of getting the 102 home anymore. And to us, having the 102 on 30th Ave. along with the Q18 doesn&#039;t make much sense. Maybe because we don&#039;t drive and mass transit is how we get around this bothers us more than other people.<br /><br /><br />There&#039;s a big difference in having the stop in front of your building or just down the block as opposed to one or two avenues away.
