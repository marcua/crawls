				Public parking, like driving itself, is a privilege and not a right. This area was not designed for everyone to own and drive a car. Those are the breaks for having a car in the middle of the most densely populated area in the country.

				you are correct Public parking is a privilege but when surrounding areas without construction have street cleaning days 2 days compared to our 4 days .People question.We the Drivers do pay for the right to drive thru our taxes, registrations and inspection .Oh and those Hefty fines if you don&#039;t follow the rule.<br /><br /><br />The area is question right now is a nightmare.Years back I think Park slope or Dumbo had a similar situation and they suspended the rules while the areas was under construction.<br /><br /><br />We are in a densely populated area and it only going to get worse.We are starting to rename our area the sardine can.LOLOL<br />I personally feel for those on the subways.<br />I do hope they do alter street cleaning here<br /><br /><br />Cassie

				That&#039;s the thing Cassie, you have a legitimate complaint and a solution. You want parking regulations to be suspended on streets with construction. Why not put it on the record with the people who may be able to do something about it?

				<br />Something does need to give re: people in NYC and their private cars.&nbsp; It&#039;ll never happen, but I&#039;d like to see all families limited to One car.&nbsp; Why on earth one family needs multiple cars, in this, the capital of public transportation cities, never ceases to amaze me.<br /><br />Not to mention people hopping in their cars to....go to Dunkin Donuts right within their own nabe and then.... DOUBLE-PARK??!!&nbsp; Thereby not only slowing down other cars but....MTA buses??&nbsp; You know, the very buses that some residents are good enough to use to save the environment and help cut down on traffic?<br /><br />I am so sick and tired of my public transportation commute being delayed because of lazy selfish S#$@S who insist on driving anywhere and everywhere that is more than a block from their home, and who think nothing of double-parking, not just in a lane of traffic, but often times dead in the middle of an MTA bus stop!&nbsp; The audacity of some drivers is mind-numbing.<br /><br />This will only worsen as the population and unbridled property development continue to increase in Astoria and other outer-borough nabes.<br /><br />I moved to NYC 15 years ago and I never would have thought that NYers would be so attached to their cars.&nbsp; I expect that in the suburbs, not in a dense city such as NYC.&nbsp;

Hence the many attached rowhouses with shared parking in the rear. The problem is that this area is now overpopulated, by broke kids that shack up 4 to a room to enjoy the city life until reality hits and they move back to where they came from. You know what annoys me? When I get in my car on a Saturday and I have to drive&nbsp; around 4 UHAUL trucks on every block because of all the idiots coming and going.

				&quot;Please don&#039;t be offended by this but...&quot;, some here act like selfish little kwy babies who call others names when they disagree with them.<br /><br />Regardless of the supposed rationale behind how Astoria homes and streets were initially designed and laid out, does not change the fact that in NYC, one can get anywhere they need to, in the five boroughs and beyond, via any combination of bicycle, subway, bus, ferry, taxi, Zipcar, Metro North, LIRR, PATH.&nbsp; &nbsp;And in fact, millions of us do just that each and every day, with no car.<br /><br />Since someone here seems to know so much about prior generations and their various jobs, I&#039;m curious to know where these jobs were located, whereby Astoria residents had &#039;no other choice&#039; but to get to them via car.&nbsp; I guess these jobs were located outside of NYC and/or existed before the NYC subway system was built?? <br /><br />Robert Moses anyone?

				<br />Another observation I&#039;ve made about the car culture in Astoria is...<br /><br />most cars seem to be gas-guzzling SUVs.&nbsp; Why do people need such huge cars?&nbsp; How did families get by without SUVs back in the day, and when families were even larger?<br /><br />It&#039;s not uncommon for me to see a car &#039;parked&#039; on a residential sidewalk, facing the home&#039;s garage, with the back of the car in between two legally parked cars, and the front of&nbsp; the&nbsp; car on the sidewalk, allowing just enough space for pedestrians to walk onto their driveway and curve back around onto the sidewalk.&nbsp; In such instances, there is a SECOND car that this same family has, parked in their driveway.&nbsp; So you might ask... &#039;and what about their garage?...is there a third car in the garage?&quot;&nbsp; No, usually not.&nbsp; And why not?...oh, well that would be because their garage is full of JUNK...&nbsp; Stuff, stuff and more stuff.<br /><br />Then these people have the audacity to demand &#039;more parking spots&#039;.<br /><br />Everyone&nbsp; in a family apparently must have &#039;their own car&#039;.&nbsp; Folks can&#039;t rideshare.&nbsp; Folks can&#039;t pick up or drop off a family member.&nbsp; Folks can never use publlic transportation or a taxi.&nbsp; Everyone &#039;must&#039; be able to get in their own car and&nbsp; Go, whenever they want, 24/7.&nbsp; Everyone buys stuff on Black Friday, just for the sake of it.&nbsp; QVC.&nbsp; Everyone wants large flatscreen TVs, and&nbsp; the&nbsp; next year they want an even bigger one.<br /><br />Put it all together, and it&#039;s just a really disgusting way to live.&nbsp; Self-centered and such an utter waste of resources...clogging our streets, polluting the air, filling our landfills with more unwanted/old stuff....<br /><br />I get that the old-school Astorians resent newcomers moving in and trying to alter the neighborhood to their preferred way of living.&nbsp; But just because that&#039;s the way Astoria has always been (a car-centric neighborhood) doesn&#039;t make it right.&nbsp; People need to really think about their&nbsp; lifestyle choices and ask themselves why they are so resistant to considering change, or other ways of being.&nbsp; The thing is, after a certain age, most people should NOT be behind the wheel of a car.&nbsp; Eyesight goes, people literally &#039;shrink&#039; and can&#039;t see over the wheel, and reaction time slows down.&nbsp; Certain older people behind the wheel put themselves and&nbsp; others in danger.&nbsp; After a certain age, drivers should be re-tested every year in order to maintain their licenses.<br /><br />So wouldn&#039;t it be in drivers&#039; own interest to not be so dependent on&nbsp; their&nbsp; cars?&nbsp; Because one day, your license could be totally taken away from you.&nbsp; When this happens to drivers, they often say they&#039;ve &#039;lost their independence&#039;, and then they become depressed.&nbsp; True independence and freedon however, IMHO, is in NOT owning a car.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never owned a car in my life and have no interest in&nbsp; ever owning one.&nbsp; I manage just fine getting where I need to and want to, and I save thousands of dollars each year&nbsp; in the process.&nbsp; No parking fees.&nbsp; No shoveling.&nbsp; No registration,&nbsp; inspection, repair, gas, toll fees.&nbsp; No AAA membership fee.&nbsp; No parking headaches.&nbsp; No traffic jams.&nbsp; Not feeling guilty about contributing to pollution.&nbsp; No having to work my schedule around opposite-side parking.&nbsp; lol.&nbsp; Etc.

				When I decide to live my life in a box with no interaction and no desire to explore this vast nation and it&#039;s many natural wonders that you miss when flying over it, I&#039;ll think about it. <br /><br /><br />You can have that life- But I can jump in the car, zip off someplace and be there to watch the sun come up, or watch it set from a spectacular vantage point without taking 5 trains, 2 buses, and 3 hours there and back to do it.

				I respect everyone&#039;s right to own a car if you want to. However, unless you have a really good reason to have one I can&#039;t believe anyone would want to expense of one. Car payments, insurance, maintenance, gas, tolls are all through the roof. And for what? Everything you could possibly want is available right here within a short walk/bus/train trip. Not having a car allows me to save $600-$700 a month. That&#039;s over $20 a day back in my pocket. Just my two cents.

				Anyone can and will do what they choose. I personally think its where you were brought up. If you grew up in the areas served by transit opportunities, then learning to drive wasn&#039;t a priority so many didn&#039;t and are fine with that. If, on the other hand, you grew up in a suburban area where you were lucky to SEE a bus, much less ride one- getting that license and car was a necessity to be &quot;free&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;
