				<br /><em>I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.<br /><br />&lt;&gt;<br /><br /><br />From every mountainside, let freedom ring.<br /><br />And when this happens, when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God&#039;s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:<br /><br />Free at last! Free at last!<br /><br />Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!</em><br /><br />***<br /><br /><br /><br />http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/01/i_have_a_dream_1.html<br /><br /><br />

				Martin Luther King, Jr. (January 15, 1929 â€“ April 4, 1968)<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.<br /><br /><br />http://www.historyplace.com/speeches/rfk.htm<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />But we have to make an effort in the United States, we have to make an effort to understand, to get beyond these rather difficult times. <br /><br />My favorite poet was Aeschylus. He once wrote: &quot;Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart, until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.&quot;<br /><br />What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness, but is love and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or whether they be black. <br /><br /><br /><br />So I ask you tonight to return home, to say a prayer for the family of Martin Luther King, yeah that&#039;s true, but more importantly to say a prayer for our own country, which all of us love - a prayer for understanding and that compassion of which I spoke. We can do well in this country. We will have difficult times. We&#039;ve had difficult times in the past. And we will have difficult times in the future. It is not the end of violence; it is not the end of lawlessness; and it&#039;s not the end of disorder. <br /><br />But the vast majority of white people and the vast majority of black people in this country want to live together, want to improve the quality of our life, and want justice for all human beings that abide in our land. <br /><br /><br /><br />Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago: to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world. <br /><br />[\quote]<br /><br /><br />http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkivebeentothemountaintop.htm<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><br />Strangely enough, I would turn to the Almighty, and say, &quot;If you allow me to live just a few years in the second half of the 20th century, I will be happy.&quot;<br /><br />Now that&#039;s a strange statement to make, because the world is all messed up. The nation is sick. Trouble is in the land; confusion all around. That&#039;s a strange statement. But I know, somehow, that only when it is dark enough can you see the stars. And I see God working in this period of the twentieth century in a way that men, in some strange way, are responding. <br /><br />Something is happening in our world. The masses of people are rising up. And wherever they are assembled today, whether they are in Johannesburg, South Africa; Nairobi, Kenya; Accra, Ghana; New York City; Atlanta, Georgia; Jackson, Mississippi; or Memphis, Tennessee -- the cry is always the same: &quot;We want to be free.&quot;<br /><br />And another reason that I&#039;m happy to live in this period is that we have been forced to a point where we are going to have to grapple with the problems that men have been trying to grapple with through history, but the demands didn&#039;t force them to do it. Survival demands that we grapple with them. Men, for years now, have been talking about war and peace. But now, no longer can they just talk about it. It is no longer a choice between violence and nonviolence in this world; it&#039;s nonviolence or nonexistence. That is where we are today.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Thanks, TRX.<br />Now for a little righteous anger.<br />I will never, Never, NEVER hand my money to TD Bank.<br />Even back in the days when it was Commerce Bank, they continued to keep their branches open on MLK Day.<br />Now that they&#039;re controlled by Canadian/British money, you&#039;d think they&#039;d be a little more PR savy.<br />What do they think they are, the state of Arizona?<br />They can take their little green free pens and cram it (and them).<br />

				People all over this country expended political capital to create MLK Jr. Day.&#160; TD Bank, being <strong><em>open</em></strong> not when it does or does not annoy me, but when done for reasons of profit over reasons of institutiional and societal memory are the issue here.&#160; GenY people are the most vapid individuals around;&#160; if it didn&#039;t happen in the last 20 years in never took place at all.&#160;
