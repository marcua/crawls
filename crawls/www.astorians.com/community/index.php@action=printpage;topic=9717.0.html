				I was in the C-Town on 28th Avenue this past Sunday, shopping for party treats, and I was thunderstruck at how much it resembles Bravo on 34th Avenue!&nbsp; I&#039;ve never seen any two supermarkets that were so nearly identical--if you&#039;re in one you might think for a moment you&#039;re in the other.<br /><br />Same layout, except for the seafood section which I never found.&nbsp; A two-aisled produce section to the left as you go in.&nbsp; On the right side, an island for frozen pizza and another for cheese and bread, between the freezer on the left side and the dairy case on the right side.&nbsp; In the right front corner, a bakery and deli section with a black-and-white striped awning and big barrels of nuts and similar things.&nbsp; Across the aisle from that to the left, coffee beans.&nbsp; In front of the aisles, displays of European exotica.&nbsp; Seldom-seen Goya beans.&nbsp; And NO frozen blintzes or latkes.

				I think that the same parent company actually operates both chains, which would explain the resemblance.

				Funny you should mention that. I was at Neptune Diner this evening and saw a truck with C-town and Bravo placards on it. I do have to say I think Bravo is the cleaner of the two, but that may be just because it&#039;s newer.

				I don&#039;t remember the last time I was in a C-Town.&nbsp; I love the Bravo on 34th ave.&nbsp; But yes, Bravo and C-Town are in fact related companies.

				For no reason I&#039;ll ask if anyone&#039;s ever been to a Publix, the major chain in Florida.<br /><br />All of their stores are exactly the same.&nbsp; You can walk into one in Tampa or Fort Lauderdale and know where to go to get your Cheetos.<br /><br />We now return you to your regularly scheduled discourse.

				Publix is wonderful, I wish we had them up here.&nbsp; I&#039;ve defected from C-Town to Bravo, finally, and it&#039;s getting better organized, though the aisles are still too narrow and they really need to stock more chicken broth.

				It&#039;s amusing when my friends who visit the area remark at how the supermarkets we have such as C-Town and Associated are usually in poor areas.&nbsp; One of them even said she nicknamed C-Town &quot;G-Town&quot; as in &quot;Ghetto-Town.&quot;<br />Personally, I like all of the supermarkets around our area.&nbsp; There are so many just blocks from my apt.&nbsp; Another advantage of living in Queens vs. Manhattan!&nbsp; I think that C-Town and Bravo have the best prices of them all.

				That C-Town and Bravo seem to be owned by the same parent company is beside the point.&nbsp; A Google search brought me to this site, for a company that designs supermarkets:<br /><br />http://www.dydesign.com/ (http://www.dydesign.com/)<br /><br />As you can see, they also designed a Trade Fair in Astoria, which I take it is the one on Ditmars Blvd., since it is neither of the ones south of GCP.<br /><br />Besides, the C-Town on Broadway is very different from the C-Town on 28th Ave.<br /><br />I wonder, though, whether the C-Town on 28th Ave. and the Bravo on 34th Ave. have the same manager?&nbsp; Not only is the layout amazingly similar, but so is the choice of merchandise.&nbsp; Yes to European exotica, no to frozen blintzes--and what&#039;s a supermarket without frozen blintzes?<br /><br />McDirk, the C-Town on 28th Avenue has plenty of canned and boxed chicken broth.&nbsp; Swanson&#039;s, College Inn, Butterball, Krasdale, Emeril&#039;s, and perhaps another brand or two.<br /><br />

				Honestly, the fact that you didn&#039;t find the seafood section is probably a good thing.

				For purely local places, the best by far is Best Yet on 20th Ave &amp; 37th STreet.&nbsp; The only caveat is that you need a car to get there.&nbsp; However, it is a true supermarket.&nbsp; Clean and well stocked, with a very good staff.<br /><br />Other than that, I like the Super Stop and Shop on Northern Blvd.&nbsp; The prices are better, by far, than any local places, but the produce section, while huge, can be touch and go.&nbsp; Great fruit, mediocre at best fresh herbs.&nbsp; I usually hit our local veggie stand (at the Ditmars Blvd N/W) instead.&nbsp; Using their frequent buyers card, and double coupons, we make out like a bandit some weeks.

				I miss my California supermarkets: Safeway, Nob Hill, Albertsons. These places never smelt rancid and they even had a decent wine section. Often bottles of wine were strategically located all over the store to tempt shoppers, including at the register for impulse buyers. And the service was excellent too. Never saw cheerful cashiers and baggers until I moved there.
