				I thought some of the educators and generally thoughtful activists on this board would find this press release of interest and note. For more information on past titles that have won the Newbery Award, and the ALA, you can visit this site (http://www.ala.org/ala/alsc/awardsscholarships/literaryawds/newberymedal/newberyhonors/newberymedal.htm). The RHCB First Amendment First Aid (http://www.randomhouse.com/teens/firstamendment/alert.html) site also has additional links to resources that citizens and teachers can use to help them fight censorship in their own community.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Those of us in the publishing industry are keenly aware of the power of words. Carefully chosen, words can instill peace or bring about revolution, and in the case of literature, the right combination of words can elevate the mundane to the sublime.<br /><br />In the past few weeks, a certain word in this year&#039;s Newbery Award-winning novel, Susan Patron&#039;s <em>The Higher Power of Lucky</em>, has created a maelstrom of controversy among librarians, booksellers, authors, editors, publishers, students, parents, and general readers alike. The offending word? <strong>Scrotum</strong> (in this case, a dog&#039;s, male of course). And in the ensuing debate on Internet listservs and blogs, newspaper op-ed pages, and interoffice chatter, certain other, more disturbing words have crept to the forefront of the discussion-specifically, challenge, banning, and censorship.<br /><br />The story gained prominence when the <em>New York Times</em> published a front-page report on the escalating brouhaha (&quot;With One Word, Children&#039;s Book Sets Off Uproar (http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/18/books/18newb.html?ei=5070&amp;en=4560dcda34446bf4&amp;ex=1172898000&amp;pagewanted=print),&quot; Feb. 18, 2007). Since then, the story has received increased attention, with national and international media coverage.<br /><br />Reactions to the <em>New York Times</em> article have been passionate and intense. Some criticized the report for not consulting librarians who support the book and its author. Others objected to the article&#039;s insinuation that the word scrotum was chosen for its shock value (<em>&quot;Authors of children&#039;s books sometimes sneak in a single word or paragraph, leaving librarians to choose whether to ban an entire book over one offending phrase&quot;</em>). The article fails to mention that scrotum, which occurs on the very first page of the novel, is the proper, nonvulgar word for an anatomical body part. <br /><br />In an op-ed letter to the <em>Times</em>, children&#039;s book author Alex Flinn vehemently asserts: <br /><br /><em>&quot;If a particular word finds its way into a book, it is because, after much consideration, we have decided that the word is absolutely necessary to the story. Most children&#039;s authors feel a strong sense of responsibility to their readers, their characters and their stories. We do not sneak.&quot;</em><br /><br />While many librarians have come out in support of <em>The Higher Power of Lucky</em>, others have declared their intention not to include it in their library collections, thereby making the title unavailable to their community of readers; in other words, they haven chosen to ban the book from their libraries.<br /><br />In another op-ed letter to the <em>Times</em>, an elementary school librarian from Louisville, Kentucky, states: <br /><br /><em>&quot;Given the conservative nature of the families of my patrons, why would I seek to offend them by offering their children books that are not age-appropriate?&quot; That same librarian also informs us that she has not stocked the past three Newbery Medal winners &quot;because they are not appropriate for the patrons of my library.&quot;</em><br /><br />What this brings up is the more subtle but insidiously dangerous issue of self-censorship. Indeed, why would any public librarian jeopardize their job or funding for their library, which largely depend on the support and largesse of the community, by courting such controversy? Similarly, why would a bookseller risk offending customers by recommending a potentially controversial title? Taking this viewpoint to its natural conclusion, why then would a publisher take any chances by signing such a book? Why would a writer choose to produce anything that someone might find objectionable? Why write anything original? Why risk it? They have no incentive to do so and every reason to play it safe. However, the inevitable result would be a literature-and a culture-of blandness and mediocrity.<br /><br />The American Library Association has issued a statement in support of Susan Patron and <em>The Higher Power of Lucky</em>: <br /><br /><em>&quot;The author&#039;s use of one word should not prevent children from having free access to this remarkable piece of children&#039;s literature. Children and their families should be given the opportunity to read this book and develop their opinions.&quot;</em><br /><br />&quot;It is wrong to judge a book by its cover-or by a single word that most people don&#039;t even consider offensive,&quot; Chris Finan, president of the American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression (ABFFE), said. &quot;<em>The Higher Power of Lucky</em> should be judged as a whole, which is exactly what the American Library Association did when it gave the book its top award.&quot;<br /><br />Likewise, this year&#039;s Newbery Honor authors, Jennifer L. Holm, Kirby Larson, and Cynthia Lord, have also offered a written statement of their support. You can read their statement in full on RHCB&#039;s First Amendment First-Aid Kit Website (http://www.randomhouse.com/teens/firstamendment/alert.html).<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />The Random House First Amendment Committee<br /><br />[<em>The Higher Power of Lucky</em> is published by Atheneum/Richard Jackson Books,<br />an imprint of Simon &amp; Schuster. The audiobook edition is published by<br />Listening Library, an imprint of Random House Audio.]<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				how interesting - I wonder what the context was, it&#039;s an unusal word for most books.

				The dog was rather unfortunately bitten there by a snake ... it&#039;s a catalyst for the main character, Lucky, and her rather fanciful notions of the world.

				People should not be allowed to read written materials, watch videos or movies, or visit galleries/museums until they&#039;ve signed a contract whereby any attempt on their part to censor written materials, videos, movies, or galleries/museums will result in having their scrotums and/or nipples tickled by robotic devices nonstop for 24 hours, on the first offense, 72 hours on the second offense, and 2 straight weeks on the third offense. <br /><br />Of course, as the manufacturer of robotic tickling devices, you might well accuse me of having mixed up priorities. But I assure you, I take this stand on principle.&nbsp;

				In my 10th grade English class it wouldn&#039;t matter.&nbsp; #1- They aren&#039;t very good at reading.&nbsp; #2- They don&#039;t know the correct terms for body parts and would probably think a scrotum was a part of the ear.&nbsp;
