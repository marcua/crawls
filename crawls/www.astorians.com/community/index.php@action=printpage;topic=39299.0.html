				I was trying to wade through the teen edited rag QS when I came across the most ridiculous neighborhood reference that i have ever seen in print. Apparently, according to the Queens Gazette, the part of Astoria around the &quot;booming&quot; 23rd Ave. corridor is now being referred to as No-Stein. I guess that makes me a resident of So&#039; Ass (south of Astoria. Bl.) Give me a break. Stop trying to make Astoria something it will never be-Hip. Paint it however you want but Little DeMoines will never be Manhattan or Brooklyn.

				It&#039;s a millennial disease. I got read by some 28 year old at work for actually wanting to spell words out in company email. Imagine the anguish it causes a young person to fully type out &quot;Let Me Know&quot;... if you don&#039;t abbreviate it, you might lose precious time from tweeting your opinion about things you know nothing about! Yippeee!

				I think the real problem is these new millennials moving into the neighborhood that leave such a bad impression on everyone their age that others (like myself, who&#039;s a native) has to deal with them as well.<br /><br /><br />Like selling Ridgewood as &quot;East Williamsburg&quot; it won&#039;t work.&nbsp;

				Slightly off topic but I have noticed as transplants almost completely take over the 5 boroughs, I am hearing people refer to neighborhoods in weird ways. On multiple occasions I have heard said out-of-towners (residents) refer to the West Side or the East Side as Midtown West and Midtown East respectively. It sounded weird until I realized these folks are not from here and their only frame of reference is how these areas are assigned on Seamless and apartment listings. Kind of sad to see the entire city handed over to people who not only aren&#039;t from here but most will not stay. It is merely an &quot;experience&quot; for the monied suburbanites. Another piece of a great city dies.
