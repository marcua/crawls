				Hey, folks--<br /><br />Am new in town and grateful for this board, as there&#039;s lots of good info. :-) I&#039;m looking for a recommendation on which hair salon is good for medium-length hair... I don&#039;t need color/highlights, and nothing terribly fancy/trendy. I keep reading about Saloon and Giorgio&#039;s and SPAce, but it would be great if someone could recommend a stylist and a place that won&#039;t break the bank. <br /><br />Any takers? Thanks in advance!

				I have long hair and just got a cut, color AND a blowdry at Giorgio&#039;s for $80 so your wants should be much less than that. Try Adriana or Eileen.

				I wouldn&#039;t recommend Space. I just went there for my simple very short bob cut and once again I&#039;m not happy. It is all different lengths and there&#039;s a huge gash in the shape of the hair on the back of my head. My hair looks like a 4th grader cut it. (Not just my opinion, but everyone who has seen it.) I&#039;ve gotten my hair cut when travelling and they&#039;ve always done a great job taming it and shaping it. What is it with Astoria and NYC in general? It seems like stylists are trained only to deal with perfectly straight hair and anything else is a challenge for them. Let me take a deep breath and go put some gel in my hair.

If your hair is wavy or curly then it seems you, more than others, would need to find the right stylist.

				&nbsp;:-D I have to laugh because having lived here for decades (with a few breaks in between) I have yet to find a decent haircutter in Astoria. I too have wavy hair and I used to favor short hair with bangs because that&#039;s what seems right for my face. Forget about trying to get something stylish or cutting edge (excuse the pun) around here. One butchering after another, or it&#039;s hit or miss.&nbsp; Now my hair is a simple shoulder length style that I can maintain myself.<br />I hate SPAce-the three times I went were disasters. Just a simple short style would be too complicated for them. The only Astoria haircutter I can recommend is Immagine (2m&#039;s) on 28-06 23rd Ave. Frankie has a done a great job everytime, but even there I walk in with almost as much angst as I would going to the dentist.

				I&#039;m a recent fan of this place:<br /><br /><strong>Hair Shapers<br />33-12 Broadway<br />Astoria NY 11106<br />718-545-3846 / 718-777-3735 </strong><br />Tues-Weds 9:30-7:00 Thurs-Fri 9:30-8:00 Sat 9:00-7:00 Sun 9:00-3:00 (closed Mondays)<br /><br />Hair washed and cut, no blow dry - $25 bucks + tip, in and out the door in 25 minutes. <br />They hang your coat up for you. They bring you coffee. Maria and Billy are both really nice. <br />Both are content to just do their thing if you aren&#039;t the talky type, but can chat while they work if you want them to. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve got your basic shoulder length &quot;Johnny Ramone&quot; haircut.. not fussy or anything but I do like the bangs cut just so, and lately I&#039;m getting those little angle shapes framing my cheekbones. I never blow dry it, except in the dead of winter... They don&#039;t push for the blow dry anyway so you won&#039;t feel cheap if you say you don&#039;t want it. That&#039;s always been a selling point for me at salons. <br />&nbsp;<br />I noticed this topic yesterday, so I went by there and picked up their menu just to post it here:<br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>mens cut 20</li><li>womens cut 20 - up</li><li>blow dry/style (flat iron add $3) - 20-40</li><li>updos &amp; curls 60-80</li></ul><br />They carry L&#039;oreal and Paul Mitchell products (which I use), also Rusk(?) and Nioxin(?)<br />Also waxing, hair spa treatments perms, color, highlights, bridal hair and the whole 9 yards. ^_^<br /><br /><br />

				I need to stop depending on trips home to central Connecticut for my haircut, and plus lately I haven&#039;t even been thrilled with that either. I just want someone who cuts it in a way that 1) doesn&#039;t make me look like a mushroom, and 2) doesn&#039;t layer it so the front is shorter than the back, making me have a short pair of Hasidic Jew-esque curls in front of a bunch of longer hair. I think I&#039;ve only gotten two good hair cuts in my entire life. My next step will probably be to try one of the salon schools in the city. At least then I won&#039;t feel like I&#039;ve wasted a lot of money if I get a bad cut.

				Funny to hear neg reviews about Space! I moved to Sunnyside in Feb and still go to Astoria to have Nicky cut my hair. I have 4 friends that also go there for cuts. Either with Nicky or Adela. None of them have been unhappy. <br /><br />I&#039;d really recommend either one of them!

				I&#039;ve been going to Athena at Studio 31 (31st Ave and 33rd St.) for two years now and I love her.&nbsp; As of right now, I&nbsp; believe she keeps part-time hours, but they are very convenient for me.&nbsp; Thursday, Friday and Saturdays and she has appts well into the evening.&nbsp; <br /><br />For my medium-length hair that usually gets a slight layers, she charges me $25.&nbsp; The salon is a nice space, with good products and I really adore Athena.

				I&#039;ve been going to Gigi&#039;s off of 30th avenue for about a year and have been very happy. Vicky always cuts my hair. I think a shampoo, cut and style was $47 with the tax.
