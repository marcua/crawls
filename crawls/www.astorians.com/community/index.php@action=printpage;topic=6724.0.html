				I just moved to Astoria into a nice, one-bedroom apt in a house on 36th street just off of Broadway.&nbsp; The landlords, of Italian-Croatian descent seemed very nice at first.

				Why don&#039;t you just ignore the landlord?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />You could also tell him to a) mind his own business; b) that if he wants to initiate legal proceedings tell him pleato se feel free to do so.&nbsp; &nbsp;He&#039;ll have to spend the time and money to do that.&nbsp; &nbsp;From what I understand it is not the easiest thing to evict a tenant, even one who doesn&#039;t pay the rent.&nbsp; &nbsp;I suspect if you that he&#039;ll back down.&nbsp; &nbsp; You have rights and you spent time and money to move.&nbsp; &nbsp;The way I understand it landlords can&#039;t do anything to obstruct a tenant from entering his apartment.&nbsp; &nbsp;If he (or she) does so then from what I understand they can be arrested.

				from an experience i just had, i can tell you eviction is next to impossible.&nbsp; my old roommate stole my deposit money, and then didn&#039;t pay his rent for 7 months, and in order to get him out the landlord had to settle in court by giving him $2,300 and forgiving his debt.&nbsp; Eviction takes many many many months, and the landlord has very little power in the process.&nbsp; If he did initiate a lawsuit, he would be certain to lose and probably be required to pay you damages.

				I don&#039;t see any legal grounds for an eviction whatsoever. The landlord cannot dictate who comes and goes from your apartment if they are not causing any noise or safety issues. <br />I would ignore your landlord for now...... in a court of law, his case is weak and it would take <span class="bbc_u">many,many</span> months for him to see you evicted. And it would not surprise me if you get a few months of judge imposed, rent-free living out of the whole ordeal.

				I had a similar incident with my landlord a couple years ago.&nbsp; I was dating a girl who lived in Queens, so she&#039;d stay over once in a while.&nbsp; One morning when she was leaving he asked who she was, and she explained.&nbsp; He came over when I got home from work that night, under the impression that she was living there, which she was not.&nbsp; This whole thing could be a big misunderstanding, especially if English is your Italian / Croatian landlord&#039;s second language.&nbsp; <br />Instead of being a jerk, I&#039;d suggest taking it up with the landlord before you decide to tick off the guy who could make your life rather uncomfortable.&nbsp;

				Thank you all for your thoughts.&nbsp; It is in my nature to try to reason with the landlord first ( a la KidMurdock&#039;s reply), which I will do, but I want to be sure I am on solid legal footing.&nbsp; If I am and he still gives us a hard time, then we will take the &quot;ignore him&quot; approach that others suggested and see how he responds.&nbsp; He would be foolish to try to evict and I like the idea of getting a few months rent free in retribution for this Victorian nonsense!

				FYI: There is no such thing as a real solid legal footing, IMO. It&#039;s more of a who can afford the better attorney or have the better pro-bono on the side. Tenants are usually favoured in landlord-tenant disputes, but remember that most laws regarding housing only apply to certain size units (I think it&#039;s 4 or more apartments in one building).

				It is clear, but a good lawyer can do anything because he will find obscure law. The point is that there are qualifiers.<br /><br />The real estate dictionaries say it&#039;s 4 or more, but you&#039;d have to go through NY law to find the specifics. I am pretty sure someone on the board has mentioned it before. <br /><br />But none of the law on housing applies if you don&#039;t live in an apartment building and you&#039;re in a private home.<br /><br />PS: Don&#039;t count on me for real legal advice, I&#039;m just tryin&#039; to say that you should try to do the right thing and not the legal thing. Often, they aren&#039;t the same.

				Personally, I&#039;d talk to the guy and say that you plan on occasionally having people over, but that it won&#039;t be ridiculous, you won&#039;t make his house a hotel and that you think it&#039;s not fair to ask you to not invite guests to your house.<br /><br />Make sure he knows she&#039;s not living there and ask if there&#039;s anything you can do to make him feel more comfortable. <br /><br />If there&#039;s not, or if what he suggests is unreasonable, just try to listen to him and understand his point--no matter how much you disagree. Tell him you&#039;ll think about it.<br /><br />Continue to live as you like. If the problem comes up again, listen to him again. I tend to think that most people really just feel like no one listens when they complain.<br /><br />If I were you, I would think that the right thing to do, what I would hope I was cool and respectful enough to do, would be to hear him out, tell him I&#039;d think on what he said and then I&#039;d do that. Hopefully the next time you&#039;d be able to talk to him on better circumstances where he felt like you respected him.<br /><br />All that being said, if it still became an issue, I would tell him to back to the &quot;Hey, man, if we can&#039;t get along, you take me to court, cause this is within my rights.&quot; But give the guy a chance (and, I&#039;d say, more than one) before being too pushy with him. You don&#039;t want to make it a bad relationship if you don&#039;t have to.<br /><br />But I&#039;m&nbsp; :lol:&nbsp; so you may not want to listen to me.<br /><br />PS: I think that smiley looks like a crazy guy.

				Thanks for the advice, paratactical.&nbsp; I will try the &quot;respectful&quot; approach, but I&#039;m not holding my breath.&nbsp; I just learned last night from the other tenant in the building that the landlords are basically psychos and have driven the four previous tenants away. Anyway, I thought I bonded with the landlord given that I speak Italian and, therefore, can speak with him in his native tongue. So I&#039;ll try to build on that and finesse the situation.<br /><br />And the smiley face -- totally looks like a crazy guy (let&#039;s hope I don&#039;t end up signing all my posts using that one!&nbsp; :mrgreen:)

				When I went to visit Savannah Georgia when I was 17, I was visiting my then boyfriend at SCAD. I was recommended to Claudia&#039;s House, a b+b in the city. It was gorgeous and old-timey so when my boyfriend wanted to stay over one night, Claudia stopped him on the stairs and said no way. I said, Oh we&#039;re engaged.

				aNYCdj, thanks for your, um, &quot;colorful&quot; thoughts.&nbsp; It&#039;s a one year lease which I have read scrupulously.&nbsp; But it really does not matter what it says:&nbsp; by law, one is allowed to have one non-family guest live with one regardless what the landlord or the lease says, though there would be costly legal fees should one challenge the lease as a previous poster noted.&nbsp; Having someone sleepover is no question at all. <br /><br />As an addendum to this saga, a long-time friend of mine and his family visited me from Germany the past two days.&nbsp; I gave the landlord a heads up a couple days before their visit and there was no problem at all, except that he and his wife were very visible and clearly checking us out.&nbsp; Very strange.&nbsp; So, the fact that it&#039;s okay for a family of four to stay with me, but not my gf makes this curioser and curioser.&nbsp; Anyway, will have a convo with them this weekend. . . wish me luck!

				Your landlord has no right WHATSOEVER to ask you or your g/f if she is/isn&#039;t living with you. As long as you pay your rent on&nbsp; time. It&#039;s the law!
