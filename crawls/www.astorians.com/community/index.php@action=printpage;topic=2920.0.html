				Maybe we can tie this with the Iron Chef competition we&#39;ve been posting about?<br />Let&#39;s make it a real Astorians competition and sell tickets....

				I don&#39;t see where it says he&#39;s not re-opening, Jennifer. It looks to me like he&#39;s just delayed because of equipment failures and trouble hiring repair people... <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">EL SAYED: We’re trying very hard to open this week, we’re trying very hard...</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				i just freaked xahc out at the thought of losing Ali! i called him and have him going over there later today to talk to him if he&#39;s there and take some pics to let us know what its looking like. i will almost definitley keel over and die if he doesn&#39;t re-open. by far my favorite restaurant in the area and how can you not love that man?!?!?!? i will do anything in my power to help. even if he doesn&#39;t close-he most certainly will need our help and support, so lets put our brains together and get this man his place back!

				Word. I nominate Ali&#39;s place for the next EATS event (if he&#39;s open and willing!). Just for the hell of it.

				Well, we are talking about going to Mombar next week - I&#39;m really thinking out loud here, but would there be any way to tie something in?

				There are a number of businesses that haven&#39;t reopened.&nbsp; Three on 31St alone - Planet Wings, Cold Stone, and Emack&#39;s.&nbsp; This blackout caused so much damage.&nbsp; I&#39;ll support anything we can do to keep Ali in business, even if I never ate there.&nbsp; I want my Emack&#39;s back too&nbsp; :cry:

				We definitely should be looking for ways to send more business to him, help improve his bottom line.&nbsp; Losing good restaurants is never a good thing and his seems especially beloved.&nbsp; Maybe get some posts about him and his restaurant on Chowhound and some of the better trafficked food blogs?&nbsp; Try to help him get in the local papers?&nbsp; Bringing Astoria Eats there sounds like a good idea as well.

				i think his max capacity is something like 20. i would love to do an EATS there, but we&#39;d have to shut him down for a few hours for just us. the thing is- we need to help him get his gear all in working order at this point. Does anyone have any connections with fridges and kitchen supplies that he could use? handyman? i don&#39;t know i&#39;m just thinking out loud like lanseaux!

				Maybe Astoria EATS should declare a state of emergency and eat out as often as possible at affected restaurants, and encourage others to do so as well?
