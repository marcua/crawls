				After reading the reports on this all I&#039;m left with was the feeling that none of this is surprising and that how surprised I was by my own lackluster feelings of anger. We must be getting used to these new tactics.<br /><br />Anyone else feeling beaten down by the stories of spying, corruption and lying by our own government these days?

				I didn&#039;t see it at this march, but at one in 2005 the piglets were blatantly videotaping all of the anti-war protesters.<br /><br />And here is how our civil liberties go gently into that good night.&nbsp; We&#039;ll wake up tomorrow morning with jackboots on our feet, or necks.&nbsp;

				I was an active member of Astorians for Peace and Justice and if they spent time and money investigating our activities (peace marches, creating doves for the marches, community events etc.) they sure wasted their time.&nbsp; I must be getting immune; it is truly pathetic and laughable.<br /><br />One of the more memorable protests during the RNC was when we stood outside of FOX and shouted &#039;Bill O&#039;Reilly shut up&#039;.&nbsp; Wow!!!&nbsp; That was some terrorist event all right!
