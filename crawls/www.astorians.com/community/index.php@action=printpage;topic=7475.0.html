				Fellow Astorians,<br /><br />I just found a hidden wonder on Bdwy.&nbsp; I needed about 9 yards of really high quality cloth and I went into the &quot;Silk Store&quot; on bway and 35th street&nbsp; thinking &quot;hey they might have something, although I doubt it&quot;&nbsp; and found a great fabric for about half of what I was expecting to pay in Manhattan.<br /><br />I know I sound like a commercial but this is an amazing crafts person&#039;s resource.&nbsp; The owner says that Sesame Street buys all their fabrics there.<br /><br />

				Neat-o Bambito!!&nbsp; :mrgreen: When I was younger, my momma used to make me clothes. One time, I had a school Christmas show. When I told my friend that my mom made it, she said she found the same kind of skirt for fifty dollars!&nbsp; :-o

				I don&#039;t make clothes, but use a lot of fabric in set designs.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t know this one, check them out as well...there&#039;s a great well-stocked fabric store with great prices at 30th Ave. at 33rd. For crafting, they also have an amazing $.99 rack. We just did my sets &amp; costumes for VAMPIRE LESBIANS OF SODOM with fabrics from there and saved a bundle. Very pleasant people to deal with as well.
