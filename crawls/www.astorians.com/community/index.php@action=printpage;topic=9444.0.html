				Hi Alex -- <br /><br />Unfortunately, it&#039;s not easy to come to the US to legally live and work. As you thought, you&#039;ll need a visa but they are not easy to get.<br /><br />There are two basic routes, family-sponsored and work-sponsored. <br /><br />If you have a close blood relative who&#039;s a U.S. citizen then he or she may be able to sponsor you.<br /><br />There are several categories of work visas, the most easiest to obtain is the H1-B visa that would allow you to work in the US for up to 6 years. You&#039;ll have to find a company willing to sponsor you and they apply for the visa in your name.&nbsp; <br /><br />This type of visa cannot be used for low-skilled employment or restaurant work ( I don&#039;t know of any that will) and you&#039;ll need a university-level degree prove that you have good English language skills<br /><br />If you come on a student visa you&#039;ll need to be enrolled in an approved school and prove you have sufficient funds to support yourself during the length of your studies. <br /><br />Since 9/11 immigration rules have been tightened and it&#039;s even harder to obtain a visa than it was previously.<br /><br />Have you looked at the US embassy website in Greece? Here&#039;s the link that explains the rules in more detail<br /><br />http://athens.usembassy.gov/ (http://athens.usembassy.gov/)<br /><br />Good luck!

				Hi Alex,<br /><br />Visa - 28Grand is right, there is no easy visa option. I first came here on an extended 6 month tourist visa, which you apply for in your home country and then extended it for another 6 months when you are here. You cannot legally work on this visa and you have to justify why you need the extra time and show that you have enough funds. Then I married a New Yorker, which is probably the most straight forward way to get a visa, but that means finding the right girl, which is hard especially in NYC.<br /><br />Sublet - If you arrive in August a lot of people are on vacation and it should be easy to find a room to sublet through craigslist. The problem with renting is that landlords want to know you are working, some also want to check your credit score.<br /><br />Jobs - Not sure about barman or restaurant jobs without a work visa. Check craigslist to see what is available and salaries.<br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />
