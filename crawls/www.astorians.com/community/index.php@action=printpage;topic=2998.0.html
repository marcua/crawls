				It is 5.00 in the morning. people are standing out in front of my buidling yelling. Lots of loud talking and the occasional WHOOOOOOOO! I called 911, which routed me to 311, which said they would send the police over. I wish I had thought to mention the likelihood of public drunkenness.<br /><br />I wasn&#39;t going to get enough sleep tonight anyway, and now I will get even less. F@#$@()$*%^*&amp; @(#$*@!$@!!!!!!

				I feel for you, but there is a good probability that the police aren&#39;t going to respond. They might be too busy, and they have to reprioritize frequently.<br /><br />I hadn&#39;t planned on doing this here, but here goes.<br /><br />Yesterday morning, at around 2:45 I had reason to call 911. Not only did they respond within 4 minutes, they responded in force. 6–8 cars, vans, marked and unmarked. (Oh! How I wish I were *much* younger!) 12–14 of the most beautiful young men I have ever seen. It took them less than 10 minutes to find, errr, umm, this scumbag who broke into my house, and arrest him.<br /><br />And my new hero? A small, underweight, pure white Bichon, named Frankie, who left enough identifying marks for this piece of crap to be easily identified.<br /><br />I&#39;ve got a history of not being able to sleep well. Now I may never.&nbsp; :cry:<br /><br />I hope you were able to get back to sleep. Please don&#39;t be too hard on the one-one-four. They really do their job.

				Oh my Gosh, I&#39;m so sorry you had to go through that!&nbsp; No wonder all the houses on my street have high tech alarm systems, and all sorts of other security measures.&nbsp; I wonder how much robbery is a problem in Astoria.&nbsp; I&#39;m so glad you are okay and that Frankie came to your rescue.<br /><br />As for the drunks, I would just call the local precinct directly.&nbsp;

				Wow, that&#39;s terrible! I&#39;m glad you got a quick and speedy response. <br /><br />I was not too pissed over the police - I know that squashing crime is more important than me getting a night&#39;s sleep - but Jesus I was pissed at those nuts on the street. I&#39;m tempted to buy a supersquirter.<br /><br />the noise stopped not long after my call. Not sure whether they just gave it up and went home or the police did in fact show up.

				Noisy parties are a everyday part of life on our block - music to 5 AM, or even 3 day wedding festivals are not disturbed. July 4, the street gets blocked with &quot;displays.&quot; <br /><br />The police never bother (I guess they think its a youth or a cultural thing so hands off!!)<br /><br />The Astoria Park motorcycles are a standing part of our community&#39;s lore for years -- and no one in authority obviously seems inclined to do the slightest thing about them.<br /><br />Even things like murders often never get reported (remember how we found out about the Rapture incident - when they canceled the liquor license?) <br /><br />So, next time there is a problem, why don&#39;t you do the following:<br /><br />1. Contact Peter&#39;s/Eric&#39;s/Micheal&#39;s offices and note their reaction.<br />2. Write a letter to all the weekly papers about your experience (and their responsiveness).<br />3. Post is on this site and encourage others to do the same (maybe a daughter board, merm?).<br />4. Mention it to the next precinct council meeting (good topic for SAFE?)<br /><br />Bad news is just not reported in the paper (got to provide space for all those tiresome Republican (bad dog!) and Democratic (good dog!) rants that passes for news). <br /><br />Its about time the good guys make some noise, too!! Maybe this community can start to change things.<br /><br />

				NYCMacUser--That must had been very unsettling I&#39;m sure. Kudos to the pup. I&#39;m glad the police responded so quickly and that they nabbed the f-er.

				Whoa, what was&nbsp; the Rapture incident?&nbsp; <br />You mean that place on 28th ave. and, I think 35th St.&nbsp; I like that place, or at least I did...
