				THE VILLAGE CHOICE<br />A Weekly (um, quarterly) Rundown of News, Views and Events Affecting <br />Freedom in NYC<br />Volume 5, Issue 2 * April 7, 2006<br /><br />THE VILLAGE CHOICE is brought to you by the Manhattan Libertarian Party.<br />http://www.manhattanlp.org<br /><br />In this issue:<br />* Weld seeks the Libertarian nod!<br />* Serf City, here we come!<br />* The Wild Woman of Albany strikes again!<br />* Your calendar of pro-freedom events!<br />* Much more!<br /><br />==============<br /><br />* News Bites *<br /><br />A Libertarian Governor?<br />GOP gubernatorial hopeful Bill Weld is sailing into uncharted waters in <br />New York Republican politics: He&#39;s making a major run to line up the <br />backing of the tiny Libertarian Party. Weld confirmed to the Daily News <br />last night that he would &quot;definitely be interested&quot; in winning the <br />Libertarian line. &quot;&#39;Libertarian&#39; is not a bad word in my lexicon,&quot; he <br />said, noting one of his favorite expressions is: &quot;I want the government <br />out of your pocketbook and out of your bedroom.&quot;<br />http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/406850p-344319c.html<br /><br />Yes, I Know It&#39;s a Jan and Dean Song<br />At the height of the political races last summer, the libertarian <br />candidates weren&#39;t getting much press in the daily newspapers in New <br />York. So Jim Lesczynski and the Manhattan Libertarian Party created <br />their own publication, Serf City. The title is a pun on a Beach Boys <br />song, but also symbolizes the state of affairs in New York City, Mr. <br />Lesczynski said.<br />http://tinyurl.com/kvon2<br /><br />But Guns Aren&#39;t Sharp Objects<br />A Fresh Meadows Marine who just embarked on his second Iraq tour posted <br />a note on his MySpace Web page as a caution to anybody else who may find <br />themselves in his situation - headed into the war on terror: no small <br />weapons allowed. &quot;So I am getting ready to board the plane to Kuwait <br />City and I am loaded for bear,&quot; he wrote. &quot;We all have our weapons on us <br />with other assortment of gear and we are told that we cannot carry <br />knives onto the plane with us... Plane full of Marines, all carrying <br />weapons and I can&#39;t carry my four-inch pocket knife on board. The <br />perfect start to a long deployment.&quot;<br />http://www.queenstribune.com/qconf/MakingItInQueens.html<br /><br />Our Wild and Crazy Public Servants<br />The woman who accused state Sen. Ada Smith of scalding her with hot <br />coffee said her out-of-control boss threatened to kill her if she told <br />anyone about the incident, an explosive new court document shows. In a <br />deposition filed in Albany City Court yesterday, Jennifer Jackson said <br />she was working at her job as an aide on the morning of March 21 when <br />Smith came into the office carrying a cup of coffee and bragging she had <br />lost 4.3 pounds. According to the deposition, when Jackson said she <br />thought Smith would have lost 20 pounds given her busy schedule, the <br />fiery senator - without warning - threw coffee into her aide&#39;s face <br />while screaming, &quot;You need to keep your f- - - ing mouth shut!&quot; With her <br />eyes burning from the coffee, Jackson said she told eyewitness Claude <br />Nelson, Smith&#39;s chief of staff, &quot;I can&#39;t take this anymore. I&#39;m <br />quitting.&quot; Before leaving, Jackson, 41, said she told Smith (D-Queens), <br />&quot;Senator, you can&#39;t do this to people. It&#39;s abusive.&quot; An enraged Smith - <br />known as &quot;the wild woman of Albany&quot; for her unpredictable behavior - <br />allegedly responded by yanking off Jackson&#39;s hairpiece and throwing it <br />on the floor while yelling an expletive. Soon after, Smith is said to <br />have warned, &quot;If you tell anyone what happened in this office, I will f- <br />- - ing kill you.&quot; <br />http://www.nypost.com/news/regionalnews/62045.htm<br /><br />====================<br /><br />* Rant of the Week *<br /><br />Speak Now or Forever Hold Your Peace<br /><br />by Jim Lesczynski<br /><br />Perhaps you noticed this is the first issue of THE VILLAGE CHOICE to <br />show up in your inbox in three months. Perhaps you didn&#39;t notice, or <br />didn&#39;t care. I&#39;ve received a few emails since January asking what <br />happened to our weekly publication, but for the most part people seem to <br />be getting along well enough without it. For those who do care, as I&#39;ve <br />mentioned in past issues, I simply don&#39;t have time in my schedule <br />anymore to put this out on a weekly basis. Anyone interested in assuming <br />the reins of THE VILLAGE CHOICE should drop me an email, but until that <br />happens, assume that this publication will appear infrequently at best.<br /><br />But that&#39;s not what I want to write about today. I want to discuss the <br />top item in the news clips above. As has been rumored in Libertarian <br />circles for some time now, former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld, the <br />leading candidate for the Republican nomination for New York governor, <br />is seeking cross-endorsement by the Libertarian Party.<br /><br />This is big stuff. Weld would be by far the most serious, experienced <br />candidate the Libertarian Party of New York has ever endorsed. Even if <br />Weld didn&#39;t win, it&#39;s almost a lock that he could pull 50,000 votes on <br />the Libertarian line, something no other Libertarian candidate for <br />governor has managed in our 32-year history. If we hit the magical 50k, <br />it means that the Libertarian Party is an officially recognized big-time <br />party with permanent ballot status for the next four years. No more <br />sweating it out on the streets in the dead of summer, expending massive <br />amounts of time and energy collecting signatures just to get our <br />candidates on the ballot. Instead of 3,500 signatures to run a candidate <br />for Congress, it would be more like 1 or 2 signatures, depending on <br />party enrollment levels. Even in areas where we didn&#39;t run a candidate, <br />the Libertarian Party would still own a column on every ballot.<br /><br />Sounds great, doesn&#39;t it? Ah, but there&#39;s a catch. There&#39;s always a <br />catch. See, Weld isn&#39;t a purist Libertarian. He isn&#39;t even a moderate <br />Libertarian. Weld is more, shall we say, libertarian-leaning. A fellow <br />traveler of the freedom movement, if you will. While he peppers his <br />interviews with wonderful sound bites like, &quot;I want to get the <br />government out your pocketbook and out of your bedroom,&quot; when the rubber <br />hits the road, Weld often comes up short. He&#39;s for medical marijuana, <br />but opposes drug re-legalization. He&#39;s opposed to eminent domain abuse, <br />but supports Bruce Ratner&#39;s Atlantic Yards scheme. He&#39;s a card-carrying <br />member of the NRA, but signed a massive gun control law while governor <br />of Massachusetts. (His defense is that it wasn&#39;t as bad as the gun <br />control Pataki signed in New York.) And so on.<br /><br />So now we face a serious dilemma in the Party of Principle. Do we set <br />our principles aside, &quot;just this once,&quot; and go with a kinda-sorta <br />Libertarian in order to get major party status and be on easy street for <br />the next four years? Or do we go with Plan B, which is to once again <br />nominate an earnest but invisible hardcore Libertarian and be content <br />with the same result we have always gotten?<br /><br />Weld wouldn&#39;t be the first controversial candidate we&#39;ve ever nominated <br />- controversial within the party, that is. Party in-fighting usually <br />happens whenever we consider a candidate outside the rank and file of <br />the LP. We have a strong preference for inbreeding; the Libertarian <br />Party is like the Romanovs of New York politics in that respect. In some <br />cases, particularly during the Howard Stern episode, I thought the <br />criticism of outsider candidates was entirely justified. In other cases, <br />as with the great Audrey Silk, leader of C.L.A.S.H. and our recent <br />candidate for mayor, I thought the intramural potshots were entirely <br />unfounded.<br /><br />Regardless of my feelings on any particular candidate, one thing I <br />believe firmly is that there is a right time and place for internal <br />criticism and debate. That time is BEFORE we give them the nomination. <br />Unfortunately, all too often it seems some of us don&#39;t begin the serious <br />debate over a candidate&#39;s qualifications until after the horse has left <br />the barn. Or, maybe there are a few socially dysfunctional spoilsports <br />in the party who just care nothing for the good of the party or the <br />advancement of liberty, and who are content to get their jollies by <br />tearing down our candidates throughout the course of the campaign <br />season.<br /><br />I&#39;m about as purist of a Libertarian as you can find, and I can find <br />plenty to nitpick about any campaign, but I guarantee that you will <br />never find me publicly knocking a Libertarian candidate between <br />nomination and election day. And publicly includes on those infamous <br />wastes of time, the Yahoo Groups.<br /><br />If you want to criticize a candidate for being insufficiently <br />libertarian, please do so. Personally, I think now is the time for our <br />candidates to be more libertarian, not less. But let&#39;s hear it now, <br />before the nomination. Or if a promising candidate disappoints during <br />the course of the campaign, save it for after election day, when we can <br />do a post mortem and hopefully learn from our mistakes. Trashing a <br />candidates while he or she is our nominee does the campaign no good, it <br />does the party no good, and it does the cause of freedom no good.<br /><br />And spare me the childish whining about free speech and &quot;constructive <br />criticism.&quot; A private email to the candidate is constructive. If the <br />candidate rejects your advice, there is absolutely nothing constructive <br />about taking your gripe public. It just pisses off the candidate and <br />demoralizes the troops. Yes, you have a right to free speech. You have <br />an absolute right to speech that damages the Libertarian cause. But <br />let&#39;s not have any delusions about what it is you&#39;re really doing.<br /><br />If you find you just can&#39;t stomach a nominated candidate, then by all <br />means don&#39;t support him or her. Go find something else to do for <br />freedom, and sit out this election. There are plenty of ways you can <br />advance the cause without involvement in electoral politics.<br /><br />Weld isn&#39;t the only quasi-libertarian seeking our nomination this year. <br />There is also Steve Greenfield, a Green Party activist from New Paltz <br />who is seeking our Senate nomination. As far as I can tell, he&#39;s even <br />less of a libertarian than Weld. In all likelihood, I will vote for Jeff <br />Russell, a long-time true-blue Libertarian, for Senate at our statewide <br />nominating convention in Albany. Still, if Greenfield somehow gets the <br />nod, I will either find a way to support his campaign, or I will simply <br />find something else to do for freedom over the next seven months. The <br />same goes for Weld.<br /><br />Fellow Libertarians, come to the convention in Albany on April 29. Make <br />your voices heard. Starting April 30, I don&#39;t want to hear them.<br /><br />===================<br /><br />* Upcoming Events *<br /><br />Monday, April 10, 6:30 p.m.<br />Manhattan Libertarian Party monthly meeting<br />Guest speaker: John Chodes, author of _Destroying the Republic_<br />Food and drink service available<br />Ukrainian East Village Restaurant, 140 Second Avenue<br />http://www.manhattanlp.org<br /><br />Monday, April 10, 10:30 p.m.<br />&quot;The Libertarian Alternative&quot;<br />A Libertarian political talk show<br />Time Warner Cable Ch. 34, RCN Cable Ch. 110, MNN Ch. 1<br />http://www.libertarianalternative.org<br /><br />Wednesday, April 12, 8:30 p.m.<br />&quot;Hardfire&quot;<br />A Libertarian political talk show focusing on NYC<br />Time Warner Cable Ch. 56<br />http://hardfire.net<br /><br />Monday, April 17, 8:00 p.m. - midnight<br />Manhattan Libertarian Party tax day protest<br />Help us cut off the lifeblood of Leviathan.<br />James Farley Post Office steps, Eighth Avenue at 34th Street<br />http://www.manhattanlp.org/events.htm<br /><br />================================<br /><br />* News tips, rants and events wanted! *<br /><br />Help us improve THE VILLAGE CHOICE.
