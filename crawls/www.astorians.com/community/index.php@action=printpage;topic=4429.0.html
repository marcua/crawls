				What are you doing to celebrate??<br /><br />I kind of wish Hanukkah was only one day - b/c then it would be like...<br /><span style="font-size: 15pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font"><br />IT&#39;S CHANUKAH</span></span><br />and people would sit up and take note and DO something about it.&nbsp; Maybe a dreidlecon.&nbsp; But with 8 days to get in the festivities and the family stuff....&nbsp; it becomes... oh... is tonight the first night??<br /><br />Someone mentioned it to me at work today - i&#39;d forgotten.&nbsp; Jonathan said he heard about it on a t.v. commercial.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

				I forgot too...yet again I forgot to buy a big plastic electric menorah.<br /><br />I guess it&#39;s probably not cool to buy one after the first night, huh?&nbsp; Wait &#39;til next year is the thing?<br /><br />

				A very Happy Chanukah to those celebrating today!<br /><br />I wish I knew some better holiday greeting. Dont&#39; people say &quot;good fast&quot; or somethign like that? Maybe I&#39;m thinking of another Jewish holiday.<br /><br />For those of us like me who are fairly ignorant of the holiday, here&#39;s some info.<br /><br />http://judaism.about.com/od/chanukah/a/abouthanukkah.htm<br /><br />I really like this passage: &quot;Not by might, not by power, but by My spirit.&quot; Well put.

				Happy Hannukah to everyone!&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#39;s Lyla&#39;s first Hannukah, so we lit the candles (actually I have a hanukiah with little flasks of oil that we light) as a family the first night, then had a Hannukah party on Saturday (using the 15 pounds of potatoes I molded into latkes that I made and mentioned in another thread) and lit the hanukiah with the few friends who were here at that point.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now it&#39;s mostly down less exciting.&nbsp; We lit the oil tonight and will do so every night until Thursday when we go to Wisconsin for Christmas with Erin&#39;s family and we&#39;ll have our &quot;travel menorah&quot; with regular old candles for when we&#39;re out there.

				I&#39;m searching all the old threads for Latke locations.&nbsp; 11PM on a Sunday, I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t be a problem.&nbsp; <br /><br />I need to find myself a menorah too.&nbsp; Maybe a giant 6 foot inflatable one in a snow globe to throw on the front yard.&nbsp; Might be slightly harder to find than the latkes.&nbsp;

				About 10 years ago when I asked my grandmother for a latke recipe, she insisted--absolutely insisted--that I should make them from the powdered Manischevitz variety that comes in a box.&nbsp; Now, this was my grandmom who made everything homemade from scratch, and she insisted that the powedered kind is just as good and that the from-scratch kind is not worth the effort.&nbsp; Now, I&#39;m not saying I agree, but just saying that the powdered kind ARE pretty good, and they might satisfy your craving.<br /><br />PJ Bernstein&#39;s in midtown/sort-of lower upper east side makes a pretty decent latke, if overpriced.

				I thought I would get this in while there&#39;s still time (one candle left!) - Happy Chaka-khan-ukah!&nbsp; <br /><br />I ate about thrity latkes on the first night, so I&#39;ve sworn off them till next year.<br /><br />Also, my Bet Hillel/Bet Shammai menorah broke, so I was kind of bummed (my wife fixed it, but it&#39;s just not the same if you don&#39;t have it for the first night).&nbsp; To explain: in the Talmud, the students of Shammai and the students of Hillel disagree about how to light the menorah; the former argue that 8 candles should be lit on the first night, seven on the second night, and so on, while the latter argue that we should light 1 on the first night, 2 on the second, etc. (which is our current practice).&nbsp; I made a menorah with two sets of candle holders so that I could light candles according to both methods (but I put the candle holders too close to each other, so the relatively intense heat given off by the collective conflagration melts the puny hanukah candels in about three minutes).&nbsp; But at any rate, it broke.<br />

				So, I&#39;ve been away for Christmas with the in-laws, but before I left there was a holiday party at my work.&nbsp; They did it in-house this year to save some money and it was actually a pretty nice affair overall (though oddly only ran from 4-7).&nbsp; The funny part was that they had what was clearly meant to be a Hannukah room with blue fabric on the ceiling and table, gelt on the table, yummy latkes, jelly doughnuts and.... a big, huge bowl of shrimp on ice.<br /><br />Oy!
