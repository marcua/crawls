				Hi all,<br /><br />I was just wondering if anyone has a veterinarian that they really like...I just adopted two kittens and need to find a vet for them.&nbsp; I am new to Astoria and don&#039;t know the area that well yet.&nbsp; Any referrals of great vets, or perhaps more importantly, warnings of clinics to stay away from?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been sort of looking at All Pets on Ditmars Blvd, Astoria Veterinary Group, and 21st Avenue Animal Clinic....I&#039;d just like to hear from folks who&#039;ve actually been to some of these places to get a sense of things...<br /><br />Thanks!

				I used to go to All Pets and I really liked them but their hours can be a little erratic.&nbsp; I had problems picking up my cats&#039; food and medicine because they would be closed at odd hours (like 2pm).&nbsp; I switched to Astoria Veterinary Group and I really like them.&nbsp; Very professional and caring.&nbsp; But if you have a fairly flexible schedule or only need to appointments a few times a year, All Pets is great and affordable.&nbsp; <br /><br />Whatever you do, stay away from Astoria Animal Hospital on Steinway between 25th and 28th Ave!!!&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard quite a few scary stories from people about being ripped off or pushed into unnecessary surgeries, etc.

				Yes, I have heard about Astoria Animal Hospital.&nbsp; That&#039;s so crazy!&nbsp; How does that guy stay in business?&nbsp; Price gouging is bad enough, but unnecessary surgery??&nbsp; That&#039;s really horrible.<br /><br />The hours at All Pets are indeed bizarre.&nbsp; 3 to 6?&nbsp; Wtf?&nbsp; Pretty much the only time I could ever go would be Saturday mornings.&nbsp; So we&#039;ll see.&nbsp; I have heard other good things about Astoria Veterinary Group, so if All Pets doesn&#039;t work out for me for some reason, I think that will be my next choice.<br /><br />This board is very helpful.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad I found it!&nbsp; Thanks for the help...

				If you make a Saturday appointment at All Pets, try to get one as early as possible.&nbsp; They start getting way behind their schedule pretty quickly.&nbsp; I once got the 10am appt. on a Saturday morning and the vet didn&#039;t even show up until 10:15m, and then I had to wait until everything was set up.&nbsp; I think it was 10:45 before I got into the room.

				All Pets closes for appointments mid-day to do surgery.&nbsp; I actually never had trouble with their hours.&nbsp; I work in the city and they were very accommodating and often waited for me to get there even if it was a bit after their official hours.&nbsp; Our cat was hyperthyroid and needed regular medication that they would have compounded by a specialty pharmacy so I was there about once a month picking up his meds.&nbsp; I willl agree about the sometimes long wait time, but to help avoid a long wait, I would call before going to see if they were off schedule.&nbsp; Your best bet is the first appointment of the day - good luck!

				I just switched vets. I was with Astoria Veterinary Group on Steinway for a few years, but<br />wasn&#039;t pleased with the care my dog was getting. I just took him over to the Animal Clinic<br />of Long Island City (corner of 36th Avenue &amp; 32nd Street).<br /><br />They have 3 vets there and we saw Dr. Alvarez. Very nice and also very frank about what&#039;s <br />wrong and what needs to be done. It&#039;s a nice, clean pleasant office and they even have cats<br />who are up for adoption. <br /><br />I was impressed because my dog&#039;s had a recurring abcess that&#039;s been getting worse and worse.<br />My previous vet had him on many rounds of meds that didn&#039;t work and I wanted another opinion.<br /><br />I not only got one that made much more sense, but the office even called to check on my dog<br />a couple of days later and told me to not to hesitate to bring him in anytime I&#039;m worried. <br /><br />Their fees were reasonable too. <br /><br />Good luck.

				Astoria Vet Group on Steinway had my cat who is old with kidney problems on so much medicine that it was getting ridiculous. And nothing improved...she was getting thinner and weaker. After they wanted me to try two more medications, I decided to stop going there. I was surprised because I had heard good things about them. But maybe the good reviews were from people who don&#039;t have major health problems with their animals? I&#039;m not sure. I started taking her to a different vet and they put her on one medicine plus vitamins and she&#039;s gained weight and doing wonderful. I&#039;m really glad I switched.

				Good for you - glad your cat&#039;s doing better. With my dog, they kept putting him on meds<br />to &quot;shrink&quot; this abcess, which is now the size of a grapefruit. The new vet told me that nothing<br />like that would work and also diagnosed him with lymphatic cancer. He&#039;s ok for now and is too old<br />to go through any surgery or chemo, which they were also very honest about. <br /><br />I think that&#039;s a sign that something is wrong when there&#039;s a problem and they just keep prescribing<br />more and more pills. At least now everything makes sense and I feel that my dog will get better care<br />for the time he has left. <br /><br />

				Well, I had a 10:15 appointment and got in to an exam room around 11.&nbsp; So I did have to wait a while, but it wasn&#039;t too bad.&nbsp; It went fast.<br /><br />I thought the vet was nice, and she seemed quite knowledgeable.&nbsp; She took some time before she saw us to read through all the paperwork the shelter had given me and was very good about explaining what my kittens have (upper respiratory infection and tapeworms - very common in shelter animals) and why the shelter de-worming and shots didn&#039;t help (they were only treated for roundworms and the shots were not comprehensive enough or administered after they had already caught the virus).&nbsp; <br /><br />She de-wormed them for flatworms and gave us anti-biotics and an immune system booster for the infection.&nbsp; They should be fine.<br /><br />I had heard a number of comments about her staff being rude, but I had no problems with them.&nbsp; Perhaps we got onto their good side when we said that we were thinking of renaming the kittens &quot;Sneezy&quot; and &quot;Snotty&quot;, due to their colds...the vet assistant really seemed to be tickled by that...<br /><br />We&#039;re scheduled for a follow-up visit in 10 days to see how they are progressing.<br /><br />Overall, I&#039;d say it was a good experience, and decently priced as well.<br /><br />

				I had brought my cat to Animal Clinic of LIC (32nd St and 36th Ave) a few years back. He was really sick, unable to walk. They took x-rays, diagnosed him with cancer, and suggested we see a specialist at the Animal Medical Center in Manhattan. Brought him there and they also misdiagnosed him, said he broken his leg. Meanwhile the poor cat was getting worse. Finally, we brought him back to the AMC where he was correctly diagnosed with Cushings and had to be euthanized -- poor little guy was suffering so much. Animal Clinic of LIC, while wrong with their diagnosis, knew that it was a case they couldn&#039;t handle and suggested we see a specialist -- and they did call to check up on him (albeit after he had died). I&#039;d rather a vet who knows their office&#039;s limitations, than one quick to make money off of desperate pet owners.<br /><br />Now we get our vet care in Brooklyn at Cobble Hill Animal Hospital (Dr. Walter Maddox). Awesome place and awesome vet (albeit a bit on the odd side).

				I live just down the street from Animal Clinic of LIC and have been wondering if it&#039;s decent. I have two young, healthy (slightly overweight) cats who need yearly check ups. <br /><br />Does anyone know offhand how much Animal Clinic of LIC charges for a yearly check up? Or how hard it is to get an appointment?<br /><br />I used to take them to the SPCA clinic near the 59th St bridge (Manhattan side), but got fed up with long waits, horrible receptionists, and having to pay in advance. I&#039;m sure this was all because as a cheap clinic they were overwhelmed with people (who often didn&#039;t pay), but ultimately not worth it. <br /><br />

				I&#039;ve used both Steinway Court Vets and Animal Clinic of LI.&nbsp; My, now deceased, boy was diabetic and an older cat.&nbsp; Steinway Court has a better range of services and is a lot more thorough, but are very expensive.&nbsp; Dr. Glasser was always a cold fish and the staff ranged from very friendly to terrible human beings.&nbsp; The office manager cut my cat off from his diabetic cat food when I wouldn&#039;t pay for more tests, which I found unconscionable.&nbsp; I found another source, but she is not a vet and I still do not think she should have made that call on her own.&nbsp; They always promised payment plans and would never agree to one.&nbsp; I always felt they cared much more for the money they made of me than for the health of my cat.<br />Animal Clinic of LI are very kind people, but really clueless.&nbsp; They have consistently missed problems with both of my cats and while good intentioned, they are not very thorough. <br />I&#039;ve been taking my girl to Sunnyside Animal Clinic at Queens Boulevard and Greenpoint and find them to be much better.&nbsp; They&#039;re are affordable like Animal Clinic of LI, but thorough like Steinway Court Vets, and Dr.Goldenberg is friendly, warm and smart.&nbsp; It&#039;s a bit of a hike, but I think they&#039;re a better deal than either of the others.

				My cat has been a patient at Steinway Court Vet for about 3 years now, and so far we&#039;ve had positive experiences there.&nbsp; Dr. Glasser is very nice and knowledgeable, and his staff is friendly.&nbsp; We&#039;ve never had to wait longer than 15 minutes or so to get in an exam room.&nbsp; However, $750 for a tooth removal surgery and teeth cleaning is a bit steep.&nbsp; Even when we go in for routine check-ups, the exam fee plus whatever blood test or vaccine my cat will need can run well over $200.&nbsp; While we like it there, it&#039;s simply hard to afford it.&nbsp; I would love to have an affordable vet, but someone who still knows what they are doing and will take the best care of my son with fur.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking of making an appointment at All Pets.&nbsp; My cat has recurring teeth infections that can only be permanently treated if removing the tooth altogether (a root canal or similar dental work is much more expensive, believe it or not).&nbsp; He currently has a back &quot;molar&quot; that is looking very red at the surrounding gums and I&#039;m pretty sure he&#039;ll need it treated.&nbsp; However, I need a vet who can perform the surgery without charging me more than my monthly share of rent. <br /><br />Has anyone ever had dental work done for their cat at All Pets?&nbsp; Will it run my bank account into the ground?&nbsp; Any advice would be greatly appreciated ASAP, as my little guy will probably be needing this treated within the next month or so before it gets progressively worse.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks in advance!

				Not sure how much All Pets runs on dental care, but I would think it&#039;s reasonable. Just talk to them beforehand. I remember last time we had a procedure done I took one look at the bill and asked if they had student or artist rates. They actually lowered the bill and gave me some sample meds they had (same meds just in a sample pack) and then suggested I contact a Canadian pharmacy to get a refill (since it would be cheaper w/ pet insurance).

				Yes, I think Dr. Savara covers Dr. Hatzi&#039;s days off.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard wonderful things about Dr. H and it&#039;s nice to know her &quot;sub&quot; is equally wonderful.&nbsp; <br /><br />There was a very old dog that needed to be unexpectedly put to sleep while we were waiting (the wait was therefore over an hour long) and the whole staff was completely supportive and kind to the dog&#039;s owners, reassuring that they were making the humane decision, etc.&nbsp; After the owners left, the staff apologized profusely for the lengthy wait time, but we didn&#039;t mind, all things considered.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I had an emergency with our cat last week and All Pets was able to see her with 15 minutes notice.&nbsp; Dr. H. took her time, went over all of our options and even called ahead to the animal hospital to let them know we were coming.&nbsp; Through every step of the way she and her staff have been responsive and open with communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;:mrgreen: :mrgreen:

				Does anyone who uses All Pets have pet insurance?&nbsp; <br /><br />One plus for Steinway Court Vets is how quickly they fax the information to my insurance company.&nbsp; I usually get compensated within a month of the appointment.

				Hi everyone,<br /><br />Does anyone know offhand if any of the Astoria clinics that have been favorably mentioned on this board are open late or are open 24 hrs?&nbsp; Also if any of them take small/exotic animals on an emergency basis? (I am an obsessive guinea pig owner :))&nbsp; I have a vet in Manhattan that I like for routine things, but I am new to Astoria and wanted to check and see if there might be a good emergency vet closeby.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Christy

				Dr. Haltzi at All Pets on Ditmars Blvd is the BEST.&nbsp; She literally saved our cat&#039;s life.&nbsp; He had a chronic condition with his pancreas that was getting worse and worse, but Dr. Haltzi put us on a medicine and diet routine and he&#039;s been back at full strength for several months now.&nbsp; We spent lots of time and money at other places trying to get him diagnosed and treated, but Dr. Haltzi did her magic.

				I swear up and down by Dr. Hatzidimitriou at All Pets off Ditmars Blvd!! I recently moved here from GA and my 5yr old cat has some health issues.&nbsp; In the 4yrs I went to my previous vet (whom we&#039;ve known for over 15yrs)--- it took Dr. Hatzi 3 months to figure out what was really wrong.&nbsp; Because of her, too, my cat is alive!! They are very reasonable with their prices and never overcharged for anything.&nbsp; They also understand my budget and work with me with food and medicine.&nbsp; Some folk have issues with the other employees but I find them quite friendly.&nbsp; The ladies even call themselves &quot;Auntie&quot; when I bring in my cat.&nbsp; I think people mistake how busy they get and don&#039;t always greet you with an over friendly welcome.&nbsp; They all do care.&nbsp; And yes, sometimes you wait awhile to get seen, but that&#039;s because Dr. Hatzi takes her time with your pet.&nbsp; She truly cares and works wonders.<br /><br />I can not recommend All Pets enough.&nbsp; Love them.

				Just went to All Pets yesterday - they&#039;ve moved down a couple blocks to 21-79 Steinway, cross street is still Ditmars.&nbsp; They were great, I got a next day appointment when I called, even though I didn&#039;t have any super-urgent issues (a long claw/nail pushing my cat&#039;s pawpad, but could have waited a couple days since it wasn&#039;t sharp &amp; cutting in).<br />Dr. Hatzidimitriou was great, they kept my nervous cat very calm.&nbsp; Never tried to up-sell me on tests, I ended up getting a more expensive test because there&#039;s a chance my cat has some thyroid issues, but when I wasn&#039;t sure I wanted the more expensive test they were not at all pressuring me or guilting me.<br />Their number is still 718-956-7387, and so far I highly recommend!<br />

				that&#039;s great to hear that Dr. Hatzi is still in practice - too bad there isn&#039;t a forwarding sign or something directing people on the door of the old location.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure the rent where she moved is much more reasonable than in the heart of the Ditmars strip.&nbsp;
