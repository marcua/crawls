				http://www.housingnyc.com/html/resources/dhcr/dhcr40.html<br /><br />Good ol&#39; Pataki.&nbsp; He managed to sneak this in under the radar back in 2003.&nbsp; To summarize, what this essentially means is...<br /><br />Chapter 82 of the laws of 2003 for New York State.<br /><br />If you sign a lease with a &quot;Preferential&quot; monthly rent (a rent lower than what the landlord can legally charge),&nbsp; when that lease expires, the landlord can raise your rent to the maximum legal rent on the renewal lease. <br /><br />So for example, if back in 2003, before the big boom started in Astoria, landlords were having a slightly more difficult time filling vacancies,&nbsp; they would give you a preferential rent.&nbsp; Let&#39;s say the legal amount they could have charged was $1100/ month.&nbsp; But they needed to get someone in, so they only charge $600/month.&nbsp; Late in 2003, Pataki sneeks in chapter 82.&nbsp; 2005 rolls around, Astoria is now super hip, people moving up here all the time.&nbsp; Apartments are now hard to find.&nbsp; Landlord decides they can get a lot more for that previously undesirable apartment.&nbsp; Lease renewal received.&nbsp; Boom, they want an additional $500/month.&nbsp; No legal protection for the tenants.<br /><br />I&#39;m fortunate, and my landlord is not killing me in this way.&nbsp; But if they wanted to, they could essentially price me out of my apartment, i.e, my home.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, questions...<br />How does this kind of thing slip into the law of the land?&nbsp; Why weren&#39;t people outraged by this?&nbsp; Is it a coincidence that this was passed by a republican majority NYS legislature, and signed by a republican governor?&nbsp; Yeah, maybe I&#39;m being a partisan hack, but hey, this just seems to be another big example of the lack of concern towards &quot;regular working folks&quot; like myself, and most, if not all of my friends while tilting the platform again in the favor of the rich.<br /><br />I&#39;m not saying landlords shouldn&#39;t&nbsp; have rights to make money on an apartment.&nbsp; But to be able to force mid to lower income people out of their homes so easily, even if those people lived there for a very long time,&nbsp; at the time of lease renewal seems highly unethical.<br /><br />Also in this law, all apartments above $2000/month have been deregulated.&nbsp; There is NO rent protection for any apartment above $2,000/month in New York.&nbsp; Makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside, huh?&nbsp; Way to look out for your fellow human!<br /><br />

				Some more lovely background on our main man Pataki...<br /><br />http://www.tenant.net/Tengroup/Metcounc/Nov96/holland.html<br /><br />Turns out his first housing commish was a slum lord!&nbsp; And &quot;spent some time as the Republican majority counsel to the State Senate Housing Committee.&quot;&nbsp; Any mystery who Pataki&#39;s loyalties lie with, or who he&#39;s looking out for?<br /><br />Makes me a little more than peeved.

				tell me about it. my landlord simultaneously used owner occupancy(from the previous landlord)and the $2000/mo luxury rental bullshit to &quot;deregulate&quot; our apartment. joke&#39;s on him. from what i have dug up, despite the fact 3 of us split $2200 +/mo in rent we are still regulated as to be deregulated the tennants must be making $100,000/yr for 3 consecutive yrs. hhhhmmm, i&#39;m an underpaid admin, living with a travel agent who became an actress/waitress and another actress not legal to work in this country(she, however just moved out and our new roomie in marketing moves in this week). that barely comes up to half of that. and i don&#39;t think he knows this, or any other detail as there are certain problems we have had with the apartment, that he claims he is not responsible for. but i would think a class d(i think) health violation is his problem. he is the most clueless person on the planet. bought the place to make a quick buck and it&#39;s not that easy. <br />but b/c of owner occupancy instead of charging a decent rent for the apartment(in a building he doesn&#39;t maintain-vacuum the halls anyone? no, not ahmet keys to the basement where the power breakers or whatever they are called are? no, not ahmet)he got to charge &quot;fair market value&quot; and bounced it all the way up to the luxury rental price. it&#39;s ridiculous. he is the shadiest person on the planet. and 8 unit building has 40 housing violations against it. my bf&#39;s bldg in sunnyside has more apartments on one floor, of a 6 story two winged bldg and they have 6 violations! <br />so shady mcshaderson over here gets to use these ass backwards republican agenda &quot;policies&quot; to screw people out of a decent rent.<br />oh did i mention he also trumped up false charges against long time rent stabilized tennants to try to evict them and get more money for the apartment?<br />the more i talk about him, the angrier i get.<br />maybe we should start a support group for people with poopie landlords and we can all vent about the douchebags(my bldg has now taken to calling him that)that we rent from.<br />i can&#39;t wait to have money and be able to own my own home...but by the time that happens i will be priced out of astoria, which i have loved since i went to the prep.<br />J

				I have to admit, I&#39;ve actually had pretty good luck with landlords myself.&nbsp; When I first moved to Astoria, my landlord was a really nice guy.&nbsp; Gave me a great price on a 2 room studio.&nbsp; Usually pretty quick to fix stuff when I asked.&nbsp; The only problem I ever had consistantly was inconsistant hot water in the mornings.&nbsp; They never really took care of that.&nbsp; But I was there for a little over 3 years.&nbsp; My new place has been great.&nbsp; I nice big one bedroom.&nbsp; And the management company that ownes the building seems more interested in keeping good tenants that pay their rent on time than they do by jacking up the price and trying to get top dollar.&nbsp; So although I&#39;m up for a renewal lease in April, I am pretty confident that my landlord will want to keep me around.<br /><br />It is mostly the massive landlord loby that has been going to Albany and probably bribing the politicians there to deregulate.&nbsp; I&#39;ve done a lot of research in the last couple of days and have spoken to the DHCR (dept. of housing and community renewal), as well as a tenant advocacy lawyer, as well as the Astoria housing folks.&nbsp; They all have said the same thing... Pataki and his slimy friends in the NYS legislature have been hell bent on deregulating rents in NY, and have been hugely succesful in doing so.<br />I even called Pataki&#39;s office and gave them a piece of my mind.&nbsp; Asked them why he tapped a slum lord for his first housing commish.&nbsp; They said he wasn&#39;t a slum lord, so I asked them about why he stepped down, and recited many of his offenses.&nbsp; The person on the phone relented and ended up more or less agreeing with me.&nbsp; And this slum lord housing commish was a republican power broker as well!&nbsp; <br /><br />If these examples don&#39;t demonstrate the need to vote, and get others to vote, I don&#39;t know what will.&nbsp; Changing the faces up in Albany is the only way we&#39;re going to protect ourselves from deregulation of affordable rents.<br /><br />Or, if you don&#39;t agree, let&#39;s hear it for gentrification!!! YAY!!!!<br /><br />I can see it now...<br />The color of Manhattan and the immediate surrounding areas in the outer burrows becomes lighter and lighter.<br />You go to Harlem and the predominant female name you hear is Buffy, or maybe Miffy, and the male name you here most often is Lance or Biff, or maby Codey.&nbsp; <br /><br />The transformation won&#39;t be complete until there is a Starbucks on every street corner!&nbsp; <br />Wal-Mart buys the Met museum and transforms it into a Wal-Mart Super Store!!!<br /><br />A Ronald Reagan wet dream!!!!&nbsp;

				I have to say, the one good thing about not living in a rent stabilized apartment and having to haggle with the landlord every year about how much he was going to raise the rent, is that it inspired me to do whatever it took to be able to buy my own place and not have to deal with&nbsp; that again. <br />Granted, I was lucky that I could find a way to do that, and that I did it four years ago....

				Just trying to do my part.&nbsp; And Pataki is at it again...<br />From the New York Times regarding Pataki&#39;s newely released budget...<br /><br />&quot;But the fine print shows that 24 percent of his personal income tax cuts, credits and rebates would go to New Yorkers who earn $200,000 or more, while more than half would go to the roughly 10 percent of New Yorkers who earn more than $100,000.&quot;<br /><br />and also...<br /><br />&quot;One was the elimination of the state&#39;s portion of the estate tax, now levied on estates worth more than $1 million. The other was the governor&#39;s proposal to cancel a planned year-round sales-tax break for clothing purchases of less than $110, a form of tax relief felt most by the poor.&quot;<br /><br />Good thing he&#39;s helping out the &quot;working&quot; families so much.&nbsp; And to think those greedy home health care workers want health benefits of their own!&nbsp; &nbsp;The nerve of them trying to deprive the rich of their excess wealth!!!
