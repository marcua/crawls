				If anyone knows any place that has positions for typists, data entry clerks or receptionists please let me know! I consistently type over 80 wpm with 97 percent accuracy and my alpha/numeric data entry skills are at 10,000 KPH with the same (97 percent) accuracy. I have excellent phone skills, superb people skills, enjoy fast-paced environment and can multi-task like nobody&#39;s business. I am extremely reliable and punctual, never get sick and really like to work! Work can be part-time, temporary - anything! Thanks in advance, Cathy<br /><br />&nbsp;:cry: :cry:<br /><br />Two weeks + 100 resumes and I&#39;ve heard from only two places!!<br /><br />The ads on Craigslist for McCann&#39;s Bar and Martha&#39;s Bakery are starting to look better and better. Both are less than 100 yards from my house so I wouldn&#39;t have a long commute anyway!

				Cathy, have you tried any temp agencies?&nbsp; If you&#39;re looking for office work, it might be a great way to get your foot in the door.&nbsp; Good luck!!!

				I have tried a couple of temp agencies recommended by Astorians and have not heard anything from them. I know that not knowing Excel is killing me. I bought a Dummies book and I&#39;m trying to learn, but I am so obsessed with looking for jobs and emailing my resume that I can&#39;t concentrate. Maybe the chips, salsa and guac tonight will rejuvenate me!<br /><br />And what really kills me are the ads where every other word is misspelled or not used properly, past tense when should be present, etc., and then the poster has the nerve to write, usually in all caps, MUST HAVE FIRM COMMAND OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE or SPELLING TEST GIVEN. LMAO, makes me want to call some of them up and point out their glaring mistakes!<br /><br />Thanks mcw!<br /><br />

				If you know how to use word, you can probably pass the excel tests that temp agencies have.&nbsp; Just say you know Excel, and you will probably be able to figure out enough to pass their test.&nbsp; If you don&#39;t pass the excel test, some places will let you study, and test again.&nbsp; Don&#39;t let not knowing excel get in your way.&nbsp;

				I once took a course in legal proofreading - I too was having problems finding work when I first moved here. &nbsp;The woman who teaches this course also teaches the same course at NYU. &nbsp;If you&#39;re interested, you can take a look at http://www.learnproofreading.com/index.html.<br /><br />Basically, it&#39;s a two day course that prepares you for the tests given by proofreading agencies. &nbsp;After the course is finished, you go on interviews at proofreading agencies and take their tests. &nbsp;If you sign up with 3-5 agencies, it&#39;s likely that you&#39;ll be able to find steady work. &nbsp;Now, proofreading didn&#39;t really pan out for me because I wasn&#39;t willing to work 2nd or 3rd shift (which have the most jobs available), but I did score pretty well on the tests after taking the course and I could have started working right away. &nbsp;Having a certificate from this course counts for a lot, and the instructor also does a resume review.<br /><br />So if typos and bad grammar get on your nerves, maybe this would be a good option for you!

				I currently get Idealist.org&#39;s automated e-mail every day that lists communications-related non-profit jobs (not looking for a job myself, but since husband is have kept myself on this list). A lot of them are assistant-type, but I am sure that they also have many receptionist positions available. If you don&#39;t mind working in the non-profit sector you should check out the listings on www.idealist.org. That&#39;s actually how I found my current job.

				Idealist always has great listings - check out citylimits.org as well, and flipdog (I have to find the URL).&nbsp; The foundation institute has a jobs listing as well, though I don&#39;t know how it is accessed.

				Finally I&#39;ll be a contributing member of society again, I&#39;m so happy.&nbsp; :-) I have a temp receptionist job for a whole week beginning tomorrow! Thanks for all the great tips from everyone. I have more irons in the fire and may have another temp job after this one ends. Yippee!!
