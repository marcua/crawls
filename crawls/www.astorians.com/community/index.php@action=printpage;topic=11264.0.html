				Hello Ian! I&#039;m a fellow musician/music lover. I currently play bass in a local band called The Nervous Breakdowns. I also compose and perform music on solo piano which can be heard at myspace.com/michaelvallarelli<br /><br />Currently, I&#039;m into a lot of Wolf Parade, Fleet Foxes, French Kicks, The Walkmen, Ben Allison among many many others.

				Hey Michael!<br /><br />Good to meet a fellow bassist! <br /><br />I really dug your solo piano on the myspace page..<br /><br />Keith Jarrett really is a genius, I&#039;ve just now started really checking his solo concerts out.. (La Scala, Kohln, etc..), but I have always been really into his trio work.. which is also pretty fascinating.. have you heard My Foolish Heart yet? This record really blew me away.. <br /><br />I am only familar with the Ben Allison and The Walkmen, I will have to check out Wolf Parade and Fleet Foxes.<br /><br />I&#039;ve listening to a lot of Mahler (especially his Kindertoenlieder as sung by Janet Baker), Bill Evans, Daft Punk, Sonny Rollins, Radiohead.. <br /><br />I&#039;ll add you on myspace, where my music is.<br /><br />Your band playing around any time soon?<br /><br />

				Hey,<br /><br />Glad you enjoy! I haven&#039;t heard My Foolish Heart, but I love Keith&#039;s solo work, especially the Vienna Concert and La Scala(first solo piano I&#039;ve ever heard). <br /><br />The new Walkmen record is fantastic. Very focused and melodic without being melodramatic like so many indie bands. I also love The National. You familiar with their work?<br /><br />We played last night at R Bar. It went quite well. I&#039;d love to hear your music! I really also want to learn upright bass at some point. <br /><br />I&#039;m off to go and see The Fleet Foxes now. They&#039;re playing a midnight show in Park Slope. I&#039;m excited :)<br /><br />Have a good night,<br /><br />michael

				At different times in my life I&#039;ve played - with varying degrees of success - piano, guitar, accordian, flute, organ and cowbell. At this point I only have a guitar and it has been gathering dust for a while now. <br /><br />I&#039;m a very decent singer and am really, really good at backup. That may sound goofy, but I am pretty good at locking in a third or a sixth from the lead singer and making some good harmony. <br /><br />I like singing lead, too :) <br /><br />I miss music - if someone is putting together a group please count me in. I could probably pull of just about anything except for rap or techno.

				I&#039;m mainly a guitar player but I play drums and bass (alternating with another drummer, bass player) in an alternative fusion trio.&nbsp; The other guy plays guitar and sometimes sings. We only started jamming about 3 months ago.&nbsp; We&#039;re still trying to see if we can write enough original stuff to play some gigs.&nbsp; As a guitar player I mostly grew up with the heavier stuff from Jimmy Page to Randy Rhoads to Ritchie Blackmore,&nbsp; Steve Vai and John Petrucci, but lately I&#039;m trying to find better more bluesy tones and am searching for a simple all tube setup.&nbsp; Currently looking at a Fender Deluxe Reverb with an EH English Muffn pedal.&nbsp; I like Vader drum sticks (I don&#039;t currently own a kit) , and I have an Ibanez 5-string bass.&nbsp; I think I&#039;m probably influenced by Tony Levin on bass and John Bonham on drums but who knows? I listen to too much stuff to narrow it down.&nbsp; Sorry, I&#039;m totally nerding out.&nbsp; Let&#039;s have a talent show.

				Waking up this sleepy thread to chime in.<br /><br />I just moved here not too long ago. I had lived on the border between Bed-Stuy and Bushwick for four years prior. Before that I lived in the Upper West Side. I moved here originally to take the sound/light/recording tech position at Birdland jazz club. I eventually left to continue my aspirations as a musician and photographer. Most of my gigs are on electric and double bass but much of my time at home is spent playing or teaching the classical guitar. I play plenty of classical repertoire but I also love música Brasileira and flamenco.<br /><br />I started out on trumpet in third grade though I have no chops to speak of anymore. I played drumset, mallet, symphonic and marching percussion for many years throughout middle school, high school and college. I took private classical guitar lessons in middle school and double bass lessons in high school. Eventually I had to choose between drums and bass as a focus in college and I chose bass but I did end up getting my major in theory/composition and minors in double bass and percussion. I also sing and play some saxophone.<br /><br />My main groups right now are the French funk/rock/jazz group Amie Amis and the exploratory jazz outfit 5 Point Perspective. Amie was a long-time Astoria resident. Ironically, just as she moved near my old area I moved to hers! I&#039;m becoming less active with her but I still do lots of gigs with 5 Point and lots of subbing and sit-ins with several other groups. I have been working on writing and arranging music for my own group for several years now. I hope to have it done by the end of 2010. I plan to play all the instruments on some of the tracks. Most of my time these days is spent with a camera in my hand or, as mentioned before, a classical guitar in my lap. I hope to see some of you guys around!
