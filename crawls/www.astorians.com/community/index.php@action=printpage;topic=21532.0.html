				There have been multiple discussions about who has the best pizza in the hood.<br />Here&#039;s one for the worst pizza in the hood.<br /><br />(inspired by the recent Boston Pizza discussion)<br /><br />I had some really sh!tty pizza at the place where John&#039;s Pizzeria used to be, on Crescent and Astoria Blvd.<br />It&#039;s called Tasty Fast Food. Dumb name. Bad pizza.<br /><br />And another sh!tty pizza shout out goes to Papa John&#039;s, as if that wasn&#039;t already common knowledge.<br /><br />If it&#039;s not made by Italians, there&#039;s a good chance it&#039;s gonna suck.<br /><br />

				Funny, the moment I saw &quot;worst pizza&quot; I was about to post John&#039;s. It was the closest pizza to our apt when we lived in town. And yet, we still would never eat there, except for ices. Even after they renovated, didn&#039;t fool us.<br />&nbsp;<br />No idea how they stay in business. Maybe with that corner of the world starting to offer more options, they&#039;ll have to get better.

				I take it Papa John&#039;s and Dominos don&#039;t count? <br />&nbsp;<br />It&#039;s really a matter of taste, I guess. My wife loves Dino&#039;s and Rizzo&#039;s, hates Grand Ave. I love Grand Ave. and hate Rizzo&#039;s (loved the old Rizzo&#039;s, but it&#039;s changed a lot over the years).

				The worst pizza I ever ate in Astoria was from Ani Pizza at 43-18 25th Ave.&nbsp; Someone in our bldg said it was good so we gave it a try.&nbsp; Also ordered some hot food items to go with.&nbsp; It seemed like Italian food you&#039;d get in Nebraska.&nbsp; It was disgusting and the entire delivery hit the trash.&nbsp; It was really that bad.&nbsp; On the flip side, I&#039;m an Alba&#039;s fan (Ditmars).

				Grand and Boston are inedible. Dino&#039;s used to be gross but I tried it recently and it was fine - nothing amazing, but solid. Sac&#039;s has gotten too expensive.

				Grand was pretty good I thought; a reliable fallback, as was Star (like when I was shopping and suddenly got hungry in that area).<br />&nbsp;<br />Rizzo&#039;s also seemed pretty good, perhaps better than Grand. Really nice people there too!<br />&nbsp;<br />Tony&#039;s (?) under the subway on 31st near Ditmars was also bad, but that might&#039;ve had more to do with the ambiance.<br />&nbsp;<br />Place on Ditmars up past the produce stand is pretty good; unlike Pizza Palace, which I *used* to like but it&#039;s just too heavy/oily.

				Sac&#039;s is clearly the best pizza in Astoria.&nbsp; Yes, it&#039;s pricey, but you get what you pay for.<br />&nbsp;<br />Honorable mentions to Dino&#039;s and Star Pizza.<br />&nbsp;<br />A number of people have told me they like the pizzeria on 34th Avenue between Crescent and 28th St.&nbsp; I forgot the name of it.&nbsp; I tried it once and found it to be good but not outstanding.

				Finally checked out Sac&#039;s, after wanting to go there for years.&nbsp; Not impressed, though could be persuaded that our mediocre (at best) pizza was at least in part our own ordering mistake.&nbsp; We got a Grandma&#039;s Old Fashioned pizza and added garlic and fried eggplant.&nbsp; There just wasn&#039;t one part of it that was good - too much (flavorless) cheese, too little sauce, the fried eggplant pieces seemed &quot;re-purposed&quot;, and flavorless too, and the garlic was just some chopped up raw garlic seemingly tossed on (overloaded) at the last second.&nbsp; A doughy and boring crust too (though not burned as someone else suggested).<br />&nbsp;<br />Could there be a delicious pie that would have come out of that same kitchen?&nbsp; Did we miss that?
