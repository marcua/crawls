				Since fall is upon us, I can think of no better way to celebrate the occasion than with a convenient, fast, good, budget-conscious (read: cheap!) soup to warm up to after a day spent in the throngs of wind chill and the like. <br /><br />This recipe requires little if any effort and can usually be made within 10-15 minutes (including prep time) and is absolutely delicious! We have enjoyed this many of nights. It also doubles as a great sauce for steamed vegetables and brown rice.<br /><br />15 MINUTE BLACK BEAN SOUP &nbsp;<br /><br />2 (15 ounce) cans black beans, drained and rinsed (or fresh if you prefer) <br />1 1/2 cups vegetable broth <br />1 cup of your favorite chunky salsa <br />1 teaspoon ground cumin <br />Lemon to taste<br />Garnish of some sort if you like (cilantro/onion/soy sour cream/soy cheese)<br /><br />In a food processor or blender, combine beans, broth, salsa and cumin. Blend until fairly smooth. (Or pulse for a thicker consistency)<br /><br />Heat mixture through out, Ladle into bowls, immediately squeeze desired amount of lemon and garnish as you please. <br /><br />SEE YOU AT THE NEXT MEETING!<br /><br />BROWNBIRD

				Title: <strong>pumpkin muffins!!</strong><br />

				I hope everyone plans to do some halloween baking!!!<br /><br />:)<br /><br />+++++++++<br />Annwyn<br /><br /><br />Pumpkin Muffins <br />(as found on veggieconnection.com)<br /><br />Ingredients: <br /><br />1/4 non-hydrogenated vegan margarine <br />1 cup vegan brown sugar (or white sugar plus 1 tablespoon molasses) <br />1/2 cup applesauce <br />2 cups pureed pumpkin or squash <br />1 teaspoon cinnamon and nutmeg <br />2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour <br />2 teaspoon baking soda <br />Directions: <br /><br />Preheat oven to 350 and grease muffin tin. (This recipe makes 12 muffins.) Cream together margarine and vegan sugar. Add applesauce, pumpkin, and spice. Mix well and add flour and soda. Fill muffin tins and bake for about 20-25 minutes. The muffins don't rise much, so don't be shy about piling the batter in. <br /><br />These muffins are great warm, but keep for days. Most people don't believe me when I tell them these muffins are vegan, because they cook up so light and fluffy. Also, people are shocked to find they are made with 100% whole wheat flour.

				Title: <strong>Date Nut Torte</strong><br />

				Here is the recipe for the raw torte I brought for Vegestorians tonight. It is very easy and very quick. The dates probably should be soaked for about 3 - 6 hours first, though.<br /><br />This recipe is from Alissa Cohen's website (http://www.alissacohen.com).<br /><br />Date Nut Torte<br /><br />Fudgy, creamy and sweet!<br />I bring this with me when I’m visiting someone I’d like to introduce to raw food. People can’t believe it’s raw! And it’s one of the quickest and easiest desserts to make.<br /><br />Base of Tort:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * 2 cups raisins<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * 2 cups walnuts <br /><br />Frosting:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * 1 cup dates, pitted and soaked<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * 1/2 lemon, juiced <br /><br />For Base:<br />1. In a food processor, combine raisins and walnuts and blend until well blended and moist. (This will take a few minutes and you may see it forming a ball. Just make sure the raisins come out looking like a fudgey mixture and are not still grainy)<br />2. Remove from processor and mold onto a plate in a round circle about 1 1/2 inches thick.<br /><br />For Frosting:<br />1. In a food processor, combine dates and lemon juice until smooth and creamy.<br />2. Spread the frosting on top of the torte<br /><br />Note: I like this served at room temperature as the frosting and torte are still sticky, but if you want a firmer texture that will be easier to slice, refrigerate it for a few hours.
