				The first word is key - we are looking for a day care for my 7 month old that isn&#039;t close to 500 a week (like blue bird or a learning oddessy).&nbsp; Both of those places looked great but we just can&#039;t afford it.&nbsp; Any suggestions would be much appreciated.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				So funny, I just happened to be checking this site today after a few months.&nbsp; Yes, we found a day care that we love!!!&nbsp; Its Tons of Fun daycare on 36th street.&nbsp; It is about the price that I didn&#039;t want to pay, but worth every penny.&nbsp; Honestly after looking at nearly every day care in the area this was the one where we felt the most comfortable and I could not be happier with our choice.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />What I like - the owner, Sherry, is very reachable, she will be in touch with you all day if you need it.&nbsp; She knows the first few days are harder on the parents, and she will guide you through the transition.&nbsp; Her and the workers truly love the children as their own.&nbsp; My son comes home happy, tired from playing all day, clean, well fed.&nbsp; The day care center is clean and safe, the hours are flexible.<br /><br /><br />If anyone has any questions please PM me.&nbsp; I would be more than happy to tell you more about my experience but I don&#039;t want to post my personal email in a public forum.&nbsp; <br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font">[size=78%] [/size]</span>

				Just wanted to add one more thing, as someone who spent a lot of time look at daycares - before choosing a day care you should definitely check it out on the NYS OCFS services website, see if there are any recent violations, etc.&nbsp; I found some very surprising info about daycares in the area.<br /><br />
