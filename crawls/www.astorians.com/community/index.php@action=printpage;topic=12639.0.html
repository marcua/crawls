				I usually really enjoy this place, and have been eating there since they were in their original location.&nbsp; But recently I was there for dinner and ordered the following entree:<br />SHRIMP 18<br />Sauteed Argentinian shrimp, Maryland blue crabmeat, Isreali cous cous, smoked trout tarragon butter sauce<br /><br />Much to my astonishment, an entree portion for which they have the nerve to charge $18 included three little shrimp.... THREE!&nbsp; FOR AN ENTREE!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;:x

				That&#039;s something you could have easily asked about before ordering.<br /><br />I&#039;ve eaten there quite a bit and have enjoyed many of the entrees. If you wanted a big portion, order the steak next time. I had to take over half of it home!<br /><br />IMHO, they are the best new restaurant to (re)open in the area lately. Where else in Astoria can you get foie gras and (really) good sushi in the same place?

				We&#039;ve been to Bistro 33 twice now, and I&#039;ve definitely been pleased both times.&nbsp; The first time was for my girlfriend&#039;s birthday, and we fell in love with the lobster mac and cheese and the foie gras apps.&nbsp; Her steak was great, but my roast pork was only so so.&nbsp; <br />The second time we went, we were blown away by the crispy crawfish.&nbsp; As for the entrees I thought the burger was good, but the fries were far, far better, and her salmon was okay. <br />I definitely like the place, but for us it&#039;s a splurge, and will likely be reserved for birthdays or anniversaries.&nbsp;

				Had the steak there two nights ago.&nbsp; The fries were not perfect, but the steak was.&nbsp; I just love Hanger Steaks.&nbsp; It was very good and for $20 I have no complaints.<br />And I have never asked a waiter how many shrimp are in a dish.&nbsp; That would feel a bit odd.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Alibosu - I completely agree with you on that dish. My wife ordered it a few weeks ago and it was a sad looking entree....she had about 2-3 small sized shrimp on her plate. Regardless of the price the entree looked unfinished and like it was missing something. <br /><br />Love everything else...just stay away from this entree.<br /><br />Also, not sure I agree with Cyberias&#039; comment....a little strange to ask how many pieces of shrimp come on an entree before ordering..

				Interesting to hear that they have not corrected this problem.&nbsp; <br /><br />They give out those comment cards with the bill, and that night I certainly took the time to fill it out thoroughly and explain how dissatisfied we were.&nbsp; I left all of my contact information with the expectation that someone from management would get back to me.&nbsp; It never happened.

				I don&#039;t think Bistro 33 is all that. It&#039;s not bad food by any means, just not exceptional. (Except for the sushi, but I prefer other places for that anyway.) I feel like they&#039;re trying to be all Park Slope-style, which might explain the measly shrimp.

				&gt;I think it&#039;s a nice place and it&#039;s great for that area.&nbsp; So I&#039;m glad people enjoy it.&nbsp; And it seems to draw a big stroller pushing crowd.&nbsp; Also good.&nbsp; Baby friendly places are needed. <br /><br />But for us - not so good.&nbsp; There are way too many other choices in Astoria that suit us much better than this&lt;<br /><br />You know, that&#039;s a good point.

I love many of the new ones too, but it&#039;s gotta be something really special to steal my heart!)

				Being that I am part of that stroller group (even thought we don&#039;t own a stroller), our small family has enjoyed Bistro33 since moving to the hood.<br />Last week we were surprised by a new menu.&nbsp; Anmd the 2 for $10 is only on Tues. now.&nbsp; On wed. they have 2 for $10 on some wines, but they only fill the glass up half way, so I am not so sure that it is such a great deal.<br />On the new menu many of the old items we&#039;ve grown to like were still there.&nbsp; But they did seem to develop a salting issue.&nbsp; My soup was undersalted which ws easily correctable, but the bigger problem was that the hanger steak was WAY too salty.&nbsp; I am not sensitive to salt and probably should of returned it, but I didn&#039;t and it has left a bad (salty) taste in my mouth ever since.&nbsp; I hope this is not a sign of a new chef bringing the quality down. <br />And although the quality of the meat was just fine, I was surprised when they brought me the steak and it very closely resembled a certain lower region of a maile anatomy.&nbsp; It really was funny, b/c my wife started laughing too at the most falic piece of steak I&#039;ve ever seen.<br />Because of the good meals I&#039;ve had there before, I will give them another, but only one more.

				I really hate to jump on the bandwagon here because my first few times here were good. However, the last time I went (over the late summer) the whole experience was horrible. We initially waited a solid 30 minutes (restaurant wasn&#039;t busy) for our food to come out and my husband&#039;s entree came out 15 minutes later than mine on top of that. His burgers were overdone (when they were asked for medium rare) and served on cold hard buns. Oh, and they were smallest saddest little mounds of beef —I mean like tasting size portions. My entree was completely off from the description in the menu, which if you&#039;re really in the mood for something, isn&#039;t a fun experience! They offered to take the burger back, but frankly we had waited long enough as it was that we were starving and just ate. The only compensation for everything was our wine glass. If it weren&#039;t so far away from where we live, we might give it another shot, but it looks like most people&#039;s recent experience of it is the trend and not the exception. There are just too many other excellent and more affordable restaurants in Astoria to go back to that. And if we&#039;re going to go that far, we&#039;d rather go into the city.

				Had dinner here last night. Haven&#039;t been in months but happy to see all still good.&nbsp; Got there at 730pm while room was filling up.&nbsp; Ordered 6 apps/sushi small plates for our dinner.&nbsp; First half came out on time and second half was a bit slower due to a packed room.&nbsp; Waiter was new but did a fine job.&nbsp; <br /><br />Alligator fritters were crisp and had nice sauce on side.&nbsp; Really great dish, never had it before.<br />White tune with cocoa soy, loved it.&nbsp; Just sounds like such an odd combo but worked out beautifully.<br />Foi gras terrine with fig jam!&nbsp; Enough said.<br />Crispy crawfish was good.<br />Goat cheese salad with sesame seeds.<br />Dragon roll with eel.&nbsp; I love this roll.&nbsp; Great way to end the meal.<br />Bottle of sake.&nbsp; <br /><br />Had a great time, nice to see a place doing well these days.&nbsp; I know that I am biased towards this place but after a few months of reading bad reviews we were concerned.&nbsp; Maybe we hit it on a good night but it really was a terrific meal and made our night.&nbsp; Looks like some of our local places are faring better then ones in the city.&nbsp; Can&#039;t wait to go back sometime soon.&nbsp;

				Went here again (I try to go as often as I can, as I am a fan) for brunch on Sunday and tried the cheese grits as a side--hands down best grits I have ever had.<br /><br />I think I should note to some here that the owner/chef trained under (I BELIEVE) the same head chef who began the Nobu restaurants; therefore, the cuisine is exactly what the menu seems to scream: Japanese/French fusion. In other words, I wouldn&#039;t really go here to order a BURGER. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m not defending the mistakes--a burger is easy as pie to make so it definitely shouldn&#039;t be coming out of the kitchen in a near non-edible state. However, I urge some of you who may have had bad experiences to go back and try some of the more different items on the menu. For instance, I am not usually a fan of grits but I opted to try their cheese grits and like I said: FANTASTIC! Even my mom agreed that they were some of the best she&#039;d ever had. <br /><br />I will say that, for the first time, I saw a TON of babies and strollers. I love children but I don&#039;t know how this place became a mecca for them; it&#039;s so tiny! Some of the kids that were there were running around the restaurant, bumping into other chairs, knocking coats over, and putting their hands all over the windows and doors.

				I went to Bistro 33 with my boyfriend for New Years. The prices are a little high, but the quality of food and service was fantastic. I had the lamb shank and it was delicious...the meat literally fell off the bone. My boyfriend had the duck leg and it was done perfectly. We enjoyed everything, including the short (but cold) walk to the water afterwards. <br /><br />Bistro 33 may not be for everyone, but I love it and enjoy having it as an option here in Astoria instead having to go all the way to Manhattan.

				I&#039;m sad to admit but I was actually disappointed with Bistro 33 tonight.&nbsp; We&#039;ve been huge fans since they moved to Ditmars but they&#039;ve once again changed the menu.&nbsp; Gone now are the burgers that were so amazing, the chicken with parsnips and the hangar steak (all three were our favourite things on the menu).&nbsp; They do have short rib slides but its stuffed with foie gras of which I&#039;m not a fan.&nbsp; We both ended up having the petite steak which was tiny tiny tiny.<br /><br />I was really bummed as we had a really amazing brunch there a couple of weeks back but they didn&#039;t have burgers on the menu (although the cheese grits were AMAZING!) so we went back for dinner tonight in hopes of getting some.<br /><br />Hopefully they will change the menu and add back some of the old items as I really love going to this place!
