				Dry cleaning your suits/coats can be expensive, especially if you get it done at your neighborhood cleaner. &nbsp;When I have time and have lots of suits to clean, this is where I go to. &nbsp;I found this place when I used to moonlight as a limousine driver years ago. &nbsp;Although I no longer drive, I still go to the factory to get my dry cleaning done whenever time allows.<br /><br />The place has no name. &nbsp;No sign. &nbsp;Not even an address at the door. &nbsp;Don't even expect it to be on Yellow Pages. &nbsp;You won't find it. &nbsp;It's just a factory. &nbsp;So you just have to go find it. &nbsp;It is approximately at 3730 30th Street, Long Island City, NY &nbsp;11101, near 38th Avenue. &nbsp;You can get off at either N,W train 39th Avenue or 36th Avenue station. &nbsp;It is right across from Local 580 Training Facility, right next to limousine garage (yes, that's where I used to work for)<br /><br />No worker speaks English (just some basic words... like &quot;clean&quot;, &quot;tomorrow&quot;, &quot;what time&quot;, etc...) &nbsp;Mostly either Spanish or Chinese (I believe owners are Chinese) so if you speak either language, you'll have an easier time. &nbsp;<br /><br />And it is cheap! &nbsp;I recently had 3 of my suits ($5 x3) get done along with my winter coat ($5) and I only paid $20. &nbsp;This would have been double if I had had them done at a neighborhood cleaner. &nbsp;One set of suits (jacket and pants) can be cleaned at around $5. &nbsp;<br /><br />Supposedly, this is the place where many of neighborhood cleaners &quot;outsource&quot; their work, &nbsp;My guess is that is why they're so cheap... &nbsp;Plus most workers appear to be illegal. &nbsp;I guess that's the reality of this country. &nbsp;<br /><br />They don't do fixing/tayloring. &nbsp;Just cleaning. &nbsp;Keep that in mind. They are open between 7am to 8pm everyday. &nbsp;Good luck finding it... Actually it's not as hard as you would think.<br /><br />Nick
