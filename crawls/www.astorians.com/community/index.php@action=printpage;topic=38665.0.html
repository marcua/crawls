				I think this is a great addition to the neighborhood.&nbsp; Clean, bright, and welcoming inside.&nbsp; Very nice variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, dairy, snacks, and a full deli.&nbsp; Even a little parking out front for folks with cars.&nbsp; 31st Street between Ditmars and Astoria Blvd next to Agora Plaza. http://www.manavigourmet.com/

				And that was remodeled and opened in no time. Meanwhile, that &quot;Mediterranean Market&quot; under the Train Viaduct at 35th is still under construction and haven&#039;t seen any progress for several weeks.

				Manavi is a great addition.&nbsp; They&#039;re very friendly, they have a good deli section and an interesting selection of treats.&nbsp; I hope they do a great lunch business when the medical businesses across the street open up.

				I had a good experience during the one time I went in there. Friendly staff and they had everything I needed on my small list. I also loved the challah burger rolls I got - a nice option to potato rolls, which I love - these have a bit more heft which being pleasantly squishy. Bottom line: I really like what they&#039;ve done with the place.

				I believe Mediterranean Market will be moving from Agora Plaza to the new place. It doesn&#039;t make sense to have 2 stores only 2 short blocks away.

				Somebody else mentioned the medical building across the street and that they would bring business to the market.&nbsp; I just wanted to let that person know that the medical building isn&#039;t supposed to open anymore.
