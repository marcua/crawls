				I imagine McD that you are much more familiar with the challenges and issues raised.<br />I wish that hopes for change would be greater.<br /><br />All or most of the committee members were there and some speakers included former members of the legislature and academics.<br /><br />http://reformny.blogspot.com/<br /><br />The link has some updates and mentions Larry Norden and Eric Lane. When voters actually have a choice for Assembly or Senate, I hope they would consider the bullet point list of suggested reforms.<br />I appreciated the realistic outlook of the testimony, the candidness, the insights, and the reforms are simply to bring NYS in line with how govt. has worked better elsewhere for decades.<br /><br /><br />From their recent updates:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Among the highlights:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Giving members the right to have bills drafted within a reasonable period of time<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Limiting the number of bills a member can introduce in the Assembly to thirty<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Ensuring that conference committees include members from each party proportional to their representation in the chamber<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Rejecting messages of necessity not approved by a two thirds majority of the chamber<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Requiring actuaries who prepare fiscal notes to attest to no conflict of interest<br /><strong><br />All of the resolutions failed</strong>, even the one that made the single, seemingly modest request that “Access to rooms and facilities by the Minority shall not be unreasonably withheld and once granted, not changed without consent.”<br /><br />But it’s not all bad news. Three of the bills had meaningful, if not substantial, bipartisan support.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				What is the difference between Chicago and Albany?<br />Would you say there is transparency and accountability in NY?<br /><br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/30/nyregion/30budget.html?hp<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">ALBANY — <br />Concluding the most secretive budget negotiations in recent memory, Gov. David A. Paterson and leaders of the Legislature outlined a $131.8 billion agreement on Sunday that would close the state’s gaping deficit with billions of dollars in new taxes, financing from the federal stimulus and a substantial slowdown in the growth of health care spending.<br /><br />The final days of negotiations between Mr. Paterson, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Senate Majority Leader Malcolm A. Smith have been conducted under a veil of secrecy so profound that even well-seasoned Albany cynics were taken aback. &nbsp;<br /><br />And despite the enormous fiscal pressure the state faces, the budget contains $170 million in financing for pet projects — an amount unchanged from last year — suggesting that Albany’s appetite for with what critics call pork-barrel spending appeared to be undiminished. Listed in the budget were grants to gun clubs, an upstate museum dedicated to bricks and brick-making, the Soccer Hall of Fame in Oneonta and an organization known as the Urban Yoga Foundation.<br /><br />With the stimulus money and other federal grants, total spending would rise over the next year by $10.5 billion, or 8.7 percent, a major expansion, though the state’s direct spending, which excludes federal funds, would rise by about $3.3 billion, higher than the rate of inflation.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />In the end, I guess it is a question of accept the status quo in NYS or move again to another state.

				Zappa! What have you been up to?<br />Feel free to PM.<br /><br />I dont know about dysfunctional govt being cheaper. I think it is more expensive.<br />It seems only 2 local elected officials, one in the Assembly and one in the Senate, get together and spend and tax as much as they want. With seemingly no checks or balances.<br />It is sadly too easy for me to rant about this.<br /><br />But I do understand a desire perhaps for divided govt. where parties check each other and limit how much legislation is completed.<br /><br />As it is now, legislation is never refined never scrutinized.
