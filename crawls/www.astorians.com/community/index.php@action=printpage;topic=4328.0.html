				<br />I&#39;s anyone a professional photographer that might be able to advise meon a good school to attend/classes/workshops? <br />I work full time but would like to become a professional photographer...at least looking into it so I know what my options are. I&#39;m almost 30, work full time..but have a pretty flexable schedule. I&#39;d have to take out student loans.<br />Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I have been looking online a bit but it never hurts to ask and get some opinions.<br />Thanks!

				NYC is a pretty good place to start. Parsons school of design, International center for photography, NYU. What kind of photography are you going to try getting into? PJ, Wedding, Fine Art? You might want to check out Photo.net, I think that&#39;s a pretty good resource.

				The School of Visual Arts is one of the best colleges in New York as far as photography classes. They have an incredible number of options as far as coursework, from artistic to photojournalism type classes.<br /><br />http://www.schoolofvisualarts.edu/

Big ups to SVA from me, but it is $$$ (I&#39;m gonna be paying for it until I&#39;m dead, prolly). I don&#39;t know what your situation is, but they do have continuing ed and Summer programs - if you&#39;re ever near the main building (23rd St. between 2nd and 3rd ave), go into the admissions office (its right on the ground level) and grab some catalogs and whatever. If not call or email and have them send stuff to you. You should do this for all the other schools mentioned too. You just missed the photography open house at SVA though - that&#39;s every November. Not sure if they do one in the spring.<br /><br />Also check out ICP - www.icp.org (http://www.icp.org), and click on school.<br /><br />Also, I went back to school after working full time for awhile (did both and commuted from CT for my first 2 years at SVA), and while its tough, you can do it if you&#39;re really into it. If you want to get in for next fall though, get on it! I had all my stuff in at SVA in early March &#39;03 and started in September &#39;03, and I think I was pushing it a bit there.

				ICP (International Center of Photography) at http://www.icp.org<br />I h ad been an assistant darkroom teacher for several years when they had their building <br />up on 94th Street &amp; 5th Avenue.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />You could also try “Parsons The New School for Design”:&nbsp; http://www.parsons.edu/search.aspx?srch=photography<br />

				I also think SVA is a great place to learn photography.&nbsp; I took a few continuing ed classes there and loved it.&nbsp; &nbsp; A friend of mine is going to Briarcliff College to get an associates degree in digital photography.&nbsp; Digital is the wave of the future.&nbsp; http://www.bcbeth.com/

				Depends on how serious you are and how much you want to spend.<br /><br />ICP is good, but the classes in the continuing education program run about $700 per.&nbsp; I found them frustrating because everyone was on a different level and the &quot;photographers&quot; who couldn&#039;t so much as work their cameras ran the show.&nbsp; But, their facilities were top-notch.&nbsp; SVA&#039;s C.E. programs were far cheaper, the classes smaller, the attention much more one-on-one.<br /><br />If you&#039;re just getting your feet wet, try SVA. <br /><br />Good luck.

I know this because I taught a Photoshop crash course there a couple of years ago that was 5 days a week, 6-10pm. It was tough but doable. I also have a friend that still teaches there.
