				A LOT<br /><br />It&#39;s two words people!!!<br /><br />It&#39;s an amount of stuff like<br />a couple<br />a few<br />a lot<br /><br /><br /><br />I don&#39;t know why.... it bothers me soooo much.&nbsp; I&#39;m a terrible speller.&nbsp; Not much of a grammarian.&nbsp; But for some reason the incorrect spelling of this phrase has always bugged the beejeepers out of me.&nbsp; Maybe b/c it&#39;s the one thing I DO know how to spell correctly and therefore assume everyone else should be able to as well. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />

				If alot of people spell the word a lot as one word, does the alternate spelling becoming legitimate?&nbsp; Sort of like how base ball turned into baseball?<br /><br />People who wear their backpacks and huge purses on their shoulders in crowded trains is not really a peeve of mine.&nbsp; It&#39;s the <em>look</em> they shoot you when you try and snake past them and you bump into their bag which gets my goat.&nbsp;

				Alexa, I totally hear ya, having also worked as a barista and making lots of coffee.&nbsp; Still considering myself fairly new to the coffee making, I always asked a lot of questions.<br /><br />And I&#39;m just going to rant here:&nbsp; I ordered a cup of hot tea (herbal Yogi tea) at Sparrow the other night.&nbsp; The girl behind the counter gave me a cup of hot water, and I put the teabag in it.&nbsp; That in itself was $3 (!).&nbsp; Then, to just drop a teaspoon of milk in it, she wanted to charge me $1.&nbsp; ONE DOLLAR!&nbsp; And $3 for an 8 oz cup of tea??&nbsp; I asked her, when she told me about the milk, &quot;are you sereious??&quot;&nbsp; She ended up not charging me for the milk (begrudgingly), thank goodness. <br /><br />I&#39;ll order beer from them again, but never tea.&nbsp; WTF???

				My pet Peeve is a small hairless yorkshire terrier. About 6 months old but looks much older, some say 14 months.&nbsp; Some say ugly but i say really ugly.&nbsp; I let him sleep outside so I don&#39;t have to look at him much. Not very cuddly or cute you know.<br /><br />And that brings me to a relatively stupid pet peeve.&nbsp; Why is your baby 18 months old?? Why isn&#39;t it a year and a half?&nbsp; My nephew is 70 months and doing fine.&nbsp; Grandma was 288 months when she died recently.&nbsp; Her last birthday was hell on candles. Nearly burn her house down.&nbsp; It was blowing them out that killed her.

				Knowing the difference between you and I and you and me.&nbsp; It&#39;s a really simple rule.&nbsp; Think of it the same as if you were only referring to yourself.&nbsp; Seems like everyone says &quot;you and I&quot; exclusively these days because &quot;I&quot; sounds more propper or something, when in fact they are wrong.&nbsp; <br /><br />example...<br /><br />&quot;John gave free drinks to Bob and I&quot; is WRONG!!!!!&nbsp; You wouldn&#39;t say John gave a drink to I.&nbsp; It would be John gave a drink to ME.&nbsp; So when you add another person to the situation, the rule stays the same.&nbsp; Propperly would be &quot;John gave free drinks to Bob and me.&quot;<br /><br />or John and me went to the store.&nbsp; WRONG.&nbsp; You wouldn&#39;t say &quot;Me went to the store.&quot;<br /><br />So next time you are referring to someone else and yourself, think about how the phrase would sound if it was only you that you were referrencing.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Your and you&#39;re. Its and it&#39;s too. Those seem really simple to me, but seem to get mixed up a lot. <br /><br />Speaking of peeves, and coffee-related peeves, as a non-native New Yorker, I have a hard time ordering coffee at dunkin donuts. What&#39;s the lingo? I never seem to get across what I want just right. I like dunkin donuts coffee (and it&#39;s so much cheaper than starbucks), but I never get it because it&#39;s such a stressful thing for me to order. I always feel like an idiot. What&#39;s the code word for &quot;a LOT of skim milk and one splenda&quot;? Maybe I just need to not be so picky about how much milk is in my coffee.

				Their/they&#39;re/there is annoying, but you know what really, *really* bugs me? When people mix up breath and breathe. Makes me want to punch something. Hard.<br /><br />Also, I can&#39;t stand people who are rude/inconsiderate to cashiers or salespeople. I wish people would realize that the cashiers can&#39;t change corporate policies (refund procedures, specific items they carry, how many they have in stock, etc), and it kills me when people yell at cashiers because of something they have no control over. I worked in retail for 6 years, and I lost SO MUCH faith in humanity during that time. People could scream at me and call me any name in the book, I&#39;ve been threatened, one woman even threw a VHS tape really at my head once, but I could never do the same because &quot;the customer is always right!&quot; The worst part about it was that I always wanted to make whatever was wrong right! On the other side, rude cashiers and salespeople bug me too (especially since I&#39;m always nice, even if I&#39;m in a crappy mood), but not as much since I know what they have to deal with.

				A few of my pet peeves are also spelling-related, like when people spell definitely &quot;definately, &quot; or separate &quot;seperate.&quot; For the love of Pete, people, have you not heard the saying, &quot;there&#39;s a rat in separate.&quot;&nbsp; I hate it when people say &quot;supposably&quot; (not a word) instead of &quot;supposedly.&quot;<br /><br />I further hate it when large groups of teenagers have parties on the landing outside my apartment.&nbsp; I hate those chirpy phones.&nbsp; I hate it when my neighbors&#39; friends holler for them from the street repeatedly rather than buzzing them or calling them.&nbsp; Like now, for example.&nbsp; One of the kids next door is named Pollo (I don&#39;t know why). But instead of simply buzzing him like normal people, they stand outside on the street and scream &quot;POLLO!!!!&nbsp; POLLO!!!!!&nbsp; Hey!!!! Come to the window!!!!!&quot; over and over.&nbsp; It&#39;s frankly obnoxious.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also hate hearing and seeing people spit in the street.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are lots of societal things I hate that I won&#39;t mention here for fear of starting a very scary debate.<br /><br />And most of all, like NYCMacUser, I loathe people who are cruel, neglectful, or disrespectful to animals.&nbsp; They do not have their own voices to tell someone when they&#39;re being mistreated.&nbsp; It&#39;s our responsibility to make sure they&#39;re cared for.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good thread, Jennifer!&nbsp; I feel so much better unleashing that.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)

				Grammarwise, it drives me crazy when people can&#39;t match the number of their noun to the number of their verb (ie- using a plural verb with a singular subject). it&#39;s something our so-called president does all the time, and I&#39;ve noticed more and more people doing it, even newcasters!<br /><br />On that note, typos and grammatical errors on serious publications also frustrate the hell out of me. Blogs and listservs are one thing, but the NYTimes should be able to spell independence! (NOT independance!)<br /><br />Cruelty to animals, and to children. <br />Then there is the whole list of subway faux pas, which I won&#39;t get into.<br />The way people always tend to stop and have an extended conversation in the narrowest spot of any passage, completely oblivious to the fact that people are trying to get by.<br /><br />And finally, people who go fifty-five in the left lane on the highway. I swear, if I ever find myself in public office, I am going to start a campaign to teach people that the left lane is for passing, ONLY for passing!

				I have so many...<br />old people and people with strollers. not all of them, just the ones who think they get to do whatever they damn well please because they&#39;ve existed longer than i have or they are pushing around life&#39;s precious miracle. it does not give you the right to push me out of the way and call me a whore or use your child and its vehicle as a weapon against my ankles. <br />people who are rude. if i hold the door open for you say thank you dammit.<br />people who let their children run free in a store hiding in racks and throwing things and etc etc. come to think of it, those kids are a peeve too.<br />people who have to get super close to you on the train, even though there&#39;s room. <br />people who stand in the doorway of a train door (that&#39;s fine i do it) but then don&#39;t move when the doors open (i move off the train to accomodate passengers) and the people who cram on the train before letting you off. <br />train delays with no explanation making me 30 minutes late to work (ie, this morning on the R).<br />knowing i am going to lose my job but not when(ie the past month-but this is good, i want them to lay me off).<br />people who call and don&#39;t leave a message (you got that far just tell me what the hell you wanted).<br />*artstar this is for us* the idiots at ASC who don&#39;t get off the treadmill after 30 minutes like you are supposed to do after 5pm and keep going even though we are clearly waiting our turn. it&#39;s fine if no one is there, but if there clearly are people waiting then adhere to the rule.<br />my number one pet peeve is the damn office i work in and all the incompetent people i am surrounded by.<br /><br />

				People who insist on talking really loudly on their cell phones in public, spitting, littering, people who use machines at the gym and then don&#39;t clean them when they are done, braggarts, unnecessary horn honking and tailgating and people who block the exit/entrance of the subway when it stops at the station- move out of the freaking way!! :evil:<br /><br /><br />

				I used to have a boss who would ask me to do research in preparation for a new project. I would read up on the subject area. Then, in meetings with the vendor, he would cut me off when I tried to talk and then would talk absolute bs, having absolutely no idea about the subject but pretending that he did. The tekkies would just kind of exchange looks and I would want to crawl under the table with embarrassment. <br /><br />I&#39;m so glad I don&#39;t work there anymore.<br /><br />OK, that was a VERY specific pet peeve, but it seriously irked me.

				I gotta get this off my chest. You know how when you buy a new coat, or blazer, or skirt, and the flap in the back is stitched shut? You&#39;re supposed to undo that before you wear it. PLEASE undo it. It&#39;s stitched like that to make sure it gets to the store without getting all rumpled or creased, but you&#39;re not supposed to wear it like that. I saw a grown man with a nice long wool coat on yesterday with that damn flap stitched shut. <br /><br />Same as when the pockets are stitched shut. Obviously you&#39;re supposed to have use of your pockets, so you&#39;re expected to undo that stuff before you wear it. But I can&#39;t see your pockets. I SEE the flaps.<br /><br />If it&#39;s a friend, I tell them, or even take it upon myself to undo it for them. But strangers are out of range. And aside from the urge to run up and grab their coat and undo it for them, I simply simmer with irritation. So please help me out and undo that thread on your coat or skirt. All it takes is a pair of scissors, or a good tug. <br /><br />Many thanks.

Whatever, I&#39;ll just say lion, I haven&#39;t seen the vid in awhile.) had to ask her is she was on her period, because apparently lions can sense/smell it and become hostile or something. Now, I know dogs aren&#39;t feline, but you know...they have a pretty amazing sense of smell, so its not a long shot.

				Step right up ladies. Come closer so you can hear everything without being disturbed by all the noise. Step right over hear Miss. I&#39;d like to introduce you to my 2 fabulous crotch-sniffing canines. Here is my amazing Francis Albert. You can call him Frankie. And over here is the beautiful Miss Frieda. You may chose whichever dog you want because they both have the unique ability to determine if you are or aren&#39;t in the midst of having a menses cycle. They can also tell if you are pregnant.

				:-D Jonathan, Hysterically dying of laughter! &lt;My pet Peeve is a small hairless yorkshire terrier. About 6 months old but looks much older, some say 14 months.&nbsp; Some say ugly but i say really ugly.&nbsp; I let him sleep outside so I don&#39;t have to look at him much. Not very cuddly or cute you know.<br /><br />And that brings me to a relatively stupid pet peeve.&nbsp; Why is your baby 18 months old?? Why isn&#39;t it a year and a half?&nbsp; My nephew is 70 months and doing fine.&nbsp; Grandma was 288 months when she died recently.&nbsp; Her last birthday was hell on candles. Nearly burn her house down.&nbsp; It was blowing them out that killed her. &gt;<br /><br />I hear you on the kids and months thing, just because it says it on the clothes, doesn&#39;t mean parents have to talk that way! Re Coffee:I agree with previous—technically, black means no color, has nothing to do with sugar. But Dunkin Donuts is really pissing me off these days. Every place I went to in MA was horrible, they just couldn&#39;t get it right, either weak coffee or wrong proportions. I&#39;m so specific &#39;bout my coffee that I&#39;ve resorted to just asking for black and fixing my own milk and sugar. I haven&#39;t attempted DD in the city, I&#39;m too scared I won&#39;t have any options left. I&#39;m doing it the old-fashioned way these days-making my own at home in a pot—turkish style.<br /><br />O.K. back to pet peeves (and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll piss some of you off)<br />—smokers who just can&#39;t wait those two seconds it takes to get out of the subway and light up in the stairway<br />—people talking on their cell phones in the gym (WHEN IT CLEARLY SAYS NO CELL PHONES IN THE GYM) <br />—people who are rude/abusive to waiters<br />—tourists who don&#39;t obey left and right rules of pedestrian traffic!!!!<br />—anything to do with eating or drinking, noise and an open mouth. Yes, I&#39;m a very silent eater. :&nbsp; )<br />—small dogs in big bags<br />—people who bring their innappropriately aged children to violent and horror films

				I never understood the rule of cell phones at the gym...but maybe i&#39;m not catching something...it is already so loud, talking is certainly allowed, and while it is a safetly issue with some of the machinery, that is not why I think everyone gets bothered by it. I don&#39;t see any postings regarding &quot;I get so frustrated when people are unsafe with their cell phones at the gym..&quot; Rather it is an annoyance, but how is the gym different from the supermarket, mall, book store, cafe, etc.?

				http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20040412.html<br /><br />This is an interesting study analyzing why cell phone use is deemed more annoying than two individuals talking loudly face to face.

				I was going to let the age of kids by month thing go, but since it&#39;s been brought up again, I feel a need to comment.<br /><br />I would have agreed with that being annoying a little while ago, but when I had a kid, I discovered that developmental milestones hit very often with kids and talking about their age in half years doesn&#39;t cut it.&nbsp; There are some things that kids tend to do around 14-15 months, but if they aren&#39;t doing those things at 18 months, there might be a problem.<br /><br />Hence, people break kids ages down to months for the first couple years.&nbsp; Actually, it&#39;s weeks for the first months often (though we lost track of that after about 8 weeks)&nbsp; It&#39;s amazing how fast those buggers change!&nbsp;

				I&#39;m kinda having a pet peeve with this whole nodding thing, especially the negative ones.&nbsp; I keep coming across negative nodded posts where the negative nodder won&#39;t post why they did had a problem with the post, and most of the time, I can&#39;t for the life of me figure out what problem there would be with it.&nbsp; I sometimes will just nod someone back up because I can&#39;t figure out why they got a negative one.&nbsp; I guess I still don&#39;t like them and don&#39;t see their point.&nbsp; If you don&#39;t agree with someone, just post that.&nbsp; I do wonder if some people get negative nods because someone doesn&#39;t like that person.&nbsp; But that would be so high school up in here.&nbsp; <br /><br />Watch me get a negative nod now.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D

				I don&#39;t mind cliques, actually. I expect a very large group of people to gradually segment into groups of smaller people with similar interests and tastes. Cliques are annoying when they aren&#39;t welcoming to new people, of course, or when they marginalize others, but I don&#39;t think this is too much of a problem here. If your experience differs, please feel free to say so. <br /><br />I&#39;ve never positive- or negative-nodded a post because I liked or disliked the poster. Either I agreed with them or thought they at least had put a lot of good thought into their post and were making a good contribution to the discussion.

Likewise, someone might positive nod you because they misunderstand your position, or you sound like their third grade teacher.<br /><br />On the other hand, many people (the majority I think) use the nods more consistently as a show of agreement with the central idea or core argument. A few people abuse it. I wouldn&#39;t let it bug you.<br /><br />The other possibility is that someone got pissed off and they are just acting petty and immature. Still, if you look at the vast vast majority here there&#39;s no widespread problem with this, and there are many instances where I think the nods helped the community avoid a flame war by giving the community a chance to express their views without writing a manifesto.

				I totally agree about pole huggers.&nbsp; They are really annoying.<br />I had someone do something really odd to me the other day.&nbsp; There were seats available, but this person came over to stand next to me, I was on the end seat,and they used their knuckles up against me for about ten stops on the grip at the end of the bench.&nbsp; If there hadn&#039;t been seats I wouldn&#039;t have thought much of it, but given that there were options, it seemed really somewhat passive aggressive to me.&nbsp; I always slide as far over as possible to maximize room on the bench for others.&nbsp; In this case, I really wish I&#039;d had an extra inch or two to my right to get away.&nbsp; &nbsp;I ended up leaning forward and just being annoyed.

				I have been driven to distraction recently with one word. Irregardless. Folks, there is no such word. If you want to say, &#039;regardless of the situation&#039; or &#039;regardless of the position&#039; then just say it. Placing the totally illogical negative prefix (ir) in front of the word regardless makes you sound like a non-English speaker who just hasn&#039;t got a clue! <br /><br />Whew.

				I have a related pet peeve, except it&#039;s something the customers would do to me that would piss me off beyond all reason.&nbsp; (I was a grocery cashier for 6 years in case there is someone in Siberia I haven&#039;t told yet.) So I tell the person their total, and they&#039;re getting their cash out of their wallet, getting ready to give it to me, so I stick my hand out to receive it and they subsequently drop it onto my produce scale.&nbsp; Coins, too.&nbsp; What the hell?! This would piss me off because it&#039;s rude, but also because it would totally slow me down.&nbsp; I had to chase freakin&#039; dimes and pennies around the damn conveyor belt and organize the cash so I could neatly stick it into the drawer.&nbsp; Each transaction was electronically, including the tendering, and it would irk me to no end that some jerk who thought he/she was too important to hand me their money would completely throw off my groove.&nbsp; (I was the fastest checker at my store, consistently every week, and people used to tell me that they would wait in my line even if it was technically longer because they knew they&#039;d get served way faster than if they waited in someone else&#039;s line.&nbsp; People would actually ask the managers to put me on express because, seriously, I rocked it.&nbsp; I know, I know ... it&#039;s truly amazing.&nbsp; &nbsp;:roll: Everybody&#039;s good at something, right?)<br /><br />Fortunately, I figured out a neurotic way to get revenge.&nbsp; Any change from the money flung carelessly onto my produce scale would not be placed in the waiting hand.&nbsp; It got plunked down onto the little check-writing-platform thingy.&nbsp; Mwahahahahahah!!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;:evil:&nbsp; Take that, you money-chucking bastard!!!!<br /><br />And, just to gild the lily, assuming someone decent and lovely went through my line and paid cash, I would hand said customer back their change, let them get it sorted, and THEN I would hand them the bills.&nbsp; &lt;takes bow&gt; Thanks folks .... no pictures, please ... here all week ....

				Something I can&#039;t stand is when someone is smoking while waiting in a line.&nbsp; Yesterday, I got off the train and the line for the bus was long enough to assume a bus was right there.&nbsp; This lady in front of me starts smoking and blowing it everywhere.&nbsp; Then after she is done, she spat on the ground, not to far from where I was standing.&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t you know you, the lady stars coughing hysterically. What does she do?&nbsp; She pulls out her inhaler!&nbsp; I don&#039;t know about that!<br /><br />Also, the other day, while getting on the bus, some girl, maybe 17/18ish sneaked in the back door while we were getting on in the front.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like farejumpers.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t pay the fare of only $2.00, don&#039;t get on!

				I don&#039;t know if this is a pet peeve, or just plain wrong, but I absolutely can&#039;t stand when people that do not need to use an elevator in a three floor building get on the elevator. I was rolling a projector and laptop onto an elevator at a local college, and when the door opened, it was full of people that were able to walk and were taking the elevator up one floor. I wanted to scream. Luckily I didn&#039;t have to. An individual in a wheelchair came up behind me and several individuals sheepishly got off the elevator. <br /><br />Sorry, this has been happening a lot. I feel like putting up a sign.

				I love when you call a business to solve a certain problem, and you go through the entire explanation, and then they tell you to hold on.&nbsp; You assume it&#039;s to solve your problem, but no, they&#039;ve just transferred you to someone else, without telling you you&#039;ve been transferred, and without telling that person what your problem is.&nbsp; So you have to go through the entire explanation all over again.&nbsp; <br /><br />Of course, you&#039;re lucky if you get to talk to a live person at all.&nbsp; Press 1 if you&#039;re this, press 2 if you&#039;re that, and so on and so forth.&nbsp; Sometimes pressing 0 for a live operator doesn&#039;t even work.&nbsp; Just give me a live person already!!&nbsp;

				Daisy - my new favourite trick is to say something utterly unintelligible to the auto-prompt thingy. Or hold it near the TV. Or make a nonsense noise. This more often than not drops you straight through to a real person [TM].

				Riding the rails with homeless men who pee their pants seriously skeeves me out.&nbsp; I got on a semi-crowded train at 10:30 last night, and noticed liquid running all over the floor.&nbsp; I had to get out and switch cars by Queensboro Plaza because the homeless dude sitting on the train turned around to face everyone, and he was wet all down his pants.&nbsp; And he was sleeping!!&nbsp; My stomach proceeded to churn, and I just had to get off.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t believe that people actually sat through all this, some right even next to him.&nbsp; Their feet in his urine!!!<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if this qualifies as a pet peeve, and I know I do feel sorry for homeless people, but as the summer is upon us, the smells and behaviors of some of them, just turns my stomach&nbsp; :-P&nbsp; Not an easily solved problem.

				i loathe that bank. the only way to get in and out is when they open...but as you saw people line up way before. i actually remember going at 10:00 on a saturday morning to make a deposit and not only was the line out the door, the ATM wasn&#039;t working so i couldn&#039;t even make a deposit there. i left the bank at 12:00 that time. I couldn&#039;t take hiking up there just to do any sort of banking and doing it in manhattan on your lunch break means that&#039;s all you get to do. (i actually missed eating because of this). <br />that bank can suck it.<br />i switched to commerce and haven&#039;t looked back. <br /><br />and yeah, crossing northern there is crazy! so is 48th. if you step off the curb immediately after the light turns green (or the walking dude to be more specific) it&#039;s flashing before you make it halfway across and changed to red by the time you&#039;re just at the opposite curb.<br />I&#039;ve found it safer to cross at 47th street. its a longer light for pedestrians.

				My number&nbsp; one peeve&nbsp; in Astoria&nbsp; is&nbsp; people&nbsp; who moved from Manhattan&nbsp; to escape&nbsp; noise, pollution, higher rents and boutique &#039;eateries&#039; bringing all that&nbsp; with them, including the G-d awful&nbsp; &#039;newspaper&#039; boxes&nbsp; on every street corner&nbsp; of the once&nbsp; small town.

				bosses who tell you &quot;no i don&#039;t need to know when you go out to lunch&quot; repeatedly and then proceed to constantly look for you during lunch hours and get pissed off that you are apparantly never here when they need you. <br />If you need someone and you can&#039;t find them between 12 and 2 then obviously they are out to lunch. either eating, walking or running errands (usually i walk around, run some errands and grab something on the way back to eat at my desk never taking more than 60 minutes...well unless he is totally out of the office travelling). <br />If you supposedly don&#039;t need to know where i am at any given moment then don&#039;t be pissy and aggravated that you can&#039;t find me.&nbsp; :x<br /><br />AND don&#039;t get annoyed when you ask me to do something and i propose a quicker and more efficient way to do it.

				That&#039;s creepy!&nbsp; <br /><br />I guess it&#039;s still OT since it&#039;s a pet peeve of mine and I&#039;m ranting, but I don&#039;t particularly care for the &quot;Oriental woman&quot; fetish thing.&nbsp; I can&#039;t tell you how many white guys would ask me if I had any hot Oriental female friends since I&#039;m Korean.&nbsp; When I was in college, I used to hang out with a group of Korean women and I was constantly being asked about their availability and if they dated white guys.&nbsp; My friend, who is Filipino, was dating one of the members of our group and dudes would come up to the girl, while he was sitting with her and try to talk to her.&nbsp; I went to a small college and if you lived on campus, you knew who was going out with who, so it was pretty much common knowledge that they were a couple. It was very disrespectful to both of them, but I think the stereotype regarding the emasculated Asian male and the mystique of the &quot;Oriental&quot; woman just emboldened the suitors.&nbsp; I&#039;m all for interracial dating/marriage/coupling whatever your race, but I find fetishes based on race to be kind of creepy.

				I never got the seat up or down either...who cares...<br /><br />What I DON&#039;T get is why women don&#039;t just sit on the F&#039;n toilet. It is much more sanitary to put your f&#039;n thigh backs on a toilet than balance over it and spray the whole bathroom seat, handle, floor, etc. I mean, how many germs to you actually think accumulate on the backs of your thighs? or anyone else&#039;s for that matter Take the plunge, and take a seat. <br /><br />I think Penn n Teller, did an analysis on their show where they analyzed the germs on a public toilet versus the germs in a clean sink of a private home kitchen...guess which was higher?

				The toilet has a lid for a reason! The default position for a toilet not being used is CLOSED.<br /><br />Why? Because who the hell wants the gaping maw of a bowl of toilet water waiting for your toothbrush or jewelry to fall inside? What&#039;s the appeal of having open when it doesn&#039;t need to be?<br /><br />For guys, the bathroom is for defecating. For women, it&#039;s where we apply make-up, wash hands, remove jewelry, do hair, remove make-up, moisturize, pluck eyebrows, etc. etc. in addition to taking care of bodily functions. So having a giant bowl of dirty water waiting right next to the sink is ridiculous.<br /><br />Besides, at home, my cat loves to sit on the covered toilet seat and hang out. It&#039;s like a step for her to get up onto the sink, which she also loves.

				OK wait... so you&#039;re saying that if we (men) put the seat AND the lid down you&#039;re ok with it, but leaving both up is NOT ok?&nbsp; &nbsp;I always hear the argument about the SEAT, never the lid.&nbsp; &nbsp; It&#039;s just about the same effort to lift the lid as it is to lower the seat, so I&#039;m wondering what the real issue is.

				the big issue is that its nasty. i don&#039;t need to see your pee on the bowl and on the seat. especially when i have to then touch the seat so that i could use it. and i am not related to these people. when john does it i put it down...i growl at him but i put it down. i shouldn&#039;t have to do this for my coworkers. and not to mention, when you go into a restroom, is it more pleasant to see the seat down, or up? <br />and since women need the seat down for everything and men need it up for one out of two, i think we trump you.

				Women are no better than men in cleanliness of the bathroom, and yes, in other areas as well.&nbsp; I went through a number of college roommates who were female, yet some of the dirtiest people on the planet.&nbsp; It&#039;s a public bathroom folks, whether at work or not.&nbsp; Some of your fellow coworkers are bound to be disgusting and dirty, and there&#039;s not much to be done about it, besides deciding to work at home.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I&#039;ve seen more than just pee on the seat in the women&#039;s bathroom, and number 2, well, what&#039;s happened to flushing???<br /><br />As far as lifting the seat and not lifting the seat, it&#039;s hardly a major inconvenience.&nbsp; If there is a top lid, I do prefer that it&#039;s put down before the flush, so the bacteria doesn&#039;t fly everywhere, but most of the time there is no lid, so what&#039;s the difference?&nbsp; If men have to lift the seat to do their business, women can just as easily put down the seat.

Jeeez.<br /><br />He turned out to be a jerk in other ways, no surprise there.<br /><br />Speaking of doors, I can&#039;t get over holding one open for somebody who breezes through without so much as a &quot;thanks&quot; or a smile.

				I agree that you can&#039;t always just say you&#039;re from where you were born, definitely... you&#039;d always feel like a tourist or like you don&#039;t belong. I just don&#039;t think people should pretend they&#039;re New Yorkers after one year of living here. Even coming from Long Island, I never say &quot;New York&quot;, I always say LI in response to that question, because saying NY implies NYC.&nbsp; If out of state, I&#039;ll say NY, but only then.&nbsp; Sex and the City actually addressed the &quot;When do you become a New Yorker&quot; issue in one episode - Carrie said 10 years.&nbsp; That&#039;s just an opinion, of course, but I think there&#039;s some validity there. How about just &quot;Originally, Oklahoma. Been here 4 years&quot; - that&#039;s not too lengthy at all!&nbsp; &nbsp;Plus, this is my pet peeve, it&#039;s allowed to be <em>unreasonable</em> to others, we all have our own weird preferences when it comes to certain things.

				I think 10 years might be a good bench mark for most. Maybe it should be proportionate to your life. Where have you lived for the largest percentage of time that you&#039;ve been alive? Ha ha! That might make sense.<br />

				Regarding &quot;where you&#039;re from,&quot; if that conversation is taking place here in the &#039;hood, the implication is that the person asking knows you live in the NYC area already, and is curious about where you grew up. &quot;Long Island&quot; is where I&#039;m from when talking to other NY&#039;ers; &quot;New York&quot; is where I&#039;m from when I&#039;m out-of-state and somebody&#039;s inquiring about my strangeness.<br /><br />Good grammar/spelling IS important, a little less so when posting on the internet or in an informal e-mail; but at work, to customers, inter-office memos....I can&#039;t stand it when I&#039;m reading the newspaper, magazine or an advertisement and the wrong &quot;its&quot; is being used, for example.&nbsp; :x

				With regards to the where you are from discussion,<br /><br />I think it has to do with identification.&nbsp; Some people connect very quickly to an area and it quickly becomes their home.&nbsp; Where their loyalties lay and where their sympathies lie.&nbsp; To really &quot;get&quot; any locale, there is a particular, if varied, frame of mind one has to have.&nbsp; If one has this, then they can quickly and in my mind, legitimately, describe that locale as they&#039;re origin.&nbsp; I do not think a minimum stay of time is needed.&nbsp; Transients have a particular mindset and its obvious.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived here for 13 years, but I&#039;ve known this was going to be my home within a few months (on the flip side, all this time, I still feel like a tourist when I go into Manhattan).<br /><br />Its kind of like alot of people who have come to this country.&nbsp; They might have thick accents and cultures and mannerisms from their old country, but they identify with America and they are mentally American.&nbsp; That&#039;s an American in my book.

				I agree that where you identify with is much more important in where you&#039;re from...I call both NYC and NOLA home, and would never remotely say that I was &quot;from&quot; where I was born. I frankly would rather die. <br /><br />By the same token, I&#039;m a hell of a lot more &quot;from&quot; NYC than the native Manhattanite who thinks that New York only refers to the island, doesn&#039;t know how to get to Astoria (poor disillusioned trendoids) and doesn&#039;t even realize that you can get to a beach from within the city.<br /><br />Until you know the outer boros (at least 3 of them) and can name 3-5 neighborhoods outside of your own, you&#039;re still a tourist. :-D

				Do most of you have full keyboard phones? &nbsp;Or do you that thing called smart text? &nbsp;Or do you just have really fast tiny fingers that can type out fully grammatically correct messages on a phone that has 4 characters to a really tiny key? &nbsp;Maybe it&#039;s like video games and your thumbs get used to it and you get better and better at it. &nbsp;Does it really matter if they are not grammatically correct? &nbsp;I guess I&#039;m old fashioned and would rather someone call me to make plans or break them, rather than text me. &nbsp;Seems quicker to call me and ask if I want coffee on your way into the building, than to type it all out. &nbsp;But watching my teenage brother text makes me realize just how out of touch I really am with this craze.

				On the phone text, I am all thumbs&nbsp; :lol:&nbsp; I don&#039;t have full sized keyboards, or games.&nbsp; I have smart text, but I have never used it.&nbsp; It seems too complicated.<br /><br />I dislike gabbing away on the phone unless it is with someone who I cannot, for geographical reason, be able to gab away with them face to face.&nbsp; With those I can see, the phone is just a tool to send information, make or break plans.<br /><br />As for grammar, I could care less.&nbsp; Same goes for the internet.&nbsp; I can&#039;t see why someone would even care about application of a set of grammar rules which were drawn from Latin and then applied to English in the 18th century, rules which the Romans themselves didn&#039;t even practice.

				Must be my crappy phone then and the type of text messages I get.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have smart text and it literally takes me forever to type out a text on the small keypad, so I usually just call people back or email them later on a regular keyboard.&nbsp; I have gotten text messages for coffee, make or break plans, and more frequently in internet dating as a way to return an actual phonecall.&nbsp; I&#039;m not much of a phone gabber either, and I think people think if they call someone they&#039;ll be dragged into an actual conversation.&nbsp; Texting is a good way to avoid it if you don&#039;t have time.&nbsp; I think I&#039;ll stick to leaving voicemails and using email since my phone just sucks at texting.&nbsp; But it would be nice if when you&#039;re first trying to get to know someone when dating, that they would call you more than just text message you all the time.

				Oh for goodness sakes. Im not saying that children should be banned from riding the subway or being taken to the doctor. On the contrary. <br />Example: I worked in a wine shop in Manhattan and at least once an hour a parent with a child in a stroller would leisurely zig zag through the aisles, allowing their kids to reach out and grab at the bottles...GLASS bottles...and not to mention the toddling toddlers grabbing and screaming.&#160; Talk about irresponsible! And then I get chastized for telling the parents to please take their children away from the glass because I didnt&#039; want them to get hurt!<br /><br />My point is that I resent the growing sense of entitlement from women who feel that their children allow them -- and somehow entitles them - to get special treatment, and that I, as a non-parent, am just expected to go along with it and nod my head because &quot;aaah, its just a kid&quot;.&#160;That&#039;s a load of crap. <br /><br />&nbsp;And I am not alone. <br /><br />This article hit home with me, as a woman who chooses to remain childless and who resents being considered &quot;pre-pregnant&quot; by my gyno and the US government. <br /><br />http://www.nyobserver.com/2007/epater-le-b-b<br />

				Space on a subway for your kids is not special treatment. Folding up a stroller with two babies is not possible. <br /><br />I&#039;m a huge advocate for individuals that do not have children and who choose not to have children, but children have rights as well, and they need to get to daycare and they need to get to doctors appointments. And empty unfolded stroller is annoying. A stroller filled with a sleeping child, we need to get over it. <br /><br />But I can respect it as a peeve..not like any of these other peeves have to make sense or be defended. That is the whole idea of a peeve. Things that piss you off regardless of logic.

				Most people won&#039;t remember this but I recall in the 1960s when the MTA had the following small sign up on all subway cars:<br /><br /><em>Little enough to ride for free? <br />Little enough to ride your knee. </em><br /><br />I&#039;m not saying children that don&#039;t pay a fare shouldn&#039;t get a seat, but many times I&#039;ve seen families with several small kids sprawled out across a whole section of seating, and when an elderly person gets on, nobody gives them their seat, and they have to stand. There should be some consideration, but too many parents are oblivious to courtesy and manners, so the kids never learn any better.

				I think folks should not have a problem bringing strollers on the subway and try to give up my seat when I see a woman with a stroller, I even help carry them up and down stairs, but I see more folks using strollers as a weapon of sorts, and that really really grates on me.&nbsp; When you get your foot run over or get hit by a stroller, even when you&#039;re trying to get out of the way, it just makes me wonder what is going on in the mind of some of these folks. I know I&#039;d be worried that someone would fall over on my kid or get agitated with me if I did some of the aggressive behavior I&#039;ve been seeing.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen it a lot more in Manhattan than elsewhere and mainly in parks and on sidewalks.&nbsp; Maybe the sidewalk frenzy just gets to folks?

				I think that a lot of stroller rage, and sidewalk courtesy in general has to do with acclimating to new york life. I&#039;ve seen people, strollers and non-stroller alike, plowing out of eckerd on Ditmars without bothering to pay attention to the fact that they are coming perpendicular into traffic, and then get pissed when you crash into them.<br /><br />But I also think it should go without saying that it isn&#039;t just about rights. When you live in a highly populated community, that is exactly what it is, a community, and that community has babies, toddlers, teenagers, obnoxious yuppies talking loud on their cell phone, people who don&#039;t speak english, leering men and women, individuals with disabilities and geriatrics and individuals that have pet peeves about absolutely everything. If you can&#039;t deal with all of these things, you need to move to an area where space and sharing of space isn&#039;t a problem. It wouldn&#039;t be an eclectic community without all these groups. Here, there is a lot you sacrifice in terms of personal space, but there is a lot to gain as well. <br /><br />Astoria in particular not only has a lot of english language learners, but also a lot of new york culture learners, who I&#039;m not sure have gotten with the program. And this goes for people who come from Ohio and aren&#039;t used to people pushing in the subway as well. Its tight, its cramped, its New York, get over it. I wouldn&#039;t want to live anywhere else, so I&#039;ll give my dirty looks and move on.

				Back to the stroller discussion are we?&nbsp; I have no defense for stupid people doing stupid things like using strollers as a weapon or forcing them onto subways, but saying strollers shouldn&#039;t be on the subway during rush hours is ridiculous.&nbsp; People in two working parent homes with day care closer to work than home (like myself) have to be on the subway during rush hour.&nbsp; <br /><br />Can they be smart about it?&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Personally, I&#039;ll often let multiple trains go bye if they&#039;re crowded, so I cause less problems for other people and can get a seat.&nbsp; When I have a seat, it&#039;s easier to tend to my daughter&#039;s needs so she doesn&#039;t wail, which is also to the advantage of other passengers.&nbsp; Does the stroller fold?&nbsp; Yes, but while folding it or maneuvering it, there are much more chances for banging myself, the stroller, my bag or my daughter into other passengers and I find that to be worse.&nbsp; Plus, there is then the danger of dropping or injuring my daughter while trying to keep the stroller in one place.&nbsp; I won&#039;t put her at risk.<br /><br />In my case, my daughter is only 15 months, so she can&#039;t sit or stand by herself.&nbsp; When she&#039;s older, I&#039;d have to re-evaluate the situation.&nbsp; Kids who can walk, don&#039;t have the stamina to keep walking as long as an adult, so I can see why strollers are necessary with kids who can walk, especially if they&#039;re travelling a long distance.

				I don&#039;t understand why more New Yorkers don&#039;t use the baby slings, those backpack things that go on the front of your chest. I have to say that I am 9 times out of 10 really irritated by the stroller thing due to positioning in the subway car, not folding them up and having the kid running all over the car anyway. That kind of stuff. But I usually get in a different car if I see someone with a stroller come into the car I&#039;m in. I don&#039;t need to deal with getting my shins knocked by the kid or the stroller first thing in the morning.

				Honestly, I think that someone who&#039;s already rude and pushy will be rude and pushy after they become parents.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think that people who have children are inherently rude and pushy, much in the same way that I don&#039;t believe that people from certain cultural or linguistic backgrounds are inherently rude and pushy.&nbsp; And sometimes people complaining about other people being rude can be pretty rude themselves, too.

				Maybe I am. I&#039;m in my mid-forties. Really old. I raised a child of my own and grew up in a family where my mother was more practical than my dad (who was a hard working family man and had a really big heart)-maybe that&#039;s why I feel we are kind of the better half, so to speak, I do not advocate, however, seeking out Neanderthal type men just to fix them, but I also hate when women let themselves be led by stupid men, especially when the woman DOES know better. I think women have more influence than society gives them credit for. Sometimes we have to put our foot down and say to our husbands/boyfriends/sons: &quot;No, don&#039;t do it. It&#039;s not right&quot;, or &quot;Get up off your ass and take the garbage out!&quot;, or &quot;Be a gentleman, give the old lady a seat!&quot; or... I could go on.

				I&#039;ve never understood how any woman could say she&#039;s not a feminist. feminists did not all burn their bras, and they don&#039;t all read Ms. Magazine and complain about The Man. Maybe there is a difference between an active, vocal feminist and those who simply believe in equality.&nbsp; but given the definition of the term...<br /><br />i]<em> Feminism comprises a number of social, cultural and political movements, theories and moral philosophies <strong>concerned with gender inequalities and equal rights for women.<br /><br />feminists are really only concerned with equality. not sqaushing men -huge misconception. and a peeve of mine :)</strong></em>

				I think the reason women distant themselves from the word &quot;feminist&quot; is because of how they are potrayed. Groups and movements are always characterized with the extreme, especially in the media. This false characterization of the feminist movement results in people believing something about the movement, in this case feminism, that is completely false and therefore a stigma gets attached to feminism. It is this reason that women are most likely afraid to call themselves feminists, and the key to solving this problem would be for feminists to fight and take their movement back and get people to see it for what it really is and not the way it is potrayed by the media.

				I have spent my entire life as a Civil Rights Activist. From Mississippi to Alabama. From Washington, DC to Chicago. I&#039;ve put my life on the line when it was necessary. I&#039;ve had my skull split open by a billy club. I&#039;ve dedicated my life to marching, protesting, letter writing and what ever else was necessary to get people to understand that we are all equal regardless of race, gender or gender preferences, religion or ethnicity. My generation laid the foundation for what needs to still be accomplished. I have no regrets, except that the younger generations don&#039;t understand that their involvement is so needed to finally make the world recognize equality. I am a Board Certified Feminist.

By definition a feminist is one who supports feminism. But that is just the tip of this iceberg. Feminism is not a monolith, nor is it a dogma. The only thing you have to believe in order to call yourself a feminist is that <strong><em>ensuring women&#039;s freedom and equality of opportunity in all spheres of life is a crucial priority</em></strong>. That&#039;s it. Feminists live by example.<br /><br />Feminists all work from that basic axiom, but aside from that we are an incredibly diverse group.<br /><br />To the 3 ridiculous people who chose to negative nod the poster who asked this valid question: I reversed one of you.

There are various feminist theories which seek to understand the inequalities of women in society. One feminist might see inequality in our laws and government as a main cause of the inequalities of women (Liberal Feminism), another feminist might see gender inequalities as rooted in class differences (Marxist Feminism). There are many other types of feminism which focus on one particular area or cause of inequalities of the sexes, though these different areas can also overlap at certain points.

				Well, the PC Nazis (hopefully it&#039;s only 2 or 3 and the media is just overhyping it) have struck again. They are now trying to convince us that Santa is too obese and that he&#039;s spreading a message that is demeaning to women.<br />My new pet peeve:<br />A skinny Santa who bellows Ha!Ha!Ha!

				For a lot of people, the word &quot;Muslim&quot; conjures a radical image. That does not mean that it is accurate and should be unthinkingly embraced as the whole truth of what it means to be a Muslim. <br /><br />I think the radical image of feminism owes less to actual feminists and more to people who want to put feminists into a &quot;you crazy bitches&quot; box and ignore them. If more non-radical feminists would embrace the word, that radical image would start to lose its power. <br /><br />I agree with NYCMacUser that being a feminist means embracing women&#039;s equality and treating it as a priority. If someone does that, I would call them a feminist. And if that means that there are a lot of feminists ... I happen to think that&#039;s a great thing.

				Today I on my commute, I notice a girl was tearing up.&nbsp; It definately looked like she may have had an allergy attack of sort or contact lens irritation because she did not really seem upset.&nbsp; I have a similar condition where my eyes tear up uncontrollably, especially if its windy outside, and everyone and their dog thinks Ive been sobbing . Anyways, some guy asks her whats wrong (loud enough) and she tells him its fine, the weather is making her eyes tear up. And he kind gives a condescending &quot;Everything will be alright&quot;<br /><br />Granted he was being an oh so concerned passenger, but I have a feeling his probing kind of embarrased her because everyone was looking at her like she was nuts and she looked a bit sheepish and tried to hide after that.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was actually going to speak up for her and tell the guy she is fine, I have the same eye problem, but I didnt want to further embarrass her. I can understand when someone misreads you and thinks something is wrong with you, when actually nothing isnt. <br /><br />Why dont people just use their intuition and think &quot;well maybe that person is sick, etc...let me mind my business or if I want to help, pull out a tissue for her&quot;?&nbsp; I know the N train is the &quot;friendlier&quot; of all the trains but granted we all probably see each other on a daily basis and maybe its best that instead of embarrassing someone, just use visual cues or body language to communicate that you are concerned or want to help. <br /><br />I understand the whole MTA saying of &quot;If you see something, say something&quot; but in that type of situation, maybe a tissue or some eyedrops would have been ok. (fyi - I didnt have either on me which is why i couldnt offer them to her, but I would have)

				When looking through the restaurants and food section, seeing so many one post only members on the threads. I know it&#039;s not a big problem or anything, but it&#039;s really irritating that people make a membership just to say how great a restaurant is or how restaurant X is 90 times better than place Y.
