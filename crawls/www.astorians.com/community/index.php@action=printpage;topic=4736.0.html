				A few of us were talking and thought a mixer would be a nice thing to do soon.&nbsp; It would be good way to get to know so many of the new people here on the board.&nbsp; &nbsp;So, I am suggesting we get together sometime in Feb (or even late January) for a social gathering/mixer at Rapture (28th Ave and 35th Street), on a weekday night, somewhere around 7-8pm.&nbsp; A bit of a cheesy place, I know, but I have fond memories of the last astorians event I attended there.&nbsp; They have nice couches, drinks, and some food.&nbsp; I think it could be a good thing.<br /><br />Is anyone interested?

				Also a newbie - I&#39;d love to come along to a mixer, and pretty much anytime after the 23rd is fine with me!

				OK, the next Astorians mixer will be Thursday, February 1 at Rapture (28th Avenue and 35th Street).&nbsp; Start time is 7:30, but just show up any time after that.&nbsp; There is no end time to the event, we&#39;ll just see what happenes.&nbsp; According to the Rapture website, Thursdays has domestic beer specials of $3 all night long. <br /><br />Feel free to chime in here if you are coming.<br /><br />http://www.rapturelounge.com/index2.html

				Hmm.&nbsp; I&#39;m not so sure I like the idea of color coded relationship-status name tags.&nbsp; I figure, if a couple of single people happen to talk and click, cool.&nbsp; But I am more interested in just going to hang out with people and meet new people.&nbsp; And I don&#39;t know that everyone on here is interested in letting their relationship status be broadcast to the entire community.&nbsp; If we want to have a specific singles event, I think that&#39;s a good idea.&nbsp; But I&#39;m not too big into turning a casual get together into a singles event, which I think the name tags would do.

				Well, I am home after 3 hours of fun (I got there a little early), and so glad I went!&nbsp; Nice to meet a bunch of new astorians, see old friends, and see some people I haven&#39;t seen in months!&nbsp; I understand that Thursday nights at Rapture are never this busy, so I hope they were happy to see so many people enjoying the food and drink.&nbsp; <br /><br />Awesome stickers, flooz!&nbsp; :D<br /><br />I think this mixer/gathering was a real success, and I hope the next one - probably a singles mixer - will be just as fun!

Josh being the biggest fraud of the night.&nbsp; Meaning he did not look like his picture or his Arabic sounding name as he spelled it out recently. <br /><br />Did meet lots of cool new folks such as:<br />Melee from Melbourne. She of paleontology and funky cool hair. Cool and maybe more crazy fun then she lets on.<br />Uzumaki, way too freakin&#39; sweet and nice.&nbsp; <br />Adam &amp; Elena, good to see you tonight.&nbsp; Congrats.<br /><br />And for all the rest of you that i&#39;ve met over the past year or so, thanks for making Astoria home.

				Sounds like you guys had a ton of fun - sorry I missed out! I was at work til late, then had to go home and pack.<br /><br />Should maybe these things be monthly? Kinda like we approach the EATS events? There&#39;s always so much positive feedback afterwards.

				It was great fun, and great to meet some of the new people... a more open space might be better. LIC Bar is great, but maybe a bit far?<br />

				Just an update on &quot;Candle Cafe,&quot; that I mentioned in a previous post. Actual name is Candlelight Cafe: looked smallish and dark, but I did see another place that looked much hipper. They&#39;re very new, only 3 weeks old, &quot;Time Out&quot; cafe on 45th street and Broadway and pretty reasonable for drinks. They don&#39;t have a happy hour or food yet, but they do have a kitchen and once licenses/permits are there, will offer even more, like brunch. Could definitely accomodate the size we had last time. This place looks very promising.
