				What&#39;s the single best fish dish you have ever had at a restaurant in New York?&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure how I would answer this myself - I remember thinking that Milos Estiatorio (Greek, midtown) was incredible, but I went there so long ago I don&#39;t even remember what I had.&nbsp; The tastiest fish experience in recent memory may very well have been the devilled (grilled) kingfish at Sigiri, a Sri Lankan restaurant in the East Village.&nbsp; The fish was grilled with a sweet (almost barbecue-esque) but HOT sauce (we ordered mild, and it was the hottest mild I&#39;d ever had - my wife and I were sweating, and we&#39;re used to spicy food; I can&#39;t even imagine what &quot;spicy&quot; at Sigiri would entail). The fish is cut into pieces and tossed with grilled onions and tomatoes.&nbsp; Niiiice (in Borat accent).<br /><br />And no, I don&#39;t want to hear about salmon poached in the dishwasher.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I had a kickin&#39; tuna melt at the Acropolis Diner in Poughkeepsie.&nbsp; MMM.... actually, I had it a lot of times while in college during the early 90&#39;s.&nbsp; It was called the &quot;Happy Waitress&quot;.&nbsp; (sigh) Good times... good freakin&#39; times.<br /><br /><br />Oh wait... did you mean New York City?

				The problem is, I can&#39;t really decide.&nbsp; Part of wants me to say the matjes herring at Aquavit (which you can also get in the cafe at lunch for quite a reasonable price), but I can also quote myself from a couple of years ago, also from the bite tasting menu at Aquavit:<br /><br /><em>Sautéed halibut served with seafood (including scallop) sausage with marjoram and bacon topped with sautéed nettles; yellow pea puree and raisin-red wine sauce. The sautéed halibut was possibly the best fish I have ever tasted. The top of it was deeply seared, and I swear it tasted like a French fry. The seared part was perfectly golden brown, and then the rest was just perfectly cooked – the exact instant of being cooked. Buttery, meltingly tender and rich. The sausage was almost a mousse – or mousseline. Wasn’t too sure about the nettles.</em><br /><br />I know both of those are Aquavit, and I&#39;ve had incredible fish other places, too.&nbsp; I&#39;ll be back.<br /><br />Ok, that didn&#39;t take long.&nbsp; Right now, my favourite sushi is at Sushi Seki -1st Ave. between 62nd and 63rd.&nbsp; Recently, I said:<br /><br /><em>Everything - the rice, the fish, the garnishes, the wasabi - was harmonised in a way that had never occurred to me.&nbsp; The mackerel and hamachi were both exemplary -- the mackerel had its typical deep savoury flavour that only lasts while the fish is very fresh, and the hamachi was perfectly presented, tender and flavourful.&nbsp; I couldn&#39;t believe the umeshisu roll [ok, no fish in that one].&nbsp; It&#39;s usually a pungently sour in a way I find very attractive - it&#39;s almost a palate cleanser.&nbsp; This one was different.&nbsp; Oh, it still had the same flavours, but there was a deepness and smokiness I had never tasted - and somehow, the flavours just blended together, nothing standing out, it was fantastic.&nbsp; It was definitely partly the rice, which was perfectly balanced.</em><br /><br />Hmm, also the salmon at Lil Bistro 33, for which we all must wait for the reopening on Ditmars.&nbsp; That make me happy.
