				I love soccer, and I think a lot of people in our neighborhood do.&nbsp; So from my perspective a pitch would be good. Also, people don&#039;t care at all about the rules posted outside of the track, so perhaps it makes sense to change the default usage of the field.<br /><br />I hope they can find a way to still allow runners to use the track to some degree however. A high fence around the soccer pitch for one, and then big signs with emphasized rules for behavior. As it stands running at the track is incredibly annoying at times because of all the people who have zero respect for runners, and I for one would fear that without a high fence and more soccer balls using the track would get even more difficult.<br /><br />I&#039;d rather have seen a pitch elsewhere to be honest. Come to think of it, I think there are a few pitches in the area already, so not sure why they can&#039;t be used. At least one up by the power plant, and I think one along the water, south of the park.

A lot of people are thoughtless, dumb and/or inconsiderate, and the one thing that track needs is some order. Not sure why the park is the priority though. <br /><br />- There&#039;s the field by Hazen and 19th, which has like 7 baseball pitches on it (although they overlap). That could be converted.<br />- There&#039;s the baseball field AND what looks like a soccer field on 20th Ave / 33rd street. <br />- There&#039;s the Hellgate baseball field at Hallets.<br /><br />But from what I can see there are zero true &quot;track-and-fields&quot; where one <em>could</em> do any of the traditional sports that it involves. Of course some will argue that it&#039;s better to accommodate 30 soccer players rather than 3 doing discus, 3 javelin, 3 long jump and 3 whatever..... but we could use the same argument for the Tennis courts.

				<span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font">Say goodbye forever to a nice quiet jog and workout at the track. </span><br /><br /><br />I remember as a kid in the early 70&#039;s watching baseball, softball games in the grassy area. I also remember in the 80&#039;s jogging on the dirt track and dodging soccer balls and stampeding soccer players. Later there was a time in the 90&#039;s when the field house supervisor-a young guy named John who oversaw the tennis courts-ran a tight ship and enforced the rules. No sneaking on the tennis courts without a permit; you had to sign up for a court at the designated time, no ball playing in the grassy area, no bicycles on the track, etc... Anyone notice how the grassy area has been ravaged ad turned into a dust bowl? I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if the parks dept. is intentionally letting it fall to ruin. <br /><br /><br />In the summer it&#039;s always nice to see neighborhood children taking part in organized track and field activities on the weekday mornings. The FIFA-sized pitch will put an end to that. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Cassie I was joking about the bridle path. Problem is everyone feels entitled to something. Nobody considers what is reasonable and sane for the surrounding community. The park is too small for a soccer field. It has fallen victim to the overcrowding and overdevelopment of Astoria and the politicos only care about pandering to their constituents for votes.

				I was going to suggest Rainey Park as well. They have a dilapidated baseball field, and a neglected basketball court. Millions was spent to add a bike path and some seating, and then nothing to maintain it in the past few years. That being said, there&#039;s plenty of space for a soccer field- and it wouldn&#039;t interfere with people who want to run on the track. Think it would be a great way to revitalize that park, and frankly, with the huge towers being built to the left, there is the potential for an influx of people (and people with money) going to that park.

It&#039;s not some grassy stretch for rollicking and picnics. Why should field events activities and training be sacrificed for a soccer field? With that logic, why not ask basketball players to sacrifice the courts for shared use?<br /><br />I have a counter proposal -- replace the parking lot with a soccer field or fields. There&#039;s more than enough space. I&#039;d be on-board with that.

				That&#039;s just bizarre-- when have you ever seen people using the inside of the track for activities other than soccer/frisbee for the hipsters?

				Why bizarre? <br /><br />There were once softball fields in the center of the track that fell into disuse. When the track was refurbished, the fields were replaced by athletics facilities, which unfortunately also have been allowed to get run down.<br /><br />My main concern is that the track is well used and adding a soccer field would disrupt this, but since I haven&#039;t seen the plan I reserve judgement. The devil is in the details. If a soccer field is added I hope money is allotted for its upkeep.

				Why not make expand the track and include the soccer field? All of the other options that were previously stated aren&#039;t technically government owned: ICYP owns the softball fields, Con Ed owns the soccer fields, Elmjack owns the baseball fields.<br /><br /><br />Having a public park with a recreational-- but standard sized-- soccer field with a track on the outside perimeter (possibly now 1/2 mile from the 1/4 mile) would provide instant entertainment and exercise for kids and adults in the neighborhood.

				Who cares if the track is bigger? As someone who has used the track for years I believe there&#039;s plenty of room for joggers and walkers. I think you&#039;re just interested in making the inner field larger for a larger soccer field. In order to make the track bigger trees would have to be ripped out and the light poles removed and relocated. How about doling out some money to upgrade the tennis courts? $200 permits will get you ripped nets and courts with potholes.

Of course, the field is pretty much useless for its intended purpose, because of how people behave. Just like the playground for kids there are signs for what we&#039;re allowed to do, or rather, what we&#039;re not supposed to do. That includes everything from amplifying music to playing with balls to riding vehicles... and more... all broken by people who don&#039;t care. So, my point is that if anyone actually wanted to do serious running they&#039;re pretty much either in for a double-workout or have to choose hours where egotistic or clueless people aren&#039;t a hindrance, and anyone who wanted to do anything related to the actual &quot;&amp; field&quot; portion of &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot; pretty much can&#039;t do it at all, because the sandbox is populated by children playing and the infield has everything from crossfitters to frisbee-ers to soccer players. <br /><br />Making it a &quot;real soccer pitch&quot; would just make it worse for runners. By far.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=39144.msg255397.html#msg255397">Quote from: cat_gio on April 22, 2016, 09:15:40 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Tracks have standard sizes but so do soccer fields-- so why not make both parties happy? </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think most tracks are 400 meters.

The only reason it&#039;s crap is because people do things on it they&#039;re not supposed to. I couldn&#039;t care less that a soccer player sprains an ankle playing on a field he&#039;s not supposed to play on. And that&#039;s coming from someone who LOVES soccer (me). <br /><br />One can also lay down a new surface on the track without creating a soccer pitch.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=39144.msg255397.html#msg255397">Quote from: cat_gio on April 22, 2016, 09:15:40 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It seems like the common sense way to go, adding something that users of the track as well as users of the inside can both benefit from.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m telling you, runners will suffer from it.<br /><br />In addition to all of that Johnny is spot-on. Go to the track (I just ran past it) and look at the size of the field, and then the size of the surrounding area. On the west side you have a steep drop, on the east side you have a building, on the south side you have a less steep drop, but nevertheless a drop, and north of it a parking lot. If you could ever find the money for such a thing, what are you going to sacrifice? The parking lot? hardly. The building? Probably not. So that leaves only two sides to change in order to fit a pitch and an 800 meter track. So, imagine that track being twice as long by extending the track to the south and to the west. I have a hard time seeing there&#039;s enough space, and the expense of getting rid of the trees and then filling with soil/foundation......<br /><br />It&#039;s just not going to happen....

Changing the size beyond the 400 m/y is something that would throw a lot of people off - walkers and runners. They know the size and can determine their workout accordingly, whether they are doing short distances, long distances, sprints/drills, etc. A &quot;custom&quot; length track or pool automatically lowers the perceived quality of the space. Whoever is saying &quot;size doesn&#039;t matter&quot; when it comes to a track is uninformed at best and dismissive at worst. <br /><br /><br />Many more people will use the track vs the soccer field. It&#039;s a huge draw in Astoria Park. I think it should stay as-is, except for a refinish on is surface.

A lot of people are thoughtless, dumb and/or inconsiderate, and the one thing that track needs is some order. Not sure why the park is the priority though. <br /><br />- There&#039;s the field by Hazen and 19th, which has like 7 baseball pitches on it (although they overlap). That could be converted.<br />- There&#039;s the baseball field AND what looks like a soccer field on 20th Ave / 33rd street. <br />- There&#039;s the Hellgate baseball field at Hallets.<br /><br />But from what I can see there are zero true &quot;track-and-fields&quot; where one <em>could</em> do any of the traditional sports that it involves. Of course some will argue that it&#039;s better to accommodate 30 soccer players rather than 3 doing discus, 3 javelin, 3 long jump and 3 whatever..... but we could use the same argument for the Tennis courts.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />The first two are private little leagues - Elmjack and ICYP. That&#039;s not public land so there&#039;s no need to consider them for anything.<br />The last one is used by a softball league that plays nearly year round, so you are suggesting converting something that is already well utilized.<br /><br />

				Fine by me. Don&#039;t &quot;develop&quot; any of it. Just keep up the track/field and enforce the rules (just broke a rib laughing).
