			The people upstairs from me in the house I live in are moving out, and the landlord will be looking for people (no children, no dogs) to fill the apartment.&nbsp; It&#39;s huge- hardwood floors, 3 bedrooms, two AC units attached, access to a backyard with a small terrace.&nbsp; $2400 a month including gas.&nbsp; Astoria Blvd &amp; Steinway St.&nbsp; It&#39;s not even officially on the market yet, but if you&#39;re interested, hit me up via PM and I can hook you up- I want nice neighbors (with quiet feet!&nbsp; Please, I have to live down here!)

			Hi there...<br /><br />I&#39;m interested. I&#39;ve been thinking about getting an additional roommate to get a bigger place. We&#39;re very nice folks, with very quiet feet. Two of us are non-profit professionals, the other roommate probably too. <br /><br />My name is Jonathan. Any chance I could check out the place?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />J
