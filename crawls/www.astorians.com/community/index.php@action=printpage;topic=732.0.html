				From 9/11/01 on, people have called the terrorist hijackers cowardly. &nbsp;A very odd word IMO for people who completely cast aside their instinct for self-preservation. &nbsp;But to think that the word fits is a kind of orthodoxy. &nbsp;Bill Maher paid for challenging the word; William Safire didn't, but his conservative credentials were impeccable.<br /><br />Today I worshipped at a church in Manhattan, and the pastor spoke of the &quot;cowardly attack.&quot; &nbsp;I told her I thought &quot;cowardly&quot; was the wrong word for people who act in the face of certain death, and she said that maybe in that sense they weren't cowardly. &nbsp;But I didn't have the presence of mind to ask her in what sense they were cowardly.<br /><br />Now we sometimes say of people who kill themselves out of despair that they are cowards because they won't face life, but Islamist suicide bombers are not like that. &nbsp;Terrorist organizations reject depressed people who are trying to end an unbearable life.<br /><br />Furthermore, &quot;cowardly&quot; seems to be a term reserved for the criminal rabble; we never hear a gangland murder called a cowardly attack.<br /><br />So what do you think? &nbsp;In what sense were the 9/11 attackers cowards?

				I agree with you in the sense that &quot;coward&quot; is probably not the best word to use to describe a terrorist.<br /><br />I think the closest way you could relate the word &quot;cowardly&quot; to what happened on 9/11 was simply the fact that they chose to kill innocent people who were defensless against them.<br /><br />According to western concepts of fighting, warriors are supposed to abide by certain rules (even &quot;respect&quot; each other). So in this sense, the idea that these people have a beef with the United States Government, and choose to take out their anger on &quot;innocent&quot; people could be seen as cowardly. The &quot;rules&quot; say that you have to fight someone your own size - this mentality is widespread.<br /><br />Of course it totally depends on your mindset. I personally know people who, if an angel of light appeared in their bedroom and told them to kill someone would do it without quesitoning. I even know a few Christians that seem to think it's ok to do a certain amount of killing if the result is an increase of the spreading of the &quot;Gospel&quot;. I also know a few capitalists, liberals, conservatives, environmentalists who feel the same way. These people could also be labeled as cowards, however I'm sure there's a solid argument out there that would label these people as honorable, or even heroes (depending on the paradigm you argue from). <br /><br />It seems to me that extremism is not something that's limited to Islam or Christianity (or religion at all), but sadly pervades every aspect of our culture. <br /><br />I think that calling someone a &quot;coward&quot; maybe is just a way for people to &quot;retaliate&quot; without trying to understand their enemy. I also think that if one could really see all this from &quot;God's&quot; perspective, one might find that we're all not that different from each other (globally speaking) after all.

				If the church bulletin listed a Website or e-mail address I would e-mail the pastor and ask <em>her</em> in what sense she thought the word was appropriate. &nbsp;As it is, I'm trying to fathom why those who do think the word is appropriate think it's appropriate.<br /><br />Right now, I can think only of two reasons:<br /><br />1. The word is undergoing a semantic drift akin to &quot;dastardly&quot; before it. &nbsp;&quot;Dastardly&quot; once meant &quot;cowardly&quot; but now means contemptible, as well as &quot;criminal, vicious, brutal, cruel, inhumane, and completely f---ed up.&quot; &nbsp;But people have forgotten what &quot;dastardly&quot; once meant because no one is called a dastard anymore. &nbsp;The only place I ever saw that word was in Scott's poem &quot;Lochinvar,&quot; in which Ellen was about to marry &quot;a dastard in war.&quot; &nbsp;OTOH everyone knows what a coward is, and I've never heard the hijackers referred to as cowards.<br /><br />2. Other crimes, such as the embassy bombings in Africa, were called cowardly, so it seems consistent to apply the word to an even more heinous act of terrorism.<br /><br />But this pastor is very thoughtful and very precise in her choice of words. &nbsp;She never uses a word in her preaching that she doesn't mean.<br /><br />The &quot;pick on somebody your own size&quot; argument is very plausible. &nbsp;In _The Wonderful Wizard of Oz_ the Cowardly Lion was called a coward precisely because he picked on Toto. &nbsp;OTOH it seems that only acts of terrorism are called cowardly. &nbsp;Child abuse is not called cowardly, nor is union-busting violence. &nbsp;Even rabid prolifers don't call abortion cowardly. &nbsp;Further back in history, the massacre at My Lai was roundly condemned but it wasn't called cowardly.<br /><br />And so, back to bed.[/i]

				I think, in the minds of the attackers, (not that I ever spoken with them) it was an act of desperation. People, I think, call this act cowardly because they want to dehumanize the attackers, for better or worse. <br /><br />It was fucked up, and so is what this country is/has done.

I'm saying that, however distorted their view may have been, I think that thier mindset was that this is what they needed to do do survive.

				<strong>iLoveCheese</strong>, I'm not calling on you to defend yourself vis-a-vis 9/11. And you don't know to what extent I was disgusted by what happened because I haven't said so.<br /><br />But back to topic, calling it a desperate act (no matter whatever these reports say) is incorrect.<br /><br />&quot;Desperation&quot; implies that the perpetrators were left with, or could not see, any alternative. Not true. This was not some sort of last resort after all other options were exhausted. This was a deliberate hostile act, just a part of a 20-year war they've been waging against their enemies.<br /><br />These are not desperate people who don't know any better. They are committed, determined and extremely dangerous. Let's at least give them the benefit of calling them adversaries, not some victimized group.<br /><br />If the 9/11 planners thought up the idea 20 years ago of crashing jet liners into buildings they would have done it then.<br /><br />You could also argue that the entire War on Terror is a desperate act in that the United States had no option but to resort to military action to prevent future terrorist strikes. After all, it's what this country needed to do to survive as well, right?

He's considered to be the 'brains' behind the Al Qaeda movement (whereas Bin Laden is more of a spiritual leader and financial backer). He belonged to a radical organization in Egypt that, among other things, was behind the assassination of Anwar Sadat in 1981. Zawahiri was arrested and tortured after the assassination. Ask any psychologist, and they'll say that untreated, a torture victim will exhibit obsessions with revenge and violence, and will suffer from paranoia. Apparently it stems from the need to reassert domination and control.<br /><br />So, do we blame the Egyptian government? Or the Saudi government for say, the rise of Bin Laden? Maybe. That still doesn't exculpate our good doctor. My point is, some say what Al Qaeda is really attacking is the corruption and rot and opression in their own societies. We're just the target of their displaced aggression. Possibly. I think it's that and more -- they ultimately are the vicious howl of the medieval mind.<br /><br />Let's keep in mind that they have gone on record about advocating the restoration of the old Islamic Caliphate of the 7th Century. The <em>7th Century</em>. And they also advocate theological puritanism along the lines of the Wahabi sect of Islam.<br /><br />To me, this is more than a grudge match against Bush, or globalization, or Israel. I believe theirs is a war against humanity. Unfortunately, ours is of contrived politics.<br /><br />Richard Holbrooke (admittedly, not one of my faves) had an excellent op-ed in the New York Sun yesterday about this Administration's misguided policies. This link (http://www.nysun.com/article/19906) only lets you see the intro paragraphs, unfortunately... He advocated boosting our public diplomacy, and expanding our notion of the 'war' as a war of ideas.<br /><br />Anyway, while I believe these practitioners of terrorism act out of fear and loathing, they're certainly not cowards, nor should ever be considered as such.

				No doubt we've been a target before 9/11/01, but Bush invaded Iraq. The terrorist haven abounding there can thus be ascribed to him.<br /><br />Have you traveled abraod lately?

Bush is guilty of opening an unwanted and IMO dangerous second front. Also, most of the terror attacks since the aborted Fallujah assault have mostly been against Iraqis, civilians and police.<br /><br />We're seeing this is rapidly evolving into an Iraqi civil war between Shia and Sunni; Al-Zarqawi and his group are trying to exploit it to their advantage: keep US forces pinned down, destabilize the country, and kill a few Americans in the process. I believe that the Iraqis are getting fed up with having these foreign fighters in their midst -- they just want to get on with their lives. The key will be if more and more Iraqi public support turns against them. Then again, we've seen how a small, organized, heavily armed and violent group can cower entire countries.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Have you traveled abraod lately?

Have you met every American who's traveled abroad? Have you met every non-US citizen? I agree that Bush isn't very good about playing nice with other countries, and his polices seem to reinforce many sterotypes foreigners have about America. However, this sense that 'everybody hates the U.S.' is a misconception.<br /><br />As for travelilng abroad, I used to live abroad -- granted before 9/11. However, I know many non-US citizens and some of them are IMO overly critical of this country, others are more supportive. And I know of some who actually support the war in Iraq, which I don't. Don't let the propaganda fool you -- not 'everybody' hates America.<br /><br />Bush is a lousy leader, a poor commander-in-chief, and no friend to civil liberties. But to me he's the least of my worries. Those guys beheading civilians, blowing up buses and trains, and trying to acquire WMDs are far more frightening.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It's true terrorist groups often have wealthy backers, but those wealthy backers aren't the desperate ones.

He sees it as a form of maniupulation -- common to most radical movements -- whereby the powers-that-be in Al Qaeda-afilliates (and it is more like a franchise than a unified group) are very skilled in getting others to do their dirty work. (I wish I still had the article... it was really good.)<br /><br />As far as class conflict, I believe it's much deeper than that.<br /><br />To me, the fallacy lies in the presumption that Allah (or whatever Supreme Deity) can be insulted, disrespected or otherwise injured. We're talking God, The Big Guy, here. Immutable, immovable, invincible. So someone pees on a Quran. A Jew tips his hat in Jerusalem. &quot;Infidel&quot; soldiers are treading on the sacred sand of Arabia. So what? Is God writhing in pain over this? Does it mess up his x-ray vision? Give him cold sores? What?<br /><br />It's the ego of the self-rightous, those who presume to know what essentially is good for God. What arrogance bordering on blasphemy! And yes, Christians and Jews and whomever have been guilty of this violence-cum-theosophic hubris before, but why has it become such a powerful force and a casus belli in Muslim communities over the past 80 years? Where are the cooler heads and moderate voices in the Islamic world?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">At any rate, I just can't understand why you think that anyone would simply want to attack other people if they didn't consider thier own situation desperate.

Maybe this Caliphate chauvinism is merely the justfication in order to recruit people to the cause. I wouldn't classify every single Al Qaeda operator as evil, but I don't think that notion should be dismissed out of hand. For instance, the man behind the abduction and beheading of Daniel Pearl (I forget his name) was evil. I think Al Zaqarwi is evil. Maybe Bin Laden, too, in a fanatical Hitler-esque kind of way.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">So, the real question I was driving at to begin with, is does a desparate act fall into the category of &quot;cowardly&quot;?
