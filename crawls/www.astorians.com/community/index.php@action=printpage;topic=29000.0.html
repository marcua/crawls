				There is an article today on the Gothamist site of photos of the outer boroughs during the 1990s. Among them is a photo of the Astoria line, which was probably still called the RR line. The photo is of the Broadway Station, on the Ditmars bound side, looking towards 30th Avenue.&nbsp; Notice the older trains, which were previously used on the 7 Flushing line. In the near distance on the right is the building (31-21?)&nbsp; that had the large ad on it&#039;s right side for the now defunct Rocco Movers business which I used to see every day for decades as the train passed by. <br /><br />http://gothamist.com/2015/03/25/outer_boroughs_90s_nyc.php#photo-3 (http://gothamist.com/2015/03/25/outer_boroughs_90s_nyc.php#photo-3)<br /><br />Just a little trip down memory lane for you older Astoria residents.

				Funny I just posted that picture in a new thread before seeing this one.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think those cars were used on the Flushing line because the cars on the Flushing line are too narrow for the Astoria BMT line (the cars for the lettered lines cannot fit on the numbered lines, and while the cars on the numbered lines can ride on the lettered lines, they are too narrow and cannot be used to pick up passengers due to the large gap between the train and the platform).&nbsp; It looks like an R-32 maybe?

				I believe you&#039;re both right. The old trains had the same design on the outside, they they were different sizes due to the tracks they run on.

				The outside designs were very different between the R-32 car pictured there and the R-27 and prior car designs that ran on the other lines<br /><br /><br />For one, the R-32 cars were stainless steel and had corrugated panels on the outside, both designed to discourage vandalism. Older car designs were painted carbon-steel flat panels.
