				Hello all,<br /><br />I know there have been other threads regarding salons but I&#039;ve already tried a few in Astoria and haven&#039;t been satisfied yet.&nbsp; I would like to find a stylist who knows what will work best for my hair.&nbsp; I would love to hear some suggestions and I will happily go into the city for a haircut if you know of a good stylist.&nbsp; I would like to keep the price under $100.<br /><br />Thanks, everyone!

				I LOVE <strong>Studio 31</strong> on 31st Ave. btw 32nd and 33rd streets.&nbsp; My stylist, Athena, is the former owner (and landlord of the building), but still does business there on Thursday, Friday and Saturday (and maybe Sunday too, I forget).&nbsp; She&#039;s the first stylist that I&#039;ve stuck with.&nbsp; And she&#039;s very reasonable as well (around $30 for my medium length hair).&nbsp;

				I still recommend SPAce too, though it can be pricey if you get dye, cut and blow dry- but its still my fav in astoria. I also tried GIGI&#039;s on 30th Ave but did not like the attitude in there or the prices.

				Have you tried Salon Space on Ditmars? I adore it there! Edna is my hairdresser and she is fabulous! She actually listens when you say how much you want cut. I had another hair dresser at a different salon ruin my haircut, I went to Edna and she fixed it perfectly! Plus, a hair cut and blow out is about $45! I used to have really really long hair, past my chest, and a hair cut and full highlights was under $100! <br /><br /># is 718-726-3911

				The stylists at Space don&#039;t know how to cut curls.&nbsp; Saloon has a sign out front (or they used to) that basically says they&#039;ll FIX your curls (by straightening your hair).&nbsp; I think it&#039;s unfortunate for curly tops that curly hair isn&#039;t &quot;IN.&quot;&nbsp; But I would love a salon around here that knows how to deal with curly hair.&nbsp; I go to Devachan in the city - and plunk down around $85/cut + tip and products.... ugh.&nbsp; Which is why i only treat myself 2x a year. <br /><br />

I have very curly hair and Edna at Space always does a great job with my hair. I had my hair cut at Ouidad, the fancy curly hair salon in the city, by Ouidad herself... just to see what the difference was. The difference was an overpaid hair cut! Edna at Space does a way better job on my curly hair--which is totally un-conformed and has a mind of its own!

				I went to Saloon today (30th ave and 36th st) and got my hair cut with Frank. I&#039;m a guy so it didn&#039;t cost me nearly as much as it might for other people, but he did a great job and was really friendly. And he gave me a bit of a discount &#039;cause I&#039;m a member here. So thumbs up to Saloon!

				My husband and I just tried out Saloon. It was very reasonable ($70ish) for a men&#039;s and women&#039;s cut. Helen did an awesome job on my husband&#039;s hair: He often has to tell stylists to give him a little boy hair cut just so they don&#039;t mess it up. I sat with Stacy and my hair looks better than it has in months. I definitely recommend Saloon!

				I want to spend between $25 and $35 for a haircut. Please tell me this is not impossible. (And I don&#039;t want to go to Giorgio&#039;s.)&nbsp; I&#039;ve given up on Astoria since I can&#039;t find one without attitude or price. (Last time I went I had a specific appointment time and I waited 30 minutes before I was seated and then only when they were ready to go with me, they asked if I needed a wash by a girl who just sat there reading a magazine while I waited. WTF!!!?) I&#039;m willing to travel to the Village/elsewhere. Where do you go that you&#039;re consistently happy with?

				I don&#039;t either. I pay $130 in the city and I&#039;ve been with my stylist for 10+ years. <br /><br />I think the only way to get a price like that is at some of the salons<br />in Manhattan that offer student cuts on certain evenings. I know that Aveda, Bumble + Bumble,<br />and Ted Gibson have student nights. Usually a senior stylist will supervise a junior or apprentice<br />and the fee is a lot lower. However, sometimes the catch is that you have to be willing to do <br />what they want. For instance, if the apprentice is training in how to do a short, layered style, that&#039;s<br />what you&#039;ll get. <br /><br /><br />Here&#039;s a link from CitySearch.com for affordable cuts in the New York area:<br />http://newyork.citysearch.com/bestof/winners/affordable_haircut<br />

				Has anyone ever tried the Beauty School on Broadway and Steinway? I&#039;ve never tried it but I used to go to a training salon all the time (not in NY) but usually the students already had years of experience and were training up for a higher level salon. <br /><br />I always figure that if a student messes up, an instructor will come over and fix it.&nbsp; However - I hesitate b/c my idea of beauty doesn&#039;t seem to be the standard QUEENS idea of beauty.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				I got a really good cut (with wash and blow dry) for $40 at Studio 34 on 34th ave btwn 42nd and 43rd. Mila (i think that was her name) was really nice, talked to me about some options and didn&#039;t pooh pooh my idea of having all over layers (though I am saving that for my next trip-putting my hair up with no layers in the summer is much easier). They&#039;re really small and only have a few folks. I went in with no appointment and basically just had to wait until she or the other guy were done with their current cuts. About 15-20 minutes. Not bad. Best part-didn&#039;t try to upsell me or sell me overpriced product. I hate that! And they didn&#039;t charge extra for a blow dry. Via Decour down the street wanted to charge me an extra 30 to dry my hair on top of the 30 for the cut. Eff that!<br />Oh only con, is they don&#039;t take credit. But they&#039;re fine with you running to the shop on the corner to use the atm there and come back.

				Lanseaux, the SPAce website lists their cut/style at $40, do you think you get that price because you&#039;ve been going for a while? Anyone in particular that you stick to?

				I recently went to SPAce for the first time.&nbsp; I called on a Friday and was able to come in the same day.&nbsp; I did it pretty blindly because I was desperate.&nbsp; I was scheduled with Manny, and when I got in he was styling an older woman&#039;s hair (the short, poofy style popular with older senior citizens) and I felt uneasy since I was asking for a very young and untraditional cut.<br /><br />Anywho I went ahead with it, and he made my hair look super duper freaking awesome.&nbsp; I was so incredibly happy with my cut, and its been over a month and it still looks great.&nbsp; I paid $35 for just the cut- since I live down the block and I normally restyle myself I skipped on the blowdry-it was a bit pricey for that add-on.<br /><br />They were also really nice at SPAce.&nbsp; I&#039;ll definitely go back- perhaps even for my wedding.<br /><br />eta: my hair is shoulder length, pretty thick, and very wavy.<br />

				I have long thick wavy hair and just got my haircut with stacy who colored- highlighted and cut my hair. She did an amazing job I highly recommend her. She is very friendly and listens to what you want. You also get an astorians discount with her too! I love my new &#039;do&#039;!

				I&#039;ve seen all the above recs and wondering which ones are good for edgy short hairstyles for thicker hair. If its not cut right, the hair is always too thick at the bottom and looks really ridiculous on a short haircut or look very senior citizen. I&#039;m so sick of getting a terrible cut and paying so much money for it. I&#039;ve gone to a few of the places above and was very dissapointed.

				I went to Saloon this past week and was pretty disappointed in the whole experience I had with Selvi....1st the cut was $80. And I&#039;ve been to Saloon before and paid like $50 and received a much better cut. I guess you would consider my hair long but still $80 in Astoria is alittle high. 2nd, I feel she would not listen to what I wanted. I wanted like 2-3 inches off...it&#039;s been like 4-5 months since my last cut and I wanted some length cut off. She insisted that it wasn&#039;t the length that was unhealthy it was the hair that was exposed in the sun....ok yes I&nbsp; agree with the sun exposure but I wanted some length off. 3rd she cut my hair dry...I just don&#039;t like that. 4th it&#039;s been like 2 days and I feel like I need another cut but after spending about $100 I can&#039;t really afford it. <br /><br />I would go back to Saloon but I would not recommend Selvi.

				I&#039;ve been going to SPAce for over a year now and I get my hair cut by Nicki who does an amazing job with my short hair.&nbsp; The first time I went to her she listened carefully and gave me a fantastic short cut (I previously had long hair) that grows out nicely so I don&#039;t have to go every 4 weeks like the last time I had short hair.&nbsp;

				I was just about to post about my great experience a couple weeks back at Saloon. This was my first time getting my hair cut in Astoria because I&#039;ve had so many bad haircuts that I just kept going back to the salon I like back at home in Connecticut. Anyway, so I called Saloon in desperation because it was a really hot day and my hair had gotten really long, and they scheduled me that afternoon with Alyssa. I love the cut she gave me. She frowned upon my self-dyed hair and told me I should get my hair cut more often (which I agree with, but that doesn&#039;t mean I will), but I&#039;ve never gotten so many compliments on my hair as I have since getting this cut. My hair is very fine, curly and wavy, and it&#039;s just hard to get it to look good. With this cut I can just put some of my usual hair crap in it and it air dries with a nice shape. And it only cost $36. I was told over the phone that it would cost $45 and up for a cut and blow dry, but I opted for no blow dry, and so yeah. Very happy and will go back. Thanks Marlena/MFells for the recommendation!

				I would greatly recommend Shear Bliss Hair Salon in Manhattan and ask for Lace. I have been going to this salon for years. It is located on 3rd Avenue between<br />28th and 29th Street in Manhattan. She does it all! Her specialty is hair color; highlights, lowlights, full color and touch ups. She gives fantastic haircuts<br />and even does the new Japanese hair straightening. She has tons of experience and most importantly LISTENS to you. She is very pleasant, and I would follow<br />her to the end of the earth to get my hair done. It is SO hard to find an excellent hairdresser. As I read some of you are in theater; I am as well and my appearance is extremely important in my profession. I have full confidence in Lace and I suggest that you give her a try. Her prices are reasonable, even for<br />Manhattan, and the quality of her work is unsurpassed.

				RE: Locks of Love<br /><br />They have a website that you can check out. There are certain guidelines you have to follow, info on<br />volunteering, etc. that are on the site. No listing for salons, but they have a phone number on the site<br />that you can call. They&#039;re located in Florida.<br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br />
