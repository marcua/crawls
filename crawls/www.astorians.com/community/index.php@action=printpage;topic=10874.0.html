				I am inviting all Astorians to visit my Delphi forum, Wake Up Little Sushi. &nbsp;<br /><br />http://forums.delphiforums.com/wakeupsushi/start (http://forums.delphiforums.com/wakeupsushi/start)<br /><br />Wake Up Little Sushi is a forum that poses the question &quot;Why is it so hard to change?&quot;. &nbsp;It is a place where people can talk about their on-going struggle to change some aspect of their lives that they don&#039;t like.<br /><br />I used to wonder why nothing in my life was going right. &nbsp;I thought about it for years and noticed that lack of sleep was a major component in every other aspect of my life. &nbsp;At first I thought I was simply staying up too late and that if I simply went to bed earlier, that would take care of that. &nbsp;Then I found out it wasn&#039;t so simple.<br /><br />That&#039;s <em>my</em> on-going struggle. &nbsp;You might have something else you&#039;d like to change - your weight, your job, your relationships - whatever is important to <em>you</em>, you&#039;re welcome to discuss it in the forum.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think you need to be a Delphi forum member to read forum posts, but you do need to be a member to reply or post new messages. &nbsp;Membership is free, and the Delphi website will tell you about advantages of paid membership. &nbsp;To join at any level you give them your e-mail address and you&#039;ll receive notification there of any new replies to your messages.<br /><br />On my forum I have set up a folder welcoming any Astorians who come by, even if it&#039;s just to say hello. &nbsp;You may post messages there and in any other forum folder. &nbsp;Let me know if you would like me to open my chat room at regular times. &nbsp;My current name at Delphi is Little Sushi, and that&#039;s the name you&#039;ll see on my messages and in the chat room. &nbsp;<br /><br />Here is the link to the Delphi home page:<br />http://www.delphiforums.com/ (http://www.delphiforums.com/)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
