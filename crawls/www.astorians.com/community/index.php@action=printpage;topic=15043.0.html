				I believe this is an annual problem, but I don&#039;t recall it being on Memorial Day last year: Music blaring from the park after midnight.<br /><br />It finally stopped a little while ago, but holy CRAP, how is this allowed?! It echoes off the buildings all over the neighborhood.&nbsp; :?<br /><br />Avoidable extra noise. Sucks. Especially when you were looking forward to getting up early and going on a little holiday vacation for the first time in 6 months&nbsp; :x

				Oh no, I have a feeling it&#039;s going to be another one of *those* threads again&nbsp; :-o<br /><br />Let&#039;s go through the usual checklist though...was the loud music the result of any one of the following common Astorians culprits:<br /><br />1) Charity fundraiser in Astoria Park<br />2) Fireworks from Greek or other ethnic holiday<br />3) Something that somehow is related to loud church bells ringing?<br /><br />&nbsp;:lol:

				I didn&#039;t hear anything last night, but usually it&#039;s from across the river at Randall&#039;s Island. I haven&#039;t been able to confirm it, but I believe it&#039;s people blasting music from their cars. Spanish music, mostly. The sound is amplified by the river and can seem like it&#039;s coming from the park.

				Last Saturday evening I finally had enough of the extraordinarily loud music blaring from the Park at about 2:00am so I walked down to investigate and found that people park their cars along the water on Shore Boulevard behind the swimming pool, open their car doors and crank their car stereos. It was a proper impromptu (and of course totally UNAUTHORIZED) block party going on, complete with drunken people dancing and partying all along Shore Boulevard, each car attempting to out blast the car next to it with it&#039;s own awful reggaeton remix or some horrid pop house track maxed to 11. Without engaging anyone, I discretely wrote down some license plate numbers and went home to call the police.<br /><br />The officer on duty at the 114th was very accommodating and extremely understanding as I explained (very calmly mind you) the situation as I found in detail. He confirmed what was happening, although a common occurrence (especially early on in the summer) was indeed illegal and he would send a unit out to investigate. Shortly thereafter the park became silent. Thank you NYPD.<br /><br />SO - in this scenario, anytime any of you hear excessively loud, unsanctioned music or noise coming from the park late at night, I urge you to just phone our precinct rather than try to navigate the red tape of 311. The more calls they get, the more likely the issue is to escalate into a some sort of policy change. (Perhaps a petition to close that stretch of Shore Boulevard to motorized vehicles on the weekends could help?) Organization and information exchange is the key.<br /><br />Here is the contact information for our precinct: <br /><strong>NYPD 114th Precinct</strong><br /><strong>(718) 626-9311</strong><br />34-16 Astoria Boulevard<br />Queens, NY, 11103<br /><br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/precincts/precinct_114.shtml<br /><br />Also if you are interested in making issues political - here&#039;s some good information to have as well:<br /><br /><strong>Astoria Community Council:</strong><br />President: Ann Bruno<br />First Vice President: Nancy Demeglio<br />Recording Secretary: Madeline Robertaccio<br />Corresponding Secretary: Lucy Marsanico<br />Treasurer: Vincent Marsanico<br />Sergeant at Arms: Jean Marie D&#039;Alleva<br /><br />Astoria Community Affairs: (718) 626-9327<br /><br />Meetings: <br />The 114th Precinct Community Council meetings are held the fourth Tuesday of the month at 7:00 p.m. at Ricardo&#039;s 21-04 24th Avenue (at 21st Street).

				In the past, I&#039;ve heard of groups attempting to have that road closed completely to stop this and the racing around the park and neighborhood.&nbsp; What has stopped it though (word of mouth only) is that people who live near the park do not want to lose the parking spaces that go along with the street.&nbsp; I wonder if this trend continues people will change their mind about what is more important, sleep or a place to park their car along the water.

				I think it&#039;s been like this forever, as a kid the spot by the water was always a place for &quot;young adults&quot; to hang out, play music, drink, smoke, race, etc..

				My guess is that what made a difference in unsurpAstorian&#039;s report to the police was that license plate numbers were given.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing the police take it that the caller is more serious about following through than if they get a general complaint.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to hear other people&#039;s opinion on this.

				Closing the road to cars would be disastrous for parking to visit the park with multiple young children during alternate side parking times. I experienced the road closed monday morning, had my daughter and nephew with me (2-year-old and 1-year-old) and parked six blocks away to get to the park with only one stroller. It was rough and i&#039;m sure other families would have similar problems getting near the park with supplies (picnic, balls, blankets, etc.) not impossible mind you, just challenging. Not sure its a good enough reason though as I&#039;m sure some careful planning would take care of it. <br /><br />And then this would also congest the parking in the blocks surrounding the area which would be troubling to those residents. <br /><br />I also would be disappointed at not being able to Vespa past the water. Selfish I know, but true :oops:

				Astoria Park has a nice big parking lot that is a short walk to Shore Blvd. <br /><br />I would love to see Shore Blvd closed to cars.&nbsp; And it will be this summer, as Shore Blvd between Ditmars and Astoria Park South will be closed on three different days as an extension of the city&#039;s Summer Streets program, that was so successful last year.&nbsp; All 5 boroughs are participating this year, which is very cool.&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait!

				Or they could just have some bike cops riding around.&nbsp; You&#039;d think that with all the money the city makes from tickets, and the sheer number of cars blasting music/motorcycles in the area, it would be a decent form of additional revenue.&nbsp; I&#039;d much rather see &quot;noise&quot; maids wandering around than meter maids!
