				Hi everyone.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been living in the Pistilli Riverview East apartments for almost a year now.&nbsp; A few months ago, I started to have a serious problem in my apartment -- my next door neighbor started smoking and the cigarette smoke comes into my apartment.&nbsp; It blasts into my bedroom from the heating/AC unit (it seriously seems like there&#039;s someone in the room smoking), and I&#039;ve woken up some mornings with lung fulls of cigarette smoke.&nbsp; The smoke also comes into the apartment through the recessed flood lights in the kitchen.&nbsp; And I think that it also may be coming in through the vents in my kitchen and bathroom.&nbsp; So I&#039;m pretty much trapped into inhaling and smelling the smoke.&nbsp; It&#039;s really bothering me (physically and as an intrusion) and after more than two months of phone calls, the assistant super was here today to address the problem.&nbsp; He took off the air conditioner cover in my bedroom to show me huge openings where the smoke was coming through, and sealed them with some kind of sealing foam.&nbsp; But he insisted that the smoke wouldn&#039;t be coming in from the kitchen ceiling or the air vents on the first floor.<br /><br />I think that his sealing the openings in my bedroom helped -- because tonight I smelled cigarette smoke in my bedroom, but it wasn&#039;t very strong.&nbsp; However, on the first floor, it is still pretty bad.&nbsp; And I&#039;m certain that the smoke is coming through the recessed lighting in the kitchen ceiling.<br /><br />Have any other Riverview East residents, or others, had this problem?&nbsp; And if so, have you been able to get it fixed?<br /><br />Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

				Sounds like they messed up vents.&nbsp; No surprise, I saw the workers they had doing construction on that place, they made the 3 stooges look intelegent.&nbsp; Pistili is a creep IMO, and those places he put up are crap.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would suggest you complain to management, although they will stonewall you.&nbsp; &nbsp;I doubt neighbor will quit smoking for you.&nbsp; Hope you get problem solved. <br /><br />If they are still&nbsp; having problem selling units there, I would threaten to publicize problem unless they fix it.&nbsp;

				sorry to hear that. im having a similar problem with my downstairs neighbors.&nbsp; <br />Remember that smoking is NOT a right. you should google search the NYC laws on smoking in residential buildings; they offer some good solutions. <br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;m sorry that you&#039;re also having this problem, PDQ Fruitbatt.<br /><br />Your point that smoking isn&#039;t a right is an interesting one.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always felt that we should be able to do whatever we want in our own home, as long as we&#039;re not hurting anybody.&nbsp; But since our neighbors&#039; smoking IS hurting us - is it that they shouldn&#039;t be able to smoke in their apartment, or that the landlord must ensure that their smoke doesn&#039;t enter our homes?<br /><br />I just did a quick Google search, and didn&#039;t come up with anything that will immediately support my situation.&nbsp; Although there&#039;s a very timely article in the NYTimes about the issue:&nbsp; http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/16/nyregion/16smoke.html (http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/16/nyregion/16smoke.html)&nbsp; It looks like we&#039;re better off hanging out in a bar in NYC, then in our own apartments...<br /><br />I will do some more research and post anything else that I find.

				JoeyC,<br /><br />Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I will keep complaining.&nbsp; It would be great if they could just fix the vent problem.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how much effort and skill that will require, which I&#039;m sure will be the deciding factors.&nbsp; When I moved into the apartment, it seemed so huge and nice.&nbsp; But there really have been significant issues with quality (I&#039;ve had other problems with the apartment besides the smoke), and I would never have moved here had I known that the beauty of the building was skin deep.<br /><br />Apologies to the list for my multiple replies -- I&#039;m pretty new to posting, and didn&#039;t realize I couldn&#039;t reply to individual posts.<br /><br />-99<br /><br />

				You might find this lawsuit over second-hand smoke lawsuit in Tribeca interesting and relevant. http://curbed.com/archives/2009/12/02/smoke_suit_at_200_chambers_still_breathing.php.<br />http://www.metro.us/us/article/2009/08/05/06/0702-82/index.xml<br /><br />Just to be clear, I am not advocating this approach--lawsuits are ugly, expensive and time-consuming.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I&#039;m not a smoker and hate cigarette smoke, but if someone is smoking in the privacy of their home, I think it is tough luck for you, unless the apartment building specifically prohibits smoking.&nbsp; &nbsp;If I smoked in my apartment and a neighbor complained to me about it, I would say tough luck.

				Funny thing about apartment buildings is that there are always people with barking dogs, noisy children, loud stereos, smoking (tobacco, pot, or other substances) cooking odors, occasional loud arguments, parties, and so on, and so on.&nbsp; Yes there are laws that prohibit certain activities.&nbsp; But living in close quarters requires a lot of give and take.&nbsp; And if it&#039;s not feeling right, then that&#039;s why there are these things called houses.
