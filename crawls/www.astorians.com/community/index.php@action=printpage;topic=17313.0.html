				In two consecutive Sunday editions, the once&nbsp; responsible NY Daily, in one of it&#039;s interior&nbsp; sections&nbsp; advertised&nbsp; a book on how great graffiti was in the 70&#039;s&nbsp; in NY and this Sunday in reference&nbsp; to a building in L.I.C.&nbsp; <br /><br />Graffiti is NOT <em>art</em>, it&#039;s criminal vandalism and a precusor to other criminal activity. In my neighborhood, having it removed&nbsp; reduced&nbsp; the characters&nbsp; who congregated on the corner&nbsp; and drank, urinated and even stole things from back yards. I caught one of them actually <em>bombing</em> a freshly&nbsp; cleaned wall one night, sadly, he had a car and drove away as I yelled and chased after him. <br /><br />In the reference the Daily News has today, the writer, under a picture of a graffiti covered building in LIC, has a self answered&nbsp; question on how &#039;those who don&#039;t see graffiti as art should come to this building.&#039; Well, I don&#039;t see it, it&#039;s ugly, attracts dangerous people and it&#039;s vandalism. I am writing a letter of complaint to the Daily News. It&#039;s tough enough these days keeping a neighborhood litter and free of danger, we don&#039;t need a newspaper&nbsp; exalting a&nbsp; destructive practice.

				Oh dear...and we just did a window of a book called &quot;Subway Art&quot; I guess that means we support someone tagging your house. <br /><br />However, I will say that there is no easy answer here. I do believe that there is an element of art. And an element of destruction.<br /><br />Your Call!

What I&#039;m talking about is people just walking about anywhere scribbling&nbsp; and making large murals wherever they please and without anyone&#039;s permission.<br /><br />I remember the&nbsp; Subway &#039;art&#039; of the 70&#039;s, when you couldn&#039;t read a map or see out of the window in a subway. It&#039;s already been called and it&#039;s illegal and people&nbsp; should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. It&#039;s&nbsp; one thing I have been part of when contacting Vallones office.

				Also, if anyone out there thinks Graffiti is just a&nbsp; relatively harmless nuisance... <br /><br />http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/02/gang-interventionist-fatally-shot-after-confronting-tagger.html (http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/02/gang-interventionist-fatally-shot-after-confronting-tagger.html)<br /><br />February 8, 2010 | 11:16 am<br />A former Crips gang member, who police said transformed himself by working to steer others away from lives of violence, was fatally shot after he confronted a tagger in Mid-Wilshire, Los Angeles police said Monday.<br /><br />Ronald Lamonte Barron, 40, was leaving the Cottage Bar in the 5000 block of West Pico Boulevard about 9 p.m. Sunday with his girlfriend when he noticed a tagger applying graffiti to a nearby wall, police said.<br /><br />Barron confronted the tagger, who pulled out a pistol and fired once, hitting Barron in the chest.<br /><br />Barron had once been a Mansfield Crips gang member but had made a successful transition to gang outreach and intervention work, authorities said. Barron continued to use his former gang name, &quot;Looney&quot; and worked for Amer-I-Can, a gang-intervention program founded by Football Hall of Fame member Jim Brown. Barron was known for his gang outreach work in the L.A. County jails.<br /><br />-- Andrew Blankstein<br /><br />

				Graffiti when done well and allowed by the building owner is an art form. I&#039;ve seen some fine examples, mostly in other countries. <br /><br />What the kids do in our back alley and on the landlord&#039;s garage door? Definitely no talent there.<br /><br />By definition, it&#039;s done by outlaws, some of whom have real talent, that&#039;s where things get problematic. <br /><br />My favorite example is Gouzo, done by an artist named Jace, and it&#039;s become a part of Reunion Island pop art. While technically illegal, it&#039;s harmless enough, and it&#039;s usually found on abandoned structures or remote landscapes.
