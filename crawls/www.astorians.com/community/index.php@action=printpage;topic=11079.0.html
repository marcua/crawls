				I&#039;ve noticed this the last couple summers and it just happened again last night (6-24).&nbsp; On random nights throughout the summer, we hear what we think is thunder around 10pm.&nbsp; We look out our west-facing windows and it turns out to be fireworks.&nbsp; We live between 36th and 37th aves, and they appear to be due west of us.&nbsp; They are on the other side of the tall buildings on Randall&#039;s Island, so we can only see them very obscured.&nbsp; They definitely are on this side of Manhattan, though.<br /><br />Anyone have any idea what they are for?

				Last night the NY Philharmonic put on a free concert in Central Park on the Great Lawn.&nbsp; It was awesome.&nbsp; It was so packed!!&nbsp; Everyone was just lounging on blankets with their wine and cheese, chilling out, and listening to summertime classics played by an amazing orchestra.&nbsp; Afterwards, there were fireworks.&nbsp; I ended up going by myself because all my friends had something better to do, but they are having another one on the 15th, if anyone wants to join me.

				Nah, it&#039;s on the 15th, which is a Tuesday.&nbsp; It&#039;s a little confusing if you look at it too quickly.

				There are fireworks after every NY Philharmonic concert in the parks, no matter where it takes places. Nothing like free classical in an open environment.
