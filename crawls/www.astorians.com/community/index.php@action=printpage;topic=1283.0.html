				I'm a rabid fan of this show, not that I even cook. <br /><br />Is there a good kitchen supply place around here, where I can pick up some of the gadgets used on the show? <br /><br />Specifically, that rasp-style grater (last seen used on the Egg Nog episode for nutmeg.) My father is <em>impossible</em> to shop for, but he does like to cook. He'd actually be impressed by a thing like this.

				It's called a microplane grater, and yeah, they're supposed to be great. I don't have one, though. My crappy old rectangular grater works well enough for me for nutmeg...<br /><br />I can't imagine where you would find one of these in Astoria. (If anyone does, please fill us in!) My suggestion would be to just take a good book to the subway and go to Broadway Panhandler (http://www.broadwaypanhandler.com/broadway/) in Soho...

				There is a place on 31st St. between 30th and 31st avenues that sells commercial kitchen equipment, and I noticed they also have a seperate storefront where it looks like they sell dishes and other kitchenware. &nbsp;I don't know how extensive their selection is but it is open to the public so it might be worth a look. &nbsp;It is kind of across the street from the Euro Market.

				There are a few restaurant equipment places on &nbsp;31st street between 30th ave and 36 ave. mostly large equipment. &nbsp;there is also win supply (a huge restaurant equipment house) on northern and 42nd street. &nbsp;These places may have what you want.<br /><br />But Harlan has the best idea, &nbsp;go downtown to broadway panhandler, they have everything a home cook could possibly want and then some.<br /><br />You know the microplane grater originaly comes from a carpenters tool at a hardware store. &nbsp;i think it is called a microplane rasp???

				They&#39;re open 24 hours? DIdn&#39;t know that. I was luke-warm to that place at first, but it&#39;s growing on me. I&#39;m glad they&#39;ve covered thier produce, tho. It grossed me out when it was just out under the train before.

				Oh yeah, the Microplane line is brilliant. It is possibily my favorite kitchen tool next to my knives. I&#39;ve given a zillion of them as gifts and they always bring rave reviews.

				Thanks for all this info! Very helpful. <br /><br />I did find one @ Fairway in Plainview, but then over-thought my decision and didn&#39;t get it. Oh well, I go there now and then anyway. They&#39;ve got a whole new section of kitchenware, pret-ty ex-ci-ting.<br /><br />

				There is Corningware outlet store on Northern Blvd. around 61st street that sells interesting gadgets, as well as plates, serving dishes, etc. Sometimes you can find good deals on their discounted items. The store is just west of the BQE on Northern Blvd.
