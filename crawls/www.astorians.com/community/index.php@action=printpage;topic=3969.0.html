And somewhat encouraging.<br /><br />Not sure what demographic that puts you in though.<br />Maybe younger. Maybe more tasteful. Maybe an early sleeper.<br /><br />If you like camp, transvestitism, Tim Curry, a &#39;young&#39; Susan Sarandon, foolish plotting, audience participation, cyfy, meatloaf, but not necks -<br />you might want to check it out.<br /><br />when I first heard of this film, my innocent ears were quite scared.<br />it is like a silly cartoon for the lost sixties/seventies generation

				Exactly what year was Rocky Horror out and when did it become all the rage?&nbsp; Was it before my time? If you grew up in a small town with small town ways, where no independent stuff was shown and art was nonexistent, would you even know what it was?

				What&#39;s the best way to walk there? I&#39;d like to wear an outfit worthy of Rocky Horror, but isn&#39;t this club on the &quot;other side&quot; of 21st? I think it&#39;s kinda scary over there. Anyone coming from the 30th Ave or Astoria Ave direction that would want to meet up and walk together?

Rocky Horror Virgins. <br /><br />Real virgins can only be found in hospital nurseries!&nbsp; :evil:<br /><br />Virgins Heads Up: it is fair game to hunt out virgins and make them lose their virginity before the fun (READ: movie and show) begins. Among the most popular ways of doing this: having to eat cherries; faking an orgasm; being spanked with a paddle; humping something or someone and sometimes getting a red, lipstick *V* planted on your forehead. Lots of laughter, no-one gets hurt, it&#39;s all in fun—and if your high on *anything* it&#39;s even betterer! (Yes, it is too a word, even if I just made it up.)

Look for the 2 red lights, and the &quot;angry bouncer&quot;. It&#39;s not as scary as you may think. It&#39;s like the monster under your bed, its scary to think about but nothing is going to happen.

				Thanks for the info. I&#39;ve never lived in a place where I got cat-called in sweats before, so the fishnets seems a little... eh... but I live so close!<br /><br />Will other people be dressing up?
