			Take Root presents ZEST Collective and Undertow Dance <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;ZEST Collective: On The Map is a performance art project and testimony that immigrants define the essence of the American - and global - experience. In this new work, people of all races and walks of life will come together to learn about uncommon pasts and shared present. Punctuated by poetry and iconic speeches about abandoning fear, ZEST Collective&#039;s new ballet emphasizes strength derived from struggle. On The Map pays homage to those who fight sensitively to seek and protect personal liberty. Join us as we reveal the tales of separated families, veterans, undocumented workers, and history of &#039;travelers&#039; to this country, by free will or force and the importance of religious and political freedom.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Undertow Dance: Excerpt from Pitch Dark no. 1 (a breakdown) dives into a world of chance encounters and simmering frustration. Collaborative and investigative, this work for four dancers is the impossibility of ever fully breaking emotional patterns, as the past reasserts itself.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;June 9 &amp;10, 2017 at 8pm<br />&nbsp;Admission: $15<br />&nbsp;Green Space Studio<br />&nbsp;37-24 24th Street, #301<br />&nbsp;Long Island City, NY 11101<br />&nbsp;718-956-3037<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Tickets are available at the door or online at http://www.greenspacestudio.org/TakeRoot.html<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Take Root is a monthly curated series that supports dance makers by providing an opportunity to show a half evening work paired with another artist.
