				I can&#039;t figure out where to go to get any plants! I don&#039;t have a card, but I&#039;d be willing to go out of Astoria if necessary. I&#039;d like to be able to find some tomato plants, maybe a pepper plant, etc. If I have to go the seeds route, that&#039;s ok, too, but I don&#039;t even know where to get seeds (sort of mail-order).<br /><br />Is there anywhere local that sells this stuff?<br /><br />Thanks!<br />

				I think the best place is that place on Astoria Boulevard and 49th Street.&nbsp; They have good prices and good quality plants.&nbsp; Once the freeze period is over, I have to head on down there myself and get my garden going. <br /><br />I think also the Union Square Market has alot of plants come springtime.&nbsp; <br />

				In addition to Union Square, I have two suggestions: <br />1. Try the garden district in Manhattan, which is on 6 Avenue from 25st to about 27th, or thereabouts. <br />2. Home Depot.

				We haven&#039;t bought any plants yet this season, but last year we purchased tomato plants from both Home Depot and the Union Square Farmer&#039;s Market. We also purchased a jalapeno plant but I can&#039;t remember which place we bought it from.

				Seems like we got only a couple of peppers off of it. It wasn&#039;t very fruitful at all, but part of the problem was that the birds would come and pick at our plants. Gotta figure out a better solution this year to discourage the birds (and squirrel - yes squirrel) from destroying our plants. Grrr...

				Bargain stop on 30th ave has seeds. I&#039;ve seen plants here and there but can&#039;t recall anything specific at the moment. <br /><br />

				As a corollary, are there any places in the nabe that sell garden supplies?&nbsp; I have seeds, but I need a small pot and some potting soil.

				I know that some of the florist shops (e.g., the one on 31st and Ditmars) sell potting soil. It&#039;s probably overpriced, but they&#039;ve got it.<br /><br />I&#039;m not too far from Astoria &amp; 49th... I&#039;ll probably check that out first.

				I&#039;ve found plants, potting soil and gardening supplies at the Home Depot down on Northern Boulevard.&nbsp; It&#039;s a bit of a walk, but it&#039;s got everything!

				There is a flower shop on 38th and Ditmars that sells flats of flowers and vegetables in the spring and summer, its a small selection but nice to be able to pick up locally.&nbsp; I&#039;ve bought jalapeno plants and basil from them for the past two years, and they are always healthy and grow well (and taste great).&nbsp; The vegetable shop across the street sells a similar selection of flowers and vegetables as well.&nbsp; I typically get everything else I need from Union Square like everyone else.&nbsp; There is another thread on here somewhere from last year that talks about a nearby nursery that a bunch of people would drive to that had an excellant selection.&nbsp; Might be worth renting a zip car and loading up.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				The place on 38th and Ditmars doesn&#039;t have the guy coming in as of this morning, but Top Tomato had herbs and bedding flowers and veggie plants for 1.49 a pack, or 10 dollars for a whole box.&nbsp; Much cheaper than the florists on Ditmars for sure!!

				I think that Verni&#039;s on Hazen Street off Astoria Blvd is the largest Garden Center in the area.&nbsp; Generally, they are pretty nice there, but can be neanderthal-like at times.&nbsp; They do not really understand customer service but their selection is so vast that I have overlooked their rough around the collar ways.

				Do not get them at home depot...gardening enthusiasts I know have done nothing but advise against this, that the plans are not sturdy, die quickly and are low quality.

				I concur with this.. Home depot plants need a lot of TLC to be worth it.<br />

				An update on this: Top Tomato on Ditmars (and 34th, I think?) is selling tomato plants and various other basic garden varieties.
