			Hi everyone. Long time lurker, first time poster.<br /><br />My apologies if this has been discussed all ready but I couldn&#39;t find it. Does anyone know any good realtors to find a place in Astoria, places you&#39;ve had good experiences with or at least not bad ones? I all ready live here in our beloved neighborhood, but I need to find a new place.<br /><br />Thanks!

			Amorelli Realty up on 30th Avenue is good, Neon on Broadway is good as well.
