			The only problem with this topic is now I have some else&#039;s song stuck in my head! <br /><br />She&#039;s a maniac, maniac on the floor,<br />and she&#039;s dancing like she never danced before...<br /><br />&nbsp;:-D

			An earworm!<br /><br />Direct translation from German, courtesy of an international student teacher who worked with thatjimguy once.&nbsp; We&#039;ve called those songs earworms ever since.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been having random Jack Johnson songs as earworms for the past week or so.&nbsp; Right now it&#039;s Mediocre Bad Guys.
