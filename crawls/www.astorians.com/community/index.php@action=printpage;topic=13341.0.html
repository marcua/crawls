				Once again, I&#039;m just passing on some news.&nbsp; In no way am I affiliated with the rink.<br /><br />---------------------------------------<br /><br />Ok, so the new LIC rink is now open.&nbsp; They are now having open hockey and the full schedule has been posted.&nbsp; Again, full gear is required to play.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also gotten word that half-shield are being permitted on a trial basis.&nbsp; Personally, I think this is only ok for advanced players, but whatever.&nbsp; It&#039;s your teeth at risk, not mine.<br /><br />All Open Hockey sessions are $20 CASH ONLY.&nbsp; So remember to bring money.&nbsp; <br /><br />And yes, there are stands.&nbsp; So if you just want to watch, you can sit and watch.<br /><br />No info on league play has been released yet.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the schedule.&nbsp; <br /><br />___________________________________<br /><br /><br />Monday, Dec 8th<br />7:00pm - 8:20pm<br /><br />Tuesday, Dec 9th<br />Noon - 1:20pm<br />7:00pm - 8:20pm<br /><br />Wednesday, Dec 10<br />Noon - 1:20pm<br />-----8:30pm - 9:50pm <br /><br />Thusday, Dec 11th<br />Noon - 1:20pm<br />-----NO NIGHTTIME OPEN HOCKEY------<br /><br />Friday, Dec 12<br />Noon - 1:20pm<br />-----8:30pm - 9:50pm <br /><br /><br />

				Here&#039;s the latest (and probably my last) update on happenings at the rink.&nbsp; The Adult hockey tournament which I wrote about in the original thread (&quot;Hockey @ LIC Ice Pavilion&quot;) that was unexpectedly cancalled is <span class="bbc_u"><strong>now back on</strong></span>.&nbsp; Details are as follows:<br /><br />&quot;City Ice Pavilion will be kicking the Adult Hockey League with a 4 Division Tournament starting the week of January 5th. Each Division will play on the following nights (with each team playing one game on a Sunday or Friday). All time and dates are subject to change&quot;<br /><br />D1- Monday&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />D2-Wednesday&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />D3-Thursday&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />D4- Tuesday<br /><br />For those of you who aren&#039;t sure, the higher the division, the better the caliber of players.&nbsp; So D1 guys have probably played College and/or Junior.&nbsp; Whereas D4 players have much less experience.<br /><br />If you want to enter as a team, you get a a minimum of three games guaranteed for $1000 and free parking.<br />All teams must have matching jerseys (City Ice will provide jerseys for an extra $200 per team) <br />Rosters are limited to 16 skaters and one goalie <br />Each Divisionâ€™s winner will get 15% off 2009 Adult Hockey League Fees <br /><br /><br />If you&#039;re not entering with a team and are just going solo (like me), individuals can sign-up for $120.00 (includes evaluation session, and jersey).&nbsp; In order to placed with a team, you need to go to an &quot;evaluation session&quot; (ugh), which are scheduled on the following dates:<br />Thursday, December 18th @ 8:30p-9:50p<br />Monday, December 29th @ 8:30p-9:50p<br /><br />Again, an &quot;evaluation session&quot; consist of you doing a bunch of drills on the ice and the staff will assess which level you belong in.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure a few team captains will be there; so if they need another skater and you impress, you&#039;ll may get a phone call asking you to join thier team.<br /><br /><br />No Checking. No Fighting (only because people have to go to work the next day).<br />Half-Shields are permitted (as I said in the previous post, I only recommend this for advanced players, but it&#039;s up to you).<br />All Players MUST be registered with USA Hockey <br /><br /><br />Finally, if you need a copy of the registration form:<br />cityice.pucksystems.com/page/show/55822-adult-hockey (http://cityice.pucksystems.com/page/show/55822-adult-hockey)<br /><br /><br />So call your friends, wake up the kids, text your co-workers...there&#039;s some hockey going on in our neck of the woods!!!!&nbsp;

				NYCGoalie - you going down tonight for the evaluation? i&#039;m still on the fence about doing 2 leagues, but i figure it&#039;s worth $20 to come down, skate a bit, check out the rink, and get the league details tonight.

				Didn&#039;t go to the eval last night.&nbsp; I have my last tournament game tonight and the team will probably work something out to play together in the spring season.&nbsp; <br /><br />Normally I&#039;ll be there since I love free ice time.

				could have used you last night. only 1 goalie...about 5&#039;4&quot; and 16 years old. although he did absolutely rob me once - 1/2 open net, backhander, gooooa...oops...kick save and a beaut!<br /><br />about 30 guys last night. it was just like open hockey but they had us put #&#039;s on, so they knew who was who and could rate us. i got an email from them maybe an hour after the session with everyone&#039;s suggested divisions. the head guy said they have 2-3 teams for each division and can fit up to 6 each. they are looking to put together a couple of house teams and then let the other teams contact people to complete their rosters if needed.<br /><br />the rink was ok. does not seem regulation to me. <br /><br />getting home in 15 minutes flat however....$^#@(! awesome!! my brother lives in Sunnyside, he was home 4 minutes after we left the place.

				So is anyone playing in the LIC league? My bro and I are in D2 on the Free Agents team. First game tonight. <br /><br />Should be interesting. there were 16 guys on the email they sent out to us. my guess is we&#039;ll end up with 9-10 players. lots of ice time ;)

				I was the goalie for the other team (Westside Skate).&nbsp; You guys ended up with a bit more than 9-10 players.&nbsp; <br /><br />Bad news is that Pat had to move one team out of D2.&nbsp; So now there are going to be a couple of bye-weeks in the season due to the uneven schedule.&nbsp;

				hey, nice game. LOL.<br /><br />yeah there were about 15 people on the email list. i really expected a good 5-6 of them to flake out, but i think pretty much everyone showed. nobody wanted to play D for us, so my bro and i volunteered. more ice time that way ;) we need some more offense for next game. <br /><br />did they have to move a team up or down a division?
