				I&#039;m not suprised.&nbsp; Such a huge and awkward space, it had to be expensive to rent.&nbsp; And both Planet Wings and All Star burger seemed to be businesses that would work in a much smaller space.&nbsp; I think the dining area being so large makes it difficult to &quot;look&quot; sucessfull, since it would be incredibly difficult to draw that large of a following.&nbsp; I personally thought both restaurants served boring food.&nbsp; I really wanted to like planet wings, I <em>love</em> wings, but they were nothing special.&nbsp; I look forward to seeing what weird thing pops up in it next.

				Plus let&#039;s not forget the reopening of McDonald&#039;s just down the street.&nbsp; That definitely had to have hurt business for All star Burger as well.&nbsp; I think someone called it on another thread a few months back actually.&nbsp; But yeah, it&#039;s a large wide space, so it never really looks busy, even when there&#039;s a lot of people inside, and that does have an effect on passers-by trying to decide where to eat.

				Two words: bowling alley! &nbsp; :lol:<br /><br />(two, maybe three lanes.)<br /><br />There are certainly plenty of restaurants that divide up that sort of space OK. The trick appears not to have one very long room, but to divide it up. The old 31 restaurant did that, if I recall...<br /><br />

				Well i&#039;m glad it closed. The food wasn&#039;t very good and for being &quot;fast&quot; food, it took like 12 minutes to get a burger. One night while out with a large group of friends, we went there for ice cream. Some moron forgot to plug in the freezer and all their ice cream melted. What was even more bizarre was that their ice cream topping jars were glued to the counter. That space just doesn&#039;t work for a fast food restaurant, it&#039;s too big.

				Yeah I agree. I once went there after the Beer Garden (around 11:00pm on a Saturday) and sat there for 15 minutes waiting to get 10 buffalo wings.

				I feel kind of bad being happy about that place closing, but any place that&#039;s going to call itself &quot;All-Star Burger&quot; better have tastier burgers than my college cafeteria did. But I&#039;m not terribly hopeful about whatever goes in there next, so I can only be pleasantly surprised if it turns out to be decent. The old &quot;50% Off Cards and Gift Wrap&quot; place seems to have closed up too, though I&#039;m not sure it was ever closed or if they&#039;re just renovating it. Plus we still have the two places where 31 and Twin Donut used to be, and then that old smoke shop that was apparently seized due to unpaid taxes. Brazilianaki is gone too. That didn&#039;t last long. No one&#039;s claimed the cursed Les Moules space either. So much opportunity...

				I hate saying I&#039;m glad to see a business well, go out of business...but my one experience with the place was unpleasant at best. It felt horribly out of place...Like it belonged in a suburban strip mall. I really, really hope something good pops up there. It is an awkward space...but hopefully something that the neighborhood is lacking, like a nice book store (if not the B&amp;N), will magically appear there?

				The old discount card store moved to Ditmars and 35th St, so that space is going to be a new cell phone store.&nbsp; I read one of their building permits and it said cellular.&nbsp; Might want to ask one of the construction guys to verify that.&nbsp; <br /><br />I still would like to see a restaurant occupy that space, a real restaurant, not a fast food joint.&nbsp; A book store, but not B&amp;N, would work well there too.&nbsp; But the rent might be too high for that.

				I know this is totally tangential and biased, but I saw Cold Stone mentioned before and I really hope that the space does not go to them. They cause 30+ outbreaks of samonella in Chicago and Boston and still have not adopted the cheap and simple tests that can keep it out of the best ice cream (cake batter &amp; cookie dough). They have a number of other bad, non-green socially unacceptable things that happens to their milk and their product. <br /><br />If anyone is interested, I have a volume of resources on them. I was trying to keep them out of my last neighborhood where we had locally farmed and produced ice cream, so I have a bunch of research, though it is definitely biased.

				I&#039;m the one who mentioned Cold Stone and I LOVE their Cake Batter Ice Cream.&nbsp; I knew they had that Salmonella problem before and the particular flavor (cake batter) was pulled from their stores.&nbsp; I was led to believe they addressed the issue, stocked the stores back up with the stuff and since then there have been no problems.<br /><br />I am interested in the information you have since I am a Cold Stone indulger every now and again.&nbsp; Feel free to PM it over.

				Well, I know my boyfriend and I are quite upset about All Star Burger closing, to get back to the original theme of this thread. That was the only place around here that we&#039;ve found that makes and delivers decent wings. Does anyone on here know of any other places in Astoria where one can get good wings in flavors other than buffalo or barbecue? It would be great to find a place that makes awesome lemon pepper wings.

Cheap is great. I know the McCann&#039;s special is on Sundays, but I believe it may be on another day as well.<br /><br />Is the wing special still at Blackstone Bar? It would be a travesty if they got rid of it.

				Went to Blackstone Bar this past Tuesday and have to say, the wings were the best I&#039;ve had in Astoria, and possibly NYC, thus far. Far superior to McCann&#039;s wings. I&#039;ll give McCann&#039;s another shot, but I do think Blackstone Bar is the place to go for good wings in Astoria.

				Blackstone was purchased by new owners in February - that&#039;s why they changed the name. It&#039;s just that it took awhile to put up the new signs, but most of the staff is the same.
