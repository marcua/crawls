If you can&#039;t join us in the walk, you can join us in the fight by making a pledge or donation on behalf of one of our team members. Your pledge will help fund important research into the cause and cure of women&#039;s cancers, prevention, education and support service programs. Every pledge will help bring us one step closer to a cure.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Even with decreasing statistics due to cancer research, it is estimated that in 2008, almost 56,000 American women are expected to die from breast and ovarian cancers. Nationally, 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer during her lifetime. Further, breast cancer accounts for more than 25% of cancer diagnosed in women in the United States. Behind these staggering statistics is the face of a woman who needs your help - a mother, a wife, a sister, a friend. The need is great and that is why I would like to ask for your help.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Created in 1993 through the committed and collective efforts of the Entertainment Industry Foundation, Lilly Tartikoff, Ronald O. Perelman, and The Davis Group, the EIF Revlon Run/Walk For Women has grown to become one of the nation&#039;s largest 5K fundraising events. To date, the Run/Walks (LA/NY) have raised over 22 million dollars for cancer research, counseling, and outreach programs. Thanks in part to these funds, new treatments are being developed and lives are being saved.</strong><br /><br />If you would like to join our team and walk with us or make a donation on my behalf please use paste the link below<br /><br />https://www.revlonrunwalk.com/ny/secure/MyWebPage.cfm?pID=411194<br /><br />Thank you for you support
