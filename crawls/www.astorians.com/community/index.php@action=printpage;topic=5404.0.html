				We had another successful meeting last night and the new CSA serving Mid-Southern Astoria is in active development.&nbsp; Information will be forthcoming regarding cost, location, etc., and will be posted and discussed in another thread on this board.&nbsp; In the meantime, we desperately need your help!<br /><br />Before we can go any further in development, we need to find a name worthy of our new community venture!&nbsp; It should be something that reflects and highlights something about our neighborhood...and should be fun and memorable.&nbsp; If you have any ideas, we would love for you to post them here.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here are some initial ideas from last night&#039;s meeting for your kind consideration and review:<br /><br />Sunswick CSA<br />Kaufman CSA<br />Dionysus CSA<br />Duck Soup CSA<br />Olympus CSA<br />Green Goddess CSA<br />Demeter CSA (are you seeing the Greek theme yet...?)<br />Kronos (or Cronus) CSA<br />Mid-Southern Astoria CSA<br />Little Greece CSA<br />Astoria Collective CSA<br /><br />Please give us your ideas and feedback.&nbsp; Thanks!<br />Leezichka

				I like Sunswick CSA!<br /><br />What about Dutch Kills CSA?&nbsp; Dutch Kills (http://www.astorialic.org/neighborhoods/dk_p.php), like Sunswick, is a historic name in the area - specifically the area north of Queensboro Plaza.

				Hallet&#039;s Cove CSA was the original name of that area (and the name I came up with way back when we first started coming up with names...)<br />Steinway CSA<br /><br />I dunno, that Duck Soup still has a nice ring to it, despite the vegetarians it might turn off<br />Our concern w/ Sunswick is that people might think we&#039;re associated with the bar.<br /><br />c/o Wikipedia:<br />Originally, Astoria was known as Hallet&#039;s Cove, but was renamed after the famous millionaire John Jacob Astor in order to persuade him to invest $2,000 in the neighborhood. He contributed only $500 to the neighborhood, but the name stayed.[4] It has been said that Astoria was named for a man who never set foot in it. A bitter battle over naming the village was finally won by supporters and friends of John Jacob Astor (1763-1848). Astor, entrepreneur and real estate tycoon, had become the wealthiest man in America by 1840 with a net worth of over $40 million. As it turns out, Astor did live in &quot;Astoria&quot;â€”his summer home, built in Manhattan on what is now East 87th Street near York Avenue, from which he could see the new Long Island village across the River named in his honor.

				Keeping with the Greek goddess theme, how about Persephone Rising?<br /><br />This is how the myth goes:<br /><br />Persephone is the daughter of the Goddess Demeter, who stands for fertility of the earth, the seasons, and the seasonal giver of grain.&nbsp; Persephone was playing in a meadow one afternoon when Hades, God of the underworld, burst from the ground and&nbsp; took her to the underworld to be his bride.&nbsp; <br /><br />Demeter was so upset she sent man a terrible year -- a plague for the earth and the harvest.&nbsp; The land did not grow any crops. Man would die out from the famine, and the Gods would be robbed of offerings, but Zeus, &quot;king&quot; of the Gods, stepped in and considered the matter. <br /><br />Zeus ordered that Persephone come back from Hades so that Demeter could see her and end the terrible famine on earth.&nbsp; Hades let her go, but slipped her a pomegranate seed so that she could not remain by her mother&#039;s side.&nbsp; Since she had eaten a pomegranate seed, Persephone has to return to the underworld for three months, but the rest of the time she is allowed to stay with the other Gods. <br /><br />Thus, this myth explains the seasons.&nbsp; When Persephone is in the underworld, winter is upon the land because Demeter is sad.&nbsp; Then, when Persephone returns, Demeter allows plants to take root and crops to grow, and the land is fertile again.

				These are all great...keep them coming!&nbsp; It would be nice if we had a bunch of names to choose from at our next meeting on March 10th. <br /><br />I like both Hallet&#039;s Cove and Dutch Kills but am still unclear whether either of these cover the area we are trying to serve.&nbsp; Anyone think we will anger the local historians if we&#039;re off by a few blocks?&nbsp; The plan, at this point, is to have the distribution point be somewhere around 35th Street and 34th Avenue (at Cafe Bar if they will be kind enough to have us but if not, somewhere in that general area).<br /><br />I like Persephone Rising and Heavengate (maybe we can get the shares delivered by the Hale Bopp Comet?:)&nbsp; These would also look particularly good on our jerseys when, as Jayme suggested at the last meeting, we play Hellgate CSA in a softball tournament.&nbsp; <br /><br />I too worry that somehow Sunswick will be mistakenly connected to the local bar by the same name, but it&#039;s a great name and definitely still in the running.<br /><br />Anyone else?<br /><br />Leezichka

				I&#039;m a big fan of the Dutch Kills / Hallet Cove idea! I think the hardcore Astoria history buffs will probably let it slide, provided we explain the origin of the name somewhere on the website. It&#039;s the spread of knowledge, so they really can&#039;t be that miffed!<br /><br />I think it would be nice to see the CSA named after something specifically Astorian.

				I like names that reference &quot;old Astoria&quot; and I don&#039;t think the history buffs are too upset if you are off by a few blocks.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also like Duck Soup and I&#039;m ot sure it upsets the vegetarians too much -- assuming they get the reference.<br /><br />Are you going to post a poll so we can vote?<br /><br />cheers,<br />jayme<br /><br />

				I would worry that Cafe bar might be miffed if you called it Sunswick CSA due to the bar a few blocks away. This is the best name though.<br /><br />How about MSA CSA?&nbsp;

				I like Central Astoria CSA in Merm&#039;s list.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s rather simplistic, but it describes the location and that in itself would be good marketing tool.&nbsp;
