				On the one hand I&#039;m glad the French and British seem to, at least publicly, take the lead.&nbsp; On the other, it&#039;s another Western intervention that will cost many lives and more money than we can afford.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thoughts?

				I myself have mixed feelings regarding the action itself. I get the reason why and the timing......<br /><br />But I&#039;m really tired of our political talking heads and so called leaders switching sides based on who the President is. <br /><br />The only two political leaders I find consistant is Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich. <br /><br />Let&#039;s face facts. Congress&#039; Constitutional obligation to declare war is long dead. We have an Imperial Presidency and Congress be damned. And for those that have forgotten (not here...I&#039;m talking nationally) The reason for that check on the presidential powers was the many wars monarchs led their country into without any discussion. No, it&#039;s not perfect (witness the Spanish American war which was started by yellow Journalism) but it is a way to keep our President under control. Too many times Congress has allowed themselves to be caught up in a sentiment that is based on no reality (I&#039;m looking at you SoS Clinton) and voted authorization (is that really Constitutional) to action that caused us more harm than good. <br /><br />I&#039;m so tired of this. <br /><br />

				I&#039;m still shocked that the French took the lead, I guess everyone else said &quot;Hey, if the French ain&#039;t afraid... :-)<br /><br /><br />The whole Mid-East is in rebellian, we can&#039;t get involved , too many countries, too many factions. Yeman, Syria, Egypt, Libia----plus all the different tribes and groups (Tribes is what they call different facctions&nbsp; in Libia, so don&#039;t scream racism at me please)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I am glad to see much of the commentary here. In a different theater, only a few in Congress support bringing the troops home.<br /><br />I am reminded again of a very moving profile, and a few lines.<br /><br />http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/01/AR2011030106938.html<br /><br />&nbsp;&quot;I walked upstairs,&nbsp; &nbsp;and broke her heart.&quot; <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />&nbsp;&quot;One percent of Americans are touched by this war. Then there is a much smaller club of families who have given all.&quot; <br /><br />He spoke of the anger that some combat veterans feel toward the war&#039;s opponents. &quot;They hold in disdain those who claim to support them but not the cause that takes their innocence, their limbs and even their lives,&quot; he said. <br /><br />Later, he clarified in an interview that he is <strong>opposed to indifference</strong>, not dissent. <br /><strong>&quot;I just think if you are against the war, you should somehow try to change it,&quot; he said. &quot;Fight to bring us home.&quot; </strong> &nbsp;<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
