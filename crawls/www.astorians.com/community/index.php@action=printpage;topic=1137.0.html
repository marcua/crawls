				Washington DC- Congress today announced that the Office of <br />President of the United States will be outsourced to overseas <br />interests as of June 30th, the end of this fiscal year. The move is <br />being made to save $400K a year in salary, a record $521 Billion in <br />deficit expenditures and related overhead. <br /><br />The cost savings will be quite significant,&quot; says Congressman <br />Adam Smith (D, Wash) who, with the aid of the GAO (the General <br />Accounting Office) has studied outsourcing of American jobs <br />extensively. &quot;We simply can no longer afford this level of outlay and <br />remain competitive in the world stage,&quot; Congressman Smith said. Mr. <br />Bush was informed by email this morning of the termination of his <br />position. He will receive health coverage, expenses and salary until <br />his final day of employment. After that, with a two week waiting <br />period, he will then be eligible for $240 dollars a week from <br />unemployment insurance for 13 weeks. Unfortunately he will not be <br />able to receive state Medicaid health insurance coverage as his <br />unemployment benefits are over the required limit. <br /><br />Preparations have been underway for some time for the job <br />move. Sanji Gurvinder Singh of Indus Teleservices, Mumbai, India, <br />will be assuming the Office of President of the United States as of <br />July 1. Mr. Singh was born in the United States while his parents <br />were here on student visas, thus making him eligible for the <br />position. He will receive a salary of $320 (US$) a month but with no <br />health coverage or other benefits. Due to the time difference between <br />the US and India, Mr. Singh will be working primarily at night, when <br />offices of the US Government will be open. <br /><br />&quot;I am excited to serve in this position,&quot; Mr. Singh stated in <br />an exclusive interview. &quot;Working nights will let me keep my day job <br />at the American Express call center. I always knew I could be <br />President someday.&quot; <br /><br />Congress stressed patience when calling Mr. Singh as he may <br />not be fully aware of all the issues involved with his new position. <br />A Congressional Spokesperson noted that Mr. Singh has been given a <br />script tree to follow which will allow him to respond to most topics <br />of concern. The Spokesperson further noted that &quot;additional savings <br />will be realized as these scripting tools have been successfully used <br />by Mr. Bush and will enable Mr. Singh to provide an answer without <br />having to fully understand the issue itself.&quot; <br /><br />Mr. Bush has been offered the use of a Congressional Page to <br />help him write a resume and prepare for his upcoming job transition. <br />According to Manpower, Inc., the placement firm, Mr. Bush may have <br />difficulties in securing a new position as job prospects in the <br />Sports Franchise Ownership arena remain limited. A recently released <br />report from the Pentagon suggests a good prospect for him as a newly <br />unemployed person may be in the Army National Guard. There he would <br />be called up with his unit and stationed in Iraq, a country he has <br />visited briefly before. <br /><br />&quot;I've been there, I know all about Iraq and the conditions <br />there,&quot; stated Mr. Bush. He gained invaluable knowledge of the <br />country in his first visit at the Baghdad Airport non-smoking <br />terminal and gift shop. Meanwhile in Baghdad and Falluja, Iraq, <br />sources report that local Iraqis say Mr. Bush would receive an <br />especially warm reception from them. Such sources stated the Iraqis <br />only request would be to be informed of which convoy he would be <br />riding in order to give him the welcome he deserves. <br /><br />Congress continues to explore other outsourcing possibilities <br />including that of Vice-president and most Cabinet positions.
