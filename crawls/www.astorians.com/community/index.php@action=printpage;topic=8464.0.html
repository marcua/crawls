				From the Applebees post (that became a very interesting discussion about chains), somebody brought up how being kid-friendly can be important in restaurant choices... and I thought that warranted its own thread. :)<br /><br />My caveat: I have a 3 year old. So my idea of kid friendly might be different from yours. <br /><br />Good:<br />The Pizza place (Pizza Palace?) on the corner of Ditmars and 31st street serves milk in paper cups with straws, has a mini horse carousel and a candy grabbing machine. The pizza is... hot. ;)<br /><br />Mike&#039;s Diner (also on 31st): extensive kids&#039; menu, willing to take his order and process it while the slow grownups are still deciding what they want<br /><br />JJs (31st Ave around 37th or 38th street): I only just went there for the first time last Friday. We were off peak (around 2 pm), which probably helped. It&#039;s very grown up food, but their lo mein was amazing and my son sucked it down. I was a little worried about the chair, but he didn&#039;t break it so it&#039;s all good. No juice or milk options, though.<br /><br />Thai Elephant (31st, closer to 21st Ave): Ok, so the last time we were there adorable son knocked over his drink. Twice. Everywhere. But they were really nice about cleaning it up and not making us feel like freaks for attempting to eat out with a child, so they get points for that, even if they were the ones foolish enough to give a toddler a glass glass. Thank goodness it didn&#039;t break, or we would have had to tip more than 20%...<br /><br />The FreezePeach (yea!): Adorable toddler has been a regular since he was 10 months old, pooped his first away from home poop there, and the barrista will even give hime &quot;the brown lid!&quot; on&nbsp; his milk- to- go, even though technically it should be a white lid... we *heart* the peach...<br /><br />Not Good:<br />Brick Cafe (31st Ave and 35th st.): Hard time finding anything he would eat, the chairs were too flimsy to trust with his exhuberance and there was no room for a stroller inside.<br /><br />Wave Thai (31st, between 21st ave and Ditmars): Dark, noisy, and the waitstaff were really not happy that we brought a small person in. (Plus a good friend who eats out all the time with her adorable and well-behaved toddler got asked to move seats three times, and her husband thinks it was because of the adorable well-behaved toddler&#039;s existence.)<br /><br />* * *<br /><br />...and In Memorium, we lament the passing of Keystone Diner, the first place we found where there was enough space between the tables to roll our Graco stroller up next to the table without being a fire hazard... and where they didn&#039;t bat an eye at serving a nursing mom a mimosa. *weep*<br /><br />* * *<br /><br />Anyone else? Recommendations? Pans? Thanks!
