			I have heard rumors that Conservatives are sending Tea bags to President Obama and joining teabag parties. <br /><br />Before any Conservative here does ....Please Google teabagging. And learn what it actually means. I just want you to be saved from being embarrassed.

			<br />&nbsp;:-D<br /><br /><br />--- Quote ---Given the dramatic circumstances of the Boston Tea Party, tax revolts are actually quite unusual in the US.<br /><br />“The most interesting thing about the American people is that we are generally compliant in paying taxes, and tax revolts that seem surprising here are fairly common in a country like France where those farmers, if they get upset, they simply don’t pay,” says Mary Segers, a political scientist at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, NJ. “Americans are a strange people with respect to taxes, so this revolt is very interesting for that reason alone.”<br /><br />--- End quote ---<br /><br />Have you googled taco? I want to know when the taco party starts.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-P<br /><br />I thought Boston was special in history thanks to teabags.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D<br />But turns out teabags are a NY invention.&nbsp; &nbsp;:|<br /><br />http://features.csmonitor.com/politics/2009/02/27/budget-debate-launches-new-tea-party/<br /><br />http://taxdayteaparty.com/<br /><br />/ on Facebook so it must be significant, not sure if folks are Twitting this<br /><br /><br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbkEfYohXTA<br /><br />

			Never really thought about going, but than I thought why not?<br />Here&#039;s the facebook page;<br />http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=54341378611<br />I&#039;ve got some free time. I&#039;m hoping it&#039;s not like those moronic &quot;death to capitalism&quot; protests, but who knows.<br />Something is going to give at some point and this country needs to get a new sense of itself. This is not &quot;panic&quot; time, this is not &quot;crisis&quot; time, but this is a time to be heard.
