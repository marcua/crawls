				Hey-<br />Again, thanks to everyone who showed up. &nbsp;Its always great to get some kind of Ultimate game in on a weekend. &nbsp;We had a group of mostly new players this past weekend, so if any of you who have made it to the previous game come back this coming weekend we will have a good solid group to play with. &nbsp;<br /><br />Bring your friends too and we will have effective numbers to take on the local teenage football players in a territory war for the hellgate hill.

				Thanks to you all for coming out, it was another great game including the appearance of the ten year old local boy, Patrick. &nbsp;Well, I will be out there again this coming weekend and another friend should be coming along so hopefully if everyone is up for it, it should be a decent size game if you all can make it out again. &nbsp;Looking forward to it. &nbsp;If anyone else is reading this, we keep having new people show up each game so anyone who is interested in playing around you are more than welcome to join, the rules are simple and once you get going its a lot of fun.

				# The Field -- A rectangular shape with endzones at each end. A regulation field is 64m by 37m, with endzones 18m deep.<br /># Initiate Play -- Each point begins with both teams lining up on the front of their respective endzone line. The defense throws (&quot;pulls&quot;) the disc to the offense. A regulation game has seven players per team.<br /># Scoring -- Each time the offense completes a pass in the defense's endzone, the offense scores a point. Play is initiated after each score.<br /># Movement of the Disc -- The disc may be advanced in any direction by completing a pass to a teammate. Players may not run with the disc. The person with the disc (&quot;thrower&quot;) has ten seconds to throw the disc. The defender guarding the thrower (&quot;marker&quot;) counts out the stall count.<br /># Change of possession -- When a pass in not completed (e.g. out of bounds, drop, block, interception), the defense immediately takes possession of the disc and becomes the offense.<br /># Substitutions -- Players not in the game may replace players in the game after a score and during an injury timeout.<br /># Non-contact -- No physical contact is allowed between players. Picks and screens are also prohibited. A foul occurs when contact is made.<br /># Fouls -- When a player initiates contact on another player a foul occurs. When a foul disrupts possession, the play resumes as if the possession was retained. If the player committing the foul disagrees with the foul call, the play is redone.<br /># Self-Refereeing -- Players are responsible for their own foul and line calls. Players resolve their own disputes.<br /># Spirit of the Game -- Ultimate stresses sportsmanship and fair play. Competitive play is encouraged, but never at the expense of respect between players, adherence to the rules, and the basic joy of play.

				What a glorious weekend it turned out to be.&nbsp; Results are as follows:<br /><br />Saturday, Megc joined me for some tossing of the disc and we met up with some folks from off board.&nbsp; We ended up with a game of four on four and four on five with an all time offense player.&nbsp; It was a blast.&nbsp; Boy am I sore.<br /><br />Sunday, not as good.&nbsp; Jtrane came out to toss and newbie, Eric(sp?), joined in later.&nbsp; It was a great afternoon and felt good to get some long haul thows in.<br /><br />So what&#39;s on tap for the coming week?&nbsp; The Saturday group from off board says they will be out at about 1PM on Saturday.&nbsp; For those wanting to play a real game, this might be the best shot until the Sunday group forms up again on a consistent basis.&nbsp; Haven&#39;t heard much from the Sunday folks lately.<br /><br />So, special shouts out to Caroline, David, Saturday Eric, Chris, Wayne, Lou, and everyone else I met and can&#39;t remember the names at the moment.&nbsp; Can&#39;t wait until we play again.&nbsp; Hope I&#39;ve recovered by then.

				Today&#39;s game was a lot of fun.&nbsp; Hooray Team Loki!&nbsp; We rock.<br /><br />So we&#39;re kicking around the idea of a start time for tomorrow and 11 came up due to possible weather issues later in the day.&nbsp; What say you all?&nbsp; Please, someone, post an opinion? *chirp chirp chirp*&nbsp; Ok, guess not.&nbsp; Anyway, it&#39;s 11AM unless we agree to something else.

				Ultimate (with me anyway) will be sometime late Sunday afternoon.&nbsp; I&#39;m thinking 4ish.&nbsp; As an added bonus there will also be morning ultimate on Monday.&nbsp; I&#39;m thinking 11ish for that one.&nbsp; Come on out and get your disc on.<br /><br />Oh, and lets hear some chatter on this thread.&nbsp; I feel like such a lonely voice in the ultimate wilderness. :cry:<br /><br />We really do have fun games.&nbsp; Honest.&nbsp; I don&#39;t really have any imaginary games in my head....Do I, Harvey?

				I&#39;ve consulted my magic 8 ball (no euphemism there) and when asked if there will be ultimate at 11AM on Saturday, it says &quot;all signs point to yes.&quot;&nbsp; So be there or be square.&nbsp; I will be square tomorrow.&nbsp; Keep in mind that this is the rain or shine crew.&nbsp; I&#39;m going to cry if I miss another rain game.&nbsp; It sounds like a blast.&nbsp; Alas, the whole could be like tears in rain anyway.<br /><br />Sunday weather looks like it will cooperate with regards to an afternoon game.&nbsp; Let me tell ya kids.&nbsp; Uncle Telly ain&#39;t goin&#39; back out in that 90+ degree weather in the late afternoon anymore.&nbsp; Telesphoros + heat stroke = A tall glass of water in New Orleans + Hurricane Katrina.&nbsp; If I can play hung over, so can you.&nbsp; Be prepared for more early games.<br /><br />To recap, game on for Sat.&nbsp; Probable game on for Sun. in afternoon.&nbsp; No virginal sacrifice necessary to get weather to cooperate now means more virgins later for use in the winter.&nbsp; Praise be to Quetzacoatle.<br /><br />

The other is slightly smaller but heavier 180gms- with what seems to be rubber on the side- But it&#39;s a fast little sofanabitch.<br /><br />&nbsp;Anyway Saturdays for me are&nbsp; better than Sundays(work on Sundays).

				Alright, I&#39;ll bite...finally. <br /><br />I have some memories of getting yelled at my ultimate frisbee team in high school gym class for my limited hand/eye coordination. <br /><br />But I love ultimate frisbee and haven&#39;t had the nerve to come out and play in years. So...if the beach doesn&#39;t work out this week I think I&#39;d love the workout if you&#39;d welcome a total newbie. I can throw. I can run. i can sorta catch. I can be enthusiastic about a game as long as no one yells at me.

				Yeah, I love the pre-game frisbee chucking.&nbsp; Ain&#39;t no way I can play actual Ultimate, but it&#39;s fun to watch, and I like being at the park on a Saturday morning. I think I&#39;ll make this a weekly ritual, provided others will join me as it&#39;s hard to throw a frisbee to oneself, particularly if one does not own a frisbee.&nbsp; Plus, it&#39;s more fun if you delightful people show up!&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />I&#39;ll wear sunscreen next time, though.&nbsp; This is one wicked sunburn!!&nbsp;

Loved being able to use the glow in the dark disc at the end. I have been leaving it out to &quot;charge up&quot; for the next time. Fortunately we all left with our salads intact.<br /><br />This coming weekend will follow the same drill.<br /><br />Saturday&#39;s game starts at 11AM rain or shine.

				Okey dokey kids. Saturday was a blast as usual. Two great complete games. Such a good time. Can&#39;t quite describe how much fun we manage to have.<br /><br />Anyhow, just want to put it out there that the game is still on. Yours truly will not be partaking unless we get an alternate day and time in place, but I wish those of you who do play all the best. Have a great time!

				Ok, just the typical weekly update. Game on as usual for 10/21. Saturday at 11AM. Same bat time, same bat channel.<br /><br />I alas will miss a second week in a row, but it can&#39;t be helped.

Only the color of our shirts will tell the tale on the field of battle, ach.<br /><br />Hellgate Bridge is at the north end of the park. It is the bridge closest to Ditmars. We generally congregate under the bridge to start, but as soon as enough people show up to toss the disc, we get warmed up. Pretty easy to spot us generally. Depending on the prior night&#39;s alcohol consumption, we start at or a little after 11AM.<br /><br />If you are inclined to get your thirst quenched, it would be best to bring some water as the park has shut down the fountains for the season.

				The holiday week is upon us and many of us are out of town for the weekend. This means the game won&#39;t be nearly as large as it could be, but doesn&#39;t necessarily mean there will be no game at all. If you are interested in playing, post up and try to meet up with like minded disc fanatics. There is some interest amongst some off board people. As far as this board goes, Uncle Telly&#39;s not your organizing bitch this week. See you in the first weekend of December, though. Happy Thanksgiving everyone.

				100% chance of rain on Saturday. Guess what? That&#39;s all kids. I officially declare official Astoria Park 2006 season complete. Of course feel free to generate some random pickup games on your own. Stay tuned for such exciting announcements. Otherwise, have a great holiday season. Stay safe. Stay skinny.

				Many thanks to those who came to the ultimate party. Good to see you all. Was nice to pine a little for the start of the next season with fellow fanatics. Just a couple months to go most likely. <br /><br />In the meantime, please, everyone join me in idling your cars for long periods of time and making jackrabbit starts and leaving&nbsp; on your lights and not recycling. With your help, we can make New York City ultimate friendly year round within our lifetime! {This paragraph has been brought to you by the letter S.

				Where was everybody!?!? <br /><br />It was almost perfect weather for frisbee, cool and dry and sunny. A consistent East River breeze made for some wacky throws, but it wasn&#039;t bad at all. I hope the weather wasn&#039;t the reason people didn&#039;t show because it was gorgeous.<br /><br />Wonderful game of ultimate (final score was 16-14, with just about everybody rotating through both teams&nbsp; :lol:). Smaller ensemble (4x4) with only Alex, Lilly, and I showing up from last week&#039;s group.

Go home, change, and show up, Tradeology. We&#039;ll put you right into a game when you arrive. :-)

				This week there will be a game on Sunday, 6.24 (as well as Saturday), you should try to make that if you can. 10:00 start both days (though the bigger game on Saturday generally starts at 11:00).

It&#039;s this whole Winter thing. ;-)

				Yes. Check out the Hellgate Ultimate Frisbee group on Why Leave Astoria. They practice on Tuesday and Thursday evenings and have games on Saturdays indside the track at Astoria Park at 11 AM. My husband and I once walked by it and stopped to watch and they just invited us to join right in. Really friendly group - we&#039;ve been planning on going back if all this rain would go away!
