				Does your employer have a credit union? Did your college have a credit union open to alumni? It&#39;s almost always cheaper and more pleasant to go with a credit union if you can! I&#39;m still happily a member (not victim!) of the University of Illinois Employees Credit Union. The only drawbacks about not having a local bank are that on those rare times when I need to deposit a check, I have to send it via mail which takes a few days (or use an ATM that accepts deposits, which is also very slow, and more expensive than a check), and I have to use out-of-system ATMs. Fortunately, McDonalds&#39; ATMs are on the Co-op Network, meaning the machines don&#39;t charge me a fee, but I still have to pay $1 per withdrawal to the credit union. (This is the only reason I go to a McDonalds!) I&#39;ve also had a good rate on an auto loan through my credit union, and I get a Visa card through them (although the APR&#39;s not the best). <br /><br />Aside from that, I&#39;ve heard relatively good things about Commerce.

If you need someone to smile at you when you enter your bank, then go local. If you travel, and need to use ATMs a lot, go big.<br /><br />I bank with Citibank. No, I am not happy, but I am loyal. They meet *all* my criteria. I opened my checking account with them when they were First National City Bank in 1960, when I was 16 years old and leaving for college. They have branches all over the world. Wherever I traveled to, they had a presence. That was very important to me. Converting currency or withdrawing cash whenever I needed to was a great influence in my staying with an impersonal financial institution. It has also had a few fringe benefits. I got terrific rates on car loans, consolidation loans and educational loans. I also have a 6.5% interest rate on a MasterCard which I hardly ever use, and their Preferred Money Market accounts now have a 5.50% APR. <br /><br />My sister always changed banks to get better deals. So did my parents. Remember all those freebies? They supplied the whole neighborhood with toasters and glassware! Just don&#39;t pick a bank based on its proximity to your workplaceâ€”find one nearer home.<br />

				I have been banking with Commerce Bank for 2 years now and I am really happy with them. The branch on Steinway is a bit of a nightmare- very crowded- but the bank its self is great. They have great hours (open late and on weekends) and there seems to be quite a few branches in Manhattan as well as in Queens.&nbsp; So far there have been no hidden charges-which is always a plus and they have a coinstar machine to count your extra change (for free!).<br /><br />

				I use Bank of America, which has a branch on Steinway near Broadway.&nbsp; Their basic checking account is free with direct deposit and they also have free student accounts, which was a big draw for me.&nbsp; The lines at the Steinway branch can get a bit long at times, but I only ever have to line up when I get quarters for laundry; everything else I do by ATM and I&#39;ve never had a problem finding ATMs in Manhattan.&nbsp; The only drawback is that it takes a while for deposited checks to clear, up to 5 days or so.&nbsp; But maybe it&#39;s the same at other banks too.

				I&#39;m seriously thinking about switching to Washington Mututal. Commerce has been a good bank to me, but I got a CSR that was really rude to me one time because I went in to get a new card after they had misspelled my name on my debit card. She was just really rude, like it was some huge deal and I was ruining her day by asking for a new card with my name on it. I&#39;d have just kept it except that if you try to use it online and your name doesn&#39;t match it sometimes doesn&#39;t work.<br /><br />I&#39;d avoid North Folk Bank at all cost. With few exceptions they are a really unprofessional bunch there.<br /><br />I&#39;m very interested in finding out about this 5.5% Money Market fund at Citi that NYCMac is talking about.

It&#39;s actually a 6 month CD at 5.50% APY. Still worth looking into, especially if you are in a position to let a chunk of money sit for a while without any risk in original principal. I generally do this with liquid assets as a forced savings. Should the need to withdraw early arise, I still have not lost anything and I may have earned more than if left sitting in a regular savings account at a measly 0.2%â€“.0.5%. <br />(https://web.da-us.citibank.com/images/sd/CD_files/6MonthCD_banner.gif)<br />Most banks will offer special rates for large deposits. These are generally called jumbo accounts. They will also offer long-term customers special high(er) rate savings and/or Money Market accounts. I have banked online for at least 10 years. Citibank used to have proprietary dialup software before they moved to the internet. I transfer funds, pay bills, open accounts . . . heck I do it all. The *only* time I ever walk into a bank is to use the ATM. I hate lines. BTW, I am also a great fan of ING. I have them linked to my Citibank accounts so that I get a high(er) rate of day-to-day savings interest. This combination has worked very well for me.<br /><br />Dirk, are you finding this thread as amazing as I am? You asked a pertinent little question and people are so willing to fess up to the reasons they use a bank. I always thought that money was such a personal force in our lives. Perhaps it was in mine. Now I am noticing that how I/we are treated takes on a larger aspect!<br />

				NYCMacUser - I am finding the thread very interesting, and I think you&#39;re right, our perceptions are very much colored by how we are treated by any institution, it either engenders warm feelings, which would make up for some lesser service, or we are treated poorly, or ignored, which makes it hard to stick with a good deal.&nbsp; It&#39;s been fascinating (and quite informative about banks!)&nbsp; I have an ING account myself, they&#39;re very good.&nbsp; I did America Bank for a while too, they had very good rates and I did everything online.

				To respond about North Folk, I just have had more than one occasion where I was treated really rudely. One time I went in to make a significant withdraw and they were hassling me to not withdraw it but to keep my money there. They were trying to sell me a &quot;high yield savings&quot; account. I don&#39;t want to be &quot;sold&quot; when I go to the teller.<br /><br />Then there was the time I had to dispute a fraudulant charge on my debit card. They acted like it was a huge deal and I had to ask a manager to bring me the dispute form. Sure enough, it took like 10 minutes, but in the long run they lost me as a customer altogether.<br /><br />I&#39;ve used ING for a very long time and like them very much. However recently I&#39;ve switched to Emigrant Direct (http://www.emigrantdirect.com). They have a little higher interest rate, and link to your checking account just like ING. I&#39;ve been happy so far.

				my wife and i own a small business which started out as freelancing. because of this direct deposit is next to impossible and thereby the &#39;free&#39; checking that most banks offer doesn&#39;t apply. we started with citibank because we wanted the convenience of atm&#39;s all over town. but since our income is so variable we often had to pay a $7.50 service charge per month for our accounts.<br /><br />before any of the other new &#39;free&#39; banks showed up we decided to give greenpoint (now northfork) a chance. it was quick and easy to set up a checking and savings account and they truly have no minimum balance requirements. i&#39;ll admit that their service is rough around the edges and their check clearing policy is slow and baffling. but it seemed our best alternative given a universe of bad ones.<br /><br />last year we decided to incorporate our company and thought that it was finally time for a change. with our business license in hand we walked into commerce and waited a good while for a csr. when we finally got one she looked at us like we were absolutely crazy and had to find a manual to figure out what was required to create an account. sure enough we were missing something but they couldn&#39;t pinpoint exactly what that item was. we left vowing never to go back.<br /><br />a trip to northfork and we had a business checking account.<br /><br />that said, no bank is perfect (or even close). i find it is a matter of searching for the least evils that pertain to your specific situation. and banks do reward loyalty so if you find a good one, stay with it.

				I used to bank with Fleet, and was very happy with their service.&nbsp; Fleet got bought out by Bank of America a&nbsp; year or so ago, and I had so many problems with them that I finally closed my account a week ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you overdraft on your account, they go crazy with overdraft fees and will charge you for more overdrafts than you actually made.&nbsp; I went in at least 3 times to have them waive incorrect overdraft fees, in addition to a number of miscellaneous fees that would show up on my account online.&nbsp; (they just hope you don&#39;t read your bank statement and won&#39;t bother to dispute the fees) Often even when I went into the bank they couldn&#39;t decipher what some of the fees were for.&nbsp; Their in store staff are very nice and helpful, but the people on the phone are HORRIBLE.&nbsp; It takes forever for checks to clear, checking accounts cost $12 a month, and if you use a non Bank of America ATM they will charge you $1.50 in addition to the fee that the ATM will charge you (making an out of system ATM withdrawl cost from $3-5).&nbsp; <br /><br />I just switched to Commerce, and my checking account is free (free checks too), they don&#39;t charge me $1.50 for out of system ATM withdrawls, and I havn&#39;t experienced any unexplainable fees.&nbsp;

				Well the great news about Commerce is that you can certianly deposit your husband/wife&#39;s checks in their account, or your account or whatever no problem. You can also sign the back of your checks with Mickey Mouse and they&#39;ll still deposit it. Not sure that&#39;s a good thing, but has made it a lot easier on me.

				Online banks are best for secondary deposit accounts -- as jennifer points out your money is not easily accessible. I had an ING money market acct but found the log-in process cumbersome. I&#39;m using VirtualBank now. The benefit is that they have no &quot;real&quot; presence so their costs are lower. They pass the savings on to their customers. <br /><br />BTW, you can check for current savings, checking, and money market rates at http://www.bankrate.com (http://www.bankrate.com).

				I looove Commerce. Great hours and unlike the evil Wachovia (aka Walk-Over-You) they don&#39;t charge you for using other banks&#39; ATMs. In fact, I hear that if you have a certain amount in savings, they refund you the ATM fees charged by non-Commerce ATMs.

I had a Republic account that was then bought out by HSBC, and i had this account for about 5 years. then i added my soon-to-be ex husband&#39;s name about 4 years ago. now in order for me to get his name removed i have to completely close the account. what? i have a payment that is taken out of the account and it&#39;s such a pain to get to a branch to close it and then change the payment set up that i&#39;m just leaving it until the payments are over. then buh-bye.<br />North Fork is even worse. and a friend of mine works there-transplanted greenpoint employee-and he can&#39;t stand it. they took away the month or so of sick time he had accrued w/o a payout or anything b/c they don&#39;t roll them over like greenpoint did. then of course he dislocates his shoulder and had to take unpaid days off. they stink to high hell. the only reason i use them is that they bought out the bank where my dad&#39;s social security checks go. i pay his nursing home with that. so one deposit in and one check out. use the atm card when i need to buy him things. the only reason i have kept this account is that no bank will let me open one unless i drag him in. well, truth be told when i was solely banking with HSBC (i wanted one stop shopping, i&#39;m lazy) they are the ones who said i needed to bring him in. despite me saying he is in a wheelchair b/c of a brain anneurism(sic). i explained it was a simple social security account, lots of people set these up to take care of their elder parents in this situation. but no, i have to bring him in. w/valid ID no less!! you can&#39;t renew a state ID unless you go in person! perhaps i will try commerce...then again that means dealing with changing the info with social security. and 2 years after my bag was stolen, and multiple requests and forms, i still have not received a replacement atm card. good thing i don&#39;t need it that much. north f**ked up is more like it.<br />

				You know, I know a lot of people think that they&#39;re not eligible to join a credit union, but chances are, you can. Finding one might take a little bit of poking around, but go here: http://www.creditunion.coop/ (http://www.creditunion.coop/) and search under &quot;Locate a Credit Union&quot;. I clicked on this one: http://www.nymcu.org/ (http://www.nymcu.org/) at random, and to become a member, you must be one of the following:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">*&nbsp; A New York City employee<br />* A Federal or State employee who works in the five boroughs<br />* A Health Care professional (private or public) working in New York State<br />* An employee of an insurance company that offers health related insurance in the State of New York<br />* An employee of a private college located in the City of New York or an employee of a private or public college in the counties of Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester<br />* An employee of the City of Yonkers<br />* A member of certain private industry groups</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#39;s a pretty broad spectrum of people, when you think about it, and a lot of credit unions also extend membership to members of family or the household of people who are eligible, so, depending on the credit union, if your roommate or someone in your family is eligible, you are too.<br /><br />A lot of CU&#39;s have much more lenient membership policies too - the one I&#39;m a member of in CT (which used to just serve employees &amp; families of my dad&#39;s company) is now open to anyone who lives, works, or goes to school in Fairfield &amp; New Haven Counties in CT. So EVERYONE is SW CT can join, and once you&#39;re a member, you are always a member, no matter if you move or switch jobs or whatever (this is true for all CU&#39;s).<br /><br />Anyway, if its not obvious, I love my credit union. Yeah, there&#39;s no branch down here that I can go to so I have to mail checks to be deposited (which, for me, is usually within a couple days), and I have to use out of network ATMs. But the ONLY fees I&#39;ve ever, ever, ever paid are other banks $1 or $1.50 ATM fees. I don&#39;t have to pay for checks, I get free everything, they do online banking, the loan rates are quite good, and every time I&#39;ve talked to someone (including the time that another bank&#39;s ATM shorted me $40 - I went into the bank and told the manager and she basically said &quot;not my problem,&quot; so I called my CU and they refunded it without question), they&#39;ve been friendly and helpful.<br /><br />

				Been following this thread of posts and was wondering the following?<br /><br />which of the banks (besides WAMU which doesn&#39;t offer) has overdraft protection as part of their standard checking account? <br /><br />when your income is down to the wire covering rent and basics (ahh, the life of a social worker), it&#39;ll be nice not to get stung with $30 overdraft fees every time i&#39;m in the red <br />

Instead of getting charged about $25 for bouncing a check, overdraft protection will in effect provide the account holder with an instant loan.

				There are several local banks where there is good service and very short lines, (lower banking fees) Ponce DeLeon Federal Bank, on Broadway and 35th Street. First Central SB on 30th Ave and 36th Street, Marathon National Bank, Broadway and 31st Street, Ridgewood SB at the shopping center on Ditmars Blvd and 42nd Street (i think) and Alma Bank of NY 31st Street and Newton Ave.
