				What&#039;s with the 5 A&#039;s? Message board threads aren&#039;t listed alphabetically, y&#039;know. Also, you&#039;d probably get more people interested in the blog if you said something beside it&#039;s just a food blog. What makes it different from all the great food blogs I already use to guide myself around Astoria restaurants?

				I also thought the AAAAA was obnoxious.&nbsp; As for the blog:&nbsp; I like the look and the photos are clear and colorful.&nbsp; But start reading and suddenly you notice the spelling and grammar issues.&nbsp; Just not a nice flow to the reviews.&nbsp; It needs polish.&nbsp; But I like the look overall.&nbsp; Why isn&#039;t it Astoria Knife &amp; Fork rather than New York?

				Thanks for the advice and comments already!&nbsp; You guys are quick.&nbsp; We chose NY instead of Astoria because we want to grow the site and maybe expand it at some point.&nbsp; Astoria knife and fork would be a limiting url/brand.&nbsp; <br /><br />www.nyknifeandfork.com

				In response to your question, practical, what sets the site apart is that the person writing it is a professional writer.&nbsp; She is a full-time speech writer at the United Nations and does a brisk freelance business in copy writing for various companies and websites.&nbsp; Not that those qualifications necessarily make her a good writer, but I think she&#039;s really good.&nbsp; I&#039;m just the admin of the site really.<br /><br />www.nyknifeandfork.com

I don&#039;t comment on this. I commented on it in the blog because they asked for our opinions. Part of what makes new or a blog good reading that is meaningful to me is the quality of the writing. You can comment and say that you think that it doesn&#039;t matter on this particular blog, but I think it is rude to attack someone&#039;s honest critique and not even offer your own.

However, in that case, &quot;tell me what you think&quot; could&#039;ve just been edited into the first post. <br />And no, I do not actually think this is an issue.&nbsp; :-P<br /><br />And yes, I do think the grammar/spelling could be improved on the blog. It has the tone of being written by a professional writer (like for New York or L magazine or something) without the editing and proofreading that usually come along with it. It makes it kind of hard to read, in my opinion. It&#039;s an honest response, and I don&#039;t know why anyone should think that&#039;s a problem when the person came here and asked for thoughts about the blog. Maybe the writer doesn&#039;t realize the mistakes are slipping through. I would think, as a professional writer, she would want to know that.

				I happen to agree with the critics. A professional writer should be able to stand up to the feedback. In other words, they are expected to write professionally&nbsp; :roll: *Especially* when working for the UN, although maybe speeches are written phonetically? I dunno.<br /><br />If one person is doing all the reviewing/writing, I would be skeptical. And if they&#039;re a poor writer to boot, I wouldn&#039;t have the patience to read the website. Would prefer a variety of opinions written poorly, to one person&#039;s opinions written poorly.

				Hi Everyone,<br /><br />Thanks for all the feedback, most of which was delivered in a very constructive and objective way.&nbsp; The remainder of the comments veered into uninformed/non-productive territory so, as a writer, they ranked pretty low on the relevance scale for me. <br /><br />In response to some of the comments, I&#039;d like to address the grammatical issue.&nbsp; As a professional writer, I must adhere to strict editorial standards that are pretty universal across the publishing field.&nbsp; That is my day job and I couldn&#039;t be happier to operate within the confines of those rules.&nbsp; However, just as we all change clothes at the end of the day (I hope), I also like to stretch my legs a bit and use a more colloquial tone when I&#039;m writing for a personal outlet like NY Knife and Fork.&nbsp; Otherwise, the line between paid labor and creative outlet become hopelessly blurred.&nbsp; Simply put, while spelling mistakes are never really acceptable, more playful and conversational styles are how I contribute my voice to the symphony of foodie conversations on Astorians.com.&nbsp; <br /><br />Yes, there are fragments.&nbsp; Yes, there are slang terms, pop culture references and even the occasional text message abbreviation.&nbsp; Consider them the Tourette&#039;s syndrome of an overly plugged-in generation, whose ranks I&#039;m glad to join.&nbsp; &nbsp;The point is that my writing style is constantly evolving as it is honed through the lens of my experience and sensibilities.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad your comments are now an additional ingredient in my writing process.&nbsp; <br /><br />As new members of this community we’re dedicated to keeping the conversation elevated and constructive by refraining from mean-spirited criticism that serves only to incite, rather than inform or entertain.&nbsp; Try to keep up.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Again, I appreciate all the well-intentioned feedback.&nbsp; Cheers!<br /><br />-Marissa<br /><br />

				Marissa, the response is appreciated. Just so you know, people aren&#039;t referring to the slang and colloquial language. They&#039;re referring to stuff like this: &quot;Their tilapia is eyebrow-raising in its freshness remains among their most popular dishes&quot; and &quot;The duck breat is overly fatty.&quot; Good luck with the blog.

				&nbsp; I am disappointed that this thread has turned into such a battle.&nbsp; I posted the topic initially as a way to draw some readership to the site and to get some constructive feedback.&nbsp; www.nyknifeandfork.com is a site that we created in order to serve and be more involved in the community here in Astoria.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; Instead, we now have a bunch of comments that make it sound like this is the worst blog ever, when in reality, it had a few typos and nothing more.&nbsp; There are no sentence structure errors.&nbsp; All fragments and informal language usages are stylistic and intentional.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; Thank you to those of you who did give constructive and tactful feedback.<br />&nbsp; I would like to point out that some of the comments you made, paratactical, were adversarial.&nbsp; From not believing my response to your question, to turning language around on the moderator when she tried to alert you to how you were coming across.&nbsp; I&#039;m not mad.&nbsp; I assume that you did not mean to offend and were likely unaware of it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I just want you to know that it happened, so you can be aware of the problem and maybe even work towards improving in this area of social competence.<br />&nbsp; In my estimation, improving interaction on this site is a goal we are all invested in.&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br />www.nyknifeandfork.com

				Often times, words can be misinterpreted on a chat board.&nbsp; Sarcasm and tone can be hard to detect and understand.&nbsp; &nbsp;One&#039;s choice of words can set the overall tone of the post, so it&#039;s important that one think about they&#039;re posting, choose their words wisely, and review what they&#039;ve written before posting.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think this would be helpful for <em>all of us</em> to remember.<br /><br />Also, this post was moved to the business section of our site a few days ago.&nbsp; Not everything is caught right away and we often don&#039;t have the time to monitor/tend to threads continuously due to work and life obligations.&nbsp; In the future, should you have an issue you would like to report to the moderators, please use the report to moderator link at the bottom of the posts.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks all,<br />Daisy<br />Moderator

If you do not want criticism, do not ask for it, simply advertise and move along.

				Actually both &#039;ketchup&#039; and &#039;catsup&#039; are accepted and correct spellings.&nbsp; I believe &#039;catsup&#039; is the older term, maybe even a bit outdated but I like it.&nbsp; <br />(http://pigeonbeaks.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/hunts-catsup.png)<br /><br />Maybe we should start a food linguistics thread?&nbsp; etymology, pronunciation and that stuff?&nbsp;

				what is this?&nbsp; A website for hipsters?<br /><br />&nbsp;I actually checked it out and its pretty cool, but the writer doesn&#039;t seem to post that frequently and all the posts are just reviews.&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t this be better as a database than as a blog?&nbsp; Anyway, good luck with the site.&nbsp; &nbsp;The layout and art look cool.<br />
