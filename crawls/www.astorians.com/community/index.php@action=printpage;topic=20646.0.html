Putting that aspect aside, what would you expect to pay for a similar meal, eaten and served in the context of a date? I&#039;m honestly curious, since I don&#039;t eat out much, and only splurge on meals out once in a while (this does not include take out) I thought the pricing was par for the course.

				I&#039;ll bring it back on track.<br /><br />My wife, our little Nugget, a couple of friends and I went at 5pm today to celebrate the opening of Pachanga.&nbsp; <br /><br />A quick review:<br /><br />The decor and set up is very Vesta-like, with neat artwork on the walls and cozy seating arrangements - with a Mexican twist, of course.&nbsp; There is space in the back that will be used as a &quot;garden&quot; for the warmer times.<br /><br />It was great seeing Joe and Leo, the owners, and Michelle Vido popping out of the kitchen.&nbsp; It&#039;s like visiting old friends in a new apartment.&nbsp; <br /><br />They&#039;ve got a guy, I think his name was Don, set up behind the bar exclusively who made excellent drinks and kept the 90s rap going to keep the &quot;pachanga&quot; atmosphere flowing.&nbsp; I had a &quot;Boludo&quot; and my friends had Margaritas, all very, very tasty drinks.&nbsp; The man makes a good drink.<br /><br />And, finally, the food.&nbsp; The food!&nbsp; Excellent.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m a fan of Vesta so I&#039;m probably biased, but the food was damn good.<br /><br />We started with a Tomatillo and Avocado salsa and some Guacamole, both good.&nbsp; They came with chips that were outstanding.&nbsp; <br /><br />The four adults each ordered a different set of tacos.&nbsp; Between the four of us we had the short rib tacos, the fish tacos, the mooshoo duck tacos, and the pork shoulder tacos.&nbsp; All four of us walked away raving about the food.&nbsp; The ladies seemed to really love the mooshoo duck tacos.&nbsp; My wife called them &quot;out of this world.&quot;&nbsp; Our friend Bob would not share his short rib tacos; he grunted his approval with a mouthful of meat.&nbsp; <br /><br />I fell in love with the pork shoulder taco.&nbsp; With my wife sitting in front of me, and my six month old baby in his seat to my left, all my attention was on the tasty, crunchy pork in front of me.&nbsp; My weakness is crunchy, fried proteins.&nbsp; They put toasted pork skin bits in the taco!&nbsp; Love.&nbsp; Pure love.<br /><br />We topped it off with a panacotta with peanut brittle on top and a Little Devil cake (like the Baby Jesus cake, just a little darker).&nbsp; The Panacotta was nice and the Little Devil cake had a delicious essence of chocolate.&nbsp; Nothing will take the place of the Baby Jesus cake for me, but for chocolate lovers this might have more appeal.<br /><br />Overall, I think they&#039;re off to a really good start.&nbsp; These folks know their food, know about atmosphere, and know how to treat their customers well.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking forward to visiting again.&nbsp; MMmmm, pork shoulder tacos...<br /><br />&nbsp; <br />

				we ate there last night and it was pretty good :)<br /><br />the plates are small so we tried a couple of different things which is what everyone else there seemed to be doing also<br /><br />we had the enchilada to start then tried the duck, pork and short rib tacos..everything was very tasty.. my only complaints are that the little salad that comes with the tacos was VERY salty so salty I couldnt eat it and since the space is small they are cramming tables in there. <br /><br />Prices were reasonable.<br /><br />All in all we really enjoyed the food and are looking forward to go back to try some of their other stuff.

				I&#039;m sure it couldn&#039;t be that Pachanga means party and Patterson is 31st Ave&#039;s name before Astoria went to the number grid system. Surely, your definition is much more logical.

The staff was super friendly and the decoration was nice and simple.<br /><br />Guacamole &amp; House-Fried Corn Tortillas -The guacamole was tasty but I prefer it chunky. <br />Steamed Mussels, chorizo, corn &amp; jalepeno - My husband ate most of these and it was so good he even asked for a spoon the get all of the sauce.<br />Chipotle Braised Short Ribs, roasted tomato, scallions - The meat was tender and juicy<br />Berkshire Pork Shoulder, crispy pork skins, pickled red onion- Simple, yummy and crunchy<br />SANGRIA- Not too sweet and the fruit was fresh<br />Chocolate cake- The only items I thought was just ok. <br /><br />Can&#039;t wait to go back !

				Four of us went on Friday night and thoroughly enjoyed our dinner.&nbsp; The same welcome that somehow gets consistently extended by the staff at Vesta was also present on Friday night at Pachanga Patterson.&nbsp; Appealing design and good music.&nbsp; All enjoyed the food - both the crowd of meat-eaters, and vegetarian me.&nbsp; Plus, they (as does Mundo) serve Xingu beer, which is a major plus.<br /><br />Excellent addition to the neighborhood!

				I think they are better than taco truck. They use higher quality ingredients with more complex flavors. Plus, taco truck doesn&#039;t have fish tacos. I can&#039;t wait to go back. Yum!

				I&#039;ll throw in my two cents and two thumbs up about this place.&nbsp; I ate there last Thursday and enjoyed it very much.&nbsp; The guacamole was good, the chips were fresh and the tacos were amazing.&nbsp; The sangria really stood out as some of the best in Astoria.&nbsp; I like the atmosphere and the service was very good.&nbsp; I was surprised at how busy they were for a new restaurant on a Thursday night -- they must be doing something right.&nbsp; I would totally go there again.&nbsp;

				We had a really good meal here last night.&nbsp; I loved the stuffed chili appetizer, a roasted poblano filled with quinoa, couscous, and beans and covered with a walnut sauce.&nbsp; The filling has a coarse texture, rather like kasha, and the whole thing tasted great.&nbsp; Very much enjoyed the fish and moo shu duck tacos, and the sweet potato side is smooth, creamy, and surprisingly savory.&nbsp; We ordered the El Diablito cake to go, and it was graciously comped by the manager.&nbsp; The cake has a bit of a slow burn to it, so if you get it keep in mind that it will be a little spicy.<br /><br />We&#039;ll definitely be back!

				I went last week and over all was very happy.&nbsp; The prices were pretty reasonable.&nbsp; The guac was <em>almost</em> as good as my own.&nbsp; :wink:&nbsp; Nice and chunky with lots of flavor. The corn salsa was ok, but not particularly flavorful.&nbsp; I had a similar issue with the stuffed pepper.&nbsp; Nothing special about it, but love when people put quinoa to use.&nbsp; <br /><br />I went for the duck tacos for my entree and they were delicious!&nbsp; Loved it!&nbsp; The duck was nice and tender and the sauce was sweet and tangy.&nbsp; Moo shu to taco is definitely not too far of a trip to take and works great.&nbsp; Nice to have the taco touches like fresh radish on top.&nbsp; Made for a nicely balanced taco.&nbsp; Would definitely go back...

				Tried Pachanga Paterson on Friday and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was.&nbsp; Ordered the Guacamole (not bad but not my favorite), duck tacos (delicious and still thinking about them), short rib tacos (pretty good), and pulled pork torta (really good).&nbsp; I am a die hard taco truck fan and this place won me over.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard to compare the two because these aren&#039;t street tacos.&nbsp; This is a cool place to sit down and grab a bite to eat as opposed to the taco truck which is like crack after a few beers (steak quesadilla...mmmmmmmm).&nbsp; Another good addition to the neighborhood!!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I had a nice dinner here with my friend Friday night.&nbsp; I won&#039;t be redundant here echoing everyone&#039;s love for the tacos.&nbsp; They are excellent and the food is awesome.&nbsp; What I will say is that this is a small restaurant and it&#039;s too small for the amount of people who want to eat there.&nbsp; Its popularity isn&#039;t fun for those who wish to sit back and enjoy a meal.&nbsp; I definitely want to go back but I&#039;ll go on a weeknight when it&#039;s not as busy.&nbsp; There&#039;s barely any room to maneuver in there so depending on where you are sitting, you will be bumped all night by people trying to get by.&nbsp; It can be hard to enjoy your food amid all the commotion.&nbsp; And the busboys were a bit aggressive about clearing the plates.&nbsp; Put your fork down for one second and they&#039;re already trying to bus the table.&nbsp; I had to guard my plate and I hate that - you end up feeling rushed.&nbsp; I understand they want to turn over tables, but at the same time - let me eat, lol!&nbsp; We didn&#039;t even bother with dessert, it was so uncomfortable.&nbsp; So, while a nice place and I loved the food, I&#039;ll go back when they&#039;re not so mobbed.

				Another vote for Pachanga Patterson.&nbsp; Went there with a friend this past Saturday night because we&#039;d had tough work weeks and needed something festive to take the edge off.&nbsp; This place was the cure for what ailed us.&nbsp; I had margaritas which were pretty good but the short rib tacos were mmm mmm delicious.&nbsp; My friend had the Moo Shu Duck tacos and they were quite good, but not as good as the short rib tacos in my opinion.&nbsp; Service was attentive and friendly, atmosphere was fun, and the place was jumping when we left around 9 that night.&nbsp; I will definitely be back.&nbsp;

				We were there Saturday night as well.&#160; We got there early (6.30) on purpose because we had a toddler with us, and we got the last table available without a 20 minute wait.&#160; It was clear as we ate that they were absolutely slammed, and there was probably a minimum of half an hour wait the entire time we were there.<br /><br />We found the food to be excellent, the drinks (El Boludo, Pachanga Margarita) were very good, and the service was friendly and not annoyingly rushed despite the crowds.&#160; We had the trio of salsas with chips to start, and the veggie jenga, duck moo shu tacos, and pork belly enchilada as entrees, with a shared side of pureed sweet potato.&#160; The jenga looked enticing (and actually perfect as a brunch entree), I had had the duck tacos a couple of weeks ago (and they were awesome), and the pork belly enchilada was a knockout.&#160; The chocolate and fig mole with the enchilada was outstanding.&#160; The sweet potato puree was possibly the best I&#039;ve tasted and hinted of lots of butter.&#160; We finished the meal by sharing a piece of diablito cake, and we all agreed that it was a great ending to a delicious meal.&#160; I find the Baby Jesus cake at Vesta too sweet for my taste, and the restrained sweetness of the diablito cake is perfect.&#160; It lets the mild chocolate and aromatic spices come through beautifully.

				We tried the Moo Shu duck tacos and Chipotle Braised short rib tacos. Both were super tasty but I liked the short rib better. I was sad when I was done! The guac was phenomenal--chunky w/a little spice. For drinks I tried the Anticuado and the Pachanga Margarita (which is pink!) both very good. Staff was friendly.<br /><br />Downfall was we got there around 9 on Saturday and had to wait 30-45 min. They were super busy and getting drinks and the check took a little long. We were there for over 2 hours and not b/c we eat that slow. The place is pretty small so standing there was sort of awkward b/c we had to keep moving to let people in/out and the waiters go by, while trying not to bump the people sitting in the head. BUT the host (?) gave us free drinks while we waited. <br /><br />I would definitely go back

				We had a very good experience when we went (which I think was a random week night of their first week), but tried to go back last night and it was mobbed.&nbsp; It&#039;s not their fault that it&#039;s busy and I understand that they have a small space and need to make money, but I don&#039;t think we&#039;ll be back after 7pm because I just can&#039;t stand eating dinner right on top of other people.&nbsp; I really, REALLY hate the &quot;cram as many tables as you can even if it means nobody can get to their chairs, and forget about wait staff being able to move around&quot; NY restaurant scene.&nbsp; Ugh.<br /><br />Anyway, the food was very good (HUGE plate of mussels!) and our waiter was awesome.&nbsp; It is true that despite being busy, they do not rush you out (the bus boys left us alone when we went).&nbsp; It&#039;s a good addition to Astoria but the lack of space is a huge deterrent for me.. same with Mundo and Locale.

				So artgirl and I just tried this place and really liked it.<br /><br />We had the good luck to snag the corner of the big banquette in the back, so space wasn&#039;t a problem. The place was basically full at 7 on a weeknight, but there was no line and we didn&#039;t have to wait for a table at all.<br /><br />We started with cocktails: Death in the Gulfstream (kind of a souped-up gin and tonic with bitters) and the Tanteo Mole Manhattan (sort of a chocolate Manhattan). Both were very good. My Manhattan was quite intense, a more serious cocktail than it sounds. But as I&#039;d hoped, it worked well as a sharp counterpoint to our mellow shared starter:<br /><br />The black bean soup, which was one of the best I&#039;ve had. Smoky and rich, with nice grace notes from the lime sour cream. Pretty big, too, for six bucks. I could make a light meal of that and some chips and salsa.<br /><br />Then we shared three taco orders: the short rib, pollack and duck. The duck was our least-favorite; it was good, well prepared, but didn&#039;t scream &quot;duck&quot; and (we agreed) needed something, maybe another sauce (maybe orange, says artgirl). The other two were awesome. The short rib had some heat, with what I called vinegary and artgirl called peppercorn heat. The pollack had some great onion flavors going on, and I&#039;m not usually a huge onion guy. I will definitely be eating those last two tacos again.<br /><br />We chased that with a liter of sangria, also great. We could really taste the fruit and wine and rum in balance.<br /><br />Finally we took home an order of the diablito cake. Definitely a worthy evil twin to Vesta&#039;s Baby Jesus. The icing-slash-syrup on top was almost a &quot;cake gravy,&quot; well integrated and complementary to the cake. I had it with Frangelico (our own stock); I&#039;m thinking it would go very well with maaaaany other such things.<br /><br />Our server was friendly and attentive. The busboys didn&#039;t hustle stuff away too soon (as some have complained above), though I can&#039;t say how that would go on a really busy night, since it wasn&#039;t overflowing when we were there.<br /><br />Bill was a hundred before tip. <br /><br />Already looking forward to returning.

				...what el squid said :)<br /><br />Regarding the duck taco... it did feel like it was missing something. I think some kind of spicy chipotle orange sauce would round it out nicely, and serve as a balance to the richness of the duck.<br /><br />Simple as it sounds, I&#039;m still thinking about that black bean soup. The texture of the liquid part was velvety smooth, without that grittiness (for lack of a better word) that you usually get with black bean soup. And the pile of super thin crunchy tortilla strips in the middle was a nice contrasting texture. El squid and I shared the soup as a starter, and I think I said &quot;ok, this is my last bite&quot; about 20 times.

The musical term &quot;overtone&quot; is sometimes seen in a similar function.<br /><br />I probably stretched it too much, because the sour cream and lime tastes are actually both fairly strong and straightforward in that soup. A subtle spice used in the tortilla strips on top -- maybe that would be a better example of a metaphorical grace note. And the sour cream and lime would be ... uh ... a third and a fifth? OK, I&#039;ll stop now.<br /><br />Anyway, good soup!

				Went here last night with my wife.&nbsp; The guac was pretty good as were the homemade chips.&nbsp; <br /><br />I had the braised short ribs tacos and my wife had the ancho pollock tacos.&nbsp; <br />The short ribs were really really tasty, but the pollock was extremely bland.&nbsp; Neither the fish nor the batter really had any flavor to speak of whatsoever.&nbsp; <br />The toasted garlic rice was pretty good. <br /><br />We also had a liter of sangria and it was very good as well.<br /><br />The el diablito cake was one of the best desserts I&#039;ve ever had.&nbsp; My wife had the caramel crepes which she enjoyed, however when she had a bite of the cake she immediately regretted not getting it.<br /><br />We sat out back and the patio was really nice, but the chairs are some of the most uncomfortable chairs I&#039;ve ever sat on in my life.&nbsp; Even though it was a wonderful night out I kinda wished we had chosen to sit inside because my ass was really sore halfway through dinner.<br /><br />My biggest problem is that I think the place is too expensive.&nbsp; Perhaps it&#039;s just me, but I generally associate Mexican with being inexpensive.&nbsp; I know this place is about local sourcing and is not straight up &quot;Mexican&quot;, etc., etc.,&nbsp; but 89+16 tip for two people is pretty up there for what is essentially a gussied up taco dinner (and taking into account the blandness of the fish).&nbsp; The liter of sangria was $24 (must be the locally sourced fruit :-) ), but even if you take that out, still up there.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was good, but if I&#039;m looking to spend in that PP range for dinner I would probably go somewhere else.<br />

				So, finally got around to trying this place with three friends last night, and I find myself somewhat on the fence. <br />First the space, service, and general vibe was pretty right on. It&#039;s a nice space, our server was attentive without being overbearing, the music was there, but not overly noticable. All plusses. <br />Then there&#039;s the food.&nbsp; We started with chips and guac.&nbsp; The guac, while fresh, was nothing that couldn&#039;t be replicated at home, and certainly didn&#039;t live up to the $9 price tag. Unfortunately, I think that pricing issue was the theme throughout the meal. <br />For round two we all split the mussels, which were good, and I loved the chorizo broth. I would say that was probably one of the high point of the meal for me. <br />For a main course, we split a bunch of tacos. The only ones we didn&#039;t get an order of were the bean tacos. Here is my impression:<br />Mu Shu Duck: Absolutely delicious. Unfortunately, nobody at my table tried one of these but me, so I think they missed out. Tangy pickled stuff, with the sweet fatty duck just hit the spot for me. <br />Vietnamese Pork Shoulder: These were only okay. Someone in our party complained about the meat tasting like lamb, but I didn&#039;t get that at all. That said there wasn&#039;t much to it, I didn&#039;t really taste the vietnamese marinade, or the siracha, and I had to add hot sauce for flavor. <br />Lamb: My first bite of the lamb contained something so sour that I was immediately turned off, but I finished the taco, and by the end I was enjoying it a bit more, but that first bite was just off putting. <br />Pollack (aka fish): I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s just that pollack is exceptionally mild, but I couldn&#039;t taste the actual fish, but only the batter and the fry grease. I was underwhelmed. <br />Portobello: I don&#039;t particularly care for portabellos, so I passed, but didn&#039;t think it was a good sign when, at the end of the meal only one was eaten. <br /><br />We passed on dessert, and got the check, which for a party of 4 wound up being $115 (we also had 2 beers and a pitcher of sangria). For a meal of tacos, chips and guac, and mussels that&#039;s steep to me, especially as I still think that the tacos that are being put out by the taco truck are better overall tacos than what PP is putting out. And I get that PP is doing forward thinking tacos, fuzing other cultural elements and using fresh / seasonal / local ingredients, but I only found 1/4 to be worth ordering again, based on the price and flavor. <br />All in all, I seemed to have the most positive reaction in my group. My girlfriend swore that she wouldn&#039;t go back, and honestly, for the price and other options for tacos in the neighborhood, I can&#039;t fault her for that. I&#039;m in no rush to go back, myself, which is quite the opposite reaction from what I had when we visited Vesta.

				I had a similar impression; while the food and service was decent, it wasn&#039;t nearly as good as Vesta. I had the short rib tacos which were ok, but not that memorable...and while they weren&#039;t expensive at $9, I&#039;d rather get just 2 (instead of 3) and have them come with some kind of side dish. My wife had the fish tacos which she claimed were overpowered by the onions (I didn&#039;t try them). Enjoyed the sangria, the diablito cake was excellent, but I didn&#039;t have as positive an experience as Vesta, which is admittedly a high bar, in my opinion. Will definitely give PP another shot and I am happy it&#039;s in the neighborhood, just may not make my rotation of restaurants.

				Based on many of the glowing reviews of Pachanga on this board, I tried it last night, and absolutely loved it.&nbsp; What a great addition to our neighborhood.&nbsp; Based on a number of the reviews here, I went in preparing to be unhappy with the bill, wary of the overaggressive busboys, and cramped in the space there.&nbsp; I was pleasantly surprised to find a reasonable bill and comfortable accomodations.<br />&nbsp;<br />My dining companion and I ordered one order of guacamole and chips, black bean soup, moo shu duck tacos, a side of sweet potato puree, one margarita each, and a dessert, all of which came out to $57 before tip.&nbsp; I thought that was fair, especially considering that the drinks were $17 of the total.&nbsp; And the tables, while somewhat close together, did not make me uncomfortable, and I did not feel that anyone was in my space.&nbsp; Finally, I found the service to be brisk but not overbearing.&nbsp; The waitress was very personable and friendly.<br />&nbsp;<br />And most importantly, the food was incredibly delicious.&nbsp; The guacamole was very mild and had large chunks of avocado, just the way I like it.&nbsp; I do agree that it should cost less than $9.&nbsp; The homemade chips were very unlike any others I had before -- they were very thick and crunchy and not too greasy.&nbsp; The black bean soup was smooth and tasty.&nbsp; I enjoyed the crunchy tortilla chips on top.&nbsp; The duck tacos were also delicious and not too fatty, although they could have used a little more flavor to them.&nbsp; I agree with an earlier commentator that an orange type of sauce would be called for.&nbsp; I think hoisin sauce is supposed to be in the tacos, but perhaps not enough was applied.&nbsp; The sweet potato puree was delicious, and the el diablito cake was outstanding.&nbsp; It had a slight kick to it from the chili sauce, but not enough to need to drink after each bite.&nbsp; However, a sip of water did cool things down.&nbsp; It had the perfect amount of sweetness.<br />&nbsp;<br />I&#039;ve been debating as to whether I like Pachanga or Mexi Q better, and it&#039;s a difficult call for me.&nbsp; Does anyone have an opinion on that?&nbsp; I&#039;m just glad to have both in the neighborhood.<br />&nbsp;<br />Overall, I am really excited about Pachanga and can&#039;t wait to bring friends to try the place.

				Just tried the brunch at Pachanga.&nbsp; I was pretty impressed.&nbsp; $10 gets you an entree and a drink (mimosa, bloody Mary or sangria).&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t include coffee, which is points off I know, but the coffee is really good, strong and unlimited for $2.50 -- c&#039;est la vie.&nbsp; &nbsp;Overall, for $12.50, I thought it was a great value.&nbsp; I&#039;d go back again (and hopefully sit outside when it&#039;s actually acting like late Spring).&nbsp; I like that the menu is very different from the usual brunch stuff.&nbsp; <br /><br />Take a look: <br />http://pachangapatterson.com/brunch-menu.html<br /><br />It gets my vote.&nbsp;

				&nbsp;<div style="text-align: left;">Artgirl and I went back Monday night for our second visit, and overall had another fine and fun meal, repeating some favorites from last time and trying some new things.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><ul class="bbc_list"><li><strong>The Pachanga Sangria (apples, oranges, mango juice, rum, full liter $24):</strong> Again, flavorful but not too sweet. I ate all the boozefruit lustily.</li><li><strong>Black Bean Soup (“BB Soup”) (lime-sour cream, crispy tortillas, $6):</strong> A favorite last time, the soup itself was equally rich, smoky and flavorful this time, though there seemed to be less of the lime sour cream, or maybe it had just broken up more into the soup. We missed attacking the big dollops that had floated on the previous edition, which really set it apart, and we later told our server, who said she’d tell the chef. I’d definitely go for it again, but I might ask for “extra lime cream” (or possibly “more grace notes”). I reiterate that this big bowl and a drink and maybe some chips and salsa could be my lunch or a light supper most days.</li><li><strong>The Stuffed Chili (roasted poblano, quinoa, cous cous, cranberry beans, walnut cream sauce, $6):</strong> I feared this might be rather dry and cardboard-y with all the grainy stuff listed, but it was a very good starter. The single large pepper was spread open and flat, with the stuffing on top and the sauce mostly underneath and alongside. The overall effect of the grains was kinda like a toasty, savory breakfast cereal with beans, which (like much else here) is slightly offbeat but in a good way. The pepper itself, sometimes an afterthought in stuffed peppers, stood up well, tender and tasty. The sauce was great, it was like sweet cream for my Mexi-Wheatena. Today I realized I might have enjoyed a kick to this dish; maybe I’d dash on a little of the hot sauce from the table bottle next time.</li><li><strong>Steamed Mussels (chorizo, corn &amp; jalepeno, $8):</strong> My favorite dish of the night. The delicate mussels in the broth with charred bread for dipping would be a fine dish in itself. But then you find, and scoop up, some of the many corn kernels and chorizo bits under the broth … mmmmm. Among the many ways people do mussels in a broth, this is instantly one of my favorites. This dish is listed as a small plate, but as artgirl notes, you get a fair number of mussels, and the corn makes it more substantial, so it’s suitable as a smaller entrée. And it’s awesome.</li><li><strong>Roasted Pork Belly Enchilada (chocolate, fig &amp; peanut sauce, cumin crema, $14):</strong> When I first tasted this dish, the bright, sweet, peanut and fig flavors of the sauce jumped out at me and seemed a little strange. Digging down into the tortilla, which had its own distinct flavor, and the extremely tasty pork itself, it all made somewhat more sense, with the chocolate blending into the umami element, though it still didn’t seem a totally logical combination. Artgirl liked the pork a lot but said she found the overall dish “perplexing” and probably wouldn’t want a whole plate of it. I agree that it’s a little off the wall, but I think that’s part of the point at this place, these unexpected, slightly thrown-together juxtapositions. I enjoyed the madness. I’d order it again and embrace my perplexity. You make the call!</li><li><strong>Panna Cotta (peanut brittle crust) (desserts not on written menu, but recited by server):</strong> I’m a big fan of custardy desserts, and desserts with savory elements, and this is a good example of both. The custard was firm enough to be substantial, but was smooth, creamy, and not too sweet, with a floral overtone&nbsp; :grin:&nbsp; that we were told was a Mexican flower. The brittle was basically just perched on top, and was quite salty as well as sweet. A fine complement to the dishes we’d eaten.</li><li><strong><em>Other stuff:</em></strong> We arrived early, like maybe 6:45, and the place was only about a quarter full, not surprising for early on a Monday evening. Artgirl had a banquette seat, and I had a chair, which wasn’t plush or anything, but didn’t cause me any discomfort. The backyard was open and seemed thoroughly set up, and a large party trooped out there shortly after our arrival and seemed to enjoy themselves. The place was nearly full when we left, but I never felt squeezed or jostled. As has been observed by other commenters, the plate clearing was somewhat overly zealous, and I had to thwart it more than once, though I suppose that’s a good sign too, since I wanted to finish everything!</li></ul></div><div style="text-align: left;"> </div>&nbsp;

They both had interesting flavors to them that you don&#039;t expect from your usual panna cotta and chocolate cake, which made it all the better.<br />Guacamole - I thought this was really flavorful and it was gone quickly, although the chips were pretty much rock-solid. <br /><br />CONS<br />Black bean soup - my mother had this and I have to disagree with what others have written. It was seriously overwhelming and I was sick of it after two spoonfuls. I also have an embarrassingly low tolerance for spice and this was definitely the spiciest of the things we ordered.<br />Pork belly enchilada - I had this, and it was eh. some bites were pretty good, some weren&#039;t. I didn&#039;t like the whole peanuts and one bite I took was basically a huge mucusy ball of pure fat. They need to take out some ingredients because it&#039;s really puzzling.<br /><br />Service was ok, the busboy ignored us for the first half of the meal although he was very attentive to the people next to us, strangely enough. Then I think I scared him or something because he refilled our water every 3 minutes after I asked.<br /><br />Nothing was terrible, but I hope they fix up some things because the space is really cute and quirky, especially the back area.

				I finally went for dinner here and I thought it was pretty good.<br />The guacamole was really good.<br />The pork tacos with the long beans was amazing!<br /><br />

				We finally tried Pachanga, fully expecting to love it. We were disappointed. After a below average starter (poorly made guac and stale chips), somewhat above average tacos (duck and pollack - solidly good but missing that &#039;wow&#039; factor that make us want to return), and stellar desserts (El Diabalito cake and panna cotta with pumpkin seeds were the real stars), we decided it really wasn&#039;t worth the time or money to return there for dinner when we could visit Vesta and get a fully amazing meal from start to finish for the same price.

				We&#039;ve been there twice, both times with friends and our very young (and well-behaved in retaurants) daughter, and we loved it both times.&nbsp; Great food and service, and the staff were all very accomodating and didn&#039;t get freaked out by our baby.&nbsp; Both times we went early, ahead of the dinner rush to not get packed in, and to not risk bringing the baby to more date-oriented hours or crowd, and I was glad to see that they were doing a good business even at those hours, and the layout was roomy enough that we didn&#039;t feel trapped.&nbsp; It is a great place, and I am glad it is in the neighborhood.&nbsp; (And, after two negative restaurant-related posts, I am glad to have something postive to say!)
