				(This is all totally fictional, folks.&nbsp; Or is it...)&nbsp; :evil:<br /><br /><strong>Selected Excerpts from Student Comments About My Poetry Course</strong><br /><br />The professor’s comments are difficult to read, and, I suspect, in another language.<br /><br />The professor scrunches up her nose when I write about daisies. As she does this I can see her top row of teeth which are both brittle and sharp.<br /><br />The professor refuses to recognize that I have levels. Levels within levels.<br /><br />The professor laughs loudly and frequently at nothing. Her laughter is like plates breaking on the floor of an infrequently used garage.<br /><br />The professor stares at me like she knows where I live.<br /><br />The professor suggested that if I wanted to be a poet I should take up truck driving and/or prostitution.<br /><br />The professor is silent and lays her head on her desk for long moments in class.<br /><br />The professor asked me to eat my pen.<br /><br />The professor asks us to use our imaginations, when she knows I am disabled and don’t have one.<br /><br />The professor often dresses from head to toe in a single, loathsome color.<br /><br />Sometimes the professor repeats one word over and over for nearly the entire class. I am unsure if this is a form of stutter or experimental poetry. Once when the word was “brackish” several students left the room and never came back.<br /><br />The professor encourages students to jump out the window.<br /><br />The professor has made me cry on several occasions when she was not even in the room.<br /><br />I signed up for intro chem.<br /><br />The professor offers us pieces of chocolate which are possibly poisoned.<br /><br />I have never met the professor.<br /><br />The professor sometimes claims to hear an alarm bell and rushes the class from the building, then disappears in the shrubbery.<br /><br />I suspect the professor’s intentions are impure.

				I&#39;ve taught at various places.&nbsp; Right now, I&#39;m teaching freshman at Rutgers.&nbsp; I&#39;ve taught poetry writing at the Women&#39;s Studio Center in LIC, too. :roll:
