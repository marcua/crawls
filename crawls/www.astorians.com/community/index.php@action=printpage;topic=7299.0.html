				Just noticed last night that Anna&#039;s Corner on 23rd Avenue and 31st St. is closed.&nbsp; I asked around and was told that it was sold to the folks who own Pinocchio on 30th Avenue.&nbsp; No word though on whether they will change the name or menu or when it will reopen.

				There is a sign that says Athens Restaurant but does anyone know whether it is indeed the owners of Pinocchio who own this now?

				The best thing about Annas was that they delivered a strip steak. most places that will even deliver a steak only have rib-eye or other such bone-containing meat. Which is fine if you like that kinda thing (which admittedly I sometimes do). AND they were the closest such place to my house.<br /><br />I poked my head in there a few weeks ago as they were renovating and they indicated it would be a different menu. I implored them to keep the strip steak though, and was met with some unenthused head nodding. <br /><br />It has a new banner up now, saying (I think) &quot;Astoria Taverna&quot; or something close to that.

				I think the awning outside now says &quot;Athens Tavern.&quot;&nbsp; I have no clue what the menu will be like.

				Found a blurb about it here on a local blog:<br /><br />http://astorianyc.blogspot.com/2007/09/annas-corner-is-now-athens-tavern.html<br /><br />Frankly, I&#039;m pretty underwhelmed by another seafood restaurant in the area. :| Anna&#039;s was awesome.

				Interesting.&nbsp; Hopefully if it does become a fish/seafood restaurant it will be better than the ones already in the area, not that they are bad, but having been to Greece, I know first-hand that there&#039;s a lot more that the Greeks know to do with seafood :)&nbsp; Psaromezedes...or little seafood appetizers....are just mindblowingly good, yet no one seems to have them here, other than the very bare-bones basics (grilled octopus, calamari, etc.).&nbsp; But even without all of that, I just hope whatever goes there is good.<br /><br />I liked Anna&#039;s Corner at first but at some point Anna (who is actually the wife of Stamatis...yes, of Stamatis restaurant just down the street) sold it, and the place under the new management just wasn&#039;t as good, it&#039;s like it lost a little something extra that was making it great.
