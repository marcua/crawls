				Just moved from Upstate, Ny where there were a couple of local scrapbook stores. Since I&#39;ve moved down here I haven&#39;t found any. Does anyone in the city scrapbook? Thanks.

				Try Michael&#39;s on Northern Blvd and 50th St area, it&#39;s just like all the other Michael&#39;s Arts and Crafts stores.&nbsp; Otherwise you&#39;ll have to go to Manhattan for anything else.

				Kate&#39;s Paperie in the city as well as Paper Presentation are too expensive.<br /><br />You can also shop at AC moore near forest hills, it&#39;s further away, but if you can&#39;t find something at Michael&#39;s you can find it at AC Moore.&nbsp; There is also Amazing Savings... which there are only a few stores open.&nbsp; There is one in queens in Kew Gardens, great stuff and realy cheap.&nbsp; Closed Saturdays!<br /><br />

				If you&#39;re willing to venture into Manhattan, I know a couple paper places you might want to check out...<br /><br />I took a bookmaking class at school last semester, and while its not a scrapbooking store, I shopped for a lot of my paper at New York Central Art Supply (3rd Ave at 11th Street). There are also a few of places on 18th Street between 5th &amp; 6th Aves - there are a couple big ones on the north side of the street, but I forget their names. Actually, the bigger of the two (the one with a second level in the back) had a pretty big scrapbooking section from what I remember, and lots of cool paper upstairs. Since I don&#39;t shop for that stuff often, I can&#39;t really comment on the prices, but the bigger one on 18th Street did have a lot of funky papers on sale when I wandered in, and the prices seemed reasonable for the size of the sheets.<br /><br />My advice would be to do your shopping at art supply stores (NY Central, Lee, Pearl, etc), rather than &quot;scrapbooking&quot; stores - it seems like specialty stores would charge more.
