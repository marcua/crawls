				Soda here.&nbsp; Where I come from in CA, it&#39;s soda, too.&nbsp; <br /><br />I find the use of &quot;coke&quot; for carbonated beverages to be so curious, and it seems so wrong to call something that isn&#39;t a cola, &quot;coke&quot;.&nbsp; Just one more thing I don&#39;t understand about Southern culture. But then again, I also don&#39;t understand the mass producing and canning of brains in white gravy either, something I&#39;ve only found in the the South (GA to be exact, at a Piggly Wiggly in 1989).

				Wait a minute - there&#39;s no such thing as &#39;soda&#39; or &#39;pop&#39;.&nbsp; It&#39;s Coke, just specify what kind (i.e. Sprite, Dr. Pepper, etc.)<br /><br /><br />Second, icing and frosting are two completely different things.

				Hi,<br />I&#39;m from New Mexico and I say &quot;soda pop&quot; (oooh fancy) but I think this may have to do with my dad who is from Wisconsin.&nbsp; I also say cuss, instead of curse (:<br />

				For symmetry, I&#39;m from Wisconsin, and I say &quot;pop&quot; or sometimes &quot;soda pop&quot; or (if talkin&#39; high-falutin) &quot;soft drink&quot;. &quot;Soda&quot; alone is a bit funny to me, and small-c &quot;coke&quot; is way funny to me. My parents are from New Mexico, though, and I know my mom and her family say &quot;cuss&quot; instead of &quot;curse&quot;, although I&#39;d probably say &quot;swear&quot;. (My dad&#39;s from NM, but his folks were from Albany and Brooklyn, and I&#39;m not sure what they&#39;d say...)<br /><br />Oh and anyone remember this (http://www.popsoda.com/faygoredpop.html)?<br /><br />(http://us.st11.yimg.com/us.st.yimg.com/I/soda-pop_1933_12430128)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=4950.msg51800.html#msg51800">Quote from: dakota on February 01, 2007, 11:44:58 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hi,<br />I&#39;m from New Mexico and I say &quot;soda pop&quot; (oooh fancy) but I think this may have to do with my dad who is from Wisconsin.&nbsp; I also say cuss, instead of curse (:<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I am constantly trying to figure out how to ask for seltzer when I am not in NY...<br /><br />here it&#39;s seltzer, no problem... <br />anywhere else people look at me as if I am from another planet and then I have to go through whole &quot;soda water?... club soda?... mineral water?... sparkling water?... carbonated water!&quot; thing
