				Take Root presents Treehouse Shakers performing Olive and Pearl, a special program for Young Audiences. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Olive and Pearl: Written and directed by Mara McEwin and choreography by Emily Bunning, is specifically created for the very young child, ages 2-5. Centered on thematic elements of home, it is the story of a young girl, Olive, who is lovingly being raised by her Granny, Pearl. Throughout their day Granny builds fires, warms tea, makes meals and has a comforting lap with safe arms to rock Olive to sleep. The characters play fairy house, go on an imaginary journey to the moon and learn the Jig. Metaphors of home are woven throughout the set and story with both puppets and movement. Home is not only the structure of one’s house, but the place one longs for. Magical, visual, stimulating, and oftentimes funny, Olive &amp; Pearl is a supportive performance first for the very young.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Olive &amp; Pearl is supported by Mertz Gilmore Foundation Late Stage Stipend facilitated through Green Space. It has received a National Endowment of the Arts Art Works Award and is also supported, in part, by public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council, New York State Council on the Arts with the support of Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York Legislature.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;“Treehouse Shakers is the Best of Manhattan”-Jennifer Merin New York Press<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;October 20th &amp; 21st 2016 at 11:00am <br />&nbsp;Admission: $15 <br />&nbsp;Green Space Studio<br />&nbsp;37-24 24th Street, #301<br />&nbsp;Long Island City, NY 11101<br />&nbsp;718-956-3037<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Tickets are available at the door or online at http://www.greenspacestudio.org/TakeRoot.html<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Take Root is a monthly curated series that supports dance makers by providing an opportunity to show a full evening work.
