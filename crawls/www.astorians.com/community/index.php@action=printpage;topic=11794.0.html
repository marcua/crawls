				Hi everyone!<br /><br />I just moved to Astoria and one thing that excites me about the area is all the Mediterranean food. In particular, I am on a quest to find the best falafel in the city. My first taste was at Athen&#039;s Cafe, which was a complete disappointment, considering how excited I was to have good Greek food. The falafel, though, was so fried that it didn&#039;t taste like anything and it was very dry. Then I happened to find some frozen falafel balls in Costco, which were pretty tasty for a quick and easy meal, but coming out of the microwave just isn&#039;t the same. Any suggestions on where I should try next? I&#039;ve seen signs for falafel all over the place, but do not know what to expect after my first two attempts.<br /><br />Thanks!

				I suggest the falafel at Pita Hot, on 30th Ave just off Crescent. <br /><br />There&#039;s also Mahmoud&#039;s falafel on 8th street in Manhattan - I think between 3rd and 2nd. I&#039;ve nearly always been able to find good falafel for lunch just by wandering around, especially in midtown. The carts are awesome. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure falafel really counts as &quot;greek&quot; or mediteranean. I think of it as more Israeli/Syrian/Palestinian/Eqyptian. It&#039;s definitely worth some sampling, though.

				The ones from Costco are much better if you pop them in a toaster over instead. The outside gets nice and crispy.<br />I haven&#039;t encountered yummy falafel in astoria yet, but I am hooked on the falafel at Mangal in Sunnyside. South side of Queens Blvd, on 47th street. Q104 conveniently leaves you on the north side of Queens Blvd on 48th street.<br />Their home made bread is orgasmically (sic?) good.

Less commonly, it contains turkey, beef, or a mixture of meats. Shawarma is a popular dish and fast-food staple across the Middle East, and is consumed across the rest of the world as well, being especially popular in Russia. Shawarma is known as guss in Iraq; it is related to the gyros of Greece. Gyro, however, are typically made of pork meat, or less commonly chicken, although beef or lamb is usually used outside Greece and Cyprus. The classic shawarma combination is pita bread, hummus, tomato &amp; cucumber, and of course the shawarma. The additional toppings includes tahini, and amba.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />damn, i&#039;m hungry now. <br /><br />This reminds me - I was visiting relatives in the netherlands.

				How do you shave a&nbsp; chicken?<br /><br /><br />I have been getting kabobs and falafel now and then from the Cedars Meat House, which is a Lebanese grocery &amp; take out place on 30th near 41st, (and hence, just round the corner from me.) I had just assumed for some time that it was a meat market, then lately noticed the grill. It&#039;s very convenient to hide out while my clothes tumble round in the excessively compact laundromat next to it.<br /><br />The guy there is nice. It&#039;s never very busy. The falafel has been tasty, neither overcooked nor mooshy, when I had it. But I am no expert on the stuff. If the difference between Lebanese, Moroccan, and Egyptian means something to you, you might want to include it in the rotation.

				The falafels at the Kabab Cafe (25-12 Steinway St) are probably the best, although the falafels at GyroMania (36th St just off 30th Ave) give them serious competition. In NYC the best is still Moshe&#039;s Falafel (kosher wagon on weekdays at lunchtime on 46th Str, just East of 6th Ave), with honorable mention going to Mamoun&#039;s Falafel in the Village.

				Alright now - I&#039;m a bit of a fallafel connoisseur.<br /><br />Mamoun&#039;s is always great if you are in the West Village (on Macdougal/W 3rd I believe) and there is also one on E 8 now, as someone mentioned. They&#039;re super cheap, but they serve smaller falafels too.<br />I tried Moshe&#039;s fallafel a few times but wasn&#039;t overwhelmed...it tasted oddly buttery or something. <br />Barahket, in the LES is consistently good - a Turkish spot. <br />As for local spots, the Egyptian guys with the cart on the corner of Steinway and 34th Avenue (it&#039;s near the 34th Ave exit on the Steinway stop) <br />never disappoint. They put fries and eggplant in there too.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br /><br />
