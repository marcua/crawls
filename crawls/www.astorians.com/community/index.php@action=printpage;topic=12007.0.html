				Someone just sent me this...its good for a giggle....<br /><br /><br />Top 9 unfortunate comments made by NBC Sports Commentators during the Summer Olympics:<br /><br />9) Weightlifter commentator: &quot;This Gregoriava from Bulgaria.<br />I saw her snatch this morning during her warm up and it was amazing!&quot;<br /><br />8) Dressage commentator: &quot;This is really a lovely horse and I speak from personal experience since I once mounted her mother.<br />&quot;<br /><br />7) Paul Hamm, Gymnast: &quot;I owe alot to my parents, especially my mother and father.<br />&quot;<br /><br />6) Boxing Analyst: &quot;Sure there have been injuries, and even some deaths in boxing, but none of them really that serious.<br />&quot;<br /><br />5) Softball announcer: &quot;If history repeats itself, I should think we can expect the same thing again.<br />&quot;<br /><br />4) Basketball analyst: &quot;He dribbles alot and the oppostition doesn&#039;t like it. In fact you can see it all over their faces.<br />&quot;<br /><br />3) At the rowing medal ceremony: &quot;Ah isn&#039;t that nice? The wife of the IOC president is hugging the cox of the Brittish crew.<br />&quot;<br /><br />2) Soccer commentator: &quot;Julian Dicks is everywhere. It&#039;s like they got eleven Dicks on the field.<br />&quot;<br /><br />1) Tennis commentator: &quot;One of the reasons that Andy is playing so well is that, before the final round, his wife takes out his balls and kisses them... Oh my Gawd, What have I just said?&quot;<br />
