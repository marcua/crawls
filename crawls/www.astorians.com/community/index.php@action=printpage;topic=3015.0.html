				Fine, I admit it.&nbsp; I was peer-pressured into seeing the premiere 10PM showing last night.&nbsp; And yes, it&#39;s just snakes that are on an airplane.<br /><br />(http://www.blackfilm.com/i3/movies/s/snakesonaplane/004_l.jpg)

				This is about the dumbest idea I&#39;ve ever heard of for a movie.&nbsp; <br /><br />But is that why people will go see it?

				well, to be honest - when that above picture (in my first post, if it&#39;s loading) was circulating, with blatantly fake/rubber snakes, I felt like it was a must-see.&nbsp; but, unfortunately, there&#39;s simply tons of CG-generated snakes, and it&#39;s a tough film to watch close to 100% sober.

				This movie was made as a joke.&nbsp; The producers never meant for it to be taken seriously.&nbsp; You should check out some of the interviews with Sam Jackson about it.&nbsp; I think it&#39;s almost like they were proving a point...<br /><br />&quot;Let&#39;s come up with the stupidest premise for a movie EVER.&nbsp; I&#39;m sure someone will bankroll it for us.&nbsp; And the amazing thing is that people are stupid enough to go see it!&quot;
