								<div class="inner" id="msg_17354">Happy Independence holiday to all. Will sadly miss fireworks again this year.<br /><br />See below from the land of the Orange Curtain. (My answers are fairly predictable.)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/opinion/homepage/article_1183902.php" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/opinion/homepage/article_1183902.php</a><br /><br /><br />***<br /><br />Sunday, June 18, 2006 <br /><br />Test your freedom IQ<br />As July 4 approaches, ask yourself how well you understand the principles upon which the nation was founded <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Are you a rock-solid freedom lover, a closet authoritarian or an in-your-face socialist? Take the Register&#39;s first Freedom Quiz and see. It&#39;s devised with new graduates in mind, to help them understand their political philosophy as they head out into the real world or back into the not-so-real world of academia. <br /><br />Register editorial writers Alan Bock, John Seiler and Steven Greenhut developed these questions to highlight aspects of &quot;small l&quot; libertarianism, the freedom philosophy that animates our pages. We believe in limited government, respect for the individual, self-responsibility, free markets, free trade and property rights. Enough of that before we give away too much of our testing bias!<br /><br />This quiz is the first feature in our &quot;Summer of Freedom&quot; series, where we&#39;ll introduce you to proponents of the freedom philosophy, examine areas of liberty that are in jeopardy and explore American history, too. So, take the challenge and find out your freedom IQ. The &quot;freedom&quot; answers are on page 5. (Students who fail are advised to read the Register&#39;s editorial pages more thoroughly!)<br /><br />The role of government in your life and in society <br />1. A congressman said recently, &quot;Government can be a force for good in your life.&quot; Do you:<br /><br />a) Agree? You believe your taxes help the government identify the greatest needs in society and then solve those needs as it redistributes wealth in myriad ways. The government generally spends your money better than you do in these &quot;big issue&quot; areas.<br /><br />b) Feel confused, because you&#39;ve never really thought about the question, What is the proper role of government in my life?<br /><br />c) Disagree? Government&#39;s role should be limited, and individuals should be left on their own to be responsible and to seek their dreams and achievements for themselves and their families, which will lead to the greatest good in a free society. Free markets, churches, voluntaryism and other private efforts are much more effective at solving many big concerns in society.<br /><br />Free enterprise – profit, competition, certification <br />2. Martha Stewart should have gone to jail for life because she is part of the whole capitalist syndrome of greed, profiteering and corporate anti-environmentalism. Do you agree?<br /><br />a) Yes. She is evil, and capitalism would be even more so without the welcome check of government regulations and prosecutors like New York&#39;s Eliot Spitzer.<br /><br />b) Martha&#39;s real problem is an overweening personality that&#39;s just so, well, arrogant.<br /><br />c) No, Martha is not evil. Most charges were dropped. Profit is not evil, either; in fact, profit is the basis for new investment in products, services and technologies. Profit makes companies stronger, giving them access to more sources of investment from financial markets. And yes, a portion of profit goes to those who took the risk on management&#39;s ideas – shareholders. And like Stewart or not, arrogance is not a crime.<br /><br />3. A small coffee shop owner is upset that a Starbucks is moving into the same shopping center. The owner has organized a campaign to stop the new store from locating there. Such action is:<br /><br />a) Laudable. Small-business owners always are being driven out by the big corporate bully. Such a fight represents the struggle of average folks against corporate behemoths.<br /><br />b) Good to the degree that it represents the will of the people. If most members of a community don&#39;t want a Starbucks, then Starbucks should not open up there. Put it to a vote.<br /><br />c) Reprehensible. Companies should be free to compete as long as government doesn&#39;t get involved. Let the best coffee win.<br /><br />4. You discover the handyman who has been doing odd jobs around the neighborhood, including some construction projects, does not have a state contractor&#39;s license. Do you:<br /><br />a) Call the state licensing board and demand that he be put out of business immediately?<br /><br />b) Offer to study and take the written part of the exam for him so he doesn&#39;t get into trouble?<br /><br />c) Rejoice that someone is finding a way around the state&#39;s occupational licensing laws, which function mainly to reduce competition and raise prices for consumers while offering little if any real protection for consumers? <br /><br />If consumers believe they need an accreditation process for a profession, it could be accomplished privately, like an underwriter&#39;s laboratory for products or the college accreditation panels.<br /><br />Taxes <br />5. I&#39;m confused about taxes. Should they be higher or lower?<br /><br />a) Higher. Government is a great benefit to the people, and taxes should be increased so government can take on the most important tasks of society, be it health care, education or transportation.<br /><br />b) The size of government is about right, but it could be better managed and some waste can be cut.<br /><br />c) Lower. Government at all levels is too big and should be cut to fit a defined and limited number of tasks. Taxpayers should have first call on the product of their labors, not the government, and be able to spend, invest and save their earnings as they choose. The more areas of life we invite government into, the more coercion, irrational or rational, will be in our lives.<br /><br />6. Governments throughout the nation are facing alarming unfunded pension liabilities – i.e., the amount of promises to government workers to pay for their pension plans are far more than the funds earmarked to pay the tab. We should:<br /><br />a) Expand the pay and benefits for government workers, because they are so important to our success as a society, and hope investment gains cover the increases.<br /><br />b) Find some way to pay for the liabilities, perhaps by raising taxes or floating a pension bond. We don&#39;t want to do anything that would upset the government worker unions and precipitate a strike.<br /><br />c) Switch from defined-benefit plans that give public workers a promised percentage of their final pay (usually 80 percent to 100 percent) to defined-contribution plans (i.e., 401-k&#39;s) similar to those in the private sector. While we&#39;re at it, we eliminate or outsource as many government jobs as possible.<br /><br />Property rights: Eminent domain, view rights <br />7. A large retail company, such as Costco or Wal-Mart, has offered a city significant tax benefits if the city uses eminent domain to take an older strip mall of small businesses and give the big-box retailer the choice location. City Council members:<br /><br />a) Have every right to do so, and should proceed. After all, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld such takings in the Kelo decision last summer, and city officials need to maximize tax revenue on every plot of land. <br /><br />b) Should hire a firm to do a study and hold public meetings to see what the public prefers. If the majority wants the property for a big retailer, then the majority should rule.<br /><br />c) Should tell the big retail company to find another city to hornswoggle. Property rights are the foundation of American life – whether you&#39;re a single homeowner or Donald Bren – even if, in Kelo, a slim high court majority was too foolish to see it.<br /><br />8. A small city wants to save some hillsides as open space but doesn&#39;t have the money to buy the property from its owners. The city should:<br /><br />a) Increase taxes to pay for it. Preserving open space and habitats for an endangered gecko is important to the sustainability of the planet. Maybe a bond is a good idea.<br /><br />b) Simply regulate away most of the owner&#39;s development rights. If the city, say, reduces the number of homes that can be built on the land by 95 percent, it will gain the open space but will not have actually taken the property so won&#39;t have to pay anything for it. Problem solved. The good of the many outweighs the good of the few.<br /><br />c) Forgettaboutit. Property owners should be free to develop their land as they see fit, under existing rules and regulations they&#39;ve been living by. Cities should deal with their fundamental responsibilities and leave property owners alone.<br /><br />9. You live on a hillside with a great view. But your neighbor about three lots below has planted his yard full of tall eucalyptus and cottonwood trees, and your view has been damaged. Do you:<br /><br />a) Claim your neighbor&#39;s air as your &quot;view shed&quot; and demand the city council pass a view-protection statute that would have the government force your neighbor to cut down or top his trees?<br /><br />b) Ask your neighbor to cut down or at least top some of his trees – maybe even offering to help pay for it, or do it yourself – then go to the city to complain if the neighbors refuse to trim the trees?<br /><br />c) Even if he doesn&#39;t respond to your friendly gesture, you shrug your shoulders and figure it&#39;s his property, and he has a right to do with it as he will? So you keep your grumbles to yourself and maybe a few guests?<br /><br />d) Sneak into his yard with a chain saw while he is on vacation and cut down the trees yourself?<br /><br />Free speech, religion, civil liberties <br />10. You find out some of your neighbors attend a mosque (or church or synagogue) where disrespect for the U.S.government and anti-American sermons are the order of the day. Do you:<br /><br />a) Demand that the police shut the house of worship and demand that all houses of worship be licensed by or run by the government so this kind of nonsense can never happen again? <br /><br />b) Ask the zoning or planning commission to declare the institution out of compliance with regulations (or write new regulations outlawing hate propaganda) to force it to close?<br /><br />c) Figure tolerating a certain amount of foolishness is simply part of living in a free society?<br /><br />d) Start attending activities yourself to see if there is anything dangerous enough to report to the authorities going on?<br /><br />11. You are convinced that marriage between homosexuals would not only be disruptive of society but is morally wrong. Do you:<br /><br />a) Support a U.S. constitutional amendment to outlaw same-sex marriage?<br /><br />b) Do everything in your power to convince homosexuals you know not to seek marriage but suggest that a civil union that would grant rights such as inheritance and hospital visitation is an acceptable alternative?<br /><br />c) Use your powers of persuasion to get others to agree with you but decide that outlawing same-sex marriage is as unwise as making it mandatory, and question whether it should be the state&#39;s job to license marriage at all?<br /><br />d) Support a state initiative declaring marriage is only valid between a man and a woman?<br /><br />12. A newspaper publishes a story about a secret government surveillance program on Americans, based on anonymous government sources who were troubled by a program not authorized by the laws or the Constitution. Do you:<br /><br />a) Demand the leakers be found, that the leakers and journalists go to jail for a long time, and that laws against disclosing government secrets be toughened?<br /><br />b) Worry a bit about whether the anonymous sources were reliable or had an agenda, but figure it&#39;s good to know what the government is up to?<br /><br />c) Cheer that this information has been made public and consider the journalists and leakers heroes who have exposed information the government should never have been able to keep secret in the first place?<br /><br />13. Global warming may be caused by humans to such a significant degree that it is:<br /><br />a) A threat to the entire world and will bring on catastrophe, possibly within 10 years, as Al Gore, left, warns. Americans should be willing to take dramatic steps – i.e., more government regulation on fuel-wasting behavior, forced increased conservation to reduce greenhouse gases, investments in nuclear energy.<br /><br />b) An interesting and potentially frightening theory, and we should trust the politicians and experts to do what&#39;s best. They know more than we know.<br /><br />c) A theory of dubious substance. The Earth has been naturally warming and cooling over billions of years, and the degree of human contribution and impact is debatable. This is one case where a freer market will lead to cleaner industries, more fuel alternatives, and fewer problems from carbon dioxide or pollutants. Tax credits for new environmental technology and other incentives could reduce greenhouse gases enough to ward off a problem until newer technologies solve it for us.<br /><br />d) A problem that pales in comparison to global cooling.<br /><br />Transportation <br />14. The automobile is:<br /><br />a) Nearly satanic in the evil it foists upon society. Cars pollute and promote isolation and sprawl. Society should build more transit systems to replace car travel.<br /><br />b) OK, but we still need more transit. Government should force automakers to build cleaner and more fuel-efficient cars.<br /><br />c) A wonderful product of a free market, a reflection of individualism and freedom. Car and fuel taxes pay for more than their share of expenses related to transportation. We need more roads, preferably toll roads, to ease congestion, not crowded (or underused!) and overpriced transit systems.<br /><br />d) So important that we need to subsidize their purchase by poor people.<br /><br />War and foreign policy <br />15. Our government seems to get in a lot of wars without a declaration of war by Congress, as the U.S.Constitution demands. You conclude that:<br /><br />a) The Constitution is a &quot;horse and buggy&quot; document, as Franklin D. Roosevelt said, and in the space age, modern democracy and freedom demand more leeway in the actions of the chief executive to protect us.<br /><br />b) The age of terrorism demands quicker action to preserve our liberties than allowed by the Constitution. If the president needs to act decisively, he should do so and then later get the explicit approval of Congress for any military actions.<br /><br />c) Congress needs to re-assert itself and insist that only it can declare war.<br /><br />16. A country in Africa – one that has oil resources only partly developed – is ruled by a cruel dictator and is on the verge of civil war. Do you:<br /><br />a) Demand that the U.S. military be sent over to set things to rights – immediately?<br /><br />b) Demand a U.N. Security Council resolution, including economic sanctions, to be followed by the dispatch of a U.N.-authorized international conflict-resolution team?<br /><br />c) Contribute money to a relief fund with special expertise in helping refugees from this country&#39;s trouble? Other than that, consider it&#39;s someone else&#39;s country, not yours, and while the problems might be deplorable they&#39;re not something you or your government is called upon to solve. <br /><br />The Nanny State <br />17. Every year thousands of new laws are passed by Congress, the state Legislature and local governments, governing such things as shower water pressure, helmets for motorcyclists, smoking on beaches. Is this a good thing?<br /><br />a) Yes. Government has your best interests in mind, and its regulations have helped us have longer lives. These laws also help parents enforce their advice to children.<br /><br />b) Mostly. Although some laws could be pruned, most are needed to keep a complex, modern society functioning well.<br /><br />c) No. A nanny state law will never substitute for good parenting, self-responsibility and common sense.<br /><br />Gun ownership <br />18. The government can have my handgun …<br /><br />a) Any time the government chooses. I don&#39;t like guns, and I don&#39;t like people who like them. Government should ban them to improve the safety of all of us. <br /><br />The U.S. Constitution is a &quot;living document&quot; and what applied in the agrarian 18th century probably does not apply today. Besides, the founders were probably referring to militias having guns, not individuals.<br /><br />b) I don&#39;t have a handgun to give, though I wouldn&#39;t ban them. They should be tightly regulated by local, state and federal governments, however.<br /><br />c) When a government official peels it from my cold, dead fingers. Gun ownership by individuals is specifically allowed by the Second Amendment to the Constitution, and it was one factor in winning the American Revolution. It would be sensible to learn firearms safety before buying one, although government mandates aren&#39;t the most useful way to encourage safety.<br /><br />Education <br />19. I would like to attend a public high school that has particularly strong math program and that is located in another part of town, instead of the high school where I&#39;m currently enrolled. <br /><br />a) Your request should be honored only if the racial and ethnic balance in each school allows for such a transfer.<br /><br />b) Your parents should buy a home in that part of town to assure enrollment.<br /><br />c) Good idea, the educational system should treat you as an individual and let you choose your school, although an even better idea is to shut down the current system of public schools and let a free market of private choices emerge. <br /><br />Immigration <br />20. A person I suspect is an illegal immigrant does my landscaping. Should I …<br /><br />a) Call federal authorities to report the person and be sure he is deported. Join a group that seeks laws that particularly will curtail low-skill, low-wage immigrants coming to the United States in the belief that the workers are causing too much strain on American culture?<br /><br />b) Let it slide this time, but next time ask for proof of citizenship before hiring. Support local policies that might help further identify and deport illegals and otherwise make their lives difficult?<br /><br />c) Treat the individual as you would wish to be treated and support policies that would increase immigration quotas that are justified by market demand rather than arbitrary political decisions. Work to reduce the size of the welfare state, which is the real problem. Support border stations that would check for infectious disease and links to terror organizations. Support private programs that would encourage citizenship and assimilation?<br /><br />SCORING THE TEST <br />Thanks for taking the Freedom Quiz. The “most-free” answer was always ...<br /></div>
