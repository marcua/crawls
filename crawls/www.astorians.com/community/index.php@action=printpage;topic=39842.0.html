				Has anyone heard what the plan is while these stations are shutdown for 8 months? Will there be shuttle buses like the weekend shutdowns? This is making me really nervous...

				I live at the 30th Ave. stop and haven&#039;t heard about it. I&#039;d read about a plan to renovate all of the stations from 39th Ave. through to Ditmars,<br />but no specifics as to timing. <br /><br /><br />Since the city and the state can&#039;t agree on who pays for what, I can&#039;t imagine this happening anytime soon. <br /><br /><br />But I&#039;ve been seeing transit construction crews at my stop when I go to work in the morning because they&#039;re doing work during the day at non-rush hour times.<br /><br /><br />If I see them on Monday morning, I&#039;ll see if I can ask one of them and report back.

				I stopped and asked the station attendant what is going to happen, and he said he hasn&#039;t heard if there are any alternatives planned. He was actually really worried about his job and seemed frustrated as well. His advice was to call the mayor&#039;s office to express concern. This is going to make the other stops a mess. And those of us who live close to the 30th or 36th Ave<span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font">[size=78%] stations are going to have a long walk to alternative stations (especially when it&#039;s 20 degrees in January!) I know this is a bit of a first world problem, but I&#039;m still concerned. [/size]</span>

				The Q102 can be really good, but it doesn&#039;t run very often. That would be great if they would add more buses. I am going to contact the city. It probably won&#039;t make any difference, but it can&#039;t hurt.

				Wouldn&#039;t they do what they did for Brooklyn. Close the stations in ONE direction only? You can take it on the opposite direction for a stop or two, then change to the other direction to go back. No different when they work on the tracks now during the day.

				Maybe calling won&#039;t stop it, but we can ask them to help us out with extra buses or something. Transportation in Astoria already has its issues. Shutting down two major stations is concerning to those of us who rely on the subway every day. It may not help, but we can at least try.

It looks like the current thinking is closing a station entirely would lead to faster rehab times.<br /><br /><br />The 59 Street station R station was closed entirely and work was finished in less than six months and ahead of schedule. <span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font">The work on the Sea Beach line/N train stations is taking over two years. Work on the Manhattan-bound side finished in July. The Brooklyn -bound platforms are now closed until Fall 2018. I&#039;d rather be inconvenienced for 6 months than two years.</span>

				The 30th Avenue station was opened on Friday June 22nd. It looks pretty good. They added an additional exit stairway on the Ditmars bound side, but they added it on the north side of the platfrom instead of the south side. The main stairs are not in the center of the platform, but are closer to the north side. When the trains stop you have 3 cars of people using the front stairway, and 5 cars of people using the back staiway, which is why the south side ujsually gets bottlenecked and takes a lot longer for people to exit during the evening rush.&nbsp; Why didn&#039;t they add the new staiway on the south side to accomodate the exiting passengers like they did at the Broadway station? Did they ask commuters for their opinion? I see it as a lost opportunity to make people&#039;s commute smoother.
