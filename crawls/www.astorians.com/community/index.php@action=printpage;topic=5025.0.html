				<br />http://www.heartland.org/Article.cfm?artId=10582<br /><br />Utah House Passes Universal Voucher Bill<br />(Chicago, Illinois - February 2, 2007) The Utah House of Representatives today passed a landmark school choice bill, H.B. 148, that would establish the &quot;Parent Choice in Education Act.&quot; The law would provide every parent in Utah a voucher valued between $500 and $3,000 (depending on family income) for use at the school of their choice. The law would be the most expansive school choice program in the country.<br /><br />&quot;The Utah House vote is an important advance in the fight to provide parents with meaningful education alternatives,&quot; said George Clowes, senior fellow for education policy at The Heartland Institute. Although the maximum voucher is only half what Utah&#39;s public schools spend per student, Clowes said &quot;it will probably be sufficient to spur an expansion of existing private school capacity and the entry of new education providers.&quot; Clowes pointed out such growth has occurred in Milwaukee over the past decade, since its landmark voucher program was launched in 1990.<br />

				Maybe it isn&#39;t as big as this bill passed in Utah, but New York has a similar voucher system with private schools. A family can obtain funding for the school of their choice if they can support that the school will provide religious education that cannot be provided by the public school system and often exceeds 3,000, but I have to find the citation for this.

				I think the law should include Public Schools as well.&nbsp; It would definitely build up competition within the schools.&nbsp; At least NYC High Schools has a system sort of like this.&nbsp; Each kid has to apply to high school similar to the college application process.
