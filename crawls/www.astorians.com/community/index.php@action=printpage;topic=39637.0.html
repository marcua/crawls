				Stopped in last night and was told they are closing on February 10th.&nbsp; This breaks my heart as the entire staff has become like family over the years.&nbsp; Rumour is that the construction office for the project across the street will take over the space.

				This place used to be good but has gone downhill over the past few years.&nbsp; I won&#039;t miss them.&nbsp; The food isn&#039;t as good as it used to be

				I never liked this place after they did the renovation and put in those big uncomfortable booths.&nbsp; I used to love it before that

				I stopped in tonight and it seems there as been a change of plans and they are going to change one of the owners and stay open a little longer.<br /><br /><br />For those of you who feel it&#039;s gone downhill I encourage you to check out their rice and quinoa bowls - they are really terrific!<br /><br /><br />Glad to see this place is sticking around a bit longer!
