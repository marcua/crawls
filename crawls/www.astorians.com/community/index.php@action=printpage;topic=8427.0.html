				FEMA stages a fake press conference, then apologizes when they&#039;re caught.<br /><br />http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSN2636610020071026 (http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSN2636610020071026)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The main U.S. disaster-response agency apologized on Friday for having its employees pose as reporters in a news briefing on California&#039;s wildfires that no journalists attended.<br /><br />The Federal Emergency Management Agency, still struggling to restore its image after the bungled handling of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, issued the apology after The Washington Post published details of the Tuesday briefing.<br /><br />&quot;We can and must do better, and apologize for this error in judgment,&quot; FEMA deputy administrator Harvey Johnson, who conducted the briefing, said in a statement. &quot;Our intent was to provide useful information and be responsive to the many questions we have received.&quot;<br /><br />No actual reporter attended the hastily called news conference in person, although some camera crews arrived late to film incidental shots, officials said.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I feel safer already, don&#039;t you? How Orwellian is all this nonsense anyway?

				We can all open our windows and at the same time yell out, &quot;I&#039;m mad as hell and I&#039;m not going to take it anymore!&quot;<br /><br />But seriously, if the people don&#039;t vent their outrage, then the government will keep pulling crap like this. This sort of thing is what we used to mock other countries for, yet here it is happening in our country, and we don&#039;t seem to care. Why? 30 years ago this would have been a HUGE scandal, and would have made alot of heads roll, as high as the White House. <br /><br />Today people have become apathetic and ignorant, mainly because we&#039;ve allowed ourselves to accept manipulated news released by the corporate run press. Your alternate real news outlets are, PBS, NPR, BBC and still hanging in there to a certain extent the NY Times.

				Funny how we had NOLA and still didn&#039;t figure out that FEMA needed to be overhauled.<br /><br />The restructuring of that organization was one of the best things Clinton did in his presidency and it&#039;s a shame how quickly that was all laid to waste--and when we needed it the most, too.<br /><br />

				It&#039;s so absurd, but what can you do? I, for one, don&#039;t actually believe that <strong>anyone</strong> in the primaries now will legitimately try to change things and run a more open, honest government and, unfortunately, armed revolution is kinda out of the question.

				Plus that they called in an &quot;error in judgement&quot;. <br /><br />This isn&#039;t an error in judgement--an error is when a college kid gets drunk and sleeps with the girl his friend likes. This is deliberate, inaccurate and manipulative.

It&#039;s more likely the other way around, that Bush or his people told Chertoff to stage a softball press conference to make FEMA look good and competent.&#160; <br /><br />And so now the schmuck took the fall and &quot;lost his job&quot;, most probably for doing what he was told to do by his superior. <br /><br />Now they can say you&#039;ve done a helluva job Johnson.<br /><br />

				Oh, gosh! Did you guys see the Daily Show coverage of this last night? The clip they showed was hilarious.<br /><br />Reporter: So, do you think FEMA is doing a good job?<br />FEMA Rep: Yes, I think FEMA is doing a good job.<br />John Stewart (pretending to be reporter): Can I have a raise now?
