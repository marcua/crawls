				I just returned from a very interesting vacation out in San Diego. I arrived on Saturday and by Sunday there were two major wildfires burning in San Diego County and three others closer to Los Angeles. By Monday, the fires had increased to close to 10 major fires. By Tuesday, more than 50% of my hotel in La Jolla was filled with evacuees from all over San Diego County and the air throughout the city was thick with smoke and ash. I grew up on Long Island and remember one small forest fire out on the East End in the mid-1990s but nothing here can compare to what was going on in California over the past week. The devastation was unbelievable and there are investigations of arson for at least two of the fires. Thinking that someone could start a fire that burned over 200,000 acres makes me sick. <br /><br />I am not sure the kind of press coverage these fires were getting back here on the East Coast over the past week, but the fires were truly devastating. I was glued to the tv when in my hotel room, but seeing the panic first hand with the people in my hotel was even more hard-hitting. It was so sad to talk to the people in my hotel who didn&#039;t know if they would have a home to go back to once allowed back to their neighborhood. Evacuations were mandatory in many parts of the county, but imagine the &quot;choice&quot; of evacuation and safety or saving your home. It clearly wasn&#039;t an easy decision for most. <br /><br />I encourage you to help the victims of these fires by donating to the American Red Cross. Although there is some criticism of governmental response, I think the assistance of the Red Cross with the evacuations and the shelters was quite impressive in a time of need. I do not work for the Red Cross, but feel very strongly about this cause since I just flew in from San Diego today. Thanks. http://american.redcross.org
