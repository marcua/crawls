				There is a thread from June 2007, I had wanted to just bring that back up, but I only have phone internet for the next ten hours or so, so I can&#039;t search for the previous thread. <br />I just discovered Block island last nite. I know of at least 3 people on this board who have been, and I wil take the advice not to book seacrest in, but how crazy of an idea do you think it is to try to book next weekend 5/16 - 5/19? I was looking at maybe &#039;new Shoreham house&#039; I think the hotel is called. I also want to know what type of other ppl typicaly vacation there, I read somewhere that &#039;many visitors sail their own boats to block island for a weekend getaway&#039; or something, and im worried I might be incredibly out of place there.

				I was the one who had the unfortunate experience of staying at the Seacrest Inn.&nbsp; Ugh, how awful.&nbsp; As far as the type of people on the island -- There are definitely people with money, but there are also many nature lovers there.&nbsp; The island is so beautiful, cool birds, lovely ocean, rocks, sand, lighthouses.&nbsp; You can rent a bike - but be a biker, as this can get arduous and I was so very out of shape, it was pathetic.&nbsp; You can rent mopeds too.&nbsp; It&#039;s a great island to explore, and so relaxing.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t worry about feeling out of place.&nbsp;

				yea, im waaaaay too out of shape to bike around an island. how far in advance did u have to book ur trip? I actually already have plans to go to bear mountain, but the hotel won&#039;t let me make reservations so im not like married to that trip. I am curious about the mopeds cuz that sounds like fun, but im worried about the cost. I saw hotels for $100 a night, and im not above a shared bathroom for three days to save $20 a night. I also wanted input from real people because all the websites look so shabby!!! like someone&#039;s son with a high school web design class made em all lol! anyway I read on the ferrys website that if u want to book a car on the ferry that it should be booked 4-5 months in advance!! but I like the idea of the moped (vroom vroom!)

				Block Island is not cheap.&nbsp; Do your research on trip advisor and other such sites, and go with a group of people.&nbsp; It saves on a room.&nbsp; I have no idea how long you should book in advance.&nbsp; Probably a lot.&nbsp; You could also just make a day trip out of it, many people do that.&nbsp; And yes, the booking of the car takes a long time.&nbsp; I would just rent the moped.&nbsp; It&#039;s an island with not much technology so the bad websites don&#039;t surprise me.&nbsp; But it is a beautiful place to visit if you can swing it.

				About 10 years ago I took a ferry from Montauk to Block Island and spent all day there.&nbsp; The boat ride is about 2 hours. It is really beautiful and they have great restaurants and shops.&nbsp; Be prepared if you are thinking of going in the water it is much colder than the water on Long Island or at the Jersey Shore. - brrr.

				I have been to BI many times, it&#039;s an amazing place. Check out my blog entry about: http://dontcallmejones.wordpress.com/<br />It&#039;s a very special place. If you want any recommendation on where to stay/what to do, let me know. Thanks!

				i spent a day there quite a long time ago but I remember it being very beautiful.&nbsp; I took the ferry from Montauk and was able to bring my bike.&nbsp; i went in August so the water wasn&#039;t that cold.&nbsp; I also remember a beach where the water was remarkably clear but that may have just been a fluke due to a perfect combo wind, tides, etc.<br />Anyways, i would highly recommend BI for a day trip.

				(http://i96.photobucket.com/albums/l194/duska3419/15031.jpg)<br /><br />What I should post is a picture of the sunburn I got!!! The island is nice, but I definitely would have like it better by car. I plan on going back to check out the city of Greenport, that looked interesting in itself!! I especially liked an ice cream place called &#039;Flavors&#039; <br /><br />Thanks for all the info for my spontaneous and random day trip Bentleys Dad!

				Well you&#039;re welcome! Yes I agree, it is definitely better by car. Accessibility. It is much easier to get around by car than by foot, especially if you&#039;re going to go on a hike, let&#039;s say, or go to a beach, although you can rent a bike. Anyway, next time I guess. I hope you didn&#039;t only take one pic!!

				Did you try renting a moped?&nbsp; I rented a bike and I was so tired from the scorching sun.&nbsp; The next day we did the mopeds, although I&#039;m such a scaredy cat I had to sit on the back while my friend rode it.&nbsp; I took some really beautiful pictures and ended up painting one of a seagull in front of the ocean.
