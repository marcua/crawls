				The best nearby places to go thread got me thinking it&#39;s almost time to visit the apple orchard. Which is your favorite. I&#39;ve gone to maskers but the pumpkins are in a bin. Last year we went to New Hampshire and it was really nice but that&#39;s a trek.

				I would like to know, too - especially if there are any places accessible by bus or train.

				I&#39;m not sure if the Queens County Farm Museum (http://www.queensfarm.org/) has apple trees, but I got my pumpkins from there last year. (Go early.)

				Haha, I was going to suggest Maskers, but you&#39;ve been there already.&nbsp; &nbsp;I used to go with my grandparents and once took an ex-gf and her little brother.&nbsp; &nbsp;Good times.<br /><br />I think now I&#39;d go more to see the trees change colors than to actually go pick apples.&nbsp; I must be getting old in my old age.&nbsp; *bones creaking*<br /><br />Good hunting... or should i say &#39;picking&#39;&nbsp; :-)

Looks like they are having a couple of nice events this weekend, but if it is too much of a hassle or takes too long to get there I&#39;d probably rather skip it.
