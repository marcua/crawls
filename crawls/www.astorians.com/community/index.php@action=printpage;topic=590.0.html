				Very cool event happening at Flux Factory, an art space near our territory. &nbsp;This looks sooooo fun!!!!!!!!<br />It is called Paintball by Numbers.....<br /><br />Watch people shooting pints of paint into canvas, paintball - style!!!! &nbsp;One of my fellow Church of Stop Shopping choir members is in the video......<br /><br />Live music, djs, refreshments and an open invitation to test out &quot;Paint Ball By Numbers&quot; <br /><br />Art website: http://paintballbynumbers.com/ <br /><br />Flux Factory website: http://fluxfactory.org/how.htm <br />Event Info: <br /><br />8 p.m. until dawn @ the Flux Factory (38-38 43rd Street, Queens) <br /><br />Directions: <br /><br />N &amp; W trains to 36th Ave and walk south on 36th Ave (HINT: The Dunkin' Donuts is on the SW corner). Walk until you hit Northern Blvd (10 blocks). Left on Northern Blvd and turn right on corner of Pathmark (42nd Place). Road curves a bit to the left (where it turns into 43rd Street w/o informing you). Flux Factory is on right beside Midtown Express (and often hidden behind Midtown Express trucks). #38-38. Look for our sign above the door! <br />or <br /><br />Le Industrial walk (super easy but boring and ugly):<br />Take the Queens bound V, R or G train to 36th St ( WARNING G train has not been going all the way through to 36st so please transfer to the 7 train at Court Square refer to 7 train directions below) (take the 36th St. exit, not the 34th St. one). Walk east on Northern Blvd (away from Manhattan) past Hess gas station and turn right on corner of Pathmark (42nd Place). Road curves a bit to the left (where it turns into 43rd Street w/o informing you). Flux Factory is on right beside Midtown Express (and often hidden behind Midtown Express trucks). #38-38. Look for our sign above the door!<br /><br />Neighborhood walk (NOTE: this stop is more pleasant late at night) :<br />Or one stop further, R, V, or G to Steinway Street (take the 34th Ave exit rather than the Broadway exit.) Walk south (crossing 35 Ave) on Steinway to Northern Blvd. Left on Northern Blvd and turn right on corner of Pathmark (42nd Place). Road curves a bit to the left (where it turns into 43rd Street w/o informing you). Flux Factory is on right beside Midtown Express (and often hidden behind Midtown Express trucks). #38-38. Look for our sign above the door<br /><br /><br />OR the 7 train to 40th St on Queens Boulevard, walk up to 43rd St and take a left. Once on 43rd, walk about three or four long blocks passing under the train overpass. Flux Factory is on left beside Midtown Express (and often hidden behind Midtown Express trucks). #38-38. Look for our sign above the door! If you get to the Pathmark on Northern Blvd you've gone too far. <br /><br />http://fluxfactory.org/index.php
