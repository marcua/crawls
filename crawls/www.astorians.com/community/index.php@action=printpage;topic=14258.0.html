				I find it pretty sad that I&#039;ve lived in Astoria for over three years now and I STILL order from Papa John&#039;s and/or Domino&#039;s.<br /><br />I have some family coming into town tonight and they requested some good pizza their first night in--without having to venture all the way into the city.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had both Rizzo&#039;s and Alba&#039;s, but neither have jumped off the page to me. Both were good, but nothing phenomenal. Rizzo&#039;s eat-in area also isn&#039;t all that big or with good atmosphere.<br /><br />ANY SUGGESTIONS?<br />Thanks!

				Hi bherms<br /><br />Here&#039;s a link to a recent pizza confab:<br /><br />http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=11754.0 (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=11754.0)<br /><br />I like Villa Guadio on 30th Ave between Steinway and 41 Street. Also, if you&#039;re near Ditmars and don&#039;t mind picking it up yourselves, try the slices at Rose and Joe&#039;s bakery under the station.

				Thanks; that&#039;s the kind of thread I was looking for but I didn&#039;t look hard enough! BIG HELP, though.<br /><br />And just to add re: Rizzo&#039;s; although I wasn&#039;t a huge fan of their pies, the service there was beyond fantastic. They beyond aim to please, and were great, friendly and that alone made me want to go back.

				Now, they may be closed tonight due to the death of their chef (and co-owner?), but I&#039;m a big fan Michael Angelo&#039;s on 23rd Ave.&nbsp; It&#039;s a nice sit down place and they make excellent thin crust pizza.

				(Thought I posted here, but it must not have gone through...)<br /><br />Second the recommendation to Michael Angelo&#039;s, at least once they&#039;re open and past their very sad loss.<br /><br />Another alternative with somewhat similar pizza is Vesta, on 30th Ave. and 21st St. Their pizza is great, very thin crust, interesting flavors. And they have truely excellent service and decor, and their other dishes are all at least as good as their pizzas!<br />

				The OP makes me laugh, thanks.

				Used to like Frankie&#039;s and Pizza Palace, but since trying the more &quot;upscale&quot; places, no longer a fan. Love the whole wheat option @ Palace, but they&#039;re just waaay too heavy otherwise. Frankie&#039;s had good veggie options, but also seemed a bit on the heavy side. <br /><br />So the &quot;best&quot; pizza would depend on the type you&#039;re looking for: Heavy-duty like a Hungryman meal? Basic slice w/good-quality ingredients? Or thinner with more distinctive flavors?

				I&#039;ve only tried Vesta&#039;s breakfast pizza, but it was absolutely fantastic.&nbsp; And the crust was perfectly thin and crisp with just the right chew, and I&#039;d assume that goes for all their pizzas.

				Vesta&#039;s pizza is quite good - just had one with Ricotta and Pesto on Sunday.&nbsp; I think the best in Astoria, though, is from Michael Angelo&#039;s II.&nbsp; They&#039;ll be closed on Thursday &amp; Friday, but will open again on Saturday.&nbsp; Either the Sicilian or Sophia Loren thin crust pizza&#039;s are terrific.

				I would strongly recommend Michaelangelo&#039;s, Forno Italia (on Ditmars and 43rd, across from the shopping center), Portobello (in the aforementioned shopping center), and Villa Gaudio&#039;s for a more conventional pie/slice.

				Vesta&#039;s pizzas are fantastic. They have that homemade feel, like you would expect your exceedingly talented Italian grandmother to make you. The prices don&#039;t hurt either! 7-11 dollars for those pizzas I feel is a great bargain (but don&#039;t tell them that! :-P) It&#039;s different from Michael Angelo&#039;s pizza, which I still think is the best in the neighborhood, but just plain awesome at the same time.

				You can&#039;t beat a plain slice from Napoli&#039;s on 35th Avenue.&nbsp; You can&#039;t just have one slice, you will end up getting another.&nbsp; It&#039;s only $1.75 too.

				The best slices of good old fashioned NYC style slice pizza come from Alba&#039;s on Ditmars and 37th street and Polito&#039;s on Steinway and Broadway.&nbsp; For square slices, the Sicilian and Marinara slices at Sac&#039;s on Broadway and 29th are the best.&nbsp; Rose and Joe&#039;s and Rizzos have a nice homemade feel to them.

				From what I&#039;ve tried so far, Michael Angelo&#039;s is the best, albeit a little pricier than most places, but their Sophia Loren pie is worth it.&nbsp; I&#039;ll throw another place in the mix though as far as just a good by-the-slice place.&nbsp; Dino&#039;s on Broadway &amp; 30th.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never been disappointed by them.

				Sorry, I have to disagree with all of you.<br /><br />Sac&#039;s pizza on Broadway is by far the best pizza in town.&nbsp; One of the few places in the neighborhood that has a working brick-oven hearth and makes thier own sauce.&nbsp; Definately the best.<br /><br />Polito&#039;s pizza on broadway is also very good.&nbsp; Not &quot;artisan&quot; pizza like Sac&#039;s, but more of the &quot;classic&quot; New York slice that most people remember.&nbsp; Great stuff.<br /><br />Rizzo&#039;s is unique.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a tremendous fan of thier pizza, but they are such a part of Astoria they can&#039;t go without mention in any &quot;Astoria pizza&quot; topic.&nbsp; You have to respect thier longevity and fanbase.

				I am not a big fan of Sac&#039;s.&nbsp; I find the sauce to be lacking in flavor and the cheese is too thick and chewy despite it being &quot;fresh&quot;.&nbsp; I also think that they need to clean out their oven a bit.&nbsp; While I enjoy the taste of a cool oven crust, I do not want to scrape off black charred bits from the bottom.&nbsp; It makes the whole pie taste like burnt crust.&nbsp; I don&#039;t consider this artisan pizza in any way.&nbsp; <br /><br />Surprisingly, i think that Pinocchio cafe on 30th ave has one of the better pizzas in town and it is from a brick oven.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />For a street slice, I like John&#039;s near Astoria Blvd.

				I&#039;m surprised everybody raves about Vesta&#039;s pizza. While it&#039;s really good, the crust is exactly like a thin matzo (sp?); very cracker-like. <br /><br />So while it&#039;s the size of a manhole cover, it&#039;s about as substantial as a thicker-crust slice from anyplace else.

				Had a couple slices Bleecker Street pizza a few weeks ago. Sampled the Nonna Maria and a regular slice. I liked it. A lot. Especially the regular. The crust was out of this world- thin, crunchy, chewy. It wasn&#039;t oily at all, like when you first have to blot the surface with a napkin before eating. I hate that. The sauce was spicy just enough, the cheese was actually full of flavor-probably the parmesan they use. My boyfriend got a third slice-pepperoni. The entire slice was totally covered in pepperoni. A pepperoni lover&#039;s dream come true. Next time we head downtown by car we might just have to pick up a pie and bring it on home!<br /><br />http://www.bleeckerstreetpizza.com/images/menu-w1.htm<br /><br />Is there any place in Astoria comparable to Bleecker&#039;s?<br />

				Pizza Palace is solid for a quick slice if youre near Ditmars. They also have great gyros.<br /><br />Portabella is very good, especially for their specialty slices. Their chicken rolls are also awesome.<br /><br />Where is Rizzos?

				I&#039;m confused. I was going through my menu pile (what? Doesn&#039;t everyone have a takeout menu pile?) and came across the menu for Astoria Pizzeria on 30th Avenue between 31st and 32nd Streets, next to the Dunkin Donuts. I also came across the menu for, yes, Astoria Pizzeria, on 30th Avenue between 32nd and 33rd Streets (where Alex Pizza was). Same name. Same menu. Same phone number even. Different addresses. <br /><br />Did the Astoria Pizzeria guy seriously buy out Alex Pizza and open another location across the street from his original location? I mean, c&#039;mon, just because Rite Aid did it... <br /><br />

				In no particular order, if you want take out:<br /><br />Michael Angelo&#039;s (thoughts are with them after the chef passed away - truly awesome guy) on 23rd Avenue and 29th Street<br />Brother&#039;s Pizza on 14th street and 30th - a rare gem west of 21st<br />La Vita Mia on 24th Ave and 27th street - my local place. Horrendous meatballs (and I truly love meatball pizza), but the chicken and tomato and regular pizza was magnificent. But one thing that truly stands out: Buffalo Chicken pizza. It&#039;s one of the finest pieces of comfort food you&#039;ll ever come across, just be warned that each slice appears to weigh close to a pound, so either plan on eating all weekend, or get some friends in.<br /><br />And Vesta&#039;s thin crust pizza kicks ass - especially the hangover pizza on the brunch menu.

				From what i have gathered the folks from Forno are the same at Da Francos (at least some of them). <br />Point is Da Fran&#039;s pizza was on par. They use a technic which i used back in my pizza making days: opening the dough on semolina. The result an extra crispy dough with less effort in the opening of the dough ball. I spoke to the pizzaiolo and he also mentioned something that i thought was a good idea but i don&#039;t want to give to much away, just go and try for yourselves. :wink:

				DaForno&#039;s has to be the worst pizza I&#039;ve ever had in Astoria - absolutely no semblence of being opened on semolina, not sure what previous poster is talking about.&nbsp; Worst value for my money ever - nearly $15 for what tasted like a frozen boxed pizza - oh no, wait, it was smaller &amp; didn&#039;t have as much cheese as I remember froz pizza from the 70&#039;s!&nbsp; Actually, Mamma Celeste or Ellios would be a welcome treat after this.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Has anyone mentioned Dino&#039;s on Broadway?&nbsp; If you&#039;re looking for a traditional pizzeria with delicious, piping hot pizza, this is it.&nbsp; There&#039;s not much else to say other than it&#039;s a really good pizza place that I highly recommend.&nbsp; <br /><br />For reference, I&#039;m used to Long Island pizza (shoutout to Little Vincent&#039;s!) and I really don&#039;t like Politos or Sacs.&nbsp; There&#039;s just something &quot;off&quot; about their slices.&nbsp; Rizzos is absolutely delicious, but I wouldn&#039;t call it a traditional slice of pizza.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m a big fan of Dino&#039;s, has become my Friday night delivery choice for the last few months. Pizza is really good; and their other dishes are really solid. Recommend their veal and chicken dishes; particularly the marsala and involtini (believe that&#039;s the name...chicken or veal stuffed with ham and fontina cheese). Not a fancy place, but just really solid and consistent.

				There&#039;s no reason to have any doubt in picking the best Pizza that you really insist. Everywhere has a different pizza style that we could be able to think of even a sort of those taste. Astoria provides also the best pizza that everyone wants, consisting the most deliciously recipe that you would never thought.

				I have to also vote for Michael Angelo&#039;s as best Astoria pizza.&nbsp; It&#039;s one of the best in the whole city, IMO.&nbsp; <br /><br />We don&#039;t get pizza all that often, so every time we go there, we order the Sophia Loren.&nbsp; But their other food always sounds and looks amazing, too.&nbsp; I need to try other dishes there at some point.&nbsp; But it&#039;s hard to turn down the pizza!&nbsp; <br /><br />

				If we&#039;re all chiming in with our favorite pizza, mine happens to be Michael Angelo&#039;s.&nbsp; They are very friendly in there, and the sit-down food is amazing too.&nbsp; &nbsp;Rosario&#039;s isn&#039;t bad either.&nbsp; The worst was Pizza Palace, ugh.&nbsp; In the middle: the one on the corner of 37th and Ditmars, and Frankie&#039;s on Ditmars - which is actually just alright.

				Alba&#039;s is decent (that&#039;s the one on 37th and ditmars).<br /><br />Frankies used to be really good (at least that&#039;s what I remember) but over the last several years seems to have gotten worse and worse.<br /><br />Dino&#039;s on broadway was really good until the old Italian guy (the owner, I believe) died many years ago.&nbsp; Even though his wife was still around the pizza was never the same.<br /><br />Most slice places nowadays tend to use cheap ingredients and put little care into making pizza, so even though new york is known as a &quot;pizza town&quot; I find it&#039;s actually pretty difficult to find a decent slice place.&nbsp; If you work in midtown, it&#039;s like a pizza wasteland.

				Just ordered S &amp; S Calabro for the first time tonight, and wow was it good. Had a white pie which was just phenomenal....nice and crispy on the outside, ricotta was so much better than most places, and the pizza was hot but not greasy, and was a real solid piece...in that it wasn&#039;t floppy. not sure if this all makes sense, but I was very impressed with this place, which I had been meaning to try for a while.

				Il Forno on Ditmars is hands down the best pizza in Astoria.&nbsp; IMHO that doesn&#039;t say much, but it&#039;s the best we&#039;ve got.&nbsp; Compared to how wonderful all the other offerings are, pizza is one of the weakest options in the hood.&nbsp; Rizzo&#039;s just wasn&#039;t right (too salty) and Sac&#039;s was overpriced ($6 toppings) and just not good.&nbsp; Sac&#039;s was particularly dissapointing as all the elements are there for a good pie, but they don&#039;t measure up to other pies in the 5-boro&#039;s

				I&#039;ve been pretty disappointed by the pizza options in the Ditmar&#039;s area lately. We regularly order pies from Portabello&#039;s and Michael Angelo&#039;s, but they haven&#039;t been as good as they used to be. Sometimes the pie is good and sometime bad, but never &quot;wow, this is great pizza!&quot; Il Forno is very good, but I like a big classic pie. It&#039;s so hard to find a good crispy crust anymore. It&#039;s enough to make me want to open my own place, but that should be the last thing this hood needs--another pizza place, right? <br /><br />Napoli makes a good, classic pie, but they&#039;re all the way over on 35th Avenue and won&#039;t deliver to me. That&#039;s part of my ongoing rant that Astoria is too damn large. I should be able to order pizza from Napoli because it is in Astoria and I live in Astoria, but I can&#039;t, and that stinks. End of rant.
