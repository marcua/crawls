				I have a two and a half year old and I&#039;m looking for a nursery school program for him. I really don&#039;t want to put him into daycare. I&#039;ve done that route and would like something more structured. Most of the places I&#039;ve looked into won&#039;t take children until they are 3 yrs old. Does anyone have any suggestions or recommendations? Thanks!

				The info below came from Yahoo! Moms online group (a much more active group as compared to Astorians.com, as far as family and parenting-related issues are concerned):<br /><br />Khensee Wangmo, who runs a group family day care on Ditmars &amp; 43rd, just expanded (opened the expansion on Feb. 1st), and I believe she may have a couple of slots still available for children ages 2-5.<br /><br />Khensee is Montessori certified, and taught at Les Enfants and Blossom before opening her own place a few years ago. My son has been with her since he was 4 months old, in September 2009, and we cannot say enough good things about her. She and her staff are calm, nurturing and caring, and provide an excellent environment for the children to learn and play.<br /><br />Khensee Wangmo<br />Group Family Day Care<br />42-20 Ditmars Blvd<br />347-449-4771<br />

				We enrolled our two year old in Garden School in Jackson Heights. Its an independent school with the option of continuing on until grade 12 which was very attractive to us. It has great reviews and their curriculum is great with music and Mandarin (among other things) in nursery school, French introduced at age 4 and Spanish at age 6. She&#039;ll be starting with them in September when she&#039;s two and a half.

				The Director and her daughter are extreamly unprofessional. I dont understand how this school has been in business for this long. Not all the teacers are montessori teachers, the kids do not follow the curriculum liek they explain they do when you enroll your chilf. Most importantly some of the big classes dont have enough assistants. The French teacher cant even teach her lesson, for she is occupied with covering for teachers or trying to take control of the class since there is a lack of help. Some of the best are the assistants. Ms. Rivera is extreamly ignorant and i even saw her slap a couple of the 3rd graders for missbehaving. As an old employee, i dont understand how she considers herself a beacon of educaion when she lacks tact and education.
