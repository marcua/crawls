				&nbsp;SATURDAY, November 10, 2012 at 1:00pm<br />A Jackie Gleason retrospective. 25 years after his death, a look back at an American original. The Honeymooners, The Jackie Gleason Show, Minnesota Fats in The Hustler ... Gleason has left his imprint on a generation.&nbsp; Comedian, actor, composer and conductor, educated in New York public schools, Gleason was the consummate performing artist having been a master of ceremonies in amateur shows, a carnival barker, daredevil driver and disc jockey before he made his breakthrough as a night club comedian. <br />&nbsp;<br />By the mid-1950s he had turned to writing original music and recording a series of popular and best-selling albums including “Melancholy Serenade”, “Glamour”, “Lover‘s Rhapsody”, “On the Beach” and “To a Sleeping Beauty.”<br />&nbsp;<br />The program will be a presentation of Jackie‘s career with images and clips from his shows followed by a discussion by people sharing their best memories of him. <br />&nbsp;<br />After discussion, we will show two complete episodes of The Honeymooners.&nbsp; &nbsp;Join his fans for a look back on a most remarkable person.&nbsp; These programs are supported by public funds from the NYC Department of Cultural Affairs.&nbsp; Additional support provided by the membership of the Greater Astoria Historical Society<span class="bbc_u">.&nbsp; </span><br />GAHS members free – non-members $5.00<br /><br /><strong>Greater Astoria Historical Society</strong><br />35-20 Broadway, 4th Floor, <br />Long Island City, NY&nbsp; 11106<br />718-278-0700 www.astorialic.org<br />
