				OK, I&#039;ve figured out how to see my outbox, but I&#039;ve got another question. I wanted to correct some information in one of my posts, but the Modify button isn&#039;t appearing on the top as usual.&nbsp; Is this just a temporary glitch?

				In my experience, the modify and remove buttons disappear after the window is up.

				The post edit window is 15 minutes.<br /><br />The reason it&#039;s set that way is because what you post affects the conversation and others read it and begin to respond in many cases. In order that the conversation be cohesive, it&#039;s better to encourage people to think about their post and edit before posting as much as possible. 15 minutes should be enough time in case you notice punctuation errors, or some minor change. But after that if you need to revise something you&#039;ve said chances are others have already read it and may have responded (or be responding) so it&#039;s better to follow up with a new post clarifying what you said, or revising your remarks - the same as you would in a normal conversation.<br /><br />That&#039;s the goal. It can be annoying I know, and that&#039;s an unfortunate side effect of this approach. But it&#039;s annoying also when you respond to someone and then an hour later they have totally changed their post so that your reply doesn&#039;t make sense any more, and then annoying for readers who come by later and find a thread that no longer makes sense. So I guess this is a kind of necessary evil.<br /><br />There is a &quot;preview&quot; feature that works great for revising your remarks, and also a short window. Hopefully that&#039;s adequate for most situations.
