				I have a question for those of you who are better versed than I am in city planning regulations.<br />&nbsp;<br />When the Department City Planning published its &quot;Plan for Long Island City: A Framework for Development&quot; in the mid-1990s<br /><br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/pub/lic.shtml (http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/pub/lic.shtml)<br /><br />It was my understanding that most of the proposed development was to be concentrated south of Queens Plaza, specifically along Jackson Avenue and that changes in zoning were to be implemented that allowed the area to be changed from primarily manufacturing to mixed-use developments that combined commercial, manufacturing and residential.<br /><br />Can someone tell me what happened to the commercial development and why is there so much residential construction on Queens Plaza north?<br /><br />--When were the zoning regulations changed form manufacturing/commercial to residential (on QPNorth)?<br /><br />--Was this part of the original plan or were regulations amended somewhere along the line to focus on residential?<br /><br />--Also, how is it possible that developers are erecting hi-rises, which appear to be hotels, much further north into existing residential areas of Dutch Kills?<br /><br />I read an article recently saying that Dutch Kills residents were rushing to try a close a loophole. More power to them I say but can someone tell me how this loophole appeared – was it magic?<br /><br />http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2007/11/19/2007-11-19_neighborhood_says_long_island_city_build.html (http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2007/11/19/2007-11-19_neighborhood_says_long_island_city_build.html)<br /><br />I’ve been following the plans to redevelop LIC (obviously not too closely) and had thought the plan had some good points (though I did have some misgivings)<br /><br />The focus on commercial development meant a change from mainly manufacturing to office but at least the character of the area would be somewhat maintained as well as its role as center for jobs and employment.<br /><br />Why is it then that every building that seems to be going up is residential in nature? Aside from the additional buildings around Citicorp are there any other commercial buildings going up or existing buildings being redeveloped as offices?<br />

				I don&#039;t know when/if QP north was added to the plan, but it is only a very small portion of QP north. If you look at the executive summary for the rezoning http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/lic/lic2.shtml (http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/lic/lic2.shtml) You can see it is pretty much only 1 block on the northside that made it in.<br /><br />As for why residential vs commercial/office I believe it is primarily for a few reasons.<br /><br />1)Quicker returns. When a condo building is completely sold out the developer has recouped all their money and can call it a day. With office buildings it is very different. The developer on office space, in the case of companies like vornado and Extell, owns and manages the building after they build it. They lease the space out instead of selling it, so it often takes longer to realize their return.<br />2) Desirability. The market for office space outside of the CBD is pretty limited. For many reasons (transportation being a major one) LIC just isn&#039;t that attractive for office space.<br />

				The reality is that city planning failed terribly in their efforts to create a fourth business district. The only major tenant, Met Life, is running shrieking back to the city. I have a good friend whose wife works there, and she says that everyone hates the location. When I mentioned to her the real estate types who are trying to market the area as an upscale yuppie housing, well, we don&#039;t have to repeat her comments on a public board.<br /><br />This area is served by excellent transportation. And the central business district in Manhattan, has not only expanded beyond its tradtional bounds, but into other areas, in Brooklyn and Jersey and even Westchester and Conn. All are now considered attractive communities and prime commerical space. <br /><br />In Queens, the story is different. The effort to attract commerical tenants has backfired terribly. It is just about finished. Even MOMAQueens left with nary a backward glance. Now desperate planners are falling back on making the area purely residential. <br /><br />City planning is spinning its wheels, and like with the failed 2012 Olympics effort, their creativity is limited to one tired half-baked blockbuster idea after another. They can put in four 50 story buildings for Silvercup and want us to believe that the traffic can be handled with fine tuning one traffic light. When the folks in Dutch Kills asked who approved 14 hotels in their tiny community, everyone, from the mayor&#039;s office, to city planning, just shrugged. Afterall, they don&#039;t live in Dutch Kills. <br /><br />The point is that the entire effort at making LIC an attractive area is sputtering - the folks over a Arris just discovered they face an active railyard. Simple amenities, as dry cleaners and shopping, just doesn&#039;t exist in the community (oh yes, we hear stories of them getting ... one!) Residents and visitors alike on their more candid moments, liken the area to Newport in Pavonia near Jersey City. Highrise after highrise with no street life, no community, no soul.<br /><br />And what of the long term residents? Cracked walls and windows facing 15 story buildings will be a way of life for the people in Hunters Point and Dutch Kills from now on. Too late, they discovered what happens if you bring development in. You lose your community.<br /><br />Their experience is a cautionary tale for all. <br /><br />With the exception of the immigrant communities of Flushing or Elmhurst, development is scorned throughout the city (Ratnerville, Greenwich Village, West Side, East Side, Lower Manhattan, Greenpoint.) In the case of most of Queens, communities are frantically trying to downzone. Every effort to develop places, from Willets Point to downtown Jamaica, is met with spirited oppostion. Like a game of musical chairs, only the one left standing will lose - they will have to find the place to fit in the million that the mayor claims he wants here by 2030. <br /><br />Only in western Queens is it welcomed - by the politicians, press, and community boards.<br /><br />All this space, coming on the market just as the real estate bubble is about to burst, should make for some interesting situations.

Brooklyn is booming and Jersey City has a thriving market. I agree with Gleason that Newport is souless but there&#039;s been tremendous other development centered around Exchange Place with the Goldman Sachs tower as well as around Grove Street, yet Jersey City has been able to maintain it&#039;s stock of historic housing and character of neigborhoods outside their business district (with much oversight from concerned citizens, there have been problems with balancing growth and the needs of residents).<br /><br />The plan for LIC as I understood it, was a direct response to the growth happening in Jersey City and, with a few reservations, the plan was well thought out, though it was absurd, in my opinion, for the city to think that a manufacturing base would be able to be maintained amidst all the proposed changes. <br /><br />I was wondering why the commercial aspect seems to have been discarded. I&#039;m beginning to think the failure of commercial developemnt to take off was part of the plan so to speak and what is being built now proceeding is actually on target to expectations.<br /><br />And by the way, I don&#039;t understand how you can say LIC isn&#039;t well served by transport links: 7 subway lines, multiple bus routes, LIRR, ferry service. I don&#039;t think this is a factor.<br /><br /><br /><br />Gleason -- thanks for your thoughtful (and measured) response. I guess it&#039;s another case of the city planning commision looking the other way and selling out as soon as there&#039;s a hiccup. Has there been any breaches of zoning regs that you know of?

				I&#039;d be curious to hear some thoughts on LIC vs DUMBO. Is it just the [very significant] cachet of Brooklyn and the Brooklyn Bridge that finally got DUMBO built out (and now unaffordable)? <br /><br />Both areas seem to have had an existing artist/loft population, and some manufacturing/industrial base left, however small. I suppose LIC is also much bigger, but the difference between the two areas seems striking at this point. Did DUMBO have a long head start? I first started going there about 7 or so years ago, and conversions were starting, and now it&#039;s vastly more built out and full of people.

				The biggest difference in my opinion between DUMBO and LIC is that as you say, the DUMBO area is smaller and also I think manufacturing started to decline long before it did so in before LIC, leaving property open for re-development sooner.<br /><br />Second, and more importantly, a large portion of land in DUMBO is controlled by a single real estate concern owned the Walentas family. They’ve been the driving force in converting former industrial spaces lofts to residential. The Walentas essentially created the brand “DUMBO” and have tried not only to convert structures to residential use but also to create a neighbourhood. <br /><br />Long Island City is bigger, more diverse and until relatively recently, manufacturing was still vital to the area. It was never really ‘abandonded’ and open to for gentrification like other former industrial areas in the city that went into decline and were re-colonized.<br /><br />There are more competing interests in LIC, which definitely has more players in the pot: manufacturers fighting to keep their space and maintain LIC as an industrial base (though that battle is probably now lost), existing residents, the city, and various real estate companies who see virgin territory ready for exploitation.<br /><br />And unlike DUMBO, LIC has no single “vision”, for lack of a better word, so development is proceeding in a hodgepodge fashion. The master plan to create the fourth business district supposed to establish a sort of unity as to what should be built, but as you can see from what’s going up now it’s apparently “developers gone wild.”<br /><br />From what I’ve read and seen, in my opinion the Walentas have done a decent job in preserving some of DUMBO’s historic buildings and have been somewhat successful in creating a neighborhood feel by keeping rents reasonable for small mom &amp; pops type stores to operate. That’s a plus in my book.<br /><br />But they aren’t perfect, being real estate guys after all. They’ve floated various plans to erect hi-rises in DUMBO that so far have been successfully thwarted by local residents seeking maintain the character of the area. It’s an ongoing situation so we’ll see what happens. <br />

				The amount of construction going on around LIC reminds me of the rapid development of Shenzen China back in the late 90s: no rhyme or reason.

That is a sizeable chunk of the population, but if you look at midtown as an example you have:<br />Pretty much every subway line<br />LIRR<br />Metro North<br />PATH<br />NJ transit trains and busses<br />Ferrys<br /><br />The area is still a bit sketchy, too.

				People and private market forces create the need for urban planning, not the other way around.&nbsp; Comprehensive plans and zoning can only attempt to channel these forces in a beneficial way.<br /><br />The push for the 4th CBD in LIC just won&#039;t work because the people aren&#039;t there for it.&nbsp; Its been said before, but people dislike working in LIC.&nbsp; I work in downtown LIC, and I love it, but only because I&#039;m an Astorian.&nbsp; My comrades from Brooklyn, Jersey, the Bronx, Manhattan and even the Island despise working here (and the folks from the island will hate it more once the East Side Access Project is finished and the Hunterspoint Station is closed).&nbsp; Its takes longer to get here and the neighborhood amenities are not like what they were accustomed to in Manhattan.&nbsp; This lessens the available workforce that a company can draw from, thereby making it less attractive for offices to settle in.<br /><br />If offices really found this an attractive place to settle, it would have evolved into a 4th CBD regardless of any sort of planning.&nbsp; Since the potential workforce draw is sparse, so are the businesses which thrive here: residential buildings, warehousing, light manufacturing.<br /><br />Jersey took off in part because of the fantastic rail network they have coming in

				I agree with you that the CBD plans haven&#039;t turned out as expected -- that&#039;s very apparent now and that people dislike working in LIC, proven by MetLife exiting it&#039;s space.<br /><br />But LIC wouldn&#039;t have evolved naturally without government intervention because of existing zoning regulations, which allowed primarily manufacturing. The area was still actively manufacturing at the time the plan was put forth (though on the cusp of decline following national trends) and developers didn&#039;t have rights to build office buildings&nbsp; unless a change was implemented.<br /><br />I had thought that&#039;s why a comprehensive plan was prepared, to encourage a type of development that didn&#039;t exist before&nbsp; <br /><br />What I think is the problem is that a grandiose plan was floated without getting everyone on board or a strong local leadership to see it through and it drifted. If more projects were built more services would have moved in and opened up making it attractive for workers.<br /><br />I&#039;m also beginning to think that no one really wanted the CBD in the first place because where was the hard sell? The whole exercise seems to have been a ploy to simply change the zoning, kick out the manufacturers and open it up for developers to building anything.<br /><br /><br />In Jersey, specifically, Jersey City, where the bulk of development has taken place, has no major transport links other than the PATH train. New Jersey Transit railroad trains run through Hoboken and though the two towns are adjacent getting to downtown JC requires a change to the PATH or the light rail. <br /><br />I need to find read up on how they&#039;ve managed to be a success and LIC floundered.<br /><br />
