				Christos is especially flagrant about their &quot;valet&quot; parking. On busy nights(especially around the holidays) they will take two spaces to save one. then when the next car comes they move the other so they can get the next one in. If one is leaving, they&#039;ll move the other one to take the 2 spaces again.<br /><br />So a local is forced to drive around to find a spot a few blocks away. Of course, if you check at 11:30pm all you see are double spots all along the block. At one time, they would use the schoolyard on 42nd which wasn&#039;t so bad. Probably until they got caught or something.<br /><br />Oh, and after watching them park some cars on Astoria Blvd, I&#039;m sure that the car owners probably weren&#039;t too happy about them parking there.

				Why anyone would use valet parking at Christos&#039; is beyond me.&nbsp; I never have trouble finding a spot more than a block or two away.

				As for Christos and their parking situation, I LIVE RIGHT NEXT DOOR and yes--their valet situation gets very irritating when you are a resident of the same street.<br /><br />It is really, really, really aggravating to me when I come home at a time that they have a rush and I have circle between 41st Street, 23rd Avenue, 42nd Street and Astoria Blvd at LEAST 7-8 times before I finally wind up parking far away. And when I say far, I mean far. I&#039;m young, I don&#039;t mind walking, but Christos during their rush will literally take up every place you can park a car in with in 3-4 blocks around the restaurant.<br /><br />It&#039;s even more aggravating when they take up one big spot RIGHT in front of the restaurant with their &quot;VALET&quot; sign, which could just as well go on the curb and not in a spot.<br /><br />I wish that their valet would be more respectful to the residents, but I guess there are really no other options.

				I haven&#039;t been to Asia de Cuba in years but the food was quite good and it&#039;s a popular place.&nbsp; It&#039;s along the swanky, scene-like, overpriced menu genre of restaurants.&nbsp; I think it still has the same rep.
