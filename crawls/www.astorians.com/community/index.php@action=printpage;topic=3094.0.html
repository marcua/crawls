				So tonight we get:<br />tomatoes (large), lettuce, basil, carrots, cucumbers<br /><br />get to it! i&#39;m excited to finally try the basil- mine got lost to the blackout last time. going to try pesto.<br />doesn&#39;t look like a very exotic spread this week so im not expecting big suggestions, just kinda want to get the ball re-rolling :)<br /><br />also- what are you all doing with your yummy honey shares??????? it really is tastey, i use it as an after dinner sweet. instead of stocking up on cookies and cakes i&#39;ve been just dunking a spoon in there and having a taste to just alleviate the ache after dinner for something.

				my mom makes a really fantastic baked pasta with fresh basil and tomatoes. She blends the tomatoes and basil in the blender together with some oil and salt, then ads half of it to cooked pasta, after that she layers the pasta and a layer of the sauce (2 of eact), also some breadcrumbs, and pops it in the oven until the top browns. It&#39;s very simple, but oh so yummy!!!<br /><br />

				OK, what I had for dinner tonight...<br /><br />I used 4 plum tomatoes and some basil to make spaghetti with tomatoes and basil. Here&#39;s how that works: Start the pasta water. Peel, seed, and slice into long matchsticks the tomatoes. Slice some garlic into very thin slices (think goodfellas), then heat in a skillet with some XV olive oil until garlic just starts to color. Add tomatoes, and cook until water is released from the tomatoes. Add some salt. Cook until tomatoes are well cooked. Add a small handful of basil leaves, torn in half, and a pinch of crushed red chile peppers. Cook another couple of minutes then turn off the heat while you finish cooking the pasta. Add the cooked, drained pasta to the sauce, along with a bit more XV olive oil, and eat.<br /><br />I also made a salad, with the lettuce, a couple of carrots, a half a cuke, a green pepper I had in the fridge. The lettuce with really bitter I thought, so I made a honey-mustard dressing that helped a lot. Equal parts canola oil, dijon mustard, and honey, with some salt and pepper. <br /><br />Incidentally, salt makes bitter things taste less bitter. Try adding a bit of salt to black coffee some time if you don&#39;t believe me. Unless you over-salt it, it won&#39;t taste salty, just less bitter...<br />

				What she said.&nbsp; &nbsp; :lol:<br /><br />I took some good olive oil, micrograted a clove of garlic into it.&nbsp; Big chunky sea salt, cracked green pepper, diced tomatoes, torn basil.&nbsp; Tossed that all together and had it with CSA lettuce.&nbsp; I know what Harlan means about the bitterness, but I enjoyed it tonight, and I was also enjoying the fact that the lettuce had <em>flavour</em>!!<br /><br />Oh, and then we reached into our back yard for dessert, and had grilled figs topped with buttery upstate NY Camembert and just a grain or two of sea salt.
