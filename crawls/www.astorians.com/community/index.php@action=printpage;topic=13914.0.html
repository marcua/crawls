				There&#039;s a new figure drawing class going on in Astoria, and I&#039;m going to go check it out this Saturday.&nbsp; Hope to see some fellow artists there!<br /><br />Cross Pollination is a monthly event for sketch artists to draw dancers as models-in-motion and for dancers to improvise with one another, while being inspired to move by the art in the making! This is a unique opportunity to explore the combination of visual, motion-based and audio arts. As host, Green Space hopes to provide a relaxed environment for spontaneous, free expression and improvisation between the different forms while encouraging synergy amongst artists. These sessions are open to artists, dancers, musicians and viewers alike.<br />Please, come and join us!<br /><br />Saturdays every month:<br />Feb 7 Mar 7 Apr 4 May 9 Jun 13 Jul 11 Aug 8<br /><br />Admission: $5<br /><br />Time: February 7, 2009 from 6pm to 9pm<br />Location: Green Space<br />Street: 37-24 24th St #301<br />City/Town: Long Island City<br />Website or Map: http://greenspacestudio.org<br /><br />(Artists- Please, bring simple materials : easy to carry, non-messy, acoustic, imaginative, etc.)

				Went last night. Very pleasant and artistically intriguing experience. Really lets you study movement. Thanks Valerie.

				Apparently Wonderland, an artists collective in Astoria, has sketch classes too, starting in late April.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to get more information on them, to find out if they have live models and timed poses, price, etc.&nbsp; While the class in GreenSpace is really great for studying movement and more freeform art, I had trouble getting poses down because the dancers were in constant movement.&nbsp; It&#039;s difficult for those who are more used timed poses.

The movement makes you do quick loose sketches. I think you need to look at it more about action than anatomy. But perhaps your input and that of other artist will help this evolve into something more to everyone&#039;s liking. Maybe the dancers holding 5 or 10 second poses in time with the music (thinking out loud)

				Yes, it is definitely more about the action.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to see them hold 1 minute poses personally.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t necessarily need 5-20 min poses but as an animator, it&#039;s helpful to see how much of the body you can get down in 60 secs.&nbsp; &nbsp;I find constant movement helpful in terms of studying how the dancers move and at the same time, I want to slow them down frame by frame so I could study every single movement.&nbsp; &nbsp;The class is more about action and freeform art, but yes, perhaps it will adapt over time based on artist input.&nbsp; &nbsp;
