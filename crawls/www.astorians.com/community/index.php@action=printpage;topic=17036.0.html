				My family and I are strongly considering moving to Astoria from Brooklyn this spring to be closer to our jobs, and I am trying to find out more about the schools in Astoria.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard positive things about PS 122 and PS 85.&nbsp; Does anyone have personal experience with either school?&nbsp; Additionally, I am aware that PS 122 has a G &amp; T program, but is the regular, non-G &amp; T program at PS 122 still good?&nbsp; My son would be entering kindergarten there.<br /><br />I am also wondering what preschools are nearby that people would recommend.&nbsp; And, are there any particular favorite areas in Astoria that people like?&nbsp; We&#039;d love to find something pretty and green and near to the park, and we&#039;re also hoping to find other families nearby.&nbsp; Finally, can anyone refer a realtor they know and like?&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks so much in advance.&nbsp; Any other advice is greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Jessica<br />Mom to 2

				Hi-- Welcome to Astoria.<br /><br />PS 122 is considered the best of the local public schools.&nbsp; It is a huge school.&nbsp; For kids not in the G&amp;T program, the school goes up to grade 5 I beleive, and up to grade 8 for those that qualify for G&amp;T.&nbsp; the other public schools in the area generally do not compare as favorably.&nbsp; If you find a home you really like that is not zoned for 122, you can try to get in on a magnet basis or look at some of the other local school options other than public.&nbsp; (That is the route my family went-- I was looking for a smaller school.) PS 85 also has a G&amp;T program.<br /><br />I do not know any realtors, though there apepars to be one on every block.<br /><br />Best of luck!<br />Joyce

				There is a day care right near PS 122 which serves ages 2-4 called Kid Krazy which is great. <br />PS 122 has a great reputation as a whole, not just the G &amp; T. PS 85 is also supposed to be very very good especially at the younger ages. <br /><br />The Ditmars area is definitely your best bet if you&#039;re looking at those schools.&nbsp; You might want to spend a day walking/driving around the neighborhood.&nbsp; There are many great bakeries and restaurants, several grocery stores, international grocery stores, etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />Feel free to PM me if you want more info.&nbsp; Rachel.

				Our World Neighborhood Charter School (over by the Museum of the Moving Image) is a great alternative.&nbsp; It&#039;s by lottery so you need to contact them as to when applications are due.&nbsp; It goes K-8.&nbsp; I have a child there and she is thriving!&nbsp; The school has wonderful teachers and very good overall GPAs.<br /><br />http://www.owncs.org<br /><br />you can check out schools at http://www.insideschools.org<br /><br />Both my kids went to Queensview Nursery School and it was WELL WORTH IT!!&nbsp; I looked around and everything seemed like glorified daycare.&nbsp; This was an actual school.&nbsp; Most of the teachers have been there for years and are very committed to the kids.<br /><br />http://www.queensviewschool.com

				Hello &amp; welcome to Astoria <br />We love Astoria.&nbsp; <br />PS 122 has a strong reputation but the reputation of PS 85 is growing.&nbsp; They have STEM, the only citywide G &amp; T program in Queens and they also have district wide G &amp; T seats.<br />Many of the smaller schools do not have as strong reputations and not rated as highly on Insideschools.org but if you visit them they have a certain small town feel to them that may work for your family.<br />Astoria has 3 charter schools:<br />1.&nbsp; Our World Charter School<br />2.&nbsp; Growing Up Green Charter School<br />3.&nbsp; Voice Charter School<br />They are all lottery and they are all taking applications now through March or April check each school for the time frame.<br />I know many parents are thrilled with several religious schools in Astoria.&nbsp; I only know about Grace Lutheran school.&nbsp; My son is in PReK there and I would have never considered it for kindergarten but we&#039;re having such a positive experience there that we are now considering it.&nbsp; It is a small school with enthusiastic families and staff.&nbsp; <br />For preschool/ PreK options I know other parents are fond of: Little Ones (at the citylights building),&nbsp; St Francis, Immaculate Conception, Most Precious Blood, Les Enfants, and Blossoms.<br />There are several parent communities but not one dominates (like Park Slope Parents).&nbsp; I am familiar with Astoria Moms Meetup Group and Astoriafamilies.org&nbsp; - look around old discussions here to see a listing where people have discussed the groups.&nbsp; I think if you just make it to the playgrounds and chat up the families you will find people are eager to share about the neighborhood.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was recommended Bianca Colasuonno as a realtor by several friends who bought their home with her.&nbsp; She also helps with the rental market.<br />Best of Luck as you consider your options.

				I went to PS 122&#039;s G&amp;T program for 6th - 8th grade and it was incredible.&nbsp; As a kid, I didn&#039;t fully understand what &quot;public school&quot; meant but looking back, I can&#039;t believe it was a free education.&nbsp; Amazing teachers, challenging classes, good kids.&nbsp; They gear every single class toward getting students into one of the specialized high schools around the city.&nbsp; I&#039;d highly recommend PS 122 to anyone who wants to raise a child to grow up as brilliant and awesome as me.&nbsp; (Okay, bad example, but seriously, it&#039;s a great school.)

				So how do you get your child in the G&amp;T program if they are not zoned for that school?

				Danielle: your kid takes the G&amp;T test, and if they get a hig enough scorte, they are offered a seat where there is room for them. There does seem to be some effort made by the ed dept to place kids in schools that are physically close to where they live, but it&#039;s no guarantee. (One could test into the G&amp;T program, live next to ps 122, but be offered a seat at ps 85 if that&#039;s where there&#039;s room.)<br /><br />My child is finishing kindergarten at PS 122 after doing nursery and pre-K at a local parochial school. PM me if you have specific questions or would like my take on his experiences there. :)

				Title: <strong>PS 217 is another G&amp;T Option for Astoria</strong><br />

				PS 217 on nearby Roosevelt Island has beautiful facilities, it is *not* crowded, and has a big play yard with lots of space for recess. Kindergartners go out for recess once a day, sometimes twice. They are building a beautiful new playground this summer. They have a devoted group of involved parents in the PTA. They are still taking applications for K and 1st grade G&amp;T for Sept. 2010. See the article on insideschools.org:<br /><br />http://insideschools.org/blog/?url=http://insideschools.org/blog/2010/06/17/deadline-looming-gt-program-seeks-applicants/

				PS 122 has a very strong general ed program, but is overcrowded. The PTA there is very active and supports the school well.&nbsp; On the downside: 122 has a terrible playground that badly needs repair. Their after-school program is the pits.<br /><br />PS 85 is not as crowded, but like most schools is going to get hurt on class size some because of teacher layoffs. Their science and music programs are great. The playground is amazing. There is a new after school program starting there in October, which is the Serious Fun program relocating into that school.<br /><br />
