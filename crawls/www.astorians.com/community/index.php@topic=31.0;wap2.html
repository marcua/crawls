			<strong>frozenfroot</strong>:
			<br />
			this is a post somewhat related to the earlier post about the TREE IN FRONT OF COMMERCEBANK that got cut down this summer<br /><br /><br /><br />this is an idea which hopefull will lead to the planting of a new tree to replace the one that was cut down<br /><br /><br /><br />since it is late in the planting season, and it would not make sense to plant a seedling until spring let us plant SOMETHING ELSE<br /><br /><br /><br />a sculpture of some sort, perhaps. or a flag. or a tree-like presence.... SOMETHING that will draw attention to the spot, and be a rallying point for local artist/artisans, possibly as a fundraiser to but a tree to plant in the spring.<br /><br /><br /><br />HELP<br /><br /><br /><br />
