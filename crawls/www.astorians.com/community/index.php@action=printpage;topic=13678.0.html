				Seriously...<br /><br />I&#039;ve kicked both habits and now I can&#039;t be anywhere near a girl who does either. <br /><br />Nothing against them. I just can&#039;t be around the environment anymore - nonetheless be dating someone who does drink or smoke. <br /><br />What&#039;s a dude to do or where to look....<br /><br />It&#039;s not like the bar is the answer anymore&nbsp; :-D<br /><br /><br />

				&nbsp;:-D<br /><br />Also please....<br /><br />No women who are full of themselves and ramble on and on about how great their doing in their field, job, school, whatever. They can go date their mirror if they&#039;re so caught up in themselves. <br /><br />Humble women are underrated.<br /><br />A woman with decency - please! Too many scrub women around here (no diss) who flaunt themselves. There&#039;s a borderline between confidence and being overconfident. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t found any luck in Astoria in terms of relationships...

				Sorry, guys. I don&#039;t smoke and I don&#039;t even drink all that much, but I&#039;m as ugly as sin. <br /><br />However, scribbles, you could host a general or singles mixer at a non-alcohol-oriented setting (coffee house, park, volunteer work, etc) and I&#039;ll bet you anything you&#039;d meet some interesting people, some of them women you might want to date. <br /><br />(Astorians mixers are always 10 women to 1 man anyway.)

				Well congratulations on becoming a healthier person!&nbsp; I&#039;ve had a tough time even finding friends who want to do something besides hang out at a bar with a drink in hand.&nbsp; What caused you to drop the two vices?&nbsp; Any hobbies or things you&#039;ve always wanted to do? Personally I am all about meetup - do a search for things you&#039;re interested in that will go along with your newfound lifestyle.

				I don&#039;t like women that smoke either, but the drinking doesn&#039;t bother me one bit.&nbsp; Just putting it out there.&nbsp; (and by &quot;it&quot; I mean that info... for all of you with your minds in the gutter).&nbsp; :wink:
