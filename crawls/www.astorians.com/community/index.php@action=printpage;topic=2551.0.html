				Has anyone tried the new (relatively new) restaurant/bar Rendezvous on Broadway between 35th and 34th Streets?&nbsp; Is it any good?&nbsp; It never seems busy and I haven&#39;t tried it yet - looks like an Italian menu (I heard it is owned by the people who own Bartolino&#39;s).

				Its not bad, I been there for a few drinks and I hear the food is good, it is the same owner as Bartolinos and as No Partners on 21ave.&nbsp; Its fairly new, I dont understand why he opened two Italian restaraunts right next door to each other.

				Rendevous really isn&#39;t meant to be a restaurant, it was intended to be more of a bar/lounge.&nbsp; They do serve a limited menu from the same kitchen as Bartolino&#39;s, but in my opinion food isn&#39;t good.&nbsp; Drinks are good, but atmosphere is lacking and so is the crowd.&nbsp; We&#39;ve tried it a few times for happy hour and also later on a Friday night, but left after 1-2 drinks because it was totally dead.&nbsp; Service is good and Bobby, the owner, is very nice, but the place is still in great need of an jump start.

				Two Italian restaurants next to each other is a very strange thing.&nbsp; Is it the same menu or is Rendezvous cheaper?&nbsp; smaller portions?&nbsp;

				I&#39;m not really sure.&nbsp; When I have seen people eat in there, the waiter comes out of Bartolino into the street and then brings the food into Rendevous - very strange.&nbsp;

				I wonder if that&#39;s legal.&nbsp; I guess they could share kitchens, but I think there are rules requiring each restaurant to have it&#39;s own kitchen space.&nbsp; I wonder if they share a liquor license as well.

				It&#39;s not unheard of.&nbsp; When I lived in Park Slope, I used to hang out at 12th St. Bar a lot, which was the &quot;bar&quot; part of the 12th St. Bar and Grill - the Grill part of which was a relatively upscale restaurant next door - but there was no indoor connection between the two.&nbsp; You could order anything from the 12th St. Bar and Grill menu, and they would bring the order from the kitchen by exiting the restaurant, walking a bit down the street, and coming in the front door of the bar.

				Interesting - I hadn&#39;t seen it before.&nbsp; I wonder why they just didn&#39;t expand Bartolino&#39;s though?&nbsp; (it tends to be a bit overpriced for my taste, but it&#39;s good food).
