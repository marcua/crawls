				hello all, <br /><br />if any of you know me personally, i&#039;m sure you&#039;ve probably me heard me gab on and on about my parents&#039; 2 African Greys. I helped raise our first one when he was still drinking food from a baby syringe, and when he was finally weened off, and started eating the fun solid food, I moved away to college. i always visited my parents every month, and lived with them during the summers. i moved to nyc in 2003, but i still visit my parents about once a month or more, and spend the holidays with them. my parents were given another African Grey in 2006, by a family who couldnt take care of him anymore (he came to us as a feather plucker, and has adjusted really well, and for the most part, gets along with our first one.) i love our Greys, and consider them my rambunctious little brothers - a part of the family. <br /><br />just last fall, my parents were given a Senegal Parrot by another family who said that she was too noisy. she is much smaller than the Greys. one of them doesnt mind her. the other is aggressive towards her, so we keep them separated. i think she is really cute and would be a good companion for me and for the hours i work. the plan was to have her live with me. i said to hold off on the move in date b/c i was going to spend a lot of time with my parents for the holidays just the same, and i was also doing some traveling in the beginning of this year to see some friends out of state. <br /><br />i&#039;m thinking a move in date at the end of this month, or beginning of May might be good, but i wanted to get some feedback from parrot owners here in Astoria. my parents live in nj, and have a large house, the parrots pretty much are free to roam about the house whenever someone is home. i live in a one bedroom apt along Astoria Blvd. <br /><br />how do you deal with: <br />noisy streets?<br />coming back home late from partying a couple times a month?<br />going out of town for the weekend to see friends out of state/ parents out of state? (abt once per month)<br />do you board your parrots if you are going on a vacation for longer than 3 days?<br />where do you buy good food?<br />where do you go to get their nails / beaks trimmed?<br />do you use a special avian vet? or do you go to vets here in Astoria?<br />does your parrot screeching bother your neighbors?<br />are landlords / supers cool / not cool with parrots?<br /><br />thanks astorians!

				Noisy Streets -- not sure what you mean?<br />Coming back home late from partying -- we have our lights on a timer.&nbsp; Birds need a fairly regularly scheduled amount of daylight/nighttime.&nbsp; If we know we&#039;re going to be out late, the lights go off around 9ish, and the bird goes to sleep.<br />My parents are also in Jersey, and have several parrots, so if we&#039;re going away, the bird will usually stay with them.&nbsp; Failing that, I would board him at Birdcamp, which is in Manhattan, around 53rd &amp; 2nd Ave.&nbsp; birdcamp.com<br />Also, we buy all our food and supplies there.&nbsp; They know what they&#039;re doing there :)<br />For an avian vet, I like Dr. Quesenberry at the Animal Medical Center of NY -- amcny.org&nbsp; I was using a vet in Astoria for a while, but birds are really a specialty... didn&#039;t find anyone in the area that was knowledgeable enough.<br />We haven&#039;t had any complaints from the neighbors.<br />We told our landlord we were getting a &#039;small bird&#039; and he waved and said it was fine. <br /><br />

				I have lived in several places with my birds, and unless you have something like a cockatoo that is loud to the extreme, you are really unlikely to have any problems, especially in large apartment buildings in Queens.&nbsp; Most landlords I have met don&#039;t even count birds as &quot;pets&quot;, only larger pets like cats and dogs.&nbsp; <br /><br />For boarding, I would really recommend Birdcamp - they are a great little place with very knowledgeable people.&nbsp; I also get my bird&#039;s food there since I would rather support a place like that over an enormous pet store corporation, and since the food is probably better/fresher at a place like that.&nbsp; You could also make friends with another local bird person and talk them into taking care of your bird for you when you&#039;re gone&nbsp; :wink:&nbsp;

				Hello Parrot owners!<br /><br />Thanks to beatlebrat and DancNSpin for your responses.<br /><br />So, 2 testimonials for Birdcamp. I&#039;ll keep that in mind. I visited Birdcamp a few years ago, Just to gawk at the beautiful parrots and to buy toys for my parents&#039; greys. I thought they were great.&nbsp; <br /><br />Noisy streets--ehhmmm.... I live on Astoria blvd. <br /><br />Once I do get the parrot though, I will be having a &#039;housewarming&#039; and making sure she gets to know all my Astorian friends, to see who would be best to take care of her.... Not everyone is into birds.... or can handle parrots for that matter.... <br /><br />Anyway, well, I will keep all this in mind, and I guess I&#039;m getting my food from Birdcamp!<br /><br />Btw-- I walked into Uptown Birds the other day. A very nice store and the staff is very nice and helpful as well. <br /><br />Thanks again for your help!<br /><br /><br />

				hello astorian parrot owners again...<br /><br />my little senegal has been with me here in Astoria since Memorial Day weekend. she&#039;s doing pretty good, and getting into all kinds of trouble. i found one of my earrings in her food tray last week...luckily, it was still in once piece. she&#039;s teaching me to be more organized. ;) <br /><br />so, i have realized that my little girl has a blood feather. <br />how serious is this? do i need to get this removed ASAP?<br />if so, should i go to one of these animal hospitals/vet places? do they work with parrots?<br />would a place like Birdcamp be able to remove a blood feather?<br />any other suggestions?<br /><br />she&#039;s doing ok, but i know it&#039;s bothering her... <br /><br />thanks

				Not sure what you mean, but all feathers start out as blood feathers.&nbsp; The below is from http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=15+1829&amp;aid=2776 (http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=15+1829&amp;aid=2776)<br />Like hair, feathers develop in a specialized area in the skin called a follicle. As a new feather develops, it has an artery and vein that extends up through the shaft and nourishes the feather. A feather at this stage is called a blood feather. Due to the color of the blood supply, the shaft of a blood feather will appear dark, whereas the shaft of an older, mature feather will be white. A blood feather has a larger quill (calamus) than a mature feather. A blood feather starts out with a waxy keratin sheath that protects it while it grows. When the feather is mature, the blood supply will recede and the waxy sheath will be removed by the bird.<br /><br />Although an adult bird will typically replace all of its feathers during a molt, the loss of feathers is staggered, often over several months, so the bird has enough feathers for flight and insulation. A molt is usually triggered by the change in day length or may occur after breeding. Some wild birds, such as goldfinches, who molt twice a year, change from a bright plumage during the breeding season to a more somber plumage for the rest of the year.

				no, it&#039;s a blood feather in her tail, it&#039;s not that it&#039;s just growing in.<br /><br />it didnt grow correctly, and that keratin sheath still has blood in it-- i see a little tinge of red at the top of the sheath where the feather is coming out. and when i searched blood feather, it says that it needs to be removed, but i can&#039;t tell how serious this is:<br /><br />http://www.petparrot.com/Injuries.htm#Broken%20Blood%20Feather

				From what I can see of the article you posted, they are talking about a broken feather, and that it is better to pull out a broken feather since design of the shaft causes more blood loss.&nbsp; Is this feather broken, or is it whole?&nbsp; &nbsp;If it&#039;s a whole feather, I would leave it alone.&nbsp; &nbsp;Only if it&#039;s sticking out and you&#039;re afraid it will truly present a problem of breaking in the future, would I maybe call your local vet and see what they say.&nbsp; I&#039;m doubting that a place like Birdcamp would want the liability, but it&#039;s possible and doesn&#039;t hurt to ask.&nbsp; It would probably only take a few minutes in any case.&nbsp; You could also do it yourself, but you would need an extra set of hands and some styptic pencils on hand (usually a good idea to keep some styptic pencils around anyway).
