				It would be interesting to see their polling data adjusted against party identification.&nbsp; In other words, economists could be for or against a candidate for various reasons, but still see their economic policies as problematic.<br /><br />In fairness to President Obama, I think we should hold out on judgment.&nbsp; He is dealing with an unprecedented economic crisis.&nbsp; I disagree with most of his fundamental economic assumptions, but I do respect that he&#039;s trying.<br /><br />I do think that this speaks to a point I made throughout the election.&nbsp; Obama prior to becoming president existed only as potential energy.&nbsp; Now it&#039;s time to deliver on his promises.&nbsp; But people hung their hopes on him more than any other candidate in memory.&nbsp; Heck, he even branded himself as the &quot;hope&quot; candidate.&nbsp; And it turns out, Obama is just a man, and a politician like any other.&nbsp; I don&#039;t fault him for it, but it was a bit naive of the American public to expect him to transcend all that.&nbsp; Maybe what I think is about to happen to the economy will be cathartic.

				Wait, Wait , Wait! He spends a considerable amount of time talking about how awful everything is, to get a &quot;stimulus&quot; package passed which has very few stimulants. He does this for the sole purpose of getting a favored liberal agenda jammed down the throats of tax paying Americans. For which our progeny will be paying, probably, their entire life. He then endorses a porked up budget bill, in direct contradiction to his many promises. He quadruples the deficit and then promises to cut that in half. And when all that is done, when all the hyped up fear mongering, all the predictions of the Apocalypse start coming to bear, he sends out Lawrence Summers to say the economy is doing poorly because people are irrational in their fear.<br />http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090313/ap_on_bi_ge/obama_economy<br />Well guess what Larry? It was your administration that purposely pumped up and use the fear to get the government more involved in the day to day lives of the American people.<br /><br />Next up; Cap and Trade. Let see how the Global Changling folks try to convince people that the unseasonably cool last year was because we don&#039;t give enough money to Al Gore.

In fact I think he&#039;s going way too quickly and signing away too many dollars at once. But so far, those dollars haven&#039;t struck me as being much against what he said when he was running, aside from seeming like he couldn&#039;t possibly have had enough time to look through and think about everything before signing it (which is a big concern). As for earmarks, I thought McCain made the bigger deal about being against those, and Obama ended up getting roped into the discussion.<br /><br />EDIT: That said, if I hear the phrase &quot;The worst economic/financial crisis since the Great Depression&quot; one more time... well, I&#039;m going to be annoyed.

				It&#039;s really surprising to see people claim Obama is a Socialist. Many of my conservative friends are suddenly coming out of the woodwork saying that the government is moving towards Socialism. If that&#039;s the case I want to know where they&#039;ve been the last 8 years?! Talk about expansion of government!<br /><br />That being said, I hardly think Obama qualifies as a Socialist by conservative definition. The repetitive use of this word by the right shows how out of touch they remain with reality. While I welcome the change in the White House, and have more confidence in Obama on an intellectual level, he really hasn&#039;t broken from Bush&#039;s economic policies in any substantial way.<br /><br />I realize he&#039;s only been in office for a short time though, and there&#039;s a giant mess to deal with at the moment. Talk about learning on the job. At any rate, I&#039;m glad to have him as president, even if I don&#039;t think he&#039;s as far left as the right makes him out to be, or as I&#039;d like him to be.

				Good grief. The first sentence of the Wikipedia entry:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Socialism refers to a broad set of economic theories of social organization advocating public or state ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods, and a society characterized by equality for all individuals, with a fair or egalitarian method of compensation.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m not exactly sure how trying to rescue the capitalist system (from itself) is equivalent to advocating state ownership of the means of production! Even if the large banks have to be eventually nationalized, it would be for perhaps as long as... a week. And then they&#039;d go back to private ownership. <br /><br />Obama is a moderate liberal with a fondness for paternalistic libertarianism. Nobody on his team wants the government to run the financial system, or the manufacturing sector, or really anything that it doesn&#039;t currently run already.

GWB was severely criticized for using the threat of terrorism to advance, what some believe, as an assault on personal liberties. O&#039;Bama (Happy St. Pat&#039;s Day) is using the threat of a depression to advance an assault on financial liberties. <br />So why the governance by crisis?

Case in point: http://www.scribd.com/doc/13112282/Aig-Systemic-090309<br /><br />How the hell should Obama know how to respond to that? And Geithner, who should know better, doesn&#039;t seem to be good for anything aside from getting &quot;outraged&quot; when bailed out companies pay out bonuses, even though there was no agreement reached beforehand that they should not pay out huge bonuses if they get the money. These people didn&#039;t learn from the other dollar giveaways that people will turn around and use the money as they wish if there are no stipulations stating otherwise. I think it&#039;s total bullshit that they want to righteously demand the money back (or even better, suggest that the bonus recipients resign or kill themselves) or just tax it out of the bonus recipients. They should write this off as a result of their stupidity and do better next time. $165 million in bonus payouts is nothing compared to the total amount AIG has gotten from the government.<br /><br />I am so sick of all politicians, and I have no faith in any of them to actually do what a thinking person with a conscience would do, as opposed to acting in their own self-interest and trying to appease &quot;the taxpayers&quot; by crying outrage in order to get some airtime and get re-elected. The Republicans aren&#039;t any better than the Democrats and have been behaving in an equally ludicrous manner. These people all suck.

Their protestations are telling.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I really doubt that anyone on this board has a real idea of what &#039;Socialism&#039; really is.&nbsp; There are definitions in the Dictionary obviously, but unless one has lived in a Socialist country (not Communist, that is not what I am talking about), how would you really know the pros and cons?&nbsp; I have spent time in France and Sweden but I have not really had the chance to live there and to see what problems they encounter.&nbsp; The bottom line I think is this - no one system is really ideal.&nbsp; Obviously, our Capitalist system has it&#039;s problems and issues.&nbsp; Right now, I think our Nation is suffering because of extreme behaviour of some of it&#039;s citizens.&nbsp; There are so many victims out there who are suffering however, who have done nothing to deserve this.&nbsp; I think the real test will come if the economy does not turn around (God forbid).&nbsp; Someone, please answer my question - what happens to a fellow citizen who was not able to save any money due to low wages and living check to check, has lost his or her job, unemployment and Cobra run out, and they cannot get another job???&nbsp;

I don&#039;t necessarily buy all that either. I also don&#039;t buy that giving a bunch of money to the poor is going to make things any better, as opposed to giving poor people less of an incentive to stop being poor as they receive more benefits from the government. <br /><br />All this TARP stuff and the general economic direction that we&#039;re headed in scares me. The TARP thing alone, I could deal with. Fine. But now they want to claw back the bonuses that were paid back to INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES. Employees that in most cases didn&#039;t even ask for a bonus - they just received it, because that&#039;s how the banking industry works. For the government to try to claw back that money, to me, is seriously fucked up and wrong. There were no stipulations in the original bills saying bonuses couldn&#039;t be paid, and the people who got bonuses have been free to spend it up until now. So what happens if congress goes ahead and taxes that 90-100%? What if the bankers can&#039;t pay that money back? Imagine if you were a decent person who had a job at an investment bank (yes, there are decent people who work at investment banks). Your salary was $100,000, and you got a bonus of $200,000. Excitedly, you went out and bought an apartment in the city, which you could now afford. Then imagine hearing that congress wants to tax that money out of you after you already got it and spent it. Now do you understand why I, and a lot of others, are rather angry and frankly a little terrified? Do you understand why the vilification of bankers, and the demand for all the bonus recipients names to be released, all sounds a bit too much like McCarthyism?<br /><br />Honestly, anyone who doesn&#039;t see through all this phony populist outrage from our politicians isn&#039;t really paying attention. This is dangerous territory. I don&#039;t trust Congress, and I have no faith in Geithner. Even if Obama is a good man and could be a good president, I get the feeling he&#039;s powerless with what&#039;s going on.

Clearly this survey report deals with social security only. I honestly understand the need for a basic safety net but it is not where we get in trouble. The trouble comes from government programs that take on a life of their own. Food stamps are a great example. It quickly gets morphed with school lunch programs. But then breakfast programs get thrown in. Stop and say &quot;wait, is this a good idea?&quot; and you will quickly be labelled as someone who hates children and the poor. But who is pushing these programs? And then the government will expand these programs to people who neither need them or want them. Example: Here is the USDA site that give helpful instructions on how to &quot;market&quot; (their word, not mine) school breakfast programs:<br /><br />http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/breakfast/expansion/marketingideas.htm#celebrate<br /><br />My favorite is where they suggest using a recorded message for parents who are on hold!<br />This insanity needs to stop. The citizens of this great nations are yelling past each other while every avenue of public (and private) life is being infested by politicians who have but one goal: self aggrandizing.

				I have mixed feelings. I don&#039;t think AIG should have used the bailout $$ for the bonuses. Better to have found another way to pay it, or to go back to the employees and re-negotiate. <br /><br />My initial assumption was that the people getting bonuses are all &quot;fat cats&quot; who are pulling in a few hundred thousand a year. But really, a lot of those people are probably lower-level employees, making under 100K, who made plans and committments based on the bonus that was promised to them. I can put myself in their shoes and see how much it could hurt to be counting on a couple thousand dollars and then not get it. They&#039;re not separate from us - they are threatened by the economy too, and worried about losing their jobs too. They aren&#039;t getting bonuses in a vacuum. <br /><br />I&#039;m not comfortable with the tax, either. But I need to read more about it. <br /><br />I interviewed for a job at AIG a couple of years ago. Just as well I didn&#039;t get it. <br />

				In all this, I wonder if I or anyone else would vote or lobby differently in 2010 or 2012? After just some weeks, it is difficult to imagine what things would be like some months later though 2010 is next year. And 2012 seems like a far distant and different future.<br /><br />Been thinking about some of the commentary and some of the linked articles. One of my favorite questions mentioned here and elsewhere is what is the &quot;exit plan&quot; from govt. investment in banks and what would be a post-stimulus budget?<br /><br />While I have some friends that dream of living overseas in a socialist country, I have a few others that would turn down social security, public schooling, and many other govt sponsored programs.<br /><br />I find the idea of looking at &#039;tax freedom day&#039; and comparing countries and over time interesting. However, I wish they would also consider govt. debt and how long it would take to have &#039;public debt freedom&#039; as well.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Freedom_Day</span><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Tax Freedom Day for 2008 is April 23, for a total average effective tax rate of 30.8 percent of the nation&#039;s income. <br />The latest that Tax Freedom Day has occurred was May 3 in 2000. <br />In 1900, Tax Freedom Day arrived January 22, for an effective average total tax rate of 5.9 percent of the nation&#039;s income. <br /><br />According to the Tax Foundation, the most important factor driving changes in Tax Freedom Day from year to year is growth in incomes, as the progressive structure of the U.S. federal tax system causes taxes as a percentage of income to rise along with inflation.<br /><br />In 2008, Alaska had the lowest total tax burden, earning enough to pay all their tax obligations by March 29. <br />Connecticut had the heaviest tax burden— Tax Freedom Day there arrived May 8. <br />New Jersey had the second heaviest tax burden, having to work until May 7 to pay their total taxes.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br />Most developed and developing nations have a mixed capitalist or mixed socialist economy.

				As has already be seen with some of the executuve nominees, the tax code is complex and full compliance is unlikely.<br /><br />If the claims of the govt. programs would be true, why should they be done at the federal level rather than state or local or privately? Why not make taxes voluntary?<br /><br />Just curious, tax payers have options to have a few dollars go to political campaigns, to<br />breast cancer research, to children&#039;s fund, to memorials, ... who does?<br />And everyone is free if they wish to give to any number of non-profit programs including education scholarships.<br />How many trillions does the federal govt. really need?<br /><br />How much does it cost to run the courts, Congress and a limited executive?<br />I dont see why it must be thousands of billions.<br /><br />How would I feel? If it is voluntary, great. But that is not govt. That is a key difference between govt. and most choices.<br /><br />Our country is too broke to make many of these &#039;beneficial&#039; programs optional.

As a libertarian, I would oppose this program. It forcibly confiscates the property of one individual for the betterment of other individuals. If given a choice between freedom and prosperity, I choose freedom. <br />Please realize my answer, like your question, is a perfect, not real world, scenario. I do understand that I am a member of society. And I understand that not all societal decisions are made by me (unfortunately). <br />But let&#039;s look a little deeper into this program.

				<br />Many are probably very well intentioned. But I was looking at Recovery.gov and the link to projects for NYS.<br />I am more shocked than I would expect to be how little is investment and how much is stimulating govt. spending.<br /><br /><br />I wonder if the govt. would actually allow for private banking with great risks and rewards and remove govt. backstopping. Of course, it would be investor and buyer beware. Employment would likely be more volatile.<br />Govt. revenues would be more volatile.<br /><br /><br />How much of the govt. concern involves their tax revenue and govt. employee support?<br /><br /><br />Their is a safety net but it works in 2 ways. Stabilizing. It keeps folks from falling as far as quickly, but there is also a govt. net keeping folks lower from rising as high as their endeavors should allow.<br /><br />&nbsp;:-)&nbsp; :cry:

Supermarkets, distribution centers, transport/trucking, agriculture are just of industries that benefit, industries that provide a variety of jobs at a variety of income levels and pay taxes back into the system. <br /><br />In the end though, if every penny the government spends is confiscated as you say, how can any government spending be justified?

				Did anyone see the Stossel report (last week?) about privatizing roads? I think most things can be handled privately better than the job our govt. is doing. I had my doubts about the logistics of roads, tolls, etc... but it looks like Indiana is leading the way on this. Why? Incentives. As long as there isn&#039;t a monopoly (like our govt.) to handle the work, that company has every interest to make sure it&#039;s safe, affordable, efficient, and cost-effective to them. And by the way, who the F! cares if they make money, too? We all benefit if they&#039;re competing with someone else. Unless you plan on moving to a different state with a different tax code or a different country, our govt. is never competing with anyone. Ever heard of the BIG DIG and the fatal error there? How many govt./union engineers does it take to build one bridge? Apparently, as long as there are taxpayers to feed it. The only consequences to politicians is not being reelected, that and prostitutes and family scandals. They&#039;re not worried about our ire, they&#039;re worried about holding on to their own power for their next term.

I suspect it was to lay a groundwork of &quot;who could be against such a program?&quot; But in failing to include all the negatives of food stamps, and welfare in general, you were being somewhat disingenuous. First off, it does not do all those wonderful things without a net negative economic effect. Second, the removal of responsibility from the parents to the government has had a catastrophic effect on the American family. Although changes have been made, it actual has more incentives to not marry when there are children involved.<br />&nbsp;

				<br />http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/<br /><br />Recyling TARP funds into <strong>campaign cash</strong>? <br /><br /><br />Per Newsweek, some U.S. financial institutions that are currently receiving TARP funds are STILL making political contributions to Democrats and Republicans. “In recent filings with the Federal Election Commission, the political action committee for Bank of America (which got $15 billion in bailout money) sent out $24,500 in the first two months of 2009, including $1,500 to House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and another $15,000 to members of the House and Senate banking panels. <br /><br />Citigroup ($25 billion) dished out $29,620, including $2,500 to House GOP Eric Cantor, who also got $10,000 from UBS which, while not a TARP recipient, got $5 billion in bailout funds as an AIG ‘counterparty.’ ‘This certainly appears to be a case of TARP funds being recycled into campaign contributions,’ says Brett Kappell, a D.C. lawyer who tracks donations.” It&#039;s amazing. We&#039;re doing a detailed analysis, which will be posted on First Read later today. <br /><br />But needless to say, in the month of February, thousands of dollars exchanged hands between financial institution PACs and members of Congress and the political parties. In fact, Bank of America on Feb. 17, 2009, gave $15,000 EACH to the DSCC, DCCC, NRSC and NRCC. <br /><br />Who’s dumber here -- the banks that are cutting political checks in this environment, or the members of Congress or political parties who are asking for them? And what&#039;s the difference between an AIG using taxpayer money to fulfill bonus contracts, and Bank of America taking taxpayer money and funneling some of it BACK to Washington in the form of campaign contributions? <br /><br />And you wonder why the country and the press are so cynical sometimes. <br /><br />&nbsp;:evil:&nbsp; &nbsp; :cry:

They are personal crises. I understand it doesn&#039;t make it any better to the individual, but the sum of the personal crises does not equal a national crisis. <br />The response proposed to address these crisis is single payer, or nationalizing, health care. The most obvious problem with that is the inevitable rationing of health care. So what is the greater crisis, not being able to afford all of the health care that one desires, or not being able to get that health care at any cost?<br />I know that there are many who advocate nationalized health care who say that the rationing argument is a red herring. But how else do you supply a good that has no cost to the individual? The line for unnecessary medical tests would be so long that those who truly needed it would rarely find them available.<br />There are two other points that, I feel, need to be made: The first is why should the collective subsidize the risky behavior of the individual?&nbsp; Why do I have to pay for the passenger who doesn&#039;t where a seatbelt? Why should you pay for my poor health habits? And not to be personal, but why would nonsmokers pay for a smokers bad habits? We are a nation of individuals, and these individuals are free to make choices. Those choices should not negatively impact the livelihood of there fellow citizens.<br />The second point is more straight forward. We have no money. Taking money from future generations to pay for our healthcare is wrong.

Nearly everyone is at some point going to require medical attention on a basis that is generally involuntary unless they want to die. Treating health insurance as some sort of luxury or perk of the gainfully employed doesn&#039;t sit right with me. Maybe &quot;insurance&quot; is the wrong name for health care services. I think it kind of stinks that, even though I have a job that I am grateful for, it doesn&#039;t offer health benefits; so my only options are to go uninsured and hope for the best, or to pay several hundred dollars a month for coverage. Either the government should offer a government health plan, or somehow health care costs need to come way down. <br /><br />You might be skeptical of this, but there have been studies done that show that, while the US has the highest health care costs in the world, we&#039;re not really any healthier than people in countries that have less expensive health care. This is a big one that came out recently: http://www.businessroundtable.org/news/healthcarestudy<br /><br />From the study:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">o As a group, G-5 countries spend about 63 cents for every dollar the U.S. spends on health care – yet the health of the U.S. workforce lags by 10% in a composite measure.<br />o The gap is even wider in relation to rising economic powers: the three BIC countries spend just 15% of what we spend on health care, yet the health of the U.S. workforce trails that of BIC countries by 5%.<br />o In terms of per capita spending, the United States spends $828 more per person than G-5 countries and $1,654 more per person than BIC countries.<br />o When you look just at employer spending, in 2006, American businesses paid 73 cents more per hour more for health benefits than those in the G-5 group – a disparity that grew by nearly 50% between 2004 and 2006.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

And really, I&#039;m not that skeptical of this. But there are a few things in this report they the businessroundtable chose to gloss over. First and foremost when talking about about BIC they purposely chose work force to work force, which is not a fair comparison. They also, I far as i can tell, never touch on the issue of how much American healthcare costs subsidize other countries, particularly in pharmaceuticals. <br />On a side note, I have spent years working in both Brazil and India. Including setting up new employee benefits packages, although this is definitely not my area of expertise. I have also need medical medical care in both nations. From experience I can say that neither country&#039;s health care system is considerably better or worse than this country. But both of them are far less regulated. (that&#039;s a good thing in my book). For example, when I needed antibiotics in India, I didn&#039;t have to go see a doctor, I just went to the pharmacist and told him what I had and what I needed and he filled the prescription on the spot. Try that at Rite-Aid. The point that I am laboring to make is that; I agree! Our system needs improvement! But....<br />Pounding people over the head and screaming &quot;It&#039;s a crisis&quot; serves only the entrenched bureaucracy and their handlers. Ask conservatives who is to blame and they will tell you &quot;Trial Lawyers&quot; ask liberals who is to blame and they will say &quot;Big Pharma&quot; or &quot;Insurance Companies&quot;. In reality, it is the politicians on their payroll who are to blame. <br />You want a lower cost solution. Other states have different rules that may be able to satisfy exactly what you need. You are prohibited by law to purchase those plans if they are not sanctioned by the State of New York. That says just about everything I need to know about our current state of healthcare.

Seriously... as a card carrying member of the Misanthropic Party.. well. <br />I&#039;ve been looking through congressional bills in the works. I found a few healthcare-based ones that are very long, and I don&#039;t have the patience to look through them right now:<br /><br /><strong>American Health Security Act of 2009</strong> - &quot;To provide for health care for every American and to control the cost and enhance the quality of the health care system.&quot; - http://frwebgate5.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/TEXTgate.cgi?WAISdocID=195362419836+8+1+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve<br /><br /><strong>Healthy Americans Act </strong>- &quot;To provide affordable, guaranteed private health coverage that will make Americans healthier and can never be taken away.&quot; http://frwebgate5.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/TEXTgate.cgi?WAISdocID=195362419836+20+1+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve<br /><strong><br />Health Coverage, Affordability, Responsibility, and Equity Act of 2009</strong> - &quot;To expand the number of individuals and families with health insurance coverage, and for other purposes.&quot; - http://frwebgate5.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/TEXTgate.cgi?WAISdocID=195362419836+29+1+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve<br /><br /><strong>National Health Insurance Act</strong> - &quot;To provide a program of national health insurance, and for other purposes.&quot; - http://frwebgate5.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/TEXTgate.cgi?WAISdocID=195362419836+37+1+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve<br /><br />As far as I can tell, these are all still active. The number of congressional bills completely boggles my mind - I watch these people talk and can&#039;t believe any of them are actually reading this stuff.

There weren&#039;t many great alternatives. The stimulus package was to prevent 10% unemployment from spiraling into 20% unemployment. Most people would rather pay a few thousand dollars than to have a much higher risk losing all of their income (aside from safety net programs) for a year or two! And the government now owns a majority of GM, a tiny Michigan-based company, worth maybe $1 billion, with little prospect of becoming an industrial giant any time soon. So?<br /><br />Statistics mean many things. The number in the Atlantic piece includes household debt, including mortgages. And mean debt doesn&#039;t mean that someone with median income has to pay that amount off, it means that someone with mean income (which is a lot higher) has to pay that amount off.<br /><br />Besides, unless the Feds implement a 5-Year-Plan For the American Economy, it&#039;s not really socialism, it&#039;s just a public-private partnership. Like, say, the Army. Or Medicare. Or the Port Authority of NY&amp;NJ. (Except that the government wants out of GM as soon as practical.)<br />

I&#039;m no fan of GM&#039;s management, nor of the UAW for that matter, but supporting that little company&#039;s workers for a couple of years may result in a less catastrophic effect to the economy as a whole than letting the whole company collapse. You might feel differently if you lived in the midwest. It&#039;s certainly a political decision, though. Not in the sense of politics, but in the sense that it&#039;s an exception to the normal rules that we&#039;re making simply because people want it. California&#039;s going bankrupt -- you want Michigan to start defaulting on its debts too? Also, if GM had collapsed a few years ago, when the economy is growing, there would be a lot less value to supporting it during bankruptcy. Now, letting it fail catastrophically would have been a Hummer on the camel&#039;s back. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;ll believe that only when I see it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />(referring to the government wanting out of GM.) Well, do you honestly think Congress would let the administration hold on to GM, even if it wanted to? I&#039;m not sure what motivation you think the administration has in wanting to run a crappy auto company. Obama was elected on a platform of health care, education, and energy reform, not on running car companies. This is a distraction from his real goals. I&#039;d also like to point out the Chrysler is out of bankruptcy already, just as promised.

Well, stop posting to Astorians and get to work, my friend! :)<br /><br />A better way to think about it may be that the national debt is approaching 100% of annual GDP. Which means that to pay it all back, the entire economy would have to go towards debt service for a year. Or 5% of the entire economy for 20 years (more like 15, with typical inflation rates). It&#039;s not a great situation, and I&#039;m no fan of deficits in boom times (why were we running a deficit from 2003-2007, again??), but it&#039;s not the end of the world. Everybody agrees that the deficit needs to go towards 0 rapidly as the economy picks up again, or else there&#039;ll be problems with inflation (as the Fed increases interest rates to get people to buy Treasury bills that seem less likely to be paid back). I think we all hope that that happens. (Both the growing economy and the balanced budgets.)<br /><br />
