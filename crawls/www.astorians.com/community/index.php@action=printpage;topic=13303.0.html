				He feels no remorse for having committed treason by outing a CIA member.<br /><br />http://thinkprogress.org/2008/12/03/novak-plame-2/<br /><br />Yeah, it&#039;s apparently okay to commit treason, and he&#039;d do it again because he feels the political left tried to ruin him.<br /><br />- Cannibal<br />Besides, it ought to be a crime for outing a hot female spy.&nbsp; :-P

				So Joe Wilson lying in a NY Times op-ed had nothing to do with his wife&#039;s &quot;outing&quot;? Novak did nothing wrong and his &quot;reporting&quot; of sensitive information isn&#039;t even a fraction of what the Times did.

Perhaps you would be so kind as to extact it from the actual article;<br /><br />http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/20/AR2005102000874.html<br /><br />Then we can go to the Senate Intelligence Committee report and see what they came up with. <br /><br />Joe Wilson is a tool and the smoking hot spy is everything that is wrong with our intelligence committee. His report actually bolstered the claims of yellow cake being purchased from Niger. And the 48 yo retiree being sent on an intelligence mission is really what government budget personnel really need to look into.
