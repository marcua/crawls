				Hi Astoria Guitarists, <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m Dennis. I&#039;m formerly a guitar maker and am working to open a coffee shop in the neighborhood. I have a luthier friend who is curious about Astoria for opening a guitar building / repair business. I imagine you guys have to take your stuff to Manhattan for good work?

				I believe there&#039;s a few in Astoria. I know there&#039;s a low-key one between Ditmars and 23rd ave on Crescent (Alpha). There&#039;s also one on 30th ave and 35th street called &quot;Astoria Music&quot;. There&#039;s one on 35th ave and 31st Street (forgot the name). Then there&#039;s one 41st ave and 21st Street (Sadowsky). Last but not least, Guitar center on northern blvd - but I wouldn&#039;t call them luthiers.

				I would definitely be interested in learning about the services that would be offered. Acoustic only, or does he work on electric and resonator guitars also? Setups?

I usually do all repairs myself. But from what I heard, people are generally happy with the current options. I do want to get one of my necks partially scalloped down the line and that&#039;s something I wouldn&#039;t want to do myself. I would rather give it to a craftsman. Would I go to one of the guys I mentioned above? Probably. Would I love to see a luthier working in the front with big windows? Obviously. Would it be successful in Astoria? I really couldn&#039;t tell you that. I would think if you catered to guitarists, violinists, cellists and other instruments, than I would probably say yes. <br />&nbsp;<br />By the way, what kind of coffee do you have exactly? I heard some good things about it.

				Hi Astoria Bot, <br /><br /><br />Thanks for the input. The guitar maker in a window thing is like you suggested, mostly a nice thought. Although we have had some interesting discussions about doing something together here. <br /><br /><br />About the coffee, we have whole-bean micro-roasted coffee from Ohio. It&#039;s the same coffee we&#039;ll be using at our shop. I&#039;m glad to hear you&#039;ve gotten positive reviews. Let me know if you&#039;d like to hear more. Thanks for the interest!
