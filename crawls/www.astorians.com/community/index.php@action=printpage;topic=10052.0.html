				So do you have to be absolutely single to go?&nbsp; And do you have to be looking for a relationship to go?&nbsp; I just want to keep meeting more fun Astorians.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to go and be booed and have peanuts thrown at me for having other intentions.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh crap that was a waste of a post- I&#039;m out of town on this night. Damn it, Janet!&nbsp; I&#039;ve been wanting to have a mid-week mixer and I&#039;m always available during the week.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; Have fun!

				I see that the mixer starts at 7PM. I will be at work until about 8:30 and won&#039;t be back home to Astoria until around 9. I guess this means I can&#039;t make it? There&#039;s not really any way to predict that you all will still be hanging out until then right? Maybe I should just pass by anyway and say hello?&nbsp; Advice or suggestions? How many question marks can I get away with?

There are quite a few of us who live around this area. ::waves to other rollergirls:: <br /><br />Unfortunately, I will not be going to the singles mixer because a) I despise dating and am rather happily single, and b) I have somehow found myself dating someone I am quite smitten with as of late. Now, how the hell did that happen? Crazy.

				Hey everyone, it looks like we&#039;re going to have a good turnout. <br /><br />The marketing manager of ZogSports has asked if they could send one of their representatives to the event to &quot;casually chat with everyone and let them know how they can meet and let them know how to meet other singles&quot; through ZogSports activities.<br /><br />I thought it was a very nice gesture for her to reach out personally to me and, for the record, I really support what they are doing in the City.&nbsp; I know people on this board who participate in ZogSports and they love the experience.&nbsp; This summer they are starting a whiffle ball league in Astoria and as an added bonus the ZogSport representative has offered to raffle a free membership for the league.&nbsp; http://www.zogsports.org/<br /><br />That being said, how do people feel about having a representative at the mixer?&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to speak for the group so I will leave it up to you folks to discuss and decide on the board.&nbsp; However, if you want to express your opinion, you should probably respond by later tonight or early tomorrow evening, as she needs to arrange for one of her members to attend.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks.&nbsp;

				Hey I had a great time, despite showing up horribly late and being very tired.&nbsp; Don&#039;t take it personally.&nbsp; Sorry about that, yesterday was a very active day for me - it was so nice out - I spent most of the day playing outside in Astoria Park.&nbsp; But I had a nice time meeting new people at Indigo, I probably missed a good amount of you, I showed up 9:45pm or so.&nbsp; But a few of us hung out til midnight.&nbsp; It was fun!

				Thanks for all of the &quot;luv.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />I was really nervous before the event, especially when I was told that we might need to move to the garden on the first floor when I had told everyone that it was on the second floor.&nbsp; It was a really nice space and it was great to have our own bartender!<br /><br />Again, I&#039;m glad everyone had a good time.&nbsp; Oh and a special thanks to Murph who made sure that I didn&#039;t fall into traffic as I stumbled down 30th Avenue!&nbsp; <br />
