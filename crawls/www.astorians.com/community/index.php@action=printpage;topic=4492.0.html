				Yep kids, Unky T gotsta go. Anyone interested in buying stuff?<br /><br />Not a whole lot to sell, but I mostly want to be able to sell the hide-a-bed couch, ottoman, and the television. So if anyone is in the market, let me know. I&#39;ll be happy to give details on the goods if you are interested. Taking best offer or suggestions for a worthy place for charitable donation.

				I might be interested in the sofa bed if it&#39;s cheap and small (I don&#39;t have much room in my apartment).&nbsp; Also, do you have a dvd player by any chance?&nbsp; Of a pc monitor with outlet for headphones?&nbsp; Big mirror(s)?&nbsp; You can pm me or reply here.&nbsp; <br /><br />thanks,<br />Renee

				Are you moving out of Astoria? What ever will happen to the weekly Ultimate Frisbee? (Of which I sadly have been a non-participant.)<br /><br />Good luck selling.

				The couch is large. At its widest it&#39;s appx. 94&quot; and about 39&quot; deep. It is not cheap. It&#39;s from Jennifer Convertibles. Most comfortable couch I have ever been on. However, won&#39;t probably go well in a small apartment.<br /><br />Do have at least one DVD player available for sale. Have a Phillips 711 and a Sony which is TBD (don&#39;t feel like looking it up right now.) A dresser, too. Alas no monitor, but I do have an lcd television that has an S-video hookup that can be connected to a computer with the afore mentioned type cable. Not sure that helps the whole pc monitor viewing thing for Rachel.<br /><br />Alas, kungfoofool, you are stuck with me for at least another year. Just decided it&#39;s time for a change of venue. So you will be able to continue avoiding ultimate games in Astoria Park for as long as I am posting about them on the board! Thanks for the luck. A little extra pocket change at the time of a move is a good thing.

I have heard from bunches of people how they don&#39;t like the white couch since I&#39;ve put it up for sale. Perhaps there is another person out there somewhere who is like me and likes it. Perhaps even recover it?<br /><br />I&#39;ll take best offer within reason. It is a large couch so it is not for those without space. Off the top of my head, since I don&#39;t have it written in a place within reach (note to self, make sticky on computer for this), it is roughly 95&quot;x39&quot;. Extremely comfortable. In fact, if I don&#39;t sell it soon, it will be in storage for a while because I&#39;d rather do that than give it to charity (who needs that big a tax write off?) or give it up for nothing. However, if the price is right I&#39;ll let go of it and deal with buying a new one when I get past the next phase of my apartment life.<br /><br />Let me know if you would like to see it in person or some pictures. Couch is from Jennifer Convertibles. Will throw in the ottoman for no extra charge if you buy the couch.

				One picture of hide-a-bed couch as promised to myself oh so long ago. Must be the not so unconscious desire to keep it. Oh the memories. Priceless.<br /><br />(http://i54.photobucket.com/albums/g115/lpelosi/couch2_small.jpg)
