			The NJ nets have a limited-time season ticket offer for only $299!! Although I&#39;m a big fan, 42 games seems like a lot for me, but if there are two other people willing to split with me and my sister, we could each have 2 tickets for 10 games for $150 each! That&#39;s an amazing 7.50 per ticket!!! Any takers?<br /><br />Mic
