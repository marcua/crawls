				I live in the Broadway Crescent area and have to move my car three times a week due to alternate side of the street parking regulations. I would like to know why.<br /><br />I am at work during the no parking times and am not sure if a street cleaner passes by or not. The streets are not noticeably cleaner on days that no parking rules are in effect. My area is residential and there is relatively little traffic. Why the senseless moving of vehicles?

				I don&#039;t have an answer to your quandary but you might be a little happy to know that street cleaning rules are suspended this Thursday, February 12th and next Monday, February 16th.

				Personally, I think the street cleaning regulations in NYC accomplish two things primarily:<br /><br />1) It makes lots of money for the city through parking summonses, probably a lot more than they have to spend on street sweeping vehicles and personnel.<br /><br />2) It creates many additional union jobs. <br /><br />Actual cleanliness of the streets has to fall somewhere way down on the list, especially since, in most cases, the streets really don&#039;t seem noticeably cleaner and quite often seem <em>dirtier</em> after the street sweepers pass.

				Then coordinate the ASSP with garbage collection. this leaves one side free of cars so the truck can move down the block and collect without blocking traffic on the narrower tertiary streets.

				The reason there is alternate side of the street parking is....TO CLEAN THE STREETS. Every Home owner is required to clean 18 inches into the gutter of the length of their property. Does one see this? no. If at best you see an old owner of a house early in the morning sweeping everything in the gutter out side his / her house waiting for the sweeper to come, but infact this is illegal. Property owners are required to clean the area, not push it off. AND.... in areas where there is no alternate street parking the cars NEVER MOVE.. (try to get a parking spot then! ...........lol) Alternate parking is a blessing cause at 11AM&nbsp; or 1pm you will have a parking space. (and a clean gutter thanks to DSNY)

				If property owners are responsible for cleaning and clearing trash 18 inches into the street, the area where almost all of it lays, then why do we need the street sweepers? -- to clear already clean streets? It makes no sense to me.<br /><br />I rather the city put the money it spends on buying and maintaining a fleet of street sweepers into putting personnel on the street to concentrate on cleaning up high traffic areas.

				PJ, if you lived on my block you would see that those trucks do make a difference, and I can understand rnrollgirl&#039;s annoyance with her neighbor. On my block I have habitual gutterlitterers. One lady always sweeps a huge pile of leaves onto the street rather than bagging them; in the summer she&#039;ll pull all the weeds out of her front yard (there&#039;s nothing but weeds in her yard-no flowers or shrubs) after letting them grow a good 3 feet, and simply dumps them-entire plants with roots, and dirt attached- into the street. If the parking spot is empty, drivers are reluctant to park in that spot because of the mess that sits there for days and days. Once when the street sweeper came along to pick up the pile it was so tall the truck couldn&#039;t handle it. Good thing the driver had a shovel handy because he had to get out and scoop all of it up with that shovel. Why can&#039;t she just put the leaves and weeds in a bag for regular pick-up? My neighbor- who thinks she&#039;s classier than everyone on the block- lets all her fliers accumulate in front of her house for several weeks before she decides to &quot;tidy up.&quot; Her method of cleaning this mess has always been to collect all the papers, fliers and business cards and throw them into the street. Once she even threw a Yellow Pages phone book into the street that was left at her door. Sometimes she dumps them in front of her house, sometimes she tosses them in front of my house. Lately though, after twenty something years of doing this she&#039;s been acting more like a human being and carrying the papers to her garbage can. Maybe she read my same complaint about her in the pet peeves thread!<br /><br />Anyway, thank you DSNY for cleaning up after my slovenly neighbors.

				ok thats a valid point....i dont even see any gutters on my block, lol......... but it sounds like some lazzy ass neighbor you have, if i was in your position - i think i would have to say something - and if they dont listen then i would tell that sanitation cop about it as they love to give out tickets for stuff like that.... as for the yellow book - at night i would of picked it up and threw it back on her door over and over again, but thats just me.

				Ha, ha! I&#039;ve already done that-throw her garbage back into her yard, say something to her-many times! And she&#039;d been ticketed too. She&#039;s just a wacko.

				As I&#039;ve mentioned before, I&#039;ve NEVER even seen a street sweeper come through my block in 24 years. Or even seen evidence that one has come through. Yes, I&#039;m out for most of the day- but over that time, I&#039;ve been home plenty of times either ill or waiting for a cable guy or something. A sweeper makes a distinct sound so you&#039;d know if one came by. I&#039;ve never found one of the steel bristles from the brushes they use, or the pattern of leftover dirt that a cleaner leaves. It&#039;s been a kind of minor obsession to try and see if there&#039;s been any street cleaning on my block.
