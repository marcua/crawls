			I have noticed several times in recent memory that a new member join this site only to post numerous posts of spam messages flooding these message boards. I recommend that there either be a vetting process before approving new members, or a limitation on the number of posts a new member can post in a day. It&#039;s very off putting to visit this site and see it swamped with spam posts. And I&#039;m sure it&#039;s very time consuming for the moderators.<br /><br /><br />

			I believe today is the third day in a row where there is a new member posting spam messages. Is there anything that can be done to screen new members?
