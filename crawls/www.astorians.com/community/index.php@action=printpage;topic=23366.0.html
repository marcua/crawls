				Another dynamic duo of dance performance comes to Green Space (http://www.greenspacestudio.org) for the start of the 2012 2013 season. Join us September 15th 8:30 pm!<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>PITH (http://www.pithdance.org)</strong><br /><br />&nbsp;Arid, Arms Full is&nbsp; &nbsp;a ritualistic, often obsessive work that is driven by intense focus and&nbsp; &nbsp;unassuming sensuality. The piece explores the desperation of drought&nbsp; &nbsp;and how the thirst-driven quest for water reflects our potential to&nbsp; &nbsp;reshape ourselves to adapt, survive, inspire, and ultimately achieve our highest form of self.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Lauren Hale Dance (http://www.laurenhaledance.com/)</strong><br /><div style="text-align: right;">&quot;<em>The metaphoric use of the rocking chair artfully assisted the choreographer&nbsp; &nbsp;to illustrate family life in this well-developed dance work. The use of&nbsp; &nbsp;the chair ranged from lulling, secure and nurturing to powerful and&nbsp; &nbsp;destructive; thus epitomizing the universal dysfunction in every family.</em>&quot;– Walter Rutledge, Harlem World Magazine</div><br />&nbsp;<em>Three Stories Below</em> is a collaborative performance piece by dancer/choreographer Lauren&nbsp; &nbsp;Hale Biniaris and award-winning fiction writer Caedra Scott-Flaherty.&nbsp; &nbsp; The piece explores the inner and outer worlds of a family from a&nbsp; &nbsp;daughter&#039;s perspective and is comprised of three sections of dance,&nbsp; &nbsp;three short stories, and three original music scores. The dance sections&nbsp; &nbsp;and short-stories were all created sequentially in response to one&nbsp; &nbsp;another, meaning that one of Caedra’s stories was the impetus for the&nbsp; &nbsp;first dance section that Lauren choreographed; that dance then inspired a&nbsp; &nbsp;new story, which inspired a new dance, and so on, until three stories&nbsp; &nbsp;and three sections of dance were generated. One of the goals of this&nbsp; &nbsp;recursive process was to explore how dance and fiction could function as collaborative partners, engaging one another in an ongoing dialogue.&nbsp; Although the three dance sections have already been performed individually, the Take Root performance will be the premiere of the piece in its entirety.<br /><em>This piece is made possible in part by the Queens Council on the Arts with public funding from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, The Field&#039;s Emerging Artist Residency program supported by the Tides Foundation, and Dance New Amsterdam&#039;s RAW Material Program.</em><br />&nbsp;<br />For tickets and other information click here (http://www.greenspacestudio.org/Tickets.html)!<br />Hope to see you there!<br />
