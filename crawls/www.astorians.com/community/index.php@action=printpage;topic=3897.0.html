				<strong>Klezmer Story is a new play written and performed by Shauna Kanter and Margot Leverett. This new piece by two artists on the cutting edge of Jewish culture tells the story of a klezmer tune as it&#39;s passed from generation to generation, from old world villages to our global village. </strong> Like a microcosm of jewish life, the tune brings to life the story of a people. Tickets are $10 for adults, $5 for teenagers, and free for children 12 and under and are available at the door. Call ahead for large groups. The performance will be about 1 hour long and there may be a question and answer period afterwards.<br /><br /><em>Shauna Kanter is an award-winning playwright who has written and directed in Israel, Palestine, Germany, France, England and throughout America. She teaches acting at the Stella Adler Studio in New York and has appeared as an actor in Broadway, off-Broadway, regional theatre and film. She is the artistic director of VOICEtheatre in NY.<br /><br />Margot Leverett is one of the foremost of the new generation of klezmer clarinetists. She has performed with the Folksbiene Yiddish theatre and has toured with Theo Bikel, Bruce Adler, and Joel Gray. She was a founding member of the Klezmatics and now leads her own band, &quot;Margot Leverett and the Klezmer Mountain Boys.</em><br /><br /><strong>Astoria Center of Israel Synagogue<br />27-35 Crescent Street, Astoria 718-278-2680<br />http://www.astoriacenter.org</strong><br />Take the N or W subway towards Queens to the 30th Avenue stop. Walk west on 30th Avenue (towards Athens Square Park) for about 4 short blocks; turn right on Crescent Street and walk a half block down on the right.
