				My partner and I walked down 30th Ave to the Socrates Sculpture Garden as the sun was setting. Here are a few pics from one piece in the garden. Unfortunately, I kinda forgot to note the artist or the name of the piece. <br /><br />The other thing I realized today is that I need to go down there more than once a year. I can&#039;t imagine what it would look like in the morning. <br /><br />(http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2547/3714993285_e2479a5f31.jpg)<br /><br />(http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2464/3715802620_c66fafc348.jpg)<br /><br />(http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2581/3714992415_9574a8f714.jpg)<br /><br />(http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2472/3714991829_814d984e10.jpg)<br /><br />(http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2668/3714991113_c6fe8bff6a.jpg)<br /><br />

				Nice! I love the silhouettes! <br /><br />I was down at the sculpture park today too. They rotate the sculptures pretty often and they are always very interesting works. I particularly liked the stoop to nowhere and the tractor was pretty cool too.<br /><br />Nice pics kempsternyc!! :mrgreen:

It&#039;s really great to know that you guys like what I&#039;m doing. :-)<br /><br />I scouted out that shot for a while. The most difficult part was figuring out what time of day it wouldn&#039;t be covered in shadows from the surrounding buildings, but also not totally washed out and lacking contrast. The secret formula seems to be early to mid July around 5pm&#039;ish. The key for me was to catch it when the sun was hitting Mercury&#039;s face causing the shadows to cast slightly backwards adding depth and definition to the sculpture.

				Love the exposure on the top one. Too many people are afraid of letting stuff block up on the black areas. They usually rely on some ugly HDR exposure. I&#039;m not against HDR, but I just tend to prefer blocked up dark areas and strong contrast ... almost comic book like.<br /><br />The rainbow is cool too, they can be hard to capture in a photo, but you nailed it. :mrgreen:

				Yet another pic ...<br /><br />This one&#039;s really nothing special. It comes from one of my practice session from a few nights back. I spent a few hours roaming up and down Broadway out here in Astoria practicing taking bulb exposures. My goal is to get better at timing and correctly exposing these night time long exposures in urban settings. It&#039;s a whole different animal when you throw traffic and pedestrians into the mix, but I learned a whole lot and even found several subjects/spots along Broadway that I plan to revisit. I also discovered that I need to save up some cash and buy a real tripod. My el-cheapo Adorama store brand Flashpoint tripod isn&#039;t going to cut it. If there was even a slight breeze or traffic vibration the image turned out slightly soft and ghosty. Why do so many lessons have to be so expensive? :wink:<br /><br />Now on to the image ... I was trying to incorporate the cooler colored store lights (especially the army-navy sign &amp; the surgical supply store lights) with amber the wash from the street light and the colors of the light trails created by the passing traffic, but I had a hard time getting the right angle to frame it like I wanted. I finally convinced myself that the only way I was going to be able to get the shot I saw in my head was if there weren&#039;t so many cars parked along the curb. Oh well, there will are always other nights. Like I said, I found several things along Broadway that caught my eye, so I&#039;ll be back ...<br /><br /><strong>Broadway Astoria Army-Navy</strong><br /><br /><em>Please Standby, Image Returning Shortly</em> :angel:<br /><br />Hmm, maybe a square crop of the left portion of the image?

I was out taking pictures when I came across Esau. He immediately caught my attention with his soulful and heartfelt playing. Plus I just couldn&#039;t resist taking the shot because of all interesting reflections and the warm soft dusk/sunset light.<br /><br />He told me that he&#039;s been playing off and on since his early teens, but he is just recently getting back into playing more consistently. All I can say is, it must be like riding a bike for him because he was really good. And that&#039;s coming from a professional sound engineer who works with musicians all the time.<br /><br />Broadway has been a particular fruitful spot for me recently. I typically roam around, but I always try to include Steinway, Broadway, Astoria Blvd (west of 31st), and Astoria Park in my meandering. I&#039;m aiming to get a picture of the &quot;telescope guy&quot; at the corner of 31st and Ditmars next, so keep checking back ...
