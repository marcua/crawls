								<div class="inner" id="msg_100761">I&#039;m really not a very political person, but I am beginning to get really uneasy about the future of this country and with our potentials for leadership.&nbsp; I can&#039;t help think of that South Park in 2004, with the voting choices being: A Turd Sandwich and A Giant Douche.&nbsp; I<br /><br />I like him because he is intelligent, honest, and blunt.&nbsp; While I don&#039;t agree with everything he touts, I like him MUCH more than the pandering front runners that are his competition.&nbsp; He understands the state of this country is in trouble and he wants to change the status quo.&nbsp; I&#039;m up for ANYONE who does this and, IMHO, I don&#039;t believe any of the other front-running candidates will.&nbsp; <br /><br />In my humble opinion, Hillary is too much of a politician, flopping back and forth on issues to fit what she thinks the majority wants to hear and Rudy is too much of a fear monger that uses the threat of terrorism to scare the masses.&nbsp; He&#039;s probably going to get many more Americans killed in senseless war (likely Iran) and/or get more of the world pissed off at us due to aggression.&nbsp; <br /><br />Paul isn&#039;t isolationist; he just believes in foreign diplomacy, not threats or stick waving, as a way to go about foreign policy.&nbsp; When he called out Rudy in a debate a few months ago for using 9/11 to scare folks and said (paraphrasing) &quot;the terrorists don&#039;t hate us for our freedoms, they hate us for our aggressive foreign policy.&quot;<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t agree more.&nbsp; Terrorists don&#039;t attack Australia or Canada because they don&#039;t try to tell the rest of the world how to live.&nbsp; We do.&nbsp; Not everyone wants or is ready for a democracy; so we can&#039;t stuff it down their throats.&nbsp; Hell, Iraq itself was a country slapped together in the 20s by the League of Nations.&nbsp; How can we expect the differing views to just live in harmony in a democracy?&nbsp; Can&#039;t we just stay the hell out of other people&#039;s business?<br /><br />I saw Ron Paul have some GREAT points today when interviewing Ben Bernake (the Fed Chairman) on the dire conditions of the economy.&nbsp; Since Paul wants to abolish the Federal Reserve (and many other government agencies) this could help fix this mess.&nbsp; Paul follows another famous politician, Thomas Jefferson, in his distrust of the Federal Government controlling our finances.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here&#039;s one of Jefferson&#039;s quotes: &quot;The central bank is an institution of the most deadly hostility existing against the Principles and form of our Constitution. I am an Enemy to all banks discounting bills or notes for anything but Coin. If the American People allow private banks to control the issuance of their currency, first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the People of all their Property until their Children will wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered.&quot;<br /><br />This is exactly what is happening.&nbsp; For those who don&#039;t follow what goes on, the Fed is making you poorer to keep the cohorts on Wall Street afloat.&nbsp; By them dropping the interest rates and printing massive amounts of cash, they&#039;re devaluing our currency.&nbsp; Basically, that means your money has less spending power.&nbsp; Google &quot;Inflation&quot; and look into what happened in Germany between WWI and WWII when their government just kept printing more money to pay off their debts.&nbsp; With our currency devaluing and energy costs, food costs, and just about everything else costing more, we&#039;re getting screwed; big business is getting saved.<br /><br />Sorry to get off on a rant.&nbsp; I&#039;m just worried about the future of our country, both foreign and domestic, and wanted to get his name out there&nbsp; and, hopefully, interest enough of you to find out a little more.&nbsp; I don&#039;t work for a campaign, I don&#039;t get any money for pushing him, I don&#039;t have any ulterior motives.&nbsp; I&#039;d just like to help, if I can, give a little more info on one of our choices for President.&nbsp; Take it or leave it and, please, feel free to add any comments; positive or negative are welcome.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_100806">Thanks for the great post.&nbsp; Not that I think it will come to it, but I would support Paul in the general elections (or the primaries if I were able).&nbsp; That being said, I feel that you may have put too fine a coat on Dr. Paul&#039;s positions.&nbsp; What I have come to find is that his supporters will pick up on one thing they like about him and leave the rest.&nbsp; The problem with that approach is that you will get the whole package if he is elected.&nbsp; Don&#039;t like the Iraq War? Ron Paul will end it, along with our attachment to the UN, and NATO and humanitarian aid to developing nations.&nbsp; Do you think that federal government should not be bailing out banks who clients are defaulting on mortgages? Neither does Ron Paul, but he also wants to do away with federal government spending on education. <br />I am glad that he is running and wish that his positions are discussed intelligently.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t think that the federal reserve can be dismantled and the nation returned to the gold standard. I may be wrong on this, but I certainly would like to know more.<br />BTW, I agree with much of your post, but the horrific bombing in Bali was targeted against Australians, and Canada certainly has had Her own issues with Islamic terrorism. </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_100820">I have to agree with Sweeper.&nbsp; Most Western nations have had their problems with terrorism at this point:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/americas/06/03/canada.terror/index.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/americas/06/03/canada.terror/index.html</a> <br />It&#039;s hard to say that our foreign policy is the only or even main reason for such plots.&nbsp; Other reasons include a desire to propagate a specific brand of religion.<br /><br />There are aspects of Ron Paul&#039;s candidacy I like, but then, I&#039;m a conservative.&nbsp; I am a little puzzled as to what his appeal is to left leaning people.&nbsp; Seems like I see a lot of progressive activist types and young people holding up Ron Paul signs.&nbsp; This is very interesting to me, a conservative, because on many issues, Paul is MUCH more conservative than I am.&nbsp; I can&#039;t see why his ideas would play out well with the protest crowds.<br /><br />In my personal opinion, I think it just goes to show how polarizing the war issue is.&nbsp; None of the main line Dem or Repub candidates are unabashedly against the war, so this guy who is perceived as a plain dealing, tell it like it is antiwar candidate with libertarian leanings is getting some positive attention from the disillusioned.&nbsp; But I wonder how they would feel if they knew some of his social positions.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_100825">Thanks for the reply, Sweeper.&nbsp; I agree, there are a few downsides to Paul, as well.&nbsp; However, that is part of the game.&nbsp; No candidate is going to be perfect for all of us in every situation, so we go with who has the most positives in our eyes, right?<br /><br />I&#039;m not attacking you, but I would like to address, to the best of my ability (which isn&#039;t that great so, please, read for yourself), your concerns. When he talks about getting out of the UN, NATO, CAFTA, NAFTA, etc. so that they can no longer have control over our lives.&nbsp; If you read about some of the agendas of these groups are not in the best interest of the United States.&nbsp; They want to impose taxes on our goods, laws on our people, and force us to utilize our thinly stretched military might on battles we don&#039;t choose to fight.<br /><br />Also, if you read his site (I&#039;ll post the link at the bottom of his &quot;issues&quot; page), he SPECIFICALLY states that he does not want the US to be isolationist.&nbsp; Since no one says it better than him, here&#039;s the exact wording: &quot;At the same time, we must not isolate ourselves. The generosity of the American people has been felt around the globe. Many have thanked God for it, in many languages. Let us have a strong America, conducting open trade, travel, communication, and diplomacy with other nations.&quot;<br /><br />While he doesn&#039;t specifically say on his site that he wants to do away with the federal government spending on education, he does say he wants to bring home schooling to an accepted level like public schooling.&nbsp; The main thing here is that, while he might want to reduce federal spending on education, he mainly wants to get the federal government out of the individual states&#039; realm of government.&nbsp; ALSO, since wants to reduce or end federal income taxation, this would provide more money in each household&#039;s paychecks that would help cover the costs of the education of their choice.&nbsp; It removes the tax burden placed on all people and allows more free choice.&nbsp; <br /><br />He&#039;s a smart, well-educated man, that I highly doubt wants to see American children not receive a quality education.&nbsp; I don&#039;t believe that he intends to leave the education system in shambles.<br /><br />As for abolishing the Federal Reserve and returning the country to the gold standard: I don&#039;t know exactly how he plans to do that, although you have prompted me to do more research and, if I find the answer, I&#039;ll post it up.&nbsp; The bottom line is this: the way the Fed is printing money is EXTREMELY detrimental to our economy and population as a whole.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you like to read about financial issues, I recommend picking up a book called &quot;Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds&quot; by Charles Mackay.&nbsp; It&#039;s an excellent book written back in 1841 that talks about previous stock/real estate/speculative bubbles in the past.&nbsp; Some of these were: The South-Sea Bubble (England around 1720), The Mississippi Scheme (France around 1719-1720), and Tulipomania (The Dutch in the early-mid 1600s).&nbsp; Anyway, this book describes &quot;mania&quot; where greed took over and reason was lost.&nbsp; Credit rates were overextended, central banks became involved in companies&#039; fate, and the governments took their base valuing off gold and coin and put it on money; which they printed more and more of.&nbsp; This caused mass-hysteria and ensuing pandemonium as these runs made the commoner vastly wealthy, only to have it all come crashing down and taking those very same people, and more, into poverty. <br /><br />Now, this might seem a bit extreme right now, but it&#039;s really not too far off from what&#039;s happening in the U.S., and the world, right now.&nbsp; Skyrocketing real estate values had brought riches and higher wealth to many people.&nbsp; Speculation and easy credit drove values up to astronomical values and allowed people to take loans out on these higher values and spend more money.&nbsp; But, it started to falter in 2005 and, now, has really only begun to get bad.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />According to Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan, there are almost 30 BILLION dollars in subprime and adjustable rate loans resetting to higher values EVERY MONTH.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure many of you have read about it in the news.&nbsp; Well, it&#039;s ONLY STARTED to get bad.&nbsp; The first large reset month was last month and it is going to continue through the end of 2008.&nbsp; The New York market isn&#039;t immune, either.&nbsp; The only reason things have not been as bad here is because, on average, it takes 488 days for a home to go into foreclosure in New York; opposed to 21 days in Texas and a few months in NV, CA, FL, etc. (the states you&#039;re already reading about).&nbsp; So, there&#039;s a lag in what is going to happen here.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, to &quot;combat&quot; this problem, the Fed is dropping interest rates.&nbsp; But, this only devalues the US Dollar versus other currencies.&nbsp; For those of you that don&#039;t follow, the Canadian dollar is actually worth ~1.06 American dollars.&nbsp; I&#039;m only 25 and I remember as recently as 6 years ago going to Canada and the getting almost TWO Canadian dollars for one US dollar.&nbsp; So, basically, my money has become worth half as much in 6 years.&nbsp; I also remember paying $1.14 for 1 Euro and $1.61 for 1 Pound Sterling in 2003.&nbsp; Those rates are now $1.46 for 1 Euro and $2.05 for one Pound Sterling.&nbsp; Again, my money is worth less.<br /><br />On top of our money being worth less, inflation is getting higher.&nbsp; Fuel costs much more; food costs much more; the things we use on a daily basis cost much more.&nbsp; Oil is almost $100 a barrel.&nbsp; Homes aren&#039;t selling, values aren&#039;t increasing, and people are getting stuck with higher payments or foreclosure.<br /><br />We might not be in such a bubble that those previous &quot;manias&quot; were, but China is.&nbsp; They have stock trading kiosks at banks, so people can cash their checks and buy stocks.&nbsp; People who know nothing about stocks are making money hand over fist and driving values up to astronomical levels.&nbsp; Their entire market is up about 300% in ONE YEAR.&nbsp; The caveat is this: Unlike in the US, the Chinese can&#039;t short (profiting when a stock goes down) stocks.&nbsp; So, they, especially the government with the Olympics coming there, have a vested interest in having it continue to go up.&nbsp; The main concern is that with all of our free trade this and that, we are reliant on them and the success of their economy.&nbsp; If they crash, we&#039;ll likely crash, and so will the rest of the world.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, I got WAY off on a tangent and I apologize.&nbsp; I&#039;m VERY worried about the future of this country.&nbsp; While Paul may be a little out there with some of his ideas and I might not agree with everything he does, but I agree with most of it.&nbsp; And, most importantly, he&#039;s a CHANGE from the status quo.&nbsp; He sticks to his principles and doesn&#039;t change his views because they aren&#039;t &quot;popular.&quot;&nbsp; He doesn&#039;t BS about the dire conditions this county faces and he wants to shake things up.&nbsp; I think that&#039;s what we need.<br /><br />Man, that&#039;s a ramble.&nbsp; Anyway, if you want to skip my diatribe and just get to the facts, here&#039;s his site discussing his issues: <a href="http://www.ronpaulforpresident2008.com/pages/issues.html#EndingtheIRS" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.ronpaulforpresident2008.com/pages/issues.html#EndingtheIRS<br /></a></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_100960">IMO, the conservative/liberal classifications are just my side/your side distinctions: E.g, how does being conservative or liberal affect the debate on abortion, same-sex marriages, gun control and affirmative action?&nbsp; &quot;Cons&quot; ask for more government control on the former two and less on the latter two while &quot;Libs&quot; ask for the opposite.&nbsp; There is no real application of principles by either side.&nbsp; Both labels have been swept into the demographic support which the two majors parties have garnered ever since the New Deal.&nbsp; That being said, I think that we see some &quot;liberals&quot; now supporting Ron Paul because the war, the erosion of civil liberties and the rapid acculmulation of power by the federal government has caused a requestioning of the my side/your side loyalties, in particularly because it doesnt seem that the democrats will end the war very quickly or restore our civil liberties rapidly or cede power back to the states.&nbsp; I am one of those folks and I like Ron Paul.&nbsp; <br /><br />As for the attacks as a way to propogate certain types of religion:&nbsp; I think one of the major dangers of calling our foes madmen is that we actually start believing it after a while.&nbsp; How dimly must we view our adversaries if we suppose them to think that <em>performing acts of terrorism would get us to change our religions</em>?&nbsp; They are not madmen, far from it.&nbsp; They are rational individuals who are respondng in one of the few ways they can to the worlds only superpower who has agressively meddled with their lands for a half a century.</div>

I do have problems with him, don&#039;t get me wrong - I much prefer Kucinich (whom I&#039;ve also supported and who I feel most closely represents my views currently), and of the &quot;mainstream&quot; candidates I like Obama the best, and have also supported his campaign.<br /><br />Honestly, I feel the country has gone down hill so fast I wouldn&#039;t mind seeing Paul win and try and dismantle the Federal Government (IRS etc). You&#039;d end up with full Federal gridlock with congress once again flexing it&#039;s muscle against the executive branch - something I feel is desperately needed right now and is frankly not happening with the republicans or democrats in control. I don&#039;t think Paul would get a lot &quot;done&quot;, but it could potentially be a really good exercise for the country to go through imho.<br /><br />Generally it&#039;s a breath of fresh air to hear the likes of Paul and Kucinich talking about abuse and corruption within the Federal government openly. Even though I may not agree with them on all the little things, I trust these guys to a greater degree than a lot of the other options that exist at the moment.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_100968">There are many reasons i would never ever support Ron Paul ( <a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/d/news/google-ron-paul2.php" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.somethingawful.com/d/news/google-ron-paul2.php</a> this provides a good look at a Ron Paul Presidency). I am on the left, though I do love watching Ron Paul speak during the Republican debates (which I watch because I love debates regardless of who is participating). Ron Paul had the best response to when Mitt Romney said he would consult his attorneys before attacking Iran. <br /><br />As with the guy above me, I love Kucinich the best. I agree with him on every issue, and we need more politicians like him, thought for the 2008 election I will most likely end up supporting one of the mainstream candidates (I have a feeling I&#039;ll end up pulling the lever for Hillary, but who knows). <br /><br />Ron Paul&#039;s candidacy might have a good long term effect for both sides though, because if he can successfully win or at least do extremely well in the Iowa Caucus or any of the early primary races, he can demonstrate that the internet can indeed be a useful tool for obtaining votes, as this idea has faded a lot since Howard Dean&#039;s campaign in 2004. Ron Paul&#039;s use of the internet and other new campaigning techniques can serve as a model for both sides in future local and presidential races.<br /><br />I can&#039;t see Ron Paul winning the republican nomination or the presidency, and I don&#039;t think a lot of his supporters see the problems with a lot of his views, as he would get rid of a lot of government services people currently rely on (ie: public education). Right now the media is focused on his anti-war stance due to his position as a minor candidate in the Republican field, but if he was somehow able to pull an upset and become an actual contender for the Republican nomination, the media would then start to focus on some of those more extreme views he has. It is these reasons Ron Paul will most likely never become President.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_101002">I am happy to hear that there are some Kucinich supporters even among the Ron Paul supporters.&nbsp; It&#039;s strange, considering the two seem to be on opposite ends in terms of social issues.&nbsp; I am a big Kucinich supporter and was very happy to see him win Democracy for America&#039;s (DFA) recent Presidential Pulse Poll.&nbsp; I was saddened to see that DFA did not publicize this fact at all, and you can be sure they would have if Hillary, Al, or Barack had won instead.&nbsp; This is a man who never backs down, who never shies away from his principles, has never wavered in his stance.&nbsp; He knew all along this war was a sham, and said so the whole time, so it&#039;s hard for me to believe every other politician who just claims they were tricked by Bush into approving this ill-conceived war.&nbsp; On the war and the Patriot Act, Ron Paul doesn&#039;t differ much from Kucinich, and I suspect this is why many liberals find themselves in support of him.&nbsp; I do like his stance and love the fact he&#039;s so blunt and to the point about it.&nbsp; However, that is not enough for me to support Ron Paul as an entire package.&nbsp; As a woman, I cannot get past his stance on abortion.&nbsp; Although many cite the fact that he is for state&#039;s rights regarding this issue, he is abundantly clear in that he does not support a woman&#039;s right to choose under any circumstances, even to save her life.&nbsp; He means to abolish Roe vs Wade and does not hide this fact.&nbsp; I do not like his stance on education, immigration, gun control, and other issues.&nbsp; I do not know how he feels about universal health care or the rights of rights of LGBTQ Americans and cannot find reference to it on his site.&nbsp; When you elect someone, you get the whole package, not just the parts you like.&nbsp; Many of the Democrats are also now saying they want to end the war, but I look past that to see the differences amongst their stances on other issues as well.&nbsp; Dennis Kucinich is the closest I get to having someone that represents how I feel on most every issue.&nbsp; Unfortunately, neither Dennis nor Ron will ever get the attention from the media that the questions they present really deserve, and I too fear for this country.&nbsp; But I also feared for it 8 long long years ago and my fears have already been confirmed.&nbsp; A comedian summed it up best last night, - hasn&#039;t it felt like forever that Bush has been in office?&nbsp; It&#039;s exhausting.</div>
