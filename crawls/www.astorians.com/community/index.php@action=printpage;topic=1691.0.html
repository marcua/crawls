				My recollection is that Sri&#39;s very crowded and I don&#39;t think they take reservations. It might be best to go on a weeknight instead of a Friday... Or else be prepared to be split up into smaller groups... This said, I&#39;d love to go! Chowhound &nbsp;(http://chowhound.com/boards/outer/outer.html)will have good recommendations on dishes to try...

They now serve wine and beer, however I think you can still bring your own, however the cork fee is very steep. The food is great, the Mango Salad is to die for, the meatball app is tasty, just too many great dishes to mention. They have a great outdoor garden now in warmer weather. I would suggest going during the week as someone else mentioned and the time we went during the week, I think on a Tuesday, we waited for 10 minutes, however the place was packed!!! Def. get the sticky rice as well, it just adds to the already tasty culinary delights.

				So does anyone have an opinion on doing dinners another night? It may help for accommodating a large hungry group like ours. Just wondering cause i&#39;m pretty open to week nights.<br /><br />and ..... would Wave Thai be an alternative to going out to Sripraphai? <br /><br />i&#39;m still pouting over not getting to Philoxenia too by the way. <br />we could also do a cheesey dinner at Rizzo&#39;s?<br />&nbsp;i&#39;ve never been to fatty&#39;s either. <br />there&#39;s still mundo too.<br /><br />date?<br /><br /><em>can you tell i&#39;m having brain diarreha?</em>

				Evenings other than Fridays sound really good to me.&nbsp; But I&#39;m content to see what the majority wants, though.<br /><br />As I see it, Sripraphai and Wave are rather different kinds of Thai experiences, so it&#39;s hard to say that one experience could stand in for another.&nbsp; I love Wave Thai, though, so I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t go there.&nbsp; I find myself craving curry with their vegetarian duck.&nbsp; My understanding about Srip is that it&#39;s quite authentic compared to most Thai places around.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would love to find good Vietnamese food, too.&nbsp; And Ethiopian, while I&#39;m wishing.<br /><br />On Preview:&nbsp; Mundo is someplace I DEFINITELY want to go to soon.

				The thing about Fridays is...<br />1) the night is established, thus avoiding the protracted &quot;OK, when can everyone go?&quot; discussion;<br />2) it&#39;s the weekend, so we don&#39;t have to keep thinking &quot;ugh, I have to get up early tomorrow for work,&quot; but Saturday is more of a &quot;date night&quot; so those lucky ones who have sig. others can still do a group thing on Fridays<br /><br />What about doing Sripraphai as a special off-the-schedule dinner on another night, since 1) it&#39;s outside Astoria and 2) there&#39;s a potential issue with too big a group.&nbsp; Then we could do an Astoria dinner on a Friday night.&nbsp; Opinions?

				So im just putting this out here,&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />How about a place that can accomodate a big crowd, has beer and good solid heavy food for the winter time and probably wont be that busy....<br /><br />The beer garden indoors.&nbsp; Oh and I just went to LIC bar with a friend for some beer and im hungry. so there ya go.<br /><br />

				Yeah, if LIC Bar had just a little more food besides those panini (the ham and gruyere is very tasty, though), it would be perfect.<br /><br />I think the beer garden indoors would be great!&nbsp; They&#39;ve got that big downstairs room.&nbsp; Not much ambiance (rhymes with ambulance), but since we&#39;ve already dealt with woven rugs of machine guns, that shouldn&#39;t be a problem.

				I dig the beer garden plan.&nbsp; Also worth mentioned if the weather is not god awful cold, there is a small outdoor tented space with like 8 of their huge picnic tables that has a big &#39;ol tower heater.<br /><br />So while indoors is a possibility -- so it out -- on a nice night.<br /><br />Also beer garden is once again, stupid close to my apartment which means I can stumble there post-nap and stagger home post-beer.<br /><br />You know, cuz it&#39;s all about accomodating my stumbling and staggering.<br /><br />

				Aye for Beer Garden! The same block and a half to my apartment as was the Afghan place, and it has beer, and it has pork! We&#39;re really going to alienate the vegetarians, though... Maybe in April we can hit the meat trifeca and go to the Czech place... :)&nbsp; :evil:

				i agree with jennifer,&nbsp; smaller bunches sounds good to me. and its not like it will be the last time you&#39;ll get a chance to sit with someone you know? we just have to always alternate at each dinner.

				The meal was great - and the food was great too!!<br /><br />I had the chicken/spinach/mushroom and cheese crepe - I always get it there and it never disappoints (me and the 5 other people it can feed). Jonathan had the beef with dumplings - I think that dish is a little dissappointing compared to the other choices - but it was still good.&nbsp; The keilbasa that I tasted was excellent.&nbsp; French fries were okay.&nbsp; Perogis are NOT my favorite food.&nbsp; I think they&#39;re too bland and last nights were no exception.&nbsp; <br /><br />One of the shocks of the evening - a staff person came over to see how everything was!! At the Bohemian Hall!! Let me repeat - a staff person showed interest in how the customers were doing!!&nbsp; Now I don&#39;t know if this kind of service is going to carry over when the fun/food moves outside - but I don&#39;t think any of us had EVER experienced THAT.&nbsp; I did ask the woman if she was the new manager (I remembered seeing the job posting) and indeed that is who she was.&nbsp; But besides said manager - I think our waitress was quite good as well.&nbsp; At least I didn&#39;t hear any complaints.&nbsp; <br /><br />The long table (an issue in my world) was NOT an issue - b/c although I was very far from Marta all the way at the other end, the room we were in was empty for most of the night and so loud talking was socially acceptable.&nbsp; And encouraged - at least by me.&nbsp; <br /><br />It was great to see everyone as always.&nbsp; And it&#39;s always a pleasure to meet new folk.&nbsp; Welcome to &quot;Astorians Eat&quot; Rachel, Amanda and Daisy I hope you all enjoyed yourselves.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I had a great time last night meeting all of you!&nbsp; You&#39;re a fun crowd, and made a newbie feel very welcome.&nbsp; Yeah, I was a bit surprised too by the attentiveness of the waitress - I&#39;m so used to being ignored but that&#39;s usually outside with one waitress per 200 tables or so.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#39;m so excited I now have people to try new restaurants with!&nbsp; I&#39;ll have to go thru my list and figure out where to start.&nbsp; I came in late to this forum so apparently I missed the Churrascaria - but I have a few takers who don&#39;t mind going again with me.&nbsp; &nbsp;And I don&#39;t know who might be interested come warmer weather, but I kinda like going to Cavo for dinner and drinks once in a while.&nbsp; If you can see past the trendiness factor, it&#39;s really quite beautiful there, the staff are very friendly, and they have great food and drinks.&nbsp; It&#39;s a bit expensive and there can be a line on the weekend - (so go early to avoid the line), but it&#39;s fun.&nbsp; Good for people watching too.&nbsp; Anyone who&#39;s interested is welcome to join me this summer.<br /><br />Talk soon,<br />Daisy

				I want to second Daisy and Rachel&#39;s newbie comments - I felt incredibly welcome and had a great time! <br /><br />Daisy - anytime you want to hit places we may have missed, I am definitely in. Before long, we&#39;ll be completely caught up on the EATS passports!<br /><br />And Flooz, thanks a bazillion for the moonpies! I was exhausted when I got home Friday and forgot they were in my bag, so when I discovered them the next day I was so excited. It&#39;s one thing to find unexpected money in your bag. Finding unexpected moonpies, however, is true bliss...&nbsp; :-D
