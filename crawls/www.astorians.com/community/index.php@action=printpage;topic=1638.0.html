A friend and I went up there Saturday night because it&#39;s close and I remembered folks said there was a pool table there, and it was a little frightening (in a frat boy kind of way ... apologies in advance to any of the decent frat boys out there). Hoping it was just because it was the weekend?

				I&#39;m with Jtrane - excellent avatar, Jim!&nbsp; I&#39;m glad to see you on here.<br /><br />I wish I could have had wings with you all tonight, but I was in Brooklyn (Cobble Hill - nice neighborhood!) rehearsing.&nbsp; We all went out after and I had tasty nachos for dinner at a local place.&nbsp; Wonderful evening spent with new friends (and even a fellow Astoria resident!&nbsp; We are <em>everywhere</em>...)<br /><br />I hope to have wings at McCanns soon.&nbsp; Thanks for the report, Jonathan and lanseaux!
