				Just heard on ABC and NBC News that there was a shooting homicide at the &#039;N&#039; Train station at 31st and Broadway at 1:15 AM this morning - right in front of the token booth.&nbsp; The station is closed at this time.&nbsp; A police investigation is ongoing and they are looking for suspects.

				I was about half a block away from the train when it happened. We were walking a friend of ours to the train. There were lots of people, but after everyone heard the shots, so many people came running down from the platform that I wasn&#039;t able to tell what was going on, other than people were pouring out of the stairs.<br /><br />A Manhattan-bound train pulled in to the station in the time that it took for the cops to get there, which was a few minutes. Those who left the train walked past the crime scene (read: victim), and were quickly questioned by everyone on the street.&nbsp; They said it was a guy lying on the platform, dead.&nbsp; <br /><br />It was random and scary. I will say that everyone on the street was super calm, I didn&#039;t see anyone panicking, and people just kept their cool.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Wow.&nbsp; This kind of stuff rarely happens here.&nbsp; I heard on NY1 this morning that there were 4 or 5 people seen running from the scene of the shooting and they are looking for them.&nbsp; I hope they find them and/or figure out why this shooting occurred.&nbsp; I would really hate for it to be a random shooting, although it&#039;s terrible no matter what the police find.&nbsp; Does anyone know if there are cameras at the station?

				I was on the incoming (Ditmars bound) train that passed by this station when the police arrived.&nbsp; Cops, dogs, police tape all appeared in the time our train pulled into the station and left.&nbsp; Unfortunately, however, the Manhattan bound train had just picked up passengers at Broadway so the police were a bit too later for suspects/bystanders waiting on the train....

				First question coming to my mind is whether there were video cams in that station or not.&nbsp; If not, by now, why not?&nbsp; Every other inch of this town is coated with cams, but not Broadway N/W?&nbsp; I guess new bus shelters were more important than cams.

				I think there&#039;s a lot we don&#039;t know at this time.&nbsp; From the CBS news report (the video on the site that Mark linked to), it sounds as if the victim was shot after he left a &quot;southbound&quot; train -- which I&#039;m taking to mean a Manhattan-bound train.

				I hope it&#039;s not gang-related, somebody was talking about seeing gang tatoos on the train recently. One can only hope it wasn&#039;t random, but if it was just some guy getting off a train......maybe the perps knew the guy was getting off there? That&#039;s a tough thing to predict.&nbsp; :|

				Conversely, I would feel better if this was gang-related as opposed to being a random shooting.&nbsp; I, myself, am a random person with no gang affiliation, so it scares me more when people like me without sworn enemies are getting bumped off for no apparent reason.&nbsp;

				Sucks. Well statistically most violent crimes are between people who knew each other before the incident right? Let&#039;s hope that&#039;s the case till proven otherwise. Or it could have been mistaken identity, or some ridiculous perceived slight... a waste whatever the &quot;reason&quot; was.

				Could be gang related. The victim didn&#039;t have to be in a rival gang. The shooting could be some sort of a mistake on the part of gang members or an initiation into a gang. People just don&#039;t shoot other people in the head randomly like this. This poor soul was targeted. With the increasing hispanic community in Astoria I wonder about the level of gang activity. (MS-13 and Latin Kings) Hopefully this will be solved by the men in blue.

				Even if this young man was targeted by the gang, which is what it is looking like, it&#039;s pretty f*ing scary based on the fact that you have young men with handguns, who aren&#039;t &quot;afraid&quot; to kill based on gang affiliations.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this often leads to wild shootouts with the innocent and unsuspecting being caught in the middle.&nbsp; In fact, over the weekend, a four year old girl was shot in Staten Island because someone decided to settle a beef with a gun and almost killed an innocent child.&nbsp; <br /><br />Let&#039;s hope the police catch the shooters and the accompliaces and break this gang up before it gets out of hand. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				I saw the piece this a.m. in the Times and must say I was surprised, but I&#039;ve noticed a weird dichotomy in Astoria in recent years with all the development and more upscale people moving here at the same time you have all the graffiti and more of a sense of menace.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then again maybe I&#039;m just getting old.<br /><br />I got off the N train at 9:30 p.m. on Saturday and there was a group of five or six young men standing on the northeast corner of 31st St. &amp; 30th Avenue (in front of the fish store) and they were brazenly propositioning every woman who walked off the subway.&nbsp; &nbsp;I didn&#039;t think there was any real danger, but I was sort of suprised about how brazen they were.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then walking home, up a rather desolate stretch of 31st between 30th &amp; 28th Avenues, I passed another group of young men walking south on 31st.&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing was said and I didn&#039;t feel menaced, but my sense said trouble was brewing.<br /><br />Call me crazy, but I just sense a more dangerous atmosphere in Astoria at night.

				Good point, Chris, but I thought that it was a lot worse in the 90&#039;s.&nbsp; Perhaps, it&#039;s escalating again, which would be unfortunate.&nbsp; Just a quick story about gangs in this area.<br /><br />In the mid-90&#039;s, two or three rival gangs were fighting in the western Queens area, over the usual things that gangs fight over.&nbsp; In fact, a friend of mine from Mexico had explained that they had come up from villages in Mexico and were now continuing their rivalry in Queens.&nbsp; The Mexican owned and operated bars in the area were fairly dangerous places to be around and one of them on 36th Avenue was even used a hang out spot for one of the gangs.&nbsp; It culminated in the summer of 1997 with the double homicide of two gang members on the corner of 36th Avenue and 32nd Street, which I unfortunately witnessed.&nbsp; I knew both of the victims as they used to go to my friend&#039;s bodega on 36th Avenue.&nbsp; The average resident didn&#039;t even realize what was going on before the violence erupted on the street that night.&nbsp; You would be surprised how prevalent and pervasive the gangs were back then.&nbsp; Anyway, after the shootings and several other murders in the area, which by the way, barely got any English language media attention, the police stepped up their presence and most of the leaders, feeling the heat, fled back to Mexico.<br /><br />Again, I hope they catch these killers and hopefully this young man&#039;s family will get some sort of closure.<br /><br />

				Anytime a young person is targeted like that, the media automatically assume it&#039;s gang related. This may very well be a gang-related attack, but it could also be that these guys had a beef with this kid for some other, non-gang related reason. Look at the violence that happened at The Quay -- because it didn&#039;t involve Latino or black youth, the assumption wasn&#039;t that it was gang violence, though it was an attack on one person perpetrated by a group. <br /><br />This type of random -- yes, random -- violence occurs anywhere and everywhere. This kid worked in Astoria -- if he had worked on Park Avenue, it would have happened there. He was shot and stabbed -- which suggests that the attackers knew their victim. Most stabbings aren&#039;t random. It wasn&#039;t a robbery, it happened too quickly. This group wanted THIS guy dead and knew his travel plans.<br /><br />If you look at the police blotter in the Gazette (thanks to whoever posted that in another thread), Astorians have more to worry about when it comes to drunk drivers in our neighborhood than we do about random shootings.

				I missed what happened at the Quays. Its a rare occasion to find me sitting in a bar. People are wagging their tounges all over recently. I was at NYSC and of course two friends are talking and then someone else joins in the conversation. I think one of these guys said someting like, &quot;Ya, I was hanging out right when it happend. And you know what no one is saying anything to the police, no one is talking.&quot; The &quot;snitchs get stiches&quot; refrain. <br /><br />The Daily News article mention something about Mexican gangs. <br /><br />I, like everyone else, hope the fuzz get a handle on this.

				Even though this wasn’t related to a robbery, I do feel that the more development, people and money that comes to Astoria will escalate crime here as well.&nbsp; Along with improvement of infrastructure, perhaps pumping up the police force is something to look into.<br /><br />I know this could be coincidence, but today I walked from Steinway Street to Ditmars Boulevard, then to Astoria Park, then down to Broadway and back up to Steinway Street without seeing one uniformed officer or patrol car.

				It&#039;s really hard to believe this shooting took place in the station - I&#039;d always felt very safe there, and it&#039;s my stop.<br />I hope they have some cameras and catch the folks who did the shooting and find out why it happened.<br />I don&#039;t think more people moving to Astoria will result in more crime, though maybe in raw numerical terms it might - otherwise wouldn&#039;t Manhattan which is much denser also have a much higher rate of crime?&nbsp; I&#039;ve almost always felt safe in Astoria.&nbsp; I hope the 114th gets more focused.

He was stabbed and shot. These people wanted this kid dead. Sounds like it happened pretty quickly, quick enough for the perps to get away and with few eyewitnesses. If it were a mugging, odds are it wouldn&#039;t have been in such a well-lit, populated area, and rarely do robberies/muggings result in death, especially in that manner -- shot once? Maybe? Hit in the head? Perhaps. One stab would? Possibly. But multiple stab wounds and a gunshot wound to the head? Not likely.<br /><br />And the kid was going home his job in Astoria to his apartment in the Bronx. According to news reports, it seemed like he worked the same schedule every night. Sounds to me like whoever did it, knew this.

				I couldn&#039;t help but notice that the only &quot;wanted&quot; signs or what not describing what happened, who the perpetrators could have been, etc. were put up by the &quot;guardian angels&quot; organization, not the police. Are the cops even honestly looking for the suspects? Have heard of a lot of shootings since moving to the city- at least 2 a day- but can&#039;t help but notice that I only hear of someone getting caught maybe once or twice a week. Or maybe the news just doesn&#039;t report that. Not trying t hate on the cops, but its just an observation.

				The victim had a name – Jose Sierra and do you really think it makes a difference to his family whether or not if his murder was a random event or if he knew his killers? or if the murder was gang-related? Or if he was targeted, where he lived or where his killer lived? <br /><br />Why does to such drawing distinctions make people feel better?

This murder may have been unusual but face facts folks it isn’t unprecedented.<br /><br />And those of you who use this tragedy to bolster your argument about ‘overdevelopment’ in the neighbourhood should be ashamed – and if you’re not you should at least use the man’s name if you&#039;re going to use his death to make off-hand comments on whether or not the NYPD and politicians are stoking crime stats to make themsleves look rosy.<br /><br />

				Whenever something bad happens here or in the suburbs or the city or wherever, &nbsp;the first thing out of people&#039;s mouths, is how it&#039;s always been a safe area and they never expected such a thing to happen. &nbsp;Violence can happen to anyone, anywhere. &nbsp;But no one ever wants or expects it to happen to them, and I know it&#039;s not right, but it&#039;s only natural to want to make each other and ourselves feel better and safer. &nbsp;I do bristle when I hear that people seem to think Latinos are more likely to commit violence or have it committed on them. &nbsp;I&#039;ve been here 10 years, there were Latinos here before me, and after me, and I am Latina. &nbsp;I lived in a Latino neighborhood in Astoria for 4 years before moving to the Greek neighborhood. &nbsp;I have never felt unsafe here, and I don&#039;t think the area&#039;s overrun with gangs just because Latinos are in the neighborhood. &nbsp;We are not all gang members, just as not all Italians and Greeks are all in the mafia, or Muslims are all terrorists. &nbsp;And it really annoys and frustrates me to see groups lumped into such stereotypes.<br /><br />Rest in peace, Jose. &nbsp;I&#039;m sorry something like this happened to you. &nbsp;I hope they catch the bastards.

				It&#039;s interesting that the NY Post is reporting that the suspects were affiliated with Los Traviesos; an earlier report also linked on this thread (before they had suspects) said that cops thought some of Jose&#039;s friends might also have been involved with that particular gang.

				What a tragedy, poor Jose Sierra was stabbed and shot by several thugs. Sounds like he didn&#039;t have much of a chance being outnumbered with gang members with weapons. Nobody deserves to die like that, most of all not a 19 year old. I wonder what transpired on the train, I&#039;m sure there had do be some witnesses. Perhaps they were harassing passengers or Jose himself, and he tried to stand up to them. This is why I usually hesitate to put someone in their place on a train or bus when they&#039;re acting up, because I don&#039;t know whether they have a weapon on them, or if they&#039;re emotionally unstable. You can discuss or even argue with a reasonable person about something, but how do you deal with unreasonable people?
