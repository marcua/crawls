				I have a really good fennel gratin recipe that is currently locked away in my nonfunctioning computer at home.<br /><br />Basically, sliver the fennel, slowly saute in your oil/fat/grease of choice until thoroughly caramelised, but not crispy, put into an oven-safe pan, sprinkle with parmesan, and run under the broiler until the cheese melts/browns/whatever.<br /><br />I can&#39;t think today, thanks to the Con Ed jackhammers going all night long on our block.

				Your gratin recipe sounds great, Laura!&nbsp; I&#39;m sold.<br /><br />I usually braise it, in just water and olive oil (with salt), adding lemon juice and chopped fennel fronds to the end.&nbsp; Yum.&nbsp; I first had braised fennel prepared by friends who lived in France for years.&nbsp; They said it was one of the best ways to eat it.&nbsp; I consider them experts on such things.&nbsp; Flooz, I think you might like it!&nbsp;

				I know nothing about fennel but I&#39;m seeeeriously looking forward to fresh food.&nbsp; I&#39;m finishing up fava beans from a few weeks ago and I just want to see something not moldy, wilty, rotten.&nbsp; <br /><br />When I talked to Bill this morning he was surprised to hear that lots of folks were still without power -- and even more shocked to hear grocery stores had been closed for the week.&nbsp; UGH.&nbsp; He did want to pass on the word that most of these things can be eaten raw.&nbsp; I munched through last week&#39;s string beans raw -- just washed.&nbsp; Quite good!<br /><br />cheers,<br />jayme<br />

				I actually love fennel raw.&nbsp; I slice it very thinly and toss it in a salad.&nbsp; Even better, is if you let it marinate in the dressing for a little while first.&nbsp; Like what Meg said, I also chop up the gorgeous, wispy fronds and toss those in the salad as well.&nbsp; Lovely and licoricey.&nbsp; I&#39;m not part of the CSA, but I do love fennel so I thought I&#39;d chime in.&nbsp;

				Braising turns off the licorice taste, too.&nbsp; If the fennel carmelizes it is SUPER YUM.

				For tonight, thanks to epicurious.com:<br /><br />PASTA WITH KIELBASA AND SWISS CHARD<br /><br />3/4 lb Swiss chard (preferably red; from 1 bunch)<br />1/2 lb kielbasa, quartered lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick pieces<br />2 tablespoons olive oil<br />1/2 teaspoon salt<br />2 garlic cloves, finely chopped<br />1/2 cup water<br />1/4 teaspoon dried hot red-pepper flakes<br />3/4 lb penne<br />1 oz finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano (1/2 cup) plus additional for serving<br /><br />Cut out center ribs and stems from chard, then thoroughly wash, along with leaves, in several changes of cold water. Cut ribs and stems crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick pieces and coarsely chop leaves.<br /><br />Cook kielbasa in oil in a 5-quart heavy pot over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Cook chard ribs and stems with salt in fat remaining in pot over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add chard leaves, water, and red-pepper flakes and simmer, partially covered, until chard stems are tender, about 5 minutes. Remove lid and stir in kielbasa.<br /><br />Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente, then reserve 1/2 cup pasta-cooking water and drain pasta in a colander. Add pasta to chard mixture with cheese and salt to taste and toss until combined well. Thin with some of reserved pasta water if necessary.<br />

				strangely its the diet lady Kathleen Daelemans from the show Cooking Thin. Alot of her stuff looks really appetizing actually and not diet-y at all. The simplified meal i made was really really tasty (i of course always add more seasonings) and to my surprise my finicky eater loved it too.
