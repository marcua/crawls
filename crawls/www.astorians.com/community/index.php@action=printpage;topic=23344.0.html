				What&#039;s the deal with this place on Astoria Blvd? I was there a few times, had a hero, and it was okay. The pastries and baked goods on the other hand are terrible. Place looks nice on the outside, but the inside is a total mess. Given their location, by 21st street, I think they could be succesfull if they would just put some effort in making their place nice and hospitable.

				Angelo&#039;s and the nearby Lorusso&#039;s on 18th Street are long time family businesses that catered to the long-standing Italian community that has lived in that area surrounding 21st Street for a generations.&nbsp; While the neighborhood has changed in many ways, they don&#039;t seem interested in modifying their business model.&nbsp; The Lorusso family are the nicest people but they just won&#039;t consider adding whole grain pastas or pizza crusts.&nbsp; And, like Angelo&#039;s, the atmosphere and style of the place isn&#039;t that inviting (compared to say the new Antika on 30th).&nbsp; Lorusso&#039;s has a liquor license and that area could desperately use a place with a nice bar with a few stools.&nbsp; He could serve wine and bites of his amazing focaccias.&nbsp; &nbsp;Angelo&#039;s remodeled not so long ago but not in a very tasteful way.&nbsp; And there was hope there would be more deli and to-go Italian foods but low and behold, they missed the boat and stuck with thousands of cookies instead.&nbsp; Who buys all those cookies?&nbsp; These are good people but I think it&#039;s really too hard for them to change their ways.

				Angelo &amp; Sons does make one of the better (if not the best) cappucino&#039;s in the area though and it is not $5 like most other places.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />They make a good breakfast special too.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have never tried their pastries though.&nbsp;

				Brown paper over all the windows.&nbsp; Signs say &quot;Closed for Renovations&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is also a work permit.&nbsp; So maybe they are renovating or a new owner is.

				that&#039;s too bad, it was one of the few places in the area you could sit and have some coffee. never had the food, however.<br /><br />lorusso&#039;s, on the other hand, is awesome. but i grew up with places like that, so the lack of &quot;fanciness&quot; doesn&#039;t bother me.<br />

				It was menat to happen, but sorry to see them go, I thought this place had lots of potential, but they had to modernize. Hopefully something new and interesting will appear in this place.

I don&#039;t think it was a more fancy or luxurious business model that was needed.&nbsp; But one that better served the local community as it is today.&nbsp; Meaning prepared foods or fast cooking foods that people could pick up on their way home from the subway after a long day at work. More whole grain breads and fresh whole grain pastas and less cookies and danishes.&nbsp; They had a long run there and I don&#039;t think they wanted to change up the way they made their living.&nbsp; Hopefully they ended well and have a nice nest egg.&nbsp; It&#039;s a large space and&nbsp; I hope something nice goes in.&nbsp; This may not go over big here but a casual sports pub would be nice for that end of town.&nbsp; There is nothing but Club 21 in that area.&nbsp; While that&#039;s a great place, I think something more like Astoria Brewhouse would do well on Astoria Blvd.&nbsp; Just looking at the success of Basil Brick Oven shows the untapped potential along that Blvd.&nbsp; So many vacant storefronts and tons of potential customers walking by every day.
