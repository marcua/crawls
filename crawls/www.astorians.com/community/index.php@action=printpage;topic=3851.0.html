				So, is there any remarkable lunch-time food in the Midtown west area?&nbsp; I&#39;m in the high 50s near 9th Ave. for the next few weeks.&nbsp; Where I&#39;m working feeds me M-Th (great, healthy, tasty food), but I think I&#39;m on my own for Friday.&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; Also, is D&#39;Agostino&#39;s sushi any good?

				Yes, the midtown lunch blog is great.&nbsp; I&#39;m a bit far west and north for what they&#39;re talking about, though.

				I am a huge fan of Vynl. I haven&#39;t lived in that hood in over 2 years and I still crave their tofu curry dishes. They have a great menu. It used to be on 54th and 9th, but I think it moved to 51 or 52nd.

				Thanks, Masterj.&nbsp; What kind of food does Vynl serve?&nbsp; Chinese?&nbsp; Indian?<br /><br />I&#39;m really excited about trying the Burrito Box, too.

				The Mexican restaurant/bar--El Centro--that now occupies the former Vinyl location is surprisingly good as well.<br /><br />I&#39;ll definitely second the Thai Basil rec. Greek Kitchen is fine, but doesn&#39;t stack up to Greek places in Astoria.

				Local favorites that aren&#39;t very expensive: <br />Mee Noodle (53rd and 9th) for cheap, tasty, and amazingly fast Chinese food <br />Burrito Box (9th between 57th and 58th) for inexpensive, tasty, and amazingly fast burritos and tacos and such<br />Vynl (9th and I think 51st)for New American/Thai food that costs a little more than the other places. I really like their cobb salad wrap.<br />Casabianca (10th and 57th) for general Italian stuff like pastas, they have particularly good side salads too<br />Chanpen (9th and 51st) for Thai that&#39;s a little more expensive than the other local Thai, but they have much better pad thai than the other places<br />Kiran (53rd between 9th and 10th) for Indian<br /><br />Let me know if you need more options. ;)

				I know it&#39;s a bit late, but you may want to try Azuri Cafe 51st &amp; 10th.&nbsp; Freakin&#39; amazing Israeli.

				Steenbeek, essen, and Cary, your suggestions are great!&nbsp; Thanks so much!<br /><br />(My office actually feeds us 5 days a week, so it&#39;s hard to resist the free food.&nbsp; But I plan to skip a meal or two in the next couple weeks so I&#39;ll get a chance to try some of these places!)

				I also like The Eatery (Ninth and 53rd) - but not that cheap, but I like their mac and cheese.<br /><br />I hear that there&#39;s a good Puerto-Rican restaurant that I&#39;ve been meaning to try - Old San Juan -on Ninth b/w 51st and 52nd. Lunch special not that cheap, though. <br /><br />I second the Vynl suggestion!

				Thew new Vynl is great!&nbsp; Very stylish inside.&nbsp; The bathrooms are amazing, you have to try each bathroom while you&#39;re there.&nbsp; Well, one each time you visit at least so you don&#39;t look like you have bladder problems.&nbsp; But it is worth it.&nbsp; The food is amazing, Shephard&#39;s Pie, Meatloaf, Chicken Pot Pie!&nbsp; MMMMmm... walked by there, again, last night.&nbsp; Can&#39;t miss it with the huge circle glass window in the front.&nbsp; It is just south of 51st street on the east side of 9th Ave.&nbsp; Seems to attract a big gay population as well.<br /><br />El Centro is also a great place!&nbsp; The staff is very friendly and quick, too.&nbsp; Good mojitos.<br /><br />You are right about the Greek Kitchen not comparing to Astoria, but hey for Manhattan?! ;)<br /><br />My staff went to a neat place last night after our dance.&nbsp; Renaissance Diner at 51st and 9th ave.&nbsp; The food was good, I enjoyed the environment as well.<br />

				El Centro is owned by the same people who own Vynl. They also own a place called Hell&#39;s Kitchen, and Xing. I was kind of disappointed by El Centro, but I only tried it once.

				There&#39;s a ton of stuff in the lower 50s/upper 40s on 9th.&nbsp; There&#39;s this Mexican place called El Azteco or something like that which is phenominal.&nbsp; Pluck-U is also good for wings, if you&#39;re into that.
