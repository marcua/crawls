				To be honest, I don&#039;t know how I missed this. I usually do a football league every year for a couple other message boards I post on.&nbsp; I&#039;ll set up a yahoo league and if folks want in, everyone&#039;s welcome, I&#039;ll post all the info, and set a live draft.&nbsp; <br /><br />EDIT: For some asinine reason, Yahoo only has set draft times per date this year, so I&#039;m, unfortunately, going to have to make it an autodraft, that will run on Sept 4th, which will give everyone the option of pre-ranking pretty much up until the opening kickoff.<br /><br />EDIT II (ELECTRIC BOOGALOO): here&#039;s the info everyone will need to register:<br /><br />league #:558967<br />Password: fooseball<br /><br />League URL: http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/league/thisfallskings<br /><br />It&#039;s a head to head league, which means you have an opponent each week, the winner gets both a win and points.&nbsp; There are three weeks of playoffs (weeks 14, 15, 16) and the league winner gets bragging rights.&nbsp; Smack talk is not only welcome but encouraged.&nbsp;

				I will consider it.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how competitive I will be, however, as I am in two fiercely contested leagues as it is and there&#039;s prize money involved.&nbsp; My attention span is limited and with bye weeks, injuries and performance issues to be considered, along with work and actually having some semblance of a personal life, it is hard to say how good I would be.&nbsp; In my experience, there&#039;s nothing worse than a somewhat committed fantasy team manager!

				Yeah, the fact tha tNE is putting up a minimum of 40 points a game has me all :) about getting Moss.&nbsp; That said, either one of my QB&#039;s is available for a top notch RB.&nbsp;

				Yeah, I actually wrote a scathing e-mail to members one of my leagues for not being competitive.&nbsp; Even though it benefitted me this week, it could hurt me if they continue to not change rosters accordingly.&nbsp;

				So I set up 2 leagues, a pick em league and a head to head, If I can get enough people, I&#039;m going to make them $10 each leagues. If anyone is interested:<br /><br />Head to Head (Yahoo Sports):<br />ID# is 351317 and the Password is pigskin<br /><br />Pick Em (Yahoo Sports):<br />Group ID# 13391 and the Password pigskin<br /><br />I&#039;m opening these to other friends, as well, so if you guys know of any other interested parties, feel free to invite. Also, the head to head league is a live draft this year.<br /><br />

				Not sure if anyone is interested in another league (how many FF leagues does one message board need) but if so- ESPN is far, far superior to yahoo IMO. I&#039;ve never done FF before but did fantasy baseball this year for the first time and have teams on both yahoo and espn, and espn blows yahoo out of the water. Plus, they are letting you do live auction drafts for football, which is a really neat way to do a draft. <br /><br />Like others I probably dont need another FF team at this point, but if people were interested in an espn league I&#039;d be game. I wont be sad to see my involvement in yahoo fantasy go after this baseball season&nbsp; :-P
