			Greetings,<br /><br />So you&#39;ve decided to post to our community calendar, GREAT! Here are some things to keep in mind.<br /><br /><br />* The community calendar is for community related events that are related to Astoria and those who live here.<br />* Events posted on the calendar must be open to the public.<br />* Regularly occuring activities sponsored by businesses should not go here, business listings or advertising should go in the business category of this board. (i.e. nightly &quot;happy hour&quot; at John Doe&#39;s pub should not go here, community picnic or game of football in the park should be posted here, Live Jazz with John Q. Public&#39;s band at 7pm at John Doe&#39;s pub is also ok to list here)<br />* Ideally your event should be free, however - if there is a cost involved this should be included in the listing.<br />* Please be as detailed as possible in your listing, and check back to see if people have replied to your post asking for clarification.<br />Just keep in mind that this section of the board is for community events and is not meant for general advertising of your day to day business. To clarify: If you are a business that is hosting a one-time event it&#39;s ok to post it here, but you must include all details of the event, costs, etc. If you&#39;re just hosting a 10% off sale, or a daily special, or your general business activities please post in the business listings category.<br /><br />Thanks!
