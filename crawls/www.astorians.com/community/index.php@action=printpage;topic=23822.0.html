				Hi All<br /><br /><br />I apologise but this is going to be another one of those how safe is the neighborhood threads. Please bear with me. <br /><br /><br />My girlfriend and I just signed the lease on an apartment on 33rd st and 34th ave. Next to the Locale restaurant. The apartment is great. Tree-lined street. All looks nice. We walked around the neighborhood several times though it was always during the day. <br /><br /><br />But I&#039;ve been looking at the 114th street precinct crime stats and they are alarmingly high, especially rapes and assaults. Also a lot of newspaper/website articles on a big crime spike in Astoria. Is this neighborhood safe? Is there anything we need to watch out for? It&#039;s an under ten minute walk from Broadway NQ but we will need to make that walk late-ish a couple times a week. Any advice/informed input would be appreciated.

				Wow, really? My boyfriend and I just today put down a deposit on an apartment in the same building â€“ right next to Locale. It&#039;s a first-floor unit, and we had exactly the same experience: things looked fine, then we went home and he googled crime rates in the precinct and saw those stats. What realty company did you go through?

				33rd Street and 34th Avenue is very safe.&nbsp; I live around the corner on 34th Street and there is very little crime around here - it&#039;s friendly.&nbsp; Not as many people on 34th Avenue at night as Broadway, but I&#039;ve been on the Avenue as late as 2 a.m. in the morning and never felt uncomfortable.&nbsp; 33rd Street is a major traffic conduit up to the Grand Central Parkway and Triboro, so it gets a good bit of traffic.

				the 114th encompasses a large area.&nbsp; Some parts of Astoria are nicer (and safer) than others, at least that&#039;s the way it appears.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived here for 8 years and frequented it for over 20 - I&#039;ve never felt threatened here.&nbsp; That being said, I am always cautious at night no matter where I am.&nbsp; When walking home from the subway after dark - even if it&#039;s 5:30 pm - I take the best lit route home and I usually carry keys in my knuckles and remove my headphones, but that&#039;s just me.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Also, I have a friend in the precinct who has said that alot of the violent crime is gang related either with the projects or from the Albanian gangs coming down from the Bronx to antagonize the Greeks.&nbsp; And there&#039;s a fair amount of burglary I&#039;ve been told.<br /><br /><br />Get insurance for your belongings - something apartment dwellers frequently overlook, it&#039;s really not that expensive.&nbsp; And, if you can, get an alarm system.&nbsp; Even though the cops won&#039;t respond in time to save your life or stuff [based on my own experience of 2 alarm issues in the last few years in which the cops took 70 minutes to respond, I could have walked to the precinct in 10), chances are random criminals will skip your place if you have an alarm in place, they go for the easy stuff.<br /><br /><br />

				@geowrld&nbsp; What were your two alarm issues? Both attempted break-ins? I&#039;m hoping my building will at least provide window gates.

				@mcdas:&nbsp; they were actual failures of my system, the alarm went off and I couldn&#039;t deactivate it and the police were dispatched before I could contact the alarm company.&nbsp; Regardless, as far as the police knew, my alarm went off because there was a problem (one of the times was an actual panic button issue where I completely spazzed and activated the panic signal instead of deactivating the system).&nbsp; I cannot for the life of me figure out how it took them so long to respond considering they are literally a 10 minute walk to my house.&nbsp; These 2 issues happened years apart, it&#039;s not like I have a problematic system that sends out false alarms.&nbsp; I now know that an alarm system will not save my life or belongings if actually triggered since the police are busy ... doing I don&#039;t know what.&nbsp; For that I have a large, powerful dog.&nbsp; I do believe that the alarm system is a deterrent - I guess there&#039;s a <em>chance </em>the police could actually respond within minutes and that&#039;s enough to scare off would-be burglars.&nbsp; And it would give us time to arm ourselves if we had a breach - I&#039;m a firm believer in castle laws. <br /><br /><br />Also, I would NEVER rely on a landlord to protect you or your belongings.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />I sound like a paranoid person now that I&#039;m re-reading some of what I wrote.&nbsp; I&#039;m not.&nbsp; I just believe in self-reliance.

				That&#039;s a very good area.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t worry about crime there.
