				Brasilianville Cafe &amp; Grill is a cafeteria-type place at 43-12 34th Avenue.&nbsp; There are two sections: a buffet with hot and cold food and a grill area with various cuts of meat rotating on spits; there&#39;s a counterman there who&#39;ll slice off pieces for you.&nbsp; All selections change daily.&nbsp; You pay by the pound and there are 3 different prices: buffet only, meat only, or meat + buffet.&nbsp; It&#39;s pretty reasonable no matter what option you choose.&nbsp; They also have desserts and savory pastries.<br /><br />Oh, and I&#39;ll be at the 7 PM showing!

				Had the pleasure of the 9:30 show, a terrific film (despite the R train going to Ditmars ...). Different from the book in many ways, but not at all disappointing in any of them. With Robert Downey, Jr. perfectly cast (and a personal favorite). Those of you who didn&#39;t get out tonight, I highly recommend seeing it when it gets full release.

				I agree with Jtrane about the dialogue and the cinematography. taken all together with what I consider a suberb display of emotion on the part of the actors&nbsp; I think the movie does a good job of telling a story... (as I said before)<br /><br />btw, did anyone else feel like we were in our own local Astorian version of inside the actor&#39;s studio when we had the q&amp;a at the end?<br />

				The inconsistencies in the film (ie locations and such) were probably intentional.&nbsp; Dito said that the movie was very much a memory, and how memories are altered during the years.&nbsp; You can&#39;t remember everything that happened vividly, but you can piece together the highlights and work through a memory like that.&nbsp; Or to rephrase what Dito said after the 9:30 showing was:&nbsp; &quot;I can remember sitting here, but if a guy ran through the exit door on fire and across the stage, my mind would immediately capture that.&nbsp; And if a bomb exploded outside on Broadway at the same time, my mind would remember that.&nbsp; If and when I look back at this moment, I&#39;ll remember sitting here, and it&#39;ll cut to a man on fire and then a large explosion.&quot;

				Dito is an old friend of mine and I must say it was really nice seeing him again. He actually didn&#39;t believe me when I asked him to sign my copy of his book. The movie was a great time for me personally, it captured a lot of what was going on at that time in Astoria. I also loved the movie because it made me laugh, cry, jump with scared excitement and feel an aray of different feeling&#39;s I had remembering my past in Astoria and overall I felt great after seeing it. So what more can you ask of a movie and for 10 bucks. I was a little bit disappointed that Dito didn&#39;t tell about his day&#39;s with Gutterboy and that he didn&#39;t use any of his own music in his movie. He is really a great musician and talented song writer. If you ever get a chance to listen to any of his music I am sure you will find it to be a pleasant surprise. So I think everyone should see this movie, it has a great cast and some really great emotions and feeling&#39;s about growing up that I think everyone can relate to on some level...I wish nothing but good things for my old friend that got out of the neighborhood but now is back!!!

				I just wanted to chime in here with my impressions. I also really loved seeing this movie and felt moved by the whole experience.<br /><br />My boyfriend mentioned reading a reviewer that didn&#39;t feel the connection between the older Dito story &amp; younger Dito story to be that convincing, and I could maybe see that.<br /><br />But I really loved the movie because I felt it just captured a gritty but beautiful snapshot of real life at a certain time in a certain place for a certain few people. And it was made special by getting deeply into who those few certain people were, and making you feel for them - but not by trying too hard, just by presenting them as real people. <br /><br />I thought the casting and acting were excellent, especially young Dito. I could really feel his pain and anger in that one scene with his dad in the bathroom towards the end, how he was trying so hard to restrain himself, struggling between the intensity of the emotions ripping through him and respect for his father and not knowing how to express such raw feelings.<br /><br />I didn&#39;t feel the anachronisms or geographical inaccuracies at all detracted from the movie. If anything, they made me feel special for noticing them, because I realized that for most of them, only people very familiar with Astoria would know that, for example, the stairs up to the train where they were hanging out in one scene were at 30th Ave or Broadway (? don&#39;t remember, but it was definitely not Astoria Blvd), but then when they were shown on the platform, it was at Astoria Blvd. And to have made it completely accurate to that time (with graffiti-covered trains) would have required it to have been shot then, or to have entirely recreated Astoria in some big-budget studio. Dito&#39;s explanation about this movie being a memory and trying to re-create that feeling may be convenient for explaining any inaccuracies, but I also think it works. The focus is on the feelings that they tried to convey, and they did an excellent job with that.<br /><br />This is a movie I think I&#39;d like to see again, and I don&#39;t often do that. Of course, the connection to Astoria helps a lot, but still - I was moved more by the film and the characters than the excitement of seeing my local grocery and street corners on that film (though that was really very very tres cool!).

				You know, I just read his review and it&#39;s eery because I went through the same thing.&nbsp; I grew up in Astoria, my parents moved to Florida when I was a teen.&nbsp; I NEVER forgot Astoria, the best times of my life were here, and the best childhood memories with my father, having BBQ&#39;s in Astoria Park (yes, they used to have BBQ grills there) and going to Steinway with my Mom before there was McDonalds, when Dr. Jays all the way to Kids Gap used to be a HUGE Lerners.....(they used to sell girls clothes there, that&#39;s where I got my first bra!!!)<br /><br />Then in 1989 I came back to visit and it was the first time I had come back since 1976, I literally cried when I got to Astoria, it felt like home.<br /><br />My father passed away in 1999 and that&#39;s when I decided to move back.&nbsp; The reason I had not moved back sooner was because a) my kids were small and b) I was taking care of my father that at the time was diagnosed with cancer and was very sick.<br /><br />Funny thing is that right after the burial, my mother looked at me and said...you&#39;re moving back aren&#39;t you?&nbsp; I had never said anything to her but she&nbsp; just knew.&nbsp; A year later, May 3rd, 2000, I was back.<br /><br />I have too many memories here, I feel safe here, I feel my father close here.&nbsp; It&#39;s funny because my whole family lives in Miami and yet...I don&#39;t feel alone here.<br /><br />So I can really understand what Montiel felt, there&#39;s no place like home, there really isn&#39;t.<br /><br />I grew up in Astoria and my block was 90% Greek, I grew up celebrating Christmas and Easter TWICE!&nbsp; I remember when Most Precious Blood used to keep the gates open and the kids would play street hockey and we would play handball there, I remember they would open up the gym in the summer and we could go hang out there and do crafts...and it was free.&nbsp; My first account, my father took me to open a savings account when I was 8 was at a savings &amp; loan that is now an Independent Bank.&nbsp; I remember where the bargain store on broadway (next to McGuires...my hangout, lol) used to be an A&amp;P.&nbsp; I was really sad to see the old diner on the corner of Steinway and Broadway close down after so many years, it was there when I lived here, now it&#39;s a trendy deli/whatever.&nbsp; On Steinway between Broadway and 34th Ave, where that woman&#39;s gym is (I forget the name) that used to be a toy store, the tailor right next to it....that was a pet shop.<br /><br />I have reunited with a lot of my friends (still in the neighborhood) but there are some I haven&#39;t found, Tony Pinelli (I had such a crush on him, lol), Billy Ivanko, the Fleming sisters on 34th Ave.<br /><br />Beautiful memories.<br /><br />I gotta see this movie, I&#39;m going to see it at Lincoln Square tonight.<br /><br />
