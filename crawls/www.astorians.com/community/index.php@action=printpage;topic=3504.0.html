				annie, I&#39;m really sorry you have such a bad working environment.&nbsp; I understand how it feels to have your skills and knowledge under-utilized.&nbsp; &nbsp;Have you found any luck searching for a new job? <br /><br />I used to work for a micro-manager and hated it.&nbsp; I&#39;m amazed at how some people can manage so well and be on top of things, while being kind and considerate, while others are just nit-picky and uptight (and it usually means they are more insecure than anything else).&nbsp; As someone told me recently, their behavior reflects badly on them more than it does you.&nbsp; I know this may not be any consolation, though.&nbsp; <br /><br />I hope you can find a better work situation soon!

My boss has become unbearable. He is malicious, back-stabbing, and outright terrible as a manager. I was promoted to a managerial level in August and since then, he has become even worse. Almost like he is jealous of my success and hard work over the years. I put in long days and nights here and have earned everything that has come to me, if I do say so myself. It kills him that I am being acknowledged and not him.<br /><br />Luckily he went home sick for the day and I can enjoy a leisurely afternoon without a monster breathing down my neck. Of course my sick day on Monday was suspiciously questioned even though I came in with my laryngitis, cough medicine, and sniffly nose on Tuesday morning.

				I don&#39;t really have a problem with being interrogated about absences (although I am questioned).<br />I&#39;m just being treated like a naive college intern. I was hired by the higher-ups because of my background and now I&#39;m being treated like an entry-level receptionist (no offense to the receptionists out there, I&#39;m actually just not qualified to be one! I&#39;m a terrible typist for instance). I also don&#39;t like being talked-down to.
