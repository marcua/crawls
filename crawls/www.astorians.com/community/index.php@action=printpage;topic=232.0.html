				by Louis Jenkins<br /><br />Too Much Snow <br /><br />Unlike the Eskimos we only have one word for snow but we have a lot of modifiers for that word. <br />There is too much snow, which, unlike rain, does not immediately run off. It falls and stays for months. <br />Someone wished for this snow. Someone got a deal, five cents on the dollar, and spent the entire family fortune. <br />It's the simple solution, it covers everything. We are never satisfied with the arrangement of the snow so we spend hours moving the snow from one place to another. <br />Too much snow. I box it up and send it to family and friends. I send a big box to my cousin in California. I send a small box to my mother. She writes &quot;Don't send so much. I'm all alone now. I'll never be able to use so much.&quot; <br />To you I send a single snowflake, beautiful, complex and delicate; different from all the others.

				Thanks for the sharing of the poem. I happened to found something a few hours ago, going through stuff in my room to pack. I found some of my old writing journals and happened to find my ode to snow that I would like to share. This was written over 10 years ago when I was in 12th grade so it's not the best in the world.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18px;" class="bbc_size"><span class="bbc_u"><strong>It Has Come Again</strong></span></span><br /><em>by Colleen Eustice-Sakai<br />Copyright © &nbsp;February 17, 1994</em><br /><br /><br />Each six-sided paragon glides to the ground in a majestic soothing custom; each falling in place like an enigma. Every chosen spot is unpredictable and unknowing until the six-sided charm decides to land. Finally, when each delicate flake lands it clings with fear to the thing it has landed upon, afraid that the winds might blow it away.<br /><br />As it falls with more grace and speed, each piece unites like two lovers, to form one entity. Each of these entities connects together until a virgin blanket has formed, caressing the land like a newborn babe. It is such a sight that even the angels cry with delight to be able to look down upon this splendid miracle.<br /><br />It sends everything to sleep. Animals hurry into their abodes and settle down for the long, harsh winter season. Trees and plants drop their dead leaves and sit in silence until the snow cascades over them, Rivers, ponds, streams, and lakes all hold still for the event because the snow forms a suit of armor over the water which protects it until spring is here. As for our fellow men, they come out only when they must. They don’t like the cold.<br /><br />While the snow falls, it fights the never ending battle of death with the wind. No one loves the wind, so this makes him jealous because he has no one to love. While the snow sails down to stable ground, it mocks and harasses the wind. They think it’s funny that the wind has no one to love. They know they are beautiful, and it uses its beauty to provoke the wind. The wind more resentful and enraged, tries to blow each couple apart in an indignant matter. It’s no use; however, each separated piece can easily find the love of another. This only makes the wind more wrathful, and in his wrath he blows even harder, trying to destroy anything that comes in his way. The snow keeps molesting the wind; it refuses to stop.<br /><br />In the spring the wind dies down, too tired to continue. Saddened by this the snow starts to cry until it to, can not continue. It has no one to tease now, so it has no reason to go on. At the end of the year, the elegant snow will fall again, the wind will become overly jealous again, and this resentful cycle will repeat itself.
