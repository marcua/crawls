				Our next meeting will be held on a special night WEDNESDAY October 6th at our clubhouse located at 41-05 Newtown Road, Astoria, NY 11103 at 7 PM.<br /><br />This meeting will be our unveiling of our newly renovated building. Prior to the meeting, our plumbing has been repaired, our roof has been replaced, the front of the building has been re-shingled and our windows/door has been painted.&nbsp; Your hard work and contributions to our club have paid off in a bit way.&nbsp; Come celebrate with us! <br /><br />We have invited our candidate for State Senate NYS Assemblymember Michael Gianaris and our candidate for NYS Assembly Aravella Simotas along with some other special guests to join us.&nbsp; This year&#039;s election is important for our community and come learn what Powhatan will be doing to fight for our democratic ticket. <br /><br />Our primary effort this year was a huge success on September 14th! Congratulations to our Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney who won her primary race in a big way.&nbsp; Thank you to all that came out to lend a hand.<br /><br />Lastly, save the date on Saturday November 6th.&nbsp; Powhatan will be hosting our 1st annual community shredding event and kick-off our food drive from 10am-1pm.&nbsp; More information will be sent out about this event as it gets closer.<br /><br />Hoping that each and every one of you had a great September and we look forward to seeing you on WEDNESDAY October 6th.<br /><br />Light refreshments will be served.
