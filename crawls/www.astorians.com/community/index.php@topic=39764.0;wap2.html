			&nbsp; I am moving out of the neighborhood and looking to transfer my membership to The Rock Health &amp; Fitness in Astoria. <br /><br /><br />This is a great gym! Lots of classes, 24 hours a day, new machines, clean facilities, and often not too busy. The staff is friendly, and it&#039;s conveniently located right next to the astoria ditmars stop on the train. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;ll pay the $75 transfer fee and I&#039;ll also pay one month for you $(65).<br />By transferring, you also save on signup fees and have a shorter term (ends in December).<br /><br /><br />Email me if you&#039;re interested! <br /><br /><br />Sarahsmile7@gmail.com
