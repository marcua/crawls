				I am a fan of El Mariachi (formerly Viva el Mariachi) on Broadway, between 33rd and 34th. Not as elaborate as the examples in the article, but good stuff. Carnitas is a particular favorite, likewise Chorizo.<br /><br />They have wonderful tamales as well. Or had; I haven&#039;t been there for a month or two, and now I don&#039;t find tamales on their online menu. It will make me very sad if the have them no more.<br />

				Mariachi is one of my favorites as well.&nbsp; The new place down on 36th Avenue, Chela and Garnache (at 34th Street) also has great tacos.

				I recently ordered tacos from de mole and they were delicious. The el taco del ray truck is always good, too. I hear a new Mexican restaurant just opened - Tacuba. Heard good things so far. Looking to try it!

				Mariachi remains my go-to place for Mexican, but I&#039;m addicted to their enchiladas and huevos rancheros.&nbsp; I almost never get the tacos.&nbsp; I do think they&#039;ve removed the tamales from the menu, which is sad.<br /><br /><br />I agree, Maizal is nice.&nbsp; Great food.&nbsp; I just wish the drinks were better.&nbsp; They provided some of the best service I&#039;ve had in any restaurant in Astoria.

				I&#039;m surprised no one has mentioned 31st Av Stop Deli on 31 Ave and 43 St. The best tacos is the neighborhood and fast, free delivery 24 hours a day.
