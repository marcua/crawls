				Take Root presents Catey Ott Dance Collective and Glitter Kitty Productions<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Catey Ott Dance Collective: 3rd eye (i) Conscious is a work in 3 parts: &quot;WITHIN&quot; is a quartet based on visual art works and guided meditations based on Jungian Psychology and Dream Interpretation.&nbsp; &quot;Life is (no) Daffodil&quot; is a trio based on poems by William Wordsworth and Langston Hughes in which the contrasting themes fit as one when viewing life as a counterbalance of zen, contentment and bliss with hardship, struggle, and the relentless effort needed to succeed in an ever uphill journey. &quot;ReFRACTION&quot; is a quartet inspired by the Buddhist concepts of Letting Go and Mindfulness with a hint of contrast due to the artistic need to Break Free.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Glitter Kitty Productions: &quot;The Gunfighter Meets His Match,&quot; is a contemporary western musical, conceived and written by Brooklyn based singer songwriter Abby Payne.&nbsp; The universal story, inspired by comparing the New York City music scene to &quot;The Wild West,&quot; and the short stories of Louis L&#039;Amour, is one of love, loss, and hope as a rugged gunfighter faces his ultimate high stakes battle for his truest love.&nbsp; Talented musicians, dancers, and actors under the creative direction and evoking choreography of Glitter Kitty Productions along with the emotionally wrought, and dynamic music of Abby Payne and Beth Callen, come together for a night of storytelling sure to transport you to another world.&nbsp; But wait! That&#039;s not all.... A little twist ensues....<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;June 17th &amp; 18th, 2016 at 8pm<br />&nbsp;Admission: $15<br />&nbsp;Green Space Studio<br />&nbsp;37-24 24th Street, #301<br />&nbsp;Long Island City, NY 11101<br />&nbsp;718-956-3037<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Tickets are available at the door or online at http://www.greenspacestudio.org/TakeRoot.html (http://www.greenspacestudio.org/TakeRoot.html)<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Take Root is a monthly curated series that supports dance makers by providing an opportunity to show a half evening work paired with another artist.&nbsp;
