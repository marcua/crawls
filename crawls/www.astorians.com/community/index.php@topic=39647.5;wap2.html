			Hi everyone, I had a very bad experience with him. He made a huge mess of a toilet seal that lead to a larger leak than we had. Wax got everywhere. He also stripped the threads on the toilet making it hard to fix his mess and got caulk everywhere. The wax and caulk mixed together. <br /><br /><br />In addition to this, he told us that the job would be between $200-$300, but charged us $350 stating that one of the bolts was stripped and this was the reason why he was over charging us. He didn&#039;t tell us that the charge would exceed $300. The average quote we got on Yelp was $200, and some as low as $100 from 5-star Yelpers.

			I forgot to ask what the ring looked like when you inspected it. I want to make sure that is where the leak was coming from. <br /><br />This is his text he wasnt sure where the leak was i did the job best can be and was not easy..<br /><br />Who ever installed the toilet put the lead bend on top of the bracket and bolts are not able to be removed.<br /><br />The toulet was secure when i left and i tripled check for leaks which there were none.<br /><br />His issue is not from my hands.

			Thanks for responding. <br /><br /><br />You did not tell us that there was an issue. If there was an issue, we should have been told and the issue should have been fixed. Here is my perception of what happened.<br /><br /><br />We hired you on a quote for $200-$300<br />You came and installed a new wax ring in approximately 45 minutes.<br />You charged $350 stating a bolt was frozen<br />After you left, stains appeared on the ceiling.<br />Wax and caulk were mixed together and everywhere on the floor as can be seen in the pictures<br />The toilet was smelly and leaking<br />The caps were installed improperly<br /><br /><br /><br />

			You stated you were in PA and could not return to fix the work. You also refuse to refund for the work. For these reasons, you will receive a summons for small claims court within a few weeks. It was difficult getting your address with only your phone number. We had to pay a data service to get it.
