				As many of you know I&#039;m a big supporter of Barack Obama.

I sincerely want to see Washington change, but I don&#039;t think we&#039;re going to get that by supporting legislation that legitimizes the type of behavior we&#039;ve seen for the last 8 years.<br /><br />I wrote Obama and expressed my concern through the contact form on his website (http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/contact2), or his DC office (http://obama.senate.gov/contact/index.php), and would encourage anyone else who is interested to do the same.

				Interesting. These articles seem to contradict each other, or maybe the Post is leaving out that second quote on purpose? It seems to suggest he&#039;ll support it in it&#039;s current form even with the immunity provision, but this other article seems to leave it open.

It wasn&#039;t up to the telecoms to get &#039;warrants&#039;, and treating the terrorist&nbsp; problem, like a crime problem,punishing agencies and keeping them apart for co-operating with each other is what got us into&nbsp; this&nbsp; mess in the first place. <br /><br />I posted&nbsp; a&nbsp; while back, to&nbsp; a torrent of&nbsp; negative nods :-D, whether Obama is a&nbsp; &#039;peacenik&#039; or &#039;warmonger&#039;, obvious&nbsp; exaggerations&nbsp; in&nbsp; the title, but, the fact remains, only Nixon(fierce Anti-Communist) could go to China, and many who&nbsp; claimed to be against war fought some&nbsp; of&nbsp; the wars&nbsp; once&nbsp; in office. <br /><br />I see if one wants to see the war stabilize and troops&nbsp; come home, even if it takes&nbsp; a &#039;100&#039; years, vote&nbsp; for McCain.

				I am very disappointed to see that Obama went ahead and supported the FISA legislation. For me this appears like a calculated vote, something I really believed Obama was against. It really does call into question for me his platform of &quot;changing Washington&quot; and doing away with &quot;politics as usual&quot;. FISA is not good for American citizens.<br /><br />I&#039;ve written to Obama expressing my disappointment and letting him know I won&#039;t be contributing to the campaign or volunteering any more.<br /><br />This being said I&#039;m at a loss for what to do. I certainly will vote against McCain in the upcoming election - but I&#039;m very saddened to say that as of yesterday I&#039;m back to &quot;voting for the lesser of two evils&quot; instead of voting for someone I truly support.<br /><br />Depending on how McCain is polling in NY I may vote for a third party. Like the Barack Obama of the primaries, I&#039;m very tired of politics as usual. I need change I can believe in - this is more of the same to me.

				Yes, I was very disappointed to see that too.&nbsp; Even Hillary voted against it.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t contributed to his campaign just because I haven&#039;t been fully convinced by him.&nbsp; I also don&#039;t like how campaigns are controlled by money.&nbsp; I certainly don&#039;t want McCain though.&nbsp; I was also disappointed with his recent agreements with the Supreme Court on gun ownership and the death penalty for child rapists.&nbsp; On the scale of things though, I do feel better voting for him than I did with Kerry.&nbsp; I wish more politicians were more like Dennis Kucinich in that they do what they believe and say they will do, regardless of their political aspirations or affiliations.

				By the time November comes around even the Hillary haters will wish they had had more of an open mind and voted for her. If only the Obama primary supporters had only read how many promises he flipped on in Illinois they would have known long before now that he always votes the middle-of-the-road majority when it gets down to real issues. He just seems to be liberal because he says whatever it takes to get votes and he thinks his supporters want to hear, and then votes what he, obviously, really believes. I have never truly trusted his values. His lack of experience and his agenda frightened me more than Hillary&#039;s. <br /><br /><div align="center">(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3105/2656043752_d605684268_m.jpg)</div>

				Hillary may have voted against FISA, but on other issues, she has also been quite adept at flip-flopping and siding with the Republicans and the Bush administration.&nbsp; Let&#039;s not forget her stance on the Iraq invasion for so long, for starters.&nbsp; I was also very uncomfortable with some of her major sources of campaign contributions, such as the health insurance industry (she received the most contributions from them among any candidate from any party).<br /><br />Regarding Obama though, allow me to also add that he recently announced support for expanding current Bush administration efforts to redirect social service dollars to &quot;faith-based&quot; groups and charities.&nbsp; That doesn&#039;t sound very much like &quot;change&quot; to me.&nbsp; Here&#039;s the link: http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080701/ap_on_el_pr/obama_faith.<br /><br />To me, Hillary and Obama both represent more of the same.&nbsp; And that&#039;s why, once again, a yet to be determined third party candidate will get my vote, no matter how close the election may be in New York State between Obama and McCain.<br /><br />My feeling is that if more people voted based on conscience, instead of voting just by party line or for the &quot;lesser or two evils&quot; or based on how they were influenced by the media, family, friends or campaign ads, then we would truly stand a chance for real change in the political system, instead of the superficial rhetoric of &quot;change&quot; promised by candidates like Obama.

				The only candidate I&#039;ve ever had no qualms about voting for is Dennis Kucinich.&nbsp; Unfortunately, with this election, I never had the chance to cast my vote for him.&nbsp; Where does one find out about third party candidates who are running?&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how I feel on voting for one, but I like to know all my options.

				Vote-smart.org has a comprehensive list of third party candidates here: http://www.votesmart.org/election_president_search.php?party=Other&amp;go.x=8&amp;go.y=10<br /><br />Keep in mind, some of the candidates are....more than a bit &quot;out there,&quot; like this candidate from the &quot;United Fascist Union&quot;: http://www.votesmart.org/bio.php?can_id=15772, who is also an actor, identifies as Pagan, and was a fascist &quot;storm trooper.&quot;&nbsp; Check out the photo as well...simply amazing.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, within the list, you&#039;ll also find links to the more legitimate third party candidates, like Ralph Nader, Bob Barr and Howie Hawkins.

				I was really disappointed with Obama&#039;s vote for the FISA bill yesterday. Even Hillary voted against it. I don&#039;t care for his reasons, he&#039;s a consitutional lawyer for chrissakes! He of all people knows what the repercussions from this can be. There are many things one has to compromise on as a politician. Warrantless wiretapping should never be one of them. Mind you Obama&#039;s vote wouldn&#039;t have made a difference, but this is one serious black spot on his voting record that&#039;s even less excusable than Hillary&#039;s vote to authorize going into Iraq. The Democrats are acting like they are the minority instead of the other way around. Looks like when I do vote in November, my vote will be more <span class="bbc_u">against</span> McCain as opposed to for Obama.
