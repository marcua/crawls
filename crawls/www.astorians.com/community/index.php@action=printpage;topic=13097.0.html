				I am not a Hillary fan.&nbsp; I do not think she is a good senator nor did I think she would make a good president.<br /><br />That said, I think she has the potential to be a great Secretary of State, as much of a policy wonk as she is, I think she could be a real asset to the Obama administration, so long as he can control her.&nbsp; If she is willing to follow his lead on policy issues, then I think she could do some very good things for the country in that role.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />(BTW why does Obama still come up as a misspelled word?)

				I think Hillary would be a great Secretary of State - it would be exciting to see her serve in the Obama administration.&nbsp; I keep hearing that he is considering the &quot;Team of Rivals&quot; concept, much like President Lincoln did, of having his strongest primary opponents serve in his cabinet.<br /><br />As to who would succeed Hillary, I&#039;ve heard the names of Congressmembers Carolyn Maloney, Jerry Nadler, Nita Lowey and possibly State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo.

				I mean this respectfully, but the confirmation hearing would be very interesting.&#160; Many of President Clinton&#039;s international dealings would come into issue, because they could represent a conflict of interest.

They&nbsp; were always accusing&nbsp; the Queen of England, Catholic&nbsp; Church and the &#039;Illuminati&#039;&nbsp; for&nbsp; creating&nbsp; conflict&nbsp; to enrich themselves.&nbsp; They wanted to &#039;indict&#039;&nbsp; every President&nbsp; from LBJ&nbsp; to&nbsp; Clinton&nbsp; for&nbsp; being part of&nbsp; a secret&nbsp; cabal. I didn&#039;t&nbsp; see&nbsp; them this time, I guess&nbsp; the competition for&nbsp; insane conspiracy&nbsp; theories&nbsp; has gotten so crowded, La Rouche&nbsp; finally&nbsp; seems&nbsp; sane?&nbsp; :-D
