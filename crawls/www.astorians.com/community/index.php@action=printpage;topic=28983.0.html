				Exactly , they use the word Mediterranean&nbsp; and choose to leave the turkish name out&nbsp; for obvious reasons .&nbsp; &nbsp;Same way it seems every Albanian i meet speaks greek and says they are Greek until they finally are found out (that they really arent&nbsp; Greek ) or that Greek is their second language .

				That&#039;s great! I read Truva has a pizza oven. I tried mini &quot;Turkish Pizza&quot; in a Sunnyside restaurant and it was quite tasty-thin, crispy flatbread with a thin smear of tomato sauce topped with ground lamb, spices and herbs. I&#039;m no expert on Turkish food, but if their food is fresh and tasty, prices reasonable, and the service is pleasant (to everyone) this new restaurant will be a welcome addition to the neighborhood. I hope it becomes a hit with Astorians of every culture and ethnicity.

				As an Armenian, my dad would roll over in his grave if he knew I wanted to spend money in a Turkish establishment, but there&#039;s only one legit Armenian restaurant in NYC and it&#039;s not near here. What is a girl to do? Risk being haunted by the ghost of my dead father? Or enjoy food just like my mom used to make (Armenian and Turkish foods are identical, and my grandparents emigrated from Turkey during the genocide). <br /><br />Tough decision.

				Went there on Friday night, and left impressed. Will become one of my regular destinations if it maintains the current quality of their food.<br /><br />The atmosphere is kind of comfortable-diner, which suits its moderate prices. So VERY happy to discover they weren&#039;t playing generic American pop music. I believe it was a mix of Turkish and Greek music, if I understood corre<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">ctly. <span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font">The staff seemed attuned to being welcoming and contributing to an enjoyable meal.</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font">My omnivore husband and my vegetarian self both had plentiful options to choose from. We both fully enjoyed what we ate. He had a chicken dish (chicken adana kabab, I believe), and was very happy. I had the excellent Turkish lentil soup and we split a combination plate of mezze, including a truly special ezme, a tomato and mixed vegetables chopped dip (</span></span><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">http://www.giverecipe.com/turkish-spicy-ezme-salad.html) and very good smoky babaganoush, hummus, super-fresh tabbouleh, and cacik, a Turkish yogurt, cucumber and (I think) spinach dip.</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">Got to take a second to talk about the AMAZING hot, fresh Turkish bread that they put out on your table. No doubt that alone will be responsible for many return visits of folks checking Truva out.

Very nice!</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">Kudos to this new restaurant, exactly the kind I always hope is opening in the neighborhood.

				I&#039;ve often wondered about past animosities being managed among people in the businesses in Astoria catering to immigrants from lands part of the former Yugoslavia. I&#039;ve appreciated some restaurants like Ukus and Djerdan in a not dissimilar way to how I now embrace Truva.

				Went back a second time last night, with most of the food again impressing and delicious. My hubby especially loved the salmon kababs. The ezme, the lentil soup and bread again very good. Tried the falafel, which was maybe just okay. Also enjoyed the almond pudding. <br /><br /><br />The atmosphere changed, negatively for us, with TV screens filled with Fox News&#039; Bill O&#039;Reilly show, and the previously enjoyed Turkish and Greek music replaced (at least during that time) by generic American golden oldies (Whitney Houston, Kansas, Elton John, etc.). <br /><br /><br />Our waiter explained that after 10 days of listening to the Turkish and Greek music, at least some of them pleaded for the change.<br /><br /><br />The owner, at the cash register, and a nice guy, said they&#039;d stop playing Fox News. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m aware that Fox News and the millionth revisit of the officially sanctioned (way overplayed) commercial top hits of past decades make an enjoyable atmosphere for some people. Not for me. Was ready to leave as quickly as possible. Especially when Whitney began wailing out &quot;The Greatest Love of All.&quot; Don&#039;t want to ever hear that again, honestly.

				Our waiter seemed to be the person or one of the ones who sought the change. I understand that when you work hard for service industry pay, on your feet for hours at a time, the music can help, or make it harder. It&#039;s also true that we make decisions about taking a seat for a meal in a restaurant based on music all the time. I think lots of people care less about music than we do.

				I actually think many people care quite a bit, they just can&#039;t put the finger on what it is.

They&#039;ve got a foot in the direction of generic diner, so I&#039;d think they are better off being cautious about piling on generic American music and TV.<br /><br /><br />Especially Fox News.

				I was there on Sunday and the Turkish music was playing and I liked it.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t too loud and it was relaxing to listen to.&nbsp; They also didn&#039;t have the tv on the news station.&nbsp; I hate when a restaurant has a tv on.&nbsp; I find it to be very distracting and takes away from the atmosphere.&nbsp; I hope they keep playing the Turkish music and keep the tvs off.
