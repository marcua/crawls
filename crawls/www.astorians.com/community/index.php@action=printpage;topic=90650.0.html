				<br /><br /><br />Hey all.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve lived near Steinway/21st Ave. few years now, and every summer from like June-Sep., I see dark large roaches on sidewalks and around tree trunks, particularly at night.<br /><br /><br />In my apt. building, we get these same bugs, generally June-Sep only, in the stairwells and sadly, in our apartments.&nbsp; Some folks call these &#039;waterbugs&#039; but technically, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s what they are, nor do I think they are &#039;german cockroaches&#039;.&nbsp; They don&#039;t appear to have wings, nor long tentacles in the front, and their color is more &#039;black&#039; than the dark/light caramel brown shades of a roach.&nbsp; I looked for a photo online but am not seeing my particular bug, but perhaps Upper Ditmars folks know what I&#039;m talking about?<br /><br /><br />As they say, keep your friends close and your enemies (i.e., these bugs) closer.&nbsp; The best way to know how to attack these bugs is for first understand WHAT they are.&nbsp; Anyone know?<br /><br /><br />Either way, after last summer (where it was the WORST I&#039;d ever seen in my apartment...I saw a few of these bugs just within a few weeks time, which is way too many for me....), after that, I got Combat Large Roach traps (replace them every 5 months).... I sealed up any cracks behind fridge and stove....&nbsp; I spray an insecticide with skinny tube applicator into all floor crevices in my apt. and in the stairwell, every few weeks.&nbsp; AND I bought electronic bug repellers.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I will say that...in the 10 months since I started that plan of attack, not one bug...not even the occasional centipede.&nbsp; However, then just two days ago, in my bathtub, there was another of these &#039;waterbug/german cockroach&#039; things, or whatever they are exactly.&nbsp; On one hand I feel better that at least the bug was in the tub (likely came right out of the tub spout) plus because he couldn&#039;t escape from the slippery tub, I was easily able to kill him.&nbsp; But...now I am a bit paranoid...that maybe the season is once again starting up for these bugs.<br /><br /><br />Any insights appreciated!!<br /><br /><br />Tku!

				I&#039;m really sure you&#039;re talking about a variety of waterbug.&nbsp; As you know, the same bug is called by many names, and different bugs are called by the same name, so unless you get a close-up photo and show it to an entomologist you may never know precisely what they are.&nbsp; It&#039;s sounds like you&#039;re doing all you can to keep them out of your house and it&#039;s working.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I always add one more piece of advice about waterbugs: don&#039;t buy potatoes by the pre-packaged sack, pick them out one by one so you can make sure there are no bugs on them.&nbsp; My husband used to insist on buying potatoes by the sack and every time he brought one home we&#039;d have waterbugs.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t checked anywhere to see if waterbugs particularly like potatoes, but he stopped buying the sacks and we stopped having waterbugs.<br /><br /><br />Beetles usually hold their wings close to their bodies so they might not be easily visible on the bugs you&#039;re seeing, but they definitely do fly.&nbsp; &nbsp;
