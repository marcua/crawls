				Hello,<br />I&#039;m a music major at Hunter College. I live in the Ditmars area and I always see people with instruments and hear people playing music. I play trumpet, guitar, and a bit of piano. I&#039;m really into Sonic Youth-like experimental music. I would love to find some new people in the area to jam with. I&#039;m a student and I work a lot, so I don&#039;t have time to really work on an album or play shows, but if anyone is interested in jamming with a trumpet player from time to time, please reply. I&#039;m desperate for musician friends in the area. <br />Thanks,<br />Christopher

				Okay, cool. What&#039;s you number? Perhaps we could jam sometime this weekend. I have a busy weekend but I believe sunday would work well.

				Thanks for your info, but if I were you, I wouldn&#039;t put it up on the local boards.&nbsp; Especially your email per the spam monsters that search for @ symbols and such.

				Hey Christopher,&nbsp; I also go to Hunter (M.A. Latin Education) and live near Ditmars.&nbsp; I play percussion and write wind music as well for several high schools.&nbsp; At the moment I have &quot;a&quot; drum with me (I know, can&#039;t exactly contribute a whole lot right now), but if you have a space set aside for jamming I&#039;d be able to bring down a couple other pieces of my kit.&nbsp; Either way, if you ever want to &quot;talk shop&quot; with some beers at the pub just send me a message (that goes for anyone else with similar interests...moved from Ma, don&#039;t know too many people around here).<br /><br />Lance

				Greetings Astorians!&nbsp; This is my first post.&nbsp; I play guitar, drums, bass, and keyboard.&nbsp; I can bring a guitar and small amp if someone has a place to jam.&nbsp; I&#039;m working on getting a portable drum kit.&nbsp; I was also wondering, is there a bar that does an open mic where you can jam with the house band?&nbsp; I&#039;m at Ditmars/33rd.&nbsp; Anyone care to host a jam sometime soon?<br />&nbsp; Just one more thing... What&#039;s the deal with jam/practice space in astoria?&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s expensive.

				this thread is pretty old, i noticed...but what the hey.&nbsp; i play guitar &amp; live on 36th and bway.&nbsp; im too busy with work to take it very seriously now, but i still like to dabble, and would enjoy some casual freeform jamming every now and then.&nbsp; my downstairs neighbor is somewhat touchy about noise, so i can&#039;t really host, but i could bring my electric &amp; pod and a small amp if some other people are up for hosting a little jam.<br /><br />simon

				Hey I wanted to revive this- who&#039;s up for a Jam either Saturday or next week after 6?<br />I play guitar, bass vocals, as do 2 of my roommates. We would love to have a percussionist come by or another bassist as well.&nbsp; :evil:<br />You can email me at Casicua[AT]Yahoo[Dot]Com

				Hey, <br />I wanted to apologize. My girlfriend set this account up for me and posted the message but I lost the password and never got around to checking the site. I&#039;m ridiculous. Again, sorry. As for the post, yeah, seems like plenty of people are interested in jamming.&nbsp; :-D<br /><br />Tastes:<br />Beck<br />Sonic Youth<br />Deerhoof<br />The Kinks<br />Cannibal Ox<br />Wu-Tang<br />The Beatles<br />John Zorn<br />Mike Patton&#039;s work: Mr. Bungle, Faith No More, Fantomas, Naked City, etc.<br />Daft Punk<br />Ween<br />Ratatat<br />The fricking Champs<br />Blur<br />Mr. Oizo<br />Weezer<br />Debussy<br />Philip Glass<br />Cibo Matto<br />Godspeed you black emperor<br />Air<br /><br />I think you get the idea.<br /><br />Instruments: In order of proficiency<br />1. Trumpet<br />2. Guitar<br />3. Piano<br />4. Voice<br />5. Drums (I&#039;m barely learning)<br />6. Clarinet (Just getting started with. I don&#039;t think it counts.)<br /><br />Also:<br />I&#039;m interested in those who are musically proficient. I&#039;m no virtuoso myself, but at least 4-8 years experience with an instrument would be cool. Maybe that&#039;s ridiculous. I dunno. Other than that, I&#039;m really interested in what songs you may have written. Feel free to post links to your own songs. Also, if you could tell me the sorts of bands you like, I&#039;d love to know. Oh and if you could tell me all the different instruments you play or if you just prefer to work with one.<br /><br />

				Experienced Drummer and Bassist ready to get a band going. We need some VOX/Lead Guitar(s) and anything else. Funky, Hippie Rock, Jam oriented sound. Definitely need some strong VOX in a musician. Bassist can sing lead on some songs and backup on all others.<br /><br />Look, we have been on the road, stayed in cheap hotels and slept in a van. That was 10 years ago. We are in our early 30&#039;s now, and we are looking to get music going again and find its place in our lives. Rehearse once a week (maybe twice), with the intention of playing monthly gigs. Don&#039;t let any of this fool you though, we are obsessed, dedicated musicians. We have done mostly originals our whole careers, but here&#039;s the covers we&#039;ve been jamming on right now (Grateful Dead, Phish, Allmans, etc)...please use the following song lost as a measurement of the type of musicians we are and what we&#039;re looking for :<br /><br />Cream Puff War (Grateful Dead)<br />Cryptical Envelopment &gt; The Other One (Grateful Dead)<br />The Eleven (Grateful Dead)<br />Cream Puff War (Grateful Dead)<br />Salin&#039; Cross the Devils Seas (Allman Brothers)<br />Axilla (Phish)<br />Woflman&#039;s Brother (Phish)<br />Fee (Phish)<br />Julius (Phish)<br />Mike&#039;s Song (Phish)<br />Horn (Phish)<br /><br />Plus a Few Original Tunes from back in the day, and some Blind Melon and others as well. (If you have any as well, bring &#039;em)<br /><br />Let us know!!! We rehearse at Astoria Soundworks right now, with the occasional excursion out to the drummer&#039;s house in LI. If you want to get together and jam towards a goal, let us know.<br /><br />PM me if you are interested.<br />Peace out.
