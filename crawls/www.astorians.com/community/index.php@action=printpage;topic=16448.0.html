				probably not as close as you want but there is a great place on Ditmars, right near 31st street.&nbsp; it is on the second floor, in the building next to starbucks.&nbsp; i can&#039;t remember the name, but it is run by two chinese women who are very nice and have thumbs of steel.&nbsp; the place is very clean, and i don&#039;t think they are super-busy.&nbsp; I have gone without an appointment and have rarely had to wait very long.&nbsp; I love to go there!<br /><br />an hour costs $50 (I think, might be $60--i can never remember.&nbsp; either way, it is a great deal.)

				I&#039;ve heard great things about massages at The Yoga Room on 35th ave and 38th street, walking distance from Steinway and 30th ave.<br /><br />There is not much on their site about massages, but I&#039;m sure they would be happy to give you some info if you call: (718)-274-0255

				Again, not 30th Ave./Steinway area, but I&#039;ve had massages at Spa Hydra and highly recommend them.<br /><br />Beautiful space, very clean, quiet. I&#039;ve had a few other services there and was always pleased. <br />They&#039;re on 35th or 36th Street, between 35th &amp; 36th Avenues.<br /><br />Here&#039;s their site: www.spahydra.com<br /><br />To be honest, I know the 30th Ave. area well - lived here all my life and there&#039;s not much there for<br />massages. Some of the nail salons on the avenue will offer back and foot massages which are reasonably priced,<br />but not full body. Plus I think you want a licensed therapist, who is certified and knows what they&#039;re doing. <br /><br />Good luck. <br />
