				Astorians for Peace &amp; Justice (AFPJ) is pleased to announce <strong><em>What can ‘We the People’ do to end the war in Iraq?: Learn the Facts</em></strong>, a forum to be held at the Bohemian Hall in Astoria on March 15th at 7:30 p.m. The featured speakers will be <strong>Judith Leblanc</strong> of United for Peace &amp; Justice and <strong>Arun Gupta</strong> of The Indypendent. After the presentations by the speakers there will be a question and answer session.<br /><br /><strong>Judith Leblanc</strong> is the National Co-chair of United for Peace &amp; Justice, a coalition of more than 1,300 local and national groups working to end the Iraq war and challenge our government’s policy of permanent warfare and empire building. Judith will discuss the anti-Iraq war movement within the context of the broader “war on terror”. She will focus on how the anti-war movement can challenge the neo-conservatives’ “war on terror” and how today’s organizing efforts against the war form the basis for a broader movement to challenge the full spectrum of&nbsp; U.S. foreign policy.<br /><br /><strong>Arun Gupta</strong> is a founding editor of The Indypendent. The Indypendent was launched in September 2000 and is a progressive, anti-war newspaper based out of New York City. The Indypendent is dedicated to creating a true alternative to the corporate media. Arun will discuss the Sunni-Shia sectarian violence currently taking place in Iraq. He will also provide context for the war in Iraq, focusing on neo-liberalism, the politics of petro-dollars and other historical factors that have come into play since the beginning of the current conflict in Iraq.<br /><br />AFPJ, a member group of United for Peace &amp; Justice, is a neighborhood group focusing on peace and justice issues and working to build community through education, outreach, cultural exchange, and political action. We are an independent, non-partisan, and non-sectarian organization that believes all people have the right to live in peace and with dignity. For more information please visit our website at www.astoriansforpeace.org or e-mail us at info@astoriansforpeace.org. The Bohemian Hall is located at 29-19 24th Ave. in Astoria, Queens,&nbsp; between 31st and 29th Streets.
