				Per Astoria Post, the owner of Francis Cafe will relaunch the restaurant in three weeks, under the new name Mussels &#039;N Sausages.&nbsp; The food will be inspired by the Alsace region of France (near Germany).&nbsp; &nbsp;Sauces to accompany mussels will come from French as well as Thai and other cuisines; German, French and Spanish sausages will be available.&nbsp; So with 2 Lizards, the corner of Ditmars and 35th is going to be hoppin.<br /><br />

				I wish them success. It is an odd name. The name sounds like to me that it could be geared towards two groups; to those who pump iron or a lgbt friendly place.&nbsp; I am sure that neither is the case and that they want to appeal to all but I still find the name to be rather odd.&nbsp;

				Moules et frites (mussels and fries) is very popular in Belgium and France. Are they keeping the name of the restaurant in English? Moules et saucissons sounds more appealing than &quot;mussels and sausages.

				Well they opened but every time I pass by all I see are waiters and waitresses wearing fancy uniforms standing around and no customers.&nbsp; They put out a chalkboard saying they have brunch but still no customers.&nbsp; If it keeps up like this I dont&#039; think they will be in business for long.&nbsp; I for one have no desire to go to this place.&nbsp; Sausages isn&#039;t something that I like to eat and I think they are charging too much for mussels.&nbsp; They should have other things on the menu if they want to stay in business.&nbsp; I think they need to make some changes.

				I don&#039;t understand why this place never seems to have any business. All of the other restaurants in the area seem to be busy every day. I really thought the food at Francis Cafe was amazing, and I want to try Mussels N&#039; Sauseges. Is it the name? The decor? Do people not want French food? It just really confuses me. I think they may have messed up by keeping the restaurant closed for so long in the beginning. When it was Francis Cafe, I remember the store just sitting empty for months. They also didn&#039;t have a liquor liscense for a very long time. I hope they can stay open after this rebranding, but it&#039;s not looking good so far.&nbsp; :sad:
