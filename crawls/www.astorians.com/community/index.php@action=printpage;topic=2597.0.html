				Hi there,<br /><br />I am new to the board, but not now exactly new to Astoria. I lived on 29th st and 36th ave for 3 years, and in May I just moved to an apartment further up at 48th st and 31st ave (because it&#39;s cheaper). <br /><br />I feel totally isolated though...help!! I knew it would be more residential, but this is <em>ridiculous</em>. <br /><br />I&#39;m an illustrator, looking to find a local art community. Are there any other artists up by these parts....or even just in the Astoria/LIC area....who know of any communites, events, and the like?<br /><br />It would be so great to meet other artist friends in the hood&#39;, and branch out from NYC and Brooklyn.&nbsp; Thanx!<br /><br />-Andrea<br />

				http://www.bquack.com/<br /><br />They have artist gatherings every month.&nbsp; I&#39;d be happy to go with you, didn&#39;t know anybody the first time around, and didn&#39;t realize I had to schmooze and that it was a mixer.&nbsp; Perhaps if I met more people, it would be fun :)<br /><br />I&#39;m an animator, lived in Astoria 9 yrs.&nbsp; Don&#39;t know many artists out here though, but would love to meet more.

				Hi Daisy, thanx for the reply. That would be cool! I would definitely go. I checked out their website...seems we missed the one for July. Hope they&#39;ll have another one soon. <br /><br />It bugs me when I start to think (the unthinkable)<em> &quot;should I have moved to Brooklyn or more south, in LIC??&quot;</em> But I&#39;m determined to stop moping, and just move on to finding people. There&#39;s GOT to be other artists searching for the same thing...!&nbsp; :-)

				Brooklyn Schmooklyn.....<br /><br />I like Queens and I find the residential feel and diversity inspiring.&nbsp; Embrace it, there&#39;s always someone fun to draw or animate here.&nbsp; That&#39;s what people watching&#39;s for&nbsp; :-)

				Hello~<br />I was happy to see this post...I&#39;m a painter living in Astoria as well (and love living here!) It is funny that so many artists want to be in Brooklyn nowadays. I like visiting Brooklyn of course, but feel that Astoria is the place to be :wink:<br /><br />I also feel some of the artistic isolation though. A few of my artist buddies are in grad school- for their MFA&#39;s- and so are automatically immersed in the art world. But being out of school for a few years now- I find that it&#39;s harder to make the time to paint and discuss art in general with other artists. The Astorian artist get-together mentioned above looks like a great idea though and I&#39;m thinking about going- I think the next one is Aug. 3rd? <br /><br />I&#39;m curious about different ways that you guys stay connected to your art- whether it&#39;s classes, crit groups, museum visits....I just haven&#39;t had the motivation and focus lately in my studio- and it&#39;s starting to get to me. (that and a full time job getting in the way). But really, I know that I&#39;ve still painted and worked full time before- how do you guys juggle the two different worlds?<br /><br />Anyway- enjoy the day and looking forward to hearing more...<br />Sara<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Is BQuack this Thursday? Shoot, I&#39;m going to miss it due to a wedding rehearsal (though, thankfully, not mine)&nbsp; :-D<br /><br />I&#39;d love to hear how it goes! And if there are any other artsy things going on, get to-gethers, etc.

				#1) The original poster lives on my block.<br /><br />#2) This is the first time I&#39;ve posted, much less to an inquiry about local artists and feel rather silly about it; I illustrate in my free-time but can&#39;t seem, or haven&#39;t at least tried, to make a living at it and therefore feel a bit low on the totem so to speak.<br /><br />#3) Is Bquak something more then a mixer? I&#39;m not really looking to schmooze which might leave you questioning what I want exactly.&nbsp; To answer the incidental query: I haven&#39;t a bloody clue - Maybe a group of friends that I can draw amongst or an excuse to actually draw more. So I guess in short, the critical eye of peers.&nbsp; :-o &lt;--which doesn&#39;t look like this.

				Hi guys,<br />I&#39;m an illustrator as well. I&#39;m on 30th st. near 35th ave.<br /><br />I&#39;m keeping the Bquack site as a bookmark, and will try to make a &quot;gathering&quot; soon. Astoria is full of musicians and artists, with no where to meet! There are no galleries, no sketch classes, no bars where bands can play, it&#39;s sad really.

				Did anyone end up going to the last Bquack gathering? I wasn&#39;t able to go, but wish that I had gone. Perhaps I&#39;m also a little shy, although at some point I&#39;m sure the need to just hang out with other artists will push me out of my comfort zone...

				There&#39;s an event on September 7th at Waltz.&nbsp; I think I might go.&nbsp; I belonged to an artists group in Brooklyn, but that was all about critique and shows--I don&#39;t know about this mixer biz.
