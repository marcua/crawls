				<span style="font-family: courier;" class="bbc_font">I&#039;m not sure this is the right thread to post this in, so my apologies if this is not correct! I had to share my experience with this place, and after reading the other awful reviews on Yelp, I knew I had to get the word out for everyone who&#039;s had a bad experience.</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier;" class="bbc_font">I would love to recommend the 36<sup>th</sup> St Animal Clinic as a place to bring your pet, but one of their employees, Justin, ruins their entire business. The story is below, but basically, he does not know how to deal with customers that just lost their pet. Screaming at me while I’m standing there crying, all because I was upset they didn’t catch my dog’s disease. </span><br /><span style="font-family: courier;" class="bbc_font"> </span><br /><span style="font-family: courier;" class="bbc_font">My dog was weak one day, so I brought her in and the vet found she had sprained one of her ankles, he wrapped it up, and prescribed some pain killers and anti-inflammatory medicine, and recommended some doggie toothpaste to go. A few days later, I had to bring her to an Emergency Animal Services center. She was weak, vomiting blood, and wasn’t eating. They said she had an auto immune disease and would likely die. After a few more tests, it showed she had Lyme disease also. A “perfect storm,” as they said. I was devastated. When I called to cancel her follow-up appointment with 36 St, the girl on the phone was very cold, and I was crying, telling them I couldn’t reschedule the appointment since she would likely die and they failed to realize how sick she was. I said some choice words while on the phone. Just bad words while I was in a state of not thinking clearly. I even called the next day and spoke with a guy, Justin (who is the Vet Tech there) to apologize and let them know that she indeed had passed away.</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier;" class="bbc_font"> </span><br /><span style="font-family: courier;" class="bbc_font">A few days later, I went to return the toothpaste. I had no intention of causing any trouble.&nbsp; I had already apologized for my previous telephone breakdown.&nbsp; When I walked in, the girls behind the counter gave me a very hard time about returning this toothpaste. I started crying a bit since they were making it more difficult then it had to be, and told them so.</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier;" class="bbc_font"> </span><br /><span style="font-family: courier;" class="bbc_font">All of a sudden, Justin the Vet Tech came around the counter and started YELLING. Red in the face, yelling at me. </span><br /><span style="font-family: courier;" class="bbc_font">“It’s not our fault Lexi died,”&nbsp; “We diagnosed her &quot;AS IS.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;AS IS,&quot; he&#039;s screaming!&nbsp; He continued to say that they had given her an x-ray, that I had brought her in for a limp and they treated her for a limp. He completely omitted the part where I brought her in because she was weak and couldn&#039;t walk!&nbsp; He continued YELLING at me as I&#039;m standing there crying. He’s saying that if I brought her in for diarrhea and vomiting, they would have checked for Lyme. I’m screaming back at him that, &quot;The first sign of Lyme is weakness in the joints and difficulty walking.&quot; (NOT vomiting or diarrhea.)</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier;" class="bbc_font"> </span><br /><span style="font-family: courier;" class="bbc_font">There is absolutely no way this Justin has taken any kind of classes to deal with grieving people, or even how to deal with people. All he cared about was the legal issue I could have possibly brought upon them. I ended up just leaving as I was bawling. I couldn’t handle it anymore. </span><br /><span style="font-family: courier;" class="bbc_font"> </span><br /><span style="font-family: courier;" class="bbc_font">A few weeks went by, and I went to a few places to return things/collect my keys from dog walking services. I’ve spoken to all of them about the situation. I heard twice – TWICE – that this Justin kid has “some big social problems.” That shocked me, not the fact that he does – it’s very obvious – but that this Animal Clinic knows about his problems and still allows him to interact with customers. The Clinic itself is fine (normal following up/clean facility/etc), but Justin should be fired for treating customers the way he did. Because of him, I would not recommend the entire business to ANYONE with a beloved pet. </span><br /><span style="font-family: courier;" class="bbc_font"> </span><br />&nbsp;

				First, I&#039;d like to say I&#039;m so sorry for your loss.&nbsp; I lost my cat last year to a sudden illness and I know how heartbreaking and devastating it can leave you.&nbsp; Regardless of whether or not this vet was negligent (and it sounds to me like he was), there is no excuse for the way you were treated at this office.&nbsp; Thank you for sharing your story.&nbsp; I hope to adopt another cat eventually and was considering using this veterinary practice, as it is close to home.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be sure to steer clear of this place.<br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;m glad this got to someone. The vet was very nice when I was in there, but what happened after was just awful. This Justin guy also claimed that he spoke to my vet in NJ and they told him that he didn&#039;t do anything wrong with the diagnosis. I immediately called both my regular vet in NJ and the emergency care center where she died, and both had said they didn&#039;t speak to him, and even if they did it wasn&#039;t their place to call a misdiagnosis or not. He blatantly lied to try to cover his own ass.<br /><br /><br />Just as back story, I just moved here from NJ, which is why it sounds like I have a million vets. I had my regular one in NJ, then found the one in Astoria. I was visiting my mom in NJ when she got really bad which is how she ended up at the e.r. there.

				Perhaps you should let the vet know exactly how you were treated by his staff - there&#039;s a chance he doesn&#039;t even know what happened.&nbsp; Not that I&#039;d go back there anyway, but just so he&#039;s aware and has the chance to correct the problem.&nbsp; Personally I have always found it very hard to find a good vet.&nbsp; Even the ones that seem kind and caring with your pets are always trying to rip you off for every last penny they can get out of you.&nbsp; If you need a vet for another pet, I&#039;ve had luck with the clinic at the Humane Society on East 59th Street in Manhattan. I know it&#039;s a trek and it&#039;s a pain because you have to prepay your appointment, but their prices are reasonable and they won&#039;t charge you for a bunch of unnecessary tests.&nbsp; I may even go there to adopt another cat, when I feel ready.&nbsp; Sorry again for your loss&nbsp; :sad:

				Amandaek - <br /><br />I&#039;m very sorry for your loss.&nbsp; What an absolutely horrific experience.&nbsp; I have not been to that vet but I can recommend Astoria Vet. Group on Steinway (between 24 and 23rd Aves - I believe) and The Animal Clinic of Long Island City.&nbsp; The former has an amazing and caring staff, but the latter is much closer to me so I go there even though I&#039;m not thrilled with their vets.&nbsp; However, I also love the Humane Society.&nbsp; That&#039;s where we adopted our cat and it was an amazing experience. I have yet to use their vet practice, but I&#039;m thinking of doing so because the Animal Clinic of LIC diagnosised&nbsp; my cat with a heart murmur and wanted to do a very expensive ultrasound.&nbsp; I think I&#039;d rather get a second opinion first and, if she has to get an ultrasound, I bet the humane society will be cheaper.

				<br />Mer, what was it like adopting your cat from the Humane Society?&nbsp; We adopted our cat from the North Shore Animal League many years ago when they had brought some cats over to Petco in Manhattan for an adoption event.&nbsp; They checked two references and we had to pay about $100 donation fee I think.&nbsp; Is it pretty similar at the Humane Society?&nbsp; We have used their veterinary clinic and had good experiences - they really seem to just do what is necessary and not try to get you to do expensive procedures that your pet doesn&#039;t need.

				Sucks about your pet and im sure the actions of this guy didnt make it easier . I went thru something like that when a girlfriends pet bird died and the staff was totally cold as she was hysterical crying . It was as if they were trained to answer in the same exact robotic tone abt the dying pet . No emotion or anything else said but &quot; Im sorry , i dont know anything else about this &quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Its possible this guy Justin was having a real hard day , but still working in a place like that , you have to be totally understanding at all times .&nbsp; &nbsp;\<br />Just wondering , where they giving you a hard time about returning the toothpaste ?

				For adoption, another place to consider is the ASPCA on E 92nd St. I adopted my cat from there last year and was very happy with the experience. If you want an adult cat, cats over 3 years old are free. The people I dealt with were all very nice, and the place was clean. They do some follow-ups with people who adopt animals from them to see if there are any problems.

				Thank you for telling me this Essen.&nbsp; I actually do want an adult cat and I was just checking out the ASPCA website and falling in love with some of the beautiful cats they have for adoption.&nbsp; I keep going back and forth though on whether our family is ready to adopt again.

The second time when I called to apologize, I asked if I would be able to return the toothpaste and they said yes. That&#039;s why I was getting upset when the two girls were giving me problems when I brought it back. You&#039;d think they&#039;d have some kind of communication... I try to not be self-centered, but if they had a patient who&#039;s pet died THAT WEEK, and were expecting her to come in, that they would tell each other what was happening. :\

				Anyone have any recommendations on where one can get a male cat fixed as a reasonable price? The Vet GRoup on Steinway off of the GCP is a great palce, but they charge $295, which seems a bit high.

				I don&#039;t know what they charge, but the clinic at 36th Avenue &amp; 32nd Street has a very good staff. I switched from the Steinway group to there when my dog was in his last days. They were terrific w/him and their prices for an exam, test, were lower.<br /><br /><br />They also offer a senior discount if that helps. But I really liked them and always recommend their services.

				Count me in as another person who accidentally mistook this thread as being about the Animal Clinic of LIC on 36th Ave.<br /><br /><br />And I have to second the good experiences there, especially since their actual Yelp reviews are mixed. My 5 year old cat had a serious medical issue recently, and while I can&#039;t say I was 100% impressed with the experience (we had to take a side trip to the emergency vet in Forest Hills, who did some very expensive imaging scans and finally ID&#039;ed the actual problem), I felt like they cared and were doing the best they could. I live very close by, and nothing beats being able to rush your beloved pet in for emergency surgery on 15 minutes notice, which happened. <br /><br /><br />Their prices were reasonable and they dealt with us outside of normal business hours more than once throughout the ordeal. They were also helpful in helping me troubleshoot the pilling process during his recovery, and did some necessary followups (like a quick exam when he somehow managed to bust a couple stitches) free of charge, which was a relief after the high cost of the whole crisis.<br /><br /><br />I do wish their exam room walls went all the way up to the ceiling. I had to listen to one person being told they should put their cat down, and another family watching their dog be put down, on two separate visits. Very sad for them, and emotionally difficult to hear when we were dealing with a life-threatening crisis ourselves. <br /><br /><br />So in short, are they the most amazing vets in the city? Probably not, but we will definitely continue to go there in the future, and I hope they&#039;re around for a long time to come.

				I brought my cat to the Animal Clinic of LIC on 36th Ave and they misdiagnosed him and had us go see an orthopedic specialist at the AMC. Even the vet at the AMC misdiagnosed him, though, so I can&#039;t fault the LIC vet too much -- though an emergency followup at the AMC ultimately yielded the correct diagnosis and the sad experience of having to euthanize him.<br /><br />Now we bring our other cat and dog to Astoria Vet Group on Steinway off of the GCP where they see Dr. Smith for routine care. She&#039;s great with them. Our dog has glaucoma, so she sees a specialist at the former NYC ER Vets.<br /><br />
