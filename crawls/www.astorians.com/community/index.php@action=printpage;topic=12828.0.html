				I don&#039;t know the answer but I am guessing it is because it takes only a few minutes to vote if there aren&#039;t long lines and the polls are open from 6AM to 9PM in NY and you should be able to vote and still go to work.&nbsp; That being said my job closes on election day only when it is a presidential election and I&#039;m happy to have the day off every four years that way I can vote early and often :wink:

				You know, I just don&#039;t like the concept of early voting or voting by mail (though for the latter there are obviously circumstances where it is necessary).&nbsp; For early voting, it just doesn&#039;t seem to make sense for me for some people to vote earlier than others, when a lot can happen between the start of early voting and election day itself.&nbsp; A more sinister thought is that by having ballots laying around for so long, you&#039;re also creating a situation where there is a greater chance that they would be tampered with (though electronic voting machines and their constant malfunctions seem to ensure problems no matter when voting takes place!).&nbsp; And as for voting by mail...honestly I just wouldn&#039;t trust sending in a ballot by mail when I could cast it in person.&nbsp; Judging by the amount of other people&#039;s mail that I receive almost on a daily basis, I can&#039;t say I have much faith in the USPS!

				I think there&#039;s nothing wrong with the government endorsing a national holiday to vote.&nbsp; It should be a day to celebrate our right to vote and change our leadership by going to the polls.&nbsp; We are lucky enough to have that right, some countries don&#039;t have these rights at all.

				A lot of states have been moving toward voting by mail.&nbsp; Washington and Oregon almost entirely vote by mail at this point.&nbsp; I think it will eventually happen in NY, and I think it will allow more people to participate in the process.

				Private businesses are not required to give their employees off on a national holiday. So the only people who will have off (or get paid a premium) is government workers. And if private employers do decide to grant the holiday, I think you will have less people show up due to the prdictable exodus. <br />I guess I am one of the few who like it the way it is.

				Senators and Congressmen take so many days off around the election to campaign and to &quot;consult with constituents&quot;, it would make sense if constituents had the same days off.<br /><br />More seriously, if election day were a holiday, I would think some people would take the opportunity to travel. Or to hang around the polls annoying voters. I think it would be as likely to reduce participation as to increase it. I don&#039;t recall ever missing an election because of work.

				And yet, in most nations where election day is a national holiday, voter turnout rates are much higher than they are here.&nbsp; Yes, in some of those countries, voting is &quot;required&quot; by law...but these are usually laws that are barely enforced, if at all (and by barely, I mean that there&#039;s a tiny fine...in Australia it&#039;s $20).&nbsp; No country has 100% turnout, law or not, but many countries, including those where democracy has much more of a dubious history, have much higher turnout rates than ours, and most of those countries have a national holiday on Election Day.<br /><br />Then again, in most countries, whoever wins the election takes office immediately, not after two or three months.&nbsp; Delays like this give the outgoing president/party time to do some &quot;last minute housekeeping&quot; while remaining relatively under the radar as a lame-duck administration in its last days.&nbsp; Check this out, for instance: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/30/AR2008103004749.html<br /><br />&quot;The White House is working to enact a wide array of federal regulations, many of which would weaken government rules aimed at protecting consumers and the environment, before President Bush leaves office in January.<br /><br />The new rules would be among the most controversial deregulatory steps of the Bush era and could be difficult for his successor to undo. Some would ease or lift constraints on private industry, including power plants, mines and farms.<br /><br />Those and other regulations would help clear obstacles to some commercial ocean-fishing activities, ease controls on emissions of pollutants that contribute to global warming, relax drinking-water standards and lift a key restriction on mountaintop coal mining. &quot;

				Yeah, I always thought election day was a public holiday- no school, no mail... but generally ignored in the private sphere....

				Why not the first Sat (or Sun) in November? Yes many people work on weekends but I&#039;d guess not nearly as many as M-F. And I&#039;m sure people could fit in a vote _somewhere_ around their church-going and shopping. Yes, this would mean an additional day of school for kids and teachers. Most parents could probably live with that.<br /><br />I was thinking this morning while waiting in a line of confused people that if it was on a weekend there could be WAY more volunteers and/or people to coordinate. The people there were trying, and it wasn&#039;t utter chaos or anything, but there was a general level of confusion and shrugging the whole time. &quot;This line? Wait where did they get those cards? Is this 39 or 59 line?&quot;, etc. Thankfully those people volunteer at all, but it wouldn&#039;t hurt to make it easier for more to volunteer...
