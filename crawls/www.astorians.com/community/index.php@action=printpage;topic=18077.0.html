				I need to bring my gf to Astoria Mount Sinai hospital on Monday morning for foot surgery.&nbsp; I need to arrive around 7:30 and will be there for several hours.&nbsp; I notice that there is alternate side parking&nbsp; on that day from 8:30 - 10:00.&nbsp; Is there a place to park nearby?&nbsp; I don&#039;t care if I have to pay.&nbsp; Thanks.

				If you are speaking of the main building on 30th Avenue, there are only meters and they ticket every day during the street cleaning times.<br /><br />If you are referring to the ambulatory center on 30th Road, the alternate side is from 11:30 to 1:00 and they ticket 4 days a week.<br /><br />The answer in one word: NO. And if you park on the wrong side of the street you will be ticketed or if you park at a meter during street cleaning times you will also be ticketed.<br /><br />This hospital should move to a location where they can provide a massive parking lot like the hospitals in Nassau County do.

				I don&#039;t care how far I have to walk I can come back to the hospital to drive her home.&nbsp; I just need to be in the hospital during the alternate side times.&nbsp; Is there a municipal lot within 10 blocks of the hospital?

				If you go to Google Maps and look at Crescent St. just North of 30th Ave in Street View you will see a valet parking booth on the West side of the street. I don&#039;t know how current the picture is but you could take a ride and check it out before you need it.
