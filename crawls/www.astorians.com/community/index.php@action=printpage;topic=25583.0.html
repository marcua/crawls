				The Associated in the shopping plaza at 21st Street and Broadway has remodeled, changed their layout, and will have new food services.&nbsp; The deli is now located closer to the entry, they will have by-the-pound serve-yourself hot foods, and a fresh fish counter.<br /><br /><br />I was at the store yesterday and it looks as if the hot food service isn&#039;t available yet and the fish section is still being installed, but they have nice looking tiles on the walls.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Nice to see that it didn&#039;t close. I find it odd that as the density of Astoria increases, a number of supermarkets have closed. The area west of 21st Street is a supermarket wasteland and I don&#039;t know what I would do if I lived over there. <br /><br /><br />There used to be another Associated on 21st St. -- not all that long ago -- between Newtown &amp; 30th Avenues. It is now a 99 cents shop. I don&#039;t think I ever went in there, but people on this board complained about shoddy products. It would seem to be an ideal location for a supermarket, given all the apartment buildings that have gone up on 21st St.<br /><br /><br />There was also a supermarket in the building which now houses Staples, behind the Neptune Diner, near the Astoria Blvd. subway stop.&nbsp; And I still miss the King Kullen on Steinway &amp; 35th Ave. that was in the building that now houses PC Richards, across from the Astoria movie &#039;plex. That was a nice store. It was a real supermarket, with a huge selection and, best of all, wide, wide aisles.<br /><br /><br />More recently, the Pathmark on Northern Blvd. closed. That was another real supermarket.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I do find it odd, too, that the increasing density of Astoria leads to fewer supermarkets.&nbsp; Perhaps they cannot afford the increased rent that comes with gentrification (for example, Staples can likely pay a lot more in rent than Met Food, which is the supermarket I think used to be there).&nbsp; I still think that Astoria supermarkets can stand some improvement, though.&nbsp; It sounds like Associated is stepping up its game a bit and I hope that it will be successful.&nbsp; I must say, though, that I really liked that store before it changed ownership about 10 years or so ago.

				Has anybody been to the fish counter yet?&nbsp; I&#039;m curious how their prices and quality compare to other places, and I can&#039;t roam the greater-neighborhood to investigate for myself.

				There was also an Associated Foods on 21st St. between 34th &amp; 35th Aves. in the Ravenswood Houses, last I saw it was a NYCHPD Station. I worked there as a kid, maybe 1955-56, as a stock/delivery boy, $1.00/hr + tips, mostly soda &amp; beer bottles for the deposits.

				I went in there and checked out the salad bar.&nbsp; The hot food looks awful.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t eat it.&nbsp; It didn&#039;t look fresh at all.&nbsp; They also have a fancy juice bar.&nbsp; I like the picnic tables they have outside.

				Not sure what supermarket you are referring to. City Fresh (formerly Associated) on 21st Street and Broadway has no picnic tables outside.

				Oh I thought they were talking about Cherry Valley Farms Store on 21st Ave &amp; 21st St.&nbsp; It used to be Associated also
