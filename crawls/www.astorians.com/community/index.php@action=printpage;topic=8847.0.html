				Hey I applied to the Peace Corps and need to have my fingerprints done. I have called the Astoria Precinct a couple of times and so far haven&#039;t gotten a hold of anyone. I was just wondering if anyone has had done this and has any idea when the Astoria Precinct does fingerprinting (or any precinct it doesn&#039;t have to be here). I&#039;m in a crunch because I was bad and procrastinated.&nbsp; :oops: Any information is appreciated. thanks.

				I think if you rob a liquor store (gently, so nobody gets hurt) they will fingerprint you the same night.

				Why don&#039;t they do the fingerprinting themselves? That seems kind of bizarre that you&#039;d have to go somewhere else to get fingerprints done... Of course, maybe I don&#039;t understand the process. Maybe contact a local police station to see if they will do it for you. That would be the most obvious location for fingerprinting in my mind.

				Call the police station to find out when it can be done - explain its for the Peace Corps and they are much more willing to help you out and do it.&nbsp; It should only take a few minutes but be sure they do a good job (smudges will get you back to square 1!).&nbsp; Oh and just in case you have prints on file for another reason (ie, your job, your parents did it when you were a kid, etc....they don&#039;t care and you have to have it done again!).&nbsp; I don&#039;t believe there was a charge when I did it, then again that was in 2000. FYI - I was a PC Volunteer and had a great experience, you can PM me if you want more info.&nbsp; Good luck!
