				We have been incredibly lucky to have Patrenda taking care of our twins for the past 15 months. Patrenda is a warm, loving, caring mother of two who has been a fantastic caregiver to our children. She teaches them, plays with them, and is incredibly patient with all of us. She has never missed a day of work, and is flexible with our schedules. She uses the time when the kiddos are sleeping to do laundry, clean, and cook. I have never worried about whether Patrenda will do the right thing for our children, nor whether she will arrive in the morning. Prior to working with us, she worked for another local family who moved, and they were equally happy with her. For several reasons unrelated to Patrenda, we are starting our toddlers in a daycare program now that they are turning 2. Please contact me at 516-641-3188 or Patrenda directly at 347-647-1903 if you are interested. I can also give you the number for the mom she previously worked with as an additional reference. She will be available full-time starting September 1st. <br />To give an example of some of Patrenda&#039;s attributes: <br />* Brandon and Elise are eager to see her each morning<br />* She gets Brandon, a picky eater, to eat better than we can<br />* Without us asking, she bathes them daily<br />* She teaches them letters and colors <br />* She makes them meals daily, including cooking eggs, rice, etc<br />* She leaves the kids changed and the house spic and span every day<br />* She promotes the kiddos sharing and being nice to each other<br />* Patrenda is flexible if I arrive a few minutes late<br />* I look forward to chatting with Patrenda every night when I get home <br />* She alerts us when we are running low on supplies<br />* She takes B&amp;E to parks, around the neighborhood, and outside in the yard daily<br />Thanks in advance, Lauren (mom to Brandon and Elise, almost 2)
