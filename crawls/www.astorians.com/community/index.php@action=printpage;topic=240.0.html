				Howdy,<br /><br />I know it's possible and not entirely insane to bike to Manhattan during rush hour. However, I also fear that if I just up and tried it one day, I'd end up getting lost in Queens, getting run over, or worse, taking the wrong bridge and ending up in Staten Island.<br /><br />I also know it's partially insane to attempt this for the first time in January....but I'm getting dreadfully out of shape, and I don't have a big pile of cash to give a gym for the privelige of cycling in place. (Whereas, when I crash my bike, I only have the $15 insurance co-pay.)<br /><br />Does anyone do this, or know anyone who does this, who wouldn't mind helping me plan out a route or possibly letting me tag along some morning? I work in Herald Sq, but could use any advice that puts me in Midtown reasonably intact.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Marc

				Yup! Nice time of year to decide to bike to Manhattan, good luck. The problem I've always had is what do you do with your bike when you get there.......you should at least be able to shiver off a few pounds.<br /><br />Take a look at this website, maybe it will help...wear a helmet and a whistle.<br /><br />www.transalt.org

				i used to ride into the city pretty often, but not during rush hour. the easiest way is to head straight down crescent street, all the way to the base of the queensboro bridge. once you hit it, you'll see pretty much straight ahead the bike entrance. the bike route over the bridge has a beautiful view, but i'm not sure how much fun it would be after dark or in the freezing cold. any questions, feel free to ask. good luck!
