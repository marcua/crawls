				Amen. It is truly annoying to have to mute the tv or lower the volume, and raise it again when the program I was watching comes back on. Maybe this will force the FCC to get of its laurels and finally do something.

				I&#039;m totally in support of this. <br /><br />FTA (http://blog.washingtonpost.com/posttech/2008/06/bringing_down_the_volume_of_lo.html?nav=rss_blog):<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Ever get sick of those commercials that seem to be a lot louder than the show you&#039;re watching?<br /><br />Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss) sympathizes with you.<br /><br />The senator yesterday introduced legislation that would require the Federal Communications Commission to bar commercials from being broadcast at louder volumes than the program material they accompany. It&#039;s called the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act, or CALM Act.<br /><br />&quot;Excessively loud television commercials are annoying and drive families away from quality programming,&quot; Wicker said in a news release. &quot;This bill is a common sense approach to a problem that plagues individuals across the nation and will create a more enjoyable television experience. As a member of the Commerce Committee, I look forward to working with my colleagues to make this legislation a reality.&quot;<br /><br />The bill has companion legislation introduced in the House by Rep. Anna Eschoo (D-CA).</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Does anyone know, how does this legislation propose to measure &quot;volume?&quot;&nbsp; A number of factors contribute to the perception of loudness, and it would be very difficult to come up with an objective 1-dimensional measurement that would say &quot;this is louder than that.&quot;<br /><br />If somebody did, a better use of the technology might be a commercial detector/muter: it would make loud commercial ineffective, and they&#039;d become rare. (Of course, there would be a time during which tv broadcasters would sue the makers of such stuff, and threaten and sue their own customers, but eventually they&#039;d have to live with it.)<br /><br />On the political side, I take the position that it&#039;s a misuse of legislative authority, and a waste of lawmakers time, to try to make commercial television marginally less annoying. If it were a real problem, there wouldn&#039;t be an audience to suffer.<br /><br />&quot;Doctor it hurts when I spend most of my waking hours with the television on...&quot;
