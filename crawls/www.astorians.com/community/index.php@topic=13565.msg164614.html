								<div class="inner" id="msg_164241">If you continue to look in Astoria, check out the east side of Steinway St (if you haven&#039;t already) south of Astoria Blvd.&nbsp; Rents are generally somewhat cheaper and it might feel a bit out of the way... but it&#039;s worth it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived in a couple of places that were closer to stops on the R/V line (Steinway St &amp; 46th St) but were still close enough to use the N/W when coming home from Manhattan and wanting to shop for dinner on 30th Ave.&nbsp; There&#039;s also the added bonus that when one train line isn&#039;t working you can easily get to the other line.&nbsp; <br /><br />If I was going to settle for a place that was a haul from the train I&#039;d make sure I was spitting distance to Astoria Park.&nbsp; I think that&#039;s a decent trade. <br /><br />It&#039;s a bummer that Astoria landlords are living in 2007 - but also a bummer that people are moving in and paying these ridiculous prices!!!<br /><br />Good luck with the hunt.&nbsp; </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_164256">The Steinway Street bus (the Q101) is actually pretty ok. It runs every 10-15 minutes during the morning/evening rush, every 15ish minutes outside of that during the week. Once every half hour on weekends, and once an hour late nights. Schedule <a href="http://mta.info/busco/schedules/q101cur.pdf" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">here</a> (pdf file).<br /><br />I know once every 20-30 minutes sounds like a long time, but if you know generally when you need to be at the bus stop, it&#039;s better than getting to the subway platform as a train pulls out of the station and having to wait for the next one.<br /><br />It never, ever, ever runs every 5 minutes. She was mistaken, or lying.<br /><br />BUT. I will say that it&#039;s very reliable (going southbound), and it&#039;s nice to have when I don&#039;t feel like walking to the N, since I live on Steinway. I can take it south to the R/V Broadway stop. The only time it didn&#039;t come when I was expecting it was during a snowstorm at 8pm on a Saturday evening. If you&#039;re going north, it&#039;s not as reliable since it has to come over the Queensboro Bridge, and there&#039;s frequently traffic. Northbound, I&#039;ll see no bus for over an hour, then a few back-to-back.<br /><br />(Also for current Astorians, if you&#039;re coming home from the city on a weekend night and have Q101 Queens-bound schedule in the back of your head, it&#039;s easy and SUPER quick to take the 101 from 2nd ave &amp; 58th. Screw those $25 cab rides! :) ) And if you miss it, you&#039;re right by the bridge, so the cab ride would also be on the cheap side/quick.)</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_164582">Here&#039;s my latest update:<br /><br />For the past couple of days I&#039;ve been looking for apartments exclusively in the Upper East Side, Manhattan.&nbsp; There are a ton of deals floating around.&nbsp; In fact, the deals are so good that people in other parts of Manhattan are voluntarily breaking their current lease to snatch up the massive price drops.&nbsp; Listings that easily were $2,500 a couple of months ago are now going for $1,900 with some wiggle room to bargain.&nbsp; In fact, my friends tell me that most of their friends who currently reside in Astoria are moving into Manhattan due to the rental market crash.&nbsp; It seems like quite a few people are really trying to capitalize on this opportunity to get into the city.<br /><br />That being said, I&#039;ve actually found something in the UES that I like.&nbsp; It is a 3rd floor, large 1 bedroom in the 80s on First Ave.&nbsp; It is roughly 700 sq feet with modern appliances and the entire unit is in pristine condition.&nbsp; The asking price is $1,900 although the broker said that the landlord is flexible and will most likely take $1,800.<br /><br />On the other hand, I&#039;ve also found something I like in Astoria just east of Steinway by Astoria Boulevard.&nbsp; It is a 2nd floor, large 1 bedroom, approximately 700 sq feet with modern appliances and the unit is in very good condition.&nbsp; AND it accepts pets!!!&nbsp; The asking price is $1,575 and the broker said that the landlord probably won&#039;t budge too much on the price.&nbsp; &nbsp;Herein lies my dilemma...<br /><br />Although you would think the UES apartment has a shorter commute to my wife&#039;s workplace, it really isn&#039;t that obvious.&nbsp; You have to walk 3 avenues over to Lexington (8~10 mins), take the train down to 51st Street (3~10 mins, depending on the wait), walk and switch to the N/W/R (3~10 mins, depending on the wait), and ride for another 4 stops (5~10 mins, depending on the wait).&nbsp; That&#039;s somewhere between 20~40 mins.&nbsp; Waiting for 2 trains can really throw off the commute time, and the 6 train is notoriously packed and slow.<br /><br />Meanwhile, living near Steinway means a solid 10~11 minute walk to the N/W and a 25 minute ride to her workplace.&nbsp; Although the commute at best will take 30~40 minutes, she&#039;ll only need to sit on one train.&nbsp; Because it&#039;s the second stop, it most likely will mean that she can sit as opposed to stand.<br /><br />So the difference is essentially $225 a month to live in UES vs Astoria.&nbsp; Living in UES means the so called &quot;prestige&quot; of being a Manhattaner, which I&#039;m not completely enamored with, and technically a shorter commute when there&#039;s no wait for the multiple trains.&nbsp; Living costs are of concern with Manhattan groceries getting out of control -- a small can of Starkist tuna in my neighborhood now costs $2.50, milk is now $5.69 for the &quot;generic&quot; brand.&nbsp; I have to admit that trading in the shorter commute for the $225/mo I pocket living in Astoria along with my living costs being reduced in half is very enticing.&nbsp; Also, swapping the &quot;yuppinized,&quot; UES restaurants for the authentic and ethnic dining in Astoria makes the choice even more compelling.<br /><br />We shall see...</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_164614">I agree that the N/W train is probably a lot nicer ride compared to the 6 train.&nbsp; By far, the 6 line has always been my most dreaded train for quite some time now.&nbsp; In fact, it is the sole reason why I&#039;ve historically avoided living in the east side of Manhattan for all these years.<br /><br />I think deep down my mind is already made up.&nbsp; I&#039;ve &quot;clocked out&quot; of being a Manhattaner for the past couple of years but have only waited till now to make the move.&nbsp; Last year around this time I was already looking for apartments.&nbsp; At that time, I was seriously considering moving to Sunnyside or Woodside, but the prices were so inflated back then I just couldn&#039;t justify it.&nbsp; I remember looking at a small 2 bedroom in far Woodside for $1,900 and that was a hike to the subway and relying on the notorious 7 train (my other least favorite train).&nbsp; This year was really &quot;Part II&quot; of &quot;Operation Get the Hell out of Manhattan&quot; so I hope I meet some success.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to take a walk on Steinway during the day today.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only seen it at night so far and it&#039;s always been very quiet, so I&#039;d like to see how lively it gets, but also acquaint myself with the laundry/gym/grocery situation there.&nbsp; If all goes well, I hope to report some good news.<br /><br />Also, I wanted to get a chance to report on my Manhattan broker experiences (listed from Best to Worst):<br /><br />Norm at Citi Habitats (Upper East Side) was amazing.&nbsp; Very respectful, quiet, and experienced.&nbsp; I&#039;d definitely love to work with him if I ever get a chance.<br /><br />Stalin at Citi Habitats (Upper East Side) was energetic, helpful, and fun.&nbsp; He also didn&#039;t give me any pressure.<br /><br />Steve at Fleet Realty only showed me one unit, a 5th floor walkup.&nbsp; He&#039;s in really good shape for a 69(!) year old guy who rides his bike to meet his clients.&nbsp; Bravo, Steve!<br /><br />Daniella and Beatrice and Manhattan Connections were respectful and attentive although they ultimately didn&#039;t show me anything that I wanted.&nbsp; In one situation, it got pretty embarrassing.&nbsp; Daniella couldn&#039;t find a building with address she had written down.&nbsp; Somehow, she kept saying that the building had miraculously &quot;disappeared&quot; when in reality she wrote the address down incorrectly.&nbsp; She didn&#039;t have her phone either so she couldn&#039;t confirm it with her office.&nbsp; On the next viewing, she took me to a building where the management company required her to call ahead of time to arrange for the Super to be there.&nbsp; Well, he wasn&#039;t.&nbsp; The sign outside said for brokers not to bother the tenants.&nbsp; She went ahead and rang every tenant&#039;s bell anyway and ended up getting into a shouting match with one of the tenants.&nbsp; They ultimately didn&#039;t let us in, so it was a waste of time and downright embarrassing.<br /><br />Rory at Key New York was an arrogant, conceited 20 year old who took jabs and insulted other brokers at every chance he got.&nbsp; He definitely had a &quot;better than thou&quot; attitude although he was helpful in getting his 19 year old assistant to show some units (all not what I was looking for).&nbsp; In every way, I could not believe my ears at just how arrogant a 20 year old could be.&nbsp; He asked me what brokers I was working with and I mentioned a couple.&nbsp; He seemed to know one of them and said, &quot;Oh, Linda?&nbsp; Yea, she doesn&#039;t know what she&#039;s talking about but she&#039;s a good kid.&quot;&nbsp; The Linda he was referring to was 35 years old.&nbsp; Rory&#039;s assistant, Angelina (?) was also clueless.&nbsp; We were looking at a unit in Gramercy.&nbsp; After she had finished her spiel about how much she walked the city and knew about real estate and Manhattan, I asked her about the Con Ed plant in the area (Union Squre).&nbsp; She had no clue what I was talking about and said that I must be kidding her.&nbsp; Umm...it&#039;s that really big fenced off complex that takes up a city block that generates power, is always stirring up controversy in the newspaper, and says &quot;Con Ed&quot; all over it.&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty hard to miss if only because it&#039;s a really ugly white building that sticks out like a sore thumb and has security all around it...<br /><br />Sasi at Citi Habitats (Upper West Side) was awful.&nbsp; He showed me a bunch of things I didn&#039;t want and utterly wasted my time trying to show me what he had in inventory regardless of my needs.&nbsp; It was a wild goose chase with no end.&nbsp; I ended up seeing a whole slew of apartments that were way too small for way too much.&nbsp; I&#039;m not even sure if he knew what my criteria was.&nbsp; What shocked the hell out of me was when other brokers had told me that he was a &quot;Top Performer&quot; at his company.&nbsp; I had a chuckle deep down and asked myself if standards had really gotten so low that Manhattaners are so desperate to work with *anyone*.<br /><br />Dave, the other superstar at Citi Habitats had a link to his personal site with all the accolades he won being the &quot;2007 Mann Award Broker of the Year.&quot;&nbsp; I called him about a listing.&nbsp; He told me he&#039;d call back in 30 mins with a viewing time.&nbsp; He never called back.&nbsp; I called him again a couple of hours later.&nbsp; He told me that he wasn&#039;t in the city and that&#039;d he call and arrange as assistant to do the viewing.&nbsp; He never called back.&nbsp; I eventually called him later that night and left a message saying that I was sorely disappointed in him for his terrible follow up.&nbsp; He called the next morning and said he had arranged a viewing that day and that he&#039;d call back and confirm the time.&nbsp; He never called back.&nbsp; I never called him back either.<br /><br />And by far the absolute worst broker was Ashley (male) at Century 21 NY Metro, or &quot;C21&quot; as he liked to call it.&nbsp; Over the phone he told me to go in to see the many listings that he thought would be perfect for me that we could look at that afternoon.&nbsp; I slotted 2 hours for him because he made it sound like he had an entire library of availabilities.&nbsp; I went in, completed the forms, and stepped inside his office.&nbsp; He instantly reminded me of all the slick-talking, SUPER obnoxious, arrogant, completely conceited salesmen of those Fortune 100 companies when they were at their so-called height.&nbsp; He talked down to me, wanted to make sure I wasn&#039;t wasting his time, and asked about why I hadn&#039;t pulled the trigger on the apartments I had seen yet.&nbsp; He said that C21 has 98% of the total listings in Manhattan (which is absolute BS, they&#039;re lucky if they have 40%) and that what I was looking for was impossible.&nbsp; He went through his listings and said that there was nothing in the city that matched my criteria and that I would have to up my price or take off.&nbsp; I listed a couple that I found and told him to re-search.&nbsp; He eventually found one listing that matched my criteria and arranged for a viewing the next day.&nbsp; I told him to forget it and thanked him for wasting my time.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think I worked with a total of 15 brokers in Manhattan.&nbsp; A lot didn&#039;t make this list because they weren&#039;t memorable or didn&#039;t have anything that I wanted but were OK.&nbsp; What has become obvious to me is that the barrier to become a licensed real estate broker/agent is so embarrassingly low that a lot of under-qualified people are giving the true brokers a really bad reputation if only by stereotype.&nbsp; Some brokers have been excellent but the vast majority are underwhelming at best, a nightmare to work with at worst.&nbsp; What&#039;s obvious is that the market has boomed for so long that a lot of people try and get into the action to turn a quick buck when in reality they should be doing something else with their time and not wasting the time of their clients.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=13565.msg164607.html#msg164607">Quote from: lanseaux on January 21, 2009, 10:02:06 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I have close friends who have lived in the 80s by 1st Ave (variously 81st, 82nd, 83rd and 84th Sts.) since the mid-90&#039;s, so I have made that trek many, many times.&nbsp;

I saw in your other post that you were putting 2BRs over 750sqft in Astoria at over $2000. That&#039;s way too much for any 2BR that&#039;s not extremely large and newly renovated. Are you using local neighborhood brokers or city-wide places? Craigslist?<br /><br />EDIT: I just saw the post where you listed the brokers you&#039;re using. I still say those prices are way inflated. Keep trying new brokers. </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_164711">Also, while I do love Astoria, if the dog is turning out to be that much of a deal-breaker and you&#039;re really not thrilled with any of the apartments you&#039;ve seen, take a look at Inwood. There are some cute areas near beautiful parks, and the apartments are huge for Manhattan, as well as generally being more lenient about pets than Astoria. Also, the A train to midtown only takes about 25 minutes and offers an easy transfer to the D if that helps. Check out <a href="http://www.moresquarefeet.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.moresquarefeet.com</a> and get in touch with Erin if you&#039;re interested. </div>

What&#039;s funny is that it looks much bigger based on first impression.&nbsp; I had sworn it was near 650 sq feet the first time I saw it.&nbsp; It&#039;s actually a very nice unit although I do wish it was bigger.&nbsp; The bedroom ends up being the casualty here as it is big enough for my bed and dresser, but probably won&#039;t be able to hold a good amount of my bedroom furniture.&nbsp; I&#039;ll likely be selling my nightstands and other furniture in the very near future.<br /><br />The price is spot on and even fell under my budget.&nbsp; The original listing price was $1,700 with a one months broker fee but I&#039;m a pretty tough negotiator (that was my profession for many years at a Fortune 100) and eventually lowered the price.&nbsp; I&#039;m not going to post the final broker fee amount because I feel really bad for them.&nbsp; I think they do deserve the one month&#039;s fee for all the work they did and don&#039;t want anyone else trying to take advantage of them the way I did.&nbsp; Note about broker fee: it was a very low number and they proved to be very flexible with me (in fact, the broker went on record as saying that they had never done a broker fee that low before).<br /><br />About the broker:<br /><br />I rented through Jenna at Astoria Apartments Realty.&nbsp; She actually is quite a good broker: helpful, hardworking, really nice and friendly.&nbsp; She talks a bit much and a little too fast for my taste, but she came through in the clutch, showed me more qualified listings than any other broker (by a lot), and is someone I really enjoyed working with.&nbsp; In fact, she worked so hard that in the end when I was negotiating down the broker fee, I actually felt bad because I really thought she had earned her money.&nbsp; My hard-lined negotiating was definitely giving her and her boss heartburn and I could see it on their faces.<br /><br />I highly highly recommend her.&nbsp; She quickly became my favorite broker because she was honest, extremely hard working, and never ever gave up on finding a unit for me.&nbsp; And I really appreciated that last fact.<br /><br />Other brokers I recommend:<br /><br />Kim at Halvatzis was very good the first day but I never heard from her again from Day 2 on.&nbsp; So although she was great and made a great first impression, she definitely has to improve her follow up skills.&nbsp; That being said, she did show me a few units that I was interested in.&nbsp; I&#039;d recommend her although I&#039;ll also recommend that you follow up with her instead of the other way around.<br /><br />Jenny at Avanguard was also decent.&nbsp; Her biggest problem is that she&#039;s emotional and tells quite a few white lies to get you to sign through her.&nbsp; She comes across as a little &quot;car salesy&quot; -- specifically telling you how bad her competitor&#039;s listings are...then she&#039;ll go around and end up showing you the exact same listing this time telling you how good they are (as long as she shows them to you).&nbsp; Overall though, she showed me quite a few good, qualified listings.&nbsp; She worked very hard and had tremendous follow up, almost too good as a matter of fact (I swear she was stalking me sometimes).<br /><br />Brokers to avoid:<br /><br />Eleni Moustakis and/or Carl Nieto.&nbsp; I actually went on a rant about Carl in an earlier post.&nbsp; The reality is that because Eleni has chosen to partner with Carl, the quality of service you receive is a clear downgrade, well below average.&nbsp; Eleni herself is a bit scatterbrained and relies on Carl to do the negotiating.&nbsp; And therein lies the rub.&nbsp; He is the worst negotiator and has a fundamental lack of respect for his clients.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather burn my money in front of his face than pay him a broker&#039;s fee, even if he found me the Taj Mahal at $100.<br /><br />The rest of the brokers:<br /><br />Most of them had very very poor follow up and/or made very little to no impression whatsoever, which is a bad thing as a salesperson/broker.&nbsp; Only Mike from Astoria Park Realty ever called back to check up on my progress.&nbsp; Kudos to him.<br /><br />I will mention that Julius at Exit had follow up skills.&nbsp; His one problem was that he didn&#039;t have qualified units.&nbsp; He ended up showing me a lot of things that wasted my time, but he was honest, sincere, and tried hard.<br /><br />Other broker-related notes:<br /><br />One measuring stick that I love to use to gauge a broker is to ask them about their own living situation.&nbsp; If they are renting, I want to know that they have a SICK deal.&nbsp; If they themselves are getting ripped off, they&#039;re less likely to find you a good deal.<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br /><br />I&#039;m excited about my new apartment.&nbsp; I feel a little bit awkward but intrigued about living in the &quot;Middle East/North Africa/Egypt&quot; part of Astoria.&nbsp; I can honestly say that I&#039;ve always been curious about these cultures but never thought I&#039;d be living in one at this stage in my life.&nbsp; I wish the walk to the train was closer, but I&#039;ll make do.&nbsp; I also wish RCN or Verizon FIOS serviced my building and will be endlessly pursuing this in the near future.<br /><br />Am I absolutely ecstatic about my apartment?&nbsp; Yes and no.&nbsp; I do love the fact that I&#039;m moving to Astoria.&nbsp; I got the apartment under budget and didn&#039;t have to pay much for it, so I know I got an excellent deal.&nbsp; The unit itself is good, clean, new, and services all of my needs.&nbsp; I met the landlord last night and he seems to be really nice and responsive.&nbsp; AND IT ACCEPTS DOGS!!!!!&nbsp; That being said, the location could be closer to the train and the unit itself could be bigger.&nbsp; But I feel fine with it for now because I reason to myself that at least I&#039;m in Astoria now.&nbsp; The next move I make in Astoria to go after my dream apartment will be so much easier than going from Soho to Astoria every time I want to check out a unit.&nbsp; As long as I&#039;m in the vicinity, my options will open up and I&#039;ll be aware of more deals.<br /><br />I hope you guys have enjoyed this thread and I will be posting from time to time to update and maintain it.&nbsp; You&#039;ll likely see me being a much more active member on other threads now that I&#039;ll officially be an Astorian instead of a wanna-be.&nbsp; &nbsp;:lol:</div>
