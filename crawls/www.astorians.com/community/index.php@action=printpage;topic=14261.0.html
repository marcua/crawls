				My lease is up for renewal this spring and I&#039;m considering asking my landlord to discuss re-negotiating the rent. I&#039;ve been here a year, been a great tenant, always paid on time etc. I live a block south of Ditmars, six blocks east of the train and pay $1400/month for a one bedroom in a small apartment building (eight units). I&#039;ve been shopping around the last two months and notice comparable apartments are now going for $1250-1350 a month. I really have no interest in moving, but obviously these prices are peaking my curiousity. The worst he can say is no, but I was just wondering if anyone else in a similar situation in Astoria has successfully had this chat with their landlord? How did you approach it?

				Oh, I&#039;d definitely try it.&nbsp; As I mentioned in a different thread, my building&#039;s management company is definitely making an effort to retain me because they only raised my rent a fraction of the 4.5% put forth by the Rent Guidelines Board.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, I&#039;m only 1 block from the Broadway train in a decent, well-kept building with a good-sized one bedroom and I pay the lower end of your $1,250 - $1,350 range - granted, I&#039;ve been living there for 3 year now, so rents outside of stabilization have probably increased a bit.

				Unless he&#039;s going to lower your rent out of the goodness of his heart-I just don&#039;t see that happening. Maybe the best you can&nbsp; do is ask him to keep the same amount (lock yourself in for at least a 2 year lease, then)...if you know he&#039;s definitely raising it; do you suspect he might? Otherwise, if he does, maybe you can point out that you&#039;ve seen lower rents for better/bigger spaces-be honest here. Or, if he really insists that it&#039;s going to go up, maybe you can ask for a more efficient appliance-a stove or a fridge. But, you know your own landlord-is he a nice guy that would negotiate or would you be stirring up a can of worms with him? What about a fresh coat of paint, floors, etc...?

				That&#039;s what I&#039;m worried about - but my Manhattanite friends have been able to get $50-100/monthly decreases, I just didn&#039;t know if it had made its way over to Astoria yet. Trying to get a feel for the situation here.<br /><br />This is only my first year here, so I don&#039;t know how he is as far as dealing with lease renewals. I&#039;ve only met him to get my keys; other than that everything is through the management company. I&#039;m concerned about even being able to get him on the phone to have this talk!<br /><br />My apartment building is only about seven years old as a whole, and very well maintained, so everything is still quite nice. Honestly the only thing I can think to have replaced is the screen in my sliding door, which is ripped.

				Glad you started this topic because I&#039;ve been wondering the same thing myself. I just moved to my current location last Aug, have a fantastic credit score (which landlord actually raved about when we met the first time), I have never been late in payment or bounced a check, etc. Overall I&#039;m a good gal to rent to and I think he knows this, which is why I&#039;ve been thinking about this.<br /><br />My lease is up in July so I am hoping that he would be up for keeping the same rent. I probably wouldn&#039;t even bring up the idea of LOWERING it, unless others report on here that they&#039;ve had success in this climate with that! Even $25 a month less would be great. <br /><br />At the same time keep in mind that rents this time of year (from what I&#039;ve seen) are naturally lower than in the summer/late spring anyway, but this is also a way different economic climate that what we&#039;ve seen for quite a while now.<br /><br />Would love to hear anyone else&#039;s thoughts or experience with this.....

				I just received notice last night that my landlord went for the maximum increase permitted by the Rent Guidelines Board.&nbsp; I was shocked!&nbsp; The building is two years-old (one of the newer buildings below Crescent/31st Ave) and I love the apartment (bonus outdoor space!)&nbsp; While I have been able to afford rent over these two years, the added cost of heating the apartment (and the water I use) was pretty crazy this winter.&nbsp; I intend to use the fact that we are paying high heating costs as negotiating tool- Thoughts???&nbsp; I also rent a parking space for $150/month, so I could always give that back to save some money.&nbsp; Unfortunately, while I have been a great tenant, our landlord is relatively unresponsive (and frankly unfriendly).&nbsp; I believe that this is the very first property they have built/managed.

				Ask and if he doesnt lower it , find out if the newer cheaper rents are giving out leases . If they are tell your landlord u will move and maybe even show him the lease agreement with price on it .&nbsp; U have nothing to lose .&nbsp; IF he still doesnt budge , y not move ? u will be saving pretty big in the long run , esp if u can lock in a lower rate .&nbsp; Just make sure the new place wont jack up rents in the future&nbsp; or else theres no point in leaving

				I would check to see if there are available apartments in your building and what they are renting for right now.<br /><br />The reason I say this is that a friend of mine, who lives in a luxury building in the Financial District, just got his lease renewal and the new (unsolicited) proposed rent is actually several hundred dollars less than what they are currently paying.&nbsp; Turns out that due to the economy, comparable apartments in his building are renting for much less so the management company is recognizing this.

				Any landlord who hopes to raise rents in this economy is only bluffing. Rents on average are down 8%, and I think that the number is higher in the boroughs. Look around (but do some serious research, get written offers that you can bring to your landlord) and threaten moving. Sure, the moving cost may cut into the first 3-4 months of savings, but if you can get a nicer or cheaper place, it will be worth it. <br /><br />If it&#039;s that Astoria landlords are missing something about the greater economy, I think they are in for a rude awakening when a lot of leases come up in July/August and people move across the river to the UES.<br /><br />Anecdotally, I had interest in someday taking over my friend&#039;s rent-controlled lease in Chelsea, but it really isn&#039;t that much of a deal&nbsp; now...

				It is against the law to sublet a rent controlled apartment. I should have been more specific and said rent-stabilized, which is completely legal to sublet for a period of two years. Thanks for catching me!

				I TRIED to renegotiate my rent about a month or so ago, after hearing crazy stories of people in Manhattan practically having their landlords begging them to stay.<br /><br />Yeah...no dice. <br /><br />My landlord agreed to not RAISE my rent, but not lower it, not even by $50 a month! He offered to let me check out another apartment for lower in the same building, which was very decent of him, but the other apt. just wasn&#039;t as awesome as my current one&nbsp; :evil:<br /><br />Hey, it can&#039;t hurt to ask, but I have a feeling it&#039;s not as easy as some of the news stories out there make it out to be.

				We&#039;re in the same boat here - the landlord went for the max increase.&nbsp; I was prepared to pay more but not 5% more!&nbsp; I wrote her a letter and offered 2.5% increase but I want a two year lease.&nbsp; We&#039;ll see... we just had a baby 9 months ago and so would prefer not to move.&nbsp; The landlord also just purchased and installed window guards so I don&#039;t think they would want us to leave and eat that expense.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m a landlady and I always tell my tenants:<br /><br />&quot;Don&#039;t worry about asking for repairs, because the rent is going up anyway. Better tell me sooner rather than later.&quot;<br /><br />You see, our taxes go up every year, as do the cost of the electricity for hallways and heating the building and the cost of water. We could be factoring the cost of a new roof, new windows, pointing or other major repairs. <br /><br />It&#039;s more than just about rewarding you for being a good tenant. The bank doesn&#039;t give us a break for paying the mortgage on time!

				I don&#039;t understand. A taxicab owner uses part of the fare to pay for the car. A repairman expects his customers to pay for his tools. I am sure the price of a restaurant meal includes the cost of the silverware and china. Why would anyone expect a landlord to donate a building?

				Very provocative--you must be baiting.<br /><br />Real estate is a business like any other. Expenses must be covered. I guess I go to work because I&#039;m greedy enough to need the groceries.<br /><br />By the way, it is hard to make money in the restaurant business--even you hire illegals.<br /><br />Speaking of greedy, how many petty landlords do you know riding around with cadillacs? Most look careworn beyond their years, dressed in old worn clothes--house is a lot of headache. What I see is the renters turning on the airconditioning, paying for parking, and dropping off their laundry while the landowners are sitting on the steps outside, moving their car to rent the garage and hanging their laundry to save on dryers. Not &#039;cause we want to, &#039;cause we never know what&#039;s going to break next and what it will cost! <br /><br />The CEOs who got us into this economic crisis--now THAT&#039;s greedy.<br /><br />And...by...the way...I haven&#039;t had a vacancy in 5 years. I&#039;m a good landlord, I make repairs, provide good heat and I raise the rent a little bit each year to just below market value. I haven&#039;t had to look for a tenant in ten years, because some friend of the tenant ALWAYS wants the apartment.

				Our landlord isn&#039;t flashy, but that doesn&#039;t mean anything. He&#039;s doing pretty well.<br /><br />The apartment desperately needs new floors, carpets, pipes, windows, outlets, repairs to the ceiling cracks, repaving outside, etc. When you mention any of it to them, they say, &quot;We just had that done,&quot; even if it was a decade ago! Of course, they won&#039;t make improvements until we move out and they need new renters.<br /><br />I can understand why landlords rent out privately; how else could anybody afford property taxes, mortgages etc.??

				When I was a renter I often wondered about that. Why won&#039;t they fix it? Now, as a landlord I hate the responsibility of breaking into someone else&#039;s personal space, waiting for contractors to show up and sit around while they do the work. It is much easier in an empty apartment, you don&#039;t have to worry about someone&#039;s cat getting out, etc. It&#039;s hard to get around to things, too.<br /><br />Ofcourse, we have to fix things like cracks in ceilings.<br /><br />When I was a renter I used to start sentences like,<br /><br />&quot;Ofcourse, I would never do anything like go to landlord/tenant court over this, or withhold rent...I&#039;m just giving you the opportunity to fix it before I hire someone else to do it and take it out of the rent...&quot;<br /><br />Which might be fine with them anyway.

				Just wanted to give an update, I was able to negotiate the increase to 2.5% instead of 4.5%.&nbsp; We had a nice long talk about how bad the economy has been and she said if I thought 2.5% was fair, than she agreed.&nbsp; Also said she wouldn&#039;t raise it next year if the economy is still in the tanker.

				That&#039;s the increases I usually go for with my tenants--my neighbor ALWAYS takes the absolute maximum rent, chops up his big apartments to rent for two smaller ones to get more rent and--has lots of turnover.<br /><br />More rent means roommates (more people) using more water, making more noise, more come-and-go, more garbage and more damage to the apartment as greater turnover means people moving in and out, nailing holes in walls, and less goodwill from your neighbors.<br /><br />That is something to help you in your negotiations with (petty) landlords:<br /><br />They have to balance the lower increase with the cost and hassle of repainting and fixing up the apartment and the possibility of losing a month&#039;s rent until they find another tenant. Ofcourse, I&#039;ve heard some landlords don&#039;t even paint but still...interviewing candidates, dealing with real estate, showing the apartment...leases...keys...returning deposits...<br /><br />..AND they have to factor in that IF you moved out, how much more or less rent would they expect to make it worth it? (That&#039;s where the economy comes in.)<br /><br />...this is where being a good tenant comes in...and what if the new person(s) turned out to be a real pain? Or bring a dozen relatives? Have a baby or get a dog?<br /><br />By the way, as soon as a new tenant moves in, they almost always find a ton of things wrong even if they love the apartment because they&#039;re focusing on it. Once they&#039;ve established themselves, they forget to mention stuff that needs fixing until it really cramps their style. As a landlord, you gotta prepare for that too.<br /><br />It can seem better to some landlords to accept a little less and avoid rocking the boat, if they&#039;ve got a good tenant and their costs are covered.<br />

				I have talked to a couple recently that is getting 50/month offer off of their current rent. My building group is offering some free rent if you find someone to fill an apartment.<br /><br />I think the real deals are in manhattan, though.

				Well,<br /><br />My landlord is wanting to raise my rent nearly 5%, and I pay at market (or above) market for what I get. I tried to make a reasoned plea for a similar 7-9% drop from what we&#039;ve seen since the beginning of the market. No go. I don&#039;t even think my landlord will accept the rent at what it is.

People, ask before you just sign a new lease with an increase. It costs nothing to ask. If you avoid those 2 family houses and are willing to do without a terrace and/or a back yard, you can still find some real bargains here. Landlords learned that you cannot get blood from a stone. When your tenant loses their job, and then their unemployment runs out and they ask to break their lease, whatcha gonna do? Sue &#039;em? Landlords would rather have their apartments occupied than hold out for larger rents.

				Well the original question was if Astorians would have any luck re-negotiating their current rent. Landlords in Astoria would never go for that, Plain and simple.<br />I am not sure if there are any vacancies on the large buildings or the new construction buildings which are not cheap but it always comes down to supply and demand. And there is still a lot of demand; Real Estate offices are calling me more than ever to ask whether I have any apartments available. I am sure they are doing the same to other landlords around the neighborhood. If a tenant asks to lower the rent, all they have to do is call the multiple agencies that call and see whether they can get a better deal. That is the truth everything else is just theoretical.<br />

				Everything is always negotiable.&nbsp; I told me landlord I might be leaving at the end of my lease in August because I wanted a larger place and now seemed liked a good time to find one.&nbsp; He called me back and offered me a 2 year extension with no increase.&nbsp; I pay below market rent in Upper Ditmars right now at $1,150 month for a nice sized one bedroom with a storage room in the basement so I negotiated an even better deal.&nbsp; I got a one year lease with an option to renew for an additional year with no increase in rent for the additional year. This gives me flexibility if I want to leave after one more year.&nbsp; I also got him to refund my security since I have paid my rent on time (usually a week early for the past&nbsp; 3 years).&nbsp; He told me that tenants who pay on time are a blessing.&nbsp; He owns a 6 family home near 23rd avenue and two condos in upper Ditmars and he said many people are late with the rent every month.&nbsp; He said the cost of housing court and trying to collect on a judgement aren&#039;t worth the hassle so he always negotiates with his good tenants.

				Being someone pretty experienced in negotiating with real estate, I find that you can&#039;t ask for a reduction in rent without having any intention of moving out.&nbsp; Otherwise, here&#039;s how the conversation goes:<br /><br />&quot;Can you drop my rent?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;No.&quot;<br /><br />End of story.<br /><br />But, however, if you do do your homework and find apartments that are SIMILAR, good enough that you&#039;d consider moving, then your &quot;threat&quot; to move out becomes real to the landlord.&nbsp; For example:<br /><br />&quot;Can you drop my rent?&nbsp; Otherwise, I&#039;m going to move out ASAP because I found a much better deal with better ________ at the same or lower price.&nbsp; In fact, the only reason I&#039;d consider staying is if you drop my rent.&quot;&nbsp; In this argument, you can cite how the recession is affecting landlords all over Astoria and how they&#039;re ALL willing to drop prices.<br /><br />Then the landlord has to balance whether or not it is worthwhile for him/her to have a vacant apartment collecting no rent vs lowering rent and collecting less per month (understandably during an economic recession).&nbsp; The landlord also has to consider how fast he/she can find a tenant and at what price, and in most cases, perform renovations, improvements, to put the unit back on market.<br /><br />Again, if the threat of leaving is absolutely credible, but you&#039;re willing to work with the landlord to stay if he/she lowers rent, you&#039;ll have a lot of leverage.&nbsp; If your lease is up very soon AND you have credible options to move out to, then you&#039;ll have A LOT of leverage.

				A couple in my building got the landlord to go a year without raisng rent, this was about 3 years ago.&nbsp; From what I understand, it&#039;s&nbsp; a one-year contract/lease, I think it called&nbsp; a favorable lease.&nbsp; Landlord gets to raise rent as usual after the year, adding amount he did not get during year when contract was in effect.&nbsp; <br /><br />As long as someone else is waiting for an apartment, and will pay that they ask, most won&#039;t do it.&nbsp; I&#039;m going by way people are coming and going so quick in my building, and by way vacancies are snatched up so fast.

				I absolutely agree that negotiating a rent when moving in is a different matter.&nbsp; But as stated, my landlord at the previous apartment was willing to budge by as much as $300 a month.&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking that Astoria landlords will also be willing to negotiate, perhaps not as much as $300 a month, but certainly to some degree, whether it&#039;s $25 or $50 a month.

				On the other hand, a landlord might figure it&#039;s better to have you out than to have someone around that always gives them a hard time, especially if they live in the building. Most small landlords also treasure peace and quiet from the hassles as much as possible. That&#039;s why many of them don&#039;t really want to rent to lawyers...
