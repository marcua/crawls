				My father sent me this link to a very interesting and thought provoking short documentary (http://www.badmash.org/videos/videos_flv.php?v=george_bush_512K_Stream) featuring president Bush's speech writer.<br /><br />I'd be very interested in anyone's thoughts on this. I personally think it really challenges the way I view the president. It's only a couple minutes, and well worth the watch.

				it's so bogus. &nbsp;his title is &quot;presidential speechalist&quot;?? &nbsp;His name is Harlan McQueen? &nbsp;<br /><br />but it was interesting because even though it's bogus there's some truth in it. &nbsp;Americans don't seem to like smart, well-spoken leaders. &nbsp;Like girls who always go for the bad guy, the heart of the American voter yearns for a cowboy or a hell's angel to take us into the smoggy sunset.<br /><br />Or so it seems sometimes.

				The Bushisms are certainly real. It looks like the &quot;speechwriter&quot; is comedian Andy Dick.<br /><br />I think Bush is either learning disabled or dyslexic, or maybe even slightly retarded. The man has a staff of speechwriters. He has teleprompters. He's coached on everything he's supposed to say. But we get this mess uttering from his brain time and again. The spin from the White House is that Bush likes to &quot;improvise&quot; and speak &quot;off the cuff&quot; in some sort of folksy way.<br /><br />Baloney.<br /><br />Obviously the man's not an intellectual powerhouse. But I really do think there's something wrong with him upstairs. His circuit board doesn't light up like most folks'.<br /><br />For instance, he's prone not only to malapropisms, but inappropriateness that borders on the bizarre. Definitely creepy. Case in point: his first press conference during the Katrina nightmare, Bush makes some offhand comment about NOLA party life. It went something like, &quot;I know the city I used to enjoy visiting in my youth...&quot; looks over his shoulder, smirks and continues, &quot;maybe a little too much...&quot;<br /><br />Oy vey. I believe there's a psychological term for that kind of behavior. Not sociopath, but something like it, when a person is compelled to make inappropriate jokes and/or comments, that usually put to focus on one's self at the expense of others.

				I don't know if you noticed or not but &quot;Harlan&quot; is an actor - I can't remember his name right off hand, but I have seen him on TV shows, and I am sure movies as well...<br /><br />Even if it isn't real they do use actual footage from Bush's speeches, and that's enough to reinforce the scariness of him being president! &nbsp;:shock: <br /><br />At any rate I found the &quot;documentary&quot; to be very hilarious.
