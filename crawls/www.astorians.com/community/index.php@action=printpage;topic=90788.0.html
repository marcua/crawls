				<br />I recommend we all start writing to Costa C., Melinda Katz, Grubhub, Seamless, the DoT, etc. about the food delivery guy problem.<br /><br />I mean, most of us use them.&nbsp; And I for one totally appreciate the work they do.&nbsp; It&#039;s difficult.&nbsp; It&#039;s dangerous.&nbsp; Not to mention some folks still expect them to deliver in torrential rain/blizzard conditions.&nbsp; They work for every penny.&nbsp; I get it, really I do.&nbsp; And I always tip them very well.<br /><br />However....<br /><br />That does not change the fact that far too many of them break traffic laws.&nbsp; And now they even have E-bikes, which not only go faster, but have virtually SILENT motors.&nbsp; So you don&#039;t even hear them coming!<br /><br />Tonight, walking home in the dark, the very same food delivery guy went through two different red lights (as I was crossing!), during different points of my walk home from the market.&nbsp; This guy had NO LIGHTS on his bike, so I hardly noticed him, and by the time I wanted to yell...well, of course he was long gone.<br /><br />This has got to stop.&nbsp; I hold Seamless, Grubhub, the DoT and all restaurants with takeout, responsible.&nbsp; Oh sure, their official policies are &#039;all our drivers are told they must obey all traffic laws&#039;.&nbsp; But clearly these guys understand that there are no repercussions.&nbsp; I&#039;d be shocked if there haven&#039;t already been accidents involving pedestrians and food delivery guys.<br /><br />99% of these guys have no identifying info on themselves or their bikes, or if there IS a license or a sign, it&#039;s illegible.<br /><br />With rampant development in Astoria, and the ensuing hipsters living in their new &#039;luxury apartments&#039;, the demand for takeout will only increase, and with that, more food delivery guys on the streets.<br /><br />We need to tackle this problem before someone gets killed.
