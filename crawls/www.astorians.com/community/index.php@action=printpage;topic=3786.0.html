				There may be no point in asking this question.&nbsp; In addition, this is going to come across as very very snobby, so I apologize in advance&nbsp; :wink:<br />Does anybody know if there&#39;s a place in Astoria that sells good smoked fish (and knows how to cut it properly, in the case of smoked salmon)?&nbsp; I&#39;m warning you that I&#39;m sort of a maven (translation: complete snob) when it comes to this particular thing, so don&#39;t send me to Brooklyn Bagels or something unless you think it can stand up to Zabar&#39;s (well, perhaps I&#39;m being a bit too ambitious there, but you get the point).&nbsp; I tried some of the oil-cured herring at one of the Greek stores- not what I&#39;m looking for.&nbsp; I just don&#39;t want to have to constantly make a shlep to the Upper East Side to get my appetizing on....<br />I&#39;m trying not to be an obnoxious foodie, but it&#39;s not working...<br />bennyt

				This is what you have to do:<br /><br />On Fridays between 8am and 1pm, you have to go to the warehouse of the Acme Smoked Fish Company - that&#39;s right, the folks who make most of the lox, etc. that you see in the supermarkets, and also the company that smokes the house brand for places like Zabar&#39;s.&nbsp; You can get it whole or sliced, although I recommend the whole.<br /><br />The texture and taste is like <em>nothing</em> I have ever experienced.Â  I guarantee it is <em>better</em> than Zabar&#39;s.<br /><br />Here (http://www.acmesmokedfish.com/retail/fridays.html) are the details.&nbsp; Take the Pulaski Bridge into Greenpoint, go straight on McGuinness to Meserole, turn right on Meserole, and they are at the end of Meserole on Gem St.

				Now that the weather is about to turn colder, I&#39;ll feel safer about schlepping smoked fish back from the UWS.<br /><br />It&#39;s frustratingly difficult to find anything other than thickly sliced nova lox except in specialty stores. &nbsp;Man, in the &#39;60s/&#39;70s/&#39;80s in Philly a deli was a DELI, and they all had a good selection of smoked fish. &nbsp;I expected NYC to be even more like that, but no. &nbsp;Key Food on 30th did throw us a bone at the holidays and stocked some whitefish, but it wasn&#39;t good whitefish. &nbsp;And just TRY to find salty lox. &nbsp;ANYWHERE. &nbsp;I like to mix salty and nova but forget it. &nbsp;Where&#39;s my sable, chicken carp, greasy kippered salmon? &nbsp;Of course not in Astoria, but hard to find even in Manhattan.

				Id love to go to Acme next week if im off work.&nbsp; Russ and daughters on Houston by Ludlow is always a favorite.

				I love Acme. I make the schlep about twice a year. Most appetizing freezes beautifully. Their pickled lox in cream sauce is to die for. When I get it home, I add a large, sliced onion and let it sit in the ice box for a few days to marinate. I also like getting my lox unsliced. I have this flexible, very thin fish knife and I prefer doing the slicing the way I like it! <br /><br />When I was a little girl, growing up in Astoria, we had an appetizing store on 30th Avenue between 35th and 36th Streets. I can vividly recall the Acme&#39;s horse-drawn wagon parked out front making deliveries. (BTW, there used to be a Glatt Kosher deli on the corner of 36th Street and 30th Avenue, where Frank&#39;s Bakery is now. They were the first business in the neighborhood to deliver.) <br /><br />Acme used to be the best kept secret in Jewish New York. Now they are on the internet! Wow!<br /><br />I also go to Flaum&#39;s on Lee Avenue in Williamsburg for some appetizing when I can&#39;t make a Friday morning at Acme.<br /><br />As for Russ and Daughters, I love them too. But you *need* to bring your stocks and bonds to shop there. I used to make them a regular stop when I would go to the LES to Guss&#39;s Pickles and Kossar (who make the very best bialys in the whole world). <br /><br />Should I post when I am making my next Acme schlep and take some of you with me?

				I think its time for cary to have an initiation day.<br /><br />1. lower east side for pickles and bialy&#39;s<br />2. Katz&#39;s for a proper meat sandwich <br />3. Russ and daughters for a tasting of fish dishes and maybe chopped liver.<br /><br />Cary, you really need to experience the smoked fish and herring thing. Just reading about it may be a turn off. &nbsp;Also these 3 trips should be separate, doing all three at once is forbidden under the Geneva convention as torture by overeating. <br /><br />NYCmacuser, I didnt realize you grew up in pre auto NY.

Okay, I&#39;ll have a half pastrami, half corned beef and top it off with a nice scoop of chopped liver, gotta have cole slaw and french fries, too, and of course an iced cold Pepsi. Then we head over to Grand Street and buy some designer sheets. I really *need* more sheets, especially those 1500 thread count ones. I simply never seem to have enough. Typically, this type of shopping makes me very hungry, so now would be a good time to back track to Houston Street to visit Russ and Daughters and do our fish tasting. While there it would be a shame not to spend a couple extra hundred bucks on some stuff to take home. After all, I gotta have something for the Lipitor to work on. Then around the block back to Orchard to Guss&#39; to pick up the pickles to go with the braised short ribs I&#39;ll be cooking for my dinner guests. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=3786.msg37692.html#msg37692">Quote from: Jonathan on October 14, 2006, 11:25:46 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">NYCmacuser, I didn&#39;t realize you grew up in pre auto NY.

				Well, I couldn&#39;t get it together to make the trek to Acme this morning.&nbsp; I needs to happen soon, though.&nbsp; Perhaps the third or fourth Friday in November?&nbsp; But at any rate, I was still the appetizing MAN this morning, going back to my old stomping grounds on the UES and hitting up Agata and Valentina.&nbsp; Irish smoked salmon ($32 a pound!!!), whitefish salad (the best I&#39;ve ever had- it&#39;s not the spread kind, it&#39;s big chunks of fish with red onions and only the faintest touch of mayonnaise), chopped herring salad (the sweet kind, with apples), and mixed olives.
