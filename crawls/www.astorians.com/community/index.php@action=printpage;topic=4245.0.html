				A good friend of mine just passed this onto me. As much as i would love to help, i already have 2 little ones and just don&#39;t have the space at the moment. Does anyone here have a little extra room in their apts or in their hearts? Pass it on as i would love for these little guys to have a warm holiday season!<br />&nbsp;:cry:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Please consider helping this woman find homes for these cats:<br />&quot;I am in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. My 78 yr old neighbor had a severe stroke on 10/31 and will not return home.&nbsp; She has no family.&nbsp; Her boyfriend visits once a week and is discarding things from the apartment. He wanted to throw the cats in the street. I talked him into leaving them there and letting me care for them, and told him I would try to find homes for them. Once the apartment is no longer legally hers, he will dump the furniture and the cats in the street. I have made every effort to place them with people in this building and elsewhere but no one has responded. Although I have been going next door 8-10 times a day, the cats are depressed and stressed out because they miss the constant human companionship that they are used to. When I enter and leave the apartment, they cling to me and cry.<br /><br />There are 5 cats. The momma cat is about 4 years old. Her babies are about 3 years old. All are healthy, well behaved, and extremely friendly. Description follows:<br /><br />BLACK FEMALE&nbsp; -- thin, friendly, but timid until she warms up to you.<br />BLACK AND WHITE FEMALE&nbsp; -- very friendly and talkative. Adorable with unusual harlequin markings.<br />GREY TABBY FEMALE --very friendly. Likes to jump up in your lap. <br />GREY/RUST TABBY FEMALE -- the momma cat. Quiet but friendly. Loves to play with her toys.<br />ORANGE MALE --&nbsp; Pumpkin is huge with large golden almond eyes and purrs constantly. Likes to be held and wants to be at your side. He is a dream of a cat. Very sweet and affectionate.<br /><br />Can anyone give these cats a second chance? They do not have to remain together and can be adopted individually.&nbsp; I do not want these cats to end up in the street or at the CACC where they will be euthanized.&nbsp; I will provide the initial food, litter box, and any assistance that might be needed. Thank you so very much for anything you can do.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;CONTACT: Diane<br />EMAIL:&nbsp; diabella@aol.com </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />i&#39;ll help with transportation if anyone needs it!
