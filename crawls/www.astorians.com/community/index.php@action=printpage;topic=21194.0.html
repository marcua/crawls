				Hello everyone!&nbsp; My boyfriend and I just moved here from Florida.&nbsp; I am part of Teach For America and he is going to law school.&nbsp; We have friends in Astoria and fell in love with the neighborhood.&nbsp; We have spent several long days searching for the right apartment with no luck.&nbsp; The realtor fee here is incredibly high so we have tried to avoid using them but craigslist has been little help. <br /><br /><br />So, we are looking for a large 1 or 2 bedroom place near the E Steinway stop or Queens Plaza stop.&nbsp; We have no pets or children, are very quiet and travel a lot.&nbsp; Our strict budget is $1500 for something amazing.&nbsp; If anyone knows of anything available please please let me know.&nbsp; You have no idea how much we would appreciate it!&nbsp; Thanks for reading!<br /><br /><br />Jennifer<br />jennyy04@gmail.com

				I don&#039;t have any leads for you, but you should know that the E only stops at Steinway late nights (12am-5am). You could take the local (R or M on weekdays) to either Queens Plaza or Roosevelt and get the E there (you didn&#039;t mention which direction you were traveling). If you&#039;re heading toward the city during rush hour, getting the E at Queens Plaza is...challenging. It gets really, REALLY packed.
