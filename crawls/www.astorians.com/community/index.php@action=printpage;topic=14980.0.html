				The other night I tried a brand new bar called Dutch Kills Bar, down on Jackson Ave near Court Square. It&#039;s an absolutely beautiful bar with classic cocktails and is definitely worth the trip if you&#039;re a fan of the cocktail.<br />I had the Astoria Martini (Plymouth Gin, dry Vermouth, Orange Bitters) and the Pisco Sour (Pisco, lemon/lime, bitters, frothy egg white) and both were amazing. I think they were $12 each - pricey but worth it.<br /><br />It&#039;s a strange location, but it would be cool if they made it. The owners used to run Milk &amp; Honey on the LES, if that tells you anything. The back room has 2 pianos and I believe they have live music on weekends.<br /><br />here is their website: http://www.dutchkillsbar.com/<br /><br />and more info is here: http://gothamist.com/2009/02/10/dutch_kills_bar_poised_to_finally_o.php<br />http://eater.com/tags/sasha-petraske

				Great place!&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried their other Astoria drink or maybe it was called Steinway something or other.&nbsp; Great and strong.&nbsp; I think it was $9.&nbsp; Thye also have Grolsch (sp?) beer, which is a rare find for me in Queens.&nbsp; Nice place and a great addition to LIC?Astoria.<br /><br />Between Wunderbar, Dutch Kills, Studio Square and the soon-to-be0opened hotel Ravel rooftop bar, western Queens is getting it&#039;s drink on!&nbsp; :)

				I haven&#039;t been there yet, but just to be clear, this is a major opening and finally introduces a world class cocktail bar to Queens (potentially as good as the best places in Manhattan). I just wish the location were a little more accessible to Astorians.

				My Mom stayed at Ravel when she came up to visit last (she moved to DC) and it was a great hotel. I&#039;d totally recommend it and we went up to the roof and saw the roof bar and it is awesome. Views couldn&#039;t be better, nice sound system, very Miami Beach. I&#039;m excited for that to open.

				I love this place! Went for the first time on Friday. Really cute, has a &#039;20s speakeasy vibe. It&#039;s annoying when the guy stands outside and says &quot;We&#039;re filled to capacity&quot; but the wait is generally short.<br /><br />They have really interesting, unusual cocktails. I wasn&#039;t sure what to get so the bartender made me a berry mix. Was yummy and full of gin, kept me going for a while.

				True. Dutch Kills its fantastic.<br />The ice gives a vibe of the 20&#039;s.<br />I like the crowd and the drinks are spot on. Soave and classy.<br /><br />The perfect place to start a date.<br /><br /><br />

				I seem to be in the minority that isn&#039;t a huge fan of this place.&nbsp; We went on a Saturday night, there were no tables, so we went to the bar, where I stood, trying to get the attention of a bartender for 20 minutes, at which point I got two well mixed but expensive drinks.&nbsp; The whole time I got a really pretentious vibe from the place, and just didn&#039;t feel particularly comfortable the whole time we were there.&nbsp; It&#039;s not someplace I can really ever see myself going back to, simply because I can&#039;t get past the schticky, over-priced, over-pretentious, faux speakeasy thing they&#039;re doing.
