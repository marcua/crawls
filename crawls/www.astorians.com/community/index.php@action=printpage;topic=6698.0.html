				Good question.&nbsp; I&#039;ll make a sign on folded paper named &quot;Astorians&quot; and put it on a table.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll be the biggest group in there, but I&#039;m loath to have everyone wearing name tags.&nbsp; I&#039;ll scout the place later this week and provide more info.

				I can&#039;t make the date - June is Gay Pride month and has too many events, but I hope to make the next one.<br /><br />I do think name tags are always helpful - especially if you have Astorians.com screen name and real name both on there - it makes it readily apparent who is with Astorians.com and you get to put faces with names and avatars.&nbsp; <br /><br />I went to an Emory alumni event last week and even though I was in the bar for 40 minutes, could not find any other Emory folks, though I met a few non-alums - name tags help make sure folks find each other.

				It is NOT a singles mixer.&nbsp; The last topic was confusing, that&#039;s why I started a new one.&nbsp; There doesn&#039;t appear to be enough singles on Astorians to warrant one.&nbsp; We haven&#039;t had a regular Astorians event in a long time, and I thought we should start them back up again in some form.&nbsp; And as far as hooking up, well, let that happen naturally and the pieces will fall where they may.&nbsp; But it&#039;s an inclusive event for us all to meet up, single or not :)

				Handyman, you responded to an older topic that was talking about a singles mixer.&nbsp; A new topic for a regular Astorian&#039;s mixer was started, after it was decided there isn&#039;t enough interest in having a singles event.&nbsp; So it&#039;s not a singles event any longer, but rather a gathering of Astorians for all of us to meet and say hello.&nbsp; If I could delete or lock that old topic I would, because it is confusing.&nbsp; Sorry to miss you this Wednesday, but enjoy your John McClane!

				I concur--nice meeting everyone last night! It was worth getting a bit wet on the way home...<br /><br />Newell, thanks for the list--I would add that the cart under the N on 31st St. and 31st Ave. is in the running for &quot;best souvlaki&quot;. I guess it has to be good, to survive in such an odd location.

				Stini Yamas was a great place for our mixer, and when the kitchen finally opens it will be even better.&nbsp; They want us to come back.&nbsp; But yes, another mixer will be held either at Stini&#039;s or elsewhere, perhaps next month or August sometime.&nbsp; Let&#039;s try not to go so long again without one!&nbsp; Glad to know you all had a great time!
