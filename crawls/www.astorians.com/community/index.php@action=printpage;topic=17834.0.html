				A few minutes ago, I could see about a dozen police cars on 32nd and 33rd streets moving towards 31st Ave.&nbsp; There were also cops running on foot.&nbsp; Then, the police cars reversed course and started headings towards Broadway.&nbsp; The cops on foot started running towards Broadway, too.&nbsp; And I think I can hear a chopper overhead.&nbsp; Anyone with a better view to the action have an idea of what is going on?&nbsp; I assume they&#039;re looking for someone.&nbsp; Nothing on Gothamist Crime Lab as of yet.

				i was actually listening to my scanner this morning when that happened, sounded like either a bank robbery or theft from a store.&nbsp; they mentioned the &quot;dye pack exploded on him.&quot; there were also reports of a commercial alarm and another call from somewhere between 31st and 33rd on broadway, i forgot the address mentioned, but i think there&#039;s a few banks right around there.&nbsp; then there was an officer chasing someone north on 33rd st before they reported they had him in custody and called off additional support.

				This morning I was running late for work and I saw about 25 patrol cars in a convoy going down 35th Street towards Astoria Blvd. They all had their sirens and lights on. They were no accompanying any dignitaries and none of the cars had anyone in the back. I assume they were heading to the police precinct. Not sure what it was all about.

				This morning on the way to work, one of those cops-on-parade demonstrations was going east on Astoria Blvd. Something like two dozen police cars driving with their lights flashing, minimal sirens luckily. <br /><br />Really irks me: Supposedly, it&#039;s a way of making people think, Oh good, they&#039;re driving around, I feel safe. But it really has the opposite effect, as in, WTF is going ON around here?!! Last time most people have seen THAT MANY police cars going someplace at once, it was 9/11. It&#039;s like the gov&#039;t just wants to keep people on edge constantly.&nbsp; :x
