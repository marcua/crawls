				I&#039;ve leafed through some of the other NYSC topics, but to no avail. Maybe someone that frequents this gym can help.<br /><br />I was wondering for those of you that work out there after work (say between 6 and 8pm), how bad the crowding is, being able to get on machines, waiting for showers etc? I have a passport membership so getting in there isn&#039;t an issue.<br /><br />Currently, Imy &quot;primary&quot; gym if you will, is 51st and Lex. It is very convenient to where I work and the transit options are great, but it gets ungodly crowded during peak times. To the point that if I can&#039;t go somewhat off-peak (late lunch like 2pm or after work 7pm+) I just won&#039;t go, which is clearly a waste of money. So I am in the process of trying to find another location that might not be so bad when I want to go.<br /><br />TIA!

				At that time, I&#039;d say the biggest congestion is at the treadmills. It can be hard sometimes to find an open one (that works, of course). I&#039;ve only used the treadmill there once or twice, though, so I can&#039;t really say how long a standard wait would be. At the very least there don&#039;t appear to be obscene amounts of people in a waiting line.<br /><br />The weight machines seem relatively easy to use, and I&#039;ve never had a problem with the showers. There can be congestion in spots but nothing like midtown.

				agreed - but 6-8 is the busiest time.&nbsp; If you can swing going in the AM, you&#039;d be much better off

				I use this one all the time, mostly right after work, so i&#039;m literally getting there by 5:30. it&#039;s busy, but not as crazy as the other one sounds - i almost always am the only one using whatever weight machine i want (can&#039;t speak to the treadmills... i run outside every chance i get&nbsp; :-D). Those times when i do have to go later, say 7:30 or 8, i feel like it&#039;s much more crowded than at 5:30/6pm. can&#039;t speak to the shower question, tho, since i live close enough that i don&#039;t bother. i do wonder if they&#039;ll ever fix the sauna in the men&#039;s locker room tho... doesn&#039;t seem like a priority since it&#039;s been closed since i joined like 6 months ago... hope that&#039;s helpful

				Another Red Sox fan here living behind enemy lines and I used to be a member there and its pretty busy and the main reason why I stopped going. As I dont use machines or elipticals, that wasnt so much of a big deal, but too many people using the free weights wrong and taking up space that they shouldnt have (i.e. doing curls or bench pressing with the squat racks) and people mindlessly talking on cell phones or bs&#039;ing around.
