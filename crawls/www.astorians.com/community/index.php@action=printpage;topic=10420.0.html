				Elaine1442 - did you like the show?&nbsp; what&#039;d you think of Terminal 5?<br />I got there in the middle of Thao Nguyen and the Get Down Stay Down (and while I like their music, it didn&#039;t sound as good live as I&#039;d imagined).<br />I liked the show, but all the tall folks decided to congregate in front of me towards the middle of Rilo Kiley&#039;s set, which made it hard to see.

				The show was great! &nbsp;I will definitely plan to see them again sometime. &nbsp;I lucked out with a good spot at Terminal 5- I stood right in front of the bar area at the railing so I had a place to lean on and I could see the stage pretty well since it was elevated above the floor level. &nbsp;The accoustics weren&#039;t that bad - except when the 2nd opening act was playing and you could hear all the people talking at the bar. &nbsp;During Rilo Kiley tho it wasn&#039;t a problem. &nbsp;:)

				Have they improved the sound at Terminal 5 at all, or does it still sound like feces?&nbsp; I ask because there is a show there in July I want to see, but if I can&#039;t even hear the bands, well it&#039;s not worth it. <br /><br />Also: MAIDEN JUNE 15, MADISON SQUARE GARDEN!

				The sound isn&#039;t great, though it&#039;s better than Roseland (though what venue isn&#039;t?).&nbsp; It&#039;s not as bad for some acts as it is for others.&nbsp; Thao Nguyen sounded bad through the sound system, but Rilo Kiley sounded decent.&nbsp; Tegan and Sara sounded only ok when I caught them there.

				Not sure what to say about the summerstage concerts. They generally are packed. And if I really want to see someone, I would get there quite early.<br /><br />Thankfully most of the bands can be heard beyond the bleachers.<br /><br />**<br />There&#039;s an ad for R2R that looked interesting. But the tix for Clinton seem difficult to get.<br /><br /><br />River To River: Terence Blanchard<br />Thursday, Aug 07, 2008<br />7:00 p.m.<br />Manhattan <br /><br />&quot;Blanchard is an exceptionally creative composer and trumpeter who works with world music, fusion, and hard bop. He has written a variety of orchestral music and in 2006 won a Grammy award for A Tale of God&#039;s Will, a very personal piece he wrote for Spike Lee&#039;s When the Levees Broke.<br /><br />Tickets are required and space is limited. Two free tickets per person will be distributed at the Castle on a first-come, first-served basis starting at 5:00 p.m. on the day of the show. &quot;<br />

				about free summerstage shows-- it depends on how popular the band is... i remember i went to see coheed and cambria along with aterciopelados and bebe a couple of years ago, coheed apparently was the big draw, and i am glad i got there like 2 hours before the doors were supposed to open (but my friend got there late, and he was still able to get in, i think they shut the doors shortly after that.<br /><br />i went to see Ozomatli at summerstage, the free one, we didnt get there THAT early, i think maybe one hour before doors, and we had no problem getting in, and i dont know if they closed the doors on this one, the opening acts weren&#039;t &#039;popular&#039; but they were really good just the same. that show was amazing.<br /><br />anyway. get there at least one hour before doors, or 2 if you believe it&#039;s a really hot band...

				Desolate. Yes. You want your spidy senses getting to and from there.<br />Go past the autobody warehouse. The Mac computer service place.

				Tried a new venue tonight - Zebulon in Williamsburg.&nbsp; I wanted to like it, but it&#039;s really got bad air circulation and is hot as hades.&nbsp; Great show (Francis and the Lights - they were amazing - as always - http://francisandthelights.com/ ), but it was just not a very enjoyable show overall.&nbsp; I had the misfortune of being next to a pack of early 20somethings with no sense as to personal space (I mean, if you have three feet open behind you, shoving folks into walls and immovable poles really isn&#039;t a kind thing - in fact, it&#039;s downright rude).&nbsp; After I gave up my space for them, they lost interest in the space, then wandered back 20 minutes later and made three other people move around for them.&nbsp; I mean, after the first person says, I&#039;m sorry, do you want my space?&nbsp; Are you trying to merge with me?&nbsp; and everyone around you keeps glaring at you, wouldn&#039;t a person get the message?&nbsp; So very weird - in 20 years of catching shows, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever seen anything that obnoxious (except for maybe folks looking to start fights).

				ahhh...Zebulon. I went there a few years ago to see Hungry March Band... was a good show, but Hungry March fit like 5 people on that stage, and then they were amongst us in the audience... my complaint about Zebulon was that the kids at that show don&#039;t like to use deoderant... hipster kids....<br /><br />I went to a show at a place called Glasslands in Williamsburg-- that&#039;s another place with a strange location.... we were walking for a very long time amongst warehouses, and then, there it was.... <br /><br />Saw Passion Pit on the Rocks Off Cruise ship, trying to get tix for their show at Bowery, also trying to get tix to see Phoenix....

				I&#039;d noticed the deodorant issue as well - but figured it was because we were packed so tightly and it was so hot.&nbsp; I think next time I&#039;m going to get up closer to the front or next to the bathroom entrance - can&#039;t be any more packed than towards the back (if there is a next time - looks like they&#039;re doing lots of live music there!)<br /><br />The Rocks Off Cruise Ships are fun - good times.<br /><br />Haven&#039;t heard of Glasslands - will check it out - I think Bellhouse has to be the most isolated one I&#039;ve come across to date.
