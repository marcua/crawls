				Excerpts from the Goonies:<br /><br /><strong>Chunk</strong>: Everything. OK! I&#039;ll talk! In third grade, I cheated on my history exam. In fourth grade, I stole my uncle Max&#039;s toupee and I glued it on my face when I was Moses in my Hebrew School play. In fifth grade, I knocked my sister Edie down the stairs and I blamed it on the dog... When my mom sent me to the summer camp for fat kids and then they served lunch I got nuts and I pigged out and they kicked me out... But the worst thing I ever done - I mixed a pot of fake puke at home and then I went to this movie theater, hid the puke in my jacket, climbed up to the balcony and then, t-t-then, I made a noise like this: hua-hua-hua-huaaaaaaa - and then I dumped it over the side, all over the people in the audience. And then, this was horrible, all the people started getting sick and throwing up all over each other. I never felt so bad in my entire life. <br /><strong>Jake Fratelli</strong>: I&#039;m beginning to like this kid, Ma! <br /><strong>Mama Fratelli</strong>: [tired of Chunk&#039;s stalling] Hit puree! <br /><br /><br />Classic!! :mrgreen:

Why don&#039;t we just spread chocolate all over the floor and let Chunk eat his way through? <br /><strong>Chunk</strong>: Okay, Mouth. I&#039;ve taken all I can stand... and I can&#039;t stand no more! <br />[Chunk steps towards Mouth, knocks over the cooler, and tries to right it] <br /><strong>Chunk</strong>: I got it! I got it! I got it! <br />[Chunk rights the cooler, but the bottle falls off and breaks] <br /><strong>Chunk</strong>: I don&#039;t got it. <br />Everyone else: You klutz! <br /><strong>Chunk</strong>: Hope it&#039;s not a deposit bottle! <br />

				not so much a quote as it&#039;s a paragraph, but still one of my favorite&#039;s<br /><br />The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller buildings but shorter tempers, wider Freeways , but narrower viewpoints. We spend more, but have less, we buy more, but enjoy less. We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but less time. We have more degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less judgment, more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less wellness. <br /><br />We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom. <br /><br />We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often.<br /><br />We&#039;ve learned how to make a living, but not a life. We&#039;ve added years to life not life to years. We&#039;ve been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet a new neighbor. We conquered outer space but not inner space. We&#039;ve done larger things, but not better things. <br /><br />We&#039;ve cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. We&#039;ve conquered the atom, but not our prejudice. We write more, but learn less. We plan more, but accomplish less. We&#039;ve learned to rush, but not to wait. We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but we communicate less and less. <br /><br />These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and small character, steep profits and shallow relationships. These are the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier houses, but broken homes. These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill. It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and nothing in the stockroom. A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit delete... <br /><br />Remember; spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not going to be around forever.<br /><br />Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe, because that little person soon will grow up and leave your side. <br /><br />Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn&#039;t cost a cent.<br /><br />Remember, to say, &#039;I love you&#039; to your partner and your loved ones, but most of all mean it. A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of you. <br /><br />Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person will not be there again.<br /><br />Give time to love, give time to speak! And give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind.<br /><br />AND ALWAYS REMEMBER: <br /><br />Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t send this to at least 8 people......Who cares?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; George Carlin <br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />

				&quot;There are roughly three New Yorks. There is, first, the New York of the man or woman who was born here, who takes the city for granted and accepts its size and turbulence as natural and inevitable. Second, there is the New York of the commuter—the city that is devoured by locusts each day and spat out each night. Third, there is the New York of the person who was born somewhere else and came to New York in quest of something. Of these three trembling cities the greatest is the last—the city of final destination, the city that is a goal. It is this third city that accounts for New York’s high-strung disposition, its poetical deportment, its dedication to the arts, and its incomparable achievements. Commuters give the city its tidal restlessness; natives give it solidity and continuity; but the settlers give it passion. And whether it is a farmer arriving from Italy to set up a small grocery store in a slum, or a young girl arriving from a small town in Mississippi to escape the indignity of being observed by her neighbors, or a boy arriving from the Corn Belt with a manuscript in his suitcase and a pain in his heart, it makes no difference: each embraces New York with the intense excitement of first love, each absorbs New York with the fresh eyes of an adventurer, each generates heat and light to dwarf the Consolidated Edison Company.&quot;<br />— Here is New York, E.B. White
