				Hi<br />Remember that Key Food on 31st off Ditmars used to be &quot;Astoria Bowl&quot; with the ice rink upstairs?? Way back in the 30s and 40s....That same place was the &quot;Grand Theatre&quot; You could see from 33rd St that it was a huge venue. The Grand closed in the 50s and the Ditmars theatre opened.<br />Now its a post office...go figure.

				I remember seeing Escape From New York at the Strand on Broadway.&nbsp; The Strand was the perfect venue for that movie what with the graffiti on the walls and the usher spraying yard guard before the movie started! <br /><br />Found this photo on flickr: http://www.flickr.com/photos/40045986@N00/3067201854/ (http://www.flickr.com/photos/40045986@N00/3067201854/)

				Can anybody tell us what else was around the Strand in the 40&#039;s?&nbsp; Where did you go to eat on dates?&nbsp; (If this was previously discussed on Astorians, just post the link.)

Towards the end of it&#039;s life punks and hoodlums started taking over the place. I&#039;m pretty sure I remember people being shot in that theater. I also remember that a piece of the marquee fell onto Steinway street once, which was pretty scary because we would always stand under there.<br /><br />
