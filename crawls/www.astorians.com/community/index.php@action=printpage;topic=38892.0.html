				Although good news, I don&#039;t think this addresses the real issue of reliability. Scheduled frequency especially at rush hours is pretty good. However, there are constantly bottlenecks at regular locations and groups of trains followed by long waits. The general operation of the system is the real issue. I question if adding extra trains will change the experience.

				Though I welcome the extra service, after many, many years I&#039;m back commuting to work from Ditmars and I have to say what happened? <br /><br /><br />While I wouldn&#039;t say rush hour service is awful, it certainly isn&#039;t what it used to be. What I remember, it used to be as one train pulled in, another pulled out. <br /><br /><br />Now, almost very day I&#039;m greeted by no trains and a crowd waiting on the platform. It used to be that one could still get a seat at Astoria Boulevard. This is impossible now and the trains are often packed by 30th Avenue.<br /><br /><br />An extra train will help but what I worry about is what will happen when the Second Avenue line opens next year and there&#039;s no more Q train. Supposedly the W might be resurrected, but there&#039;s no definitive plan yet as far as I know.<br /><br />

				I feel service has gotten worse recently.&nbsp; There&#039;s usually a &quot;service gap&quot; where they don&#039;t have a train for a while, i.e. the bottleneck mentioned before where they send two trains in a row to address it.&nbsp; But lately even that isn&#039;t happening.&nbsp; I live on 31st Avenue but now I go to 30th Avenue instead of Broadway just so I can fit on the train instead of being unable to board on Broadway due to crowding.&nbsp; And the next train doesn&#039;t show for another 5-7 minutes.<br /><br /><br />And Queensboro is a madhouse because the 7 keeps dropping off more and more people without a N/Q to transfer to.

				<br />What did I miss?&nbsp; What is this about the Q...once the 2nd Ave line is fully operational?<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />Either way the powers that be need to be MUCH more proactive re: the sense of urgency in addressing increased crowds on trains.&nbsp; As we see in comments here, the N/Q in Astoria is getting more and more packed.&nbsp; I know there&#039;s been talk of a possible ferry boat...going somewhere from around er...what do you call it...the area by the water where I think they were planning for big new complex?...I think there was talk of an Astoria-Manh. ferry, but not clear to exactly where in Manh such a ferry might make stops...<br /><br />I&#039;d also read once about the idea of like a funicular (similar to Roos Island) that would travel all along the Western waterfront of Queens and Bk (so like Astoria/LIC down towards Greenpoint).&nbsp; <br /><br />Any/all of this would be great.<br /><br />We also need to DISincent people from driving and parking cars on commercial streets within their immediate communities.&nbsp; Get out and do some WALKING people.&nbsp; Or take the bus.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen it in Astoria and I saw it when I lived in Ridgewood....people who seemed to be from the immediate area, driving their cars 10-15 blocks, parking (or in some instances DOUBLE parking), to do local shopping.&nbsp; On small neighborhood commercial streets, priority should be given to DELIVERY trucks and MTA buses.&nbsp; Not to lazy, self-centered residents who want to drive themselves 15 blocks to shop in their own neighborhood.&nbsp; Get a shopping cart like the rest of us.&nbsp; Take a taxi.&nbsp; Or take a bus.&nbsp; Cars are just so incredibly wasteful.&nbsp; Think about it.&nbsp; 90% of the time cars are sitting PARKED and not being used.&nbsp; Car-sharing should also be encouraged. <br /><br />I am so tired of being on MTA buses and having to sit in traffic because the streets are clogged with private cars, or double-parkers.&nbsp; The city needs to take the transportation of residents from Point A to Point B, much more seriously.

				<br />Hmmm...not sure I understand why the Second Ave line (which will presumably only operate within Manhattan?)....why the MTA thinks that they can therefore end the Q going into LIC/Astoria?&nbsp; What does one have to do with the other?<br /><br />Anyway, as for the possible ferry from Astoria-Manh., I agree that the only folks who&#039;d use it would be those who&#039;ll live in the immediate vicinity.&nbsp; However, more public transportation alternatives for ANY parts of Astoria will still create a positive domino effect for Astoria as a whole.&nbsp; For without the (new) ferry service, all those people who&#039;ll ultimately live in the new waterfront developments with then either be walking/shuttle busing over to the N/(Q), or else they will be taking the Q69/100 down to the F at Queensbridge.

				The 2nd Ave line is essentially an extension of the B&#039;way line so unless they have a shuttle between 96 St and where it joins up with the existing line they need to send the Q up 2nd ave instead of to Queens. They can&#039;t do both as there isn&#039;t bandwidth on the existing line to have two trains. This is a real problem for Astoria.

				<br />Still not sure I get it.&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;m not understanding what the trajectory of the 2nd Ave line will ultimately be.&nbsp; Is it going travel straight up 2nd Ave. from the EV to East Harlem?&nbsp; Or is the 2nd Ave line at some point going to run along part of the same tracks as where the N/Q currently both run?

				Phase 1 of the Second Avenue line is essentially an extension of the Broadway line, when it&#039;s complete (if ever) it will run from 125th Street to lower Manhattan with a new &#039;T&#039; train service, but you&#039;re right this is a real problem for Astoria. <br /><br />A more transit savvy can correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but I think there is capacity on the Broadway line to increase service.

				The completion of the 2nd avenue line is stalled again (surprise). The last I heard on NY1, it won&#039;t be completed until at least 2020. They claim it&#039;s because of the boring machine, but that $1 billion that they cut could certainly have been put to good use right now. I don&#039;t know if this means that the rerouting of the Q will be postponed, though that&#039;s not going to address the problem. By the time the train gets to Broadway in the morning, it&#039;s hit or miss as to whether you&#039;ll be able to get on.&nbsp; Forget about the waterfront development, there are new apartment buildings going up at a breakneck pace every few blocks, one extra N train at rush hour isn&#039;t going to make a lot of difference. <br /><br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t start making plans to get on a ferry in 2017 yet, either. The residents in Long Island City have already raised objections to the proposed terminal at Gantry plaza, worried about crowds and long lines and that&#039;s the first terminal that&#039;s been proposed.<br /><br /><br />The subway service has been more and more like the 80&#039;s recently, without the graffiti. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font">[size=78%] [/size]</span>

				I think what&#039;s stalled now due to the billion dollar budget cut is Phase II which is supposed to extend the line from 96th Street to 125th Street.<br /><br /><br />Phase I from 57th/7th Avenue to 96th/2nd with the Q train extension is set to open at the end of 2016 (or so they say).

				Does it? From everything I&#039;ve read Phase I connects the Q from 57th Street/7th Avenue station to 96th Street through the existing tunnels under Central Park and then via the new tunnels that are being constructed up from 63rd and Lex.

				You are correct. They are building this into the existing F train at 63rd/Lex then over to the B&#039;way line at 7th Ave. I foresee a lot of congestion on multiple lines. Doesn&#039;t look good.

				True, but that&#039;s a problem for F train riders, which will share the tracks with the proposed Q service for a short distance. It won&#039;t affect the N train.

				This will be especially good for people who work in the City Hall area. Hopefully, it will help to ease up the rush hour nightmare that is the Lexington Ave/59th street stop. People who work in the area will have the option of staying on the W instead of having to deal with the transfer to the 4,5, or 6. The 4 and 5 are usually anything but express at that time, so the local W won&#039;t really add any significant time to the commute. I work in that neighborhood and I see a lot of us every morning battling through the sea of people to get downstairs to the 4 or 5.
