				I think I missed this one in the operating instructions<br /><br />Can you be banned from this board by *bumping* a thread?? <br />Rumor has it&nbsp; - you can???<br /><br />Doesn&#039;t make sense to me... I&#039;m sure many have innocently *bumped* without being bumped.&nbsp; <br /><br />Please address. <br /><br />Maybe the person who was banned for this action misunderstoood the reason??<br /><br />

				No rumor. It&#039;s in the rules. Yes you can get suspended for bumping a thread. This is the same thing as posting a duplicate post, or spamming a topic. The whole purpose is to force the thread to get more visibility when people haven&#039;t taken interest in it organically.<br /><br />If you want the post to have more visibility, don&#039;t &quot;bump&quot; it.

				Here&#039;s the wording for those who haven&#039;t read the rules:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">- Avoid repetition and duplicate posting: We encourage a diversity of viewpoints; however once a point has been made the discussion needs to move forward. Excessive repetition and filibustering are not permitted - this also applies to &quot;announcements&quot;. You might think this will give more exposure to your content; it does, but in a negative way because this is seen as rude. Post your content once, to the correct category. This includes &quot;quoting&quot; an earlier message for the sole purpose of bumping the thread or expressing agreement. Please use the &quot;nod&quot; feature instead.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I should also point out that the subject of the thread is misleading. We don&#039;t &quot;ban&quot; anyone for violating most of the site guidelines. In most cases people get a warning, then a short suspension, then a long suspension, then a longer one, then they get &quot;banned&quot;. Of course it&#039;s up to the moderators how to handle each case as it&#039;s typically different. Spamming porn is one thing that will get you permanantly banned instantly for example, bumping a thread, or duplicate posting, or using all caps etc will just get you a warning. But technically speaking if you had already been suspended a couple times for other things you could I suppose be &quot;banned&quot; for doing it. I&#039;m not sure it would be the straw that breaks the camels back, but then again I&#039;ve never been pushed to the limit of my patience on thread bumping so who knows.

				Interesting topic, since I was suspended yesterday, and I didn&#039;t even get a warning. Granted it was my second suspension in as many years, but I would think that if you&#039;re going to suspend a user, a small warning would suffice, as well as informing the user why s/he is being suspended.

				Hey Bentley&#039;s dad. I didn&#039;t send you a warning because as you&#039;ve pointed out this is your second suspension after already having had previous warnings. However, the board should display the reason for your suspension when you visit the site, did it not? If so, then this is a malfunction because it&#039;s how I&#039;ve understood the process to work.

Or there&#039;s that one thread...<br /><br />I guess it just seems like there&#039;s lots of &quot;bumping&quot; and repetitive posting here that doesn&#039;t get people in trouble. Now, I&#039;m not saying that it should get them warned, but maybe that the rule is a little too general or the phrasing a little unclear. I understand that it is at your discretion, but I am pretty surprised that someone who bumped a thread about unmoderated discussion at a time when people were getting suspended it for the 3:30am thread is the one who got in trouble and not other posters who bump their own events or schill for local businesses.

				The specific problem is when people just &quot;bump&quot; the thread with no new content, or repost the same thing that was up further in the thread. If you&#039;re having a conversation that&#039;s not &quot;bumping&quot; specifically. The FP thread isn&#039;t a &quot;bump&quot;.

				I&#039;m thoroughly confused over the suspension process, based on what I have seen and the recent suspensions of NYCmacUser and Bentleysdad.&nbsp; I would like to understand the following:<br />If I&#039;m not mistaken, when someone posts something, Merm, or another Mod, thinks is offensive and the poster gets suspended as a result, the posts stays for everyone to see.&nbsp; What is the point or logic behind that?&nbsp; Why try to discourage the poster but leave the offensive message in place.&nbsp; <br /><br />Second, mamamac didn&#039;t actually spell&nbsp; A - - hole.&nbsp; To be clear, she spelled it a$$hole.&nbsp; &nbsp;(As an aside, I totally understand Bentleys suspension)&nbsp; People do not completely spell out offensive words on here all the time but I don&#039;t believe they get suspended or warned.&nbsp; There is a thread called The Astorians F - - K the neighbors soundtrack.&nbsp; Why is F - -K not a problem but a$$hole is?&nbsp; I don&#039;t believe the OP of that thread was suspended.&nbsp; And if he was because a mod finds that offensive then why is it OK to have F - -K in a thread?&nbsp; <br /><br />Similarly, people use arse instead of ass, F&#039;ing instead of f - - - ing, etc.,&nbsp; so I guess I&#039;m just really confused as to where the line is drawn.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Using &quot;bad words&quot; isn&#039;t against board policy explicitly. Except in cases where there would be an excessive use of profanity.

There are some cases where a user may cross the line, but where it&#039;s not enough for other members to send the post to the moderator queue and so we miss it. However, it&#039;s interesting to have you say that it &quot;depends on who you know&quot; because I recently was accused by others as suspending people I know too often, and giving people I don&#039;t know the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />In general though I am realizing however as a result of the recent feedback that it&#039;s probably a good time to solicit new input on the current rules, and perhaps add more moderators to the group again. It&#039;s my goal to 1) have rules that are agreed upon by the majority of the community (not simply the most vocal) and 2) enforce those rules as fairly as possible. As the community changes I recognize that the rules (and moderator group) will need to change and adapt as well.

				Both Matt and I try and read all the threads, but there are a lot of them, and when things start to get heated, we start getting people reporting the thread via the report to moderator function.&nbsp; <br /><br />Once I see a number (or even just one) report, I always go into the thread and see if things have crossed the line or if a warning note can calm things down.&nbsp; Usually a posting reminding folks of the rules of the board is sufficient to get discussion back on track, sometimes suspensions result, but that does not happen most times.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think this discussion has been very helpful in fleshing out an understanding of board rules.

				In the past we have decided to not post who has been suspended and who hasn&#039;t. This was at the request of several people who had been suspended but didn&#039;t like that it was public. If public opinion has shifted and it now is seen a better to know who is suspended publicly we could evaluate that again. There&#039;s pros and cons to each I realize.

So yes, if someone has been warned, then suspended several times they could be suspended for doing something like bumping threads etc. When someone demonstrates a pattern of coming the site just to cause problems and not follow forum guidelines they will not receive a warning and will just be suspended for future things.<br /><br />However, this being said, the third suspension most of the time is 30 days - so 7 days I don&#039;t think is overkill given the history. If you look at the history and comments of this particular poster however, I&#039;m not sure he is really looking to be a participatory member of the board. I could very well be wrong, and we&#039;ll know shortly I&#039;m sure. Anyone is welcome here as long as they can abide by the rules they (and everyone else) agreed to upon signup.<br /><br />Bentley, I thought you had your question answered as to why you were suspended - I&#039;ll compile a list for you. Also, llots of people&#039;s partners post on this site, and each of them is entitled to their own opinion. Sometimes they agree, and sometimes they disagree - but they don&#039;t speak for each other.

				I think all suspensions should be public knowledge -- who was suspended, and why ... this way we can not only chastised those people (which may/has include/d me at some pint), we can also see what to do to (not) get banned, suspended, or kicked off.

				I do think it would be nice to know if a friend of mine was suspended, but I don&#039;t think it should be listed in a thread of &quot;Current members on hiatus&quot;.&nbsp; If I get curious as to why someone hasn&#039;t logged on in a bit, I tend to look at his or her profile first.&nbsp; Maybe a simple message in there stating their status could be a good idea.<br /><br />All members could have a status:&nbsp; Active (which we could maybe have the option to change the wording individually) or Suspended

				Bentley, I&#039;ve responded to your request via PM.<br /><br />Aqua &amp; Lobber. The reason we&#039;ve not made it public in the past is because the purpose of a temporary suspension isn&#039;t really to &quot;shame&quot; someone into behaving, but to force them to step back from the keys for a while before posting again. Early on we got very negative feedback (and lost a few members) when this information was made public because they felt we were trying to shame them. <br /><br />I do agree there are positives and negatives for this information not being public. One negative for me is that it encourages gossip as to the reason the person was suspended, and allows people to hypothesize about the reasons for it. Often this gossip casts the moderators in the worst possible light. But, if an individual who loses their cool doesn&#039;t want that information public, currently we will honor that request despite the negatives.<br /><br />I&#039;m completely open to changing the approach if a majority is interested in it.

				I was thinking about this earlier - it might be good if members had the option for their account to be marked &quot;suspended&quot; or &quot;inactive&quot;, with the option to write in a comment as to the reason. Or maybe it could simply be written into the profile&#039;s tagline. Some people might not want others to know they are suspended or why, some people obviously do. <br /><br />I&#039;m also wondering if this board could use an ombudsperson, or a community advocate - a neutral party/parties with no conflicts of interest who can interact with both board management and users (and hopefully would be chosen with input from both - as both sides would have to be completely willing to work with the ombuds). I think it could be useful to have a buffer, and it would take some of the pressure off merm. I don&#039;t agree with all the decisions that have been made lately, but I can see that trying to always, objectively, make the best/right decisions with such a diverse, strong community while also keeping a full-time job would be difficult. <br /><br />I also think there should be some sort of appeal process for people who think their suspension was mishandled or that there was no clear reason, according to the board rules, for suspension. This might be another situation where the ombudsperson would come into play. <br /><br />Just some thoughts.

				In terms of making it public - one option might be to give suspended members posting rights in one thread only, where they are allowed to post that they have been suspended if they wish.&nbsp; This gives the suspended member the option of having the information public, but the default would still be not public.&nbsp; <br /><br />Of course, there is a certain amount of risk and possible need for additional moderation this way to prevent the thread from devolving away from its specific purpose, but it would solve the tension between public/not public by allowing the suspended member to divulge the information if he or she wishes in a uniform way.

				My only reservation with this is that I&#039;m afraid the posts will not be a simple notification to one&#039;s friends that they are suspended, but will instead be used as a way for suspended users to make a &quot;statement&quot; about the suspension itself instead.<br /><br />I&#039;m also a little worried that others will use the opportunity to celebrate the suspension of someone they disagree with if they know the person was suspended - and this might make things worse.

				I understand people wanting to be private about their suspensions but can you have it both ways?&nbsp; The act that got you suspended is public but the reason is not.&nbsp; I would want to know right in the allegedly offending post that the person was suspended and why.&nbsp; That way I can make my informed decision about whether the suspension was warranted rather than having to read through a dozen newly created threads by friends and family members that serve as a platform to vent for the alleged wrongdoing.&nbsp; Then you have to try to piece everything together if you care about making an objective determination about the legitimacy of someones suspension.&nbsp; There is also no way to know how many times someone has been suspended or warned for a particular behavior.&nbsp; If someone is suspended I would want to know how many times they were warned about the offending conduct.&nbsp; <br /><br />Generally speaking, I think there is a way to have a spirited, and intense exchange of ones views without having to resort to namecalling, for example, just because you don&#039;t agree with what someone is saying and even when you think their position is inane.&nbsp; This board has the right to control conversations that get out of hand or members that get out of hand.&nbsp; This is our house, our community.&nbsp; There should be a standard set to our discussions.&nbsp; Could you tell me to go f___ myself in my house?
