				My sister and her husband are coming to the city next weekend!&nbsp; Unfortunately, my sister refuses to come to Queens&nbsp; :x.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard enough to get her to NYC!&nbsp; That being said, I need to find a nice restaurant to go to in Manhattan.&nbsp; &nbsp;I know there thousands of options, but my sister is sort of picky about atmosphere and quality, so I am sort of nervous about making any choice that I make.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks in advance for your help!

				Uh, tons of options, you&#039;re right. Maybe you can help us help you if you give us some more specifics, budget, location, food preferences, etc...

				Thanks edava. Yeah, I guess I should provide some direction:<br /><br />I was thinking of someplace in midtown east area, so I was thinking about staying in the general area.&nbsp; My sister has expensive tastes, but I don&#039;t want something too expensive.&nbsp; In terms of food preferences, I really can&#039;t think of anything that they want to eat.&nbsp; I asked them, but their response was &quot;just find a nice place for us to eat and chat.&quot;&nbsp; It should be noted that my sister doesn&#039;t eat red meat, if that helps, but her husband would probably eat a whole cow on a plate if given the chance (yes, opposites do attract).&nbsp; However, when we&#039;ve gone out in the past, we usually defer to her highness, oh sorry, I meant my sister.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Hope this helps.&nbsp; Oh, and if anyone knows of a nice bar in the 34th Street area, let me know as well!

				I know you want midtown but I just had a religious experience at Mas on Downing in the village.&nbsp; The food was fantastic and the service great.&nbsp; It&#039;s not inexpensive but there are pricier places and it&#039;s tres chic right now - which, having said that, I didn&#039;t find them to be uppity about it.&nbsp; They have a small menu and a seasonal drink list - very interesting place and I&#039;m looking forward to go back.

				There are a lot of good bars around 34th St.&nbsp; Niles, on 7th Ave, between 30th and 31st is really kind of sleek and has good food as well. Or Tir Na Nog on 8th between 33rd and 34th.&nbsp; 33rd st between 6th and 7th has a few pubs; Stout, Blarney Rock, Joe O&#039;s.<br /><br />One of my favorite restaurants is on 28th between Park and Lexington, The Black Duck.&nbsp; Its a cool space with good food and good people.&nbsp; Check out their menu :http://www.menupages.com/restaurantdetails.asp?areaid=0&amp;restaurantid=3097&amp;neighborhoodid=0&amp;cuisineid=0<br /><br />Or if you&#039;re looking to stay further north, Dos Caminos is a good Mexican option on 50th and 3rd.<br /><br />

				Ate with sis and her husband @ Candelight 79 (just off Lex on 79th St.) last night. Vegetarian but not vegan. Gorgeous, cozy setting, delicious and filling food. Not cheap though! <br /><br />I had Moroccan chickpea cakes with apricot (?) chutney which was dry but nice, and the chutney was to die for. We shared some mashed potatoes (typical), sauteed mushrooms (okay), polenta fries (looked like mozzarella sticks), organic wine (very nice), veggie risotto (yum!), dumplings (droolll) and then some Kahlua flan :evil:<br /><br />The dishes that were good were very very good; the others were a bit bland BUT I could&#039;ve been more generous with my use of the accompanying sauces so maybe I wasn&#039;t doing them right! Truly a delightful dinner experience.

				Candlelight 79 is wonderful and tasty.<br />Tamarind, a high end fusion Indian on 22nd just West of Park Avenue South also rocks.

				I lived in midtown east for about 10 years.&nbsp; I&#039;d say for what you&#039;re looking for, you should check out Metropolitan Cafe http://www.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;q=metropolitan+cafe&amp;near=New+York,+NY&amp;radius=0.0&amp;latlng=40714167,-74006389,10317231604024398299&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=local&amp;ct=authority&amp;cd=2 (http://www.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;q=metropolitan+cafe&amp;near=New+York,+NY&amp;radius=0.0&amp;latlng=40714167,-74006389,10317231604024398299&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=local&amp;ct=authority&amp;cd=2)

				Hey,<br /><br />I regret not cheking this update sooner!&nbsp; Eblack, I had actually heard of the Metropolitan Cafe before, but I totally forgot about it!&nbsp; Hmm, maybe we&#039;ll have brunch there tomorrow morning!&nbsp; Anyway, I ultimately decided on a Korean restaurant on 33rd Street and Madison.&nbsp; I remember going there before and the service and food was excellent!&nbsp; It&#039;s one of those places that you cook your own food and they bring trays and trays of appetizers and meat and fish.&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember how much I spent the last time I was there, but I think it was around $30 which isn&#039;t bad for as much food as we got!&nbsp; I guess I just might be used to Manhattan prices!<br /><br />Thanks again!
