				My wife and I have lived in Astoria for the last four years, and we&#039;re now looking to buy a place rather than continuing to rent.&nbsp; We don&#039;t quite have enough for the single- and two-family homes, so we&#039;re focusing on apartments/coops/condominiums between $400-500K, which we realize are in short supply in the Astoria market.<br /><br />If anyone has any brokers/realtors to recommend, or even may know someone looking to sell, we&#039;d appreciate any recommendations or information that you might have.&nbsp; We&#039;re only just getting started on this process and know we have a long road ahead of us.&nbsp; Thanks.

				You might want to keep an eye on the site OuterB (http://outerb.com/), which megc, one of the posters here, writes for.&nbsp; Good luck, I&#039;m trying to convince my gf that when/if the time comes to buy a place we can afford one in Astoria/LIC.&nbsp; It&#039;d be a similar financial situation to yours too, but we still have some time.

				Hello Cassiel,<br />My name is Luminita, I work for Citi-Habitats in Manhattan but I live in a 2 bed co-op in Astoria. My family and I moved in Astoria about 3 months ago, and paid under $350.000 for our co-op. It&#039;s a lovely place to live in, and right now there are a couple of people who are selling their apartments.<br />I&#039;d be happy to take you out and check them.&nbsp; Please contact me at your earlier convenience.<br /><br />Luminita

				We&#039;re looking to buy now because we&#039;ve reached a financial stage where we&#039;re in a position to do so, and despite the current condition of the housing market, continuing to pay rent versus owning property is in no way a better use of our money.&nbsp; We&#039;re buying in Astoria because it&#039;s our neighborhood and we like it here; we plan to live in our apartment, so it&#039;s not intended solely as an investment; otherwise, we would just invest in a cheaper property in a different neighborhood and wait for it to appreciate.<br /><br />Beyond that, your implications that my wife doesn&#039;t &quot;think normally&quot;, that I don&#039;t think independently and have thereby been &quot;dragged into&quot; this decision, and that we&#039;re incapable of making informed decisions as a couple are, frankly, insulting ones.&nbsp; However, as they&#039;re probably more a commentary on the dynamic of your personal life than of ours, rather than choose to be insulted, you have our pity instead.

				Dirk- I haven&#039;t been able to find a website myself, but I did go look at one of the condo&#039;s awhile back and it was nice. The place we looked at wasn&#039;t huge- but it recently renovated and had a nice size basement with lots of storage space and room for a washer/dryer.The one we looked at was part of the two story condos. There were some others across the street that looked like they had more floors.

				The thing is that not everyone thinks of a home as an &quot;investment&quot;, some people buy a home because they plan to live there for a long time and don&#039;t like having someone else own it. They don&#039;t want to get kicked out, they don&#039;t want to have to wait on the landlord to fix something, they don&#039;t want to have to report the landlord when their heat doesn&#039;t work.<br /><br />You may be right that the housing market is over inflated when it comes to investment properties, but if someone is going to live in a house for a long time there are plenty of experts out there that would say any time is a fine time to buy.<br /><br />Some people would rather throw away $2000 in interest payments than $2000 to a non-responsive landlord.

				There&#039;s nothing wrong with paying cash for a home but the majority of us don&#039;t have that kind of money.<br /><br />So you have two options; rent or buy.<br /><br />Rent...you are basically throwing your money away. &nbsp;Not only are you throwing your money away but any improvements you make to the apartment (if you&#039;re allowed to) are meaningless financially. &nbsp;If the apartment has crappy kitchen cabinets and the landlord won&#039;t change them but you want to have a nice looking kitchen and go through the expense of getting nice kitchen cabinets (inexpensive HomeDepot ones, not over the end for an apartment) but still an expense...guess what? &nbsp;It means crap when it&#039;s time to move, the landlord keeps for FREE.<br /><br />Own...sure, you are paying the bank interest, which at the moment is not much interest considering how low the rates are. &nbsp;Nonetheless, a mortgage gives you options. &nbsp;Most of them do not have prepayment penalty so if you happen to get a big chunk of money you can apply it to the principal. &nbsp;You have the option of making double payments each month AND if you happen to become a millionaire you can pay it off and just like a car loan, you have a payoff amount (you don&#039;t pay the interest due for the remainder of the mortgage). &nbsp;So sure, till that point you paid interest on the amount borrowed, but a) it&#039;s tax deductible (in rent nothing is deductable); b) your equity goes up with time; c) anything you do to the premises increased the value.<br /><br />About the over inflated real estate market? &nbsp;Yes, that&#039;s a given BUT you can always get foreclosure lists from banks, the State of New York does have auctions for real estate properties... http://www.jer.com/JERrevserv/JERRS-NYC-Overview.asp, also look at the HUD site. &nbsp;<br /><br />Sure, realtors don&#039;t want you to have this information because the lose out on commission but it is there, just a matter of doing the research.<br /><br />Good luck in finding a home in Astoria, it&#039;s a wonderful neighborhood.<br /><br />Oh, one more thing....Landlord&#039;s (even in a stabilized rent building) can say that the apartment is going to be used for &quot;personal use&quot; and kick you out (of course you have a certain amount of time to move out, etc.) but you are at the Landlords mercy.&nbsp; Whereby when you own your place, it&#039;s up to you and no one else.

				&lt;The point that confuses me about nycdj&#039;s whole schtick is that renting is also flushing money down the toilet, moreso than buying a place.&nbsp; I&#039;m not about to debate whether the housing market is inflated, but purchasing a home and paying a mortgage results in personal equity.&nbsp; Every mortgage payment you make is essentially money that&#039;s going into your pocket, whereas a renter&#039;s money goes to a landlord, and you&#039;re left with nothing.&gt;<br /><br />ditto ditto ditto ditto<br /><br />&lt;sad fact is about 1/2 of the people who bought in the last 3-4 years had no intention of living in them&gt;<br /><br />What area are you talking about exactly? The whole country? NY state? Astoria? Florida?<br /><br />I think it&#039;s safe to assume that most of us here are talking about the Astoria market and I see lots of young people/with families moving into the neighborhood. So what if they leave in 4 years? There are very few people who stay anywhere anymore for decades, that is old school mentality when people also had their jobs for 20+ years. Know of any 20-30 year olds who&#039;ve had the same job in the same place for 10-15 years? <br /><br />Every year I&#039;ve lived here (13 yrs.) rents and sales have gone up, wether that&#039;s a bubble or not, NY is different from most places around the U.S. People come to retire to NY these days, not inflated Florida or Arizona, where there&#039;s nothing to do. Demand will always be high here and Astoria has been improving for decades, despite ugly buildings (Pistilli) and corrupt landlords. $1500 is not cheap for a rental, for some people that&#039;s half their monthly income if not more, so throwing away $1500 is not an easy decision. <br /><br />When the majority of brokers and landlords around here are happy to take advantage of you, it&#039;s hard to bluff your way or even find a decent place to live that&#039;s not a closet for $1800, and where your landlord actually does work to maintain the building and doesn&#039;t stiff you out of what&#039;s their legal responsibility. Your friend is lucky to bargain and walk away, many people around here don&#039;t have that luxury.

				I think what DJ is trying to say that a lot of times you can rent a place for a lot less than the interest payments you&#039;d make on a mortgage if you buy the place (in other words, the interest payments alone, excluding any amount you are paying in principal, are way higher than what you&#039;d pay in rent). Consider the following example:<br /><br />An Astoria House:<br />To Rent: $2000/mo. Thowing away entire $2000 a month to landlord. Heat, Repairs, Taxes paid for (theoretically).<br />To buy: $800,000.&nbsp; Mortgage payment of $4000/mo ($3,000/mo going to interest, $1,000 going to your principal) = Throwing away $3,000/mo to bank, and $1000/mo going into your house equity). Heat, Repairs, and Taxes not paid for. These are additional on your mortgage payments.<br /><br />In that example it would be a better &quot;investment&quot; to save the extra $1000 a month and just rent. Assuming the housing market continues to grow, at some point (some unknown number of years in the future) your &quot;investment&quot; portion of the house would have paid for itself and the buy option is a good deal.)<br /><br />If you are living in an apartment where the landlord bought the house in 1950 for $30,000, then you can see why you may be able to get a lot lower rent than mortgage payment for the exact same house as the owner is probably renting it for less than the interest alone you&#039;d pay on a mortgage (the throw-away portion of the mortgage excluding any equity you&#039;re building).<br /><br />Bottom line is that if you want to live in a house for a long time then it&#039;s probably never really a bad time to buy (like 10 years or more). But if you&#039;re looking for a good &quot;investment&quot; that will earn you a return, you&#039;re probably better off putting your money in the bank and renting unless you find a way to get a mortgage where the interest portion of the loan is less than or equal to the amount you&#039;d pay for renting the exact same place.

				Thank you for taking the time to summarize and explain this so thoroughly (I had no idea when I started this thread that it would launch such a spirited exchange, but that&#039;s how the internet works, I guess).<br /><br />The exception that so many are taking to aNYCdj&#039;s posts seems based on, in addition to their combative tone, his continuing insinuation that anyone who doesn&#039;t share his view is incapable of doing the math involved in determining the financial feasibility of buying versus renting, is somehow a dupe or shill of the real estate industry, is ignorant of the dynamics of the NYC real estate market, and/or is at the mercy of hysterical and conniving wives and girlfriends who are goading them into poor decisions (this last one being the most patently offensive).&nbsp; Even if one is some sort of Trump/Ratneresque real estate whiz, conducting one&#039;s self by taking a condescending, abrasive, and misogynist tone in a community forum smacks of a desire for attention rather than well-meaning advice and wisdom.

				I guess I was pretty lucky.&nbsp; We purchased our house seven years ago, just before the market took a major hike northwards.&nbsp; Anyway, what we pay for a mortgage for the house is what people are currently paying in rent for a two-bedroom house.&nbsp; I pay a bit extra on the principal every month so that we can pay the mortgage off faster.&nbsp; I&#039;m happy we made the investment - it was worth it and the house is right opposite Astoria Park!&nbsp; I feel blessed and hope all of you have a similar opportunity some day.

				YES as soon as the market crashes and we can buy at what you paid....we all will be happy....so SELL NOW AND DUMP IT ON SOME SUCKER.....Bank the cash and buy after the crash.<br /><br />But you wont SELL and RENT and&nbsp; will wait till the price plunges to less then you paid for it&nbsp; and then complain what a lousy investment real estate is.<br /><br />Come on sell....you cant do it........no guts&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You are just like the guy who bought amazon at 50 watched it go to $500 then let it fall all the way back to $50 and sold.<br /><br />You cant fathom taking the &quot;profit&quot;&nbsp; and renting.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=6579.msg80181.html#msg80181">Quote from: Debbie on July 02, 2007, 09:50:52 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&nbsp; I feel blessed and hope all of you have a similar opportunity some day.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
