				Had a brief problem last night - I do have Time Warner, but I didn&#39;t have any problems with other sites.<br /><br />I&#39;ve had repeated error messages (e.g. &quot;DNS Domain &#39;www.astorians.com&#39; is invalid: Host not found (authoritative).&quot;) trying to access the site in the past half hour or so, and right now the site formatting is completely screwy (white background, no delineation of separate posts, although I see the pictures at the top - but no cork board).&nbsp; I&#39;m at work so I have no idea what the connection is, aside from at a minimum a T1.<br /><br />p.s.&nbsp; While posting I got the error message again, and when I hit the back button, the formatting came back.

				What&#39;s strange is that the server is actually up this whole time, it hasn&#39;t gone down. It&#39;s like someone is unplugging a cable somewhere in the middle between here and there.

				For the time being I&#39;ve updated the server to use it&#39;s IP address (instead of the domain name) until this can be figured out more.<br /><br />So, if you cant reach astorians at www.astorians.com, you can reach it at http://www.astorians.net<br /><br />You might want to bookmark that address<br />:)

				It&#39;s not working on my computer at all when I go to astorians.com. It just shows that &quot;The page cannot be displayed&quot; message.<br /><br />This started last night when I tried to get on around 10pm or so, and I didn&#39;t try again til today around 2pm, when I got the same thing.<br /><br />Then Tom told me to try astorians.net, which is how I got to this page - but it&#39;s still the ugly unformatted version, no pictures, etc.<br /><br />I use Verizon DSL.

The domain registrar is having to call up <em>their</em> support guys to look into it. It&#39;s a very strange occurance indeed. I&#39;m a bit concerned that we&#39;ve lost a lot of traffic for the last couple days, which is unfortunate. I did send out an email this morning, but it also sounds like some didn&#39;t get it (again, probably because mail isn&#39;t being routed properly for the domain).<br /><br />This is however a really good learning experience for me as I&#39;m having the chance to work on things that I&#39;ve never looked into before. Once we can get to the bottom of it I&#39;ll provide an update.<br /><br />Thanks for hanging in there!

				So as we experienced through the brief Astorians outage, many of us have become junkies of the astorians website, and went through withdrawl symptoms.&nbsp; I do believe that if they could mass-produce astorians, a lot of us would be injecting it into our veins.&nbsp; It was almost as traumatic as the Con-Ed fiasco.&nbsp; Only Merm was on the ball immediately, with accurate numbers of people with out astorians.<br /><br />So...<br />maybe wasabisam can come up with some cool syringe designs to put on the astorians store, so we can get our astorians fix even when the site goes down.&nbsp; :crazy:

				Hi guys,<br /><br />Yeah, if you click on that &quot;check astorians&quot; link through dnsstuff.com it will say the same thing for everyone. Doesn&#39;t actually matter which service provider you are reaching us through, I just asked that early on to try and pinpoint the problem in case it was with people&#39;s local ISPs - it&#39;s not.<br /><br />What&#39;s happening now (the reason some of you can access and some can&#39;t) is that despite the fact that the address has been removed from the root DNS servers, some of your computers and ISPs are &quot;remembering&quot; the address from when before it was deleted. Every computer &quot;caches&quot; the address for a while, and most ISP&#39;s do as well. Commercial ones cache DNS for longer, which is why some of you can access from work. At this point though DNSStuff is going to report the same for all of us because it&#39;s not reporting on your local internet connection, but that is the report for the ROOT domain servers for the entire internet. If they can&#39;t see us (they say &quot;astorians.com doesn&#39;t exist&quot;) then nobody can.<br /><br />No word yet on a cause, so I don&#39;t want to start any rumors.

				I don&#39;t mean to butt in here (though it seems appropriate to do so after getting this e-mail announcement from a board I haven&#39;t looked at in 12 years :-D ) but I don&#39;t understand how you can you lose control of a domain without anything happening to its WHOIS record? WHOIS shows astorians.com at ns1/2.windowtree.com, which appears to be a virtual DNS hosted at defenderhosting? (Maybe you get to them through a reseller) <br /><br />If this happened to me I would not wait around for or even bother with the registrar, I would check my own virtual DNS settings, reboot the DNS and/or Apache (or the whole box if you have that option) and then rattle the cloister at the data center/hosting facility to see if astorians.com is not sitting on their 4th or 5th (or 50th) strength DNS server. And I would keep calling back or working their other support channels until you get a qualified tech person who can look at the data center&#39;s routers and tell if the one(s) propagating your domain are working well or at all.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know how much this means, but a full traceroute to ns1.windowtree.com sends one to a strange looking defenderhosting hostname, at which it appears the local router might have failed:<br />unknown83.126.65.69.defenderhosting.com.<br /><br />The IP address works: http://69.65.104.197/ which further suggests a local name server or router glitch.<br /><br />I am not questioning what you&#39;ve said, just asking out of curiosity should something like this happen to me. I have never seen a domain name get hijacked without some evidence of tampering in the WHOIS record. But domains vanish from the Internet for a lot of other reasons, like when some cPanel weirdness blows up the local configuration for a particular domain. <br /><br />Not saying that&#39;s what happened here, just that dozens of factors could contribute to something like this, and the least nefarious is usually the culprit.<br /><br />OK, back in another 12 years&nbsp; 8-)<br /><br />

These were the first steps I did to try and figure out the problem, and yes, my hosting is with Defender Hosting. However, this is not the problem, the nameservers are working fine.<br /><br />If you look at my whois record you will see that the status of the domain is REGISTRAR-HOLD. This means that the domain has been suspended. I was never given notice before the suspension, nor have I done anything outside the guidelines of ICANN (http://www.icann.com/) or eNom (http://www.enom.com/terms/agreement.asp) to warrant same.<br /><br />In this case the &quot;reason&quot; for our Denial of Service has nothing to do with brute force or technical failure. I&#39;ll be writing more about this shortly, but would like to first focus on getting our domain back to working order.

				Hi all. I&#39;m sorry they took that route too, it would have been so easy for them to just say hello to the people in the thread and introduce themselves as a person connected with the site - no big deal. I really don&#39;t get it.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#39;ve learned some really interesting things along the way though so I don&#39;t consider it a loss. Hopefully the person feels satisfied now and will just go on with their life. Or perhaps they&#39;ll finally take our invitation to say hello and introduce themself and tell us about their domain.

It&#39;s the domain registrar that this person has complained to because they knew this was the easiest way to deny service to our domain (as opposed to attacking the server directly it&#39;s like someone going to the post office and convincing the post office to stop delivering mail to your address so that nobody can communicate with you).<br /><br />The next thing I knew they were socially engineering a Denial of Service on my domain, and eNom seems to have bought it without contacting me at all to give me a chance to respond. I made multiple good-faith attempts to contact the person to resolve any complaints they had about the domain, but they ignored me and continued filing complaints to eNom and my domain registrar. I now am going through a process with eNom to try and explain the situation to them and prove to them that my domain contact information is indeed valid. After their &quot;review&quot; (which they are in no hurry to complete since their legal agreement allows them to do anything they want) I may get the domain back, but the timeframe for this is unknown.

				Thanks annie,<br /><br />You are right, this does represent an interesting risk for people who have domains (at least with eNom) that depend on them for traffic or income. It seems they can pretty easily be convinced to disable your domain without attempting to contact you first.<br /><br />In my case they bought this person argument for two reasons. <br /><br />1.) I use a voicemail service out of Seattle, WA. I&#39;ve had it for years and continue to use it today for business reasons (I give this out publicly to companies to avoid marketing calls). I check this voicemail daily, and haven&#39;t ever had problems with it. However, having a site named &quot;astorians&quot; for NY, and a voicemail in Seattle made this person&#39;s false claims appear more credible.<br /><br />2.) I prefer not to put my home address on my domain contact information (for reasons that should now be obvious), so I put my PO BOX, which is located in California and checked regularly by someone legally authorized to collect my mail. But this also gave credibility to this person&#39;s claims (that the information was inaccurate).<br /><br />Even though there&#39;s nothing in ICANN&#39;s or eNoms agreement or requirements that your address be located in the same geographic area, or that your address has to be your home address, this person was successfully able to convince them to suspend my domain without contacting me (which interestingly their own agreement says they will do before deactivation). This being the case, it took me 2 days to even figure out what the problem was. eNom deactivated the domain last Tuesday.

				Perhaps a funner (happier) move would be to create the official website of astoria.<br /><br />Jonathan has talked about restuarant reviews.&nbsp; Why not expand that to a neighborhood guide?&nbsp; Build a useful, pretty, information intensive content based everything you wanted to know about astoria site?<br /><br />Clearly it hasn&#39;t been done to our satisfaction and the other &quot;official&quot; astoria guide is more about real estate marking than astoria.

				I think if we are to do anything as a community it needs to be intelligent and well thought out. I&#39;m hearing that from you guys too. We have time to choose a response, I don&#39;t think we&#39;re at risk of losing the domain. If any action that we take is seen as &quot;retaliation&quot; it will just justify the very kind of behavior that we all loathe in the first place. I&#39;m not against the community having a response, but I see Jayme&#39;s point in making sure that our response isn&#39;t in kind. I do not want to legitimize this person&#39;s paradigm by behaving the same way. I think that having a discussion about it here though might help us to decide what (if any) response we might want to have as individuals or as a community, so I welcome open and thoughtful discussion on what that might be. I genuinely appreciate all the input so far.<br /><br />As far as what the community can do to help I think the best thing for us to do right now is just wait and see what kind of response we get from eNom. I do not believe that our domain is at risk, this is a simple matter of eNom believing (falsely) that I&#39;ve misrepresented myself on the domain registration. This will be easy to prove once they look at the records. They just seem to be a bit slow (and a bit gullable). If people contact them directly it might make matters worse. Should this process drag on for a long time however a community response might help. Until then I think it&#39;s best to keep it simple, because it is still a fairly simple matter.<br /><br />I also agree that the businesses listed on this person&#39;s site may not actually have given permission for their listing to be there (just as many businesses that are linked on astorians have not). Even if a business asks to have their link removed from a site, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything they can really do about it if the person doesn&#39;t comply (unless you can prove trademark infringement or something). Many websites simply link to lots of other sites to give them a higher rank in the search engines. By cross linking sites you can gain a higher search rating for sites you want to promote (say, sites you are responsible for designing or maintaining). I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s a bad idea to notify business that they are linked there and let them know what you think, but, I wouldn&#39;t hold them responsible for being there on the first place since they probably don&#39;t even know they are listed there.<br /><br />As for donations, they are welcome at any time. Luckily I haven&#39;t needed to retain the services of a lawyer or anything yet so related expenses are still reasonable.<br /><br />Overall though I&#39;d like any response to be one that mirrors the kind of behavior we wish we&#39;d have gotten from this person in the first place. I&#39;m personally tired of the tunnel-vision that &quot;revenge&quot; gives, and would like to see its effects minimized in our community. I&#39;m not sure how to accomplish that (maybe it&#39;s not even possible, the mods know how I&#39;ve struggled with&nbsp; what to do), but I do like to think that when one (or many) have been wronged it presents a unique opportunity to raise the bar.

				Oh wow, 5 new replies since I posted the last reply! :)<br /><br />I wouldn&#39;t want astorians.com to be the &quot;official&quot; website of astoria either. But maybe there&#39;s another site we can create that is. Applying for a ny.gov or whatever address, and then volunteering to manage it could be an interesting idea. You could put general information about astoria, links to businesses, and sites of interest. Could be fun and beneficial to the community as well.

				you are all likely aware of this but the good folks at not for tourists have put together a guide for astoria. granted it is not web based, but there is some precedent for quantifying the resources present in the neighborhood. see http://www.notfortourists.com/qu-pdfs.aspx?city=NY (http://www.notfortourists.com/qu-pdfs.aspx?city=NY) for more info and to download a pdf of the area. perhaps they would be interested in co-developing an interactive neighborhood guide? *thinking out loud*<br /><br />i also just noticed that they have a database of neighborhood resources. see http://www.notfortourists.com/ny-datbsearch1.aspx?city=NY (http://www.notfortourists.com/ny-datbsearch1.aspx?city=NY) to try it out.
