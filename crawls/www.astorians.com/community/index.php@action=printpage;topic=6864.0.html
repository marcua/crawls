				I just had this realization: people&#039;s quirks are usually very random but also pretty funny, so why don&#039;t we share one or two?<br /><br />What made me think of this is one of my own quirks: I sometimes say quick phrases in other languages, like &quot;a la gauche&quot; not really considering the fact that the person I&#039;m speaking to doesn&#039;t actually speak French... and I do this almost expecting them to just understand anyway... why? I don&#039;t know!! It&#039;s just a quirk I think.<br /><br />Ok, you go!

				The ultimate game of the proletariat!&nbsp; :-D :roll:<br /><br />It&#039;s where you can&#039;t touch the ground because everything is lava, so you stand on the furniture and jump on the coffee tables and you can&#039;t touch the black on the road or you die.

I played a very similar game with my cousin Ryan when we were kids. Except for the ground wasn&#039;t the ground- it was water- shark infested water!

				Let&#039;s see...I am terrified of rhubarb. I mean, I won&#039;t eat it or touch it or go within three feet of it. And if I see a rhubarb leaf I will run screaming. Luckily there&#039;s not a lot of rhubarb growing in NYC, but where I come from almost everyone has a rhubarb patch in their yard. Some people don&#039;t cut it to make pies...they let it go to seed...the seed pods make it even scarier because they add the prospect of rhubarb spreading all over the neighborhood...gives me the heebeejeebees.&nbsp; :-o<br /><br />The other (who am i kidding i have many others) is that even though I have a table and chairs i still eat sitting on the floor. College habits die hard&nbsp; :wink:

				Well sorry about that drooling bit, here&#039;s a hanky. <br /><br />As for my quirks, I used to crack my knuckles A LOT, but now I just don&#039;t do it as much. I too may suffer( although I wouldn&#039;t call it suffering but rather languishing) from OCD. Yes, I am not as neat overall as I used to be, but occasionally I&#039;ll get it into my head that a room in the apt needs to be cleaned, and I&#039;ll end up cleaning the whole damn house, closets included. <br /><br />&nbsp; When I&#039;m driving I&#039;ll curse the idiot in front of me who doesn&#039;t move 30 seconds after the light changes green even though I know&nbsp; they can&#039;t hear me. I&#039;ll honk after 45 seconds.

Some lights only stay green for 30 seconds, it&#039;s a long time! (No, I&#039;m not being sarcastic! Time it on your watch.) I&#039;m all &quot;toot!&quot; after 5-10 seconds. I understand that people look away/are fiddling with the radio/doing whatever, so I&#039;m not all &quot;HOOOOOOONK!&quot; It&#039;s more of a polite little beep&nbsp; :lol:

				Ok, so maybe I honk first and curse later, and if a traffic light is green for only 30 seconds, then it&#039;s definitely got problems. <br /><br />&nbsp; Another one of my &quot;quirks&quot;, if you will, is: when I am grilling something on the b-b-q- like a london broil, the grilling marks&nbsp; on one side have to be perpendicular to the other side. Don&#039;t ask me why, or when it started but so it is. I guess it&#039;s related to the OCD.

				the mixing ketchup and barbeque sauce reminded me of one of my dad&#039;s quirks: when he&#039;s alone at our cabin, he mixes spaghetti o&#039;s, baked beans and corned beef hash in a pan, cooks it, and eats it. If there is anyone out there who thinks THAT sounds yummy, I would like to meet him/her&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:

				I crack my neck when I get pissed off - like some action hero who&#039;s about to take out a whole bar full of guys in plaid.&nbsp; In reality, I think I do it, because it relieves the tension in my neck.

				I like looking inside open doors and windows of apartments. Its a little nosy, but i&#039;m always curious about how others organize their furniture, hang things on the walls, etc. Its especially interesting when looking in windows of brownstones in brooklyn and NY.

				If I&#039;m eating breakfast at a diner, I will eat the grape jelly from the little packet, straight up. No need to ruin it by partnering it up with toast.&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />This only occurs at diners; if i have grape jelly at home i put it on toast.<br /><br />
