				I&#039;ve lived in Astoria for a few yrs now and every summer I mean to get out and play some sort of sport or participate in an outdoor activity on a regular basis.<br /><br />Do people get together in Astoria Park and play anything?<br /><br />Are there people out there that want to start playing something? I&#039;m interested in playing anything really....<br /><br />

				Too bad some moron kids someplace (no other explanation) didn&#039;t realize that you&#039;re not supposed to play catch with lawn darts.&nbsp; &nbsp;I bet that would be a blast over at the park.<br /><br />I wonder if you could play horeshoes in that old bacci court.&nbsp; &nbsp; I forgot.. not supposed to drink in the park and horeshoes is no fun withoug beer.<br /><br />Hey... maybe that&#039;s what happened with the lawn darts.
