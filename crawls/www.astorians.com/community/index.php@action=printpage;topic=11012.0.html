				I used Shea Moving back in March, and they were very good: wrapped everything well, didn&#039;t charge for tape or furniture blankets or boxes that were used during the move.&nbsp; They&#039;ll come and see what you have &amp; give you an estimate.

				I too used Shea Moving when I first moved here. The photo on their website http://www.sheamoving.com/&nbsp; has a photo showing a guy with furniture stapped to his back. <br />This is what they really do.&nbsp; I have some large pieces of furniture and was amazed when they strapped it on and carried it up 4 flights of stairs. Oy, that last sentence <br />seems almost vulgar&nbsp; :lol:

				My fiance and I just moved a week ago and used, &quot;White Glove Movers&quot;. This was the second time that my Fiance has used them, and because of how well the first move went he insisted on using them again. They showed up with 4 guys, one was a foreman who oversaw the whole move. I have to say, they were extremely professional! They wrapped up my huge flatscreen T.V. as well as all my computer equipment (2 pc&#039;s total) and only charged $100 for it. <br />I guess my only complaint is that the move ended up costing alot more then we had thought it would. This moving company has a minimum of 4 hours and charges $150 an hour + 150 for travel time. We figured since we were moving from a small 2 bedroom apartment that was on a second floor walkup, to a 2 bedroom in an elevator building, that the move would end up taking no more then the 4 hours. I mean we were only moving 4 blocks away and there was plenty of parking in the front of the building. Not to mention we had pre-packed all our belongings so the movers didn&#039;t have to pack anything but our T.V and PC&#039;s. To our suprise, the move ended up taking 5 hours wich after all the extra costs (travel fee and packing costs) brought us to a grand total of almost $1200 wich is exactly what we were quoted at on the phone. I guess I feel like that extra hour could&#039;ve been avoided if they had worked a little faster.<br />Do I think they were worth it, yes. They are the type of moving company you hire if you want a stress and free move with no problems, and are not concerned as much with costs, not to mention they are extremely nice. We had to change the move date and they didn&#039;t give us a hard time at all about it. The foreman pretty much oversees and handles everything, and even double checks everything rite down to your packing job to ensure nothing gets broken. They didn&#039;t break, dent, or scratch one item, door, or wall. They even put my bed together for me without even asking. At the end of the move a manager will call to ask how the move went and if you are happy with the outcome of everything. So all in all, great move but big dent in our pocketbook...

				i know it&#039;s been almost a year since anyone has posted on this thread. just wondering if anyone has recently used murph&#039;s suggestion--moving748@hotmail. they&#039;re called Olga Movers. russians? hey, okay with me. some of my people are from Ukraine. i was quoted the same of $60/hr for 2 guys or $80/hr for 3 guys, with a $60 travel fee. this is a great rate and it works out to be much less than what was quoted by rabbit movers (over $500 flat) and intense movers ($160/hr). haven&#039;t called the highly recommended shea movers yet.<br /><br />i think i may go with Olga. there are tons of ads on craigslist offering the same $60/hr approx. but i&#039;d rather use someone who&#039;s been recommended. <br /><br />if anyone has other suggestions for this price point, please let me know.<br /><br />thanks!

				Another vote for Shea; I wrote in more detail about our experience with them here: http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=17182.msg201887#msg201887<br /><br />One of their foremen lives near Ditmars and I see him occasionally in the corner grocery. Every time I see him in his Shea shirt I get warm happy memories of moving day. How many people can say that about a moving company?

				Sven Moving! They are awesome, friendly, affordable, fast and hard working.<br />&nbsp;<br />I used them for my last 2 moves and have recommended<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;them to everyone with great responses.<br /><br /><br />I recently moved out my studio and they helped with that too. Lots of delicate equipment handled with such care. These are gooood guys!<br />And they love US (from recommending and using them so much) so mention you heard about them from &#039;Keith and The Girl&#039; (our studio)!<br /><br /><br />Their website is svenmoving.com<br /><br /><br />Good luck!
