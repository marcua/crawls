				Other than stoop sales...I can&#39;t remember if Sound Town records on 30th ave. near Steinway sells any vinyl.&nbsp; I have a feeling they have some, but I&#39;m not sure.&nbsp; That&#39;s probably your best bet, for used vinyl anyway.&nbsp; For new vinyl you probably have to go into Manhattan.<br /><br />I love vinyl

				The second hand store on Ditmars near 33rd street has some. Haven&#39;t checked out the collection to see if it&#39;s &quot;good&quot;.

Which in my opinion is more of a junk shop than a thrift shop.<br /><br />Also, if you watch the King of Queens, you can see it when they are doing shots of the train at Astoria Blvd. Which is retarded b/c they live in Rego Park. <br />(they never outright say it, but there was one episode where Doug drives Arthur around and they start from home. They show the trip on a map of queens and the starting point was rego park. i think the episode was called papa pill, when carrie lets doug take care of arthur b/c the two men think she&#39;s treating her dad like a baby....yes i watch waaaaaaaay too much TV, especially if my home town borough is in it in any way shape or form).

				Don&#39;t underrate the Goodwill and Salvation Army.&nbsp; I found some great soul, disco, and funk on Steinway.<br /><br />I too am always looking for records but have yet to go to the store on 30th Ave.&nbsp; From what I&#39;ve read on the boards they&#39;ll order stuff that they don&#39;t have in stock if you&#39;re interested.<br /><br />That doesn&#39;t help for used vinyl though - which I&#39;m all about.<br /><br />Brewgrass, you spin?
