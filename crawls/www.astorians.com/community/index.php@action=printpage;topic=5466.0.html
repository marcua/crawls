				Democracy for America (http://www.democracyforamerica.com/) is asking for people to hold candlelight vigils on or around March 19th.&nbsp; The idea is to have thousands of Americans hit the streets from March 17 to 20 in honor of fallen soldiers, and to demand our troops come home. <br /><br />I would like to hold one in Astoria, preferably in the evening on Monday, March 19th.&nbsp; Can anyone think of a good, high-visibility spot?&nbsp; Would anyone want to come?<br /><br />I think a lot of people have forgotten that it&#039;s now been FOUR YEARS that we&#039;ve been in the Iraq War.&nbsp; Thousands of Americans &amp; Iraqi &amp; Afghanis are dead.&nbsp; Let&#039;s take an hour out of our schedule to lament these losses &amp; try to help bring this war to an end.<br /><br />http://www.dfalink.com/planfourdaysofaction

				The 19th is an important date to recognize. I believe there is a vigil being held from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. in Athens Park on the 17th, too, if you are interested.

				I concur.<br /><br />We&#039;ve lost a lot of men and women in this war and we should honor them for sacrificing their lives for what they believe in and it&#039;s time to send our troops back.

				I&#039;m either going to go to the one on the 17th or the 19th.&nbsp; We have to show our support (not for Bush and what he&#039;s done) but for the soldiers who are doing their duty.&nbsp; They volunteered to protect us, unfortunately they were called to this war, we&#039;ve lost so many troops.&nbsp; I remember saying when this war started...it&#039;s another Vietnam, I remember crying, I had a feeling in my gut that it wouldn&#039;t be over soon...boy do I hate it when my gut tells me something.<br /><br />As a parent, I feel for the mothers and fathers that have lost their children.&nbsp; As a sister, I feel for the brothers and sisters that lost a sibling.&nbsp; So much loss.<br /><br />Even though many of us don&#039;t agree with this war, one thing that we should all agree on, that we have brave young men and women over there and the one&#039;s that died, died bravely, died for what they believe in, they died for this Country and our Freedom.&nbsp; <br /><br />They died for what this Country is all about...Defending What We Believe In.<br /><br />Yeah...I&#039;ll be there.<br /><br />

				I would go to the Astoria one, except for two things:<br /><br />1) I think it&#039;s important to mark the actual day.&nbsp; <br /><br />2) I know I will be drunk on St. Patrick&#039;s Day.

				I think that&#039;s cool you are going to the UES vigil, angledge.&nbsp; Also glad that there is more than one vigil happening.&nbsp; I, personally, don&#039;t care about St. Patrick&#039;s so much and don&#039;t expect to do much drinking that day. <br /><br />Thanks for letting us know about the UES vigil.&nbsp; I&#039;m hopeful both will have a good turnout!
