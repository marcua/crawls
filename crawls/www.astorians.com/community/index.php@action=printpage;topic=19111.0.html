				I went to Bohemian Beer Garden last night, and most of the tables and the walls have &quot;no smoking&quot; signs on them. They now only allow smoking in a small section of the yard. (When you walk in, facing the stage, it would be the upper left hand corner of the yard.)<br /><br />I&#039;m not surprised by this, after reading this article on Gothamist the other day about crackdowns on backyard smoking. (http://gothamist.com/2010/08/12/smoking_crackdown_outside_bars.php) I&#039;m left wondering if the beer garden took it upon themselves to implement this rule before the health dept. came around and slapped them with hefty fines. I don&#039;t know though.<br /><br />I&#039;m torn on this new policy. I mean, it&#039;s outside, who cares? However, as a person who is trying, and occasionally failing, at dropping the smoking/drinking habit, I was grateful for this last night. My smoker friends on the other hand were put out. I imagine seats in that small quadrant are going to be hard to get.

				I don&#039;t smoke, and I never have.&nbsp; That said, I have always felt that outdoor smoking bans are asinine.

				As a non smoker I think the smoking ban is great!&nbsp; Even outdoors it is annoying to be caught in the draft of a smoker.

				Having select tables for smoking is a good idea, that way those who smoke can, and those who don&#039;t want to be exposed to smoke don&#039;t have to be.

				Just a bit off-topic, but is it not a little odd that on one hand popular sentiment is increasingly moving toward legalizing marijuana whilst simultaneously stigmatizing tobacco use?&nbsp; &nbsp;:?

				I think these smoking bans are a little ridiculous. I, like many other people, do prefer to go home not smelling like smoke after going to a bar or club. <br />I do, however, think that these should be left to the discretion of the place of business. If a bar wants to allow smoking, particularly outdoors, it should be up to them to do so. If you are a person who is opposed to that, then don&#039;t patronize that venue. To mandate it legally seems a bit overkill to me.
