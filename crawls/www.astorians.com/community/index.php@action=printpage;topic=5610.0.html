				why not try Aces? or the new place Island Cafe? You could always do those yummy Sparrow burgers if its a casual thing. Seeing as how i&#039;m in the mood for pizza- i&#039;d say Michaelangelo&#039;s. damn fine food&nbsp; :-)

				Agnanti, Ploes and S&#039;Agapo all come to mind as good possibilities.&nbsp; How is Island Cafe?&nbsp; Has anyone tried it?&nbsp; I&#039;m dying to go there.

				We went to Island, the new place by Cup. Full review with pics by Wednesday morning.<br />For now:&nbsp; <br />Great bartender Brendan. Usually there fri and sat nights.&nbsp; Good Manhattan and cocktails.<br />Beautiful space, two levels and nice lighting.<br />Good people run the place and staffing seemed very good.<br />Food is off to a so so start but it seems very promising. It is the first week after all.<br />Lots of small plates and half as many mains.<br />Lots of Med. influences and perhaps some Portuguese.&nbsp; I say that because there were some dishes with chorizo or lardons with shellfish or octopus.<br />Prices were moderate to high.<br /><br />More to follow...
