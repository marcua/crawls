				Per DNA Info, the return of the the W means that there will be about 20 fewer trains per day in and out of Astoria.&nbsp; Morning and Evening rush hour scheduling remains the same<br /><br />Fewer Trains (https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20161031/ditmars/w-train-return-astoria-service-nov-7-mta)

				It&#039;s not disappointing.&nbsp; I will be taking this train.&nbsp; It will run regularly during rush hour and there will be no change in the service.&nbsp; I used to take this train.&nbsp; So many people are saying negative things about this and I dont&#039; know why.&nbsp;

				The reduction in service is not disappointing? 20 fewer trains per day in each direction is not a small reduction. Its a real decrease in scheduled service and it is not good.

				They were handing out pamphlets about the service yesterday in the train station.&nbsp; If you read it you will see it is not as bad as you think.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking forward to it.&nbsp; The reason there will be less trains running is because the W will only be going to Whitehall St. which isn&#039;t a long ride, instead of going to Coney Island.&nbsp; I will be taking this train to Rector St and am really looking forward to not having to take 2 trains anymore.&nbsp; The N will go express in the city.

				The N train will still be running so why are you complaining.&nbsp; When the W service starts on Monday I am sure that you won&#039;t see any change in the frequency of service.&nbsp; Did you happen to read the pamphlet they were handing out yesterday?&nbsp; It explained about the frequency of service for this train.

				I think the people complaining about this are people that don&#039;t even need to take the W train.&nbsp; This train is good for people who work downtown since there aren&#039;t&nbsp; any train that goes there directly.&nbsp; The N train will still be in service and will run express in the city.&nbsp; I dont&#039; see what the problem is.

				The majority of people do not travel south of 34th St. The local going to the Financial District benefits way fewer people than people that will lose scheduled service. This is basic logic. Fewer trains = bad. If you go to Rector St. you can accept fewer trains since you don&#039;t need to transfer but that is the vast exception of Astoria commuters.

				Look, since you seem to not follow basic logic, I doubt this will help 1. Midtown is a much larger employment center than lower Manhattan 2.

				I just realized where you are confused. When they say fewer trains running, they mean fewer trips. They are not referring of the actual number of trains! Of course there are fewer trains running at the route is about half as long. The amount of train trips servicing Astoria is decreasing. There will be less service in Astoria. You do realize that right?

				I only take the train late to go home a handful of times a year and each time it&#039;s been packed. Main reason is the wait is usually half an hour or longer. If I recall I always just miss a train, and I end up waiting a long time for the next one. If the MTA decides to run even less trains late at night I may resort to taking a cab home instead.

If the MTA decides to run even less trains late at night I may resort to taking a cab home instead.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Use Google Maps.&nbsp; They are remarkably accurate about when a train will get to a station (at least for the N late at night).

				What has been going on at Ditmars? I take the train early rush 7ish and the service has been as bad and unpredictable as it has always been. Is it worse later?
