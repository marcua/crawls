				Hi there:<br /><br />I know it&#039;s a bit early for June but figured someone might know of something coming up. We are looking to move back to the Ditmars area (within PS 122 zone) when our current lease runs out at the end of May. <br /><br />We have a 2.5 year-old and another due in Sept so would obviously prefer a 3-bed; however, willing to consider a 2-bed if it&#039;s a decent size and layout. Because of the impending arrival, we&#039;d rather not deal with more than one flight of stairs due to stroller etc. We used to live at Ditmars and 21st and would love to go back to that general area. <br /><br />If you hear of anything or need more information, please let me know. We&#039;d really appreciate it. Otherwise, I&#039;ll just post again in at the end of next month. <br /><br />Thanks in advance.<br /><br />

				Will be difficult to find a 3BR around there unless someone is renting out the entire house.&nbsp; When I was looking for a 3BR they seemed incredibly hard to come by.

				Yeah, I figured that. I&#039;ve seen a few on craigslist but reckon a lot of them are bait and switch or not in that area. We&#039;re willing to go with a two bedroom if it&#039;s big enough or has a workable layout. Fingers crossed. Thanks.

				Whats your price range for a 3 bedroom or a 2 bedroom ?&nbsp; Would you consider renting out the first floor of a house , cuz like the other poster mentioned , 3 bedrooms are hard to find , esp in that area .&nbsp; I know upper Ditmars has&nbsp; 3 bedrooms&nbsp; , but you would have to drive straight down Ditmars to get to PS122.

				Range is 1800-2100. Would consider a floor of a house. Don&#039;t want to go to upper ditmars as being near the park is also one of the things we like. I know, we have our work cut out.

				For $2100 you might be able to get a floor with 3 bedrooms ,&nbsp; but to get a first floor duplex( bedrooms on the 2nd floor) might be kinda tough .&nbsp; That would also give you the backyard and possibly a basement ( finished or unfinished )&nbsp; &nbsp;.&nbsp; Getting a duplex would pretty much give you 3 bedrooms since most houses built like that do have 3 bedrooms on the 2nd floor .&nbsp; &nbsp; $1800&nbsp; more or less gives you 2 bedrooms and sometimes , the 2nd is cut so small its more of a small office .&nbsp; &nbsp; I know 28st and&nbsp; Ditmars has some of the largest homes near that are , and its close to the park too .&nbsp; &nbsp;Going up the block(hill ) twds the left side the houses are even bigger so the rooms are cut larger .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I know its tricky&nbsp; &nbsp;but&nbsp; its good you started looking from now .&nbsp; &nbsp;With kids and babies&nbsp; its hard to find everything one might want .

				if you want to be in PS 122 zone, don&#039;t go past 29th Street.&nbsp; and, if you find two, let us know as we are also looking :-D
