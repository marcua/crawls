				Well my foodie friends, its never to early to think about food huh?&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />Carrying on with our &quot;help save local businesses&quot; theme from August (it went sooo super) i am proposing we hit Ali&#39;s Kabab Cafe. Some have tossed the idea around and i couldn&#39;t be happier with that option. So what that we get yummy exotic Egyptian cuisine 2 months in a row! Its for the greater good of the hood <em>yo</em>&nbsp; :-P<br />hahaha<br />I am writing this with a full belly of some loverly filet of sole, grilled veggies and rice from Ali right now,so heck yeah i&#39;m pro going there!!!!!<br /><br />I spoke to him tonight about it. <strong>Sunday Sept. 24th 2pm</strong>. i think we max&nbsp; out the space at 20 we can maybe push it to 22-24? $30 each and he&#39;ll feed us till he runs out of food! hahaha no really its a cut and dry $30 no adding tax and tip-its all in there. Again its byob, so you know the drill. I was even thinking of talking to him about bringing plastic plates <em>(i don&#39;t want to make it cheesey or anything)</em> so he wouldn&#39;t have to wash so many dishes before his dinner rush, you know? We can bring our own music even, party central!!!!<br /><br />So yeah, its nothing set in stone- but its a go if we decide on a yes. Would love to love him that day big time.<br /><br />What do you say?<br /><br />

				well it was weird cause once i told him the reason why, he looked kind of happy but like weird cause he wouldn&#39;t want us to think he didnt want to use the plates. i just told him, i&#39;d rather he enjoy the day and be able to handle the dinner crowd without spending an hour cleaning.&nbsp; but i&#39;ll check for sure with him on tues when i go tell him exactly how many of us there are. oh and are there any vegetarians i should be aware of so he fixes a veggie plate or two?

				That was just fabulous.&nbsp; I think I was still full this morning.&nbsp; I&#39;ve tried to come up with the dishes (of course, I don&#39;t know the proper names of most of them, even if Ali did shout them out at the time):<br /><br />Dish of harissa (spicy condiment)<br />Sesame and plain bread sticks<br />1. Marinated sardines<br />2. Stuffed grape leaves with dill and pine nuts<br />3. Two deep fried thingys (<em>fatiya </em> (fuh-TEE-uh)?), one meat, one cheese. Both wrapped in phyllo dough and deep fried.<br />4. Octopus with potato and lemon<br />5. Baby eggplants stuffed with a loose mixture of rice, meat and spices<br />6. Meze plate: hummus, a deeply smokey baba ganoush, and foul.&nbsp; Served with a garnish of deep fried escarole (wow!).&nbsp; Also with falafel, served with warm pita.<br />7. Kofte - ground lamb (and beef?) stuffed with pine nuts and raisins, formed into elongated meatballs, served with a tangy yogurt sauce.<br />8. A dish with two other thingys on it: One was served in wedges, and was sort of like an Egyptian frittata (<em>eggah</em>?), possibly containing finely ground veggies, with a slow, sneaky heat. There was a thin layer of coconut cream on the top of this. The other thingy was with potatoes, chickpeas, turmeric, and was also kind of in a cake form. I don&#39;t know what bound it.<br /><br />The three main courses:<br /><br />9. Apricot chicken. Oh.my.god. It literally melted in your mouth - both the chicken and the apricot. The dried apricot melted. The chicken melted. Wow. I think this was my favourite dish.<br />10. Lamb shank. Served with rice. Tender, falling off the bone.<br />11. Thick, incredibly tender strips of beef with a very tangy flavour. At this point I could hardly take another bite, but I took several.<br />
