				I know this may be a silly thread, but I thought it might be interesting to share any unlucky occurrence of the day. I&#039;ll start mine now.<br /><br />I parked my car this morning on 28th street. I then walked toward the Ditmars station on this sunny summer morning, minding my own business, chatting up with my husband when the wierdest thing happened. A sudden boom filled the air, everyone looks around since it sounded like a shot. In that instant I fall to the floor after feeling the sharpest pain on the outside of my right calf. <br /><br />Well here&#039;s the thing. Apparently, a van began to pull out of it&#039;s parking spot and it ran over a plastic water bottle. The weight of the van caused so much pressure that the bottle broke and the top portion with the cap in tack shot out with such force and shot right into my leg. When I pulled my hand away from the painful area, there appeared a perfectly round purple burning welt on my leg. And right next to me was lying the evidence itself. (Oh, of all days I wore a skirt).<br /><br />I mean, what are the chances that this bottle would break, the cap pointing in my direction, move with such lightning speed and still hit a target onto my leg while I was actually moving. It burned all the way to work. Thankfully, all that&#039;s left is a red spot on my leg which is sure to disappear in a couple of days. <br /><br />My husbands words to me? &quot;Wow, now that&#039;s really bad luck&quot;. I mean, really, you think?

				That sucks. Hope your leg is doing much better.<br /><br />Some people just sort of have that kind of luck. My bad luck seems to always revolve around pigeons. I was walking a few years back with my husband under the N/W train and just as I walked under the train a pigeon pooped on my glasses some got in my eye and I ended up getting conjunctivitis (pinkeye). I still don&#039;t think I have fully recovered from the trauma of that.&nbsp; :-D

				The leg is much better thanks. I guess the universe felt pretty bad so the planets have alligned as to not allow a permanent mark. <br /><br />May you all have some better luck today. I&#039;ll watch out for the birds, I&#039;ll keep my eyes on the ground, I&#039;ll watch for any cars pulling away from the curb, and I&#039;ll check my car everday to make sure the plates are still on. <br /><br />I&#039;m covered.

I recall telling them that walking is actually good for you. Well, in a split second after that, I awkwardly (Steve Urkel style) tripped and fell to the floor with a thump onto my tush. I don&#039;t know what hurt more; the actual fall or my ego. Yes, everyone laughed and of course, to save the last of my pride, I too chimed in. So much for the benefits of walking.
