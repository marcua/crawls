				Yes, that&#039;s part of the deal that Mayor Bloomberg is forcing on the taxi owners and drivers, and he has the nerve to call it entertainment.&nbsp; Madison Avenue has a word for it: captive marketing.&nbsp; Is there any way we passengers (actual or potential) can protest this?

				Well, will the TV&#039;s be on all the time, or would the passenger have the ability to turn it off or turn the sound down?&nbsp; If none of those options exist, then I would have to say that the plan somewhat resembles the telescreens George Orwell wrote about in 1984, which also never turned off and were omnipresent.

				Seems like a waste of money. Considering most cab rides aren&#039;t all that long, I don&#039;t see this as necessary or even all that great. I like paying attention to what my cab driver is doing, also, and a TV would take my attention off the road and where he&#039;s going. I did happen to end up in a cab that seemed to have the whole GPS/TV system set up once, and frankly it seemed more weird than good.

				The other week I actually got a taxi ride in a cab with one of the new GPS systems installed...it was really cool. It&#039;s a touch screen...the passenger has control over, volume, TV station, viewing map, etc. You are able to site back and relax and catch-up on the weather or breaking news. Plus my favorite part...at your destination you can pick either cash or credit card, add in the tip, and print a receipt!!!

				You can turn the tvs off pretty easily and they do come with the added features of how to pay and a gps map.&nbsp; You can also look up all the tax bill of rights info onthem, but in much bigger print than the current sticker.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure you can also watch the meter on the screen except bigger.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is hardly 1984, particularly compared to the things that the Bush Administration is doing.

				I am less concerned about the TV function than I am about the credit card function. If your card doesn&#039;t pass muster, what are you supposed to do? For that matter, what is the cab driver supposed to do? I think the all cash system avoided these kinds of headaches.

				I&#039;ve both paid by credit card and turned off the tv in the cabs.&nbsp; I liked the gps map - I think that will be good for tourists.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t really any bother as you can turn it off if you want, though I&#039;d imagine the poor cab drivers would prefer it to be less noisy.

				I will let you know as soon as I hear from him, because that article made me curious.&nbsp; The problems with Verifone make sense, because as the article points out, it&#039;s hard to get signal between tall buildings.&nbsp; But I wonder why they would link the meter to the GPS.&nbsp; The meters in taxis have worked for 100 years without the benefit of GPS, and I thought the GPS was supposed to be for purposes other than metering.&nbsp; I am definitely curious to see what he says.

				The important thing is that you can turn it off.&nbsp; That hasn&#039;t always been true in other cities.

				Good morning, all.&nbsp; Ladywithpans, the potentially obtrusive TV screen/GPS screen, etc. can be turned off from the view of the passenger.&nbsp; So that is a good thing, as it leaves viewing the screen as a matter of free choice.&nbsp; But what is at issue right now is whether or not the GPS technology is linked to the fare meter, and whether the credit card reader will actually work.&nbsp; My friend who worked for a few years for TLC got back to me:<br /><br /><strong>As far as I know GPS is not tied to the meter’s charge, but GPS and meter info may be transmitted together to the TLC – not sure.&nbsp; <br /><br />The credit card reception issue may be a real problem, but cabbies may be able to move a few feet in a direction to re-establish connection.</strong><br /><br />Sorry that he wasn&#039;t more conclusive.&nbsp; I will see if there is anyone else I can ask.&nbsp; Sounds like the credit card reader will be a problem as far as everyone is concerned, but I still don&#039;t get why the meter would be connected to the GPS technology.&nbsp; Maybe to verify that the car traveled the distance claimed by the meter?

				The all-important question is whether you can turn it off.&nbsp; If you can, I&#039;d rather have it in a taxi.&nbsp; In a subway car, <em>someone</em> will be watching it.
