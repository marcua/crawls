				There are about 9,000 gyms in Astoria.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure most of them have free weights.&nbsp; <br /><br />I belong to Astoria Sports Complex because it&#039;s super cheap.&nbsp; ($159/year)&nbsp; It ain&#039;t fancy but it gets the job done and it&#039;s not normally too crowded.&nbsp; It&#039;s on 38th Street and 35th Ave.&nbsp; 718-729-7163

				On the other end (of the scale both in location and price) is The Rock.<br />It is the 1st Gym I joined where I had to consult both with my Doctor and Accountant before signing on with :mrgreen:

				The Rock is running a deal for Sept. where they waive the $199 initiation fee.<br />I think now it&#039;s $950/year. <br /><br />But check your insurance at work. The Rock works with Global Fit and you can<br />get a discount on the annual fee. In fact, whatever gym you join you should check<br />with your insurance if you have Global Fit before you sign/join. GF, if your company<br />has it, can get you lower rates with a lot of clubs - even Curves.<br /><br />

				http://therockhealthandfitness.com/<br />Prices are on the web site.&nbsp; I&#039;m a member of Oxford insurance, and they have a discount program called WellQuest that is similar to Global Fit.&nbsp; My fee is only $57 a month, and I can quit anytime.&nbsp;

				Synergy is a good cheap gym.&nbsp; It&#039;s on Broadway and Crescent. Has free weights and such, but fairly bare bones.&nbsp; The employees are nice and offer free advice.&nbsp; I like that everyone keeps to themselves and I don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m being digested when I go there.&nbsp; I think I pay about $35/ month.
