			Ok, I'll go.<br /><br />I'm in my late twenties and have lived in Astoria a year and a half (Manhattan 2 years prior to that). &nbsp;I'm a web developer for a non-profit and telecommute (mostly from the Freeze Peach). &nbsp;I'm sometimes the unofficial social coordinator for the Freeze -- and I'll be running the second annual Freeze Peach branch of National Novel Writing Month in November.

			I'm Matt. I work at Freeze Peach as a barista and I also work for a non-profit &nbsp;part time.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I moved to the New York area in 2001, and then Astoria in 2002. I love Astoria! Just last month we got married. I'm 28.<br /><br />My hobbies are: aviation, ham radio, computers, philosophy, genaric spirituality, experimental (even psudo) science, science fiction, star trek, linux &amp; unix, poker, new ideas &amp; brainstorming, and I'm sure others I'm not thinking of.<br /><br />I have one cat named Pixel and I'm currently trying to train him to use the toilet instead of a litter box but so far he hasn't figured it out.

			I'm Telesphoros and I just recently moved to the area. &nbsp;I'm sarcastic and mysterious as well as flummoxed at the moment and find the area charming and friendly. &nbsp;I like the mix of people and the cut of your jib, yaaaaaargh.<br /><br />I would love to attend a gaming night but it has been inconveniently deposited on Friday night and with Battlestar Galactica starting it's new season this week, I'm unsure I will be giving up that addiction any time in the near future to learn a new RPG.<br /><br />I will however be scouring the site to keep abreast of the goings on and will from time to time join in. :mrgreen:

			OK. &nbsp;I'm Robyn and I just sort of hang around a lot. &nbsp;I'm a low-level dilberta for a major corporation and I do bad things to good plants. &nbsp;When I'm happy and in love with the world I cook. &nbsp;<br /><br />I run intermittently with the astoria cool runners group.<br /><br />I read.<br /><br />I go to the opera.<br /><br />Most importantly, my favorite tea right now is 1/2 peppermint and 1/2 black, with honey, over ice. &nbsp;It cools me off faster than anything else.

			Welcome, megc. &nbsp;I hope you love Astoria as much as I do.<br /><br />I've lived in New York all my life and in southern Astoria for 14 years. &nbsp;I consider myself very fortunate in having found this neighborhood. &nbsp;I'm 57 years old, an alumna of SUNY-Stony Brook, and a librarian in Harlem.<br /><br />I love to cook and I love the food here in Astoria. &nbsp;I love cats but don't have one at present. &nbsp;I love classical music and wish there were more of it on the radio; my favorite composer is Bach. &nbsp;I like classic movies in revival houses. &nbsp;<br /><br />I like reading about history and politics and recently attended a MoveOn house party. &nbsp;I can play a mean game of Trivial Pursuit except that I'm woefully ignorant of today's popular culture.
