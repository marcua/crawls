				hey all!<br />i just moved here from FL and am always looking for someone to jam/goto shows/drink with. i love metal and any other music thats not country. ive played guitar for a number of years and am not looking for anything serious, just hanging out/jamming. i live at steinway and ditmars, and from looking at other posts, it looks like other musicians live around here too. if anyone reading this is interested in me, i also love digital graphics(3d, flash, ps) and am an avid gamer. anyone fitting these interests should definitely add to this post, bc im know im not alone in Astoria!<br /><br />www.scottschafferdesign.com<br /><br />peace<br />~scott

				<br />you should check out astoria sound works on 23rd avenue near steinway.<br /><br />whenever I rehearse there, I hear tons of metal bands practicing, and they have a bulletin board (a real one, not a virtual one) where people post musicians wanted ads.

				Hey!<br /><br />Well, although I&#039;m not a big fan of some metal... I&#039;m pretty into Ministry, Chemlab and Skinny Puppy (et al) ...so I guess I like industrial that has metal moments.<br /><br />So I&#039;d be a concert buddy for some things maybe haha<br /><br />my public aim is : stardustredux

				xbox 360 is clearly better for gaming and online play . if u want to watch bluray movies then ps3 is a good deal....till 360 comes out with a bluray attachment which is in the works .

				there is actually a really awesome show on sept. 2. The Red Chord and Underoath are with The Number Twelve Looks Like You @ Fillmore NY at Irving Plaza. I have seen The Red Chord and Underoath a few times before and they are brutal! If you love extreme metal (as I do), come to this show. To sample The Red Chord, check out their myspace @ http://www.myspace.com/theredchord.&nbsp; The show is at 8pm, doors at 7pm. If anyone wants to meet up there... lemme know!<br /><br /><br />@ PJ: thanx for the compliment on my site!&nbsp; &nbsp; also... i am biased toward PCGaming. Ive built every rig ive owned, so i have to take pride in gaming on my rigs. thats not to say i dont love 360, wii, and ps3!
