				Article features several pages on where to eat, party, shop, and places to see in Astoria.&nbsp; If I owned rental property I&#039;d be happy about this, but since I&#039;m a rentee and not a rentor, this might not be a good thing.<br /><br />But hey, I&#039;m all for meeting new people and whatnot.&nbsp; So if it brings fresh new faces to the &#039;hood, then it&#039;s good.<br /><br />Article begins on page 21...<br /><br />http://longisland.newsday.com/gallery/galleries/amny/pdf/20091015.pdf<br /><br />What do you guys think of all the publicity Astoria&#039;s been getting lately?

				It&#039;s nice to be recognized but enough already!! Yeah, I agree as a property owner it must be awesome, but really, why must every decent neighborhood be touted as The Next Big Thing just b/c it&#039;s relatively decent?!<br /><br />Everything about this city is overhyped and branded for marketing purposes. Everybody is supposed to be in debt up to their ears and beholden to the banks, so if you&#039;re able to afford rent in a place you WANT to live, then there&#039;s a problem of some kind. Some developer has to capitalize on that.<br /><br />Does that answer your question?&nbsp; :wink:

				No, but that&#039;s about when it all started, and now we&#039;ve got the luxury high-rises taking over, plus the high rents. Back then, it was a dorky place to be, and nobody cared.

				Even worse than saying you lived in Astoria was saying you lived in Long Island City.&nbsp; You would get asked either: Is that on Long Island? or Do you live in a factory?&nbsp; Two of the reasons I started saying I lived in Astoria.<br /><br />I have always said of our area, it has all the advantages of being in Manhattan without having to <em>be</em> in Manahattan.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure there are developers who would love to pave the river.

				Just started reading, and already there is a mistake. One of the boundaries given is 50th street to the <em>West</em>. In the first place, the boundary of Astoria is 48th street, at least by Broadway. Bryant HS is in the 11103 zip, but 48th st is 11377. The Woodside Houses start on 48th street(I grew up there). Plus that is the <em>Eastern</em> boundary in any case. Perhaps it&#039;s minor, but I hate those kinds of mistakes, it shows a lack of a good proofreader, if nothing else.

				Boogie, I live on 49th st. and my zip is 11103. But the trade fair between 49th and 50th on 30th ave is considered 11377, so I&#039;d say listing 50th street as a boundary isn&#039;t that off the mark...I&#039;m not sure how much the boundary changes as you move closer to Broadway though, as you mentioned...<br /><br /><br />Btw, hello everyone...long time lurker, first time poster!

				People accuse me of being nostalgic about the Astoria of ten or fifteen years ago. But I submit that anyone who thinks this is still a real neighborhood, a place where sane (that is to say, uncool and unhip) people would want to raise their kids, is indeed nostalgic for a neighborhood that no longer exists. Thanks to overdevelopment and the unfortunate trendy labels that have been attached&nbsp; to it by twentysomethings looking for a cheaper place to crash and dorm, what was once a vibrant urban village of families and small businesses has become a college town without the college: You&#039;ll notice that there&#039;s no bookstore in sight. There&#039;s nothing hip and cool about garbage, graffiti, cracked sidewalks, traffic scofflaws and a general atmosphere of filth, slop and noise, unless you&#039;re here to live out your urban fantasies, that is. All this became evident when I invited some of my Manhattan friends to dinner one night, and, as we were walking through the shantytown of 23rd Avenue, one asked: &quot;Hey, is this neighborhood safe?&quot;

				Something people might wish to remember: Astoria is a very large area. I live on 30th ave in the 40&#039;s, which is a very long way from 23rd ave and 31st st, or even Ditmars and Steinway. A block or two can make a huge difference in what one&#039;s attitudes are about the neighborhood. These &quot;college town&quot; generalizations only really apply to a few blocks of certain streets, mostly on the weekends. It&#039;s for sure that not every block is going to be perfect, or the best block to be on all the time. I have lived in Manhattan(Second ave in the low 80&#039;s), which really is &quot;frat city&quot; a lot of the time. There is really no comparison. On the other hand, I&#039;m not trying to raise kids here, either.

				I always have held positive associations with the idea of &quot;college towns&quot;:&nbsp; Berkeley, Cambridge, Ann Arbor, Austin.&nbsp; Lovely places, all.&nbsp; I am also confident that the Astoria Of Yore was not perfect either.<br /><br />As far as parents running for the hills when confronted with the idea of raising their kids in Astoria, that is simply not the case.&nbsp; In fact, I have noticed a lot more people with strollers and baby carriers of all kinds.&nbsp; Has anyone else noticed this?&nbsp; Lots of cute babies in this town.&nbsp; In the summer sometimes there is are a plethora of children that play on my block.&nbsp; They like to hang out together into the late afternoon and evening - I can also hear them and their families later in the evening spending time with each other on their patios/porches.<br /><br />Over the years, I&#039;ve lived in both big and small cities (including the suburbs of California, the Midwest, and Long Island), and I can assure you that &quot;garbage, graffiti, cracked sidewalks, and traffic scofflaws&quot; can be found most places.&nbsp; As far as the &quot;filth, slop and noise&quot;, though, what are you doing about it?&nbsp; How are you working to improve your community with regard to these three elements?&nbsp; Are you simply bitching and complaining on an internet message board or are you going to do something about the flaws you see?

				Where do you get college town from? We are pretty far from any major college in this city. Have you been to Greenwich Village on a Saturday night? Now that would be the equivalent of a college town.<br /><br />Were you walking down the street on garbage night? If so, there will be garbage bags on the sidewalk, duh. Also what does a bookstore have to do with anything? <br /><br />If this is such a &quot;bad&quot; neighborhood, maybe it&#039;s time for you to go find a new neighborhood? Let me know what you find that&#039;s better and safer than Astoria.

				I&nbsp; had no idea Astoria was so full of comedians.&nbsp; Pretty cool!<br /><br />I find it interesting to note that when I moved here 11 years ago, I chose it based on its affordability and because the amount of young people here reminded me of the village.&nbsp; I lived in Greenwich and East Village for four years for NYU, and I wanted to live in an area that was full of things to do, and that was very convenient to everything.&nbsp; Astoria&#039;s been up and coming since I moved here.&nbsp; I love its diversity and the food is amazing.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have a lot of friends here and I don&#039;t tend to go out in Manhattan much.<br /><br />Might be good to note that AMNY reports on a different neighborhood every thursday.&nbsp; It&#039;s an ongoing section in their newspaper.&nbsp; I think last week was all about Forest Hills.&nbsp; They cover every neighborhood they possibly can.
