				So since it looks like I&#39;ll be off work for some time til I find another gig, I decided to start jogging.&nbsp; Astoria Park is great for this, I had no idea how peaceful it was to run by the water.&nbsp; I never jogged before - just what do you do with your keys?&nbsp; Where can I find shorts with pockets, and some sort of thing to put your keys in?&nbsp; I am a horribly slow runner, and took millions of breaks, and my joints got all cramped, but I want to make a good faith effort to keep at this!&nbsp; Perhaps I will improve with time?&nbsp; Would anyone like to join me?&nbsp; Of course those more advanced joggers will be leaving me in their dust!&nbsp; I&#39;m thinking weekday mornings 8 or 9am?&nbsp; Switching to nights when I finally get a job I guess....

				You can get a small pouch that secures to your running shoes to keep your keys safe.<br />There is one that straps to your upper arm, too. I found them at NIKETOWN but you can also get it at Modell&#39;s or Sports authority.

				Hi, Daisy! Nike does sell running shorts with a back pocket for keys. I found my pair at the Sports Authority on Northern Boulevard. Another thing I do is to tie my keys into my shoelaces. (Make sure you doubleknot if you do this, though)<br /><br />Unfortunately I cannot join you as I have to get up earlier to run (I&#39;m out there by 7:15am). <br /><br />P.S. If your joints get cramped, perhaps you are running at a pace that is too fast for you. When starting out as runner, it&#39;s good to use the &quot;talk test&quot;. This means that you should be running at a&nbsp; pace at which you could carry on a reasonable conversation without being too winded to speak. I&#39;m not saying you should be able to deliver a Shakespearean soliloquy, but you should be able to carry on a conversation. Just a tip....

				Thanks for the tips!&nbsp; I thought I was running pretty darn slow actually so I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s up with all the cramps.&nbsp; Maybe I&#39;m just not used to running, this was my first time trying, other than on the elliptical at the gym, which is very different.&nbsp; But the talk test is good to know&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />Now what&#39;s this &quot;couch to 5K&quot;?&nbsp; Never heard of it.&nbsp; Website?&nbsp; Store?<br /><br />Cool, I&#39;ll stop by the Sports Authority or Modell&#39;s soon.

				Couch to 5k (http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml) is a program for beginning runners on a running website called Cool Running (http://www.coolrunning.com/).&nbsp; I can attest that it works - it took a couple of starts, but I did it, and I&#39;m still running a year later, never having been a runner in my life.&nbsp; A group of us that met up on Astorians actually have an Astoria Cool Running Yahoo group - if you&#39;d like to join, pm me and I&#39;ll send you an invite.&nbsp; We&#39;re a bit scattered these days, but we do often run in the morning, although these days I&#39;m running around 7:15 because of my work schedule.&nbsp; We generally go to the track in Astoria Park.

				Thanks! The Media Challenge is in Central Park. Twice around the lower loop. <br /><br />And when I up my mileage I suppose I could run down to the park. I live even farther from it (45th and 34th Ave). I DID have a crazy idea of running a half-marathon this year. Hmmm.....

				What time do you run? I&#39;m new, and while I think a big part of my run will be to/from the park, I&#39;m already jogging in the morning (jogging or &#39;y&#39;ogging, it might be a soft &#39;j&#39;). Park jogging sounds more idyllic, so I&#39;ll be around - look for the pale blonde guy of medium build who looks like every other pale blonde guy of medium build who has ever lived. ;)<br />Tim

				Have you tried just holding the keys in your hand?&nbsp; I have my keys on a simple ring keychain, and that is what I do.&nbsp; Of course, *ahem* I don&#39;t run very far so they don&#39;t get in the way.&nbsp; I also think tying just the keys you need to get back into the house on your shoelaces is brilliant.

				When I jog without pockets, I remove my front door and apartment keys from my main ring and tie them into my laces, tucking the key points under the other lace strands.&nbsp; It works very well.<br /><br />I also jog holding my cell phone in my hand, mostly so I can use the time display on it to give me a rough pace.

				I don&#39;t jog (bad knees), but I do try to go walking 4-ish miles a day, and if I don&#39;t feel like carrying my keys, I&#39;ll just carry my mailbox key on one keyring, and I&#39;ll put the rest in my mailbox. (I usually walk in the morning or evening though, not when mail&#39;s supposed to come, although I don&#39;t think that the mail carrier would take them or anything.)

				Do any of you runners do the Komen Race For The Cure? I&#39;ve been doing it the last few years (since they began allowing men to run it along with the women) and it&#39;s a great event. I always end up raising a lot of money to help fight breast cancer and having a real good time. It&#39;s in Central Park. It will be held September 10 this year. If any of you are also running it, maybe we can meet up before the race!

				daisy, you might like this google map hack for figuring out the length of your route:<br /><br />http://www.gmap-pedometer.com<br /><br />And the coolrunning.com running log feature is pretty excellent for keeping track.&nbsp; LOVE. IT.<br /><br />I also run down from my house to the park, and then run through it.&nbsp; I am utterly disenchanted by the track, as I find it boring and way too hot on one side.&nbsp; I love running around the park and through it, maximizing the amount of shade I run under.&nbsp; I also like the fact that the park is hilly, and hills help me get back into shape faster.&nbsp; Good luck with your running, daisy!<br /><br />P.S. The Madison Ave Mile run is September 30!&nbsp; Fun!

				I&#039;m happy to find a forum for runners on this site!&nbsp; I&#039;ve been running solo over the past few years and haven&#039;t gone on many runs with other people since high school cross country and track and field.&nbsp; Although, I have been looking to run with someone else recently as my routine is starting to become a little monotonous and I could use the change of pace to keep up my motivation.&nbsp; Lately I&#039;ve been running about a half hour (a little over 3 miles) four times a week usually in Astoria Park and the surrounding area.&nbsp; I typically go at around 7pm on weeknights and late in the morning on weekends.

				There&#039;s always the streets - I used Google Ped (http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/) to caclulate distances until I got my GPS.<br /><br />But better than that is the regulation track (http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/park_of_the_month/2005_07/html/astoria_park.html) in Astoria Park.&nbsp; It&#039;s a 1/4 mile track with a rubberised running surface.&nbsp; It&#039;s completely free and open to the public.&nbsp; It&#039;s close to the intersection of 21st St. and Hoyt Avenue, right next to the Triborough Bridge.<br /><br />astoriantobe - I&#039;ve gone jogging as early as 6:30 in summer months, and I&#039;ve never had a problem.&nbsp; I live near Ditmars and 31st St., and I usually head to Astoria Park and sometimes tack on a loop around Ralph Demarco Park, which is the little strip that extends north from Astoria Park along the water.&nbsp; I&#039;ve set it up so that I have a 3 mile round trip to the entrance to the Astoria Park track, and then I tack on however many laps I need to get up to the miles I want.&nbsp; I also have a 4 and 5 mile loop to the track mapped out.
