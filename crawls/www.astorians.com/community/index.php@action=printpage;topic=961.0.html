				The Museum of the Moving Image (http://www.movingimage.us) is showing my all-time favorite film, so I thought to ask everyone here: what's your favorite film?<br /><br />Note, I didn't say &quot;films&quot;. Try to choose just one. No lists! (I'll save that for another thread :wink:)<br /><br />Simple, but not easy, is it?<br /><br />Mine: <strong>2001: A Space Odyssey</strong>, Stanley Kubrick's anti-romance about space exploration and the role of humanity in a shrinking universe.<br /><br />Why? Nothing I've seen so perfectly captures an entire experience -- in this case, space exploration -- so vividly on film. He's telling us that life is out there, note that cataract of the ova-like eclipsed sun in the first shot. But mankind may not be prepared (or want) to meet it. Even the spaceship Discovery, charged with sending formerly Earth-bound life into the deeps of space, looks like a sperm.<br /><br />The film has special effects that, almost 40 years later, still stand out as ground-breaking, and constantly remind us that man is unfit for space travel, unless he puts his survival in the hands of his own creation -- technology and machines. And in trying to survive and live in the void, man becomes alienated from his humanness...<br /><br />It postulates many difficult questions, and few answers. Physically fragile and minimized in the vast void of space, man can only come to know of the greater universe through the graces(?) of an unknown race of intelligent beings. But guide us to what? Servitude like animals in a zoo or toward a higher state of being?<br /><br />For me, there's no other film that exhibits pure cinematic genius as this.<br /><br />Your turn...

				These are great responses, thanks! Keep 'em coming.<br /><br />And don't be shy about letting on what makes your film #1 in your book. Is it the writing, the way it's shot, the characters, the setting? What kind of emotional pull do you feel from it?

				My favorite:<br /><br />hmm.<br /><br />for a while &nbsp;it was &quot;American Beauty&quot;.<br /><br />I like &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; but not enough for it to be my favorite.<br /><br />I really haven't seen many movies, which is why I say I lack expertise. &nbsp;I think one deciding factor is whether or not the film can stand repeated viewings, and since I didn't start going to movies or renting them until I was, I don't know, 22? I haven't tried for many repeat viewings. &nbsp;<br /><br />Thomas Crowne Affair was good too.

				I like this film alot and it has withstood the test of repetitive viewings.<br />I just like the conversations, especially the secret service men at the end; and I think that when Emilio Estevez takes his pants down in the UFO museum that this is a classically all-time funny moment in film history.<br />Even though the characters are somewhat &quot;out-there&quot; they do seem to me to be pretty realistic.<br /><br />http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087995/<br /><br />@Daveed: This is a great topic.

				It's actually the inspiration behind &quot;City of Angels&quot; except that it's actually good.<br /><br />It's about an angel who becomes fascinated with human experience and choses to give up immortality and be human. <br /><br />It's looong but worth it. &nbsp;i can loan it to you if you're interested (I have VHS)

				One more point about Superman...<br /><br />After seeing Deliverence several years ago, I had a hard time with the Superman movies because of Ned Beatty. &nbsp;&quot;Squeel&quot; &nbsp;Ugh. &nbsp;That movie scarred me. &nbsp;Everytime Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) yelled at him, I thought Otis (Ned Beatty) was going to start squealing like a pig.

				Nights of Cabiria--hands down!<br /><br />It has beauty, pathos, style, Giulietta Masina, and the music of Nino Rota.<br /><br />I've seen it 7 times since I was 16. &nbsp;Maybe 8. &nbsp;The last time it had new subtitles.<br /><br />And oh yes, cabanird, if Dr. Zhivago didn't have a soundtrack it would be a silent film &nbsp;:) <br /><br />Speaking of music, my favorite part of 2001 is the scene of the space station, with the Blue Danube Waltz.

				Jtrane, refresh my memory--who was Otis in Superman II?<br /><br />That was a good movie. &nbsp;My favorite aspect of it was the light touch with which Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder played the two principals, setting the precedent for Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher on TV. &nbsp;My least favorite departure from the comic book was when Lara said that without his super-powers Clark would be mortal. &nbsp;Everyone who read the comic book knew that Superman would eventually die.<br /><br />But what was creepy to me about that movie was Terence Stamp as General Zod. &nbsp;This was the actor who had played the saintly Billy Budd, the innocent John Soames and the lovable cad Alfie (on Broadway). &nbsp;Now he was playing a totally horrid, diabolical villain with super-powers and without a sympathetic bone in his body.<br /><br />James Dickey, who was primarily a poet, told an interviewer that he was not a fiction writer because the only thing he could think of with a plot was Deliverance.

				Otis was Lex Luthor's bumbling side kick. &nbsp;Ned Beaty is the actor who plays him. &nbsp;He was also the poor soul in Deliverance that was ravaged by the bayou folk. &nbsp;But Terence Stamp is a great actor. &nbsp;He's done some good stuff in the last few years. &nbsp;I love his cocney(sp) accent.

				Another good food movie is Big Night. &nbsp;Mostly Martha is also cute, but a little sentimental. &nbsp;Eat, Drink, Man, Woman is also great. &nbsp;There's one called Woman on Top with Penelope Cruz. &nbsp;She's adorable, but the movie is mediocre at best.<br /><br />I hear Vatel is good, but I haven't seen it. &nbsp;<br /><br />I can't say what movie is my FAVORITE. &nbsp;I have to make a short list. &nbsp;I'm waiting for that thread to open.

				My favorite film is The Shawshank Redemption. &nbsp;Has been for a number of years now. &nbsp;There are others that I truely enjoy at different moments in my life. &nbsp;But there's something lasting about Shawshank.<br /><br />Get busy living, or get busy dying.

				I would have to say:<br /><br /><em>Amelie</em><br /><em>Bleu (Kieslowski)</em><br /><em>All About My Mother</em><br /><em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em><br /><em>Annie Hall</em><br /><br />This too is a list. &nbsp; :shock: &nbsp; However, the ones I watch incessantly are <em>Dave</em> and <em>Sabrina</em> (the remake...)

I love his cocney(sp) accent.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I don't think Lex Luthor was in Superman II--he wasn't needed because those 3 supervillains from Krypton were all the menace anyone could want. &nbsp;As for Terence Stamp: one thing a good actor can do is win your heart by playing characters who are good or at least likable in spite of not being good, then turn around and give you the creeps by playing someone totally hateful. &nbsp;Terence Stamp did that; so did Gregory Peck and Russell Crowe.

				OK, my bad. &nbsp;Luthor was dwarfed in my mind by those three horrible aliens. &nbsp;I still maintain that with those three running (or flying) around, who needs Luthor?

Un. Bee. Lee. Vable. What an incredible experience. Your brain really focuses on what's <em>not</em> being said -- all the non-verbal storytelling, the sound f/x, and so on. There's simply nothing like it.

				Queen Margot. &nbsp;I've only seen it twice, once in the theatre and once on VHS. &nbsp;I saw it in the theatre first with a film-buff friend. &nbsp;We used to go to movies and then sit around chatting about them for hours. &nbsp;After Queen Margot we walked out in silence, looked at each other, made a few attempts at speech that were more like neolithic grunts, and then went home to absorb it all.<br /><br />When I rented it years later it was because another friend asked me that &quot;what's your favorite movie question,&quot; and I gave the same answer. &nbsp;The only way to explain Queen Margot to people is to make them watch it. &nbsp;The closest I've come to describing the experience is like getting smacked in the face with a heavy but fluffy pillow that's been laced with a light amount of some psychotropic drug.<br /><br />I've owned it on DVD for like 2 years and just can't bring myself to watch it again, but it's good to know it's there. &nbsp;Some day I'll be ready for it again.
