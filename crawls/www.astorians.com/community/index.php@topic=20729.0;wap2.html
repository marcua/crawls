			Sometimes my friends and I like to pose &quot;what ifs&quot; and then talk out all the possible scenarios.&nbsp; Here&#039;s one that grew out of a conversation about Libya&#039;s Civil War.<br /><br />What if the South decided to secede?<br /><br />Before anyone notes how very different the situation is in Libya and any reason why the Southern States would want to secede, I know!&nbsp; Just play along.<br /><br />If the Southern state legislatures and Governors all sign a Declaration of Independence and send it to the President&#039;s desk - what happens?&nbsp; What does Obama do?&nbsp; What does the rest of the world do?&nbsp; Which countries support which side?<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;ll never happen&quot; responses are not allowed.&nbsp; Trying to have fun playing nerdy political games here.<br /><br />Discuss.

			same&nbsp; things that happened in the Civil War, president declares the Southern states in rebellion , marshall Law is declared,&nbsp; &nbsp;and War between the northern and southern states the big question mark is which side the western states and Alaska and Hawaii take. also a question mark is what the Military would do since the are sworn to defend the constitution of the US and obey the orders of the president

			Why seccede and not stay independent?&nbsp; &nbsp;No one who secedes for independence is going to say &#039;OK, now let&#039;s join Russia.&quot; Or &quot;Hey, let&#039;s put ourselves under Mexican rule!&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;
