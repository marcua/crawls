				hi everyone - I live not far from Astoria in Jackson Heights and have already gotten lots of useful info on this board about mechanics and dentists, etc.<br /><br />I would love to have a site as great as this one in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; We already have a very active yahoo groups list but in my opinion it doesn&#039;t get the job done correctly.<br /><br />I am not sure who started this site, but I was wondering if you would be willing to share any information with me and someone else in JH who is interested in setting something up.&nbsp; Neither of us are that techncially savvy, but if we had someone help us initially to avoid any pitfalls, or simply just tell us how hard/costly it is to set up the site and maintain it, that would be really great.<br /><br />Thanks!

Don&#039;t share our secrets with them. NO! Make them donate BIG BUCKS to astorians.com before you help them. Make them say nice things about Astoria and nasty things about Jackson Heights. Yes, you could. You could do anything you wanted to do. They need your help. We are a one-of-a-kind. We are unique. We need you more. We can&#039;t afford for you to be spending your very precious time and energy in helping others. We need 100% of your attention right here. Just tell them NO!<br /><br />Oh! Okay. But only if they bring us food and water during the next blackout.

				Actually, I would really love to see a &quot;network&quot; of community sites that are connected in some way, yet each has its own feel as well.

				I&#039;ve got friends who live in JH and are on the JH list (JH Families, I think). The people on that list are a bit, uh, nutty. Makes the folks on Astorians.com seem... normal.&nbsp; :-o&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D

				I think a Jackson Heights board is a wonderful idea - the more communities coming together online the better.&nbsp; Out Astoria spawned Out Jackson Heights, which is now going strong!
