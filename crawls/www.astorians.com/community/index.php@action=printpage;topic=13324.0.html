				They&#039;re&nbsp; in Havana&nbsp; and&nbsp; working at the AP.&nbsp; It&#039;s bad enough that&nbsp; a film is screened&nbsp; in a Communist&nbsp; Dictatorship honoring a Communist&nbsp; murderer, but, to describe&nbsp; protests&nbsp; against Che&#039;&nbsp; as&nbsp; people being upset&nbsp; cause&nbsp; Che &#039;executed&#039;&nbsp; officials&nbsp; from the previous&nbsp; dictator ,Batista,&nbsp; is downright criminal propaganda. But, I better&nbsp; stop here, lest&nbsp; the name of that dead Senator&nbsp; of Wisconsin from the early 50&#039;s&nbsp; makes&nbsp; an appearance. :wink:<br /><br />Del Toro attends screening of &#039;Che&#039; in Havana<br /><br />HAVANA (AP) - Actor Benicio del Toro says protesters at the Miami screening of ``Che&#039;&#039; should have watched the film first. <br /><br />Del Toro plays Argentine-born Ernesto ``Che&#039;&#039; Guevara, a hero of the Cuban revolution and global icon. He says the role was difficult and took a lot of time. <br /><br />Cuban exiles protested the movie in Miami last week. Many opposed Guevara for executions of officials from Fulgencio Batista&#039;s government, which was toppled in 1959. <br /><br />But del Toro says ``a lot of the people protesting the movie hadn&#039;t seen it.&#039;&#039; <br /><br />He spoke Saturday as about 1,500 people attended the screening of the movie by director Steven Soderbergh at a film festival in Havana. <br /><br />The Puerto Rican actor won the Cannes Film Festival&#039;s best-actor prize for his performance. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				I don&#039;t see why this is any different than a movie about any other controversial figure in history from any political background.&nbsp; Or how accepting a role in such a movie automatically classifies someone as &quot;communist.&quot;&nbsp; Indeed that does sound like something a certain dead senator would say.

				Lately, capitalism does seem like magical thinking. <br /><br />Che looks like a fun movie. And it would have been terrific to see it in Havana. I&#039;m not sure what all the outrage is about over this. But I look forward to the film (also an old friend worked on it, so I&#039;m thrilled to see her influence). <br /><br />

				I love the recurring sentiment of, &quot;America&#039;s freedom and values... but you are not free to believe in your communism values.&quot; It really annoys me how dismissive and condescending people are of the word communism, when evidently, only half of those people even know what it means. <br />I don&#039;t think Communists (At least here) are trying to force anything upon anyone, at least no moreso than the Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, etc.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s a great idea, unfortunately one that requires total agreement and participation of all people involved- which, as human nature has proved time and again, will most likely never happen on a large scale. I think that if it could legitimately be executed, it might be cool to live under the &quot;Give what you can, take what you need&quot; philosophy (Not &quot;Shut up and listen&quot;, as some folks have incorrectly stated)<br /><br />It&#039;s a matter of degree- pure capitalism can&#039;t ever really work, and our current system of government has some socialistic aspects to it as well, which I think work. Laissez-faire capitalism in American history has not exactly shown to be successful as well.

Which of course makes those socialistic aspects somewhat of a drain on the economy as a whole.<br /><br />I agree with you that it is a matter of degree. But let&#039;s not confuse socialism with communism. And keep in mind the Soderbergh quote that we are referencing:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Che’s dream of a classless society, a society that isn’t built on the profit motive, is still relevant.

And I would be real interested to see what he feels is a &quot;profit motive&quot;. Because it is apparent to me that without that motive, nothing gets built, nothing gets done, and all of us are back on the Serengeti hunting for our food. <br />One other thing, as I stated before, you are free to live as a Communist or a Socialist (isn&#039;t that what the Quakers do?) in a free society. But try living as a Capitalist in a Communist society. The freedom alone should be enough to convince everyone which ideal is superior.<br /><br />

				Soderbergh would fit in quite well in a Communist regime-even with all the money. He would be a great propagandist. All the apparatchiks are wealthier than the poor working-class schlubs.<br />America may not be perfect but...I like living in a society in which I can express my opinions without worrying whether it&#039;s in line with official policy. Right now I don&#039;t have to worry about neighbors, friends or even family turning me in to the authorities for spreading subversive, treasonous lies about the utopia we would be living in. I have no fear of re-education camps or gulags. I like being able to go to the church (not the government sanctioned one) of my choice. I like having the freedom to convert to any religion of my choosing because none are outlawed. Religion (the opium of the masses) is not yet a threat to the State religion of Atheism. I even like the fact that if I decided to move to a different country I could do so. I don&#039;t have the government refusing to allow me to leave because my profession is too valuable for the well-being of the State. You think politicians are corrupt now? Wait until there is only a one party system. You dissent-you die. You get labeled as a &quot;refusenik&quot;. You as well as your family are discriminated against and your life is made miserable. I am &quot;not very fond of&quot; communism because the only thing we have after every thing else is taken away is freedom of choice, and that&#039;s the only way communism has ever existed. It simply isn&#039;t natural. I&#039;m getting off my soap-box now and thanking the Lord we are not at the point in our history where I would get a knock on the door in the middle of the night for expressing these views. I fear the further away we drift from the 20th Century the closer we get to a (quasi)Communist regime in America. I hope you&#039;re right Debbie! I hope I&#039;m just paranoid!
