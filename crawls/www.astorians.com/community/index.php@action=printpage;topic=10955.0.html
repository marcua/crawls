				The Chinese have always been there from before Castro.&nbsp; These poor people left China fleeing communism and voila....<br /><br />Actually Cuba had the largest European, Lebanese (lots of Lebanese) and Chinese population in the Caribbean, it&#039;s a shame what this man did, it was a very cosmopolitan place, it&#039;s going to be a long time before things change.&nbsp; My mother still has to do yearly trips just to take medication that you can&#039;t find there for her family....to the tourists and people that travel from abroad they have the BEST medical facilities and all medications available, if you&#039;re Cuban you get NOTHING of that and the hospitals are deplorable (for the Cuban&#039;s that is).<br /><br />Hopefully by Europe lifting the sanction the Cuban people will get a taste of what they&#039;ve been deprived of and hopefully the change will come from within, but that also will not be an easy thing...a lot of people will die in the process.

Yes, like the Old Soviet, tourists, many already pre-disposed to believe&nbsp; the &#039;best&#039; about the Communists&nbsp; system, are shown the best. In any case, you can&#039;t &#039;trade&#039;&nbsp; yourself&nbsp; to &#039;freedom&#039;, China is&nbsp; still a repressive state. The Soviet Union and East Bloc only collapsed&nbsp; when we used our wealth and military build up and forced them to bankrupt themselves.&nbsp; Castro, Raul now, will try to model&nbsp; his &#039;opening&#039; like&nbsp; China, while the &#039;party&#039; maintains&nbsp; control. Just a week or so ago, Tainaman Square&nbsp; massacre&nbsp; was only&nbsp; honored&nbsp; in ceremonies in Hong Kong, who still maintain some independence&nbsp; from the &#039;Party&#039; in Bejing. The reason sanctions never worked is they were never really enforced, except by the USA. Also, Castro had many sympathisers&nbsp; in a West who held, and some still hold, some &#039;romantic&#039; notions of&nbsp; &#039;Free&#039;&nbsp; education(brainwashing) and&nbsp; Healthcare, like&nbsp; the population is&nbsp; a&nbsp; &#039;pet.&#039; It often is&nbsp; said that &#039;Freedom&#039;&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp; &#039;Free&#039;,it is messy, often &#039;unfair&#039;, but, the alternative is&nbsp; a state like Cuba.
