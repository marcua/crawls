And I don&#39;t even like chocolate.&quot; Grant is expected to recover well enough to return to his job as a research librarian by Friday.

Started out as a limited edition and was made a regular flavor due to popular demand (me). And I finally got to hit Il Laboritorio for gelato on Sunday. They had cinammon and hazelnut and some other fun flavors like fresh mint, sour cream, espresso, GUINNESS, blackberry, and honey lavender. Mmm, I love Il Laboritorio!

				I really wish I could find Cherry Garcia Frozen Yogurt here.<br /><br />I went on the Ben and Jerry&#39;s factory tour once, it was pretty fun.&nbsp; The best factory tour I have ever been on is the Celestial Seasonings factory, sooo cool.
