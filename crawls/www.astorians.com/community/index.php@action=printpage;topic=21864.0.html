				Hello,<br /><br />So I will be moving to NY by the end of November, I&#039;m looking for a 1 Br Apt near the R/M line considering I will be going to Penn station everyday. I&#039;m looking for a quite area or atleast not very crowded and a balcony would be great but not required, Also a parking spot. Any recommendation what should I do to find a nice apartment, shall I go with brokers or I would be able to come and walk the area and find something?, if yes for brokers, any recommendation.<br />Also, I am willing to move by November 28, how long would it take me to find an apartment?, what paper work I need?, How much would I expect to pay for a nice 1 br.?, <br /><br />Thanks in advance

				Hi , welcome . One bedroom apts in astoria , depending on how updated you want them usually start at abt 1200 and up . To get something nice and modern , stainless steel appl&#039;s plus an updated bathroom , expect to pay twds 1400+.&nbsp; Anything near the train will always cost more .&nbsp; Parking spots or garages are abt 150-200 a month .&nbsp; &nbsp; You can always look on craigslist and avoid fees , but ofcourse you should be carefull and ask plenty of questions . You would need to have current credit scores ,drivers&nbsp; license&nbsp; and possible references .&nbsp; &nbsp;Apts are usually rented on the 1st of the month , so unless someplace has been vacant for months it would be hard to get in on the 28th of the month , but you never know .&nbsp; As far as quite goes , the farther you are from the train and the main areas like 30th ave and broadway , the more quite you should find . Ditmars Blvd is one of the most residential areas with less commercial traffic and less bars and clubs than the other mentions areas .Upper Ditmars is the most quite area in Astoria with zero nightlife going on , meaning no noise , but it is farther from the train . Plenty of people choose this area for its saftey ,family life and available parking . You should come and feel the area out , see what you like and dont like . There are plenty of real estate places all over and you can check them out as well but be prepared to pay their fees if using them .

				I&#039;m @ 30th Ave/37th st, very noisy, especially in summer and wkends, the bars and restaurants open till late at night, some open till early hours of the morning with music at full blast, so much so that you can feel your heartbeat thumping with the bass when you lie down to sleep if you live directly above the restaurant as I do. Have not had a good night sleep after moving in, still got 10 months of hell to endure before the lease is up. So be selective if a good night sleep is important for you.

Spring/Summer its brutal there if you have a family with kids sleeping early . Bars clubs lounges and cafes all open till the morning hours . People drunk , blasting music in cars , bottles and fights nightly .&nbsp; Dont know how you can miss that , it happens every weekend .&nbsp; Yea its nice if you are 22 and in the middle of everything but not if you want quiet like the OP stated . Going up twds the 40&#039;s is better but from Steinway till 31st is just chaos and even the side streets are tough cuz where do u think all those people walking to their cars drunk are heading .&nbsp; &nbsp;Parking is impossible too .

I was not talking about the area where all the clubs are located. I lived directly on 30th Avenue between 46th and 47th Streets for two years recently, so I am very familiar with that area. It is not noisy at all and traffic is pretty light too. Previously to that, I lived directly on Ditmars and 35th Street and was routinely woken up by car alarms and fire trucks. All of Ditmars is definitely not quieter than all of 30th Avenue. The different areas make a big difference.

				Thanks for the info, but no one talked about the are south, like south af 36th ave. &amp; 20 to 33rd St., It seems that would be an easy commute going to Penn station, less time and not crowded. Anything about this area??<br />Thanks again!

				The higher the aves like 35th ave 36ave the more sketchy it gets .&nbsp; The safest and most residential area is ditmars Blvd .&nbsp; 30th ave has alot of Apt blds&nbsp; but east of steinway is def less noisy and crazy than the west side of it .&nbsp;

				Okay, one quick question cause I got confused, what trains go to Penn Station??, I&#039;ve been told R/M but every time I google a place/address it takes me to the Q or M trains. Also even though Ditmars area is further from Penn station than 30th ave, it shows me same amount of time commuting to Penn station if I take the train, Is that true?<br />And are this trains 24 hours? whats your suggestions of areas commuting to penn station?

				trains are indeed 24 hours - they just have reduced service overnight.<br />&nbsp;<br />You can find all the train schedules and maps on the MTA website.&nbsp; http://mta.info/ (http://mta.info/)&nbsp; The 1/2/3 and A/C/E all go to Penn station, but none of them go to Astoria.&nbsp; You would need to take the N/Q/W to 42nd and transfer.&nbsp; Or, on a nice day you can take the N/Q/W to 34th street and just walk over - which is my preference.<br />&nbsp;<br />The time between Ditmars and 30th avenue can be less than 5 minutes, it&#039;s not really a factor.&nbsp; You can even walk between the stops in 10 minutes or so.

				One thing that alot of my tenants are really happy about with living at the Ditmars Blvd stop for the N/Q line is you always get a seat going into Manhattan and probably the most i hear is , with the crazy scheduals these trains have , they never get their stop skipped when the conductor decides to go express to Qnsboro plaza . I see people at the other stops like 30th and Broadway with jaws dropped to the floor as the train zooms by after they have been waiting out in the cold for 10 mins .&nbsp; I just went express today from Ditmars and i felt kinda lucky cuz i had to be on time and was running late .
