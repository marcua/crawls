				So I recently moved into an apartment-share, and while my housemates are all great guys, they harbor somewhat unorthodox beliefs about furniture...specifically, that who needs it? We have a couch, but no coffee table (or kitchen table, or dining-room table - you wanna eat, you sit on the floor, bucko, who do you think you are, anyway?), a TV but no TV stand...I have a bed, but half of my posessions are in piles, with the other half piled on top of them.<br /><br />Does anyone in the area have some furniture they're thinking of getting rid of , or know somewhere around to pick stuff up cheap, or ideas for building something ghetto-riffic on a miniscule budget? Seriously, anything I can put stuff <strong>in</strong> or <strong>on</strong> - I'm in no position to be picky.<br /><br />danke schoen, <br />Marc

				when the snow clears off a bit, try wandering around on trash nights. &nbsp;that's how I got my TV and a big old-fashioned storage trunk/coffee table. &nbsp;let me know if you find a bookcase.

				Title: <strong>A scrounging syndicate?</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				So here's the idea...<br /><br />We organise a group of people spread out across different trash-day areas, and maintain a communal 'wanted' list. Each person in the syndicate keeps an eye out around their 'hood for salvageable furniture. If they find anything, they call the person on the list who wanted it...that person reciprocates by paying a finder's fee in Freeze Peach coffee or Fatty's beer.<br /><br />Eh? Eh?<br /><span style="font-size: 9px;" class="bbc_size"><br />Or, I could just stop drinking beer and coffee, and with the money I save, purchase furniture...</span><br /><br />What? Wait, sorry, don't know where that last bit came from. Crazy talk.<br /><br />Anyway. I'll keep my eyes peeled for a bookshelf; if you happen across a desk, let me know.<br /><br />M

				Because of a serious mold problem I have to get a new bed and new dressers because mine are ruined. So if anyone seas some decent dressers laying about near Ditmars and 27th let me know. :D
