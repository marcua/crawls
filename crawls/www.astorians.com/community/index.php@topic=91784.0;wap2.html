			<strong>Starwind51</strong>:
			<br />
			Last night I was on Broadway, between 29th and 30th Streets, and I saw that Food Emporium is opening a location where C-Town used to be.&nbsp; Forgive me if this is old news, I haven&#039;t been around there in a while.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know when the expected opening is.<br /><br /><br />At first I was sarcastic, &quot;Yay!&nbsp; Manhattan prices!&quot;, but if they sell things I can&#039;t get at other stores, I&#039;m ok with it. <br /><br /><br />A brief history of the store:<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Food_Emporium<br /><br /><br /><br />
