				I thought it would be easier to keep track if we just started a new thread each week...specially since we tend to wander off track!<br /><br />I usually don&#39;t follow Emeril, but since this sounds faboo and easy-this is what i&#39;m trying out for dinner tonight:<br />http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_16279,00.html (http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_16279,00.html)<br /><br />2 pounds Jerusalem artichokes<br />2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br />2 teaspoons minced garlic<br />8 ounces button mushrooms<br />1/2 teaspoon salt<br />1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper<br />2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley<br />2 tablespoons truffle oil<br /><br />Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Place the artichokes in the boiling water and cook at a low boil until tender, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain in a colander set in the sink and let sit until just cool enough to handle. Quickly peel the artichokes and slice.<br /><br />Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and saute for 30 seconds. Add the mushrooms, salt, and pepper, and saute until they give off their liquid, about 5 minutes. Add the artichoke slices and parsley, and stir to combine. Cook for 1 minute.<br /><br />Remove from the heat and toss with the truffle oil. Serve immediately.<br /><br /><em>i will be leaving out the truffel oil, i&#39;ve never had it and don&#39;t want to splurge on it if i don&#39;t know if i&#39;ll like it.</em><br /><br />pics to come on flickr!

				I am excited about the swiss chard! It was one of my favorite veggies growing up, but my mom stopped making it at a certain point because it was too much work to clean :(<br /><br />Anyway, she always divided the chard, boiling the big green leaves and sauteeing the stalks with butter and parmesan cheese (after boiling them)... yum!!<br /><br />And swiss chard quiche is one of the typical recipes of Genoa...

				Truffle oil is *definitely* worth the splurge. Go to O &amp; co, though, and you can taste-test for free.

				I frankly like Trader Joe&#39;s truffle oil.&nbsp; It gets dissed on Chowhound, but to me it&#39;s a great, less expensive alternate to have at home, since I don&#39;t feel like (read: can&#39;t afford to) dropping $60 on a small bottle of oil.&nbsp; I&#39;ve had *good* truffle oil, and I think TJ&#39;s version is fine.

				I made the jerusalem artichoke and carrot salad that was in the newsletter this evening, substituting mint for the dill (&#39;cause I don&#39;t like dill). It was very good! Good pick, whomever found that recipe! (I used all the j. artichokes, about 2 carrots, and a third or so of the other ingredients...)<br /><br />Oh, the j. artichokes brown rather quickly when cut. Putting the lemon juice on them helps.<br /><br />Oh, and merm (especially), my chives from last week were still good. I&#39;d put them in the fridge in a glass of water, and they were still quite fresh. However, the ones with flowers on top were definitely woodly and unpleasant like you reported. I just picked those out and used the ones without flowers, and they were great in the salad...

				I made a variation of the Emeril recipe that flooz posted - Just boiled the artchokes, the sauteed them with garlic and finished them with truffle oil. Delish.<br /><br />My roommate sauteed the sugar snap peas with garlic (we like garlic) and they were fantastic - beautiful green, crisp-tender, and so fresh!

				O&amp;Co is Oliviers &amp; Co. (http://www.oliviersandco.com/index.asp?ck=1) - a Mediterranean food-ish store that focusses on olive oil and like products.&nbsp; They have some types of appetisers, and bread, if I remember correctly, but otherwise it&#39;s not really a &quot;food&quot; store.&nbsp; There are many stores, three (http://www.oliviersandco.com//storelocator/store_result.asp?continent=AMERICA&amp;liste_villes=New+York&amp;country=U.S.A) of which are in NYC.

				i did end up making my chokes and mushrooms and even though i now know i don&#39;t <em>love</em> the choke, the dish was a good accompaniment to my roasted pork loin and salad. tomorrow i&#39;m making this...and i&#39;m sooooooo excited about it:<br />Swiss Chard, Bacon, and Ricotta Ravioli with Tomato Sauce<br />http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_7615,00.html (http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_7615,00.html)<br /><br />3 slices bacon<br />3 cups chopped Swiss chard, stems discarded, leaves washed and chopped (about 1/2 pound)<br />1/2 teaspoon minced garlic<br />1/2 cup ricotta cheese<br />2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese<br />24 won ton wrappers, thawed or pasta dough<br />1 cup prepared tomato sauce<br /><br />In a large heavy skillet cook bacon over moderate heat until crisp and with a slotted spatula transfer to a cutting board. Chop bacon fine. Remove all but 1 tablespoon fat from skillet and heat remaining fat over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Cook chard and garlic, stirring, until chard is tender, about 2 minutes. Transfer chard mixture to a bowl and cool. To chard mixture add cheeses, 2 tablespoons bacon, and salt and pepper to taste.<br /><br />Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a gentle boil.<br /><br />Put won ton wrapper or pasta dough on a lightly floured surface and mound 1 tablespoon filling in center of wrapper. Brush edges of wrapper with water and put a second wrapper over first, pressing down around filling to force out air. Seal edges well and transfer ravioli to a kitchen towel. Make more ravioli with remaining wrappers and filling in same manner, turning them occasionally to dry slightly. Cook ravioli in water at a gentle boil 6 to 8 minutes, or until they rise in surface and are tender. (Do not let water boil vigorously once ravioli have been added.) With a slotted spoon transfer ravioli as cooked to a kitchen towel to drain.<br /><br />Divide ravioli between 2 plates and spoon sauce over them. Garnish ravioli with remaining tablespoon bacon.
