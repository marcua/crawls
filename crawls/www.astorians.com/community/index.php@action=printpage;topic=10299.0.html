				i&#039;m surprised that this topic ( single and dating ) has&#039;nt done so well. the visitors on this subject started in late March and is fading fast . no new members have responded lately . i wonder if it&#039;s because of fear not meeting someone who is &#039;&#039;down to earth&#039;&#039;. not knowing what to expect. then again don&#039;t people take chances on things that are senseless.&nbsp; :-(

				let&#039;s start it back up. maybe plan another singles event- more of a mingle event though, rather than tables where your sitting next to the same people all night, and see how it goes. I&#039;d be open to try another astoria singles event. I made some really nice friends at the last one, so even if there isnt a dating potential, its always great to make new friends.

				11105ASTNY--<br /><br />The singles boards on this site are relatively new, so I&#039;m thinking that there has yet to be a lot of stories of people connecting via them. Also, my logic may be faulty here, but if people made a serious connection, would they still be reading the singles boards and see your request? It&#039;s debatable. You seem to be very concerned with the experiences of others on here. I think that if you put the same energy into creating your own positive experience with this site (or others), you might be more successful in your dating goals. <br /><br />Just a thought.&nbsp; :-)<br />

				Not sure what your referring to but everyone has some kind of successful stories with dating.<br />I simply want to hear stories about local people who connect from this site.&nbsp; I hear stories about<br />people who connect from CL but they are not want I want to hear. I preferably like to connect with people<br />offline.

				very well put, when we look for love. The only thing we find is a major headache, this is why I believe in the natural way of meeting people.<br />
