				Hi,<br />We&#039;re having a yard sale and my kids are selling lemonade today, in front of 24-37 Crescent St (Between 24th Ave and Hoyt Ave).&nbsp; We&#039;re donating all the money raised today to our Relay for Life team &quot;Seeds of Love&quot; (Relay for Life is an American Cancer Society event) . We&#039;re doing the Relay in Astoria Park on June 2,&nbsp; so we figured we&#039;d have this yard sale to raise some money for a very good cause!! <br />Come down and say hello, we&#039;re a very friendly bunch and we do have quite an interesting mix of items!!!<br /><br />(if this was the wrong section to post this in, i do apologize!)<br /><br />:)<br />Jen

				That&#039;s a noble cause, having a yard sale and selling lemonade for Relay For Life.&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />Too bad I just saw your post now, I would have taken a walk to your sale to make a contribution. <br /><br />Hope it went well.

				Being that we only put flyers up around Ditmars this morning, we did ok. We raised $150.00, which we are happy with!&nbsp; We did meet some nice people who happened to be walking by and will most likely join us for the relay in June!&nbsp;

				Hey!&nbsp; I actually live right up the block from there and while my husband and I were running errands, we drove past you!&nbsp; I said to my husband that it looked like a cute setup as we passed.<br /><br />Awwww.&nbsp; I wish I read this ahead of time.&nbsp; &nbsp;:cry:

				I only went to Cassidy&#039;s a few times. Jamie and Tony were great together! When Tony did his Total Eclipse of the Heart, that was hysterical. Too bad it is gone. I haven&#039;t seen Jamie in forever, where did he wind up?&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t really use my Myspace for posting anything, but here is my link:<br /><br />http://www.myspace.com/ratchetrn6<br /><br />Nice meeting you!<br />

				Same here!<br /><br />Tony and I used to do &quot;Picture&quot; by Sheryl Crow and Kid Rock all the time.&nbsp; It was cute.&nbsp; Tony and Jamie I believe are both bartending at Medusa, which sucks because that is a place I&#039;d NEVER hang out in.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; <br /><br />I do plan on hanging out with them in a few weeks at McCanns.&nbsp; If they come out, you should too!&nbsp; It&#039;s close to home and a night away from children.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />

				Medusa<br />25-18 50th Street<br /><br />I&#039;m not knocking it, it&#039;s just definitely not my sort of scene...at all. <br /><br />McCanns is on Ditmars Blvd and 35th Street.&nbsp; I sent you a Friends Request on Myspace.&nbsp; Hopefully, I&#039;ll be in touch with the brothers soon.&nbsp; If everything pans out, I will most definitely let you know.&nbsp; :)
