				In other pizza news - this place finally opened! (On Ditmars @ 38th Street)&nbsp; http://www.granoscafe.com/<br /><br />They didn&#039;t appear to have a fanfare opening, no signs or announcement aside from a pack of menus on my front gate. Yes, a pack - lunch, dinner, pizza and I think one other. They have quite the selection - I really hope that with this variety they have some solid offerings. I&#039;m really eager to check it out. I haven&#039;t been inside yet but have stalked from the sidewalk - they appear to have done a great renovation, d√©cor and all. Looks like the perfect place to pop in for a beer and a slice. I&#039;ll report back after I&#039;ve tried it. <br /><br />Anyone wander in yet?<br />

				I&#039;ve only noticed that there is virtually no place to sit down for a meal. Maybe one group of 4 can have that table. If they are planning on doing almost ALL of their business in delivery or takeout, it better be the best delivery or takeout in the area. I&#039;ll give them a try one of these days, once they work out the bugs (as it were), and I&#039;ll decide if it&#039;s worth sticking with..

				I finally made it in! Tried three different slices, great stuff! I am eager to branch out and try some offerings off their menu but a solid slice is a great start! I sat at the bar and had a beer. The guys working were super nice and they have a pretty comfy atmosphere. I definitely recommend giving it a shot.

				$4 for a &quot;special&quot; slice. I had one buffalo chicken and one philly chessesteak, which tasted exactly like that. Both were pretty good. Sadly this is right on my way home from the train, I&#039;ll have trouble resisting going there every night.

				<br />Yup, I never went in but was always doubtful about this place.<br /><br />When they were first building it, sure the design was a bit tacky, but at least it seemed like they were really trying to make it nice.&nbsp; But then once I started seeing signs up everywhere for &#039;pizza and a soda $3.99&#039; (or whatever it said...) etc., and with the stupid big-screen TV over the bar (seriously....is that what we need...more in-your-face, non-stop news and sports when we want a bite to eat?)...I too am not totally surprised.<br /><br />Surely however, that end of Ditmars could use a nice little eatery....

It was about 6pm Friday, lights going crazy and I was able to spot the new setup through the closing door. From the glance I got, the interior looks completely different. At this hour I assume they&#039;re just testing things out but I did see people dressed for clubbing. Hiring event perhaps? There was a paper sign up on the door that says &quot;Granos&quot; - nothing else identifying. Very curious to see what they&#039;re planning on doing here. Likely nothing I&#039;ll be interested in, but curious.

				I came through at 6pm last night and there was a Willie O&#039;s van out front. After some research I learned that it&#039;s a &quot;Latin-American caf√© and lounge&quot; with hookah over on Broadway. Either opening another location or maybe catering last night&#039;s event?? <br /><br />I passed by again about 8 - could see girls inside getting their makeup done. Came back through at 11pm. The place was hoppin. There was a cameraman filming people coming in and out. He said they&#039;re shooting a &quot;commercial/promo&quot;. A few guys (security/promoter looking) came outside and I grilled them but didn&#039;t manage to get any real info. When asked who owns the place one guy responded &quot;some really rich guy&quot;. I mentioned that I live around the corner and I&#039;m curious as to what&#039;s going on but they didn&#039;t seem eager to give details. Saw the new Vogue Lounge sign and commented about the new &quot;Vague Vogue Lounge&quot; - I had consumed a bit of wine, so yeah that happened. Oh and I did see Hookah.<br /><br />The guys were definitely nice enough but I don&#039;t understand why they were holding back details when I was obviously interested. It appeared that last nights event was promotional, between cameraman and girls getting fancied up, so why they didn&#039;t want to...well promote...to a local is odd.&nbsp; <br /><br />I guess we&#039;ll see!

				I just read that it will be a hookah lounge so I&#039;m not too excited about that.&nbsp; This is what I read:<br /><br />New Hookah Bar Arriving on Steinway Looks like a new hookah bar, Vogue Lounge NYC (https://www.facebook.com/VogueLoungeNYC?fref=photo),&nbsp; is opening up on Ditmars and 38th very soon. According to a post on their Facebook page, they‚Äôre ‚Äúalmost there‚Äù in regards to opening.

				I walked by last night and saw that they hung some dark wrinkled curtains in the window. I looked inside and saw a big black leather chair and couch.&nbsp; It&#039;s as if they don&#039;t want you to see what&#039;s inside, like it&#039;s a big secret.&nbsp; Now it really looks like it will be a hookah bar.

				I did a search and found their website.&nbsp; Here is what it said about Vogue Lounge.&nbsp; it says there will be a DJ.&nbsp; That&#039;s something different for the ditmars area<br /><br />About Vogue Our name presents a term for something (such as a way of dressing or behaving) that is fashionable, popular in a particular time and place and that‚Äôs exactly who and what we are, VOGUE!!! VOGUE is the new Go-to cocktail bar &amp; night club conveniently located in the heart of Astoria. WE are a cocktail bar where people can enjoy a conversation and have a great drink in a relaxed and friendly environment during the day, as well a place that will keep you moving in the night time. VOGUE features a cocktail-driven menu, along with an extensive lineup of scotches and bourbons, craft beers and a concise list of great wines.Our rotating line-up of first class DJs keeps the room jumping Monday through Saturday nights and like all of our venues, you can expect nothing but the best caliber of hospitality and service whenever you enter our doors.
