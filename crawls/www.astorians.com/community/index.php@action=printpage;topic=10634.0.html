				I just now noticed the tattoo place on Ditmars, between 38th and 37th (or thereabouts). Has anyone been there? Anyone know about the artists? Do they do good work? It looks brand new, just wanted to know if I could go local and find a good artist or if I still had to trek to Manhattan (and withstand the waiting lists) for my regular place.

				Yep, I&#039;ve gotten tattooed there!<br /><br />A friend of mine has a ton of amazing tattoos by Andreana, so I decided to try her out even though I have a regular guy (in Brooklyn).&nbsp; She was super awesome, my tattoo came out so great (a text tattoo, too! sooooo easy to screw up royally), and I&#039;d totally go back to her.
