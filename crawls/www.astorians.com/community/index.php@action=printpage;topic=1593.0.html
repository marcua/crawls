				Hunh, well my ex-girlfriend and I broke up more than a month ago, but she&#39;s still looking for a place to move to. (Soon, intshallah!) So now I will be reminded of my sucky singleness every time I see my roommate today. Oy.<br /><br />I was thinking of killing two birds with one stone by quaffing a beer at the neighborhood bar near me, the one that I said I was going to check out for a possible pool table...<br />

				Albatross looks like such a fun bar! i&#39;ve walked by for years and always get a chuckle out of the music coming out of there. I know its a gay bar and all but thats never really made a difference to me as long as a fun time is had by all!&nbsp;

				Broadway Station is pretty skanky....

				hello everyone.<br /><br />thanks for sharing.<br /><br />the horrid day ended with me meeting with some lovely people at Freeze Peach for a cup of great tea and some good discussion.<br /><br />then i found out a couple co workers were not having a good Valentine&#39;s so i went to meet up with them for some fondue and wine and great discussion.<br /><br />why is it that we are socialized to make this day such a big deal? argh. even people who are in relationships seem to get upset over things. it&#39;s just horrible. <br /><br />well. today is the 15th. a new day. a different day. not THAT day. :) sigh. <br />i hope everyone has a good day and rest of the year. :)
