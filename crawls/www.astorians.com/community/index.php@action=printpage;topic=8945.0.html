				I&#039;d be interested. I can do organizational work as well, but when I&#039;ve posted my ideas for a group, I usually get told that I&#039;m much too serious for the others who are interested.

I don&#039;t think it&#039;s possible to provide someone with a serious critique if you&#039;ve only just read the work. It&#039;s important to me to get serious responses, so that would be the kind of group I&#039;d want to look for.

				I have an interest in a writer&#039;s group. I write poetry mostly, but wouldn&#039;t mind giving feedback in other genres as well. I like paratactical&#039;s idea of sharing the work beforehand and then meeting for comments. I wonder if this is something we can do in conjunction with an online aspect to it as well or, instead of one, with an occasional physical meet up in case there are conflicts for actual times to meet. On a side note, I&#039;m really looking forward to the Poetry library opening up this Spring?, downtown. I can only imagine that the space is going to be AMAZING! <br /><br />Also, if this is a mostly poet&#039;s group, I&#039;d be interested in swapping poetry books from meeting to meeting. I can&#039;t always afford to buy the latest but with more people it would be possible to expose one another to new writers. My current read is Li Young Lee&#039;s &quot;Behind My Eyes.&quot; What is everyone else reading these days?

				I mentioned in another post about a release party for my zine, The Whiskey Dregs. It&#039;s a great way to get every one together, have a beer and have some fun. It&#039;s going to be at Sparrow on Friday 5/2. Drink specials, silly people and all.

				I will be interested once the movers bring my stuff and I&#039;m settled in (and I find a job). I&#039;d be down with the swap stories beforehand deal if the kinks ever get worked out. Heck, I&#039;d work the kinks out myself except I&#039;m a totally newbie and feel guilty writing and socializing when I should be getting stuff done.&nbsp; :evil:

				Hello, also new to the area. I&#039;m in the process of writing a book but would love to get together either in person or even a dedicated online site to discuss our projects and receive constructive criticism. I&#039;m not a poet, but I do get inspired by any piece that shows true feeling and emotion that I can relate to. I love to see all types of talent evolving and would enjoy spending some time with any of you that may be interested as well. My novel is slowly coming along. I would like to share some of it with others to receive feedback from various perspectives. Let me know when and where and I&#039;ll be there for sure. Seriously.

				Hey there...If you want to meet some writers and maybe publicly read your work, I&#039;m hosting an open mic night at Freeze Peach Cafe on 29th st and ditmars. The exact address is 22-00 29th Street. It&#039;s a cool spot. We&#039;re doing this on Friday, July 11 at 8PM.

				Bad ass, I&#039;ve always been semi in-love, semi afraid of the stage and open mics. I need to kill my stage fright. I can&#039;t make it this Friday as I don&#039;t have any of my stuff, and movers say Monday. I&#039;ll keep it open though because I may show up with friends just to get the feel for it.

				I&#039;m not sure if my material is open mic material. It&#039;s not poetry, just my novel in the making. But i would love to go to meet some fellow writers and to just listen to others for inspiration. <br /><br />I&#039;m really glad to know that the neighborhood has so much going on. I never got that feeling living in the city.<br /><br />Oh, i&#039;ll be the one with the short curly hair.

				Hi, Bailey. There&#039;s different events that we do for different types of situations. What we do have going on is an open mic at Freeze Peach Cafe once a month. You&#039;ll be happy to know that there&#039;s no alcohol there and we get together, share and discuss our works. It&#039;s fun and so far has been pretty successful. We have an event this Friday from 830-1100. <br /><br />Here&#039;s the info:<br /><br />Freeze Peach Cafe<br />22-00 29th St. <br />Ditmars and 29th Street <br />(real close to the ditmars blvd stop)<br /><br />Hope you and everyone else can make it. Welcome to the neighborhood.
