				Tried Zabb Thai for the first time a few days ago.&nbsp; They are on 30th Ave and 34th Street where Thai Angel was.&nbsp; I give them a big thumbs up.&nbsp; The food was and service were both very good.&nbsp; Steamed dumplings were yummy although I could have used a separate dipping dish.&nbsp; They put the sauce right on the plate.&nbsp; Also had the curry puffs.&nbsp; I prefer the ones at Wave Thai but these were not bad.&nbsp; I also had chicken with cashew nuts which was also quite good.&nbsp; Very flavorful, with a nice kick and the chicken tasted fresh (i hate it when it tastes gamey).<br /><br />The interior is tastefully done and provides a relaxing environment.&nbsp; The staff was on top of things.&nbsp; We ordered a bottle of wine and they gave us the teeniest wine glasses i had ever seen.&nbsp; I thought to myself that the waiter will never be on top of pouring the wine cause I will drink it way too fast but he showed me.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know we have plenty of Thai in the hood but I found this place to be a nice addition.

				Thai Angel is not there any more?&nbsp; &nbsp;:-(<br /><br />Our favorite delivery Thai is from Thai Elephant, but we also enjoyed Thai Angel as a back-up.&nbsp;

				Zabb Thai is pretty good, but I miss Thai Angel&#039;s mock duck w/ chili sauce. It was crispy, sweet, and slightly zesty/vinegary. It was good eatins&#039; with a side of papaya salad. Sigh. :cry:

				Went to Zabb Thai last night for dinner and, well, not so good.&nbsp; When we arrived (about 7:00PM) we stood around for about 8 minutes before we saw anyone who worked there.&nbsp; There were a couple of tables of customers, and we actually asked one &quot;where is everyone?&quot;&nbsp; We got a shrug that should have sent us to Thai Pavilion.&nbsp; But we stayed and were finally seated and immediately given water and then we waited and waited and asked twice for menus.&nbsp; Menus in hand we ordered an appetizer of Fried Calamari and entrees of Vegtable Pad Tamarind (a stir fry dish) for me and Beef Jungle Curry for my friend.&nbsp; Everything we ordered we had to point to in the menu because the waiter did not seem to understand anything we said (I suspect that 15 minutes before he was our waiter he had a kitchen job).&nbsp; The Fried Calamari were the consistancy of rubber bands and worked our jaw muscles to fatigue.&nbsp; My dish was small and not very flavorful (no Tamarind to speak of) and my friend reports that while his dish had exactly the right amount of fire (spice) the beef was dry and gross.&nbsp; Next time, we&#039;ll stick to Wave Thai.

				Zabb actually received a nod from Michelin in their &quot;Big Gourmand&quot; category, which is dedicated to affordable eats.&nbsp; I like Zabb, but they don&#039;t have the aforementioned faux duck dish that I crave almost constantly.
