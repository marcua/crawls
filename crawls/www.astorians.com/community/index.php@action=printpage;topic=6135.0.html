				Please explain how/why some threads are thumbtacked... while others aren&#039;t. <br /><br />I can&#039;t figure out the logic.&nbsp; Why is looking for beer, vegan food and fresh direct coupons more important than a tailor, hair dresser or laundromat? <br /><br />

				Thumbtacks are &quot;sticky&quot; topics persistent at the top of the forum.&nbsp; Some are more relevant than others I suspect.<br /><br />Hello &lt;&lt; good example of relevant, well used one.<br /><br />Beer and Ethical Consumerism are my favorites.&nbsp; I might be bias :)<br /><br />It seems like there should be others thumbtacked as well as they come up often -- dentists, doctors, vets, parking -- but I don&#039;t know how to sticky everything that seems relevant and not have the page look cluttered.&nbsp; I suppose eventually some of them will get &quot;unsticky&quot; as the subject becomes less popular.&nbsp; Beer might be going that route.

				Stickied posts aren&#039;t forever - they can change as interest in the topics change. It&#039;s one way that a moderator can bring attention to certain topics at the request of users.

				You can flag topics for moderation with a note that you&#039;d like it sticky -- if you&#039;d like.<br /><br />The way it&#039;s worked so far is different moderators find different things important and mark them as such.&nbsp; Merm is freshdirect coupons, meg is vegan food, I&#039;m beer &amp; ethical consumerism.<br /><br />I think we&#039;ve also made topics sticky on request as well.&nbsp; Sticky the street fair schedule is a good idea.

				I made street fairs sticky.<br /><br />Fresh Direct also does offer some selections from local farms -- and they clearly mark the organic/free range/humanitarianly raised stuff which is nice.&nbsp; It&#039;s not clearly the greenest alternative but it might, in some ways, be greener than shopping at the regular grocery store.<br /><br />I wish they took the boxes back though.

				I did post, not in Ethical Consumerism but in Heat (http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=5080.0).<br /><br />Here is the relevant quote: <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Although none of the reductions will be easily achieved, Monbiot&#039;s analysis concludes that those related to transportation may be the hardest of all. To reduce ground transportation emissions sufficiently, he suggests the need to severely lessen individual shopping trips. To accomplish this, he proposes that goods be delivered. He cites a UK Department of Transportation study that notes, &quot;a number of modeling exercises and other surveys suggest that the substitution of private cars by delivery vehicles could reduce traffic by 70 percent or more.&quot; Every van the stores dispatch, in other words, takes three cars off the road. Monbiot also proposes to transform out of town superstores into warehouses, to be visited only by vehicles that pick up supplies. That will save even more energy, because warehouses use only 35 percent as much heat and 29 percent as much electricity as do stores.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And then there is the added ecological savings of having the option of buying food that has traveled from Long Island as opposed to California. <br /><br />But yeah, the packaging. There&#039;s the rub.

				Can we take the tax information sticky down?&nbsp; Taxes were due a while ago and if you haven&#039;t done them yet, that sticky won&#039;t help you.&nbsp; Just a thought.
