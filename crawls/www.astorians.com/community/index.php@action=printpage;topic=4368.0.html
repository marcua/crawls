				December 10, 2006<br />The Hunt<br />Room for Guests, and Salsa<br /><br />By JOYCE COHEN<br />AN extra bedroom or two — for guests and maybe a baby — was what Rory Mackin and Heather Nadine Clarke wanted most.<br /><br />Mr. Mackin is from Ireland. His parents have been to America only once, for a two-week visit. They stayed in the couple’s one-bedroom rental in Astoria, Queens.<br /><br />“We were sleeping on the couch, and they were in the bedroom,” Mr. Mackin said. “They don’t want to impose upon us, but we want them to come for a longer period of time.”<br /><br />What’s more, Mr. Mackin and Ms. Clarke, both 29, owe his parents a debt of gratitude. It was their financial help that eventually allowed the couple to buy a big apartment, one where they could settle for the long haul.<br /><br />“How do you say thank you for something like that?” Ms. Clarke asked. Her way was to provide them with comfortable accommodations and a standing invitation to visit.<br /><br />Mr. Mackin and Ms. Clarke met through a friend eight years ago when both were exchange students in Spain. He was at the Queen’s University of Belfast, while she was at Marymount Manhattan College.<br /><br />When the school year ended, a “painful long-distance relationship” ensued, Ms. Clarke said. The two married in Manchester, England, returned briefly to her native New Haven, Conn., and then, five years ago, headed for New York City.<br /><br />Ms. Clarke was familiar with Astoria from her college years, when friends lived there, “and knew it was really affordable and really close.”<br /><br />They rented a sunny one-bedroom in a three-family row house on busy Steinway Street, where they found themselves increasingly tortured by noise from the bar next door. On weekend mornings, their doorway was filled with beer bottles, cigarette stubs and food containers. Their rent was $1,100 a month.<br /><br />Last winter, they decided to hunt for a more permanent place, big enough for guests — including Ms. Clarke’s mother and grandfather, who occasionally visit from New Haven — and ideally, for children.<br /><br />They were reluctant to stray far. They were fond of their local butcher and fishmonger on 30th Avenue, and felt at home in the melting pot of Astoria. Both had easy commutes to work. Ms. Clarke teaches kindergarten in Corona, Queens, and Mr. Mackin works in financial public relations in Manhattan.<br /><br />Their price range was $300,000 to $400,000. Mr. Mackin’s parents, who live in rural Lissummon in County Armagh, Northern Ireland, at one point also owned a house in the nearby town of Newry. They sold the house in town and contributed around $100,000, which more than covered the down payment.<br /><br />Ms. Clarke had her eye on some places nearby. Each morning on the Q18 bus to school, she passed Boulevard Gardens, a 10-building co-op complex on 14 landscaped acres in Woodside.<br /><br />The two visited a three-bedroom there, listed for around $330,000, but the layout, with a walled-off kitchen, felt cramped. It later sold for around $365,000.<br /><br />The 120 three-bedroom units are coveted. “I can go a year without getting one,” said the sales director, Lisa D’Amico.<br /><br />The two also checked out a two-bedroom for around $250,000. “We walked away from that two-bedroom saying it is gorgeous, we love it,” except for the size, Ms. Clarke said.<br /><br />They found themselves falling for Boulevard Gardens. The playground and children’s rainy-day room would come in handy someday. Neighbors endorsed the place unprompted. One woman told them that she had moved away but returned. A passing motorist, seeing them walking around, flagged them down to tell them what a great place it was. He happened to be from Ireland, too.<br /><br />Ms. Clarke also knew about the two Tudor-style condominium complexes near La Guardia Airport, which she often passed in the afternoon, carpooling home.<br /><br />One of them, Barclay Gardens, had a big three-bedroom apartment listed in the low $400,000s. The fake stone finish on the walls could be fixed. But it seemed too close to the airport and too far from shopping, and it meant a bus-to-subway commute for Mr. Mackin.<br /><br />“We went back and forth on that,” Ms. Clarke said. “There were too many cons and not enough pros.”<br /><br />Finding three-bedrooms scarce, they looked at a two-bedroom in the low $300,000s in the other Tudor-style complex, Garden Bay Manor Condominiums. But the second bedroom was small, and there were the same commuting problems.<br /><br />A few weeks later, they stopped by the Boulevard Gardens sales office. A rare three-bedroom was about to hit the market. The owner planned to renovate it and list it for around $370,000.<br /><br />“I had a feeling we should look, even though they wanted to discourage us because the place was a mess, filled with boxes,” Ms. Clarke said.<br /><br />They found it truly hideous. The kitchen tiles were decorated with textured fruits. The bathroom vanity had sparkles.<br /><br />But that hideous kitchen was open to a big living room. “We will be able to practice our salsa,” said Ms. Clarke, who has danced all her life. “I’m excited.”<br /><br />The couple would have preferred more closet space, a second bathroom and a washer-dryer. But those were by no means deal breakers.<br /><br />Ms. Clarke suggested buying the place “as is” and renovating it themselves rather than having the owner do it, as planned.<br /><br />“Honestly, it is not to their advantage to redo this apartment the best they can but to redo it as fast as they can,” she said. “I figured we could renovate it for half of what they would increase the price for.” And she worried that whoever picked the fruit tiles and sparkles would pick the new décor.<br /><br />The two offered $310,000 for the unrenovated three-bedroom, settling on $313,000. Maintenance is $844 a month.<br /><br />They moved in earlier this month after spending about $30,000 on renovation, much of it on the kitchen. Ms. Clarke, an accomplished cook, picked everything out herself.<br /><br />The couple hope that Mr. Mackin’s parents, Dermot and Brid, will visit for several weeks in early summer, when the weather is warm.<br /><br />“His dad left New York totally in love with the place,” Ms. Clarke said. “He was seeing people his age and older who were out and about and not, like, ‘We are too old to do this.’ He was really enamored with that.”<br /><br />E-mail: thehunt@nytimes.com<br /><br /><br />Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company<br />Privacy Policy<br />
