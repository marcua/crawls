				I would like to find a dentist in Astoria who is good with small children. My doctor has given me references to dentists but they are all in Manhattan.

Here I was thinking this child had some medical issues that needed to be dealt with during a dental exam.

				I didn&#039;t interpret her post to mean that she needs a Pediatric Dentist.&nbsp; She just asked for a dentist who is good with small children.

				My 9 year old has been going to Astoria Dental Group on Broadway and 33rd Street since his first visit when he was small - 718-278-1123. The dentists there are all very nice and kid friendly.

My regular dentist doesn&#039;t see children that small and recommended I take my child to a dentist who specializes in dealing with children, thus the recommendations from my pediatrician. When I was this young I was never taken to a dentist, so I don&#039;t know what is &quot;normal&quot;.

				Dr. Jana Janco, on 21st Avenue between 42nd and 43rd Streets. She is excellent, kind, gentle, explains everything to both child and parent, not an alarmist. 718-545-5302.
