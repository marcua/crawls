				Saw lots of people try to get into the new &quot;Square Hardware&quot; on Ditmars this morning.&nbsp; Poor things have no idea it is supposed to be a new speakeasy cocktail bar and think it really sells hardware.&nbsp;

				I don&#039;t usually go for gimmicks, but I love that the Square Hardware sign is back on Ditmars, even if it&#039;s meant ironically. Looking forward to giving this place a go. There&#039;s another entrance in the back through the parking lot on 33rd Street with different signage.

				I will not form my own opinions until I try it for myself, BUT... two good friends went last night.&nbsp; They said there was a crowd and the goofy factor was off the charts.&nbsp; No one allowed in.&nbsp; You must leave your cell phone number and they will call you when there is room and you can come in.&nbsp; The wait was about an hour.&nbsp; My friends were fed up and really turned off by the over-the-top fake speakeasy play acting.&nbsp; I always say, if people like this place, more power to them.&nbsp; For me, if it clears more room at the bar at The Ditty, then I will stick to the more conventional bars and lounges.&nbsp; (I wonder if they ask all customers to walk out carrying a Square Hardware bag so they aren&#039;t raided?)

				Ironic, pretentious and &quot;quirky&quot; can&#039;t last. Looks like a total remodel of the space disguised as Four Square... <br /><br /><br /><br />

				The space looks much better.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know why they thought it was a good idea to make it look like a secret place with the name Square Hardware.&nbsp; Maybe they felt they were getting competition from Kilo across the street which is a restaurant/bar and because of that they made the change<br /><br />
