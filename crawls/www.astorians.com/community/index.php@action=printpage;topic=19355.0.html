				We have primaries for Congress (both Democratic and Republican) and for Attorney General (Democrat) and three primaries for Republicans (Governor and both US Senate seats).&nbsp; EXCITING!!<br /><br />I&#039;m hoping for Carolyn Maloney and Eric Schneiderman myself!

				Looks like they won&#039;t be using the old lever machines - instead, they&#039;ll be using this ballot scanner (http://www.vote-ny.com/english/machine-ds200.php) across NYC.

				And if you&#039;re used to going to vote at P.S.166, don&#039;t be bugging the lunch lady there!&nbsp; You&#039;ve been moved to the neighboring new Frank Sinatra High School for the Performing Arts.&nbsp; Yours truly will refrain from his off-key singing while at the polls.

				Just finished putting in my votes with the new system - was actually kinda fun!&nbsp; Felt like high school scanner tests all over again but without the stress (guess cuz it&#039;s a primary and I&#039;m not stressed over it.)&nbsp; We don&#039;t have much in this district to vote for, but we do have 3 races - so I voted for Maloney, Schneiderman, and Gail Goode.&nbsp; Goode was one of those huh candidates I haven&#039;t much heard anything about, but decided to give her a chance since I like fresh blood once in awhile.&nbsp; She&#039;s seems alright.&nbsp; Maloney&#039;s not fresh blood but she&#039;s been awesome, so no need for a change there.

				I voted this morning at PS 122. Things seemed to be a bit frazzled and I had to take my ballot to another room because the scanner nearest me was busted. Plus, the new voting booths aren&#039;t very private--it would be very easy to see how people are voting if it gets crowded there.<br /><br />Not that I care who knows who I voted for: Eric Schneiderman for Attorney General, Kirsten Gillibrand for Senate, and Carolyn Maloney for Congress!

				I voted at the Ravenswood community Center , about 12:00 PM was #43 there were only 3 races in my district the new machines are great easy to use, but I wonder how they would do if there was a big turnout

				I voted over at PS 70 after work -- no crowd at all, quick, and easy.<br /><br />There were Reshma signs all over near the polling place. Sometimes I think the overkill is enough to turn someone off a candidate. <br /><br />

				First of all.....My polling station at St Joseph on 30th Ave handled things well. My partner and I enjoyed the process and left with a bit of a giggle.....I guess because of the change in machines. <br /><br />Second, I saw all the Reshma signs....as I was walking away from my polling place....talk about a waste of paper.
