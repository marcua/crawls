				i&#39;m so excited that the worst parts about manhattan nightlife have made it to astoria&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br />also if you&#39;re going to bother having a bottle service (ugh) menu on your site, just saying &#39;top shelf&#39; for every sort of liquor makes the whole enterprise seem even more cheesy.<br /><br />it&#39;s days like this that i think paul fussell&#39;s &#39;bad&#39; should be required reading for everyone.

				It is rather interesting that the bad spelling and bad grammar are very prevalent in the threads about this establishment, but not really a problem elsewhere on the board.&nbsp; I wonder if the folks attacking the place and promoting it know each other (or are the same person?)&nbsp; Any attention is good attention if you&#39;re trying to get the name of a place out there.
