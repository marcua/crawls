				There&#039;s a new Chinese massage place a few doors down from Starbucks on Ditmars.&nbsp; The hour massage is only 50 bucks.&nbsp; It&#039;s a no frills place and it&#039;s one large room separated into three spaces for tables so it&#039;s not a place where people do a lot of chatting.&nbsp; It&#039;s open 7 days a week and almost all day long.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />A man gave me my massage and he found every knot in my body and worked it out.&nbsp; A few times it was too hard, but I chose not to tell him to loosen up because he was never in one spot for two long.&nbsp; Afterwards, I was so zoned out, that I went to bed really early.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I am so excited to go back in a few weeks.&nbsp;

				Does anyone know anything about or have any experience with the new massage therapy place on Ditmars?&nbsp; It&#039;s upstairs and just a few doors down from Starbucks, btwn. 31st &amp; 29th Sts.&nbsp; It has a Chinese name I can&#039;t pronounce or remember.&nbsp; I just noticed it last week &amp; picked up one of their flyers but can&#039;t tell if it&#039;s legit, i.e., licensed massage therapists or just a bunch of girls who give you a back rub.&nbsp; My muscles are aching, I need help fast!

				There&#039;s not much privacy.&nbsp; They&#039;ve partitioned off, I think, about 3 cubicles with shoji screens and a curtain.&nbsp; They play classical music.&nbsp; I was the only one there when I went.&nbsp; Don&#039;t know what it&#039;d be like with others around.&nbsp; The prices are $30 for 30 minutes, $50 for one hour but she worked on me more than an hour so you&#039;re not rushed out.&nbsp; Also, they do foot reflexology for $30 a treatment and I think you can choose a hot stone treatment.<br /><br />Chinese Gongfu Tui-Na<br />29-28 Ditmars Blvd., 2nd Floor<br />718-204-7580<br /><br />They have some pamphlets, you can pick up one outside the door (on the street) that explain their kind of massage therapy.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I haven&#039;t used their services, but I work near this place and the people are really nice. They are a new business so it&#039;s not typically busy and it would be great if you could support their business.<br /><br />Entrance is the door to the right of the Starbucks handicap ramp, 2nd floor, go to the right.

Enjoy!

				I walked in yesterday afternoon and had the 30 minute foot reflexology treatment. I highly recommend it! I had never had foot reflexology so did not know what to expect. It felt really good. My only real compaint was the music was very repetitive. Not my cup of tea but otherwise I highly recommend it. <br /><br />Oh, and I don&#039;t know if anyone else has mentioned it but they give a discount card. After 10 (or 9) treatments the 11th (or 10th) is free.

				On the advice of this posting, I tried this place today.&nbsp; While it is definitely a &quot;no frills&quot; atmosphere, the massage was probably the best I&#039;ve ever had.&nbsp; I had a deep tissue massage at Oasis Day Spa a few months back and it was nothing compared to the work my massuse, Lisa, did on me today.&nbsp; She knew what she was doing!&nbsp; I&#039;m by no means a massage&nbsp; expert, but for $52 plus tip, I will most certainly be going back.&nbsp; Oh, and I found their also &quot;no frills&quot; website:&nbsp; http://www.chinesegongfutuina.com/.&nbsp;

				I read in this thread that there&#039;s little privacy - does that mean that you still have to undress?&nbsp; Was it uncomfortable?&nbsp; I really need a massage but was just wondering how it&#039;s done there.&nbsp; In the street fairs, they just do the massage over your clothes, but in salons it&#039;s usually while you&#039;re undressed.&nbsp; &nbsp;

The woman was very strong.&nbsp; I had to ask her to be less strong which was fine.&nbsp; Lisa doesn&#039;t speak much English but there was no problem communicating <br />I parked my car down in front of La Guili and I said I was going to run down before the hour was up so I wouldn&#039;t get a ticket and the man said, that he would take care of it.&nbsp; He asked for my license plate and when it was time, he took care of it. <br />That&#039;s terrific customer service.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I&#039;m sold- I am going to make an appointment very soon. It sounds great for the price, and I neeeeeed deep tissue. Swedish feels like a dutch rub to me. <br /><br />Question, for those who&#039;ve been. Is there a place to keep your keys and stuff while you get massaged? In the room with your clothes? Fine with me, just wondering. Usually at bigger places you get a locker. <br /><br />Thanks for any tips. <br /><br /><br />

				Mmmm I&#039;m yearning for some of that foot reflexology. Most massages are painful to me because I used to HAVE to do them for physical therapy and ever since they&#039;ve lost their novelty. <br /><br />Off topic and I&#039;m about to go search, but if anyone can offer some good/cheap acupuncture I&#039;d be very much appreciated. I&#039;m used to paying $25 for a whole session, which I&#039;m almost sure is going to be impossible here.

				http://www.chinaherb.net/<br /><br />Wan is terrific.&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember exactly but I think her first visit is $65 and then subsequent visits are $50.&nbsp; I usually drive out to Long Island and see someone who charges $65 per visit (after the first which is also more) but stopped once I found Wan.

				I&#039;ve been in the habit of going to this place after I get a haircut at Space since it&#039;s killing two birds with one stone and right across the street.&nbsp; But I haven&#039;t gone since June because I&#039;m concerned it&#039;s not well air conditioned.&nbsp; I shouldn&#039;t jump to that conclusion but it&#039;s not exactly that far out there.&nbsp; They&#039;re very nice people and since they aren&#039;t so fluent in English, I don&#039;t want to go up and feel hot and then walk out and they won&#039;t understand why.&nbsp; So can someone tell me the climate situation if you&#039;ve been on a hot day?&nbsp; Also, if you had the foot massage, tell us what you thought.&nbsp; I always get the backrub and it&#039;s great but I might like the foot massage.

				I just got back from this place..and it was the best $50 I&#039;ve spent for as long as I can remember.&nbsp; The man @ the desk was super nice, gave me water &amp; brought me into the room where he told me to relax for the 10 minutes I had to wait.<br /><br />I&#039;ve gotten lots of massages, around the country for various prices @ spas.&nbsp; For the most part they have focused more on the relaxation end rather then the restorative and healing side of massage. <br /><br />This place isn&#039;t a spa.&nbsp; It was clean, cool &amp; quiet, save for the low talking of the other two massages happening next to me.&nbsp; My therapist really dug into me with long strokes and found knots I didn&#039;t even know I had.&nbsp; She really paid attention and worked them out rather than work on them for a few and then continue on like most traditional spa massages do.&nbsp; I also liked the fact that when she worked on my legs and feet she went all the way up the muscle to the top of my butt.&nbsp; Most places don&#039;t for a few reasons.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t feel awkward or uncomfortable.&nbsp; She was just working the muscle from the bottom of my foot all the way up.<br /><br />I am super sore &amp; drinking a lot of water...and thinking of when I can go back to have the rest of the knots rubbed away.

				We just got back for our first time there, and are pretty happy. We did a 50-mile mountain bike race yesterday that took over ten hours, so we figured it was about time! I&#039;ve only had one other massage in my life, so I can&#039;t compare it to much. <br /><br />Our masseuses were Luce (?) and Susan. Both of us agree that we were in pain for much of the upper-back/ shoulder stuff, but figured it was due to already being sore. Plus, we just wanted to get the muscles the necessary work!<br /><br />So now we&#039;re slightly more sore&nbsp; :-P but expect to sleep well tonight. I definitely like this place!&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				Its hard to find a good massage therapist and i guess u really have to click with the person in your session . I always need deep pressure but sometimes , it seems no matter how good someone may know their strokes , the pressure for me isnt enough. Thats when i even ask for them to step on me .If done correctly , hmmmm its amazing . Feel every rib crack back into place , like getting adjusted . <br />Anyone gone to Space on ditmars for a massage ?&nbsp; I head maria (short blonde hair) was very good .

				Guess I&#039;m dusting off old threads today.<br /><br />My back is killing me after pool time with the nieces/nephews this weekend, and a massage should help. But they&#039;re not picking up the phone although the website&#039;s still up&nbsp; :? Hope they&#039;re still in business.

				My husband and I both went for the hour massage/bodywork today at www.chinesegongfutuina.com/. It was incredible and very thorough. Seriously intense (i&#039;m quite sure I am going to be sore tomorrow) but they got out knots that have been plaguing me for months. I had Susan, my husband had Rose, and we were both very pleased and will be back.<br /><br />&nbsp;Like other posters have said previously, this is not your day spa type massage. But if you tend to have chronic problems from sports injuries or training or intense stress or something, this can be a big help. <br /><br />
