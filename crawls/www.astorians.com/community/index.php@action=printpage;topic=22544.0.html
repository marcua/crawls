				Agree with the Bahn Mi/Vietnamese idea<br /><br />But my first choice is an outpost of Grand Sichuan so we could actually get <span class="bbc_u">edible</span> Chinese food in Astoria<br /><br />There was a Kosher Deli near where Sanfords is, somewhere between that and Parisi Bakery -<br />they went out of business before the end of 1996, but I did eat there twice. That idea is a longshot, because its just not a viable business model anymore, but it would be nice option.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Somewhere to get really healthy food that&#039;s not totally bland and crappy would be great. Really fresh salads not just the normal boring deli salads , good smoothies that aren&#039;t full of sugar and artificial fruit, and healthy wraps and protein bowls. We had one place called Juice for Life which was healthy but it&#039;s hours were funky and it&#039;s delivery was not offered most of the day and it went under. I don&#039;t have time to cook a lot and can&#039;t order out because most all takeout is not very healthy, I&#039;m the type that can&#039;t look at fries without gaining weight.
