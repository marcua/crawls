				It scares the bejesus out of me that this convenient hyper religious zealoutry used on both sides to justify bloodletting to break up the monotomy of mutually-assured thuggery existence occasionally takes life and limb of innocents along with the chickens.&#160; I wait for the Pat Robertsons of the world to comb that New Testiment book for rationalization for a crop of judeo-christian vest-wearers (don&#039;t think for a moment that the titans over at Bob Jones University aren&#039;t hard at work on that one).&#160; During last week&#039;s &quot;America at a Crossroads&quot; series I saw video of a Indonesian Islamic radical who says afterwards he&#039;ll be on a mattress &quot;for a thousand years with beautiful angels WITH NO BORDOM.&quot;&#160; These terror bombers are not gonna get caught in their just reward with angels that can&#039;t produce.&#160; Now how can we compete with that??<br /><br />- Cannibal

Although elements&nbsp; of any grievance&nbsp; can have&nbsp; a&nbsp; &#039;legitimate&#039; foundation, even the nazis&nbsp; &nbsp;could&nbsp; point&nbsp; to the Versailles&nbsp; treaty,&nbsp; the end result of sharing&nbsp; power&nbsp; with people who want you dead can never&nbsp; work.
