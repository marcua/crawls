				OK, I&#039;m on a budget and I&#039;m on disability. I almost had a heart attack today when I ordered dinner from the local diner. We ordered a grilled veggie sandwich deluxe, a blue cheese burger deluxe and 2 sodas for a total of $33. Maybe I am totally out of the loop of what things cost, but this seems a little outrageous. Granted, I was able to make 2 meals out of my sandwich because it was so huge, but still..... I am going to be ordering out more often now that I am on disability, so I need to find some decent affordable places that deliver. I am in the Broadway area. If you have any suggestions I&#039;d really appreciate it. We eat all types of food.

				Light Bites on Steinway and Broadway.&nbsp; Inexpensive, some of it is healthy, and ooooooohh so good.&nbsp; They do deliver so that is a plus.

				Greeneyedgirl - are you comfortable saying what dinner it was?&nbsp; That sounds really excessive.

				It was Sanford. We have their menu here and I figured it should have come to $16-20. I called to question the prices and they told me I was looking at an old menu. I could have gone out to eat someplace nicer for that price. I will def try Lite Bites though.

				I would highly recommend the Belaire Diner on 21st St. and Broadway. Their delivery is lightening quick and prices are very reasonable.&nbsp; I agree that Sanford&#039;s prices are a bit high, but their food (especially their delicious foccacia sandwiches!) is always tasty and of very good quality.&nbsp; The atmosphere in the diner is very nice too, so perhaps it&#039;s a better idea to eat there.

				I liked the sanford diner when I went there with a friend.&nbsp; The only drawback to that diner was that they didn&#039;t accept credit cards, and is a cash only establishment.<br /><br />Michaels on Broadway is very nice diner and inexpensive as well.

				I have been very disappointed with the Sanford lately. I also ordered off an old menu as well and got a big shock when the delivery guy handed me the bill. I wish Bel Aire was closer- though they probably would deliver to my neck of the woods. (Broadway and 29th Street). <br /><br />
