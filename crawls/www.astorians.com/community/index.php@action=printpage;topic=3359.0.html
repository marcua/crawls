				There for a while I was really on a roll - I went every morning.<br /><br />I know it sounds awful but I think it is easier just to adjust to an earlier wakeup time than to go back and forth and get up a different time every day. <br /><br />Do you want to give it a go tomorrow morning? I&#39;ll get my sneakers ready and iron my gym shorts.

				I had been trying to go in the morning for a while too - it was working out well for a while until I slacked off big time. I may be up for tomorrow - I have a late night tonight so not definite, but I can try.... if not, other days would be great.

				Jonathan and I were at NYSC at 5:35 this AM.&nbsp; We&#39;ll see how often THAT happens. <br /><br />&nbsp;7am !!! That would be dreamy - Once my school year is further under way - I may start aiming for a 7:30 train rather than a 7.... but that still puts me at the gym by 6! <br /><br />&nbsp;Now if only I could get really organized... I could bring my stuff with me to the gym - shower there... leave my gym clothes in a locker all day and then pick them up on my way home in the eve....&nbsp; &nbsp;I can fantasize about that organized woman.&nbsp; Instead I generally run around the apartment for 20 min in the am yelling - &#39;where are my keys?&#39; &#39;where is my wallet?&#39;<br /><br />&nbsp;:-) :-)<br /><br />

				Leaving your gym clothes in a locker and picking them up at the end of the day? Now that&#39;s a smart idea... I wonder why I had never thought of that! I hate lugging everything around with me.

				I really need to start working out again and morning is the most logical time but I can&#39;t get awake enough to get up that early.<br /><br />I think I need to start going to bed at 9.00.

				Is NYSC really crowded in the morning? I was thinking of trying to start up a morning gym routine, but if I have to wait for machines at 6am, it&#39;s really not worth it.

				Sorry to thread-necro this, but I figured I&#039;d hit it up instead of starting a new one.&nbsp; Did this ever work out?<br /><br />I&#039;m looking for a workout buddy to hit up Matrix, probably decently early in the AM.&nbsp; I&#039;m a HORRIBLE morning person and I&#039;m also pretty crappy at motivating myself.&nbsp; As you can tell, this partnership might not be as beneficial for you as for me.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m a tall, skinny guy that&#039;s got about 3 months TOTAL free-weight workout experience.&nbsp; You could say, I suck at using them, but I want to get better.<br /><br />If any of you are interested in hitting the gym, or even just meeting up in the AM to run (usually around 2-3 miles at this point, but I&#039;ll do more with a few weeks warm-up) or even lap swimming at Astoria Pool, let me know.<br /><br />Thanks.
