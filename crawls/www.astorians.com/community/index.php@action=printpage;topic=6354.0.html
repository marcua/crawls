				I am firmly in the camp of &quot;we should never have gone in&quot;, and I hate GWB, I hate our war strategy (or lack there of), it saddens me every time i read about a US Soldier dieing in a war that should never have been fought in the first place, BUT, having said that, I feel we cannot pull out. We broke it, and we need to fix it.....the below link pretty much summarizes my logic. Just want to see what others think will happen if we pull out of iraq in the near term (say 10 months)<br /><br />http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070515/ts_nm/iraq_alqaeda_dc

				The problem is that we may not be able to fix it, as hard as we may try.&nbsp; There will be chaos if we pull out, and chaos if we stay there.&nbsp; I think that reminding everyone of the sacrifices of World War II is irrelevant in today&#039;s world.&nbsp; It is a different time, we are in a different place.&nbsp; No one really wants to sacrifice.&nbsp; We are probably the most spoiled generation who have it all!&nbsp; We do not have the stomach for a long and protracted war.&nbsp; At this rate, we will be at about 5,000 fallen troops by next year.&nbsp; I think the American public will not take much more than that.&nbsp; Sometimes, if you break it, as hard as you try you cannot fix it!

				I supported&nbsp; the&nbsp; removal of Saddam and&nbsp; still believe&nbsp; it was the right&nbsp; thing to do. Saddam had violated&nbsp; the cease-fire&nbsp; for a decade, and everyone from Clinton to&nbsp; most Iraqis&nbsp; wanted him out. We are fighting the Islamicfascists&nbsp; on many fronts&nbsp; and Iraq is only part of it. I hope&nbsp; the Iraqis&nbsp; wil be able to stablize it enough so they can take&nbsp; over. Losing is&nbsp; NOT an option. If we pull out too soon, we wil have&nbsp; a second Iran, run by religious&nbsp; fanatics who will definately not stop their&nbsp; decades&nbsp; old war&nbsp; on the West.

				First of all, we should never have been there in the first place.<br /><br />No link to Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, or the September 11th attacks. &nbsp;No WMDs. &nbsp;No justification. &nbsp;None. <br /><br />This administration squandered enormous opportunity and global sympathy in the wake of those attacks in favor of personal vendettas and economic gain. &nbsp;It has eroded civil rights here at home, illegaly spied on it&#039;s own citizens, held prisoners without benefit of charge or trial, engaged in torture, miscalculated the cost of war (50 billion originally estimated, now about to hit 400 billion), returned us to debtor nation status, eroded much of the world&#039;s admiration of our nation, and all in the name of &quot;Spreading Democracy.&quot; &nbsp;Oh yes, and only one person has been found and tried in connection to 9-11, the impetus of this war.<br /><br />Be angry, they&#039;ve earned your distrust and ire.<br /><br />That being said, how do we fix Iraq? &nbsp;I don&#039;t know. &nbsp;Timetables for withdrawl are not the answer. &nbsp;An indefinite stay by US troops is not the answer. &nbsp;I firmly believe the only solution is a strong-willed home-grown Iraqi Leader. &nbsp;Unfortunately, though, the only ones on the horizon are Islamic Fundamentalists.<br /><br />The only real way to fix it is to give what the majority of the region wants, a full withdrawl of all US interests in the region. &nbsp;And no support of Israel. &nbsp;But that is far, farfarfarfarFAR, from any realistic foreign policy.<br /><br />Hey, has anyone (other than Nancy Pelosi) thought of talking? &nbsp;Maybe a little Diplomacy? &nbsp;Invite everyone to big round table and hash things out.<br /><br />No, I&#039;m not naive. &nbsp;I understand there is a time for talking and a time for action. &nbsp;A need for retribution in the form of a 2000 pound bomb, but only on those who&#039;ve earned it. &nbsp;<br />

				I think the only possible way for stability is to split the country, like yugoslavia, into different ethno centric states. A Kurd state in the North, Sunni state in the West, and a Shia state in the South. For this to work, however, we would absolutley need dialogue with the neigboring countries. The Turks would almost certainly not stand for a Kurd State. What doesn&#039;t get much press is how much the sectarian viloence in Iraq is fueled by money pouring in from Saudi Arabia (to the sunnis) and Iran (to the Shias) SA and Iran are very much enemies.<br /><br />&nbsp;But in order to ensure no further unrest, the resources of Iraq need to be shared amongst the 3 countires. Oil is in the north, and the pipes are in the south. The US should create refining abilities in the Sunni region so that all 3 areas can make money. If the people are making money, they will be less likely to fight, i think. <br /><br />Gosh, now I&#039;m even on a tangent. I think, though, if we pull out, 9/11 could legitimately look minute to further attacks. And to Reiterate, I HATE this war. Iraq actually has somewhat of an infrastructure. Afghanistan doesnt have electricty in 90% of the country (maybe even more). With more resources at their disposal, I&#039;d be fearful of what Al Qaeda could pull off.

				I think a good portion of the problem is that nobody in that part of the world (and not very many people outside of that part of the world) trust George Bush&#039;s motives at all. In general, I tend to support nation-building sorts of exercises, but nobody believes that the Bush administration could possibly have anyone&#039;s best interests at stake, because of 6 years of lies and ineptitude. Honestly, what&#039;s needed is new, trustworthy, leadership at the top, more than any specific strategy change. Get a Democrat in there who will apologize for the mistakes and improve the region&#039;s view of American policy, and maybe there&#039;ll be a slim chance (instead of no chance) of turning Iraq around. Unfortunately, that&#039;s not going to happen for almost two more years. Until then, there&#039;s essentially no hope for Iraq, regardless of the strategery. Either it will stay a low-level civil war as it is now, or somebody will manage to assassinate the Iraqi government and it&#039;ll become a bigger civil war, or the US will pull most soldiers out and it&#039;ll become a bigger civil war. Regardless, Bush can&#039;t win.<br />

				I hate to say it, but heff is right, the only way Iraq will be a peaceful country anytime in the near future is for another dictator to arise and take power. It will be ugly, many people will die, and right now it looks like the only person with the influence and charisma to do it is Moqtada al-Sadr, so it will not be in any way friendly to the US, but it is probably the only way that Iraq will get back to the point where the lights stay on at night and kids can get to school in the morning.

				The problem though is that we will never really pull out, the whole purpose of us going there was to establish a certain permanent base.&nbsp; If we pulled out of the whole region, things might take a better turn.&nbsp; I dont think things would be stable in the US if we had a foreign goverment establish military bases here and take away our resources.&nbsp; There would be factions inside that would be fighting for power and we would be revolting against the colonizer.&nbsp; So the same applies to Iraq.&nbsp; We might take a considerable number of troops away but the sad truth is that we actually wont ever pull out because of the interests at stake and we have yet to pull out our military bases from the other countries surrounding where there was no declared &quot;war&quot;:<br />- Bahrain<br />- Qattar<br />- Oman<br />-Kuwait<br />- Saudi Arabia<br /><br />Not to mention we have aircraft carriers surrounding the bodies of water in the whole region.

				Uh... if we pull out, Iraq won&#039;t get pregnant??<br /><br /><br />Going to be alone here or very close to it, but an enemy that doesn&#039;t care if they live or die can&#039;t be reasoned with, bargained with and certainly is not going to be dealt with using kid gloves.<br /><br />My two analogies on this are as follows:<br /><br />The first and simplest is, &quot;you can&#039;t swat a rabid dog on the nose with a rolled up newspaper&quot;<br /><br />The second is, there is no cure for cancer.&nbsp; &nbsp;You treat it by nuking it, or removing it aggressively.&nbsp; Sometimes when you remove cancer, some viable tissue must be removed as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sucks to be them.<br /><br />These are just my opinions, stated plainly.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some may agree, most will likely not.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have no desire to enter into a debate about my views, nor do I wish to justify them with facts and figures.&nbsp; &nbsp;Honestly, I have too much crap going on in my life at the moment to pay all that much attention to politics and anything in the press or on TV is so totally skewed one way or another, you can&#039;t believe any of them.

This is&nbsp; different, they will not&nbsp; just&nbsp; go away cause&nbsp; we leave, if anything, they have proven when we abandoned&nbsp; the Northern Alliance&nbsp; in Afghan and the Shah&nbsp; in Iran to become&nbsp; even more aggressive and&nbsp; 9/11&nbsp; was just the opening shot. we can sit around and&nbsp; self-flaggelate, and sure&nbsp; we have supported&nbsp; some SOB&#039;s top counter&nbsp; other&nbsp; SOB&#039;s&nbsp; but, this is for&nbsp; the survival&nbsp; of freedom, such as&nbsp; it&nbsp; is, for&nbsp; us to argue&nbsp; here&nbsp; and&nbsp; &nbsp;not&nbsp; be shut down.

				One sided coverage???&nbsp; Do you recall the days when the media went along blindly with this doomed plan?&nbsp; They were like puppets in the beginning, the voice of the administration and none of them had the b--ls to report anything to the contrary.&nbsp; I have kept many of those cowardly articles from four years ago so that I would remember the days when fair reporting died in this country.&nbsp; Bush banished poor Helen (don&#039;t recall her name) to the back of his Press Conferences so that he could avoid answering her tough questions.&nbsp; Everything was scripted - the mushroom cloud / get them over there before we have to fight them on the streets over here / weapons of mass destruction / democracy is messy / being greeted with flowers / shall I go on?&nbsp; <br /><br />Do any of you recall those days?&nbsp; Can anyone tell me what happened to being greeting with flowers and the weapons of mass destruction?&nbsp; And please do not say that everyone believed there were weapons of mass destruction.&nbsp; I, for one did not!

				The United States traditionally makes a bad occupier. And that&#039;s not a bad thing. So it&#039;s time we got back to doing what we do best and get the hell outta there. We&#039;re not by nature imperial, we suck at it. Time to pack up and go home.<br /><br />Start with a drawdown and keep a temporary presence of <em>no more than </em> 50,000 to bolster the Iraqi army and protect Kurds until the country becomes more stable. But the IRaqis must be allowed decide whether they want to descend further into civil war or not. It;s just sh*tty that we precipitated this mess in the first place, and made it worse through incompetence/arrogance or whatever. But the only viable solution I see is a phased withdrawal. We&#039;re not accomplishing any national security objectives anymore. We&#039;re just chasing armed gangs who seem to be more intent on targeting each other (but mostly innocent civilians) than U.S. forces.<br /><br />As for Al Qaeda, they won&#039;t last in Iraq because the Iraqis themselves don&#039;t want them there. Sunni tribal leaders are already turnign their militias against them, and the Shiites are mortal enemies of Al Qaeda. They&#039;ll have better success (and have already) setting up cells in North America and Europe. Especially Europe.<br /><br />Best way to deal that threat is to pick up stakes, too. I&#039;m a big believer of reinstating and bolstering U.S. isolationism. That means greatly reducing our commitment abroad and let the world fend for itself (sorry, Darfur, but that&#039;s the breaks). Why get invovled somewhere when you&#039;ll eventually be hated for doing so -- even if well-intentioned? Our history is bloodied by such adventurism, which usually led to worse repercussions: Central America, Southeast Asia, Lebanon, Iraq, Somalia...<br /><br />The principles we hold near and dear seem to be left behind whenever we leave our shores. Not sure why, but that&#039;s what happens.<br /><br />Besides, we&#039;ve got a lot more important thigns to focus on here. Education, health care, individual liberties, privacy rights, economy, infrastructure, and on and on.<br /><br />The U.S. needs to go on strike.

				That is the question I usually ask wrt Bill O&#039;Reilly--If we&#039;re far left, who is center left?<br /><br />Some good posts on this thread.&nbsp; I did think we ought to stay for a bit when the &quot;war&quot; was still young and I thought the mess was fixable.&nbsp; You break &#039;em, you buy &#039;em.&nbsp; But now it seems clear that nothing good is likely to come from this occupation.&nbsp; <br /><br />If we pulled out we&#039;d save a lot of lives, both American and Iraqi.&nbsp; And no, I don&#039;t think the Iraqis would &quot;follow us home&quot;; anything is possible but that&#039;s not very likely.&nbsp; I remember almost the same thing was said about the war in Vietnam--that if we left Vietnam the Chinese would follow us home.<br /><br />Of course, just as with Vietnam, the Right would get busy with their stab-in-the-back theory.
