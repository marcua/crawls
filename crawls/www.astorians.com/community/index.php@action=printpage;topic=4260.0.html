				http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/293972_jonessoda29.html<br /><br />Jones Soda will switch to pure cane sugar<br /><br />By CRAIG HARRIS<br />P-I REPORTER<br /><br />Jones Soda Co., looking for a marketing advantage, is making the switch to pure cane sugar from high fructose corn syrup as a soda sweetener.<br /><br />&quot;It&#39;s better for you, it&#39;s better-tasting and, overall, it&#39;s better for the environment,&quot; Peter van Stolk, the company&#39;s chief executive officer, said Tuesday.<br /><br />Seattle-based Jones, which makes root beer, cream soda and quirky drinks with flavors such as turkey and gravy, will sell 12-ounce canned sodas with pure cane sugar after Jan. 1. All of the company&#39;s products will make the switch by mid-2007, van Stolk said.<br /><br />The change at Jones Soda comes at a time when high fructose corn syrup, which became a common sweetener for sodas in the late 1970s and early 1980s, has received negative publicity as being linked to obesity and diabetes. <br /><br />Even Oprah Winfrey, who wields influence over consumers, has encouraged viewers on her show to avoid high fructose corn syrup. <br /><br />Jones is following the lead of other small bottlers who are touting the use of pure cane sugar as making their products taste better. <br /><br />&quot;Jones Soda is a treat. It&#39;s an indulgence,&quot; van Stolk said. &quot;If you are going to sell a treat, you should make people feel good about it. Pure cane sugar has a different taste. It&#39;s a cleaner taste, and people feel good about it. It&#39;s a little thing. But in the beverage industry, it&#39;s really challenging to do.&quot;<br /><br />Van Stolk said his company is able to make the switch because Jones Soda remains a relatively small operation. He said major operations such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi would have a difficult time making a major conversion.<br /><br />Bottling companies made the switch to high fructose corn syrup in the late 1970s when sugar prices increased. Since then, the syrup has become a common ingredient in foods and beverages.<br /><br />Audrae Erickson, president of the Washington, D.C.-based Corn Refiners Association, said high fructose syrup is a safe ingredient, and she said obesity rates have climbed in other countries, such as Mexico, where there is little use of it.<br /><br />Susan Gins, a Seattle-based nutritionist, said there&#39;s a belief in the medical community that high fructose corn syrup can increase diabetes and other epidemic diseases caused by obesity. <br /><br />Gins said the body has difficulty processing high fructose corn syrup at high levels.<br /><br />In Dublin, Texas, pure cane sugar has been a key ingredient in Dublin Dr Pepper, which began selling the popular soft drink in 1891.<br /><br />&quot;It&#39;s just a superior product when you use pure cane sugar than corn syrup,&quot; said Amanda Rasberry, an administrator at the Dublin facility. &quot;It&#39;s just a better-quality taste.&quot;<br /><br />Don Rubenstein, owner of Dr Soda in Pacoima, Calif., said that during the past 18 months, smaller bottling companies have started using pure cane sugar. <br /><br />He said some bottlers in Southern California and in the Southwest are making the change to compete against soft drinks made in Mexico.<br /><br />In addition to sodas, Jones Soda develops, produces and markets ready-to-drink organic teas, citrus energy drinks and non-carbonated juices and teas.
