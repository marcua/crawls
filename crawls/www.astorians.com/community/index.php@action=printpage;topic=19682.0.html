				In the past we&#039;ve had discussions about UPS, FedEx, and the United States Postal Service, but does anyone have anything good to say about A-1?&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d never even heard of them till I saw their name on my latest Amazon order.<br /><br />They claim to have tried to deliver my package last Friday at 9:10 <span class="bbc_u">at night</span>.&nbsp; A pretty damn unusual time for residential deliveries.&nbsp; They didn&#039;t offer any further information about when their next delivery attempt would be, and Amazon has a two year history of complaints about this company, which apparently doesn&#039;t return phone calls.&nbsp; There was no update till this morning (Monday) when they updated with &quot;Out for delivery 9:03 <span class="bbc_u">AM</span>.&nbsp; That was about 11 hours ago and I still don&#039;t have my package and have no idea if they are going to make an attempt to deliver tonight.&nbsp; Of course I&#039;ve been letting Amazon know about this, but with a two year history of complaints, it&#039;s clear Amazon doesn&#039;t care.&nbsp; <br /><br />The thing about UPS, FedEx, and the USPS is that you can almost always get someone on the phone.&nbsp; You might not like their answer, but someone does pick up the phone.&nbsp; <br /><br />To people who don&#039;t order things over the internet it might seem strange that anyone in New York City would shop online since you supposedly can get anything here.&nbsp; Shopping on line gives you the opportunity to comparison shop, know for certain that what you want is in stock, and frees you from carrying bulky items on mass transit or attempting to fit them in your car.&nbsp; So, neither Amazon or A-1 is going out of business any time soon, but if you do place an order with Amazon you might want to tell them that if they ship it by A-1 you will cancel your order, and then follow through.<br /><br />I&#039;m giving A-1&#039;s web address because if you do a net search for A-1 Courier Services, which is how Amazon refers to them, you&#039;re likely to come to a company that has nothing to do with the A-1 Amazon uses.<br /><br />http://www.aoneonline.com/pages/customers/amazon.html (http://www.aoneonline.com/pages/customers/amazon.html)

				They are terrible.<br /><br />They were supposed to deliver two packages to me over the last few years from Amazon, neither arrived, both got sent back and they did the same type of stunts they&#039;re doing with you.&nbsp; They pretend to attempt deliveries and are very unhelpful.&nbsp; I&#039;m sad to see their still in business and still doing deliveries for Amazon.

				I haven&#039;t had anything &quot;delivered&quot; by A-1 recently, but they &quot;delivered&quot; a couple of my Amazon orders a couple years ago.&nbsp; One simply never arrived, and I had to email Amazon and tell them to send another one (which they did, right away) and the other, after two bullshit &quot;attempts&quot; to deliver (both at times when I was home), they ended up mailing to me anyway.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard that A-1 is a guy in a beat-up old van - can&#039;t confirm or refute.

				I&#039;ve had stuff delivered from Amazon by a courier a couple of times recently (can&#039;t recall which one).&nbsp; I thought it was odd but didn&#039;t investigate further since my package was delivered when it was supposed to be.

				I checked the Amazon website again and the delivery status still shows yesterday morning, 9:03 AM, as the last update, so I called Amazon, had their rep look at that and said I wanted <span class="bbc_u">Amazon</span> to call the company to find out what was going on.&nbsp; It took her at least two tries to get through to them, but she brought a manager from A-1 onto the line and he said he didn&#039;t know where the package was and it would take 24 hours to investigate.&nbsp; <br /><br />I told Amazon to send me out a new order with a guarantee that a different shipper would be used, and that it would be a nice idea for them to upgrade the shipping speed at no additional cost to me.&nbsp; She had the A-1 manager agree that the current order was being &quot;refused&quot; so she could resend the order, overnight delivery, but that she couldn&#039;t guarantee a different shipper would be used.&nbsp; I told her if I saw that A-1 was being used I would cancel the order.&nbsp; The only reason I&#039;m continuing this order with Amazon was because they charged a lot less for one item than other places I checked. <br /><br />Overnight shipping still does not guarantee that I will get my package tomorrow because residential deliveries are not given guaranteed delivery times, and I can&#039;t stay home all day tomorrow waiting.<br /><br />If I knew what business insurance company A-1 uses, I would contact them and suggest they look into A-1&#039;s &quot;loss&quot; claims.&nbsp;

				i&#039;ve seen this service in action before.&nbsp; A-1 delivers from an old beat up van with no identification on the sides such as a company name.&nbsp; the worker is dressed in street clothes, and not a professional delivery uniform such as ups, fed-ex, or usps.&nbsp; i&#039;ve seen him leave packages on doorsteps and toss them through windows when nobody is home.&nbsp; i once chatted him up to find out what the hell is going on, and he says he is &quot;amazons delivery service&quot; and only handles amazon orders.&nbsp; i have bought things from amazon and gotten them delivered by usps, fed-ex, and ups, without me ever specifying what service i would like used.&nbsp; i&#039;m not sure how which delivery service is chosen, but i guess its good to know and choose which retailer you go with accordingly.&nbsp;

				Most places I&#039;ve seen that offer a choice, offers the choice of UPS or the USPS.&nbsp; <br /><br />I contacted Barnes &amp; Noble and they said they use UPS or SmartMail, and that SmartMail/SMS redistributes to the post office.&nbsp; For our delivery pleasure, most B &amp; N orders seem to come from New Jersey and get to our neighborhood fast.<br /><br />The thing is, a lot of the times we order something, it&#039;s everything else under the sun, not books/music/movies, and Amazon is like a department store.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s anything else to compare to Amazon.&nbsp; I often find an item on Amazon, then search the seller&#039;s/manufacturer&#039;s own website and while the price is often the same, the shipping is less on Amazon, and Amazon has some things other than books/music/movies that you can combine for free shipping.<br /><br />I&#039;m still really angry at Amazon.&nbsp; Even though they show the replacement order to be delivered tomorrow, they still show the original order, which still has yesterday morning as the latest update in delivery status.&nbsp; To make matters worse, I used a debit card, not a credit card, and it&#039;s an E*Trade card, and we&#039;ll have to launch a separate thread with warnings about E*Trade.

				A few weeks ago I ordered an overnight package from Amazon.&nbsp; It was to be delivered from A-1 Courier.&nbsp; I waited all day for the package to be delivered.&nbsp; No package came.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I tracked the package on the website it stated that the package was delivered to local post office for delivery.&nbsp; I called A-1 Courier with no one answering.&nbsp; Got a recorded&nbsp; message to call back during regular business hours.&nbsp; I then called Amazon.&nbsp; The women on the line was telling me that a courier would never do that until she also tracked it and seemed very surprised about this.&nbsp; I cancelled the order with Amazon.&nbsp; I refused the package when it did come 3 days later by regular mail.&nbsp; I use to think UPS was bad.&nbsp; Now they kind of look like saints compared to this company.

				And sure enough, they&#039;re sending out the replacement with... A-1.&nbsp; So I called up and cancelled the one remaining order I have with Amazon and specified that the reason I was cancelling was because they&#039;re using A-1 again on this current order.

				I haven&#039;t ordered anything from Amazon in a long time, but I&#039;m curious—have any of you taken the time to write to them?<br /><br />In my experience, when you actually take the time to sit down and write a letter describing the incident and your dissatisfaction, the company will respond. And if all of you did that - it just takes a few minutes - maybe they&#039;d drop this courier. <br /><br />I have to wonder too in how many other areas of the country that this is happening with either branches of this<br />company or others that operate just as badly.<br /><br />If enough people took the action to put their complaints in writing, Amazon would have no choice but to take action.<br /><br />It&#039;s just a thought......<br />

				Yes, I did read that, but when you take the time to put pen to paper, believe me - it makes a difference. <br />I&#039;ve done it a few times and got the results I wanted. If all of you took five minutes to actually type up, <br />sign and snail-mail a letter to their corporate office, they&#039;d do something.

				If Amazon is taking the time to record the complaints being made through their first level of customer service, they must be doing something with that information.&nbsp; And they <em>do</em> take a lot of time to record what the customer is saying - they&#039;ll put you on hold for minute if need be to check with a supervisor or to get another party on the line - time is money.&nbsp; But low bidding contracts are money, too.&nbsp; The only thing that will change Amazon&#039;s connection with A-1 is if A-1 loses a lot of merchandise.<br /><br />I got my package today.&nbsp; It was delivered by a nice guy driving a nice SUV.&nbsp; He and the vehicle looked neat and clean, but he wasn&#039;t wearing a uniform and the car wasn&#039;t marked.&nbsp; That&#039;s how A-1 is keeping their costs down.&nbsp; <br /><br />Maybe I didn&#039;t get the guy/vehicle other people described because this was an elite delivery - A-1 had already screwed up one delivery and at my request Amazon sent the replacement overnight.&nbsp; But my trust in Amazon is gone - I don&#039;t want to risk a repeat of the A-1 experience: they left the status of the original shipment as &quot;out for delivery&quot; for 48 hours, they don&#039;t answer their phone, and there&#039;s definitely no one to speak to after 8 pm.

				I don&#039;t have much to add to this in regards to A-1 delivery service.<br /><br />However:<br /><br />Never use your debit card to shop online.&nbsp; The protections that credit cards have are applicable to debit cards in a lot of cases.&nbsp; In the case that someone does obtain your number, they could clean out the account the card was associated with leaving you with little recourse.<br /><br />ONLY shop online with credit cards.&nbsp; Never use a debit card.

				&nbsp;:x<br /><br />A1 Courier Service is garbage... that is all!&nbsp; Actually I have been complaining about this company to anyone that will hear me (including Amazon) for the last few years.&nbsp; Anytime there is a Saturday delivery through Amazon, I cringe because I will most likely get stuck with A1 (not delivering my package).<br /><br />I have gotten so many orders replaced through Amazon these last few years.&nbsp; Not only for different orders but multiple replacements for one order!!&nbsp; One time there was 2 blu rays that were re-shipped 3 times!&nbsp; Yes... you read that right.&nbsp; Horrible service and A1&#039;s customer service is the worst.&nbsp; Someone nasty just answers and they don&#039;t have any info.&nbsp; Amazon had informed me that as long as there are enough complaints on file then (maybe) they would consider dropping them.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t hold my breath back then.<br /><br />The best part is when you track your stuff and it says that it has arrived... it really hasn&#039;t.&nbsp; The package mysteriously ends up in my mailbox at 10pm.&nbsp; At this point after 7:30pm I had already spoken to Amazon about a replacement.&nbsp; Amazon must be losing so much money in merchandise and my Prime shipping alone still dealing with this shady character.&nbsp; I say character because it is truly a beat up white van (as confirmed) with a young kid in the passenger&#039;s side that drops runs to the mailbox and drops it off.<br /><br />How do I know that?&nbsp; I saw it last week with my own two eyes.&nbsp; Luckily, the delivery was not for me but for someone 2 doors down.&nbsp; The kid (maybe 11?) ran to the mailbox and dropped the Amazon box in.&nbsp; I asked my husband who they were and he said, &quot;Oh, that&#039;s A1 Steak sauce&quot;...&nbsp; I laughed and questioned if he was sure and he explained that, that is the guy who (if we are lucky) always drops off our packages.<br /><br />Are you kidding me?&nbsp; So... it is a tiny operation that does a horrible job.&nbsp; YUCK to steak sauce.
