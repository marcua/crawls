				I have seen a couple of spaces for rent in the area and I wanted to get other people&#039;s opinions about what is needed in the Ditmars area. I saw Oleput(spell check) and some other businesses have gone under, so what do you think would be cool to have in the area. I was thinking a cool organic smoothie place with wraps, sandwiches, drinks, etc.<br /><br />This is kind of an unofficial survery, so what do you think.

				I think Ditmars could use a specialty beer store. We&#039;ve got good selection at 30th Ave between the 21st Ave distributor and EuroMarket and there&#039;s Heliopolis on Broadway, but Ditmars doesn&#039;t have much in the way of really gourmet or lots of microbrews. Key Foods has a decent selection, but a real beer store would be cool.

				Seeing as it&#039;s the restaurant &amp; food section, Vietnamese would be nice, or a gourmet soup place.&nbsp; A crab bar, of course, would only benefit me and I couldn&#039;t keep it in business.<br /><br />...or a bookstore with edible books.&nbsp; food for thought

				Actually, I&#039;d like a 30Ave type cafe or internet place like Freezepeach. &nbsp;We only have the one greek cafe on 23rd Ave, and we will be severely lacking in internet wifi spots. &nbsp;Ice cream and soup place is awesome too.

				<em>edible books.&nbsp; food for thought</em><br /><br />&nbsp;:-D good one! We&#039;re drowning in the BF&#039;s book collection so this sounds like an excellent idea to me.<br /><br />I vote for a small/basic deli that serves take-out breakfast in the morning; healthy take-out in the daytime; cafe in the evening. We&#039;re lacking the basics in that regard.<br /><br />The Coffee Bar under the Ditmars Blvd. stop on 31st is on the right track... but I&#039;m guessing that it&#039;ll be the next business to close. For some reason, it&#039;s not working as a cafe, my guess is due to the lack of windows and no people-watching. But there&#039;s loads of room and cheap food available.

				Harlan - you got me curious, so I gave them a call.&nbsp; They do in fact deliver to some streets around Ditmars, including mine!&nbsp; (They asked for my specific block, so it&#039;s obviously close to the edge of their delivery zone.&nbsp; They advised that it would take about 10 minutes longer because of the distance, or about 45 minutes.)&nbsp; I know most places on 30th Ave. or south don&#039;t, so I made an assumption -- sorry about that.&nbsp; I&#039;ll definitely consider ordering from them in the future.&nbsp; But it would still be nice to have an Indian restaurant to go to around Ditmars.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />The service issues I referred to were in-house, so maybe delivery is fine.&nbsp; In fact, one of the issues was that they waited to serve us until they had finished preparing all their delivery orders, including ones that obviously came in while we were sitting there.&nbsp; The food was good, although the lamb vindaloo was hopelessly underspiced.

				I&#039;d love a great vegetarian restaurant, with a good selection of vegan foods. You can find a vegetarian option on the menu at most Astoria restaurants--but it would be nice to have a sit-down place that actually specialized! A person can only eat lemon potatoes and Greek salad for so many meals.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d also love a good ice cream place.

				I agree with much of what has been suggested here- excellent indian, a falafel place, crab house (yum! even better if they served oysters), but most of all I would love a Vietnamese noodle shop that serves bubble tea. I dream of this.&nbsp; Whenever I visit my sister in New Haven I go to this one noodle house that makes the most amazing veggie dumpling soup and avocado bubble tea...I want to swim in it.&nbsp; <br />(she is visiting this weekend and bringing me some soup and I CAN&#039;T WAIT). :-)

				I for one would like a really good ramen place. I&#039;m not just talking about noodles like what the places around here have, but ramen, with the delicious pork and mushrooms and egg and whatever other stuff they want to put in it, like Minca or Ippudo (except cheaper). I&#039;ve kept hoping one of our numerous Japanese/sushi restaurants would specialize in ramen, but none of them do.

				Hah! Too true...<br /><br />I just think it&#039;s weird because I&#039;ve only ever seen one bubble tea place and it was in a Chinese grocery store I used to go to for cheap, canned goods in Boston. The entire place, bubble tea stand included, was a gross, gross mess and I never got anything there that wasn&#039;t prepackaged.<br /><br />I tried it once, at the urging of a friend, but didn&#039;t like it. That stand was always empty.<br /><br />Maybe I just had a crappy first experience, but it&#039;s just funny to me that so many people know about that weird stuff and love it.
