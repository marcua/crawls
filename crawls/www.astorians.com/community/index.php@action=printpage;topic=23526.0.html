				hey fellow hockey fans and players if your as pissed as i am about the NHL lockout and really wanna play roller hockey you should come join us at hoyt park in Astoria queens under the N train station across from Neptune dinner and near the basketball and handball courts. me and my friends have been playing on that flat area for a few years we just started playing again and are looking for other players who would like to join. we play for fun and have a goalie with equipment and are working on a goalie net as we speak. we usually try to get 3 on 3&#039;s going when we have enough people. we play on Sundays and usually get there from around 1pm to 2 pm and play the afternoon. we have some people who play on skates and some on feet but its always a great game. again we play for fun and if your interested come on thru you&#039;ll see us in the benches across from the basketball courts. bring your skates and stick and maybe we can get some good games going. if u need any info email me at sofaisking88@gmail.com or just respond back to this post and i will get back to ya hope to see some of u on Sunday.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; frm: ray

				Broadway and Steinway , I know which park your talking about . As long as I know people are playing I ll get my gear this weekend. I saw some guys a few weeks ago playing at 28th but it looks like they are doing work or tearing down that rink.

				I used to play at 28st street rink , which was a really nice place to play a while back .&nbsp; They had league games with refs&nbsp; and alot of people showed up for pickup games . Then all of a sudden everyone stopped and the volleyballers took over . What a shame !&nbsp; &nbsp;They built a nice place and all for nothing . Now hoodrats are tagging up on the place and ruining it . I saw two girls walking a huge pitbull and the dog dumped right in the middle of the face off circle and they just left it there .&nbsp; I pass by sometimes to see if anyone ever plays but to no avail . WTF happened to everyone &gt;?<br />&nbsp;

				Hello hockey fans been awhile since I posted on here. Just wanted to inform anyone new on here or new to seeing this post that the group of hockey guys and myself have gone back to playing at hoyt park. Right near the entrance to the Astoria Blvd train station across from neptune dinner. We have anywhere from 10 to 12 skaters on a Sunday and have 2 goalies if needed. The surface at hoyt park is alot better now and the surface feels like your skating on ice.<br />If anyone is interested in some roller hockey pick up games come thru we will be ther every Sunday from 12 til late afternoon. We play a fun, fast, friendly and enjoyable roller hockey games. Hope to see ya there. <br />&nbsp;
