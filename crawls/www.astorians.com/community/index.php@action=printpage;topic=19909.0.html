				And if you carpool/HOV in the morning, you can access the HOV entrance from 21st st as well. 21st st is my preferred route to the QB bridge vs Crescent st. I think the lights are pretty well timed and you can scootch over there pretty decently even during morning rush hour. I&#039;m coming all the way over from upper Ditmars.

				1010WINS calls it the RFK/Triboro Bridge in the traffic reports now, so it&#039;s obviously not doing anyone favors. The Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel is also going to be renamed after former Gov.

				I agree that this is misguided and wasteful.&nbsp; I&#039;m okay with naming government office buildings and courthouses after people such as Koch or RFK.&nbsp; Even libraries and other municipalities.&nbsp; But bridges, tunnels and highways are best named after where they are located or where they take you.&nbsp; 59th Street Bridge and/or Queensborough Bridge are not sexy or nostalgic names, but they are very descriptive and helpful to anyone using the bridge.&nbsp; As are the former names Triborough Bridge and the former Interboro Parkway.

				I&#039;m glad this topic was brought up. Infuriating!! Interborough, Queensborough........all perfectly charming names. If we need another name for the Q&#039;boro, it&#039;s got one- the 59th St. Bridge! Sheeeeesh.<br /><br />People are great and all, but in 50 yrs time, nobody&#039;s going to remember the mayor behind the bridge ANYway. Who was the Kozciusko (sp??) Bridge named for? Or the Pulaski? Yeah, after people with those names who did something important. <br /><br />If they want to name the bridges after people, they need to do it at the same time they&#039;re <em>built.</em>
