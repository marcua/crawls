				<br />&quot;President Bush warned the incoming Democratic Congress Wednesday that he remains opposed to tax increases, and argued that the budget can be balanced by 2012.&quot;<br /><br />***<br />This is coming from a President who did not veto a single spending increase. Amazing.<br /><br />We saw what the boom of the 90s and a Democratic president and a GOP congress could do.<br />This might be interesting.<br />But I dont remember the 80s budget going so well.<br />Or the 70s.<br /><br />Maybe this Congress will find a few loopholes, waste, and giveaways to end.

				The new Democratic leadership seems to be more fiscally conservative than I would have expected.&nbsp; The Republican Congress opted not to pass the HHS Appropriations bill after they lost Congress and the new Democratic Congress won&#39;t pass the bill with the earmarks (many for local groups - youch!).&nbsp; It&#39;s probably better for the budget, but painful for not-for-profits that need government assistance to maintain and expand programs.

				<br />“I interpret this to mean that if the new Congress wants to repeal the Patriot Act or defund the war in Iraq, these bills will be vetoed. If Congress decides to impose some new civil liberties violation on the American public, in the name of security (of course), it will be considered &quot;fruitful.&quot;<br /><br />It might be nice to see some economic gridlock in order to at least curtail spending, but I&#39;ll not hold my breath. To be honest, I don&#39;t expect much of the Democratic Congress. They certainly won&#39;t cut taxes and many of them voted for the Iraq War and the Patriot Act. By 2008, I expect the death count in Iraq to be higher, the national debt to be higher and for Americans to have lost a few more of our cherished liberties.<br /><br />Bush obviously wants more of the same policies that took Republicans out of office. If the Democrats follow his lead, they can be voted out in 2008.”<br /><br />***<br />http://www.lp.org/yourturn/archives/000514.shtml<br /><br /><br />January 03, 2007<br />Bush: Same Stuff, Different Congress<br />In the op-ed section of today&#39;s Wall Street Journal, President Bush outlined his goals for the new Democratic Congress. While the entire piece just begs to be ripped apart,for the purpose of brevity, I&#39;ll simply highlight some of the more obvious blunders.<br /><br />I believe that when America is willing to use her influence abroad, the American people are safer and the world is more secure.<br /><br />Are waterboards now considered to be influence abroad? I assume he is referring to secret prisons, torture, Gitmo and of course, the Iraq War. With influence like this, it&#39;s no wonder we have enemies.<br /><br />When our nation was attacked, Republicans and Democrats came together to pass the Patriot Act and reform our intelligence agencies. <br /><br />Republicans and Democrats have a habit of working together to undermine the Constitution with egregious acts designed specifically to deprive law abiding citizens of not just their privacy but their basic legal rights. Is Bush asking for more of the same?<br /><br />When we saw that our public schools were failing our children, we came together to pass the No Child Left Behind Act, insisting on high standards, accountability and better options for parents.<br /><br />So now that the federal goverment has taken a greater level of control over local education, we leave more children behind than ever before.<br /><br />Our priorities begin with defeating the terrorists who killed thousands of innocent Americans on September 11, 2001...<br /><br />Where&#39;s Osama bin Laden, again?<br /><br />The bottom line is tax relief and spending restraint are good for the American worker, good for the American taxpayer, and good for the federal budget. <br />Has Bush taken a look at the deficit clock lately? We simply can&#39;t afford any more Republican spending restraint.<br /><br />One important message I took away from the election is that people want to end the secretive process by which Washington insiders are able to slip into legislation billions of dollars of pork-barrel projects that have never been reviewed or voted on by Congress. <br /><br />The last time I checked the Constitution, Congress votes for spending bills and the President either signs or vetoes them. He sure didn&#39;t break out his veto pen to stop Republican pork since he&#39;s been in office.<br /><br />It&#39;s time Congress give the president a line-item veto. And today I will announce my own proposal to end this dead-of-the-night process and substantially cut the earmarks passed each year.<br /><br />While I&#39;m not opposed to the line-item veto, I don&#39;t remember Bush writing articles in the Wall Street Journal asking for the line-item veto of Republican bills when the GOP when in charge. This one really smacks of ultimate hypocricy.<br /><br />Bush closed it all with a thinly veiled threat:<br />If the Congress chooses to pass bills that are simply political statements, they will have chosen stalemate. If a different approach is taken, the next two years can be fruitful ones for our nation.<br /><br />I interpret this to mean that if the new Congress wants to repeal the Patriot Act or defund the war in Iraq, these bills will be vetoed. If Congress decides to impose some new civil liberties violation on the American public, in the name of security (of course), it will be considered &quot;fruitful.&quot;<br /><br />It might be nice to see some economic gridlock in order to at least curtail spending, but I&#39;ll not hold my breath. To be honest, I don&#39;t expect much of the Democratic Congress. They certainly won&#39;t cut taxes and many of them voted for the Iraq War and the Patriot Act. By 2008, I expect the death count in Iraq to be higher, the national debt to be higher and for Americans to have lost a few more of our cherished liberties.<br /><br />Bush obviously wants more of the same policies that took Republicans out of office. If the Democrats follow his lead, they can be voted out in 2008.<br />Posted by Stephen Gordon<br />
