				Went to Spicy Mina&#39;s recently and discovered that I love Indian food.&nbsp; Will gladly take the short trip to get there again but hoped there was something terrific here.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been looking over past posts about this topic and nothing was really decided.<br /><br />

				Yea...I&#39;ve been looking for something that is walking distance too....although on a nice day...Spicy Mina&#39;s is probably considered walking distance&nbsp; :-).&nbsp; I&#39;ve never been there, I&#39;ve only driven pass it....how was the food?&nbsp; I am always wary of going to new indian restaurants unless taken by someone who has already been there....I have to laugh at that statement because I basically grew up on eating indian food from restaurants on 6th street in the east village.&nbsp; <br /><br />I haven&#39;t really found anything close by...my last adventure in trying Indian food in the hood didn&#39;t go too well (I&#39;ve posted about this in another thread)....so I am gun shy in trying something close by unless some recommends it.&nbsp; If you want to continue your love affair with Indian food, however, I suggest going to Jackson Diner (http://queens.about.com/cs/restaurantreviews/gr/rr_jackson_d.htm)....in Jackson Heights.

				Spicy Mina is probably about a 20 minute walk for you guys, Jonathan!<br /><br />In Astoria, I&#39;ve never thought Ghandi was as bad as other people have said... But it&#39;s by no means great...<br /><br />If you want to try something totally different, go get dosas at a South Indian place! There&#39;s some good little holes in the wall in Jackson Heights, or I rather like Saravanaas in Curry Hill too! <br /><br />Or go to Delhi! My sister and her fiance just arrived there for a couple months of backpacking around before they move on to elsewhere in Asia. Here&#39;s part of what she said:<br /><br />&quot;the four of us left the center area and went to get dinner at a tiny place somewhere under a graffiti covered bridge, where i had by far the best indian food i&#39;ve ever eaten (for a quarter of what i&#39;d pay for indian back home). we talked over a din of barking stray dogs and endlessly honking horns.&quot;<br /><br />(OK, that last isn&#39;t very practical...)<br /><br />

				T3, Spicy Mina&#39;s has an excellent reputation around town and on Chow hound (didn&#39;t check Zagat) people who took me there really know their stuff.&nbsp; My problem has always been curry type dishes make me sick which is why I avoided Indian food in general (my mistake). <br /><br />The night we went our table ordered around 10 dishes and none had curry, yes there are curry dishes on the menu. The dishes were out of this world and the spice was nice and hot. They will adjust spice to your request.

				Forget Jackson Diner, that place is bland (and i&#39;m Indian and have been eating the food since I was born in India to now).&nbsp; I suggest going to Dehli Palace!

				Where&#39;s Delhi Palace?<br /><br />I love Saravanaas from having eaten at their locations in India, but it doesn&#39;t taste the same at all in New York - the veggies taste completely different, the curd and lassi aren&#39;t as fresh....

				Delhi Palace is on 74th Street off of Roosevelt Avenue, it&#39;s three to four doors down from Jackson Diner.&nbsp; I also suggest getting their lunch buffet (my boyfriend loves it).&nbsp; It&#39;s 7.95 a person.&nbsp; If you want ultra spicy food then go down to Indian Taj (next to patel brothers on 74th).&nbsp; They are known for their buffets and spiciness.

				I&#39;m a little wary of buffets in general - the freshness and taste of the food.&nbsp; But the Delhi Palace buffet is all right?

				I&#39;ve had awful experiences at Ghandi.&nbsp; One time, I was dining in and there was a roach on the table.&nbsp; I called the waiter over to tell him and he just shrugged and hit it with a napkin until it crawled under tha table and then he walked away.&nbsp; It was his lack of concern that scared me.&nbsp; I would have liked him to pretend to be a little more horrified.&nbsp; That was the last time I went there.

She was just featured on cool in your code (might have been a repeat, but the first time we had seen it). Chowhound has been having an ongoing discussion about Mina&#39;s for sometime now and for that reason we have yet to try it, however once the warmer weather approaches we shall walk up and back as I do want to try it. <br /><br />On the Great Indian I would like to second and third the votes for Delhi Palace as well as second the vote for Indian Taj. Although Taj is buffet, I have never had any problems, the service and atmoshere are fine and it is all your can eat!!! <br /><br />Jackson Diner on the other hand is for me a miss, have been there three times and was not impressed at all. I think they get more business due to thier name, rather than due to the heartiness of thier dishes. <br /><br />I also heard that Dosa Diner was decent, however have not been yet, however is on the &quot;get there&quot; list. <br /><br />I&#39;m out...

				What about the &quot;cabbie diner&quot; on 21st St. under the Queensboro Bridge? You can see it across the street when you come off the bridge at the light. I think it&#39;s called Five Star.....has a new catering hall right next to it (which cracks me up- probably the same kitchen!)<br /><br />It&#39;s a Pakistani greasy spoon with a large-screen TV showing Bollywood films and the cheapest furnishings possible. Nothing healthy about it, but plenty for vegetarians and it&#39;s cheap and tasty. My cousins go there weekly, and even that one time we spotted a mouse doesn&#39;t phase them. I&#39;d go more often if I weren&#39;t concerned about the calories.

I go there at least twice a week. If I go there for lunch, they serve enough food to where I have enough for dinner later, and all for under $9. I have introduced it to plenty of my regulars and they love it.
