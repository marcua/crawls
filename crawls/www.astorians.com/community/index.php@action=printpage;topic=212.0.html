				http://www.msmagazine.com/june01/marriage.html<br /><br />This is the article I mentioned at AWG last night. &nbsp;In light of the recent British study [which shows that while men's chances of marrying increases in proportion to their IQs, women's chances decrease], it's food for thought.

				I found the article on platonic &quot;marriage&quot; interesting. Thanks for the link.<br /><br />Here are some possibilities I thought of in relation to the British Study:<br /><br />1. That intelligent women don't marry because they understand that men are somehow stereotypically(statistically) &nbsp;inferior to them. <br />2. Intelligent women are less capable of long-term comittment. And intelligent men are more capable of it.<br />3. That women who do marry are less intelligent than their male counterparts who do. Is this directly proportional? If so this would also seem to suggest that any women who does marry is not as intelligent as women who don't. Whereas, any man that does marry is more intelligent than his male counterpart that doesn't, not to mention more intelligent than his less-intelligent female spouse.<br />4. That statistitians have way too much time on their hands.<br /><br />Statistics like this bother me. Because it seems to suggest that despite all of our collective interest for &quot;equality,&quot; that underneath still lies this perveted joy of stereotyping people based on their genatalia and adding fuel to the fire of sexism. <br /><br />When will we stop seeing people for their genatalia, and start seeing individuals? Maybe it's too much to ask of society; even &quot;enlightened&quot; society.<br /><br />I would love to hear any other comments on this.

				I'm not sure that intelligence has much to do with the capability of and interest in commitment. &nbsp;It's probably true that intelligent men have more going for them. &nbsp;Intelligent women may have competing priorities. &nbsp;<br /><br />Some would say this suggests that gentlemen still prefer blondes (&quot;that intellectual men, when they prefer women, do not prefer intellectual women&quot;), and intelligence makes women less desireable, but I'm trying not to believe this - and I've never met a man who would admit to it. &nbsp;OK, only one. &nbsp;And the guys I've dated seemed to like my brains. &nbsp;<br /><br />I think you're dead on with number 4.
