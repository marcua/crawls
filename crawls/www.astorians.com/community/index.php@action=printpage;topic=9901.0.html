				Anyone else been to Kitaku - the new sushi place on 23rd?<br /><br />We went on Friday night and weren&#039;t too impressed. &nbsp;When we saw the fish menu, we had great hopes for a good quality sushi place near us, but we were pretty dissapointed. &nbsp;Quality of the fish (the Uni and Ikura was so, so and possibly a bit old which is NOT a good sign) and sizes of the portions were meager considering the prices (thin, not very big slices - hard to actually taste the fish). &nbsp;The only thing we had that got high marks was the Age Dashi Dofu and the Vegetable tempura apps. &nbsp;We also tried the Tom Yung Gung , but I didn&#039;t think it was worth getting again - the broth was not very spicy and they put fake crab into it, which fell apart and threw off the taste and texture.<br /><br />We&#039;re not going to totally write them off just yet. &nbsp;We&#039;re hoping they&#039;ll realize what&#039;s going wrong and work out the kinks. &nbsp;We&#039;ll go again in a couple of weeks and see how things are going. &nbsp;Until then, I guess we&#039;ll continute going to Watawa as our local joint.<br /><br />Zeke

				I picked up a menu for this place the other day, as I live right around the corner.&nbsp; I was surprised at how high the prices were- sushi is almost 50% higher than Watawa and Sakura on Ditmars.&nbsp; If the quality was great, and the ambience of the restaurant was nice, I&#039;d be willing to pay the extra $$, I&#039;m disappointed to hear that it&#039;s not.&nbsp; I will keep my eye on this thread to see if it improves.&nbsp; Thanks for posting, Zeke.

				Walked past a few days ago and they have a sign up that says either &quot;10% off&quot; or &quot;15% off&quot; (I can&#039;t recall which). Perhaps they realized that they can&#039;t charge that much for (reportedly) mediocre food in this neighborhood?

				Kitaku now makes all the dishes Dragon Gate had on its menu.&nbsp; they actually printed up a chinese food menu and it has all the stuff Dragon Gate had (except i don&#039;t see Hawaiian Steak Kew).&nbsp; the old cooks from Dragon Gate are at Kitaku because it was opened by the DG owners.&nbsp; i haven&#039;t had chinese since DG closed because all the other places weren&#039;t nearly as good.&nbsp; i&#039;ve ordered chinese twice from Kitaku since finding out, and it seems on par with the quality of DG and was tasty.&nbsp; the phone # is different than the old DG #, if you call the old # you get a different restaurant on 37st/20ave in the shopping center..

				Personally, I have been going to Kitaku nearly once a week throughout the fall.&nbsp; I can&#039;t speak to the sashimi, since I haven&#039;t tried it, but I have thoroughly enjoyed everything that I have eaten there:&nbsp; every appetizer and every house specialty roll on the menu, plus a few of the standard rolls.&nbsp; There is a mango lobster specialty roll that is particulary delightful.<br /><br />By comparison, I recently tried JJs Asian Fusion, and actually preferred the sushi at Kitaku.&nbsp; (Not sure about comparisons to Watawa; I haven&#039;t been there since it opened a few years ago)<br /><br />The wait staff and sushi chefs have also been extraordinarily kind at every sitting.<br /><br />And honestly, I don&#039;t really get the gripes from early on in this thread about their prices.&nbsp; I have always felt the pricing was actually very reasonable.<br /><br />Last point:&nbsp; their chocolate cake is outrageously good.

				Thanks for the insights.&nbsp; We walked by last night, but it was totally empty with the exception of 1 family and that just didn&#039;t give us the right vibe so we kept on walking.&nbsp; We ended up going to Tokyo on 24th Ave, just off of 31st St and were very pleasantly suprised at how good it was.&nbsp; We went around 7:30 and the place was about 1/3 full. Keep in mind it&#039;s on the small side to begin with.&nbsp; But, by the time we left, the only seats available were at the sushi bar.&nbsp; Have to say it wasn&#039;t the most amazing atmosphere, but food was very fresh, sushi bar was clean, the service was friendly and the food very good.&nbsp; We did mostly cooked items this time, not too much sushi, but we&#039;ll definitely go back to try more.&nbsp; We had 2 specialty dumpling soups, fried goyza, soft shell crab roll, crab/cucumber/avocado/eel roll, beef bulgolgi with kimchi, and ma-po-tofu with pork, about 4 japanese iced teas and bill was just $56.&nbsp; Totally well worth it.&nbsp; Consider trying it if you&#039;re looking for a change.&nbsp; It&#039;s only a short walk from Kitaku.&nbsp; Here&#039;s their website - http://www.tokyosushibar.net/ (http://www.tokyosushibar.net/)<br /><br />Have you tried the hibachi at Kitaku?

				Decided to try it last night. It&#039;s right next door to Club 23, yet worlds apart of course! Although I think the music seeps through, which is too bad.<br /><br />Decor is fantastic, whoever&#039;s renovating the restaurants on 23rd Ave (Bangkok Tasty for example) is doing a fabulous job&nbsp; :mrgreen: Kitau used to be the Greek supermarket that I liked, but you&#039;d never know it. Creative interior. Lights above the tables could be shielded a bit more- no big deal.<br /><br />Food, however, was just decent. I loved it; presentation as wonderful as the interior design, but my sushi-savvy dining companion wasn&#039;t as impressed. He tried the $13 bottle of sake and again, my less-experienced palate thought it was fine, while he deemed it &quot;cheap.&quot; We had the black angel and spicy girl rolls (excellent); split one of the sushi entrees with the three types of sushi (came with soup and salad, pretty standard); were offered a sample appetizer consisting of cream cheese with.....oh I forget, it was tasty though. <br /><br />Still, the prices are normal, service was great (they allowed us to linger which was nice) and they appear kid-friendly for those of you who like that sort of thing (biting my tongue) :wink: <br /><br />Verdict: Wonderful treat on payday after a very rough week if you&#039;re not much of a sushi snob. Also, this would be a fine place to impress a date (who&#039;s not a sushi snob!) or just relax with a group.<br />

				My wife and I went to this place for lunch today for the first time and were pleasantly surprised given some of the negative reviews in this thread. We had the 3-roll lunch special, tried the &quot;age tofu&quot; and &quot;tempura&quot; appetizers.<br /><br />The prices are definitely not more expensive than I&#039;m used to paying in Manhattan for a similar lunch ($8 as of today for 3 rolls, salad, and miso soup). We found the staff were attentive, and the food was fine. For an $8 lunch though I&#039;m not expecting to have the red carpet rolled out. The food quality was certainly on par with anything I&#039;ve had in Midtown or Murry Hill for a Sushi lunch (actually better than a couple places I&#039;ve been to in Midtown). The place was clean, and the decor is nice.<br /><br />After today&#039;s lunch I don&#039;t have any complaints about Kitaku.

				Agreed.&nbsp; We also tried it for lunch over the weekend.&nbsp; And we both enjoyed everything we had.&nbsp; The miso soup was very tasty and hot.&nbsp; The salad was ice cold and fresh.&nbsp; I had a dinner roll as an appetizer.&nbsp; The name was something like Spicy Mountain.&nbsp; It was delicious.&nbsp; Stuffed with crabmeat and avocado.&nbsp; Then actually battered and fried like tempura.&nbsp; Then smothered with crawfish and spicy Japanese mayonnaise.&nbsp; It had to be the most unhealthy and delicious thing on the menu.&nbsp; I highly recommend it.&nbsp; Then I had the beef negimaki.&nbsp; Very good.&nbsp; Tender beef.&nbsp; More scallion than I could eat.&nbsp; But I enjoyed the flavors.&nbsp; And a nice portion.&nbsp; My wife got a mixed bento box.&nbsp; There was over a square foot of plate with little mounds of items here and there.&nbsp; So not my thing.&nbsp; But she loved it and said each item was delicious.&nbsp; The main part of the combo was a salmon terriyaki and she said it was cooked perfectly and very tasty.&nbsp; We will go back for sure.&nbsp; And we might even try their Chinese menu since the Chinese choices in town tend to go from bad to worse.&nbsp; Maybe this place is good.&nbsp; But their Japanese is very good.&nbsp; And I also think the prices are moderate and fair.&nbsp; And for a change, they had a nice crowd.&nbsp; And the service couldn&#039;t be friendlier.

				I always wonder why the place is always so empty. I eat there quite often and I think the prices are average except for Lunch which I think is really inexpensive ($8.50 for 3 rolls w/ salad and soup) or the chinese food menu which is pretty inexpensive as well. <br /><br />service has always been good and never had a complaint about their food

				I&#039;ve never actually ordered from Kitaku because of the price.&nbsp; Someone mentioned the pricing is similar to Manhattan pricing... but since it&#039;s not in Manhattan, I don&#039;t want to pay that, you know what I mean?&nbsp; I tend to judge price by the Sushi Deluxe, since it&#039;s the easiest thing for me to order and usually the best value.&nbsp; Theirs is $16 for 9 pieces and a spicy tuna roll.&nbsp; That&#039;s about $3 more and 1 piece less than most of the sushi places in the neighborhood.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, in looking at the menu, I just noticed they have all you can eat for $23 on Wednesday.&nbsp; Anyone tried that?&nbsp; I&#039;d definitely be into trying that out sometime.
