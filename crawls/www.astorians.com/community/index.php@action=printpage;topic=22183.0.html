				Well Joey C,<br />I&#039;m sorry your not interested in this Thread....... its simple though, DON&#039;T READ IT!!!! <br /><br />I know helicopters have propellErs, AND?? I&#039;m not sure whats your point?? <br /><br />Its one thing to have them flying around.... its ANOTHER when they are flying low in your neighborhood with a spotlight.<br />The past few threads regarding &quot;Helicopters in Astoria&quot; have had very good responses to them....... They&#039;ve all been connected with robberies or whatever other BAD incidents that have happened in our neighborhood.<br /><br />Astorians.com helps us connect with one another and keeps us informed and alert. If by chance there is something your don&#039;t like on the site?? you don&#039;t have to read it. Its pretty easy.<br /><br />I TOO am not trying to be mean...... I&#039;m just explaining my point.<br />

				Saw a blue van zoom down 31st Avenue near Crescent with a cop car in hot pursuit.&nbsp; It made a left on Crescent through a red (cop got alongside it as it slowed down) but it kept going, while another cop car joined the chase.&nbsp; Police chopper arrived above the area for about 10 minutes around 6:30.

				Yeah, I saw the helicopter hovering super low outside my apartment on 34th Ave and Crescent last night.&nbsp; It was creepy.&nbsp; One of our security guards said a women was assaulted on 31st st. and 34th Ave.&nbsp; Don&#039;t know how true that is though, just what I heard.
