				<span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 1.35em;" class="bbc_size">This is for a July 1 move-in date into a beautiful bedroom in a 2-bedroom must not miss apartment! My roommate is moving out, and I want to keep the place because it&#039;s just about the best apartment ever. The room in question is huge and has its own bathroom with shower and private balcony.</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 1.35em;" class="bbc_size">The apartment has an additional wrap-around balcony that is accessed through french doors in the living room. I just got a great Brookstone table for the balcony and have been eating some meals out there--it&#039;s really nice. A grill is soon to come, too. If you&#039;re interested, please email me with a description of yourself and your phone number so we can speak and set up a time for you to visit the apartment.</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 1.35em;" class="bbc_size">I&#039;m 27, female, and I work as a high school English teacher. I love to travel and I&#039;m a fun and outgoing person.</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 1.35em;" class="bbc_size">The apartment is on the same block as Dillinger&#039;s (30th Avenue and 47th Street).</span></span>

				Hi, <br /><br />My name is Tyler. I&#039;m a 23 yr old gay male working full time as a salon manager in the city. My lease is up on July 1st and I&#039;m looking to lower my rent by getting roommates so this place sounds great. Is the room still available? I&#039;m very fun loving, respectful, clean, quiet when I need to be, and looking for cool new people to live with and hopefully build friendship with as well. <br /><br />Please give me a call at 901-833-7903 if interested. I&#039;d like to ask more questions. <br /><br />Thanks, <br />Tyler <br />

				Hi, I&#039;m Jennifer. <br />I&#039;m a 23 year old female attending grad school at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in the fall. I&#039;m looking for a place to stay at least until January. I&#039;ll also be working close to full time. I&#039;m very responsible and pay for everything I own, on my own. How much is rent at this apartment?<br />Thanks.
