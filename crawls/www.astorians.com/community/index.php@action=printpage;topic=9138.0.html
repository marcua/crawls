				Waltz has their thing, and it&#039;s cool.<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking of a place to see some live rock.&nbsp; There&#039;s not one venue in this area.&nbsp; Come to think of it, you never see good shows out in Queens.&nbsp; Brooklyn and Manhattan, sure, but never Queens.&nbsp; Why not Astoria?<br /><br />I would be completely down with putting on a show of jambands in this nabe.

				i&#039;ve seen bands play at cronin and phelan, in the rock genre.&nbsp; i just checked their website and it looks like it hasn&#039;t been updated in a while, but maybe you could call or pop in and ask.<br /><br />i&#039;ve seen cover bands at the rover a handful of times, who play stuff drunk girls love to sing and dance too, (yea, sometimes this is me... so what?).<br /><br />umm...there must be others!&nbsp; drawing a blank.. maybe that&#039;s it?&nbsp; hell gate social has specific genre themed djs on particular nights that i&#039;ve yet to check out... it&#039;s on my list of things to do!<br /><br /><br />

				There&#039;s the Astorya Cafe - I think it&#039;s on 31st Ave.&nbsp; They don&#039;t do music now, they seem to be mostly for poetry readings, etc. but their space is pretty open and could probably hold a small band . . .maybe they&#039;d like to have a live music night to bring in some more people

				It&#039;d be great to have some live music venues out here.&nbsp; I end up going into the city to Bowery Ballroom, Mercury Lounge, Irving Plaza or other places.&nbsp; Why do folks think it is that Brooklyn (Williamsburg especially) has so many live music venues and we have few, if any?

				Sunswick 35/35 has live bands on a semi-regular basis, usually on Saturdays. Bobby Kane, T.J. Moss, The Deep End band (though I haven&#039;t seen them in a while), and other rock bands. <br /><br />I think Rendezvous on Broadway advertises Thursday as &quot;Acoustic Night,&quot; though I haven&#039;t kept an eye on that place for a while. <br /><br />McLoughlin&#039;s on Broadway near 31st has live local bands on occasion.<br /><br />LIC Bar has live country music every Sunday afternoon.<br /><br /><br />

				http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=9383.0 (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=9383.0)<br /><br />and more to come. <br /><br />there are a good bit of local bands in the area in the punk/pop punk vein. most notably, The Steinways (http://www.myspace.com/thesteinways). Technically, since I live here, The Challenged (http://www.myspace.com/thechallenged2) can be considered local.<br /><br />There&#039;s even a record label run here, Whoa Oh Records (http://www.whoaohrecords.com/). They have a good podcast, though its not released on a regular basis.<br /><br />

				Cassidys used to have that doors cover band ..... i wanna say &#039;the soft parade&#039; but don&#039;t quote me. Is Cassidy&#039;s even still there? Castle Heights isn&#039;t :( I think even Redzone got shut down too but these places are all for 13 year olds anyway. <br /><br /><br /><br />Just about every single spanish bar on northern blvd in JH has live bands. A lot of them are rock bands too, they just don&#039;t sing in english :)

				I&#039;m not sure about the supper club part, but otherwise sounds interesting. <br /><br />I&#039;m kind of perplexed why it&#039;s so damn far from anything though. Well besides the power plant that is. I assume it&#039;s a lot cheaper, but at some point you must hit a &quot;too far for people to walk&quot; point -- esp. those not from the immediate area. It looks like a 10-15 minute desolate and dark walk from the 36 Ave N/W. Maybe a tiny bit shorter from the F.<br /><br />It&#039;s gonna be tough to compete with Bowery/Mercury/Webster/Brooklyn spots being that far from train stops with not much else around to anchor/draw people (i.e. the &#039;burg) is my guess. It looks more like where you&#039;d hold an illegal rave (or at least would back in the day!). I hope it does well though and proves me wrong!
