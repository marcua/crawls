				hi there!&nbsp; It&#039;s great to see local businesses taken the opportunity to go direct to the people through Astorians.&nbsp; Good luck with Samba Grill!<br /><br />I happened to pick up one of your menus in Key Food and thought it was interesting.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got a couple of questions for you.<br /><br />How would you do delivery when you don&#039;t have specific foods that can be ordered?&nbsp; There was a list of &quot;typical&quot; foods, but it didn&#039;t seem anyone could be sure of what they&#039;d be ordering.<br /><br />The per pound pricing seemed a bit like a deli to me and not what you&#039;d expect from a sit down restaurant.&nbsp; Do you have scales at the end of the buffet?<br /><br />I hope to make it in to check out your restaurant at some point.&nbsp; Good luck!<br /><br />

				Hello! Yes, I am glad to see that this site really brings the people of Astoria together. It not only helps to promote business but it also allows us to see if we are doing the right thing through people&#039;s input, questions, etc. <br />So to answer your questions...when you step into our restaurant our waiters will ask if you would like to serve yourself or to have sit down service.&nbsp; If you choose to serve yourself, you fill your plate and then weigh it on the scale by the register.&nbsp; You can pay on the spot or pay at the end of your meal by giving your name at the counter and they will leave a check open so you can add items instead of paying each time.&nbsp; &nbsp;For those not familiar with Brazilian food paying by pound is actually a good way to familiarize yourself.&nbsp; You can get a little bit of each food and then on your next run at the table you can fill up on what you really like.&nbsp; It&#039;s also good for people who want to take out.&nbsp; Or go for the other option, Rodizio service, you take your buffet items like other buffet restaurants and the meats just keep coming from the waiters.&nbsp; You can ask for more or less of any type of meat you like.&nbsp; The bill comes to your table so no need to stop at the register.&nbsp; If someone at your table chose by pound they are the only ones who have to stop at the register to get their plate weighed in and it will be noted your on check.&nbsp; It sounds complicated but it actually works out pretty smoothly! There are many restaurants in Brazil that work this way and they are very popular. <br />We are working on our delivery menu and will distribute them once they are ready.&nbsp; Items on that menu will consist of foods we have everyday such as rice, beans, french fries, yucca and plantains.&nbsp; Together with your choice of meat(s).&nbsp; We will also have a special of the day that you can order.&nbsp; &nbsp;I hope I answered your questions....thank you for your inquiry and hope to see you soon!&nbsp;

				Thank you, Samba! Are you the owner, by the way?&nbsp; I would assume so.<br /><br />One suggestion that I would make (though you would have to determine if it&#039;s worth it) would be to have a buffet pricing (all you can eat) without the rodizio.&nbsp; I don&#039;t generally eat beef or pork, so the only rodizio I would eat would be the chicken, but the buffet options sound delicious and I don&#039;t know that if I was out with others who were getting the rodizio and could go to the buffet as much as they wanted.&nbsp; I would rather not have to pay the full amount for, what I&#039;m assuming is more expensive, meat in order to be able to go to an unlimited buffet.<br /><br />Just a thought!&nbsp; Thanks for listening.

				We went to this restaurant this week and it was fab!&nbsp; The service is great - everyone is really friendly.&nbsp; But the best part is the food!&nbsp; I grew up in Brasil so I know what it should taste like...and it tasted great!&nbsp; Not to mention how affordable it is.&nbsp; My husband and I spent $17 on food and a drink (and he&#039;s a big boy).&nbsp; Most of the other customers in the store were Brasilian too which says something.&nbsp; Plus you get to watch Rede Globo (a Brasilian TV station!)&nbsp; I&#039;ll definitely be back.&nbsp; :roll:

				We have now added an appetizer menu....great for those who just want to come in and have a drink and just pick (portions are large enough to share).&nbsp; Also, if you do not see anything on our buffet table that interests you on any particular day, you may also order from our take out menu and dine in.&nbsp; <br />(Appetizers and items on our take out menu are made fresh to order).....many thanks!&nbsp;

				I just wanted to say, I finally got my butt in to Samba and the food was great!&nbsp; The per pound pricing made it easy for me to load up a plate for my daughter and me and share.&nbsp; Everyone was very nice.&nbsp; I&#039;ll definitely be back.<br /><br />The only comment I would make is that it would be nice for the food on the buffet to have labels.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t know what a lot of things were and since I don&#039;t eat mammals it made it tricky to just pick things off the buffet.&nbsp; Luckily, I asked what the chicken pie was, &#039;cause it was DELICIOUS!!
