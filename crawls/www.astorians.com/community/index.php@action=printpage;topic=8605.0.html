				i had another great experience at Plaza Lounge this weekend, i thought i would share.<br /><br />our wraps and sandwiches were great, but i REALLY enjoyed the crab and shrimp fondue, and i would highly recommend it.<br /><br />my father loved the coffee and he is a very picky coffee guy.<br /><br />it&#039;s also a great value.<br /><br />i don&#039;t think they do brunch, because it was saturday afternoon and they just had the regular menu.<br /><br />

				yea, i don&#039;t think it is fondue like fondue is supposed to be, with the dipping stuff in other stuff.&nbsp; it&#039;s like a big caserole of melted cheese with little shrimps and crab in it, served with garlicky pieces of bread.&nbsp; i don&#039;t know if it was real crab, but everything they serve is really fresh and delicious so i would say... probably.<br /><br />i asked what cheeses were in it because i was so taken with the dish and they were mozzarella, gouda and.... damn, i forgot the third one, but there were three.&nbsp; it&#039;s also available without the seafood, if you&#039;re not into that kind of thing.<br /><br />plaza lounge is located at 2902 30th Ave, right across the street from the park.
