				1) I am looking to find a roommate for a private bedroom and to share the rest of a first floor apartment (kitchen, living room, den, etc.). This is for a one-year lease starting December 1st. <br />2) I prefer a male roommate (although females are welcome to inquire). Also, someone who’s not an uber-neat freak (I’m not Oscar Madison, but I’m not Felix Unger either…). I’m not around a lot (I get home past 10pm on weekdays), but really like my privacy when I’m home. <br />3) You will have your own room (it’s long and narrow, but it’s suited me fine for over 5 years, but now I’m moving to the larger room. It has enough room to fit a twin bed (maybe a full..), and a dresser. You’d also have your own closet. BTW, the temperature in this room is much better than my soon-to-be new room. <br />4) The apartment is in Astoria, Queens. I’m a 2 minute walk to the 46th St. station for the R/V. It takes about 30 to 35 minutes to get to either 8th St. on the R, or W. 4th St. on the V.<br />5) The area is right near major shopping on Northern Blvd (Pathmark, Stop N Shop, Best Buy, and Home Depot) and Steinway St (The Gap, Starbucks, Blockbuster Video, etc. There are also a lot of cool bars/lounges on Broadway. The Kaufman Astoria movie theaters and a billiards/game hall are also a 10 minute walk away. How can you beat that? <br />6) The apartment comes with gas and water included. We’d split electricity (costs about $30 to $40 per month). Splitting digital cable and DSL Internet is preferred, but not required. <br />7) The apartment has no land line, so you must have a cell phone.<br />8) The price is a little under 700 per month. You’d need one month’s rent as security. I can check if there is a credit check, but when I signed my lease, I wasn’t asked for one. <br />9) There is no smoking in the apartment, but outside the apartment is fine.<br />10) Landlord&#39;s rule...no pets.<br />11) The living room has a futon and a TV. <br />12) Message me or email me at rapatalo@gmail.com if you are interested, or if you have any questions.
