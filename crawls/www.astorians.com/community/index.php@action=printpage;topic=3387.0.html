				sorry but I grew up in LA so celebrity sightings are a pretty common thing...<br /><br />but here&#39;s my favorite one. I was at the premiere screening of Disney&#39;s Aladin (yes this was a while ago, but my friend&#39;s mom used to publish a local movie magazine and so he always had free tix to everything) and another friend goes, don&#39;t look now but there&#39;s the cast of &quot;General Hospital&quot;. <br />As the night goes on, she&#39;s counted every star from every soap opera (all the ones that filmed in LA that is) and their kids of course...<br />Me, I just politely nodded as if this was important information.

				Too many to count in Manhattan -- it happens on a regular basis.<br /><br />Now, in Astoria -- I could swear that last summer, I saw Alicia Witt (beautiful red-haired actress) waiting for the N Train at Ditmars station one sunny Saturday afternoon -- it had to be her. &nbsp;What she was doing out that way, I had no idea.<br /><br />There was also some odd story in Gawker a few months back about Scarlet Johannson&#39;s brother hanging out at the Albatross? &nbsp;Not a direct celebrity, but just a weird story.<br /><br />I&#39;m willing to bet there will be more celebrity sightings out this way. &nbsp;On a very minor local level, didn&#39;t that one quirky NY1 newscaster say he lived in Astoria? &nbsp;(Can&#39;t remember his name ... he does the &quot;goofy human interest&quot; stories every morning.) &nbsp;He made a point of being an Astorian during the blackout.

				I was at Dewey&#39;s Flatiron bar about 5 or 6 years back and was asked if I was there for the &quot;Queen&#39;s Birthday Party&quot;. Being slightly tipsy and always cheeky, I answered &quot;of course&quot;. Turns out I was at Queen Latifah&#39;s birthday party, I think her 30th. My friend and I were drinking right along with all of her friends and played pool with them in the upstairs bar.

				I grew mine to something like 4 feet, and my mom and one of my aunts both have longer hair.<br /><br />Of course coarse, strong, straight hair runs in the family so it makes sense that we&#39;d run to the longer end of average.<br /><br />12 feet? Good lord. I can only imagine the headaches.

				I&#39;ve only seen a few - David Letterman, Leona Helmsley, Signourney Weaver (I handed her a palm card and asked her to vote for my City Council candidate, she said she was going to and I was pleased.&nbsp; I had no idea who she was until all the other volunteers ran over to tell me - we checked the voter rolls and yep, she did vote there and on that day too - and if she was being honest with me, for Eva Moskowitz!).&nbsp; My favorite sighting was on an N train when I saw the Lady Miss Kier Kirby from Deee-Lite.&nbsp; I was excited and told my friend, look over there - my friend had no idea who she was, but the Lady Miss Kier seemed pleased to be recognized.

				I&#39;ve seen some pretty random celebritys. Anyone remember Karen Duffy? She was an MTV veejay years ago. I saw her on the N-train in Astoria. I have seen Molly Ringwald twice- both times I had a fit- I love her! (Yes, I am a totally John Hughes movie fan). Ethan Hawke, Connie Chung, Topher Grace, Barbara Walters, Drew Barrymore. None were as exciting (well at least to me) as Molly! <br /><br />I interned on the Joan Rivers Show in college and met Tim Conway, Heloise, Fabio, Oleg Casseni, Diane Von Furstenburg- all very random! Fabio was weird.<br /><br />On a separate note- I can&#39;t imagine having the will power to grow your hair to 12 feet let alone three feet anytime my hair gets just past my shoulder I feel the need to chop it all off.

				My fiance says I have tunnel vision when I walk, so I must say I have not reallly seen anyone on the streets of NY (except Parker Posey at the Union Square Dog Park).&nbsp; However, I did meet Andrew Ridgley when I was 12 or 13.&nbsp; That was quite an exciting moment (at that time, anyhow).

				Dang, you guys have seen some uber-famous people. Me, not so much. But when I first moved here I worked retail for a while and saw a few people. Jimmy Fallon and Rachel Dratch (we got a lot of SNLers in our store), Julianna Marguiles (was in with her mom, v. friendly), Parker Posey, Paul Rudd, Thom from Queer Eye (who was there scouting for the show), Tyler Florence from the Food Network (rang him up!), but my all-time fave was Drew Barrymore. I actually helped her with some stuff and helped ring her up. I was in BLISS meeting her. She is awesome and very tiny and was quite friendly.<br /><br />As for &quot;work functions&quot;, I&#39;ve seen Bono, Conan O&#39;Brien, Marilyn Manson and Dita Von Teese, Will Arnett and David Cross (OMG! I actually spoke to David Cross but I was slightly drunk), Nicole Richie, Jeremy Piven (another OMG - I LOVE him), Taylor (Soul Patrol) Hicks, John Mayer, etc.<br /><br />I&#39;ve also seen Oliver Platt randomly on the street and Kofi Annan (not sure if that&#39;s very exciting), Ryan Adams (my friend spotted him), Gayle King (Oprah&#39;s BFF), and Mariska Hargitay (in a movie theater - my friend also spotted her). I usually don&#39;t notice the famous people on the street because I&#39;m in my own little world. But in retail, you&#39;ve got nothing else to do but scope for celebs.<br /><br />As for Astoria, I could have sworn once I saw Tony Sirico from the Sopranos, but I&#39;m not sure. I feel like a lot of people in our nabe could look like a guy from the Sopranos.<br /><br />PS - I freakin LOVE Queen Latifah.<br />

I had my camera, but didn&#39;t snap a shot, because I did NOT want to be &quot;that guy&quot; that ruins his Sunday stroll a little ways from his posh SoHo residence. I heard him mumble something to one of the people in his group, definitely confirming it was indeed The Man Who Sold the World. I kinda stopped in my tracks after he passed me, and two Asian girls couldn&#39;t figure out what was wrong with me. Haha.

				I have seen so many but I can&#39;t remember them all... <br /><br />A couple of slightly interesting stories, though.<br /><br />When we lived in CT we commuted in on Metro North. One afternoon when we were on our way home a guy in our train car starts having a heart attack. Everybody is trying to figure out what is going on, and the conductor calls for an ambulence to meet us at the next stop. Anyway, I turn back around and look ahead of me, and one of the people standing up and gawking is Joe Pantoliano with his trademark hat and glasses. It took me a while to figure out who he was, but then it dawned on me that it was &quot;the guy from the Matrix.&quot; Since then he&#39;s become a little more well-known, but at that time I only knew him as &quot;that guy.&quot; I think I googled him later to find out his real name. :)<br /><br />Also while we commuted on Metro North... When we switched to our local Metro North train I often saw an actor that I grew up watching on either Days of Our Lives or Another World. I finally figured out who he was and that he lived in CT, but it was so weird for me to see him on the train. Seemed like a nice guy.<br /><br />Hmmm... I have seen others, but not as interesting as the first story. Saw Law and Order being filmed with Jerry Orbach and the black guy (can&#39;t remember his name) at the UN. I saw that guy (I know - a lot of that guy, that girl) from Hellboy (the lead) when I worked on 5th Ave. Saw Steve Martin filming the Pink Panther (I think) also on 5th Ave. I saw another actress on 5th Ave. who I remember from Meet Joe Black (she was the sister who wanted the father&#39;s attention). She is actually pretty well known, but I can&#39;t remember her name.<br /><br />Others, too...but I won&#39;t try to remember them now.

				Wow, I have probably seen many, but, I don&#39;t know my actors/actresses so, I wouldn&#39;t be able to tell.&nbsp; I know for a fact that I probably seen some pretty &quot;important people&quot; as I walk by the Mandarin Oriental in Columbus Circle every day.&nbsp; I have heard many of my colleagues see celebs coming in and going out of the place.<br /><br />This was not at all random, but I was chosen to be on the Letterman show for Audience Show and Tell.&nbsp; So I did get a chance to talk with Dave.

				One day this summer I spent an afternoon in Bryant Park sitting right next to a shirtless Chris Noth who was smoking a cigar while learning his Law and Order lines. &nbsp;It wasn&#39;t as thrilling as you&#39;d expect.<br /><br />A few other random highlights off the top of my head:<br /><br />1) chatting with Scott Foley in a coat check line at a party (drunk)<br />2) asking Jon Stewart a question at a Daily Show taping (twice)<br />3) drunkenly accosting Justin Guarini at the sales presentation for Good Vibrations (he was hilarious)<br /><br />Pretty sure he doesn&#39;t live in Astoria anymore, but I used to see Scott Porter on the train all the time when he was doing Altar Boyz. &nbsp;I think he&#39;s on Friday Night Lights this season (is that on NBC? not sure) so he might be a little more famous soon.<br /><br />I would have flipped to see Eric Balfour on 35th Avenue - he&#39;s one of my favorite HITGs.

				I used to live in LA too, so I&#39;ve seen my share of celebrities. But even though she&#39;s not A-list, I like to tell people my Bea Arthur story.<br /><br />When I was doing props for a play at the Tiffany Theater in LA, I had to wash some of the dishes from a food scene, and the only sink was in the ladies room. Bea Arthur and her friend were in there one time, talking to each other from different stalls.<br /><br />Friend: ...and he said that people who get sick the most are people who don&#39;t wash their hands after going to the bathroom. (exits stall, washes hands)<br />Bea: And you had to tell <em>me</em> that?<br /><br />The friend laughed and left the restroom. And then Bea Arthur exits the stall, looks in the mirror, puffs up her hair a little, and <em>leaves without washing her hands</em>.<br /><br />I know. It&#39;s not a juicy story and she&#39;s not Robert Smith or anything. I just want this to be a sort of public service announcement. If you ever meet Bea Arthur, you&#39;ll want to think twice before shaking her hand. Or licking it.<br /><br />If that&#39;s not exciting enough for you, there was also that one time that the drummer from the Dead Kennedys grabbed my derriere in a bar in Tokyo and tried to kiss me. I thought about just letting it happen, not because he was in the Dead Kennedys but because I was drunk and apathetic. But then I remembered that that would be kind of slutty of me, so I made some excuses and left. Poor guy. I think he was bored, and I was one of the few people there who could speak English.

				<br />Great topic! I had totally been planning to start this thread at some point, but never got around to it. Not that I have all that much to report. I really don&#39;t know actors/actresses/famous people well at all to recognize them, so I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve been in the presence of more than I actually know - and usually have to have them pointed out to me.<br /><br />That said, this summer I saw Jimmy Fallon eating dinner with 2 other people right by the big open window in a restaurant on maybe 25th St, between 5th &amp; Madison or around there. I walked by and thought it was him, but doubted myself since I never see celebrities. So I turned back around and then walked slowly past a second time. Yup it was him! So cute!<br /><br />I also saw Katie Holmes and some other famous kid several years ago (before she was part of &quot;TomKat&quot;) outside at a bar near the 57th St N stop- had to have them pointed out to me though.<br /><br />Oh and I used to work at World Music Institute producing concerts, and a couple famous people came to our Flamenco Festival. Specifically I remember Viggo Mortensen, who played Aragorn in the Lord of the Rings trilogy! Very exciting, though I never would have recognized him with his short hair and soccer shirt on, if it weren&#39;t for my friends. We were all so excited, and kept track of his whereabouts, and he even bought a CD from our sales table, so we got his AUTOGRAPH when he signed his credit card receipt ;-)<br /><br />Oh, also saw Jason Bigg (is that his name?) and Woody Allen when they were filming by Ditmars a few years back - they were doing a driving scene, which was really interesting to see because I saw them in the little red car, on top of a flat bed truck that pulled them along so they didn&#39;t have to really drive. What movie was that - I never checked it out, but they filmed some scenes in Astoria.

How old is that picture? I think he&#39;s hot now, but from a few years back... he looks REALLY good. It&#39;s really embarrassing how much I envy his wife.&nbsp; :oops:<br /><br />And as a Texan, I, too, am very sad to hear about Ann Richards. She really shook things up down there when she was on the scene. I was too young to appreciate her in her hey-day, or even vote for her, but she rawked. I was talking to my liberal Aunt back in Fort Worth this weekend (we&#39;re the only two in the fam) - she&#39;s a little worried that the vote might be split a bit (I love Kinky Friedman, but he&#39;d be the one doing the splitting), which would lead to Perry being re-elected. Oh well. :-(<br /><br />And I forgot one VERY pivotal sighting. Actually it was a press event for some anniversary (40 yrs?) of the Sound of Music. The whole cast was there except the Captain - bummer. And I RSVP&#39;d and went just so I could say I was in the same room as Julie Andrews. We share a birthday, and let&#39;s just say I hold her in VERY high regard. So she was there, and I really wanted to take a picture of her or meet her, but it was really crowded and she was being &#39;handled&#39; by handlers. So I decided to go outside and &quot;wait for a friend&quot; by the exit, so that at some point she would pass by me and I could bask in the glow of Julie for a moment. Not only did she pass by, but she was talking as she did, so I HEARD HER VOICE. <br /><br />It was awesome.

				I don&#39;t see many celebrities (and <em>never</em> in Astoria or on the N train!), but I have seen a few:<br /><br />On the Upper East Side: Mike Wallace and James Earl Jones<br />At the 42nd St. Library: Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis<br />In Harlem: Maya Angelou<br /><br />Two incidents that involved speaking--sorry they aren&#39;t the real big names:<br /><br />While photocopying a newspaper article at the Tompkins Square library I got into a conversation with a guy at the copy machine; then I looked up and saw it was Tuli Kupferberg (of the Fugs; sorry, you probably have to be a baby boomer to know who he was).<br /><br />At a concert at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, before the show started, I learned from the conversation that the man sitting next to me was Norman Rosten, who had written a charming novel which I had recently read (<em>Under the Boardwalk</em>).&nbsp; He had also written a book about his friend Marilyn Monroe but it wasn&#39;t a bestseller, probably because it wasn&#39;t lurid enough (<em>Marilyn: An Untold Story</em>), as well as an elegy upon her death (&quot;Who Killed Norma Jean?&quot;).&nbsp; So I introduced myself.<br /><br />

				How have I never posted here?<br /><br />Ok, so I watched my friend Shannon have a seizure as Ice Cube walked by with a ho on his arm back in 2000, I watched my mom twirl in a full circle as she saw Richard Belzer walk into NYSC, and I almost knocked over Paul Simon (he&#39;s so little!) while walking on 21st Street over to Manhattan Color Lab with a few of my friends from school. I didn&#39;t realize it was him until I looked up. Note to everyone: pass on the right!<br /><br />OH! Also, Usher winked at me...my friend Diana used to work for Macy&#39;s, and she was a &quot;floatmaster&quot; for the 2001 Thanksgiving parade, so I latched onto that so I could be in the parade. haha! Anyway, we were in the staging area up on Central Park West, and Usher went by on a golf cart, and some girls started squealing, and then I made fun of the girls to another friend of mine and Diana&#39;s, Usher heard, and winked and pointed as he zoomed by. The squealey girls were jealous. Haha!<br /><br />Also, this isn&#39;t New York related (it happened at my old bookstore job in CT), but Emeril Lagasse once put his arm around me and said, &quot;ok...you ready to go, babe?&quot; He was there for a book signing and I was intro-ing him to the crowd of mallrat soccer moms :) Also, other authors that I met at that job - James Patterson asked me where he could get a drink (not many people showed up for him, I think he was pissed. I directed him to a Ruby Tuesday&#39;s in the mall - hey it was suburbia, and they have a full bar and it was right around the corner), and Anne Rice looked at me and said, &quot;hmmm...interesting.&quot;

				Also, you know what&#39;s funny? In most people&#39;s pictures with the celebrities, it&#39;s usually the non-celebrity who&#39;s wearing the bigger smile.

				<br />I&#39;ve lived in NY for 2+ years and I only have 2 stories... Disappointing, but here you go.<br /><br />At a work outing to a bar near Astor Place, the guy that played Newman in Seinfeld tried to sneak out past us.&nbsp; The entire group was about to do an Irish Car Bomb shot and started chanting, NEMAN, NEWMAN, NEWMAN. We had been there for a few hours already, he must have been waiting to leave when he thought we would be distracted. Anyway, he wasn&#39;t amused, and ran out as fast as he could.&nbsp; <br /><br />Walking through midtown with a friend from Florida who all of a sudden starts hyperventilating and reaching for her camera.&nbsp; I realize she is looking at the wax statue of Samuel L. Jackson...&nbsp; I explain and when we finally stopped laughing we realized that Cynthia Nixon had witnessed this entire exchange.
