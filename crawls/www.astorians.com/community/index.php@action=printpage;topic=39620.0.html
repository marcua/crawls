				Hopefully it&#039;ll be replaced by some high-end yogurt or crepe place. Or a rustic looking pub, with natural wood, brick and copper/iron/bronze ornaments. Something new that we need. And decently priced. Perhaps with a twist, like free wifi or arcade machines.

				Plans haven&#039;t been filed yet but I think it will be a mixed used development with apartments over retail at street level.

Newer residential developments are less likely to have eateries on the ground floor.&nbsp; You&#039;ll see more things like florists, nail shops, salons, dentist offices, etc.&nbsp; With luck, any longstanding places such as El Olivo, will find another spot in the immediate vicinity (I can&#039;t imagine Flattops making it!)&nbsp;

				Omg....I am sickened at how pure GREED (and that&#039;s what it&#039;s all about) is allowing yet another great neighborhood to change so quickly!&nbsp; Buildings are being torn down and put up everywhere.&nbsp; The overall # of residents is increasing, which means more packed trains.&nbsp; Rents will continue to skyrocket.&nbsp; And all the new businesses will have the same look, and the overall same type of patrons (i.e., with no old-school residents).<br /><br />That&#039;s what I like about Astoria...the mix of people, and the old-school diners and bars.&nbsp; Sure lots of the new stuff is great, but let&#039;s face it...it&#039;s the older places that are more in danger, with each and every new business or luxury building or &#039;mixed-use&#039; building that goes up.<br /><br />I also heard that Astor Bake Shop is now closed!!&nbsp; Granted, the table service there was always quite lackluster and extremely slow, but the restaurant itself had such a nice ambiance.. .bright and sunny in the day, good food overall (and their pancakes were the best I&#039;ve found in Astoria) ...and at night it was a cozy beacon in an otherwise no-man&#039;s-land part of Astoria.&nbsp; While I don&#039;t live over that way, I sure hope another restaurant takes that spot as there&#039;s nothing else there for nearby residents.<br /><br />As for Wave Thai, it so happens I only &#039;discovered&#039; this place very recently.&nbsp; I went with other friends in the nabe who liked it, my friend got the Street Noodle dish with Beef, I tried it and...I was hooked!&nbsp; I&#039;ve since ordered that dish a number of times for either takeout or eating in the restaurant (which had a very nice d√©cor).<br /><br />Ugh...just what we need...more construction.&nbsp; What bothers me more than anything about all this is the underlying sentiment..the core of all this...it&#039;s people making deals behind the scenes....poor immigrant workers (often Mexican) doing all this dangerous work.... rich developers who could care less and just see profit in their eyes...often poor-quality fixtures inside all the new apartments which are &#039;designed&#039; to look all modern and sparkly but are indeed s___ apartments....wide-eyed newbies who move here and think their $2400 One-Month Free 1BR apt is a bargain compared to their old place in Brooklyn....old businesses forced out...etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />I hate to think the day may come where I decide Astoria just ain&#039;t for me anymore....&nbsp; ;-(<br /><br />Oh..and other person here who wrote: &quot;Hopefully it&#039;ll be replaced by some high-end yogurt or crepe place. Or a rustic looking pub, with natural wood, brick and copper/iron/bronze ornaments. Something new that we need. And decently priced. Perhaps with a twist, like free wifi or arcade machines.&quot;<br /><br />I had to wonder if they were being sarcastic?&nbsp; We already have a high-end yogurt crepe a few blocks away on Ditmars.&nbsp; Rustic pub?...could that be a dig at .....some of those newer bars on Ditmars that went up a year or so ago?...Arcade machines?...clearly a dig at Flattops.&nbsp; ;-)
