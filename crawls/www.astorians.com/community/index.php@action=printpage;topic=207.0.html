				I want to plant a garden this spring. &nbsp;<br /><br />OK, I would be satisfied with planting a few pots of basil, chives, oregano, mint, parsley, and lemongrass. &nbsp;Maybe cherry tomatoes. &nbsp;Ohhh, eggplant. &nbsp;Broccoli. &nbsp;Sugar-snap peas. &nbsp;Zucchini, summer squash, spiiiiiiiiiinach! &nbsp;Okra. &nbsp;Cukes. &nbsp;Is it hot in here? &nbsp;<br /><br />1) Astoria has 2 community gardens, neither of which is satisfactory/accessible/safe <br />2) My landlord won't let me go on the roof, much less plant stuff up there.<br />3) My fire escape isn't feasible either. &nbsp;<br /><br />Does anyone have access to some dirt in a relatively safe place? &nbsp;Can we talk? &nbsp;PM me.

				I too would be interested in doing a Garden. In upstate before I moved here I use to have a vegetable garden, a herb garden, and a flower garden. It was so nice when I wanted to cook and could get fresh vegetables and herbs and decorate the table with flowers from my garden. I'm all out on the garden idea hook me up.<br /><br />Colleen

				Wow Colleen. You better be careful. With all this talk of vegetables and herbs people might mistake you for a Vegestorian. &nbsp;:lol: <br /><br />I think it would be really cool to have a community garden of some kind around here.

				Just cause I am a meat loving eater doesnt mean that I don't love and enjoy eating vegetables too! Especially home grown tomatoes, nothing in the world beats home grown tomatoes. &nbsp;:lol: &nbsp;Also just cause I eat meat doesn't mean that I don't enjoy a good salad once in awhile like today for lunch. :D <br /><br />Colleen

				hey, look what i found!<br /><br />(if you already know about this organization, sorry! i'm not originally from these here parts... ;) &nbsp;)<br /><br />http://www.arrowonline.org<br /><br />it's an organization here in astoria, and they've put together a garden.<br />maybe we can contact them to see if they would be able to help us with a garden up here in the ditmars area...<br /><br />or we could be pioneers and start our own thing w/o their help.<br /><br />Rosemary

				I walked past this garden last spring and it really wasn't much of a garden. &nbsp;However, it may be that things have changed since then, so I'm willing to mosey over again and have another look ..... &nbsp;but I think they're more about building community than fresh tomatoes. &nbsp;Both of which are entirely valid goals, of course.

				hey there...<br /><br />i think also passed by this garden too... yeah, it's not the botanical gardens, it was built by people in the same community! <br /><br />but at the same time, i was passing by that garden on my way to something else... i dont know if i'm lazy or... but i dont know if i'd want to go that much out of my way to tend my garden. <br /><br />so, with that... i just finished a course on community organizing (which i got an A in, thank you very much, and which was quite inspiring and exciting) and i've never lived anywhere long enough to consider a place 'my community' but i hope stay in this ditmars, astoria area and call it my community. <br /><br />so if there is <strong>enough people </strong> (<strong>i.e. we need numbers here! not just 3 cool ladies who like to crochet &nbsp;:lol:</strong> &nbsp;) in the ditmars area community interested in getting a garden here, i'd be very willing to help out and do the footwork/paperwork/advocacy required to get this done.<br /><br />Rosemary <br /><br />(sorry for my incoherent rambling... this is exactly why i dont participate in the writer's group on mondays. &nbsp;:oops: )

				I am not old, I do not crochet (much - but by most accounts I am a lady) and I am interested --- &nbsp;who else? show of hands?<br /><br />What can I do to help? &nbsp;I know there are support organizations for community gardens ... when I have a free minute I'll do some research and post what I find.

				Here is a fact sheet on starting a garden from the American Community Garden Association:<br /><br />http://www.communitygarden.org/starting.php<br /><br />there are other helpful publications at http://www.communitygarden.org/<br /><br />http://www.greenguerillas.org/ and http://www.moregardens.org/ are resources for NYC gardeners<br /><br />http://www.gardenweb.com/ I haven't looked at much yet, but it might be helpful<br /><br /><br />Is anyone else interested in meeting to guage interest in a garden and discuss options, etc? &nbsp;Post here or email me at enigmacat@yahoo.com.<br /><br />Errr .. I got to thinking and I guess this should go to the Community section at this point. &nbsp;So I'll cross-post this there.

				Just because I like to Crochet, does not mean I am old. :( I haven't even hit 30 yet! (almost, but not yet!) A lot of young people these days are learning how to knit and crochet and men too! Crochet is the new &quot;in&quot; thing to do. I used to be embarrassed to crochet because I used to think only old ladies did it and I think that's why whenever my Mom tried to teach me growing up I couldn't learn it. Now I can proudly crochet in public, I am out of the crochet closet and don't have to be afraid now. Also as one of my friends brought up (who is also out of the crochet closet and knitting closet) it makes us better wilderness survival people because we can make most of our stuff out of anything that we can cut up into strips, even grass huts if I had to as long as I had my crochet hooks on me. &nbsp;:P <br /><br />As for the garden, I would love to be apart of it. We need to get the word out and find other people who are also interested in it. I would love to be able to have fresh vegetables and herbs once again. Who knows, maybe it will help me gain some more wilderness survival tips because you just never know when you might need them.

				old?<br /><br />who said anything about old?<br /><br />when i said numbers i meant, we need a substantial amount of individuals who are intersted to put their time and sweat equity into starting a community garden here in the ditmars area. <br /><br />thanks for putting up those links about community gardens groups.<br />we actually had a few people do class presentations about the green guerillas and vaguely know about their organization. but it is out there, and it seems like they have done a lot of good work in gardens in manhattan and the bronx. <br /><br />so once again to the astorians.net community--&gt; if you are interested, please post up a response, or contact the other poster's email. <br /><br />the more interest we have, the sooner we'll have the garden. :)<br /><br />Rosemary
