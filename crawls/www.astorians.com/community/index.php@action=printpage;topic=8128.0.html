				Hello!&nbsp; It&#039;s been a while but I thought this is where to unload this one.<br /><br />Did anyone else have a LOT of bad tomatoes in their tomato share?&nbsp; Last year, i got my share, then started production on Saturday with my large box of tomatoes.&nbsp; In the end, there were a few bad ones but I got 16 jars of tomato-based product.<br /><br />This year, I only got 12.&nbsp; 4 jars may not sound like a lot but when you think of it in terms of diced tomatoes it&#039;s considerable.&nbsp; I threw out a LOT ot tomatoes.&nbsp; Here&#039;s the sick part - there were maggots on a lot of them.&nbsp; Based on my wife&#039;s science background and labwork, she estimated that the maggots were hatched 12-16 days prior to their discovery on Saturday.&nbsp; YIKES!!<br /><br />I still have a dozen jars of delicious summery goodness to be cracked open in winter time, but the rot issue added a lot of frustration and time to the whole job.

				That&#039;s gross.<br /><br />I had some great tomato earlier in the season but I did the processing Tues/Weds/Thurs -- and the later in the season tomatoes were getting softer faster &amp; I was losing more to rot.<br /><br />I canned um 3 of the 4 weeks tomato was offered.&nbsp; <br /><br />From looking up maggots (fun reading) -- the full life cycle (to full fledged fly) is 12-14 days so unless you had flies and not maggots, I think the cycle might have been a bit shorter.&nbsp; That being said I haven&#039;t gotten my CSI on lately so I can&#039;t claim expert status on that one.<br /><br />-j

				Sorry to hear about the tomatoes and their visitors, photomill.&nbsp; That is totally frustrating, not too mention, totally grody.<br /><br />Last year I had a lot of bad tomatoes.&nbsp; This year, I only had to pitch one from the box.&nbsp; I received them on the 18th.&nbsp; I canned on the Friday after I received the tomatoes.
