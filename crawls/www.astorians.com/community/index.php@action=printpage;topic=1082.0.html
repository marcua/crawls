				My wife and I went into the healthfood store this weekend (our 3rd time) and were suprised to see that on a couple items that we bought a week or so ago the prices have gone up about 15%. This saddened me a lot because for me personally it is pricing me out of shopping there.<br /><br />For example, the Vegenaise which I normally buy at another health food store runs about $6.50 for the quart size. This is already a high price as you can get it some places in Manhattan for less. However - it's still within my price range. Well, our local store here was charging $7.19 for it last week. Yesterday we go in and it's now $8.99 (!!) $9 for a jar of Mayonaise is a little much folks. $7.19 was already a squeeze for me. Prices on other items have gone up as well.<br /><br />I think maybe the owners are wanting to bring in more revenue, and are raising prices in order to do that, but I think they should consider lowering prices to bring in more revenue instead. There are a lot of people walking in and out of that place not buying anything because the prices are simply too high. <br /><br />I hope they have enough capital for the start up, because one must realize that when you start a business you need like an entire year of operating capital in order to succeed. The key is to build your customer base in the first year, if anything, to have your prices abnormally low. Introducing new customers to your store with unreasonably high prices is a sure way to keep people from coming back, so even if you do lower your prices in the future, the customers you've driven away won't know it. They are making it so hard on themselves in my opinion.<br /><br />I really want to support local health food, however there's a point at which the additional price subsidy just isn't feasable for me. Which saddens me a lot.<br /><br />Is there anyone else who is experiencing thoughts or feelings over this?

				I too think the prices are high. &nbsp;I'm more than happy to pay a little more at a neighborhood store to support a local business but there is a point at which the increased cost overcomes the &quot;goodwill&quot; and lower cost wins out. &nbsp;<br /><br />I price compared over the weekend, comparing Whole Paycheck (Whole Foods) with Fresh Start. &nbsp;Prices were relatively on par, slightly more expensive at Fresh Start.... but eeeeks, still high.<br /><br />I was in the other day and there had been some price crisis where things were being priced higher than they should have been so perhaps it's worth asking if the price is right (correct) before you consider buying it.<br /><br /><br />-j

				I also think the prices are too high. &nbsp;I shopped for 4 years out on Long Island at Wild By Nature, a Whole Foods type of place (but not nearly as good), and although their prices were high, this new local place is even higher! &nbsp;So high that some of the prices are simply absurd. &nbsp;It's hard for me (and I am thinking in the place I will be when making more $$) to justify spending that much on certain items. &nbsp;The prepared food looked a bit pricey, too. &nbsp;I try my best to support local businesses, and have for many years, but like Matt and Jayme, it is hard to do this with prices so high.<br /><br />And Jayme, I had never heard Whole Foods called Whole Paycheck, but that is quite accurate!

				maybe y'all ought to provide them with a bit of feedback, saying that you would shop there and spend X amount weekly if prices were more reasonable. &nbsp;if they realize how many potential customers they are turning off, maybe they'll make some adjustments.

				For me personally they don't even have to be low, just competitive.<br /><br />I think it's a great advantage to be able to go down the street to get products locally. But when there is a 30% surcharge, that is more than I can afford.

				I find that one great way for stores to make money is to sell lots of comfort food items and impulse - buy items for reasonable prices...<br />When I go into health food stores I usually wind up buying healthy chips, veggie bootie, Garden of Eaten nachos, nuts in bulk / trail mix, etc. &nbsp;Another thing that works is to have specials on veggies ... Picking up something that is convenient on my way home when i am thinking about what to make for dinner. &nbsp;Kale, Collards, etc. <br /><br />Some items will always be high, like organic meats and cahew butters / peanut butters. &nbsp;But generally if everything is just too high then people feel they are paying too much all around. <br /><br />I did not get to see how much the juices were...<br />It would be nice to get some green juice !!!<br /><br />&nbsp;:)

				my boyfriend and i are definitely on the same page with these concerns~ my first thought was, well, give them a chance, maybe they'll start lowering prices once everything is up &amp; running.... &nbsp;and that i typically think prices are way too high for everything anyways, so that maybe i wasn't the best judge.... <br /><br />but now i see that apparently we're not the only ones! &nbsp;we haven't been going in since we noticed prices were higher on the staple items that we are usually willing to pay a little more for, albeit in manhattan. &nbsp;i guess i don't feel comfortable posting all of those prices online myself just now.... &nbsp;but anyways, we were pretty excited to see them here, and the expectation built up so it is dissappointing. &nbsp;for me, it's the staple items that draw me in: if i can get a good price on necessary things i might pay something more for something new or special. &nbsp;<br /><br />to make matters worse, there were actually some items that i ordered in the first week when they opened their doors, before they were officially opened but were encouraging orders; and out of the four things that i ordered, only two ever came in- sort of. &nbsp;problem is, one of the two items was the wrong brand, which i cannot use (for allergic reasons: it was a hygeine product;) and the other came in the wrong size: too small, and yet their smaller size was the same price as what the larger size usually costs! &nbsp;i decided not to say anything to fix the situation since i can't afford the correct items at that cost anyways, and i went elsewhere....<br /><br />somebody said that we should raise these concerns to them- are businesses typically open to changing their entire price scale? &nbsp;i wonder how they would receive this....<br /><br />nicole

				I'm sure that with a little time someone from the store will stumble across the board. Or someone who reads the board will say something to them. It's inevitable.

				I was at Fresh Start this week and noticed that the prices were coming down and were now much more competitive. &nbsp;The owners are very friendly and were happy when I told them that their prices (when they 1st opened) were higher than places like Whole Foods. &nbsp;They said they were getting their products from better suppliers now and that's why they were able to lower their prices. &nbsp;They also take requests. &nbsp;If they do not carry what we need, they will try to order it for us.<br /><br />I was really impressed to see all their homemade organic foods and vegan desserts. <br /><br />I think we should give it another try. They are local Astorians and it's nice to help out the &quot;mom and pop&quot; stores. &nbsp;As long as the prices are right. &nbsp;<br />Maybe we should all give them a &quot;fresh start&quot;. &nbsp;Hope this helps.

				I'm all for supporting the organic market. &nbsp;I'm happy to hear the prices are coming down some.<br /><br />Raves:<br /><br />The fresh food bar is good stuff. &nbsp;I like the wild rice, apple, cranberry, walnut side. &nbsp;It's something like 4.29 for a half a pound but half a pound means either 2 full (small) meals or 4 decent sides. &nbsp;It's got a nice flavor and is good to grab and go. &nbsp;<br /><br />Fresh juice. &nbsp;I had some apple/pear juice the other morning that was yum. &nbsp;A little expensive, yes, but good.<br /><br />I haven't bought bulk food yet though I'm looking forward to trying it. &nbsp;<br /><br />cheers,<br />jayme

				I too am all for supporting local businesses. However, like I said before my main complaint is that I'm in no position to subsidize one if the prices are too high - up to this point the prices have been what I would best describe as &quot;insane.&quot;<br /><br />The main product that gets me into a health food store these days is Vegenaise, which Fresh Start did carry. Broadway Natural has this for $6.50/qt and their prices are higher than you can get in most normal health food stores across the country. My parents pay $5.50 for Vegenaise at their local health food store.<br /><br />I've been in a couple times to check things out and haven't noticed a reduction in prices, however I'll check again. I did notice that they no longer carry Vegenaise at all however (not that I'd buy it at $8.99/qt anyway though, I probably wouldn't even pay $7.50 for it. I'd just go to Broadway Natural.)<br /><br />However, I usually will pick up another thing or two when I go to the store to pick up my Vegenaise. If they carried that at a reasonable price I'd at at minimum be going there once every other week. And if they had reasonable prices on other things I'm sure I'd pick up other stuff as well at least that often.<br /><br />The products I purchase the most currently are:<br />Vegenaise: 1qt (Currently pay $6.50 at Broadway Natural)<br />Earth Balance: (can't remember price currently, am going to go look and edit this - Broadway Natural)<br />Tofutti Cream Cheese: Occasionally $2.50-$2.99 Key Food<br /><br />I'll edit the above list as I think of more things. I know there are more, I've just forgotten the other ones! :)

				I was also disappointed in the new Health Food Store. &nbsp;I thought it was misleading to advertise &quot;Cafe&quot; when there are no stools for the several small tables. &nbsp;I inquired into the owners who said that they were planning to have a cafe in the back in the spring. &nbsp;The prices are high. &nbsp;Many of the items can already be found at Key Food. &nbsp;It seems to me, that the items offered should not duplicate a major store, who can already offer lower price items. &nbsp;One thing I can say, for my health needs I really like the home baked vegan food. &nbsp;The lentil vegetable soup was really good. &nbsp;It is really great to find food that is dairy free. &nbsp;When I told them what my needs were: no nuts or dried fruits in addition to dairy free; they said they would tell their baker. &nbsp;<br /><br />Stacey

				Specifics:<br /><br />I'm newly addicted to Liberte yogurt and they carry it at Fresh Start for $0.99 -- which is the //same// price as Key Food.<br /><br />I checked out the veganaise and it varied in price from $3.39 - $6.49, depending on size. &nbsp;Looks like a price decrease there too.<br /><br />The organic bread section looks good too. &nbsp;It's $3.99 a loaf but that's not up much from the $3+ I usually pay for non-organic bread. &nbsp;<br /><br />cheers,<br />jayme

				Just thought to add a bit of flavor to this mix (no pun intended); comparatively speaking the prices are not unreasonable, if you want to argue specifics there will always be one or two items in every store that you can find cheaper somewhere else. <br /><br />The food (made onsite mind you) almost always has a crisp, clean and savory essence, I say almost because not everything is to <em>my</em> liking... The staff is amazing, from the owners down to the jack of all trades (whose name is Ricardo, he introduced himself) have an extremely positive and attractive vibe which has from their self-effacing beginnings brought me back time and again. In a neighborhood where community is a priority, these people have it sown up.<br /><br />Their work ethic is tremendous, up until recently there have been very few times that I have not seen one or more members of the ownership there, working, not just overseeing.<br /><br />I for one am glad to have a healthy alternative to key food, mcdonalds and pizza that nourishes not only my body but my soul; they usually have great music playing too&nbsp; :-D.<br />

				I like the store too, but can&#39;t afford to shop there often. <br /><br />When they can sell almond butter for under $9/jar, I&#39;ll be impressed. For now, the cheapest I can find it is Fairway, at around $6.50. Usually it&#39;s at least $10-12.
