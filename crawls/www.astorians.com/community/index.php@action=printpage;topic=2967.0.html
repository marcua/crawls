				I&#39;ve read a little bit about this place in the archives, but I&#39;d like to know if anyone belongs to Astoria Sports Complex and how they find it.&nbsp; I went on a tour today and it seemed clean and friendly albeit tacky--but I&#39;d like to know if there is anything weird or bad about it before I commit to a year there.<br /><br />Emily

				i kinda heart your user name.&nbsp; there, i said it.<br /><br />but to answer your thread: i belong to <em>The Dolphin</em>, definitely the most terrible name ever for a gym :(&nbsp; &nbsp;I haven&#39;t been to the Astoria Sports Complex one, but did see the flyers.

				Its definitely improved a lot since it was &quot;Pump&quot; earlier this year.&nbsp; I can&#39;t speak on their cardio stuff (they seem to have a decent amount of it though) or the classes they offer (there&#39;s one seperate room for them), but I do like their weight room.&nbsp; Its never too crowded, and people seem to be fairly friendly.&nbsp; It&#39;s far from glamorous though, and it&#39;s in between Broadway and 30th on 31st Street -- not the most convenient location, but could be worse.&nbsp; They seem to be cool with letting you try it out for a few days and stuff before committing to either 6 months, 1 yr, or whatever.

				I was a member of the Sports Complex about 6-7 yrs ago, so things could have changed by now. &nbsp;Back then, it certainly was a model of &quot;you get what you pay for&quot;. &nbsp;They didn&#39;t have updated machines, things broke down, and it wasn&#39;t so modern. &nbsp;But it really wasn&#39;t too busy either, so you didn&#39;t wait long, they do have a pool and hot tub from what I remember, and raquetball, and maybe tennis? &nbsp;The only thing about the year commitment, is if you don&#39;t go, you&#39;re stuck with having paid for the whole year. &nbsp;<br /><br />The Matrix looks like a great gym, offers month to month, but is far- 45th and Ditmars.<br /><br />The Rock is good and 24hrs, but maybe expensive?<br /><br />I&#39;m a member of NYSC Astoria, and it&#39;s great. &nbsp;Plus they&#39;re all over the city so you never have an excuse not to go, cept your lazy self &nbsp;:-D &nbsp;(I&#39;m talking about me here)

				I was a member of ASC for about 2 years. The setup is fine and I love the fact that they have a pool. I didn&#39;t get there that often, but I didn&#39;t feel too bad about it b/c I had paid so little for it. The people are realy nice, and the equipment is kept up pretty well, and I love the fact that it is very much a community gym, with kids and older people, not all yuppies like NYSC.<br /><br />The only thing is that the locker rooms and showers are a little bit grody. It&#39;s fine if you can go home and shower afterwards, but if you want to shower at the gym and then go, it is not too appealing. <br /><br />But in the end, it was the distance and the lack of a gym partner that made me give up on it.

				I&#39;m an ASC member, but only for the cardio floor-and both my roomies jumped on my bandwagon.<br />I dig it.

The pool is 250 on its own, but 259 if you add another floor, and i want to say 300 for the whole shebang. My roomie was paying 80/mo for NYSC, so in comparison, it&#39;s a steal.

				Yeah, I lucked out with NYSC Astoria, I joined with grand opening promotions at $52/mo. &nbsp;That&#39;s the trick. &nbsp;Join when they just open and get the good rates. &nbsp;The next one to open is in Rego Park in the fall. &nbsp;I&#39;m on a charter membership, but can go to all the other gyms on off hours, 8-11am, 2-4pm, after 8:30pm, and all day weekends. &nbsp;Not too bad. &nbsp;Of course, I can&#39;t quit, I&#39;ll never find that rate again.

				Looks like there are a few specials for new members at ASC, and 6 months (thinking wintertime) is only $160.&nbsp; But $250/year is pretty good, too.&nbsp; Good to see that ASC allows non-members in to swim, too.

				Yeah, I belong to NYSC now, because I had some friends there and I thought it would inspire me to go more often, but really, I am just wasting $80 a month rather than $20 (I would also much rather be excercising outside then in a gym when the weather is this nice!). <br /><br />But yes, their locker rooms are very nice, as is the equipment, and the facts that you can use other NYSC&#39;s during off hours. AND there is natural light! But I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be staying on once my one year membership is up.

				I belonged to the Astoria Sports COmplex for a year. I was pregnant so I swam there, in that crazy pool. It was sort of a dirty gym and the locker room was scary but all in all, it was a great experience. Really not expensive and close to our apartment. I swam there 3 times a week for a couple of months and it was great. I used the cardio equipment once. Make sure you have a towel or some guy will tell you to get a towel. For a dirty place, there are lots of rules of hygiene. Also they let kids in the pool which really made me crazy, as I was the cranky pregnant woman who had yet to learn about tolerating children.

				I may have to check out Astoria Sports Complex as I need a cheap gym alternative...You couldn&#39;t pay me to go to NYSC as it is a bad bad place. Free weights there are a joke and don&#39;t get me started on what passes as personal training there. But the price looks right for ASC and I don&#39;t need a whole lot of fancy equipment anyways as it doesn&#39;t do anything but hamper your growth and fitness level. Thanks for the great info.

				My complaints about NYSC in Astoria (in no particular order)<br />1.&nbsp; lousy trainers (one of them just talks to female gymgoers all day)...just today I overheard him missing an appointment because he was so wrapped up chatting up some girl on a bike.&nbsp; give me a break<br />2.&nbsp; lousy TV reception; they have direct TV I think, and they recently lost channel 5, espn, and a few others.&nbsp; they probably have the absolute cheapest package so I get no decent channels, the scrubs.<br />3.&nbsp; music stinks: either they are playing z100 or lousy pop fluff...I cannot listen to and/or watch linsey lohan flirting with herbie the love bug with heavy weights in hand<br />4.&nbsp; the elevators are quite possibly the worst in queens; they are constantly out of order...I mean, I don&#39;t mind using the stairs (it IS a nice cardio thing) but to have BOTH elevators out???&nbsp; jeez louise<br /><br />so why the hell am I still a member? i have no idea... :-P...i should probably join the rock since I live off of ditmars<br /><br />-Rob

I see this at all the branches), and still see plenty of folks flaunting the cellphone rule (had to shoo away a guy with a cellpone who was sitting on a machine I wanted to use ... gave me a dirty look ... got a piece of my mind and a stern lecture from the trainer on guard duty ... will never understand the absolute idiocy and total self absorbtion of many cellphone users).<br /><br />But overall, I give the 30th Ave NYSC a huge thumbs up, and not just because I can walk to it.&nbsp; Overall, it&#39;s pretty well run and has a very good vibe about it.&nbsp; I enjoy going there.

				Astoria Sports Complex is fine if you are going to the gym to actually work out. (not like some people that parade around the machines to try and chat up the meat heads, lol) <br /><br />I&#39;ve been a member there for approx. 4 yrs now. It&#39;s a semi-small gym. It has free weights and machines downstairs and cardio upstairs. Like others on here have said.....its $250 for both floors for the year, which I say is a great deal compared to other neighborhood gyms. <br /><br />Nobody bothers you there and you really don&#39;t have to wait long if not at all for the machines. The most crowded times is after work around 6 and 7pm. <br /><br />GO FOR IT.....

				i&#39;ve been looking around for gyms and have finally decided to join ASC in the coming week. i will be getting their pool and cardio package. <br /><br />now that i&#39;m finally settled on a gym, i need a gym buddy.<br /><br />ideally i would be working out right after work for one hour each day (but we can work this around your schedule as well) and once early and then later at night on weekends.<br /><br />obviously that&#39;s an idealistic goal, anyone care to share in it?<br /><br />i&#39;ve generally always been fit- but college and living with my boyfriend have allowed me to let myself go and i really need to get into shape.

				I&#039;ve been a member of ASC about 4 months now....love that it&#039;s cheap and convenient, but I&#039;m really disappointed they don&#039;t have any recycling bins for water and Gatorade bottles. I wrote a letter to Steve Poliseno [the president of ASC] about a month ago about it but I haven&#039;t seen any changes. Any other frustrated ASC members want to join me in asking for some greener measures? <br /><br />ok, I&#039;m off my soapbox now.&nbsp;

				My husband goes to ASC.&nbsp; The gym itself is outdated but he enjoys the pool.&nbsp; It&#039;s cheap too.&nbsp; I go to Club Fitness on Broadway between 32nd St and 31st.&nbsp; I highly recommend it.&nbsp; It&#039;s 3 stories, has the latest state of the art equipment, very clean, is never really crowded, great classes, has a day spa and the bathroom has a sitting area, sauna, steam room, and jacuzzi.&nbsp; I use to belong to NYSC and Club Fitness is by far better.&nbsp; They are equally priced too.&nbsp;

The first few times fine, you were excited to join a new gym.
