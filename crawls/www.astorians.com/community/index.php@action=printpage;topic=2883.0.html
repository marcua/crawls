				<strong>Con Ed Says Repairs To Electric Grid May Take Seven Months</strong><br /><br />http://ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=1&amp;aid=61584 (http://ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=1&amp;aid=61584)<br /><br /><em>August 04, 2006</em><br /><br />In a report issued Friday, Con Edison says it could take until February to repair the damaged power system in Northwest Queens. NY1’s Josh Robin filed this report. <br /><br />Some Queens residents waiting for normal power might have to wait a few months. Con Ed now says it expects work on its embattled network will last until February, seven months from now. That&#39;s according to a report from the utility to state regulators released late Friday. <br /><br />The 69-page document says the company plans to have on average about 3 percent of its electric operations crew - about 100 workers - in the area through the beginning of next year, tending to the failed system. <br /><br />Customers in the area have power already. Con Ed is just fixing what brought about last month&#39;s outage in an attempt to prevent a devastating repeat. <br /><br />But many get their juice not from an electric grid, but 50 fuel-fired generators. Those will be there indefinitely, the utility says. Con Ed cannot say when those will be gone. <br /><br />Customers can&#39;t spot the difference inside their homes between generator power and electric power. But outside, some complain about the large mobile units that belch fumes and are taking up that valuable New York commodity - parking spaces. <br /><br />Asked about the timetable, a spokesman said: &quot;The complete rebuilding of the network will take several months, but we are going to do it safely and expeditiously as possible to minimize inconvenience.&quot; <br /><br />But Queens Assemblyman Michael Gianaris says February seems too long. <br /><br />“The cover up is continuing. They tell us they don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong with it, but they know how long it&#39;s going to take to fix it, apparently,” he says. “Look, I&#39;m not an engineer, but it would seem to me in six months you can rebuild an entire network, much less just repair the damage that was done.&quot; <br /><br />This report is Con Ed&#39;s second attempt. The state commission that oversees the utility rejected the first one, calling it “unresponsive and virtually useless.” <br /><br />Whether this one is sufficient isn&#39;t known. A spokeswoman for the state authority would only say it has been received. <br /><br /><em>- Josh Robin </em> <br /><br />&nbsp;:?

				For those with short memories, didn&#39;t the local pols support Bloomberg when he ran for mayor? Are not the local officials part of Bloomberg&#39;s city-wide manic development push? <br /><br />What does &quot;repair&quot; to the grid mean? <br /><br />Did they suddenly get a handle on the number of people in the grid? What are their estimates? <br /><br />Did they take into account the impact that new development projects will have on the infrastructure? Schools, sewage, traffic, et al?<br /><br />How reliable are the electric supply over the next 10 years? What assumptions are behind the benign statements of adequate supply?<br /><br />We have a closed fire house, inadequate medical facilities, the dirtiest streets in Queens, an overwhelmed sewage plant, dangerous pollution from traffic, power plants, and an airport, trailers in playgrounds substituting as school rooms and an overwhelmed electrical grid that now it seems everyone (except John Q Public) knew about. Should an independent body (with no ties to developers or politics) review the community&#39;s ability to sustain new development?<br /><br />What was the response by local officials and community boards in the first critical days of this crisis? Should there be an independent review of their emergency response? <br /><br />What was the pattern of areas that did not suffer badly from the brown out? Why were they hardly effected?<br /><br />For further fun, check out these links! &nbsp;<br /><br />http://www.qgazette.com/news/2005/0921/features/030.html<br /><br />http://hellskitchen.net/csdc/vallone/money/FOV1001-2500.htm<br /><br />http://www.nypost.com/postopinion/opedcolumnists/con_edison__our_creature_opedcolumnists_charles_e_f__millard.htm<br /><br />http://www.qgazette.com/news/2006/0628/features/037.html<br />

				Translation:<br /><br />In 7 months, the generators will no longer be needed because the temperature will have dropped by 60F.&nbsp; Until the summer blackout of &#39;07 that is.

				Cause in real estate, time is money! Fix this fast! fast! fast!<br /><br />It now seems there is a whole level of interaction between Con Ed and our community&#39;s leadership that most of us are not privy to. Who can argue against landscaping schools and playing softball? What fun!<br /><br />So the grid is shaky? Lives put at risk? Hard earned property in harms way? The key thing we must remember is not to discourage development (and the flow of campaign contributions). So lets all get along!<br /><br />If things blow up, one can always hold a hearing and do some tub thumping for good theatre. People have short memories. They will accept knee-jerk responses for complex problems.<br /><br />We can all share a chuckle next year as we lift a pint at the 19th hole!<br /><br />But seriously, after 9/11 we all thought that an emergency response to any crisis was in place. <br /><br />Now we know that its not. <br /><br />And good people, for this we can blame everyone from Bloomberg down to the talent at the local level.

				Current edition of the Western Queens Gazette, Letters to the Editor<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;What She&#39;d Like To Say:&quot; <br />&nbsp;<br />Dear Mayor Bloomberg: <br />&nbsp;<br />Thank you for going to Astoria Park to hold your &quot;photo-op&quot; yesterday evening [July 20]. My fellow Astorians are quite upset with Con Edison and our elected officials, with good reason. <br />&nbsp;<br />As you know, our electric power went out on Monday evening, July 17. We are currently [July 21] without power, despite paying a big rate increase since December 2005. That being said, a new power plant has just been completed in our neighborhood, that we do not benefit from. <br />&nbsp;<br />Con Edison is to present you with a report in two weeks regarding this problem. I hope you and our elected officials also accept your part in this growing crisis. Many of our one and two-family homes are being torn down and replaced with bigger luxury apartment complexes, condos and co-ops. You are allowing this expansion by granting Building Permits, hence &quot;your part&quot;. <br />&nbsp;<br />How is it just, to expect us citizens to save every food receipt, so we can claim our losses? Some stores do not offer receipts. I am told to &quot;get use[d] to&quot; the &quot;paperless era we are now in.&quot; <br />&nbsp;<br />Con Edison knows the problem was caused by their trying to supply power to all the new multidwellings and electric-run businesses recently added to our area. The demand for electric power far exceeds Con Edison&#39;s supply ability, as is now evident despite rate increases. <br />&nbsp;<br />Our elected officials make accusations and talk about cover-ups, while we the people suffer in silence, well, no more. There are numerous problems afflicting this community as well as others thruout [sic] the five boroughs. We are not unique. <br />&nbsp;<br />However, this is the straw that has broken our backs. <br />&nbsp;<br />Being angry only makes me sweat more, so instead, I will remember who is holding what office, when I decide where to place my vote, at the next election. <br />&nbsp;<br />Seeking Accountability, <br />Cathy Burch <br />Lifelong LIC-Astoria Resident <br />

				Yeah, some accountability would be good.<br /><br />This said, the problem wasn&#39;t supply. ConEd supplied (and distributed) considerably more electricity during the recent heat wave than they did during the blackout. The problem was distribution on an antiquated network, and resulting failures complicated by management error, which is a totally different issue. The letter writer is factually wrong.<br /><br />Also, I believe (correct me if I&#39;m wrong, somebody), that ConEd is regulated by NY State officials, not by the city. Bloomberg&#39;s administration has very little say over this, I suspect. Also, of course, he&#39;s not running for re-election, so threatening letters to him aren&#39;t going to do much...<br /><br />Regarding the 7 months thing, I&#39;d rather they run people on generators and take 7 months to fix it correctly then patch it together with chewing gum and rubber bands tomorrow... I&#39;m not sure I have a lot of confidence that they&#39;ll fix it correctly, but still...<br />

				I believe a legitimate (i.e. not done by ConEd) investigation would find that Con-Ed&#39;s &quot;demand reduction&quot; efforts greatly contributed to causing the blackout.<br /><br />First of all, I don&#39;t believe reducing voltage actually will reduce demand in a primarily residential area except maybe in the middle of winter.&nbsp; In fact I think it <strong>increases</strong> it.&nbsp; Very few devices used today are pure resistive loads that a voltage reduction will reduce the power consumption of.&nbsp; The only ones that spring to mind are light bulbs, toasters, electric ovens (how many people in our area don&#39;t use gas?), and space heaters (in the summer?).&nbsp; &nbsp; Electric motors (fans, A/C compressors, refrigerators) run <em>less efficiently</em> with reduced voltage and will actually draw <em>more power</em>.&nbsp; And I&#39;m fairly certain they are the bulk of residential electric load in the summer.&nbsp; <br /><br />On top of that, since it wasn&#39;t a supply problem, even if the power demand was unchanged by the voltage reduction Con Ed refers to as a &quot;demand reduction measure&quot;, the current being pulled through the wires increases proportionally to the reduced voltage, which depending on exactly where in the system the voltage is reduced, likely means much more current had to be pulled through the feeder cables, causing them to fail.<br /><br />The wear and tear caused by increased current from 33% undervoltage every evening for 3 straight months before the blackout I&#39;m sure didn&#39;t help any either.&nbsp;

				Nice insight in some of the points the Gazette writer raised.<br /><br />However, I am not so quick at believing that supply is ok. Of course,&nbsp; I was one of a handful that also did not believe in the reasons given for the war in Iraq back in 2003. <br /><br />Without carefully examining the underlying assumptions in such a statement (&quot;adequate supply for the next 6 years&quot;) it is difficult to understand exactly what it means. I have also read several other reports and the amount of time we have varies drastically (to as little as 2 years).<br /><br />No one is directly addressing one concern that the writer in the Gazette repeatedly makes: was the grid forced to carry a load it was not designed to handle? <br /><br />May we be in agreement that there was a dramatic increase on the system load that stems not only to inceased usage per capita, but a soaring number of users? <br /><br />

				I just got back from the 2:30 hearing.&nbsp; There were only 20 people in the room, mainly press.&nbsp; Assemblymember Gianaris and City Councilmember Eric Gioia both spoke, very eloquently, but only two residents.&nbsp; I hope the turnout is better for tonight, and tomorrow night&#39;s hearings.

The harder you dance the brighter the lights.<br /><br />Perhaps the most poignant lines in the Gazette letter are: <br /><br />&quot; a new power plant has just been completed in our neighborhood, that we do not benefit from.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Our elected officials make accusations and talk about cover-ups, while we the people suffer in silence.&quot;<br /><br />Speaks volumes about how regular folk are treated by the city. Just ask those in Richmond Hill or Maspeth about these things.<br /><br />As an aside, notice how brownout problems were minimal in areas with vibrant civic involvement and strong grassroots downzoning efforts? <br /><br />
