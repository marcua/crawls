			Maybe Astorians can create a new section entitled &quot;Safe Space&quot; for those who can&#039;t handle community activism in their neighborhood forums?&nbsp; Just a thought.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- Quote from: bstewart on February 14, 2017, 11:49:58 AM ---Maybe that section should be titled “Local Chat and Non-Issues” to avoid confusion.<br /><br />--- End quote ---<br />

Apparently, Astorians.com agrees and has moved this type of posturing out of the Local Issues area. Makes sense.

			&quot;Incendiary&quot;, &quot;posturing&quot;...that is your opinion and you are entitled to that opinion, but once again, you don&#039;t make the rules as to what people can post about in this forum, nor where they post it.&nbsp; Why do you think you are the arbiter of Astorians?&nbsp; This is a community forum, and the original post was directly related to an issue in our community.&nbsp; <br /><br />I see zero difference between Local Chat &amp; Issues and Random Gabble - but if moving the conversation helps you, then by all means, go for it.&nbsp; I think my suggestion of a &quot;Safe Space&quot; is perfect for you though.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--- Quote from: Eamonn on February 14, 2017, 01:52:01 PM ---There are plenty of forums to make incendiary political commentary.

The person who is, pushed it this topic to where it belongs. Political opinion has already been moved out of local topics that had nothing to do with me. If you disagree, please feel free to delete your account.

If you don&#039;t see how that is political posturing, then there is no reasoning with you.
