				My new year&#039;s resolution was to drink less often, and so far it&#039;s been pretty easy.&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;m just getting old (!),&nbsp; but I don&#039;t react well to alcohol anymore - I will spare you the details :)&nbsp; It&#039;s saving me money big time - which is great because I&#039;m pretty broke these days, and it&#039;s saving me calories.&nbsp; I usually just have a glass of wine when out with friends and then water the rest of the evening.&nbsp; You can have fun without drinking, I still go out with my friends, whether to a bar, club or movie, I&#039;m just not much of a drinker, and it&#039;s perfectly ok.&nbsp; I still have tons of fun, and I&#039;m better in the morning because of it.&nbsp; Plus with work killing me all week, I hate to waste my weekends because of some stupid hangover.&nbsp; &nbsp; Best of luck to you, I&#039;m really happy I made this decision, and I hope you will too.&nbsp;

				From reading your post, astoria luv, it sounds like you most want to drink when you are bored. So maybe the answer, or part of it, is to stay busy?<br /><br />Newell&#039;s suggestion of a hobby sounds good - other possibilities might be:<br /><br />Look for all-day volunteer opportunities (http://www.idealist.org) on the weekend to keep you busy. <br />Make dates with non-drinking friends, or friends who will support your dry spell, to do something fun and active<br />Go to Freeze Peach (http://www.freezepeach.org) for a cup of tea <br /><br />Good luck!

				When I go through these periods, I take more yoga classes and hit the gym more often. I also set short-term goals for not partaking in whatever, so it&#039;s not as daunting as &quot;I&#039;m never drinking again&quot;, more like &quot;I won&#039;t drink this week and then see how I feel,&quot; or I&#039;ll reward myself with a really nice bottle of wine at the end of the week/month/fortnight. <br />

				Thanks for the advice&nbsp; :-) <br /><br />I think part of the problem, and this was especially true over the summer, is that most...hmm, no ALL of my friends drink alcohol.&nbsp; I&#039;m probably the biggest and most irresponsible drinker of my group(s), but they still associate with me because they&#039;re good friends.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to lose the friends, but I find it very awkward and depressing to go to bars and social functions where this alcohol being served.&nbsp; Hmm, maybe I can drink in &quot;moderation.&quot;&nbsp; :-P

				Have you told your friends you&#039;re trying not to drink? Hopefully they would support you by adopting a few non-alcohol oriented activities. <br /><br />If you truly find it uncomfortable to be in a place where alcohol is served, I don&#039;t think you should have to compromise - at least not on a consistent basis.<br /><br />Tell your friends how you feel and invite them over to your place for scrabble and herbal tea/softdrinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				All really good suggestions. Especially letting your friends know what you are trying to accomplish.<br /><br />&nbsp;A few years back I stopped drinking alcohol for 6 months. It was hard but definitely worth it. I did things like go to museums (the MET is open Friday nights!), went to see movies and had friends over for monopoly and other board games. I felt so much better physically as well as mentally (for having the will power to give it up)Plus it made me appreciate even more when I finally did decide to have a drink.<br /><br />Good luck!

				It is difficult and frustrating to go out when everyone else is not drinking. But then finsihing a drink and not having another in your hand, while everyone else (who has more success drinking in moderation) are having a blast and sipping (or chugging) their alcohol has one in hand, sometimes double fisting them...I have changed my drinking behaivor, which was also a little out of control, by always ordering a glass of water with each drink. I leave it on the bar, finish my wine, get a happy littlek buzz and then go to work on the glass of water...then I keep this pattern going...drink, water, drink, water..I still get inebriated, stay under control and because you don&#039;t get dehydrated, less hung over in the morning...just a thought.

				I also go through periods of not drinking -- so I make up non-alcoholic cocktails.<br /><br />I like the cranberry seltzer with lime.&nbsp; No alcohol but is kinda tasty -- better than straight cran.<br /><br />Your friends will understand, your bartenders will understand, and you&#039;ll enjoy being sober -- even when you are out socially.&nbsp; <br /><br />Pool is a great thing to do as people get a bit better at it with a drink and then significantly worse after a few.&nbsp; Remain the sober one in the bunch and you&#039;ll rule the table in a few games :)<br /><br />

				way to go!<br /><br />this year i have decided to be Straight Edge. Forever. straight edge meaning dont drink, dont smoke, dont f___ (promiscuous sex). <br /><br />the one reason why i am doing this is because i find it ridiculous that we have adopted this way of socializing... you dont need to drink alcohol or do any kind of drugs to socialize with friends. you can go to play pool, go out to eat, get coffee/tea, .....anything. you can drink liquids. just not alcohol. yes, my friends still ask me to join them for drinks at bars after work etc. i go to be with them. not for the drink. yes, i go and order a $3 bottle of water or soda, and the bartender hates me, but i dont care. also, people do ask. i just say i&#039;m straight edge. if they ask more questions, i will answer, but most people are cool about it. <br /><br />the point is to be there with your friends. <br /><br />i dont know what you enjoy doing, but start doing more of that. journaling, art, crafts, projects around the home, reading, spending more time with friends, excercisng etc.... enjoy it...<br /><br />some basic info about being straight edge:<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_edge<br />

				I cut down on my drinking significantly when I started dating someone who didn&#039;t really drink.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t a deliberate choice but I just starting spending so much time with a non drinker that it wore off on me.&nbsp; A few months into it I found myself having fuller, non-hungover, wasted weekends.&nbsp; I&#039;m an artist and also became much more prolific from having more time and energy.&nbsp; My skin looked better and I also lost weight without even trying, what girl doesn&#039;t love THAT!&nbsp; It also has made me reflect on the time when I did drink more, I never realized it but I really had become a binge drinker, drinking WAY more than was necessary to have a good time. Now when I drink I try to keep it to a two drink minimum, when I drink more I find I just get depressed, since alcohol is a depressant after all.&nbsp; Talk to your friends and ask them to support you in this decision, if they are true friends that care about you, they will.&nbsp; Good luck! :mrgreen:

				When I don&#039;t want to drink because of money or because I&#039;m just not in the mood I just have water with a twist of lime or I&#039;ll have what someone above said -- a virgin drink (non alcoholic).&nbsp; I have fun anyways because a) I never drink more than three drinks anyways and I&#039;m one of those that nurses the drinks, and b) I&#039;m insane anyways so I don&#039;t need the alcohol.<br /><br />If you have a fun bunch of friends you won&#039;t miss the alcohol, you&#039;ll just feel strange not having a glass in your and...hence virgin drinks.<br /><br />

				I too am thinking of knocking out the drinking for a while.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I may have mentioned in a previous thread that I&#039;ll be taking over the super duties in my apt building and tho I&#039;ll now have more socializing cash, I&#039;ll have less time to do it.&nbsp; On top of that, there&#039;s the fact my body has two reactions to alcohol.&nbsp; &nbsp;The first is that I get a little happy, a little buzzed and am fine the next day.&nbsp; &nbsp;The OTHER scenario is getting a LOT happy, blowing off responsibilities and being massively hung over the next day.&nbsp; &nbsp; This has happened with as little as 4 beers.&nbsp; &nbsp;Conversely, I&#039;ve drank as much as a 12pack with little or no after effects.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just can&#039;t take the chance with all the catching up I&#039;m going to have to do here.&nbsp; &nbsp; The old super is/was not very responsible and there&#039;s lots to do just to get started with the taking-care of the building... so to keep the new gig and build my rep with my landlord, I&#039;m going to try to seriously moderate my alcohol intake.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I won&#039;t be that busy that I can&#039;t do the little odd-jobs for you people from time to time, so you know where to reach me.&nbsp; &nbsp; :mrgreen:

				These are all good and insightful posts!&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; I had my first <strong>dry</strong> Friday and/or Saturday night for the first time since last August.&nbsp; It was pretty rough because a friend of mine was having some big party and I had to tell him that I couldn&#039;t go.&nbsp; He called me a couple of times, asking if I would reconsider, but to me, it was just too soon.&nbsp; He said he was OK, but I sensed that he was upset.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=5304.msg58090.html#msg58090">Quote from: lizluv43 on February 24, 2007, 08:12:51 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">When I don&#039;t want to drink because of money or because I&#039;m just not in the mood I just have water with a twist of lime or I&#039;ll have what someone above said -- a virgin drink (non alcoholic).&nbsp; I have fun anyways because a) I never drink more than three drinks anyways and I&#039;m one of those that nurses the drinks, and b) I&#039;m insane anyways so I don&#039;t need the alcohol.<br /><br />If you have a fun bunch of friends you won&#039;t miss the alcohol, you&#039;ll just feel strange not having a glass in your and...hence virgin drinks.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I guess I must have a problem because I can&#039;t drink nonalcoholic drinks at a bar/club/party and not feel really lonely and depressed as everyone around me is drinking alcohol.&nbsp; I think it has more to do with a need to fit in and feel good than a genuine need for alcohol.&nbsp; In fact, the sad thing about my drinking, is that I become somewhat unsociable after four or five Jack Daniels and an equal amount of Stella&#039;s, which defeats the whole purpose of me going out on the weekends!&nbsp; I go to the bar to meet with the regulars and my friends, not necessarily to get as f*ed up as possible. That being said, I don&#039;t ever get belligerent, violent or extremely obnoxious, I just get very sullen and introspective.&nbsp; I think that&#039;s why my friends, although concerned, put up with my excessive drinking.<br /><br />Thanks, again, for all of the advise.&nbsp;

				Lots of good suggestions so far. I haven&#039;t drank or done any drogas in 7 years (long story, predictable ending). It can still be difficult for me to attend some social functions where libations and favors are abound. I think people should do whatever they hell they want in whatever quantity they like, I just can&#039;t.<br /><br />I concur with the specialty non-alcoholic cocktail suggestion. They make me feel pretty (ha ha). My favorites are soda water with bitters and a twist, cranberry juice and ginger ale, and a sprite screwdriver. I recommend tipping well, since the bartenders generally won&#039;t serve the person getting a coke before the gang of party-goers ordering fifteen shots of Bacardi.<br /><br />In the beginning I just started playing pool (hobby) by myself a few nights a week. I was out and about, but had a task at hand, plus side is that I am lethal on the felt now.<br /><br />I would also have an exit plan wherever I went, meaning that I wouldn&#039;t rely on someone else for transportation. If I went to a party, I would get myself there so I wouldn&#039;t have to deal with hauling drunk people around or waiting for people that were really into the scene. It was pretty simple, if I felt uncomfortable, I would give everyone a cordial goodbye (pounds and daps) and tell them I had a prior obligation and go home and read. Kept me from slipping many times.<br /><br />Another great resource is having/finding some friends that don&#039;t like to get wasted. It can be hard (was for me, my entire social circle was looped out all the time), but eventually I got really close with some people that were fun and operated in moderation and respected my choices. <br /><br />Final point of my diatribe, I had several things (locations, moods, activities) that I found were &quot;triggers&quot; that would make me want very much to indulge in something or other- I found that simply being aware of those triggers allowed me to navigate sticky situations with a minimum of discomfort.<br /><br />Sorry if I sound preachy, feel free to send me a PM if you&#039;d like.<br /><br />

				Trundle, I liked your post very much.&nbsp; I do drink, but am a real lightweight; more often than not, half a bottle of beer will make me feel a little loopy.&nbsp; It helps to eat with the alcohol.&nbsp; And drink slowly.&nbsp; I will often ask when ordering a cocktail to go easy on the alcohol.&nbsp; I&#039;m happy to go somewhere with people and drink something non-alcoholic, too.&nbsp; I liked your comment about tipping well; I&#039;ll have to remember that when I&#039;m wanting to socialize but not drink at a bar.&nbsp; Cranberry and seltzer is my fave non-alcoholic drink.&nbsp; I have plans to ask for a virgin Seabreeze soon (been watching a lot of <em>Angel</em> these days, so the drink is on my mind).

				Yay Spock!<br /><br />I have found that if I tip almost 100% on the first drink, I get the following ones much more quickly. Unless the virgin drink is bonkers to make (ingredients wise), they can knock it out quick and easy.

				Clic (Break) is where I shoot. I am there most nights from about 6-7:30. Pretty good tables.
