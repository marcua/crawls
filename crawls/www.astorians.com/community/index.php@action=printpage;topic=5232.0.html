				McGowan is going to be with them?&nbsp; That&#39;s tempting, even though I hate hate hate hate hate the Roseland.<br /><br />Pogues were one of the scariest shows I ever went to in the &#39;80s.&nbsp; It was at City Gardens, a hardcore punk club in Trenton.&nbsp; A lot of the people there seemed to think Crass or something was playing there--they were jumping around, bodyslamming people, rough.&nbsp; The Pogues were good, though.&nbsp; McGowan either wasn&#39;t very drunk or held his liquor very well.&nbsp; I&#39;ve seen Robert Pollard be a lot drunker than Shane was.

				Huge fan here! Saw Shane McGowan and the Popes at the Fleah a few years back. Shane was a bit of a drunken mess (surprise,surprise) but it was still a lot of fun. <br />Shane McGowan has been known to hang out at the Rover- though I would keep my eyes out for him at the Quays as he is good buddies with one of the owners. Definately keep us posted if you got to the show.<br /><br />

				&nbsp;:mrgreen: They&#39;re really terrific in concert ... saw them <em>way-back-when</em> at the Beacon. It was extra special &#39;cause Shane McGowan was in rehab so Joe Strummer was frontman ...&nbsp; (<em>poor Joe</em> ...&nbsp; :cry:)<br /><br />It is too bad the tix are so expensive. I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d pay $54 to see them (got in free the last time ...)<br /><br /><br />-------------<br /><br />&nbsp;(Strummer was the lead singer of what band Josh?? <em>shhh</em> ... no helping him JD&nbsp; :wink:)

				I bought tix to the St. Patty&#39;s Day show the day they went on sale.&nbsp; I think it&#39;s already sold out though.<br /><br />Totally worth the money -- saw them last St. Patty&#39;s Day and it was such an amazing show.&nbsp; I might be biased since they have been my favorite band for the past 20 years and to see them with Shane MacGowan was one of my lifelong dreams.<br /><br />Last year, Shane looked and sounded great.&nbsp; I had seen him solo a few years before and he fell on stage and had to be picked up and was just in overall terrible shape.<br /><br />If there are still tix available, you all should definitely go!
