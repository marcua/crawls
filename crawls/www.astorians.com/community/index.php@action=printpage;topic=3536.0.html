				We tend to have sporatic poker nights at my place, but actually rather frequently... we (my roommate and I) have a very nice set of chips and cards, enough for about 5 people with $5-$10 buy-ins. We&#39;ve had a few successful nights, and the money&#39;s been spread around a fair-share- meaning lady luck favors none in our realm, amateur or not. However, we like to mix up the games a bit- usually start with a good &#39;round the table or three of five card draw, then we leave it up to the dealer to call the game. This ranges from Hold &#39;Em, to Seven Card Stud, to Queens and Low-Hole Roll Your Own... <br /><br />So we&#39;ll be playing at least bi-weekly here no matter what... if you want to join in on a game or two, just message me and let me know when you&#39;re available.<br /><br />The next game will most likely be this Sunday (the 21st), earlier on in the evening. Say about 7pm.
