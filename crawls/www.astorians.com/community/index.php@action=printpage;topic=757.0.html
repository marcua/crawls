				Is this possible? I walked by the KFC by the Ditmars stop tonight and there were a couple paper signs taped to the front saying &quot;CLOSED LOST OUR LEASE.&quot; This doesn't make me sad as I don't think I've ever been interested in ordering from KFC, but it surprises me as it's one of those big restaurant chain things that seems invincible.

				That place always seemed to be doing OK every time I walked past it. Maybe the landlord upped the rent so that the franchisee (who is ultimately responsible for the business, not the corporate parent) couldn't pay the rent.<br /><br />Or maybe they lost it due to health code vios. I don't know if that's possible.<br /><br />More importantly, what's going to take it's place? My guess another food establishment of some kind since the property is obviously already outfitted for it. I'd like to see a really good Lebanese pita place like the one on 30th Ave across from the Astoria Hospital.<br /><br />What do others here think should take KFC's place?

				A number of us have been wanting a good cheese shop to open. &nbsp;That would be nice. &nbsp;However, I went into Rosario's a couple days ago and walked out with a wonderful bag of fresh mozzarella and a good aged parm. &nbsp;The mozz tastes <em>amazing</em> with my CSA tomatoes and basil. &nbsp;It looked like they had a number of other good cheeses, and the guy I talked to (Rosario?) said I could taste any of the cheeses they have, which is cool. I'll be visiting them more often. &nbsp;A big shout-out to lanseaux, who recommended this place originally.<br /><br />That all being said, I'd still like a dedicated cheese shop to open up locally.

				I would love some kind of takeout place that's open past midnight to go there. Sorely needed in the neighborhood. I'm surprised there aren't any of these around there already, seeing as that a lot of people take the train to Ditmars at all times of the night. I imagine many of them would be thrilled to be able to just walk into a little hole in the wall and order a gyro or salad or something to go. Dunkin Donuts just doesn't do it for me when I'm looking for real food, and I don't want to sit alone at Mike's at 2am.
