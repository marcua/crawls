				Does anyone know where I can cash in my big grape juice bottle of assorted change? &nbsp;Back in Oklahoma, Albertson's had a machine you could dump your change into. &nbsp;It would sort it, count it, and give you a receipt to present for cash. &nbsp;I'm desperately broke and this is definitely the time to cash in my pennies, nickles and dimes. &nbsp;Help?

				Commerce Bank on the corner of Ditmars and 31st has a machine called &quot;Penny Arcade&quot;. Not sure if you can just go in there and do it if you don't have an account, but you can always ask.

				No problem! :)<br /><br />BTW - They are a good bank just in case you would need to sign up before you be able to use the machine. :)

				I think anyone can use it even if you don't have an account there. They always come over to me to make sure I know how to use it but they never ask me if I have an account there. Once the machine is done just take the receipt to the counter and ask them for cash and that's it. <br /><br />Also, they rock as a bank. The average American works until 5 pm Mon through Friday, the average bank opens until 3 or 4 pm Mon through Friday. This bank takes that into consideration and is open until 8 during the week and open on Saturday AND Sunday. Now that's some bank. :D <br /><br />Plus they have everything else that you come to expect from a good bank, Free Checking (They even give you your first set of checks FREE), Online banking, visa debit card, etc. <br /><br />I used to get charged $60 a month in fees from Chase and Citi wasn't much better. Smaller banks like Rosalyn Bank, that I don't think is open anymore, didn't work either. My Debit card would work only half the time leaving me stranded in the city once because I had no cash on my to buy a metro card and also Hubby and I went out to dinner and our card was denied even though we had the money in the bank leaving for a very embarrassing scene in the restaurant. I have never had any problems like this with Commerce and I get charged nothing for having my money in a Commerce bank checking account. I LOVE COMMERCE BANK!

				What is also nice about Commerce is that they refund you ATM fees up to $5 a month that other bank ATMs charge you. That is one thing that I really appreciate, since I am not always close to a Commerce.

				They also give you $10 free just for opening an account provided you get a referral from an existing customer.<br /><br />Any one of us in this forum would be happy to do that for you since we get $10 too from the bank. :)
