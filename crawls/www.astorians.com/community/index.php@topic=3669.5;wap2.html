			I ran into Marcel Van Ooyen of the Council on the Environment and they are very interested in moving the greenmarket to Athens Square Park, but have had a negative reception from both the Community Board and the 30th Avenue business organization.&nbsp; He did seem interested in talking about it.&nbsp; Would folks be up for a meeting with him and his staff?

			I&#039;d be happy to.&nbsp; Might even have some vendor connections.

			How big is Athens Square Park?&nbsp; What is it about the site that is attractive?&nbsp; I can&#039;t place it in my mind for some reason...

			It is about two blocks away from the 30th Ave train station - if I remember correctly it is across the street from the Astoria Federal Savings Bank and diagonally across from the Trade Fair. It isn&#039;t an overly large park, but it does get a lot of visitors- especially in the summer when they have events. <br /><br />

			How about Astoria Park -- there&#039;s a parking lot!<br />
