				Hmm, shishkabob from a vendor card? &nbsp;standing in the snow on the sidewalk eating hot lamb with your fingers? &nbsp;actually, that&#39;s not tacky - just earthy.<br /><br />Tacky would be microwaved tv dinners. &nbsp;<br /><br />Other &quot;easy&quot; options:<br /><br />- Pita Hot (near 30th and Crescent)<br />- burgers at Cups<br />- diner food<br />- Uncle George&#39;s<br /><br />interesting in hearing the rest of the story...

				Not tacky, but easy and fun:<br /><br />Kabab Cafe, of course!&nbsp; Then a trip to Laziza afterwards.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also like the street food idea.<br /><br />On the tacky side of things, perhaps the evening could include a visit to Maric Lanes on the edge of Astoria.

				If you want tacky, I would totally go to Rizzo&#39;s Italian Village on 31st Ave and 21st Street.<br /><br />easy casual fun, maybe Los Portales on Bway for tacos? <br />or go to the bar side of Brick and order devilled eggs from the bar menu.

				I think it&#39;s called &quot;The Family Corner Place&quot; on the corner of 31st St and 21st Ave. Really good falafel and Greek salad, but ... err ... the &quot;ambiance&quot; is a little lacking.

				Thank you all for the great input.<br /><br />The plan was to go somewhere easy and fun for dinner and the bowling on 19th ave. Supposed to be a tacky fun low key valentines date.&nbsp; Had to cancel though.<br /><br />My wife was exhausted so we all went to Sabor tropical instead.&nbsp; the tacky date is now on hold and i think a bunch of us should do it as a group.&nbsp; maybe even burgers and beer at the bowling alley.<br /><br />Now back to Sabor, Michael the owner and friend of mine, took great care of us.&nbsp; Even snuck us over some treats from his churrascaria a few doors down.&nbsp; drinks were very good and our meals were excellent.&nbsp; Live music too.<br /><br />thanks agian for all the help.

				Hi Jonathan<br />Its not tacky and its only a little casual, but I wanted to tell you about our Valentine&#39;s Day dinner date at Lil Bistro 33!! It was upon your esteemed recommendation that we try it, so what better evening than when they&#39;re offering an innovative tasting menu? Well I must tell you it was super-sweet kickass and sumptuous and great all around. Thanks for the tip! Despite the overwhelmed wait staff (they only had two servers and people were knocking down the doors) the food was served promptly and without fault. The tasting menu was exemplary, with their fried goat cheese the stuff dreams are made of! Their sushi course was strong and the dessert, while not heart-stopping, was comforting and solid (puff pastry square, chocolate-BATHED strawberry). The wine pairings were also inspired but not pretentious. Thanks for turning us on to such a neighborhood prize (secretive as it is-- in the daytime you wouldn&#39;t even know they were there!)<br /><br />cheers<br />annie
