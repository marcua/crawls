				Yeah, I know. There&#39;s no such thing as free parking. You&#39;re always bound to get a ticket here and there.<br /><br />I&#39;m currently fighting two previous ones, but today I got one that might be a bit harder to argue: Parked on Ditmars right across from FreezePeach today. Hell, it&#39;s a holiday, no need to feed the meter. I know this &#39;cause I checked the internet and confirmed that it&#39;s a national holiday therefore meters are suspended. Cool beans.<br /><br />Two hours later, there&#39;s a ticket on the windshield. Guess b/c it&#39;s &quot;Sunday included&quot; means &quot;holidays included&quot; as well?! Damn. I&#39;ve gotta double-check the website.<br /><br />Oh well. I always figure around a hundred dollars a year is just the cost of parking from tickets. Stupid me for being too excited about saving a couple of quarters.

				It could have easily been a mistake/error - maybe a new, inexperienced person was out today writing tickets.&nbsp; Usually federal holidays are included in meter suspension.&nbsp; Definitley check the website, but appeal it anyway, as you had honest intentions in the situation (you weren&#39;t trying to avoid paying for any other reason that it was a federal holiday).&nbsp; For sure appeal!&nbsp; Appeal, appeal, appeal!&nbsp; I used to work as a Hearing Officer and I read all sorts of parking ticket appeals.&nbsp; If it were me, I would dismiss the ticket.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, first thing to do is <strong>always check the ticket to see if an error was made</strong> on the part of the issuing officer.&nbsp; If there is, then the ticket is immediately void.<br /><br />Good luck, Christine!<br /><br />

				I&#39;m very happy that I&#39;m now working in the city, not CT, and could sell my car! The amount of anxiety that thing caused was just incredible. This said, the only ticket I managed to get for the year I had a car was for parking too close to a hydrant. A cop was walking by when I was parking, and I asked if he thought it was too close. He said he didn&#39;t think so. I parked there, and got a ticket. Fortunately, they wrote my license plate down wrong (&quot;CO&quot; is not the two-letter abbreviation for Connecticut!), so it was invalid and I didn&#39;t pay it. I found out later about the 15&#39; requirement, and it was definitely more like 10&#39; from the hydrant, so in some karmic sense I deserved the ticket...<br /><br />About today, all I know is that NPR was saying this morning &quot;alternate side regulations are suspended today, but you still have to feed the meter.&quot; I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s constitutional or not, but I guess that&#39;s the city line... Best of luck fighting it!&nbsp; :|

				You wont be able to fight todays ticket. I called 311 today and acording to 311 there is no mail today and alternate side parking was suspendid however they stated that you would still have to pay the meter and garbage and recycling would still be collected still. Maybe from now on when in doubt you should call them and listen to the message at the begining.

				It seems that there are only 7 days all year that meter rules are suspended.&nbsp; But there are a million days that alternative parking is suspended.&nbsp; I was interested to find the list and figure out what all those holidays are.&nbsp; (I always wonder.)<br /><br />I was confused about how yesterday worked as a holiday, too.&nbsp; I was surprised to learn that garbage was picked up.&nbsp; <br /><br />311 is invaluable!

				You know what I did wrong? I Googled &quot;NYC parking holiday&quot; and up came the description of the websites, including:<br /><br /><em>NYCDOT - Alternate Side Parking CalendarParking meter regulations will be suspended on major legal holidays....</em><br /><br />I was like, allright! Then looked at it again after getting the ticket. Actually, it says:<br /><br /><em>On major legal holidays, No Stopping, No Standing, and No Parking regulations are suspended, except where those regulations are normally in effect 7 days a week.</em><br /><br />Crappity crap CRAP. :x The sign does say &quot;Sundays included&quot; so it falls under the exception.<br /><br />I&#39;ll look it over for technicalities anyway!
