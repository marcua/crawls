				Rev. Billy and the Church of Stop-Shopping Gospel Choir<br /><br />perform<br /><br />A Funeral for the trees of the Remsen house<br />Saturday, March 12, 2:00 pm<br />27th Ave. and 12th Street, Astoria<br /><br />The Abraham Remsen home (built 1835) and its vast lot covered with ancient trees, was a source of pride for the neighborhood and a beautiful oasis in a city rapidly losing its historic buildings and green spaces. Before the landmark process could be finalized, Hack Construction Co. came in and tore the house down and ripped out every tree on the lot, to be replaced by 9 3-family condos.<br /><br />Come mourn the loss with us.<br /><br />Directions: Take the N or W train to Queens, get off at Astoria Blvd. - 15 mins. from Manhattan. Walk down Astoria Blvd toward Manhattan (in the opposite direction of the Burger King. The subway stop is at 31st St. and Astoria Blvd. Make sure you're on Astoria Blvd., not Hoyt Ave. and walk toward 21st St.) At 21st St. you'll see a white flatiron-style building. Cross 21st St. and stay to the right of the white building. Now you're on 27th Ave. Walk about 3 more blocks to corner of 12th. St. It's about a 10 minute walk.

				hey! this seems like an interesting event... i've seen advertisements for the Rev Billy and his varous demonstrations/protests and i have not been able to go.<br /><br />this is ironic. i am able to go to this event, and it is directly before our community garden planning meeting at the freeze peach....<br /><br />do you have more contact information on this person/organization?<br /><br />shame less plug: after going to the funeral for trees, come to a hopeful and optimistic meeting to plan a new community garden in Astoria at 3pm at the Freeze Peach on March 12, 2005<br /><br />thanks!<br />Rosemary

				hi rosemary!!<br /><br />i told savitri the director of the choir about your meeting, in case they can get up there. &nbsp;<br /><br />unfortunately i just learned that a lot of the choir cannot be there. &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;:cry: <br /><br />its a shame because the shows are so DAMN good!!! &nbsp; they are every last wednesday of the month at st. marks church , 2nd ave and 10th street. &nbsp;<br />i would highly recommend it for some great fun and laughter and also some serious preaching about the evils of gw bush , sweatshops, paramilitary troops in latin america and such. &nbsp;somehow it all comes together. &nbsp;<br /><br />damn i cant even be there tomorrow i am getting on a flight for bulgaria<br /><br />&nbsp;:shock: <br /><br />i am sorry to miss everything!!!!!!!!!!
