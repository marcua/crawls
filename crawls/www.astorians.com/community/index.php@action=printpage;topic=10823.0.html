				Well, I did elaborate, but it got lost in the either when I was typing... :-o<br /><br />Let me be the first to blow my own horn here...<br /><br />VAMPIRE LESBIANS OF SODOM &amp; SLEEPING BEAUTY or COMA. June 18-29 at the Secret Theatre, Long Island City Arts Center, 44-02 23rd St. (right under the 7 tracks near the Citibank Building). <br /><br />I&#039;m DAMNED proud of this production. It was done in April and sold out it&#039;s run and we&#039;re bringing it back in a modified 3/4 round format. The show is Great fun, if you don&#039;t know it. The original production became the longest off-Broadway play (and held the record for quite awhile) and launched the career of the life force that is Charles Busch (TALE OF THE ALERGISTS WIFE, PSYCHO BEACH PARTY, DIE, MOMMIE, DIE!.)<br /><br />It features a cast of 7 in multiple roles, 39 flashy costumes, and one of the best 5 casts I&#039;ve EVER worked with. I did a production in Provincetown 15 years ago that ran 2 summers...this one is miles better. Charles Busch actually had some contact with the cast and loaned us the original &quot;virgin sacrifice&quot; wig (if you know the show, you know that&#039;s actually a big deal). The audience reaction and feedback was amazing. If nothing else, I&#039;ll gurantee that you will laugh.<br /><br />You can get show info at www.secrettheatre.com or direct tickets at http://www.theatermania.com/content/show.cfm/show/144311<br /><br />If you saw the first one, please post a note!<br /><br />Oh, yes! 4 of the company are Astorian nabies!

				Here are the ones I know about:<br /><br />The Secret Theatre/Queens Players&nbsp; &nbsp; www.secrettheatre.org<br />Near Citicorp, it&#039;s where my group, nyYOURep is in residence, reviving VAMPIRE LESBIANS OF SODOM (see above). The resident group does good stuff, too.<br /><br />The Chocolate Factory&nbsp; &nbsp; http://www.chocolatefactorytheater.org/home.html<br />They already have a good reputation and press.<br /><br />Astoria Performing Arts Center www.apacny.org<br />I saw some good stuff (Forever Plaid) in their old space, but understand they have a nice new one now that I haven&#039;t seen.<br /><br />

				GBS IN LIC<br />Auditions for Shaw&#039;s MRS. WARREN&#039;S PROFESSION opening 9/11/08 with the Queens Players at The Secret Theatre in LIC will be on July 21 &amp; 22. This is one of those great little theatres that are so hot in the nabe now.<br /><br />There are roles for 4 men &amp; 2 women.<br /><br />Directed by Ken Hailey<br /><br />Information on the play and a link to the full script are available:&nbsp; &nbsp;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs._Warren%27s_Profession<br /><br />It&#039;s a 105 year-old play that you would swear was written last week...full of the wit that Shaw&#039;s plays are known for. It tackles some pretty spiky issues, too.<br /><br />Requests for audition slots should be e-mailed to info@secrettheatre.com

				With this group, it varies show-to-show...<br /><br />In this particular case it&#039;s not an Equity showcase:<br /><br />a) where casting requires men (particularly) and women of a certain age, then my experience is that we get a better selection drawing from the higher educational community, then are able to get reviewers by running the three weeks that are requred to get reviews out here. If you&#039;re not Equity, though, there is a good group of agencies who do go to the work from this company. It already has a reputation and following.<br /><br />The sister-company, nyYOURep, uses showcase code when one of the resident company is Equity (as will be the case with the upcoming Charles Busch show, OUR LEADING LADY.

				Ok, kids...I just want to give you folks a heads up. I&#039;ve been directing MRS. WARREN&#039;S PROFESSION with Queens Players/Secret Theatre (44-02 23rd St.).<br /><br />There&#039;s this girl...Savannah<br />Her dad&#039;s the artistic director so, in the name of avoiding nepotism, she never gets cast. She just graduated from Frank Sinatra school and is AMAZING! She just gives a breathtaking performance that will blow you away...you will be hearing from this girl, so check this one out. <br /><br />The rest of the cast is great as well. If you don&#039;t know the play, you should. George Bernard Shaw is just great smart fun, and this is one of his best...a really great blend of comedy and drama.<br /><br />It opens Wednesday (the 10th) and runs weekends for the rest of the month.<br /><br />
