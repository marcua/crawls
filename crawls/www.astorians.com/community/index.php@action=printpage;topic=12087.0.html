				At the last mixer, which took place at Rest-au-Rant, there was a lot of interest in having the next mixer at Broadway Station. So here goes!<br /><br />How about next Wednesday, Sept 10, 7.30 at Broadway Station (on Broadway - next to the station). <br /><br />Singles, non-singles, and single-but-not-lookings are all welcome and encouraged to attend.

				Actually, I went for midweek because I figure any place we chose is likely to be incredibly crowded on a Friday night and we will have trouble finding each other. <br /><br />Also, my Friday nights are booked up .... <br /><br />But if you come next Wed I&#039;ll buy you a beer and we can argue over the merits of the different nights of the week :) <br />

				It will catch on, I will spread the word. Are you posting the mixer on whyleaveastoria.com and the meet up group<br />why leave Astoria. It would be good if you can get people from that site and meet up, I bet the turn out would be awesome.<br />I am kind of a networker so if you need help with posting on both sites, just let me know.

				Yeah, I&#039;d say it&#039;s slightly better quality pub food than you get at your average place.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had their Blue Burger (charbroil burger with blue cheese - YUM!), boneless buffalo wings (pretty good but could have been a little spicier), jalapeno poppers (Warning: they advertise them as cheddar cheese poppers, but they are clearly cream cheese poppers.&nbsp; The kitchen tried telling us that they were &quot;white&quot; cheddar cheese.&nbsp; &nbsp;:roll: ) and the french onion soup (not the best I&#039;ve had, but pretty decent).

				Hey Cat! Modified your headline to more prominently announce your mixer.&nbsp; Hope it&#039;s a great event.<br /><br />I may be leaning more towards no since I am working on a project at work which kept me in the office until midnight last night.&nbsp; Hopefully tonight, will not be a repeat but you never know.&nbsp; Hope I can make it.<br /><br />Have fun all.
