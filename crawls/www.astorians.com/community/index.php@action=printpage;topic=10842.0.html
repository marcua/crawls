				Well, folks, our landlords are at it again. <br /><br />After 1.5 years in a small 2 family home, the owners told us they&#039;re raising the rent by $100 per month in anticipation of &quot;high cost of oil&quot;. <br /><br />Can anyone weigh in on the current rate for a 2br apartment around Ditmars these days? I want to know if we&#039;re getting shafted or not.<br /><br />Unfortunately, www.rentometer.com places $1750 as the median rent for our area. Also, a neighbor told us he&#039;s renting an apartment all the way up on 21st Ave &amp; 80th Street for the same amount...seems like a lot for a remote location, which makes our new rent not seem so bad.<br /><br />Some background: We moved there in April 2007 for $1550 per month. They upped it to $1600 in September, and in lieu of a lease, which they refused to give us, we asked them to sign a document promising not to raise the rent for a 1 year period. So now they tell us they&#039;re raising it to $1700 per month this September. It seems to me a 10% increase in less than 2 years is a little excessive. But I know, I know, that&#039;s the risk you take when you don&#039;t live in a stabilized building.<br /><br />

A one bedroom, possibly. A two bedroom? You&#039;ll be lucky to find a two bedroom for less than 2 grand in the Ditmars area. There were two that were rented out on 38th Street between 23rd Ave and Ditmars in the past month. One rented for 2100 and the other went for 2450. That is the norm rather than the exception. 3 family homes BTW, not apartment buildings.

				I&#039;m on 23rd ave and 33rd street.&nbsp; We just moved in in May and we&#039;re paying 1600 for 2 bedroom. <br />This makes me nervous though! I really hope they don&#039;t raise our rent by THAT much at the end of the year... Getting priced out of this neighborhood would really suck. =(<br /><br />I definitely thought the Ditmars area was cheaper than lower Astoria, at least that&#039;s what I was told when I was apartment hunting.&nbsp; Is there any truth to that?

				I always thought it was the other way around, Ditmars being more of a neighborhood feel and slightly larger spaces, so it was more expensive.&nbsp; I could be wrong though.&nbsp; I wonder if it&#039;s changed over time.&nbsp; I know when I rented my place almost 15 years ago, Broadway was cheaper than Ditmars.

				You&#039;re correct mcdirk. Although lately it has been pretty much been even in price both in the Ditmars area and lower Astoria, although judging from the prices I have seen on craigslist and the NYTimes Ditmars asking prices are shooting back up again after a slight lull the last 18 months. Maybe it&#039;s all the development.

				I always wonder how the new development is going to affect prices.&nbsp; I would think logically, more units would mean the prices would stay the same or go down, but the new places seem to bring new and wealthier people to the neighborhood and gentrify it making costs even for less desirable places go up.&nbsp; I&#039;m shocked when I hear how much one bedrooms are going for in my building.&nbsp; I just wish some affordable housing stock would get created - all these rising prices are having some negative effects on the neighborhood.&nbsp; Some of the stuff I see being built is just hideous, or the location is crazy.&nbsp; Who really wants to live at Queensborough Plaza, and who is willing to spend that kind of money to live there, it&#039;s just insane.&nbsp; Anyone seen that new 20 something story tower rising at 31st Avenue and Newtown?&nbsp; Is that a hotel or residential?&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen so many soft development sites over along the water that I&#039;m shocked.&nbsp; It looks like at least 8 new big buildings are going up.&nbsp;

				I totally agree with you about the affordable housing. I mean weren&#039;t we promised it 3 years ago? By Bloomie and Vallone? I actually like View 59, from the outside at least, though the website leaves something to be desired. But yes, living there would be a living hell. I mean, being a pedestrian is difficult enough when down there, or driving in a car, but actually looking out a window of my living room?? UGH! Plus, there are no actual neighborhood type places, like restaurants, supermarkets, delis, etc. to speak of. Unless they&#039;re all going to order from Freshdirect ( no offense to those who do). <br /><br />&nbsp;Which building are you speaking of? The one towering over Socrates? I don&#039;t recall the one you&#039;re referring to. But yes, a huge needle in the sky, like a giant sundial towering over the smaller houses....

				Which one is View 59?<br /><br />I&#039;m talking about the one close to, but not exactly towering over Socraties - it&#039;s at least a building or two removed from the Park.&nbsp; It really sticks out.&nbsp; I wonder how they assembled the air rights to build it, though maybe we should get a look at the underlying zoning as other big buildings appear to be on the way.

				Yes that&#039;s the one I know of. Last summer it you couldn&#039;t even see it from Socrates. Now IT&#039;S TALL. View 59 is the white clad building on the corner of Crescent and Queenboro Plaza.

				One of the main reasons we&#039;re willing to stand for this $100 increase is that we actually have the whole house to ourselves. We only occupy the 2nd floor apartment, but the landlords leave the bottom floor apartment empty. Supposedly so they have a place to stay when they come into the city. That&#039;s happened twice, and the apartment is completely unfurnished....so who knows what&#039;s up with that. But I&#039;m not looking a gift horse in the mouth. <br /><br />We&#039;re going to try to negotiate some kind of mercy from them. Maybe they&#039;ll let us store stuff in the basement, or something like that. It&#039;s ridiculous that 1/2 of the house is going completly to waste, with us crammed into the tiny upper apartment &amp; facing an unreasonable 10%&nbsp; increase.<br /><br />An extra $1200 per year is significantly less than we&#039;d pay to a broker if we moved. And we&#039;d never find a place with this much privacy AND a backyard/garden that we don&#039;t have to share with anyone. <br />

				I don&#039;t know if this is true locally, but I just read in the NYTimes that the cost of rentals are shooting up nationally. Less people are able to buy with the current mortgage/lending/falling home prices mess. Combine that with the crap economy and a lot of people who used to own are having to move back into rental situations. <br /><br />Makes me feel incredibly lucky to have my little apartment.

				I am closer to the Astoria BLVD stop.&nbsp; We have a 3 bedroom and pay around 1800 for the three of us (split according to room size).&nbsp; I think it helps that I have lived here for four years.&nbsp; They treat me like family and let me take over the yard to garden in (actually call me their &quot;personal gardener&quot; now, which I love!).&nbsp; <br />I love looking just to see, different places and what they are going for in the area.&nbsp; When I moved here 4 years ago I thought 800 for a basement studio was outrageous.&nbsp; Now I see that they are going for 1200-1400!!&nbsp; Even if my bf and I wanted to get a place of our own, we would not be able to afford to stay in the area. =(&nbsp; And we love it here!!

				On Crescent and 36th, a ground floor 1 bedroom fully renovated is going for $1800. A block behind that, just across the street from the Ravenswood projects the landlord has rented 2 apartments at $2000 each. These are also one bedrooms. Across from the projects!!! <br /><br />Who are these big city bums that are paying those prices? Why are they making it so miserable for the rest of us? No wonder our landlord wants our apartment back, &quot;for personal use&quot;. Its a nice 2 bdrm for $1600. I&#039;m sure the neighbor landlords are talking to eachother. <br /><br />Where to, next?

				This is taken from the NYC Rent Guidelines Board website:<br /><br />http://www.housingnyc.com/html/resources/faq/rents.html#sure<br /><br />&quot;If you find that your apartment is not rent stabilized, there is no limit on the rent increase that can be charged at the end of your lease. If you have no lease, you are considered a &quot;month-to-month&quot; tenant. According to the NYS Attorney General&#039;s Office, a New York City landlord may raise the rent of a month-to-month tenant with the consent of the tenant. However, if the tenant does not consent, the landlord can terminate the tenancy by giving appropriate notice (Real Property Law ß232-b). You may wish to read further on this issue by visiting the New York State Attorney General&#039;s Tenant&#039;s Rights Guide regarding Month-to-Month tenancy here.&quot;<br /><br />Also, since 2003, the landlord can increase the rent to the &quot;legal&quot; amount, as opposed to the normal rent increases when the lease is up.&nbsp; This rent is written on the lease and also listed with the City,That actually happened to me about a year and a half ago.&nbsp; Oh well, at least I was able to live for almost 6 years in a one bedroom that was $300 below the legal amount.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard that my same apartment is now renting for $1,600 a month and has somehow been made into a 2 bedroom.<br /><br />&quot;Are stabilized increases based on the legal or preferential rent?<br /><br />Under rent regulations amended in June, 2003, existing tenants who pay a &quot;preferential rent&quot; (meaning that the owner initially agreed to an amount lower than the legal rent) may not be entitled to renewal increases based upon the preferential rent amount. For instance, if the legal rent is $1,200 but the landlord charges $1,000, any increase may be based on the legal rent of $1,200. Thus, if the tenant chooses a one-year lease renewal and the guideline increase is 4.5% for a one year lease, the tenant in this example may face a maximum increase of $254, raising the maximum rent to $1,254.<br /><br />In April, 2008, DHCR updated the procedure for determining whether preferential rents have to be charged for the remainder of the lease term. Please read this fact sheet on preferential rents.<br /><br />The only way you can ascertain the legal rent is to call the Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR), the state agency that administers the rent laws, at (718) 739-6400, or (212) 961-8930, and ask for a determination or a review of their records on the apartment in question.&quot;

				Hmmm, then I guess it&#039;s better to get a rent-stabilized apartment then.&nbsp; <br /><br />I still think increasing the rent $100 PER MONTH is downright disastrous, especially when it&#039;s based on a PRESUMPTION of &quot;rising oil prices.&quot;&nbsp; If I was in their position, I&#039;d not only keep up on the price of oil weekly and compare it to how it figures into the rent (letting the landlord know about this), but I&#039;d also sue them for emotional distress/unlawful economic burden.<br /><br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; To those brokers who happen to be reading my posts, I have excellent credit and keep up on my payments to the T.&nbsp; However, I am a BITCH about policy, and I dissect all rent/lease terms so that everything is laid out on the table.

				Also, I&#039;ve looked at the policy statement above:&nbsp; &quot;there is no limit on the rent increase that can be charged at the end of your lease.&quot;<br /><br />Now what if it&#039;s a one-year lease that&#039;s renewable?&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t it have to be the same lease as the one you originally signed?&nbsp; And shouldn&#039;t there be a stipulation in the renewal lease about rent increases???&nbsp; If not, that&#039;s signing your death warrant....it should specify something about increases.

				Well, the going rate is going up by the minute. We tried to rent a two-bedroom apt this week and were squeezed out because there was a bidding war and the apartment went for higher than the posted price! I swear that today&#039;s listings on Craigslist are higher than they were yesterday! Dear lord, am I going to have to go live in Buffalo?!!!!

				PD9 if someone allows you to live in their 2 or 3 family house and u dont sign a lease for lets say a year or 6 months or 2 years whatever , when that lease is up , they can raise the rent if their choose so . I know alot of landlords that raise the rent simplu cuz they dont like their tenants and want them to leave . Ofcourse oil prices have skyrocketted&nbsp; so im sure they can use that excuse if they want to . Month to month leases are exactly that , if either or chooses they can leave after a month is over . Suing isn gonna do any good unless the lease states that the landlord promises not to raise the rent for a certain time . <br />Remember as a renter you have the right not to sign anything you dont like or live anywhere you dont like . Once you do then u agree to those terms in the lease .
