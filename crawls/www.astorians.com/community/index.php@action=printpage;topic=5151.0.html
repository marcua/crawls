				Hi there -- I&#39;m new to the board, and just introduced myself over in the general chat area.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)<br /><br />I&#39;m planning to get a dog soon, but want to find a good vet first and also learn if there&#39;s a dog run in Astoria.&nbsp; If you have any recomendations or tips on owning a dog in this area, please share!&nbsp; Thanks in advance.

				Don&#39;t know about the local vets, but there&#39;s a dog run on the corner of Hoyt Ave. South and Shore Blvd.<br /><br />The most important thing about being a dog owner around here: <em>Pick up the poop!!!!</em>&nbsp; :x<br /><br />This has been a friendly neighborhood service announcement.&nbsp; :-)<br />

				Welcome EAY_07! This isn&#39;t at all helpful to you, but I just wanted to say how GLAD I am that you&#39;re investigating these things prior to getting a dog, versus after. Too many people bring the dog home, then look into the ins and outs of having one.<br /><br />And even further off-topic - Christine, I LOVE your quote. One of my favorite movies. &quot;But where in New York can one find a woman with grace, elegance, taste and culture? A woman suitable for a king?&quot; &quot;Queens!&quot;

				I like the Steinway Court Vet, recommended to me by a friend with a very ill cat (ie: she&#39;s there pretty much every week for the past two years due to ongoing conditions). Dog runs, I&#39;m no help with! sorry.

				Great:<br /><br />Dr Smith @ Astoria Vet Group<br />2354 Steinway St Ste 1<br />Long Island City, NY 11105-1970<br />(718) 777-0100 <br /><br /><br /><br />Emergency (evenings, weekends, holidays):<br /><br />Elmhurst Emergency Clinic&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />87-06 Queens Blvd., Elmhurst&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />(718) 426-4444<br /><br />Recently used them (in the middle of the night) and emergency service is good stuff but no substitute for a visit to the regular vet.&nbsp; They were pleasant to deal with and attended to beast quickly.&nbsp; Treated problems for the short term (overnight) to give regular vet all long term treatment options.<br /><br />(Beast also much improved after Dr. Smith treatment.)<br /><br />

				I would also recommend the Steinway Court Vet.&nbsp; I have a cat that has a host of medical issues (including diabetes, cataracts, a chronic bladder condition and a bacterial infection that caused all his teeth to fall out!) and Dr. Glasser and the staff there have kept him alive and purring for the past 10 years.<br /><br />Their address is 32-41R Steinway Street and the phone number is 718-728-2822.&nbsp; &nbsp;
