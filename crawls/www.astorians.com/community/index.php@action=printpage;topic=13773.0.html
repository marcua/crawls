				I passed by it Friday night and it looked way bigger than before.Plenty of tables so that should help out since back in the day there were lines to get a table.I can only imagine in the summer time it will even be much more packed.Looks like Balu across the street will be in a heap of trouble now if they aren&#039;t already.Didn&#039;t check the &quot;garage&quot; part of it I wonder if it looks the same? Anybody know the prices and if the menu changed? How about the music? It used to be pretty loud I had to shout for someone to hear me and how about the service?

				I doubt Balu will be in any trouble.&nbsp; It seems that the more cafes open on 30th Avenue (or in this case, expand), the more people are drawn to the strip.&nbsp; Each cafe seems to be feeding off of the success of the other.

				Plenty of people to go around and like u said&nbsp; , in the spring /summer&nbsp; there are lines , which means plenty of business to go around . So many greek people come in from NJ, LI and Bklyn Bronx wherever for a night out in astoria .Im sure another cafe will open up soon .

				I wouldn&#039;t worry about the other cafes either.&nbsp; As a frequent cafe goer, my friends and I usually just pick a different one all the time depending on where we find seats.&nbsp; I&#039;m not Greek, but I love sitting outside with a Frappe and people watching on a beautiful summer day.&nbsp; I wish more cafes like this existed in Manhattan, but they seem to be unique to Astoria.

				Still haven&#039;t gone hopefully someone will have a review! You know you it makes sense... if what&#039;s happening on 30th spills over to Broadway that would be great since as far as cafes only Omonia exists there at the moment.

				I truly cannot wait to sit outside a sip a nice frappe, with the sun on my face.&nbsp; This winter has been long and harsh and I am so looking forward to spring!

				&nbsp; I wonder if the crowd overflow will settle for the Glen Oaks if they can&#039;t get into one of the new cafes.&nbsp; Somehow, I doubt it.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D

				ive been a few times since it opened...its nice, but they are focusing more on the restaurant than the cafe aspect. the food is not too great...i tried the pizza (better at avenue) and my friend had the skirt steak sandwich (had to be sent back because the meat was still raw) they are also making a few sushi rolls..the dragon roll is ok. not too great but edible.<br />i think they raised their prices a little too on the coffee..<br />all in all its a nice atmosphere inside, but the food needs some work
