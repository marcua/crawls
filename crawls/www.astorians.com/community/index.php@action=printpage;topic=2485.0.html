				- Any word on the waterfront in LIC by the City Lights?<br />- How is Roosevelt Island&#39;s view?<br />- Any spots in Greenpoint?<br />- How is the view from Astoria Park, or any of the other Waterfront parks?

				Was chatting with some friends who live a few blocks from Elmer Gantry Park. Mentioned how some Astorians were excluded.<br /><br />There was a dry chuckle. They claimed that long term residents from Hunters Point were excluded last year from the waterfront, too! They heard this year a fee might be charged.<br /><br />Soooo, Astorians (for those inclined) go to Roosevelt Island or roof tops for the fire works. Enjoy them before the castles for the rich (sorry, &quot;public access job creation projects&quot;) block your view permanently.<br /><br />For others, who would like to enjoy the true spirit of freedom from tyranny and flava of the holiday, may we invite you to go down to the park (or Shore Towers) and tell us of your experience on the Fourth. Get out to the piers early.<br /><br />Extra credit for pictures of security guards, chain link fences, and &#39;special passes.&#39;<br /><br />Lets write our own Declaration of Independence from developers and take back our waterfront like the rest of New York.<br /><br />Of course, if you accept our &#39;betters&#39; deciding what we should salute, sorry for the interruption. Enjoy the holiday anyway!!<br /><br />

				I was wondering if they will be visible from Astoria Park? The map they showed on NY1 TV channel looked as though the farthest North they will be set from in Manhattan is 69th St.

				My understanding is that they won&#39;t be visible from Astoria Park and that you should go to LIC, but I may be wrong.&nbsp; It seems to me that standing by the river and looking south you should be able to see something, but probably not a great view.

				No, if you&#39;re in Astoria Park, (or any of the&nbsp; Queens waterfront parks north of the 59th Street bridge) Roosevelt Island blocks your view.

				It&#39;s the same thing every year!<br /><br />Anywhere else, but NOT ON MY ROOF!<br /><br />Damned idiots stomping on that leaky thing!&nbsp; Then at the end, triggering the door alarm so that it&#39;s ringing like a banshee for 30 minutes afterwards!<br /><br />Have some respect for us top-floor residents of multi-story buildings!<br /><br />- Cannibal<br />I&#39;m gonna bite the first one down!<br /><br />
