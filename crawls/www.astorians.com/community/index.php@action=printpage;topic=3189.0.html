				Interesting. Where is this located exactly?<br /><br />Also, I&#39;m moving to the &quot;where to find __&quot; section because it&#39;s not an advertisement :)

				I&#39;m coming to report on the ebay store. IT STINKS. :ticked: They won&#39;t take anything that doesn&#39;t have the potential to get $30 bucks. I had a bunch of stuff that would have been 5, 15 or even 25 bucks and they wouldn&#39;t take it. I should have had a stoop sale. Anyway,&nbsp; I ended up putting it on the curb by my house.. Surprisingly, about five people walking by at different times took all the stuff. That was pretty sweet. I hate throwing things out. I&#39;d rather give it away to someone who is going to use it!

				That&#39;s probably how a lot of those ebay stores work - they can&#39;t make much of a profit with the cheaper items.

				What I don&#39;t get is how would they lose money with that? They buyer pays for shipping and they get a comission. I guess somewhere in there Marginal Cost &gt; Marginal Revenue.&nbsp;

				I guess it&#39;s just not worth their time if they&#39;re not making a big enough commission off the items. It&#39;s easy enough to sell the stuff yourself and not pay a commission (or just donate...)

				If you guys are selling CDs or DVDs, I&#39;ve had good luck selling used on amazon.com, and I have a friend who has done well on half.com. Its pretty easy to set up, and you get a notice saying when something sells and you mail it to the person. CDs and DVDs are under a pound, so I just stick a few 39 cent stamps on a padded envelope and throw it in the corner mailbox. I&#39;m probably losing a few cents on postage that way, but its totally worth it not to have to stand in that post office line!<br /><br />I also buy all my CDs used now too - it might take a week to get them, but you&#39;re still paying a lot less than even iTunes (which I hate), and I usually resell them after I rip them to my computer, unless its something I really want a hard copy of. I buy DVDs used too, and I guess I could make a copy and resell the original, but I like having my DVDs :)
