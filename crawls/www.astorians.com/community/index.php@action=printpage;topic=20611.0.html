				Friends are telling me the opening this Friday is something to thank Dog spelled backwards for.&nbsp; But just why?&nbsp; I&#039;m sure new Astorians from other lands with Aldi stores already in place can give us the low down.

				Do you know why people love it so much?&nbsp; It sounds to me like a Bravo, which we have on 34th.&nbsp; And I really like Bravo.

				Aldi and Trader Joe&#039;s are separate corporate entities owned by two brothers (that is, one brother owns Aldi, and the other owns TJ&#039;s).&nbsp; Whereas TJ&#039;s is viewed as selling niche and specialty house-branded items, Aldi often sells house-branded staple items in bulk.&nbsp; I think they are considered to be a no-frills, cost-cutting chain that sells decent quality items.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never been in one; this is based solely on what I&#039;ve read.<br /><br />Because they are owned by members of the same family, I think some of TJ&#039;s popularity has rubbed off on Aldi, although that&#039;s pure speculation on my part.<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trader_Joe%27s<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldi

				They&#039;re not owned by &quot;two different brothers.&quot;<br /><br />Theo and Karl Albrecht founded Aldi.&nbsp; In 1979 the Aldi brothers set up a trust to buy Trader Joe&#039;s.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

				Hey TJT, how I got a negative nod for announcing the opening of a supermarket is totally beyond me.&#160; So here&#039;s all I&#039;ll say.&#160; It&#039;s better than my friends said.&#160; It&#039;s different and better than Bravo.&#160; You Have To Go.

				There was an Aldi in my college town. It&#039;s nothing like Bravo, a lot like Trader Joe&#039;s except without the specialty market feel to it. It&#039;s basically a regular grocery store that only sells generic items. You can tell just by looking at the items what they&#039;re imitating - Triscuits, Pantene, Frosted Mini Wheats, Mountain Dew and whatever else. They also have different levels of items. Some are cheapo, and others are &quot;gourmet&quot; products that aren&#039;t really cheap, but they are generally better quality than the cheapo stuff - like all-natural ravioli or something. I&#039;m going by what I knew a few years ago, but I would be surprised if it&#039;s changed all that much aside from specific products coming and going. That and you have to pay to use their grocery bags, so it&#039;s best to bring your own bags.

				well I got a Free canvas bag (Mr. First Day, I guess)<br />But I came prepared with those Pathmark photobags.<br />Hmm the savings...<br />Pkg of 12 - 12 oz cans sodapop 1.99 plus deposit<br />a bottle garlic caesar salad dressing 16 oz 1.19<br />28 oz dish detergent 1.69 ultra anti bacterial<br />5lb bag of sugar 2.89<br />pasteurized swiss cheese food 16 slices 12 oz 1.69<br />(American was 1.49)<br />30 oz jar of Mayonnaise 1.99<br />I passed on the small jar of peanut butter 1.39 as I already have<br />but the 16 oz box of saltine crackers to go with was a bargain<br />at 79 cents<br />and the beauty is these were Everyday prices...
