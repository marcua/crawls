				This is from my good friend, Melinka, who recently finished a documentary called The Town That Was.&nbsp; It&#39;s a really interesting film about Centralia, site of an ongoing underground mine fire in Pennsylvania and the government coverup surrounding it and the families who remain.&nbsp; It is making the festival rounds.&nbsp; She is an ex Astoria resident and currently resides in Sunnyside.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure if it belongs in this category, please move as needed.&nbsp; Thanks for the support!<br /><br />Hello all,<br /><br />I have some very exciting news to report.&nbsp; The documentary I produced, The Town That Was, has received an exclusive invitation to be a part of the Viewer&#39;s Voice Competition on Cinequest Online.&nbsp; You can now watch the film at:&nbsp;<br />http://www.cinequestonline.org/2007/theater/detail_view.php?m=1319<br /><br />Even if you already have the DVD, please watch it again online and give us your vote.&nbsp; Please feel free to forward this e-mail on to friends and family who may be interested in the film and please encourage them to do the same.&nbsp;<br /><br />Unfortunately, you can only access the film through a PC.&nbsp; I am a Mac user myself so I understand how inconvenient it may be to try and get your hands on a PC if you do not own one.&nbsp; We really need your votes!&nbsp; Please, please, please try to find a PC and download and vote for the film if you are able to.&nbsp; The contest ends on February 20th so there are only a few weeks in which to vote.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In other news, we have some screenings to announce.&nbsp; The film will be screening at The Carolina Film and Video Festival and will play at the historic Carousel Cinema in Greensboro, NC at 3pm from 2/21-2/23.&nbsp; For more info:<br />http://www.carolinafilmandvideofestival.org/schedule.html<br /><br />We will also be playing at the Philadelphia Film Festival in April.&nbsp; We don&#39;t know our screening times and location yet, but for more info on the festival please go to:&nbsp;<br />http://www.phillyfests.com &lt;http://www.phillyfests.com/&gt; <br /><br />As always, www.thetownthatwas.com &lt;http://www.thetownthatwas.com/&gt;&nbsp; will have up to date news and info and we will continue to update our festival dates as we hear from others.&nbsp; Hopefully we will be at a festival in your area soon!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Thanks a million everyone in advance for your votes and support!&nbsp; &nbsp;If you&#39;re in NC or PA, I sincerely hope you can make it to a screening and get a chance to see the film on the big screen.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Melinka<br /><br />Synopsis<br /><br />In 1962, a trash fire ignited a seam of anthracite coal beneath Centralia, Pennsylvania, a once thriving mining town of over 1600 people. By the mid 1980’s, giant plumes of smoke and deadly carbon monoxide gases billowed from fissures in the ground, the local highway cracked and collapsed, trees were bleached white and petrified, as the fire continued to rage unchecked. It wasn’t until a young boy nearly died after falling into a smoldering mine subsidence that the government was pressed into action. After estimating the cost of extinguishing the fire at over a half a billion dollars, the government opted to raze the town and relocate its residents.<br /><br />Today, 11 die-hards remain.<br /><br />Filmed over a period of five years with interviews ranging from former residents to Congressmen, The Town That Was is an intimate portrait of John Lokitis, the youngest remaining Centralian, and his quixotic fight to keep alive a hometown that has literally disintegrated under his feet. His unbowed determination and steadfast refusal to acknowledge defeat reveal a man, a town, a region, and a way of life abandoned and forgotten.
