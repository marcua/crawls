				I already posed this on the Out board, but I think it&#039;s something that effects all of us.&nbsp; Astoria&#039;s strength is our diversity, so please see below and show up in support of that strength on September 7.<br /><br />Media Advisory<br /><br />FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE <br /><br /><br />PRESS CONTACT:&nbsp; Marisa Ragonese, Program Director of Generation Q <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at 718-204-5955 or MRagonese@QueensCommunityHouse.org <br /><br /><br />Astoria Residents Hold March Against Hate&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />On Sunday, September 7th at 1:00pm, several Astoria Civic Groups under the umbrella coalition, Astorians United Against Hate Crimes, will hold a March Against Hate in response to the July 7th assault on gay and transgender residents of Carmen’s Place who were targeted because of their gender and sexual orientation, as well as Reverend Louis Braxton Jr., the priest who runs Carmen’s Place, who was also attacked after his attempt to defend the youth.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br /><br />The event will begin at 1pm with a rally, featuring speakers and musicians, at Athens Park, located at 30th Avenue and 30th Street in Astoria.&nbsp; At 2:30pm, the group will begin to march down 30th Avenue to Steinway Street, ending with a moment of silence in front of Carmen’s Place, located at 31-14 Steinway Street. <br /><br /><br />Astorians United Against Hate Crimes is an ad hoc coalition that includes Generation Q of the Queens Community House, Astorians for Peace and Justice, the Long Island City Alliance, the National Lawyers Guild New York City Chapter, local Democratic Party members, Democracy for New York City, members of Astoria Is For Obama, and any other community members who wish to respond to the assault. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />“I shouldn’t have to feel afraid to walk down the street with my partner because of people who don’t want to accept homosexuality,” says Shanel Ford, a 17 year-old Astoria resident and member of Generation Q.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Join us as community members stand up in support of the diversity that makes Astoria special.&nbsp; Contact Marisa Ragonese, Program Director of Generation Q at 718-204-5955 for more information about the rally and march. To get to Athens Park, take the N or W train to the 30th Avenue stop.&nbsp; Athens Park is one block from the train station&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

It&#039;s nice to get together with other people who believe what you do, but it is not very likely that those people are going to change anyone&#039;s minds or get anything done. I used to go to them in college and sure, it was fun, but the real change comes from giving your hours to causes themselves, not marching or gathering in support of them. If you want change to happen, donate your time, your money and your skills to assisting organizations you support.<br /><br />Or it could just been that we have a couple of people who are not in favor of Carmen&#039;s, as evidenced in the thread immediately after the attack.

				Apparently it shows the need for such a march in Astoria. &nbsp;Then again, practically any post will get a negative nod. &nbsp;I don&#039;t take them seriously at all.<br /><br />As a participator in many marches over the years, I have been personally involved in the causes I have marched for, donating time, money, and energy to the cause.&nbsp; I think marches do a lot to bring light to an issue that may not have gotten attention otherwise, and have never just made me feel good about standing up for a cause.&nbsp; Yes, there are people who participate that may exhibit that behavior, but I think it&#039;s a mistake to believe they do nothing for a cause.&nbsp; By and large, the people I&#039;ve marched with have been very involved in organizations they were supporting.&nbsp; And some were directly inspired by the marches they became a part of.&nbsp; I know I was, it was a life-defining moment.&nbsp;

Because us residents of Astoria are such backward folk needing of a proper education that only a well planned March Against Hate can provide?<br /><br />As for the neg nodding, since many on this board feel that expressing a negative needs to be further explained, I did neg nod the second post because of the atrocious spelling and general tone that suggests that Astoria needs to show the rest of NYC anything.<br /><br />BTW, shouldn&#039;t a &quot;March Against Hate&quot; take place near the perpetrator&#039;s residence and not near the victim&#039;s.

				I also don&#039;t get the negative nods.<br /><br />The plan for the protest is to show that the community is united in not tolerating hateful behavior.&nbsp; Again, Astoria&#039;s great strength is our diversity, and 99% percent of us are glad that our neighbors are of different colors, races, ages, ethnicity and sexual orientation.&nbsp; If we all stand up in support of this strength then we will send a message embracing diveristy and against hatred.&nbsp; <br /><br />Will this march end bigotry?&nbsp; No, but I do think it will show people that bigotry is not welcome in our neighborhood, and it may help to make some members of our community feel safer.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m all for this. I think that marches very rarely change anything, however it does make people aware and that&#039;s important.

				You&#039;re free to express your opinion.&nbsp; I guess we have to agree to disagree on some things, that said we&#039;re not marching to condescend, we&#039;re marching against injustice, to show that all members of our community are welcome, and to demonstrate that hate crimes are not acceptable.&nbsp; I do think Astoria can and should be one of the forces showing the rest of the country that diverse people can coexist happily.&nbsp; <br /><br />Will our march end hate?&nbsp; Of course not.&nbsp; Bobby Kennedy said that every time someone speaks out against injustice they send forth a tiny ripple of hope - and those ripples, crossed with millions of other ripples, can change the world.&nbsp; We&#039;re trying to make things a little better, and we hope you join us.
