								<div class="inner" id="msg_12823">First off, yes, self respect should be included in my first statement.&nbsp; But when I think of the idea behind the &quot;ownership society&quot; as bush likes to put it, I think of actions that are meant solely for yourself, regardless of how it effects society.&nbsp; Example would be SUV&#39;s.&nbsp; SUV drivers are given tax breaks, when the opposite would better serve society as a whole, as they contribute larger amounts of polution.&nbsp; To me, this clearly puts the individual above society as a whole.&nbsp; But that&#39;s a little off topic.&nbsp; As I personally see it, personal responsibility, would idealy go hand in hand with social responsibility.&nbsp; One greatly effects the other.&nbsp; So yeah, maybe I was trying to stir the soup a little with my previous comments, but I get the impression the vast majority of people on this board have a sense of community.&nbsp; Isn&#39;t that why we&#39;re on Astorians.com?&nbsp; So, I would like to think we all feel that our personal actions can have an effect on those around us.&nbsp; In this particular discussion, litter.&nbsp; I don&#39;t litter, therefore I am doing my small part in keeping my city/neighborhood clean, for both me, and my neighbors, as I feel a sense of responsibilty to both my myself, and my neighbors.<br /><br /></div>

Our mission is to maximize the potential of technology to help low-income people improve their lives and join the economic mainstream. We invest in the skills, abilities, and potential of people to participate fully in American society.<br /><br />How does your support help low-income people? Donations to One Economy are used to make tangible changes in people&#39;s lives. Since our founding in 2000, we&#39;ve achieved the following results:&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />We now reach as many as half a million monthly Beehive users, one-quarter of them using the site in Spanish. They access important information about money, health, school, jobs, and child care. Over 8 million people have used the Beehive since its launch in 2001.<br /><br />The Homework Help section is visited 5,500 times every day.<br /><br />There are currently over 75,000 registered Beehive users.<br /><br />This past tax season, we helped families who applied for the Earned Income Tax Credit on the Beehive get an average of $4,000 in tax returns.<br /><br />We&#39;ve directly impacted the lives of 500 young people across the country serving over 3,000 families through our Digital Connectors program.<br /><br />We&#39;ve provided high-speed Internet access to over 200,000 units of affordable housing, and that number is growing.<br /><br />We&#39;re changing housing policy in 37 states + District of Columbia through our Bring IT Home Campaign. Many more have made commitments to bring access to technology to their affordable housing residents. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />We&#39;re helping change lives, one at a time.

The question is about how we view government and what role we want government to play in the life of it&#39;s citizens.<br /><br />I&#39;ve found that in general if you ask someone who leans to the right what they think the role of government is, they will tell you &quot;to make and enforce the laws&quot;. If you ask someone on the left, the answer will tend more towards &quot;to look after the welfare of its citizens&quot;. These are two completely different views. <br /><br />Take a program like the one TRX mentioned- it sounds like a wonderful idea. I am all in favor of helping people find the means to get ahead.

								<div class="inner" id="msg_12868">Its all relative, folks. <br />Back to [somewhat] the original topic:<br />I live on a pretty litter-strewn block in Astoria (34th St and B&#39;way) and yeah I HATE it when people litter. Like TRX, I&#39;m from Southern California and I too grew up with another sort of litter: air pollution and gridlock in lieu of street pollution. So compared to that, Astoria is cleaner (more walking) but yet walled with trash.<br />On the other end of the spectrum, you must compare Astoria with more problematic places. Like BUSHWICK, Brooklyn. That&#39;s where I lived before moving here. For those of your who don&#39;t frequent our borough to the south, I tell you: not only is Bushwick socio-economically deprived, but the trash on the streets is 100X worse than Astoria. I was often among the only young women walking down the street; women and children were rarely out after nightfall. My single grocery store took more EBT/WIC than they did cash and credit cards. There is a lot of crime in Bushwick. A LOT. Both petty and violent. When my neighbors were jumped on the way home from the subway station, I asked the cops what I should do to protect myself. They said &quot;move out&quot;. They didn&#39;t care that white kids were being mugged when they had crack head shootouts a block over. <br />My point is that in certain communities, there is no respect because of a myriad of factors: ignorance, of course but also because they have no incentive to participate in the Social Contract when they look around them and see no infrastructure.<br />There was a car on fire on my street one winter. Seriously. A burning carcass of a car. I thought it would explode. I called 311 and then the local police. That car continued burning for 24 more hours until it just burned out and then kids started playing in its ruins. Then addicts started living in it. The city did nothing for weeks. The sanitation department gave me the run around. <br /><br />Now I ask you, if you lived in a place like that, why would you bother throwing your gum wrapper in an [over-stuffed, festering] wastebasket? You don&#39;t feel like you make a difference. The ridiculous potholes and broken streetlights tell you that the city has also forsaken you. Your main concern is probably to avoid getting mugged, not placing litter in the correct receptacle.<br /><br />Here is where I lean toward JTrane&#39;s opinion. The Social Contract requires that both society and the individual uphold their ends of the agreement so that we can all co-exist in humane conditions. But if you&#39;re unluck enough to be born a black man in Bushwick, for example, you&#39;re accustomed to society not really holding up its end of the bargain: to provide every person with equal oppertunities for health and happiness. I do not see the free market mentality as helpful because capitalism pivots around profit. That is its purpose. There is no immediate profit in patching up the Social Contract. This all relates to Malcolm Gladwell&#39;s tipping point, Freakonomics, and of course the famed &quot;broken window&quot; theory.</div>

Shouldn&#39;t education be considered part of that safety net?<br /><br />It still shocks me that people accept the poor education that so many of the nations children recieve and then blame them when they can&#39;t get ahead in life because they never learned to put a sentence together</div>

The Social Contract requires that both society and the individual uphold their ends of the agreement so that we can all co-exist in humane conditions. But if you&#39;re unluck enough to be born a black man in Bushwick, for example, you&#39;re accustomed to society not really holding up its end of the bargain: to provide every person with equal oppertunities for health and happiness. I do not see the free market mentality as helpful because capitalism pivots around profit. That is its purpose. There is no immediate profit in patching up the Social Contract. This all relates to Malcolm Gladwell&#39;s tipping point, Freakonomics, and of course the famed &quot;broken window&quot; theory.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />at an earlier point in the thread, someone said the right wing views government as the authoritative body to make and enforce laws.&nbsp; from what i&#39;ve read of this post, it seems to me that the failure here in bushwick was that there was no enforcement of these laws, not any sort of statement as to what the Social Contract is and how it applies to a filthy neighborhood.<br /><br />I have to admit though, that i&#39;m not familiar with the concept of a Social Contract beyond what was written here.</div>
