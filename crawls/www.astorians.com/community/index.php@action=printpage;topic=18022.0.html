				Saw car crash on Vernon Blvd. tonite.&nbsp; &nbsp;Limo hit speeding cab, cab went skidding, hit some&nbsp; fool and his girlfriend head on, and they crashed into parked cars.&nbsp; &nbsp; So people pull out cell phones---to take pictures!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The five near me, only one was calling 911.&nbsp; Across street, people are on tippy toes aiming phone cameras.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One guy called a friend to &#039;Come down with your camera, there&#039;s been a big accident.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Like it was party time or something.<br /><br /><br />Everyone was ok, thankfully.&nbsp; &nbsp; I referred to one guy as fool cause when limo guy, who was not at fault ran over to see if everyone was ok,&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. sportscar jumps out and screams over and over that limo guy is at fault,&nbsp; carries on like jerk, even got on witnesses later who said taxi was speeding.&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Fool even started screaming at one woman as she is talking to cop, the&nbsp; cop finally shut him up. <br /><br /><br />Worse thing was right after accident, the rush to get pictures.&nbsp; &nbsp; People are losing sense of priorities.&nbsp; &nbsp;Only one other person went over with me to see if eveyone was ok (They were, surprisingly.)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I was biking on Vernon and saw the aftermath of the accident (ambulance, cops, smashed up cars and onlookers).&nbsp; Looked like a scarey accident, and I hope everyone is okay.

				That corner has the worst visibility!&nbsp; I think there was another accident there just a few weeks ago.&nbsp; <br /><br />Glad no one was hurt.&nbsp; I was wondering what all the commotion was last night.

				It&#039;s human nature to stop and stare, although I don&#039;t go as far as taking pics/videos of the scene.<br />It&#039;s only a car crash, which is something that happens every day, big deal.
