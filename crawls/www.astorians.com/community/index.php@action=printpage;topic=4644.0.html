				Just a head&#39;s up on some upcoming changes at Amici Amore...<br /><br />I ordered dinner from there last night and when my boyfriend went to pick it up, he ended up chatting with the guys there... seems they&#39;re making some changes with the restaruant. They are supposedly going to change the name (to what, I don&#39;t know yet). It will stay Italian, but they&#39;re making it less formal, and more of a bistro-type place. The menu will be modified, but I don&#39;t have any info on what exactly the changes will be. The one thing they did say is that the prices will be lower. And they will be making delivery orders as well (though they&#39;ve always made a delivery exception for me because I live in the building). Also, they&#39;ve reclaimed the space that was Butcher Bros steakhouse, and have turned it back into a bar area for the Italian side. <br /><br />Without knowing any more details than that, I have somewhat mixed feelings... I&#39;ve always been a big fan of the place. Because of its slightly upscale vibe, it makes for a nice place to bring visitors, or somewhere to go for a &quot;special&quot; dinner. And I hope the changes to the menu aren&#39;t too drastic, because I love their food.<br /><br />On the other hand-- I don&#39;t go there as much as I&#39;d like to because it is a bit pricey to eat there often. So this might be a good change for them-- if it&#39;s more laid-back and less expensive, it might encourage more of a neighborhood crowd, which would be nice.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#39;ll keep you posted on when they make the switch so you can check it out! <br /><br />

The space was closed up for a bit, then they did the construction work to integrate it back with the Italian place (the work is all done now).<br /><br />Can&#39;t say I&#39;m surprised that the steakhouse didn&#39;t make it. The prices were really high (they used the same meat vendor as Peter Luger), and I just don&#39;t think there was sufficient demand for a place like that in the neighborhood. I only went there once I think (and it was during the summer so I didn&#39;t even get a steak-- go figure)

				thatjimguy took me to Butcher Bros a couple of years ago for Valentine&#39;s.&nbsp; With a great flourish, they presented us the special Valentine&#39;s Day menu -- that was all Italian specialties!&nbsp; Not a steak to be seen.&nbsp; I told the waiter that we had come specifically to have the steak, and although he seemed surprised that I might want a porterhouse instead of Capellini Ai Frutti Di Mare or Anatra Con Riso Selvaggio, they took away the fancy menu and brought us the steakhouse menu.&nbsp; We got the porterhouse for two, which was very good, but not exceptional in a way that made me say, wow, I could never do this at home.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#39;ll be interested to hear what the new menu is like at the revamped Amici Amore.

				Let&#39;s hope they do something about that roach problem.&nbsp; Last time I was there (albiet a year ago), a fairly sized roach crawled up the curtain by my table.&nbsp; Hard not to lose your appetite when it happens, but then again, roaches seem to be everywhere, including occasionally in my apartment&nbsp; :-o

				I loved that place.&nbsp; I&#39;m sad.&nbsp; I hope they turn it into something equally great or better.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t like the butcher brothers, but I loved the Italian Food.&nbsp; I&#39;ve gone there numerous times on birthdays and anniversaries.&nbsp; I am going to miss it.&nbsp;
