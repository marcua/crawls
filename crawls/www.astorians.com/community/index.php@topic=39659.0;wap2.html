			Hey! I know that political stuff isn&#039;t embraced by everyone on this site, but for those who are: There&#039;s a bill floating around the New York City Council called the Right to Know Act, which would strengthen relations between the city&#039;s police force and the community—basically it would just require officers to identify themselves when they stop someone, tell the person why they&#039;ve been stopped, and tell them that they have the legal right to refuse to be searched without legal justification. (All this is in the officer handbook, but like many a thing in any employee handbook, it gets overlooked—this would require them to say it as a matter of routine, like Miranda rights.)<br /><br /><br />How this applies to Astoria: Our councilmember, Costa Constantinides, is pretty progressive overall but needs to be convinced that he should co-sponsor the bill. Calling his office at 718.274.4500 to let him know you support more transparent relations with the NYPD would be super-helpful in creating a safer environment for everyone in Astoria. It took me 45 seconds (yes, I timed it). Here&#039;s to a safer community!

			Thank you for this information! I didn&#039;t know about Costa&#039;s position on this - I see him at school dropoff most days and will put in a word.
