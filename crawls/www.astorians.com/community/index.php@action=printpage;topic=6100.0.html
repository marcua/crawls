				I see it the same as saying if you are a New Yorker, you are from the United States, or American...sure I&quot;m American, and live in the United States, but when people out of country ask me where I&quot;m from, I say New York, not &quot;U.S.&quot; I affiliate more with New York than let&#039;s say, Utah....that being said, <br /><br />&quot;long island&quot; is technically this whole island, but the affiliations don&#039;t work that way, so the words ceases to being functional of a geographical description unless there is a consensus about the term. So as it stands now:<br /><br />Long Island= suffolk and Nassau<br />Queens= most of Queens (Ridgewood is a little tricky)<br />Bronx= most of the Bronx (maybe throgs neck? debateable)<br />Brooklyn = no sleep till<br /><br />And to me Anything north of the bronx is upstate..(I know its wrong, but...)

				I&#039;m not sure what point you&#039;re trying to make, darioism. Yes we&#039;re all on the same island, but we are New York City residents and thus we think of ourselves as such.

				Haha... I knew I&#039;d kick up a good debate. Touch√©, nyc8675309. Maybe I&#039;m just too literal, but I think it&#039;s strange when people say &quot;heading out to Long Island&quot; yet they don&#039;t cross any bodies of water to get there. I mean, if they called it &quot;Flubberville&quot; or something instead, it would be fine. (Actually that would be awesome!) I think we should vote to change the name to the geographically, politically, and phonetically correct word &quot;Lawnkeyelint&quot;. Until then, I live on Long Island with the rest of you Astorians!

				that is true.<br /><br />Perhaps when I say I am heading out to Long Island this weekend to lounge out by the pool... I am referring to it based on its US mail postmark?<br /><br />But we can turn this westward as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;Many of my Astoria neighbors will say&nbsp; &quot;I am heading in to the City today, wanna join me?&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And I always remind them that we already are in the City, just not in Manhattan.....

				Not even &quot;Long Island&quot;, it&#039;s &quot;the island&quot;.<br /><br />So if you live in new york city, you only refer to Manhattan as the city, but if you are from the island, then the city means any of the five boroughs.

				No, it&#039;s the same on Long Island. I grew up on LI, and if you&#039;re going into the City of New York you refer to the name of the borough you&#039;re travelling to, except if it&#039;s Manhattan. Then you&#039;re going into &quot;the city&quot;.<br /><br />Also, I have a friend originally from Queens who denies the fact that the borough is geographically located on Long Island.&nbsp; :-P

				Perhaps it depends on where on the island you&#039;re from?&nbsp; I grew up in the sticks (Holtsville) and there you&#039;d say &quot;We are going to the City to see the Unisphere&quot;.&nbsp; We always referred to our relatives who lived in Queens and Brooklyn as living in the city.&nbsp;

				I think it&#039;s like the difference between biological fruits and vegetables and culinary fruits and vegetables. Biologically, tomatoes are fruits, but culinarily, we use them like vegetables. Meteorological and astronomical seasons don&#039;t line up either. (Spring is March, April and May to weather folks, but March 20 to June 21st to astronomers.) <br /><br />Geographically, we all live on Long Island. Culturally, telling someone from a rough neighborhood of Brooklyn that they&#039;re from Long Island is a good way to get pummeled...

				Hmmm, don&#039;t think I&#039;d go so far as to typecast a person based solely on where they live. <br /><br />Nor would I let geography alone define the place. I think of Long Island as anything east of Queens (Nassau &amp; Suffolk.) But I don&#039;t refer to Queens/B&#039;klyn/ Bronx as &quot;the city&quot; either. I usually tell people from way out of town that I live &quot;right near NYC.&quot; People familiar with the area will understand if I tell them &quot;Queens.&quot; <br /><br />We&#039;re just the outer boroughs, somewhere b/w &quot;the city&quot; and Long Island.&nbsp; 8-)

				I&#039;ve always used this handy rule of thumb:<br /><br />If I can&#039;t get there by subway, I&#039;m either Upstate or out on The Island.<br /><br />So to answer your question - Long Island starts exactly 1 block east of the Jamaica-179th St. station off of the F line.

				While geographically Queens and brookly lie on Long Island-Long Island itself is comprised of 2 counties, Nassau and Suffolk.

Nassau county was given the opportunity to be incorporated into NYC as a 6th borough but they declined. <br />And imho &quot;the city&quot; is ALL 5 boroughs, so when you are in Queens you can&#039;t say you are going into the city because you ARE in the city.

				So does that mean I can head out for a trip from Suffolk County to Staten Island and say &quot;I&#039;m going to the city&quot;? If Nassau County became the sixth borough, would that leave just Suffolk County as &quot;Long Island&quot;? Ponder, ponder. <br /><br />I think this is a topic that nobody will ever solve.

				I have lived in Queens all of my life. Most NYkers (From the boroughs) don&#039;t consider Queens and Brooklyn as part of Long Island although geographically it is. I find that the closer you get to any &quot;city&quot; the dwellers tend to identify with the city and not the suburbs. I work in LI and when I say I live in Queens people say &quot;oh, you live in the &#039;city&#039;&quot;. So I guess it is all a matter of your perspective. I find that people outside of NY will include LI as the &quot;city&quot; too. Hope that helps.<br />~Cliff
