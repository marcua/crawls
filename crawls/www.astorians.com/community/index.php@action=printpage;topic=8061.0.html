				Hmmm....&#160; At 1:39 PM, no less.&#160; Beautiful sunny day.&#160; What makes some people rise from their beds and say, &quot;I&#039;m gonna get up and rob that bank today.&quot;<br /><br />Secondly, hey, that&#039;s my bank.&#160; Why do these people think there&#039;s any money there?&#160; That&#039;s where other impoverished people go to have their free checking accounts, you dodos!&#160; There&#039;s no money there.&#160; In fact, I have it on good authority the managers have to run down to Chase to get enough rubles to fill the ATM when I press the screen for a meager $20.<br /><br />- Cannibal

				Banks today no longer have security guards. They simply have various anti-theft policies and proceedures, and take their chances. 20-30 years ago every bank branch had at least one security guard. Today they pass their higher insurance premiums and actual losses onto their customers with higher fees.<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry about your money though, you are insured by the FDIC in case of bank theft, or bankruptcy by your bank, unless you have over $100,000 in a single account. Pretty brazen of the thieves, they sound desperate to try to knock off a small residential bank branch. Most bank robberies today are in the way of identity thefts, ATM frauds, and check and wire frauds. Old fashioned bank robberies have too much risk for thieves.

				I have a friend that works at this bank. This bank gets robbed, A LOT!!&nbsp; She said it happened so fast that hardly anyone realized it happened until the teller alerted everyone after the thief&nbsp; left! He handed her a note asking for money, the teller complied, the thief left!&nbsp; Actually on the Gothamist Newsmap from last week a bank a block away from this one was robbed, probably by the same person!

				The Sovereign Bank on the corner of Crescent and 34th Ave. used to have an old time security guard back when it was Long Island City Savings Bank (anyone remember that?). &nbsp;I remember it was a really old guy who probably couldn&#039;t do much even if there was a robbery. &nbsp;But he did carry a gun. &nbsp;And he gave out lollipops. &nbsp;Then when it bacame Independence Bank, they had another armed guard for a while, but then he was gone too and nobody replaced him. &nbsp;I actually wrote the bank a letter telling them it was outrageous to get rid of the guard. &nbsp;I know that place was robbed once already and I&#039;m sure it&#039;s happened numerous other times. &nbsp;I felt much more secure with the guard there.

				I imagine that the vast majority of bank robberies are fast and only for the small amounts of money in a cash drawer. In that case, it&#039;s probably safer to <em>not</em> have a guard.

				Im surprised nothing happened with Commerce Bank. I cant believe that they dont have window guards for the Tellers! Even when I was in college, the registrars had window guards. Its strange to see a bank not have them.&nbsp; Chase and Citibank are like Fort Knox. I never felt safe going into Commerce, unless they have some real tight security system on the down-low.

				Commerce prefers to be more customer friendly, so therefore no &quot;teller cages&quot;.&nbsp; It&#039;s a marketing policy weighed against security/loss/safety concerns.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m not sure but I thought at one time Banco Popular had the same policy, but think they might have changed that.<br /><br />I remember seeing a study a while back that Commerce was the most robbed chain of banks in the city.&nbsp; That was even before they were as large as they are now.

				It seems like a LOT of those banks on Broadway are getting hit recently - this never happened in the past, at least at this pace.<br /><br />When I look at those police stats that show that crime is dropping, I wonder if they are not &#039;messaged&#039; at bit - afterall, everyone is complaining the police do not seem to answer the phones, and I have personally seen the police drive right by ignoring quality of life things like loud car radios and people taping up posters.<br /><br />If someone doesn&#039;t even respond to calls for help, and that is their job, what else are they capable of?<br /><br />I get the feeling that it seems like things are spiking a bit wiping out most of the improvements from the 90s.<br /><br />Someone should ask Vallone, the head of Public Safety, as to the wisdom of increasing the population of the community 20% while closing a firehouse and slashing police and, most pointedly, what he intends to do about this. <br /><br />The next time you go to the precinct meeting perhaps you can ask them these points - that is, if they and a gaggle of developers don&#039;t show up to spend the evening, not discussing important issues, but having a back-slapping time raising a tiny bit of money for a charity.

				Why is it ‘let’s blame the police’ the first response to something like this? Why not blame the banks? Huge corporations who earn billions each year but apparently don’t give a dawn about protecting their assets, or providing for their customers&#039; safety? <br /><br />Maybe if banks invested some of their indecent profits in some decent security measures we’d see a decrease in the robbery rate. <br /><br />Which bank has one of the highest rates of robberies? Surprise! Commerce with its open, customer-friendly layout -- easy pickins. <br /><br /><br />You know I’m all for holding police and elected officials accountable to the people who elect them but can you really say that it’s the fault of police that bank robberies are on the increase?<br /><br />Let’s start blaming the real culprits: The people who rob the banks. <br /><br />Why banks? -- because that’s where they keep the money. <br /><br /><br />It’s not like the police are ignoring this issue. It’s a city-wide problem (and in many cities across the US) and from what I read it’s very much on their agenda and a significant number of cases have been solved and arrest made.<br /><br />Not everything problem boils down to development and an increase in population. Banks were robbed when the population dipped in the 70s and 80s and they get robbed now that it’s on the rise.<br /><br />Maybe this was a typo but last time I checked, Peter Vallone was not responsible for increasing the population of the community 20% -- but as our elected official I’m all for asking him what is being done and holding him accountable to see that something is done.<br />

				If you want to isolate the bank robberies from everything else, yes, you are correct. The attitude today (and speaking as a former banker) is the insurance will cover it, silent alarms, and small drawers.<br /><br />Lot better than some old guard getting into an exchange of gunfire.<br /><br />But, there are far broader issues here.<br /><br />If you see a broken window, you CAN talk about one landlord not doing their work, or, take a step back and look at that broken window and this broken window, and suddenly its a bigger picture.<br /><br />Diverting attention away from those responsible for Public Safety doesn&#039;t help the matter. There is a very real feeling in this community, by both old timers and new residents, that this is not safe like it used to be, &#039;official&#039; stats notwithstanding.<br /><br />And those who are responsible for this, <br /><br />1.as encouraging a greater population as services are being cut back, <br />2. or simply going through the motions as many of you charge the current makeup of the precinct council,&nbsp; <br /><br />sould be questioned liberally by the public. <br /><br />After all, why are we paying taxes?

				Picture this:<br />I’m the man, really. Far and wide, from Broadway to Ditmars, Shore Boulevard to Jackson Heights, everyone knows me and the flash lifestyle I lead. I’m a regular at all the Euro cafes on Grand Avenue where I spend my vast amounts of money and I’m known for keeping large amounts of cash in the house, leaving my open windows and doors unlocked. Because you know, I’m a friendly guy with nothing to lose.<br /><br />One afternoon, I’m home, minding my own business (as usual), making a grilled cheese sandwich, when a trio of thugs burst in, guns drawn, and demand all my money. I protest, but being outnumbered and unarmed, I hand it over. They leave and all I’m left with is my now burnt cheese sandwich to console me.<br /><br />Who’s to blame for what happened to me?<br /><br />1) The police because they’re too busy driving the wrong way up streets writing parking tickets, double-parked in front of Dukin’ Donuts, being rude to people. <br /><br />2) Peter Vallone Jr. because, well, he’s Peter and we all know he doesn’t do enough.<br /><br />3) Young college kids moving into the neighborhood and attracting the wrong element.<br /><br />4) Real estate developers because they build ugly apartment buildings that bring ugly people into the neighbour who back up the sewers and bring the electrical grid to the brink of collapse<br /><br />5) The lack of a book store because if criminals had more opportunities to read they may not turn to a life of crime.<br /><br />6) Motorcyclists because no one could hear my cries for help.<br /><br /><br />My point is that the blame for crime should be put first on the criminals who commit them.<br /><br />The police can always do more to prevent crime. Our elected official can always do more to better allocate resources but individuals and companies also have obligation to protect themselves, their families, their customers, etc. and work with the police and politicians.<br /><br />Gleason – I get your perspective and appreciate what you tried to say in this post and many others. But your reaction to every problem seems to be that “government” is not doing enough or something is an issue because of “development”. I know you know it’s not that simple but it doesn’t come across in your posts at times. <br /><br />Billz – I appreciate your thoughtful responses but can I suggest something? Paragraphs…use paragraphs! A line break is your reader’s friend. &nbsp;:-)<br /><br />

				Time to derail the hyperbole wagon and get down to real facts.<br /><br />28grand, first you want to blame the banks for supposedly skimping on security. Next it&#039;s the criminals. Which is it?<br /><br />The chance of a violent incident occurring during a bank robbery is very low, and bank robberies only make up around 2% of total robberies committed.<br /><br />http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/offenses/violent_crime/robbery.html<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to find more recent stats, but these are from 2002 regarding bank robberies:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> The incidence of violence and injury is very low. NIBRS data show that violence occurred in only 2.34 percent of incidents and BCS shows 4.84 percent over the time period. Given the low rates of violence, it should not be unexpected that the injury levels displayed in Table 5.8 are also quite low—5.58 percent for NIBRS data and 2.00 percent for BCS.<br /><br />Regarding other crimes present in the incident, murder is very low at less than 1.0 percent in both databases, as are kidnapping and hostage-taking. Both NIBRS data and BCS data show that kidnapping/hostage-taking occurs in less than 2.0 percent of reported bank robberies.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Bank robbery happens. There is no &quot;blame&quot;. Be grateful we don&#039;t have people getting shot and killed on a regular basis on our neighborhood streets.<br /><br />I&#039;d rather be &quot;victim&quot; of a bank robbery, frankly. You are less likely to get injured in a bank robbery than in a mugging -- and of course more likely to get your money back, too. Add to that the draconian laws in the city which prohibit honest citizens from adequately protecting ourselves in our own homes, and being caught in a bank during a robbery is almost a picnic.<br /><br />And if banks <em>were</em> more secure and deterred would-be robbers, I wonder how many would instead resort to more violent crime for their need for cash?

				I was trying to be ironic and slightly sarcastic but I&#039;ll settle for &quot;hyperbolic&quot;.<br /><br />Now back to the main program...<br /><br />I posted, both seriously and in jest, as a response to what I feel is a prevailing sentiment that when a crime or something negative occurs or an issue that affects the community arises, the first reaction is to blame the police and elected officials for not doing enough. I feel they are only part of the equation to solve problems.<br /><br />Additionally, I posted because I find the usual chorus of &quot;overpopulation&quot; and &quot;overdevelopment&quot; as the default response to every issue old and tired.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry if wasn&#039;t clear:<br /><br />In general, I blame criminals for committing crimes.<br /><br />Specifically though, in regard to the surge in bank robberies, if people feel this is an issue, then in my opinion banking conglomerates should do more to curtail this trend, especially given the huge amount of profits they earn. In fact I think they have a moral responsibility to act and help the communities they do business in -- before someone gets hurt or killed.<br /><br />Bank robberies are on the increase. Do a search &quot;robbery, increase&quot; and you&#039;ll find numerous articles dating back to 2003 documenting triple digit increases in the number of them so this is hardly a new phenomenon. <br /><br />Some theories have been put forth and one of them postulates that the reason for the increase in robberies is that because banks are easier to rob. Banks should correct this either by better physical design and layout and/or increased security measures.<br /><br />Finally, I don&#039;t accept your supposition that if criminals weren&#039;t robbing banks they&#039;d be robbing people. This may be your opinion but it isn&#039;t fact and frankly, for myself, I&#039;d prefer not be a victim of, or involved in, any crime including bank robbery. I also feel I shouldn&#039;t have to feel grateful for being able to walk the streets without being shot or killed. I may be a dreamer but I still feel I live in a city where this is an anomaly, not the norm.<br /><br />

				And while we&#039;re on the subject of banks, I&#039;m always amazed at how fast banks change names/merge.&nbsp; This is what I remember -- feel free to add to the list:<br /><br />Long Island City Savings Bank on the c/o 34th Ave. and Crescent became Independence Savings Bank then Independence Community Bank and now is Sovereign Bank<br /><br />Interbank on the c/o Broadway and 31st St. became Marathon Bank<br /><br />The Marathon Bank on Broadway between 32nd and 33rd St. closed<br /><br />Astoria Federal Savings on 30th Ave. at 35th St. became First Central Savings<br /><br />Greenpoint Bank on the c/o 32nd St. and Broadway became Northfork Bank<br /><br />Fleet Bank on Steinway between Broadway and 31st Ave. became Bank of America<br /><br />Chemical Bank on the c/o Steinway and Broadway became Chase<br /><br />There used to be a Citibank on the c/o 34th Ave. and 24th St. (where the bodgea is now)
