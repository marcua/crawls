				it is a good idea.<br /><br />my suggestion would be to just plan something and invite people using this forum and the yahoo astorians group and give enough notice. &nbsp;i, for instance, wouldn't commit long-term to such a group, but if I had the extra cash and time when something was going on i would totally come out.

				Jayme<br />Seeing as how it looks like you, Jonathan and I are the only interested parties (and he and I are married) lets do it at a time when you CAN eat and you're not on your way to yoga. &nbsp;Wed? &nbsp;do you go to yoga every eve? &nbsp;6:30 is a bit early for us but we can do it if that's your only time. <br /><br />Jour et Nuit (i may have the name wrong) is a new Morrocan place on the West side of Steinway between 30 and 28th (closer to 28th). <br /><br />Other interested diners??

				gosh darn it... i totally forgot that Thursday is the first movie night at Waltz. &nbsp;We met the couple (one of the couples?) who are showing their film a couple of weeks ago and we told them we'd be there in support. &nbsp;Now the last time we went to Waltz there were no seats left in the place and so we didn't get to soak in the entertainment. &nbsp;But I do want to give it another shot - the movies start at 7:30. &nbsp;Of course this means I can't do dinner Thursday. &nbsp;I hate to arrange and then back out... but I think that's what i'm doing. &nbsp;I suck. &nbsp; :( <br /><br />Of couse this could be a positive thing... For those who didn't have enough $ for dinner - movie night is free and coffee/dessert is relatively cheap. &nbsp;<br /><br />Jen

				We might want to get reservations but I don't mind meeting outside.<br /><br />I do NOT want to be in charge of getting the reservation though as I'll be off the boards from noon or so until dinner time (during peak reservation making/changing to accomodate the changing headcount time).<br /><br />I haven't been to or heard much about Jour et Nuit though so I'm not sure how difficult it will be for them to accomodate what is now a sort of large group without a reservation.

				Let me clarify my last post.<br /><br />over dinner friday night, Laura was telling us that Osprey was her favorite vinyard. When i saw it mention in the nytimes, i posted the info.<br /><br />I agree with enigma that LI wines must be improving. &nbsp;Im from the island and for a good many years I avoided the local wines. too young too raw?? &nbsp;too sweet.<br /><br />They are definitely improving.

				I think it's a very good thing that LI wines are getting better. &nbsp;I have also heard good things about Lenz in the past few years. &nbsp;Their whites are apparently quite tasty. &nbsp;Maybe I need to go back and do some tasting in the spring.<br /><br />My bottle of Osprey was yum. &nbsp;I was glad I bought it. &nbsp;Plus they have a fun label. &nbsp; :D <br /><br />I have had some really good Australian wines lately. &nbsp;I understand South African wines are up and coming as well. &nbsp;<br /><br />I love wine! &nbsp;What we had at dinner was very nice, too.

				That's so neat that Osprey's won NY winery of the year!<br /><br />Osprey's has consistently been the LI winery with the best wines in our opinion (despite the fact that it's one of the smaller vineyards) - we've been visiting and tasting LI wines since '98 or so. &nbsp;As far back as the mid-90s they had a very good cabernet. &nbsp;Their sauvignon blanc is also nice.<br /><br />In the past 3-4 years things have improved quite a bit on LI. &nbsp;It's still a young wine-producing region, so there are still some misses out there. &nbsp;But it's getting better.<br /><br />Lenz whites are quite good, Meg, in particular their silver label chardonnay, which is a good medium of price and quality. &nbsp;Macari also has some good whites, and Bedell Cellars has some nice reds. &nbsp;Jim and I served a Macari chardonnay and a Bedell merlot at our wedding. &nbsp;The merlot was given a very strong review by our French guests.

				I just have to chime in here that Osprey's Dominion is indeed a pretty decent LI wine. Pelligrini is also very good and Pindar's <em>Pythagoras</em> is very good tho most of Pindar stinks. <br /><br />I happened to have writtten my master's thesis about NYS wine (wine dork!) and thought you'd be interested to know that there is a store and new accompanying wine bar on Broome street called Vintage New York that only carries NYS products. I have my beef with the owners, but it's still a fun place to check out. They also own Rivendell (yes, like in Lord of the Rings), a Hudson Valley winery, that stinks but buys some decent Finger Lakes wine that they sell and recieve awards for under thier own label. <br /><br />Other NYS wine to look for is Millbrook reserve (hudson valley), Borghese reserve (LI) and the godfather of NYS wine, Dr. Frank Reisling (Seneca Lake). <br /><br />Think global, buy local! ~

				Stacey, if you haven't already, check out Trattoria L'Incontro (http://www.trattorialincontro.com/). &nbsp;I've been to business lunches in their main room, and they have a separate banquet/private dining room as well. &nbsp;(That is if you're talking about having the lunch outside of the office, which is what it sounds like to me.)<br /><br />iLoveCheese - Trattoria L'Incontro opened a wine bar (with a different name that I can't remember) next to their banquet space, on Ditmars between 31st and 29th, about a year ago. &nbsp;They're open Thursday, Friday and Saturday, I think. &nbsp;I haven't yet tried it.

				Thanks so much for the restaurant suggestion. &nbsp;I did get their catering menu. &nbsp;Can you believe that they are booking for December now and expect it to close by the end of October. &nbsp;<br /><br />Thanks again<br /><br />Stacey
