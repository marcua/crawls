				Are the Aladdin restaurants on 30th Avenue and 36th Avenue under the same ownership?&nbsp; Are they any good?&nbsp; I usually use Meghna or Gandhi, but walked by the Aladdin on 36th Avenue recently and wondered how it is.&nbsp; I called to see if they deliver, and they don&#39;t, which I thought was a bit strange.

				I don&#39;t know about the one on 30th ave, but I live right by the one on 36th ave, and I very rarely go there.&nbsp; I certainly have been enough times to have an opinion, though, and here it is.&nbsp; I&#39;m not a big fan.&nbsp; The food is good enough, and rather inexpensive, but the selection is terrible.&nbsp; They have a very large menu posted above the counter, but they are only making the 3 or 4 items that are written on the white board behind the counter - and these are usually the same 3 or 4 items.&nbsp; Very odd.&nbsp; It may be different for lunch, but dinner time is this way.&nbsp; They do have good samosas if you want a quick snack, and their deserts are good.<br /><br />I always liked the place a few doors east along 36th ave...Boikali I think it was called.&nbsp; They had the same menu, but would actually make what I ordered.&nbsp; That&#39;s been closed for renovations for quite a while and should be opening soon under a different name (bangala garden, or something).<br /><br />Hope that helps!<br /><br />Adam

				I saw the sign for the new space - it looks good. <br />Aladdin looked tempting, but the fact that they didn&#39;t deliver seemed odd.&nbsp; Hearing that the selection is really small doesn&#39;t help either. <br />Thanks for the information!
