				Our son will be attending kindergarten at PS 122 in the fall.&nbsp; The school no longer offers afterschool programming for kindergarten students.&nbsp; Does anyone know of an afterschool program or babysitter in the area that would be able to pick up our son from school at 3 pm each day?&nbsp; Please feel free to email me directly at amukarjiconnolly@hotmail.com if you have any suggestions.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; <br />

				Anya, We&#039;re in the same boat.&nbsp; For an afterschool program, Serious Fun is the only one I know of.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are also a number of people in the business listings section of astorians.com who are offering themselves up as babysitters.&nbsp; You might also inquire of Blue Bird Child Care, also listed on this board (somewhere!)<br /><br />I also have heard (but can&#039;t necessarily verify) that Queens Lutheran School will take kindergarteners for afterschool, but you have to arrange your own transportation. <br /><br />If none of that works, there is a pay-for-use website called Sitter City where you can post an ad (which we did) and got tons of responses.&nbsp; PM me if you want any more info on any of these.&nbsp; <br />Rachel<br />

We are open September 14-December 18 every day the public schools are open for a full day (we are closed on school 1/2 days).&nbsp; The children have a light snack, receive homework help, and participate in a 45 minute arts or language program each day.&nbsp; We also have quiet time and outdoor play (weather permitting).<br /><br />I&#039;ve included some more information below, and please feel free to call or PM me if you have any questions: 646-415-8901.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Sylvia<br /><br />Here’s an outline of the day:<br /><br />2:20-3:00&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pick ups from local schools <br />2:45-3:15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Drop offs at Serious Fun<br />3:15-3:30&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Daily Routine: take off coats, deposit book bags on table, wash hands<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Snack: crackers and choice of water or juice.<br /><em>3:30-4:15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PreK-K Enrichment class (class depending on day)</em><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1st-3rd Grade Homework help<br />4:15-4:30&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bathroom/water break and transition<br /><em>4:30-5:15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1st-3rd Grade Enrichment class</em><br />PreK-K Homework help and/or story time and quiet games<br />5:15-5:30&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pack up bags and stuff for home and GO OUTSIDE<br />5:30-5:50&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Recess Outside (weather permitting) or inside active games <br />5:50-6:00&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Parent Pick Ups<br /><br />Parents can choose from part-time or full-time one- to five-days a week.&nbsp; Our current class schedule is:<br /><br />Mondays-Hands on Art: children play with paint, mask-making, printmaking, puppetry, &amp; sculpture—the messier the better!<br /><br />Tuesdays-SocRoc: children have fun on their feet, including basic soccer skills and exercise.<br /><br />Wednesdays-Everybody Dance: children learn classic dance positions, jazz dance moves, dance games and create their own dance moves.<br /><br />Thursdays TBD, either Theater Arts or Spanish Language Immersion<br /><br />Fridays-World Music Jam: children play instruments from around the world while learning new songs &amp; cultures.<br /><br />Transportation provided from&nbsp; PS 2, 84, 85, 122, Grace Lutheran, Immaculate Conception, and St. Francis schools.<br /><br />

				Hi Josh:<br /><br />We still have space available in our after school program, opening Monday, September 14.&nbsp; Please give me a call at 646-415-8901 or visit our website for more information.&nbsp; We are open every day that public schools are open.&nbsp; We would pick up your child from PS 122, bring them to our program at 41-01 Ditmars Blvd.&nbsp; There he would have a snack, take a 45 minute enrichment class (Monday is Art, Tuesday is Soccer, Wednesday is Dance, Thursday is World Music and Friday is free play), do his homework and then play outside (weather permitting).&nbsp; You could then pick him up at 6:00 pm.&nbsp; The cost is $30 per day, or about the same as you would pay a sitter for 3 hours.&nbsp; We are a fully licensed child care center, so the cost of the program is tax deductible.&nbsp; You can choose from 1 to 5 days a week of care.<br /><br />Here is link to the registration cover sheet and the school calendar if you would like more info:&nbsp; <br />http://seriousfunnyc.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/fall-2009-registration-cover-sheet.doc.<br />http://seriousfunnyc.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/2009-2010-serious-fun-academic-calendar.xls<br /><br />Good luck in your search and I hope you find a good fit for your family,<br /><br />Sylvia<br />
