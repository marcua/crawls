				It&#039;s going to be a pharmacy.&nbsp; What a waste of space for that location!&nbsp; I live right over there.&nbsp; Let&#039;s see how many people go there when they could walk up to the CVS on 31st St.&nbsp; Even though I will only have to walk half a block to get there I will not use this pharmacy. I&#039;m sorry that Fatty&#039;s had to move because of this.

				I knew the owner&#039;s of Fatty&#039;s and they told me the owner wanted them to move so a pharmacy could open there... oh well. I predict it won&#039;t last long.&nbsp; Crescent Apothecary is also a strange name.

				It&#039;s not a strange name, it is just a little old fashioned. I think it sounds hipsterish, personally (I think because I&#039;ve seen it used in places like DUMBO and the like). We&#039;ve known it was going to be a pharmacy for some time - it was reported around the time Fatty&#039;s announced their move. I peeked in the other day and it looked like they still had to put up shelves and things. And yes, the son of the owner is a pharmacist and he wanted to open up his own place.

				I like to eat out or have a drink at times, but it&#039;s nice nice that a business other than a bar, pizzeria, bagel shop, or cafe is opening. Perhaps it will be one of those pharmacies that serves egg creams. Who knows.

				Braun, look at this:<br /><br /><br />http://www.yelp.com/biz/brooklyn-farmacy-and-soda-fountain-brooklyn<br /><br /><br />You will see thee most amazing photos of egg creams, sundaes, a lots of other goodies.

				The sundaes and such really are good.&nbsp; They also have drinks like egg creams, and a menu of basic American fare.&nbsp; The last time we were there, a kid at a nearby table was served an enormous square of mac &amp; cheese.

				Do you know that CVS Pharmacy is such a monopoly that they pick and choose what insurances they will take to fill prescriptions.&nbsp; I am grateful for Crescent Apothecary because at least that CVS has turned away my prescriptions, there is someone gracious enough to accept my insurance since CVS wants to be a bully and could care less about people in need of medical services.&nbsp; Just thought you should know that!

There are dozens of pharmacies in Astoria. And picking and choosing which coverage you accept is a decision most doctors and pharmacies make. I love how you call them a bully yet you are the one who thinks a private business needs to accept your coverage because you said so. That makes you a bully.&nbsp;
