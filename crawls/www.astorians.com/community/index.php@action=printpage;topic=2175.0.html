				i got lost somewhere around dim sum.... not too sure whats for sure....<br />are we 100% for a weekend day? should we try to see if there are any takers for a weeknight? i wouldn&#39;t have a problem with it. <br />So this dim sum action, its a early in the day thing then? We should maybe hold off then for a nice day and not count it as an Astoria EATS thing necessarily-just an outting? So Spicy and Tasty for dinner.

				I think you nailed it Flooz. I&#39;d love to go to Spicy and Tasty for our June dinner. AND regarding dim sum, maybe on a sunny Saturday we can make a somewhat spontaneous fieldtrip out of it. <br /><br />I&#39;m open to a weekday, but I think it&#39;ll involve a lot more back and forth to settle on one than is involved in choosing between 3 or 4 weekends. But if someone wants to throw out a few dates, go for it!

				Agnanti might not be a bad idea - I&#39;ve recently had a couple of really good meals there, but I&#39;d love to go back with a group to sample more of the menu.&nbsp; Would anyone be up for an afternoon kind of thing instead of a proper dinner?&nbsp; They open at 3 in the afternoon, and about that time it&#39;s easy to snag a bunch of seats, even in the outdoor seating area, which is really nice during the day time.

				The 10th for me is already pencilled in. :) I&#39;d vote for either late afternoon at Agnandi (haven&#39;t been there since before I actually moved to Astoria! And late-afternoon is a great idea, Laura!), or to Spicy &amp; Tasty in Flushing (have never been there!). <br /><br />If we decide to stay in Astoria for A.E., I&#39;ll try to organize an outing to Flushing some other time...<br />

				Here&#39;s the Agnanti (http://www.agnantimeze.com/) website.&nbsp; I find the menu easier to read if you highlight the page - it all looks really good.&nbsp; I can vouch for the grilled octopus.&nbsp; And the melitzanosalata (eggplant, garlic and olive oil spread that&#39;s delicious).&nbsp; And sometimes they have this puffy herb flatbread that is amazing.

				This a <em>very</em> belated reply, but I would also like to say how much I enjoyed that dinner at Agnanti.&nbsp; The food was great, and of course you can&#39;t beat the company.&nbsp; It was fantastic getting to finally (!) meet flooz, lanseaux, MandaT, Jim, and nycatexas.&nbsp; You ladies (and gent) were so much fun.&nbsp; I really need to stop being surprised at how friendly and sweet everyone from this board is.&nbsp; Every time I meet a new person from here, I&#39;m amazed at how much I like him or her.&nbsp; How silly!&nbsp; Of course you all are great!&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, I&#39;m definitely looking forward to the next one!<br /><br />(Meg, I absolutely adore your avatar.&nbsp; Could there <em>be</em> a cuter kitty?&nbsp; I think not!)&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D

				Thanks all for the good company and fun taste choices at Agnanti.<br />Glad that this June season started at this location.<br />&nbsp;:-D<br /><br />Very nice to see some familiar and some new diners. Glad fine company for a wonderful afternoon.<br />Great that the weather largely cooperated after so many days with an umbrella.<br />Leaving time that evening to walk and digest.<br /><br />I skipped out on the notable stroll but enjoyed Astoria as well that afternoon.<br /><br />Great photography. Love the hi-tech special effects to help focus on the food. Like the glowing finale.<br />And most will not be surprised by some memories that my tongue wants to write about:<br /><br />the &quot;chicago deep dish&quot;, the cheese meat pastry concoction that could satisfy most pizza lovers who need a taste during a Greek meal<br /><br />And of course, the &quot;swedish&quot;, the meatballs with spices and tomato sauce.<br />Will be back again for additional rounds one day.<br /><br />The Rose wine was okay but would like to try others.<br />Loved the breads and tomato/cucumber salad.<br />(Some might have hoped for better for the dessert but I found it interestingly different.)<br /><br />Cheers.<br />Until we (m)eats again.<br />TRX<br /><br />***<br />(may hope for Trivia in Astoria perhaps later in July)<br />(if any movie recommendations, please be sure to send my way any time)<br /><br />http://www.movingimage.us/site/screenings/pages/2006/index_stanley_kubrick.html<br />
