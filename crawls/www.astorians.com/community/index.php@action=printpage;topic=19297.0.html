				This morning on my way to work at 7 a.m. film crews/trucks were setting up for shooting along <br />30th Avenue between 31st &amp; 32nd Streets. That&#039;s as far as I saw - they may be further up the avenue <br />as well.<br /><br />Anyway, I checked the sign and they&#039;re doing the remake of &#039;Arthur&#039;. This one is with Russell Brandt from<br />Get Him to the Greek and Helen Mirren who, if I&#039;m remembering what I read in People correctly, is taking<br />on the John Gielgud role. I know they&#039;ve been filming around Manhattan, but it&#039;s great that they&#039;re in Astoria.<br /><br />If you&#039;re around there today, maybe you&#039;ll see them.<br />

				They&#039;re definitely there, I think maybe even all day - my husband just took a walk and saw Russell Brand hanging around outside his trailer on 30th Street off of 30th Ave.&nbsp; Very cool.&nbsp;

				My friend ran into Russell Brand in the bathroom of Grand Central last Thursday.&nbsp; Talked to him a bit.&nbsp; They were filming for &quot;Arthur&quot; there as well.&nbsp; My friend said that Russell Brand is FREAKISHLY tall.<br /><br />Cool that they&#039;re filming in Astoria.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know about you guys, but I always brag to my friends about every little bit of fame that comes Astoria&#039;s way.

				They&#039;ve been changing parking regulations on 34th Street, between Broadway and 34th Avenue for Arthur as well, though I&#039;m not sure what, if anything, they&#039;ve been doing on the street.

				I saw them filming on 31st Street, under the train.&nbsp; I thought how it must have been annoying to have to time the takes around the trains.&nbsp; (And yes, I&#039;m know they&#039;ll just redub the dialog, but that&#039;s still annoying.)&nbsp;
