				Amen Handyman, Amen.&nbsp; <br /><br />I find folks who hurry to cut you off on a sidewalk, then come to a complete STOP to be the pedestrian equivalent.&nbsp; And when folks bump into them they&#039;re shocked - hello, you just hurried up to get in front then stopped to look at something or just stand there - why push past folks to do this?

				Drivers that are soooo uncomfortable driving that they have to look down to shift.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t feel the two clicks from reverse to drive and vice-versa, you shouldn&#039;t be allowed to drive a car.&nbsp; &nbsp; There&#039;s no reason you have to double the time of your illegal u-turn (in front of me) to make sure your car is in the right gear.<br /><br />Also, once people reach a certain age, they should&nbsp; be required to take AND PASS a road test every few years.&nbsp; &nbsp; I mean just because you were alive when cars were INVENTED... doesn&#039;t mean you should be allowed to still drive one!!

				How about when 2-3 people are walking slowly on the sidewalk, blocking off the whole way?&nbsp; Then you have to jump onto the street to get around them.<br /><br />People on the subway who block off the doors so you have trouble getting on/off.<br /><br />When you can hear the subway stopping up above you, but the person in front of you on the stairs is taking their sweet time.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t care about missing it, at least let others by.<br /><br />People talking loudly on the phone or to someone else on the subway.&nbsp; I don&#039;t care what they have to say and just want silence.&nbsp; Send a text message or lower your voice.<br /><br />When you&#039;re in a store and the person who is supposed to help you doesn&#039;t speak English (only Spanish, usually).&nbsp; It&#039;s great that there are so many different cultures in this country, but we are in America, where the primary language is English.. and you should be able to go into a business and be able to communicate.&nbsp; This is also why I rarely order food from a place you have to call and prefer to use delivery.com.&nbsp; If you call, the food order is usually ok, but you can&#039;t communicate the delivery instructions.&nbsp; <br /><br />People in the way at the gym.&nbsp; If you&#039;re not really going to work out, just don&#039;t come.&nbsp; Also--deodorant was invented for a reason, so please wear it.&nbsp; Nothing worse than when ONE person manages to stink up the whole place.<br /><br />AAHH!&nbsp; As you can see, I&#039;m very easily annoyed.&nbsp; But I always try to be considerate of others, and I feel everyone should do the same.

Many of these store owners and employees, while speaking some English, aren&#039;t proficient and do not feel comfortable with their English.&nbsp; Having been brought up in the Midwest by English speaking schoolteachers, I found it frustrating to go into some stores and trying to communicate in English with the owner, but then I realized that many of them were honestly trying, but they are not fluent.<br /><br />For example, when I used to help my Dominican friend in his bodega on 36th Avenue, I saw that he was uncomfortable speaking English around people who were fluent in English and he started stuttering.&nbsp; However, we used to have the greatest conversations, mixing what little Spanish and English we both knew.&nbsp; It somehow worked.&nbsp; When English speaking customers would ask him for help, though, he would be embarrassed and sometimes just give them an odd stare. <br /><br />4. This ties in the first three points, in a way.&nbsp; Every person that I have befriended who doesn&#039;t speak English as their first language, yet serves in a capacity where they have to interact with English speaking customers, have told me that they want to learn (Yes, I&#039;m sure there are folks who don&#039;t, but I have never met them)&nbsp; However, as was the case of my Dominican friend and most of the people who worked in the restaurant, there was not enough time in the day to learn.&nbsp; They would constantly ask me how to say things in English and I would try my best, but my grammar is far from perfect (have you read my posts lately&nbsp; :-D ) so I would tell them they should find some sort of ESL program.&nbsp; That&#039;s easier said than done, especially if you&#039;re working six days a week, ten hours a day, which many of them were.<br /><br />4. Also, the fact that we live in NYC makes our situation unique.&nbsp; If you were in Minnesota, this would be a moot issue.&nbsp; You have to know English to run a business, bottom line, because virtually no one from your vendors to your customers, speaks anything but English.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, in NYC, if you own a bodega, say, many of your customers will be Spanish speakers and even your vendors might all speak Spanish, which was the case at the bodega I helped in.&nbsp; In any case, there&#039;s so many languages being spoken by the customers as well, that just knowing English is not enough.&nbsp; It might not be perfect, but without the hard work and entrepreneur drive of many of the immigrants, who would own all of the business that they occupy or do all of the work that they do?&nbsp; Many (not all, of course) of the English speaking business owners left NYC and bought a house in the &#039;burbs.&nbsp; Something that many of these same immigrants in NYC hope for as well!&nbsp; My friend&#039;s brother-in-law who used to own three bodegas in the Bronx, now owns a successful small business in Rockland county 9he was actually one of the financial backers of my friend&#039;s bodega on 36th Ave).&nbsp; He&#039;s living the American dream, Dominican style!<br />

				I apologize if I offended anybody.&nbsp; Astoria Luv, thank you for providing such a detailed response and making some important points.&nbsp; I guess I wasn&#039;t really thinking, just expressing some frustration about having difficulty ordering from some places.&nbsp; Food delivery is an area where the barrier makes a difference.&nbsp; My dry cleaners speak minimal english and that is not a problem.&nbsp; They are very friendly and do a great job.&nbsp; I also have waxing done at a salon where the person doing this does not speak English, and it&#039;s fine.&nbsp; The person at the salon who makes the appointments speaks English and Spanish, so there is never a problem communicating.&nbsp; I used to frequent a chinese food restaurant where the owner&#039;s son spoke English and took all the orders.&nbsp; Hiring someone who speaks both languages, even a young teenager, would help bring in more business, if the resources to do that are there.

				Newastorian,<br /><br />No problem.&nbsp; I understand where you are coming from. In fact, I almost had a &quot;Falling Down&quot; moment when I tried to order something at a Korean deli when I first moved to NYC in 1990.&nbsp; I practically screamed at the owner that he should learn English because he was &quot;making us all look bad.&quot;&nbsp; I have since apologized, but I realized how stupid I must have looked, especially considering the fact that I&#039;m Korean.&nbsp; <br /><br />I still get a little impatient when I go to my local deli and I have to repeat myself because he doesn&#039;t understand me.&nbsp; However, when I needed credit the owner didn&#039;t hesitate to give it to me.&nbsp; <br />

				- When people double park in front of wide open parking spots and block off traffic. I live by a bakery and dry cleaner. There are always people &quot;Just running in&quot;, who can&#039;t be bothered to park their vehicle, so they double park in front of a wide open space- this also applies to fire hydrant spaces. Leaving an unattended vehicle in the middle of the street is just as dangerous as blocking off a fire hydrant. <br /><br />- Tough guys. I hate guys who always have something to prove and have to be ready to fight everyone including their grandma. Living my McCanns, I see my fair share of these guys on the regular. <br /><br />- People who walk too slow during rush hour and block off the staircase in the process. I have missed many a train as a result of these jerks.

				Hey KidMurdock! I for one would love to hear your controversial views! I probably agree with most of them! Yeah, I&#039;ve been falling for that global warming, going green blather too. I bought some flourescent bulbs to replace my incandescent bulbs and lo and behold I hear they are chock full of mercury and that you have to dispose of them in a certain way and that if you drop them on the carpet and they shatter you have to cut out a 6x6 piece of the carpet and open all your windows to air out the rooms, don&#039;t vaccuum the mess! They give off radiation (!), after 4 hours of continuous use the cost savings are negated...I&#039;d like to see how fellow New Yorkers are going to abide by the rules of disposing these dangerous little mercury bombs! Many don&#039;t even bother recycling their cans, paper, and plastic! <br /><br />And yes, pedestrians. Please Yield to the Right-especially when going up and down subway steps, and you walkers at the track- stay in the right lanes marked &quot;Walk&quot; at the track-you know like right lanes on the highway for the slow-pokes?!

				It&#039;s a nasty word and idea, and entirely accurate.&nbsp; I find it less insulting than the actual concept of white kids mimicking the most absolute inane, silly, stereotypical and insulting aspects of ghetto culture.&nbsp; The word is dead on, which is why it makes people feel so uncomfortable.&nbsp; (I first heard it in the early 90s, when the nephew of a friend in Delaware used it to describe the kids in his high school going through these motions for the first time.&nbsp; His reaction was to become a huge Misfits/punk rock fan, complete with purple mohawk.)<br /><br />I felt like Handyman about 10 years ago, when this nonsense seemed to be at its absolute apex.&nbsp; And most of the definitions have it wrong in isolating this as the trend of wealthier suburban white kids.&nbsp; I&#039;ve surely seen plenty of rural and working-class kids going there, too.&nbsp; Just about every white kid in Astoria I was coming across in 1997!<br /><br />What I&#039;ve seen and realized since then is that this is just a phase for most kids, usually right after professional wrestling, and just before the stark realization that acting this way isn&#039;t going to get them laid in college, thus the sensitive Dave Matthews Band (now Jack Johnson) frat boy phase ensues thereafter.&nbsp; Its a phase, and a regrettable one at that, unless there are millions of 30-year-old, stone-faced white guys out there with size 58 pants, XXXXL Oakland Raiders football jerseys, sideways visors, etc.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s a real odd mix of emotional development (hopefully not stunted), white self loathing and, let&#039;s face it, a sense of &quot;coolness&quot; as it does readily offend parents and serve as a sort of code to other kids who indulge.&nbsp; My anger turned to befuddled amusement a long time, but that applies to a lot more things than this.

				More of the crap that grinds my gears:<br /><br />- Outsourced Customer Service- When I call US Air, I expect to speak to someone from the freaking US, not &quot;Jane&quot; from Mumbai.&nbsp; God knows if my flight to Austin will actually get me to Austin...<br /><br />- Loud Weight Lifters- Yes, I know you are very strong, and so manly, but it sounds like you&#039;re passing a watermelon, and everyone thinks your a total jackhole.&nbsp; <br /><br />- Duane Reade - Every freaking store has no less than 6 registers, yet there are NEVER more than 2 people running said registers.&nbsp; Not at 9AM, not at noon, not at 9PM.&nbsp; Why not just take out 4 registers and stop toying with us.<br /><br />- Juice Called Water: Mineral Water, is not water, it&#039;s juice, s___, it&#039;s not even juice, it&#039;s drink.&nbsp; Sure, there&#039;s water in there, but the other two ingredients? Sugar and purple. <br /><br />- Commercials With Non-Humans That Act Like Humans: If I walked into a room and there were a shitload of lizards dancing to Thriller, I wouldn&#039;t dance along.&nbsp; I&#039;d grab the broom and get to whacking, and when I was done, I&#039;d call the exterminator.&nbsp; And don&#039;t get me started on that talking Mucinex booger.&nbsp; Or the eloquent toe fungus.&nbsp; Why?<br /><br />- Text Messaging While We&#039;re Hanging Out: You called me to hang out, but you&#039;re going to sit there and type on your stupid phone to your other jerk friends who aren&#039;t even here?&nbsp; Why am I wasting my time?<br /><br />- Text Messaging in General: A phone call requires 15 seconds maybe 9 keystrokes and if there&#039;s confusion, it can be sorted out in several seconds.&nbsp; Conversely, a text message requires a person to stare at a miniscule screen, bang on keys for days, and 400 messages back and forth to get the point across.&nbsp; This is a prime example of technology making things more difficult than they should be.&nbsp; It&#039;s like battery powered scissors.&nbsp; And the jackholes who walk and text, and then get pissed at me for walking into them.&nbsp; Maybe YOU should pay attention to where you&#039;re walking and not to your idiot phone.<br /><br />- Natch: 1) It sounds like snatch.&nbsp; Take that as you will. 2) Naturally sounds better. 3) Naturally isn&#039;t even that long to begin with.&nbsp; The amount of time you saved omitting the &quot;urally&quot; can now be used to send text messages.

				The landlords who don&#039;t want to take care of their building, but complain all of the time about the cost of owning it. &nbsp;Unlesss you inherited the building, nobody forced you to buy it! <br /><br />In one building in Astoria, the skylight had holes in it and when it rained the water would form a puddle on the landing outside of my apartment door. &nbsp;His solution was to give me a mop and told me to take care of it.<br /><br />After some time, however, he finally got around to fixing the roof, but not until we had a virtual waterfall going down on our stairs. &nbsp;I&#039;m surprised he didn&#039;t blame me for not mopping fast enough.<br /><br />And by the way, I know that there are a lot of responsible landlords who want to do right by their tenants and end up getting screwed by them or the costs of owning a building. &nbsp;I&#039;m just talking about the slumlords here and I&#039;ve had a couple.

				An addendum to my earlier post re: finding all sorts of strange garbage on my landlord&#039;s sidewalk.&nbsp; The holy grail of dumping found its way to her sidewalk yesteray morning: a toilet.&nbsp; Surrounded by black garbage bags filled with broken bathroom tile.&nbsp; To go with the 15 other bags of broken bathroom tile (each weighing 30-40 lbs) left on her sidewalk on Saturday night.<br /><br />I know it&#039;s the people next door, who are gutting an apartment, without the aid of a rented dumpster in front of their house.&nbsp; I saw the toilet in front of their house two weeks ago, along with the black bags with tile spilling out.&nbsp; (They must have stashed the debris in their garage to wait for the right night to dump.)&nbsp; I&#039;ve told her this, repeatedly, especially yesterday morning, but she won&#039;t listen.&nbsp; I think one of the guys who lives there works in construction, may be refurbishing one of the apartments there, is too cheap to rent a dumpster, so he figures, just dump it on the old lady&#039;s sidewalk, that guy who lives over there will &quot;take care&quot; of it.<br /><br />As if on cue, an hour later, the sanitation police show up and start writing her a ticket.&nbsp; She flies out her front door and goes into full-on wailing old Greek lady mode -- weeping, lashing her shoulders with rosary beeds, hands raised to the sky.&nbsp; As well she should have.&nbsp; She was about to get ticketed $150 (at least) for construction debris dumped on her sidewalk that wasn&#039;t hers ... with no end in sight in terms of the dumping, which has been happening now about once a week, always late at night.&nbsp; The officer wrote the ticket and drove off, despite the obvious fact that this woman had nothing to do with an old toilet and about 200 lbs of broken tile dumped on her sidewalk.<br /><br />I guess his conscience got the better of him.&nbsp; He came back 15 minutes later, tore up the ticket and gave her two phone numbers to contact the sanitation police directly should this happen again (it will, even if the creep next door stops doing this - lived there a decade now, and trash gets dumped there periodically, although not like clockwork the way it has lately).&nbsp; Half hour later, a truck came by and picked up the junk.&nbsp; By the time I got home, sidewalk was clear, and the landlord took half an hour to tell me what happened.&nbsp; Still thinks the folks next door are free and clear, when I know they&#039;re not.&nbsp; But at least they now know sanitation police are creeping around her property and may be less likely to dump again.&nbsp; So, while the problem has resolved itself for now, still doesn&#039;t sit well with me that I&#039;m living next door to a scumbag.&nbsp; Welcome to Astoria!

				No permits in the window, no nothing.&nbsp; I&#039;m letting it go, because I don&#039;t want to create bad blood for my landlord and her neighbor.&nbsp; The old man who owns the building, and lives there, appears to be in poor health ... and I don&#039;t think it&#039;s his fault what&#039;s been going on with the illegal dumping.&nbsp; When it gets warm out, he comes over and sits on my landlord&#039;s stoop, and they prattle on about the old days, in Greek.&nbsp; (Both their spouses have passed on.)&nbsp; I&#039;d hate to turn one of the few key relationships she has in her life sour because I have a problem with the construction douchebag living on one of his floors.&nbsp; I pretty much caught those vibes form this guy LONG before this, and can live with that -- just glad she and I know what to do now when/if this happens again.&nbsp; Surely a much better scenario than my initial impulse: beat this guy with a baseball bat.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather not go there, but try waking up one morning to a toilet bowl dumped on your front walk!

				Lack of communication between temp agencies and the companies who use them. My three-week assignment ends today and noone in the company said anything ever about me staying on, yet the guy at the temp agency reads me the riot act for &quot;not giving notice&quot; when i said I needed him to mail me a check cuz I&#039;m moving. How are you supposed to give notice on a job that has an expiration date? The agent said that the assignment could go on longer, but the woman who supervises me just told me that they <em>aren&#039;t </em> going to hire anyone full time right now and the assignment <em>is </em> ending. I mean, I deserve notice, too, don&#039;t I? This is the first time I&#039;ve ever temped, and no one really explained the rules to me...besides, when I got here, they said I would be here FOR THREE WEEKS! And yet somehow I was supposed to act as if I would be working here indefinitely? Enough with the mixed messages!!!!

				Sometimes it&#039;s faster to use a credit card.&nbsp; The person using it needs to have it ready to go, and then step aside and wait for the receipt to sign.&nbsp; Fumbling around for cash takes much longer--especially people counting out change!&nbsp; At least people rarely pay with checks any more--now THAT takes a long time.

				<strong>This has been LONG overdue, but the workers in the C Town supermarket have sparked a gear grinding for almost the time when they hired people<br />to bust balls (if not migrains). <br /><br />Case in point: An old lady was observing/helping people during last December to make sure they get used to the new &quot;load up and pay&quot; machines without waiting<br />for a long time in line. As I was putting my food in the bag, she came up and complained that I put too much food, causing the computer to not<br />recognize the actual things inside the bag (two containers of Tropicana, two loaves of bread. How easy is that?!). Then I told her that since all of them<br />were scanned the weight was just the same as the computer analyzed it. <br /><br />Suddenly, the machine made its own error and had to be restarted manually. The old lady complained even more and tried to act as if I destroyed it. I simply<br />told her that &quot;if I destroyed it, your manager would have called a technician to repair it already&quot;, countering her rant in a nonchalant way. I simply continued<br />my food bagging, completely ignoring all of her rants until I paid the machine the total, picked up my change and simply told her that :if Santa came her way<br />to remind him to give you a new pair of dentures and a bag of coal for your fireplace&quot;. <br /><br />She stood silent and didn&#039;t say anything after that as I left the supermarket. <br /><br />Not to say that it&#039;d happen everyday of the hour in C Town, but I&#039;d be aware about their attitude in the future, especially how they sometimes aren&#039;t helpful in finding the proper ingredients needed to cook. Molasses anyone?</strong>

Then he will make sure he is smack in the middle of the doors when the train pulls in. Once again never mind if you are standing there, or if you moved to the side to exiting passengers can exit. He will then plow his fat ass into the train, through the people coming out, pushing through the people who cluster at the back door to get out at 34th street and will knock an old lady down just to get a seat.

The enlargement can cause irritation to the scrotum and upper inner thigh. Some men have discomfort in tight clothes and underpants. Other men may dislike the cosmetic appearance of the hanging scrotum. <br /><br />I have developed a scrotum reduction procedure that reduces the side of the scrotum while maintaining the normal shape. This operation is performed as an outpatient in about 11/2 to 2 hours. Most men return to work in 4-5 days. The discomfort is resolved, and the cosmetic appearance is improved (SEE PHOTOS).&nbsp; For more info: <br /><br /><br />The person that shoves right into me is going to end up being shoved back.<br /><br />The bus driver that slams on the brakes is going to have my hell slam on his head.<br /><br /><br />ARGH... :lol: :-o

				Equally annoying is when the train is relatively empty and when you go to get on nobody will move in and people insist on standing in front of the doors. The other day it was pissing the rain, the train stops at Broadway and the doors open and nobody wants to move the f*** in. <br /><br />&nbsp;I say &quot;excuse me&quot; once politely, if you don&#039;t move over or out of the way you are going to get bumped into.&nbsp;

				This one happened to me last night, though it happens all the time: evening rush hour, people piled up on the platform, waiting for the train doors to open, and as soon as they do, ONE person feels it is OK to push, bump, and step on the 10 people ahead her (sorry, but in my experience it&#039;s my fellow females who are guilty of this one) to get to the lone empty seat.&nbsp; BUT JUST FOR ONE STOP. ON THE LOCAL TRAIN.&nbsp; I mean, if you are getting on at City Hall and taking it all the way to Ditmars, then OK, I feel your pain.&nbsp; But from Lex/59 to Queensboro?&nbsp; COME ON!!<br /><br />In the grand scheme, not a huge deal, but it is one of my greatest subway peeves.

				*When I stand up before the subway stops and I&#039;m the first one at the door, and yet some jerk feels the need to push me before the doors open. Um, isn&#039;t it obvious that I&#039;m planning on exiting as well? This happens often on crosstown buses too. <br />*When there is an obvious line to get on the train and someone just has to get one more spot ahead, so they push in front of you, even if the train is empty and it&#039;s obvious everyone will get a seat. This happened to me today and I sent the jerk into the freaking door. I had just failed a math final exam, don&#039;t mess. <br />*People with kids on the subway or bus who are punching you in the head or doing something equally as annoying and the parents see it and don&#039;t do anything. <br />*People who think they walk normally while checking their phone/iPod. Yeah, your speed just decreased dramatically and suddenly, causing me to run into you. Seriously, these people need a video replay of how they virtually drop dead the second the phone comes out, and it&#039;s normally while exiting the subway, and it&#039;s normally on a staircase, a crowded one, and it causes a major human pile-up. <br />*High school students who think they are tough and mess with everyone they can.<br />*People who insist on saying crap to me when I&#039;m minding my own business. This is NYC, I&#039;m on public transportation going to work, if I wanted to have a conversation I&#039;d have taken a taxi and talked on my phone. I&#039;m not going to suck your penis no matter how many times you tell me I have pretty eyes on the N train. <br />*Even worse is the above, only thing when people feel the need to comment on how you look sad. Mind your own business, if I actually was sad and wanted to talk about it I&#039;d have gone to a therapist!<br />*When the N train waits for five 7 trains at Queensboro Plaza during morning rush hour even though the N is packed. Then there&#039;s always some idiot who thinks that despite the swarm of petite people waiting for the next train because they can&#039;t fit in the car, their oversized ass will somehow fit.<br />*When I&#039;m sitting on an outside seat on the subway and some dude leans his ass against the rail, essentially rubbing his ass on my shoulder. This guy was having a conversation once and was obliviously doing this, so I poked him so he realized his ass was in my face despite the train being virtually empty, but he did it again so I pinched his ass and freaked him out.

				When you go to get on a train at Astoria/Ditmars, there is a little LED sign that points either left or right to &quot;next train.&quot; But it doesn&#039;t fricking matter, 3 out of 5 times I&#039;ve taken the train, I got on the one it was pointing to, but five (or ten) minutes later, someone is telling me that the muffled voice on the intercom just said we had to get off and get on the OTHER train. And what&#039;s even more special is that there is only a five second window between the announcement, and when they start closing the train doors. <br /><br />I did my first yelling at the conductor over that yesterday. am i a new yorker yet?

				That LED sign used to be my nemesis.&nbsp; I went to high school in the city, and would take the train from Ditmars each morning.&nbsp; <br /><br />One morning, I made sure to get to the station especially early, as I had day one of a two day Spanish final...my first class at 8:15 am, and I wanted to be sure I got there comfortably on time.&nbsp; I got to the station, and there were two trains at the platform, so I got on the train that the sign was indicating, along with everyone else.&nbsp; After about 5 or 10 minutes with no announcement, suddenly some people notice that the LED sign is now pointing to the other train, across the platform, and those who were still coming up the stairs were getting on that train.&nbsp; So most people got up and went in that train as well.<br /><br />A few minutes later, and everyone got into that train, the LED sign changed back to the first train, and those who were coming up the stairs started going onto that train, so we followed them back to the first train.&nbsp; This was accompanied by an announcement, in the second train, saying that the train across the platform would be the first train to leave.<br /><br />After sitting in the first train again for a few minutes, and with time on my end getting dangerously short with my final looming, suddenly the LED sign changed back again to the second train...a handful of people coming up the stairs rushed in, made it into that train, but the rest of us on the first train didn&#039;t get out in time...the doors closed and the train pulled out of the station...no announcement!&nbsp; <br /><br />I really let the conductor have it as the train was leaving the station.&nbsp; Of course, it took another 10 or so minutes for the next train to leave, and coupled with the slowness that is the Lexington Avenue line, I missed more than half of the first part of the final.&nbsp; Even better, I wasn&#039;t given the opportunity to make it up, so of course my final grade reflected the MTA&#039;s incompetence that morning&nbsp; :cry:

				Long overdue to have the nutty N/W dichotomy at Ditmars in the morning rush noted.&nbsp; Used to be they&#039;d automatically send one train out after another, but there&#039;s very little rhyme or reason now as to which train goes first.&nbsp; The only hard fast rule I can sense: a vast majority of the time, if there&#039;s an N and W in the station, the N will leave first.&nbsp; Get the impression they have to fire out two of them for every W in the morning rush.<br /><br />Another good rule: let&#039;s say one train is just about full and getting ready to leave, so you decide you want a seat and wait for the next.&nbsp; When the next pulls in, and you get on, if the conductor states: &quot;Doors will close on this train until the next scheduled departure time&quot; ... get off.&nbsp; Because from what I&#039;ve seen, a vast majority of the time, that train will sit there and let the next load up and leave first ... often while keeping its doors closed and trapping those unfortunate people inside who hopped on early.&nbsp; (Although that nice older white guy who cleans the trains will often pop a door open, sensing the insanity of his bosses.)&nbsp; Of course, even if the doors pop open on that &quot;first&quot; train to let people out, it will always be only after the leaving train has already filled with passengers.<br /><br />It&#039;s a ludicrous situation that these *ssclowns have done nothing to address -- get the impression they think it&#039;s funny when you see the quizzical looks on their faces as they walk to their trains.&nbsp; They could EASILY announce which train will be leaving first as each train leaves.&nbsp; Then again, how many times have I sat there to hear the station manager clearly intone over the loudspeaker: &quot;Conducter, please close the doors on our train&quot; ... only to have the doors sit there open for close to a minute afterwards.<br /><br />I&#039;ve toyed with the idea of leaving for work an hour early and hitting the gym.&nbsp; I&#039;ve noticed the radical difference between trains leaving at, say, 7:15 as opposed to 8:15: day and night.&nbsp; The early trains are much less crowded and seem to leave on a rational schedule.&nbsp; The after-8 trains have become totally nuts: leaving on irrational time schedules (how many times have you sat on a train filling to capacity with passengers at Ditmars, seemingly minutes behind schedule), packed to the gills by 30th Ave, just a gnarly ride these days in light of the increased # of passengers using it these days.&nbsp; Man, I can remember when 36th Ave was a ghost stop -- it&#039;s getting to be like Broadway in terms of passenger load.&nbsp; <br /><br />All I know is these discussions on giving seats to pregnant women ... most mornings, the train is so uncomfortably crowded that I don&#039;t even look up from my seat, recognizing that it would be an enormous hassle to give my seat to anyone.&nbsp; Much less the pregnant woman on crutches who&#039;s carrying six bags who always seems to get on my car and hover directly over me.&nbsp; Hitting on pretty girls, not a problem either.&nbsp; I judge women by their knees these days on the train.
