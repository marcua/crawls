				There were a lot of fire trucks at the intersection of Broadway and 31st today at around 9 -9:30am.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t see any fire though and the trains were still running.&nbsp; Does anyone know what was going on?

				There was an &quot;all hands&quot; fire call at 30-13 Broadway.&nbsp; Oh crap, that&#039;s Sanfords!&nbsp; <br /><br />http://gothamist.com/labs/map<br /><br />I actually heard the fire engines all morning.&nbsp;

				There was a fire towards the back of the building in one of the apartments.&nbsp; You could see the smoke earlier on, but I don&#039;t think anyone was hurt and they put it out.&nbsp; Lots of firetrucks, and they put at least 3 ladders on the roof.&nbsp; The stores below were fine.

				Sanford&#039;s has a sign on the window that says they will be closed the next couple of weeks due to a kitchen fire.&nbsp; Yikes.

				Ouch - they&#039;re a good place, though I admit I don&#039;t go there often (Michael&#039;s down the street on Broadway is closer to me).&nbsp; Sanford&#039;s is very community minded.

				I guess because the kitchen was in the way back, that was why I didn&#039;t see the fire in Sanford&#039;s.&nbsp; You could see smoke in the back of the building on 31St, and with all the fire truck ladders on the roof and towards the back of the blg, it made it look like it was one of the apartments.&nbsp; There were lots of firemen on the roof, but I didn&#039;t notice any going into Sanford&#039;s or the other shops at all.

				I didn&#039;t realize anything had happened at Sanford&#039;s until I read this thread.&nbsp; I also hope they&#039;ll be back soon.
