				I&#039;ve heard of church planting before.&nbsp; I&#039;m from the bible belt and the desert where churches are about the only thing that grow well.&nbsp; Typically church planting is a bit like a business starting a franchise.&nbsp; A larger church organization determines there is a need in a particular area and sets out to establish a presence there.<br /><br />I expect the &quot;target demographic&quot; bit is because 20-30 year olds are becoming the lost generation as far as churches go.&nbsp; The older folks still attend church so there is a focus on finding ways to attract younger folks.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t think there is anything wrong with the idea or the demographic target -- nor does church planting necessarily mean the scientologists are coming to town.&nbsp; <br /><br />-j

				I think the 2/1 means two bedroom and 1 bathroom. I think that you can find something in your price range pretty easily. $1700 would actually get you a fairly spacious 2 bedroom apartment.<br /><br />As far as the church planting thing goes - I&#039;ll second Jayme&#039;s description of it. I am also from the Bible Belt and grew up in a religion that does this sort of thing. Now that I am more of an agnostic bent I wouldn&#039;t mind seeing something that is less &quot;churchy&quot; and more community-oriented. I like hillary10&#039;s idea of unitarian or atheist or just basic non-denominational (but non-denominational that includes all faiths/beliefs, not just Christian-focused).

				Wow the reply to this was more than I was expecting. <br /><br />The &quot;2/1&quot; is referring to a 2 bedroom, 1 bath. We have 1700 a month to spend for housing there. Do you think that we can find a place for that amount that will let us have our lazy bulldog?&nbsp; We need something that has a nice, big kitchen and a comfortable living room.<br /><br />As for the &quot;church planting,&quot; we hope to establish little groups that connect each week in groups of 3, 12, and 60. then monthly with 240. <br /><br />The groups of 3 (Doing Life Together groups, DLT&#039;s) are people just getting coffee, talking about life and how God is intersecting in the daily context of being and creating each individual to be better husbands, wives, brothers, sisters, moms, dads, friends and you name it. The groups of 12 (community groups) will connect to serve and love on the community of Astoria as a whole, people who live out the teachings of Jesus to help those in the community connect relationally with a loving God. Then once a week 5 &quot;community groups&quot; will meet in a centralized location to listen to how God is working, loving and connecting through the service projects in Astoria. The cool thing about this is the organic DNA of each group is built on relationships, people connecting with people, and people connecting with God. We want to see each person plug into God, so that they can become who they are naturally wired to be. <br /><br />I know that&#039;s a long description, but in short we want to &quot;serve God through loving people.&quot; We believe that everyone belongs to God, and hope that as they begin to connect with Jesus relationally that they will subscribe to the concept that he was divinity in human form and was perfect, and in turn, hope that those concepts propel people forward to become what they were always intended be... people living, learning and loving in community with others for God.<br /><br />People like Jesus, they just can&#039;t tolerate Christians and can&#039;t seem to see how Jesus can put up with them as well.<br /><br />I hope people will try not to misconstrue our intentions. We are not moving to the area to tell people they need a doctrine or to place blame or guilt. There are enough Christians in the world for that matter, that already give people, including myself, a headache. My wife and I live to see people living out Christ&#039;s teachings, because that means issues like 80% of the deaths in Africa due to waterborne diseases will slowly decline because people care more about others than themselves. We don&#039;t want to see people &quot;Coming to or Doing&quot; church, again there are enough selfish-Christians already doing that. We want to see those who subscribe to Jesus&#039; teachings, externalize their lives, live for others and help people connect with God.<br /><br />Lastly, we hope to identify with those who feel like there is more to living than just for ourselves by doing church and that is that we should Be the Church and love on others as Jesus did. In short, we want to be Jesus to Astoria and are inviting others to do the same.

				Nycmacuser and Jayme, <br /><br />hey sorry if I was confusing. What would you like for me to explain. I hope you didn&#039;t take offense to the demographic. I hope you understand that it is more of a heart age issue than chronological age. At the gathering here in Lakeland, I have a guy that hangs out regularly with his wife who are in their 60&#039;s and retired, but just as youthful and full of ambition and risk taking as those not tied down to make others a priority over themselves. <br /><br />This is great dialogue. The essence of the church plant in or around Astoria is that those who subscribe to the teachings of Christ are to give themselves away to see that others may connect with God as they have. It probably is my fault for not communicating properly. Does this help at all? Phil. 2:1-11.

				I hope you guys will go back and read my posts about what we are looking to do, &quot;Serve God through loving people.&quot;<br /><br />Unfortunately, the denomination that we planted our first church through have made some ridiculous and trite campaigns against certain demographics. I am sorry for their actions, I am sorry for those of you who have been hurt and are hurting now and that you harbour ill feelings towards my family because of association. I do think it is ironic, but I am glad that you have passions for issues and topics that interest you, but don&#039;t treat me or my family for wanting to move there and just do life with you the way you have been mistreated, please. I&#039;m a 27 year old recovering newsroom junkie (reporter and editor) turned church planter and my wife is a 26 year old 8th grade algebra teacher, who wants to be a professional chef, and we happen to be Christ followers that want to see others connect with the same teacher, Jesus. <br /><br />I think what I am saying and the message that we are living out is substantially different than what most have heard from Christians over the last 50-60 years, and I would argue that Jesus made it aware to the world his thoughts of religious people being condesending on humanity. The great thing is that we are all one in voice regarding the degradation of various people by the church. I am not the value giver, I only know the value that was placed in all of humanity when Jesus came and walked among us showing the world that trust, love and respect are to be freely given. Moreover, that he loves us more than we can ever imagine. I&#039;m sorry if that makes a lot if his wannabe followers jerks because they have to cast down verdicts on others to make themselves feel more worthy of his grace. This is not who I want to be, nor who I am right now.<br /><br />We hope the residents of Astoria will embrace us as much as we will live to love and serve them in hopes that they too will desire to become students of Jesus as well.

				I would go through a broker. There are a couple of threads that deal with that topic. Search broker.<br /><br />But I guess I&#039;m still not clear on the answer: Will this church be open and friendly to gay people and lesbians? I wasn&#039;t clear on that from your post.

				My best advice to you is to talk with brokers (we&#039;ve worked with Metropolis in the Ditmars area) and/or look on craigslist. On occasion people will post apartments on here, but I wouldn&#039;t rely on the apartment listings on Astorians.<br /><br />Like I said in my previous post $1700 will get you a good 2 bedroom, but for that I guarantee that you could find a nice little 3 bedroom as well.<br /><br />Good luck to you. I understand where you are coming from, but as you can tell not everyone will be enthusiastic to participate - although a few might be willing to give it a try! Again - good luck.

				It sounds like the church will be at least non-hostile, if not open to LGBT members, unless I&#039;m reading the posts wrong.&nbsp; While I&#039;m an active Lutheran, I think more churches in the neighborhood is a good thing.&nbsp; Good luck with your apartment search!

				Wasabisam, <br /><br />would you be willing to look around for us as you go to and from the train. Anything you see posted possibly jot it down and then message me with the number/s.<br /><br />that would be awesome if you could. Thanks in advance and enjoy the book, The Secret Supper. I really enjoy suspense novels like that. Have you checked out The Rule of Four?

				Gravity,<br /><br />There is a thread on finding a broker (and broker suggestions).&nbsp; Your price range is reasonable but it&#039;s very very difficult to find an apartment without a broker and even more difficult to find one without a broker without being here.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d also advise against paying 1 year in full.&nbsp; Most landlords would jump at this chance but a few months rent in advance should be sufficient.&nbsp; Paying for a year opens you up to the possibility that your landlord might not turn out to be *the best* in the end.&nbsp; If you end up with a slumlord who neglects to provide/correct problems with heat/hot water -- you&#039;d be left with no real recourse.&nbsp; I believe withholding rent is in some instances allowed under NY housing law if a landlord neglects to maintain basic living necessities (heat/hot water/electric).<br /><br />Anyhow definitely look into it a bit before you mention it to your broker or your prospective landlord.<br /><br />-j

				thanks, that bit of info is good to know. <br /><br />Other than brokers does anyone have the numbers or addys for property management companys in the vacinity. it would be great to cut out the brokers and save some money to pay for the wife&#039;s culinary school bill. <br /><br />Erick

				As jayme said ... it&#039;s increasingly hard to find apartments in Astoria without going through a broker. The few managment companies around are really broker/management companies offering little distinction.<br /><br />And I also agree it&#039;s unwise to offer paying a year in full. This will leave you open to being taken advantage of. But it&#039;s appears that you and your wife will probably not be working, at least full-time, and a landlord may be reluctant to rent to you without secure work references (plus you have a dog which makes it more difficult). If you find this the case then it may end up that you&#039;ll have to offer one or two months extra security.<br /><br />Do you have any contacts in a more established church in the area? -- maybe someone can put the word out for you.<br /><br />And if I may ask: Why have you selected Astoria to start your church? It&#039;s not like the neighborhood is lacking in ecclesiastical ventures. I&#039;m curious to know why you think you&#039;ll have a chance of success here.

				Gravity, I just wanted to say welcome to Astoria and good luck to you and your wife (in advance).&nbsp; Although maybe unintentional, perhaps it is better that you don&#039;t get into your personal beliefs on this forum.&nbsp; Gay rights do not seem to be central to the work you want to do in Astoria, and shouldn&#039;t have to define or cloud up your mission.&nbsp; I think volunteerism -ie - helping out those less fortunate in Africa and elsewhere - is a wonderful issue to want to focus more attention on.&nbsp; And too many Christian groups have been all too vocal about gay and abortion issues, and because of this, end up spreading a message about hate instead of love.&nbsp; I applaud your efforts to get past that image, and accomplish something more meaningful.&nbsp; Good luck.

				Hi there! <br /><br />Re the planting of a church, not sure if you know, but there&#039;s already a Presbyterian church that&#039;s being doing this in Astoria for the last several years, and they&#039;ve been quite successful based on the number of people I&#039;ve seen in there. You can learn more at: http://www.astoriachurch.org/&nbsp; So I don&#039;t know if that helps or hurts your idea, but thought you&#039;d want to know. The reverend who runs it is quite nice.<br /><br />They currently hold services in our synagogue, I guess until they can find a more permanent building?

				BIBLE BELTERS??<br /><br />Hey - I&#039;m in Astoria, from the Bible Belt (the buckle, to be exact). New York&#039;s a nice breath of fresh air, in my opinion. Kind of suffocating in the Belt. Anyone concur?<br /><br />Libby :wink:

				yah, i&#039;d agree also. then again i hear church bells all day long regardless.<br /><br />i did mention i was from north carolina way back, and i&#039;m pretty much 100% against anything associated with &quot;southern baptist&quot;... pretty much the reason i&#039;d consider myself agnostic/atheist in the first place, or at least disassociated from the organized religion sect. <br /><br />so in short yeah, i was amazed, and absolutely impressed by the overall tone of our forums response to this Gravity guy&#039;s request to start a (missionary style, money making) cult in our happy little Astoria.
