				Hi, I thought it might be fun and useful to start a thread of recipe suggestions for this week&#39;s produce! I just finished baking (and am waiting for to cool) a rhubarb bread/cake recipe that I originally got from the CSA cookbook that&#39;ll be organizing a group order of. (Wow, that is one grammatically disasterous sentence!) It&#39;s really sweet and tasty, and is a great change of pace from the (doubtless fantastic) strawberry-rhubarb pie that I know everyone else is making this week! I&#39;ve posted the recipe here (http://harrissmithrecipes.xwiki.com/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Rhubarb+Cake)...

				The bread recipe looks awesome!<br /><br />I didn&#39;t have time to bake bread so I washed about half the red leaf, added some shaved radish, cut up a few chives, and crumbled the flowers into a salad.&nbsp; Added olive oil and a little bit of balsamic for a vinegrette, salted, tossed, and ate yum yum.&nbsp; The chives have a nice spice to them and the flowers are good good.&nbsp; Could have been less conservative and added more flowers (the plan for tomorrow) and the flavor was strong enough to require very little dressing.<br /><br />I may make a rhubard compote (rhubarb, sugar, lemon cooked down) to freeze as I&#39;m leaving town shortly and am not sure I&#39;ll make it through everything before I go.<br /><br />Leeks will be tomorrow&#39;s dinner.<br /><br />The strawberries, of course, are little bits of desert all during the day and won&#39;t last too long.

				Thanks, JD.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D&nbsp; I promise to be more explanatory in the future.&nbsp; When I created this recipe I used all the edible parts of the leek, going into the green until the texture changed.&nbsp; And even towards the top, you can use the under layers quite high up.&nbsp; Using white beans also means that the colour of the soup tends a bit more towards tan than really white, but then again, it&#39;s a riff.&nbsp; &nbsp;8-)<br /><br />And I also clean them as JD described.&nbsp; It never ceases to amaze me how far in the dirt can get.

				Yeah, that recipe sounds great, lanseaux.&nbsp; I love the white bean thing.&nbsp; A creative twist on a classic.&nbsp; I have to admit that I actually prefer leek soups hot, though, which of course makes it even less like vichyssoise.&nbsp; <br /><br />I love it when people ask food questions on here.&nbsp; It makes me feel like I know something.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D&nbsp; It&#39;s also sad that I know as much as I do about cleaning leeks.&nbsp; I couldn&#39;t tell you who&#39;s in the senate, but I can clean ya a leek!!

				Great recipe! I love them leeks and I like to clean them the Lazy Woman&#39;s Way (which is also quite effective when you&#39;re also prepping lots of other stuff in the kitchen): <br /><br />Cut as described, then rise briefly, then immerse all the cut layers into a sinkful of cold clear water. Agitate briefly (leeks are pretty hearty) and let them soak for a bit as you do other things. The leeks float to the top and all the silty sandy dirt falls to the bottom of the sink. You might have to really separate some of those layers to get down deep but I find this technique works really well. No grit.<br />I also like to make a traditional vichyssoise with <strong>asparagus</strong> (peeled fat ones, not skinny) blended in (use a stick blender in the pot or else transfer to blender)... velvety <em>veloute</em>, as the French would say!<br /><br />cheers to the bounties of CSA!<br />&nbsp;

				The rhubarb and leeks are freaking me out a little.&nbsp; I&#39;ve never cooked rhubarb before, and the first (and last) time I dealt with leeks was disastrous.&nbsp; I decided that throwing away so much of the green from the leeks was some kind of bourgeois conspiracy, so I cooked the whole dang thing in a soup and threw it in the blender.&nbsp; Tasty, but ... the leek leaves were all hardcore unchewable fibers.&nbsp; I had a miserable time eating it for days.&nbsp; &nbsp;:cry:<br /><br />I threw strawberries and chive flowers into a salad for lunch today, as an experiment.&nbsp; The strawberries take some of the edge off the pepperiness of the flowers, I think.&nbsp; It&#39;s an ... interesting taste.&nbsp; It&#39;s pretty low-stakes as far as experiments go.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and the chives are freaking me out too.&nbsp; <br /><br />This week&#39;s bounty is mostly freaking me out.&nbsp; *hugging lettuce and strawberries in the safety of my bosom*&nbsp; &nbsp;:|<br />

				kickingchicken, <br /><br />sorry to hear of your uncertainties surrounding this week&#39;s share.&nbsp; Chives are oniony, so you can snip them with scissors and sprinkle them over whatever you&#39;re having for a little zip.&nbsp; If you want to mellow the onion taste out a little, add them to whatever your cooking near the end.&nbsp; They&#39;ll cook a little but still add flavour.&nbsp; As for the leeks - try either the recipe I posted earlier, or the braised leek recipe (I think there was a link to it).&nbsp; Braised leeks might sound fancy, but they&#39;re really easy, and really, really delicious.&nbsp; Just make sure you remove the dark green tough-feeling leaves.&nbsp; The lighter green parts that are still shiny are just fine to eat.<br /><br />The most important thing to know about rhubarb is that it needs a lot of sugar or sweetner to make it taste good.&nbsp; And then it&#39;s excellent.&nbsp; Here&#39;s a really simple recipe for rhubarb compote from Epicurious (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/234450):<br /><br />RHUBARB COMPOTE<br /><br />4 cups 1/2-inch pieces fresh rhubarb<br />1 1/2 cups sugar<br />2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice<br /><br />Combine everything in a large saucepan over medium heat, and stir until sugar dissolves.&nbsp; Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until rhubarb is tender, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. Put in a bowl, cover and chill until cold, about 2 hours. Keep refrigerated<br /><br />Makes about 3 cups.

				kickingchicken, &nbsp;do not freak out. &nbsp;You actually came up with a great dish that i&#39;d like to expand upon for you.<br /><br />Recently for a dinner I created a salad:<br />Greens<br />strawberries<br />blackberries<br />goat cheese<br />good salt and black pepper<br />strawberry vinagret with very good olive oil and red wine vinegar.<br /><br />Your salad is right on the money and this weeks csa was perfect. &nbsp;The chive instead of black pepper was a great option and nice color too. &nbsp;Adding some cheese would round out the dish, add some fat (always a good thing) and a lite dressing would give it some zing.<br /><br />So dont freak out, your insticts are fine.

				My rhubarb cake is in the oven, my quinoa is almost ready for my leek creation!&nbsp; Such a food adventure trying to figure out what to do with things.<br /><br />This is only my second CSA year and I spent several weeks last year scratching my head over kale.&nbsp; Yes, kale.&nbsp; It&#39;s simple and fantastic and yet I could not figure out how anyone was supposed to eat it.&nbsp; Rhubarb is a lot trickier than kale.&nbsp; So KC (kingchicken), it&#39;s pretty normal to be overwhelmed right now.&nbsp; I&#39;ve never cooked rhubarb OR leeks before so while I&#39;ve found recipes, it&#39;s still all new to me.<br /><br />You also only really need one bite of success to push on through to the next experiment.&nbsp; My first food this week, salad, was simple and good.&nbsp; Today I want to know what the rest will taste like!

				So, thanks to Jayme, I was inspired to finally tackle quinoa. I have never cooked it before, and we have had some sitting in our cabinet for a while so I decided to take a chance.<br /><br />Here is roughly my version (all thrown together, nothing measured):<br /><br />&gt; Quinoa in the rice maker with some vegetable broth seasoning<br />&gt; 1 leek sauteed in olive oil for a few minutes<br />&gt; Handful of freshly roasted almonds, chopped<br />&gt; A few stalks (?) of chives, plus one flower head torn apart into individual flowers<br />&gt; Bragg&#39;s Liquid Aminos - maybe a couple or three tablespoons (for those of you unfamiliar it is similar to soy sauce, but lower in sodium)<br /><br />So essentially, after cooking the leek for a bit I added the quinoa, the bragg&#39;s, then the chives (including the flowers), and then the almonds and cooked for just a couple minutes more, stirring quite frequently. I tested it and it tasted pretty good. But it is for my lunch tomorrow, so I&#39;ll most certainly know for sure then. ;)<br /><br />I have posted a picture on the flickr group that Vidiot set up...

I wrapped my second loaf in foil then put it in a plastic bag. It might need to be refreshed in a hot oven for 5 minutes after thawing....<br />

				Last night I made, based on a recipe from Epicurious:<br /><br />strawberry rhubarb compote with ginger and lime<br /><br />12 oz. strawberries<br />8 oz. rhubarb<br />5 Tbsp raw sugar<br />1.5 Tbsp minced crystalised ginger<br />1/2 tsp micrograted lime zest<br />juice from 1/2 lime<br /><br />Mix everything together in a 3 qt. pan over med-high heat, stirring almost constantly.&nbsp; After a few minutes there will be quite a bit of juice.&nbsp; Bring the juice to a bare boil and cook for a few more minutes, stirring often.&nbsp; Reduce heat to simmer and cook for ~5 more minutes, until the rhubarb starts to break down.<br /><br />Yields about two cups.&nbsp; It&#39;s sweet enough, but still with a really nice tartness, which suits my non-sweet tooth admirably.&nbsp; I had some as a topping for plain yogurt for dessert.<br />

				Last night I made leek and white bean soup (not quite the same as lanseaux&#39;s, I didn&#39;t have enough leeks). This was a casual throwing things into the pot recipe - cooking the beans, stirring in a sauteed leek, adding veggie broth, adding some sage from the windowsill at the last minute.<br /><br />I tried it with truffle oil and fancy olive oil and shavings of parm (in different helpings - didn&#39;t try both oils at once). It was yummy.<br /><br />I made a strawberry-rhubarb crumble that wasn&#39;t too sweet from &quot;The New Way to Cook.&quot; Tossed strawberry and rhubarb with flour, just a little sugar, and lemon juice. Spread in a thin layer and topped with a mixture of very finely chopped almonds, flour, butter and sugar. It was very nice. I wished I had some creme fraiche to go with.<br /><br />And I made a fabulous salad as well - lettuce with a tomato and some chive blossoms. Nice.

				Well I made Lanseaux&#39;s soup, and it was delicious! For someone who has probably never even looked twice at a leek, I think I handled it okay. I didn&#39;t have enough leek either I think, but I just made it with what I had, and I think I prefer it warm instead of cold. I also noticed that maybe I didn&#39;t blend it enough, as there are little stringy bits of leek in mine - perhaps that&#39;s the texture thing I was warned of?<br /><br />Anyway, it didn&#39;t matter because it tasted great. I was VERY proud of myself!&nbsp; :-D

				Most of my childhood was spent in the south (Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee), so kale and collard greens were a staple.<br /><br />My family always just boiled them (or did the pressure cooker) with some salt. I know that other southerners will tell you to cook them with some sort of meat or fat, but we were all vegetarians, so that really wasn&#39;t anything we tried.<br /><br />I still buy kale and collard greens from Key Food (can&#39;t wait to get the real deal from Farmer Bill, though), and I still just boil them with some salt until they are at my desired tenderness. The end result is always what I consider to be fabulous and fabulously simplistic. :)
