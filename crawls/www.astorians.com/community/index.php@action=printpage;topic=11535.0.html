				i went into the pet store on steinway b/w b&#039;way and 31st ave today (the one with all of the puppies in the window) and as i was walking out i saw a cage with two little siamese kittens.&nbsp; i love cats, so i went to take a closer look and one of them was obviously very ill!!!&nbsp; it was so sad! it couldn&#039;t open one of its eyes, it looked really tired and dehydrated, and it was filthy.&nbsp; i want to report them to the aspca, but i can&#039;t find the store&#039;s business listing anywhere! it was clear animal neglect.&nbsp; does anyone know if you can even report a pet store? any info on the business&#039; name/owner would be appreciated.&nbsp; i know if the kitten doesn&#039;t get medical attention it will die.

				How do you think pet stores sell their &quot;products&quot;?

				I think you mean one next to the Gap clothing store, close to Broadway. They have been doing what they do there for at least 20 years.&nbsp; The pets that don&#039;t get picked in few days all start looking sick.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They also charge a ridiculous price, over $1,000 for puppies.&nbsp; Some, maybe most,&nbsp; puppies are their long time.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t know much about cats and birds, but I would not be surprised if their conditions are wrong for them.&nbsp; <br /><br />Years ago a puppie was eating own feces in window, people were complaining to workers and owners, nothing was done.&nbsp; I got into it with loud mouthed worker,&nbsp; and he lied to cops who came, said I hit him.&nbsp; Luckily witnesses backed me up, although jerk-off NYPD gave me hard time.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />

				My partner and I have a cat, Rosemary, that is a part of our extended family (us gays do what we can).<br /><br />Anyway, we NEVER go into that store with the puppies in the window.

				I am bumping this thread back up the top where it belongs, and I am SO GLAD people are realizing what a terrible place this store is.&nbsp; <br /><br />I walk by every now and then, and I have to cross the street sometimes so as not to get upset by what I see in the window there.&nbsp; Some of the puppies are waaaay too big (well over a few months or so) - they are much too large to be kept in the hideous window area - they are obviously not being purchased, in which case they continue to grow bigger until they are too old, no longer desirable &quot;merchandise,&quot; and they ultimately wind up at a local pound or shelter where they are euthanized within a couple of days. <br /><br />Any store that advertises &quot;no money down, walk out with a puppy&quot; raises huge red flags in my eyes.&nbsp; The kitten you saw probably was very sick, not receiving any attention, and will probably be put to sleep instead of being given adequate health care.&nbsp; It&#039;s a sick situation and if no one here reports it to the ASPCA, please let me know, because I certainly will.<br /><br />And if anyone saw Oprah&#039;s episode about puppy mills, you can bet your ass that the animals at the &quot;US Pet Discount&quot; did not come from safe, humane, or sanitary conditions.&nbsp; <br /><br />I can&#039;t even believe pet stores are still in existence at all these days.&nbsp; It&#039;s awful.

				Hear, hear!&nbsp; The best things in life are free anyway!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Well, relatively free - compare a $3,000.00 pet store dog to a minimal adoption fee!&nbsp; No question!<br /><br />Plus, if the pet stores stop receiving business, they&#039;ll eventually go down the drain, esp. on Steinway Street, where there are new storefront vacancies every other day now.

				It is incredible how these places stay in business, people can be so dumb.<br />Some of these puppies are going for $2000+ at a pet store, when they can easily be obtained from a reputable breeder with all vet work, paperwork, bloodlines etc. at a fraction of the cost.<br />Every time I walk by one of those places, the dogs look like they&#039;re in terrible shape. They always look like they&#039;re in horrible conditions and 80% of the time, they look sick or unhealthy. I feel so bad for these pups, and the people in those stores are like used car salesmen and have no idea what responsible pet ownership pet even involves.

				I am disgusted at the conditions these puppies are kept in. Without detracting from the plight of pet store puppies and puppy mill puppies, I am very upset at the conditions of the parrots in these stores. Parrots are wild animals, they are not domesticated like dogs have been for centuries. I bet these jerks don&#039;t even know what an avian vet is, and their birds are probably illegal. <br /><br />A few years ago the national chain Petsmart stopped carrying large parrots such as cockatoos and macaws in their stores; they have parakeets and cockatiels still. They did so because of pressure and petitions from parrot rescue groups and parrot owners who saw the deplorable conditions in pet stores, and the fact that store owners and employees are clueless about how to properly care for a huge macaw (that can live 70+ years!) and selling them to idiots who end up giving the bird away because &quot;it bites, screams, and doesn&#039;t talk&quot; (way to go, responsible bird owner!). This is huge for the pet industry; (of course it probably boils down to that it wasn&#039;t profitable for Petsmart to do so but still this was good news.)<br /><br />All I&#039;m saying is that people have the power to change the way pets are sold and treated in this country; the swift enforcement of legislation would certainly help. But people need to speak up.

				i think i saw a hiring sign in the window last week. i thought about applying and then stealing all the puppies (not sure what i&#039;d do with them...), or taking undercover video...there is no way they treat those animals well. no. way. they don&#039;t even look healthy. i usually have a hard time walking away from puppies looking at me so longingly, but those look so sick, i know i&#039;d be asking for it if i bought (which i wouldn&#039;t do since there are plenty for rescue).<br /><br />:(<br /><br />

				Since it doesn&#039;t seem like anyone has followed up and filed a report with the ASPCA, I can do it - I just have a hard time calling in a complaint when I have never physically been<em> inside</em> the store (I can&#039;t bring myself to go in there, it would be extremely difficult).&nbsp; &nbsp;I volunteer in a very clean, well-staffed, caring, no-kill shelter (www.olliesplace.org) and it&#039;s hard enough walking away after my shift with all the cats in their cages - and they are healthy!<br /><br />Can someone please call and post a complaint who has actually been in there and has detailed descriptions of the conditions?&nbsp; I&#039;m not trying to be a wimp - I can suck it up and go in, it would just be very hard.<br />

Petland Discounts is family owned and operated (or at least was until not that long ago), is a local chain and does not sell puppies (only small animals and birds). Petland is a national chain, often in malls, that sells mostly puppies and maybe hamsters and guinea pigs. The MSNBC story is about Petland the national puppy selling chain, not our local Petland Discounts.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks for the clarification.&nbsp; My heart sank a bit thinking I&#039;d been patronizing such a disgusting place.&nbsp; Good to know Petland Discounts is what I always it was, a decent little chain that sells their stuff for far less than PetCo.&nbsp; Seriously, the cat litter I get is more than $5 cheaper at Petland Discounts than Petco. <br /><br />And like YaFace81 upthread, I also would very much like to log a complaint with ASPCA’s Humane Law Enforcement department, but I can&#039;t get myself to even pass that deplorable pet store on Steinway.&nbsp; I will actually often bypass it by taking a lower street to, say, 30th Ave. and Steinway.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway, I hope someone who&#039;s stronger than I am can do the necessary investigative work.&nbsp; In the meantime, I&#039;m going to ask an animal activist friend of mine about what are other effective steps that can be done to either shut them down or stop the practice of selling puppies and kittens.

BTW, this is the most dangerous time of year for this pups. They are usually transported in unheated trucks and only have a survival rate of of 40% making it to their destination. In the heat of the summer their survival rate is around 50%. What we need are enforceable laws against puppy millers who treat dogs as livestock and additional state regulations prohibiting pet stores from telling people that they are selling purebred dogs, when in fact they are all mixed breed. Why do you think the shelters are 90% mixed breed dogs. When a puppy grows up and no longer resembles the breed that it was supposed to be, and doesn&#039;t have the temperament of the breed that it is supposed to be, and the owners don&#039;t understand that owning a dog comes with a good deal of personal and financial responsibility . . . they just get dumped into the shelter system. <br /><br />Don&#039;t get me started on how much I hate the puppy millers and pet stores.

				&nbsp;:-(<br />I never shop here (the one near the Hallmark store on Steinway, obviously not the one that burned down) but today I popped in to get a dog toy... and there was a (warning-- graphic) <br /><br />dead hamster in the hamster cage, which the two hamsters were eating. It had obviously been dead for some time.... they had chewed its fur off. Really sickening, the poor dead animal was chewed open. <br />&nbsp;I told the worker and she said, &quot;oh.&quot; and went back to &quot;cleaning&quot; the fish tanks. Someone needs to close this place down. The other hamster in the cage looked pregnant, or may have been sitting on either babies or another dead hamster. <br /><br />

				That is just sickening.&nbsp; Someone should try to go in there and take pictures w/ their cell phone of these horrible conditions.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure if proof was passed onto the NYC ASPCA, the store would be investigated on counts of Animal Cruelty for sure, and possibly shut down for good.&nbsp; <br /><br />If we knew for <em>sure</em> they got their animals from puppy mills (i.e., had some sort of documentation to back it up) and had more evidence of the disgusting environment the animals live/are kept in, we could absolutely start a protest of some kind outside the store, handing out fliers to passersby, etc.&nbsp; I&#039;d be all for it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I can&#039;t even walk past this place and can&#039;t believe it still even exists...seeing the puppies in the window (who look to be several months old and way to big to be kept in those small quarters) rolling around in dirty, crap-infested wood shavings is enough to make we want to go in there and show the owner how hard I&#039;ve been working on my right hook.&nbsp; Awful.&nbsp; Unfortunately I&#039;ve heard the guy is extremely confrontational and difficult to deal with....<br /><br />Now that I&#039;m on a roll about this hellhole, should we contact some other press outlet (local NYC news, investigative reporting, etc) to look into this?&nbsp;

				I deal with animal issues all the time. Dying animals is part of the cycle of stores receiving them, caring for them, and reselling them. A few dead hamsters or gerbils or a dirty kitten or dog is not going to warrant the attention of ANY animal group. The bigger issues for them are shutting down puppy and kitten mills and people fighting their dogs and roosters. <br /><br />ANY fish store you go into has dead fish floating in tanks. Any pet store will have the occasional dead small pet in a tank. And, having worked at many different shelters(including the ASPCA) puppies and kittens tend to get dirty. VERY dirty. I am not saying that cannibal hamsters is normal, but I have been around enough to have seen a lot worse. If you shop around and spend time in ANY of these stores, you will find that all of them are pretty much the same. Use your resources wisely and get after the puppy and kitten mills!!!

				this is from the ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement&nbsp; FAQ<br /><br />&quot;Q: I was in a pet store in my neighborhood. The animals&#039; cages were dirty, and they all looked very depressed. I am concerned about the animals&#039; welfare. Can HLE close the store?<br />A: As we all know, some pet stores provide less than ideal living conditions for the animals they sell. HLE does not have any legal authority to close down an animal-related business, including pet stores. Pet stores are licensed by the New York City Health Department, and must comply with the provisions of the New York City Health Code. Where a pet store is repeatedly cited by the Health Department for Health Code violations, the Department has the authority to hold a hearing to suspend the license to operate. Complaints about pet stores should be directed to the Health Department.<br /><br />HLE inspects pet stores upon complaints of animal cruelty, which includes injured or visibly sick animals, abuse by pet store personnel, or animals without food or water.&quot;<br /><br />

				I HATE this place too!&nbsp; I refuse to go in.&nbsp; I wish all the uninformed fools of the world would realize how horrendous puppy mills are!&nbsp; And that payment plan?!&nbsp; $20 a month?&nbsp; What a way to set up a poor person (that shouldn&#039;t have a pet because they can&#039;t afford it) with a pet!&nbsp; Can they afford vet care and quality food/supplies?&nbsp; If they can only afford $20/month, probably not!!&nbsp; I want to steal all of the animals and burn the place down!!!&nbsp; I won&#039;t, because of the consequences, but I WANT TO!!!

				I was in Starbucks yesterday and just happened passed this discount pet store next door. all i can say is that i wanted to cry and have not slept all night! all of these animals looked sick and horribly depressed. the conditions they are kept in is absolutely awful! dirty and disgusting! As i watch that someone wanted to look at a little Cockerspaniel puppy that was looking very lethargic in the window. i witnessed one of the workers (who i later went back to ask his name) it was mike, an African american fellow with gold teeth in the front) well, he picked up this puppy with such force that the puppy let out a large yelp! seeing it was a male, he proceeded to to drop this puppy with such force that the puppy let out a second yelp!!! I came home to look them up on the internet to see the reviews of this horrible place, and wouldnt you know that there are literally hundreds! my question is, WHY IS THIS HOUSE OF HORRORS STILL OPEN???? why hasn&#039;t there been some local protests to shut down this awful animal abusing place? from what i have read, they are also abusive to customers! wake up astoria! where is your heart? how can you let this take place in your neighborhood????????&nbsp;

				I hate that place. I can&#039;t believe people don&#039;t know enough to adopt&nbsp; a pet.&nbsp; They charge over&nbsp; $1,000 for puppies, and drop price &amp;100 a week.&nbsp; Some dogs sit in window for 5-6 weeks.&nbsp; They start out happy looking after 2nd week they look sickly.&nbsp; &nbsp;Place like that should get investigated more by ASCPA, if they have the authority to do so.

				I was shocked to walk in last Thursday to ask how much they wanted for the golden labs in the window ... $1200 EACH .. they looked pretty healthy to me but $1200 is a lot<br />and before buying my golden retriever a couple of months ago I had come into this store to ask how often they get labs ... the guy &quot;Mike&quot; said tell me what color you want him, leave a deposit and we will have him in 2 weeks <br />to which I said really? I said I wanted a chocolate lab with green eyes and he said &quot;give me a month tops&quot;<br />were they just going to clone me a puppy? that&#039;s when I thought nvm I&#039;ll just go somewhere else<br />I never seen anyone actually buy a puppy from here

				Greetings, <br />I always browse this site.&nbsp; I have never felt the need to join till today.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am the devoted mom to 4 beautiful canines, they are my everything.&nbsp; Three of them come from US Pets, one is a rescue. Two were purchased at the Steinway St. location, the oldest of the 2 is 9 years old.&nbsp; My 4 year old German Shepherd is from&nbsp; the Flushing location. He is the smartest most beautiful Shepherd in the universe.&nbsp; He even talks, says &quot;oh mom&quot; when he doesn&#039;t get his way.&nbsp; He is able to let himself out into the backyard and let himself in as well.&nbsp; My elderly Mom lives with me, when she fell, he rapidly came to get me.&nbsp; <br /><br />Knock on wood.&nbsp; I have never experienced any behavioral problems nor health problems with any of my dogs.&nbsp; Like all dogs, occasionally they get an upset stomach or patch of dry skin. <br /><br />My sister also owns two dogs from US pets, a Chihuahua&nbsp; and a Yorkie. Both beautiful and healthy and really good with her young children. <br /><br />Just thought I would tell you about my good experience. I am not saying valid points have been addressed. I am aware that my kids are probably from puppy mills.&nbsp; But when you think of it, buying a puppy from a pet store, aren&#039;t you in fact rescuing it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just my opinion.<br /><br />Thanks to all of you who write on the is blog and have helped make Astoria the great place it is becoming. I was born in Ravenswood and have been a life long resident.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I really don&#039;t understand this. Why would anybody pay money to adopt a cat or dog. Don&#039;t you know about puppy mills? Do you know where these poor animals come from? Some of them are stolen and sold to the pet store. Why can&#039;t you animal lovers go to an animal shelter and adopt an animal? There are kill shelter and&nbsp; no kill shelters. Many are animals are put to sleep because nobody is adopting them. Why do you want to go and pay for one? Adopt one. Are you people too lazy to go to a shelter?&nbsp; :rolleyes: <br /><br />Seriously.

				Maybe a separate topic, and I&#039;m not saying this is right or rational, but I also am bothered when people say &quot;I want a dog/cat that looks just like THIS&quot;. It comes off as an animal version of racism to me. You&#039;re choosing a living creature to be a part of your family for over a decade...it&#039;s not picking what color your Toyota to have.<br /><br /><br />The times I&#039;ve chosen pets (store, adoption, stray) it was because of what type of cat/dog it was and how I clicked with it. That super nice and friendly cat, the dog that seemed happy and playful or maybe more &quot;mature&quot;. The ones I get along with. Cuteness is nice and awesome but if your top priority is so it matches your couch, you&#039;re getting the pet for the wrong reasons.

				Pretty much all pet stores are inherently &#039;bad&#039;...and I would imagine particularly a pet store on Steinway.&nbsp; Blech!<br />Pet stores don&#039;t sell &#039;used&#039; puppies so to speak, which means they essentially come from puppy mills.&nbsp; Then you think about the kinds of people a pet store on Steinway is going to attract....not exactly &#039;enlightened&#039; people who would instead opt to rescue animals from shelters.&nbsp; Most people who buy from these outer-borough type pet stores....it is &#039;impulse&#039; type buying...the little kids cry &#039;mommy....daddy...can we please get a puppy?&nbsp; Please????&#039;&nbsp; These same shops also often offer layaway or payment plans.&nbsp; (They sure do know their customer base!)&nbsp; So then the family eventually takes the puppy home....has no sense about proper nutrition, or preventative vet visits.....then maybe within a year the puppy is either sick or they realize they just can&#039;t afford to take care of it...and next thing you know the pet is either dropped off on a street corner to fend for itself, or dropped off at a shelter.<br />Then you have the other end of the spectrum....pet stores in Manhattan for the rich...who drop thousands on some fancy purebreed, meanwhile perfectly good dogs in shelters go unadopted.<br />The whole thing is just repulsive.
