				i got the following email from a co-worker and social worker.<br /><br />i think this is a great idea. <br />our representatives need to hear what we have to say about everything. now is the time. :)<br /><br />Rosemary<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />From the Disabilities Network of New York City (DNNYC).<br />&nbsp;<br />CALL THE CAPITOL TOLL-FREE OCTOBER 17 &amp; 18: SET CONGRESS'S PRIORITIES<br />STRAIGHT! <br />&nbsp;<br />Congress has a serious priorities problem - and it will mean less food<br />and health care for people in need if you don't set them straight. <br />&nbsp;<br />Its unthinkable that Congress might cut Medicaid, Food Stamps, TANF and<br />other vital services for people in need - whose numbers have shot up<br />because of the hurricanes. But these cuts are now scheduled for action<br />in Congress starting the week of October 17. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />It's even more unthinkable that Congress may cut even more deeply!<br />Reacting to the cost of Katrina recovery, powerful voices in Congress<br />are now calling for deeper cuts across domestic programs. But they have<br />not stopped the plans for still more tax breaks to the well-off. These<br />are dangerous choices. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />CALL YOUR SENATORS AND REP. ON OCTOBER 17 OR 18 TELL THEM THESE CUTS <br />ARE<br />UNTHINKABLE! &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />For a PDF flier with this information, click here: <br />http://www.chn.org/pdf/congresspriorities.pdf.<br />&nbsp;<br />For background on cuts, click here: &nbsp;<br />http://www.chn.org/pdf/congressprioritiesbackground.pdf.<br />&nbsp;<br />HOW TO CALL:<br />&nbsp;<br />Step 1: On October 17 or 18, call 1-800-426-8073 to be connected<br />toll-free to the Capitol Switchboard. Ask to speak to one of the<br />senators from your state. <br />&nbsp;<br />Step 2: When the senators phone is answered, say: &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />My name is ___________ and I live in [your town/city]. I would like<br />Senator [name] to oppose $35 billion in cuts to Medicaid, Food Stamps<br />and other vital services, and to oppose $70 billion in more tax cuts. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The right priorities are protecting people from sickness and hardship,<br />investing in housing, jobs, and other services that families need not<br />squandering billions on tax cuts for the well-connected. &nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Step 3: Use the toll-free number in step 1 and call your other senator<br />and your representative. If the lines are busy, please be patient and<br />try again. Or, dial their direct lines (not toll-free) - find the<br />numbers at www.senate.gov and www.house.gov
