				Hi OUTAstorians,<br />My name is Rachel, a fellow Astorian and Director of Volunteer Management at GLAAD (the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation). I wanted to let everyone know about the volunteer opportunities we have coming up at our New York Media Awards!<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>The 18th Annual GLAAD Media Awards - New York City</strong></span></span> <br /><br />The GLAAD Media Awards celebrate media projects and media professionals that fairly, accurately and inclusively portray the LGBT community. Held in four cities across the country (<strong>New York - March 26</strong>, Los Angeles - April 14, San Francisco – April 28, Miami - May 10), these celebrity packed events are planned and run by over 800 volunteers! Volunteer opportunities are numerous and exciting – signup now to hear more. <br /><br /><strong>This year’s New York honorees include Patti LaBelle and Tom Ford! </strong><br />2006 Photos: http://www.glaad.org/events/gallery/2006/0306_NY_media_awards.php<br /><br /><strong>How to Volunteer: </strong><br />First time volunteers are required&nbsp;to attend one of two open houses to hear about possible assignments and to complete the volunteer form. All volunteers are required to attend an additional Assignment Meeting, just before the event. Dates are below FYI, you will pick a date when you complete your volunteer form. Both meetings last less then an hour.<br />&nbsp;<br />Veteran volunteers are strongly encouraged to attend&nbsp;an open house -- it is the best way to get your first choice of assignment. If you are not able to make an Open House please confirm your participation by replying to this email. We will send you the Volunteer Form to fill out after the second Open House date. Veterans are required to attend an Assignment Meeting, dates are below FYI, you will pick a date on the volunteer form. <br /><br /><strong>How to RSVP: </strong><br />Please reply to this email or send a message to oleary@glaad.org (http://oleary@glaad.org).
