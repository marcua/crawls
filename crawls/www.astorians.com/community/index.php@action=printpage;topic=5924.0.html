				FYI for any other ultimate players lurking here.<br /><br />Had a terrific time playing ultimate tonight, starting around 6:15PM by the Hell Gate bridge. There&#039;s a great group of people playing on Tuesday evenings and they seem pretty committed to making it a regular thing. Especially with the promise of oppressively hot weather in months to come, I&#039;m thrilled about the availability of an evening game. Also makes it so that occasional weekend getaways from NYC won&#039;t mean missing ultimate for an entire week.<br /><br />There were two games (4x4) to 11 tonight. The first game, my team (Anna, Chris, Alex) won pretty handily. But Alex pulled a hamstring and had to bug out. Luckily, a dude by the name of Jonathan showed up and joined in. In the second game, the other dudes (Andreas, Jeff, Gregg(or Craig...isuckwithnames... and...the other guy over there.. :lol:)&nbsp; jumped out to an early lead and actually were at game point with a 3 score lead...... but we mounted a comeback and won that game, too!&nbsp; :mrgreen: F-U-N.<br /><br />I hope the weather holds for this coming Saturday morning, but if it doesn&#039;t and that game falls through, try coming to next Tuesday&#039;s game.

				A weekday evening game sounds awesome, but ...not quite sure how to play.

At my first Ultimate Frisbee game in Astoria (the Saturday 11AM game), I ended up getting pretty well scorched by the sun. Actually sun burn. D&#039;oh! I can only guess that this will be more and more of a problem in the Spring and Summer, to say nothing of playing, basically, during the hottest part of the day. Probably won&#039;t be able to convince people to get together and play at 8 AM.&nbsp; :roll: So I&#039;ll buy a hat and glob on the sunscreen, but on those *really* hot days, I&#039;ll probably hold my breath until the weekday evening game.&nbsp; :-)

				Tonight there is a game starting at 6PM, tomorrow there will be another at 11AM, and then another one Sunday evening at 5PM.<br /><br />I have a NYCares event on Saturday, but I plan to be at the other 2 games. Hope to see you there!&nbsp; :mrgreen:
