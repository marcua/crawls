				Looking for someone to take my roommates place, beginning June 1. This can be either a short or long term arrangement (long term preferable). <br /><br />The apartment: <br />The apartment is a 3 bedroom with two bedrooms occupied, which keeps it spacious and welcoming. It&#039;s on the second and third floors of a private house (landlord lives downstairs). The second floor has the living room, dining room, eat-in kitchen, master bedroom, &quot;guest room&quot; (there&#039;s a mattress so there&#039;s room for guests, but mostly the room is used for storage, so there&#039;s plenty of space in/around the apartment), and bathroom. Upstairs there is another den/living room area, huge floor closets/storage spaces, and the third bedroom (mine). The apartment gets tons of natural light on both floors, and a great cross-breeze with the windows open. There is TONS of street parking, and pretty much everything you need is nearby - supermarkets, laundromats, drug stores, cafes, restaurants etc. Just under a mile from the N/W train, and you can take the Q69 bus straight down Ditmars to the apt. (about 4 minutes). It&#039;s the last stop on the train (first if you&#039;re headed into the city) so you&#039;ll always get a seat. 12 minutes to midtown (59th and Lex), 20 minutes to Times Square. Basic cable and wireless internet are already set up, and the apartment is furnished (see below) <br /><br />The room: <br />Master bedroom on the main floor, next to the bathroom. Carpeted, huge wall-length closet with top shelf, plenty of room for a queens size bed and other furniture, well lit, unfurnished, window has room for an A/C unit (my roommate is likely taking hers, might be willing to sell it, but either way, it fits fine), and the room is about 14&#039; x 9&#039;. <br /><br />Please be: <br />Female (gay or straight) or male (gay only), responsible (with payments etc.), clean/neat, able/willing to share household chores, easy-going, gay friendly, regular friendly, and otherwise able to live peacefully in a shared space. <br /><br />I am: <br />A teacher, clean/neat, friendly, gay, and quiet(ish - friends/significant others are welcome to visit, but no loud parties, etc.) <br /><br />Split utilities/cable/wifi. First month and deposit to move in. Please be ready to verify employment with a reference/contact person. Please email me for more info/if you&#039;re interested in setting up a time to come see the apartment. <br /><br />Ditmars Blvd at 49th Street <br /><br />Contact: prettyfly4arabbi@gmail.com
