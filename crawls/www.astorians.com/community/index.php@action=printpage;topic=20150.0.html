				I am trying to populate CONTACTS. I am syncing with iMac ADDRESS BOOK through iTunes. <br /><br />How do I get a name to appear on the top of the list before the &#039;A&#039;s?<br /><br />I have already tried: #, *, ~, ∆, , 1., — and +.<br /><br />I would like my ICE list to appear as soon as CONTACTS is tapped.<br /><br />Any help will be greatly appreciated.

				Why not set those as favorites and then access them that way?<br /><br />The button can be set so that a double press goes right to your favorites screen.

				Thank you for your input.<br /><br />The whole idea of my having an ICE list on a mobile is so that any EMT or ICU employee that can figure out how to turn on my phone can contact my personal physician(s), POA, and family . . . if/when necessary.<br /><br />I assume once on, they would want to access CONTACTS on this phone.<br /><br />So, I decided to label carefully:<br />(A #01) ICE Personal Family Physician<br />(A #02) ICE Personal Neurologic Physician<br />(A #03) ICE Power of Attorney/Health Care Advocate<br /><br />I HAD to use a preceding 0 (zero) because there are more than 10 llstings and I wanted them to fall in order of importance.<br /><br />Ain&#039;t technology wunnerful!

				Or you could just print out a card and put it in your wallet.&nbsp; I imagine that a responder would be looking there first when trying to find ID anyway.

However, I recently had a friend slammed in the back of the head and rendered unconscious on the pavement. Her purse was stolen, and therefore her wallet. But her mobile was in her jacket pocket with her house keys. When she was attended to by the EMTs, they had a problem with her thick accent. We BOTH decided that our cells HAD to have ICE listings. I already wear a medical alert and always wonder if anyone will look for it!

				Doesn&#039;t your Iphone have a passcode lock on it? Unless they are given the code the contacts don&#039;t matter.

				There&#039;s a subtle problem with that you want to do. The contacts application once started and used (either directly from the contacts icon or from the contacts tab once you&#039;re in the phone app) remembers where you last were. Hence, if someone were to open your contacts list, they&#039;d see what you were last browsing. <br /><br />If they&#039;re smart enough they&#039;ll figure out how to get to contacts beginning with ICE. Or hit the phone icon and see favorites and recents. I think the hardest problem for non-iPhone users would be unlocking the phone ;)

				In Macworld a few months ago they wrote a &quot;How To&quot;&nbsp; have your screensaver have text info - they suggested contact info in case the phone was lost (another phone #)... <br /><br />You could have it say that plus all ICE info is in Favorites or something like that.. I will look for the article today/tomorrow.

Very interesting article. While I guess I should be, but am not, apprehensive about losing the phone, I am adamant about having my Health Care Proxy and my Personal Physician contacted. One of the things I love the most about this phone is the ability to repopulate it (or its replacement) via my Mac. That means NEVER having to go through dealing with a lost phone/address book ever again! I am completely neurotic about keeping mine up-to-date. I even list summer/winter addresses and telephone numbers. It is such a joy to have all that information at my fingertips at my beckon call no matter where I am. I hope I can live through the next two years with AT&amp;T until I can port over to Verizon.<br /><br />I have also discovered numerous undocumented ways to get music, photos and videos on the iPhone. Having a Mac gave me a huge advantage in the learning curve for this phone. Also being a long time user of the iTunes app increased my learning speed.
