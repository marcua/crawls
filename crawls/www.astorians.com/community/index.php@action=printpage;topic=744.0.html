				There is a new little spot that just opened on 31st Avenue between 33 - 34th St. It was delicious!! You must go and try it. <br /><br />We stopped in for lunch Saturday afternoon and had wonderful beef dumplings - a great hearty portion served with a very tasty slaw of red &amp; white cabbage. Also had the edamame. Service was always with a smile and the beef soup was amazing too - great clean taste to the broth, with a bit of a spicy kick to it. The noodles in the soup were delicious and hand made just before they went into the broth to cook. Same with the dumplings - everything is hand made and totally authentic Tibetan. Even down to the Tibetan cookies -the only dessert they have, but they hit the spot. <br /><br />We had iced tea, cherry rose I believe it was called and it was just a delight of flavors. The owner is a very sweet local Astorian woman and her staff are all from Tibet. I would totally encourage you to visit and support this great place.

				My roommate and I went to the Teahouse last weekend and it was wonderful. The veg. momos were the perfect lunch. I think my lunch cost 5 or 6 dollars. We should support this place so it can stick around.

				For the lunch we had it was about $35, but that included beef dumplings, beef soup, edamame and 3 or 4 teas. &nbsp;For the quality of the food and generous portions, I thought it was a great value.

				We went last night, to check it out. My husband was pretty happy with his dinner, chicken dumplings and a rooibi tea, and I had the beef dumplings and a ceylon tea. The dumplings were good, the dumpling-part itself obviously fresh and handmade, but the filling was a little bland. Then again, I didn't try any of the other dishes, like the broth and the edaname.<br /><br />However, I have to say, I don't think he put enough leaf in my ceylon tea, even after I asked for it to be made a little stronger (I'd ordered the pot). I'm not an expert on tibetan food, but boy, I know my teas (many years lived in Kenya and a British husband, woo boy do I know tea), and my tea wasn't strong enough even though I let the pot set for at least fifteen minutes.<br /><br />I'm not so much criticising the place (perhaps that's how they brew their black teas on purpose), I'm just expressing disappointment that I didn't get the kind of tea that would stand up in inclement weather.<br /><br />The service was stellar, probably because we were the only ones in there, and the place is REALLY charming. I suggest sitting by the window, like we did! Or the garden.

				I spoke with the owner and she's planning on making the tea selection seasonal, so I would expect more bold teas as the weather cools. &nbsp;She's also going to add additional food items, I think.
