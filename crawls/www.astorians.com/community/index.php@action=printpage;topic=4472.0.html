				Yeah, I&#39;ll be out of town too for the holiday. Although, I did see this week that they were selling it at Best Yet, up on 37th St. &amp; 19th Ave. I remember someone was talking about it a few months back and wondering where to find it. So its there too for those of us up north who are looking for it!

				Too bad I missed the tasting, but good to know it&#39;s at that Bravo - another reason to shop there.

				Hey everyone! Sorry I haven&#39;t responded to your questions before now, but I just got an email prompting me to do so. My bad.<br /><br />We are currently in 18 locations, 5 are in Queens. Check out the website for all of them- www.5bicecream.com<br /><br />The closest one to Ditmars is Best Yet Market. If you&#39;d like to see it closer to where you shop, please print out the info sheet pdf on the site and hand it to the manager of the store you want it in. It has all the info they need to either place and order with our distributor, or to contact us for samples. And, no, Victory and Rose &amp; Joe&#39;s do not sell our stuff there-we&#39;d love them to, though. I think it has alot to do with limited space. It&#39;s funny becasue when we first started years ago- they were like, &quot;you&#39;re gonna do what with our stuff?&quot; But now we&#39;ve all gotten to know each other better. <br /><br />And, yeah, several people want us to bring back the Holy F&#39;n Cannoli flavor-including us!! We want to, but this will take some time and research on our part. Unfortunately, the costs to make this flavor right now are more than we can do. We are planning on at least 3 new flavors this summer, though and I&#39;m very excited about them. They are of course TOP SECRET, but I can tell you one will be our first fruit flavor, and one will have a portion of it&#39;s procedes go to a flavor specific charity.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know when I can get to doing another demo at Bravo. Kim and I are trying hard to get to each store at least once before the spring time.<br /><br />Thank you guys for all the interest, and positive feedback we have been getting! It&#39;s such a cool thing to have the support of our neighbors!

				Just a note to say I stumbled upon Amaretto Amore while browsing the freezer section at the 28th Avenue C-Town today and that was a dangerous discovery.&nbsp; Yum!!!&nbsp; I had never heard about 5 Boroughs but I love what you guys are doing and am going to mention it to my friends.&nbsp; After I browsed the 5 Boroughs web site and found out there was an Astoria flavor called Bakla-Wha?, I was surprised not to have seen it at the C-Town.&nbsp; That would&#039;ve been great!&nbsp; Anyway, keep up the great work!&nbsp; You have one more new and very satisfied customer.&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:

				Last night on the Fox 5 10 o&#039;clock news, there was a bit about 5 Boroughs Ice Cream. Apparently, Staten Islanders are not happy with the flavor &quot;Staten Island Landfill&quot;. They find the name offensive and the borough president James Molinaro is calling for a boycott. In my opinion, this is a bit ridiculous. It is an ice cream flavor after all!! Vanilla ice cream, cherries, chocolate crunchies, brownies, and a fudge swirl sounds pretty damn good to me.&nbsp; :-) This Staten Island boycott is definitely drumming up some free publicity for 5 Boroughs Ice Cream.<br /><br />The Story:<br />http://www.myfoxny.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail;jsessionid=F99DB0DF28AF31716C216FB332CF38A7?contentId=3463067&amp;version=2&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=VSTY&amp;pageId=1.1.1<br /><br />Let&#039;s keep supporting our fellow Astorians, Scott and Kim, and keep on buying their yummy treats. http://www.5boroughsicecream.com

				There&#039;s an article on Gothamist (http://gothamist.com/2007/06/12/borough_preside.php) about the ice-cream boycott, and Scott and Kim issued a statement. My favorite line: &quot;New Yorkers are never shy about their opinions, and that&#039;s one of the reasons why we love our town, and want to explore it via tasty ice cream.&quot;<br /><br />I would like to explore everything via tasty ice cream :)<br /><br />Also, they&#039;ve made t-shirts (http://www.cafepress.com/5boroughs/3110794)...hehe!<br /><br />There are a bunch of comments on that article, and they pretty much all boil down to, &quot;James Molinaro really has too much time on his hands, and where can I buy this ice cream, it sounds awesome!&quot;&nbsp; :mrgreen: Yay 5 Bouroughs Ice Cream!

I visited someone from Staten Island a couple years ago, and the first thing she did when we were driving down the street was point to the landfills to our left and right. I got the impression that they accept the landfills and wouldn&#039;t mind jokes being made about them, but maybe not everyone has the same attitude as she does. I can imagine politicians representing the borough getting fired up about it more than the other residents, though. If anything I&#039;d think the Staten Islanders would be amused by the ice cream name as long as it&#039;s delicious. The Reebok ads are just dumb.

				Sadness: http://www.5boroughsicecream.com/<br /><br />I knew something was wrong when we went to Best Yet today and there was none to be found, and then we went to Bravo and all they had were 5 beat-up looking containers of the Amaretto flavor. So if you like the Amaretto flavor, go to Bravo and get it ASAP. I&#039;ll never forget you, Staten Island Landfill and South Bronx Cha Cha Chocolate.&nbsp; :cry:

				Yeah, and in its place at Best Yet is this stuff called Gianni New York ice cream. It also seems to be based in NY, but unlike the 5 Boroughs Ice Cream, most of their flavors have nothing to do with the areas they&#039;re named after. For example: Grand Central Vanilla, Park Avenue Peanut Butter in Chocolate, Manhattan Mint Chocolate Chip, Wall Street Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough.&nbsp; :? Their website similarly has a generic, corporate feel to it.

				No, I feel somewhat opposed to it due to the soulless package design and lack of creativity with the flavors. I just read this article about it: http://www.nydailynews.com/money/2008/03/10/2008-03-10_brooklyn_ice_cream_man_bids_to_make_his_.html<br />This guy has slick businessmen and millions of dollars behind him, and it shows. They need some kind of creative visual artist on the team and some creative flavor people. It seems like these guys feel like all you have to do is slap an Italian name and &quot;New York&quot; on an ice cream container and people will buy it, even if it&#039;s the same flavors everyone else already offers. Eh, maybe they will buy it.
