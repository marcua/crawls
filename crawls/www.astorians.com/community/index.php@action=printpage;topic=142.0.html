				-found this walt whitman piece on the internet doing some research about immigration...<br /><br /><br /><br />just thought i would share:<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>You, Whoever You Are</strong><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>You, whoever you are!...<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; All you continentals of Asia, Africa, Europe, Australia, indifferent of place!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; All you on the numberless islands of the archipelagoes of the sea!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; All you of centuries hence when you listen to me!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; All you each and everywhere whom I specify not, but include just the same!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Health to you! good will to you all, from me and America sent!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Each of us is inevitable,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Each of us is limitless—each of us with his or her right upon the earth,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Each of us allow'd the eternal purports of the earth,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Each of us here as divinely as any is here.</em><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Walt Whitman

				&quot;Each of us is inevitable/Each of us is limitless&quot;<br /><br />God, I love Whitman. &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Here's another, less joyous but equally inclusive:<br /><br />I Sit and Look Out<br /><br />I sit and look out upon all the sorrows of the world, and<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; upon all oppression and shame,<br />I hear secret convulsive sobs from young men at anguish<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with themselves, remorseful after deeds done,<br />I see in low life the mother misused by her children, dying,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; neglected, gaunt, desperate,<br />I see the wife misused by her husband, I see the treacherous<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; seducer of young women<br />I mark the ranklings of jealousy and unrequited love<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; attempted to be hid, I see these sights on the earth,<br />I see the workings of battle, pestilence, tyranny, I see martyrs<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and prisoners,<br />I observe a famine at sea, I observe the sailors casting lots<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; who shall be kill'd to preserve the lives of the rest,<br />I observe the slights and degradations cast by arrogant persons<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; upon laborers, the poor, and upon negroes, and the like;<br />All these - all the meanness and agony without end I sitting<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; look out upon,<br />See, hear, and am silent.

				.....speaking of Walt, here's something for the &quot; post-Christians&quot; among you. &nbsp;a Whitman favorite of mine that does not seem to get cited near often enough. <br /><br />http://www.bartleby.com/142/33.html<br /><br />To HIm Who Was Crucified<br /><br />MY spirit to yours, dear brother;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Do not mind because many, sounding your name, do not understand you;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />I do not sound your name, but I understand you, (there are others also;)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I specify you with joy, O my comrade, to salute you, and to salute those who are with you, before and since—and those to come also,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />That we all labor together, transmitting the same charge and succession;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />We few, equals, indifferent of lands, indifferent of times;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />We, enclosers of all continents, all castes—allowers of all theologies,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Compassionaters, perceivers, rapport of men,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />We walk silent among disputes and assertions, but reject not the disputers, nor any thing that is asserted;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />We hear the bawling and din—we are reach’d at by divisions, jealousies, recriminations on every side,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />They close peremptorily upon us, to surround us, my comrade,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Yet we walk unheld, free, the whole earth over, journeying up and down, till we make our ineffaceable mark upon time and the diverse eras,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Till we saturate time and eras, that the men and women of races, ages to come, may prove brethren and lovers, as we are.
