				Hi,<br /><br />I live not too far from there and there&#039;s no pet store that I&#039;m aware of - and I&#039;m a <br />dog owner so I&#039;m sure I&#039;d have heard if there was anything.<br /><br />What exactly are you looking for? <br /><br />The only pet store I&#039;m aware of is Petland on Steinway between 30th Avenue and 31st Avenue - <br />it&#039;s closer to 30th though, next to the Sprint Store.

				There used to be pet store on Northern Blvd in the National Wholesale Liquidators Plaza on 48th St.&nbsp; Don&#039;t know if it&#039;s still there, but you can take the R to 46th, exit at 48th St, and walk over a block and you&#039;re there.<br /><br />Petco is in Union Square by the NWR station, if you&#039;re ever in the area.

				<br />i miss that old pet shop, the workers were really cool people, i had alot of memories going there picking up feeders (goldfish) to feed my pet shark and eel, those were the days, but now they passed away and its just me and my kitten K@WS and i cant cant good supplies in the Ditmars area now, unless i go to the shoping area near 43rd i think, <br /><br />anyway, if i told you my idea for them expanding the pizza palace corner, you people will think im crazy, lets just say you will not find me supporting them and their over $2.00 per slice of pizza,&nbsp; :roll:

Gemme a break. And he thought my Bichon was a badly cut Poodle. Oy! I think I will continue to shop on the internet for my little guys, and continue to have them groomed in the City.

				There are 2 pet stores on Steinway one b/w 30th ave and 31st ave and one b/w 31st ave and b&#039;way. Both are pretty good for last minute stuff but it&#039;s all about Pet Central!!!! I order from the Pet Central on 23rd Street in the City b/c they deliver for FREE! The manager lives in Astoria so you just call and say it&#039;s an Astoria delivery (so it&#039;s not as often) but VERY convenient. I order 30 lb bags of liter and 40 lb bags of food! MUCH easier than dragging it home. They also have a website. Once you order, your info is stored too, so just call back and tell them same thing as last time...

				http://www.petcentralnyc.com/ <br /><br />It says they&#039;re currently down for maintenance. I just got my order delivered last night! 80 pounds of litter and 30 pounds of food! It&#039;s the 23rd street locale that comes out here. Just mention you know the manager makes the Astoria delivery (either he lives out here or his mother) not their regular delivery guy.

				Since I moved to Astoria last year, I&#039;ve been searching for a pet store to get my cat food nearby.&nbsp; I&#039;ve finally decided that the best way to get her food is through Whiskers in the East Village.&nbsp; The store is on E.9th Street between 2nd and 3rd in Manhattan.&nbsp; But they have an awesome delivery program (it&#039;s a $5 fee).&nbsp; I get my food and now cat litter from them now.&nbsp; Their website is 1800whiskers.com (http://1800whiskers.com)
