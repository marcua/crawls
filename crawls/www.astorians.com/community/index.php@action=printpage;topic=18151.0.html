				I am looking for a great bike place in either the city or preferably the Astoria area.&nbsp; I would like to find something affordable (less than $100 to $200). I know very little about bikes, just need some good wheels! If anybody can help with some info it would be greatly appreciated!&nbsp;

				If you want to spend less than $200 and don&#039;t want to buy it used, then your best bet will probably be Toys &#039;R Us or The Sports Authority.&nbsp; Both on Northern Blvd.&nbsp; A dedicated bike shop (Bike Stop on 38th Street and 28th Avenue in Astoria) usually doesn&#039;t carry adult bikes in that price range.

				Craigslist is another source for used bikes. I often see bikes listed by people moving from the area, etc. that are in great condition.&nbsp; Sometimes the local bike shops have refurbished bikes for sale in your price range. I know that Tony&#039;s Bikes on 23rd Av and 35th St. is one such shop. I would rather support a local bike store than a big box store like Toys R Us, but that&#039;s me.&nbsp; Good luck in your search!

				Hey Billy, hope you don&#039;t mind me hopping on your thread too and asking people about bikes too. I was wondering if anyone could recommend a good bike shop and a good bike? I would like something pretty lightweight, that I could maybe bungee a milk crate to the back of it. I&#039;m going to try biking to school but I have a lot of books and things and live up some steep stairs. Also I would like to buy the bike in Astoria for under $500. Is that wanting too much? I don&#039;t want anything fancy and don&#039;t mind if the bike is used.
