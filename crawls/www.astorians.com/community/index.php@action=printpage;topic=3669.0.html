				To get a greenmarket into a neighborhood - you need to get the support and approval of the local businesses.&nbsp; &nbsp;I haven&#39;t asked any of them - but I just don&#39;t think that the string of veggie stands and the supermarket are going to jump on the greenmarket bandwagon.&nbsp; &nbsp;:cry:

				It is about two blocks away from the 30th Ave train station - if I remember correctly it is across the street from the Astoria Federal Savings Bank and diagonally across from the Trade Fair. It isn&#039;t an overly large park, but it does get a lot of visitors- especially in the summer when they have events. <br /><br />

				Astoria Park is too far from the subway, especially for those of us that are without a car. Athens Park is a visible location to passerbys and is next to a school, so you&#039;d probably get some overflow from families stopping by. It&#039;s actually fairly large. I mean, it&#039;s not Union Square size, but there is no need for something that size in Astoria. It&#039;s also pretty centrally located, only 1 block from the 30th ave stop which would be accessible to people from southern Astoria, not just the Ditmars area.<br /><br />I&#039;d try to meet up. Let us know when, where and the agenda.

				That street between 30th Avenue and Newtown Avenue is also a good place to do it, if Athens Square is an issue.&nbsp; Do you know what the issue was?&nbsp; I say even shut down Newtown Avenue between 33rd and 31st Streets.&nbsp; That would be a nice little area to have a pedestrian/green market thing happening.&nbsp; Anyway, I&#039;ll post again in another year!<br /><br />Here&#039;s where I&#039;m talking about:<br />http://wikimapia.org/#y=40766762&amp;x=-73920393&amp;z=18&amp;l=0&amp;m=a&amp;v=1<br /><br />

				Athens Square is a shaky choice.&nbsp; There is no place for the trucks to load/unload.&nbsp; This is a HUGE issue, and understandably so. I doubt the 30th Ave business people and especially the greengrocers will support the presence of a greenmarket.<br /><br />The reason Astoria Park works is because of the parking lot and good vehicle access.&nbsp; One of my fantasies is to have Shore Blvd shut down (temporarily) for something like a greenmarket.&nbsp; I do understand how some people would find it to be a bit of a haul to Astoria Park (I am not one of them, though).&nbsp; <br /><br />That road between 30th and Newtown is intriguing, I must say.&nbsp; Same problem might happen with regard to the greengrocers etc.<br /><br />What other spaces have people thought of?

				I&#039;m not sure Athens is the best solution -- but I do think the Union Square Greenmarket may be evidence that bringing in vendors may not hurt local businesses but help them.&nbsp; A greenmarket attracts people to a location and the amenities it offers -- beyond just the green goods.&nbsp; Look at the Whole Food/Trader Joes that opened up well *after* the Union Square Greenmarket became a Union Square mainstay.<br /><br />30th Ave food vendors (fish market(s), Trade Fair, produce stands) are a diverse and valuable resource.&nbsp; I think bringing more food to that area would further reinforce the area as a food mecca rather than pull business away. <br /><br />Greenmarkets also attract people with very specific needs -- and have very specific product availability.&nbsp; Seasonal organic local produce is generally a bit more expensive, less diverse, and entirely dependent upon weather/season -- regular fruit/veggie markets are cheaper, with more stuff, and tomatoes in winter.<br /><br />I think the two many market options in the area would be complemented by a greenmarket!<br /><br />cheers,<br />Jayme

				I&#039;d love it if there was a Green Market in Astoria. Usually the one in Union Square is a destination for us on Saturdays, but wouldn&#039;t mind an alternative sometimes. I&#039;d totally go if it were in Astoria Park, too. Could use the exercise, the view of Manhattan and the water, and good local agriculture.

				How about around the 36th ave area? Maybe see if Kaufman would let us borrow some parking lot space once a week? There aren&#039;t many groceries around there, it&#039;s close to the W/N/R/V/and sometimes G. Or the Sacred Blood Church parking lot always looks empty on B&#039;way and 37th, also not very many groceries around.

I have been wondering if there is such a place here in Astoria/LIC.&nbsp; Parking lots are good, too; where my mom lives, they use a City parking lot for the Saturday.&nbsp; People love it and it is very safe.<br /><br />Good luck at that meeting and perhaps I will be there!

				I think the meeting would be to talk with CENYC and see what they are able and are willing to do to have a more vigorous and well used Greenmarket in Astoria.&nbsp; Marcel Van Ooyen, their Executive Director, was very open to the idea of moving one to Athens Square Park, but said when they&#039;d proposed that, the Community Board was not open to the idea and that the 30th Avenue business community was opposed as well.&nbsp; This meeting would be to show CENYC that there is some support for that move, to suggest other possible sites and see if they are open to them, and to find out how we can help them get us a better and bigger Greenmarket.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure we can add items to the agenda if people have other items!

				Thanks Jayme directing me to this conversation!&nbsp; <br /><br />I think if you want to take a look at how a farmers market works in an Athens Square type of environment try taking a look at the farmers market adjacent to Travers Park in Jackson Heights on Sundays.&nbsp; It&#039;s an example of a Queens parks with an existing block and half worth of vendors in a fairly central location where parking is at a premium.&nbsp; The Friends of Travers Park helped to advocate for the farmers market there a few years ago.<br /><br />Glad to hear that you&#039;re meeting with CENYC!&nbsp; Are there plans to present post meeting ideas to the Community Board?

				They (Council on the Environment) tried to get community board approval to move it to Athens Square, but did not get support.&nbsp; I understand Councilmember Vallone, Jr. supports moving the Greenmarket to Athens Square, but haven&#039;t verified that with his office yet.

				I have a friend who works for Gioia and even though they don&#039;t represent us, says she&#039;ll put in a good word (Sunnyside is also attempting to start up a greenmarket)<br /><br />My only concern with the 28th-- Astoria CSA is holding a Member Drive/ Q&amp;A at Cafe Bar on the 27th or 28th with our farmers. We&#039;ve been talking to the owners of CB (since it&#039;s our drop point) and I would slightly afraid if these dates overlap people might want to be at both (me) or get confused. We will keep you posted as to when our farmers give a green light to what date is best for them.

				I don&#039;t think I can make this meeting (at least not until later) but I&#039;m very interested in bringing a greenmarket to Athens Square.&nbsp; As far as the loading and unloading issue goes, there is a greenmarket in front of St Marks Church in the East Village with similiar issues and they manage to make it work.&nbsp; I think Athens Square would be great for the people already in the area, it would attract more shoppers to the existing businesses, it would be great for the farmers because there is already so much foot traffic there (the location on 31st and 14th is out of the way for anyone who doesn&#039;t live right around there, no public transportation etc.) and wonderful for all the urban kids who don&#039;t get access to farmers.&nbsp; Perhaps I&#039;m naive but isn&#039;t the community board supposed to represent the community, not just the businesses?&nbsp; It seems to me that there is quite an interest in better produce in general in this community (see CSA threads) and one day a week of a farmers market is more likely to energize the area rather than threaten the existing vendors.

				I plan to be at this meeting on the 28th.<br /><br />I&#039;d be curious to know how the greenmarket at St Marks Church in the EV handles their parking issues.&nbsp; I understand there is a similar situation in Jackson Heights and they have managed to make it work, too.&nbsp; So, my hope is that my earlier observation about parking will be proven way wrong. :)<br /><br />I was just at Athens Square for the recent Vigil last weekend and was looking at the space and location.&nbsp; It really is in the middle of things, which is cool.&nbsp; It was covered in snow, which made things look smaller, but it would be a wonderful location for a greenmarket.<br /><br />What is the final decision on the time of this meeting?&nbsp; 6 or 6:30?

				Yeah, I hope to be there too.&nbsp; Is there gonna be a way to identify the green market people or hopefully it&#039;ll be a big group and I&#039;ll spot it that way.<br /><br />Another thing we can consider, is to probably talk to homeowner&#039;s groups or other community based orgs and tell them that this will increase the value of the neighb or whatever.&nbsp; I&#039;m just desperate to get a green market in the hood.

				Most of the greenmarkets I can think of are on city property or in the parks.&nbsp; I think there would be insurance/financial and access issues to having one on private property.&nbsp; And frankly an old auto repair lot just sounds unappetizing.&nbsp; Granted, I haven&#039;t seen the space, but I can&#039;t think of a market that isn&#039;t in a park.&nbsp; Also, in terms of parking, for Athens Square there&#039;s the schoolyard next door and one around the corner on 30th street.&nbsp; If the market is on a weekend they could perhaps use that to park the trucks during the day.&nbsp; Also there&#039;s a basketball court behind the park for added selling space &amp;/or parking &amp;/or a place where farmers could set up and have their trucks right there.&nbsp; That would limit the number of farmers but it is another possible space to use.

				First, I&#039;m so glad there is an effort to get a Greenmarket to Astoria. I&#039;m working to start up the Astoria CSA and have been speaking with some businness owners around 30th and here&#039;s some info I gathered that will help us get a greenmarket:<br /><br />1) Many, if not most, of the members on the Community Board are local business owners. I was specifically told by a high ranking officer (as I handed out my CSA fliers) that there is NO WAY a greenmarket will make it to Athens Park. He told me they will vote it down.<br />2) I pushed, pointing out that Union Sq. has turned into a shopping mecca for produce and it could have the same effect here. He replied that Union Sq. super markets are not local-- they are all corporate, making it easier for them to survive, but also they have no ties to the community. Which is why the greenmarket in Union Sq is so effective.<br /><br />Sorry to be such a downer, but there is hope...<br /><br />I think as a community if it&#039;s something we really want we need to be open to other locations if what I was told is true. <br /><br />1) There is a HUGE parking lot of Our Lady Blood (or something) on 36th St. and B&#039;way. There are few, maybe 1, local grocery stores and no grocery stores to compete with in that part. <br />2) There is the Kaufman parking lot on 34th ave and 36th st. Also a school going in nearby and that new grovery store.<br /><br />Anyway, that&#039;s just my heads up and suggestions. I also think moving the greenmarket between the N/W AND the R/V/G stop will make it more appealing to more of the community, esp those that would have interest in this (ie more of the &quot;newer&quot; Astoria population-- those who don&#039;t have businesses or ties to them).<br /><br />I hope to be there Wed to hear how this goes but if I&#039;m not able to make it, please someone post a summation of what happens.

Their interests are certainly important considerations in overall decisions about what to do in a community, but that is not the sole criteria for decision making of this kind.&nbsp; And they may see only competition at first and not some of the other benefits that can come from having a farmer&#039;s market.&nbsp; So perhaps we should find some study or literature that describes the long term effects more broadly (perhaps our Astorians report writer Harlan can concoct something :wink:) and or petitions from residents could perhaps influence their decision making.&nbsp; <br /><br />What&#039;s our next step?

				Folks, if this gets on the Community Board Calendar for discussion, we must work to get major numbers of people to the meeting.&nbsp; This is critical.<br /><br />Personally, I have very little faith in our leadership and feel that the only way to facilitate change is to become more active and a part of it.&nbsp; Anyone can apply to become a member of the Board.&nbsp; <br /><br />We must go to the Community Board Meeting and state our case.&nbsp; The Public also has a three minute window to speak about issues, so if enough advocates speak out, they may approve it.<br /><br />

				<br />Wow, I guess I missed this meeting.&nbsp; I need to get my stuff together.<br /><br />Anyway, I didn&#039;t know there was this much opposition to something that benefits the community.&nbsp; I guess we can also try to ask the local grocers (that I guess are the ones that are afraid of it cutting into their business), if they would like to have a farmer&#039;s market section in their stores or something like that.&nbsp; If they do, I guess everyone wins, they get more business and we get access to locally grown greens.&nbsp; If they don&#039;t we can always say that we offered them the opportunity to take part in some sort of farmer&#039;s market thing and they weren&#039;t into it.&nbsp; I think if we reach out to them and show that we&#039;re not about putting them out of business, they might be more willing to support, or even, not oppose it as much.<br /><br />

				I finally have news to report, sorry for the delay.<br />We are moving forward focusing on the Athens Square Park location.&nbsp; We have some local political support, but I want to wait until they formally sign on to the plan before using their names.<br />The Greenmarket folks are eager to get the ball rolling and we have a draft petition which will be posted online tomorrow once we have the final language.&nbsp; <br />Can folks bring it to their neighbors when they get it and circulate it at the CSA pick-ups?&nbsp; We&#039;re going to need some folks on the streets, probably out in front of supermarkets or in the parks to get additional signatures.&nbsp; We need to have all the signatures by the end of April.

				Is there any news regarding this?&nbsp; <br /><br />I was actually thinking that we have enough people, between the two csa&#039;s and the waiting lists that I bet we could get a great co-op started.&nbsp; I was a member of the Park Slope Food Coop for about 6 months when I lived in Brooklyn and while it can be a pain to work your shift once a month, great produce year round and a mind boggling selection of food at incredible prices was well worth it.&nbsp; Sort of like a year round csa, except for almost anything you want to buy.&nbsp; Being a democratic operation a coop can source things as carefully as they want to and being private can&#039;t be stopped by the community board.<br /><br />Does anybody else have experience with PSFC or any other coops?&nbsp; I remember shopping at the Rainbow Grocery in SF many years ago, which unlike PSFC is open to the public.&nbsp; Prices there are more comparable to other stores, though still somewhat lower.&nbsp; That&#039;s basically a retail business that is owned and run by a cooperative, as opposed to a cooperative that&#039;s run by and for only members. Is anyone interested in investigating this further?&nbsp; Personally I&#039;m partial to the members only model of PSFC but there may be advantages of the other kind I&#039;m unaware of.

				Can we print out the petition for folks to sign a paper version? And where would we return it to?<br /><br />If this is still active and running it would be a great thing to have out at CSA distros for members and non-members to sign. I know Astoria CSA gets 10+ folks at distro asking if the produce is for sale. If we can say no, but hey, sign this petition to get a greenmarket and goods like this!

				Hello??????<br /><br />Is there ANY news on this? I am printing out the petition, possibly w/ a little rewording, and bringing it to Astoria CSA&#039;s distro tomorrow at Cafe Bar. That is... if it&#039;s not too late.<br /><br />If you want to come by and sign the paper version. Please stop by our distribution at Cafe Bar (36th St. and 34th ave), Thursday, July 26, 5pm-7:30pm, even if you are not an Astoria CSA member you can sign this petition to get a greenmarket centrally located in Astoria. <br /><br />Also, please someone provide an address I can send this to once it&#039;s done! I was going to make copies and send it to Vallone and Maloney. Why not push it and show we want it. Maybe even Just Food (who organizes CSAs can help us).<br /><br />I would really LOVE to see a greenmarket, despite being a CSA member. The more local, organic produce, the better! Esp if we can get our greenmarket to accept foodstamps. Now I&#039;m dreaming... (Does anyone know the logistics of this??? I know the Harlem greenmarket accepts and there are enough folks in the neighborhood that could benefit from it.).<br /><br />If not... I guess Gretchen and I will open our co-op!

Food stamps are not actually documents anymore, they&#039;re on plastic like everything else.&nbsp; (When were they actually ever stamps?)

				Hey all,<br /><br />This is a plug to &quot;like&quot; the Queens Greenmarkets (http://&quot;facebook.com/Queensgreenmarkts&quot;) facebook page, and -- regardless of whether you&#039;re a Facebook user or not -- to visit Queens first year round market in Jackson Heights every Sunday 8am-3pm (vendors have been there this entire month despite the brutal cold). It&#039;s a ten minute bike ride from Astoria (I recommend 31st Ave as the preferred route to get there and back).<br /><br /><div align="center">(http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/hs1323.snc4/161976_139579229408987_1348976_n.jpg)</div><br />Support the people bringing you cellared and fresh greenhouse vegetables, fruits and juices (inc. hot cider), delicious pastries and artisan breads (the latter which is an investment in entrepreneurial activities of immigrant women), farmstead cheeses, local honey, wild mushrooms, wild local seafood, pastured poultry and meats, and wine from local vineyards. Textiles recycling, too.<br /><br />And don&#039;t hold your breath or anything, but Astoria might just be getting a new market this coming season.<br /><br />Fingers crossed.
