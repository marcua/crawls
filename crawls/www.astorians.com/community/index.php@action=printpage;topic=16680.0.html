				<br />The January event was largely a good one, though I wonder sometimes where Mr. Stern finds some unexpected topics/tangents.<br />The NY April event is a regular free to the public meeting. But I dont see that it should be of special interest as yet to our neighbors and voters. No anticipated local endorsements.<br /><br />Hopefully a good statewide list will come out of endorsements late April and summer petitioning.<br /><br /><br />http://manhattanlp.org/<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">A Candidates Forum/Debate Night will be held on Monday, April 12, 2010 at 7:00 p.m. at the Ukrainian East Village Restaurant located at 140 2nd Avenue in Manhattan. <br />This event will be hosted by the <br /><span class="bbc_u">Manhattan </span> Libertarian Party and co-sponsored by the <br />Libertarian Party of <span class="bbc_u">Queens </span> County and the <br /><span class="bbc_u">Brooklyn </span> Libertarian Party.<br /><br /><br />...<br />This will be one of the last times you can meet many of the statewide candidates before the LPNY State Convention, which will be held in Albany, New York on Saturday, April 24.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Monday, April12, 2010 <br />7:00 pm <br />Ukrainian East Village <br />140 2nd Ave &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
