				I saw a Timberland bag at an ATM tonight.&nbsp; I phoned it in to the police at 10:15 pm, waited 15 minutes but had to leave before they got there.&nbsp; They called me back about 10:45 when the police arrived, so if you or someone you know lost the bag, there&#039;s your timeline, and you know which bank you were at.&nbsp; I hope the owner and the bag get reunited.

				There was nothing suspicious looking about the bag.&nbsp; It was clean and smooth looking, and in a likely place.<br /><br />What bothers me is that first I called the local PSA, though I wasn&#039;t sure they cover matters outside the projects, and they told me to call 911 or the 114.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t think it was an emergency so I called the 114 (they answered on the second or third ring, by the way) and <em>they</em> told me to call 911.&nbsp; So, if you&#039;re ever waiting for the police in a 911 emergency, have faith that somewhere, somebody&#039;s purse is being saved.<br /><br />This happend on apparently the ONE night out of year when no police offiers were eating at the nearby diner.&nbsp; There are ALWAYS cops eating there, or for other reasons parked in the lot.&nbsp;
