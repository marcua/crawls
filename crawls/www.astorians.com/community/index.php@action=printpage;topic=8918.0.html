				The Post keeps lowering the bar on how pathetic their headlines can get. Either they have junior high school kids writing headlines like these, or they believe their readers have no intelligence or class.<br /><br />Ike Turner was a rhythm and blues &amp; rock and roll pioneer. He started with Ike Turner&#039;s Kings of Rhythm, played piano on the first rock/blues record to be a hit in 1951 titled Rocket 88 with Jackie Brenston at Sun Studios in Memphis, preceeding Elvis by 3 years. He later went on to be the most sought after guitar session man, and formed the Ike and Tine Turner Revue. <br /><br />His accomplishments were later eclipsed by booze, drugs, and the well publicized spousal abuse of his wife Tina, who escaped from his grasp pennyless to evnetually make a big comeback as a solo artist. Ike did redeem himself in recent years, but his years of abuse of Tina left him a tarnished legacy.

				That&#039;s a great headline for witty-ness.&nbsp; He did beat crap out of Tina Turner when they were a couple, and she outlived him.&nbsp; &nbsp;Good for her, and the hell with him.<br /><br />Post and News are about the same, Post is half the price.&nbsp; &nbsp;News trys to come up with same type of headlines, more so in stories printed inside the paper.&nbsp; <br /><br />Tina definatley deserves to live longer, and better, than that creep.
