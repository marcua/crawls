				It&#039;s that time of year again boys and girls - for a new picture on astorians.com!<br /><br />Here are the rules:<br />0. Two submissions per person only - show us your best work.<br />1. Your image should be in digital format.<br />2. The picture needs to be taken with at LEAST at 3mp camera. Scanned images must be HIGH quality. (the bigger the better)<br />3. A small version of your image should be posted to this thread with a brief description of what it is. Please embed the image in the post if you can (use Flickr&#039;s link feature, or wherever you want to host it.)<br />4. The contest starts immediately and will run until January 31. At which time the contest will be closed to entries.<br />5. Astorians will then vote on the submitted images.<br />6. A winner will be announced and the graphic will go live on the homepage shortly thereafter.<br /><br />Further details:<br />Your image will run for a period of weeks or months. It should be a picture that captures some aspect of Astoria, and ideally, should be a wintery theme. On the bottom right hand corner we&#039;ll provide your name/username/link/email whatever you want (in text) so people can link or contact you. Obviously you are giving us permission to use your image on the Astorians homepage for a duration of our choosing by your submission. We reserve editorial right over your photograph&#039;s use on the website, however we will not resell or claim any other rights to your work.
