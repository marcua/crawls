				I understand that broker fee&#039;s can vary, I have read, it can be a month&#039;s worth of rent or 10% of a year&#039;s rent.&nbsp; Does this vary depending on each firm..how expensive the place is..or how much of a sucker a person is?&nbsp; What other expenses should i anticipate on that first month, rather than the rent?&nbsp; Is this also on top of the security deposit you have to pay your landlord? <br /><br />As you can tell I am pretty new at all this.&nbsp; I am looking for an apartment studio or 1 bdr for $1100/mo. that being said, i will most likely end up with a studio.&nbsp; Preferably around the Ditmars area no more than a 15 min walk from the station.&nbsp; I have been looking around craigslist and i have walked around the area, but with my experience no one really posts anything outside there property for any vacancies.&nbsp; Are there any other resources rather than craigslist or a broker?&nbsp; I would love to same some extra cash by doing my own apt hunting.&nbsp; Any help would be much appreciated!

				If you use a broker you can expect to pay a Broker&#039;s fee (usually 1 months rent but these days negotiable), a credit check fee, a security deposit equal to one months rent, and the first months rent.&nbsp; Sometimes there is also an application fee, negotiate that that deducted from the Broker&#039;s fee.&nbsp; The Broker will probably push you to put a deposit down on the apartment, this is ensure that you won&#039;t change your mind before the paperwork is signed.&nbsp;

				Just keep this in mind...you do NOT need to use a broker to find a decent apartment. A broker will definately make your life easier, they can show you lots of places and I&#039;m sure are very knowledgeable about the neighboorhood. However, if you&#039;re willing to do your own research, and have the time to really go through the area and check out different neighboorhoods, scour Craigslist, and look at a lot of different places, you CAN find the apartment you&#039;re looking for. I did all this and am very happy in a 1-bed I found on CL after a 2 week hunt that wasn&#039;t really so bad, in retrospect.<br />oh and p.s.: don&#039;t put any money down on an apt until you&#039;re positive it&#039;s your first choice. I learned this the hard way. don&#039;t let anyone pressure you into making a decision. That said, sometimes you do have to jump on an opportunity. Just know what amenities and circumstances you absolutely want/need (ie, size of apt, close to train,etc) and what are maybe more flexible (proximity to stores, laundry,etc.)<br />hope this is of help!
