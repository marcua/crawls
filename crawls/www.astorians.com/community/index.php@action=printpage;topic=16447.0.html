				I feel that whenever someone says &quot;god bless you&quot; to me it is problematic and I&#039;m bugged by it:&nbsp; 1) Is it a command to god? And really if the speaker believes in god, do he/she really believe they should be issuing commands to &quot;him&quot;? 2) Is it a request to god on my behalf? As a non-believer, hey don&#039;t do me any favors. 3)* Is it mere greeting or custom (like after a sneeze), a habit in a sense, well less troubling than 1 &amp; 2<br /><br />As for the god bless you repeater, well he&#039;s got more troubles than this it seems and god bless him. . .

				one thing i notice alot with all the transplants is that they are bothered by things that have no direct effect on them.&nbsp; one example, just look at the Subway Ettequite thread, alot of complaints about things that are not delaying the train ride.&nbsp; this is New York, not New Hampshire.&nbsp; you are going to come across things that aren&#039;t aesthetically pleasing, but really have no direct effect upon you or what your doing.&nbsp; just take it for what it is and keep it moving..
