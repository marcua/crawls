				Hello All,<br /><br />Last November my partner and I got a puppy.&nbsp; His name is Henry.&nbsp; He is half Jack Russel, half Shitzu and for the most part a very well behaved dog that we love very much.&nbsp; I was wondering do people on OutAstoria meet for play dates? Or, is the a local dog park where we can take Henry?<br />

				The dogs meet in Astoria park in the large field.&nbsp; I think this happens every morning and every evening.&nbsp; I know that there are many on Saturday mornings.&nbsp; Make sure your puppy has all his / her shots for protection.&nbsp; Also, introduce him / her slowly to the group.&nbsp; Someone may be able to let you know the time they meet.

				been dog owners for years, but thanks for the advice on the shots.&nbsp; Our dog is very well taken care of.&nbsp; He interacts well with other dogs and people.&nbsp; As for the dog park.&nbsp; I am upset on the conditions of the dog park in Astoria park.&nbsp; It is in really bad shape, and very unsafe for our pet and other pets to play there.&nbsp; I wish it was as nice as the dog parks in manhattan.&nbsp; &nbsp;Someone told me about the scupture park at the end of Broadway, so I will check it out this weekend.

				Not sure what dog park in Astoria Park that you are referring to.&nbsp; The dog group in Astoria Park meets in a large open field not far from the Hellgate Bridge.&nbsp; It is not an enclosed area.&nbsp;

				This morning I got up and took our dog to the Socarates Sculpture Park at the end of Broadway.&nbsp; What a wonderful park.&nbsp; Lots of friendly dogs along with their owners.&nbsp; Everyone should check it out.&nbsp; Plus if you like Yoga or Tai Chi the sculpture park has a yoga class at 11:00 am, and followed by Tai Chi class, and it&#039;s for free !&nbsp; There were about 30 Yoga members on the park lawn.&nbsp; I am going to do the class next saturday.&nbsp;
