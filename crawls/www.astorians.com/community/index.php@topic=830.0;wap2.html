			Massachusetts standardizes on the OpenDocument format for office productivity software. In other words, goodbye Microsoft Office!<br /><br />http://www.softwaregarden.com/cgi-bin/oss-sig/wiki.pl?OpenFormatMeetingSept2005<br /><br />Peru passes a law encouraging the procurement of Free Software by government.<br />http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fapesol.org.pe%2Fnews%2F197&amp;langpair=es%7Cen&amp;hl=es&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;prev=%2Flanguage_tools

			This is encouraging.<br />I had heard cries for the U.S. government (again in the wake of Katrina) to make their &quot;.gov&quot; websites (in their entirety) standardized and accessible to different platforms of browser other than Internet Explorer (i.e. proprietary, commercial software).<br /><br />Wouldn't it be nice if the secret code that runs the black boxes of electronic voting and used during democratic &quot;elections&quot; in this so-called Federalist Republic also be open-sourced and subject to the scrutiny of the tax-payer who pays for them? ~:-(<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />&quot;Wouldn't it be nice...&quot;-The Beach Boys

			Just think how affordable a personal computer could be if say, Dell shipped them empty of MS crap and instead included a (free) Open Source system on CD. A family of even modest means could purchase a the latest hardware system for peanuts. Just about any school, start-up enterprise, or group could outfit themselves with computers.<br /><br />And I don't think this would hurt manufacturers, either. After all, they pay for the licensing fees for built-in Windows software, and pass that cost on to the consumer.<br /><br />Licensing fees are among the biggest sources of $$$ for Micro$oft.
