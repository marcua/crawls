				I don’t know about you, but I’m&nbsp; one of those chicks that prefers to give high fives rather than hugs when saying hi, not that I don’t like physical contact, that’s just the way I prefer to say hi, unless it’s a wave and a smile or a formal hand shake. Today in particular, this random blog written by a stranger Getting Real about excessive High Fives (http://gettingrealrecord.com/2011/03/25/getting-real-about-excessive-high-fives/)&nbsp; at Wordpress called my attention because even my Snapple bottle fact read: “It’s cleaner to give kisses than high fives”<br />&nbsp;So I chose to read it because for some unknown reason high 5′s seemed to be the topic of the day.<br />&nbsp;The author of this blog post explains how she prefers not to give high fives since she has always been left hanging by her brother, when he pulled one of those “too slow” moves. Although she decides in the end to “stick to her guns” and claims she won’t give high fives, I feel like I’m more comfortable giving high fives rather than hugs or whatever other way of greeting there is.<br />&nbsp;Everyone has their way they feel comfortable in greeting people. Depends on the person’s character and way of being, some people are more touchy than others, while some of us might not be as comfortable with that, in a sense. I can see why the Snapple fact might say kisses are cleaner, our hands touch lots of things throughout the day,and we constantly become in contact with money, people, dirty things etc…but for that there’s an easy solution —&gt; <strong>wash them constantly</strong>!&nbsp; I know I do,and hopefully you are one of those people who do too, so although&nbsp; I’m going against my Snapple bottle caps advice, I much rather give high fives than kisses! There’s no wrong or right way to say hi to people, except when is formal, but other than that whatever you’re most comfortable with is fine, as long as it’s done without being rude.<br /><br /><br /><br />
