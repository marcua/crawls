				2 BDR Apartment Needed for Shoot - Astoria<br />Hey guys, I have a new startup with scripted web show about video game culture seeking an apartment to shoot in.&nbsp; The apartment is preferably occupied by twenty-something bachelors who have television and game consoles.<br /><br />Requirements:<br /><br />Frequency<br />2 Saturdays per month<br />12 months<br />5 hours per Saturday<br /><br />Size<br />2 or 3 bedrooms<br />Largish living room (primary set)<br />Moderate to spacious kitchen<br /><br />Location<br />Anywhere in Astoria is highly preferable although we will consider certain Manhattan neighborhoods as well<br /><br />Condition<br />Prior to each shoot, apartment must be in usable condition<br />After each shoot, we will leave your space in found condition or cleaner<br /><br />Compensation<br />$50 per month<br /><br />Other Compensation Options<br />If you are willing to consider non-money payment, we are willing to consider teaching film/production, and post-production skills.&nbsp; This is a chance to get hands-on experience with a tight-knit, professional crew.<br /><br />We&#039;re looking to build a long standing working relationship with you.&nbsp; If interested, please contact goodgametv@gmail.com with precise description of your apartment, location, and availability.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks.<br />

				I understand low-budget, but taking over someone&#039;s 2bdrm apt. for $50/month?!!!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D I hope you find that. My husband does film shooting and he pays his assistant (who would normally work for free-as you might know, production doesn&#039;t get paid ST! on indie film sets) more than that per day. Are you looking for something that&#039;s vacant? 5 hours...does that include set up and take down time?

				5 hours includes setup and take down time.<br /><br />You&#039;re right.&nbsp; $50 isn&#039;t a lot.&nbsp; But it&#039;s a really cool show.&nbsp; We&#039;re looking for someone who&#039;s really into this kind of thing as opposed to someone who&#039;s looking to make money out of renting their apartment.&nbsp; Also, the going rate for renting a modest apartment in Manhattan is $200 for 24 hours.
