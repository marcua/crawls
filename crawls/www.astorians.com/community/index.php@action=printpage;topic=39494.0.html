				30 million, huh? Well that should get a new basketball court, some grass seed for the soccer pitch, 1/2 of a dog run and painting the pool... or most of it.

				I dont&#039; like the idea of a soccer field in the middle of the track.&nbsp; I think it would cause confusion and interfere with the people using the track.

				The history of the Astoria Park Track&nbsp; .Many do not recall we had 2 baseball fields in the center.They were<br />removed and the&nbsp; grassy area&nbsp; was put in place.Why not add for those who like to work out as they do on the outer<br />&nbsp;area Adult exercise areas.<br /><br /><br />Cassie

				To me it would benefit all an outside fitness area. Adults exercising may grunt and groan afterward but he noise level is low in this area.From early spring till late Fall truth till we freeze out side someone is always exercising in or around the track.<br /><br /><br />Lets hope the Elected officials listen<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font">. </span><span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font">Put the soccer field elsewhere.</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">Cassie</span></span>

				In addition to the daily adult exercise taking place I even witnessed ballroom dancing practice in the middle of the track- a couple with a coach. It was really nice to watch. Also the children&#039;s track &amp; field program kept me entertained while I slogged around the track during the sweltering summer. The kids were so cute doing their long jumps, javelin throws, hurdles. They were having so much fun despite the heat and humidity. A soccer field requires too much square footage at the expense of the general public. And why does the park have to be partitioned off in sections for this and that special interest group? How about leaving the park alone for a change? In the crowded city we live in it&#039;s nice to have some OPEN green space. While we&#039;re at it-the bike lane project within the park ended up being a disaster. I hated it from the get go and couldn&#039;t believe how ridiculous the idea was. It took the geniuses quite a while and a lot of money to come to the same conclusion.

I also watched the children on the track.It was amazing They had a great time<br />This is a heavily used area.<br />Residents in this area cannot complained about the noise as of now from the Track area but wait till soccer games go on.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Leave the track alone</strong><br /><br /><strong>Cassie</strong></span></span>

				Cassie I think the demand for a soccer field reached fever pitch (excuse the pun) after the skate board park was built. The soccer buffs boo hoo-ed and wailed and whined how unfair it was that skateboarders got a piece of the Astoria park pie, but not them. Well, too bad. Life is unfair. The park is too small for a soccer field. Go to Rainey Park or Ward&#039;s Island to play soccer. They can also jump on the 7 train and head to Flushing Meadow Park.

				Again I agree with you.<br />I wish I was young again with the skate park.They do not make noise either.<em> </em><br /><br /><em>YOU ARE 100 % correct .Time will tell on a soccer field</em><br />I am surprised that the neighborhood has not voice their concerns on noise and parking&nbsp; for events.<br /><br /><br />Cassie
