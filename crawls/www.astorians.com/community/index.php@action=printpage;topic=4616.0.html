				Yeah, I was a big Ginza fan so I went back the week of their reopening about a month ago and it was a big disappointment.&nbsp; The the menu was totally different and much more expensive--and definitely no more great specials.&nbsp; I think the staff might have even been different.&nbsp; Also, I don&#39;t think they have hot sake anymore.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am pretty upset because I love sushi and Ginza was so cheap I could afford to go once a week.<br /><br />Maybe it will go back to normal but I doubt it.&nbsp; I guess it&#39;s back to Go Wasabi for now.&nbsp; I want old Ginza back!!&nbsp; &nbsp;:cry:

				Add me as another disappointed by the new Ginza.<br /><br />A few weeks ago I called up to place a delivery order for my boyfriend and I. After rattling off the order to the guy on the phone, he informs me that they no longer have the items we wanted because they are under new management and the menu has been changed. Ok, not a big deal. We decided to just go with very simple items you can get at most Japanese restaurants (edemame, a couple rolls, etc.). So he takes my address and says it&#39;ll be about 25 minutes until the order is sent out. Again, no problem.<br /><br />So we wait.<br /><br />20 min...30 min...45 min...At this point, I call them back and am informed that the order is on it&#39;s way. Ok, maybe it was a busy night. I&#39;m not going to complain. <br /><br />Another 20 min pass. It&#39;s over an hour.<br /><br />I call back again and this time a woman answers. I ask about the order and there is a long pause. She asks what was ordered and then puts me on hold. A minute passes and she comes back to tell me that the order was <em>lost</em> and they would have to give it to the kitchen again. At this point we were over it. I told her to forget it and we ended ordering from Michael&#39;s, our old standby. We haven&#39;t been back or tried to order from Ginza since.<br /><br />I&#39;m bummed that it&#39;s under new management so soon after opening, but it always looked empty in there when I walked past it during the week.&nbsp; :-(

				Maybe with this new approach, the customers will continue to stay away.&nbsp; What strangeness!&nbsp; I would guess that the $16.99 all you can eat sushi special is no longer?
