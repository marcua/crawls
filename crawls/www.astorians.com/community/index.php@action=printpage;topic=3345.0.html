				Okay, so it&#39;s been a few years, but I&#39;m getting married in a couple of weeks and would like to rip most of the hair from my most sensitive of areas in celebration.<br /><br />Can anyone recommend a good place in Astoria for a Brazilian wax (as well as leg and underarm)?<br /><br />Names of specfic pain practitioners would also be of assistance.<br /><br />Thank you!

				Ha ha Cary, you&#39;re awesome. Okay, I&#39;m game. I like Shobha on Madison and 57th (though they have a location downtown too). Also not in Astoria but... honestly if you don&#39;t do this often and you want a nice job done, you should treat yourself by going someplace nice. I&#39;ve heard really good things about Bliss too.

				Unfortunately, like jewelry cleaning, shoe repair, and TraderJoe products, I go into Manhattan for the waxing as well.<br />The CHEAPEST [good] Brazilian is in Chelsea (go figure) at the Beauty and Youth Spa: 6th Ave between 11th and 12th streets. It&#39;ll run you like $25. And interesting conversation with a random Russian woman (not the gentlest of folk). Walk-in service.<br />The BEST and most expensive is the legendary <strong>J Sisters</strong> in midtown. This is where I went for my first Brazilian because of their reputation and renown. But at $80, it&#39;ll set you back some, but the waxers there are top of the line. Make reservations a few weeks ahead of time to get your desired time slot (probably not as hard to get an appt now as when bikini season was just launching in Spring)<br /><br />

				I believe I&#39;ve said the same thing elsewhere on this board, for a different subject, but I would have to blow a 3.5 on the breathalyzer before you could make me get one of &#39;em Brazilian things!

				i&#39;m shopping for a new salon that does waxing. up until about five minutes ago i went to &quot;REJUVE&quot; which is on 23 street by the pastry place that&#39;s being renovated. the first time i went there the young woman who waxed my legs was AMAZING and it was $25; when i went back to get a bikini wax it was an equally pleasant experience and i believe it cost $30.<br /><br />i went back yesterday to get my legs done again and the woman who did it this time had no clue what she was doing. i sat through a painfully hot wax done by someone without any experience and i was charged $40 dollars. i called them this morning and spoke to the woman who waxed me and complained she gave me an appointment for five. i went in today at five and was rewaxed, the woman who did it did a mediocre job and i was only given $5 dollars back. <br /><br />i was tired of complaining so i just went home with my poopie wax and five dollars in hand.<br /><br />while i have been recommending rejuve to everyone i know i take this time to formally take back my recommendation- the quality of the service has gone done hill, quick. i must say i&#39;m very disappointed.<br /><br />i am looking for a new place to get waxing. it does not have to be in astoria but it does have to be good. any leads?

				I had a very good wax --&nbsp; not Brazilian --&nbsp; at Metamorphosis Day Spa on 56th between<br />Lex &amp; Park. And according to their City Search page, they&#039;re still doing great waxes.<br /><br />For something like this, I&#039;d go for quality and pay a little more. You&#039;re talking about a <br />sensitive area and if it doesn&#039;t go well at a cheap place, you&#039;ll regret it.<br /><br />That said, here&#039;s a link to their City Search page with reviews:&nbsp; <br /><br />http://newyork.citysearch.com/profile/7160325/new_york_ny/metamorphosis_day_spa.html<br /><br />

				Cool coincidence! He must be very thoughtful.<br /><br />It&#039;s a nice place. I had the wax I mentioned and another time they had a great package<br />called &quot;playing footsie&quot; where you got a facial and a reflexology foot treatment at the same<br />time. Very relaxing. You should check their website for any specials - I think you have to see <br />them online and then mention when you book your treatments. <br /><br />Have fun.

				I go to Eve&#039;s Nails, conveniently located in Astoria. It&#039;s on 30th Ave., two blocks east from the subway stop (means the street numbers are getting smaller). It&#039;s really inexpensive and I&#039;ve never had a problem. My friend is the one who introduced me there, she&#039;s been getting brazilians from that place for a couple years now (or was before she moved to TX,&nbsp; :|)<br /><br />Ah, I found the address: <br />30-09 30th Ave.<br />Phone Number: 718-956-1300

				Hello, hello.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been getting all the hair ripped out of my nether regions for about 3 years now...here are some places to check out.....&nbsp; <br /><br />Currently, I go to Unique Eyebrow Threading Salon on 6th Avenue between 24th and 25th Streets in Chelsea/Flatiron.&nbsp; While obviously not in Astoria, it&#039;s around the corner from my office, so every 3-4 weeks, I am there on my lunchbreak wincing my way through Brazilians.&nbsp; To be honest, it&#039;s less painful each time since the hair grows back much &quot;thinner&quot;.&nbsp; The good thing about them is that they use &quot;Sugar Wax,&quot; which is an all-natural, honey-based wax that is free of chemicals.&nbsp; My skin is so sensitive every time I used&nbsp; &quot;regular&quot; wax (hello, J Sisters), the irritation was much worse.&nbsp; Also, some claim that sugaring tends to be less painful because it sticks to the hair and not the skin, so when they pull it off, they are ONLY pulling the hair and not pulling the skin as much.&nbsp; The women there are primarily Indian and they are so sweet...if you get it done by Heena or Roma, they will talk to you the whole time and trust me - any diversion helps.&nbsp; Talk to them about the weather, their kids, where they live, your job, your fiance, ANYTHING. There, it&#039;s about $35 pre-tax and tip.<br /><br />Other experiences I&#039;ve had it done have been at J Sisters (I, too, went there for my 1st brazilian ever.&nbsp; SO EXPENSIVE - $85 - and the woman barely spoke to me at all other than to reprimand me for shaving up until that point and then again when it was over to try and hock some $20 jar of &quot;serenity&quot; cream or something ...just rip rip rip, ultra-painful, very impersonal - at least it was fast) and I, too, went to Eve&#039;s Nails on 30th Ave once (okay, around $30-35, the women there are nice, but they use chemical wax as well). <br /><br />All in all, you just have to grin and bear it, not be modest at ALL, and be ready to tip well if they&#039;re quick and pleasant in the midst of some not-so-pleasant moments!&nbsp; Good luck!

				Sometimes I get them threaded there, and they do a great job, but actually in Astoria at Gigi&#039;s Salon on 30th Avenue there is a girl who does an EXCELLENT job threading.&nbsp; If you call and make an appointment to get threaded there, I&#039;m sure she&#039;s the one who would do it.&nbsp; It&#039;s worth trying, if not for any other reason than to compare it to eyebrow waxing.

				There is an excellent Spa around the corner from the Cup Cafe - 35th Avenue at about 36th Street.&nbsp; You won&#039;t believe you&#039;re in Astoria once you see the inside of this spa.&nbsp; The woman who does the waxing trained for two years in Ireland . . . she&#039;s excellent.<br /><br />Spa Hydra<br />35-11 36th Street <br />2 floor<br />Long Island City, NY 11102 <br />(718) 267-7991 <br />spahydra.com <br /><br />A comment from someone on yelp.com<br />This spa is a hidden gem (it&#039;s above the cup diner). I was able to get a last minute appointment, and was treated like royalty. The spa manicure &amp; pedicure was luxurious.&nbsp; Eyebrow shaping is done with tweezers as opposed to wax (unless you insist) and it&#039;s a much better result (ask for Crystal).&nbsp; The staff was polite, the space was beautiful, the services were first-class, and best of all: the prices were reasonable.

				<span class="bbc_u">UPDATE:</span>&nbsp; Based on astoriagirl&#039;s tip about Spa Hydra and the reviews I read on Citysearch, I made an appointment for a bikini wax today and it was great!&nbsp; It is pretty tucked away, above Cup Diner, and I think I was the only client there first thing on a Monday.&nbsp; Anyway, the women working were very nice and I was escorted into a wax room with serene music playing and a very calm atmosphere.&nbsp; I had a French Bikini Wax (no Brazilian this time).<br /><br />Barbara was my &quot;wax technician&quot; and did a great job.&nbsp; She was REALLY quick, friendly, personable, talked to me throughout, gave me tips on avoiding ingrown hairs, etc.&nbsp; Plus she wore gloves (big plus) and I couldn&#039;t really tell because I was facing the opposite way, but I think she used a separate &quot;popsicle stick&quot; each time she dipped in.&nbsp; The wax itself was different than most salon wax - it was blue in color and not too hot.&nbsp; I think they use a more all-natural type that is very non-irritating afterwards.<br /><br />The whole thing was over within 15 minutes.&nbsp; I&#039;m assuming if I had gotten &quot;That Kind&quot; of wax it would have taken longer but only by a few minutes.&nbsp; Next time I go, I&#039;ll give it a shot!&nbsp; <br />

				there used to be a really good person at Salon Gigi, but then she left because she was having a baby.&nbsp; A guy replaced her and he was so nervous, his hands were so cold and shaky that the entire experience was awful.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never gone back.&nbsp; Spa Hydra is one great place to go . . . I&#039;m sure there are others, but the Spy Hydra person is completely professional, fast and confident.

				Take my word for it: Shobha Soho is the place to go. Consistent and clean. They don&#039;t really chat you up but they get the job done.

				I go to Natura Spa on Broadway and Steinway St.&nbsp; I like Marina, but have also had other people do it and it&#039;s always come out nice.&nbsp; Plus, it&#039;s only $30 for a brazilian wax.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had other parts done there.&nbsp; I usually make my appt the same day, as my schedule is pretty hectic, and I&#039;ve never had a problem getting in when I wanted.

				Hey everyone. Long time reader, first time poster. Based on the reviews on here, I opted to stop by <strong>SpaHydra</strong> today for a Brazilian wax. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. I&#039;ve had one wax before, at a terrible place in the Village, and have been incredibly resistant to the idea of trying it again. I&#039;m going away on a beach vacation next week, and this seemed a good a time as any to give it another go.<br /><br />Everyone mentioned that the place was hard to find, but I had no trouble. They have a huge banner outside their building that says &quot;Spa Hydra&quot;. It&#039;s impossible to miss. Perhaps this is new?<br /><br />The waiting area is serene and beautiful, and I was the only person waiting. I got there 20 minutes early because their site said that first-timers needed to fill out paperwork. There was no paperwork handed to me, but I did get taken in early. <br /><br />Due to my sensitive skin, I opted to pay the extra $10 for the supposedly gentler &quot;hard wax&quot; rather than the strip wax. As mentioned in previous posts, all of their products are organic. The hard wax is essentially a wax that dries on your body, and then the hair is peeled off with the actual wax. Crystal worked on me, and she was very sweet and thorough. Where other places have left stray hairs, she did her best to catch everything she could. My body kept tensing (naturally) and she was very understanding and accommodating. She did a wonderful job of making me feel comfortable in an uncomfortable situation. <br /><br />The entire process was done within 30 minutes and, considering the procedure, was relatively pain free. Yes, it hurt, but much less so than it had the previous time, and than it could have. <br /><br />The end result was so fabulous and the process/price so temperate that I plan to start having them done monthly. If you&#039;re looking for a great relatively-inexpensive wax in Astoria (did I mention that it took me 10 minutes to get there?) then SpaHydra is HIGHLY recommended. Ask for Crystal!

				i second that! i went to crystal last week for a bikini wax and she was very nice, gentle, and professional. the spa is beautiful and all of their products are organic. you can find cheaper, but again, you pay for what you get for. a brazillian with the peel-off hard wax runs $65.

				I highly recommend Marina at Natura Spa. She is extremely nice and friendly, but also super professional. She focused on getting the job done exactly how you want it. She listens to what you want and doesn&#039;t try to tell you &quot;how it is&quot; or charge you extra for making the line look neat, doing the back, etc. If you&#039;ve gone to a few wax places before, you know why this is crucial.<br /><br />I have had my share of Brazilian wax experiences, and until now I thought the best, most meticulous job was done by a flaky, self-aggrandizing Italian woman in a small salon in Rome. Now I know that you can have a great wax close to home without the social or physical pain that can accompany the process.<br /><br />Natura Brazilian Spa looks nice and clean. I went straight to the back for an overdue Brazilian. Marina warned me that after 3 months of neglect, it would be a bit more painful. But she did it so quickly that it was relatively easy to take. Also, she is a perfectionist - she treats the wax like a work of art, and her attention to detail resulted in the best down-there haircut ever! And she was as gentle as she was efficient. She put several soothing creams on at the end that smelled really great, and there is no wax residue left at all. I cannot say enough good things about my wax experience with Marina at Natura Spa. And I am very, very picky.<br /><br />Did I mention that I paid $30 for the best Brazilian wax imaginable? I am actually feeling vain about how I look down there right now! Never thought it could look this good. I gave her a 50% tip! She works 6 days a week and definitely needs it - she is older and her hands are always getting cramped (though you don&#039;t see her complaining).<br /><br />I say stay in Astoria and head over to see Marina, unless you like to ride the train and overpay to have Manhattan &quot;beauticians&quot; do a mediocre job and make you feel like you owe them for going down there.

				I second the recommendation for Crystal. I just went to Spa Hydra a couple of weeks ago after<br />not being able to get an appointment with my regular person at Sothys on West 57th St. <br /><br />I opted for their Signature Facial and an eyebrow wax. The facial was wonderful. It&#039;s 90 minutes and<br />includes an enzyme peel, extractions, deep cleansing plus a very relaxing aromatherapy hand, foot and<br />scalp massage. <br /><br />The eyebrow wax was perfect. I hadn&#039;t realized there was a difference between a &quot;shaping&quot; and a &quot;tidy&quot;.<br /><br />She explained the difference and the prices and then declared that all I needed was a tidy. I appreciated not<br />being pressured into paying for something higher priced. <br /><br />The spa is really great. Quiet, clean and very comfortable. I even used their shower facility because my hair<br />got a little greasy from the massage. Again, very clean, sanitary facility. Plus the locker room space is large <br />so even if you&#039;re not there alone, like I was, you&#039;d have enough elbow room.<br /><br />I&#039;ve already told my regular person that I intend to alternate appointments with her and Spa Hydra. Plus<br />for what I got done at Spa Hydra, it was $60 less. <br /><br />Happy spa-ing!<br /><br />
