				I too feel uncomfortable posting here for so many reasons.<br /><br />How about, if you dont see it here dont eat there.&nbsp; <br /><br />Merm, moderators,&nbsp; can we start a restaurant bar cafe review section.&nbsp; simple as; a place gets its own thread and people can comment from there?&nbsp; That way its an ongoing review of a place.&nbsp; Sort of like zagat with chow hound or city search commentary.&nbsp; Keep the section only to Astoria/ LIC perhaps.&nbsp; Have a few rules maybe such as no out and out bashing and keeping in mind a restaurants rep is on the line.

				Astoria Diner is out for me too, but not for the usual reasons.&nbsp; I was in a nearby fruit/vegetable/grocery type place online with 3 other people waiting to pay and someone who works for the diner came in and put his stuff right up on the counter and took out a roll of money to pay.&nbsp; As if his time was more valuable than everyone else&#39;s.&nbsp; I pushed his stuff off the scale, put my stuff on and told the clerk if they helped him I would never be back.&nbsp; He agreed and made the guy wait.&nbsp; I told the diner guy...owner? manager?...that while he may not be in his diner, he was wearing a shirt that represented the business and his actions reflect on it.&nbsp; I told him, I&#39;d never eat there again, then called the diner and let them know too ;)

				Is Astoria Diner the one on Steinway south of Broadway maybe two blocks?&nbsp; I&#39;ve only eaten there once, when I picked up breakfast on the way home from the gym.&nbsp; The food was pretty okay, but the people working there all seemed like that had better things to do than deal with me and my takeout egg white omlettes...<br />As for the worst, there are a couple places that I won&#39;t eat at again, but I&#39;d rather not name names out of the blue.

				Are we not allowed to say we had a bad experience at a certain restaurant?&nbsp; I would rather know about someone&#39;s experiences at a restaurant, and I would welcome that establishment addressing the posts here, and perhaps changing for the better because of it.&nbsp; In 2003, I wrote a review to Citysearch based on the bad service I received at Telly&#39;s Taverna.&nbsp; Citysearch rejected my review but that&#39;s to be expected.&nbsp; They don&#39;t touch controversy.&nbsp; I had wanted to try the restaurant out based on all the wonderful reviews of the place.&nbsp; I am of Latin descent and went with a few friends, who were also of Latin descent.&nbsp; This should not have been an issue in the least.&nbsp; From the moment we walked in, we were treated with obvious dislike or should I say contempt, to the point where we actually walked out of the restaurant for fear if we actually dared order something, they would spit in our food.&nbsp; When the waitress finally came around to get our order, our questions about the vague menu were met with sarcastic remarks about rice being our favorite dish, and the like.&nbsp; She was very rude and it was completely uncalled for.<br /><br />I can think of no reason one should treat her potential customers so rudely, other than she didn&#39;t need/desire our business, and was fairly ignorant of Latin culture. The ignorance of a few doesn&#39;t speak for the masses, and I&#39;d encourage others to patronize the many other fine restaurants in Astoria, Greek included, where customers are treated with respect and decency no matter their color.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have not had an experience like this ever before or since then (and have not gone back to Telly&#39;s).&nbsp; I am also half Italian, and have always been welcoming and sharing of other cultures especially food, being torn between two different ones myself.&nbsp; Many establishments here have been quite happy to share those things with me, and I&#39;m happy that Telly&#39;s is the exception here.&nbsp; &nbsp;But also sad.

				Daisy, you should feel free to print what you like at any time. Considering your experience there, you certainly should.&nbsp; I was expressing my personal opinion.&nbsp; As a chef that has worked at and owned an establishment I know what customer opinion (good or bad) can do to a place.<br /><br />Can you imagine what its like for the owner of a place that has put his life savings, his every waking moment and love into creating and running the restaurant? <br />Then a waiter in a bad mood, a line cook who put too much salt in a dish, a hostess who triple booked your table, the chef called in sick, ruins your experience and because of that one thing you dont go back, tell people it sucked or wrote a bad reveiw?&nbsp; Its a tough business and its a juggling act to make it work. They are not just selling a product based on taste and packaging, there is also lots of human factor involved and it all must work perfectly just so you have at least an ordinary evening let alone a great one.<br /><br />Yes, its their business choice but I try and give the benefit of the doubt when I can.&nbsp;

				I think if the comments are tasteful that this can be a service to the community. If they are just personal attacks that&#39;s a different thing, but we are talking about local businesses here. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any need to protect local businesses that discriminate, are unsafe in food production, serve bad food, or don&#39;t assist the neighborhood they live in (think the guy that did nothing to help the kids that were getting beat up a couple months ago).<br /><br />I don&#39;t think restaurants deserve any special insulation just because their reputation is on the line. Anyone who owns a business puts their reputation on the line, whether they own a convenience store, restaurant, coffee shop, food cart, or grocery store. There&#39;s also a positive side to this kind of discussion in that it allows places to address the complaints/concerns of their customers - this can potentially boost business (i.e. fire the waiter that is turning away your customers, or fix your roach problem, or don&#39;t discriminate against people who are not your race).<br /><br />This is just my opinion so far.

				While restaurants shouldn&#39;t receive special protection, a considered view and careful description of an evening&#39;s events should be given.&nbsp; Having never been in the restaurant business, I have no special attachment. Goodness, I&#39;m not even a foodie.&nbsp; You (plural) do go on about food on this board.&nbsp; For me, it is all pearls before swine.<br /><br />People tend to overreact to the most basic of situations and then relish in the pouting about it. When this happens it isn&#39;t fair to the restaurant.<br /><br />Fatty&#39;s, mentioned in another thread, is a perfect example of this.&nbsp; The owners are Sue and Fernando who know me by face if not by name. Wonderful and warm are great descriptions of them. Saw their establishment getting some crap about slow service and a general attitude about not caring about it. My experience is the polar opposite. Recently went with two others to eat there. We had a long wait and the waitress was being inattentive. We ended up leaving before the food came because we were hungry and people who had come in after us received their food before us. Drinking and talking with good company kept us busy until the hunger pangs were kicking in and we decided it best to leave.<br /><br />The owners were informed and tried to comp our drinks and offer the food for free. They explained they had a newly hired kitchen staff and were working out the kinks and they were sorry for the mix up. We refused the drink comp and said no thanks, we were really hungry and needed to go eat but did not want something for nothing.<br /><br />Next time I was there with three people they recognized me and insisted that the drinks be free for all of us and the meals were 2 for 1. I respect their commitment to being good hosts and concern for customers. If I had just stormed out and never come back to give them another chance, I would have missed out on a great meal and a nice evening for practically no cost. It is a tough business, but nothing and no one is perfect. Hopefully negative reviews will be tempered and one time bad experiences will not be presented as repeat poor service experiences.<br />

				There was a really interesting Greek place on Broadway (that has since closed, it&#39;s now a Wine Store) which always looked like it might have good food.&nbsp; I could never get served there.&nbsp; I did manage to get a menu on one of my three visits, but the waitress would not come over to the table and after waiting and waiting, we gave up and left.&nbsp; I think there are some places that aren&#39;t really that open to people from all backgrounds.

				I would like to clarify that my low opinion of Astoria Diner is based on THREE bad experiences. (I&#39;ve actually gone in there four times--the time I just stopped in for a coffee-to-go in the morning was a perfectly good experience.)&nbsp; I wanted to like Astoria Diner because they have that outdoor seating area, but three instances of very slow, apathetic, unfriendly service and lackluster food are enough--and I&#39;ve never actually seen anyone sitting in that outdoor area, anyway.

				Okay a few bits.. First of all, fatty&#39;s is pretty good.. BUT IT is SOOOO SLOW! I ended up taking a walk, coming back waiting, took another walk.. then the food finally arrived 52 minutes after we ordered. I&#39;ll still go back though, but I&#39;d call my order in ahead of time. <br /><br />There is/was a diner on Stienway closer towards the Krash side with HORRIBLE COFFEE And Crap service. <br /><br />As far as laundrymats go.. Drop off your clothes. It&#39;s SOOO&nbsp; much more pleasant.<br />

				When I first moved into the neighborhood in November of 1998, I asked my sister and a friend of hers to help me put my tiny Apt. together while I was in Florida visiting my mother.<br />&nbsp;My sisters&#39; friend &quot;Lenni&quot;, as Elleni...I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve miss-spelled that, but it&#39;s feminine.

Mean while the waiters were talking about the size of the girls chests and their &quot;funny&quot; hair..in Greek. OOOhhhh that secretive tongue....what are the chances they would understand us....well fellas...Lenni understood every word and translated in verbatim to my sister. They were about to walk out when their food actually arrived with a sweet smile and a wink from &quot;Gus&quot;.<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#39;ve never eaten in there in the eight years that I&#39;ve lived in Ditmars.

No obvious announcement, just a revamped menu that got rid of all the distinctive, high-quality items (homemade chili topped with avocado chunks) in favor of all the mundane typical diner-fare (greasy Roumanian shell steak with a side of pallid frozen vegetables). <br /><br />They used to have great sandwiches with fresh ingredients. They used to serve real <strong>Kesso</strong> yogurt with fresh fruit and homemade granola, drizzled with greek honey for brunch. All that is gone. Now you&#39;d be hard-pressed to differentiate them from any other Queens diner. In this vein, the food wasn&#39;t <em>bad</em>, but having known its prior incarnation as a <em>real</em> eatery, the <em>overwhelming disappointment </em>is what makes this the worst (and saddest) eatery now.

				I&#39;m a sucker for the big-open-space, lots-of-natural-light ambiance of Cup so I forgive them a lot, even though it&#39;s a hike from my apartment. &nbsp;But the quality of food and service are definitely hit-or-miss. &nbsp;<br /><br />Last Saturday I went there for a 3:30 pm breakfast (sigh) and the waitress was extremely friendly...and extremely slow, despite not being extremely crowded. &nbsp;A couple times I had to ask another waitress to go get her, then she would come back with my food or my check, friendly smile on her face.<br /><br />The food was just OK, but just OK was fine...you know how sometimes that&#39;s all you really need?

				I heartily concur with all commentary about the Cup... what a waste of a great space! I&#39;ve always thought the food was subpar -- I&#39;ve tried different things on the menu and always found whatever I&#39;ve gotten to be pretty bland. I&#39;d rather head down to Michael&#39;s where the food is consistently better (though Michael&#39;s in the summertime is brutally humid and their french fries leave much to be desired -- what diner has bad fries??). <br /><br />Checked out the Park Kafe on 29th Street and 30th Avenue a couple weeks ago and found the food to be pretty good, but the service left much to be desired -- our sodas were sitting on the bar so long all the ice melted. Anyone else check this place out? I&#39;m wondering if it was just a bad day.

				3 months after this thread was last updated, I just had to add one more restaurant to the list of worst restaurants. <strong>BELAIRE DINER </strong> on Broadway and 21st Street. <br /><br />I ordered three meals to be delivered; consisting of corned beef and hash, beverages, sausage, eggs, etc. It was a decent sized breakfast. Halfway through the meal, after taking in a spoonful of hash, I noticed a roach on the top of my potatoes. I immediately called the diner and demanded to speak with the manager. He apologized and told me that he would give me a full refund. I waited 5 days for the refund to post. Nothing. I called my bank to check on any transactions coming into my account. Nothing. I disputed the charge and now I&#39;m here to blow some steam.<br /><br />If the diner decides to dispute my charge back, I&#39;ll be back here to post pictures. :x
