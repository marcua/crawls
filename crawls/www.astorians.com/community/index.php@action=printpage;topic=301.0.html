				Hi everybody:<br /><br />Trinity Lutheran Church, on 31st Avenue and 37th Street, is planning to build an eight-story co-op building on their parking lot as a way to generate income. &nbsp;It will be taller than any of the buildings in the area. &nbsp;Here is the item from the church bulletin of Feb. 6 (I'm omitting personal surnames):<br /><br />***<br />CO-OP PROPOSAL PASSED!<br /><br />At last Sunday's Congregational Meeting Henry K. moved, Richard K. seconded:<br /><br />&quot;That the congregation of Trinity Lutheran Church, located at 31-18 37th Street in Long Island City, N.Y. hereby approves the recommendation made by the Trinity Lutheran Church Council, on Tuesday 11 January 2005, to proceed with the development of the Trinity Lutheran Church parking lot, pursuant to the proposed development plans and specifications, as agreed to by the Trinity Lutheran Councial and Cedar Land Development Co., Woodmere, L.I., N.Y.&quot;<br /><br />The attendance sheet was signed by 43 members and the result of the paper ballots' [sic] was 37 yes, 4 no, one ballot was marked uncertain, and one person did not return a ballot. &nbsp;When the result was read, those attending stood and sang the Doxology, passed a motion for adjournment, and prayed the Lord's Prayer. &nbsp;Next Congregational Meeting will be after worship on Sunday 27 February when we will attend to the regular business of the congregation, including passing a 2005 Budget, and hearing a report on the next steps of the co-op development.<br /><br />Aspects of the development include a &nbsp;<span class="bbc_u">99-year lease</span> of our current parking lot for the construction of an eight-story co-op building which will have 30 co-ops, a parsonage, two medical suites, co-op parking and 14 parking spaces for worshipers at our church. &nbsp;We will make a minimum of $120,000 for the first year with regular increases following.<br />***<br /><br />My vote was one of the four &quot;no&quot; votes. &nbsp;I have already put this concern before the District 1 Community Board, and they have passed it on to the City Planning Dept. &nbsp;I am hoping we can force a hearing and at least get the building down to six stories, the top building height in this area.<br /><br />The attitude of the Council, I am told by a sympathetic council member who cast another of the &quot;no&quot; votes, was &quot;it's our land; we can do what we like with it.&quot; &nbsp;Need I say that that is not a Christian attitude?<br /><br />Any suggestions?
