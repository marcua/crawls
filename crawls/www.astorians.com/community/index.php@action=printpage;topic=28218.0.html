				Hello All: Just a warning about the company Moore and Gonzalez Real Estate Group, LLC and it&#039;s owner John Moore.&nbsp; My wife and I moved to Astoria (from Arkansas) at the beginning of June 2014.&nbsp; Prior to this we were put in contact with John Moore. He was the current tenant of 2354 Crescent St but he was moving out so he told us the apartment would be available in June. Since it was his apartment he told us he would not charge a realtor fee.&nbsp; I went through the process of filling out his company&#039;s apartment application and providing all of our documentation.&nbsp; John Moore told us that to secure the apartment for our June 1st arrival, we needed to send a deposit ($1250).&nbsp; He told us to make the check out to John Moore because his company would hold the deposit so that it would be easier to return to us if the owner did not approve our application.&nbsp; I sent the check, was not &quot;approved for the apartment by the landlord&quot;, and have still not seen that money (today is July 7th 2014). During the whole process John Moore offered a variety of excuses for lapses in communication and missed appointments: lost phone, ipad problems, son&#039;s baseball games, no car (&quot;his ride is late&quot;), &quot;train is late&quot;, &quot;check got lost in the mail&quot;, etc. During the process John Moore also suggested an apartment building at 2138 31st st.&nbsp; I read a post on Astorians from 2007 saying the apartment building at 2138 31st St never returned a former tenant&#039;s security deposit and that the management there was terrible.&nbsp; After doing some research, It appears this address is a former address of John Moore&#039;s.&nbsp; So I am wondering if he works with that building for some of his scams.&nbsp; When I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau I informed John Moore.&nbsp; He told me he would respond to the complaint &quot;without hesitation.&quot; He still has not responded.&nbsp; BBB has record of another complaint with a similar story and John Moore did not respond to that complaint either. Anyway, we are going to small claims court in January.&nbsp; Any information you have on this man or this company would be helpful.&nbsp; Thanks.
