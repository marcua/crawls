				Hello! I really need to find a stylist in Astoria that knows how to cut curly hair. I have very curly hair and I am looking to get blended layers! Does anyone have any recommendations? I am desperate!

				Years ago I searched around for a salon in Astoria that was good with curly hair, but was never able to find one. I don&#039;t know if going into Manhattan would be a hassle, but if it&#039;s not, I highly recommend Devachan in Soho. http://devachansalon.com/ (http://devachansalon.com/)<br /><br />It&#039;s a bit pricey, but well worth it. They are experts at cutting &amp; coloring curly hair.<br /><br />Hope that helps a bit.&nbsp; :-)

				Thank you for your reply. Actually, I&#039;ve been to Devachan two times and I didn&#039;t particularly like the cut and found it too expensive for not being fully satisfied. I thought about possibly going to someone else there but I&#039;m afraid to especially because the prices are crazy high. Have you by chance heard of the Annabelle Salon in NYC? I was wondering about the cuts there. <br /><br />

				Aww, sorry to hear you had 2 bad experiences at Devachan.&nbsp; :-( I&#039;ve only had 2 hairdressers there...my original hairdresser, who passed away last Fall, and then his replacement, who seems to be doing a good job so far. <br /><br />The only other &quot;curly&quot; salon that I know about is Ouidad, but a friend went years back and was extremely unhappy with her cut and style...said it came out too &quot;crunchy&quot; and 80s for her liking. I don&#039;t know anything about Annabelle, but I&#039;ll ask around to my curly friends and if I hear anything I&#039;ll come back and let you know.&nbsp; :-)

				I dont have curly hair but I have been going to SPACE&nbsp; (ditmars &amp; 31st, a few doors down from Pizza Palace) for nearly four years.&nbsp; Nikki is amazing and I cannot recommend her more highly. She is only there three days a week; so you have to book a bit in advance.&nbsp; All their senior stylists are amazing and they do a great job for a reasonable price.&nbsp;

				Thanks a lot Snoodette, I appreciate it. <br /><br />PDQ, I would be willing to try your stylist if she does work on curly hair. In my experience, a stylist can do great work with straight hair but not know what to do with curls. But maybe I will call that salon and ask them if anyone there has experience with curly hair.

				Janet at SPACE cut my hair about a month ago (mine&#039;s very curly) and I love what she did. I can&#039;t speak for everyone with curly hair, but as someone with fine-textured, thick (in density) spiral curls, it was a good experience. Even though I had her pretty much hack it all off, so I suppose that wasn&#039;t too hard. :)

				I have very thick, curly hair, and went to Nikki at SPAce for the first time about a month ago.&nbsp; I highly recommend her; it was a great experience.&nbsp; I got a MASSIVE amount of hair cut off to donate to Locks of Love--a full 12 inches.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t had short hair in over a decade, so this was a big deal for me.&nbsp; After the big pony-tail chop, Nikki took a few minutes to look at my hair and see where and how it curls before she shaped the layers.&nbsp; The result was way better than I expected; I get tons of compliments.&nbsp; I also found their prices pretty reasonable, considering the high quality of service.&nbsp;

				Wow, thank you all for your recommendations! They are very helpful! I think I will give SPACE a try. I have also tried to look it up online and apparently Lacey (don&#039;t know if she is still there) got good reviews for curly hair. So now I have to decide between Janet, Nikki, and Lacey, oy! At least I have some options!! Maybe I will call the salon and see who they recommend for curly hair but I have to say Nikki does sound great because I want layers and shorter layers too! <br /><br />For those who go to SPACE, do you know if they let you have consultations with a stylist before getting the cut. I was thinking of just showing the stylist a picture of what I would like and discussing it beforehand. <br /><br />I&#039;m excited but also apprehensive. It seems as though when a stylist is looking at my hair he/she looks scared and intimidated which leaves me feeling scared and intimidated. But I think I will give SPACE a try!

				I have curly hair and never had luck with anyone until I found Casey @ the Beehive Salon in Williamsburg, 4 years ago.&nbsp; She does my cut &amp; color and I haven&#039;t gone to anyone else since.&nbsp; She cuts the curls dry which really made the biggest difference.&nbsp; Then you can actually see what you are cutting vs. when curly hair is wet, as we all know isn&#039;t the same.<br /><br />Sadly, she moved back home but she will be at the Salon on weekends about every 6 - 8 weeks, which is perfect.&nbsp; She did recommend Elieen, should I need to get a cut in between her weekends.<br /><br />The salon is right off of the L @ Bedford and is totally reasonably priced.&nbsp; Everyone is great there.

				I have really curly hair &amp; have gone to Athena on 31st Avenue &amp; 33rd Street (not sure what the name of the actual salon is) for cuts both when my hair was very long &amp; then chin length.&nbsp; She is great &amp; the few friends I have recommended have also had positive experiences.&nbsp; $45 for a cut, totally beats the $114 I was paying at John Master&#039;s Organics.&nbsp; Cash only &amp; I think she only cuts on the weekends, though could be wrong about that - 718.545.2342

				Thanks a lot for more suggestions! I have heard of Casey before and because I didn&#039;t like the Devachan cuts I was hesitant to go to her. But I&#039;ve definitely heard that she&#039;s given good cuts. It&#039;s really great to know that I have a lot of options and I am going to check in with each salon just to get more info on curly cuts.
