				I am having a meeting tomorrow evening at 7PM at my apartment for anyone interested in working to help unseat Senator Onorato next year. There are already rumblings about a primary challenge and we want to help capitalize on this. Anyone interesting in working towards this goal please come by tomorrow, 12/6 at 7PM for a small informal planning session to figure out next steps.<br /><br />Please PM or email (eric dot brasure at gmail dot com) me if you want to attend and I will give you location information.<br /><br />I hope to see many of you!<br />

				Thanks for hosting and organizing something like this. See you tomorrow!<br /><br />Folks, we need to move on the momentum now! Astorians cannot stand idly by and be represented by someone who is anti-gay.

The bar has moved and it will continue to move until it reaches full equality. So, yeah, someone who says I may not marry is &quot;anti&quot; me.

				Hope the meeting went well.<br />Onorato has a mixed record - he&#039;s voted for transgender protections and for hate crimes, as well as for SONDA, but his unwillingness to vote for marriage equality is very troubling to me.&nbsp; I&#039;d have a very hard time voting for anyone for State Legislature who was against marriage equality.
