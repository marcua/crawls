				I&#039;ve been tasked to find the number of some dude in South Africa by going through &quot;international directory inquiries&quot; I know there is a number for that but I can&#039;t find it. Does anyone know the international equivilant of 411? I know one of you has to know.<br />Before someone says google it; i tried it three different ways with nothing that helped me.

				Glad it helped!<br /><br />Otherwise, I&#039;ve called directory assistance in other countries before from the US, and I think I&#039;ve also used US operators to look for numbers in other countries (France and Australia that I remember).&nbsp; It&#039;s been a long time since I&#039;ve done it - try dialling 00?

				I think i just left a mark on my face where I slapped myself in a d&#039;oh! moment.<br /><br />Ok it&#039;s as easy as dialing 0 and telling them you need an international operator who then gets you directory assistance. I even heard the part where she called Cape Town directory inquiries. <br />I feel stupid.<br />But if anyone needs to do this in the future now you know!<br />I wonder if I saw your post first and dialed 00 if i would have gone straight to an international operator?<br /><br />so i searched online. called 411 who told me to contact my own long distance provider which necessitated finding out who they were and then looking for info on them online until i finally just dialed 0 and worked it old school. took 10 tranfers but i got it. I wonder if the number i remember using in the past was actually 0. that would make me feel even MORE retarded.<br /><br />btw lanseaux my coworker from south africa loves that link. she&#039;s bookmarking it.
