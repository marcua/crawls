				My friend is getting married in Ocean Beach, Fire Island on August 9th. I would like to rent a house from August 8-10, 2008 but I am having a hard time finding weekend-only rentals. Most rentals on Craigslist are for weeks or 1/4 and 1/2 weekend shares. Since I only need one weekend, this type of share doesn&#039;t make a lot of sense for me. Some of the hotels I have found require a 3-night minimum. I wasn&#039;t planning on taking any days off from work, so this 3-night minimum doesn&#039;t work for me either. There are currently 6 of us planning on renting and going to the wedding together. <br /><br />Does anyone have any suggestions on websites that list rentals by the weekend? Or do you know someone that has a house for rent for the summer? As I have discovered, even though it is January it is already late in the Fire Island rental race. <br /><br />As I mentioned, the wedding is in Ocean Beach so I would prefer to rent there is possible.<br /><br />Thanks for your help!<br />

				The weekend is when most of the rental income is being spent.&nbsp; If you do manage to find a place that only rents over the weekend without requiring a midweek rental, then you&#039;ll find the savings to be appallingly small.&nbsp; They do exist I believe, but it just ain&#039;t worth it.&nbsp; On top of that, that weekend is probably the absolute peak of the season, so landlords are not going to be anxious to negotiate on anything.&nbsp; So instead on trying to find a weekend only house, pick the week long rental that is best for you and just eat the rest of the week.<br /><br />I know that you are not looking to take any time off from work, but I will give friendly advice to do so if you are having to get a week-long rental.&nbsp; Fire Island during the week is a wonderful place.&nbsp; Even if you cannot, your friends can use the place during the week.<br /><br />You do still have time however, things really don&#039;t get locked down until march or so, especially in Ocean Beach, as it is so large.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t limit myself to just Ocean Beach however.&nbsp; The other towns of Ocean Bay Park and Seaview are easy walks and the western part of the island is an easy water taxi ride away (Robbins Rest, Fair Harbor, Saltaire, Kismet), as well is the more alternative lifestyle orientated parts of Cherry Grove and the Pines.&nbsp; Ocean Beach is the land of no (ever when going to the beach!) and I personally find the other parts of the island more enjoyable (though Oceans Beach&#039;s baywalk is positively Rockwellesque at times!)<br />
