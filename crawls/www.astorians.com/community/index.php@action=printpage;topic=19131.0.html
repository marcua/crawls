				This morning I wanted to use the ATM at the Chase Bank at 30th Avenue and 31st street but there was a homeless person inside the lobby with the ATM&#039;s. Although I could have entered, it made me uncomfortable enough to avoid visiting the bank until later in the day.<br /><br />It seems people are getting more desperate these days... even going up right into the bank and waiting for someone to pass by.

				I&#039;ve encountered the homeless guy at that ATM about half the time I use that ATM. If the bank isn&#039;t willing to force the guy out for trespassing, then there&#039;s really nothing you can do about it.

				This has also happened to me, but at the sketchy location of the nearest HSBC in LIC (43rd Ave and 23rd St) I&#039;m sorry, if there is a person that makes me uncomfortable in the vestibule, I will take my business elsewhere, even if it requires me to pay a fee. And if that means they &quot;won&quot; I don&#039;t care. I&#039;m a small girl, and follow &quot;safety first&quot; over convenience.

				That particular Chase location is awful.&nbsp; Too many times the ATMs have been out of order, last summer the AC in the vestibule leaked water all over the floor and, of course, a homeless guy sometimes chills out in there.

				If it&#039;s during the bank&#039;s business hours, I go inside instead of the outer vestibule.&nbsp; There are a couple atms in there and it seems a little more safer.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to complain to the Chase branch about these problems.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t like one of my last experiences visiting while the homeless guy was in the atm vestibule.&nbsp; It&#039;s a private business, we are paying customers and Chase should have the responsibility of managing the bank branch in a professional and secure manner.

				The homeless guy has been there for ages. That ATM is the worst -- the lines are always long and the vestibule smells awful (probably at least in part from the homeless guy). If the bank is open, I also go inside. <br /><br />Unless I&#039;m heading to or from the train, I try to avoid it and head to the Chase on Steinway or Broadway &amp; 33rd instead.

				I called the branch and complained.&nbsp; They said how they receive complaints about the homeless guy everyday and they are trying to fix the situation.&nbsp; They said how they had a security guard come in before but that it was temporary.&nbsp; <br /><br />I honestly don&#039;t know what they really will do to solve this situation, but I think if more people call and complain, they hopefully will put a security guard there.<br /><br />Chase Bank and ATMâ€Ž<br />31-05 30th Ave<br />Long Island City, NY 11102<br />(718) 204-7976<br /><br />

				That is the Chase I usually go to as well.&nbsp; The ATM vestibule is dirty, out of order machines, etc all the time.&nbsp; I ignore that homeless man....if he is in fact homeless.&nbsp; I&#039;ve worked at 2 banks in my life and it is the duty of the employees to take care of the matter.&nbsp; If they are too cheap to employ a security guard (and we all know Chase Manhattan can afford the extra salary), then a mgr either has to call the police to escort the man out or gather some courage and tell him he has to leave and threaten to call the police if he doesn&#039;t comply.&nbsp; It really is bad for business. <br /><br />I wonder if I can write corporate and tell them about the problem....?

				You are just wasting your time if you decide to write to the suits of Chase Bank, don&#039;t even bother.<br />They live in a different world then you and I. <br /><br />This guy isn&#039;t probably homeless since he has been around there for a long time. <br />People give him change/money out of fear or just pity, that is why he is still there.<br />Perhaps if people ignored him and stopped giving him money then maybe he would go somewhere<br />else to do his business.

				I used to give that guy some money from time to time, but once when I didn&#039;t give him anything, I heard him mutter &quot;cheap mother ...... &quot; under his breath. Haven&#039;t given him a dime since.
