				I had a horrible experience at Igloo this evening.&nbsp; I walked in alone and asked if I could sit at a booth, although knowing that it seats 4 people.&nbsp; I then asked if I could sit at another larger table off in the back that also sat 4.&nbsp; I asked 3 times, &quot;are you sure?&quot; the waitress said, &quot;yes.&quot;&nbsp; I then sat down, settled in, opened my laptop, ordered and began eating.&nbsp; While I was in the middle of eating the owner showed up and came over to my table, she asked me if I would move.&nbsp; I said, &quot;In the middle of my meal you want me to move? &quot; She told me I was disrespectful to be sitting at such a large table, all spread out.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t believe it.&nbsp; She then told me not to come back because I wouldn&#039;t move.<br /><br />Thoughts?

				No this definitely was the owner. I&#039;ve been in there a bunch of times and know for sure.&nbsp; To make matters worse....the waitstaff, my waiter and the girl who seated me, lied to the owner saying that I told them I was expecting more friends to join me.&nbsp; They just wanted to cover their butts. So I told the owner I shouldn&#039;t have to pay for my meal with this kind of treatment. She said, &quot;Why? You ate.&quot; I feel that bad treatment is pretty rampant in Astoria. You think?

				Personally, I don&#039;t suffer this type of crap quietly.<br /><br />If it had happened to me, I would write them the following letter and send it certified, return receipt requested:<br /><br />Igloo Ice Cream Cafe<br />2226 31st Street<br />Astoria, NY 11105-2714<br /><br />March 23, 2007<br /><br />Dear Owner,<br />As a result of what happened to me, <em>(state it in minute in detail)</em>, I have decided to withhold doing business at your establishment for a period of one year and I have posted the circumstances of this on the internet at http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=5669.0;topicseen, where there are currently in excess of 1,800 local Astoria residents registered who will be reading and participating with me in a discussion of this incident<br /><br />I realize that the loss of my business will not cause you any monetary harm, but please be mindful that if the whole community is treated as I was, then there will be many others who will no longer avail themselves of your place of business, and that that <em>will</em> have an adverse monetary effect on your business.<br /><br />Customers deserve to be treated fairly and with respect at all times. There are no excuses for ever disrespecting a customer. After all, without customers, you have no business.<br /><br />Respectfully,

				Mac, you always have such nice letters.&nbsp; Did you at all work for the Better Business Bureau?&nbsp; Or does it come naturally?<br /><br />Anyways, I really agree with Mac about sending the letter.&nbsp; I have been iffy about going back to Igloo myself.&nbsp; If I do go, I do not sit in the back because they tend to forget about me.&nbsp; I have usually felt that the service was quite slow.

				I have had great experiences at most restaurants and certainly don&#039;t feel like I could generalize Astoria/LIC/Ditmars over the poor experiences at one or two. However, there are certain establishments that I have learned NOT to go to if I am in a rush, or if I have to make a movie or something. I don&#039;t want to list them here because they are good places sjust with slow service. <br /><br />The experience at Igloo is unforgiveable. Frankly, if you were by yourself and only 4 seating was available, tough, they should have seated you with a smile. Since you were considerate enough to ask if it was okay (which really isn&#039;t your responsibility) the response was terrible. I would definitely send that letter.

				Wow. That&#039;s awful. I just ate there for the first time two weeks ago - my boyfriend and I<br />took his two little ones for late afternoon snack. We had a nice waiter who seated us in the<br />back area since &nbsp;the front was crowded. I have to say it was fine - we liked what we had,<br />the kids - most importantly - were happy with their smoothies, etc.<br /><br />But that really is a type of rudness I&#039;ve never experienced - and I could tell you some great<br />stories.<br /><br />Definitely send the letter - so few people take that extra step these days that it&#039;ll really light<br />a fire under their asses!<br /><br />

				What time did this happen? I got takeout there last night at around the time you posted this, and it was EMPTY!! I have only gotten takeout, and even then, they can be slow. As for service in Astoria in general, I have lived here for over 2 years but lived in queens all my life. I will say that restaurants serving a &quot;certain country&#039;s&quot; cuisine, which is very well represented in the area, tend to be much friendlier to &quot;their own kind&quot; then outsiders. I know this may stir things up a bit, but that has been my experience.

If I was seated, had my food served, was already eating . . . I couldn&#039;t care who walked in and wanted to be seated. It was so disrespectful/impolite/wrong/ignorant to be asked to relinquish the seat in the middle of a meal! I never had an experience like that in my life, and I cannot fathom the degree of humiliation associated with it. You just don&#039;t do anything like that in a service industry. But, if you want to take the path of your question, and assume that a large crowd of people walked through the door and asked to be seated, management could have whipped out a couple of small trays of appetizers, or just damn cookies, and served them while they waited!

				Or they could have offered you a free meal or dessert if you would be so kind as to move. But it sounds like the place was empty but the owner was sticking to their rules and being a jerk.&nbsp; The waitress should have known the owners rules and jerk attitude and helped you avoid the whole situation in the first place.

				I think poor service stays in one&#039;s memory far longer than poor food. With food, you can think maybe you just ordered the wrong thing or there was a new cook or something along those lines, and will give the establishment another try. Poor service is harder to forgive and forget, especially in a small, local establishment where the owner is &quot;hands on.&quot; It&#039;s unacceptable.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never tried Igloo, but am always looking out for local places to check out. Based on OP&#039;s post, though, I won&#039;t bother. I hope OP sends the [excellently drafted] letter and I hope they check out the link and see just how their business truly CAN be adversely affected by the bad experience of one customer.

				In a place like that, table moving is just part of the business.&nbsp; That being said, it sounds like the restaurant handled it poorly, and if the table wasn&#039;t needed, then it sounds like they needlessly created a confrontation.<br /><br />As a waiter, over the years, I&#039;ve asked dozens of tables to move.&nbsp; If a party wants a table that is bigger then it needs, I&#039;ll still seat them if I can manage it, but making it clear that I might have to ask them to move.&nbsp; In other times, when a two top is in the middle of tables I want to put together for a bigger party, then I&#039;ll ask and grease the wheels with a drink.&nbsp; &nbsp;Usually they&#039;ll pre-empt me and volunteer to move.&nbsp; If you establish a good rapport with a table, its never really a problem.

				In December of 2003...like 2 or 3 days before Christmas I was eating...a San Fransican Wrap??? Anyway....I bit into an olive...with a pit in it...I sheered off the side of a molar with a loud crack. They blinked and looked at me like.....gee.....are you sure it was the olive???? Are you going to leave now? Maybe we wrap it to go.<br /><br />I was so incensed, not a word of appology or even accepting any blame. Why I didn&#039;t sue them???? I guess I was in shock and they hoped that I would &quot;just go away&quot;...and I did...stupid me...not a fav&#039; of mine anymore.<br /><br />As far as being treated well ...or AS well by Spiro, Billy and Nick in some of the local eateries as their fellow countrymen.....search out the thread&nbsp; somewhere hereabouts: &quot;Worst Diner in Astoria&quot;....you&#039;ll see many such stories.

				I agree that logically we can&#039;t decide on never going to a place based on one person&#039;s experience, but to not post just because...that doesn&#039;t make sense either. Someone had posted about a terrible experience at Neptunes, and it was interesting to hear. Didn&#039;t change my opinion of Neptunes though.<br /><br />The responses I think most people gave the critic were on the assumptions that the allegations were true.That is all we can do on a board, post advice if it was true. I like to think it isn&#039;t indicative a flock following one critique. <br /><br />That aside, I think it is the accumulation of opinions and evidence that helps to form an opinion. Omitting a bad experience from the board is inappropriate. And I think most were commiserating rather than taking a stand against Igloo.

Why would someone say malicious things without it being an act of revenge? Why would someone describe, in detail, a personal humiliation unless there was truth?<br /><br />I believe what nicsop said happened to her. And I believe it because, as a single female, I am acutely aware of how many restaurants treat single women who request seating at larger tables, even during slow hours. BTDT. Local eatery establishments are historically notorious for this behavior. <br /><br />I am not climbing on any bandwagon, but I fully intend to support anyone who has ever experienced this type of really crappy experience. I am not asking anyone else to do the same.

I can attest to it. I had my corporate American Express card, and still had trouble making reservations for *one* at some of the finest restaurants around the world. Even worse, was going to a local establishment, alone, and asking to be seated at a table THAT WAS <span class="bbc_u">NOT</span> FOR ONE. I hate those little 2&#039; X 2&#039; tables. I always had a briefcase, a laptop, a purse, a stack of folders and G-d knows what else. I needed a place to secure my belongings that was not the floor. I cannot tell you how often I would *end up* going to a drive-thru to pick-up some fast-food junk just to get a meal to take back to my hotel/motel room. Room service quality leaves a good deal to be desired!<br /><br />Many times, right here in Astoria, I have been refused a table for myself . . . unless I made it very clear that I was early and expecting company. I became immune to the humiliation of the routine, but I never got used to it happening.<br /><br />So, the answer to your question, &quot;Are you suggesting that there is a bias in the restaurant industry against single women?&quot; is a resounding YES! Worldwide? YES! They never seem to ask a man, &quot;are you expecting company?&quot; they just seat them.

				I don&#039;t doubt the motivation behind the poster defending Igloo, nor do I think if any of us were store owners that we would do anything different.<br /><br />The more interesting topic is that of single female customers. I enjoy eating alone, going out to a restaurant with a book, sitting and enjoying my meal. I don&#039;t know if I am oblivious to it, but it never even crossed my mind that I was treated differently as a single woman. But I am also hesitant, as we all should be, to make broad generalizations about our own experiences, as that is all we have, and there are other biases as well. For example, I have noticed waiters and waitresses at a cafe get &quot;funny&quot; if you walk in with a laptop and a lot of papers....it means to them that their table will not get turned over as fast, and that I can understand from a financial perspective. <br /><br />There are also so many other factors that play into seating: age, the establishment, race, ethnicity, attractiveness, etc....any one of these factors may have an impact on seating...I would be curious if the originator of this post can put up a poll to get a feel for the impact of gender on seating/attitude with seating. Whether I agree with NYCMacuser or not, I&#039;m going to be more aware of seating attitudes.

				Picture this:<br /><br />A lone diner goes into a local restaurant to grab a bite to eat. Spotting an empty booth up front, she asks the waitress if it would be alright to take it even though she knows it seats 4 people. Though it’s not particularly busy at the time, the waitress declines and politely suggests a smaller table given that it’s the evening, primetime, when many people eat their dinner and the booth may be needed to accommodate a larger party. <br /><br />Undeterred, the lone diner scans the restaurant and spies a large, empty 4-person table in the back and asks if she could have that one. The waitress, confronted by the customer’s insistence, weighs the options: the day, the time, number of tables available, etc. and against her better judgement decides to give in to avoid a scene.<br /><br />The diner, still undeterred and now sensing the waitress’s hesitation, suspects that it is still not alright to occupy such a large table, asks the waitress not once, but three more times until she receives the answer she wants. Feeling a little less guilty, she takes her seat and spreads out…<br /><br />Do I need to go on?<br /><br />I took liberties filling in the blanks and maybe I missed something but to me the question was asked and answered – and the reply was ignored.<br /><br />Can I suggest something:<br />&nbsp;<br />1. When dining out, it’s usually never OK for one person to sit at a 4-person table, especially during busy hours. <br /><br />2. In my experience, if you have to ask for something three times the answer is usually no -- but you knew this already, otherwise you wouldn’t have asked three times in the first place.<br /><br />3. People are rude. Get used to it. When did compensation become compulsory for being shabby treatment? Does poor service at a department store entitle someone to walk out with the merchandise as compensation for their feelings being hurt? <br /><br />4. Bad service -- in my book it means pack it in, pay up, move on. <br /><br />5. Before you ask for sympathy make sure you’ve examined your own behavior in any given situation.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Let me just jump on the bandwagon here for a second. I am new to this board. Hi all! Sorry that this is the way I am introducing myself but I&#039;ve been reading this thread for the past few days and I am getting a little annoyed for the simple fact that once the person was seated she was asked in the middle of her meal to move. That is unacceptable. I work in a busy place in Manhattan and would never ask someone to move in the middle of their meal. We also have booths and don&#039;t allow single person seating. However if I saw someone sitting by themselves I would never have the audacity to embarass this person and ask them to move. At this point she was at the table already, let it go, let her finish her meal. If there was a problem with her behavior she should have been spoken to on the way out. This restaurant is obviously way to busy to mind there manners.

Does poor service at a department store entitle someone to walk out with the merchandise as compensation for their feelings being hurt? <br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If I can just add my few cents here . . . as both an avid consumer and a small business owner I just can&#039;t contain myself.<br /><br />To #1 - as a consumer it is NOT your responsibility to figure out what is or is not convenient for the business - if you want to sit at a large table then ask - it&#039;s their business - only they really know how they want to run things and it&#039;s entirely up to them.&nbsp; <br /><br />To #2 - if you ask and they say no then the answer is no - as a business owner I&#039;m very aware of the technique known as &quot;ask a million times and maybe the answer will change&quot; - it WON&#039;T, and it&#039;s annoying as all hell when you&#039;re asked over and over again.<br /><br />To #3 - I absolutely refuse to accept this as a social &quot;truth&quot;.&nbsp; Accepting when people are rude perpetuates the problem and I, for one, am sick of it - like the cab driver last night who complained incessantly as to how much money he was going to lose by driving ALL the way to Astoria - as if I was going to change my mind if he complained enough to me.&nbsp; I don&#039;t ever want to get used to people being rude and I think it&#039;s our social responsibility - particularly in a business situation - to let the people around us know when they are being rude and how that affects us.&nbsp; Rudeness snowballs, by accepting it I think we&#039;re condoning it and I won&#039;t condone rudeness.<br /><br />To #3a - giving discounts/freebies to dissatisfied customers only hurts when it&#039;s been manipulated out of you.&nbsp; The fact is that businesses exist because of the continued patronage of customers - there is a very real threat that pissing off a customer will have a negative impact on your bottom line.&nbsp; They told her it was OK to sit there - then they asked her to move - this is an inconvenience and a free soda or dessert isn&#039;t going to gouge the cash drawer but it might maintain goodwill.&nbsp; It&#039;s often the effort that counts more than the freebie.<br /><br />OK - I admit, much more than a few cents.&nbsp;

				Hello everyone. I don&#039;t post on forums very often, but i would like to contribute my opinion.<br /><br />I&#039;ve noticed a couple of things on this discussion:<br />1) Most people are automatically assuming that nicsop&#039;s post is based 100% on truth, something that no one here can know for sure, and to what extent.<br />2) It seems to me that it is quite comical how seriously this &quot;issue&quot; is being taken. So you had a &quot;bad&quot; experience at a restaurant sweety, from now on eat somewhere else, its not that big of a deal. There are more important issues in world than YOU.<br /><br />The reason I say this is because I find it hard to believe that this story has not been embellished just a little bit to suit ones needs.<br />I have been eating at Igloo with my coworkers at least once week for many years which at least entitles me to an opinion here.&nbsp; In my honest experience there has rarely ever been a major problem, that at least could not be solved by being nice about it.&nbsp; Of course, I don&#039;t walk in there like I own the place and demand things that would not be accommodating to other patrons.<br />I challenge anyone to go into any&nbsp; busy restaurant and demand a booth or large table for one person, I&#039;d love to hear what they tell you. In my book that person would have to be obnoxious, oblivious, and worst of all disrespectful to other customers as well as the establishment. If I walked in there with a party of 3 like I usually do, and they told me that I had to wait for a table, while booths are being used up by single persons, I would think that the management is not doing a good job of allocating seats and that the person sitting there is very obnoxious.<br /><br />Maybe someone should open a restaurant just for nicsop where she doesn&#039;t have to pay either!<br />Any takers?<br /><br />

				In her first post, the OP mentioned using her laptop at the table.&nbsp; Not that I&#039;ve ever been to Igloo so I can&#039;t comment personally on the service, but I wonder whether it was the implication of the laptop use that she was going to be occupying the large table for a while that turned out to be the problem, not just eating a meal then leaving.

				Assuming what nicsop said was true, they shouldn&#039;t have served her before asking her to leave the table. If they knew it would be a problem for her to sit there, the owner or whoever should&#039;ve come out before the food was served. But I also agree with mcw about the laptop observation. I have to say I&#039;ve never seen anyone use a laptop in there, and I imagine the idea of a lone person with a laptop taking up a 4-person table indefinitely would scare someone trying to run a restaurant. <br /><br />That said, this story isn&#039;t going to make me not go to Igloo anymore, since I&#039;ve gone there several times without a problem. I&#039;ve always found the place to be pleasant and friendly. It&#039;s not the best food in the neighborhood, but it&#039;s a good standby for a variety of decent, inexpensive food.

				Sure essen, you&#039;re absolutely right, assuming that is what took place. But that is what doesn&#039;t make sense to me. Why would they do that? I willing to give Igloo the benefit of the doubt, that they know how to treat their customers a little better since they are usually busy and have been around for a while. Nice to see some more logical input.&nbsp; :-)

				Ok, after basically stating my thoughts and disappearing due to 1. busyness 2. perhaps some irresponsibility in following my post 3. trying to move on.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t want to get all worked up for days about this experience, nor did I want to beat a dead horse.&nbsp; I stated what happened. It was MY side of the story.&nbsp; What I posted was the best truth I know because it was my experience and I mentioned nothing of the food. In fact, I enjoyed my wrap and awesome waffle fries until I was asked to move with fork in mouth.&nbsp; <br /><br />For the record, I too have worked in the food industry as both a hostess and a server.&nbsp; I know when it&#039;s appropriate to seat a single person at a small 2 topper vs. a larger table based on time of day, busyness etc.&nbsp; Should I have assumed that I was required to to sit at a small table, PERHAPS.&nbsp; But it was not crowded the entire back was empty, and a few tables in front also.&nbsp; I asked as a courtesy not becaus I had to get my way! I also asked several times because the &quot;hostess&quot; didn&#039;t speak very good English, or so it appeared that she didn&#039;t quite understand my request.&nbsp; I also didn&#039;t walk in with laptop in hand, nor did I originally plan to use my laptop. It was impromptu.&nbsp; I just wanted some good food, a little relaxation and time to breathe after a &quot;blek&quot; day.<br /><br />My point and point ONLY. As a costomer I thought it rude that I be asked to move after service commenced, food delivered, food 1/2 eaten and great comments on my beautiful laptop from the waiter.&nbsp; &nbsp;The waiter had the chance to tell me that laptop use was not allowed. He had the chance before I ordered to tell me that I needed to move to a smaller table.&nbsp; The owner was not present at this time.&nbsp; <br /><br />What it boils down to. There clearly is not a strong protocol as to how Igloo is run.&nbsp; Mother Igloo runs the joint, as her son also did not tell me to move and he was there the whole time.&nbsp; Now everyone......<br /><br />let&#039;s move on. It was merely my account of my own experience.&nbsp; Did I carry on with the owner, did I get upset with her? Of course I did. I wanted service and I didn&#039;t get it!

				i was just sent this thread by someone who told me about the terrible experience at igloo you had. You think that&#039;s bad? Last week, I went for breakfast with 2 friends. We ordered and everything was fine. In the middle of the meal I went to the mens room, and as I was closing the door, one of the waiters burst in and dragged me out. He said &quot;Bathroom for customer only&quot;. I was beside myself. I said &quot;I am a customer I&#039;m at that table&quot; and pointed to my friends. He went over, and CLEARED THE TABLE onto the ground! Then a couple of other employees came and grabbed my friends and I and THREW US OUT. They were like savages, grabbing our hair and pulling us along the floor towards the door. The whole time they were swearing at us, calling us nasty names. The only thing I could get out of one of them was &quot;You complain about food, you complain about service, you get the f out!&quot; One guy grabbed my friends bag (she didn&#039;t have time to grab it as she was being thrown out) and emptied it out on the street. She kneeled down on the sidewalk to pick up her belongings and one of the waiters put his foot on her shoulder and kicked her on her back!&nbsp; Other customers seemed to enjoy it or think it was a show or skit or something, as they were all laughing and pointing and taking pictures with their phones.&nbsp; it was like a bad dream. Well I called the 114 and we told them the story. They went into the restaurant and told us to stay outside. I looked thru the window as the owner hugged them and another guy gave them bags of food. Finally they came back out and told us to leave the area or we&#039;d be arrested. Then the owner came out and I asked her &quot;Why did your guys throw us out?&quot; One of the officers said &quot;DON&quot;T ANSWER THAT QUESTION&quot; and the woman said &quot;I have no comment&quot;. The other cop took out his stick and pushed it into my chest and said &quot;Last warning.&quot; We got the message and left. From now on we&#039;re going to Mikes or Last Stop. Did anything like this ever happen to anyone on this list?

				<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; First of all, I don&#039;t know about all of you, but when I dine alone I would never expect to be seated at a larger table. I understand that a waitress told you it was fine, but if the <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>owner</em> asked you politely to move, what is the problem? Why raise such a stink? Just get over it. What if a larger party walked in and needed a place to sit? It&#039;s not a large<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;cafe, and the back room is not always open. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Just came across this thread so apologize in advance for the late posting.<br /><br />My partner and I banned Igloo about a year ago.&nbsp; Even though we ate there a couple of times a week the following was inexcusable so I can&#039;t justify supporting this establishment&nbsp; The final straw was that we each ordered a chicken salad and the chicken came out grossly undercooked.&nbsp; He had already poured ranch dressing on his part but we still sent them back.&nbsp; They brought us &quot;brand new salads&quot; yet there was a huge white stain on the chicken from where they threw it (dressing and all) back in the deep fryer.&nbsp; When we asked the waiter about this he insisted that they had made completely new salads and he had personally witnessed this.&nbsp; We then called the manager over and he insisted that this was the case as well.&nbsp; The ironic thing is that the chicken still wasn&#039;t fully cooked.&nbsp; We simply asked for our check for the smoothies and they tried to make us pay for the salads that we hadn&#039;t even taken a bite of. After a heated argument (and those who know me that I&#039;m calm 99.9% of the time until you push me to the limit) we gave them the money for the smoothies and left.&nbsp; To this day when I walk by if the manager is outside smoking he gives me dirty looks.<br /><br />I&#039;m glad to see that other people are starting to ban this place as well.&nbsp; It&#039;s a shame though because I really enjoyed going there but refuse to be treated this way when there are so many better dining options around Ditmars.

				I have to say I&#039;m really surprised to hear of the extent of some of these negative experiences at Igloo. I don&#039;t doubt anyone&#039;s account, as I wasn&#039;t there. <br /><br />But I&#039;ll say I have literally been to Igloo hundreds of times in the last four years. The first month we moved here, we went almost every day because our kitchen was too full with boxes. The people there have always been really nice and professional, and the food is great. Sometimes there is a big waiter/waitress turnover, but I&#039;ve never had a bad experience with any of them. I almost always go in with one other person (my husband) at all various hours, and probably sit at a booth half the time just the two of us. No one has ever said that was a problem. I have talked w/the owner/wife many times, but never the owner/husband (he does seem kind of stand-offish to me). I have never witnessed any inappropriate incidents between the staff and patrons.<br /><br />Just wanted to give another point of view for those who haven&#039;t been there before.
