				I was mugged about an hour ago three doors from my house on Crescent between Ditmars and 23rd. It was two men in their late 20s or early 30s, white, who came up on me and my boyfriend from behind. They took my wallet and money from his. <br /><br />I don&#039;t really know what I hope to accomplish by posting this, other than to warn people that these things do happen in safe neighborhoods and to always watch who is behind you.<br /><br />I am a wreck right now and my boyfriend is outside waiting for the police to finish writing the report. <br /><br />I want to thank all of the neighbors who came outside when they heard me screaming.

				Terribly sorry to hear about this. So scary. You can never be sure about the presence of a weapon....it is usually the safest course to be cooperative. A friend of mine and his gf were jumped near Ditmars and 26th a year or two back and when his instinct was to fight back, he got a horrible pistol-whipping. Money can be replaced, your life cannot...I am so glad you both were not injured.

				Thanks everyone for all the well wishes. We&#039;re both okay. My cards are cancelled and they didn&#039;t actually get my bag, I just gave them my wallet, so I still have my keys, phone and ID, which life would be a lot harder without.<br /><br />It&#039;s hard not to think of all the things that I could have done better or differently to avoid the situation. I know that the fact that it was late, that we had both had a few drinks (but if you know me, you know my tolerance! ha ha!) and that we were having a really good conversation made us less observant than I usually am. The walk we were making last night is one I&#039;ve made alone many times. When I would make the walk alone, I was always a lot more careful and suspicious of others. Being with someone made me feel like I was safe. I guess what I&#039;ve learned from this is that just because you are with someone, you aren&#039;t automatically safe.<br /><br />Also, I need to find a way to thank the two gentlemen who came out of their homes at near 2 am to see what was going on. It&#039;s people who do things like that that keep Astoria from being the kind of place where these things happen regularly. They came outside and scared them away before anything bad could have happened and stayed with us until the police got there. While getting mugged will make me a little more wary around the hood, overall the experience has shown me why I love this neighborhood. When I was in trouble, my neighbors came out to protect me and my police officers responded quickly and did everything they could to help me. Beyond that, I have a group of people here offering their support. It really means a lot to me that this is the kind of community I live in. I&#039;m really proud to be an Astorian.

				Thank goodness you both are alright! As I was reading through this thread I thought how awful, but atleast they didn&#039;t hurt you or take your keys or force you to let them into to your home. <br />I&#039;m glad you have caring neighbors who got involved when something bad was happening outside. Yes, that&#039;s what makes Astoria a special place to live, however, I do think things are slowly getting a little worse each year around here. My neighbor got his car window smashed in in broad daylight this weekend, and he was parked next to his house! Nobody heard a thing! We are one block away from the park, so we get a lot of transient types coming through now-even though the pool isn&#039;t even open yet.<br />Be careful out there everyone-it&#039;s going to be a long summer!

				Wow, I&#039;m so sorry, but so glad you guys are ok. Terrible though - makes you feel so <br />vulnerable and violated!<br /><br />This gives me something to think about. My BF and I always walk home around midnight <br />from Brick on 31st Ave. to my building at 29th St. &amp; 30th Rd. We rarely see anyone but we&#039;ll<br />definitely be more aware now. <br /><br />And if that had happened to us and my BF took a swing at one of them, I would be furious. <br />You don&#039;t know if those two were alone or if others were with them nearby. Money and stuff<br />can be replaced, cards cancelled etc. You two did exactly the right thing!<br /><br />Hopefully they&#039;ll be caught or at least find out that they&#039;re the hot topic on this site!<br /><br />Be well.

				Unfortunately, in the dark and with how quickly they came up on us, neither one of us could give a good enough description to merit a trip to the sketch artist.<br /><br />Here is what I do remember--<br /><br />Both were white guys in their late 20s. The one who grabbed me was 5&#039;11&quot; and about 160-170 with short dark hair. The guy who grabbed Tim was 6&#039;2&quot; and of a similar build to the other guy--skinny, but muscular. He had a slightly darker complexion and could have been part hispanic and was wearing a baseball hat. Both guys were wearing light t-shirts and dark pants.<br /><br />I know it&#039;s not very helpful. I wish I had seen more.

				My previous employer brought in an NYPD officer to talk to us about avoiding and dealing with attacks.

				Para,<br /><br />Like everyone else, you and Tim have my sympathies and support and if you need anything - a relaxing doggie playdate? - let me know. <br /><br />I strongly object to the post criticizing Tim for not being &quot;the hero type.&quot; Rather than offer a long diatribe against the &quot;hero&quot; mentality and how little it may actually accomplish in the service of the common good, let me say that it is widely documented in analyses of actual data on street robbery that physically resisting a street robber significantly increases the likelihood that the victim will be injured. Screaming and yelling, however, are always great strategies, even the tried and true yelling &quot;fire&quot; can interrupt the plans of even the sloppiest street robber.<br /><br />I am very glad to hear you were not physically injured, but I well remember the terrible feeling of violation after being mugged so go easy on yourself! <br /><br />I am happy to see that people who think in &quot;heroic&quot; terms are the minority in our neighborhood.<br /><br />Michelle

				One more thing... in the movement for restorative justice many crime victim services have been implemented around the country, and New York is no exception; in fact, it may have been a leader. <br /><br />I am unclear as to whether crime victim compensation is intended only for people injured during a crime (or for specific populations like children and elderly, regardless of injury), but everyone should know about the NYS Crime Victims Board:<br /><br />http://www.cvb.state.ny.us/home.aspx<br /><br />They provide compensation (up to $500 for essential personal property and up to $100 cash) for innocent crime victims in NYS.<br />

				If you&#039;re not well trained and practiced in self-defense, trying to fight a mugger will almost certainly make things worse. The mugger just wants your money, and you&#039;re trying to make him <em>angry</em>?? <br /><br />If you have any options at all aside from giving them the money, and if you&#039;re wearing good shoes, the best bet is to run like hell toward a public place!<br /><br />Of course, if you&#039;re getting beat up, or it&#039;s a rape attempt, then yeah, fight back!

				I think it would help if we were all more aware as we walked, especially as we go from the avenues to our side streets. If the ladies are nervous (I&#039;ve told this to my girlfriend) try to keep near groups, on the trains, the streets, etc... ,mix in a bit.

				Hey &quot;ladies&quot; just so we are all &quot;more aware:&quot; men are more likely to both commit and be the victims of the violent crime of robbery. And women are more likely to be victimized violently (including murdered and raped) by someone they know than by a stranger. Food for thought.

I&#039;ve been in fights and used to pretty seriously kick box and do some martial arts. In classes and sparring, I&#039;ve thrown guys as big as the one that grabbed me over my head. <br /><br />But in the face of real danger, when I was actually surprised, I lost it. I didn&#039;t do or say any of the things I&#039;ve been trained to do. That&#039;s what really aggravates me and makes me upset. That I know I have the capability to defend myself, but when instinct kicked in and I was surprised and scared, I didn&#039;t use the skills I have.<br /><br />Plus, and I know this is stupid, I&#039;ll get my cards back and being out a little cash is no big deal. But this spring I splurged to take my boyfriend up to Boston to watch Beckett beat the crap out of Mussina in Fenway. It was a big turning point in our relationship and one of the best presents I&#039;ve ever gotten for someone. And the ticket stubs were in my wallet. Lame, but it&#039;s what makes me upset about the whole thing.

These are sentimental things, stuff that we feel possibly cements a relationship. When things like that are taken away from us we get affected. It&#039;s only natural. Granted I wasn&#039;t mugged in the street ( I still can&#039;t imagine you how must feel!) but when you lose something that is valuable <strong>to you</strong> it smarts. But they can be replaced, people can&#039;t. <br /><br /><br />As far&nbsp; using your experience with marital arts, it just goes to show that sometimes true instinct works better. As essen and others and I have said many times, at least you and Tim are ok and that&#039;s <strong>ALL</strong> that matters. The rest is gravy.

When I moved to New York, everything but the clothes on my back were stolen out of my van, and the thing I miss the most is not worth any money at all--my journal from high school and college. It can never be replaced. <br /><br />I learned from that--and probably you did too, from your experience--to never carry anything of sentimental value in my purse or wallet. Cards, cash, etc., can be replaced but a tangible memory item cannot. Glad you&#039;re ok!

				I just want to add that it&#039;s a good idea for everyone to take inventory of their wallet.&nbsp; Make a list of every credit card number and the 800 customer service number.&nbsp; Your driver&#039;s license number.&nbsp; Everything in there that can be cancelled and/or replaced.&nbsp; And if it is irreplaceable, then ask yourself if it really belongs in your wallet.&nbsp; Forget theft as in credit cards - but if there is anything in your wallet that would make you uncomfortable if it wound up in the hands of a stranger, then maybe you should leave those items home.&nbsp; I always did this, but I&#039;m pretty neurotic.&nbsp; I dropped my wallet in a cab in South America.&nbsp; When I realized it, I actually had a list of all the contents and all my credit card information.&nbsp; And written in a fairly unusual foreign language as a second level of security.&nbsp; In 15 minutes I was able to pick up the phone in Santiago, Chile and cancel all my cards and have AMEX checks waiting for me down the block.&nbsp; Of course my travel companion was outwardly impressed but inwardly freaked out, probably.<br /><br />Thanks for sharing this awful story.&nbsp; We often go out for drinks and stroll home like it&#039;s Mayberry.&nbsp; I guess the increase in prices of certain items has made some people desperate.&nbsp; Sadly we&#039;ll all have to watch our backs.&nbsp; And after late night cocktails, spring for a cab for safety sake.&nbsp; Spend a few extra bucks to avoid the bum who will harm you to get a few bucks.

				It might also take away some of the panic involved with these situations.&nbsp; Go ahead you fool, take my wallet.&nbsp; You&#039;ll enjoy whatever cash I have but when I get home it&#039;ll take about 15 minutes on the phone to arrange the replacement of everything else.&nbsp; Sometimes the sheer worry of everything disappearing might drive someone to make the mistake of fighting back and risking their personal safety unnecessarily.&nbsp; Hey, more power to you if you think you can fight off the person.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to risk a gun or knife coming out of nowhere.&nbsp; And I&#039;m just getting a little too old for all that.&nbsp; :x

				I know I am late to the party on this one, but I am glad that Para and her better half are ok.&nbsp; I have to admit that I have this fantasy scenario where some tries something like that on me, and I dispatch them terribly and swiftly.&nbsp; But I know that in a real life scenario, it&#039;s different and it doesn&#039;t always do down the way it does in your head.<br /><br />It makes me really mad when things like this happen in my town.&nbsp; And as someone who is constantly harping on quality of life nonsense like the bums who harass people and ask for change on Broadway, or the uptick in vandalism, I am extra disgusted.&nbsp; I see a connection between petty street crime like this and QOL violations.<br /><br />Some of you have said that price increases and economic hardship help to explain this.&nbsp; That may be so, but it does not justify it or mitigate it.&nbsp; By brushing it as people falling on hard times, it&#039;s like saying that these thieves are otherwise ok people.&nbsp; They&#039;re not.&nbsp; Good people get second jobs in hard time.&nbsp; Criminal scumbags steal from people.&nbsp; Quite frankly, they would do so without economic hardship.&nbsp; Eventually, someone around here will defend themselves, terminally.&nbsp; And I will have zero sympathy for whatever petty thief gets it.
