				I&#039;ve seen many a good looking lady, but never really see any of them regularly enough to make something of it. Perhaps someone that lives in a more tightly knit building might be able to comment.

				Alittle off topic, I was at the beer garden about 2 weeks ago with a lady friend, but I could tell it wasnt really going anywhere. But my luck the table we were at, these 4 really fun girls joined us. so we all started chatting, and I really hit it off with this one girl, who was clearly flirting with me.

Then he TRIED TO FOLLOW ME when I got off!<br /><br />Another time I got on the 2 train going the wrong way and this really adorable guy helped me out and was telling me all kinds of fascinating things about Brooklyn. No number, no nothing. sigh.

				Ok so since we are sort of on the topic, can the ladies on this thread please enlighten me as to what small hints you gals pass when you are in fact interested in a guy. I am def not one of those &quot;she&#039;s talking to me, she must want to <del>bump uglies</del> come home with me&quot; kind of guys, I&#039;m actually the exact opposite. A woman can throw a heart shaped rock at me and i&#039;d still be oblivious.....

				i think the obvious signs are:<br /><br />1. extended eye contact<br />2. smiling during extended eye contact<br />3. touching <br />4. passing along contact info<br />5. suggesting that you get together again in the future<br />6. happens to mention that she&#039;s single<br /><br />I&#039;m sure there are others.

				I could ask the same question of guys.&nbsp; How do you let a guy friend know you don&#039;t want to be &quot;just friends&quot;?&nbsp; How about those dinners where Mr. and Ms. Clueless have no idea if the other&#039;s interested. Or else you make a move and find out he&#039;s just getting over the ex-girlfriend, or he&#039;s gay, or he&#039;s just a friend.&nbsp; So embarrassing.&nbsp; &nbsp;:oops:&nbsp; I think we all need a little help!&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D

				After initially posting I thought I might should have expressed that some of the signs, like symptoms of disease, are only probably positive signals when they are accompanied by other signs. <br /><br />But since it&#039;s not a dissertation, and I have pointed out that I&#039;m no expert, I though I&#039;d skip that :D<br /><br />I mean, a number five on it&#039;s own is iffy. But number five plus number one is a strong possibility.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=8084.msg95721.html#msg95721">Quote from: daisy on October 05, 2007, 02:01:44 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">you make a move and find out he&#039;s just getting over the ex-girlfriend, or he&#039;s gay, or he&#039;s just a friend<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />BTDT. My solution is becoming a nun and foreswearing boyfriends. But yeah, that can be really agonizing. I think sometimes one person is interested and the other person isn&#039;t exactly interested but they enjoy the attention and subconsciously do things to keep the attention coming without actually giving a definitive answer (to an unexpressed question).

				The real question is how do you polietly tell someone &quot;no&quot; and still say &quot;but don&#039;t stop hanging out with me, you&#039;re cool!&quot; I personally find that if two friends like each other, stuff will happen eventually. It may take for.ev.er. but I think it usually does happen.

				I definitely collect the train crushes, too.&nbsp; There are so many beautiful women in this city that it drives this young feller nuts.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I too am a little (super) approach-deficient and I&#039;m not good at striking up conversation for many of the reasons already listed here.&nbsp; I end up thinking about all of them: she&#039;s got her iPod in, what if she&#039;s got a boyfriend, what if she doesn&#039;t want to talk, what if she gets off at the next stop, etc., etc.<br /><br />Because of all of this thinking-before-acting, I end up doing nothing but giving a stupid smile, usually when it&#039;s too late.<br /><br />Even if I get the courage to ask a girl out, I tend to be dating/relationship-handicapped.&nbsp; I&#039;m of the mindset that I know what I&#039;m looking for, so why settle for any less?&nbsp; Of course, this leads me to be critical of hanging out with someone that doesn&#039;t quite fit most or all of the criteria and, instead of dating them and perhaps seeing if it could work out, I usually just end it.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to hurt anyone or lead them on, so I always try to cut if off quickly before too strong of feelings develop.&nbsp; <br /><br />Needless to say, this leaves me pretty damn dateless and makes it tough to have girl...friends that aren&#039;t in relationships with other guys.&nbsp; Pretty much every time I&#039;ve had a girl that I&#039;m friends with that&#039;s single, awkward situations develop.&nbsp; Usually because it goes too far while drinking one night, then it&#039;s weird after that.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Or I&#039;m just an a-hole...<br /><br />Jeez, you&#039;d think I was on Dr. Phil.

				Regarding &quot;no&quot; and what means &quot;no, i&#039;m not interested so stop talking to me&quot; from the perspective of flirter to receiver:<br /><br />1. The ipod earphones stay in the receiver&#039;s ear. (not interested in a long convo.)<br />2. The flirter is the only one asking questions. If the receiver isn&#039;t reciprocating with a question, they aren&#039;t interested.<br />3. Checking the phone.<br />4. Still glancing at their reading materials occasionally to show &quot;i&#039;d like to get back to my reading.&quot; <br />5. Response with &quot;mhmmm&quot; instead of meaningful response to a question.<br />6. Decreased eye contact<br /><br /><br />Just a couple of things I&#039;ve tried doing to get the point across. Doesn&#039;t always work.

				I agree with you Red Sox Fan- girls (and guys) shouldn&#039;t be afraid to go after what they want!! <br /><br />A longtime ago I had a crush on a guy that rode the same subway each morning as me.&nbsp; After nearly a year of crushing on this guy whom I so cleverly nicknamed&nbsp; Subway Boy&nbsp; :wink:) I decided to do something about it. I printed up a invitation to a Christmas party that my roomate and I were having and walked up to him as I got off the train at Grand Central and handed him an invitation. I said to him &quot;my roomate and I are having a party and I would love for you to be there&quot;. That night he called me and he ending up coming to the party with some friends. Long story short we dated for 3 1/2 years.<br /><br />Bottom line-just go for it! If the person you approach isn&#039;t interested- just look at it as there loss.&nbsp; :-D<br />

				Nice Thread! Just discovered it. <br /><br />Here&#039;s my thing about it: Girls think guys are always hitting on them, guys usually are. That makes me afraid to just have a casual conversation with a girl because I always think she thinks I&#039;m just trying to get her to sleep with me. Sometimes, it&#039;s just nice to talk to a lady, ya know?<br />I do blame scummy guys though- definitely makes it harder for the rest of us to just be able to talk to a girl without that fear that she thinks I&#039;m some sort of sex-crazed perv. <br />The last time I randomly talked to a girl on the subway, it was because we were both reading &quot;The Kite Runner&quot; and made some eye contact and just started talking about how good the book was. I probably should have been smooth and found some excuse to ask her to hang out... but I am laaame. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=8084.msg96219.html#msg96219">Quote from: RedSoxfanNYC on October 09, 2007, 02:24:26 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I like to think of myself as a pretty progressive guy, but IMO the whole &quot;saying something&quot; thing is a two way street.

				It is SO funny that I found this thread.&nbsp; I was just planning on posting something on this topic.&nbsp; You want to know about crushes in Astoria...I&#039;ve got a good story for you.<br /><br />The girl i see once every two months<br /><br />I have lived here in Astoria coming up on three years in March.&nbsp; When I got here I was dating this girl, in fact, she moved in with me.&nbsp; We lived together for a year and a half, but we both knew our relationship was falling apart.&nbsp; It finally did last march. (amicably might I add)&nbsp; Since day <strong>one </strong> of moving here, there has been this girl that I see once every two months, but when I do, it feels like my heart is about to jump out of my chest.&nbsp; She&#039;s beautiful, seems intelligent and I would just LOVE to have a cup of coffee (or just go do whatever) with her.&nbsp; She&#039;s got this beautiful curly hair and this incredible smile.&nbsp; So, while I was dating my ex-gf, clearly the thought had crossed my mind that if we ever broke up I would want to find a way to meet this girl that I see and and ask her out.<br /><br />Well, I&#039;ve seen her a few times since the breakup and every time I swear to myself that the next time i see her I&#039;ll start chatting with her...So tonight I see her...I just got a haircut and as i&#039;m walking out i see her walking into the Family Market next door.&nbsp; I immediately freak out...I just got out of getting my haircut (which of course looks like I&#039;m from the 70s) and I&#039;m thinking to myself, &quot;is this the time? Can I pull this off now? Can I go up and meet her?&quot;<br /><br />So I tried setting it up so that I would be walking past as she came out and it worked, but then I got nervous...so she wound up walking all the way down my block pretty much across the street and then behind me...I couldn&#039;t get the words :(&nbsp; I have NO idea how to approach her...what the hell could I say?&nbsp; So, I keep thinking now...maybe the next time...in two months.&nbsp; Well, that was lame...hahaha...I guess I just wish I knew some way of meeting her...I was never good with talking to women I don&#039;t know...never good at the small talk because it always seemed so superficial...<br /><br />I know this is about crushes on astorian strangers, but it was far too coincidental NOT to post my story given that this all just happened tonight and I just thought to look on here...<br /><br />Anyone has any good ideas, let me know<br /><br />Later party people,<br />Chris

				Chris, that is so sweet!&nbsp; You should definitely speak to this woman as soon as possible - before she gets involved in any serious relationships, leaving you to wonder &quot;what if&quot; forever.&nbsp; <br /><br />My mom was married the first time she saw my dad. She and her first husband knew they were going to divorce soon, but still she told him that night &quot;I met the man I should have married today&quot;... a year later she went on to marry my dad and have four kids!&nbsp; She says she felt a &quot;chemical reaction&quot; the second he walked in the door of the ICU (where she was working and he was a new resident).&nbsp; <br /><br />If you have a physical reaction every time you see her, who knows?! this could be fate (if you believe in that). Go for it!&nbsp; Just make sure to keep it cool, and not mention that you&#039;ve noticed her for the past several months, it might freak her out.&nbsp; You can tell her that later, after you&#039;ve been dating for a while... Good luck!&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				I don&#039;t think that knowing whether a person is taken or not is that important.&nbsp; I&#039;ve definitely run into that wall talking to someone on the train and, usually, they were nice enough to drop subtle hints that they were taken.&nbsp; That or they just made sure to say that they &quot;moved up here/live with their boyfriend&quot; or something along those lines.<br /><br />Chris - good luck, man.&nbsp; Just GO FOR IT!&nbsp; What&#039;s the worst thing that&#039;ll happen?&nbsp; She says go away.&nbsp; What&#039;s the best?&nbsp; You end up with a great relationship.&nbsp; The potential gains far outweigh the potential losses...<br /><br />Of course, it&#039;s easier said than done and I have dropped the ball PLENTY of times because I was too nervous to say anything.&nbsp; But, it sucks MUCH more to kick myself for the next hour/day/week/month/year for not saying ANYTHING than it does to just feel like a tool because she has a BF or isn&#039;t interested.<br /><br />But, I think it has to do with the chemical attraction, of which I am a 100% believer in...and totally powerless against.&nbsp; Getting butterflies when I just look at someone is a situation that turns me into a total toolbag and usually leaves me hating myself for not saying anything.&nbsp; Even a voice cracking, nervous &quot;Hi&quot; is better than nothing because if they feel the same way, it&#039;ll play out.<br /><br />So, see if it&#039;ll play out.&nbsp; The reward could be great.

				For me, the apprehension on the train would come not from the girl herself (although there would be some there, as well), but predominately from all the other people on the train.&nbsp; Most of the time, the train is pretty silent and if I struck up a conversation, I get the idea that everyone else would suddenly focus on the conversation also.&nbsp; And that would make me more nervous than I already was.&nbsp; I&#039;m not good at public speaking, let alone flirting in front of a group.&nbsp;

				oh my god, i just remembered that years and years ago (before i was married), i used to see this guy once and a while on the N train in the morning.&nbsp; he was the epitome of H-O-T to me at the time.&nbsp; long black hair, exotic looking.&nbsp; best of all at 8:00 in the morning, he&#039;d be sporting these leather pants.&nbsp; he was like something out of the lost boys.&nbsp; haha.&nbsp; i recall he caught me staring at him once.&nbsp; i suddenly looked away and then at the next stop he was gone.&nbsp; &lt;SIGH&gt;<br /><br />i used to get these momentary crushes all the time.&nbsp; i distinctly remember two other instances though.&nbsp; <br /><br />one was this guy on the train on halloween night.&nbsp; really cute, but when i looked more closely at him, he had a swastika drawn over his third eye.&nbsp; he was dressed as charlie manson.&nbsp; not so cute anymore (even if it was just a costume).<br /><br />the other, i don&#039;t even know what he looked like.&nbsp; i recall it was the middle of winter and i was sitting.&nbsp; from under the brim of my baseball hat, i saw this guy get on the train.&nbsp; actually since the train was so packed, i just saw his feet.&nbsp; it&#039;s REALLY strange, but something about his sneakers and the way his jeans cuffed around them really (and literally) turned me on.&nbsp; his back was facing me for the rest of the time he was on the train, so i never saw the rest of him.&nbsp; i don&#039;t know what it was that day, but wow.&nbsp; i&#039;ve never experienced anything like that since.

				While emptying the recycling bin a few days ago, some guy on a skateboard was rolling past, and I noticed as he passed by, turned his head and looked at me for an extra couple of seconds.&nbsp; 8-)<br /><br />Considering I&#039;m probably old enough to be his....uhh....babysitter, I thought that was cool. &#039;course could&#039;ve been anything else- I look familiar, maybe he realized it was recycling day, a cute squirrel was nearby......who knows!

				There used to be this Greek flat chested girl who never walked around with a bra and had her hair cropped real short and would wear Lisa Loeb type glasses.&nbsp; Would always try to catch her eye.&nbsp;

				This is a very important topic!&nbsp; I never have the guts to talk to someone on the train though.&nbsp; Mostly because of knowing that all of the other riders are watching... But really, it would be nice if everyone were a little friendlier.&nbsp; Commuting would be a lot more fun. <br /><br />We routinely contort ourselves to fit on the train and end up smushed against strangers (who, if you were in any other circumstance and they touched you in those places, you would slap) but none of us have the balls to go up and say hello to anyone!
