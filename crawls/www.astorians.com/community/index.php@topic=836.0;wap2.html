			Enigmacat, this is very interesting, and the issue is extremely important right now. &nbsp;However, this article has a fundamental flaw by not starting with - not even mentioning - the 1973 oil crisis. &nbsp; &nbsp;This is the gas crisis that did change American driving habits, rather than anything that happened in 1979. &nbsp;Those events, while significant, were part of a continuum of gas crises, and near the end of them.<br /><br />I remember the gas lines, the locking gas caps, and the sugar crisis (which I recall as being somehow related) of the early 1970s. &nbsp;This is when Congress mandated the national 55 mph speed limit, carpooling became popular, and cars were produced that had substantially better gas mileage. &nbsp; When it came time for us to trade in our mid-60s Beetle, our new purchase was in direct response to the gas crisis - we bought a (new) '74 Ford Pinto station wagon that got 25 mpg. &nbsp;(we traded that in in 1980 for a diesel Rabbit, btw.)<br /><br />Initially, it seemed that conservation was making inroads, and I remember as advertising shifted from performance to fuel economy as top selling points - and then back again as the 80s wore on. &nbsp;Reagan's energy policies were discouraging to conservation efforts (to say the least), and I believe the growing openess of the connections between the US energy industry and the US government is both a cause and a symptom of the difficulties facing those who want to emphasise conservation today.<br /><br />Fuel economy standards were enacted in response to the 1973 oil crisis. &nbsp;They resulted in the doubling of fuel economy in cars by the end of the 1970s. &nbsp;Since then, there have been no meaningful increases, and - more harmfully, I think - an increase in exemption of vehicles from CAFE standards by reclassifying them as &quot;light trucks&quot; - like the Hummer, for instance (which weighs more than a Japanese fighter plane in WWII). &nbsp;What has happened? &nbsp;Corporate insistence in equating conservation with less profit - and indeed, for many in the administration today, conservation does result in less profit for them. &nbsp;<br /><br />The basic framework to change people's attitudes is already in place, and has been for 30 years. &nbsp;Despite corporate resistance in the 1970s, regulatory standards were introduced that did make a difference (and without them, we'd be in even worse shape today). &nbsp;This is an area that will not regulate itself in favour of conservation. &nbsp;There seems to be a popular recognition at the moment that something needs to be done, which needs to be seized by environmental groups and those in both industry and government who care about the issue. &nbsp;We certainly need more than Bush's declaration that if we can, we should &quot;drive a little less&quot;, which is kind of like saying not to buy lightbulbs if you don't have any sockets to put them in.
