				Try a new service called TaskRabbit.&nbsp; http://www.taskrabbit.com/ (http://www.taskrabbit.com/)<br />They will send you exactly what you want and it&#039;s way cheaper than anyone person or service in Astoria charges.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been using TaskRabbit for several months now and wouldn&#039;t use anyone else.

				I&#039;m also looking for a cleaning service but for something more regular, perhaps every other week and ideally including laundry (we have coin operated machines in the building).&nbsp; I would really prefer to hire someone in the neighborhood and not through a service.&nbsp; Do you have someone who cleans your apartment who you can recommend or do you provide this service? Thanks!
