			The redistricting thing really is suspicious.&nbsp; The population of Ravenswood is bigger than many towns.&nbsp; For that reason alone we should have our own polling site.

			All the election districts were redrawn due to redistricting. I went from the 58th ED to the 20th ED without leaving my building. <br /><br /><br />You could try calling either the main Board of Elections line 866-868-3692, or the Queens BOE office at 718-730-6730 to verify. Probably worth doing either way, since the Board proved on June 26th that they sometimes leave much to be desired.

			I also have been moved to St. Joseph&#039;s. But I&#039;m not complaining, since its closer to me than the previous polling site (P.S. 70). and of course the pages were sticky and messy.. it was put together by the NYC Board of Elections. Did you expect the BOE to do something competently lol
