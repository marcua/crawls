				Haha the best part of that article is the pic of Depp with the straight-faced caption &quot;A man in full pirate regalia&quot;, like it&#039;s from an encyclopedia or something.<br /><br />

				The god which demands more of our attention and reverance is Parkamithios, the Greek God of Parking.<br /><br />Sacrifice one imaginary chicken or goat when heading into a area of little parking.&nbsp; If Parkamithios is pleased, then he/she (hemaphroditic god) shall bestow a parking spot unto you.<br /><br />Parkamithios lives amoungst the other Astorian gods on their mount near 30th Avenue, where they sips frappes and watch American Idol.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I believe there was a family on Wife Swap or Trading Spouses, who wore Renaissance costumes and behaved accordingly.&nbsp; The children were home-schooled and, essentially had no friends.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think they called it a religion, though.&nbsp; I&#039;m probably making this part up, but I could sworn that they referred to the wife as &quot;wench.&quot;&nbsp;

				Speaking of pirates, has anyone noticed the life-size pirate statue in front of one of the hooka places on Steinway. I saw it earlier this evenign and was like <em>WTF???</em> It&#039;s on the left side of the street as you head north. Right around where all teh hooka places are, between 28th and the GCP.<br /><br />I wish I had a camera. You have to check it out. It looks like it was carved out of wood or something, like those old tobacco store indians. Must have cost a fortune.

				That place that burned down on Steinway next to the place with the pink cadallac hanging out of it, used to have a huge pirate outside of it too.&nbsp; I wonder if it&#039;s the same one.&nbsp; That place was Brazilian I think.
