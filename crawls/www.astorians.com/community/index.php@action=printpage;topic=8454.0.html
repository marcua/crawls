				Has anyone else noticed how bad Hoyt Avenue has gotten over the last few months?&nbsp; The grass on both sides of the street has been left to grow over with no care.&nbsp; People have been littering and throwing full garbage bags into the mess that is the grass. Graffiti has been left up by the bridge and on buildings all along the ave.&nbsp; <br /><br />Beyond the cosmetic problems, my car has been broken into 3 times in 6 months.&nbsp; Is this happening to a lot of others?&nbsp; <br /><br />Does sanitation or the police need an invitation to deal with these issues??<br /><br />

				In terms of clean up, if this is a public area I would call 311 and make a complaint. They will also be able to provide you with a graffiti removal form which can be given to the owner of the building. The removal is free, but only if the owner signs the form. If it is a private area, I am not sure what calling 311 will do but it doesn&#039;t hurt to call.

				Have already called 311 and spoken to our Councilman about it.&nbsp; Yet it gets no better.&nbsp; It is highly unlikely that this grass is on private property.&nbsp; From what I can gather, it needs to be more than a lone voice to spur movement.&nbsp; Anyone else noticing this problem that lives by Hoyt.<br /><br />Lack of sanitation services seems to be a systemic problem in our area.&nbsp; See other threads in this section on the conditions of Ditmars Blvd in the morning.&nbsp;
