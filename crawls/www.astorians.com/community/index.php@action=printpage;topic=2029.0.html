				Hi Everybody! (Hi Dr. Nick)&nbsp; &nbsp;8-)<br /><br /><br />I just want to say hello and introduce myself. I just moved to Astoria in January, another California transplant. I&#39;m living with my sister (shout out to JustDesserts!) and you all seem like cool people.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />Also, does anyone know what the construction on 35th Ave between 35th and 36th streets is? Is it something to do with the studios?<br /><br />Just wondering - thanks!

				The long standing answer is that it will be a grocery, perhaps a c-town.&nbsp; On the other hand some are hoping for a whole foods.&nbsp; Im hoping for a southern style restaurant with good grub and a juke box. But thats another story.<br /><br />Welcome to the neighborhood.&nbsp; Wife and I just got back from CA and loved it.&nbsp; Where are you all from?<br /><br />

				If I remember correctly, Dr. Nick classifies Homer as &quot;dangerously underweighted&quot; in the episode &quot;King Size Homer&quot; and recommends &quot;a slow steady gorging process combined with assal horizontology&quot; as a remedy.<br /><br />Welcome to Astoria INC!&nbsp; I am also from CA originally, and have lived in both Northern (Bay Area) and Southern (Ventura/Ojai/Santa Clarita Valley) California.&nbsp;

				On the other coast, do you think there is a board in Brea full of fugees from NYC?<br />Do we just love the snow?<br />After enough years, SoCal just seemed so much the same, the same.<br /><br />Wondering how long it would take to feel the same way about NYC.<br />Dont you wonder what NYC will look like when construction is finished, before the sun dies out.

				Oh yeah, in the midst of all my Dr. Nick quoting, I forgot to say welcome!&nbsp; I guess all the quotes are my little way of saying that.<br /><br />&quot;Now by the morning you&#39;ll be good as new.

The important thing is, we&#39;ll know.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Now, if something should go wrong, let&#39;s not get the law involved.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;When you were in that coma, did you feel your brain getting damaged?&quot;<br /><br />and finally...<br /><br />&quot;Seriously, baby, I can prescribe anything that I want.&quot;

				Just to clear up confusion on the construction:&nbsp; The rumored C-Town construction site is actually on 34th Ave, behind the Kaufman studios.&nbsp; (For awhile it was speculated to be a Food Lion, then hoped to be a Whole Foods, but the construction workers reportedly have confirmed it as C-Town).<br /><br />The construction on 35th Ave, according to the sign, is going to be the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts.&nbsp; No idea how Kaufman Astoria is supposed to be &quot;expanding&quot; when all of their buildings are being converted, but maybe it has something to do with all the exterior shots that &quot;Pride and Glory&quot; has been doing lately.<br /><br />The Astoria Barnes and Noble, meanwhile, is still a pipe dream.<br /><br />
