				I&#039;ve almost got it all. I took the plunge and moved from upstate down here, got a job with a marketing firm in downtown Manhattan doing just what I want to do. To ice this cake, I now need an Astoria apartment.<br />I, like everyone else, love Astoria. Try as I might to be open to other areas, nothing compares. Unfortunately, my budget is not that large - under $1000. I&#039;m caving and contacting brokers, but I thought it wouldn&#039;t hurt to post something here just in case.<br />I would love a 1br, but know a studio is more likely. It doesn&#039;t need to be super large, just larger than the walk in closets that landlords have tried to rent as apartments, thanks. Clean, modern, and in Astoria is all I&#039;m adamant about. I&#039;m looking to rent before or on April 1. <br /><br />E-mail theresanna@gmail.com if you&#039;ve got anything. Thanks.

				You may want to consider sharing an apartment with roommates - or renting a room in an already occupied apartment. I think it will be tough to find a reasonable apartment for less than $1000 - unless you don&#039;t mind doing a studio or living further away from public transit or the main areas of Astoria.<br /><br />Good luck - I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find something!

				the share thing isn&#039;t that bad. honeslty if you are worried about having your boyfrined over, unless he&#039;s moving in, it shouldn&#039;t be a problem, you should take a look at people looking for roomates. find someone your age just talk about it. if they dont&#039; want any guests, then move on.<br />my experience with shares is that&#039;s what it is. you are sharing the apartment. <br />its really not so bad, and unfortunatley a mini necessity in NYC.
