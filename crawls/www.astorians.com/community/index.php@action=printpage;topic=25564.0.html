				I have a 4 year old son with special needs who will be going next year to kindergarten. Normally the comittee on special education ( CSE) will recommend a program after re-evaluating him and observing his progress but I would like to look beforehand into what kind of special needs programs are available in public schools in Astoria.I looked trough websites of nearby schools but no information on special needs program whatsoever. I have heard trough a friend about the integrated classes at PS122 but I want to look into a more smaller class setting options because of his speech delay. Do I have to go or call each school and ask about it?Isn&#039;t there any information available online? Any advice, suggestions will be highly appreciated.<br />Thank you!<br />Dorothy

				Hi Dorothy, nice to meet you!<br /><br />It might be a good idea to call or email our District 30 CEC.&nbsp; They can at least steer you in the right direction and are always willing to answer parent questions.<br /><br />There&#039;s information on them on this website:&nbsp; http://insideschools.org/districts/queens/district-30 (http://insideschools.org/districts/queens/district-30)<br />Superintendent: Dr. Philip Composto (pcompos@schools.nyc.gov), (718) 391-8323<br />Family advocate: Bandna Sharma (BSharma@schools.nyc.gov), (718) 391-8323<br />CEC: Community Education Council 30 (CEC30@schools.nyc.gov), (718) 391-8380<br />District 30 office<br />28-11 Queens Plaza North<br />Long Island City, NY&nbsp; 11101 <br />Special Education<br />Most questions about special education can be answered by your child&#039;s teacher or principal. If you are new to New York City or your child attends private or parochial school, contact the nearest Committee on Special Education (http://schools.nyc.gov/Academics/SpecialEducation/CSE/default.htm) for an evaluation.<br />Committee on Special Education <br />Chris Cenicola<br />28-11 Queens Plaza North<br />&nbsp;Long Island City, NY&nbsp; 11101<br />&nbsp;Phone: (718) 391-8405 <br />They are also on Facebook:&nbsp; https://www.facebook.com/#!/CDEC30 (https://www.facebook.com/#!/CDEC30)<br />I hope this helps.

				Thank you very much for the info I have looked into those and eventually will contact them. I will be having orientation meeting with CSE at the District 30 in December and I hope to have some questions answered.I am just very unpleasantly surprised that there isn&#039;t any online resources about types of programs offered or at least&nbsp; some general info about what kind of special needs program each school offers and services provided to special needs children, so I can pick up a few and take a look at the class setting and program. Makes me wonder if this is intentional, so the CSE will make the decision and just send the parents/child to the chosen program instead of allowing parents to be able to make suggestions/decisions in the matter.

				I can&#039;t swear to it - but I think the reason there isn&#039;t differentiated information is because all schools are supposed to offer the same services, based on what is outlined in a child&#039;s IEP.&nbsp; <br />Some may have ICT and some self-contained, but in general they are supposed to be the same across schools.

				You have to call each school individually and inquire.&nbsp; Most of them will say they are not touring or doing open houses until Jan/Feb.&nbsp; &nbsp;The local school is supposed to fulfill the IEP, but most schools don&#039;t have special programs - they just have an ICT class or 12:1:1 and related services according to what is on the IEP.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				BoredTemp, thank you so much for posting those links! We are still in the middle of getting my son&#039;s diagnosis -- this is all very new to us. But it&#039;s clear he&#039;s going to need special education services in Kindergarten (he&#039;s still being testing for WHAT exactly, but speech for sure). He is currently enrolled in a non-special-ed Pre-K, so we wouldn&#039;t have gotten that letter/info since I am *just* opening up this whole can of worms. So daunting. This is great, though. Really helped us out :)

				For those of you with children in the area and who are on facebook, you should consider joining the Astoria Parents group and the District 30 education group - very useful for parents!
