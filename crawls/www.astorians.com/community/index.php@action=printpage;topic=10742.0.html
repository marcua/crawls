				I used to go to Richard Ley&#039;s place to get our vehicle inspected but since he&#039;s gone I&#039;m not sure where to go.&nbsp; Is there another reputable place in town that can do an emissions test?

				I go to Nick at a shop on Steinway, near 23 Ave.&nbsp; I really like them there and have gone with every problem for the past 2 years. Let me know if you want the phone number there.

				718-545-6129 - I honestly don&#039;t know the name of the place but it&#039;s big and been around for years (I get the impression.) I believe the father owned it originally and the adult son has become a partner now.&nbsp; It&#039;s on Steinway between Astoria Blvd and 23 Ave, but closer to 23 Ave.&nbsp;

				Actually the name of it is Steinway Auto Repair, it&#039;s right around the corner from me, and I started going there&nbsp; after having several rip offs by local mechanics. Nick is honest and doesn&#039;t just charge you for nothing.

				Louie at the Texaco station on 31st and 78th Street (a block past the Waldbaums shopping center).&nbsp; I&#039;ve gone for a decade and sent people.&nbsp; &nbsp;No one&#039;s ever not liked him or thought his prices were unfair.&nbsp; He&#039;s a nice man.&nbsp; 429-3852

				We took our car once to Yellow Bird on 20th Ave and 29th St.&nbsp; Just oil, fluids, regular check up.&nbsp; So I can&#039;t speak to their skills for major repair work.&nbsp; But they were very accommodating and the location is easy to get in and out of.&nbsp; 718-626-5281.

				Mira Auto Repairs, 12st and 30th Ave., the shop has been there since 1976. It&#039;s also the only shop in N.Y.C. that still fixes Checker Cabs.
