				On some level, both measures suck.&nbsp; You can have some mamaluke &quot;feeling you up&quot; or that same person &quot;oogling you on a hand held monitor&quot;.&nbsp; I want to feel safe but I think the people hired to maintain security aren&#039;t always the brightest bulbs on the porch.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know which is better.&nbsp; And sometimes these security people get a little &quot;power mad&quot; like the guy with me in Portland.&nbsp; He was on some weird trip.&nbsp; I was furious and powerless while he borderline exposed me to passersby.&nbsp; I think I&#039;d rather have the monitor.

				Yeah, security asking you to take down your pants in an open airport is over the top unacceptable.&nbsp; After 9/11 I was constantly stopped at airport security, and even then it was uncomfortable, and things have only gotten more stressful for travelers.&nbsp; <br />Between the insane security measures that are being put in place and airlines charging for ANY checked baggage, I&#039;m getting to the point that I don&#039;t want to fly unless it&#039;s absolutely necessary.&nbsp;

On July 23, the first and only successful hijacking of an El Al aircraft took place, when a 707 carrying 10 crew and 38 passengers was taken over by three members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). The aircraft was en route from Rome to Lod. The hijackers diverted it to Algiers. Bargaining with the hijackers went on for 40 days. Both the hijackers and the passengers, including 21 Israeli hostages, were eventually freed. On December 26 of the same year, two PFLP members attacked an El Al aircraft at Athens Airport, killing an Israeli mechanic. The Israeli Defense Forces responded on December 29 with a night-time raid on Lebanon&#039;s Beirut Airport, destroying 14 planes on the ground belonging to Middle East Airlines, Trans Mediterranean Airways and Lebanese International Airways. On 18 February 1969, Palestinians attacked an El Al plane at Zurich Airport killing the copilot and injuring the pilot. One Palestinian attacker was killed and others were convicted but later released. Between September and December 1969, bomb and grenade attacks occurred at El Al offices in Athens, West Berlin, and Brussels. This wave of violence culminated in the failed hijacking of an El Al 707 by Patrick Arguello and Leila Khaled on September 6, 1970, as part of the Dawson&#039;s Field hijackings.

				Hmm... I am all for security, but this one makes me a little uncomfortable.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s probably because some of the TSA screeners seem to be either on a power trip, or not too sharp.&nbsp; <br /><br />I just got back from Rochester and went through the &quot;air puffer&quot; machine which senses explosive residue.&nbsp; I&#039;m fine with that, but this seems a little more invasive.<br /><br />I think the key for me is how detailed these images are.&nbsp; If they are really as detailed as the article suggests, that&#039;s a problem.&nbsp; But if you can&#039;t tell much about a person&#039;s contours from them, that&#039;s not as bad.

La Guardia airport has mostly immigrants--legal, I assume--working security.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m NOT saying all Arabs should be tossed on floor and searched, but common sense needs to be shown.&nbsp; And doing things, like making my aunt, 74 when Trade Center went down, 81 years old now, go through search,&nbsp; &nbsp;being made to wait as much as 2 hours for people to be screened, is a shame.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I know what you&#039;re saying, but, I believe everybody should be screened. You have to remember, the 9/11 hijackers &#039;westernised&#039; their look to blend in, certainly, there are sympathisers&nbsp; worldwide, and in this&nbsp; city. They can speed it up with these&nbsp; measures, but, many object. I just don&#039;t see how one&nbsp; can argue &#039;privacy&#039;&nbsp; in an airport?

There was a&nbsp; great&nbsp; UK TV&nbsp; movie based&nbsp; on 9/11 called&nbsp; the Hamburg Cell, which outlined&nbsp; how some of the Hijackers&nbsp; spent time&nbsp; trying to &#039;westernise&#039;&nbsp; themselves.
