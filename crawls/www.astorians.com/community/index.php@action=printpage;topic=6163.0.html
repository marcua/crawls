				Bubble tea can be found in Flushing (had it once and found it weird......yet I kinda crave it now sometimes. WTF?!)<br /><br />As for chocolate-covered espresso beans, damn hook a sistah up somebody!! Starbucks might be the only hope, though the one on Ditmars doesn&#039;t seem to carry them.

				Bubble tea can be found on Ditmars &amp; 37th directly across from Trade Fair in some pseudo chinese noodle place. I never actually had bubble tea but I know he sells it. As for chocolate covered espresso beans, try Rosarios on 31st bet. Ditmars and 23rd ave, or any one of the European type markets. If all else fails you could always try a place like Porto Rico coffee importers in Manhattan (either on St. Marks in the E. Village or on Bleeker in the W. Village) I know that they have it for sure. Not sure of the price though.

				I&#039;ve had chocolate covered espresso beans from Porto Rico as well, but I don&#039;t know of anything locally. It seems to me that some Astoria coffee shops, other than Starbucks, would have them. It&#039;s kind of weird in my mind that you&#039;d have to go all the way to Manhattan to get those... I would think that you could probably request your favorite local coffee shop to carry them. It&#039;s doubtful you&#039;re the only one that would be buying them! :)

				For bubble tea I frequent Oz Cafe in Elmhurst; it is on the RGV line at Grand Street.&nbsp; It&#039;s on Broadway just beside the LIRR overpass, you can Google the exact address. Good food too!

				I can&#039;t swear by this but I think I&#039;ve seen chocolate covered goodness at E-Sparks.&nbsp; Small packages like Starbucks only I didn&#039;t look for espresso beans explicitly.<br /><br />Also Trader Joes sells them in lethal quantities.<br /><br />The freeze peach just started selling honey espresso ice cream.&nbsp; Not espresso beans but freakin&#039; awesome ice cream.<br /><br />

I had a housemate once who was an environmental toxicologist. He poisoned mice for a living. I was eating a fair number of chocolate-covered espresso beans at the time. He helped me figure out the LD50 (dose of a poison that kills 50% of the population) of espresso beans. It was, if I recall, about 1 kg of beans for the average human. That&#039;s about 2 pounds, or 12 cups of beans, or enough to make something like 75 or 100 cups of joe. I have a feeling you would <strong>wish</strong> you were dead long before then...

				Ok so I revise my statement, reflecting this new information from Harlan.<br /><br />Trader Joes sells choc-covered espresso beans in nearly lethal quantities.&nbsp; Buy 2 vats of them and you&#039;re toast.<br /><br />Seriously though, it is not right to sell chocolate covered espresso beans by the pre-packaged pound.
