				I&#039;ve never understood the &quot;Naked &lt;Insert Activity Here&gt;&quot; phenomenon. I find clothes to be quite comfortable. :)

				Frappe, are you suggesting a naked bike-a-thon? Seems kind of cool, but i&quot;m not quite making the connection between car fumes hurting people and the need to be naked...I could imagine naked biking could have some painful repercussions, more so for men.

				I suppose its not so easy to reply frankly without getting the &quot;dude, I did <strong><span class="bbc_u">NOT</span></strong> need to know that!&quot; response.<br /><br />I feel alot more comfy in my birthday suit then with clothes on and alot more happier on a bicycle then in a car, so I guess it makes a good enough combo.&nbsp; I&#039;d be alot more pleased if neither cars nor clothes were required facets of our society, which is I guess why I love fire island so much.&nbsp; So I&#039;d definately do a ride like that, though perhaps practical considerations might mandate some precautions.&nbsp;

				You&#039;d want plastic covering your seat that for sure.&nbsp; And plenty of gold bond body powder... although there&#039;s only one part of my body I ever use the body powder on.

				I guess it is more grabbing people&#039;s attention than making a connection, cause I sure as hell don&#039;t see it. But I don&#039;t think people would get the point, other than giving the suggestions, after seeing a lot of naked bodies, that more biking is needed. <br /><br />And while it may be uncomfortable for men, the girls need support too.

				I just came back from Portland, OR, and they had a midnight naked bike ride on a saturday night. It was part of their &quot;pedal palooza&quot; week. :)
