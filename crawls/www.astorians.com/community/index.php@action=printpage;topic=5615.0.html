				Hi Everybody!<br /><br />I have only been to Astoria a few times to visit my friends; however, when I started thinking of where I wanted to move, I decided that Astoria would be the place. I&nbsp; work on the UES and currently commute from NJ. I would love to find a one bedroom for around $1200 and want to move in May. I have been looking at Craigslist and wondered if people had suggestions for realtors or buildings that would be great. I would like to live near areas that have great restaurants, a bar, coffee shop etc. I am really excited to learn more and hear your feedback as I begin my search this weekend! :-)

				That should be possible. The one-bedroom next door to me just rented out for $1150. I&#039;m right around the corner from the Broadway stop. The super said that it went to the first person who saw it, so be ready to pounce.<br />The first posting on this board should help in finding realtors: http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=2913.0 (http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=2913.0) but I&#039;d keep all your options open since I got my place through one of the realtors others thought was &quot;sketchy&quot; although I had no problem with them.
