								<div class="inner" id="msg_104643">I came to this board cause I am a virtualy life-long Astoria resident. I figured I&#039;d give the &#039;Politics&#039; board a look and that the debate here would be robust, but, at least in the realm of reality. Sadly, I see the usual crackpot theories and nutty websites that are par for the course on the web channeled here too. Still, as someone who came to this country from Europe, and whose relatives were butchered by both Nazis and Commies, I can attest to extremism when I see it. One such extremism is the hatred and sheer lunancy that has gripped many folks against the President. It is not based on reality anymore. The removal of Saddam and the Taliban were not only a needed move, but, it opened a region closed to the outside and bought the fight and current attack of Islamic extremists to their home, after they bought it to ours for decades culminating in 9/11. You may not agree, and I don&#039;t, with some of the early military decsions, but, given the military available after the draconian cuts during the 1990&#039;s, the USA had to act fast after 9/11. The newly discovered &#039;concern&#039; for &#039;human rights&#039;, by those who supported Castro for decades, on what is happeing on Gitmo, Cuba is bad enough, but, to say the Patriot Act and some other MODEST measures, compared to what FDR did in WW 2, makes Bush a &#039;dictator&#039; is ludicrous on the surface. Only slip and fall attorneys and the legal establishment who want to treat this as a &#039;crime&#039; problem could possibly believe it. <br /><br />We live in a world of REAL dictatorships. China, who is flooding our markets for at least 15 years with cheap goods, often dangerous, are builidng up their tech and communist Armed forces. Chavez in Venezuela, Hollywoods buddy after Castro, who has suspended and rewrote the entire constitution and is trying to be President for life, cozying up to Irans leader a holocaust denier who wants Nukes, and was onlt &#039;stopped. albeit temporarily by the&nbsp; removal of Saddam in 2003. We are told the world &#039;hates&#039; us cause of GW. The REALITY is that in Europe, Germany, France, the two heads of the so-called &#039;Anti-War&#039; movement recently elected decidedly Pro-War and Pro-USA leaders. Anyone can now see that the war is turning the tide and the extremists are on the run. The only ones who refuse to see this are people who are tired of war, understandable, and unrepetent Anti-Semites like Pat Buchanan, who have teamed up in an &#039;unholy&#039; alliance of assorted America haters, righties and lefties. In the end, we have no choice, but, to fight this war. Retreat is surrender. My nephew is in Iraq, and I want him home NOW, but, when I send him articles of what is being written and shown from Hollywood/media about his and his fellow soldiers efforts, he is angry and disgusted and tells me how it bears little to reality. Yes, there have been lies in this war, from the media, like the Museum &#039;looting&#039; story early on, and how the whole war was based WMD&#039;s in Iraq, and not the 17 resolutions Saddam violated. How the incidents in Abu Ghraib were the norm and not the exception, and finally a slap in the face of tens of millions of Americans who elected Bush TWICE and the media cast doubt and disparaged it. The President did the right thing, and I believe history will prove it. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_104663">With regardss to war, I am not a pacifist at all.&nbsp; For me, war is strictly a cost/benefit analysis:&nbsp; Will the engagement of war result in the best possible outcome for a nation given the circumstances?&nbsp; Will the benefits of global positioning and access to natural resources outweight the cost of dollars, life, global goodwill and blowback?&nbsp; If the answer is yes, I support war.&nbsp; If not, I am against it.&nbsp; Keep in mind, even if it is beneficial, the CBA of diplomacy, as well as United Nations actions must be entered into calculations, as if they are more beneficial than war, then I am against war.&nbsp; <br /><br />As it stands now, I see the balance of this war decidely in the red.<br /><br />Just as you seem to be a realist in this matter, not giving over to emotion, neither am I.&nbsp; Human right violations on the part of Saddam play no part in my calculations, given that we are active allies with dictatorships who have engaged in human rights violations.<br /><br />I am open to change my mind should I be shown in a logical manner that this war is beneficial to this country.&nbsp; I can appreciate your opening post as a way to bring up the subject matter, but it is not logical nor compelling.&nbsp; So, as Agent Kujan said to Verbal Kint, &quot;Convince me&quot;. <br /><br /></div>

Sadly, I see the usual crackpot theories and nutty websites that are par for the course on the web channeled here too. Still, as someone who came to this country from Europe, and whose relatives were butchered by both Nazis and Commies, I can attest to extremism when I see it. One such extremism is the hatred and sheer lunancy that has gripped many folks against the President. It is not based on reality anymore. The removal of Saddam and the Taliban were not only a needed move, but, it opened a region closed to the outside and bought the fight and current attack of Islamic extremists to their home, after they bought it to ours for decades culminating in 9/11. You may not agree, and I don&#039;t, with some of the early military decsions, but, given the military available after the draconian cuts during the 1990&#039;s, the USA had to act fast after 9/11. The newly discovered &#039;concern&#039; for &#039;human rights&#039;, by those who supported Castro for decades, on what is happeing on Gitmo, Cuba is bad enough, but, to say the Patriot Act and some other MODEST measures, compared to what FDR did in WW 2, makes Bush a &#039;dictator&#039; is ludicrous on the surface. Only slip and fall attorneys and the legal establishment who want to treat this as a &#039;crime&#039; problem could possibly believe it. <br /><br />We live in a world of REAL dictatorships. China, who is flooding our markets for at least 15 years with cheap goods, often dangerous, are builidng up their tech and communist Armed forces. Chavez in Venezuela, Hollywoods buddy after Castro, who has suspended and rewrote the entire constitution and is trying to be President for life, cozying up to Irans leader a holocaust denier who wants Nukes, and was onlt &#039;stopped. albeit temporarily by the&nbsp; removal of Saddam in 2003. We are told the world &#039;hates&#039; us cause of GW. The REALITY is that in Europe, Germany, France, the two heads of the so-called &#039;Anti-War&#039; movement recently elected decidedly Pro-War and Pro-USA leaders. Anyone can now see that the war is turning the tide and the extremists are on the run. The only ones who refuse to see this are people who are tired of war, understandable, and unrepetent Anti-Semites like Pat Buchanan, who have teamed up in an &#039;unholy&#039; alliance of assorted America haters, righties and lefties. In the end, we have no choice, but, to fight this war. Retreat is surrender. My nephew is in Iraq, and I want him home NOW, but, when I send him articles of what is being written and shown from Hollywood/media about his and his fellow soldiers efforts, he is angry and disgusted and tells me how it bears little to reality. Yes, there have been lies in this war, from the media, like the Museum &#039;looting&#039; story early on, and how the whole war was based WMD&#039;s in Iraq, and not the 17 resolutions Saddam violated. How the incidents in Abu Ghraib were the norm and not the exception, and finally a slap in the face of tens of millions of Americans who elected Bush TWICE and the media cast doubt and disparaged it. The President did the right thing, and I believe history will prove it. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ll agree with PulledPork and add that if our government really was in the business of fighting evil dictatorships, then they wouldn&#039;t be quite so cozy with regimes such as those in Saudi Arabia, nor would they have been allied with Saddam for so long before he became an enemy.&nbsp; <br /><br />You can choose to believe or not to believe anything you want, however, I suggest that you take a moment to question some of the things that are happening in the world.&nbsp; Contrary to what you may think, questioning your government isn&#039;t only for the realm of &quot;nutjobs&quot; and &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; but is an integral part of a healthy democracy.&nbsp; Indeed, not questioning the motives of our government and the very real questions raised by their policies creates a society that is more akin to that of a one-party, authoritarian state.</div>

While I don&#039;t think we will &quot;lose&quot; in Iraq, it was the wrong war at the wrong time. That isn&#039;t to say the outcome will be more beneficial, but that&#039;s far from definite. I happen to believe that while the decision to go to war in Iraq won&#039;t be viewed as sound in years to come, the result will be better than we can now anticipate.<br /><br />Afghanistan was an act of self-defense, pure and simple. Even then, we managed to nearly screw it up when everything was in our favor in early 2002.<br /><br />As for the real dictatorships FZ mentioned, I certainly don&#039;t deny they exist. At the same time, I don&#039;t believe the United States has any obligation to the citizens of Venezuela, Sudan, Cuba, North Korea to secure their freedom through regime change. That said, I expect the United States to protect its citizens, and if say, Kim Jong Il was about to send nuclear weapons against American citizens, we must defend ourselves with disproportionate and overwhelming force.<br /><br />Chavez? Screw him. The Venezuelans elected that thug. Let them get rid of him. Or not. Maybe the majority like living in a Third World socialist backwater circa 1962. I know that the middle class has been leaving the country in droves.</div>

You can&#039;t be&nbsp; a&nbsp; &#039;part-time, peace activist.&#039; The UN had entered&nbsp; into&nbsp; the calculations&nbsp; of Saddam&nbsp; Hussein, it&#039;s why were&nbsp; there in first&nbsp; place, the Kuwait&nbsp; invasion and&nbsp; the no fly zone for 12 years. Saddam repeatedly called&nbsp; the &#039;bluff&#039;&nbsp; of the UN and the USA&nbsp; and lost. It was a culmination and&nbsp; fullfillment of the cease fire provision, the first Gulf War never ended. <br /><br />Human rights violations&nbsp; don&#039;t enter&nbsp; in the so-called&nbsp; &#039;Anti-War&#039; side, since they&nbsp; go around&nbsp; carrying pictures of Chairman Mao, and T-shirts&nbsp; of&nbsp; Che&#039;.&nbsp; The fact of the matter&nbsp; you deal with the cards you are dealt, until you can change the dealer. Problem is&nbsp; in that part of the world, with no tradition&nbsp; of any pluralism, only such a&nbsp; move of removal will ever bring any positive&nbsp; change. I agree it looked bad, but, you don&#039;t change&nbsp; place with thousands&nbsp; of years of history overnight, or a few years. <br /><br />I&#039;m not&nbsp; trying to convince&nbsp; anyone that this war,&nbsp; or any war is &#039;beneficial&#039;, but, a neccessity. I don&#039;t want to have the operation doctor to remove&nbsp; the tumor, but, the body will die. You&nbsp; weigh your options, it&#039;s&nbsp; not&nbsp; a&nbsp; world run under the best of&nbsp; choices. </div>

Talk about a recipe&nbsp; for endless&nbsp; war?&nbsp; Truth is Saddam was allied&nbsp; with himself, his armed&nbsp; forces&nbsp; had virtually no US arms, Saddams&nbsp; planes, tanks and&nbsp; weapons&nbsp; were mostly made in China, Soviet&nbsp; Union, and&nbsp; the only &#039;support&#039; he&nbsp; received&nbsp; from us was&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp; bulwark&nbsp; against&nbsp; Iran which had just held&nbsp; hostages&nbsp; in Iran and supported the terror&nbsp; groups&nbsp; worldwide&nbsp; against&nbsp; the USA. We can thank that&nbsp; great&nbsp; &#039;pacifist&#039; President&nbsp; Carter&nbsp; for that&nbsp; fiasco.&nbsp; Saudi&nbsp; Arabia, a country&nbsp; I know a little&nbsp; something about, since&nbsp; I&nbsp; was&nbsp; in ROTC&nbsp; program with the son of one&nbsp; of the board&nbsp; members&nbsp; of ARAMCO in the early&nbsp; 80&#039;s, is the center of&nbsp; Islamic&nbsp; faith. You really want to start&nbsp; a&nbsp; &#039;religious&#039; global war between Islam and&nbsp; Christianity, try starting a war&nbsp; in Mecca, Islam&#039;s holiest&nbsp; site. It&#039;s not just&nbsp; a&nbsp; matter&nbsp; of &#039;cozy.&#039; <br /><br />I question the govt. right here, the democrats and the war opponents are part of the govt, no?&nbsp; I question a press that&nbsp; is not doing it&#039;s&nbsp; job, but, A&nbsp; job&nbsp; on the only powers&nbsp; fighting against&nbsp; pure evil. I question their&nbsp; motives.</div>

While I don&#039;t think we will &quot;lose&quot; in Iraq, it was the wrong war at the wrong time. That isn&#039;t to say the outcome will be more beneficial, but that&#039;s far from definite. I happen to believe that while the decision to go to war in Iraq won&#039;t be viewed as sound in years to come, the result will be better than we can now anticipate.<br /><br />Afghanistan was an act of self-defense, pure and simple. Even then, we managed to nearly screw it up when everything was in our favor in early 2002.<br /><br />As for the real dictatorships FZ mentioned, I certainly don&#039;t deny they exist. At the same time, I don&#039;t believe the United States has any obligation to the citizens of Venezuela, Sudan, Cuba, North Korea to secure their freedom through regime change. That said, I expect the United States to protect its citizens, and if say, Kim Jong Il was about to send nuclear weapons against American citizens, we must defend ourselves with disproportionate and overwhelming force.<br /><br />Chavez? Screw him. The Venezuelans elected that thug. Let them get rid of him. Or not. Maybe the majority like living in a Third World socialist backwater circa 1962. I know that the middle class has been leaving the country in droves.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So, you agree&nbsp; the&nbsp; long range result is not what&nbsp; the press, so-called&nbsp; &#039;free&#039; press, is telling us? See, we agree.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />No, &#039;we&#039; screwed up Afghan, when we abandoned&nbsp; our allies there to the Taliban and Bin Laden moved in setting up the first&nbsp; WTC&nbsp; bombing. If anything, Bush was handed&nbsp; a&nbsp; decimated&nbsp; intelligence&nbsp; agency and half the armed&nbsp; forces&nbsp; Clinton had when he came in and Bush&nbsp; was only in office&nbsp; a few months. <br /><br />Venezuela, Sudan, Cuba, North Korea do not live&nbsp; on&nbsp; another&nbsp; planet, although I wish they did, so they can&nbsp; and do cause tremendous problems&nbsp; for the USA. they are enemies&nbsp; of global freedom, as is&nbsp; China, IMO. we will regret the day we started&nbsp; trading&nbsp; with China, mark my words.&nbsp; These are not passive countries sitting around, they are working day and night to destroy your way of life and mine. We should do everything in our power&nbsp; to stop them and let them know they&nbsp; will get&nbsp; a&nbsp; merciless&nbsp; pouding if they don&#039;t stop. Otherwise they will continue&nbsp; to consolidate and no amount of &#039;peace&#039; signs and&nbsp; che&#039;&nbsp; shirts from the useful&nbsp; idiots&nbsp; wil save us. </div>

I didn&#039;t&nbsp; say&nbsp; it was&nbsp; ALL Carters&nbsp; and Clintons&nbsp; &#039;fault&#039;, but, things&nbsp; didn&#039;t&nbsp; just suddenly happen&nbsp; when Bush became President. Bush is supporting the only man&nbsp; who was trying&nbsp; to&nbsp; stop the islamicists&nbsp; from taking over when Pakistan&nbsp; has nukes. He&nbsp; is already&nbsp; &nbsp;going to have to elections, which is more&nbsp; than&nbsp; Chinathe Former&nbsp; Soviet&nbsp; Union, Cuba or any of the workers&nbsp; &#039;paradise&#039; places&nbsp; that have been supported&nbsp; at every so-called&nbsp; &#039;Peace&#039; rally&nbsp; since&nbsp; I&#039;ve been alive. There is&nbsp; no &#039;Peace&#039; movement, it&#039;s&nbsp; a pro-war&nbsp; movement&nbsp; &nbsp;proping up dictatorships&nbsp; for&nbsp; decades. So, let&#039;s&nbsp; get that myth of a&nbsp; &#039;peace&#039; movement out of the way.<br /><br />I explained&nbsp; why Bush&nbsp; took out Iraq, and you gave me&nbsp; a list of useless&nbsp; internet faux information. BTW, His&nbsp; &#039;Daddy&#039; happened&nbsp; to be the President&nbsp; of the USA. But, all this doesn&#039;t matter, the mantra&nbsp; of Haliburton,&nbsp; a company used for decades&nbsp; supporting the troops, as some sinster&nbsp; corpration that just suddenly appeared run by Cheney&nbsp; is ridiculous and wrong.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know&nbsp; how many &#039;corrupt&#039; officials&nbsp; have left, but, they have left. Yes, the constant baseless accusations by the Left and attacks using the Press is very Soviet, thanks for pointing it out. I mean you are bound to get&nbsp; someone if you keep accusing.<br /><br />Diminishing separation of Church and State?&nbsp; You mean the state diminishing the Church, only if it&#039;s&nbsp; &#039;Christian.&#039; Anything else&nbsp; is AOK, it&#039;s&nbsp; &#039;diversity&#039; and if you complain you will be branded&nbsp; a fascist and a racist.&nbsp; The Press&nbsp; has become&nbsp; very Soviet, no doubt about it.<br /><br />The Press in the so-called&nbsp; &#039;Free&#039; West is&nbsp; a horror. It&#039;s run by so-called &#039;idependent&#039; Journalists&nbsp; from cookie-cutter leftist&nbsp; indoctrinated&nbsp; Univerisities. The few that slip through are denounced&nbsp; as Fascists and Warmongers, like FOX&nbsp; news, which is hardly&nbsp; &#039;right-wing.&#039; You can deny and throw out as many accusations as you want, but, there are tens of millions&nbsp; like me seething below&nbsp; the surface&nbsp; at the control of our&nbsp; culture and destruction of our&nbsp; traditions by a&nbsp; relatively small &#039;mob&#039; in the Northeastern states&nbsp; and LA. </div>

Let&#039;s&nbsp; not get started on nepotism and Hollywood, and how they keep turning out&nbsp; movies&nbsp; that no one&nbsp; goes to about this war&nbsp; cause&nbsp; tinsel town wants&nbsp; to show&nbsp; how &#039;commited&#039; they are&nbsp; by showing us how &#039;we&#039;&nbsp; are wrong. They make billions&nbsp; in Hollywood&nbsp; really doing nothing, glorified&nbsp; court jesters who at one time&nbsp; did at least&nbsp; care about the nation they live in and didn&#039;t&nbsp; fly around the world&nbsp; hugging it&#039;s enemies. Let&#039;s&nbsp; not go further on the arts&nbsp; and media&nbsp; class because&nbsp; they house&nbsp; some of the worst&nbsp; beings on this planet. A lot of crazed&nbsp; dictators came from being poor, it&#039;s&nbsp; not a&nbsp; virtue, it&#039;s a circumstance. No one&nbsp; chooses&nbsp; to be poor.<br /><br />Yeah, Ronald&nbsp; Reagan did come&nbsp; from a&nbsp; time&nbsp; when movies&nbsp; were at war&nbsp; with the enemy, not at war with the nation that feeds them. Thompson is also from a&nbsp; different&nbsp; time. But, these&nbsp; are far and few&nbsp; between and they garner&nbsp; no support&nbsp; from Hollywood.<br /><br />Yes, good&nbsp; and evil&nbsp; are relative I am told, but, those&nbsp; same people&nbsp; who use that line&nbsp; see&nbsp; me and Bush, Cheney&nbsp; as &#039;evil&#039; and&nbsp; everyone&nbsp; else&nbsp; as misunderstood, victims , who if we were just &#039;nice&#039; to them they wouldn&#039;t behead&nbsp; us or fly planes&nbsp; into buildings. C&#039;mon, let&#039;s&nbsp; face it, we live&nbsp; on a planet&nbsp; where&nbsp; 3/4&nbsp; of the beings&nbsp; barely walk erect&nbsp; and&nbsp; the rest of them are the squabbling classes&nbsp; who think they can fix&nbsp; it by denouncing&nbsp; the other&nbsp; guy. The Euros&nbsp; are finally&nbsp; &#039;paying back&#039;&nbsp; the USA&nbsp; for being a&nbsp; Sap for&nbsp; 50 years and they are&nbsp; beating us up economically and they&nbsp; supported&nbsp; the Dictator&nbsp; we tried&nbsp; to overthrow to keep getting his Oil. Lets&#039;&nbsp; not forget our &#039;allies&#039;&nbsp; who&nbsp; after 9/11&nbsp; shed&nbsp; a&nbsp; tear while applauding and cheering that&nbsp; Uncle Sap&nbsp; was finally knocked from his pearch, now it&#039;s their&nbsp; turn, but, the Islamicists&nbsp; are going to give&nbsp; them a run for&nbsp; their money, lives and whats&nbsp; left of Euro-Tradition. But, it&#039;s&nbsp; all Bush&#039;s fault, if he only&nbsp; left Saddam alone, went into Afghan so Saddam and others&nbsp; could be freed up to support groups&nbsp; there, we would&nbsp; be in Afghan with a Strong Saddam and neither Khadafy or that imp in Iran would have stopped&nbsp; anything.&nbsp; <br /><br />Still, there&nbsp; is hope. When Bush leaves, Iran can restart their&nbsp; Nukes&nbsp; and we will have peace and justice again. Gitmo prisoners&nbsp; will be released, no more&nbsp; war, the birds are singing and the skys&nbsp; are clear.Then we&nbsp; really will get what we deserve in the West. I just hope I am far away&nbsp; from this&nbsp; wretched&nbsp; city known as&nbsp; NY, that I used&nbsp; to love, cause&nbsp; they are going to be first since&nbsp; they have&nbsp; been in the forefront of this disasterous misnamed &#039;Peace&#039; movement. They&#039;ll get &#039;Peace&#039;, the &#039;peace&#039; of the grave. <br /><br />Yes, we will be rid&nbsp; of&nbsp; the &#039;evil&#039; Bush and Cheney, we&#039;ll all get a prize from Osama, Al Qeada. We&#039;ll deserve it. </div>

You can&#039;t be&nbsp; a&nbsp; &#039;part-time, peace activist.&#039; The UN had entered&nbsp; into&nbsp; the calculations&nbsp; of Saddam&nbsp; Hussein, it&#039;s why were&nbsp; there in first&nbsp; place, the Kuwait&nbsp; invasion and&nbsp; the no fly zone for 12 years. Saddam repeatedly called&nbsp; the &#039;bluff&#039;&nbsp; of the UN and the USA&nbsp; and lost. It was a culmination and&nbsp; fullfillment of the cease fire provision, the first Gulf War never ended.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And I&#039;m guessing that you&#039;re lumping everyone who disagrees with the Bush administration and this nation&#039;s foreign policy as a &quot;pacifist.&quot;&nbsp; You&#039;re either for *all* war, or none at all.&nbsp; No middle ground.&nbsp; Do you realize how extreme and off-base *your* argument is?<br /><br />And you still haven&#039;t answered my question as to why the government, if it wants to rid the world of dictators as you mentioned in your first post, isn&#039;t doing anything about Saudi Arabia or Pakistan or Sudan.&nbsp; Perhaps it might have something to do with money and oil and other such concerns.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Human rights violations&nbsp; don&#039;t enter&nbsp; in the so-called&nbsp; &#039;Anti-War&#039; side, since they&nbsp; go around&nbsp; carrying pictures of Chairman Mao, and T-shirts&nbsp; of&nbsp; Che&#039;.&nbsp; The fact of the matter&nbsp; you deal with the cards you are dealt, until you can change the dealer. Problem is&nbsp; in that part of the world, with no tradition&nbsp; of any pluralism, only such a&nbsp; move of removal will ever bring any positive&nbsp; change. I agree it looked bad, but, you don&#039;t change&nbsp; place with thousands&nbsp; of years of history overnight, or a few years. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Again, your arithmetic is ridiculously simplistic.&nbsp; This seems to be your world view:<br /><br />Against Bush = Liberal<br />Against war in Iraq = Pacifist<br />Against Bush = Against war in Iraq<br />Liberal = Pacifist<br /><br />So by conveniently lumping everyone into the same &quot;you&#039;re either with us or against us&quot; category perfected by the Bush administration, you can easily stereotype everyone who even slightly disagrees with the policies of this administration and dismiss their beliefs, because of your perceived belief that all these liberal &quot;pacifists&quot; go around idolizing Mao and Che and are enemies of the state.&nbsp; To me, it sounds like a little bit of dictatorship rubbed off on you from wherever you came from, because this line of thinking is ridiculously close-minded and dangerous.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh, and if the Bush administration is so concerned about human rights violations around the globe, where are they regarding Sudan and Darfur?&nbsp; Or on well-documented human rights violations committed by all sorts of American &quot;allies&quot; and/or business partners such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Turkey, China and so on?<br /><br />Finally, you mention playing with the cards you are dealt.&nbsp; Using that analogy, it seems to me that the United States was the dealer in many of those hands, since we propped up regimes like Saddam&#039;s for many years (and still support many vicious regimes around the world...look no further than Pakistan with &quot;President&quot; Musharraf) and turned a blind eye when he gassed the Kurds in his own country.&nbsp; It&#039;s only when he started misbehaving according to our rules that the tables turned.</div>

See, we agree.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />No, &#039;we&#039; screwed up Afghan, when we abandoned&nbsp; our allies there to the Taliban and Bin Laden moved in setting up the first&nbsp; WTC&nbsp; bombing. If anything, Bush was handed&nbsp; a&nbsp; decimated&nbsp; intelligence&nbsp; agency and half the armed&nbsp; forces&nbsp; Clinton had when he came in and Bush&nbsp; was only in office&nbsp; a few months.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I hate to break this to you, but the Taliban and Bin Laden actually *were* our allies there in Afghanistan for many years.&nbsp; Don&#039;t believe me?&nbsp; Look up the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.&nbsp; At the time, Bin Laden &amp; co. were our trusted &quot;allies&quot; against the Soviet menace.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Venezuela, Sudan, Cuba, North Korea do not live&nbsp; on&nbsp; another&nbsp; planet, although I wish they did, so they can&nbsp; and do cause tremendous problems&nbsp; for the USA. they are enemies&nbsp; of global freedom, as is&nbsp; China, IMO. we will regret the day we started&nbsp; trading&nbsp; with China, mark my words.&nbsp; These are not passive countries sitting around, they are working day and night to destroy your way of life and mine. We should do everything in our power&nbsp; to stop them and let them know they&nbsp; will get&nbsp; a&nbsp; merciless&nbsp; pouding if they don&#039;t stop. Otherwise they will continue&nbsp; to consolidate and no amount of &#039;peace&#039; signs and&nbsp; che&#039;&nbsp; shirts from the useful&nbsp; idiots&nbsp; wil save us. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Other than spouting rhetoric against the Bush administration, just how does Venezuela cause tremendous problems for the USA?&nbsp; Last I checked, we still buy plenty of our oil from there and do business with Venezuela, despite the friction.&nbsp; And what sort of problems does Cuba pose to us, especially now in the post-Soviet era?&nbsp; And if China is an enemy of global freedom, why do we do business with them?&nbsp; I thought you said that our government fights dictatorships like Saddam Hussein&#039;s.&nbsp; I must be missing something here!&nbsp; :-D<br /><br />North Korea has discontinued its nuclear weapons program and will be letting inspectors in to oversee the dismantling of their nuclear reactors.&nbsp; They have also opened up access to South Korean businesses and freight trains and even tourism from the south.&nbsp; Of course, things can change in an instant, but I don&#039;t see how, at this moment, North Korea is &quot;threatening&quot; our way of life either.&nbsp; <br /><br />Merciless pounding?&nbsp; The same successful merciless pounding we&#039;ve inflicted on Iraq?&nbsp; You&#039;re right, it was merciless and certainly was a pounding, but certainly not in the way you&#039;ve described, as the thousands of dead and permanently disabled American troops and continued conflict, over four years after &quot;mission accomplished&quot; will attest.<br /><br />I love all this talk about &quot;destroying&quot; our way of life.&nbsp; Why don&#039;t they also go and destroy Canada or Finland or Sweden or Holland or France while they&#039;re at it?&nbsp; After all, those countries, as well as some others, rank ahead of the United States in the Human Development Index (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index</a>).&nbsp; And if a study released by the UN isn&#039;t very palatable to you, which is usually the case with those on the right, perhaps you might be further convinced by the Economist&#039;s own rankings, in which the U.S. ranks behind even more countries in quality of life.&nbsp; The Economist isn&#039;t exactly known for its radical leftist politics.&nbsp; (<a href="http://www.idaireland.com/uploads/documents/External_Publications/BestCountry_2.pdf" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.idaireland.com/uploads/documents/External_Publications/BestCountry_2.pdf</a>).&nbsp; Seems to me that if they hate our &quot;way of life&quot; so much, they should go after some of those other countries that are also &quot;evil&quot; western democracies that statistically have an even better quality of life than we do.</div>
