				Any good Dry Cleaners around? <br /><br /><br />To me, the variables are quality of the dry cleaning itself, price, and time to complete (in that order). <br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve been using Super Joe&#039;s on 30th Ave and 46th Street. They get the job done at a fair price and offer a little discount if you pay up front. <br /><br /><br />I tried Lost Sock&#039;s dry cleaning service, but whichever company they use staples the tags to the shirt itself...literally damaging the shirt. How do they think that&#039;s ok? Super Joe&#039;s place feeds the tag through the button hole. <br /><br /><br />The best ever was Jonel on 36th Ave between 29th and 30th Streets, but they closed down like two years ago I think.

				I highly recommend Minerva on Broadway between 29th and 30th St.&nbsp; Very efficient, good job cleaning, and reasonable prices.

				Do you pay for a laundered shirt even if a small (but noticeable &#039;cause the shirt is white) stain of unknown origin doesn&#039;t come out?<br /><br />My ex-dry cleaner on 23rd Ave insisted that one does and charged my bf. <br /><br />I had just quite smoking (again) or something so when I heard how he was charged $3.50 (this was for 2-day service) I decided that before I contact the local media outlets to shame the cleaners into returning the $3.50, I&#039;d go down there myself and try to get it back. I was not going to let this injustice go... <br /><br />An argument ensued. There was a lot of yelling. Something about needing more time for &quot;tough stains&quot;. I countered with, &quot;don&#039;t take my money&nbsp; to clean a shirt in 2-days if you think the stains are too tough to get out in 2-days&quot;. <br /><br />This went on for a little while. Longer than I had anticipated for sure. We weren&#039;t new to this place. The guy behind the counter recognized us enough to know who was who when we picked up our dry-cleaning, even if it was in the others name. So I never imagined he&#039;d argue with me over $3.50. Plus I thought I was right, so I wasn&#039;t going to back down either.<br /><br />Finally, another customer walked in. Yelling continued for a few more seconds until the guy behind the counter just gave me back $3.50 and I casually walked out vowing never to return again. <br /><br />When I got home I scrubbed out the stain with a toothbrush and some Zout. <br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;ve used Minerva for about 15 years. I&#039;ve been pleased with the service and their prices/hours are good.<br />You sometimes have to remind them for certain things though. I like my trousers creased and always have<br />to remind them of that. They also take 10% off your total if you pay cash in advance; 15% off leather items.<br /><br />

				Do any of those places do suede or do I have to go a specialized shop? I got some pen marks on a rad, but deeply discounted coat I&#039;ve had for years.

				I&#039;ve used World Cleaners on Broadway and City Cleaners also on Broadway.&nbsp; Both have been reliable.&nbsp; City Cleaners has a nicer owner and is a block closer, so it&#039;s my main go-to place, though World Cleaners does better alterations and repairs.
