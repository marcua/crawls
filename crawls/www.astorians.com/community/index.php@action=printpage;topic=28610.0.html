				This morning I saw that Don Coqui will be opening in the space where Ditmars Station used to be.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if this will be another location for them or if they are moving.&nbsp; I think they will do very good business in this area.&nbsp; I know the other location has dancing.&nbsp; I wonder if this will be the same.&nbsp; They already have a A rating in the window.&nbsp; I dont&#039; see how this is possible since they didn&#039;t open yet.

				I read that article and it seems that people aren&#039;t happy about them moving to Ditmars.&nbsp; They don&#039;t like the club atmosphere and the people that it attracts.&nbsp; Well let&#039;s see what happens.&nbsp; I remember people were saying bad things about Sweet Spot before it opened and how it would attract a bad crowd.&nbsp; Well I dont&#039; think that happened.&nbsp; I just dont see how they will have room for dancing at this location

				I wonder if this is the real Don Coqui from Westchester or the imposter on Newtown Rd??<br />In any case I think that&#039;s going to be horrible for pedestrians and drivers. Parking/traffic already blows there and this is just going to make it worse if it&#039;s a nightclub.

				My guess is that the restaurant is moving but not the lounge - there&#039;s just no room for a lounge/club and restaurant in that space. Also - I wouldn&#039;t discount what people who live nearby say about the current Don Coqui and its clientele. Those who live by them know better than we do and I&#039;m not about to second guess them. But yes, I don&#039;t think that the same vibe will be at the Ditmars location, but as you say, we&#039;ll see.

The food isn&#039;t outstanding but it&#039;s good and a nice change of pace from other local options.

				So we can all put away our torches and pitchforks.&nbsp; It looks like the folks who operate the &quot;original&quot; (to Astoria, anyway) Don Coqui were at one point affiliated with the owner of this new restaurant, but no longer.&nbsp; Apparently, the owner of this soon to open restaurant has already sued the owner of the club-like Don Coqui on Newtown Avenue to stop them from using the name.<br /><br /><br />http://astoriapost.com/don-conqui-fighting-to-save-its-name-as-newcomer-opens-and-says-the-name-belongs-to-him/<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I hope Don Coqui closes or moves to Ditmars.&nbsp; This &quot;club&quot; has no business in a resdidential area like Newtown. The parking is a nightmare already and the valets jsut make it worse by double or triple parking on Newtown and 31st. The drunks pour out of this place at 2 and 3 am screaming and fighting.&nbsp; They walk along Newtown and 30th street pissing on people&#039;s homes or throwing up.&nbsp;

				Yeah, living under the train isn&#039;t exactly quiet without Don Coqui. But I avoid that area because it&#039;s a total shitshow. You can&#039;t navigate the sidewalks drive through (much less park) or venture near without some sort of issue. Thankfully, I have little reason to go that way...it is fairly separated from the busier 30th Ave. <br /><br /><br />But it sounds like they are there to stay, but will just need to maybe change their name?
