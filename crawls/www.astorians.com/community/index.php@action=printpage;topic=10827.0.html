				Title: <strong>Open Discussion of Board Rules and Policy</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>merm</strong> on <strong>June 12, 2008, 04:10:37 PM</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				Recently there&#039;s been an increased interest on the boards for discussion of the rules (http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=8222), and the enforcement of the rules that guide this site. As this community grows and changes I recognize that the rules that guide both member and moderator activities need to evolve and change. If you&#039;re a member of this site, please take a moment to provide feedback and ideas as to the quality of the rules we currently have, and help us make them better if there are areas that are non-representative of the community, or are problematic.<br /><br />In order to facilitate as efficient and constructive a conversation as possible, I&#039;d like to set two expectations for this thread:<br /><br />First, I&#039;ve broken out each of the individual rules below. Please provide feedback on the rules that are important to you or need changing. For example, you could suggest that a rule is &quot;too lax&quot; or &quot;too strict&quot; or &quot;about right&quot; or &quot;should be removed entirely&quot;. Any general comments you have about the rules, or links to other online communities that have done a good job at writing rules would add greatly to the discussion. Please be as specific as you can, and use examples if possible. If you feel a new rule is needed, please suggest it (and if possible suggest how it might be written).<br /><br />Second, please do not use this thread to discuss the <em>enforcement</em> of the rules, or specific users or suspensions. There are several active threads that already are serving this purpose, please post in one of those - or as an alternative start a new thread to discuss any specific concerns about enforcement you have. Please focus on the rules themselves and how they can be as clear and representative as possible for both members and moderators to understand and actualize.<br /><br />A couple things to keep in mind:<br />- The rules are the set of guidelines that moderators attempt to use when performing moderation activities. They need to be clear enough to accomplish their purpose, while not being overly complex and difficult to understand.<br />- The rules should represent the kind of conversation you want to see on Astorians. Keep in mind that overly strict guidelines will make for a more streamlined conversation on limited topics, but at a cost of speech diversity. While unrestricted speech will allow for speech diversity, but at the cost of giving voice to the extremes (hatred, spam etc).<br />- I&#039;m going to focus first on the areas of the rules that generate the most discussion, and move to areas of the rules that appear to have more broad agreement.<br />- It&#039;s my intention to have the discussion span a period of about a week, after which time we&#039;ll try and implement any necessary changes that come out of the discussion.<br /><br />Thank you in advance for being a member of Astorians, and more specifically for helping us make the site a representative voice within the community.<br /><br />Too strict?

The next section is considered the &quot;General Guidelines&quot; and is more a philosophical guideline that has served to represent the guiding philosophy of the site. I&#039;ll quote it in it&#039;s entirety and encourage feedback on this section as well.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">General Board Guidelines:<br /><br />- This board is an open community site. Anyone and everyone is welcome here as long as you obey the rules. No member of this board speaks for all the other members. Everyone is equal, there are no cliques. To our best ability the rules are applied equally - please let us know if you&#039;ve been treated unfairly by sending a personal message to a moderator.<br /><br />- This isn&#039;t a random internet site. Given the nature of this online community having real world connections to a real community (Astoria &amp; LIC) it&#039;s important to keep in mind that what happens here is not limited to the void of the internet. What you say, and how you behave here has an impact on your real community that you live in. Please treat others with the same neighborly respect you would like to receive from one of your neighbors. This isn&#039;t just a random internet site with people you&#039;ll never meet.<br /><br />- This is not a &quot;bulletin board&quot; like the kind you see at your local grocery store, it is a community discussion and conversation board. There is a bias on the board towards &quot;discussion&quot; and less interest in &quot;classifieds&quot; and &quot;advertisements&quot;. If you have a classified or advertisement to post it&#039;s no problem, just please do it in the business or trade categories, or post on craigslist. Spamming will not be tolerated.<br /><br />With that in mind, here are some things to consider when posting:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Write about posts, arguments, and positions, not members.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Avoid generalizations about and dismissive names for groups of people.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * If you’ve got data, evidence, or proof, provide it and a source. If you don’t, recognize that you’re arguing from experience, anecdote, and a limited perspective.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Ask other members questions, particularly if you disagree. That’s a good way to avoid the sorts of erroneous assumptions that are otherwise inevitable in on-line communication.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Think about pronouns: “I” is generally good, “we” is tricky, and “you” is almost always a bad idea, as it implicates members and not their ideas.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Recognize that you’re unlikely to prove someone’s beliefs are wrong, but that a respectful explanation of why you disagree might help them understand your position.<br /><br /><br />Basically, please try and keep in mind that this is a public conversation and dialog just like you might have in a local cafe or bar. You might feel insulated from other people on this board because it&#039;s an electronic conversation but try and keep in mind that unlike most random internet sites, you probably live next door to the people you interact with on this board. The way you treat others here has a direct impact on the &quot;Astoria Karma&quot; you experience on the street. As you engage people please keep this in mind.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thank you again in advance for helping improve the site. Your constructive feedback is greatly appreciated.

Saying &quot;No ad hominems&quot; is okay, but that&#039;s not what the rule is.<br /><br />The post that got me suspended, while mean and not particularly nice, was not an ad hominem. Neither is the post that got MacMomma suspended. Were they plesant? No. But they weren&#039;t ad hominems.<br /><br />The problem with this is the idea of &quot;don&#039;t make it personal&quot;. This entire site is inheritently personal because it is about a neighborhood and the community. People don&#039;t talk about motorcycles in a general sense and how they fit into the neighborhood--they talk about how motorcycles bother them, in their apartments, in their experiences. Any conversation about the &#039;hood is going to be personal and disagreeing with someone&#039;s stance is also going to be personal.<br /><br />The difference between having personal&nbsp; things in an argument and an ad hominem position are many and large. An ad hominem is name-calling, baiting and the like. Personal retorts based on information provided in a thread by the other person, or questioning another person&#039;s motives are not ad hominems.<br /><br />Also, this is the rule that seems to be enforced with the most varying degrees of severity. Why people who suggested that pink_floyd obviously hated Oleput because they decided he owned some other business didn&#039;t get suspended is beyond me. That&#039;s obviously a personal attack not based on the merits. <br /><br />I guess the problem is that it seems like because of the &quot;report to moderator&quot; button, if the majority of the people are on one side of the discussion and you are on the other you are much more likely to get reported and suspended, regardless of how often others are nasty to people who are not in the majority.

				I feel that for this poll to be fair that it should be extended so that those that are currently in &quot;time out&quot; have a chance to cast their votes as well, after all, they are also part of this community and some of them for quite some time, their votes should also count.

				That&#039;s one of the ones that are confusing......<br /><br />So basically if that were the case, on this topic, technically all we should be doing is the poll and giving a positive or negative nod and post no comments or not quote because then technically we&#039;re bumping this thread?

				Here is what bumping is: &quot;To bump a thread on an Internet forum is to post a reply to it <strong>purely in order to raise the thread&#039;s profile.</strong>&quot; Source: Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bump_(Internet))<br /><br />Also of interest, &quot;Users may get around that by posting what is ostensibly a genuine reply.&quot;<br /><br />If it&#039;s clear that the reason for your posting to a thread is <em>simply</em> to force the thread to the top of the list this would be considered bumping and is considered bad forum etiquette across many mid to large size internet forums (see Wikipedia article above for more on this topic).<br /><br />Likewise, it&#039;s considered bad forum etiquette to simply reply with &quot;yes&quot; to comment. The reason for this is because when people come back to the site to check &quot;unread messages&quot; it&#039;s inefficient and annoying to see a new post and have it only say &quot;yes&quot;. It&#039;s seen as a disservice to other readers.<br /><br />Actually, this video is a good summarization of some of the main points of Forum Etiquette (http://www.videojug.com/film/how-to-behave-on-an-internet-forum) held widely across the internet. Additionally, a quick search of Google for &#039;forum eqituette&#039; and &#039;forum rules&#039; you&#039;ll find many examples of sites with varying policies - however, there are some basics that you&#039;ll find on most forums, such as duplicate posting, bumping, spamming, trolling etc.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying we have to be like the other forums mind you as I&#039;m very open to changing or adjusting the rules as needed.

				Thanks Starwind, but personally I couldn&#039;t give a s___ if I get neg nodded or not. and obviously looking at it now, it seems that not many agree with me, and those that do, voice their opinion OPENLY, as is their right.

				I&#039;ve always taken the rules to be a way to insure that a level of civility is maintained. <br /><br />I once belonged to a political community on AOL that was based on being Senators in a Simulation game that used message boards. We had a monitor that would hide posts that got out of hand. <br /><br />During my time there ( I basically ran the official part of the game as Senate Clerk for a year) I began a practice of responding to a post by calling them every name in the book and telling them to do things to themselves that are anatomically impossible. and then I would cancel the post. <br /><br />It made me feel better and preserved my good name. <br /><br />To me moderating is an artform in, well, moderation. At what point to you pull a post etc? And for those who&#039;ve had a post pulled, it can feel arbitrary. Which, in a way, makes sense. Because it is based on an open ended set of guidelines. <br /><br />So do the rules need to be changed? Probably not. Because, no matter what, there will be moments when things get heated and a bit out of control. And there will be those that feel their rights were violated. It&#039;s the nature of the beast. <br /><br />The one thing I would hate to see is a forum such as this with no rules. At that point it becomes chaotic and not worth being a part of.<br /><br />

I wouldn&#039;t have a problem with things like obvious trolling and generally illegal activities being against the rules. It bugs me when people who are obviously flame-baiting get off scot-free while the people who get openly pissed off at them get suspended. And, if arguments are getting too heated and people are starting to insult each other rather than debate, I have no problem with a moderator coming in and telling people to cool it, and if they don&#039;t cool it the thread could be locked. I do have a problem with people getting suspended without any sort of open warning to calm down, especially people who have been here for a long time and have proven themselves to not be trolls. Suspending a longtime regular who has made valuable contributions to this forum just for calling someone an asshole seems like an unnecessary slap in the face. The post should&#039;ve just been deleted, if anything. <br /><br />As for name-calling, I try to avoid that myself since I don&#039;t think it strengthens an argument, but if people want to do it I can handle myself in these situations.

And so I changed our route one day and, with camera, ran down to that area. And had a blast. Tucked into this very industrial area was a piece of Astoria history.

				Things that I think we might want to talk about in terms of helping out with revamping the rules (if we do so at all).<br /><br />1.

				I think it might be a good idea to allow suspended people to send personal messages. They can contact people on the site without being forced to give out otherwise hidden information (their emails if they chose not to share); they can still contact board moderators; plus, anyone who doesn&#039;t want PM from someone can block them.

				Thank you for the opportunity to join in and make comments on the rules.<br /><br />Quote<br />- Act appropriately: We do not permit comments that we deem abusive, baiting, defamatory, insulting, harassing, inflammatory, hateful, obscene, inappropriately rude or personal, retaliatory, threatening, invasive of privacy or violative of any law.<br /><br />I think this rule covers much and make some obsolete.&nbsp; In particular the two rules about name calling and ad hominem / personal attacks.&nbsp; The rules should be reduced and simplified as much as possible.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Since these rules are created by people, enforced by Mods and not computers, there will always be personal interpretation when mods judge a ruling.&nbsp; If the rules are simple and clear then all understand them. Any final ruling comes from the mod&#039;s personal influence. That can always be addressed or fought on an individual basis.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would rather see no rules concerning appropriate behavior because it will ultimately restrict discussion and flow of ideas.&nbsp; The mods can always lock to thread or step in with a comment.&nbsp; But since that will not happen, we should consider minimal rules and hope that the mods in charge will be fair and consider the meanings behind peoples actions. Flaming and provoking OR responding rudely both have meaning and deserve consideration.&nbsp; <br /><br />We all want an open forum to discuss anything and of course any social civilized group will have some structure in place.&nbsp; But clearly things have gotten out of hand.&nbsp; The fix could be a few things:<br /><br />Those in charge need to delegate more and bring on more mod&#039;s to relieve stress from mod burn out.<br /><br />Perhaps Astorians has passed critical mass and there is more going on than one or a few can handle.&nbsp; Maybe if more were involved then things might not have gone out of hand (not meant as an insult to anyone).<br /><br />Realize that all things eventually find balance and things will take care of themselves.&nbsp; (A reason for less rules.)<br /><br />Astorians might consider going in more of a community board direction that embraces &quot;goings on&quot; in Astoria and excluding &quot;debate and discussion&quot; topics since this is where most of the troubles come from (under the current rules and vision of the founder).&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I think that under current conditions the last suggestion might work best for this board.&nbsp; That said, Astorians has been a boon to the community in terms or bring people together (new friends, dating, marriage) and opening up what Astoria has to offer to many people who before joining new very little about the treasures available to us here.&nbsp; THis is a big bump in the road so lets hope we resolve this in a positive fashion and things improve because of it.

				I agree with most everyones ideas here and thank you for opening a thread for this discussion<br /><br />Number of suspensions.&nbsp; I think there is a big difference between someone who has been suspended multiple times - say 3x in a couple of weeks - vs the person who has 3 suspensions over the course of a year. I think that if you are going to build the length of the suspension with accumulation - you have to take time span of incidents into account.&nbsp; Maybe something like after x months the slate is wiped clean. <br /><br />nods - generally I&#039;m in favor - but over the last few days there&#039;s definitely been an &quot;us - vs - them&quot; mentality going on - where anyone seen as having any criticism of this board is getting slammed with neg nods.&nbsp; It seems a bit out of hand - but maybe it will die down after a while.&nbsp; &nbsp;I vote to keep the nods. <br /><br />mods - definitely can use some more if they&#039;re going to be used rather than relying on users &quot;report to mod.&quot;&nbsp; Report to mod is too much like &quot;tattling&quot; for my taste.&nbsp; If there is something that is obviously out of hand - it won&#039;t go unnoticed.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=10827.msg134209#msg134209">Quote from: Starwind51 on June 17, 2008, 06:26:01 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />I think a person should only be banned for:<br /><br />Posting a business announcement in the guise of a normal post or spamming <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think this is a bad idea because as we have seen recently - it&#039;s not always obvious who is posting for their own business and who is just a supporter of a business. <br /><br />Bumping a thread should not be reason for suspension - I think bumping happens all the time and it is not generally looked at as anything other than harmless.&nbsp; If bumping IS suspendable... then you have to also include responses like &quot;I agree&quot; or other short responses that don&#039;t actually add to the conversation.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think anyone should be in the position to make calls on this.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Okay, I know that maybe this might seem excessive, but have you guys ever thought of having moderators for different sections of the board?<br /><br />I know other sites that I&#039;ve been on often say in the description of each part of the board who the moderator is for that section. It would allow people to directly contact the moderator if they had questions or suspension problems. <br /><br />I guess I&#039;m kinda suggesting more moderators. Have one person do Politics (since it&#039;s the pain in the ass) and divide the rest of the board up to a few people. It would give the mods more time to actually read the posts, allow different parts of the board with different kinds of discussion to have a more organic moderation.

				Bentley&#039;s Dad, when Mirriam-Webster gets around to adding &quot;bump&quot; in this context, it&#039;s going to mean exactly what these user-created dictionaries already say it means. Which is to reply in a thread just to bring it to the top of a forum, without adding any new content to it. Whether or not that&#039;s an internet crime is up to merm.<br /><br />Can most of us agree that the problem here isn&#039;t so much the rules themselves, but how they are enforced? To me the moderating is just done with too heavy a hand, which stems from the moderators feeling too overwhelmed to deal with issues in a more careful manner.

				megc, I could be wrong, but I don&#039;t think people are annoyed just because they&#039;re not allowed to call people jerks or whatnot. The annoyance seems to come in that doing so gets them tossed off the board for a week or more, when it should really just cause for a warning or post deletion. On every other forum I&#039;ve been a member of, when things get too heated a moderator will just step in, perhaps delete or edit the offending posts depending on the circumstances, and tell people to cool it. People only get suspended or banned if they&#039;ve really proven themselves to be trolls, or if they refuse to act civil despite repeated warnings. A suspension is not a warning; it&#039;s a punishment, and this is what I think is really bothering people.

				Nods- I hate the nods. I think it&#039;s a petty component to a discussion board. It colors the tone of the post into black and white rather than an actual follow-up post that explains one&#039;s satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the above statement.

My suggestion is that official efforts of the board be more community based.

				The Rules: “<em>no name calling</em>” -&nbsp; I don’t think you should be allowed to call anyone an ass or tell them they’re stupid just because you don’t agree with them.&nbsp; If you do call someone an offensive name, you should get a warning via a PM and the post should be deleted. with an explanation as to why it&#039;s being deleted posted in the thread.&nbsp; Re: suspensions:&nbsp; Maybe three warnings = suspension for a clearly specified time. Whatever it is, I think it should clearly be written in The Rules regarding cause and effect because it is not there now.&nbsp; And that seems to be a big part of the problem.<br /><br />“no ad hominems”&nbsp; -&nbsp; This is a bit tricky because many arguments do fall into this category.&nbsp; &nbsp;For people like handyman (who said he was too lazy to look it up) this is an example:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Person A makes claim X.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Person B makes an attack on person A.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore A&#039;s claim is false.<br />The reason why an Ad Hominem (of any kind) is a fallacy is that the character, circumstances, or actions of a person do not (in most cases) have a bearing on the truth or falsity of the claim being made (or the quality of the argument being made).<br /><br />Example of Ad Hominem:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bob: &quot;I believe that we need rules. Rules are good for these reasons: _______________ (fill in the blank).&quot; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ken: &quot;Of course you would say that, you&#039;re one of the Mods.&quot;  <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bob: &quot;Never mind about me, what about the reasons I gave to support my position?&quot; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ken: &quot;Those don&#039;t count. Like I said, you&#039;re a Mod and you don’t like to argue, so you would say that rules are okay. Further, you are just an ass kissing sheep, so I can&#039;t believe what you say.&quot;<br /><br />Again, I think a person should receive a warning via a PM, the post deleted with a post stating why, and after so many warnings a suspension is in order.&nbsp; <br /><br />The next section is&nbsp; “<em>Avoid repetition and duplicate posting</em>&quot;:&nbsp; When people forget this a mod should post in the thread telling them not to do this.&nbsp; &nbsp;“<em>This includes &quot;quoting&quot; an earlier message for the sole purpose of bumping the thread or expressing agreement. Please use the &quot;nod&quot; feature instead</em>.”&nbsp; Dislike the nods.&nbsp; Think they should not be part of conversation because they divert attention from the conversation.&nbsp; Also think they’re a passive aggressive way to argue with the poster’s comments.&nbsp; &nbsp;And re: bumping, I don’t understand this myself.&nbsp; I understand the definitions given but I don’t understand how wanting to continue a conversation is bumping.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br /><em>“Act appropriately: We do not permit comments that we deem abusive, baiting, defamatory, insulting, harassing, inflammatory, hateful, obscene, inappropriately rude or personal, retaliatory, threatening, invasive of privacy or violative of any law.”</em><br />BAITING:&nbsp; It’s my understanding that a poster wasn’t banned for saying/typing the word asshole.&nbsp; The person was banned for baiting because they wanted to call another poster asshole.&nbsp; <br /><br />Splitting hairs: some members have written that the poster in question DIDN’T REALLY call anyone an asshole.&nbsp; Only ASKED if they could call someone an asshole.&nbsp; That’s still baiting in my understanding of the word. It might be baiting by coming thru a back door instead of coming thru the front door, but it would still be defined as baiting. <br /><br />Bottom line for me:&nbsp; Somewhere in The Rules the punishments/consequences of breaking them should be <strong>clearly</strong> stated.&nbsp; When people break them, they should get warned.&nbsp; Many people break rules unintentionally in the heat of discussion so a warning is in order.&nbsp; I think the warning should be inserted into the thread so others can know what&#039;s going on and not speculate.&nbsp; The amount of warnings leading to suspension should be stated in The Rules.<br /><br />Sorry this took up so much space. Decided to post it all at once instead of going back and forth in the thread.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				The definition of bumping has hit a bump. I’m no expert but how about something like:&nbsp; <br /><br />Bumping n. The act of posting a reply to an internet posting with the sole purpose of raising it’s visibility.<br /><br />I’ve deliberately left motive out of it. <br /><br />It’s quite apparent that the guidelines need to be clarified over the practice but I don’t think that can be dome until we come up with at least a basic meaning and let the discussion focus on whether people think about it, i.e., yes: needs moderation; no: doesn’t need moderation; don’t give a toss, etc.? <br /><br />[Look back at essen’s post, which pulls together these points.]<br /><br />and on commercial postings:<br />&nbsp;<br />Funny think about advertising: It comes in all shapes and sizes and sometimes even the savviest person fails to recognize when they’re being sold to.<br />&nbsp;<br />For instance, in the restaurants and food the infamous Freezepeach thread is criticized for being “commercial” yet the Mojave thread is not, though last time I looked at it Mojave was advertising a music night and new drinks on offer, with nary a peep from anyone about how commercial the thread’s become – promotion through dialogue – smart or cynical marketing tool?<br />&nbsp;<br />Please do not misunderstand me. I mean no offense to Mojave, which is a terrific restaurant and a damn fine addition to the Astoria scene and I’m not criticizing their participation in the thread, instead I wanted to highlight that opinions of what constitutes advertising, marketing and promotion are very inconsistent as are levels of tolerance.<br /><br />So like bumping, it’s not always easy to define a topic across a diverse group of people on this site (and the group includes merm) like this. There will be varying levels of acceptance. I guess what I’m trying to get at is that they’ll probably always be some level of conflict over the nature of “commercial” postings and if possible its worth the effort to keep tempers in check when disagreement arises.<br />

				Other boards (where I moderate) have a warning system in place.&nbsp; There is a board function that allows moderators to warn a member about behavior.&nbsp; Five warnings lead to a suspension.&nbsp; The member is aware of the warnings and the specific reasons through PM.&nbsp; But only the moderators can see the rating.&nbsp; So, for example, I post: <br /><br />&quot;Mr. Peanut is a fartface.&quot;<br />Merm or another mod sees that I&#039;ve clearly broken the board rules by name calling so he raises my warning level by one notch.&nbsp; The next time I log in, I get a PM that says:<br />&quot;Your warning level has been raised due to: name calling.&quot;<br />If, after a while, I haven&#039;t name called anyone or had another warning, it can be lowered to nothing.&nbsp; The moderators can always see the reasons for raising or lowering the status so if a member is confused, all of the details are available.&nbsp; <br /><br />Would something like that work for this board?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Magicpie - I think that&#039;s brilliant - it&#039;s similar to how the AOL IM system works too, and gives users a few heads up before they get a suspension.&nbsp; On the other board does it let other users see there is a warning?&nbsp; Would that be helpful or stigmatizing?

				I&#039;m an advocate for the warnings and stating the reasons.&nbsp; I&#039;m also in favor of stating the reasons for a suspension and/or ban.&nbsp; I&#039;m also in favor of rducing the amount of warnings an individual has as time goes by without any further incident.&nbsp; The offending conduct should be stated in the post.&nbsp; I aslo think that if a member is suspended, the reasons for their suspension should be stated in their profile for all to see.&nbsp; This demystifies the whole issue of &quot;what happened to the member&quot;.<br /><br />The mechanics of all of this should, of course, be clearly defined.&nbsp;

				My issue with the private warnings is that it increases the perception of inconsistent application of the rules.&nbsp; It does not allow other users to see which posts have generated warnings (or suspensions/bannings) and which haven&#039;t.&nbsp; There are apparently many posts that cause warnings to the poster, but the post itself remains.&nbsp; Much of the time, I have no way of knowing whether a particular post has crossed the line because it isn&#039;t deleted and I don&#039;t know what actions may have been taken against the poster.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I&#039;ve thought long and hard about my response to this discussion, and I&#039;m still not sure I have the time to write fully what I want to say.&nbsp; I do want to say that there is a lot that is wonderful about this board, and I&#039;m really grateful that merm started it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve watched Astorians grow from a board with 200 members and a handful of posts a day, to a board with thousands of members and hundreds of posts a day.&nbsp; I&#039;ve met an incredible community of people and have formed close friendships with a number of people I&#039;ve met through Astorians.&nbsp; It has indeed become very personal for me.&nbsp; That said, as I&#039;ve seen other people reference, I also think it has grown beyond its original conceived purpose and ideas and doesn&#039;t necessarily belong to one person anymore.&nbsp; Of course, the domain and such still belongs to one person, but this website is so much more than its domain and software.&nbsp; It has become a marketplace of ideas and connections for Astoria.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to respond to a few key things that stick out to me in the rules currently.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">- Act appropriately: We do not permit comments that we deem abusive, baiting, defamatory, insulting, harassing, inflammatory, hateful, obscene, inappropriately rude or personal, retaliatory, threatening, invasive of privacy or violative of any law.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&quot;that we deem&quot;.&nbsp; That&#039;s awfully vague and subjective.&nbsp; What one person may deem abusive or insulting or rude, another person may deem New York humor.&nbsp; Of course, there will always be some subjectivity in a rule of this sort, and some of the prohibitions I agree with (particularly the last few).&nbsp; However, several of the prohibitions can be interpreted in a number of legitimate ways, and I don&#039;t think there&#039;s a clear consensus on the board as to how we should interpret them.&nbsp; For instance, what&#039;s insulting?&nbsp; Many people on this board come from far-flung communities that may have different standards as to what&#039;s insulting.&nbsp; I&#039;m acquainted (online, as it happens) with a woman from the South.&nbsp; She recently wrote of being insulted when a man - a family member - didn&#039;t stand up to greet her when she entered the room.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure I would have noticed.&nbsp; There are similar parallels in speech/online behaviour.<br /><br />In law, there is a theory called the &quot;eggshell plaintiff&quot; theory.&nbsp; It basically means that if you hurt someone and they have an underlying weakness (a preexisting condition) that makes the injury you inflict worse, you are liable for the worse injury.&nbsp; I think there&#039;s a broad analogy here in the inverse - the site rules are attempting to cover all sorts of preexisting conditions of its members (for instance, people who are easily insulted) that results in a broader unspoken entreaty to &quot;play nice&quot; so we can all be happy.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">- Avoid repetition and duplicate posting: We encourage a diversity of viewpoints; however once a point has been made the discussion needs to move forward.

Spamming porn is one thing that will get you permanantly banned instantly for example, bumping a thread, or duplicate posting, or using all caps etc will just get you a warning. But technically speaking if you had already been suspended a couple times for other things you could I suppose be &quot;banned&quot; for doing it.

				Maybe there&#039;s a way to mark a post or a thread to show that a moderator has taken action in response to it. Or just a moderator response within the thread, which i guess has already been suggested. <br /><br />Having some indication or &quot;flag&quot; that a poster was warned or suspended due to a post sets the tone for the site for other users and the flag would give users an opportunity to speak up if they felt some revision to the rules was necessary or that the rules were being misapplied.<br /><br />(When I say &quot;offensive&quot;, I&#039;m thinking of something along with lines of flagrant racism or gay-bashing or threats - offensiveness does encompass many shades of gray. I&#039;m thinking of a situation where a new user who is, say, a knitter, finds offensive statements about people who knit but no indication of moderator action, and thinks that astorians.com is not a safe place to speak out as a knitter and decides not to join as a result).<br /><br />I also like the idea of having a system in which warnings add up to suspensions, with the potential for the accumulated warnings to be dismissed after a certain amount of time. Some of us expect to be members of astorians for a long time, and mutliple warnings or suspensions over a few months should have a different impact from the same activity spread over several years.

				Report to mod creates a new thread in a separate moderators board. The moderators can post in that thread to discuss any action to take place. In some cases there&#039;s no need for discussion (spam), other times there&#039;s more discussion about what&#039;s the best thing to do.

				I do agree with some of the ideas suggested including:<br /><br />The &quot;warning level&quot;, it is a step-ladder that helps the moderators be on the same page when it comes to doing their job.&nbsp; I also think that certain activities could have a certain warning level.&nbsp; Smaller infractions would incur one demerit warning as a huge issue would result in two demerit levels.&nbsp; After time of &#039;peace&#039;, they could be rewarded with a promerit to help them get their net warning back to 0.&nbsp; Also, each user should be able to see a cumulative list of demerits and promerits (administrative actions) on his or her account.<br /><br />We do need a bigger moderation team in place.&nbsp; And with the expansion of this team, I also think that after a person has been warned (assuming the warning level is put into place), a flag would be a good idea so posters know the limits.&nbsp; Maybe a thread and/or application should be created for people that are interested in becoming moderators.&nbsp; I also like the idea of having moderators split among the sections of the board.&nbsp; There should be, of course, more than one moderator per section.<br /><br />As for the nods, I do agree with people&#039;s opinions of them changing the tone of the thread.&nbsp; I have seen some boards such as city-data that includes a positive nod that leads to the posters &quot;reputation&quot;.&nbsp; Someone&#039;s reputation increases by the positive nods.&nbsp; I do not like the negative nod feature AT ALL!!&nbsp; Maybe, we could have simply a &quot;useful?&quot; nod that would increase a posters credibility to the forum.<br /><br />Meg, you mentioned no spam, porn, trolling, personal attacks/ad hominems.&nbsp; I do agree with these being the basic guidelines.&nbsp; I do think that bumping could be considered a form of spam because it is like re-advertising.&nbsp; To be honest, there are quite a few threads about businesses and restaurants that I do not read most likely because I am not interested in that specific establishment.&nbsp; However, I am still made aware of a new business just by seeing the thread title appear in the unread posts.<br /><br />Anyways, my .02 include the fact that I have enjoyed meeting many people from the board IRL and connecting faces to handles.&nbsp; There are still many users that I keep in contact via phone/e-mail and it has been great!&nbsp; Kudos to merm!

				As far as the nods go, I personally like them. People have used them differently, but I think for the most part, they have served kind of &quot;yeah, I agree&quot; or &quot;no, I disagree&quot; purpose. But, I do understand the people who are frustrated with them and who have said, &quot;don&#039;t nod, add to the discussion.&quot;<br /><br />Thing is, sometimes I don&#039;t have anything to add to the discussion. It&#039;s already been said. Someone posted that before the nods were here, people would just say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;I agree&quot; and it would be frustrating to go to a thread only to basically see pages of people saying &quot;yeah&quot; or &quot;I agree&quot;. This is why I like the nods.<br /><br />Perhaps if there was some way that people could see who nodded either way, then people would think twice about just nodding and leaving the thread? Maybe make it so that there&#039;s an alt tag for each nod, so when you hover over it, it&#039;ll say &quot;Alison, aquaceny, and NYCMacUser nodded yes, merm and mcdirk nodded no.&quot; or something similar. That way, people know who nodded either way, but we don&#039;t have pointless pages of &quot;yeah, that&#039;s cool&quot; or &quot;nah, I&#039;m not feeling it.&quot;<br /><br />Also, warning levels like MagicPie suggested are good, and I&#039;d totally nod that up.

That&#039;s not to say no one ever posted with just &quot;I agree,&quot; but I don&#039;t see it being noticeably more or less than what it is currently. What&#039;s noticeable now is how many people make posts to remark about the sort of nods they got, which usually don&#039;t get responses because people don&#039;t want people to know how they nodded. So that strikes me as being more irritating than people just agreeing with stuff. <br /><br />aquaecny, I don&#039;t think the reputation thing is a good idea.

				The purpose of this thread really centers around the &quot;rules&quot; of the board (not that the discussion about nods is unwelcome by any means). <br /><br />However, there will be more time to discuss nods over the next days and weeks, my primary focus right now is in soliciting feedback about the rules specifically, and then evaluating them again and making changes as necessary. Secondly, I think I&#039;ll need to consider how the rules are enforced and hopefully bring more clarity to this process as well. Those I think are the most pressing tasks. <br /><br />The change/removal of nods (and other forum improvements or technical changes) I&#039;m seeing as something that I&#039;d like to address soon, but not before these other two issues.

				hey all,&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been around so much lately (on the board, that is), but heard about these issues during my latest pop-ins and from a couple people IRL.&nbsp; Reading through the this thread, it seems like people have come up with a lot of good solutions to some of the issues and the discussion is great to see.<br /><br />MagicPie&#039;s suggestion of warning levels seems great to me, but I think that it should be specified that mods can choose to lower someone&#039;s warning level if they feel the issue has been addressed.<br /><br />For instance, <br /><br />X calls Y a big poopyhead.<br />Z reports this post.<br />Mod sets warning for X.<br />X PMs mod and says, &quot;I&#039;m so sorry!&nbsp; I just got a little heated up in the middle of the convo!&quot;&nbsp; <br />Mod PMs X, &quot;Please make that clear in the thread and apologize to Y.&quot;<br />X goes back to thread and posts, &quot;I&#039;m sorry.&nbsp; I was out of line by calling Y a big poopyhead.&nbsp; I should have been more adult about it and addressed the issues.&quot;<br />Warning level is dropped.<br /><br />Or something like that.&nbsp; I just think it&#039;s important that the poster&#039;s intent and contrition is taken into consideration.

				Good to be back on here. <br />Frankly, I could care less about the nod/reputation feature. I am on here to interact with local Astorians, shoot the sh*t and yes, engage in a little political squabbling every now and then.<br /><br />My main gripe with the board as it stands is that I&#039;ve been suspended 3 times without warning. The second time, I was grossly mis-quoted and had no recourse to defend myself. The third time, I was suspended while someone else got away scott-free with breaking the rules. I also thought that 30 days was overly harsh. <br />I&#039;m glad I wasn&#039;t alone, and that other people saw the discrepancies going on. I&#039;m glad it sparked a change in the moderation techniques, and hopefully will get things better here. <br /><br />I really enjoy contributing to the community here and vice-versa, and I am glad that the mods finally started listening to people&#039;s complaints about these things.
