				Tacky and shocking, which I&#039;m sure is exactly what they were going for. Kind of tarnishes the company in my mind. Not because of the pro-choice statement, but that they resorted to a gimmick to get publicity through controversy. And it&#039;s working... everyone&#039;s been talking about this.

				I&#039;m not offended, but I also hadn&#039;t realized how political some of the Mini Storage ads were.&nbsp; The only one I remember seeing on subway cars was the Paris Hilton chihuahua one.&nbsp; So when edava mentioned the Kenneth Cole ads, I started thinking about what makes them different from the Mini Storage ones, that&#039;s all.

				I&#039;ve noticed their ads for years on the subways, and always thought they were edgy and fun.&nbsp; Different and yeah, shocking.&nbsp; I&#039;m not offended.&nbsp; But it&#039;s for storage, and a picture of a storage unit isn&#039;t too exciting, so why not use edgy ads to sell your product.&nbsp; It&#039;s NYC, and it&#039;s not the first time I&#039;ve seen an ad with a hanger in it, and it probably won&#039;t be the last.&nbsp; Really, the article showed more people indifferent to the ads than anything.&nbsp; It&#039;s not that big a deal, but the news always like to make a big deal out of things.&nbsp; Big Woop-de-doo.

				My favorite ad of theres was the biker/cowboy looking guy with the teddy bear and it said &quot;I wish I could quit you&quot;.&nbsp; Not very political compared to the others but funny.<br /><br />I can see how people would get offended, particularly with the clothes hanger image associated with it, but hey it&#039;s Manhattan Storage&#039;s prerogative.&nbsp; Its not like they did something illegal like show human poop in a diaper ad or condoms/sex in a condom ad, that would be morally reprehensible.&nbsp; If someone happens to be the type of person who would be seriously offended by that ad, they have the freedom to find another storage place.&nbsp; What does irritate me is the idea that groups in somewhere like South Dakota are going to get up in arms about ads that only run here for a company that is based primarily in NYC/NJ.&nbsp; It seems like the same people who tell NYC not to force our morals on them, want to force their morals on us.<br /><br />But all in all this ad is more depressing than funny.&nbsp; I bet they switch it once the news coverage dies down.

				Of course &quot;just the facts&quot; is dull and uninteresting. But I&#039;d like to know whether these ads (which I personally dont&#039; find very clever or funny...) actually helped them make any money. The most talked about campaigns dont always turn into sales.<br /><br />And the voting thing seems like yet another &quot;lookit me lookit me!&quot; tactic. I think they should have attached an offer with voting -- like $10 off a month&#039;s worth of storage.

				&nbsp;:-)<br /><br />I&#039;ve been a Manhattan Mini customer since 2004. I&#039;ve got stuff stashed at their 44th St. facility on the West side.&nbsp; Come back from a shoot at 3 AM? No problem, it&#039;s open. Need to get anywhere in NYC or out of NYC? You&#039;re at midtown and bridge and tunnel options are super accessible. Clean and safe facility. Very cost-effective and reliable. Can&#039;t recommend&#039;em highly enough.<br /><br />The ad? :mrgreen: <br /><br />Of course, on principle, one should be in favor of any person or company using his/her/its money to express itself on any issue in any way whatsoever that isn&#039;t fraudulent or coercive. On a political/legal level, I&#039;m an advocate of the free flow of ideas, all of them. Of course, on a moral level, it&#039;s important to take stands against objectionable content, to boycott, to shame, to expose, to challenge, to debate. As long as we never let our zeal push us to call for government to shut people up or ban ideas.<br /><br />A brief aside:<br /><br />In college, my school&#039;s newspaper decided to run an ad submitted by a Holocaust revisionist group. The paper claimed they were justified in doing this by the First Amendment. I debated that notion, holding instead that, as a journalistic enterprise, they had a responsibility not to run ads that are, in fact, maliciously misleading. I argued that they should have used the ad as a starting point for an investigation into Holocaust revisionism, assigning the story to writers, perhaps commenting on it editorially. But I considered it negligent to run the ad as if it were as valid as any of the other ads on the same page, one from Dunkin Donuts and another from a study-abroad program focusing on Israel. Caused quite a stir at Brandeis, you can imagine.<br /><br />I was accused on being anti free speech by very confused people. Nobody has a right to express themselves at the involuntary expense of anyone else. Newspapers have a moral responsibility to ensure that their advertising meets certain standards. I&#039;d say the naked advocacy of racial hatred is something no newspaper should ever let itself be in the position of knowingly advertising. Newspapers are definitely NOT required by some kind of First Amendment imperative to publish every ad they are offered.&nbsp; <br /><br />Cheers to Manhattan Mini! Even if the ad is primarily there to create buzz, at the end of the day, they staked out a position that will be unpopular enough to lead to boycotts, and apparently the owners are betting that the positive benefits will outweigh the negative consequences. Risky? Yes. Courageous? Yes.<br /><br />

				Your discussion of the newspaper ad is interesting, but prob not apropos this thread. It&#039;s definitely worth a discussion unto itself. <br /><br />About the MMS ads:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=7556.msg93869.html#msg93869">Quote from: adamwc on September 23, 2007, 02:13:37 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Cheers to Manhattan Mini!

After all, it&#039;s not like they&#039;re taking a stance on issues that most New Yorkers disagree with anyway. Let me see a love letter to George Bush unfurl off the side of a SoHo loft apartment and then I&#039;ll say it&#039;s risky. And pushing the boundaries of taste isn&#039;t courageous, either.<br /><br />The company pretty much knows what it can get away with, and they seemed to have turned the whole campaign into a PR stunt. Good for them. Does it make people want to do business with them? I don&#039;t know, but that&#039;s the true test of their effort.<br /><br />Guffaws or grumbles over a subway add won&#039;t necessarily bring in the cash.
