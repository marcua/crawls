				Bronx vs. Manhattan this Saturday! Come see some of your fellow Astorian ladies kick some booty! (yeah, yeah, we know that they should be playing on the Queens team, but hey, most of the Yankees don&#039;t even live in New York in the off-season, right?)<br /><br /><div align="center"><b><br />BRONX VS.

The ladies in checkers will be looking to keep the pedal to the metal to make roadkill of the rest of the league.<br /><br />The Manhattan Mayhem will try to shake off their season opening 152-71 loss to the Queens of Pain on May 10th, and they have a plan to put a wrench in the Gridlock&#039;s plans for a second undefeated season. Mayhem, which boasts eight rookies on its roster of 13, brings an infectious level of enthusiasm to the track. Gotham fans should not forget that the reigning champion Gridlock girls debuted in 2006 as a team composed almost entirely of rookies - and after a rough start, the team quickly gelled to string together an undefeated 2007 campaign.<br /><br />Get in on the action early and take advantage of the advance ticket discount online at www.gothamgirlsrollerderby.com or through www.brownpapertickets.com.

				I moved here from Tucson, AZ and I&#039;m a HUGE fan of TRD and the Furious Truckstop Waitresses!&nbsp; I hear there&#039;s some Tucson transplants playing in NYC now, in particular Fisti Cuffs, my all time favorite.&nbsp; I really miss the rollerderby bouts at bladeworld, and especially miss the price ($10 at the door, instead of $23!)<br /><br />I won&#039;t make the bout this weekend, but will definitely catch one sometime.&nbsp; Say &quot;hi&quot; to Fisti from Tucson!<br /><br />Anyone who hasn&#039;t been to women&#039;s flat track derby should make an effort to see at least one game in their lives, it&#039;s a good time!

				Yes, the amazing Fisti Cuffs is a member of the Manhattan Mayhem and Hard Anya is a Brooklyn Bombshell. Both transferred into the Gotham Girls last year. Yes, our prices are a little higher than a lot of other derby leagues, but hey, it&#039;s the cost of living in NYC! ;)<br /><br />Besides, where else can you get this much entertainment for a mere $23? Come early and play roller derby bingo for fabulous prizes and compete in the halftime air guitar contest for even more fabulous prizes! <br /><br />The Gotham Girls All-Stars were just ranked the #2 flat track derby team in the COUNTRY and #1 in the East! This is some of the BEST, hard-hitting, fastest on-skates action you will see anywhere! And hey, it&#039;s pretty, strong, athletic, and tough girls beating the snot out of each other on skates. What&#039;s not to love about that? Come and see why the Gotham Girls has the rest of the roller derby world shaking in their skate boots!
