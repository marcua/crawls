				Is it worth getting tattooed in Astoria or should i just take the train to BK or Manhattan? I&#039;m not looking for anything serious at the moment. I have a regular guy upstate (that does my tattoo work). I&#039;m looking for some bsaic lettering or outlines. Have you gotten anything done locally? How did it turn out?

				Most impressive are the homemade tats they do out at the North end of Hazen St, just over the bridge.

				i recommend adriana as well, my bf has 16 tats, 8 she did and the ones that she did are the most detailed.&nbsp; I have 3 as well that she did, 1 was done 3 weeks ago.<br /><br />We went to gallo before finding adriana and gave him a piuc to sketch out after having for more than a month, he was honest and said that he couldnt do it... at least he was honest and didnt make a MESS.&nbsp; we took the pic to adriana, who had it done in 2 days and it is PERFECt!<br />I recommend every1 to her

				I wound up going to Fat Cat Tattoo last Saturday and got my letters done. Kevin did it. Pleased to see that we have an established tattoo shop in the neighbor hood (this one has been around for 14 years and stems from older shops). I was happy with the service and like my new tattoo. The shop is on 31st street between 31st Ave and Broadway.<br /><br />I passed this shop a bunch of times thinking it was a rinky dink operation not the case at all. I took a ride over to Adriana first, but she was busy, told me to come back in 4 hours, and when I looked at her book I was impressed. I&#039;m sure she doe very good work. It just sis not work out for me.<br /><br />Fat Cat also has a full time piercer.

				Fat Cat used to have some really impressive artists come in to do guests spots.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if / how frequently they still do that, but I had a friend come all the way from Syracuse to get work done there by one of the guests.

				Yep, Fat Cat has been around for a while.&nbsp; This is probably their 3rd location since they first opened.&nbsp; I got my first tattoo at Gallo&#039;s shop (not by Gallo) when it was down on 14th Street.&nbsp; That was way back in the days when all work was done in an underground (ie: unmarked) shop.&nbsp; I think some of the younger folks from Gallo&#039;s shop branched out and formed Fat Cat and started their first studio on Steinway St. heading towards 21st Ave....I got 2 tattoos from them....also when the shops weren&#039;t bright store fronts with neon signs.&nbsp; Gallo went on to open Painless Steel on Steinway after a short stint out of Astoria.&nbsp; Fat Cat moved again to Ditmars in the 20 somethings (a block or two down from La Guli&#039;s) but I never went to that shop since I already had enough tattoos.&nbsp; :roll:
