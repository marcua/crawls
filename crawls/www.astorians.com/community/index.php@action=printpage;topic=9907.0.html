				I had a very strange experience in there a few years back - we had pretty good crab legs but the place was overcome with flies!

				i ate there sometime within the last 6 months or so. the food was delicious, but very plain. The fish was just fish, decent portions and very good, but just fish. not really dressed up in any sauces or anything. <br /><br />definitely worth checking out

				My husband and I ate there a short while ago.&nbsp; It is simple, both in atmosphere and preparation of the fish.&nbsp; IMO the fish was so good &amp; fresh, it didn&#039;t need a whole lot of seasonings or dressing up.&nbsp; I believe the lunch special came with salad served family style, garlic bread &amp; either rice or potato.&nbsp; We really enjoyed it and would definitely go back.&nbsp; Prices were very reasonable for portion size and quality of the fish.&nbsp; We had fried calamari, broiled grouper, fried shrimps which were all fantastic.&nbsp; We also ordered baked clams which were very fresh but I wasn&#039;t nuts about that dish.&nbsp; Add in a few sodas and I think the bill was less than $50.&nbsp;

				Haven&#039;t been there in a while and I didn&#039;t try the lobster there but they do have a good reputation of having fresh sea food. I like alias corner located on 24th Avenue and 31st Street across from the beer garden. Very good food!

				Sort of off-topic, but I used to park my car behind the Greek Captain and I didn&#039;t mind the cats crawling all over it, but I could have done without the guts on the side.&nbsp; I asked one of the people who worked there about it and he told me that maybe I shouldn&#039;t park there.&nbsp; That lot, which you could barely fit your car into, cost me $75 a month in &#039;94 and &#039;95.<br /><br />Back on topic, though, I really like the Captain&#039;s fish n&#039; chips!

				Hi --<br /><br />I was just wondering if anyone has ever gone to the Greek Captain seafood restaurant... I was a regular there and then stopped going for a while. However, I went tonight and found out that they had sold the place... Sad because the previous owners were a really sweet older couple.&nbsp; In any event, the food and the service this evening was horrible!&nbsp; Its unfortunate because it was a really nice place... Just an FYI!&nbsp; :|

				I just came from there!&nbsp; A little disappointed... I was a regular there so comparing the food was easy for me... I understand that the place was just sold... I&#039;m thinking that has a little to do with it!&nbsp; But hey, they finally installed credit card machines!!&nbsp;
