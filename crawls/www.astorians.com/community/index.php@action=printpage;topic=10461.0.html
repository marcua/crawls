				Does anyone else go to Club Fitness on Broadway? I need a little motivation and a workout bud might help. <br /><br />Also, if anyone wants to try it out I can get you a guest pass. <br />

				I go!&nbsp; but I go really, really early in the morning around 6:30 before work. Sometimes I go<br />after work around 7 but not usually.&nbsp; I go on the weekends too.&nbsp; What time do you usually go?

				i have a membership there, but have never been (terrible, i know, considering it&#039;s so expensive), but i&#039;d be better at going if i had a partner...i think.<br />i&#039;d also be interested in going at night, around 9pm, probably. what machines do you use?<br />

				I can go later once in a while too! I haven&#039;t taken any classes but I definitely want to.<br />It would certainly help to have another person to go to a class with because I&#039;m<br />afraid of going by myself and it would be nice to have someone to laugh with!!&nbsp; :-)<br />Do ya&#039;ll want to set a time up? We can do elliptical or bikes together? <br />

				I have been doing couch-5K on the treadmill but I can take a break and try something else. And yes, I&#039;m interested in the classes but kind of scared of them. <br /><br />is anyone planning to go this weekend?

				I also have a membership and have been pretty good about going, but a workout partner would probably help.&nbsp; I tend to go when I get home from work, 7pm or so.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I&#039;ve only taken one class, Latin Dance, but I&#039;d like to try more.&nbsp; I&#039;d really like to get back into spinning.
