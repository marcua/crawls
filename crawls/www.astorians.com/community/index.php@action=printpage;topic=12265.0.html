				I went to Angelo and Son&#039;s for a sandwich yesterday.&nbsp; &nbsp; I forgot who, but someone posted they were almost as good as Sal and Charlie&#039;s on 23rd Ave.&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;ve had them before at Angelo and Sons and yes, they were very good.&nbsp; &nbsp; I usually call ahead so it&#039;s waiting for me when I get there.&nbsp; &nbsp;Yesterday was a spur-of-the-moment kind of day, so I ordered it at the counter.&nbsp; &nbsp;The guy that was making the sandwich came up front twice to look for a hero-roll and both times, shuffled all the bread around (like one&nbsp; would mysteriously appear after the first time he checked) and wasn&#039;t wearing gloves.&nbsp; Once I realized this I started paying attention and noticed him go to his brow several times and didn&#039;t wash his hands before begining to make my sandwich.&nbsp; &nbsp;Needless to say, I stopped him and went to go see the owner/manager.&nbsp; &nbsp;While waiting for him to get off the phone, one of the girls there asked me why I wanted the manager and when I told her she said she was glad I was saying something because it seems he NEVER wears gloves.&nbsp; &nbsp;*YUCK*&nbsp; &nbsp;When I spoke to the owner/manager he seemed indifferent and said something to the effect of &quot;let me find out what happened&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Huh?&nbsp; &nbsp;What&#039;s to find out?&nbsp; &nbsp;I just told you what happened.&nbsp; &nbsp;No offer of an apology, nothing.&nbsp; &nbsp; I went back this morning to get coffee and find someone who at leat gave the impression of giving a damn and the same guy was there.&nbsp; &nbsp;I hope I catch the other guy I see there tonight.&nbsp; (I&#039;m assuming they&#039;re the &quot;Sons&quot;)<br /><br />The only good thing is that the guy making sandwiches this morning WAS wearing gloves.&nbsp; (different guy tho)<br /><br />For those interested, the gloveless guy was Italian looking, with a grumpy disposition and a mustache.<br /><br />It takes a LOT to gross me out, but this grossed me out plenty.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I&#039;ll keep you all posted if I get a hold of the other &quot;Son&quot;.

				I went back last night and found out the more personable &quot;Son&quot; is on vacation, and yes, the gloveless one was again handling the food without gloves.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-P :yuck: :-P
