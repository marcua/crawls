				Hi Everyone!<br /><br />I&#039;m working on a blog that will hopefully become a great resource for anyone looking for an apartment in astoria.&nbsp; I work as a pastry chef and am doing this in my spare time because I want to make the process a&nbsp; little easier for the next person.<br /><br />I need your help with the broker section.<br /><br />I know so many people have posted feedback on astorians about brokers they&#039;ve used in the past but want to organize the information a little differently.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve set up my blog so people can click on a specific realty company from the main page and post a comment about the firm or an individual broker within that firm.&nbsp; Eventually I want to also display on the main page the total number of comments for each firm.<br /><br />I would greatly appreciate your feedback on brokers and/or on the site as a whole.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks<br />Andrea<br /><br />astoriarentals.blogspot.com

				This is so helpful, Thank You!&nbsp; &nbsp;I think with the experience I had with brokers in this area, I will sure be contributing to your blog.&nbsp; Also I may be looking for a new place within the next 2 months or so, so this is good to have a heads up on who to go to and who not.&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				Thanks for fixing the feed problem--I can subscribe to it now!<br /><br />I&#039;m happy to add my broker feedback, but neither of the brokers I dealt with aren&#039;t listed! Can you add Buy-Sell (on 31st between Ditmars and 23rd) and Halvatzis on Ditmars between 31st and 29th (or maybe 29th and 28th)?&nbsp;
