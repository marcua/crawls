				Here&#39;s the rest of the article now reported.<br /><br />Gay marriage dealt defeat in California<br />By LISA LEFF, Associated Press Writer 11 minutes ago<br />SAN FRANCISCO - A state appeals court ruled Thursday that California&#39;s ban on same-sex marriage does not violate the constitutional rights of gays and lesbians, a critical defeat to a movement hungry for a win after high courts in New York and Washington state upheld similar bans.<br /><br />ADVERTISEMENT<br /><br />In reversing the March 2005 ruling of a San Francisco trial judge, the 1st District Court of Appeal agreed with the state&#39;s attorney general, who argued that California&#39;s ban on same-sex marriage does not discriminate against gays and lesbians because of the state&#39;s strong domestic partner law.<br /><br />Couples who register as domestic partners have the same rights as married spouses in California except the ability to file income taxes jointly.<br /><br />The ruling does not guarantee, however, that same-sex couples will not ultimately be able to get married in California. Gay marriage advocates said beforehand that they would appeal to the state Supreme Court if the intermediate court did not decide in their favor.

				I don&#39;t think a more liberal or moderate supreme court would support gay marriage either.&nbsp; The court in the past was more moderate/liberal and look at all of the civil rights issues gay people have.&nbsp;

				There&#39;s a couple from Rhode Island who recently won the right to get married in Massachusetts.<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/30/us/30gay.html (http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/30/us/30gay.html)<br /><br />Then they&#39;ll presumably go back to Rhode Island and try to get the courts there to recognize their marriage.<br />Advocates will pursuing this issue in everey possible way, until hopefully something sticks.<br />I do wish that Bloomberg and Spitzer were more active on this front.&nbsp; I mean, it&#39;s nice that they&#39;re privately, personally for it, but it would be nice if they&#39;d use their positions to move the whole thing forward.&nbsp; I understand why they don&#39;t.&nbsp; But I wish they would.

				The sad thing in the California decision is that the courts said &quot;this is a legislative matter, take it to the state legislature.&quot;&nbsp; Well, we did in California and we passed the bill, then Governor Arnold vetoed it, saying go to the courts. <br /><br />New Jersey is about to have its ruling come down - before October 25 and I think it looks good for marriage equality.&nbsp; Governor Corzine has also said he would veto an anti-gay marriage bill.<br /><br />I think the current Supreme Court is not likely to give us equality, but if we had only stopped Roberts and Alito maybe it would have.&nbsp; We did win on the last two big cases (against Proposition 2 in Colorado and overturning sodomy laws), though we lost on the Boy Scout case.

				Public opinion is progessively more in favor, particularly among young people, so eventually it will happen.&nbsp; I just wish some judge somewhere would just do it because it&#39;s the right thing to do, even if there&#39;s no precedent.&nbsp; And like I said, a little moral leadership from our elected officials would be nice.<br /><br />The arguments against it are almost exclusively totally irrational too.&nbsp; Intellectual dishonesty + bigotry = pissing me off.

				Whats really so sad about this is that its really just a wedge issue and nothing more.&nbsp; <br /><br />So for the sake of votes and keeping people in power, there are thousands of couples out there who will lose out on benefits, rights and most importantly the simple loving act and pleasure of standing up before the whole world to be married and together in the eyes of all.<br /><br />Such a disgrace and shame.&nbsp; Just one more reason to get out and vote.
