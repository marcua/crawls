				&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We would like to host the first Social @ Hell Gate Social. We have a happy hour that we run on Fridays for the teachers in the area from 3-7 but would be more than happy to extend it to 8pm. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; HGS does $3 bottled beer and well drinks. As well as $1 off all other drinks.<br />As an added bonus you can try some of &nbsp;the drinks I have created e.g. Mad Thai, Georgia on my Mind, PB cup.<br />&nbsp;<br />George

				Looks like I&#39;ll make it after all.&nbsp; Can&#39;t go into Manhattan, as I gotta practice.&nbsp; So, I&#39;m considering a drink and a visit to Rapture as a practice break.&nbsp; Will be nice to see people!<br />

				My pinot noir was a success, actually.&nbsp; Smelled really, good, and tasted delicious - perfect for what I wanted.&nbsp; I recently had a mixed drink in Astoria elsewhere which was hideous.&nbsp; Probably the worst gin &amp; tonic I&#39;ve ever had - way bitter (like they added bitters to the tonic) and seved with a tiny piece of lime, so the lime had no chance to affect the drink in a positive way.&nbsp; And what is with asking if I wanted lemon as opposed to lime?&nbsp; I thought gin &amp; tonics were always with lime.&nbsp; Am I wrong?&nbsp; Anyway, I&#39;m sticking to stuff pre-bottled, like wine or beer, in Astoria for a while.&nbsp; I&#39;m feeling distrustful of mixed drinks in this town, unless I make them myself.

				<br /><br />Hey - it was good to see everyone and meet a newbie.&nbsp; Rapture is okay - I like the music - but maybe they need to loop more than 12 songs together.&nbsp; I think we should do a bar crawl in the future.&nbsp; Seeking out truly wonderful drinks, drink specials, awesome bartender, great d-j, tasty delights...or just dirt cheap beer with a pool table that&#39;s slightly slanted.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				A pool table would be great! Mixed drinks are tough, physically and on the taste buds, so I played it safe with Brooklyn Lager ... their taps were clean, though, the beer was pretty crisp (which I know sounds a bit silly, but a bad tap can be kind of gruesome).

				hey all, it was great seeing everyone and meeting those of you i didn&#39;t know. i totally agree on loving 80&#39;s music and needing a list of songs longer then a handful on repeat. Seeing as how i was a bit fried by the time i got there already-i will def not be gorging on Ali&#39;s food before the next event! i want to make sure to get around more and chat it up with everyone....i must say though,Jonathan-i always love talking food!

				That was so much fun.&nbsp; I was sorry I had to leave early...though maybe it was for the best because I only heard the &#39;80s mix once!
