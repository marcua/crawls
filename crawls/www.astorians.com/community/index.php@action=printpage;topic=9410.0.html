				I&#039;ve been a member of HSBC for years and years and years.&nbsp; Up until recently, they&#039;ve been great.&nbsp; They are not located in the Ditmars area, but because of the type of account I had with them, I avoided ATM fees when using other bank ATMs.&nbsp; Sometime in the fall, they changed their fee policies and now all accounts are being charged $1.50 per use.&nbsp; Plus my online savings interest rate keeps going down every two weeks, with the failing economy.&nbsp; So it is no longer useful to have a checking account with them.<br /><br />I&#039;m leaning towards Commerce, as I&#039;ve heard they don&#039;t charge fees, and even refund you other banks fees.&nbsp; Plus they have great hours.&nbsp; I have a number of banks on Ditmars to choose from:&nbsp; Chase, Citibank, Washington Mutual, Commerce, Northfolk, and Atlantic (I think?).&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyone actually like their bank?&nbsp; What&#039;s the good and the bad?&nbsp; Sell me on your bank :)

				I swithced from NorthFork to Chase about two years ago.&nbsp; I prefer Chase because they offer superior customer service and Northfork always had all these strange policies that annoyed me.&nbsp; In their defense, I think I neglected to change over to a regular account after college and still had the restricitions of a student account.<br /><br />I also Chase is all over the world and I haven&#039;t had any issues with them while traveling.<br /><br />Also, regarding ATM fees, there are Chase banks all over the city, and all Duane Reades have a Chase ATM.

				I personally like Bank of America even though the closest one to Ditmars is by Best Yet. That said however, they have stellar customer service and I haven&#039;t had a single problem with them in all the years I&#039;ve been with them (about seven). &nbsp;Chase lost my money on two separate ocassions telling me I had no funds where there was plenty in my account. &nbsp;<br /><br />Another option could also be to tie in your existing account to an Orange Savings account through ING. &nbsp;I have one of those and know people who use their &quot;Electric Orange&quot; checking accounts which allows you to get money from a lot of ATM&#039;s around the city for no fee. &nbsp;

				I never had any problems with Bank of America&#039;s customer service*, but their fees drove me crazy.&nbsp; They told me I could eliminate many of the fees if I did direct deposit (which I in fact do), but I&#039;d rather have free checking on my terms, not the bank&#039;s terms.&nbsp; I just checked my account, and I&#039;ve had a grand total of $2.00 in fees in the past ten months (for a balance check at an ATM).&nbsp; They do not charge me for using other ATM&#039;s, although they do not refund the fees from the other banks.&nbsp; I can usually find a WaMu ATM, though -- or I also have a free ATM at work.<br /><br />*I should qualify that.&nbsp; The only problem I had was when I was closing my accounts.&nbsp; They kept on not closing my savings account and then charging me because it was below the minimum balance requirements (because of course I had withdrawn all my money from it).&nbsp; It took me three months of going to a branch in person and sitting down with them each time (three times total) to straighten it out.&nbsp; In the end they did refund all the charges.

				I have the ING Orange Savings account and the interest is currently at 3.4% (down from 4.25% a year ago).&nbsp; In general I like them but when you deposit money it&#039;s five business days before you can transfer and then it takes two days to get it back into your checking account.&nbsp; I use it for long term savings then keep money in my B of A savings for &quot;quick cash&quot; if needed.

				So you haven&#039;t been getting an email notice every two weeks that your interest rate is going down on your ING account?&nbsp; I swear, every two weeks, I&#039;m getting a notice with HSBCs.&nbsp; It&#039;s 3.55% right now, but that&#039;s down from a high of 6.25% this spring/summer.&nbsp; And these days, it goes down on a biweekly basis.

				Wow, this is so weird - I never had any idea that so many people belonged to HSBC, but I&#039;d like to pile on the hatefest!&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m a current customer, and it annoys me that they only allow up to 8 transactions a month on their debit card.&nbsp; Are you kidding me?&nbsp; I pay my cable, phone, and electric bills through that, so there&#039;s three right there.&nbsp; That means that I can only use my card 5 other times throughout the month, or else I get charged an additional fee.&nbsp; Ridiculous.<br /><br />Throw in the fact that there are no HSBC&#039;s close-by, and that means I&#039;m looking for another bank, too.&nbsp; Thanks everyone for the advice!

				We use Washington Mutual -- we have two checking accounts and a savings account there and have never paid a fee. Never an ATM fee (for using another bank&#039;s ATM), no monthly fee, nada, and we get free checks. Our savings account interest rate went down (not sure what it is now), so we&#039;re considering switching to an ING account for savings, but otherwise have been pretty happy with WaMu. Good customer service, and the banks hours are great. Only complaint is that there are no deposit slips by the ATMs.<br /><br />Plus I just like saying WaMu.

				Are you eligable for a Credit Union at all? Either through your work, or your college alumni association, or anything else? You can save a fair amount of money on fees through a CU. I use my old grad school CU still, and they&#039;re great. For ATMs, most CUs are on a nationwide network that has ATMs in every single McDonald&#039;s in the US (and many other locations)! So I just pay the CU&#039;s $1 ATM fee, not the separate $.99 fee that the McDonald&#039;s machine charges. The only minor issue is that to deposit checks I have to send them via mail, which takes a couple of extra days. But I got a great auto loan through them a few years ago, and most CUs do home loans and such too.<br />

				Weighing in for Commerce, they have amazing hours, they have great customer service, the lines move quickly as they almost always have multiple windows open.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been thrilled with them since I moved over from Chase, where I always had terrible customer service (15 years with them and they had very little interest in keeping me with them).&nbsp; The 7 day a week service with Commerce is very convenient.&nbsp; I hear good things about WaMu and Sovereign as well, but I can speak from experience about Commerce - plus their online service is easy to use, nothing like some of the other online systems I&#039;ve seen (has anyone tried to use Northfork online banking?!)

				Chase offers free checking if you do direct deposit. That, along with their ever-growing number of<br />locations, makes them the most convenient for my needs.<br /><br />A credit union is great too if you&#039;re eligible for one. I still have an account with the<br />New York Times Credit Union from when they owned one of the magazines I worked for.<br /><br />Absolutely&nbsp; no fees. Free checking and all I have to keep in my savings/share account is $25.<br />They also offer low-interest loans, a VISA credit card, and even sell American Express travellers checks.<br />I&#039;m not trying to sell you on them, but a credit union, if you can find one that&#039;s convenient may<br />be the way to go.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m also a WaMu customer.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been with them since 1998 starting back in California.&nbsp; They were by far the best option for poor college students.&nbsp; I continue to like them a lot - although, I pay WaMu fees when I use a non WaMu machine and this wasn&#039;t the case when I banked WaMu in CA.&nbsp; Hmm...?&nbsp; - but they don&#039;t seem to offer much for high yield savings accounts, so I&#039;m considering a switch.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, here&#039;s something you might want to consider if you&#039;re thinking about WaMu, there are rumors/talks that JP organ Chase might buyout Wamu: http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/jp-morgan-pondering-buyout-washington/story.aspx?guid=%7B89CA2071-2631-42C6-8936-22E745A3B6DA%7D<br /><br />If these rumors are to be made true, I&#039;m not sure if what this means for commercial WaMu banking, but just thought I&#039;d throw it out there.

				According to all reputable financial news sources, it&#039;ll be at least a year before regular (non-business) WaMu customers notice any real changes.&nbsp; The only thing to be concerned about is that if adding together accounts one might have at Chase and WaMu brings the balance above $100,000 (ha, ha), in 6 months or so, it won&#039;t be FDIC insured.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve looked at Chase&#039;s checking accounts and their terms are pretty bad.&nbsp; I probably have some time to shop around, but I definitely will be moving on if I&#039;m forced to accept those terms.&nbsp; There are a lot of banks around Ditmars so I guess I&#039;ll be collecting information and figuring out what to do.&nbsp; There is apparently a long list of struggling banks though, so this may happen to more banks.&nbsp;

				Daisy, I think that Chase will honor the terms of your contract with WaMu until you make a change to the account. <br /><br />I&#039;m dismayed at the thought of being their customer too - but it probably won&#039;t be necessary to move, at least not right away. I&#039;m trying to find more info on it...

				Does anyone know where I could get information as to what other banks are in danger of being bought out? I&#039;m with Sovereign, and I like them a lot, but I know they are smaller and worry that they might have trouble.

				http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601213&amp;sid=amZxIbcjZISU&amp;refer=home<br /><br />&quot;The FDIC knows which banks are at risk; it has a watch list with 117 institutions. The agency won&#039;t disclose their names because doing so could cause depositors to panic and pull out all of their funds.&quot;<br /><br />

				Here is chase&#039;s welcome message to wamu customers:<br /><br />http://www.chase.com/welcomewamu/<br /><br /><br />It doesn&#039;t answer the question I&#039;m most interested in - whether chase will honor the terms of wamu&#039;s constracts and for how long - but there are some interesting details.

				bankrate.com is a good place to check on the health of your bank.<br /><br />I moved all my $$ from regional, large banks like HSBC/WaMu to small-town banks where I know the tellers.

				Good news for WaMu customers.&nbsp; I discovered today, quite by accident, that I was able to use my WaMu card at a Chase ATM without a fee.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping this wasn&#039;t some fluke but that we&#039;ve already been folded into the giant network of Chase ATMs.&nbsp; Anyone else experience this and/or have heard anything from either WaMu or Chase about this?&nbsp;

				It&#039;s true. Chase customers can use their ATM cards at WaMu locations also.
