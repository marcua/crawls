				I&#039;ve noticed a number of folk around here vend, or are looking to vend, their own products.&nbsp; While getting a booth at the numerous streetfairs they have around here might not be practical for a single vendor, it might be for a cooperative.<br /><br />Is there any interest in putting together a cooperative?&nbsp; Jewelry, handicrafts, clothing, edible goods, Incan matrimonial headmasks.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I&#039;d be up for it...provided there are enough people to drive the price down.<br />I had looked into it out of curiosity and remembered it was kinda pricey, but i can&#039;t remember where i got the info.<br />i was actually thinking about doing something like this.

				Okay, since there doesn&#039;t seem to be too much interest in putting down a risk on this, how about sales through commission, as in the booth is obtained and then those wishing can attempt to sell their products through the space, with a commission being paid to whoever runs the booth.<br /><br />I know there is Firelight Jewlery.&nbsp; Who else has something they&#039;d like to try and sell?

				Well, that sounds glorious, Frappe.&nbsp; I have no idea how to even get something like this started, so I would rely on you for your expertise.&nbsp; <br /><br />I forgot to mention earlier, however, that hot weather and I do not get along, so should we decide to do street fairs when summer is at its peak, I may have to go with your commission idea.&nbsp; And I assure you, I do not make corn or socks.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)<br /><br />Firelight, thanks for the compliment!!&nbsp; Your jewelry looks beautiful, so that is certainly where my profits would go, as well!&nbsp; I think you and I would have quite a successful, unique set of local wares.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)

				I actually have the vendor license, though it&#039;s lapsed.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been wanting to do this sort of thing for a while, but getting it together with enough stuff for one booth by myself just didn&#039;t happen.&nbsp; I discovered only after I had filed all the forms and gotten the license that I have to file quarterly sales taxes whether I&#039;ve made any sales or not.&nbsp; So I&#039;ve spaced on that a couple of times, but I could pay the fines and get it active again with less trouble than it would take to get a whole new one.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was deliberately vague about what I would be selling, I don&#039;t remember the exact category, but I&#039;m sure food is a separate one.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if prepackaed food would fit into my grouping or not.&nbsp; Certainly jewelry/baby sweaters/ stuffed unicorns (wasn&#039;t there something about no corn?)/lanyards would fit into my vendor category.&nbsp; I love the idea of a collective, and I could contribute the license and some of my objects-I&#039;ve-improved-with-paint to the cause.&nbsp; Perhaps we wouldn&#039;t have to saddle one person with the booth all day, but have some shifts arranged?

It&#039;s when you have collected sales tax that it gets burdensome. Does anyone know if all street fair vendors are strict about collecting/paying sales tax or just have the tax ID to meet the Clearview/Mardi Gras requirements and then just don&#039;t collect/pay sales tax? I&#039;ve always thought about doing this, but, since it wouldn&#039;t be a serious money-making venture, I&#039;d veer away due to the red tape.

				Hi! I&#039;d be interested in splitting a booth with some of you. I make jewelry made mostly of glass and metals. I have a tax ID number but I&#039;ve yet to get the temporary vendors license. Do any of you know a way of obtaining one rather than by mail or going directly to the dept of consumer affairs? <br /><br />if any of you are interested in a handmade jewelry/clothing/etc booth you can check out my etsy shop and see if we have similar tastes. timarie.etsy.com

				The vendors do not care at all about your taxes.&nbsp; They just want to make sure you have the paperwork so if anything comes down the pipe, their butts are covered.&nbsp; If you are producing your own product and you only take cash, you aren&#039;t going to have to report dime one, of course, everyone is always advised to properly pay their taxes.&nbsp; The tax ID number is only going to come into play if you buy product wholesale and wish to avoid being double taxed.&nbsp; The system isn&#039;t built to catch folk in your position.&nbsp; <br /><br />Costs are cheap.&nbsp; One time registation fee of $40, plus about $125 per event.&nbsp; Tax ID and getting a vendor license are quite cheap.&nbsp; For info on how to get a license, check out the NYC government website, Department of Consumer Affairs.&nbsp;

				Not sure if y&#039;all are ready for this yet, but: we have what we affectionately call a &quot;Costco Pavilion&quot; (looks like what i see the nice vendors use at the street fairs) that has only been used twice. Easy pop up white tent like structure. We even still have the detachable sides... somewhere... that could be lent/rented to anyone with the wheels to drag it back and forth to wherever it was being used. <br /><br />Cheers,<br />alia

				http://www.nyc.gov/html/dca/html/home/home.shtml<br /><br />This is the link to the Department of Consumer Affairs Website.&nbsp; From there you can find all of the rules and licenses.&nbsp; Its pretty easy unless a food which is not hemetically sealed is involved.<br /><br />Good luck!&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				Hi, everyone! I just joined this community (about an hour ago, actually!) and I love the ideas you are putting out!&nbsp; I actually don&#039;t live in Astoria yet, but I&#039;m planning to move there by August 1st. I am a part-time photographer, full-time Ph.D. student, and I have wondered for a long time how I could go about selling some of my photographs in NY.<br /><br />I do have a NYS Vendor&#039;s License and a Sales Tax ID #. (In response to one person who mentioned making the quarterly phone call: The NYS tax department started a new thing either this year or last where if you have 0 sales tax to report over a certain period of time you can qualify to make only ONE call a year: in March during tax season.&nbsp; I love this, because I haven&#039;t had any sales tax to report since I got my license for a street fair in Nyack, NY back in 200... something, and I keep a note reminding myself to make that annual call in with all my other tax stuff: so when tax time comes around, it all gets done at once!) And I agree with the statement that the Street Fair administration doesn&#039;t care about whether or not you collect the sales tax, they just want to make sure you are properly documented in case any inspectors show up. I found this out in Nyack: I went a little crazy to get my license in time (it turned out to be the easiest bureaucratic process I have ever experienced) only to have no one at the fair ever inspect my booth, even though the application had clearly stated that every vendor had to have their license displayed at all times.&nbsp; Plus, regardless of whether you get inspected or not, the license is a good to have and it doesn&#039;t cost much of anything to get, and almost nothing to keep.&nbsp; But be warned: if you get your license, let your reporting lapse and then want to start it up again, there is a $50 fee to get it activated again. This applies any time you miss filing or calling in a report.&nbsp; But since reported a Zero Tax Due report is only one phone call, it makes sense to just keep it active even if you aren&#039;t doing any business. I have keep my license active, filing Zero Tax Due, for the last five or so years, and so now it&#039;s ready and waiting for me to get off my butt and actually sell some art!<br /><br />About my photography: I should really call myself an amateur because I don&#039;t have my own darkroom and don&#039;t really sell my work professionally, for my living, or even often. I shoot a lot (I mean, a LOT) during my travels, but getting prints made is always put on a back-burner due to my busy school schedule. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Art History/ Archaeology, and I mostly shoot ancient and historical monuments and artifacts.&nbsp; My first (and only) street fair experience was thrilling, but was also a bunch of work since I did it alone.&nbsp; However, because of it I am now a proud owner of a severely under-used Costco Canopy of my very own that I would be happy to share, should the need arise. (It&#039;s about 10 ft. square? with a white canopy. I think we have the same one!)<br /><br />Of course, since I haven&#039;t moved yet I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be able to participate in anything this summer: But I&#039;m posting this reply because I really like the idea and would love to stay in the loop for future possibilities. And if all goes as planned and I become a newly-minted Astorian by August, I&#039;d love to meet some of you and share artistic ideas like this.<br /><br />So, Thanks! Hello to All! And here&#039;s to future conversations!<br />-Rose
