				My Ipod earbuds went kaput!&nbsp; Does anyone have recommendations for good to great headphones?!&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to wear those ridiculous big headphones, despite their quality.&nbsp; I prefer something similar to the earbuds, but ones that don&#039;t fall out when you move.<br /><br />Thanks.

				step it up and get some Sony earbud headphones - i got mine from radio shack $50 and they are 10x better than stock Ipod set<br /><br />and if you want to take it a step further, go with &quot;Sure&quot; starting at $100 but superior quality<br /><br />stay away from bose<br /><br />just my 2cent&#039;s

				Agree and recommend Sony as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;Didn&#039;t pay so much for mine but have beat the piss out of them for nearly a year and they&#039;re still going.&nbsp; Comfortably fit in my ears and don&#039;t ever fall out and sound good.

				Yes. If you have the cash, get the Shure in-ear headphones. The E2c are what I have (they&#039;re like $70, depending where you get them). Their sound is excellent, and they reduce the noise of the subway enough that you can reasonably hear your music/podcasts without having to crank it up to 11 and destroying your ears in the process.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=10721.msg131574.html#msg131574">Quote from: PJ on June 04, 2008, 03:30:13 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">step it up and get some Sony earbud headphones - i got mine from radio shack $50 and they are 10x better than stock Ipod set<br /><br />and if you want to take it a step further, go with &quot;Sure&quot; starting at $100 but superior quality<br /><br />stay away from bose<br /><br />just my 2cent&#039;s<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				After like my 20th pair of apple in ear headphones went kaput, I was determined to find something better.&nbsp; Basically my search came down to these two:<br />http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=8005008&amp;type=product&amp;id=1155848368219<br />http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=8703414&amp;type=product&amp;id=1199496037667<br /><br />I went with the Philips, as they were $10 cheaper, and based on my prior experience, I figured they&#039;d be broken within 4 months anyway.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had them since January, and they sound astounding.&nbsp; The only thing I hate about them is that they have offset cords, so the left ear is considerably shorter than the right, so I wind up pulling it out of my ear all the time.&nbsp; If the Sony ones don&#039;t have that, I will probably buy those the next time I need headphones.&nbsp;

				I have had the Bose ones for a couple years now and really like them.&nbsp; The plus is that if you lose one of the fitted earbuds you just stop by the Bose store in the Time Warner Center and they will give you a new set for free.

				I&#039;ve had the Sony MDR-EX71&#039;s for 3 years and only just now replaced them. They&#039;re the in-ear buds because I have tiny ears and can find different size bud replacements (just ordered that, too) This is 3 years of being really horrible to them: all tangled in the handbag, I pull on them to get them out. One side is shorter than the other but that&#039;s not a problem for me since they&#039;re always plugged into my nano, which is on an armband; the shorter length is on the side where the armband is, and it&#039;s not a problem even when I&#039;m running.
