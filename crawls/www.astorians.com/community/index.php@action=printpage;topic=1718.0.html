				I&#39;ve been to Agnandi, which is on Ditmars right next to the park. Very very good, for Greek food... I&#39;m not a big fan of Greek restaurants, except for the late (sniff) Philoxenia which mostly served turf instead of surf... I&#39;m embarassed that I haven&#39;t been to Trattoria L&#39;Incontro, which is supposed to be excellent old-school Italian, if noisy and a bit expensive...

				I agree that Trattoria L&#39;Incontro is excellent, but I wouldn&#39;t call it old school at all (at least, I&#39;m interpreting old school to mean a red sauce place).&nbsp; I suppose you could say that their main menu does contain a number of traditional dishes, but in addition to that, they&#39;ve got excellent dishes I&#39;ve never seen anywhere else - my favourite is their ostrich &quot;tenderloin&quot;.&nbsp; They also often offer venison and duck.<br /><br />The salads and pizzas are also good, and they&#39;ve usually got a couple of unusual pasta dishes as specials.<br /><br />Everything&#39;s good.&nbsp; It does get noisy, and I wish they would put some of their specials in writing (the list can be exhausting to listen to), but to me those are minor quibbles about what is very good food.<br /><br />Is Agnanti the &quot;Greek place by the park&quot;?&nbsp; If so, we went there once, a long time ago.&nbsp; We felt a little like we were treated a bit carelessly (because we&#39;re not Greek? - that was the vibe), but the food was good.&nbsp; I can&#39;t remember my main course, but my grilled octopus app was the best octopus I&#39;ve ever had.

				I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever made a reservation for it.&nbsp; Then again, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever tried to go on the weekend.&nbsp; If you go fairly early on a weeknight, you shouldn&#39;t have a problem.&nbsp; Even a bit later, you may have to wait, but I&#39;ve never seen anyone actively turned away.

				I will add that it&#39;s not particularly cheap.&nbsp; You could get away with a salad and an individual pizza for under $20 with tax and tip, or a pasta entree for about the same, but for instance, the ostrich entree I mentioned above is $24.95.&nbsp; Still much cheaper than Manhattan, but not cheap.<br /><br />Here&#39;s their written menu (http://www.trattorialincontro.com/menu.htm#app).&nbsp; They also have an extensive recited list of specials each night.<br /><br />But if others are up for it all the same, I&#39;d be up for going with a group!<br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; Their desserts aren&#39;t much, IMHO, so if we went early enough, we could go around the corner to La Guli for some gelato (they close at 9), or if later, somewhere else nearby....

				Agnanti is fantastic -- IMO the best Greek restaurant in the Ditmars area. I&#39;ve been there several times and always impressed with the quality of the food, the freshness, the variety, etc. It&#39;s not at all what I call &quot;sloppy greek&quot; cuisine where it&#39;s a bunch of greasy grilled meat and starch drownging in yoghurt sauce.<br /><br />My one beef is the smoking section -- outside on the sidewalk. I&#39;ve found there&#39;s no way to eat on the sidewalk and be free of it, regardless of how windy it is, unless you go when it&#39;s totally empty (which, judging by the times I&#39;ve walked past it, is never.) There are just too many chain smokers puffing away for hours. Bleech! It&#39;s too bad b/c it&#39;s a fantastic spot -- right by the Park.<br /><br />Sometimes inside isn&#39;t much better. In the warmer months they leave the windows wide open which pulls that cigarette smoke inside. It&#39;s particularly bad if you&#39;re seated next to a window.

				I would love to try this place, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to afford it.&nbsp; However, if you do work it out so that you stop at La Guli after dinner, I&#39;d love to join you for that!&nbsp; Someday I&#39;ll make it to L&#39;Incontro.

				I&#39;ve been to Agnanti twice and really like it. The stuffed kalamari is wonderful. Haven&#39;t made it to Trattoria L&#39;Incontro but I&#39;ve heard a lot of good things about it.

				Tratoria L&#39;Incontro...<br />I&#39;ve been a few times - lunch, dinner... I have enjoyed my meals - but I have no idea why it&#39;s one of the highest rated Italian in NYC. &nbsp;I HATE the specials menu. &nbsp;They have at least 1000 (or it seems that way) specials a day -and they insist on speaking them instead of writing the darned things down. &nbsp;My memory isn&#39;t that good - and reading about the food is like... foreplay. &nbsp;Don&#39;t deprive me of my premeal excitement. &nbsp;<br /><br />Agnati - we&#39;ve had FANTASTIC and forgetable meals there. &nbsp;The worst and the best service. &nbsp;Adam the waiter - rocks. &nbsp;The locals lighting up with the owners after a meal - sucks. &nbsp; How do you complain about the smoke, when it&#39;s the owner&#39;s smoke?? &nbsp;I guess you could pretend you didn&#39;t know. &nbsp;<br /><br />When it comes down to it - unless the food is absolutely spectacular, 5 star, to-die-for, most meals are made really memorable by the company and the conversation (and maybe a glass or two of wine)<br /><br />hence... the birth of the Astorians Who Eat together no matter what they call themselves group .<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				I agree with everything Jen said.&nbsp; Agnanti can be great and usually is. The owner can be a bitch too until she realizes you are going to leave if not taken care of properly.<br /><br />What to do about the smoking there is a problem.&nbsp; there is just no way around it, inside or out.<br /><br />Wish you had all know the previous owner there.&nbsp; She ran it with her husband, would come out and give big hugs all around and would discuss your menu with you.&nbsp; Then would ply you with free desserts and more hugs.&nbsp; I miss her.

				I went to Trattoria L&#39;incontro a couple of times before it got realy nts and really enjoed it. Every time I have tried to go since then it has been too full to get in. I would love to try to go with a group one day.<br /><br />Also, in terms of Italians in the hood, we went to the new Italian place on Bway right by the subway where Gables (and actaully still owned by the same people) used to be (&#39;Cesco) and it was fantasic. Of course my mom made a point of going to the maitre d&#39; and letting him know she was Italian from Italy the instant she got in the door, so that might have helped. Also not cheap, but worth it. <br /><br />Agnati I&#39;ve also really enjoyed, in large part because they are not ashamed to put some turkish influenced dishes on their menu, and I LOVE Turkish food.
