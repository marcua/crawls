				Ok. I don’t know how many Astorians listen to Radiolab on NPR, but I’m addicted! I was listening to a few podcasts this morning and they had one on earworms. You know- those nasty little songs and ditties that get stuck in your head constantly. <br /><br />So, here are my earworms:<br /><br />The Theme from Jurassic Park ((this is the most recent one))<br />If I Only Had A Brain from the Wizard of Oz<br />Edelweiss<br />and occasionally Umbrella by Rihanna, which is the most annoying of the lot<br /><br />What are your earworms?? And more importantly, how do you get rid of them??<br />

				oh god, i can&#039;t stand those optimum online commercials.&nbsp; that one with the mermaids thrusting should be on telemundo or something.&nbsp; &nbsp;:lol: <br /><br />as far as getting rid of earworms, i have a theory.&nbsp; you just have to listen to the song in question a bunch of times.&nbsp; get it out of your system.&nbsp; if that doesn&#039;t work, play something else incessantly so that it gets pushed out of your brain.<br /><br />this morning i had some weird vaudeville song/melody in my head.&nbsp; i sang it out loud a few times, and up until now, i forgot about it....s___ it&#039;s back!

My friend&#039;s 1-year old will stop in his tracks if it comes on, and nothing gets his attention (separate issue!). Also I work with kids (a different school/camp every day), and at least once a week, kids who are messing around (mostly boys) will start singing it. One kid even yelled at me once because I have Time Warner and not &quot;I-O...DIGITAL CABLE...(something something) WHENEVER YOU&#039;RE ABLE!&quot;<br /><br />My fav line is &quot;call your mom, or your date!&quot; Hahahha...<br /><br />Oh, also, one of the kid&#039;s grandmas did the &quot;4-4-4-8!&quot; pelvic thrust dance in front of me once!

I think I have complained about it somewhere else on this forum. That ad makes me nuts. But I think it has more to with it being reggaton. I think I just really dislike reggaton music. Sometimes I get that song &quot;Not Enough Gasolina&quot; by Daddy Yankee in my head and it makes me want to jump off a building.&nbsp; <br /><br />My lastest earworms are &quot;You Can&#039;t Always Get What You Want&quot; by The Rolling Stones and &quot;Don&#039;t You Want Me&quot; by the Human League.

				I&#039;m glad I don&#039;t listen to the stations that give such bad earworms--I&#039;m sure that earworms are exactly what advertisers intend.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t heard that &quot;free credit&quot; one but it strikes me as really bad.<br /><br />One good piece of music that was an earworm to me a few weeks ago was &quot;There but for You Go I&quot; from &quot;Brigadoon.&quot;&nbsp; A hauntingly beautiful melody, but I was really irritated by the <em>nostalgie de la boue</em> of the musical.&nbsp; Come off it--it&#039;s all right to long for the days of your lost youth, but for the eighteenth century?&nbsp; Especially when you&#039;re engaged to a twentieth-century woman?
