				This show is the best thing about radio today (especailly considering how lame the NY commerical radio market is). I encourage every human being on the planet to listen to KCRW. Nic Harcourt is cool, but <strong>Jason Bentley</strong> is AWESOME! He does a show called <em>Metropolis</em> every weeknight on KCRW. Also podcasted. <strong>Liza Richardson</strong> used to do a show called <em>The Drop</em> that is also really really good for discovering the best of new indie music. And of course, the immortal <strong>Garth Trinidad</strong> is iconic LA soul with <em>Chocolate City</em>. <span style="font-size: 15pt;" class="bbc_size">Viva La KCRW!</span>

				I remember when Morning Becomes Eclectic was hosted by Chris Douridas, before Nic Harcourt signed on as musical director of the station...<br /><br />I also miss Liza Richardson&#39;s Man on the Moon. As much as I love Jason Bentley&#39;s electronica show, it was great to go sleep to Liza&#39;s stuff late nights in high school
