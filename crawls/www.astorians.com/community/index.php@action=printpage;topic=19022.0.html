				(MOD: If this should go under Random Gabble insted then please move)<br /><br />We bought an amazing Aquos LED TV from PC Richard on Steinway back in December 2009.&nbsp; At the time of purchase we told the salesperson that we preferred to purchase the extended warranty through Sharp directly rather than the one they offer on the spot.&nbsp; He indicated this on our account (as it&#039;s noted on my receipt).<br /><br />Fast forward to about six weeks ago when I started receiving multiple daily phone calls from a company called WarranTech.&nbsp; Turns out they were given my info from PC Richard as they are their third party warranty vendor.&nbsp; They call my cell phone 4-5 times a day despite my polite (and lately not-so-polite) insistence that my factory warranty still has a few more months and I&#039;ve already purchased the extended warranty through Sharp.<br /><br />Personally, I think it&#039;s a horrible business practice that PC Richard would give my personal info to their vendor to sell a product when I had already refused it both in the store and several times over the phone with WarranTech.&nbsp; <br /><br />I emailed the manager of the Astoria today expressing my displeasure but was wondering if anyone else has had this issue?

				IANAL. but given that you have no pre-existing relationship with WarranTech, this should shut them up. &quot;Your company and I have no pre-existing relationship. Do not call me again. Further calls to my cell phone after today are a violation of state and federal laws.&quot; Then report them and PC Richard to the state AG unless they stop calling. If nothing else, dealing with the complaint will waste the company&#039;s time and reduce their profits.

				Thanks Harlan!<br /><br />That&#039;s basically what I told WarranTech this morning and told them this is bordering on harrassment.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been &quot;assured&quot; that the calls will stop so I guess only time will tell.
