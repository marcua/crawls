				A bit off topic, but was mentioned earlier in this thread.<br /><br />&quot;Hellgate on the Park&quot;<br /><br />It was Wednesday night, the Chef was in.<br /><br />Four people at the bar. Another six or seven at a table in the back.<br /><br />Everybody and everything, juke box and TV was............. LOUD !!!<br /><br />The menu was short but the standards were there.<br /><br />A friendly waitress suggested that everything may not be available like no ravioli.<br /><br />Frank Sinatra and I believe Julio Igleses were singing......LOUDLY over the boisterous group at the table who were discussing Viagra, drunk driving and the merits of Dean Martin&#39;s singing and where Jerry Lewis would be without him.<br /><br />I&#39;ll have the gnocci and meat sauce, I told the waitress.<br /><br />She smiled but shortly returned and announced that rigatoni, linguine and capallini were my pasta choices.....................Capallini and meat sauce, please.<br /><br />Hot Italian bread and butter were brought out. My bottle of Becks came, no tap beer, sorry, and shortly there after I asked for a glass of water.<br /><br />A couple of gentlemen wandered by throughout the meal and asked if everything was all right.<br /><br />&quot;Fine&quot; I answered, hoping that they could hear me.<br /><br />The capallini and meat sauce was pretty good. If you can&#39;t make a decent meat sauce you&#39;ve got no right to call yourself an Italian Restaurant. Frank Sinatra was now singing &quot;The Summer Wind&quot; when a gray haired bespeckled man asked me if I wanted an after dinner drink. I indicated that I was actually quite full, it was a generous serving. He watched me for a while before smiling and saying I had a rain check on the drink.<br /><br />So, how was it..........did I mention that it was loud? Okay, but it was friendly too. Maybe not a great choice for a first date where you want to speak softly and stare into each others eyes......but.....if you are out with the guys and want to chow down on some pretty good Italian food without breaking the bank...my meal was $12.00.......try the Hellgate on the Park. <br /><br />I stopped in the night before and was told that it was &#39;Wings&quot; night when the chef was not there...at least on Tuesdays anyway.

				This has turned into a little Hellgate on the Park string of sorts.&nbsp; I will be there tomorrow night and go most every Friday, and then some, depending.&nbsp; I&#39;m the guy who admitted to being loud.&nbsp; And as for loud, I have to laugh.&nbsp; The review posted earlier sited the volume.&nbsp; For WEEKS I was complaining that it was too quiet.&nbsp; I am a corporate type and when I want a few drinks after work, I want a total distraction from my day.&nbsp; Some lively action, music, etc.&nbsp; At the beginning they would have the TV on.&nbsp; I can do that at home.&nbsp; Finally they are playing the jukebox at a reasonable volume and the place sounds like a bar (to me).&nbsp; Indeed there is a local crowd that could seem comical.&nbsp; But I probably know all those guys that were mentioned.&nbsp; They&#39;re not about rocket science but they&#39;re generous and sincere.&nbsp; In time the crowd may get younger and more professional.&nbsp; Just like the neighborhood itself.&nbsp; Things have a way of evolving on their own.&nbsp; For now, rest assured that it&#39;s safe, clean, fun, and great food.&nbsp; But agreed, not a date place.&nbsp; Not a gourmet restaurant.&nbsp; And you must go with a sense of humor.&nbsp; They&#39;re also trying to find experienced bartenders so the staff and service will be hit and miss for a little while.

				I sit out front in order to smoke.&nbsp; Which usually lingers into conversations with whomever is out there - and then progressively louder and louder!&nbsp; I think I&#39;ll be able to spot anyone who isn&#39;t a regular.&nbsp; I&#39;m not shy so I&#39;m the type that will approach people and ask if you&#39;re from the chat group.&nbsp; Either I&#39;ll ask you directly, or no doubt, you&#39;ll HEAR me asking others!&nbsp; &nbsp; :-D

				My wife and I will be there for dinner tomorrow with a neighbor of ours. &nbsp;Probably around 6:30ish and then will remain for drinks until they throw us out. &nbsp;Other local friends will be joining us as well. &nbsp; We gravitate between the back patio and the front few tables. &nbsp;Except for when ordering fresh drinks or playing songs. &nbsp;I hope more of you will come. &nbsp;And try the food if you don&#39;t eat before. &nbsp;You won&#39;t be disappointed. &nbsp;Everything is prepared fresh. &nbsp;They don&#39;t have the kind of kitchen to store an inventory of frozen foods etc. &nbsp;I was already thinking I should give him a heads up about our friends all coming to eat. &nbsp;Now I will definitely stop in and let him know that there may be a larger crowd than usual.

				Age range for the place runs the gambit, but tends to be not a young 20-something crowd.&nbsp; There are the older guys who have all been friends since childhood and they&#39;re in the 50-60 range, but I don&#39;t think on a Friday night they&#39;re the majority.&nbsp; Mostly it&#39;s late 20&#39;s to mid 40&#39;s.&nbsp;

				Okkichan we missed you! Daisy and I sat in the back and ate with LHT, TJT, and friend Lou. This is a nice place!! I just had a salad and it was good but the pasta dishes everyone had looked awesome! Everyone here is realllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllly friendly so if you have an attitude or a problem with friendly people this ain&#39;t the place for you! Seriously though, it was a nice place and I <del>think</del>&nbsp; know they would welcome an Astorian outing. The local crowd is a little older but they are sweet!

				Yes, it was so great, thanks for introducing this to us, TJT!&nbsp; I absolutely loved it!&nbsp; I was the first one there for 20 minutes by myself, but from the moment I walked in the door, Andrew the owner introduced himself, made sure I was comfortable, and everyone at the bar said hello and wanted to make sure I was alright.&nbsp; They all must&#39;ve thought I was crazy, - just how do you explain that you are meeting people that you met online and don&#39;t know who they are??&nbsp; They thought we were a dating service, or that this was dangerous for a girl to be going out by herself to meet a bunch of people she doesn&#39;t know.&nbsp; Oh it was so funny, but it a good way.&nbsp; They were so nice, friendly, and protective of me.&nbsp; Then nyctexas arrived, and so everyone could know I wasn&#39;t cuckoo, and TJT and LHT and Lou came, and they all knew them at the bar.&nbsp; Everyone seems to be a regular there, and are super friendly and I had a great time.&nbsp; The food is Awesome!!!&nbsp; Each plate is freshly made, and they take a long time cooking but that&#39;s why it&#39;s so delicious.&nbsp; Yeah, its got it&#39;s quirks, but that&#39;s fine with me.&nbsp; i&#39;m definitely going back.

				I&#39;m so glad to have met the members of the group.&nbsp; It was a nice time.&nbsp; I felt bad because I was off from work on Friday and foolishly went to Hellgate on Thursday night as well.&nbsp; And, unfortunately, did a little too much celebrating.&nbsp; Was not my normal self on Friday and went home relatively early.&nbsp; Not usually my style.&nbsp; But we had a great meal and a very nice evening.&nbsp; We&#39;re pretty much there every Friday and stay much later.&nbsp; I&#39;m glad the folks who went liked the place.&nbsp; The crowd is very friendly and the place is picking up by leaps and bounds.&nbsp; I can picture having to wait for a table pretty soon.&nbsp; From almost no one there 6 weeks ago to what it&#39;s become - pretty amazing.&nbsp; The owner, Andrew, is even surprised how its caught on.&nbsp; And it was pretty funny about meeting people from the group.&nbsp; One man who is a regular, was a little confused.&nbsp; He knows my wife and I from the bar.&nbsp; When I walked in, he came over very sheepishly to tell me that &quot;girls&quot; were asking for me and said they met me online.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-o&nbsp; I tried to explain but he isn&#39;t someone who goes online so it just sounded bad to him.&nbsp; We sat with the two ladies we met at the outset and then he came to the table during dinner to tell me that more girls from the website were looking for me in the front of the bar.&nbsp; I&#39;m still not sure what he really believes about it all but it&#39;ll be fine.&nbsp; I hope to see you all there again.&nbsp; And that more will give it a try.

				i was there! i&#39;m confused as to how this came to be... but myself, my fiancee and my friend were sitting in the back eating dinner around 7:30. Lou came to our table a few times and I asked him if TJT was here yet. He said no (?) so we continued to eat. (we had chicken parm and the penne a la vodka and it was like eating at my mom&#39;s house, we devoured it!) afterwards we took our wine to the front in the hopes of running into TJT there. Chatted with people out front and someone told me that TJT was in the back! So rather than going into the back again and causing a spectacle we decided to let him finish his dinner and wait for him out front. He and his wife came out front, but not you 2 (?) ...TJT said that you had walked out just a little while before, that y&#39;all had dinner together... crap.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> just how do you explain that you are meeting people that you met online and don&#39;t know who they are??</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />yeah, i&#39;m not very used to meeting people from the internet (i&#39;ve only done it once before and she lived on campus so it was foolproof.) i am however perfectly capable of talking to strangers, we were getting along with everyone great. the owner and his daughter are real nice. and my friend even stayed after we went home to keep watching the Yankees game with everyone at the bar. <br /><br />the crowd is older than us but that didn&#39;t stop us from having a good time. i&#39;m going to go back with my dad, he&#39;d have a great time there. he&#39;s outgoing and friendly just like everyone there. <br /><br />

				Oh man, you know we were right next to you!&nbsp; And when you walked in the first time, I thought maybe it was you, but you walked straight in towards the back as if you&#39;d been there before and weren&#39;t looking for anyone.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was alone across from the bar and you all walked right past me, so i didn&#39;t think it was you.&nbsp; Oh man!&nbsp; And then we were back there in the garden right next to you!&nbsp; Oh well, next time.

Went here after frisbee one afternoon with JD and they were so sweet, even let me bring my bike into the bar because I didn&#39;t have a lock. And though we were only there a short time, had we been able to stay we would have gotten a free round from one of the regulars there. <br /><br />Definitely up for a group thing larger or small, sometime soon.
