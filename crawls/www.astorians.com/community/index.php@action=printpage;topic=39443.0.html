				&nbsp;:cool: <span style="font-size: 9pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font">1951 we moved to L.I.C. from 125 Navy Walk Fort Greene Projects (Ingersoll Housing) Brooklyn. I attended PS 111 until June 1954, cool school, I was in the &quot;Library Class&quot; for 5th Grade and then the &quot;Science Class&quot; with Mrs. Solomon for 6th Grade. We lived at 12-50 35th Ave. Ravenswood Projects 1951-58 then 33-68 21st St. Queensview West until I joined the US Navy Feb. 1960. We attended Mass at St. Rita&#039;s, played PAL Baseball at the 110th Precinct, swam at Astoria Park Pool and in the East River at Rainey Park. Still in contact with friends from Queensbridge and Ravenswood Projects and Queensview &amp; Queensview West. I graduated from JHS 126 June 1956 Class 9-SP1. I remember Mrs. Smul Homeroom; Mrs. Sullivan French and Mrs. Tedesco Algebra. Then on to Rice H.S. 124th St. &amp; Lenox Ave. in Harlem, I hated that school. I wasn&#039;t the best student and always regretted my lack of enthusiasm, but enjoyed the social life in the Ravenswood/Queensview West neighborhood we lived in. I get back to L.I.C. &amp; Astoria every once in a while, it&#039;s great to visit for a week or so, but my home is now California</span></span> :cool: Home Sweet Home :cool:&nbsp; <span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 9pt;" class="bbc_size">If anyone is interested, there’s a reunion scheduled at Riccardo’s by the Bridge (riccardos.com) on July 30, 2016 9:00pm – 2:00am, check Queensbridge Oldtimers on FaceBook and google </span></span><span style="font-family: verdana;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 9pt;" class="bbc_size">for details.

				Correct that, I think it was the <strong><em>114th Precinct</em></strong>. Bad memory, we were playing softball on the field in the DofS Park behind the DofS Garage on 21st St. between 34th &amp; 35th Ave. when two teams of cops came on the field and told us to leave because they had a game scheduled, I was 13/14 yrs old? and said &quot;something flatfoots&quot;, next thing something brushes past my ear, a short fat cop was coming at me, the others had to restrain him, he&#039;d thrown a softball at me! If my Dad had known he&#039;d have whipped the cops ass and then beat the hell out of me! Since then I&#039;ve always &quot;respected, obeyed &amp; complied&quot;. BTW two of my younger brothers retired NYPD, Captain &amp; Sergeant.

				You have a fantastic memory.&nbsp; &nbsp;I grew up in the 70s, and barely remember any of my elementary school teachers.
