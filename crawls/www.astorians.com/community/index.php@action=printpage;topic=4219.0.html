				they did lose their license. So no more beer, no more business. Too bad, they were an amazing place for a sandwich at 4am on any given night. I&#39;ve lived here for 10 years, and this place was a staple, like one of those that you think will never go away..... :cry:<br />

Not sure if they sold their older store, or just had people managing it. The Euromart is pretty good, took their original concept and greatly expanded it, large beer selection too.

				They don&#39;t sell beer? Someone told me they did, but I didn&#39;t notice myself because I don&#39;t drink, so I don&#39;t look for it when I shop there. Next time I&#39;m there I&#39;ll see if they do or not. Good stock of food options regardless.
