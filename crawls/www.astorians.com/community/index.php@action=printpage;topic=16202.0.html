				Hello.&nbsp; My roommate and I are moving out of a very nice 2 Bedroom apartment that is on 33st between 31st ave and 30th ave.&nbsp; My landlord is a great guy so I wanted to help him rent the apartment.&nbsp; He never raised the rent in our 4 years of living there and anything that needed to be fixed was done promptly.&nbsp; The bedrooms are both nice size.&nbsp; I believe the one bedroom is 14x10 and the other is about 12x10 or so.&nbsp; Good size closets in both rooms.&nbsp; The whole apartment is finished off very nicely and the location is great.&nbsp; Feel free to PM me for details.&nbsp; He is asking $2k for the place.

				Yeah, I think it is kinda high too.&nbsp; We paid 1800 and I think it is worth that.&nbsp; It is a very nice place with good sized rooms and he finished things off nicely.&nbsp; The bathroom and kitchen are much nicer than most you see around with stainless steel appliance, nice tilework and granite counters.&nbsp; The location is great being only 2 blocks from the subway, right down the road from key food, the cafes, etc (jeez this sounds like a craig&#039;s list ad).&nbsp; He told me no less than 2000 but I still think he would take 1800.&nbsp; I just was in the rental market and despite what some of these renters/owners/brokers think and tell you it is a buyers market in every way.&nbsp; There is no need to pay a fee right now and all rents are negotiable.&nbsp; I saw many apartments via a broker where there was no fee (the fee was paid by the owner).&nbsp; Even in that situation, I would discuss how bad the market was with the broker and then they would try to strongarm you into taking a place still.&nbsp; It was amazing. <br /><br />

				Several of my friends and co-workers have 2 br apartments in the area that you are describing and they all pay less than $2000 a month. In fact, most of them pay less than $1800. Just my 2 cents ...

				We also have a 2br and pay less than $1,800. It is a noisy area, though still better than paying an extra $5k/year.
