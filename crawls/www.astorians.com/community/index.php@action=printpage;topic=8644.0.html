				Old Astoria Village (called &#8216;Two Coves&#8217; by Goodwill Industries of obvious reasons) is the oldest and largest community without a shred of protection in the city.

Every year we loose a few 150 year old homes. Even eroded, it still has dozens of buildings worth saving. Most of its structure remains intact. It is a unique ante-bellum Long Island community just across the river from Gracie Mansion.<br /><br />The point here, my dear friends, is that as long as Astoria treats its past like this, it will remain a laughing stock among some quarters of the city.<br /><br />The other day, I noticed this listing:<br /><br />http://www.streeteasy.com/nyc/sale/126877-house-astoria-astoria<br /><br />The background to the property was listed this morning.<br /><br />http://queenscrap.blogspot.com/2007/11/rosemont-builders-developers-delight.html<br /><br />How do you feel about this, Astorians?

				We should start an online petition and send all signatures in to HDC organization.&nbsp; It is such a shame that we&#039;ve lost so many homes in that area that were priceless homes and replaced by ugly buildings.<br /><br />Sure, it&#039;s great that Astoria is a growing community but our history and landmarks shouldn&#039;t be destroyed to make room for more people.<br /><br />

				The on line thing sounds great!!! <br /><br />Send emails to Historic Districts Council and demand they post it on their endangered community list (I understand they ignored previous requests) <br />http://www.hdc.org/neighborhoodatrisk.htm<br /><br />Go ahead and fill in the LPC application and send it in. Again, again, and again. <br /><br />Write letters to the Gazette. <br /><br />Post on Queens Crap. <br /><br />Speak up at the community board meeting during the 3 minute public time slots. <br /><br />megc has that wonderful forum on OuterB which could do fantastic publicity.<br /><br />Make copies of everything you do and say and SHARE IT WITH THE BOARD!!

				Hello; <br /><br />I was alerted to this thread by a colleague. It&#039;s nice to see that there is interest in preserving what&#039;s left of Old Astoria Village. I just wanted to clear up one thing - HDC will be posting the area under our &quot;neighborhoods at risk&quot; shortly, and will be including on the page a link to the Long Island City Alliance - who made the request to us. <br />Also, while we would appreciate the attention of recieving an online petition - it would be more fruitful to send it to the Landmarks Preservation Commission (comments@lpc.nyc.gov). Please do send us a copy at hdc@hdc.org so we know what&#039;s going on. <br />Otherwise, Gleason&#039;s suggestions are great and everyone should follow them. If you have the time and the inclination - letters to the LPC can be more effective than an RFE form and make sure to cc CM Peter Vallone Jr. on all your correspondence. Just because he hasn&#039;t done anything for the preservation of the area in 6 years doesn&#039;t mean he should be given a free pass now. <br /><br />Simeon Bankoff<br />Executive Director<br />Historic Districts Council<br />232 East 11th Street<br />New York, NY 10003<br />p: 212-614-9107<br />f:&nbsp; 212-614-9127<br />c: 646-942-7354<br />e: sbankoff@hdc.org<br /><br />Visit HDC at www.hdc.org<br />Find out the latest preservation news &amp; events at http://hdcvoice.blogspot.com/

				It&#039;s really disgusting what has happened to Old Astoria Village.&nbsp; Developers did the same thing to most of Maspeth, and they are about to do it to St. Saviour&#039;s Church.&nbsp; There&#039;s nothing left of our history.&nbsp; This is what some call &quot;progress&quot;.&nbsp; Only greedy developers and politicians could think that bulldozing and replacing entire communities brings positive change.&nbsp; There are those that wonder why people bother to fight to keep their historical structures and laugh at them for doing so. They are obviously people who don&#039;t care about the well-being of Queens communities.&nbsp; Some of these people run blogs.

				Thank you Megc! Thank you Simeon! Thank you Maspeth Maverick!<br /><br />Nearly 40 people were involved in a walking tour this past weekend through Old Astoria and everyone was not only horrified at what they saw (the tour will soon to be posted on the Forgotten NY website) put found the community&#039;s passiveness inexcusable and incomprehensible. This is a black mark for Astoria. As I said before, it makes us a laughing stock around the city.&#160; <br /><br />How about the other 2,997 that have joined this board? Lets hear from you! Go down to 12th Street, 14th Street, and 27th Avenue and give us your impressions. Is this the legacy our generation wants to leave the future? Many of your love Astoria - well lets prove it by stopping this travesty with your comments and continued attention. <br /><br />Folks, what about that on line petition? Lizluv, excellent idea. Please go ahead. Will it be like the one they put up for the bookstore? Lets keep this simmering.<br /><br />Please.

				I would think that any self styled community leader would come out in favor of saving this building -&nbsp; one need only look around the city for example after example of people with the courage and conviction to have done this.<br /><br />Only a few weeks ago our community got egg on its face (again) when the Daily News reported the destruction of LI Savings Bank in Queens Plaza. Lack of information to the community spelled disaster for that building. The local civic was caught unawares.<br /><br />Not so in this case. You are a regular writer of real estate in NY so we might assume that you consider your opinion noteworthy. You have now brought this to the public&#039;s attention.<br /><br />You now have an opportunitiy handed to you on a silver platter to save this worthy structure Megc.<br /><br />Lets see what you will do.

				While some of the older properties are lovely, much of the newer constructions appear to be of better use for the community.<br /><br /><br />I dont think the issue is so easily resolved. <br /><br /><br />If however the owners wish for a historical designation and see it as a treasure for posterity, I would support them.

				Aside from sentimentality, what compelling reason is there to preserve these places? The existence of a big $3.9 million home is of no direct benefit to me. I can&#039;t own it, go inside it, hang out on the property.<br /><br />And has anyone asked why homeowners in this area are not resistant to the change? Could it be that property taxes are killing them and they&#039;re looking to get a nice return on their property? I believe if it&#039;s designated a historical site, there are major restrictions as to what a homeowner can do -- even for upkeep and maintenance. Then there&#039;s the neighborhood itself -- not exactly great what with projects down the block and zero amenities.<br /><br />You&#039;re talking about getting something for nothing, at the expense of the people who actually own these homes. And you&#039;re ultimately trying to tell people what they can do with their own property. I&#039;m not down with that.<br /><br />In other words, if I was the owner of that 3.9 million dollar white elephant and told I need to preserve it, what&#039;s in it for me?

				I&#039;ve been a long-term advocate of landmarking, and live in a landmark district myself.&nbsp; It&#039;s great.&nbsp; Before those of us in the preservation community throw ourselves into the fight for OAV, however, we need to see a solid demonstration of support for landmarking by residents of that community.

				Somebody e-mailed me to grumble about the above post.&nbsp; I stand by my words. <br /><br />Getting a district landmarked is a lot of work; please believe me.&nbsp; There are doors to knock on, petitions to draft, meetings to attend and arrogant opponents to deal with. Folks from outside of the community can help a great deal, and some will. Still, the primary stakeholders for landmarking will always be the residents of the community itself. When a sizable number of residents gets on board,&nbsp; City agencies and politicians will start to take notice. <br /><br />That&#039;s how Sunnyside Gardens got landmark status. People in the community WANTED it!&nbsp; And they pushed hard. Sure, there was some opposition, mostly from a strange coalition of &quot;My Home is My Castle&quot; types and hot-heads who tried playing the racism card.&nbsp; But their &quot;grass roots coalition&quot; collapsed as quickly as it formed. <br /><br />Residents of OAV, the ball is in your court.

				The problem is likely a combination of apathy, ignorance of the facts and a &quot;my home is my castle, so I can do whatever I want&quot; mentality. Here are some things for locals to consider:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Landmarking helps protect your investment by keeping the area attractive.<br />2.&nbsp; Help is available for homeowners who need to make expensive repairs in landmarked areas.<br />3.&nbsp; Landmarking actually increases property values. Look at places like Cobble Hill and Brooklyn Heights.<br /><br />Sunnyside Gardens residents wanted the advantages of landmarking, and that is why most were in favor.&nbsp; Folks from outside the community who wanted to preserve this special area gave valuable support, but in the final analysis this was a fight won because so many locals put many hours of hard work into the process.&nbsp; They collected signatures.&nbsp; They did research. They sent hundreds of letters and e-mails.&nbsp; All of this was more than idealism; they knew that landmarking works.

				Hi everyone,<br /><br />Some of you may be aware of Council Member Vallone&#039;s ongoing efforts with the Department of City Planning to have a comprehensive zoning study done for Astoria.&nbsp; His goal is to target certain areas in the neighborhood that are appropriate for larger developments and preserve those that aren&#039;t, such as Old Astoria Village.&nbsp; Our office has had several meetings with City Planning and it appears as though the study will be happening shortly.&nbsp; To that end, City Planning is asking for pictures where buildings have gone up that are detrimental to the character of the neighborhood.&nbsp; For example, just on my block alone a 3 story 6 apartment building sits right next to a older wooden frame home.&nbsp; We have submitted many examples and pictures of this and we are looking for even more to show.&nbsp; If anyone would like to submit a location that they feel would help strengthen the case for our neighborhood&#039;s rezoning please feel free to post it and we will go out and take pictures.&nbsp; If you have pictures you would like to email I can be reached at cathleen.sims@council.nyc.ny.us or cathleensims@hotmail.com.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Council Member also wanted me to extend his thanks to all who attended last weeks meeting and he is looking forward to more in the future!

				I think there are serious problems with the governmnet putting restrictions on private property.&nbsp; To us in may be a landmark, but to the people who own it, it is their property.&nbsp; For the governmnet to put restrictions on private property because it makes it look nice isn&#039;t fair to the people who legally own it.<br /><br />I find the two coves area very interesting and enjoy walking in that area of astoria.&nbsp; It is a shame that the area has public housing project on what could be some valuable real estate.&nbsp; &nbsp;

Its called &#039;Old Astoria&#039; even by the community board.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t believe in government putting restrictions, you can move to well&nbsp; ...&nbsp; can someone help this gentleman out - it there any place in this country that has no restrictions?

There is no free market in effect with NYC real estate; high demand is made worse by artificial restrictions on the supply of real estate thanks to landmarking, rent stabilization, &quot;public&quot; housing, outrageous property taxes and a myriad of other soft-core socialism the city imposes on property owners.<br /><br />It amazing me how in NYC people think they&#039;re owed a piece of someone else&#039;s property.

				My dear boy, private developers are subsidized by us taxpayers. Big time. The could never get their plans off the ground without tax beaks, or diverting public resources and city government to support their schemes. Projects that we are paying for, be it a power grid or sewers, are not being spent in our communities but in places like Long Island City. So we get brown outs and flooding. Six million for a &#039;Greenway&#039; up Vernon? How about a few dollars for a garbage pickup on my block after a three day weekend?<br /><br />We have to ask ourselves as to why is the anti-landmark crowd seems to dodge the opportunity at repeating those tired anti-landmark digs in the faces of communities that already are landmarked? Is this an example of misinformation fearful of facing actual facts? And why doesn&#039;t this board take up the cause for Old Astoria? We need someone who is well versed in real estate.<br /><br />To continue to ignore that community&#039;s destruction is a black eye for Astoria.

				That walk through tour is excellent.&nbsp; I am very interested in learning more about the abandoned Queens Engine Company #4 firehouse?&nbsp; I emailed the address on the site, but I&#039;ve yet to receive a reply.&nbsp; Does anyone know anything about it, it&#039;s history, or who might be in possession of it?<br /><br />I know it&#039;s a very long shot, but I am actually interested in potentially purchasing the building.&nbsp; Was a firefighter in Texas before moving to NYC and I am in the process of trying to get on with FDNY, so I have a love for anything FD related.&nbsp; I think restoring the building to its original state and using it as a residence (or residences) would be awesome.&nbsp; So, I&#039;d like to find out what I can.<br /><br />Any help is appreciated.

				Arguing about &quot;affordable&quot; housing is irrelevant as far as landmarking is concerned.&nbsp; The buildings in question are small enough that they are not covered by any rent regulations, so people renting there now, or in the ugly &quot;Fedders Houses&quot; that the developers will throw up, are paying, and will continue to pay, market rates. As for the Projects, they would not be included in the landmarked district. <br /><br />Landmarking makes a lot of sense for a lot of reasons. Opponents may throw out the old &quot;affordable housing&quot; argument, but it doesn&#039;t wash, as the houses in question aren&#039;t subject to regulation. <br /><br />On the other issue, I agree that a hellova lot of &quot;private sector&quot; development ends up getting paid for by we, the taxpayers, one way or the other.
