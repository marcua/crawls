				What&#039;s good at Martha&#039;s?&nbsp; I bought a cherry pie there once which looked great.&nbsp; When we got it home, it was a huge disappointment.&nbsp; It was a very blah pie shell which seemed to have simply had a can of over-sweet icky generic cherry pie filling poured into it.&nbsp; We ended up not eating the darn thing.&nbsp; Too gross - a waste of &quot;dessert indulgence units&quot;.

				I haven&#039;t been thrilled with a lot I&#039;ve tried at Martha&#039;s, but, as I tend to say every time I talk about Martha&#039;s, I love their buttercream cupcakes. Their pastries aren&#039;t quite as divine as those from La Guli or St. Honore, but the cupcakes make me happy (they aren&#039;t as cloying as a lot of their other stuff), plus the store just looks and smells really nice, which I think adds to the dessert experience. I like getting some of the coffee drinks too. Next time you want to use up your dessert indulgence units, go for the buttercream cupcakes and see what you think. I particularly like the peanut butter one, but my roommate had the strawberry one and loved it. <br /><br />By the way everybody, today they have Super Bowl cakes and cupcakes.&nbsp; :mrgreen: I saw it on my way to Trade Fair, where I went to buy SALAD ingredients.

				I agree about Martha&#039;s.&nbsp; I got something there - which should have been a light and airy piece of pastry, but it was leaden.&nbsp; Whoever is their baker does not have a light touch.&nbsp; Too bad because the place looks like it could turn out 5 star desserts, but I don&#039;t think so.&nbsp; I have to give it another try though . . . I&#039;ve only had one thing.

				I hope I&#039;m not stepping of place, but I’d like to quote a passage from Astorians.com rules:<br /><br /><strong>This isn&#039;t a random internet site. </strong> Given the nature of this online community having real world connections to a real community (Astoria &amp; LIC) it&#039;s important to keep in mind that what happens here is not limited to the void of the internet.

				I&#039;m reasonably new to Astoria, but I have to stick up for Martha&#039;s. Went there for the first time this weekend and the cupcakes were awesome! Only tried the ones on the bottom shelf, with the hard-ish icing and the flowers on top, but the cake was moist and very vanilla flavored and the pink icing was excellent, just how I like it! I might say they rival Magnolia&#039;s. Did try the chocolate covered strawberries though and they were not so good. Compared to the other bakeries on Ditmars, have to say this is my favorite so far.

				I gotta say, I was at a birthday party at Cronin &amp; Phelan&#039;s the other day and the birthday cake was from Martha&#039;s and it was absolutely <em>the best</em> I&#039;ve had in years.&nbsp; It was a Lemon Meringue Cake and tasted absolutely awesome, the filling was nice and lemony, and the cake light and not too sweet.&nbsp; Reminded me of my Mom&#039;s Lemon Meringue Pie!&nbsp; This was my first taste of Martha&#039;s - I live closer down to Broadway so usually don&#039;t pass by Ditmar&#039;s very much but, based on tasting this cake anyways, I think Martha&#039;s Country Bakery rocks!

				I agree too.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gone there many times, picked up a few items (cupcakes, cookies, muffins, scones) and they are never above average, at best.&nbsp; I always want it to be good.&nbsp; I&#039;m the type who would go out of my way for something delicious but there&#039;s nothing there to crave, that I&#039;ve had.&nbsp; I don&#039;t hate it but it&#039;s average.&nbsp; It&#039;s actually frustrating.&nbsp; I love Buttercup Cafe on Second Ave and Two Little Red Hens Bakery in Manhattan (as a comparison).&nbsp; Those I do go out of the way for.&nbsp; Also, I find the counter help to be barely helpful, if not unfriendly, and I&#039;m not even the chatty type.&nbsp; Renovation is an improvement.<br /><br />

				That&#039;s wonderful, Josephine!&nbsp; I think pastries are too often over-sweetened, with unnecessary frostings, etc.&nbsp; I&#039;ve really enjoyed the danishes (including the cheese danishes).&nbsp; When I first discovered them at Dolce Italia, I was happy to finally find a bakery that used good ingredients, simply, so you could enjoy the featured flavors (prune, cheese), without blanketing them with sugar frosting.<br /><br />I also have really enjoyed the muffins - zucchini, carrot, pumpkin.&nbsp; Again, the ones without over-sweetening and unnecessary frosting.<br /><br />Can you tell I spend too much time thinking about sweets?

				Okay, it&#039;s really nice to hear from another prune danish fan.&nbsp; It seems like these days, when you can find a prune danish at all, it&#039;s almost always over-sweetened, and too often ruined by icing.&nbsp; Let us taste the fruit flavor!<br /><br />I have fond memories of a French bakery run by a Japanese baker, The Adore, on 13th Street between 5th and University that used to make incredible, subtle, delicious prune danishes.<br /><br />Many bakeries seem not to trust that customers can appreciate their goods unless they are screaming with sugar and add-ons.

Why not see for yourself? Try a peanut butter cupcake. If you hate it, try something someone else said was good.

The person who said they got dry cupcakes must&#039;ve gone at a bad time, because in my experience that isn&#039;t the norm (and I did get a dry cupcake from there once, next time was good again).

				I agree - the cupcakes are awesome. I actually like the fact that they have a hard-type frosting.&nbsp; It compliments the moist cake nicely. <br /><br />I had a double chocolate chip cookie there last week, too, and that was phenomenal.

				Regarding the dry cupcakes: I wonder how often they switch out their cupcakes.&nbsp; &nbsp;I do a lot of baking (especially cake and cupcakes) so from experience I know that cupcakes are at their peak for only around the first two days.&nbsp;

				I dropped in there for the first time last weekend.&nbsp; Picked up two cupcakes (strawberry and pistachio), they were perfectly acceptable if not exceptional.&nbsp; What WAS exceptional was the little pecan tart I had -- high nut-to-filling ratio, perfectly crunchy and chewy in the right spots, just absolutely superb.&nbsp; I think it may be my new favorite local-area baked good (though the pignioli at Dolce Italia give it a run for its money!).

				Hello! Brand new to the board,but def not new to Martha&#039;s.....my hips can attest to that, unfortunately. <br />There are def hits and misses. <br />My 2 cents: cupcakes with reg icing, cookies, poundcake (esp cranberry crumb), choc mousse cake, pudding are all great.<br />Pies, tarts, scones,cupcakes with cream cheese like icing are not good. The pies and tarts I def think it is the crust, something about it is just not what I was expecting. My hubby has tried a few of the pastries...they were very hard. The cinnamon horn ended up better when I heated it for him.

				Reading all these posts, and being a dessert enthusiast relatively new to astoria, i had to put in my two cents.&nbsp; Martha&#039;s...the items i&#039;ve purchased have been stale.&nbsp; and i think with the expansion, it lost a certain charm/warmth.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have never had a bad experience with anything from Dolce Italia.&nbsp; Desserts, black &amp; whites, and especially my favorite...biscotti.&nbsp; the cappuccino walnut, forget about it!&nbsp; They&#039;ve even converted this tried &amp; true starbucks fanatic to their coffee.&nbsp;

				I recently had a red velvet cupcake from Martha&#039;s - it was great!&nbsp; Delicious and moist, and the cream cheese frosting was great, too.&nbsp; Nothing stale about it.&nbsp; NB: I have had stale cupcakes in the past from there.<br /><br />I also recently had a couple of mini-cannolis from Dolce Italia, which were great! I especially like and recommend their chocolate hazelnut cannoli.&nbsp; It&#039;s really good.&nbsp; I had the coffee, but it wasn&#039;t my style.&nbsp; Too weak (I had drip) for me, but I do love very strong coffee.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to try the espresso drinks, though.

				OK, I have to chime in because I LOVE Martha&#039;s. Now, I only get one thing there (raspberry cupcakes!), so I can&#039;t testify to many other items on their menu. However, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve seen raspberry cupcakes anywhere else and theirs are delicious. The frosting somehow tastes just like fresh raspberries! Raspberries are my favorite fruit, so that&#039;s a major part of the appeal for me, and obviously someone who didn&#039;t like raspberries as much as I do wouldn&#039;t enjoy the cupcakes as much.<br /><br />That being said, I did have a red velvet cake cupcake once and did not enjoy it. I also had a Napoleon and it was good, but overly sweet for my taste. Since those two trips, I&#039;ve gotten nothing but the raspberry cupcakes and been very happy.<br /><br />I, too, have wondered how often they change the cupcake display. Actually, all the baked goods. They can&#039;t all be fresh every day!<br /><br />My husband likes to get the gelato during the summer and seems to enjoy it very much (the toffee coffee flavor).

				Well, I would say they&#039;re exaggerating to make a point.&nbsp; I will say that I once impulsively bought a cherry pie at Martha&#039;s because it looked great, and we did something we never do - threw it away when we were clear that it was inedible.&nbsp; Canned (or canned tasting) cherry pie filling, in a lousy pie crust.&nbsp; No point in wasting useless carbs, fat grams, or calories on it, with less than zero pleasure in return.&nbsp; It looked great though.<br /><br />Similar bad experiences with cupcakes from there.&nbsp; Pastries are often pointlessly icing-ed over with unneeded extra sugar.&nbsp; Not a good bakery, in my opinion.

				Yeah, sometimes I go in to take a look, and then leave after a minute. It&#039;s a shame the quality is lacking, but the look of a place is often inversely proportional to the quality of the food. <br /><br />Years ago, I got a couple of cakes from the Cupcake Cafe on the west side. The place looked like a shoddy establishment with a complete lack of décor- practically an afterthought in a not-so-great part of town. <br /><br />The cakes, however, were delicious works of art. My sister&#039;s bridal shower and mom&#039;s 60th birthday cakes were from there. Don&#039;t know how their quality has held up since then- plus they&#039;ve redecorated.<br /><br />Good to know it&#039;s a reliable place to stop in and have some quality hot chocolate, if nothing else!<br /><br />

				I agree that Entenman&#039;s and Mrs. Smith&#039;s is better than Martha&#039;s. You always know what you&#039;re getting with those brands. We gave up on Martha&#039;s a few years ago. Eating their no flavor cake is like eating a bowl of Crisco with sugar sprinkled on top. <br />I prefer Sara Lee&#039;s pies-especially apple, even if their pie crust isn&#039;t as tasty and flaky as before the trans fat ban.

				Artopolis is pretty good, I guess.&nbsp; I think I prefer stuff like Galaktobureko and Kataifi from Victory Sweet Shop, though.<br /><br />I think LaGuli is overrated just based on their name value.&nbsp; I know the new owners have been back for a couple of years now but I had a cheesecake from there about a year ago and I was pretty nonplussed.

				LaGuli is wonderful (for the most part) for Italian pastry, and there are plenty of good choices in Astoria for Greek pastry lovers (of course), but sometimes we want good old &quot;traditional&quot; cakes, cookies, pies. The kind you&#039;d find in the Betty Crocker cookbook, that remind us of simpler times and perhaps our childhood. I thought that was the idea behind a place called &quot;Martha&#039;s Country Bakery&quot;.<br />Maybe too simple a concept is too exotic for Astoria.

Everything in Astoria seems to be made with Crisco-like shortening! Tasteless and an unsatisfactory mouthfeel.

				I was underwhelmed by their apple tarts, but love their M&amp;M cookies. A few mornings a week I get their coffee and croissant deal and am always happy with both.

				Martha&#039;s Bakery had the best hamantashen in New York.&nbsp; Everyone else&#039;s hamantashen have left me disappointed.&nbsp; I hope it&#039;s there when I try to go there this Purim.<br /><br />But two or three years ago, whenever the cupcake craze was at its height, I went to Martha&#039;s for my annual Purim treat.&nbsp; I looked all over the store and found not a hamantash in sight.&nbsp; Not behind the counter, not in the window, not in any of their display baskets.&nbsp; As I was about to leave, I thought better and asked for hamantashen.&nbsp; <br /><br />They brought me the hamantashen from the back.&nbsp; They were as good as ever.&nbsp; Why hide them?&nbsp; &nbsp;Are they contraband or something?

				Yesterday I made the trek to Martha&#039;s for hamantashen, and now that the cupcake craze is dead, they&#039;re putting other sweets on display, including hamantashen.&nbsp; I bought two; hope they&#039;re as good as ever.
