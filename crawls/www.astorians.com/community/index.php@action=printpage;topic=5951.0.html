				About ten years ago, I regrouted the tiles in my bathroom myself and it wasn&#039;t that hard or expensive. I think I paid about $30 total for the grout and the acrylic ad-mixture that I picked up from Pergament when it was still there on 48th Street. I&#039;m sure you can get everything you need at Home Depot or a local hardware store. It&#039;s a project that can be completed easily in one day just follow the directions on the packages. Hiring a professional to do it is bound to be a lot more expensive, and not come out any better.

				be careful if ou live in an older apartment though, my neighbor&#039;s attempt at regrouting resulted in all the old tiles popping off the wall as soon as he started at it... this is why I have yet to attempt it :(

				Hey Newtownian, where did you buy your grout?&nbsp; Was it a small pint of pre-mixed grout?&nbsp; &nbsp;My attempt at getting the stuff at Home Depot was a nightmare.&nbsp; The place is a madhouse, getting help was frustrating, and the lines are horrible.&nbsp; I just need a little bit of grout, so I don&#039;t want to buy a big ol tub of the stuff.&nbsp; For now, all I have is a tube of silicone sealer, but I&#039;d like some grout.

				I went to the Home depot on 59th and Lex. That place is way chiller than the city one. <br /><br />by the way, you can smooth out the silcone sealer with a piece of saran wrap on your fingertip. I think it comes out great! And definitely mask the joint you are going to use the sealer for. It looks more pro.

				Thanks Newtown.&nbsp; My bad experience was at the Home Depot on Northern blvd and 48th st in Astoria.&nbsp; Anything&#039;s gotta be chiller than that place.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t know there was one at 59th, and thought the one on 23rd was just a showroom.

				I think there is also a Home Depot on 25th ave and 72nd street here in our area- I think it used to be a Home Depot Expo which they closed for lack of business and reopened as its present incarnation. Yes the one on Northern is a bloody nightmare, I really hate going there but since i have a car it is easier than going to the one in Manhattan, besides which the ones in Manhattan don&#039;t have the same selection as the other ones either here in Queens or Brooklyn or on the Island (L.I.) .<br /><br />&nbsp;Anyway my tub area&nbsp; needs a regrouting as well but what it really needed a couple of years ago was a refinishing which I ended up doing myself with a custom paint, specifically formulated for it. It was a royal pain in the ass and it took a total of three days !! because of the wait times in between coats. But it was still cheaper than buying a new tub or having someone come in to do it for us.

				Actually the silicone sealer warnings go on and on about how their product causes cancer and how much of a poison it is if you get it on you.&nbsp; I looked through tons of the tube stuff, and they all had the same horrible warnings.&nbsp; I ended up buying rubber gloves and a face mask just to protect myself.&nbsp; It was pretty scary, the warnings.

				You can do it yourself if you have the time. I did this about a year ago. You can get a grout pulling tool, basically a rough blade with a handle. You just zip it back and forth in the spaces between the tiles. But like someone said above, be careful of loose tiles and scraping the finish of the tiles. It might be wise to have some mortar in case tiles come loose. I used about 10 blades to do a shower with tub. Get some fast setting sanded grout, mix it with water, and using a rubber float fill in the cracks. let it glaze over and usuing a wet sponge wipe clean a few times. Let the grout dry and then seal it with a few coats of grout sealer. It took me about 2 days to get it all done, but it is much cleaner now. You have to reseal every year or so to keep the grout from getting funky. Or you could pay someone! Fun fun.
