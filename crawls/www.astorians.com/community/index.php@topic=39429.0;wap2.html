			A former Associated Supermarket on 21st Ave and 21st street in Astoria has been remodeled and is becoming a Cherry Valley Marketplace.&nbsp; Inside looks real nice now, new registers, fresher produce.&nbsp; <br />The former Associated would have terrible produce, dated milk on the shelves.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Let&#039;s hope that this trend continues. That part of Astoria needs a good quality supermarket.<br /><br />

			I agree that the City Fresh market (formerly Associated) on 21st &amp; Broadway is a big improvement. It&#039;s cleaner, with wider aisles and a somewhat improved selection (produce isn&#039;t always in great shape, for example). The 24 hour schedule is also a plus. However, their prices are getting ridiculous. It seems like every time I shop there, something I bought a few weeks ago is now $.50-$1.00 more. I&#039;ve actually found it cheaper to get certain things from Fresh Direct and Whole Foods.
