				Overall, I think every incumbent should be nervous. <br /><br />In PA, I&#039;m glad Spector lost too. I also think the Democrat voters are pushing back against the Party Establishment and the lose of a populist message by Obama which excited so many people. Who would have thought a year ago that A candidate supported both by Gov Rendell and Pres Obama would have lost. <br /><br />In Arkansas, I&#039;m going to watch the next three weeks with great relish. Especially after the screwed up attempt to vote because she had already asked for/sent back an absentee ballot and was turned away at the voting place.....BTW, evidently is was sent to her VA address.......and here&#039;s a link to her 2 million dollar home. If I was a campaign advertiser, I would have that picture of her home and being turned away in ever voters mind for the runoff election. <br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m sorry Mrs Lincoln, you can&#039;t vote here because you already voted from Virginia.&quot;<br /><br />http://bluearkansasblog.com/?p=2313 (http://bluearkansasblog.com/?p=2313)<br /><br />In Kentucky, I find another interesting race. But, if I was a Kentucky voter, I would be turned off by the fact that Rand Paul is more interested in representing the Tea Party as opposed to representing the state of Kentucky. He mentioned the Tea Party nine times and the state only once. Is he trying to turn off every moderate and swing voter in the state. Again, if I was a campaign Advertiser, I would use that fact against him and lump him with Palin over and over again. <br /><br />BTW, Rand Paul will be on the Maddow show tonight. His father already has been on. A few times I think. <br /><br />Here&#039;s a current link to party numbers. <br />http://thecrossroads.typepad.com/crossroads/2010/04/kentucky-republican-independent-voter-registration-increase.html (http://thecrossroads.typepad.com/crossroads/2010/04/kentucky-republican-independent-voter-registration-increase.html)<br /><br /><br />The surprise for me was the Special Election to replace Murtha in PA-12. I honestly thought it would turn Republican because McCain won it in 2008. <br /><br />BTW, this means that the GOP has not won one Congressional special election. And when it comes to Scott Brown, I still say it was a fluke and it was more because Coakley was outclassed by him and considered her election a shoo-in. Didn&#039;t she go to DC for a fundraiser? While I don&#039;t know baseball, I do know the one thing you don&#039;t do is screw up on a baseball question. How many candidates have stumbled on the &quot;are you a Mets or Yankees fan&quot;?<br /><br />

				<br />Sounds right to me. I felt the 94 class burned a good deal of goodwill and good faith. I think the GOP would like one, but has not found any real working message. I wondered if the GOP could take the House and Senate this year, and it remains to be seen if either takes place.<br /><br />However, there is still a question whether Reid will again be the leader of the Senate.<br /><br />I find it interesting that Obama got his nomination through the primary/caucus process. They should welcome the process continuing. A page was turned in 2008, and I will be glad to see another page turn.<br /><br /><br />Nothing so far changes or affects how I might vote this Nov. Here in NY, I see only maybe one incumbent that I might vote for. Not that they worry about such things. The Supreme Court already will have 2 new nominees so that changes things greatly. I dont care which party controls Congress. I certainly dont want one party to have the White House and nearly 60% of the votes.

				If Reid can get the Financial Reform bill, he may be in a better place back home. Reid is doing badly because he pissed off the Unions, which are strong in Las Vegas. The left loathes him for his pandering to the GOP senators and feel that he has wasted his filibuster proof majority. Not that it really existed because of Moderate Democrats.

				Okay, it was one thing for some Tea Party folks to compare President Obama to Hitler and Stalin, but it is another when the former House Speaker does so:<br /><br />http://thinkprogress.org/2010/05/18/gingrich-hitler-stalin/<br /><br />Also, I think Raul Paul&#039;s remarks are questionable.&nbsp; Is he Libertarian to the point of condoning that businesses allow segregation?&nbsp; He should clarify what he meant in his recent comments.<br /><br />What are everyone&#039;s thoughts on this?

				I&#039;ve been trying to wrap my mind around the Rand Paul &quot;controversy&quot;. <br /><br />When it comes to discrimination by a business, I can see where Rand Paul comes from in this way. <br /><br />At Barnes and Noble we discriminate in favor of those that purchase for 25 dollars a members card. They get 20% off of adult hardcover and get email coupons for 15% on a single item among other perks. Those that do not pay the 25 dollars do not get the same perks. The emails nonmembers get are for just 10%. And the company does that to build loyalty. And studies have proved that owners of the Members Card spends more money on the average. And we are obviously discriminating. <br /><br />And Paul Rand would say that the government should not be able to order Barnes and Noble to give the same discount to every customer. <br /><br />I think the problem for Paul Rand is he stumbled into an area that is clearly settled law and also involves a very painful period of our history. And I&#039;m really puzzled as to why. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				Just one further thought on controlling business.<br /><br />I know that NYC is trying to control the amount of salt a restaurant adds to dishes.....to me that is stupid and silly....but than again, a part of me supports controlling/taxing high fructose corn syrup sodas. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure where to divide the line and am curious what others think. <br /><br />ps....bill, I&#039;m not sure why you were neg nodded....but I love this thread.

				You know, I had no idea who Rand Paul was until this controversy.&nbsp; But in every interview I watch with the guy, he has evaded every question asked of him and will not address the questions directly.&nbsp; It&#039;s a huge turn-off.&nbsp; He is very much a traditional politician in this respect.&nbsp; I don&#039;t trust him because he won&#039;t articulate what he really feels.&nbsp; He answers questions with questions.&nbsp; If Barnes and Noble were denying the perks based on race, I would think that is wrong.&nbsp; If a restaurant denies someone service because of race, that is wrong.&nbsp; If a home owner denies to sell or rent you space because of your race, it&#039;s wrong.&nbsp; He says the federal government should not regulate that.&nbsp; Well if not, then do you mean the state should?&nbsp; He has not said that in the interviews either.&nbsp; He has not said what recourse someone should have regarding racial discrimination.&nbsp; To say that one should not patronize an establishment that engages in these practices is not an answer.&nbsp; It&#039;s a cop out that does not deal with a real problem.&nbsp; And there are plenty of people in the world still full of prejudice unfortunately.

(You may not be able to understand contrary views.) I guess the worry is that there is so much private prejudice that community standards need to intervene. If it is that prevalent, we have bigger worries. If it is not, there is choice among private businesses. <br />[Do you think golf memberships must accept all races and both genders? You may very well. Racists are likely to congregate in any case.]<br />I think though that I am with you that govt was right to be sure public schools in any state accepted students regardless of race.<br />What should be enforced in a Catholic school?<br /><br />K noted settled law and history, I would like to hear him touch on that. Because this is KY, the south, it makes a stronger impression.<br />I think the folks of KY will weigh the risks and rewards of the candidates. [Consider too that Senators ratify Court nominees.] As I have heard from other candidates, he should say that if you discriminate on basis of race, vote for another candidate. He should reject those votes.<br />The primary was just a step. What is the meaning if in the end KY ends with a Democrat Senator and PA ends with a Republican?<br /><br />In NY, folks may not even be aware of their lens. When a Dem is on FoxNews, they are often evasive. Maybe not Ed Rendell or Weiner, bless it.<br />I did not find this link so helpful but listen to these questions on Washington Journal.<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mrHlfOMFlE&amp;feature=related<br /><br /><br />Whoever the Senator, at least they would be only 1 vote of 100. Maybe they can persuade 2-50+ votes in the Senate. But thanks to a system of check and balances, a law needs the signature and enforcement of the President. And the laws need to pass Constitutional concerns under the Supreme Court.<br />While I would not want Randal to represent me or NY, I would like to see Senators like him as a check on the current government.<br /><br />

				Daisy, I mean this as lovingly as possible but I doubt there would be much chance you&#039;d support a guy like Rand Paul in any event.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see you as having much of a Republican streak anytime in the future.&nbsp; I am not too jazzed about Paul myself.&nbsp; Yes, I hope he wins as his overall views are much closer to mine and I&#039;d like to see some checks on Democratic Party power.&nbsp; But his strong associations with the Tea Party are troubling, because they can be very easily spun as a negative.&nbsp; The old tactic of ignorant people casting another group as ignorant because they don&#039;t march in lockstep to the &quot;correct&quot; political ideology.&nbsp; Silencing dissent, if you will.<br /><br />Interesting example Kempster gives with Barnes and Noble&#039;s customer loyalty program.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s discrimination, per se.&nbsp; The way I see it, that is a perfectly legal business arrangement, and there shouldn&#039;t even be a question as to whether the government has the right to intervene (they don&#039;t).&nbsp; As Daisy said, if Barnes were denying people member perks on the basis of race, THAT would be a problem.&nbsp; One interesting and troubling trend is that minority groups on our college campuses are self segregating.&nbsp; But that&#039;s a tangent and best reserved for another thread.<br /><br />By the way, Paul has categorically denied that he will join any efforts to repeal the Civil Rights Act: http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/05/rand-paul-i-will-not-support-any-efforts-to-repeal-the-civil-rights-act-1.php<br />Two thoughts on that: when you have to deny something of that nature, you&#039;re in big trouble.&nbsp; AND, is there such an effort underway that I wasn&#039;t aware of?&nbsp; It seems like a silly statement to issue.

				Oh that&#039;s ok, Billz!&nbsp; I get what you are saying and you are right, I probably wouldn&#039;t.&nbsp; But I was surprised and vaguely amused by his evasiveness in the Rachel Maddow interview and the ABC one I saw today.&nbsp; He kept answering questions with more questions and I started playing a game to see how many times I could count him saying &quot;Now what I find interesting yadda yadda yadda&quot; instead of directly answering the question.&nbsp; And who in the world mentioned repealing the Civil Rights Act to him?&nbsp; Is there even a movement to do so?&nbsp; It&#039;s settled law.&nbsp; The whole thing is so weird.&nbsp; Why would he have to deny supporting such a thing?&nbsp; I&#039;m just not sure why this is even an issue, and why he won&#039;t just answer a question on if he thinks it&#039;s a problem if someone is denied housing over their race.&nbsp; Even if it&#039;s a privately owned house.<br /><br />I realize race is a particularly thorny issue and there are many layers, but if you&#039;re going to say private businesses are able to do whatever they want to people, then you should at least say what legal recourse you would like someone to have, who is denied housing, who is denied service at a restaurant, denied entrance to the golf course, etc. etc.&nbsp; These are real problems that do happen and to allow them to flourish like it&#039;s just ok to have it happen just doesn&#039;t sit well with me.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not happy with a lot of politicians and it&#039;s commonplace for them to evade questions.&nbsp; But if you&#039;re going to make a statement, at least back it up with what you think should happen if said discrimination is taking place.

				I agree that that the more open and direct a candidate is, the better. I have seen candidates boldly answer a question with the &#039;wrong answer&#039;. I did not like the answer but I welcomed the frankness. (Why I think wider spectrums will listen to frank candidates of different parties.)<br /><br />[I want to see how candid court nominee Kagan will be.<br /><br />http://capitaltonight.com/2010/05/now-raises-questions-about-kagans-stance-on-abortion/<br />&nbsp;]<br />The candidate debates in KY, PA and elsewhere may be fascinating. Not so sure if the ones in NY will be worth watching.<br /><br />Not everything has a legal remedy. In some cases, a restaurant or property may not be granted permits if they discriminate on the basis of race.<br />But I think the focus of many in KY is more on the harm of govt intervention than on this issue.<br /><br />It is biased but interesting that Rand finds TEA party events to be 10 x larger than the GOP ones he attends.<br />However, it is a mistake to me if TEA tries to &#039;wall itself off&#039; from dialogue with other viewpoints.<br />Collegiality, discussion, and perhaps even compromise is a large part of work in the US Senate.

				Using the example cited above, most companies discriminate - there are so many out there that reward regular customers.&nbsp; This is so different however, to a shop keeper putting up a sign that says &#039;No Irish / Italians / Jews etc.&#039; <br /><br />Allowing that to happen is taking the Libertarian viewpoint a bit too far, don&#039;t you think?

				I think there may be some confusion.

				Hey TRX, <br /><br />I&#039;m curious as to what you mean by state sponsored marriage.<br /><br />For me, it&#039;s more a matter of being able to address the issues that my partner and I are facing when it comes to things like taxes. <br /><br />I&#039;m not even really pushing for marriage in a religious sense. I view it more as being able to enter into a contract with my partner that will simplify many issues we are facing. For instance, we have a joint investment with a private equity firm that I have no idea how to report on our taxes since they have to be separate. <br /><br />Straight couples are forced to worry about this if they are married. <br />&#039;<br />
