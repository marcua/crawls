				So I&#39;m fast asleep when my phone rings at 5:30 am (I know, it could be off, but it&#39;s also my alarm clock), I see it&#39;s an 800 #, and yes, automatically I&#39;m cursing like a sailor, I mean, who the xxxk calls at friggin 5:30 a from an 800#....and leaves a message, to top it off.&nbsp; &nbsp;:idiot: :ugly: :ticked:&nbsp; <br /><br />so since I&#39;m already awake, I listen to the message <br /><br />It&#39;s the airline (specifically Delta Airlines) letting me know that my flight was delayed by an hour due to mechanical failure already detected on the plane set for my flight two and a half hours later. <br /><br />while I appreciate the call service, I need this direct flight to leave the terminal within reasonable timeliness as I missed the boat on getting the earlier flights (of course that would have meant waking me up at 5am), and they better not cancel or delay this flight any further&nbsp; :ticked: :ticked: :ticked: <br /><br />(to not look like a complete selfish idiot, i&#39;ll self disclose that i&#39;m on my way to visit someone hospitalized and i have to fly by a certain time to get there on time to visit them today)<br /><br />so actually, fxxx, they need to get their act together, i don&#39;t need this stress right now&nbsp; :idiot: :ticked: :idiot: :ticked: :ugly: :crazy:<br />

				Why would they know about such a mechanical failure earlier?&nbsp; (by saying &quot;already detected&quot; it really isn&#39;t clear to me that this was something that would have been known early enough for your satisfaction.)<br /><br />I&#39;d be happy that they at least <em>tried</em> to notify me before I <em>left </em>for the airport.&nbsp; They can&#39;t be expected to know your specific reason for flying.

				At least they called you. AA lets half the plane board before deciding to check for mechanical problems.&nbsp; By the way, they did write me back, I&#39;ll post later about that.
