				Anyone watching?&nbsp; What&#039;d folks think of the first episode?&nbsp; I&#039;m so horrified by some of their selections.&nbsp; I was hoping Jennifer would make it into the house.&nbsp; At least they culled the two certifiably crazy ones, no?

				OK, here&#039;s my take:<br /><br />All of them: Squeaky! All the shrieking and squeaking was a tad annoying. Do they have to scream in unison for every. little. thing?<br /><br />I was surprised at some of the girls who made it. That scrunchy faced blonde barbie? I don&#039;t know her name, but I think it was Kim (ANTM website not working for me right now). Meh. Not big on her, I think she&#039;ll be first to go. <br /><br />The chick from Brooklyn, Lauren, she reminds me of an actress that I can&#039;t remember, and I don&#039;t think she&#039;s going to go too far. Just seemed a little too laissez-faire about everything. <br /><br />I liked Whitney, the plus-sized chick. Just once I want to see a plus-sized girl win this. It seems like they only include them as tokens. <br /><br />Stacy-Ann: Super annoying! <br /><br />Marvita: Gonna lose it at some point and when she does, it&#039;s gonna be GOOD. <br /><br />Fatima: meh. Her face is weirdly asymmetrical and it bothers me. <br /><br />Dominique: looks like a drag queen. She might look a lot better once they give her hair a makeover. <br /><br />Claire: Weird, but I love the androgynous kinds of girls on this show (like Kim from Cycle...7? My all time favorite. Love. Her.). So hot, I&#039;d totally go gay for her. I can&#039;t believe she has a kid and drinks her breast milk. I dunno, to me that&#039;s sort of like picking your nose and eating it. Ew. She also looks completely familiar and I can&#039;t figure out where I could possibly know her from. She&#039;s my pick until she does something really out there. And I&#039;m horribly bad at picking the winners so this means she&#039;ll last until about halfway through. <br /><br />Anya: Also super annoying, not impressed with her look. Kinda generic. <br /><br />Amy #1: Looks old. Has potential if she gets a super hot makeover but she reminds me of psycho old-looking Lisa from Cycle 7. <br /><br />Amy #2: Meh. Generic. <br /><br />Can&#039;t remember who the other two were. I think they&#039;ve found all the pretty girls who can model already and are pretty much going through the motions at this point. But I still can&#039;t stop watching. I have guilt about this. <br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				I&#039;m shocked Ali&#039;s niece got booted, but so happy the crazy 8 time contestant with anger issues is gone.<br />I totally agree on Marvita, she&#039;s a time bomb.<br />Amy #1 looks so much like Lisa, but does she drink like Lisa?&nbsp; :-)<br />My initial thought is that Fatima is going to win it, but it&#039;s so early. <br />Is there anyone they can exploit so shamelessly as Heather last cycle?<br />I just wish they&#039;d kept Jennifer.&nbsp; She had personality and looks.&nbsp; <br />I bet you are right about Dominique - when she gets the make over she might be great.<br />I can&#039;t stand Anya already.&nbsp; What sort of fake accent is that?<br />I like the polish girl with the name I did not catch.<br />Stacy-Ann has personality, but is she really a model?<br />Who are the judges this cycle?&nbsp; (I heard they got rid of Twiggy).

				Judges for this season are Ms. Jay, Nigel Barker, and Paulina Porizkova.<br /><br />I noticed at least four girls from our area: two from Brooklyn, one from Manhattan, and one from Long Island. I can&#039;t remember who is left but it would be great to see a NY show down. <br /><br />I bet Fatima gets kicked off by the producers for smacking someone... hopefully it&#039;s Tyra.<br /><br />Can&#039;t wait to see Rich&#039;s recap on FourFour on Monday: http://fourfour.typepad.com/

				I don&#039;t have cable so I can&#039;t participate in the office convos about Project Runway, but I can most definitely participate in this thread. ANTM is addicting, I have been watching for the last 5 seasons. Did anyone watch Girlicious? Another train wreck that I can&#039;t turn away from.<br />

				Ah, no wonder they can&#039;t stop mentioning Paulina Porizkova, gotta hype the new judge!<br /><br />Looks like there will be major drama at the elimination next week, judging from the previews. I can&#039;t wait!<br /><br />I&#039;m not a regular reader of fourfour, but I do love me some Winston. If only my cat were cute too and not just annoying...<br /><br />And I love Rich&#039;s guest appearances on Jezebel.com&#039;s &quot;Pot Psychology&quot;.

				I love ANTM. And there&#039;s no substitute for it--I&#039;ve tried the British and Canadian versions, but they just dont do it for me. I&#039;ve gotta have the real stuff...I love project runway too...by the way, you can catch up on all th previous seasons of ANTM and the latest project runway episodes on Youtube.

				OK, first--did I call it or did I call it, Kim was the first to go. Although I didn&#039;t foresee the reason. I thought it was going to be her scrunchy face. Girl looked like she was smelling poo. Maybe that was her attitude she was sniffing. I thought Tyra was going to lose her mind when Kim said she wasn&#039;t into fashion, and go off on her like she did with Tiffany that one time. I was a little disappointed; it was a bit anticlimactic.<br /><br />Dominique--whoa. Hair makeover didn&#039;t help. She looks OLD. I&#039;m surprised they kept her around. I totally knew the other chick was going the second they showed her talking about how she had all this experience modeling. Kiss of death on ANTM!<br /><br />My girl-crush on Claire continues. I like what they did with her hair except for the color. Why do they have to make everyone a totally fake blonde? So not cute but she makes it work. Fatima&#039;s hair was better than that orange mess she was rockin before, but I don&#039;t like her. She just rubs me the wrong way for some reason. Very high and mighty, snottitude just emanates from her. And she&#039;s way too skinny. <br /><br />Anya--WTF is that accent? I&#039;ve had friends from Hawaii who were of Asian decent who had similar accents but hers is stronger and it&#039;s just WEIRD coming from a white girl. And again, WTF is with the white-blond hair? <br /><br />I missed the first ten minutes because I overnapped. What challenge did Claire win?<br /><br /><br />

				Claire won a make-up challenge at Wal-Mart with Covergirl.&nbsp; I do like her new hairdo and thought her picture was fine.&nbsp; I actually really liked Marvita&#039;s picture, even though I don&#039;t care for her.<br />I think Tyra was delighted with the drama when they got rid of Allison - she was so shocked and upset - it almost made up for her not going nuts on Kim.&nbsp; I think Dominique is the next to go.<br />You were right on Kim, and good riddance to her!<br />I was surprised Tyra wanted them to make Whitney more fleshy, isn&#039;t that what she would have then complained about?

Inconsistency is the mark of a fake accent. Bet on some vocal training if she makes it far enough in the competition, but I doubt she&#039;ll last past the next two eliminations. <br /><br />I suppose you could also poke around some ANTM message boards to see if there&#039;s anyone who knows her and can confirm/deny the accent. <br />

				Anya did take some good pictures. That accent worked against her, but in reality it&#039;s not that big a deal. How often do you hear most models speak? And it&#039;s not like we ever see anything from a winner of ANTM again, except for the &quot;My Life as a Cover Girl&quot; bits. <br /><br />I liked that Whitney won, was rather dismayed to hear that it might have been set up that way. Both for the possibility that the show was fixed (shocker!! Actually, not really), and for the fact that the accusations of fixing were so fast to fly after the plus-sized model won. As if she couldn&#039;t have won on her own merits. So I was disappointed about that.
