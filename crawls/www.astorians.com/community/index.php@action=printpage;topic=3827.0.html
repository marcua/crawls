				I used to go to American Eye Care Center on Broaway and 38th Street to Doctor Stadlen. He is really nice and I was very happy with him. That being said I switched to a place in Manhattan near my work- for the convenience factor. But I would recommend American Eye Care Center.

And the best part of the place: if you don&#39;t find something you like in their frames section, they will order what you want. Also, when I get my new glasses, I take them to my ophthalmologist, &#39;cause she wants to check them for imperfections and color before I use them, and she has *never* found any problems with them.<br />Dr. Mark Stadlen<br />American Eye Care<br />3803 Broadway<br />Astoria, NY 11103<br />718-956-3000

				For anyone around Ditmars I recommend Odyssey Optical on the west side of the street under the train.&nbsp; I got my glasses there several months ago and was pretty impressed with the overall service.

				Hmmmm... everyone always raves about American Eye Care, but I had a pretty bad experience there. (That is why I am looking for new eye doc in my other post.) When I was pregnant, I noticed that my vision changed and my glasses and contacts weren&#39;t doing the job that they used to. (I consulted with my OB and they said that pregnancy hormones and water weight gain sometimes cause vision changes.) The doctor at American Eye Care insisted that this wasn&#39;t true and there was no way my vision changed that much, even though he did all the eye tests and saw that there was a change. I was literally arguing with him about it. He was pretty obnoxious about it and treated me like I was crazy. At any rate, I ended up having crappy vision all through my pregnancy because of this place, when it could have been corrected. I decided I would never go back there.<br /><br />On the insurance thing-you just pay the bill with your credit card or cash. I have eye coverage, but I still pay the bill and then submit it to my insurance later.

				true, true that during pregnancy you vision can change. i always inform my patients that if they are serious of getting glasses during pregnancy their prescription might change afterward and then need to switch the lenses. then it is at their own risk and everyone knows beforehand. <br />
