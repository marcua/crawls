				Take Root presents mishiDance and Sans Limites Dance <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;mishiDance: Alongside existing works Standing Still | Still Standing and H(a)unted, mishiDance presents a new work that explores the simultaneously isolated and shared experience of commuting. Inspired by the heavily structured poetry form of villanelles, Standing Still | Still Standing follows one woman&#039;s journey to create new identity after coping with loss. H(a)unted, described as &quot;a raw and emotional journey&quot; by Dance Examiner, explores how the different types of ghosts we encounter throughout our lives, literal and figurative, manifest themselves to haunt us.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Sans Limites Dance: in my end is my beginning, choreographed by Diana Pettersen of Sans Limites Dance, continuously grapples with gravity: fighting against it, giving into it, becoming over-powered by it, and, almost inconceivably, re-emerging from it. Resulting explorations of balance and unbalance conjure the physical, mental, and emotional challenges of contending with life&#039;s highs and lows. The piece concludes with a harrowing, yet precious solo by a figure that seems to have successfully emerged, for at least a short moment, from the grip of gravity. Shakily, but surely achieving self-possession, this figure embodies ungainliness with an unearthly grace.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;March 17 &amp; 18, 2017 at 8pm<br />&nbsp;Admission: $15<br />&nbsp;Green Space Studio<br />&nbsp;37-24 24th Street, #301<br />&nbsp;Long Island City, NY 11101<br />&nbsp;718-956-3037<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Tickets are available at the door or online at http://www.greenspacestudio.org/TakeRoot.html<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Take Root is a monthly curated series that supports dance makers by providing an opportunity to show a half evening work paired with another artist.
