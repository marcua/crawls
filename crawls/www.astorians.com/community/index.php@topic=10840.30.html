For how much longer was the site admin going to censor astorialogues if he hadn&#039;t been caught? For how long had it been censored?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ve answered this question but will do it again here. I did so (in a moment of poor taste perhaps, and immaturity) sometime in the evening of June 10 after an astorialogues promotional post had been bumped more than once. After the second time I removed the duplicate posting and &quot;broke&quot; the link temporarily. (Noting that the many &quot;active&quot; members turn word censoring off, while most non active members never adjust their settings.) The link was broken for some members (and those posting/bumping links) for a period of less than 24 hours because by the next afternoon I had &quot;fixed&quot; it. I didn&#039;t intend to leave it indefinitely, just long enough to stop what I considered spamming.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">After trials, people found guilty of committing crimes get to apologize for what they&#039;ve done.<br /><br />For example, the site owner went out of his way to praise a Freezepeach promoter(spammer?) ... On the other hand, a thread (which was started by a member of both of our sites) about astorialogues (showing love for a NON-commercial enterprise) was &quot;moved&quot; to the commercial part of the site almost immediately. Once there, a single bump resulted in post-deletions, a person being suspended, and the name &quot;astorialogues&quot; being censored site-wide. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />First off, the Freeze Peach thread wasn&#039;t exactly just a &quot;promotional&quot; piece, by the time I actually read and responded to the thread (11 hours after it was started) it had already become a &quot;conversation&quot; about how this person&#039;s tone was negatively affecting the cafe. I wasn&#039;t praising or defending the promoter, I was just saying that it wasn&#039;t the end of the world. From what I was able to glean on my own this person isn&#039;t an owner, founder, or attached to the cafe in any way other than volunteering for it on one occasion. Besides, even according to my most vitriolic critics the thread wasn&#039;t very promotional for the cafe anyway. If I&#039;d have moved the thread I&#039;m sure I&#039;d be criticized by the same for &quot;silently&quot; moving it to hide any negative comments about the cafe. I moved the Astorialogues thread because first off it was posted on the politics board as promotion of another website. Second, I perceived the OP of that thread as one of the founders of that site (a fact that she denies). When I saw the thread (a few hours after the post) it hadn&#039;t generated any non-promotional &quot;conversation&quot; and made more sense to me in the business listings section than in &quot;politics&quot;. This was the difference I perceived at the time. <br /><br />Frequently we will 1) remove completely or 2) re categorize threads that are solely promotion of another website (promote their own blogs, link promotionally to their website etc). Links to, and discussions about local businesses are more difficult to categorize imho because these are often not just an advertisement, but invoke lots of discussion from the patrons of that place both positive and negative.<br /><br />It was my act of re-categorizing this one misplaced astorialogues thread that prompted the start of this vitriolic and abusive thread on astorialogues 10 days ago. Ironically, this comes after <strong>two other posts</strong> that were appropriately categorized on Astorians remained in place pointing to Astorialogues. Yet it&#039;s angrily claimed that I&#039;m coming out from the shadows to &quot;censor&quot; knowledge of the site. If indeed that was my interest don&#039;t you think I&#039;d just permanently ban my critics, and remove all references to the site?<br /><br />Of course for a hand full of people the answer is &quot;no&quot; because it&#039;s too simple and not sinister enough. It&#039;s a lot more fun (and I think that&#039;s evidenced in the thread on Astorialogues) to create a huge controversy at my (and other member&#039;s expense) to try and drive people away from Astorians. There is no reasoning with this kind of argumentation, it&#039;s not a discussion, the &quot;facts&quot; don&#039;t matter because with every post from me describing my actions and mindset at the time of those actions comes only more name calling and distortions. What matters is keeping this issue alive an at the top of the thread list on Astorians for as long as possible.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The intense negative feedback you are receiving has everything to do with your moderating approach and nothing to do with the people who make up Astorians or Astorialogues.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This intensive negative feedback is coming from a hand full of people who are upset about two things. 1) mis-cateorization of a thread (even though I left two other astorialogues posts that were properly categorized in their respective spots on more heavily trafficed areas of the site). 2) over my removing of the &quot;u&quot; for some users over a period of less than 24 hours. &quot;Other&quot; negative feedback is primarily due to my enforcement of the rule of no name calling on the site - a rule that a few people can&#039;t seem to manage when it comes to the discussion of politics.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You&#039;re focusing too much on the names the site owner is being called and too little on the underlying causes of people&#039;s dissatisfaction.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s individuals that use the politics section that are the most dissatisfied. This was the reason that Astorialogues was started, because its now founding members had all been temporarily suspended in the past as a result of violating the rules on the politics board.<br /><br />For the record. According to Google Analytics, in terms of Unique Page Views the politics section of this board makes up 0.64% of this site&#039;s total traffic (by comparison the business listings section makes up for 0.37% of the site&#039;s total UPV.) Yet, as I&#039;ve said before, the politics section makes up for approximately 90% of all user suspensions. The remaining areas of the site (especially Local Chat, Restaurants etc) comprise a huge bulk of site traffic, drive the most conversation, require little if any input from moderators, and result in the fewest problems between members. You&#039;ve heard of the 80/20 rule, in this case it&#039;s more like 90/1. Something like 90% of the moderator issues, come from about 1% of the monthly site traffic (not exact numbers, but hopefully a fair representation of my perspective).<br /><br />Please understand that from my perspective the problems that exist in the area of politics are not representative of the site as a whole, and that while I&#039;m committed to finding a way to promote a consistent user experience for all board members, I&#039;m not willing to allow a hand full of people who insist on being able to call each other &quot;racists&quot; and &quot;bigots&quot; &quot;assholes&quot; and &quot;nazis&quot; to set the tone for the entire site unless the tone of the entire site indeed organically shifts. Over 4 years of running this site the bulk of users of Astorians consistently reaffirm that they find the rules and moderation activities in general to be acceptable (although I&#039;ll be the first to admit there are problem areas, and I&#039;m committed to improving these.)<br /><br />It&#039;s difficult to please everyone, and this is why I can genuienly say that I&#039;m glad there&#039;s another place for anyone to go who is less than satisfied with the rules or application of the rules here. I believe that the addition of Astorialogues to the community will make the discussion in Astoria more diverse, and can make Astorians better for it. For anyone who is attracted to what Astorialogues has to offer, please know that there is no hostility towards members of that (or both) sites. All are welcome as long as they abide by the rules they agreed to upon signup.<br /><br />In conclusion I do hope that Astorialogues finds a way to build community without tearing others down.</div>

The re-spelling would not affect people who have the &quot;censor words&quot; function turned off, and it will not affect anyone now because it is no longer being censored. Many people didn&#039;t know there was a &quot;censor words&quot; function that was set to &quot;yes&quot; by default, hence the confusion about the link being misspelled for certain people. I don&#039;t know how to be any clearer about that. I can&#039;t say anything else about this without simply repeating myself, so that&#039;s probably going to be all from me on this. </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_133519">I&#039;ve been reading this thread with great interest. Though it&#039;s obvious that many people who&#039;ve posted feel passionately I&#039;m still trying to work out what exactly are the motivations driving people. For what it&#039;s worth here&#039;s my perspective.<br /><br /><br />Astorians.com is essentially an online publication covering Astoria , a highly-interactive one yes, but in essence it’s a magazine where contributing writers (i.e., the users) provide the content (i.e., the threads) within a set of editorial guidelines (i.e., the rules) set by the owner and editor-in-chief of the publication (i.e., merm) and the editors (i.e., moderators). <br /><br />Some feel the editorial guidelines or ‘The Rules’ are too loose, some think they are too strict, others feel they too arbitrarily enforced. You can’t please everyone.<br /><br />As previous comments have noted, if the editorial guidelines are not to a contributor’s liking, he or she is under no obligation to contribute. It’s not mandatory. <br /><br />If the editor-in-chief or subeditors object to something that a contributor has written – it their prerogative to either edit it or delete it from the publication or in the case of astorians.com, since it is published in real-time, ban the contributor from further contributions for a period of time.<br /><br />This is a community-minded publication but it is not governed by the community. The rules are not “law” and no one he has “rights.” I don’t see the point in debating rules and their enforcement (or non-enforcement) from the point of view of &#039;that&#039;s not fair&#039; or cries of censorship because when it comes down to it, what merm says goes as far as I’m concerned, whether it thought to be fair or not.<br /><br />Astorians.com does not exist to promote the cause of freedom of speech. It is a privately-owned electronic publication that not only serves those who contribute but many, many others who read, but choose not to post comments. Merm has to consider these readers as well. I think that&#039;s what many of you forget. As editor-in-chief he has to think about the bigger picture -- it&#039;s not all about the needs of the contributors.<br /><br />As a writer and contributor, you may feel you’re being censored when your posts are edited or your user priviledges curtailed, which is not surprising because you are being censored. But it’s not your publication and you’re more than free to contribute to another one of your choosing or better yet start your own and write anything you wish to.<br /><br />Let me pose this question: Have any of you ever written for a newspaper, journal or magazine? have you ever had a letter to the editor published? Do you think you have the right to have your words published without any oversight from those in charge of the publication? It&#039;s both naive and laughable if you think you do.<br /><br /><br /><br />Merm – I think you and the moderators have done a fantastic job with this website, outstanding actually. You’ve been more than fair in the handling of the contributors in my opinion. Because it&#039;s in the interest of astorians.com for you to do. Contrary to what some people think, you wield a very, very light editorial hand in trying to keep this site fair and enjoyable to EVERYONE (sorry for the caps but it&#039;s an important point).<br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_133941">Jennifer you&#039;re right, its not exactly like a magazine but I think the model as I describe is an apt description of what astorians.com is. In my eyes it&#039;s still a highly interactive publication, covering all things Astoria. The content is provided by the users of the site, who also steer the direction, instead a staff of professional writers and editors. It&#039;s one step beyond a site such as gothamist.com where a core group of editors supply the postings and users provide only commentary.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_134133">Some members here probably construe expressions of anger at merm&#039;s recent moderating behavior as attacks on Astorians, too. The Astorians community rocks and is worth defending. None of this has anything to do with my lacking respect, even affection, for the community merm has made possible here. :mrgreen:<br /><br />Somewhat ironically, it was while <a href="index.php@topic=9507.0.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"> <strong>arguing in favor of keeping Politics on this board and defending fellow Astorians</strong></a> that I first found myself in a serious disagreement with merm.<br /><br />Merm&#039;s controversial choices and our exchanges back in February made me think more seriously about what I like about internet forums.&nbsp; After some reflection, I decided to experiment with creating a community forum, but one which would emphasize freedom of expression, personal responsibility, and voluntary moderation. I wanted to find out if my forum ideals would work as well in practice as I had reasoned they should. This project, astorialogues, is three-months old. Its origins were neither bitter nor vindictive, quite the contrary. <br /><br />Some early members of my site who were also Astorians decided to post about its existence here. Until June 11th, there were three mentions of astorialogues on Astorians amidst over 130,000 posts. <br /><br />link=topic=10840.msg133405#msg133405 date=1213456147]<br />In conclusion I do hope that Astorialogues finds a way to build community without tearing others down.<br />[/quote] <br /><br />:-o Baiting.<br /><br />I had nothing to do with this thread-bumping thing, Merm, but I&#039;d say it wasn&#039;t tearing anything down. <a href="../index.php@board=7.0.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Look at the the Business and Classifieds section</a>. The &quot;Politics Without Censors&quot; thread was moved there in mid March. There are threads with &quot;Last Posts&quot; dating back to mid January on the first page. The bump moved the topic up half a page. Merm decided this should result in a temporary suspension.&nbsp; :? And though months had ticked by without any tensions between these two forums, Merm then censored my site&#039;s name. For fun. To annoy an already suspended member?&nbsp; :?<br /><br />That&#039;s what ignited the emotional backlash against merm. <br /><br />Not helping matters is Merm&#039;s escalating response to the backlash: his decision to insinuate that astorialogues&#039; members (most of whom are Astorians, too) (1) want to believe the worst of him, (2) think attacking him is fun, (3) are deliberately attempting to drive people away from Astorians, (4) cannot be reasoned with and don&#039;t care about facts, and (5) want to keep this controversy going because it serves astorialogues.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Clearly, people holding a variety of opinions care about this discussion. (People who don&#039;t care about it should take their apathy elsewhere instead of trivializing this discussion.) This thread has been kept alive mostly by people who agree with merm. I&#039;m posting now, somewhat reluctantly, because there are misrepresentations that I won&#039;t let stand uncorrected.<br /><br />My main concern is that an accurate depiction of recent events prevails. To that end: <br /><br />1. I accept merm&#039;s sensible explanation for moving the &quot;Politics Without Censors&quot; (PWC) thread to the Businesses and Classifieds section. But he did this three months ago. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=10840.msg133405#msg133405">Quote from: merm on June 14, 2008, 11:09:07 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> It was my act of re-categorizing this one misplaced astorialogues thread that prompted the start of this vitriolic and abusive thread on astorialogues 10 days ago.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No. See above for how this whole thing got started. People are not angry based on something as trivial as moving a thread in midMarch, but rather on specific things merm has done and said about what he&#039;s done since June 4th.<br /><br />2. The OP of the PWC thread, Jennifer, is not denying a &quot;fact&quot; when she denies having anything to do with founding astorialogues. I developed and launched astorialogues alone. I didn&#039;t talk to anyone but my wife about it beforehand. <br /><br />3. Merm&#039;s acknowledgments regarding his censoring &quot;astorialogues&quot; have been upsetting, odd, and inconsistent. Here is his first response. <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=9775.msg132856.html#msg132856">Quote from: merm on June 11, 2008, 08:53:07 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I just added astorialoges to the filter for fun the other day when the thread got bumped (again) by someone who is trying to drive traffic to the site. It was a little tit-for-tat bumping is all, maybe distasteful - but not meant to be harmful.<br /><br />For the record, I think it&#039;s great there&#039;s another Astoria site out there. Just wish that we didn&#039;t need to re-bump this thread to build traffic over there. It&#039;s sort of annoying (kinda like broken links maybe?). :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The most recent acknowledgement is different.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=10840.msg133405#msg133405">Quote from: merm on June 14, 2008, 11:09:07 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I did so (in a moment of poor taste perhaps, and immaturity) sometime in the evening of June 10 after an astorialogues promotional post had been bumped more than once. After the second time I removed the duplicate posting and &quot;broke&quot; the link temporarily. (Noting that the many &quot;active&quot; members turn word censoring off, while most non active members never adjust their settings.) The link was broken for some members (and those posting/bumping links) for a period of less than 24 hours because by the next afternoon I had &quot;fixed&quot; it. I didn&#039;t intend to leave it indefinitely, just long enough to stop what I considered spamming.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />From &quot;the other day&quot; to &quot;less than 24 hours?&quot; From &#039;for fun/to annoy a thread bumper&#039; to a countermeasure in defense of Astorians against spamming? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">&quot;Spamming is the abuse of electronic messaging systems to indiscriminately send unsolicited bulk messages.&quot;</a> <strong>Astorians was not being spammed by anyone, let alone astorialogues.</strong> It is not reasonable to suggest that the word censoring was provoked or in any way a rational choice.<br /><br />4. Merm has stated that he is surprised about the harsh reactions to him even after his apologies. The apologies are so nuanced, so qualified, always stressing his intentions as if those should be more important than his actions and their effects. Merm doesn&#039;t convey that he appreciates that censoring astorialogues was, itself, wrong. And his refrain that what he did was &quot;no big deal&quot; invalidates the feelings of the people to whom he is apologizing. It&#039;s infuriating. <br /><br />***<br /><br />Truth and facts matter no less on the internet than in the real world. </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_134157">I think I understand what you are saying.<br /><br />My personal belief is that the discussion of board policy thread will help make the board rules and regulations more clear and concise.&nbsp; I think the discussion is helping make clear what actions will result in suspensions and how the process can be improved.&nbsp; I know Merm and I are both reading the rules thread carefully and once discussion is complete, we, and the Astorians.com community, can come up with some proposals to make things work even better than they currently are working.&nbsp; Opening lines of communication and getting reaction has been helpful.<br /><br />Personally, I have always thought discussion here has been very open and the moderation fairly light (focusing on moving threads to the right area and keeping discussion civil), but hearing new perspectives have been helpful.&nbsp; I do think the actual number of folks who have received even one suspension is low, and usually I believe suspensions happen only once as people learn where the boundaries are and what type of remarks get a person in trouble.&nbsp; It&#039;s very easy to get heated in discussions, online or in real life, and I&#039;ve always personally felt more comfortable having some semblance of order, but I have heard that some people have had issues with some suspensions, which has certainly given me a lot about which to think.<br /><br />I do wonder, however, if the goal was to have discussion of the suspension policy and moderator operations, and that is now happening, what the point about revisiting the astorialogues issue might be.&nbsp; </div>

Two different issues and the people who are interested in helping you create new board policies about moderation are not necessarily the same ones who are addressing the issue about the censoring that occurred.<br /></div>
