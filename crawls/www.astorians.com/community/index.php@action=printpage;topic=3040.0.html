				Hey all,<br /><br />I have a very old desktop PC (circa 1998) that&#39;s gotta go.&nbsp; It&#39;s much too slow and cumbersome to do me any good any longer.<br /><br />1. Does someone here want it?&nbsp; It needs to vacate my house in the next couple days so holla back soon.&nbsp; Also, this does make me nervous because I don&#39;t feel like taking the time to wipe the hard drive...I was going to go with the &#39;hammer method&#39;...so feel free to convince me of your kind ways.<br /><br />2. If nobody wants it (which I&#39;m going to assume), do I have any legal responsiblity to recycle it in NYC?&nbsp; If I just put it out with the trash will the garbage men take it away?<br /><br />Thanks so much for any advice!<br /><br />Adam<br />

				I think rather than putting it in a trash bag and then putting it into a trash can, you could possibly set it out by the road as if it was furniture.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure how legal that is though, but these things seem to be rarely enforced.

				i bet if you just leave it out on the street w/ a sign that says &quot;free computer&quot; someone will take it w/in the hour.&nbsp; take out the HD if you&#39;re nervous about privacy

				Maybe you can donate it to a small nonprofit or something, that could get use out of it. Craigslist probably has listings of nonprofits looking for donations. <br /><br />I&#39;m not sure what the legalities are, but I&#39;d imagine it&#39;s best environmentally to recycle if possible.

				Maybe you could tie the cord of the monitor together with the cord of the computer, and throw it over a power line like the kids do with sneekers. :lol:

				I have a Dell 15&quot; CRT monitor (black) free for the taking.&nbsp; I used it for maybe three months way back when I first got my old computer in 2002.&nbsp; I know, it&#39;s a dated model, what with the proliferation of groovy flat panels, but it&#39;s in top-notch shape.&nbsp; Free.&nbsp; Just pick it up.&nbsp; 23rd Street at 31st Ave.<br /><br />Otherwise, I guess I&#39;ll have to leave it on the curb (with a &quot;free monitor&quot; sign taped to it&nbsp; :wink:).

				Hmm...thanks for the link to your post.&nbsp; I searched, but somehow missed that one.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it&#39;s not just convenience (I also have a car) keeping me from recycling.&nbsp; It&#39;s mostly space.&nbsp; I&#39;m getting some new furniture next week and have to purge quite a bit to fit it in.&nbsp; Maybe I&#39;ll see if I can put up with it until late September...<br /><br />Thanks for the links!
