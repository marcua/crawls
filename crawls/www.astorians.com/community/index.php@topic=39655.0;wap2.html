			Hey Asstorians!!<br />I&#039;m looking fro recommendations for a tattoo parlor in the hood (actually more for a tattoo artist and the studio where he/she works).<br />I&#039;ve got a so so experience with supernova (artist was too rough and bold with lines, lots of scars, etc...) and definitely a better one with John from Queens ink, but he left now. There are a bunch of new places that opened in the past year but I&#039;d like a recommendation from someone who actually anything done. I&#039;m looking into a thin precise geometric work, just to clarify what kind of workmanship I&#039;m looking for.<br />Thanks in advance lads!!
