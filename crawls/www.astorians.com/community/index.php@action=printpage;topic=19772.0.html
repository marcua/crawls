				For the past few days Akti has been closed with a notice on the door saying they&#039;ve been operating illegally.&nbsp; Anybody know what the backstory is?&nbsp; &nbsp;:-o

				Aliada has the same notice on its door.&nbsp; From what I can gather by their note, either their sidewalk seating area was illegal or they forgot to renew the license/permit for said area.

				I ate there once shortly before it first opened and it might have been the best fish I ever had.&nbsp; And it was packed.&nbsp; Sadly, it seems to be closed.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are those stickers on the window saying the &quot;marshall&#039;s have seized the premises&quot; and an itemized list of all the backrent due.&nbsp; &nbsp;Months and months listed at $7K per month, with late penalties tacked on.<br /><br />If it doesn&#039;t reopen it will be sad news.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad I had a chance to eat there at least once.

				The Lollipop candy store that was there before gave up the premises when the landlord raised the rent from $3,000 to $7,000 a month. I never saw Akti busy enough to be able to afford such a high rent. They were semi-busy Friday through Sunday, and very slow during the regular week. It was probably just a matter of time.

				Yeah - it was good but never crowded.&nbsp; I was there on a weekend and there was one other table occupied.&nbsp; I guess it was inevitable.<br /><br />

				I just saw the space listed as for rent in one of the real estate magazine of Queens.<br /><br />I know 30th Avenue is popular but $7K/month is ridiculous.&nbsp; I have to wonder about the reasoning of the landlord - was it worth all that lost back rent and now the vacancy?&nbsp; That&#039;s lost money he&#039;ll never get back, regardless of the tax break.&nbsp;
