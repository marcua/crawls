				Hello all, I&#039;m new to the area and was thinking of going to Gantry park to see the Macy&#039;s fireworks on July 4th. Am I being too much of a tourist or is it worth it to fight the crowds to see them? <br /><br />thanks all!

				Everywhere you go, it gets a bit crazy.&nbsp; We have gone a couple of times and it gets crowded in Long Island City.&nbsp; I prefer the Friday night fireworks, although not nearly as spectacular, right here in Astoria.&nbsp; It is quite nice, and you can have a picnic in Astoria Park!

				I have not seen a 4th of July fireworks show in over 10 years, anywhere!&nbsp; It&#039;s just too bad that I work every year on this day setting up a show and am too busy shooting the show from below that I don&#039;t get to see it.&nbsp; Would like to be able to see one sometime in the future.

				If you&#039;ve never been, the show is worth it.&nbsp; It&#039;s quite pretty and it&#039;s a long show.&nbsp; LIC or the FDR would be great for viewing, just very crowded.&nbsp; But that will be everywhere.&nbsp;

				make a friend in LIC with a rooftop.&nbsp; I&#039;ve watched from the roof of a fellow syracusan for the last couple years and it&#039;s been awesome.&nbsp; I hate parades, but love fireworks.&nbsp; Go figure...

				Please see last year&#039;s post about watching fireworks from Gantry Plaza<br />http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=2421.0<br /><br />There are fireworks at Astoria Park on Friday, June 29th. I went last year and although they weren&#039;t Macy&#039;s, there were fun to watch. I had a blanket set up on the lawn and was able to have a nice picnic before and during the fireworks. Lots of families and cops were there, so I wasn&#039;t afraid to be in Astoria Park after dark. <br />

				I just called Eric Gioia&#039;s office to ask them to ensure that Gantry State Park and the piers are open to the public this year.

				turns out we have a practically perfect, albeit far, view of the fireworks on our brand new fire escape. that was a pleasant surprise as i haven&#039;t been able to do something like that since the management company of my old building (where i grew up) banned us from making the annual pilgrimage to the roof.<br />
