				I'm not TOO worried about a transit strike, but if I don't work I don't get paid, and I'd rather have an arrangement to fork over some gas money to a neighbor than to just hope that I can hire a car if I need to. &nbsp;<br /><br />Does anyone else in this neighborhood commute to downtown manhattan and have a car? &nbsp; <br /><br />Or is anyone else in a similar situation?

				I'm in a similar pinch. &nbsp;So count me in for car pooling. &nbsp;Now, if I only had a car...

				I'd love to split car service costs if anyone works evenings in midtown (or really anywhere from midtown to southern Manhattan).<br /><br />My company pays for my car service home at midnight so I only need one way.

				that's a good idea.<br /><br />sometimes in bad weather i have a rough time getting a car. &nbsp;but if there are a few of us working on getting a car together we might have better luck. &nbsp;and more fun!<br /><br /><br />in a pinch, we could always pinch in and rent a car together.

				I just sent an email to those who have signed up and then realized that it might be best to carry on the discussion here. &nbsp;<br /><br />Here's an idea. &nbsp;<br /><br />What if we call a car service beforehand, schedule a car, and make arrangements to meet up friday morning. &nbsp;If the trains are running, it will be easy to cancel the car. &nbsp;If trains are not running, we're totally covered and won't have to spend hours on the phone yelling at car companies.<br /><br />What do you guys think? &nbsp;I just don't want to spend hours waiting for a car and in traffic to get to work and get there at, say 3.00. &nbsp;Also considering going in early-ish to beat what is sure to be nasty traffic.<br /><br />Pressing questions:<br />Where/When shall we meet?<br /><br />Is it ok to all share cell #s? &nbsp;I think you all have mine but i would not want to be the only point of contact. &nbsp;If I get oks from everyone I will distribute #s.

				Enigmacat, thanks for letting me know about this thread. &nbsp;I don't mind giving you my phone numbers or taking anyone else's -- whatever helps. &nbsp;Let me know how to email you with my numbers? &nbsp;Or tell me best way to do this. &nbsp;Thanks again.<br /><br />Renee

				Good luck with your alternate driving plans. &nbsp;I hope you can give us a report of your experience on Friday, that is, if the strike happens. &nbsp;I don't envy you being in that traffic, though. &nbsp;I fear it may be worse that LA and SF combined. &nbsp;I don't know what I'm going to do as far as getting to work, hopefully working from home...

				I'm not a commuter but you should consider planning roundtrips -- ie, arranging pick up in town as well. &nbsp;I imagine getting home from work will be just as difficult as getting TO work (if not moreso).<br /><br />Car services should pick up from Manhattan as well, no?<br /><br />cheers,<br />jayme

				Only cars with 4 people in them (minimum) will be allowed into Manhattan. &nbsp;I wonder if that applies to car services and taxis? &nbsp;If so, a car service originating from Manhattan would have to be called, I guess.<br /><br />This whole thing is frighteningly exciting. &nbsp;I may feel differently about it on Friday, though.

				Absolutely!<br />http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/13/nyregion/13strike.html<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, warning that a transit strike would seriously hurt the city's economy, announced yesterday that <strong>only cars with at least four people would be allowed to enter Manhattan south of 96th Street on weekday mornings</strong> if bus and subway workers walk off the job on Friday.<br /><br />Starting times for city schools would be delayed by two hours to allow children time to get to school, and several streets, including much of Fifth and Madison Avenues, would be closed to all but emergency vehicles, according to an affidavit the city filed in court yesterday.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />On a second look, it sounds like only mornings have the prohibitive approach. &nbsp;But I agree that the evening commute will be horrendous as well.<br /><br />I mapped my route and it's only ~6 miles to work. &nbsp;I could walk that in an hour and a half, so that's my contingency plan. &nbsp;Or HOT stay home and telecommute!

				6 miles in this weather? &nbsp;i think you should telecommute. &nbsp;or pile into the car with us.
