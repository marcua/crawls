				Hi everyone,<br /><br /><br />I am trying to determine if there is interest in the neighborhood to start a Hacker Scouts guild.&nbsp; It&#039;s for children of all ages to get together regularly and learn a variety of skills and do hands-on activities in science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics.&nbsp; Kids can learn all about things like electronics, computer programming, robotics, 3d printing, laser cutting, building and designing things, all while earning badges.<br /><br /><br />If you want more information about what Hacker Scouts is, you can learn more here: http://hacker-scouts.org/<br /><br /><br />In the mean time, contact me if you think this is something you would want your children to be involved in.&nbsp; This is all very preliminary, and there is a good deal of planning and organization left to do, but the very first step, I think, is to see if others are interested.<br /><br /><br />Cheers.

				I just wanted to provide an update based on where my planning is so far, and to give a bit more information to those who might be interested.<br /><br /><br />Here is a list of the things I need to secure before this can really get going.&nbsp; Consider this a call to the community to help build something great for our neighborhood kids.<br /><br /><br />1. A hackerspace.&nbsp; This will ideally be a room available, either for free or for low cost, that can be reserved for about 3 hours per week, preferably on the weekends.&nbsp; It needs to have things like tables and chairs, plentiful power outlets for equipment, and adequate ventilation, which is necessary whenever we are using soldering irons.&nbsp; Ideas for meeting locations are most welcome.&nbsp; Options I am considering: Queens Library (both the Broadway and Steinway branches) and Steinway Reformed Church, which has space it rents or lends to groups.&nbsp; If you think you know of a place that would be friendly to this, or if you know of any existing hackerspaces in Astoria, let me know.<br /><br /><br />2. Mentors.&nbsp; We will need people who have expertise in things like electronics, robotics, woodworking, and/or any number of other skills related to making, DIY, design, and arts.&nbsp; If you have these skills and would be willing to mentor 8-14 year old children who have begun learning how to use a soldering iron and other tools, I will be most interested to speak with you.<br /><br /><br />Now, as for the additional information about the program:<br /><br /><br />Hacker Scouts is relatively new.&nbsp; It began in San Francisco, and seems to be spreading.&nbsp; The program I am planning to start is for 8-14 year old children.&nbsp; There is a program for children 4-7 planned, but it is not complete yet.&nbsp; Anyway, the children will begin with a project that will take them multiple meetings to complete, during which time they successively build skills.&nbsp; This means that regular attendance is essential for success.&nbsp; As they complete projects, they earn badges, and because each project requires the use of diverse skills, the children will learn to rely on one another to fill in any gaps in their own knowledge and abilities.&nbsp; This allows them to learn from one another while building partnerships through teamwork.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Mentors, who are experts or who have significant experience in a particular topic, will help the children gain new skills.&nbsp; They may dedicate as little or as much time as they wish to guiding the children.&nbsp; There are many opportunities for mentors to share their passion for a topic, and I would encourage anyone who is interested to contact me.<br /><br /><br />And finally, parent involvement is expected.&nbsp; If you are a parent who is interested and considering this program, let me reassure you that you do not need to have any special technical skills to be involved in what your children are doing.&nbsp; There are other ways you can contribute, including providing snacks, documenting meetings, fundraising, managing equipment and supplies, and more.&nbsp; One of the goals of Hacker Scouts is to build community, which can only be done if we work together.<br /><br /><br />If anyone on this board is interested in getting involved in the early stages, or if you can help point me to some important resources, I am eager to hear from you.&nbsp;
