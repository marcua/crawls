				We have a room that will be available for someone to move in to July 1st or earlier (maybe even before June 15th!). I will start showing the apartment on June 4th, so if you are interested contact me so that we can set up a time for you to see the apartment. <br /><br />The room is $800 a month with a deposit of $800. Cable and Utilities are split four ways. <br /><br />The Apt: <br />It is a four bedroom apartment. We use the fourth room for storage. The apartment has stayed pretty clean and we are looking for a roommate that will help keep it that way. We have a living room, dining area, kitchen, and a bathroom. <br /><br />We also have cable, as well as a wireless cable modem. We have Showtime, HBO, Cinemax, and the free On-Demand Channels as well. So, if you want a relaxing night in to veg out and watch a movie, there is always something on. <br /><br />The apartment is located on the second floor, above a store front. There is only one other apartment in our building, which has a nice family living in it. We have a small gated area on the street that we sometimes cook out in during the summer. <br /><br />In the kitchen we have pots, pans, dishes glasses, and appliances so a person doesn&#039;t have to bring any of those items! <br /><br />There is also great water pressure in the bathroom… and the shower has been called Niagara Falls because of it! And there is never a line for the bathroom! <br /><br />The Room: <br />The room is 12.5’ x 9.5’ and has four large windows. The room has a walk-in closet in the hall way that is 5.9’ x 3.1’ and 8’ high. It’s great if you have things to store or have a lot of clothes! <br /><br />About US: <br />There are three of us, but since the apartment is big we don&#039;t have any problems and there is rarely a wait for the shower. I am in my early 30s and I work in film/television production. We have an opera singer who lives with us that is in his early 30s as well. We also have a German girl living with us that is in her late 20s and she is a nanny. We are all very down-to-earth and laid-back. We sometimes hang out and go to events with each other, and would like to include the new person too. We are not looking for a best friend, but we are looking for a roommate that we can get along with and talk to. <br /><br />The type of person we are looking for: <br />We would like to find a roommate that is clean, quiet, respectful, friendly, out-going, responsible, mature... and fun. We are looking for a NON-SMOKER. If you are up for grabbing a drink every once in awhile that would be great too. We will consider males and females. We are looking for someone LONG TERM….NOT short term. We just don’t have the time to go through the process of finding a roommate over again. <br /><br />IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN SEEING THE PLACE... please send us an email telling us a little bit about yourself. Also please provide your contact information, so that we can reach you. <br /><br />Again... we will start showing the apartment on June 4th!
