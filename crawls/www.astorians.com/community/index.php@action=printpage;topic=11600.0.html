				If you are one of the many women (or men) living in Astoria who have struggled to find a great salon for cut, color and great customer service, look no further.<br /><br />No, I am not being paid to post this message.&nbsp; I am simply a woman who has tried just about every salon in Astoria, spent all kinds of money, only to have my hair burnt, broken and cut into unrecognizable layers.<br /><br />Let&#039;s face it without a great cut (or color) it does not matter what you wear - you will look awful.<br /><br />Well, on someones recommendation, I happened upon New Image Salon and it was the best decision I ever made.&nbsp; But don&#039;t take my word for it.&nbsp; Go in there, sit down and just watch the stylists in action.&nbsp; See the great color, cuts and styles that all the stylists turn out.<br /><br />Now I happent to use someone by the name of &quot;Jen&quot;.&nbsp; She took my haircut, previously butchered by a stylist in another salon, and transformed it.&nbsp; I was completely amazed at what she was able to do with such a mess.&nbsp; For the record, I have short, very curly hair, one side more than the other, cowlicks in the front top of my head and some at the nap of my neck.&nbsp; Yet, when I walked out of the salon I looked amazing.&nbsp; I got compliments at work all day long the next day.&nbsp; Jen is talented beyond words.&nbsp; This is true of all their stylists.&nbsp; <br /><br />You can just tell from watching the stylists in action that they stay on the cutting edge of what&#039;s out there.&nbsp; I sat there one day and watched Demetri put long extensions on a woman and was amazed at how beautiful they looked.&nbsp; In addition, the quality of their products for color, shampoo/conditioners and styling products, etc. is amazing.&nbsp; <br /><br />How great does it feel to have someone shampoo your hair and massage your head with precision?&nbsp; That&#039;s what you get from Rosie and Gina.<br /><br />And what about customer service?&nbsp; The best customer service I have gotten in just about any store in Astoria is at this salon.&nbsp; You feel appreciated and welcome.&nbsp; It is clear that the owners care about their customers.<br /><br />Now some of you might be asking, well for this quality their prices must be through the roof.&nbsp; Absolutely not true.&nbsp; I was amazed at their prices.&nbsp; So reasonable.&nbsp; They have packaged prices for combinations such as cut, color and styling.&nbsp; What I paid for all of that is what I paid just for color in SPA Salon.<br /><br />Going to a hair salon should be a fun, relaxing experience.&nbsp; For me, New Image lives up to their name.&nbsp; You will always walk out looking better than you ever expected, feeling happy and relaxed. <br /><br />Hope to see you there.<br /><br />Judy B<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I want to add to the positive reviews. I went there for the first time yesterday. I had a color &amp; cut done by Rosie and Dimitri respectively. It&#039;s true, they do listen to what you want. I had some funky ideas requested by my husband. Dimitri was suspicious, but in the end he did as I asked and everyone liked the results. I&#039;m thrilled with my hair, and the cost was great. $63 for all! I was sure I&#039;d be spending more. I will definitely be going back to this salon again.

				Hmmm, I stopped in last night and was charged $80 for color + cut (trim) + blow dry. They made it sound like the blow dry was thrown in (I normally skip it altogether, as I don&#039;t care for the pin-straight look.) <br /><br />Stopped into Nubia the other day to ask for a price list, and they said there&#039;s a 10% discount for first-timers, maybe I&#039;ll try them next time and compare results.
