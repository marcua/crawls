			Hello to all Astorians, architecture and history lovers![/size]After seeing the neighborhood I was raised in so rapidly altered, I decided to begin documenting the soon to be destroyed buildings, signs and architecture. I began a project titled &#039;Ancient Astoria&#039; and would love to reach out and share the page with you all!Please feel free to share any photos you may have or ideas of any soon to be demolished buildings! This thread can also help new neighbors to see Astoria&#039;s history. I&#039;m looking forward to sharing memories !Please follow us for daily updates and throwbacks!Instagram.com/AncientAstoriaFacebook.com/AncientAstoria
