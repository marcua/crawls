				Zimmerman, who was armed, called the cops on an unarmed kid, then chased him down the street, and ended up shooting him in the head.

				I&#039;m kinda wondering why this topic is on the main forum.&nbsp; I&#039;m assuming it has to do with gun use in our area???<br />If that&#039;s the case, I&#039;m glad we don&#039;t have a &quot;stand your ground&quot; law here in NYC.&nbsp; Could you imagine?<br />Here&#039;s the way I picture it:&nbsp; I&#039;m walking with my kids towards Ditmars.&nbsp; Suddenly, a group of kids (&quot;of color&quot;, naturally**)&nbsp; turns the corner of the cross street.&nbsp; Maybe thier from St.John&#039;s Prep, maybe they&#039;re from the neighborhood...who knows.&nbsp; All male, all wearing pants so low thier underwear hangs out, Yankee baseball cap with the tags still showing, wifebeater shirt or oversized t-shirt; standard uniform for &quot;the youth&quot; nowadays.&nbsp; Some are about a-buck-and-change in size, but there&#039;s always one big one who&#039;s about 6-feet or larger.&nbsp; <br />I get nervous; I&#039;m outnumbered and with my children, I feel like my kids are in danger.&nbsp; I yell out, &quot;THEY&#039;RE CHARGIN&#039; RIGHT FOR US!!!!!!!&quot;, which then leads me to take out my semi-automatic (carried in a concealed leather holster; for comfort and style, naturally) and just mow them all down.<br />Under the &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws, a person need only have a &quot;reasonable&quot; measure that they are in danger.&nbsp; And as any lawyer can tell you, &quot;reasonable&quot; can mean just about anything.&nbsp; Any lawyer worth thier salt can find a jury of people who would feel threatend by the site of a group (not just one kid) all wearing &quot;the uniform&quot; comming right at them and deem that fear as &quot;reasonable&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;And mind you all, I did yell out &quot;THEY&#039;RE CHARGING RIGHT FOR US!!!&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;Who&#039;s to say I&#039;m wrong.&nbsp; &nbsp;There may be an eyewitness, and there may not be one.&nbsp; They may have not bothered to even look my way and verify if what I said was true.&nbsp; &nbsp;But they sure heard me yell, and when the shots rang out, they headed for cover.&nbsp; Unless someone was taping, there&#039;s no way to verify for sure if my statement was accurate or not.&nbsp; Maybe it was&#039;nt true...and maybe it was.&nbsp; &nbsp;Either way, I&#039;m got my &quot;reasonable&quot; grounds covered.<br />Sound ridiculous?&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, actually, play the scene out for a second.&nbsp; You&#039;ll see that no, it&#039;s not so outlandish.&nbsp; I&#039;m protecting my family.&nbsp; I have no prior record.&nbsp; The kids I shot fit into a nice stereotype which would lead others to sympathize with my &quot;reasonable&quot; feeling. I have no reason to lie; nothing to gain (or maybe I do).&nbsp; &nbsp;I can find a jury to at least deadlock...so I walk.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t matter what I did; I can play the victim just as much as the kids I shot. <br />I can see this picture happening wayyyyyyyyyy too much here in NYC; with people using this &quot;extension&quot; of self-defense as a means to a detrimental end.&nbsp; No way should we adopt this rule.&nbsp; No....freakin&#039;.....way.<br />_________________________<br />*Before anyone gets on my case about not being PC, I happen to be a person of color.&nbsp;

				There a several points that trouble me here. First, you sound like it&#039;s okay to kill another human being if you&#039;re in a fist fight.

				In parts of country where guns ownership is easy, crime is low.&nbsp; Upstate New York has higher gun ownership percentage, but lower gun killing&nbsp; &nbsp;percentage.&nbsp; In Switzerland, gun ownership was mandatory , might still be.&nbsp; Every male over age 18 HAS&nbsp; to own an assault type rifle, since they have no army. Yet&nbsp; drive bys and shootings over parking&nbsp; spots are almost&nbsp; &nbsp;non existent.&nbsp; &nbsp; It&#039;s the type of people we have here and in some other major cities, not the gun ownership.

				Considering Zimmerman was just brought back into custody because he allegedly lied about his finances and passport, his credibility about what went down with Martin is seriously shot to hell. The man is an absolute moron --&nbsp; 1) Jail house calls to anyone BUT your lawyer are almost always recorded -- don&#039;t talk about anything other than the weather, 2) When you&#039;ve got a case in which you absolutely must testify to defend yourself, don&#039;t ruin your credibility by lying under oath, and 3) (and here&#039;s the most important one) don&#039;t ever piss off the judge. Lying, especially about money, will piss off a judge to no end. <br /><br />I suspect they&#039;ll re-release him, but with a much higher bond and require him to turn in the other passport (which his lawyer took the fall for). <br /><br />I&#039;d hate to have to pick the jury on this case -- with the amount of media coverage and how people have already determined guilt and innocence, it&#039;ll be virtually impossible to panel an impartial jury.<br /><br /><br /><br />

For me, as I watched the debate unfold, what they were asking for was their day in court. And rightly so. Even the local detective thought charges should be brought up. <br />Ultimately, can anyone justify a kid dying for walking down the wrong block?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It is ok to kill someone if you are in mortal danger.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t a fist fight, it was a one sided beatdown in which Martin was on top of Zimmerman, according to witnesses.&nbsp; Zimmerman apparently screamed for help about 14 times as Trayvon mercilessly rained blows down upon him.&nbsp; Martin didn&#039;t die for walking down the wrong block, he died for what he did after that and for his faulty assumption that Zimmerman was unable to defend himself.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=22855.msg223809.html#msg223809">Quote from: King of Long Island City on June 03, 2012, 05:08:07 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />Correct me if I&#039;m wrong, didn&#039;t the police tell Zimmerman not to follow Martin? <br /><br /><br />So Zimmerman is chasing after Martin, with a gun, why, exactly? What was he expecting would happen? <br /><br /><br />Martin&#039;s dead, so we don&#039;t have his side of the story; but had Zimmerman just stayed inside and not attempted to enact vigilante justice against someone who wasn&#039;t breaking the law, or bothering him at the time the incident began, Martin would be alive and no one would know who Zimmerman is.<br /><br /><br />Following someone with and asking for a fight, over nothing, doesn&#039;t justify shooting them, in my opinion.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It has been documented that Zimmerman and his neighbors personally witnessed groups of teens (of various races) commit petty crimes in the neighborhood.&nbsp; In fact, one of the kids who Zimmerman witnessed got away before the police could arrive, hence his somewhat overzealous pursuit of Martin.&nbsp; However, no one has suggested that he &quot;chased&quot; Martin in the sense you seem to imply.&nbsp; He may have followed him, but people seem to buy into this idea that Zimmerman chased Martin from behind and shot him in the back.<br /><br />What actually happened, based on witness statements, is that Zimmerman walked back in the direction of his car at which point Martin exchanged words with him and then commenced to savagely beat him.&nbsp; What happened prior to that is totally irrelevant.&nbsp; The police told Zimmerman to head back to his car for his own protection--apparently they were right, as Martin&#039;s violent outburst illustrates.&nbsp; However, Zimmerman&#039;s failure to immediately returning to his car does not justify Martin&#039;s actions.&nbsp; Nor does it erase the fact that Martin was initially the violent aggressor.<br /><br />Zimmerman&#039;s actions in following Martin might warrant a stern &quot;hey, not cool man.&quot;&nbsp; Whereas Martin&#039;s actions were criminal.&nbsp; He was only innocent up to the point that he started beating Zimmerman.
