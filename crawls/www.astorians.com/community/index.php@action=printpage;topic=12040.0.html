				In response to recent hate crimes, the community is rallying against hate at 1:00 on September 7 in Athens Park.&nbsp; See below for details. . . .<br /><br />Media Advisory<br /><br />FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE <br /><br /><br />PRESS CONTACT:&nbsp; Marisa Ragonese, Program Director of Generation Q <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at 718-204-5955 or MRagonese@QueensCommunityHouse.org <br /><br /><br />Astoria Residents Hold March Against Hate&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />On Sunday, September 7th at 1:00pm, several Astoria Civic Groups under the umbrella coalition, Astorians United Against Hate Crimes, will hold a March Against Hate in response to the July 7th assault on gay and transgender residents of Carmen’s Place who were targeted because of their gender and sexual orientation, as well as Reverend Louis Braxton Jr., the priest who runs Carmen’s Place, who was also attacked after his attempt to defend the youth.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br /><br />The event will begin at 1pm with a rally, featuring speakers and musicians, at Athens Park, located at 30th Avenue and 30th Street in Astoria.&nbsp; At 2:30pm, the group will begin to march down 30th Avenue to Steinway Street, ending with a moment of silence in front of Carmen’s Place, located at 31-14 Steinway Street. <br /><br /><br />Astorians United Against Hate Crimes is an ad hoc coalition that includes Generation Q of the Queens Community House, Astorians for Peace and Justice, the Long Island City Alliance, the National Lawyers Guild New York City Chapter, Democracy for New York City, members of Astoria Is For Obama, and any other community members who wish to respond to the assault. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />“I shouldn’t have to feel afraid to walk down the street with my partner because of people who don’t want to accept homosexuality,” says Shanel Ford, a 17 year-old Astoria resident and member of Generation Q.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Join us as community members stand up in support of the diversity that makes Astoria special.&nbsp; Contact Marisa Ragonese, Program Director of Generation Q at 718-204-5955 for more information about the rally and march. To get to Athens Park, take the N or W train to the 30th Avenue stop.&nbsp; Athens Park is one block from the train station&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />
