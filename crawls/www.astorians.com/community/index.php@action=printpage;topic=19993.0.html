				we ended up finding a great new apartment&nbsp; ..a bit more then we hoped to spend but at least we are out of the cat hoarders from hell house(on top of the cat stench they were spraying something constantly to try to cover it up that was worse then the cat stink believe it or not)..my husband had to walk by there yesterday and the new tenants had their windows thrown wide open so they must be choking already..cant believe the landlord has the nerve to rent that place knowing he has a big problem in the basement<br /><br />I will never ever rent in a private family home again..what a nightmare..this has cost us thousands of dollars...movers again, new bedding/pillows, had to send out all the clothes to laundry and/or dry cleaning, medical expenses for me(one ER visit, 2 doc visits and medications) etc etc etc&nbsp; Hopefully the stink will come out of our leather furniture but that remains a big question mark still. <br /><br />well at least this new place is fabulous and it seems to all be working out in the end :)<br /><br />

				we keep asking ourselves that too!&nbsp; <br /><br />When we looked at the apartment the weather was pretty cool and dry and the heat was set very low in there. seems as soon as we got there once the heat was on an odor started to permeate(spelling sorry!) the air..about a week or 2 in it rained very hard and got warm out..the next day the apartment had this thick odor of cat stench and once we started complaining to the landlord that something smelled(we thought originally it was carpet in entryway) they started spraying something that made it worse.&nbsp; believe me we are shocked ourselves at how we didnt notice it too but you seriously could not get a breath of fresh air in there ..the odor from cats and whatever they were spraying to mask it seeped into everything :(
