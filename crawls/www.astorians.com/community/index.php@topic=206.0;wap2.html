			yah, but maybe you get to drink as much pop and coffee as you want!<br /><br /><br /><br />and maybe, if you are never late or sick, after a coupla months &nbsp;they'll raise you up to like $6.25... WOW. I have heard about things like this happening before. <br /><br /><br /><br />don't forget - they might have a REALLY KICKIN &nbsp;christmas party! you would only have to hold out for twelve more months to find out.<br /><br /><br /><br />oooh, and don't forget. if you are the only one around, and there's a phone there. you could call all your friends while they are out FOR FREE!<br /><br /><br /><br />see. NOW you're sorry you didn't make the call guys, huh. <br /><br /><br /><br />OK OK. it was a crappy suggestion. i got myself through a year of college on a 5.75/hr. all night bagel bakery gig... &nbsp;now look what i have done. perpetuated the acceptance of unacceptably low slavewage jobs.<br /><br /><br /><br />i beg forgiveness<br /><br /><br /><br />ff
