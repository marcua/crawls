				OK, good. My roommates and I were all falling asleep (more accurately, one roommate went out to get coffee, one went back to using her computer, and I sat there staring at the TV blankly and started talking to my other roommate when he went back to rehashing his talking points). He seemed to have spent over 5 minutes on average answering every question. I felt like I was watching the first two debates, except there was no time limit. And I figured the reaction to the press conference would be universally negative, so then I go to Huffington Post to see what his most ardent fans were saying. They of course thought it was great. Obama apparently has as many nutty, diehard supporters as Bush did. <br /><br />It&#039;s weird because I&#039;ve seen his other news conferences since the inauguration, and all seemed much more fluid than this one. Not sure what happened here. It was like he was campaigning all over again.

				Alex, it wasn&#039;t that I was looking for excitement in watching Obama&#039;s news conference. It was that he kept going back to things he&#039;d already said a bunch of times already. He would answer the reporter&#039;s question in maybe 4-5 sentences and then go on for a few minutes about other things that may or may not have been directly related to what was asked. It struck me as indulgent and self-serving, and it got to the point where I was able to predict the ending to just about every sentence he began. I wanted him to take more questions, not prattle on endlessly and redundantly. I hope this was a case of nerves and not a case of his trying to talk for such a long time in order to avoid more questions.

				While I did expect more concise responses from Obama, and on some questions more direct answers, I thought that overall his answers and comments were descriptive, at times overly so. He would respond to the reporter and then go further on to a related subject. And yes I did watch the entire press conference.

I&#039;ve seen several press conferences with Obama where he seemed very comfortable. This one was the complete opposite of those. So maybe he was just really nervous about this one because it was his first <em>prime time</em> press conference? I don&#039;t buy it, and really I&#039;m not interested in excuses related to his being inexperienced, especially when it comes to talking to the press. But we&#039;ll see how his next one goes.

Jindal would give a response. Wondering if there would be substance there.<br /><br />Throwing much in this sink. Very early in this administration, independents still give Obama preliminary good marks.<br />Even quite a number of GOP voters give Obama modest support. [I am sure it varies depending on the issue]<br /><br />I think that as far as good marks, it would start with his diplomatic team and with their early focus.<br /><br />***<br />I like Crudele&#039;s take on deficit spending<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> It&#039;s like a guy who goes on a lights-out binge drinking spree and then pledges only to get incoherently drunk in the future. Sure, it&#039;s better to just be drunk but neither is healthy.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />***<br />OT - our NY governor is considered to be weak at this time. So I am curious for a local poll how many expect to vote in 2010 for Gov. Paterson? How many would rather see another candidate in the Dem primary, whether Cuomo or otherwise?<br />How many would like to see a challenger to the Dems, whether to Paterson or to Cuomo or to another Dem?

				<br />What is up with the online ad:<br />Do you regret voting for Obama?<br /><br />I have a hard time imagining as yet that those who voted for Obama would not do so again.<br />**<br /><br />These columns have been highlighted.<br />http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/06/opinion/06brooks.html<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">On Tuesday, I wrote that the Obama budget is a liberal, big government document that should make moderates nervous. The column generated a large positive response from moderate Obama supporters who are anxious about where the administration is headed.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/03/opinion/03brooks.html<br />A moderate manifesto.<br /><br /><br />Bush went years before he issued a veto and generally left an agenda to Congress. It will be very interesting when the time comes that Obama issues a veto.
