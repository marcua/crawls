				Has anyone been to this new place on Hoyt?&nbsp; It&#39;s about a block down from the Astoria Blvd. subway stop.&nbsp; It&#39;s been sitting unopened for a few years.&nbsp; Now it&#39;s finally open for business.&nbsp; It&#39;s a good location for a decent pub.&nbsp; Lots of foot traffic on Hoyt and more to come when Eagle becomes occupied (I&#39;m not starting anything or suggesting I&#39;m in favor of the Eagle conversion!).&nbsp; However, it&#39;s next door to a partially abandoned building that seems occupied by the homeless.&nbsp; Also, I was told it&#39;s owned by the same owner as the bar Tsolias which is further down on Hoyt.&nbsp; Tsolias is scary on a good day.&nbsp; These things make me wonder how hot this Hot Spot can possibly be.&nbsp; If anyone dares to open the door and go in, please report back - in detail.

				Oh, the red hot spot to cast your lot is with old D-K-E.<br />She puts up joy without alloy, at a very moderate fee!<br />There&#39;s nothing loud about her crowd, they&#39;re screamers all the saaaaame,<br />They cut the sod and carry the hod and build the house of fame.

				This mystery hot spot has been baffling me for ages b/c I pass by on a daily basis. Finally saw actual PEOPLE&nbsp; :-o coming in/out one night about a week ago.........then it went quiet again. <br /><br />Seems cheezy all right, from the name to the sign to the bland mirrored windows. And the only other businesses on that block, between that cafe with the patio to the new bodega up to the Hot Spot, are indeed scary. But once you get to Nebuta, things are mostly :mrgreen: again.

				I love Telly&#39;s Taverna for Great fish!!! The lady owner is so nice she makes everyone feel at home.&nbsp; I cant even get fish this fresh in the most expensive Fish places in Manhattan.&nbsp; Trattoria is also a good place to eat.&nbsp; A great cafe is Grand on 30th Avenue.&nbsp; I think that the atmosphere is terrific.

				I started this so I&#39;ll submit my review after actually going in the place.&nbsp; I was pleasantly surprised.&nbsp; VERY friendly staff.&nbsp; We had a great bartender.&nbsp; Young female.&nbsp; Very friendly and knew her drinks and how to make them.&nbsp; Spoke perfect English.&nbsp; I say these things because I find this not to be the case at many Astoria bars.&nbsp; The decor is almost comical.&nbsp; They spent a lot of time and money on the place but the taste is somewhat garish.&nbsp; It&#39;s colorful.&nbsp; I can say that much.&nbsp; An awkward looking ceramic tile floor and tons of chrome tables and chairs.&nbsp; Who will sit there, I have no idea.&nbsp; It&#39;s not a restaurant.&nbsp; But expecting something far worse, the place is really not all that bad.&nbsp; They have a great jukebox (in terms of selection) but you need a user manual to operate it.&nbsp; And it gets worse after each drink.&nbsp; I would give it a shot if you live in the area of the Astoria Blvd subway stop.&nbsp; The semi abandoned building adjacent to it still puts a damper on the whole experience.&nbsp; (When will they finally bulldoze that mess?)But they&#39;re trying and they did a pretty good job.&nbsp; I hope it makes it and draws a decent after work crowd.&nbsp; There is also a huge screen TV for sports fans but it&#39;s hardly a sports bar.&nbsp;

				Was there a crowd at all?&nbsp; I&#39;m looking for someplace to have my birthday party in January (basically just anywhere that will accomodate 20-30 people hanging out) and it would be awfully convenient to my home.&nbsp; I did the Beer Garden downstairs last year and it didn&#39;t work out so well.

				It was pretty empty, so they&#39;d probably be thrilled to have 20-30 people in there.&nbsp; Give them a call and see what they can work out for you.&nbsp; They do have a brand new kitchen, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s open yet.&nbsp;

				Hmmm, chrome and ceramic tile........ :? Odd. Something contemporary but comfortable would be nice. Not too upscale, but enough so that the local drunks and fratboys aren&#39;t as interested. <br /><br />Downtown Manhattan (Delancy St. stop) there&#39;s a bar serving $5 bottles of Leffe. Do we have such a thing around here, and why the hell not?
