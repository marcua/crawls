			Looking for some good suggestions as my queue is getting low.<br /><br /><br />What have been your favorites over the last few years?

			Not yet.&nbsp; Working through season 2 of Orange is the New Black now and am enjoying it.&nbsp; I&#039;m slowly working through Breaking Bad, and will be working to catch up with Scandal this weekend.

			It&#039;s a few years old, but we recently started Californication and are enjoying it. I like that it&#039;s a quick (25-30 minute) show. Sometimes I don&#039;t feel like watching tv for a full hour (of course, other days I&#039;ll marathon shows for the entire afternoon).<br /><br />American Horror Story is also fan-freaking-tastic if you haven&#039;t seen that yet.

			Amazon Prime has opened me up to the old HBO shows that are amazing. Six Feet Under is a favorite for me, and I just started watching Oz.<br /><br /><br />On the lighter side, I have been watching Magnum PI on Netflix. <br /><br /><br />Otherwise, very excited that Brooklyn 99 just started up again, I think just last night, so should be on Hulu today or tomorrow....funniest new show I&#039;ve seen in a while.
