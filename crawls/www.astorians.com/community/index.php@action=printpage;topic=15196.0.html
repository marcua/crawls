				Friends of my dad&#039;s mentioned a great seafood place called Captain&#039;s Table (I believe) not far from Queensboro Plaza, on one of the sidestreets.<br /><br />Never heard of it before, but they say they love it. Anybody here ever been?

				I think it&#039;s on 36th Ave. near 33rd street, more or less.&nbsp; <br /><br />I went there a few years ago with some friends.&nbsp; I thought it was an overpriced fried seafood nightmare.&nbsp; Really expensive for a plate of greasy, over-breaded rubberized seafood.&nbsp; <br /><br />This was at least 4 years ago - maybe they have a new cook?&nbsp; Couldn&#039;t figure out how the place stayed in business.&nbsp; There may have been other things on the menu, I don&#039;t generally eat fried food.&nbsp; The place definitely made an impression on me.

				Wow, really??&nbsp; :-o The recommendation comes from people who know from Greek food! <br /><br />Then again, the Greeks do seem to enjoy their oil. We ate at Stamatis the other night, and it was quite oil-laden. Still delicious, not fried, just plenty of oil.

				My one experience eating there was similar to geowrld&#039;s. I had heard of the place years ago - probably from newspaper write-ups - my impression was that the place is a neighborhood institution. That could have been Western Queens Gazette hype, or maybe that&#039;s code for &quot;the service is indifferent and the food isn&#039;t that good, and yet people keep coming.&quot;<br /><br />It&#039;s been several years (or more) since, and I believe the place changed hands sometime along the way. If you hear good things from someone who ate there recently, it could be worth a try.

				When they told me about this place, my first thought was, &quot;How come nobody on Astorians has mentioned it before?&quot;&nbsp; :? If it were THAT good, it would&#039;ve come up in a seafood thread, and we&#039;d have tried it by now.

				http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=9907.0<br /><br />Greek Captain.&nbsp; See the thread above.&nbsp; Personally, I like the place.&nbsp; It&#039;s under new management as of 08/09.&nbsp; So maybe some people want to try it again.&nbsp; We found it to be very good, fresh seafood with no frills.&nbsp; I did order a fried seafood dish and did not find it greasy.&nbsp; The service was prompt and friendly.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a fancy dining experience.&nbsp; It&#039;s just a basic seafood meal.&nbsp; And we thought the prices matched the food and the lack of atmosphere.&nbsp; In other words, very reasonable.

				I also really enjoyed Greek Captain last time I was there (ok, so it was maybe 3 years ago). I usually don&#039;t order fried fish, so can&#039;t say it was too greasy-- my grilled fish was always decent. As said, it&#039;s no frills, fairly basic. Most dishes were about $15 for the whole fish. You can order it grilled, fried or broiled and you receive garlic bread, a salad and a carb choice (potatoes, rice or fries). For about $15 I always thought it was an amazing deal and good, fresh fish. And sure, they prepare all the fish the same (with olive oil, garlic and red peppers) but for the price, who cares. From what I can remember there aren&#039;t really any apps, no dessert, and fairly horrible house wine, but it&#039;s the fish!<br /><br />Not sure if prices have gone up and since I haven&#039;t been in 3 years and cannot say anything about the new ownership but I would recommend it (at least once to try). :mrgreen:

				one thing i notice about astoria is that all the greeks (especially the non-english speaking) will rave about any greek owned restaurant no matter how bad it is.<br />have never been to greek captain, but i&#039;ve heard good things, but no reviews from personal friends who&#039;ve been there, so i&#039;ve never made the trip myself.<br />stamatis is f-ing disgusting.&nbsp; the reason they don&#039;t care about how their food is one of astorias unspoken secrets, which i will not divulge on this board.

				Thank you! I thought Stamatis was gross too when I went! The food is tasteless and presentation was horrible. Not that I care about presentation, but it can help a bad meal at least look good.
