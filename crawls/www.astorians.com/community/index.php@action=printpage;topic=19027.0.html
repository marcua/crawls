				I volunteer for an animal shelter. We do Adoption parties at pet stores all over Queens. Is there any onterest in doing one at/near Astoria Park? There is a really cool pet store on Ditmars between 19th and 21st streets, and they may be willing to help/sponsor the event. But I really want to get feedback first, so if you think this is a good idea, or want to adopt a pet, give me some feedback. BTW-we are NOT a non-profit group, we just work to get animals adopted. The kitten fee is $25 for one OR two, and the dog fee is about $75. And they are all fixed, vaccinated, microchipped and have their rabies shots(if they are old enough). We did an event over on Vernon blvd. and 49th Ave last week, and got EVERY ANIMAL ADOPTED. Can Astoria help us and save some animals? Let&#039;s see...

				What shelter do you work for?&nbsp; Is there a website?&nbsp; I&#039;m probably unable to adopt for another couple months but would love to get on a mailing list or know where the shelter is so I could find out more info when I&#039;m ready.&nbsp; $25 is much more reasonable than $300 the vet on 21st Ave seems to be charging for his kittens - I&#039;m leery of them because I&#039;ve read really bad things about that vet on Yelp.

				If this is the same vet i think you are talking about his misdiagnosis/rush to surgery led to my dog&#039;s slow demise over a summer about 15 years ago, This is not slander/hearsay, this was advised by the Animal Medical Center where my dog ultimately passed away...

				Kurt - you are absolutely right.&nbsp; Sorry about that - just got a bit carried away with memories when I read the other posts. As a matter of fact, I am interested in adopting a dog or cat.&nbsp; I have one of each (elderly) at home...some new blood would perk them up I think. Either Astoria or Long Island City sounds great for an adoption fair.&nbsp; Bibi

				I certainly didn&#039;t mean to start a controversy. &nbsp;That vet is on 21st Ave and 23rd st area and has another office on Broadway which is where I saw the bad reviews on Yelp. &nbsp;The one on 21st ave has a sign in the window advertising kittens for an adoption fee of $300 which includes vaccines and shots, but no word on neutering. &nbsp;That just seemed like a lot of money to me and kept me from inquiring about the kittens.<br /><br />Back on topic - <br />I think the adoption event is a great idea but I would advertise and seek feedback for it on more than just this forum. &nbsp;Try http://www.whyleaveastoria.com/ and other neighborhood websites, Facebook groups, Meetup groups etc. &nbsp; I think you&#039;re likely to get more response if you widen your search. &nbsp;Ran Raycraft from WLA is a great guy and I&#039;m sure he&#039;d be happy to help promote the event on his site.

				Sounds like good cause, if new owners are screened. A few months ago a group was going through Astoria Park with pitbulls and pitbull mixes--nice friendly ones.&nbsp; &nbsp;However they were just ready to give them away, no questions asked.&nbsp; One dog had flakes all over, they could not agree on what it was, dandruff or skin problem.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />ASPCA or other professional groups are best, I&#039;m not knocking this adoption&nbsp; drive, just hope it is done right.&nbsp; If Kurt could give more info and details it would clear things up.&nbsp; Kurt&#039;s cause is good one, don&#039;t mean to sound like I&#039;m giving you a cross examination here Kurt.&nbsp; :-)

				Okay, just to clear things up- we DO screen our adopters, and we DO make home visits. If you don&#039;t have screens on your window, forget it. If you heave a balcony without a fence, forget it. we require 2 forms of ID, photo and proof of address. And WE are NOT a non-profit group-we simply take sick and very young kittens from Animal Care and Control and foster them until they are old and healthy enough to be adopted. We DO NOT solicit donations, although many times people will make a donation in lieu of adopting an animal from us.<br /><br />And the $25 adoption fee goes directly to Animal Care and Control, NOT us. The shelter provides all of the animals medical needs and surgery, and we provide the rest-food, litter, and TLC and socializing. AND we will provide paperwork for the kitten so you know where you are actually adopting it from. I know it seems like an odd concept, giving our money and time away to help save animals that are going to be adopted by total strangers, but once you look into the eyes of a sick little kitten, and they stare back at you with nothing but love and trust, it&#039;s kind of hard to just turn your back on them when saving them is an option. <br /><br />Whatever, we will do it or we won&#039;t, we&#039;ll see what happens.

Just an animal lover that as seen too many people use them for profits and don&#039;t really care about the animals. Sadly we live in a time that there are people who think animals don&#039;t matter and only see them as either a product to make money or a nuesence. By you stating you are a for profit agancy just brings up a red flag because of what is around in the area. I have grown up with animals and now my daughter is learning the same way I did. I did not mean to insult you but as with most boards, if someone asks you a question its better to answer on the board. Remember there are a lot of people reading this and don&#039;t know you sent a PM to the author of the poriginal post.

				Glad we could clear this up. Now-is there ANY interest in doing an adoption event??? We need feedback so we can decide where to do the post-holiday weekend event!!! We have a LOT of kittens that are going to be fixed at the end of August, and we need to know where we are going to do this event. We need to make arrangements with a store, fliers to hand out, online announcements, and a whole lot of other work needs to be done. Just because we love animals and we love finding them homes, instead of...the alternative.

				Sounds like a great cause to me.&nbsp; Would be interested!&nbsp; We have been waiting for a while for a kitten to adopt because she had ringworm and we got a devastating call yesterday that she was killed by a rescue pit that knows how to get out of his own cage and into hers.&nbsp; Horrible news and so devastating because she was a beautiful little kitten that loved to be &quot;loved&quot;.&nbsp; She had a home and never got to &quot;meet&quot; all of us.
