				I&#039;m sure a lot of you know me and have read here and there that I bought a house, well I&#039;m leaving my apartment to my son and there will be a room available in July.<br /><br />The apartment is on Ditmars right across the street from Astoria Park.&nbsp; We&#039;re looking for a non smoker (no 420 in building or apartment sorry) that is not allergic to cats.&nbsp; Even though I&#039;m taking my cat with me, he did live there for 5 years so that may be a problem for anyone allergic to cats.&nbsp; The building does not allow cats or dogs, I had one because it was an agreement I made with the landlord when I originally moved in.<br /><br />So in a nutshell:<br /><br />No smoking<br />No 420<br />No pets<br />No loud music or parties<br />No in and out of people<br /><br />What we&#039;re looking for is:<br />Somone with a job <br />Someone quiet<br />Someone neat (doesn&#039;t have to be a clean freak but not a slob either / somewhere inbetween)<br />Male or female is fine<br />Please be a mature and responsible adult.<br /><br /><br />The rent is $800.00, utilities included, telephone is not included.<br /><br />If interested PM me, apartment will be ready for viewing on June 15 (It&#039;s a mess now because I&#039;m packing up, I want to have the stuff I&#039;m taking out).<br /><br /><br />Click here to see a slide of the apt. http://www.slide.com/r/7DjoprKH3j-uSbieB5bKseu45r1creFr?previous_view=mscd_embedded_url&amp;view=original (http://www.slide.com/r/7DjoprKH3j-uSbieB5bKseu45r1creFr?previous_view=mscd_embedded_url&amp;view=original)<br />

				The apartment is listed in Craigs but we haven&#039;t had one person come to see the apartment.&nbsp; A few appointments made but all of them cancelled.<br /><br />Times are bad...so what we&#039;re doing is including electricity and telephone (which has long distance anywhere in the U.S.) to the rent.&nbsp; So basically the only thing to pay for is internet.<br /><br />So here&#039;s the ad in craigslist, take a look, you can reach me by PM, or you can email my son at richieledude@gmail.com<br /><br />http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/roo/1222181518.html

				Liz,<br /><br />If I rented a room different from where I live my better half might be led to believe that things are wrong in our relationship (when that&#039;s the furthest thing from the truth).&nbsp; I did forward the link to a couple of friends who are looking so hopefully they will be able to help you out.

				I thought about it but also as a mom that has a daughter I don&#039;t know how comfortable she would feel about having her daughter have a male as a roommate.&nbsp; My son is extremely respectful and raised the old fashion way, he respects women to a maximum because he was raised by a single mom (moi) and has a high regard for women but I can say 1,000 wonderful things about my son...but most people will say and thing (well what is she supposed to say...she&#039;s his mom!!).&nbsp; So I left it up to her to look at the ad and reach out to me if she feels comfortable.&nbsp; We have no problem if she (Mom) wants to meet my son and me, parents usually have a very developed six sense when it comes to their kids (it&#039;s that protective thing) so I can totally understand if she wants to get a gut feeling.&nbsp; <br /><br />I even asked my son about having a female roommate, you know the prying mother questions?&nbsp; He gave me the right answer, said &quot;Mom, I would not get romantically involved with her because that would just cause problems, all I want is for whoever moves in to be respectful of the apartment and me and I will do the same.&quot;&nbsp; Good answer!<br /><br />My opinion?&nbsp; I think it would be a good fit since it is two moms trying to help out their kids.

				Hello fellow Astorians,<br /><br />I would like to take this time to thank everyone who recommended people and took the time to send me notes, etc.&nbsp; I don&#039;t miss the city one bit but I do miss Astoria...guess you can&#039;t have the cake and eat it too.&nbsp; We found a really nice person, he&#039;s new to Astoria, a graphic designer, very nice kid and it seems like my son and he will get along fine.<br /><br />Again, thank you all for helping out, I really appreciate it and it&#039;s what makes Astoria so unique and better than anywhere else.&nbsp; I&#039;m lucky that the town I moved into has really nice people AND ALSO A FEW ASTORIANS!!!!!<br /><br />I&#039;ll still be around, the apartment is mine so I need to check up and make sure it&#039;s not being destroyed and give it the ocassional &quot;woman&#039;s touch&quot; and clean it up.<br /><br />Love you all

				Hi, Liz,<br /><br />I am so glad to hear that you and your son have found a good roommate within the time frame that you were hoping for (July). <br /><br />Your neighborliness and friendly nature are what confirmed for me that Astoria is a neat place and I look forward to visiting our daughter from time to time while she is in New York. Maybe we will get to meet you someday when you are back in the city for a visit.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I would really like that and I&#039;m sure that your daughter will love Astoria.&nbsp; Hopefully she also posts here, it&#039;s a great place to meet people, every so often they have some sort of gathering and a lot of the members here show up.&nbsp; I&#039;m one of the &quot;oldies&quot; but there are a lot of young adults in your daughter&#039;s age range.&nbsp; It&#039;s really great.&nbsp; <br /><br />The young man is close to my son&#039;s age and he&#039;s in the graphics end of computers but also a geek like my son so it&#039;s a good match.<br /><br />
