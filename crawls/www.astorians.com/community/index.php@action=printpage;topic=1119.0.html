				For anyone interested in great chef knives...<br /><br />JB Prince on 31st street between madison and 5th ave 11th floor, carries the very best in knives and chef tools of the trade. &nbsp;<br /><br />Just went this week to purchase a new knife kit for work. &nbsp; Got some japanese knives (mac brand) and they are so above and beyond anything ive ever worked with before. &nbsp;1/2 the weight of my german knives but still a great balance and the blade is honed on both sides. the cut is precise and super fine.

				I would say:<br />paring knives 20+<br />chef knives 80+<br />slicers 40+<br /><br />the best bet for a home chef looking for a great starter kit would be:<br />a 3-5 pices set from wusatoff or henkel purchased from bed bath beyond or macys. &nbsp; go online and check their sites. &nbsp;both places are very good on prices.

				Hand forged or machine made OK?<br /><br />I have a friend that's a bit insistent that when I do buy knives, I should find something hand forged -- as it will last forever and sharpen well.<br /><br />I have awful awful awful knives (but only 3 -- I'm a minimalist) that I want to replace and while I like the idea of something lasting forever, I just don't know that I'm committed to the great knife search. <br /><br />Are higher end knives (wusatoff or henkel) something I could just walk in, buy, and be happy with for nearly ever? &nbsp;Does the hand forged thing matter? &nbsp;And since I'm not using a billion knives -- should I just replace what I've got (chef and paring) with something good (plus a slicer) and avoid the &quot;sets&quot;?<br /><br />Questions questions questions.

				I am not a chef, but I have to tell use that my Wustof set, particularly the chef's knife is just wonderful. I add a knife to the set every year or so. I love it so much that I bring the chef's knife with me whenever I think I'm going somewhere where I might cook because I can't stand to use crappy cutlery anymore. Who in god's name wants to chop with a goddamn ikea paring knife? It's like the rice cooker - you'll never go back.

				I picked up a few Japanese Global knives at Bed Bath and Beyond a few years ago. Very nice although I thought the Paring knife a bit thick and stiff, the 10&quot; Chef was great. I've also cruised the Kitchen Supply shops on the Bowery in lower Manhatan, just above Chinatown. Some good deals there, especially if you'd like super sharp sushi prep knives. They also have ceramic knives.....the sharpest made but a bit brittle. You don't want to drop a $200 Japanese ceramic knife....especially on your foot.

				To answer a few questions:<br /><br />wustoff or henkel knives are great and easy to find all over town. &nbsp;<br /><br />My personal opinion is that wustoff knives are better than henkel simply because the blade has a more pronounced curve and therefore has a better rocking motion for chopping.<br /><br />A good knive or 3 can be a great thing to have and will last for years.<br /><br />What you want is a knife that has one piece of metal running from the point of the blade right back to the end of the handle. &nbsp;the handle should form around that back piece of metal. &nbsp;does not matter if the handle is metal or composite (most are not wood anymore). <br /><br />NEVER BUY A MACHINE STAMPED KNIFE (like the ginsu)<br /><br />You should never machine wash a good knife (not that any of us have a dishwasher anyway.<br /><br />What you need are the basics:<br />1. 8&quot; chef knife, &nbsp;if you have small hands then a regular 8&quot; chef is fine. &nbsp;if you have big hands then you might want to look into a wide or double wide blade to accomodate your chubby fingers.<br /><br />2. &nbsp;paring knife (not used so much but good to have)<br /><br />3. &nbsp;either a serrated bread slicer (preferably an offset model) OR a boning knife for fish and meats.<br /><br />Im assuming that most of you are not butchering your own meats and fish so stick with the serrated knife. &nbsp;this offset knive is also great for slicing and dicing (especially when your knife dulls a bit and you are too lazy to get it sharpened. &nbsp;the offset is serrated so it will never dull. &nbsp;well actually it will in about 5 yr, then just buy another.)<br /><br /><br />go to bed bath and beyond or macys cellar. &nbsp;look at a chef knife, paring knife set, then either buy a matching offset for about 30-40 bucks OR take a field trip down to bowery and houston streets. right there on the corner is chef supply. buy a $12 offset and use the extra savings to buy a few cool little gadgets for your kitchen and impress your friends. &nbsp;Maybe buy a cheap $15 boning knife too. I love mine.<br /><br />The last thing two items you need are:<br />1. a diamond steel for keeping your knive sharp and alligned. $30-$40. &nbsp;why a diamond one rather than a regular steel? &nbsp;a regular steel is 1/2 the price but not as good.<br /><br />2. &nbsp;Smith's Knife Sharpener: Smith's JIFF V SHARP Knife Sharpener, SM-JIFFSM-JIFF &nbsp;$6.97 &nbsp;(go online and find this item. its cheap and works better than any high end home knife sharpener)<br /><br />3. bonus item would be a wood knife block or magnetic strip to keep your knives save and away from a drawer where they will bang around and stab you when you go in to get something else.<br /><br />If you are really into this then go to JB Prince and look around at what they have. &nbsp;better knives at very good prices.<br /><br /><br />Hope this helps.

				I just bought 2 new MAC (japanese knives) and a japanese sharpening stone (water) at JB Prince. &nbsp;They even had a few grades of stone to choose from.<br /><br />Also bout the coolest knife kit bag called &quot;Koobi kit&quot;.<br /><br />doesnt open up with that big flap inside. &nbsp;its about 8&quot; x 20&quot; closed and has 3 seperate zippered compartments so you can keep your bag organized and neat by just opening 1 section at a time. &nbsp;shoulder strap too. &nbsp;got mine in dayglo orange.

				Here's the definitive review of chef's knives (http://www.cookingforengineers.com/article.php?id=129), courtesy of a blog called Cooking for Engineers (http://www.cookingforengineers.com/).<br /><br />I have a Global chef's knife (which, incidentally, is stamped, not forged, but is still the choice of many professional chefs -- the advice to go with forged blades only is a little obsolete). I also have a less expensive but still heavy-duty Calphalon paring knife and bread knife, and a really cheap narrow-bladed knife. I'd like to get a heavy duty Chinese cleaver for chopping through bones, but haven't gotten around to buying one. (A chef's knife is simply not heavy enough to go through thick bones.)

				First, a knife with the blade through the handle is called a &quot;Full Tang&quot; blade, meaning the blade continues through the handle for strength and balance. This applies to swords and hunting knives too.<br /><br />Balance, that is something that hasn't been brought up in this thread.Part of the appeal of a really well made knife, besides the quality of it's edge, is its balance. How it feels in your hand. This is especially true in a larger knife like a 10 inch Chef knife that is &quot;rocked&quot; when used for cutting.<br /><br />About the wood handles. They are not as sanitary, so you see them less, although the Japanese still seem to like them for their sushi preps. Globals are all steel. BTW they have two lines, stamped and hand forged w/ differing prices for apparently similar knives.<br /><br />Knife blades come in various types of stainless steel with differing Rockwell hardness ratings. If memory serves, stainless steel incorporates chromium into the alloy. No rust but not the sharpest. The sharpest metal is high carbon steel blades. Very sharp and hard but prone to rust so care needs to be taken to oil them after cleaning....like an iron skillet. Also available in sharp metal would be &quot;Damascus Steel&quot; It is very distinctive with what looks like tree rings or swurls of purple and blue in it. Expensive but very, very sharp. The steel is folded over and over during forging so that it approaches lamination. Hard to find too. The very sharpest is the ceramic knives. Scalpel sharp! Kyrocera (sp?) sells them. No rust but brittle.<br /><br />Would a group be interested in taking a cooking or knife skills (cooking not combat ) classes sometime in the future?

				A knife skills class would be great.<br /><br />Before we got our knives, we went and tested the feel of a lot of different kinds. &nbsp;We ended up with Henkel 4-star. &nbsp;We both have small hands, and the handles and balance are great for us. &nbsp;For the past year, I've been addicted to the Sankuto, although we also have the regular 8&quot; chef's knife as well. &nbsp;In addition to an assortment of Henkel knives, we have a 10&quot; serrated slicing knife and a 6&quot; boning knife from Grohmann, a Canadian company. &nbsp;We use both a diamond sharpener and a steel.<br /><br />Oh, and we either cook our bacon in the oven, or I cook it over medium-low heat on the stove forever. &nbsp;I like my bacon extra crispy, and cooking it over lower heat allows the fat to render completely. &nbsp;Of course, I can only do that when I have lots of time, which lately is never. &nbsp;I do cook it in a nonstick pan when I am going to follow the bacon by eggs cooked in some of the fat.<br /><br />I love that cooking for engineers site. &nbsp;A friend of mine turned me on to it a few months ago.<br /><br />I need a cleaver.

				Cleavers are tough. &nbsp;Best bet might be to go to chinatown and browse the shops feeling for heft and size, &nbsp;its just such a personal choice. &nbsp;<br /><br />I bought a MAC Sankuto recently, lots of chef friends have been raving about it. &nbsp;Cant seem to get into it. &nbsp;cant rock n' chop like a chef knife, doesnt have the length of the offset serrated. &nbsp;maybe if they made it more like a vegetable cleaver (more like 4&quot; high rather than 2.5&quot;) that might do the trick. &nbsp; but im sticking with it since i bought it.<br /><br />Over all my favorite go to knive for kitchen prep is the offset for large or medium veg dicing and the chef knive for chopping and mincing.<br /><br />I need a new cleaver too.<br /><br /><br />On an obscure tangent...<br /><br />How come there are no kung fu movies with chinese chefs gone crazy using all the knives in a kitchen??? &nbsp;remember all those bad 1960's chinese kung fu movies where the renegades go off into the mountains and discover how to master new martial art techniques using garden hoes, syths(???) and links of chain?
