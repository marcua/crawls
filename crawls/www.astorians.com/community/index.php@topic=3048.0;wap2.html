			<strong>ZiP!</strong>:
			<br />
			Hi - I was recently reminded of internet-based banks (Immigrant Bank, ING...) that seem to have better interest rates on basic savings accounts than traditional brick-and-mortar banks.&nbsp; Just wondering: are there any stipulations with these accounts?&nbsp; And, are they all FDIC insured?<br /><br />Thanks!

			I have both ING and Emigrant accounts. ING&#39;s interface is better, but Emigrant gives a higher rate. I&#39;ve moved my savings to Emigrant.<br /><br />I highly recommend these to people all the time. They are FDIC insured, but that doesn&#39;t mean all internet banks are. Getting 1% interest or less these days at a local bank is a bad move all around when options like this are available.

			HSBC has an online savings account of 5.05% interest.&nbsp; FDIC insured, branches everywhere (except Astoria, although I&#39;m told one is opening up here).

			I&#39;ve got an HSBC account.&nbsp; I believe they&#39;ve had the best rates for a while.&nbsp; Their interface totally sucks but you only really need to use it to set up automated transfers from your other bank and to check the balance once in a blue moon.

			Actually Citi has a 5.05% as well I think. EmigrantDirect is 5.15% currently<br /><br />Lots of options! :) But I believe all the above are FDIC insured up to $100k.
