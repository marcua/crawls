				I tried to listen but I simply could not - I guess sermons are not for me.&nbsp; If I go to Church (too infrequently I&#039;m afraid) I usually leave when the Priest begins his sermon.&nbsp; I just feel that they sometimes go on and on droning and droning about the same old stuff.

				Then you want to go to www.redeemer.com&nbsp; click on Store then Sermons and then Free Sermons.Tim Keller has a gift of speaking to people in a way that is not churchy,but intellectual and reasonable.Remember,the Bible is a book that is to be &quot;understood&quot;,otherwise how can you understand and believe the message of hope?<br />

				A born again cousin of mine got me to purchase a rather large Bible that has all sorts of explanations and is easier to read (according to her).&nbsp; I tried but I was not able to read it.<br /><br />Her television is programmed to every preacher who comes on at all times of the day.<br /><br />This is the same person who makes blatent rascist and ignorant comments.&nbsp; She has a strong belief that Americans are simply better than everyone else.&nbsp; Unfortunately this kind of turned me off to the whole Bible thumping thing. By the way, she is not the only person that I met who represents a dichotomy - rascist while simultaneously preaching Jesus&#039;s teachings.&nbsp; I simply do not &#039;get it&#039;.

				Someone once said that we (Christians) are the only Bible people will ever read.It&#039;s too bad that people like your cousin misrepresent Jesus.I had the blessing to be surrounded by loving Christians.That love rubs off on you and you share the love of God with others.That&#039;s why we&#039;re called the FAMILY OF GOD.&quot;We love Him because He first loved us&quot;(1 John 4:19).&quot;By this will every body know that you are My followers,when you love one another&quot;<br />(John 13:35).I think for starts the NIV (New International Version) Bible will be good for you.<br />Perhaps the following will be helpful for you.Listen to Christian radio on WMCA-570 AM.<br />Insight for living with Chuck Swindoll Mon- Fri 8:00 am &amp; 8:00 pm and<br />Word for Today with Chuck Smith Mon-Fri 5:00 pm (you can hear online broadcasts on www.gft.org.

				I think it&#039;s best to simply be a good person and do the right thing - give whatever you can to those who are less fortunate, do not judge, try to see the good side of people etc.
