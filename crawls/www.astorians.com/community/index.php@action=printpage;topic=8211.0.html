				I&#039;m very partial to the food at El Mariachi on Broadway, near 33rd. We have lunch there most every Saturday.<br /><br />I don&#039;t hesitate to recommmend various things with Carnitas, and Enchiladas Suizas is a particular favorite too. The Mole stuff is very good, but overpowering- you have to really be into it.

				&nbsp;:mrgreen: Me gusta mucho :lol:<br />el Taco Truck in front of Rite Aid on 30th avenue and 32nd street. Evenings from 730pm on.<br />Yes it&#039;s a grill on wheels, i was wary at first---but he&#039;s been there for at least a year and a half and is superfriendly.<br />He&#039;s helped by his family, seems like a true mom and pop operation.<br />I haven&#039;t been dissapointed yet. I&#039;ve had the soft tacos, the rice plate and the huarache. <br />The soft tacos are unlike any i&#039;ve ever had they have radishes, onions, lettuce, tomato, lime wedge, red and green sauce and choice of filling.<br />good stuff kids, check it out!

				yeah, tex mex is what i&#039;m jonesing for.<br />i used to somewhat satify my fix with happy tortilla on steinway but they closed. fresca tortilla is just a hike from 34th ave and i am pretty sure i am out of their delivery range.<br /><br />tons of proper mexican options and so few tex mex...see how desperate i was? i settled for microwaved &quot;tex mex&quot; from a chinese take out joint!<br /><br />i&#039;m curious about the guacamole place too. i&#039;ve passed by and wondered if it was just a new incarnation of the previous establishment ala margaritaville &quot;replacing&quot; las margaritas (which i still think was the worst mexican food i have ever had in my life!)

				Has anyone been to the Mexican place on 31st Street just off of 23rd Avenue, near Lefkos Pirgos?&nbsp; The name escapes me right now.&nbsp; It&#039;s been there quite a number of years.

				I tried Guacamole and it&#039;s good - not amazing, but good, solid Mexican food.&nbsp; They&#039;re very friendly - it&#039;s definitely a new place, and I think a new management as I didn&#039;t recognize any of the staff and had been in the Tex-Mex place a few times.

It&#039;s fine. Good tacos, posole, and mole. Sorta generic enchiladas, burritos, and tortas. Nice people. There have been complaints here about cleanliness on occasion, though...

				There&#039;s a new Mexican place on Steinway and 28th Avenue with a nice, sophisticated menu. Haven&#039;t eaten there yet but the menu looks good.

				Yup.&nbsp; Here are some thoughts on it:<br /><br />http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=8636.0<br /><br />http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=9022.0<br /><br />I tried it and while the food is good, it&#039;s a bit pricey.&nbsp; They are also having new-restaurant-mistakes which should fix themselves in time.<br /><br />That said, I&#039;m always on the look out for a good margarita in Astoria.&nbsp; I think this place not only has the best margarita in Astoria but also one of the best I&#039;ve had in my life.&nbsp; Seriously, it was the margarita that brought me back a second time.
