				I&#039;m thinking of making a road trip to Rhode Island, stopping in Providence for the waterfire, Newport, and then Block Island.&nbsp; Any recommendations on where to stay, what to do, where to eat?&nbsp; How long is the drive from Providence to Newport, and then from Newport to Block Island - I think this is by ferry?&nbsp; Thanks for the help!

				Arugh! I had a big &#039;ol response written, and then I accidentally closed the browser. D&#039;oh! Lemme see if I can remember what I wrote...<br /><br />My friends and I went to Block Island for 4 nights last summer around this time (last week of June after they were done with school, they&#039;re teachers). We stayed at a B&amp;B called The Island Home (http://www.theislandhome.com/), it was at Ocean Ave &amp; Beach Ave. There are a ton of B&amp;B&#039;s on the island, and one big hotel (The National). Since its their high season, everything&#039;s a bit pricey, so shop around. It worked out for us since there were 4 of us to split it. The Island home is definitely recommended by me, Dina &amp; Dave were totally nice. I&#039;m usually weirded out by B&amp;Bs, but I was comfortable there.<br /><br />It is a ferry to Block Island. From Rhode Island, you&#039;d get it in Port Judith. You can put the car on the ferry (I forget how much extra it costs, but if its more than just you, it can be split), or you can just go over without the car and walk/use cabs/rent a bike. Cabs are fairly pricey there, so use sparingly. For whatever its worth, I wish we had taken the car onto the ferry, but we had a pregnant friend with us and ended up taking more cabs then we expected. The beach is a little out of the way too, and you may want to car/cab/bike it there. I guess the car decision depends on how long you plan on staying (we stayed for 4 nights), if there will be other people with you, and if you plan on going out at night.<br /><br />Oh! Also! If you&#039;re staying for more than a night or so and anticipate buying snacks/beer for your room/whatever, buy it on the mainland. Supermarkets there are really expensive since everything has to be shipped in.<br /><br />There&#039;s not much nightlife, but there are places to go out to eat, and there&#039;s a bar where it seems like the younger, 20s-ish crowd (who probably work the downtowny area by day) hangs out at night. If I recall correctly, its on Ocean Ave near Connecticut Ave. I forget what it&#039;s called though (something with a Pirate maybe?)<br /><br />Even if you do bring a car, rent a bike one day and bike around the island. It was so much fun...just make sure you bring water with you, convienence stores are hard to come by outside of the towny area.<br /><br />Overall, Block Island was cute and low-key. If you&#039;re looking for lots and lots to do, you&#039;re not going to find it there, but if you&#039;re looking to get away and hang out in a beachy town, then its a good spot to go. I&#039;d definitely go back for a few days to unwind.<br /><br />If I remember anything else, I&#039;ll post again!

				Thanks Alison!&nbsp; I actually did save the Island Home B&amp;B because it looked nice!&nbsp; Cool coincidence.&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking of doing all the exploring the city/nightlife/etc/., in Newport and Providence, and then spending 3 days in Block Island to relax for a bit.&nbsp; So it sounds perfect!&nbsp; I&#039;ll be sure to post about it when I return!

				Oh cool :) If you end up staying there, let me know...there was a bit of an accident with my preggo friend that I&#039;m sure Dina will remember. Nothing huge or tragic and everyone is fine, it was sort of a result of clumsiness, and it didn&#039;t even happen at the B&amp;B, but it would be funny for you to give her a follow up :) Hehe!

				Oh, also, if you go to the beach, don&#039;t plan on swimming unless you want hypothermia. It was FREEEEEEZZZZING! The only people swimming were under the age of 12 and therefore crazy. It was pretty with awesome waves though.

				I grew up in Rhode Island and actually vacationed on Block Island for three years.&nbsp; One thing that pops up first is that it is very difficult in the summer to make a reservation to get your car on the Ferry, though we always took the Ferry, with car, from Pt. Judith to Block Island.&nbsp; &nbsp; You could also I think take the Ferry from Providence to Block Island, but that is an awful long time to be on a ferry and you would miss Newport.&nbsp; You don&#039;t really need a car on Block Island.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can rent bikes right near where you get off the Ferry<br /><br />In Newport, you can actually tour some of the mansions and see what America was like before the days of the income tax.&nbsp; &nbsp; What is even better is to take a walk on the cliffwalk (which is free), which is a pathway that runs along the cliffs with the water below on one and the back of the mansions on the other.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />More locally, I get a kick of out this restaurant chain that billed itself as part of &quot;The New York System.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;These chains served hot weiners (specially cooked hot dogs smothered in mustard, meet sauce, onions and celery salt).&nbsp; &nbsp;Trouble is there isn&#039;t a &quot;New York System&quot; system in New York.<br /><br />And if you go to a water fountain we called it a bubbler in Rhode Island.&nbsp; &nbsp;And I grew up near that coffee milk plant, which was on the Warwick/Cranston line.&nbsp; &nbsp;The coffee milk was called &quot;Eclipse.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; A friend&#039;s mother worked in the plant.<br /><br />Finally, there is another New England brand of soda called Moxie.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have never been brave enough to try it.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can get it in bottles in supermarkets.<br /><br />And don&#039;t forget Narrangansett beer, which was billed as &quot;Our Own New England Beer&quot; when I was growing up.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was brewed in Cranston, but the owners sold it to Falstaff, the new owners closed the brewery and began brewing it in Indiana and then proceeded to run the brand into the ground.&nbsp; &nbsp;An entrepreneur has bought the name and is now brewing &#039;Gansett once again.

				We are definitely going to Newport.&nbsp; At the moment, it&#039;s the only place that&#039;s given us a reservation with ease.&nbsp; I expect to get the other&#039;s by the end of the week.&nbsp; The plan is to go to Providence on Saturday to see the sights, and the Waterfire art installation at night, and then partay, crash at Marriott.&nbsp; Going to Newport for two days and staying in the Belle View Inn Bed &amp; Breakfast.&nbsp; They have been very friendly to us already, and recommended an even better room than the one we picked off the website, same price.&nbsp; We&#039;re planning on doing the 5 mansion pass for $30 - any mansions you recommend, Katlu?&nbsp; Also planning on cliff walk, but not sure what else.&nbsp; Then moving on to Block Island for another two days.&nbsp; We decided to leave the car at the ferry because the reservations are already booked out except for 8am (too early) and 3pm (too late).&nbsp; So we&#039;re going to rent bikes (should I get a lock/chain?) to get around and cabs.&nbsp; We&#039;re planning on staying at Island Home but couldn&#039;t get them on the phone Thursday and they haven&#039;t returned our call.&nbsp; So we&#039;ll try again today.&nbsp; There&#039;s also talk of visiting Jamestown?&nbsp; What&#039;s this like?&nbsp; Good for daytrip?&nbsp; Also, Mystic on the way home....<br /><br />So yeah, major road trip!!&nbsp; &nbsp;And I love how short the distances are!&nbsp; It&#039;ll be great to get out of the city.&nbsp; And recommendations on restaurants, hangouts, and sights would be awesome!&nbsp; Bubbler is water fountain - love that word!&nbsp; I&#039;m going to the bubbler!&nbsp; And Katlu, all that food sounds yummy!

				Hey Chris- always a pleasure to meet other Rhodies!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Daisy- With a pass of five you won&#039;t miss out.&nbsp; There&#039;s only one that I thought was boring, but I can&#039;t remember which one.&nbsp; <br />If you end up eating at the Franklin Spa, a small diner/restaurant, perfect for breakfast, it&#039;s where I grew up.&nbsp; My mom owned it from when I was in first grade and through to high school. It&#039;s on the corner or Spring St and Franklin St (parallel to Memorial Blvd).&nbsp; <br /><br />Also when you go to Block island, I&#039;m pretty sure they give you a lock when you rent. I could be wrong though.&nbsp; <br /><br />Jamestown is not worth your time as there&#039;s not much to see.&nbsp; My cousins grew up there and we never left their house unless we were leaving Jamestown.&nbsp; &nbsp;Mystic, however, is a lot of fun. <br /><br />

Good walks/bike rides are to be had on Block Island, and when I was 20/21ish, I had good times with my friends in Providence (a high school friend lived there for awhile).<br /><br />Also, avoid Oscar the cat!

				So I&#039;m back from Rhode Island!!&nbsp; I had such a great time (oh except for my stay at the Seacrest Inn - YIK!! review below).&nbsp; We saw the Waterfire art installation in Providence, it was awesome!&nbsp; I took a lot of video and will try posting some excerpts somewhere when I can.&nbsp; Newport was great too, we did the 5 mansion pass and Cliff Walk in the two days we were there.&nbsp; It&#039;s really beautiful and the mansions are spectacular!!&nbsp; Pictures soon to come.&nbsp; Newport&#039;s fun with all the great shops and restaurants - I must have gained or lost weight or just maintained because it was hot everywhere, lots of exercise, drinking every night, and lots of eating to be had.&nbsp; Had so much seafood!!&nbsp; Did try frozen lemonade - it&#039;s kinda like a big icee - in Block Island.&nbsp; We stayed at the Marriott in Providence - was really nice, although the pool was mobbed by children.&nbsp; Explored the city all day, and waterfire at night.&nbsp; We stayed at the nicest Bed and Breakfasts in Newport - the Belle View Inn.&nbsp; The rooms are great and the staff so friendly and helpful.&nbsp; A wonderful contrast to our horrible stay in Block Island.&nbsp; Block Island itself is amazing, so beautiful, the views are amazing, the lighthouses fun to explore, lots of cute shops and restaurants, Island full of natural beauty and beaches.&nbsp; We rented bikes the first day, a bit of a mistake due to how incredibly hot it was - I swear I almost got heat stroke, with all those hills and the sun beating down on you.&nbsp; We rented mopeds the next day, but I&#039;m a scaredy cat and rode on the back of my friend.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like motorcycles or mopeds so it was nervewracking, I was anxious the whole time.&nbsp; But it was the only way to see the entire island.&nbsp; If I went again, I&#039;d want the car.&nbsp; It&#039;s really worth it to see the whole island, it&#039;s just so beautiful!&nbsp; Pics coming soon!!

				http://www.flickr.com/gp/58346070@N00/1aXLxR<br /><br />My friends and I stayed at the Seacrest Inn in Block Island.&nbsp; &nbsp;I wish I had read Trip Advisor reviews before booking it, because this place really should be condemned.&nbsp; It is falling apart, and looks like the place was built out of cardboard.&nbsp; There is mildew all over the bathroom, on the curtain, and on the walls and ceiling.&nbsp; There is no tv channel service and no phone.&nbsp; There was a large stain on the carpet, and the bed quilts hadn&#039;t been washed in decades.&nbsp; The towels are old and ratty.&nbsp; &nbsp; We didn&#039;t bother complaining because the entire inn looked like this, and there would be no better room to be had.&nbsp; It is run by a little old lady who could care less about her customers, just that she is making a lot of money off them.&nbsp; The place is not cheap, it&#039;s $189 a night, and the ad on the web is deceiving.&nbsp; They prey on unsuspecting people, who have never been to Block Island before, and don&#039;t know what they are getting into.&nbsp; Upon touring the entire Island, and seeing the many beautiful B&amp;B Victorian houses of comparable value, we realized we really were staying at the worst place on the entire Island.&nbsp; Even the breakfast was disgusting, it consisted of pre-packaged danishes that you can buy at 7/11, full of fat and preservatives.&nbsp; They make you secure the room with a deposit on a personal check - which they cashed ahead of time - and then make you pay in full upon arrival - no refunds.&nbsp; Their workers are exchange students who live there for free&nbsp; - in exchange for work.&nbsp; It&#039;s like a hostel.&nbsp; The place is awful&nbsp; - Be warned!!!&nbsp; I have posted pictures.<br /><br />I have posted this on Yahoo Travel, and Trip Advisor but the reviews haven&#039;t been approved yet.&nbsp; Is there a way to report a hotel on violations of having mildew everywhere?
