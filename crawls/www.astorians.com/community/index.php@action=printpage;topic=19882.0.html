				This is the only liquor store that I&#039;ve walked out of in anger due to poor customer service. Sure the prices are fine, but there are so very many better stores in the area. Btw-- no on on these boards likes businesses posting pretending to be customers. It&#039;s dishonest and unprofessional.

				Well, in my perception they are the best as they gives free bottle of wine to their customers as social responsibility. I am a small customer who buys a 4$ bottle and gets $10 as a gift on thnks giving. You might have done something unusual or bad to them who knows. Ya whatever, atleast they people are honest with their suggestions and reccomandations which makes me feeel good. Go again and have experience and please try to destroy your PASIMASTIC VIEWS ABT THEM!!!!!!!!!! :lol:

				The people running the place are great, too. Staff always takes care of me and my friends. We&#039;ll even catch a few minutes of whatever testings they have on and chat about why the Lakers wait so long to &quot;flip the switch.&quot;<br /><br />Also, since this is my neighborhood party store, they discount everything on a case or half case. The service was the friendliest service I have ever encountered. He stood with me through the whole decision process. :cheesy: :cheesy: :cheesy: :cheesy: :cheesy: :cheesy:
