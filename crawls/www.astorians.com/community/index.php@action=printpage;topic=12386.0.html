				Don&#039;t bother - people have said to me that the folks that run this are very difficult to work with. I have heard them described as immature and unprofessional. <br /><br />It is common opinion that they are losing their money hand over fist and its always an open issue if they can come to press with every edition.

				hi there,<br /><br />elkelorraine1: unfortunately, we are just wrapping up doing the photography for &quot;falling in love in LIC.&quot; i&#039;m sorry! but thanks very much for your interest :) however, we are always looking for new contributors -- freelancers and artists alike. feel free to email me and i can let you know how we could possibly work together in the future. :)<br /><br />gleason: i really don&#039;t appreciate this, but thanks for being honest. it would be great to have the chance to rectify the situation with anyone we have caused any problems with -- i am also unsure exactly WHO is being described as immature and unprofessional. many people have worked at ins&amp;outs over the years. from my own opinion -- i am born &amp; raised in LIC/astoria, where i still live, and i love working at this magazine. i have had so many great experiences -- true, we have a very small staff, but we get things done and do all we can, the best we can. i <em>really</em> do not appreciate you spreading rumors. i do not know how anyone besides the staff of ins&amp;outs could make a statement like &quot;its always an open issue if they can come to press with every edition.&quot; i think we do a great job producing a full-color, glossy, 136 page magazine without a HUGE staff. if you have a question about the magazine or have heard a rumor, why not go straight to the source and ask about it? we do all we can for this magazine, and are already planning for the issue after next. in any case, i&#039;m sorry that there are negative opinions out there.<br /><br />thanks!

				hi, plank! thanks so much! :) <br /><br />the issue with the &quot;love in LIC&quot; piece isn&#039;t out yet -- it is actually a collection of full-page photos spread throughout the magazine with each person or couple&#039;s quote/story underneath their picture. vol.II, issue 3 is set for a november release right now. you can definitely check our website because we&#039;ll announce when the issue is done.<br /><br />we distribute most heavily in astoria/LIC -- i often distribute to communitea in LIC myself when i get lunch, and to various restaurants down vernon blvd. like junior&#039;s cafe, blend, lounge 47, etc. it&#039;s a bit difficult to pin down all of the exact locations since we are always expanding the distribution list, BUT if you go to www.licmagazine.com and click on &quot;to advertise&quot; in the right hand corner, there is a link to our media kit. it isn&#039;t completely updated, but on the 2nd and 3rd pages there are a bunch of locations to give you an idea of where we distribute to.<br /><br />feel free to email me if you can&#039;t find an issue, or if you&#039;d like us to distribute somewhere in particular :)

I&#039;m sure there will be positive and negative opinions to any place I want to contribute to and I do take all those in stride. Thanks again.

A completely warm, supportive, and professional experience! I feel so fortunate that we have this wonderful magazine - I&#039;m personally grateful to have found people who are so supportive of Astoria &amp; LIC emerging artists, businesses and the likes. In addition, I have found so many incredible restaurants, galleries, and other places by picking up a copy of this magazine. Thanks Audrey and everyone at INS&amp;OUTS!<br /><br />&nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br />Sara
