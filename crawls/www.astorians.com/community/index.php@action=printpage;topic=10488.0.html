				I would like to get a tennis permit from the city and play in the neighborhood. Would anyone like to join me?&nbsp; I am totally new to the game but CAN keep the ball on the court.&nbsp; The permit is $100 per person but good at any city court for the whole season.<br /><br />Link to get the permit application.<br />http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_permits_and_applications/tennis_permits_renewals.html

				I don&#039;t have time to play (sorry). I just wanted to comment that I had no idea that you needed a permit to play tennis. I find that really fascinating, but I can see how that could be necessary (maintaining the courts, making it so less people are using/abusing the tennis courts, etc.).<br /><br />In my PE class in high school they tried to teach us tennis, but I totally sucked. I do think it&#039;s fun even though I am not very good at it. I used to be pretty good at badminton, however (I took badminton as a class in college :lol:), although that&#039;s not quite as strenuous as tennis.
