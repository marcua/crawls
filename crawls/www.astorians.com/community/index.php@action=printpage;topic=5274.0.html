				An X-Ray is radiology (radiation) and isn&#039;t something like a band-aid. &#160;I also think that it needs to be referred by a Doctor. Though this is NYC.&nbsp; Who knows?

				Tell them you are taking the film with you. DO NOT LEAVE WITHOUT THE FILM. If it is broken and/or fractured you will need to be seen by an orthopaedist who has no interest in what the radiologist sees; he will want to look for himself.

				Geez Enigma - Sometimes a bad sprain can be as painful as a break. You really should seek medical attention - eg: go to the ER - Astoria General (Mt. Sianai is good) . Hope you take care of it and you&#039;re back in cat action soon.

				Well, thanks for all the helpful advice!<br /><br />When I actually got to the radiology place I was rather rudely informed that I couldn&#039;t just walk in, I needed an appointment. (Note to self: next time, ask the same question several different ways to ensure that I do not leave work early for nothing). <br /><br />But on my way home I passed the clinic on 34th and bway. I walked in, they saw me quickly, they examined me, xrayed me, and told me it wasn&#039;t broken. And they were NICE. <br /><br />Me likey the nicey.&nbsp; :-)

				Oh dear!<br /><br />I suffered from a pre-ice sprained ankle a few weeks ago. &nbsp;I landed myself in the ER the day after my new insurance kicked in (nice, right?) and an X-Ray confirmed that it wasn&#039;t broken, despite the fact that I couldn&#039;t put weight on it at the time. &nbsp;They handed me a set of crutches and made me an appointment with a podiatrist and I figured not broken, no big deal, right? &nbsp;(It didn&#039;t even look swollen.) &nbsp;<br /><br />I&#039;ve learned a lot about ankles in the last three weeks, including that things that didn&#039;t seem like a big deal really are. &nbsp;My foot was swollen in places I didn&#039;t notice, and I don&#039;t have a full range of motion. &nbsp;The podiatrist referred me to physical therapy and also a follow up x-ray because frequently, ERs can miss minor breaks. &nbsp;(Mine was okay.)<br /><br />Anyway, I don&#039;t know what your situation is, but if it&#039;s purple, I wouldn&#039;t take &quot;it&#039;s not broken&quot; for an answer if you can help it. &nbsp;There can still be lasting problems and a need for work on it. &nbsp;My foot is feeling better now, but after almost three weeks I&#039;m still having difficulty with balance and range of motion issues. &nbsp;PT has been great for getting it back into place, though right now my whole leg is kinda burning from the work the PT just did on me tonight.<br /><br />Feel better. &nbsp;If you need to borrow crutches, I&#039;m actually almost done with mine? &nbsp;(I think?) If you wanted to borrow one (?) I could definitely spare a single. &nbsp;Might hold on to the second in case it gets icy again - it was great for moving around over slush piles with optimal balance.<br /><br />Oh, also, the mantra that my PT/podiatrists have been drilling into my head:&nbsp; &quot;Elevate and ice!&nbsp; For god&#039;s sakes, ELEVATE AND ICE!!!!&quot;

				Thank you :) <br /><br />Today I was able to walk with only minor discomfort, so I don&#039;t think I need the crutches. Hopefully I will be able to tango in a few weeks (I&#039;ve always wanted to tango). <br /><br />It sounds like your injury was much worse than mine! Send me a pm if you need someone to p/u groceries or whatever for you. <br /><br />

				As long as we&#039;re comparing injuries, I was never purple!&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for the offer - my friends were good to me the first few days when I needed it, and now I&#039;m pretty much mobile and getting around okay.&nbsp; I won&#039;t be running a marathon (or tango-ing!) for a few weeks, but I&#039;m finally at the point where people aren&#039;t noticing my limp that much, so yay!<br /><br />Seriously, I didn&#039;t think mine was that bad, but the podiatrist and PTs pointed out all sorts of things I hadn&#039;t noticed.&nbsp; It&#039;s way more involved than I expected it to be, but hopefully it means I won&#039;t have any lasting effects.<br /><br />But hey! I got crutches now!&nbsp; One more thing to store in my apartment.&nbsp; &nbsp;:roll:
