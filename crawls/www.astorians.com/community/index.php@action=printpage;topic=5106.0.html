				Its a toss up between Amazing Race and Project Runway for me. But I picked Amazing Race because I desperately want to be on it.<br /><br />I will sit for an entire Saturday afternoon and watch a Surreal Life/I Love New York/Hogan Knows Best marathon though, if I have nothing better to do.

				I think Project Runway is still my all-time favorite, though I like Top Chef.&nbsp; Survivor has it&#39;s moments.&nbsp; I&#39;ve seen some of I love New York and have found it interesting.&nbsp; If 12pack would undress more, it would be better (sorry!)

				I liked everything up to Miami. And I kind of liked New Orleans. After that, it became a meat market and uninteresting.<br /><br />Again, though, I&#39;ll still totally watch it on a weekend afternoon if they have a marathon.&nbsp; :lol:

				Top chef<br />Project runway<br /><br />There is one episode of I love NY where she is talking about one guy she likes.<br />Something about how much she likes him because &quot;He&#39;s a real thug&quot;, &quot;Can really wear baggy clothes&quot; AND my favorite line &quot;He really likes to drink, just like me&quot;.&nbsp; That&#39;s a winner right there.

				Gotta go old-school and say Survivor.&nbsp; &nbsp;I didn&#39;t get into it until season three or so, but since then I&#39;ve been hooked.&nbsp; &nbsp; I guess I like to think of how I&#39;d handle those scenario/situations....&nbsp; and do them BETTER!

				I am a little embarrased to say that I really enjoy Intervention.&nbsp; <br />Also, I was oddly amused by Two-A days- last season. Glad that this season of teenagers are not as entertaining.&nbsp; <br /><br />And I&#39;m fascinated by Bam&#39;s Unholy Union.&nbsp;

				you know, i was gonna start a new topic about intervention about a week ago, but I didn&#39;t. I love it, but I&#39;ll post my thoughts later. Gotta go have dinner and get ready for Lost! (I&#39;m not a tv junkie, promise. Just today.)

				I seriously need cable NOW. I purposely stayed at the gym for an extra hour the other night because I couldn&#39;t turn away from &quot;I Love New York&quot;. That show is a train wreck. Celebreality on VH1 is highly addictive. I watched a &quot;Beauty and the Geek&quot; marathon over the holidays which lead me to watch this season pm CW11. That is my one guilty pleasure of reality crap this season. <br /><br />I remember liking that show Intervention. There was a bit I saw on YouTube which was an intervention with a naked meth addict. It was insane. That show is actually really sad if you think about it. I prefer the junk that MTV and VH1 have.<br /><br />ANTM starts up again on 2/28. I posted something about it in the old thread.
