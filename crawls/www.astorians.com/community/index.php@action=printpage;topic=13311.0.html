				I&#039;ve already nixed Riccardo&#039;s and have serious doubts about the Astoria World Manor. Does anybody have any not-too-astronomically-priced wedding venues to suggest locally (by which I mean, in the five boros)? For both a ceremony and reception (catered is fine.)<br /><br />I&#039;ve always liked the idea of a party at The Foundry, if anybody&#039;s been and can report.<br /><br />Muchas gracias!

				I have no idea as to cost, but I attended a wedding at the Manhattan Penthouse this past weekend and it was lovely. On the corner of 14th st /5 av. Beatiful views, and the food was the best I&#039;ve ever had at a wedding!<br /><br />

				I had my wedding at the Brooklyn Brewery in Williamsburg.&nbsp; The rental cost was not bad and all the beer your guests could drink (6 or more different types of Brooklyn Brewery beer) was included.&nbsp; The staff there is great and it was a wonderful experience all around. Very convenient for public transportation as well as by car (lots of parking over there - it&#039;s close to McCarren Park).

				If you are talking about the Foundry in LIC, I have been there for a wedding. It was absolutely beautiful space with exposed brick with a loft type of feel to it. It&#039;s not a huge place, so your reception party would prob have to be under a 100. They have a nice garden in the back. The wedding was in December so they had a bon fire in the back cuz it was freezing. I bet if you have it during the spring or fall the backyard would be lovely. They had a bar set up back there and had their cocktail/appetizer in the garden. IMHO it&#039;s probably the nicest and most unique venue in the area that isn&#039;t tacky.

				Would be over 100 people, though if I can help it will stay small......Foundry&#039;s a definite possibility.<br /><br />Manhattan Penthouse looks outrageously expensive, though the fact that the food is memorable makes me want to do it!! Bah, who am I kidding :-P

				About a year ago I went to a wedding on Russo&#039;s on the Bay&nbsp; (Crossbay Blvd)&nbsp; the food was FANTASTIC.&nbsp; The place may be a little too ornate, but the food and service more than make up for it.<br /><br />I also liked Terrace on the Park but I think they can get pricey<br /><br />Avoid Bruno&#039;s on the Boulevard (horrible)&nbsp; And Dante&#039;s in Jackson Heights. (very poor service)&nbsp;

				If u dont mind LongIsland , then one of the best places for the price that i can say is the North Ritz club .&nbsp; Dont have the exact adress but i believe its on jericho turnpike in nassau county .&nbsp; Very good prices and the food is outstanding esp the cocktail hour .&nbsp; All depends what u want to spend as u work out the menu with the manager . Now in the winter time&nbsp; u can get even better prices esp on fridays and sundays .

				We checked out the Foundry. The space is great, but after you include in all the extra stuff (like table/chair rental, tent rental (if you use the outside)), it became pretty expensive. We were also concerned about the transportation situation -- it&#039;s not really close to public transportation, and while there&#039;s ample parking, not sure if it&#039;s in the safest part of the neighborhood to leave a car around (it&#039;s pretty desolate at night).

				We were recently at a wedding at the Foundry and it was very nice...I&#039;d guess about the same number of people that you are having. The one thing that we noticed is that their was no real space designated for dancing. The floor towards the back (and in front of the doors to the backyard) is where people were dancing but at this particular wedding it seemed a little disconnected from the entire venue. However, we loved the bricks, the outdoor area, and the overall vibe of the place! It&#039;s classy without being pretentious! We had it easy for transportation (could practically walk there from our apartment if I hadn&#039;t been wearing heels :-D) but I do understand that for some, transportation could be a bit trickier. However, any wedding I&#039;ve ever been to (except that one!) has been a little work to get to...usually comes with the territory.<br /><br />keep us updated on your venue thoughts!<br /><br />sara

				The Water&#039;s Edge in LIC is also a nice venue.&nbsp; I went to an event there last year and it was nice.&nbsp; Not sure about pricing though.
