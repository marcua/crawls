				So i have this absolutely fabulous messenger bag that is huge and has all sorts of compartments and what not. It is a life saver in the winter since i can carry everything in it all at once so i can keep my freezing hands in my pockets. Anyhoo, the strap is coming off(probably due to me carry my life in it)and last year i just super glued it back on. Well, that didn't last. Does anyone know any places that will fix this sort of thing? I should mention that the bag is Nylon and PVC, not like the Manhattan messenger bags. I thought maybe a shoe repair store, but decided to see if anyone here has a first or second hand recommendation.<br />Thanks!<br />Jenn

				Hey Jenn - I would ask a show repair place. I think you're on the right track there. What's the brand of the bag, BTW?

				It hurts me to admit that it is a GAP bag. In my defense, it's the only thing i've ever bought there. It's actually lasted me a good 4 years. I haven't seen another one like it, so that's why i am so desperate to get it fixed before it breaks on me during rush hour. that and i am like the art movement-ba-roke<br /><br />Jenn

				No worries. My backpack is from the Gap, too, and I too, rarely shop there. But I've noticed before that they have good bags there. Random, but true.

				I&#39;ve always brought my bags to the Shoe Repair Shop on 28 St. off of 23 Ave. and he&#39;s always fixed them.&nbsp; Either stitching or glueing them.&nbsp; He does a nice job.

				*Bump*<br />i&#39;m bumping this up since my lazy self never got my bag fixed last year and now the strap is worse. i used it for one day (with only the contents from my other bag) and i swear it ripped a little more. Other than the strap falling off this bag is perfect and i just don&#39;t want to part with it. <br />so now that we have tons of new members, anyone have any ideas? i was thinking the shoe repair place on broadway between 33rd and 32nd, where the locksmith is. or what about a dry cleaners that does alterations. do you think they would fix this sort of thing. <br />perhaps when i get home i will take a picture and show y&#39;all my bag trauma.

				A shoe repair place wouldn&#39;t also happen to be a good option for getting a beloved umbrella repaired, would it?&nbsp; My favorite umbrella got knocked around in the wind recently and slightly bent (not horribly) in one location.&nbsp; Would love to take it somewhere to get fixed but have never had this situation come up before.&nbsp; &nbsp;:|

				You could try and get a cheap fix by going to the hardware store and buying PVC glue. Its cheap and it will hold it together better than you&#39;d think.

				There is a shoe repair place under the subway (ditmars stop) near the post office.<br /><br />I once got my bag fixed there.&nbsp; It had a leather strap, however.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you like it, it is worth a try!
