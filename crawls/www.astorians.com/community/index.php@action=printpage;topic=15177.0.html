				OK--I know I&#039;m asking a lot. But we&#039;ve got a relative flying in at Lag for a layover and I want to do Astoria proud. Not as cheap as Uncle Georges, but not the casbah&nbsp; either.<br /><br />Suggestions?

				Taverna Kycklades, sorry about the spelling, next to Top Tomato on Ditmars. Worth the wait.

				Kyklades is overrated, IMO.&nbsp; The food is good but I just don&#039;t see how it&#039;s so much more appealing than the several other Greek seafood restaurants in Astoria.&nbsp; It&#039;s also limited to just seafood, so if you&#039;re interested in trying other aspects of Greek cuisine, you won&#039;t find it there.<br /><br />I would recommend Philoxenia, Zenon, S&#039;Agapo, Stamatis, and for something out of the ordinary and very bare bones but with good food, Corner 26.&nbsp; I still haven&#039;t tried Loukoumi or Ta Vlahika, so I can&#039;t make a recommendation for those either way.

				Corner 26 is indeed excellent. But if you&#039;re looking for a &quot;scene,&quot; not the place! Great quality, atmosphere and service, though. Authentic.<br />

				Taverna Kyklades is good, people wait for a reason.&nbsp; Also love Zenon, very rustic , traditional and real feeling.&nbsp; Telly&#039;s Taverna is also great, with lots of fresh fish but other traditional stuff as well.&nbsp; Happy eating!!<br />

				Another vote here for 26th Corner (on 26th street &amp; 23rd Ave. 718-777-5511).&nbsp; Very authentic.&nbsp; The only Greek restaurant around here that actually reminds me of being in Greece.&nbsp; They serve Greek wine in cups and have mismatched flatware, but I really do love it.<br /><br />It may, however, be too authentic for what you&#039;re looking for.

				I love Stamatis on 23rd Ave although it seems to have gotten a little more expensive. I will have to try 26 Corner.

				*watches thread*<br /><br />Often when I mention to people that I live in Astoria, I am asked &quot;where&#039;s a good Greek restaurant?&quot;<br />I have no clue, Greek food&#039;s not my thing but I&#039;d love to have an answer for this!

				I just came back from S&#039;Agapo and liked it. The service there was very good - although being Greek helps. The food was not quite as good as Stamatis.

				I don&#039;t think there is any singular standout Greek restaurant in Astoria anymore (Esperides and Karyates were but they&#039;re both closed). However, there are a handful of good ones. Stamatis, Zenon, Taverna Kyklades are all good. Tony&#039;s Souvlaki Opaa is almost as good and with better prices.

				I&#039;m a fan of Aliada on Broadway and 30th Street. Food is solidly good -- have never had a bad meal there -- and the prices are very reasonable.
