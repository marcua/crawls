				Hi all, is anyone here currently a grad student at Columbia or know someone is?&nbsp; I&#39;m researching graduate school programs in Japanese Studies and Columbia&#39;s East Asian Languages and Cultures department looks best so far.&nbsp; I&#39;m trying to talk to as many people as I can about graduate school life at Columbia, navigating financial aid, applying, and so on.&nbsp; I took a tour there just before the holidays and got &quot;that&quot; feeling like it was the right place for me but I&#39;ve got a lot more homework to do researching and planning before I make this step.&nbsp; Would be interested in hearing from anybody who goes to / went to Columbia (Japan or East Asia focus a plus) or another program in East Asian studies somewhere else.&nbsp; Thank you!

				I don&#39;t know any current grad students, but as an alum, I can tell you that it&#39;s a good school, good resources, but they tend to treat GSAS as the unfavored child.&nbsp; I was a doctoral student in the Political Science Department, but hated it enough to leave after two years - they really foster a lot of unpleasantness between the students in competing for the limited amount of student aid that is available.&nbsp; That being said, the professors at Columbia are top-rate and the campus is wonderful.&nbsp; It really boils down to what is the best fit for you.

				I would concur with mcdirk to consider the funding issue carefully.&nbsp; I considered Columbia a number of years ago when I was looking into programs for art history (East Asia), and although the funding structure was undergoing revision, the amount of funding that students received (if at all) was all over the place.&nbsp; I now use the East Asian library on a regular basis, and although I&#39;ve gotten to know the staff and they&#39;re really friendly and helpful, the library itself is disappointing - disorganized, a lot of things in storage that in my opinion, should be on the shelf.&nbsp; I&#39;ve found books at the NYPL that Columbia didn&#39;t have or had lost.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend contacting the department administrator and asking to be in touch with the students of the professors you&#39;d be applying to work with.&nbsp; What&#39;s your area of interest?&nbsp; The department is particularly strong for literature and history.&nbsp; They host an annual summer workshop in kanbun which is pretty well attended by students from all over.&nbsp; The Donald Keene Center is very active, and there&#39;s a well-organized graduate student conference.

				I know a few people that went there. I guess it depends if you can pay for it afterwards. If you get a phd in asian studies are you going to be able to publish a book or a get a grant that will cover the cost. <br />

				Yes, it&#39;s the whole &quot;paying for it afterwards&quot; bit that I&#39;m kind of concerned about.&nbsp; I would be very interested in publishing a book and I wouldn&#39;t half mind getting a grant either but I don&#39;t see either of those options as a foregone conclusion...&nbsp; &nbsp;:-(

				Related to this, if anyone has the scuttlebutt on whether or not I should take the GRE this spring or opt for the new GRE this fall I&#39;m all ears.&nbsp; So far from what I&#39;ve read the new computer test will be more user-friendly, allowing you to skip ahead or jump back to certain sections unlike before.&nbsp;
