			<strong>Annwyn</strong>:

			Got a small apartment and don&#039;t know how to make it more functional? &nbsp;Or maybe you just need help de-cluttering or creating a filing system to avoid papers piling up, bills going unpaid, and stacks of belongings getting so unwieldy that they take up tons of your space and mental energy!<br /><br />I help people with this kind of stuff, and more! &nbsp;Sometimes simple amendments to your home environment can help. &nbsp;<br /><br />Organizing closets, storage spaces, and creating positive home-offices, and &quot;sacred spaces&quot; are also things that I specialize in. &nbsp;Also, I do &quot;space-clearing&quot; which is a ritual to remove negative or stagnant energy in a space. &nbsp;<br /><br />Here is my website:<br /><br />www.harmonizeddesigns.com<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Marianne

			Are too many piles of papers preventing you from finding the important things you need right now?<br /><br />Is the way your apartment looks ruining your day?<br /><br />Do you have printouts from three years ago that you just need sorted and filed?<br /><br />Do you need to learn how to make the best use of the space in your apartment?<br /><br />Do you need to set up a more functional system to help you remember to pay bills, call friends and colleagues, track projects, and just be more productive?<br /><br />Do you want help in creating daily rituals that will create the day you WANT rather than the day that just “HAPPENS”?<br /><br />Do you like the idea of creating a Sacred Space in your home but not sure how to do it?<br /><br />Let Harmonized Designs help you with these things! &nbsp;<br /><br />I would love more clients in Astoria / LIC and am offering a discount for all who live in these areas.<br /><br />www.harmonizeddesigns.com<br />info@harmonizeddesigns.com<br />646-691-0891
