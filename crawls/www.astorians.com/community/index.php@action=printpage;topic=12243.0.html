				My wife and I ate here tonight, and I must say that it was absolutely amazing!&nbsp; To start we shared a vegetable chopped salad and duck truffle potato gnocchi.&nbsp; The salad was really good and the gnocchi was to die for.&nbsp; For the main course, I had the Braised Lamb Shank and my wife had the Organic Strip Loin.&nbsp; Both dishes were outstanding; the lamb was falling off the bone.&nbsp; We had chocolate cake for dessert which was really good, as well.&nbsp; I would HIGHLY recommend this place.&nbsp; They had a large selection with a wide range of prices, and I thought the prices were very reasonable for the quality of the food.&nbsp; It&#039;s one of the most satisfying meals I&#039;ve had in New York.&nbsp; I&#039;m excited to try their brunch!<br /><br />Here&#039;s the main menu (http://boiteacafe.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/floor-menu.pdf)<br /><br />

				My boyfriend and I went last night to try the special $15 Tuesday Prix Fixe. We brought a nice French bottle from Grand Wines and strolled down to the restaurant.<br /><br />The decor didn&#039;t thrill me from the outside, as it looked incredibly blue lit, but once inside, the candles and accent lighting filled the place very warmly and created a casual, comfortable atmosphere. The tables are spaced reasonably and they don&#039;t seat people right on top of each other.<br /><br />The food was amazing. The carrot soup we had for the first course is easily the best soup I&#039;ve ever had. The chicken main course had a delightful sauce and was especially tender. The spinach and tomato bed that the chicken was presented on was also amazing. We shared duck gnocchi, which was tender and succulent and he had the snapper as his main course. I usually do not like fish, but I was jealous that I had not risked it and gotten the snapper. It was light, flaky and flavored wonderfully on a bed of what I think were pine nuts, finely chopped. For desert, we had crepes, which were good, but the soup and entrees were much better.<br /><br />This is definitely some of the best food I&#039;ve had in Astoria, and might be the best overall.<br /><br />The servers were nice enough and very attentive.<br /><br />However, there was one problem which really rubbed&nbsp; me the wrong way.<br /><br />We had brought a rather expensive, nice bottle of French wine as we had been invited to do when we made our reservations (which you don&#039;t need). When we took the bottle out, they took it behind the bar to open. <strong>They corked the bottle.</strong> Not only did the cork a nice bottle of wine, <strong>neither the bartender nor the waitress so much as mentioned this to us.</strong> I understand that particularly with older bottles, corks can and do break. I also understand that they do not have a wine license, so I cannot expect their servers to be particularly trained with regards to wine. However, to not even say something, to just set it on the table, was a real bummer.<br /><br />I certainly recommend the restaurant, I would just recommend that if you bring your own bottle, you also bring your own wine key.

				Checked out the $15 Tues night special, which is now $18 (they really oughta fix the website!) Started with the butternut squash/sweet potato soup; then the tuna &quot;as you like it&quot; while BF had the steak; dessert was crepes with pastry cream and a teeny tiny bit of sauce (why are they so skimpy with it??) <br /><br />Brought our own bottle of Merlot and had a nice time. We weren&#039;t blown away (it wasn&#039;t a splurge!) but would definitely go back to try the other fare we&#039;ve heard so much about. Have told others about it too. We and one other person were the only ones there, truly surprising (even if it was around 8:30pm.)&nbsp; <br /><br />Definitely great food :mrgreen:<br /><br />Do they have their liquor license yet?

				We went again to the Bistro last night and had the $18 Prix Fixe. It&#039;s just an incredible deal. We brought a bottle of wine.<br /><br />The soup was a sweet acorn butternut squash soup. We had steaks and then had a mocha flan and a creme brulee for desert. Everything was very good. <br /><br />The quality of food that you get for $18 is absolutely ridiculous.<br /><br />We were talking over dinner--only one other couple came in--about what a shame it seems like there&#039;s no way this place can stay in business. The location isn&#039;t great, the decor is crappy, but the food and the price point are to die for.

				I&#039;ve been coming here for brunch on a regular basis now when Grand Cafe ($12 for brunch with coffee and one drink) is just too loud or crowded. Boite is cheaper than Bistro 33, Ovelia, or Indigo, and has a completely different atmosphere. If you&#039;re not looking for a &quot;scene&quot; with your eggs, this is the place. Their homemade basket of muffins and pastries is something I was reluctant to pay for but it&#039;s a nice treat once in a while and actually the pastries (scones, muffins, etc..) are really good. Their waitstaff is very sweet and accomodating and since they don&#039;t have a huge clientele yet are always happy to greet me and my hubby. We brought a few friends here, individually, and in groups, to try to get the word out and they were really appreciative of that. I haven&#039;t tried their 18 pre-fixe yet, but have had dinner and am equally happy about price/value of food.

				Did this place close?&nbsp; The sign has been down for a few weeks now but the inside still looks intact.

				Different owner, same chef (so we were told) and lots of beer advertising inside. Food is still good, but the atmosphere changed from ok to not so great.

				According to the papers posted on the door and windows, the places is now called Aroma à Café. (I think there are some accents or some such over a couple vowels in &quot;Aroma&quot; also.)
