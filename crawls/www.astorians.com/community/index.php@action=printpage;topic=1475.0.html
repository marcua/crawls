				Mundo is excellent. But small. If Mundo wins out, it would probably be wise to pop in to book the majority of the restaurant. It seats about 30 people i think.<br />Hopefully i can join in the foody fun!<br />mmmmmmmm, fooooooood&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />Jenn

				Philoxenia seats about 25, I think, and there&#39;s rumors it might not be around much longer...<br /><br />Wave Thai probably seats 40 or so, but it&#39;s been very crowded recently!<br /><br />Balkh&#39;s good, and they&#39;ve got some big tables in the back. In the summer, they have a nice outdoor area too...<br /><br />If we&#39;re going to be consistently over 20 people, maybe we should think about having dinners more often, but flip coins (or something) to see who goes? I, for one, would like to talk with most of the people, and if you&#39;ve got 25 people on a banquet table, it&#39;s not gonna happen...!<br />

				Jennifer&#39;s posting reminds me of a dinner I went to once where there were name cards and each one had THREE names on it.&nbsp; After each course, guests in good fun flipped the name card once and got up to find their new seats!&nbsp; It was fun (it was only a 3-course meal) but we managed to baffle the restaurant staff.<br />&nbsp;:lol:<br /><br />I&#39;d like to vote for Mundo or Philoxenia.<br />

				Thinking out loud:<br />There were way too many people friday night for talking with everyone.<br />But I dont like the idea of getting up and moving around the table while im eating and drinking<br />I do like the idea of taking over a place so we can mingle<br />Lets keep planning these dinners, im sure it wont always be so many of us.<br />These dinners have been great, lets not mess with them.<br />potluck dinner somewhere?<br /><br />We could also plan a mixer once a month or so at a bar, lounge, cafe, etc... for drinks, snacks, and mingling.&nbsp; maybe get a bar/lounge to set up a happy hour buffet for us and we could take over part of the place???&nbsp; (i like this idea).<br /><br />And of course the obvious, when the warm weather hits, we grab some tables at the beer garden for the monthly astorians free for all!<br /><br />So, back to dinner...&nbsp; mussels and fries out, kebabs in??&nbsp; feb 24th works for us.<br /><br />And now back to your regular stream of consciousness

				February 24th...<br />good for me<br />good for Jonathan and Jennifer<br />anyone else? another day?<br />If its cool, then we&#39;ll paln for that.<br /><br />i would like to offer up Mombar...whats the word?<br /><br />and i totally agree on a mixer at a bar another night. i would toss in Rapture. If you get there around 7:30 you can still take advantage of the happy hour and get your second drink free! (it ends at 8 ) and there is a partitioned second area that we could take over chock full of seating. And their typical bar fare is even good for those who need to munch while drinking! I would say on a light note friday night the 10th for drinks and mingling? i might anyway cause its down the block from us! yes? in?<br /><br />i think thats enough outta me tonight. ta ta all!<br /><br />sooz

About 6 months ago, a waiter there said they weren&#39;t really zoned for a restaurant there, and said they were planning to move somewhere else. They obviously haven&#39;t. About 3 weeks ago, someone on Chowhound said that they had heard it was closing soon. Someone should hike over there and ask them exactly what&#39;s going on! I hope it moves, rather than closes...<br />

				If you are planning to go to Philoxenia you better hurry up. They will be closing soon, they are losing there current spot. From what I heard there are trying to find another spot in the area. I will talk to some people and find out when they are closing and where they will be moving to.

The music we play runs the gamut from acid jazz to punk, trip hop to rock to house.

If there was a good, affordable Italian place I&#39;d vote for that. Most of the Italian I&#39;ve seen around here seems to be either a pizza joint or priced like Trattoria L&#39;Incontro... My 2nd place vote would be Balkh, and Mundo would be OK too...<br />
