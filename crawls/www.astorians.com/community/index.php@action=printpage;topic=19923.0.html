				Vesta owner Giuseppe Falco is quoted in the new Boro Mag (for Astoria &amp; LIC) saying that he plans to open another new restaurant soon:<br /><br />http://boromag.com/featured/local-food-chain-fosters-delicious-community-roots/ (http://boromag.com/featured/local-food-chain-fosters-delicious-community-roots/)<br /><br />Anyone know where?&nbsp; Hoping it&#039;s near Ditmars!

				I was told it was going to be Mexican or Mexican-influenced. Something along those lines. I&#039;m excited to see what kinds of twists they bring! 31st Ave.

				<br />http://weheartastoria.com/2010/12/12-days-of-giveaways-day-3-vesta/<br /><br />not sure of details or how long, but jealous that someone will be a brunch guest at Vesta. Cheers.<br />Looking forward to seeing something new open as well.<br /><br /><br />OT where in Astoria would you most want a gift certificate?<br />For me, maybe Waltz

				So now we can have two places that overcharge for small portions of&nbsp; &nbsp;inconsistant quality food.

				Small portions of inconsistent quality food? I couldn&#039;t disagree more. Vesta is excellent; service, portions, and quality are all very high in my opinion. To suggest they &quot;overcharge&quot; isn&#039;t really fair either. To me, that means that they tell you one price and then charge you another. They don&#039;t do that. Perhaps you mean they are overpriced? I wouldn&#039;t agree with that either. The good news is that if you don&#039;t like the restaurant, you don&#039;t have to go...but to those of us who enjoy high quality establishments opening in Astoria, this is a good thing.

				I&#039;ve always thought that Vesta has very reasonable prices.&nbsp; I&#039;ve enjoyed a lot of good food there, and have always felt that they are pretty much in a class of their own in terms of customer service in Astoria.&nbsp; Few other places make you feel as welcome and appreciated as Vesta does.&nbsp; I&#039;d have to say that&#039;s a pretty effective combination of strengths, and why I&#039;m very interested in any new place the owners would be opening.
