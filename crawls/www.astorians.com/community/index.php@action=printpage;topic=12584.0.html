				I was just curious if the young kids are allowed to wear them at school on Halloween. Our school has said no because they can be scary and cause disruption. They&#039;ve also said no to any kind of Halloween treats because they are typically not healthy. I&#039;m feeling bad for the kids-I mean how many young kids end up wearing scary Halloween costumes?

				I know that in middle school and high school they aren&#039;t allowed because they are concerned about kids slipping in gang colors (I taught in a high school years ago) so to avoid it they wouldn&#039;t let anyone wear costumes. If a teacher wore halloween paraphenalia&nbsp; like ghost earings, they got a reprimand and note in their file. <br /><br />Some pre-schools don&#039;t go for it becuase they don&#039;t want to be help responsible for expensive costumes.

				my school (6th - 12) celebrates Halloween.&nbsp; Teachers and kids dress up.&nbsp; Kids aren&#039;t allowed to wear costumes to school they have to change at school and then out of costume again before they leave so that they don&#039;t get harassed on the streets near the school.&nbsp; The younger kids get into it - the older kids mostly just use it as a &quot;get out of uniform&quot; day. <br /><br />

				My son is in a public elementary school and the kids are allowed to participate in a parade around the block of the school in their Halloween costumes.&nbsp; It is for all grades up to 5th grade but the kids have to wear regular clothes under their costume.&nbsp; They come to school in the costume and after the parade they have to be able to remove them by themselves.&nbsp; Makeup is not allowed because then the teachers would have to help the kids remove it.
