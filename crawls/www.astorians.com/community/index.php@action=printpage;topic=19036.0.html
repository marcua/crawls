				I used to take lessons at Hunter college and had a great time playing, but the lessons are more than I can afford right now. I go once in a while to the handball court and try to get a good rhythm going, but it is really limiting in what you can do. Does anyone know of a good way for a beginner to get their game on affordably?

				Find someone willing to hit with you on an actual tennis court. Handball courts are good for exercise and practice but b/c they are so tall and you are hitting the ball cement off cement, it moves fast and you&#039;ll spend a lot of time perfecting bad habits. At least that&#039;s been true for me. I&#039;ve been stuck w/handball courts for practice since moving here b/c I haven&#039;t been able to find consistently available tennis partners. <br />On the bright side, it&#039;s a great workout!<br />*Roosevelt Island Racquet Club has a ball machine. It&#039;s not a great ball machine and the courts are clay but when I&#039;m desperate for some variety, I suck it up and pay the exorbitant rate ($70-$80 per hour) to use it.

				Go to Astoria park and just start hitting with people. If you&#039;re good the better players will notice you eventually and want to hit with you. The wall is a great practice partner to work on fundamentals. You can always let the ball bounce twice if it comes back too fast. You can even practice volleys and overheads off the wall, but don&#039;t over do it at the wall. Half an hour is more than enough- it can be very tiring.<br />Has anybody tried the Sportime at Randall&#039;s Island?
