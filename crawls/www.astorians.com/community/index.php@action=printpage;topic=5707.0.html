				Everyone - although someone has started a thread regarding the noise pollution already, I had to begin a new one because we (my neighbors and I) have been fighting this for years and have a bit of experience.<br /><br />Yes indeed, every one of us must call 311 immediately.&nbsp; This is where the calls get logged and even the Mayor has a look every now and then.&nbsp; If the bikes are racing, which they often are, you may be put through to 911, which is fine, because racing is an illegal and dangerous activity.&nbsp; Also, you should put in a call to our local precinct, 718-626-9311.&nbsp; If they ask you to call 311, say the following - Thank you, I have already called 311 but since YOU are our local precinct and since you are responsible for the area, you need to know so that you can respond.&nbsp; You must then give them the location where the bikes are creating the noise.&nbsp; You should also tell them that these motorcycles gather by the East River, near Astoria Park.<br /><br />My neighbors and I have begun distributing fliers regarding this.&nbsp; If any of you are interested in giving out fliers and spreading the word, please send me an e-mail and I will send you an attachment. <br /><br />We have been dealing with this for years, but this is the first time that I truly feel we can make a difference!&nbsp; We must bombard them with calls.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />DR

				Not being involved in the above, but living on 21st near the park, I REALLY don&#039;t think a vespa is a problem! Nor is your average motorcycle. But when something &#039;hotted up&#039; ie: the muffler has been removed, is driven at high, loud speeds repeatedly (ie: they are clearly doing circuits of the area) for an entire day/evening, generally in a pack of them (at least 2 or more bikes at a time), THEN we have a problem. Lets also add that there&#039;s an awful lot of needless revving going on. I have lived with people who own bikes, my father included, ridden a couple (tho not on my own) and have nothing against them in the normal course of things. This is not the normal course and I completely agree with the campaign to get this sort of behaviour policed because it is very disturbing to residents. Running red lights and speeding is also included in the behaviour - I&#039;ve had to jump out of the way just crossing the road in front of my house, with the lights in my favour.. <br /><br />

				The NYPD needs to do a better job.&nbsp; I also recommend speaking about the issue at the 114th Precinct Community Council (this evening).&nbsp; The noise from loud motorcycles is deafening and a blight.&nbsp; A lot of the riders who race and cruise in the area don&#039;t even live here in Astoria.<br /><br />Motorcycles with stock exhaust systems are quiet, but many riders illegally install or modify the exhaust system to make them incredibly loud.&nbsp; You can get more info here: http://www.noiseoff.org/motorcycles.shtml<br />

				I think when people talk about &quot;motorcycles&quot; that are noisy they don&#039;t have anything against bikes themselves per-se. It&#039;s just (as others are pointing out) the bikes that are modified after they are purchased and have the mufflers removed or modified. This makes them extremely loud. You can do the same thing to a car, but most people don&#039;t do it. If there were a lot of that going on you&#039;d get the same response though. Noise is really the issue first, and second is that many of the people that have these modified bikes drag race up and down some of the streets in our neighborhood. If you don&#039;t live on a street where they do this you&#039;re lucky. I&#039;ve seen several people nearly get hit by these guys, and they frequently run the red light in front of my apartment.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=5707.msg64488.html#msg64488">Quote from: Alexa on March 26, 2007, 09:47:51 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Can someone explain to me what is considered excessive noise and what is considered dangerous activity.

				Hey Don,<br /><br />I don&#039;t mind bikes at all, as a matter of fact, they are preferable I think to cars because they take up so much less space and are more fuel efficient.

				I agree with Merm.&nbsp; Motorcycles are not the problem, motorcylces with straight pipes and engaging in exhibitionist behavior are the problem.&nbsp; Many people ride responsibly, and I don&#039;t think anyone has a problem with them, but that does not change the fact that some folks use their motorcycles to make noise and draw attention to themselves, for whatever purpose.

				Thank you so much for starting this thread. What is it with Astoria and exhibitionists on modified bikes? I have the joy of living on 42nd Street near Broadway, a few blocks from the Harley Davidson Store on Northern Blvd, so I definitely know all the noise and speed. We are also lucky enough to have two of these exhibitionists living on our street who love to rev for 1/2 an hour and do laps to set off every car alarm in the neighborhood. I will happily call 311, but I have noticed that some cops are owners of these of bikes, so do they really care?

				The Harley&#039;s were racing up and down the street last night (Ditmars), and cross streets (28th St, 29th St, 23rd Ave) from 10PM, through Midnight. And at 2:45AM there were 3 modified bikes that were racing by as well. This is the loudest I&#039;ve ever heard them. I&#039;ve emailed Vallone (http://www.nyccouncil.info/constituent/email_form.cfm?con_id=79), and filed complaints with 311. Please consider doing the same if you hear them - there is no reason for this level of noise in a neighborhood at 2:45AM.

				I&#039;ll agree with merm that last night was the <strong>absolute loudest</strong> I have ever heard them. They kept going around the block and doing it over and over and over again. We usually have nature sounds going on at night to block out outside noises/traffic when we sleep, but last night whenever they would drive by they were blocking out our nature noises. A-holes. :x

				I&#039;d like to add to all of this that motorcycles with modified or removed mufflers are not merely a nuisance/disturbance. The high frequencies and decibel levels (especially those incredibly loud &quot;gun shot&quot; noises) can cause real damage to your hearing, especially if you are a pedestrian on the street as they go whizzing by. This is a real noise pollution/public health issue. Protect your ears!!!

				Speed bumps along Hoyt for starters.<br /><br />Snipers- you know, round up the people with criminal tendencies who would otherwise shoot innocent people, and let them have at it with the motorcycles. Cheap and effective.<br /><br />(Okay, that&#039;s pushing it, but it&#039;s one of those fantasy-solutions of mine when I get really upset about it........how about if we give them pellets instead of bullets?&nbsp; :roll: )

				Last weekend, police were staked out on 20th avenue and ticketing illegal engines/(whatever makes them loud, I have no idea) and no helmuts. <br /><br />If something is illegal, I get it and it is annoying. I&#039;ve walked by these guys and it actually offends my aural cavities. If you don&#039;t like it because it is a regular motorcylce and it is too loud, you live in the wrong city.

				oh, one more bit that ticks me off about the motorcycles.<br /><br />There is a guy in our neighborhood that takes up a whole parking space for his bike. I was driving around looking for parking for 40min (alt-side) and this douche bag took up whole spot! Meanwhile, there is a space between two driveways. It&#039;s about 5-6ft long (too short for a car) always available! Talk about selfish.<br /><br />

				Even as a motorcycle rider, and a somewhat loud one at that, I understand where you guys are coming from.&nbsp; Racing on city streets, revving the engine needlessly, or even riding in packs late at night is not very conscientious of those around you.&nbsp; Living in a city that is so crowded, we all owe it to ourselves to watch out for others wishes (I won&#039;t go into anything about people on cell phones, texting, honking, etc.).&nbsp; <br /><br />I will speak in &quot;I,&quot; just for simplification.&nbsp; I&#039;m not making an attack or defending myself so much as I&#039;m trying to play Devil&#039;s Advocate :evil:.&nbsp; There are always at least two sides to every argument.<br /><br />As for the parking in full car spaces: First of all, my main goal is to be able to chain my motorcycle to a street sign.&nbsp; Coming with living in such a dense city, also comes the added bonus of a higher theft rate.&nbsp; Since finding a garage that is reasonably priced or allows sharing with other motorcycles is tough, I am unable to properly secure my motorcycle off the street.&nbsp; Chaining it to a sign is about the best deterrant I have.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just because the motorcycle is smaller and could fit between two driveways, doesn&#039;t mean that I should be forced to not secure it if I can, just because I might take up an entire spot on the street.&nbsp; I pay the same registration and insurance that you do and should be afforded the same rights.&nbsp; You have the same access to the spaces as I do.<br /><br />Also, I have had an issue with someone hitting my motorcycle when I was parked perpendicular to the curb to save space, in between cars.&nbsp; There was enough room for them to parallel park but, whoever it was, didn&#039;t look or realize the bike was back there, and they hit it, knocking it over.&nbsp; They also weren&#039;t kind enough to leave a note and my insurance had to cover it.&nbsp; Not fun for me.<br /><br />But, there is an easy way to address the situation: Write them a note asking if they would mind parking in the spot between two driveways.&nbsp; If the person is chaining up their motorcycle, they might not want to park it in the smaller spot (if there is not a sign there) and try to understand why.&nbsp; If it continues to aggravate you, then maybe you could work out a deal to help secure them a spot around a sign (eg, park a little behind/in front of one so that it can be held for them).&nbsp; Personally, I&#039;d be willing to do that; they might too.<br /><br />I&#039;d also be more than willing to park on the sidewalk on the passenger side of the road, if I didn&#039;t get a ticket or end up ticking someone off who can&#039;t get out of their car as easily (so, they have to let people out BEFORE getting to the spot).<br /><br />We all have to live together and put up with each other&#039;s actions, all within reason, of course.&nbsp; I agree with calling 311 about excessive noise and definitely with calling 911 on anything that endangers lives.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, it can definitely go too far that it would affect us legal riders.&nbsp; The cops won&#039;t be able to tell us apart and we&#039;ll be harassed, just because we happen to be on a motorcycle in Astoria.&nbsp; <br /><br />I can&#039;t go off on every person I hear telling a stupid story about breaking up with their sig. other while riding on the train because it&#039;s not illegal to talk on the phone in public.&nbsp; Even if I&#039;d like to stand on the platform and interrupt their conversations.&nbsp; All I ask, as a motorcycle rider, is that there doesn&#039;t become a vendetta against all riders.<br /><br />Thanks for listening to my opinion.&nbsp;

				Well, the noise pollution season is in full swing&nbsp; :oops: The other night, I couldn&#039;t sleep AT ALL due to the violent noises outside my window.

				Here is a better way to handle motorcycle (and boom car) noise problems:<br /><br />Call 311 and file a complaint every night that you hear loud motorcycles.&nbsp; Copy down the incident numbers as they give them to you.<br /><br />Call or visit the 114th Precinct and request to speak to Community Affairs (Officer Chatham, Officer Caponay).&nbsp; Present the incident numbers that show there is a history of motorcycle noise in your immediate area.&nbsp; Go to the 114th Precinct Council monthly meetings and speak directly with Inspector McCarthy.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t speak up about it, the problem will continue.<br /><br />The NYPD currently has Operation Silent Night program where they target noise offenders.&nbsp; Riders caught with loud aftermarket exhaust systems can receive a summons.&nbsp; Also, the revised noise codes take effect on July 1st that will hopefully give the NYPD additional enforcement powers in handling problems like this.<br />

				Isn&#039;t 911 for emergencies only?&nbsp; Noise isn&#039;t an emergency and should be reported to 311, the department of environmental protection or the local precinct.&nbsp; 911 operators are not supposed to handle noise complaints, and one wouldn&#039;t want to tie up the phonelines from real emergencies.&nbsp; You should report the noise, but just to the right department :)

				You know what? We need to rethink &quot;noise pollution&quot; as more than a mere nuiscance; it&#039;s harassment. If somebody kept pounding on my door shouting, &quot;<em>Wake up!! Wake up!!!&quot; </em> all night long, I wouldn&#039;t be calling 311.<br /><br />In any case, every time I DO call 311, they put me right through to 911. It takes less time to call 911 directly (so the 311 operator doesn&#039;t need to explain to 911 what it&#039;s about first as per procedure.) Each call takes about a minute and a half, and I&#039;m not the least bit worried that I&#039;m &quot;tying up the line.&quot; <br /><br />This morning, there were cars and motorcycles SO LOUD around 6:30, I wanted to cry from exhaustion. They stopped around 8 and the silence was beautiful, but I had to get up by then.<br /><br />

				While jogging around the park tonight, noticed quite a few cops on Shore Drive, and they looked busy. When one obnoxious Harley dude turned right to go up toward Ditmars, one of the cops headed in that direction.<br /><br />Don&#039;t know if they were specifically looking for motorcycles, but it was good to see.<br /><br />Right now, just had to call 911 as the drag racing has started loud as ever. I&#039;ll take my phone to bed if need be, some of these guys are brutally obnoxious beyond the basic annoying loudness.

				Christine, have you tried calling the local precinct? I would think they&#039;d be more well-equipped to deal with it than 311 or 911. I understand that noise is a big issue, but I wouldn&#039;t call 911 about motorcycles just as I wouldn&#039;t call 911 about the guys upstairs playing atrociously loud music every night. Both things keep us awake and make us very angry, but 911 isn&#039;t around to deal with that sort of thing.<br /><br />But getting so worked up about the motorcycles is not helping your ability to sleep. For your own sake, try to calm down about it, while you calmly call the local precinct and calmly write letters to the local council members and possibly even Bloomberg about getting cops to enforce noise laws at night, if they&#039;re going to at all. To the motorcycle riders: enjoying your bike around the park is one thing, but it&#039;s not right to be cruising around on a purposely loud bike for all hours of the night in a residential area. <br /><br />And this isn&#039;t meant to be patronizing so don&#039;t take it as such, but if you don&#039;t already have a fan in your room, that could also help to drown out the noise in the meantime so it&#039;s not quite as startling.

				I once called the 114th precinct about making a report when my windshield got smashed (http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=5625.0) (omg, I&#039;ll never let that go, haha), and they told me to call 911. I was like, &quot;really? This isn&#039;t exactly an emergency - the car is being fixed, it happened last night sometime, no one is hurt, I just wanted to have a report done for my records,&quot; and he told me again to call 911. So, if its not an emergency, it might be good to call 311 or the precinct, but they might tell you to call 911.<br /><br />I live on Steinway, and they were screaming north on my street last night, pretty late (maybe 1 am?). I heard them coming, and I looked out the window just in time to see 3 bikes blow through the red light at 21st Ave (good thing no one was traveling through the intersection) and they were FLYING. I don&#039;t have any experience estimating speeds, but they were going way, WAY faster than I&#039;ve ever seen anyone go on I-95 (I used to have a view of 95 at my old job in CT, and the average speed was 70ish). How they don&#039;t crash and burn every night, I have no idea.<br /><br />I had never heard them before, but maybe that&#039;s because I&#039;m usually asleep at that hour. Seeing them blow that light was scary - I don&#039;t drive a ton, but when I do, I do a lot of my driving at off-times. If I had been driving right then on 21st Ave, I would have just traveled through the light like normal, and probably been killed, even in a car - they were definitely going fast enough to do some MAJOR damage.<br /><br />I have to admit, I didn&#039;t call 311/the precinct/whoever (neg nod me now!) but I did wait a little while to see if they came through again. They didn&#039;t, but if they had, I would have called.

				911 is an odd thing.&nbsp; Years ago, I was visiting my brother in Manhattan when I didn&#039;t live in the city.&nbsp; He called 911 because a car alarm was going off.&nbsp; I thought that was crazy, but they took care of it.<br /><br />Years later, I called 311 (what a great invention!) because a car alarm was going off for a half an hour.&nbsp; They put me through to 911.&nbsp; It seems that some &quot;non-emergencies&quot; still go to 911, so don&#039;t bother discouraging people from calling it.&nbsp; It&#039;s the proper protocol.

				I&#039;m new to this side of Astoria and to the website in general, but have we tried organizing ourselves and going to a police council meeting about this. They meet the 2nd Tuesday of every month, if there are a bunch of us they would have to take it seriously.&nbsp; I agree with the others that I have no problem with someone riding legally, but the races and the noise are out of control on Astoria Blvd at night.&nbsp; Would anyone be up to going to the Police Council?

				we were talking to a few neighbors outside our building this morning about doing exactly that - i think there would be a good turnout if we try and get a group together for the next council meeting (Tues July 10, i think).&nbsp; Wow, before I could even type that one sentence, 2 bikes screamed past my window.<br /><br />and by the way - i&#039;ve also had mixed feelings about being put through to 911.&nbsp; but when i look down shore blvd and see an ice cream truck sitting there with kids all over the place, i think it&#039;s totally appropriate to agree to speak to 911.&nbsp; <br /><br />though, last summer a drunk driver with a car full of people blew the stop sign and hit the barricades to the river well past midnight.&nbsp; it was an open-window night and woke everyone on the block.&nbsp; i&#039;ll bet we all called 911 and it took them an astonishingly long time to show up...maybe an hour?&nbsp; so i wonder what kind of an impact our calls have, other than creating a good 311 record.<br /><br />anyway a trip to the next tuesday night meeting could help salvage some peaceful summer nights...i plan to be there.

				Am I going deaf?&nbsp; It is a lovely Saturday night and I am sitting in my Living Room on 19th Street opposite Astoria Park and have not heard a single motorcycle go by for over two hours.&nbsp; I did receive a response to my letter from our precinct claiming that they are really clamping down hard on the racing motorcycles.&nbsp; Apparently, they have issued many summonses and even arrested a few individuals.&nbsp; Do you think the message is getting out?&nbsp; I have noticed a great many police cars in the area recently.&nbsp; Has anyone else noticed a difference?

				I must admit I&#039;ve noticed a few less motorcycles over the last few weeks. I still hear them racing down 29th Street every once and a while, but it&#039;s not quite as bad as the beginning of summer. It only happens maybe 3x a day now instead of 10x maybe. Last night I had a few bad ones racing down 29th Street near Ditmars at about 10:00pm, but after those two incidents it seemed a bit better.

				I&#039;m a motorcyclist- and I have to say, I probably get more annoyed than most of you do. I don&#039;t understand how I can easily ride a motorcycle without redlining my engine at every stoplight to make sure everyone in a 10 mile radius knows I&#039;m compensating. It&#039;s not that hard to ride my motorcycle at a reasonable noise level. I could even have an after market muffler on and still be able to keep it quiet. <br />It is really annoying that those jerks give us a bad rap in public, and I hope everyone on this board is able to make the distinction between a true rider, and an annoying over-revving poseur (Usually spotted by improper positioning of a helmet, and wearing a wife-beater, XL Shorts and Sandals while riding).

				Before anyone questions my position, I&#039;m a motorcycle rider AND an active community service volunteer with the police department...<br /><br />Astoria riders usually break up into a few sordid groups:<br /><br />1A) Sportbikers (Obnoxious type)<br />- These guys don&#039;t know the first thing about riding. No licence, no training, no helmet, bike is stolen and runs like absolute **** because they have no idea how to tune it. They spend more money on the frooty &quot;MotoGP Racer&quot; outfit then they actually spend on the bike itself. These are the dopes who only ride from their house to the park when the weather is clear so they can talk like 50cent, rev their motor and see who is loudest, pretend they&#039;re an outlaw moto-gang, and front about how cool they are. These people need to either get locked up, or smack into the nearest tree at a buck50...either way is fine by me, (provided they don&#039;t hurt anyone else in the process). Go down to Astoria park on a clear hot summer night and MARK MY WORDS...you&#039;ll see at least one guy wipe out or get ticketed while he&#039;s trying to outdo another guy&#039;s stunts.<br /><br />1B) Sportbikers (Cool type)<br />- These guys are harmless. They&#039;re moto enthusiasts with LEGITIMATELY EQUIPPED AND OPERATED sportbikes who don&#039;t go fast unless they&#039;re on a race track. You don&#039;t have to worry about these guys, and it&#039;s VERY easy to lump them together with the obnoxious sportbikers. For shame, if you do!<br /><br />2A) Harley guys (Obnoxious types)<br />- Midlife crisis 58 year old guy who wants to relive his 20&#039;s before his joints lock up from arthritis. Acts like he&#039;s Peter Fonda in Easy Rider. They&#039;re so different from the sportbikers that they&#039;re ALIKE! These guys too, are guilty of spending ludicrous amounts of money on a 20,000$ chrome p**is extension, throwing loud pipes on it, and pontificating about how their Harley is better than ANY other kind of bike. <br /><br />2B) Harley guys (Cool type)<br />- Again, generally middle aged gentlemen who know every nut and bolt of their bike and are just out there to enjoy the ride. Not only are they harmless, but being that they&#039;re older they can offer tons of good advice to any younger rider.<br /><br />3) Cruisers<br />- Not a sportbike, not a Harley. Just a plain looking bike. (Think: Honda CB) You don&#039;t see many cruiser bikes in Astoria, or in general because they are not popular around here. Cruisers are great on gas, generally not that quick, and mainly used for cheap transportation. You won&#039;t get much trouble from these guys.<br /><br />4) Chinese food delivery guys<br />- Just a joke, lol...<br /><br />I was in the park the other night, and some idiot poser decided to do a burnout under the Triboro. The smoke was so thick passing cars couldn&#039;t see a thing. Then it was like something out a movie...this marked patrol car cuts through the smoke like a flashing KNIFE and physically boxes in the offending rider. I don&#039;t know what happened as I had to leave, but he was standing there for a while with the rider. I&#039;m guessing something might have been up with the rider&#039;s paperwork?<br /><br />A good friend of mine is a 15+ year veteran cop at the 114, and I asked him about this &quot;Motorcycle Initiative&quot; they&#039;ve started...and he said it basically amounts to rustling up the guys under the Triboro and bangin&#039; them with tickets. I asked him what happens if a policeman sees a moving bike acting stupid, or if someone runs from a legit vehicle stop. He said the policy is &quot;BYE-BYE~!&quot; Quality of life complaints DO NOT justify the endangering of pedestrians, policemen, riders, and other passers by via a high speed pursuit. Therefore, In case it wasn&#039;t stressed enough already, I want to stress again: NYPD cannot and <span class="bbc_u">WILL NOT</span> chase a motorcycle in motion unless the rider just committed a MAJOR crime. Even then, there is a slim to nil chance you&#039;re catching a 120 horsepower sportbike that weighs all of 400 pounds...with a big stupid CrownVic. The long and short of it is that if you see/hear a motorcycle acting like a jerk, just remember this: <br /><br />Motorcycles are the ULTIMATE Darwin tool. Be civilized and you&#039;re ok, act like a jerk and I assure you the other option is not as appealing...<br /><br />I&#039;m all about anti-crime initiatives, but it really burns me when I see resources wasted like this. Go read up on community occurences, and you&#039;ll see that due to shortages, our leaders have just taken away another two policeman &quot;slots&quot; at our 114, meaning there&#039;s now two less policemen working in there. This stupid city can&#039;t even keep the veteran cops from running away, nor can it convince 21 YEAR OLD COLLEGE KIDS to sign up for a paltry 25k a year (before the tax-man!)...and now we gotta waste time breaking motorcyclists&#039; chops? I say give Traffic Agents the power to go down there and bang offensive riders with tickets, and let the regular police deal with assaults, robberies, etc. (Sorry if that paragraph was off topic.)<br /><br />To anyone who paints all motos with one brush and/or is pro-ZERO-tolerance, I say this: Be careful what you wish for because you just might get it. You say you want tougher police presence to bust motos? Odds are if you want the police to use zero discretion, then I&#039;ll bet you are the same one who would turn around afterwards and complain that &quot;THEY&#039;RE JUST SITTING THERE NOT DOING ANYTHING BUT WRITING TICKETS!&quot; or &quot;THIS INCREASED COP PRESENCE FEELS LIKE A POLICE STATE!!<br /><br />P.S.- Glad to join the board!<br /><br />

				The noise is a quality of life issue.&nbsp; Enough is enough.&nbsp; Thank you for all the distinctions; I am certain that the &#039;riders&#039; who plague us are of the Obnoxious type.&nbsp; Having lived here since the 70&#039;s, I can attest to the fact that the police were once able to control this.&nbsp; They used various methods.&nbsp; This happened the year that Peter Vallone Senior really decided to tighten the screws.&nbsp; I think he did this due to a personal experience with the bikes.&nbsp; Anyway, any police presence that puts an end to this is welcome by me, and I am not particularly thrilled by the thought of a &#039;police state&#039;.&nbsp; My experience with Police comes from Anti-war demonstrations and believe me, when the invasion of Iraq commenced, the cops were very tough.&nbsp; They arrested many of us and they were brutal in some cases.&nbsp; I would however, be absolutely thrilled if they were able to do something about the noise level that these bikes produce.&nbsp; They race, and they need to be stopped.

				It&#039;s a real quagmire, the obnoxious riders...<br /><br />I&#039;m not old enough to remember Vallone Senior&#039;s methods, and I wonder what they were? Maybe if that shoe fits we need to wear it! I can tell you firsthand that today&#039;s methods involve reposessing stolen bikes, arresting/ticketing illegit riders, and writing down licence plates of riders who jet from a vehicle stop, to be arrested at a later date...which is why you see dopes &quot;fold up&quot; their licence plate.<br /><br />It&#039;s getting to a point where unless somebody comes up with a creative and peaceful way to fix said quagmire, here is what will happen:<br /><br />Obnoxious riders will just take the licence plate off their bike, dress nondescript, and ride it with both middlefingers in the air MUCH FASTER than before to avoid EVERYONE, bucking every police checkpoint/vehicle stop until they reach their destination. It&#039;s very difficult to catch someone like that, because by the time the police radio squawks out a vague description &quot;male on a black bike wearing bright leather jacket&quot;...that rider is already in South Jersey!<br /><br />Nobody with a good brain wants a police state over loud motos, obviously. But yes, the racing and hot-dogging needs to be stopped and I&#039;m sure as we speak the department is cooking up something. I know TOO many guys who have gotten seriously wounded on motocycles, and one too many who DIED on their bikes. <br /><br />Now I don&#039;t wanna go off topic here, nor do I wanna say the department is perfect...but to their defense I will say that much like motorcyclists, the good work done by good motorcyclists (rides for cancer, rides for the children, charity-toy runs)... and good policemen (arresting thieves, rapists, busting obnoxious motos) is often besmirched and overlooked due to the bad apples in every bushel. Such a shame. :|<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=5707.msg79609.html#msg79609">Quote from: Debbie on June 28, 2007, 09:40:41 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The noise is a quality of life issue.&nbsp; Enough is enough.&nbsp; Thank you for all the distinctions; I am certain that the &#039;riders&#039; who plague us are of the Obnoxious type.&nbsp; Having lived here since the 70&#039;s, I can attest to the fact that the police were once able to control this.&nbsp; They used various methods.&nbsp; This happened the year that Peter Vallone Senior really decided to tighten the screws.&nbsp; I think he did this due to a personal experience with the bikes.&nbsp; Anyway, any police presence that puts an end to this is welcome by me, and I am not particularly thrilled by the thought of a &#039;police state&#039;.&nbsp; My experience with Police comes from Anti-war demonstrations and believe me, when the invasion of Iraq commenced, the cops were very tough.&nbsp; They arrested many of us and they were brutal in some cases.&nbsp; I would however, be absolutely thrilled if they were able to do something about the noise level that these bikes produce.&nbsp; They race, and they need to be stopped.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Generally speaking, it would be extremely hard to charge a biker with any degree of Harassment. Harassment, as defined in the 40th Chapter of NYS penal law requires that &quot;...He or she engages in a course of conduct or repeatedly commits acts which alarm or seriously annoy such other person and which serve no legitimate purpose...&quot; <br /><br />OR<br /><br />&quot;...He or she strikes, shoves, kicks or otherwise subjects such other person to physical contact, or attempts or threatens to do the same...&quot;<br /><br />Harassment is a crime committed BY one person AGAINST one person, not a group. It would be very hard to prove an obnoxious rider INTENTIONALLY follows ONE given person around with INTENT to piss them off with a loud bike, beyond all reasonable doubt. Harassment is more for a crazy ex who suffers from Fatal Attraction. :lol:<br /><br />I DEFINITELY see what you mean though :mrgreen:...obnoxious motos are <span class="bbc_u">VERY</span> aurally harassing, and I agree 100%. Unfortunately, short of the rider singling you and/or getting off his bike and shoving you, it&#039;s not possible to charge an obnoxious rider with any degree of Harassment. HOWEVER...I want to advise everyone the proper criminal offenses obnoxious moto riders can be charged with. Should you find yourself at any town meetings, feel free to speak out and cite these pieces of the NYS Penal law. Also, you may come to find yourself in a situation where you are asked by a policeman &quot;Do you wanna press charges?&quot;...and if you are, these are the criminal offenses you oughta aim for:<br /><br /><br />================================================<br />240.10 Unlawful assembly <br /><br />&nbsp;A person is guilty of unlawful assembly when he assembles with four or more other persons for the purpose of engaging or preparing to engage with them in tumultuous and violent conduct likely to cause public alarm, or when, being present at an assembly which either has or develops such purpose, he remains there with intent to advance that purpose. <br /><br />Unlawful assembly is a class B misdemeanor.<br />==============================================<br /><br /><br />==============================================<br /><br />240.20 Disorderly Conduct<br /><br />A person is guilty of disorderly conduct when, with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof: <br /><br />&nbsp;1. He engages in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior;&nbsp; or <br /><br />&nbsp;2. He makes unreasonable noise;&nbsp; or <br /><br />&nbsp;3. In a public place, he uses abusive or obscene language, or makes an obscene gesture;&nbsp; or <br /><br />&nbsp;4. Without lawful authority, he disturbs any lawful assembly or meeting of persons;&nbsp; or <br /><br />&nbsp;5. He obstructs vehicular or pedestrian traffic;&nbsp; or <br /><br />&nbsp;6. He congregates with other persons in a public place and refuses to comply with a lawful order of the police to disperse;&nbsp; or <br /><br />&nbsp;7. He creates a hazardous or physically offensive condition by any act which serves no legitimate purpose. <br /><br />Disorderly conduct is a violation. <br /><br />====================================================<br /><br /><br /><br />=====================================================<br />Section 120.20 Reckless endangerment in the second degree <br /><br />&nbsp;A person is guilty of reckless endangerment in the second degree when he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a substantial risk of serious physical injury to another person. <br /><br />&nbsp;Reckless endangerment in the second degree is a class A misdemeanor. <br /><br />=========================================================<br /><br />Section 120.25 Reckless endangerment in the first degree <br /><br />&nbsp;A person is guilty of reckless endangerment in the first degree when, under circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life, he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another person. <br /><br />&nbsp;Reckless endangerment in the first degree is a class D felony. <br /><br />==========================================================<br /><br /><br />========================================================<br /><br />Section 145.25 Reckless endangerment of property <br /><br />&nbsp;A person is guilty of reckless endangerment of property when he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a substantial risk of damage to the property of another person in an amount exceeding two hundred fifty dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;Reckless endangerment of property is a class B misdemeanor<br />=========================================================<br /><br /><br />Hope this helps. :police: :2cool:<br /><br />

				On July 1st, the new noise code takes effect that allows the NYPD officers to ticket motorcyclists if their vehicle is audible at 200 feet:<br /><br />SUBCHAPTER 6<br />SPECIFIC NOISE SOURCES<br />PLAINLY AUDIBLE AND OTHER STANDARDS<br />§24-236&nbsp; Motor vehicles.<br />(b) Motorcycles.&nbsp; No person shall cause or permit any motorcycle to operate on a public right-of-way where the muffler or exhaust generates a sound that is plainly audible to another individual at a distance of 200 feet or more from the motorcycle.<br />

				I hope the new noise code works.&nbsp; A lot of effort and thought went into crafting it, but the proof will be in how it works.&nbsp; I&#039;m praying it helps reign in my noisy nightclub neighbor and I would be happy if it can get the bad motorcycle folks to be more quiet.

				They&#039;re at it again tonight up near Ditmars. Saw a pack of 6 or so on the kawasaki-style motorbikes with colorful jackets and helmets. They go way to fast and the lead bike was popping a wheelie the whole way up 21st street RIGHT NEXT TO PS122 when kids were getting out of the after school program there. Saw and heard them again on Ditmars and down Crescent I think.<br /><br />Called 911, told them. &quot;Well send assistance right away&quot; the operator said. &quot;I don&#039;t need assistance! Go get these bikers!&quot;<br /><br />Hello? Any cops in Astoria these days? <br /><br />oh--I see some people got parking tickets today. :roll:

				I know this is an old thread, but it steams me that these groups of racing bikers are out nearly every Saturday night in the summer and nothing seems to be done about it. Tonight, they&#039;ve been racing up our block for the last hour (it&#039;s 2:00 am), and when I called the precinct to complain, there&#039;s no answer! A recording just advises you to call 311...and 311 is so swamped with noise complaints that they don&#039;t answer either--they just recommend filling out their &quot;Night Noise Survey&quot;...which doesn&#039;t get sent to any city agency. So...aside from earplugs, what are people doing about it?<br />
