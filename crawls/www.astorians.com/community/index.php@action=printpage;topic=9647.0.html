				If you&#039;d like Marino&#039;s to stay in business, and they just talked to my husband today about possibly closing down, I highly suggest you start patronizing them more often. These are the kinds of businesses, not just the cafes and restaurants, that need our money to stick around. Please please please go buy some fish!

				Is this a &quot; for sure closing because of high rents crappy business&quot;- or is it a &quot;thinking of closing due to possibly retiring&quot;?<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;In any event it is terrible news since they are probably the best fish monger we have in Astoria.

				Just a bit more information on this topic:&nbsp; It is not because of retiring.&nbsp; They were talking about a few things.&nbsp; <br />The bad economy and how it is affecting their retail and wholesale business.<br />How the old timers that used to line up at the end of the week for weekend fish dinners are mostly gone.<br />The younger people moving in mostly eat out or want pre-prepped dishes (like Whole foods). Or want single serving portions only.<br />And of course leases are going to sky rocket when the come up for renewal.<br /><br />Most of the great old school markets in Astoria will tell you the same thing.&nbsp; It&#039;s a shame, these markets and people are half the reason I want to live here.<br /><br />So next time you pass one of the old family run food shops, remember this, go buy some great products and cook your heart out.

Stores rarely went out of business. People knew each other by first names. Neighbor checked on neighbor. Friends shopped for each other. <br /><br />We didn&#039;t have clubs that made noise until all hours of the night. We didn&#039;t have garbage littered streets. We didn&#039;t have dog owners being careless about cleaning up. Our churches and Synagogues were packed on weekends. We didn&#039;t have to walk in single file up the avenues because some restaurant owners put tables and chairs out that blocked the walking paths. We had personal relationships with most of our fruit and vegetable, fish and meat vendors. We loved living here where our kids felt safe because kids from other neighborhoods knew that coming into Astoria and mugging and Astorian meant getting less than five bucks for the effort. <br />[/OT]<br /><br />Harlan (mods and merm), this is NOT a personal attack. This is the rantings of a lifelong resident finally having a light bulb, knee-jerk moment of sheer and utter disgust at the prospect of losing a business that has been an institution in this community for all these decades because people found Astoria a cheap(er) place to live and then decided to change the way it was because they refused to accept the way it had always been. The cavalier attitude with which some dismiss the loss of yet another business is just symptomatic of what has gone wrong with this community. <br /><br />I bet the new Gem Pawnshop does real well in Astoria. I&#039;m sure they did their homework and also see the writing on the wall that these same double-income yuppies are going to be needing them.

				They have lots of fillets and small whole fish. I cook for myself often. Their wild salmon is the best in the neighborhood, and I&#039;ve never gotten anything there that wasn&#039;t top quality. Often a whole snapper or mackerel is perfect just for me.&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />One of the reasons I moved to Astoria was the plethora of small businesses like Marino&#039;s. I want to keep the small town feel of Astoria, and it does still exist. The iconic restaurant Florent in the Meatpacking district is closing because of the landlord&#039;s new $50K a month rent: http://www.observer.com/term/34513 (http://www.observer.com/term/34513). That to me is the final nail in the coffin of that neighborhood, but Astoria is still alive and I am very proud to live here.

				Since discovering they sell Panko bread crums, I now buy from them instead of Trader Joe&#039;s. And essen, with 1 whole fish, you can still get a small one, and split it into a dinner and lunch. This is much cheaper than fillets. They will gut and clean the whole fish for you. Tonight I got a 1 lb Orato that came out to about 2&nbsp; 6oz fillets that were really tender. I guess the skin and bone just keeps it moist and flavorful, too. I&#039;m going to try to make it a mission to have some fish at least once a week from them. The 24 hour fruit markets, their business, and International was one of the reasons I really loved moving into the neighborhood. Hey, if enough people support them, then maybe they can recover some of their profit if their rent does go up. If you care about the places around you, it&#039;s not enough to just complain that they&#039;re going away because of your hours...you just make it work. I know if I want a better selection, I have to get there early on Saturday, that&#039;s how it works. Yes, to refrain pulledpork, that&#039;s exactly what they said about the economy, the neighborhood, etc...

Fish is not something you can buy on Saturday and eat on Wednesday. If we want to eat fish for dinner on any day but a Saturday, I simply cannot go to Marinos to purchase it. (And, you can be sure, on those occasions when I want to buy fish on a Saturday, I will go up to Marinos to get it, even though it&#039;s quite a long walk from where I live, as it&#039;s the best in the neighborhood.) <br /><br />I will go out of my way to purchase fish from top-quality locally-owned business, but they have to do me a favor too, and that&#039;s to have reasonable hours. Marinos does not have reasonable hours.<br /><br />Incidentally, I&#039;m very glad to hear that they&#039;re not actually going out of business! For those once-every-six-months occasions when we do cook fish on a Saturday, I&#039;ll be glad that they&#039;re still there.<br /><br />

There was no doubt that he was upset, not just about his business, but also other businesses in the neighborhood that have been here forever but are seeing their sales and profit margins under pressure.<br /><br />After that conversation, P.P. and I spoke about what this neighborhood would be like if businesses like Marinos closed down and how deeply troubling that prospect was to us. When I relayed all of this to edava, the information and emotions got all mixed up together, ergo the exaggeration in her post. Marino never said anything about closing down, I certainly did express my concern about a neighborhood without places like Marinos. :oops: :-P&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br />As P.P. said, the thing to do, if you care, is to make an effort to do business with places that you care about, and also to give them feedback about how they can serve you better.&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />

				I am all about supporting local businesses.&nbsp; My husband and I&nbsp; both love to cook, and the little mom &#039;n pop shops are the #1 thing we fell in love with when we first looked at Astoria.&nbsp; We get bread from a baker, fish from a fish market, fruit and veg from various stands, sausage from Joe&#039;s, etc.&nbsp; Even the supermarket we frequent is local/non-chain store.&nbsp; We do our best.&nbsp; <br /><br />But as much as I hate to say it, I agree with those who advocate later hours.&nbsp; I think most people work past 5:00 nowadays, if their lucky, and getting to a store near home by 6:00 is nearly impossible.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like anyone is calling for 24/7 service.&nbsp; 7pm is not unreasonably late to stay open, and, unfortunately, it&#039;s what the times we are living in call for.&nbsp; Maybe they could open an hour later, so they can stay open until 7pm...who needs fish before 11:00 am anyway?&nbsp; (Unless it&#039;s lox, of course. Mmmmm...lox.) <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I live off 30th Avenue and have patronized Marino&#039;s, but must agree doing business with them is difficult.&nbsp; &nbsp;They are a cut above the three other fish stores between 31st Street &amp; Marino&#039;s on 30th Avenue, but they aren&#039;t open Sunday (like their three competitors) and if they close at 6 on a weeknight no way I can get there after work.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The world has changed and I&#039;m afraid the Marino&#039;s, if they want to stay in business, should make some changes.&nbsp; The only day I could patronize that store would be Saturday.&nbsp; It is a shame because I would walk out of my way on the way -- passing three of Marino&#039;s competitors -- to buy fish from them.&nbsp; &nbsp;But if they are closed by 6 on week days and closed on Sunday, well...

				My second post to this thread.... I spoke with the 2 owners yesterday when I was picking up fish for my restaurant.... I made mention of this rumor going around on this site, when I did they both looked at me like I was crazy when I asked them if they were considering closing for any reason... they promptly replied that they have been in business for over so many years and that &quot;this is a family business and we have no intention of closing for any reason&quot; They are very nice guy and have given me and my businesses far better service and quality then any other fish monger on 30th avenue. I will agree that business hours are extremely important and that they should be open longer for all those who don&#039;t get home until later in the evening...
