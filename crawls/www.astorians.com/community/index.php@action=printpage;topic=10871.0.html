				I was in the same situation recently. My coworkers are mostly guys, and asking what&#039;s your wife&#039;s gynecologist seemed strange. The only woman that I work with was looking herself so I had to do some searching on my own. <br /><br />I choose someone in the city, close to work (Holly Nath – she is awesome), here is where I found her http://www.mdinfocentral.com/mdinfo/Redirector?DOCTOR_ID=6815&amp;target_doctorDetail=<br /><br />And here is a link for Queens http://www.mdinfocentral.com/mdinfo/Redirector?LAST_NAME=&amp;FIRST_NAME=&amp;SPECIALTY=49&amp;GENDER=NONE&amp;REGION=140&amp;LANGUAGE=-1&amp;BOARD_CERTIFIED=BOARD_CERTIFIED_NO&amp;SORT_BY=3&amp;SORT_ORDER_ASC=false&amp;PAGE_NUMBER=1&amp;target_doctorSearchResults=Search<br /><br />Good luck!

				I go to Allegra Cummings in Manhattan near Columbia. She&#039;s very nice, and I just saw her this last week. Unfortunately for us she is on maternity leave starting this week, so will be out until August. Great bed-side manner though...<br /><br />There is another thread (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=10254.0) discussing this which has some good ideas.

I even had surgery with her. BIG mistake -- and I have a massive scar to prove it. It was a total nightmare. If you want more info, feel free to PM me and I&#039;ll fill you in. She was, however, highly recommended by my PCP, who I trust implicitly.<br /><br />If you aren&#039;t looking for an Ob/Gyn, but someone who is just a gynecologist, I&#039;d highly recommend my current doctor -- Iris Orbuch. She&#039;s on Spring St. in Soho and shares her office space with a few other, non-gyn doctors (no pregnant ladies in the waiting area and since one of the doctors seems to deal with a lot of gay men, &quot;A Bear&#039;s Life&quot; (hairy gay man mag) is in the waiting room instead of &quot;Parents&quot;). She is awesome! <br /><br />

				I used to go to Dr. Melanie Marin on the east side. I really loved her but she&#039;s not on my insurance any more so I&#039;m heading to Downtown Women ObGyn next week. I&#039;ve heard great stuff about Dr. Buxbaum there and they have a number of doctors and NPs so you can get in quick for problems/issues outside of your annual.

				Looking for one myself.......that takes Vytra. Just called Dr. Kramer&#039;s office (sp?) and it turns out they don&#039;t take Vytra there.<br /><br />You might have better luck, she&#039;s in the Agora Plaza on 31st St. <br />(718) 545-0948.

				I hope you have better luck with Dr. Kremer then I did, and I really wanted to like her because her office is so convenient. <br />First off the front desk staff is unresponsive at best, and can get dismissive and downright rude.<br />I&#039;ve seen her twice and both times have had to wait over 30 minutes.<br />She may be fine for your yearly, but I have a real issue. She didn&#039;t take time to explain what was happening, just handed me a prescription, and shrugged her shoulders when I had a question. When I went for a follow up she hadn&#039;t even written down what she originally prescribed. Needless to say I now have a new doctor.

				I went to Dr. Sarabanchong (male) who is in the same office as Kremer.&nbsp; I was a little reluctant to go to a guy, but he was so nice and professional.&nbsp; I will definitely go back there again next time.

				I have a similar question, I don&#039;t have any sort of health insurance and I would like to see a gynecologist. When I lived in Philadelphia I decided to go to a professional and spend the extra cash. They said it would be $500, and I was working a retail job then so that was a lot of money. I went, they said they messed up my test or it came back as neutral or something. Then I received a bill from the lab they sent my test to, charging me another $500. I called them and tried to fight it, because the additional cost had not been mentioned when I grilled them over the phone about the cost. They said I could decide not to pay, but they would make sure that my credit was destroyed as a result. Then I went to a free clinic and I got tested and I never heard back from them. I called but got put on hold for close to an hour and gave up. Now I&#039;m having the problems I had before and I would like to see a gynecologist who has a reasonable rate. I freelance now and don&#039;t have a whole lot of money, but would like to be treated like a human being, and not get swindled. Does anyone know of a place, or if you&#039;ve been to a local PP or free clinic what doctor to recommend?

				All I can say is, whatever you do, DON&#039;T go to the MIC clinic on 14th and 30th(?).&nbsp; They treat everyone who comes in there as if they are a combination of stupid, uneducated, and sleeping with anything that moves.&nbsp; Office is dirty, most nurses are hostile, doctors dismissive of your needs, and when you get upset about your treatment there they ask if you want to see a social worker.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m a freelance type myself, with no insurance, which is why I tried going there, but it&#039;s so much more worth it to pay a non-clinic doctor the full fee and be treated with respect and dignity.

				Thanks Goldfish, it&#039;s important to know what clinics stink, as well as the god ones, I appreciate the heads up. It&#039;s really hard to find reviews on doctors online too. I&#039;ll know not to go there. Have you come across any reasonably priced gyn&#039;s?
