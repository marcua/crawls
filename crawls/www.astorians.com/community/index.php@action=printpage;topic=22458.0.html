				Seems like a good idea, I haven&#039;t played in probably 12 years, but if something was put together I&#039;d consider coming out of retirement.&nbsp;

Pretty sad&nbsp; since its a hockey rink , but our players didnt show up .&nbsp; They used to have league games there too&nbsp; , such a shame they dont anymore .&nbsp; If you guys play&nbsp; let me know and i can get a few guys .

				Looks like there are a number of guys up for playing. One guy suggested a rink by Whitestone. I don&#039;t have a car but it sounds like some other guys do. I&#039;m up for either place, although we might have to play at a weird hour by Dutch Kills as it tends to be busy. If you guys want to send me your email I&#039;ll get you in on the other conversation I&#039;m having over email.

				I&#039;m totally down. I play in an indoor league in Farmingdale, so I just have to see if I still have outdoor wheels. I saw that rink on google maps and was totally curious about it. Anyone know a goalie?

				Pretty sure the surface is concrete. One of the guys who contacted me said he has full goalie equipment but can&#039;t play goal because of his back.

				if you guys set something up and i&#039;m around, i&#039;ll play. i went down there a couple of times a few years ago when i first moved here just to skate and shoot around.<br /><br />the rink by Whitestone is...err, was good. again this info is 3-4 years old, but there was always a good crew of guys down at that rink for pickup games in the early evenings and on weekends. <br /><br />anyone playing ice hockey at City Ice in LIC this spring? i have some friends trying to put together a team. i&#039;m already playing on a team for Hockey Long Island, but considering playing at City Ice too, just because it&#039;s so freakin&#039; close and convenient.<br /><br />

				I would love to play ice hockey in LIC but I think it&#039;s expensive, no? <br /><br /><br />Well I found my other set of wheels, so sign me up. I&#039;d rather stay local but if the consensus is whitestone I&#039;d be down for that too.<br /><br /><br />Noahleigh I&#039;ll send you my email now.

				Hey guys,,, I&#039;m currently 43 and I Was born and raised in Astoria.&nbsp; I been reading ur thread on roller hockey and am puzzled as to why hockey is so dead in Astoria now. I currently live in long island but a little info for u guys. When I was growing up in astoria hockey was huge,, don&#039;t know if u guys know or heard of,, but I played for MPB (most precious blood) back in the day,, I started at the age of 4, and have not stopped playing since, all hoyt avenue park which u guys are talking about was referred to as the Cheesebox back in the day, simply due to it&#039;s triangular shape, I played so much hockey there growing up as a child.&nbsp; We must bring hockey back to Astoria the way it was,,,Guys Whitestone rink is horrible,, surface is destroyed best to play there with a ball,,, puck rolls like crazy,,, and ohhh yes thanos27 your not lying when there used to be line changes,, hockey was nuts in Astoria, bring it back boys,,, I&#039;m gonna come through on a Sunday sometime,,, hope to see u guys there

				Anthony im&nbsp; a couple of years younger than you but i also grew up in Astoria and always played at the cheesebox since i was small . I know everyone who played there&nbsp; and i also played for the Astoria Sharks (YMCA league team) .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Other than the cheesebox , we also played at hoyt ave&nbsp; under the train by neptune diner .&nbsp; We had so many great games and the people coming down there seemed like endless numbers . Then people got married , had kids and for some reason the younger generation never got into hockey the same way . Is it cuz the demographics changed so much &gt;&gt;?&nbsp; &nbsp;I know it was more Greek and Italian back then but still .....&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anthony where do you play now ?&nbsp; Where in LI do you live cuz i also played ice in Manhasset&nbsp; in IceLand for a while&nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp;Its tougher now with kids , but me and my friends are trying to get back into it .&nbsp;
