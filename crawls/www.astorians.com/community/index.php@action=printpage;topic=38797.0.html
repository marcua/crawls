				While I have mixed feelings about the concept and menu, I have been wanting to give this place a shot (especially because it&#039;s from the Bareburger people, and I like that place a lot). There&#039;s just nothing on the menu that my kids would be even remotely game for trying, which seems odd. <br /><br /><br />I had envisioned something like Hill Country Chicken in Manhattan maybe (another place I love), but perhaps this is a more &#039;upscale&#039; concept? Which, as a southerner, kinda cracks me up. Only in NYC!<br /><br /><br />Anyway, would love to hear more from others who&#039;ve been.&nbsp; :cheesy:

				We went and loved it.&nbsp; We had the roasted broccoli (a must have - amazing).&nbsp; The catfish was delicious.&nbsp; Not Cajun style.&nbsp; More meaty and flakey and a clean taste.&nbsp; The mushroom ragu is also very good and filling.&nbsp; I look forward to trying the ham in redeye gravy next time.&nbsp; We sat in the bar area.&nbsp; Super friendly staff and managers.&nbsp; Great cocktails, whiskey, bourbon, and beer selections.&nbsp; It definitely is a bit upscale but it&#039;s a sophisticated atmosphere without feeling over the top.&nbsp; I thought it was very relaxing.&nbsp; There were a few people with infants when we went but I don&#039;t see it being a great fit for kids who are a little older.&nbsp; It&#039;s more an adult menu and setting.&nbsp; I think they still want to capture the sidewalk cafe crowd, cocktails, and brunch.&nbsp; That said, I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s not family friendly (saying from their perspective, not the OP)

				That&#039;s good to hear, TJT! I was especially intrigued by the vegetables on the menu. Hope to get over there soon. To me (as someone who hasn&#039;t been inside to eat there yet), there&#039;s just a disconnect between the name/look of this place and the &#039;upscale&#039; adult/sophisticated menu thing they are going for. The name &quot;Burnside Biscuits&quot; makes me think of places like John Brown Smokehouse, Queens Comfort, etc -- perhaps something even more casual than those. Which&nbsp; definitely doesn&#039;t seem to be the case!<br /><br /><br />Astoria&#039;s got a lot of places like this -- some good/interesting things food-wise, but you can&#039;t quite figure out what they&#039;re going for with the signage/look/theme overall vibe, which seem &#039;off&#039; somehow and either over- or under-sells the whole offering. One that immediately comes to mind is Nature&#039;s Taste (I think that&#039;s what it&#039;s called?) on Ditmars, which I think has good food, but I can&#039;t figure out exactly what&#039;s up in there and never feel tempted to find out.

				Gothamist review said it was awful. <br /><br /><br />Yelp score isn&#039;t particularly outstanding.<br /><br /><br />Bareburger is one of the most overrated places I&#039;ve ever been to (two of the worst burgers I&#039;ve ever had in my life were at two different Bareburger locations), so I&#039;m not terribly surprised if Burnside is lackluster. Bareburger&#039;s organic claims seem to be what really make people orgasmic and what really catapulted their expansion, but I haven&#039;t really found the food to be that great.

				I like Gothamist but find their restaurant reviews are almost always off the mark.&nbsp; I do not care for Bare Burger either, I agree that it is overrated and falls way short of my expectations for burgers.<br /><br />That being said, we had a fantastic meal at Burnside Biscuits.&nbsp; The chicken was delicious - in fact, just two weeks removed from a highly disappointing meal at Root &amp; Bone in the East Village, I was hesitant to get back on the fried chicken wagon.&nbsp; Juicy, crispy and perfectly seasoned fried chicken, Burnside&#039;s chicken hit the spot last Friday night.&nbsp; The biscuits were great also - flaky, fresh and buttery.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed Burnside Biscuits.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=38797.msg253641.html#msg253641">Quote from: astorians35 on September 08, 2015, 11:04:01 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Gothamist review said it was awful. <br /><br /><br />Yelp score isn&#039;t particularly outstanding.<br /><br /><br />Bareburger is one of the most overrated places I&#039;ve ever been to (two of the worst burgers I&#039;ve ever had in my life were at two different Bareburger locations), so I&#039;m not terribly surprised if Burnside is lackluster.
