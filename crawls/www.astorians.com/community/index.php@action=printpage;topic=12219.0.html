				Former GOP senator calls Palin a &#039;cocky wacko&#039;<br /><br />PROVIDENCE, R.I. - Former Rhode Island Republican Sen. Lincoln Chafee has called vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin a &quot;cocky wacko&quot; and said her selection as John McCain&#039;s running mate has energized supporters of Democrat Barack Obama.<br /><br />http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26661483/ (http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26661483/)<br /><br />Perfect description!&nbsp; She sure clinched my vote for Obama! &nbsp;<br />

				Nope, I was seriously thinking of voting for McCain.&nbsp; It just seemed that Obama spent way too much time saying what he would do without saying how, and I think too many people across the country who support him think he can make automatic changes without further effort from them.&nbsp; But when I heard that McCain chose the governer of Alaska, the state with the smallest population to size ratio, I thought he was choosing someone who wouldn&#039;t understand the rest of our country.&nbsp; (Think, a heartbeat away from the presidency.)&nbsp; And when the next day the news came out about her daughter, I realized the McCain campaign was clueless about their choice.&nbsp; Then all the other wacky stuff came out!&nbsp; So, no, I really did switch my vote!&nbsp;

				I admit that I often feel despair that there&#039;s so much emphasis on everyone voting but so little emphasis on how to inform yourself and think critically about the issues. <br /><br />However, I am not sure that property ownership is an indication of business acumen. It could also be an indication of wealthy ancestors. I know plenty of people who own their own homes - who worked hard and are good with whatever they do - but don&#039;t think critically about their voting decisions. <br /><br />In fact, very few people do, I think. Most people vote along party lines, or along hot-button issues. I don&#039;t know what would change that.

				And the thing about having the vote is that everyone has the right to try to get someone into office who will have a positive impact on their lives. If only the literate population can vote, who will think about the rights and needs of the illiterate population? <br /><br />I&#039;d lean more towards responsible reporting. And maybe approaching some of the big issues that we are pretty much permanently split on differently. <br /><br />Let&#039;s say we as a country are split over whether M&amp;M candies should be blue or red. One politicians says &quot;Clearly they should be blue!&quot; the other one says &quot;Red!&quot; What would be real leadership? I think it would be to look at where we all are, as one big group, not two groups, look at the research, talk to a lot of people, and eventually bring everyone to the same page to say &quot;maybe some M&amp;Ms could be blue and some could be red.&quot; <br /><br />Most of us have an intense emotional investment in our political identity. I&#039;m a Democrat, this is how Dems think, it&#039;s how I think. I wish instead we could approach each problem individually and try to think what would be the best solution for each problem, that would be in line with US values across the board, as much as possible. <br /><br />Call me crazy.

				I&#039;d agree with the both of y&#039;all.&nbsp; The way it is presently set up, its mostly political cheerleading, rather than folks getting into the meat of the issues.&nbsp; But, since I am a paranoid conspiracy theorist, its all just a construct designed by the establishment to maintain themselves in power let the common folk squabble over the trifles. :roll:<br /><br />Just as a side note, from my understanding of the subject, the state did not limit the franchaise to property owners.&nbsp; Rather, the state was a collection of property owners and having property gave one the right to participate (a publically traded corporation is a fair modern analogy).&nbsp; The owning of land historically meant the ability to serve in the military, which was the basis for the establishment and maintence of the political units.&nbsp; As political units moved away from defining its wealth strictly though land, the franchaise opened up to varying degrees of wealth, not because of any presumption of business acumen or intelligence, but rather that the wealth makes one a part of the state. As anything else, the political realities did not always keep pace with the socio-economic realities, especially as class divisions became entrenched and ossified.<br /><br />I&#039;m reading a pretty good book now which is at home, but it talks specifically about Madison&#039;s worry about the &quot;tyranny of the masses&quot; and that the constitution was specifically a measure to stop what was becoming runaway democracy.&nbsp; Its such an interesting topic.

I have a hard time believing that a bunch of plutocratic land-owning white men were as egalitarian as some people seem to think.

				The uglier it gets for people who live in blue states. But then again, McCain is not trying to get your vote or mine. <br /><br />Trust me, the vast majority of the United States population does not think like or believe the same things that you and I do. <br /><br />Also, the Republican Party is hands down the strongest political machine that has ever been built.

Wow, Krugman has done it again, two things that may be taken wrong is a &#039;blizzard&nbsp; of lies?&#039; I guess &#039;Blizzard&#039; is a metaphor for&nbsp; Alaska, how clever. :lol:&nbsp; Actually, Krugman should know about lies, since he and the newspaper&nbsp; he writes&nbsp; for has been printing his lies for years. Obama may have been &#039;innocently&#039;&nbsp; making fun of dead &#039;Old&#039;&nbsp; fish and &#039;lipstick&#039; Pigs, but, it seems&nbsp; like the supporters&nbsp; knew&nbsp; what he was talking about, even if he didn&#039;t see it. I believe&nbsp; Obama, he is&nbsp; an empty suit, he&nbsp; may have not realised&nbsp; what he was saying. Palin did abandon plans to build the nearly $400 million bridge from Ketchikan to an island with 50 residents and an airport. But she made her decision after the project had become an embarrassment to the state, after federal dollars for the project were pulled back and diverted to other uses in Alaska, and after she had appeared to support the bridge during her campaign for governor. So, she is not lieing about finally being against it. At worst she changed&nbsp; her mind. Of course, all&nbsp; this doesn&#039;t matter&nbsp; to the Left-wing media&nbsp; monster in NY and LA. She declared&nbsp; war on them at the Convention, when she said she wouldn&#039;t cater&nbsp; to them. The &#039;nerve&#039; of that woman.&nbsp; :mrgreen:&nbsp; When McCain/Palin are elected&nbsp; in November will Krugman, Hollywood and the Upper West Side hipsters&nbsp; finally leave for Havana? One can only hope. See, Obama is&nbsp; keeping hope alive?&nbsp; :wink:<br />

				Does anyone else get the impression that people&#039;s expectations for Sarah Palin are so low that as long as she manages to form sentences she&#039;ll still have wide support? In her Charles Gibson interview, her answers swayed between being purposely vague and overly rehearsed, or simply non-answers, like they told her to just focus on a few key ideas and keep your composure and people won&#039;t notice you&#039;re not actually saying anything. I feel like if anyone else even trying to run for President or VP answered questions the way she did, they would&#039;ve been laughed off the scene.<br /><br />And no, I don&#039;t fault her for not knowing what the Bush Doctrine is, but it was clear in her answers to that question that she is very skilled at debating and public speaking, but doesn&#039;t have the knowledge on a national level to appear as more than an empty shell. But the consensus seems to be that she did well, since she didn&#039;t &quot;crash and burn.&quot; She&#039;s also a very good speech giver, but people don&#039;t seem to think the of the fact that she didn&#039;t write that convention speech. She delivered it well, but it&#039;s more important to me what these people say outside of speeches and what their plans actually are than how well they can read a rehearsed speech. And in regards to her &quot;finally being against the bridge,&quot; if Obama had done that and acted like he was never in favor of it, of course it would be deemed a flip-flop and he would be run into the ground like John Kerry was. Apparently, lack of experience is bad unless it&#039;s Sarah Palin, being a celebrity-like political figure is bad unless it&#039;s Sarah Palin, and flip-flopping is bad unless it&#039;s Sarah Palin. And right, Sarah, just keep telling everyone that being able to see Russian land from one of Alaska&#039;s islands makes you experienced in foreign policy. Maybe enough people are stupid enough to believe it. And regarding the &quot;Obama is a Muslim&quot; story, it&#039;s not being spread by any credible new sources, but people are working behind the scenes (whether on an official level or not, who knows) to make sure the story doesn&#039;t go away and to try to scare people who would be scared of that sort of thing.<br /><br />Palin does remind me a lot of Bush - overconfident and uninformed. Not a good combination.

				This Sarah persona quickly becoming a female version of George W Bush. The Media has the lowered the bar to the point where if she doesn&#039;t make a total disaster of herself, she is then considered acceptable. Why do we keep lowering the bar of what acceptable for a Republican candidate, yet we keep raising it for Democratic candidates? This Republican presidential ticket has nothing real to offer, so their agenda is smear, fear, and lies. <br />
