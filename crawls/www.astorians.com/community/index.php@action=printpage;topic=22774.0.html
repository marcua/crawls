				They have no point. They need to be protesting in Washington to have proper regulations in place and the guilty parties charged. Protesting corporations for being &quot;greedy&quot; is like protesting a dog to stop barking. It&#039;s what they do. Occupy is no more than a mouthpiece for the radical, communist-loving, America-hating left fringe of the D party.

				The picnic was lovely. Astoria Park is such a great public resource. I was happy to spend time there on a beautiful day with some very civic-minded and interesting people.

				How did it go? We had a picnic, and it was like... a picnic. As advertised. <br /><br />We did it to have a good time with each other and meet new people, because that&#039;s a good thing. About sixty people came, half from our group and half people I didn&#039;t know before. A merry time was had by all. One fellow had an allergic reaction from pollen, but luckily he got better. Thanks for asking!<br /><br />So much nastiness, people. Where does it come from? You don&#039;t want to come to our picnic, that&#039;s fine. But why the need to bad-mouth people you haven&#039;t even met? We are not the monsters that a couple of you seem to fantasize. Since we were not demonstrating on this day, you might have wandered in by mistake and not even known that we are these horrible Occupy people until you were already having a good time. <br /><br />Our group is almost entirely people from and for Astoria. We are in solidarity with what Occupy Wall Street accomplished, which was to change the national discussion and bring the issue of economic inequality to the fore. But we are local people, we have local as well as global concerns. We are your neighbors, you may know us and not realize it. We&#039;re professionals and workers and also unemployed, and not ashamed of it. <br /><br />We don&#039;t have all the answers, but we know that when power is so concentrated and politics is so corrupt, people need to come together and fight it, and find alternative ways. We know there will be false starts and mistakes. We know this is a process of many years. Do you really think the present system is sustainable? Why shouldn&#039;t we be having an open discussion, in our neighborhood, and in our nation, about different ways of economics and politics?<br /><br />TJT, it would be too bad if people only followed your advice: &quot;Just read about it in the paper.&quot; You don&#039;t really trust the paper, do you? You might have discovered something else if you put it down and came out to our picnic. You do, however, make it sound like you&#039;d like to &quot;impact&quot; the 1%. If so, maybe you should bring some ideas to the table. Maybe people will see they&#039;re doing it wrong. Seriously. <br /><br />Eamonn, do you really believe there exists such a thing as &quot;the radical, communist-loving, America-hating left fringe of the D party&quot;? Seriously? While we all have busy days, I hope you get a chance to spend some time in the sun, perhaps at a picnic this weekend. It can really help. <br /><br />odenhal, at least you don&#039;t seem to be taking anything too seriously. Good for you. <br /><br />braun, you write: &quot;they closed off an entrance to the J train on Broad Street because of these OWS idiots.&quot; Just to be clear, who were &quot;they&quot; who closed off this entrance?<br /><br />Be well, folks.
