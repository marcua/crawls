			I'm selling a gorgeous dining set, due to a move... <br /><br />It's a glass table w/ a black and white marble base and 4 black leather seats <br />You can always buy nice colored seat covers...but not necessary. As you see, in the pics...it looks beautiful without! <br />It's in good conditon!!<br /><br />The set is only 4 yrs. old, very modern, very sturdy, heavy due to the glass and marble base, and will blend in with any setting! <br /><br />Pictures are availabe!! Email me, if intrested...I'll send them to you!<br />&nbsp;<br />Located at 36-11 23rd Ave<br />(right next door to St. Irene's Church)<br /><br />Come and see it. We'll talk! I must be rid of it by November 5th [/b[/img]
