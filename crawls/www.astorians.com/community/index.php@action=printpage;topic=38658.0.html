				This place has been under construction for a while now.&nbsp; They still have the brown paper on the windows.&nbsp; When I look inside it looks like it&#039;s almost ready to open.&nbsp; I&#039;m wondering why it&#039;s taking so long to open.&nbsp; I hope that this won&#039;t turn out to be like Razzie&#039;s taking over a year to open and then going out of business in less than 4 months.

				Saw the lights turned on in there for the first time in months.<br /><br /><br />The place looks finished but it remains dormant.

				I am absolutely not any sort of restaurant expert, just a consumer, but when I see the register and the bagels, I head right for them.&nbsp; To stop and order half way back toward the door is odd.&nbsp; Where you order, you can&#039;t see the bagels, so how do you know what the options are?<br /><br />But that&#039;s just me and my weirdness.&nbsp; <br /><br />Again, lovely people and the 3 bagels I&#039;ve had there have all been tasty.

				I went here for the first time last Friday.&nbsp; Very nice experience.&nbsp; The order location may be changed because the bagels, cashier, etc was all to the back of the shop.&nbsp; The entire middle area is not yet in use.&nbsp; I think there will eventually be a grill and hot food.&nbsp; They had the most amazing looking homemade crumb cake.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t buy it but it looked so good.&nbsp; One variety had a raspberry jam incorporated under the thick layer of crumbs.&nbsp; My whole grain bagel with lox spread was delicious.&nbsp; Great lox spread (not phony smoke flavor but the real thing).&nbsp; The bagel was also truly whole grain, with a lot of visible flecks of bran throughout.&nbsp; Very nice people.&nbsp; Fun, pleasant, and very interested in how I liked everything.&nbsp; Great iced coffee too.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be back.&nbsp; They have limited seating so this is not a place for someone looking to sit for hours with a laptop.&nbsp; To me, that&#039;s a good thing.

				Greetings ~<br /><br /><br />Been there twice - early w/end afternoon and, on my way catch the train before 7:30 a.m.during the weekday.&nbsp; Yes they are pleasant but they need to pick up speed, it wasn&#039;t even crowded both times.&nbsp; &nbsp;Bagel/spread/coffee ~ no complaints here.<br /><br /><br />Personally, I am glad there&#039;s no wifi, otherwise the limited seating would be .. forgetaboutit&nbsp; :tongue:&nbsp; &nbsp;hope it&#039;s kept that way.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />C&#039;iao for now.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-family: comic sans ms;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: x-small;" class="bbc_size">Remember, be kind to our Planet Earth and all its habitats and creatures</span></span>

				This place closed down this week. Very sad to see, but not unsurprising.&nbsp; They had extremely long delays in opening up, had no real place for people to sit, and too much wasted counter space. Also they never advertised, or had a &#039;grand opening&#039; to get people aware that they were open in the first place.

Not as good as Astoria Bagels on 23rd Ave.

				I meant to say they weren&#039;t as good as Astoria Bagels on Ditmars which has been here for as long as I&#039;ve been living here and that&#039;s 23 years.&nbsp; Ditmars Bagels just couldn&#039;t compare

				I was there last Wednesday.&nbsp; I did like their bagels and french vanilla coffee, the best!&nbsp; I always found the service to be slow.&nbsp; I did not care for the seating and lack of ... sad to see it go.&nbsp; I was&nbsp; :shocked:&nbsp; to see it closed 3 days later. <br /><br /><br />Never tried the bagels down Ditmars (28th Str?), but have tried many times the Bagel House on 38th, bagels not bad.&nbsp; Seating is good, but no wifi.<br /><br /><br />(Oh well perhaps the leasing price went up?)&nbsp; C&#039;iao for now ~<br /><br />

				It&#039;s a shame.&nbsp; I liked these bagels, and every time i went in, the staff was friendly.&nbsp; &nbsp;Business is tough enough, but these guys never seems to recover from the delays in opening.
