				It&#039;s a sit-down kind of place, there&#039;s not much standing room. So I think people can eat or drink or both, as they like, and we can all have our own tabs. I&#039;ll discuss that with Rest-Au-Rant and make sure it&#039;s ok with them. <br /><br />Preliminary count: <br />1. newastorian35 <br />2. Astoria Luv? <br />3. Handyman<br />4. EddieStjohns <br />5. Alison<br />6. odenhal<br />7. MFells<br />8. SpecialK<br />9. PJ<br />10. goldfishboy<br />11. Mer<br /><br />For those who haven&#039;t been to an Astorians event before, i&#039;ll try to remember to post the color of my shirt or wear a goofy hat so you can recognize me easily. As has been said - there are people of all ages and stages of life - so if you think you are older or younger than the median, please don&#039;t let that hold you back. Some of the most interesting people I&#039;ve met on astorians are at least a decade older than me, and once you get to know each other it doesn&#039;t seem to matter at all. <br /><br />I&#039;m really excited about meeting/seeing you all :)

				I will create a table sign (thanks, NYCMacUser). It&#039;s a small place, it&#039;s not like you are going to be shoving through a crowd looking for the elusive astorians table :)&nbsp; <br /><br />Per a pm I received - I want to clarify that this isn&#039;t a singles mixer. Everyone is welcome - single, non-single, single-but-just-not-looking. :)&nbsp; That said, if you happen to meet someone and think they are cute/charming/dateable, that&#039;s cool too. <br /><br />In general, I&#039;m hoping for a friendly, laid-back, relaxed, no-pressure event. <br /><br /><br />ETA: newastorian, I expect to get there right around 7.00. In my experience, people start arriving around the official start time and keep arriving for another hour or more.

				Congrats, firelight :)&nbsp; I just read an article on bridezillas at salon that made me very tempted to elope. That is, if marriage ever becomes an immediate issue. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />OK ... I dropped by Rest-Au-Rant tonight and they are now aware of our plan to invade their space at around 7.00 Thursday. They&#039;ll reserve a few tables for us and we can all run our own tabs.&nbsp; :mrgreen: I will bring signage. If all else fails, look for the average-height woman with short brown hair and glasses.

				The only Astorians gathering I&#039;ve attended is MacUser&#039;s <em>Last Posting Wins</em> party.<br /><br />I will try my best to get there as early as I can. I won&#039;t be getting out of work until 8 ish so I won&#039;t be there at 7.<br /><br />Perhaps in honor of BigBryan&#039;s history of attending these events ... Hawaiian shirts???<br /><br />His sister Judy told me that she asked their Mom if perhaps he should be laid out in one of his favorite Hawaiian shirts instead of the suit.<br /><br />Kinda made sense to me.<br /><br />Anyway, looking forward to seeing you all ... around 8:30 ???

				I&#039;m glad I finally made one. It pays to read the rest of the postings on this website.<br /><br />BTW ... Newell the Jewel said he will be posting a poll about how you think you <em>should </em>pronounce my web-handle name.<br /><br />I actually like the way most people said the way they <em>thought</em> I meant it ... you gotta come out and meet the peeps from Astorians now and then ... put a face to the avatar. ( Although my face <em>is</em> my avatar .. which may not be such a bright idea ... )<br /><br />BTW ... BTW ... pay attention to the weather forecasts before you leave home in the morning ... they laughed at me for bringing an umbrella ......... Ha! :-D<br /><br />{ Also, on the side ... Judy - BigBryan&#039;s sister- was in residence, with her husband. It was really great seeing her again. I asked her directly to join the Astorian&#039;s community.&nbsp; I hope she does, }

				I came, I saw, I conquered. Well, my hat did most of the work. Pleasure meeting all of you who came.<br /><br />I&#039;m mad I didn&#039;t meet Handyman. I was hoping to talk about Whedonism and whether there was a spot on his team for me this Sunday... And I was hoping to see Casicua who I&#039;ve only met once but he would have at least been a friendly face. <br /><br />*big sigh*<br /><br />I did meet some great people. I&#039;m glad. And the night ended well. Well, pretty well. _I_ had fun dancing in the rain anyway. Cheers.

				Thank you, enigmacat, for organizing last night&#039;s get-together.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t stay very long but I had a very good time. Sorry not saying goodbye to everyone, but I didn&#039;t want to interrupt their conversations.&nbsp; <br /><br />Yeah, I&#039;m kind of glad that I left before the rain. I walked home to 48th Street and Broadway and missed the showers.<br /><br />By the way, it was great seeing Newell again and meeting Judy and her husband (I&#039;m sorry I forgot his name). I hope Newell posts regularly and that Judy and husband join the community!&nbsp;

				Yes, thanks again enigmacat, it was fun and Rest-au-rant (I can&#039;t be bothered to put in the little whatever-they&#039;re-called thingies like Newell) is a great spot. :) I met a whole boatload of new people, too. Well, maybe a small boat&#039;s worth. Yay for new peeps! Sorry if I confused you guys by showing up incognito (sans specs)&nbsp; 8-)<br /><br />Oh, and I missed the downpour because I was sitting on the N! They were sooo backed up last night - trains were coming one after another. I walked up to the platform at 36 av as one was pulling out, 45 seconds later, the one I got on pulled in, and I saw another down the tracks at 39th Ave. Took a good 30 minutes to get from 36 Av. to Ditmars. But...I missed the super heavy rain that way, so I guess it&#039;s not THAT bad of a deal!

I was all happy to catch the train as soon as I walked up to the 36th Ave stop, but then it got to Broadway and sat there indefinitely. I was tempted to walk to Ditmars, but not that tempted. The train did eventually get to Astoria Blvd, but the announcer had said there were still 3 trains ahead of us, so I got out and walked and ended up beating the train. Then about 2 minutes after I got in it started pouring. I was happy with my decision. <br /><br />Anyway, I really enjoyed the mixer and meeting the folks. Thanks enigmacat for organizing it!
