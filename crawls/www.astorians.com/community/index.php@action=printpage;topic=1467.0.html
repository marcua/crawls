				I use Hoyt and Acropolis, mostly to go to the airport.&nbsp; They both charge $30 to go to JFK, and Acropolis&#39; cars are nicer.<br /><br />Acropolis is listed under another name, and I&#39;m not at home so I don&#39;t have the card.&nbsp; I&#39;ll try to post it later.

				I have a car, so I don&#39;t use car services frequently. <br /><br />But, when friends visit I send them home using Olympic. 718-626-8000. <br />They have been around for at least 20-25 years. Always clean cars, English-speaking <br />drivers who are very curteous and know their way around, and they give receipts <br />without a problem.<br /><br />Also, they are on time when they make a morning appointment for an airport run. <br />The car is waiting for you 5-10 minutes in advance of the booking and they don&#39;t <br />charge extra for it.<br /><br />In the past 5 years, I don&#39;t even bother calling anyone else.<br /><br />Oh! Yes. One other thing. If you tell them you are transporting a pet, they send <br />a pet-friendly driver.<br /><br />Lorrie

				I use Hyot as well, they seem to be EXTREMLY punctual for those early morning runs to the airport, but when i fly out sunday nights they can be late. Usually no more then 5 minutes but i have had to wait up to 10 minutes. <br /><br />I am an extremely punctual person so this does make a difference to me.

				I second the recommendation for Hoyt.<br /><br />I was using Deborah for a while, but after the third or fourth f*ck up (40 minutes late, no shows, and this doozy: they &quot;already picked me up&quot;), they&#39;re dead to me now.

				My favorite... New Experience&nbsp; 718-729-0000<br /><br />Mostly Spanish speaking.&nbsp; I don&#39;t speak it but I never had any trouble getting a car anytime, whether in advance reservation or the last minute request.&nbsp; Also the rate seems pretty reasonable.&nbsp; Once I got stranded in Williamsberg, Brooklyn on Saturday late night and no Brooklyn based car service could come pick me up because they had no car, these guys came for me.&nbsp; I do like these guys.

				One related question:&nbsp; do people use car services late at night because of the perceived level of danger or because the subways just don&#39;t run that often at that time?&nbsp; The concept of using a car service is still somewhat new to me.

Like if I&#39;m especially drunk or sleepy and just want to get home already.&nbsp; :-D<br /><br />I know I should feel like my safety&#39;s at risk, and I am aware of that, but usually if I&#39;m waiting for a train late at night, so are a ton of other people. I&#39;ve been on a train at two or three in the morning going to Astoria and there are no seats available! This is always on the weekend though - I&#39;d never do it on a Tuesday.

				It depends on the time of night and where I am.&nbsp; If I&#39;m in Manhattan, I&#39;ll usually subway -- but if I&#39;m in Brooklyn, I&#39;ll car.&nbsp; It saves a LOT of time (like an hour or more after 1 am) and it just feels safer.&nbsp; The subway isn&#39;t as populated outer borough to outer borough.&nbsp; It&#39;s usually return trip car service for me.<br /><br />Northside in Brooklyn (Williamsburg) is my favorite of the Brooklyn based.<br /><br />I&#39;ll also use car service to get longer distances -- or to the airport.<br />
