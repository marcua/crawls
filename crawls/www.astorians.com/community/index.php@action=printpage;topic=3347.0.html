				(I think the timing of this event is unfortunate, so hopefully voting is the first priority.<br />The topic is very provocative. While the chances of living up to the needs of the discussion are small, sometimes these debates have been surprisingly wonderful. If only better choices of presenters.)<br /><br />thesmithfamilyfoundation.org<br />The Donald &amp; Paula Smith Family Foundation <br /><br />Present a Discussion <br /><br />Responding to Anti-Americanism in the Arab World: <br />Have We Been Effective Since 9/11? <br /><br />Featuring<br />David Frum <br />American Enterprise Institute<br />Author: An End to Evil <br />-And-<br />The Right Man <br /><br />Craig Charney <br />President, Charney Research<br />Award winning Pollster of Arab Attitudes <br /><br />Leon T. Hadar <br />Cato Institute<br />Author: Sandstorm: Policy Failure in the Middle East<br /><br /><br />Over the five years since 9/11, American foreign policy, security policy, and psychology have been reshaped to address Arab anger and the terrorism that can result from it. On 9/11 what most of the world saw as a horrific act of brutality, many in the Arab streets saw as a success. While currently the Iraq war overshadows all, the Administration has also aggressively sought to engage the Arab world and convince it that America is not the enemy it assumes. Have these efforts been successful? Are they hopelessly overshadowed by the Iraq War and our Israeli alliance? Does trying to understand and react to the motivation of the Jihadists amount to appeasement? Should we simply be grateful that -- despite several well publicized attempts -- there has not been a major terrorist attack on American soil in the five years since 9/11?<br /><br />Tuesday, September 12, 2006<br />6:30 P.M. Prompt<br />(Free and open to the public - Reception to follow) <br /><br /><br />The Graduate Center <br />The City University of New York <br />365 Fifth Avenue, New York <br />(Corner of 34th Street &amp; 5th Avenue) <br /><br /><br />Aaron Russell <br />arussell@thesmithfamilyfoundation.org<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Mission of the Donald &amp; Paula Smith Family Foundation </strong> <br />The Foundation defends free speech and a free society through the critical examination of ideas, sponsoring debates and related activities in the New York area. In a world where philosophical arguments all too often take the form of partisan rancor and anti-intellectual appeals, the Foundation hopes to serve as a reminder that we are united by a deeper loyalty: to skeptical analysis, reason, and truth-seeking. The Foundation aims to foster informed debates that are both vigorous and civil, on topics ranging from economics to ethics, from politics to art, and beyond. Some debates will yield clear answers and some debates can never be settled, but the argumentative process itself can serve as a model of rational discourse in an often divided society.<br />
