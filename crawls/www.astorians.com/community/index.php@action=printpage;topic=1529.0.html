				SO this morning as I was battling my damn inverted umbrella and its acquiescence to the blustery rain, I came to my usual stop (R/V/G) at Steinway and found that the whole street was shut down by cops... like half a dozen police cars with flashing lights and a desolate street. I asked a nearby flatfoot, who could barely be bothered to talk to me, and he said &quot;its an accident&quot;. Um yeah. No traffic or wrecked cars or ambulances or emergency personnel anywhere. Just a shut-down Steinway, probably all the way down to 34th ave. Anyone know what the boys in blue are up to?<br /><br />

				I saw the street closures this morning too. I also noticed the scaffolding near the subway entrance was all bent up.<br /><br />From: http://www.wnbc.com/traffic/6702843/detail.html<br /><br />Man Struck By Hit-And-Run Driver<br />UPDATED: 9:43 am EST February 3, 2006<br /><br /><br />NEW YORK -- Police are trying to track down a sport utility vehicle involved in a hit-and-run accident Friday morning in Queens.

				wow. thanks for the explanation! here I thought it was just another bus-driver-in-training gone amok from the Ferrari Driving School that&#39;s right there...<br />yeah, I wouldn&#39;t descibe the situation as much of an &quot;accident&quot; if the dude tried to hit the pedestrian twice.

				There was also a mangled bicycle on the ground. I couldn&#39;t figure out whether it was from the accident or just an abandoned bike on the street.<br /><br />I did witness something interesting. The road was clearly blocked by a police van in the middle of the intersection at approximately 8:30am. Someone found it necessary to turn right from Broadway, squeezing between the police van and the newsstand in front of Rite Aid. The cops were all staring at this driver in disbelief. As I approached the car while heading to subway, I could hear them yelling at the driver &quot;Didn&#39;t you see the barracades?!?&quot; Drivers in Queens never cease to amaze me.&nbsp; &nbsp;:?

				A bit of background:<br />I grew up in the Ravenswood projects. In the late 80s to early 90s, it was not a terribly unusual occurrence for there to be gunshots. I called the police many times on these occasions. Sometimes it seemed they responded, other times it seemed like my report was ignored.<br />To make a long story short, I started reading up on police radio communications. From what I learned through various sources, I figured it&#39;d be a good idea to get myself a radio scanner so I could monitor police activity in my area. I got one and installed an antenna on the roof of my building. It not only made interesting listening to hear live accounts of police calls in the 114th Precinct, I was able to track any complaints of gunshots I made to see if they were being resopnded to or not.<br /><br />I have since moved out of Ravenswood into my own house in the Dutch Kills area. Even though my general surroundings are now nothing at all as perilous as the projects were, I still have my scanner set up so I can listen to police calls any time I feel like it.<br />It&#39;s always damn interesting stuff to listen to. <br />And if you&#39;d have only had a radio scanner, you&#39;d have just had to tune in to the 114th precinct to know firsthand what was going on at Steinway and Broadway. <br />Just saying.

				Minor update: I&#39;ve been noticing a lot more police presence at that intersection lately, and foot patrols up and down Broadway. I wonder what&#39;s been cooking around there...
