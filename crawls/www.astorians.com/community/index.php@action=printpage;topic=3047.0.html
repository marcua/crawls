				As y&#39;all know, I&#39;m a nerd. (Taco stats coming soon, I promise...!) <br /><br />So I was reading this paper by Nobel Prize winning Psychologist Daniel Kahneman today, and it reminded me of Zip!&#39;s movie selection. Let me quote/paraphrase Kahneman&#39;s summary of other people&#39;s research:<br /><br />In a 2002 study by John List, traders of sportscards assigned significantly higher value to a set of ten cards labeled &quot;Mint/near mint condition&quot; than to a set that included the <strong>same</strong> ten cards plus three additional cards described as &quot;poor condition&quot;. This violates the &quot;monotonicity&quot; of utility, and is rather surprising. In a series of follow-up experiments, Jonathan Alevy and colleagues also confirmed an important difference between the prices that people will pay when they see only one of the sets of items (&quot;separate evaluation&quot;) or when they price both sets of items at the same time (&quot;joint evaluation&quot;). The sets of items were similar to the sports cards used by List. The same pattern of violations of dominance was observed in the separate evaluation condition, especially for relatively inexperiences card traders. These individuals bid an average of $4.05 for the smaller set of cards, and only $1.82 for the larger set (which included the smaller set, plus some cards in poor condition). When participants saw both the smaller set and the larger set at the same time, and then had to bid on both, they were more rational, bidding $2.89 and $3.32 for the smaller and larger sets, respectively.<br /><br />The first part of this is most relevant to Zip!, as it says that people often bid on something like the average of the (subjective/emotional) utility of a set of items. Some of Zip!&#39;s titles, like Fellowship of the Ring, Traffic, Malcom X, and Before Sunrise, give me positive emotional responses, and make we want to give him $20. But then I see A&amp;E: Mysteries of the Bible and What Dreams May Come, and I want to :killme: and I no longer feel that the value of Zip!&#39;s package of DVDs is worth the plastic it&#39;s made out of. <br /><br />Take-home message: Cull the crap out of your collection and you&#39;ll be able to sell everything. Throw the crap in the trash.<br />

				We need more money for the libraries to have extended hours and be open on weekends.&nbsp; The Mayor cuts the budget every year and the City Council restores the money, but they can never get enough to get service to where it needs to be, let alone to open new branches.&nbsp; It&#39;s a sad situation.
