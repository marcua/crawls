				<br /><br />I would love to hear some unexpected gems. Saving a better for last.<br /><br />Recently heard with interest about 2 films to consider eventually.<br />The next James Bond has surprising choices for director and writer.<br /><br />I think there could be a superb Russell Crowe film. <span class="bbc_u">The Next 3 Days</span>, a remake of a French flick.<br /><br />If they havent before, it would be great if MOMI showed Crowe&#039;s films.<br /><br /><br /><br />Recently caught the doc It Might Get Loud. I wish it would have been much more. In filming about electric guitars, they meet and talk with <br />The Edge, Jack White, and Jimmy Page. I was surprised how little I wanted to hear from the Edge despite being a U2 fan. His contributions could have been cut to almost 5 minutes. Not a fan, but Jack White was incredibly interesting and actually plays piano quite a bit. It might not have been as dynamic but I could have enjoyed more a film just on Page.&nbsp; &nbsp;:rock:<br />The DVD has some deleted scenes where we get to see/hear more of their playing.<br /><br />Page still has a theremin.<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1i7Lg7q6cc<br /><br /><br />surprising factoid<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diddley_bow<br /><br /><br /><br />A film that surprised me. http://www.spike.com/video/losing-my-religion/2478571<br />If you ever liked the REM video, you might want to check out<br /><br />The Fall<br />I knew the imagery would be striking. I did not know it would have a moving storyline and some unusual, fine performances.<br /><br /><br />http://www.thefallthemovie.com/<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In a hospital on the outskirts of 1920s Los Angeles, an injured stuntman begins to tell a fellow patient, a little girl with a broken arm, a fantastical story about 5 mythical heroes.

				<br />It has been sometime, and hope a film gets done called<br />Take This Waltz<br /><br /><br />I would love to find some good comedies. In a very different vein, I finally got around and could accept seeing<br /><br />&nbsp;:cry:&nbsp; &nbsp;:-*<br /><br /><br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Away From Her</span><br /><br />http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0491747/<br /><br /><br /><br />I wondered about the title, and now it makes me smile.<br /><br />&quot;Throughout the film, Grant&#039;s reflections on his marriage are woven ... , and influence his eventual decisions regarding Fiona&#039;s happiness.&quot;<br />Curious now about the short story that it is based on. I wonder if it was difficult adapting a short to a feature length. The first half works far better to me, and towards the end it seems a bit more forced and abrupt. It was filmed in rural snowscape country of Canada and has a leisurely melancholy and perhaps serene&nbsp; pace. It is far better than what I usually see, a poetic film.<br /><br />I also thought of living cases of Alzheimers that agree with some story events.<br /><br />I had worried that a film involving Alzheimers would just be too depressing. But there is so much <span class="bbc_u">excellence and love </span> in the talent and story, that it was satisfying.<br /><br /><br />A feature directorial debut. Saw if she had been nominated, but it was a very deep slate of nominees, leaving nominations for writing and best actress.<br />Great lead and supporting performances. Includes among others Olympia Dukakis, Gordon Pinsent, and Julie Christie.<br /><br /><br /><br />http://www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_what_is_alzheimers.asp<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">As many as 5.3 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />

				I hope there will be a great entertaining blockbuster this summer. And actually, SATC2 is a decent excuse for a few hours with popcorn.<br />Surprised but not thrilled by a couple of DVDs.<br /><br />Both seem like student films.

				<br />Surprised by Woody Allen&#039;s favorites among his films.<br /><br />Any good films coming out soon?

				my apologies. I am gonna geek hard on this until ImageXmas comes in 2011.<br /><br />http://www.indiewire.com/article/museum_of_the_moving_image/<br /><br />I first heard about Astoria from thousands of miles away when learning about the history of filmmaking in America. Never expected to actually live here.<br />Seriously, to me, the museum is a local, national, and international destination point.

				<br />I take it tonight will be a rainout. Which would be unfortunate.<br /><br />http://www.socratessculpturepark.org/programs/outdoorcinema.php<br /><br />July 14<br />THE SECRET OF KELLS<br />IRELAND<br />2009, 75 mins. Directed by Tomm Moore and Nora Twomey. A <strong>surprise Oscar nominee for Best Animated Film</strong>, The Secret of Kells follows the adventures of 12-year old Brendan on a dangerous mission to help complete a magical illuminated manuscript. Almost entirely<span class="bbc_u"> hand-drawn</span>, this dazzling film, made in the iconic style of medieval art, is a gorgeous antidote to the familiar style of today&#039;s digital animation. <br /><br /><br />Said to be quite good and interesting.

				Yes, that&#039;s an amazing film.&nbsp; It should have won the Oscar this year.&nbsp; &nbsp;One of the most beautifully animated films I&#039;ve seen in awhile.&nbsp; I&#039;m disappointed about the rain today.&nbsp; But Socrates gets so muddy and I don&#039;t want to sit in the mud :(<br /><br />Rent the film if you can.&nbsp; I definitely recommend it!!<br /><br />And I&#039;ll be geeking out too when the MOMI is all done.&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait.

				Caught &quot;America&#039;s # 1 movie&quot;<br /><br />The American<br />(or A Very Private Gentleman)<br /><br />A bit of watching paint by numbers dry. There&#039;s about 20 mins total of scenes that are interesting. I would have preferred a film more of the sitdowns between the American and the Priest. The rest maybe reads a good deal better in the novel.<br /><br /><br />Could work better as a photo novel.<br /><br />[maybe the real excitement is returning to the Kaufman]
