				So my younger brother got his hands on a Wii, and I want to get him a game for christmas that can accomodate multi players, and has the same type of appeal that Wii Sports does (simple games that you can play after too many beers).&nbsp; If anyone has any recommendations I&#039;d totally appreciate it.&nbsp; Thanks.

				Does he have a copy of &quot;Wii Play&quot; yet?&nbsp; It&#039;s just like Wii sports; simple, fun games you play with your Mii characters.&nbsp; Like table tennis, air hockey, a duck hunt shooting type game, and pool.&nbsp; Probably had the same design team as Wii Sports.&nbsp; It&#039;s 50 bucks, but it comes with an extra Wii controller which would be 40 bucks anyhow.&nbsp; My friends and I played this particular Wii game where you have to use a little tank to destroy other tanks for hours.

				But if I preorder it, I won&#039;t be able to take advantage of beer fueled gaming time at his place over Christmas.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to call him and see if he has Wii play or not, I&#039;m debating between that and Mario Party 8.

				I really like Rayman Raving Rabbids, but it requires a stupidly high score in multiplayer before letting you advance to the next minigame unless you&#039;ve unlocked it in single player (which is much easier).<br /><br />(Of course, you could easily play it single player and just swap the controller)
