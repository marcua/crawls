				Anybody know what happened on 45th Street between Broadway and 34th Avenue last night? I live close by and noticed the street was blocked off by the police last night when I got home. And walking to the subway this morning, Con Edison had trucks and crews up and down the street and even on Broadway. Hmmm. And my lights were flickering last night as well. I hope it wasn&#39;t another underground fire!

				I don&#39;t know, but when we drove up 45th Street around midnight (maybe later), a couple of blocks didn&#39;t have power.

				Wow. Well, I hope those people got their power back now. It would really suck having to deal with this weather without power...<br /><br />Thanks, Masterj!

Shunts were necessary to replace cables damaged by the fire.<br /><br />The cause of the fire is being investigated. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
