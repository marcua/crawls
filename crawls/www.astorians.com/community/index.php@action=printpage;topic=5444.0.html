				While I&#039;m glad he was convicted, I still think it&#039;s a shame he&#039;s being used as a skapegoat for the higher-ups.&nbsp; Cheney and Rove are still able to skate right through this unscathed.

				Everyone would love to get the top guys.<br />(Is there a way to swap Cheney and the Ambassador to Australia? That should be a worthwhile trade.)<br /><br />And wasnt Armitage also involved. (or did he get immunity?)<br /><br />***<br />&quot;Despite our disappointment in the jurors&#039; verdict, we believe in the American justice system and we believe in the jury system,&quot; Wells told reporters outside the federal courthouse. &quot;We intend to file a motion for a new trial and if that is denied, we will appeal the conviction. We have every confidence that ultimately Mr. Libby will be exonerated.... We intend to keep fighting to establish his innocence.&quot;<br /><br />Libby will be allowed to remain free while awaiting sentencing, which is set for June 5.<br />

				http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/09/08/leak.armitage/index.html<br /><br />Armitage <span class="bbc_u">was</span> the leak.<br /><br />Libby just couldn&#039;t remember when he learned that Plame was CIA, and I guess that equals obstruction of justice.<br /><br />but such is the world...<br /><br />Running a concentration camp in Kosovo where the blood had to be mopped off the floors of the &quot;intergation&quot; rooms daily: 20 years in prison (from the Hauge)<br /><br />Robbing a jewelry store in which no one is harmed: 30 years (in USA)<br /><br />and let us not even start on the Rockefeller drug laws...

				What difference does it make that he *was* found guilty on 4 of the 5 counts. If his lawyers can stall his appeals long enough, Bush will pardon him before he leaves office. What a waste of taxpayers money.

				Interesting talk on NPR this morning.<br /><br />Supposedly &#039;some&#039; in the White House considered Meet The Press to be the best forum for getting their message out.<br />Also, they preferred some select reporters at leading newspapers (including the NYT) for speaking and &#039;leaking&#039;.<br /><br />Not great surprises. Just fun that such notes get made public.<br /><br />The 4th estate - Media - is very important. But buyer beware.<br />Any suggested news sources?

Isn&#039;t NBC owned by GE? Heck, when I was the business editor at my two-bit college paper, I witnessed how it worked first hand when I tried to get local businesses in Westchester County to advertise with a controversial and often outrageous student publication!<br /><br />

				I think the London Economist is the best source for world news.&nbsp; They editorialize but never hide bias, and they see the world as whole - want to know about the internal politics of Indonesia? or economic growth in Somolia?<br /><br />BBC is good, but no news outlet aims at a higher IQ or more informed reader than the Economist.
