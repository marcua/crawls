				So, reading about the <strong>roasted liver that Robyn and Laura made</strong> (http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=1730.msg10720#msg10720) got me to wondering - how does roasting it change its texture? For me, the attractiveness of a slab of liver has never been something I&#39;ve gotten.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#39;ve eaten foie gras and been ok with that, but other ways I&#39;ve had liver has not been to my liking. <br /><br />I, for better or worse, have not achieved Jeffrey Steingarten-ness in my eating habits.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="bbc_size"><em>Edited to put in the referring link that I should have done in the first place. Apologies for any confusion.</em></span>

				I have a theory that beef liver is the culprit when the complaint is &quot;that grainy, overly-metallic overbearing taste&quot; because I tried a duck&amp;pork liver pate alongside a duck&amp;pork&amp;beef one and it was surprising how much the cow contribution changed the whole tasting experience. But then, it could just be personal preference! Unfortunately I&#39;ve never tried cooking it at home...

				Last night we had calf&#39;s liver which, although of course beef, has a gentler flavour and texture than beef liver.<br /><br />We roasted the piece whole (about 2.5 lbs) until it was medium-medium rare in the center.&nbsp; For the thinner part, that was 20 minutes at 500, and an additional five minutes for the thicker end.&nbsp; The texture when it&#39;s not overcooked is tender, and not grainy.&nbsp; The taste was not overwhelming, either - definitely liver, yes, but in a good way.&nbsp; Immediately before roasting, we rubbed it gently with a bit of olive oil, and gave it a good dusting of salt.<br /><br />We were also lucky to get an extremely fresh piece.&nbsp; It was really prime.

				I&#39;ve had calves liver and chicken livers, and really, I just don&#39;t like them. Nor do I like pates or liverwurst, particularly. I&#39;m willing to try foie gras once, just to round out the selection of icky liver dishes, but I just may be genetically defective... And it&#39;s not just that it&#39;s an organ meat -- I like tongue and heart and gizzard, and am not opposed to tripe. But, sorry, liver tastes bad. (Although shallots, bacon, pears, and port, in that other thread, sound great!)<br />

My partner&#39;s grandmother who is slovac makes this for us about once a year and it is sooo good. I had never liked chicken livers before I had this dish. She is going to be 90 and she has not lost a bit of her culinary expertise. I think we may have to have her make it in April when we visit. However she always makes enough to feed two armys, LOL.&nbsp; :-o Thanks for the appetite booster :)

				Well, I salted it immediately before roasting simply for flavour.<br /><br />I don&#39;t have a great deal of experience with calf&#39;s liver, so I can&#39;t comment on salt&#39;s effect on purported metallic or other off flavours.&nbsp; The liver we used was extremely fresh; I suspect that off flavours may have more to do with the freshness of the liver, but I don&#39;t really know.&nbsp; Liver is rich in iron, and unless you kasher it (i.e. broil it) to remove the blood, also rich in blood.&nbsp; Because of those, it will naturally have some &quot;metallic&quot; flavour, IMHO.<br /><br />BTW, we used sea salt.
