				As a woman who who buys a monthly metrocard, lives in a 4th floor walkup, has all 4 living grandparents, went to Amsterdam last summer, has no health insurance, is getting pudgy and loves sushi, I will certainly try that when I get home but it will be rather late. I will be sure and let you know all about it.<br /><br />

				TuckerCarlson &quot;political journalist&quot;, as they call him, is a hilarious mess. Like a beautiful disaster. With a bow tie. And stupid shaggy hair. Awesome clip.

				That was amazing. Just thinking about it still makes me smile.<br /><br />That sexy Jon Stewart. He should run for president. Or maybe he should heckle the president. Oh wait, he already does. <br /><br />Heck, it&#39;s fine the way it is...&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				I think you&#39;ve officially hit rock bottom when you appear on Dancing with the Stars. Although arguably he hit rock bottom when Jon Stewart ripped him a new one on Crossfire.

Ah, that was a brilliant show. I have never watched Crossfire before or since, but that made me love Jon Stewart even more, and have a demented pleasure in watching Tucker Carlson look like an idiot dancing in today&#39;s clip from Dancing With the Stars (and he barely even did anything! What was that?).
