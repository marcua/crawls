				&nbsp; &nbsp;I just had my first Reiki experience with Billy this weekend. I didn&#039;t know what to expect but I was excited. When I met Billy he had a very peaceful and calm energy. I&#039;ve been stressed and tense the past couple of weeks. When he started, his hands were around my head but he wasn&#039;t touching me, and I felt a very hot enery between his hands and my body. Vey hot. Like when you put your hand over a flame. Instantly I had this feeling like I just couldn&#039;t help but smile. Like a joy in my body. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; When he was working around my throat area I was on the verge of tears, I wanted to cry. Feelings I have swallowed were trying to get out. This was a huge relief as I know I trap a lot of feelings in my body. Then as he moved down the body I just felt very relaxed and a couple of times I felt a humming energy running around my body and I had the hot energy feeling again a couple of times. It was amazing. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;When he finished he said there was tension around my head, as if I&#039;ve had a lot on my mind for the past couple of weeks. That was exactly true. Then, the funniest thing, is that he said it felt like I&#039;ve been doing something new for my body in the past few weeks, like I&#039;ve been eating a lot of vegetables or something. That is exactly it! Just the past couple of weeks especially I&#039;ve been eating a lot of fresh vegetables in a move towards vegetarianism. Anyway the whole experience was wonderful and I feel great today. Thank you Billy.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;8-)<br />&nbsp;

				Billy is Great !!!<br />I would also like to share my experience with Billy.<br />I have been highly stressed lately and have also been experiencing lower back pains for about 5 months now.<br />The Reiki was very soothing and my tension and my back pain went away !!<br /><br />I was feeling a soothing warmth from his hands even when his hands were just hovering over me. when he placed them on my face it felt amazing. I could feel the energy moving !! it felt like he had a magnet that pulled all my tension &amp; problems out of me.<br /><br />This is great therapy that i highly recommend for everyone&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />Billy you are doing something great for the community by offering your services by donation.<br />I highly respect the work that you are doing and that you are so caring and generous<br />God bless you

Billy is awesome, he took some time to figure out my troubles and to uncover why i was feeling what i was feeling. the session was intense, i felt like i was floating, and i had a huge smile on my face the whole time.<br />I feel like i just came back from a vacation. <br /><br />Ill be going back for sure&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />I too highly recommend Billy<br />

				I had my first Reiki healing with Billy this past weekend and it was truly amazing. He has a very kind demeanor and I immediately felt comfortable around him.&nbsp; <br /><br />Since I wasn&#039;t 100% sure what to expect I went in with an open mind.&nbsp; I was worried that the session would be very &quot;New Agey&quot; but it was nothing like that in the least.&nbsp; He asked a few questions before we started then did the session.&nbsp; Nothing felt rushed and I found myself completely relaxed (which is nearly impossible for me to do normally) and able to truly enjoy the experience.<br /><br />When the session was over he made a few observations and we discussed them and then answered a few of my questions.&nbsp; I walked out of his place feeling like a million dollars and continue to still feel great three days later.<br /><br />Thank you so much for offering this at an affordable rate to the community - you truly are gifted and I will definitely be back!<br /><br />If anyone has specific questions about my experience please feel free to PM me.

				I had a session with Billy this weekend, and just wanted to post to thank him for being so professional and accommodating. This was my first full reiki session so I wasn&#039;t sure what to expect, but since I&#039;ve been feeling a lot of stress the past few months I thought I would give it a try. I think I definitely feel somewhat calmer, and I hope the feeling will last. <br /><br />Thanks again Billy!
