				I am growing herbs right now. Sweet basil, Sweet majoram, and dill is growing nicely, hoepfully the parsely, cilantro, and thyme will start soon. My pots however are overcrowded so I need to start thining them out. Being the person I am not only do I not want to throw away living plants but I do not want to waste something either and just throwing it away. I want to carefully thin them and retransplant the plants and perhaps give them away as gifts or make pretty herb pots with one plant each and sell them for like $5.00. I need something to transplant them into now though so they will grow a little bigger first before I start giving them away. they are too small.<br /><br />I need Egg cartons PLEASE! I can also use plastic bottles, milk and juice containers, anything I can cut the bottom off to put dirt and plants in but I prefere egg cartons. Please help if you can and think of all the recycling you are doing. I would be willing to meet you at peach almost anytime during the day or evening and pick them up from you. Thanks.<br /><br />Colleen

				I might have something ...<br /><br />and I would be very interested in getting my mitts on some herbs if they take the transplanting well. &nbsp;<br /><br />I'll poke through my containers tonight and let you know if I find something good.

				Hi Coleen - <br /><br />I have a few pots and I'd be happy to take a few of your plants off your hands. How should go about this?

				I'd love some herbs too!<br /><br />Wondered if anybody is interested in sharing cuttings/seedlings in the interest of spreading the plant wealth around?<br /><br />I've got a wandering jew, a philodendron, and an un-verigated spider plant. &nbsp;I'd be more than happy to give away cuttings of all 3.<br /><br /><br />cheers,<br />jayme

				I could go for a spider plant. Last time I had one of those was when I lived at home with my parents but it was my moms.<br /><br />&nbsp;I love cheese - I would love the pots, I could meet you at peach almost anyime to pick them up from you. Let me know when a time is good for you.<br /><br />I will have tons of little herb plants growing soon and as soon as I do and they are a little bigger I will let anyone who wants some from peach get some. The sweet basil is growing the best right now. Its getting bigger every day. Think of all the things that one can do with Basil. I can't wait for my herbs to get bigger.
