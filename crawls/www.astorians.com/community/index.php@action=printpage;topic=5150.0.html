				Tonight, my friend and I went to the Unidentified Flying Chicken in Jackson Heights (71st Street and Roosevelt Avenue).&nbsp; The restaurant was featured in a recent NY Times article regarding Korean fried chicken (link to article below).&nbsp; Yes, you read it right, Korean fried chicken. If you like fried chicken, I would suggest you go there!&nbsp; While the service was poor (a very nervous and disorganized woman kept on asking what we ordered!) and we had to wait for at least 40 minutes to get our food, the chicken was absolutely amazing and well worth the annoyance.&nbsp; I have never had fried chicken that was so tasty!&nbsp; In addition, the french fries that we had as our side were very good!<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/07/dining/07fried.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin<br /><br />I recommend that you call your order in about a half an hour ahead of time as they fry the chicken for each order individually.

				A friend of ours brought some of this the other night and it was indeed delectable. Much better than any other fried chicken fare I&#39;ve had here in the city!

				Funny you brought this up...I was just telling my wife about this place because of the article that I read in the Times.&nbsp; I&#39;d like to go and try it but...a 40 minute wait for fried chicken is ridiculous!&nbsp; I thought the whole point was that they fry the chicken 2x...so you&#39;d think all they would have chicken already fried just waiting for an order where they can do the 2nd frying...which shouldn&#39;t take that long....Oh well...I will try it out anyway...I love the name!
