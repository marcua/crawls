			I have not logged on here for quite a while as I was sick and tired of seeing everyones posts get censored, including my own. What a shame the administrators of this site strangled the very life out of it. Just goes to show that too much political correctness can suck the life out of something that was once vibrant and exciting.

			Ain&#039;t that the truth. <br /><br /><br />This site is a ghost town now with more spammers posting than actual members. <br /><br /><br />You reap what you sow...

			Yes, I&#039;m surprised too that there&#039;s no discussion happening regarding the upcoming Amazon takeover of Long Island City. A couple of years ago there would have been an ongoing thread already several pages long. Now.....nothing. Or else no one cares which would be even sadder. <br />

			Poeple care, but the ink is drying on the agreement with the state that circumvents, prevents and effectively squashes any of our concerns. There&#039;s a Reddit thread here: https://www.reddit.com/r/astoria/comments/9wq5zj/amazon_hq_2_megathread/<br /><br />

			I read occasionally but stopped contributing after large groups highjacked the site to push their political narratives after the election. Ruined what was a vibrant, interactive local interest site.
