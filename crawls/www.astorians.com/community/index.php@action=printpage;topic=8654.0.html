				I&#039;ve provided all the software and hardware, and I function as administrator for the site. But the board has its own moderator team that will develop the site to best meet the needs of Jackson Heights. I&#039;m excited about it.

				Excellent, it looks really nice :) I&#039;m glad to see the idea is catching on!<br /><br />What&#039;s next, merm? Let me know if you need an on-the-ground person to scope out the possibility of a similar site for neighborhoods in amsterdam :) I&#039;m all about building community, you know.

I wouldn&#039;t be suprised if other local areas contact you wish to start something that is connected throughout all Queens. I do have a question though. Who pays for all this bandwith?

				Hi Astorians, I just wanted to say thanks to those of you who have come visited us over at your Jackson Heights sister site&nbsp; - we appreciate the support and traffic while we are getting up and running.&nbsp; We already have over 100 registered users only one week after launching. Thanks again to merm for helping us and doing all the hard work.<br /><br />Maybe someday we will have to have an inter-neighborhood mixer. . .
