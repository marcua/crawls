				You know, there are the people who love Valentine&#039;s Day (either because they have a partner or they just love love love), and there are the people who hate Valentine&#039;s Day (either because they don&#039;t have a partner or because of the commercialism), but where are the other people like me who don&#039;t really care about Valentine&#039;s Day?

Neither one of us is much into it, but it was simple and sweet.<br /><br />Yet, I still feel the &quot;bah humbuggery&quot; because I&#039;m a cynic by nature.

				I have the same fortune (or extreme boredom, depending on how you look at it).&nbsp; I have no job but to sit in front of a computer, make change for customers, and make sure people don&#039;t run off with the computers.&nbsp; It&#039;s great most times; other times I&#039;d rather shoot rubber bands into my eyes.

				Yeah, my bustling position in the corporate bankruptcy law world provides for lots of time to read news articles, practice making paper footballs and post on the internet.
