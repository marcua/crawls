				I moved here in early September. Almost immediately, I placed an order for Verizon&nbsp; DSL. That was September 6th. On September 25th, I finally called them and wanted to know where the Hades my DSL kit was, etc. They said that the order had been canceled and I would have to re-order. Did anyone contact me to let me know? Of course not! Hahahah!<br /><br />So I re-ordered (yes, stupid, I know). They said they would ship the modem in 5 days and my &quot;service activation date&quot; was October 1. So I wait again. On October 2nd, I still haven&#39;t received anything and I call them again. They said the &quot;SAD&quot; was pushed up to October 3rd. I ask, where&#39;s my DSL kit? So they shuffle me around to a half-dozen different departments trying to figure out what&#39;s going on, until I finally get connected with this lady that has and English accent: she tells me she&#39;ll ship me a DSL kit overnight and remove the charge from my bill. Great! Finally someone who knows what they&#39;re doing.<br /><br />So all day yesterday I hung around waiting for the DSL kit.<br /><br />Guess what? Never showed up.<br /><br />So I call them again this morning, and someone tells me that they <em>cancelled the order</em>. She can&#39;t tell me WHY, of course, just that it was cancelled and I would have REORDER.<br /><br />Screw Verizon.<br /><br />What else is available here? I&#39;ve heard about Earthlink, TWC, and RCN.<br /><br />Broadband Review: RCN - http://www.dslreports.com/comments/1781?1=1&amp;p=2<br />Broadband Review: Earthlink - http://www.dslreports.com/comment/1938/54144<br /><br />After reading about TWC and RCN, they don&#39;t sound so great. Is Earthlink any better?<br /><br />Please tell me that SOMEONE around here offers broadband signup that doesn&#39;t contain harmful side effects such as yelling, screaming, biting, andtearing one&#39;s hair out.

				TWC = Earthlink. They are exactly the same, just different branding. Same lines, routers, everything.<br /><br />That being said, both RCN and TWC/Earthlink are what I&#39;d define as &quot;good&quot; in Astoria. I seldom have had an outage on either of those carriers. If you&#39;re thinking TWC/Earthlink I&#39;d use the &quot;Earthlink&quot; brand of the service, since it&#39;s a bit cheaper (unless you already have TWC cable TV in which case I think you qualify for a discount on TWC internet).

				think of this as a sign from the gods. verizon dsl sucks. the connection is slow. the servce goes out like every other month. customer service is inept, and in bangledesh half the time. last night i fixed the problem i was having while on the phone, and as i was trying to tell her, she decides my password is wrong (something i double check before i call, and it&#39;s auto stored so it never changes)and before i can say &quot;no it&#39;s ok&quot; she resets it. then i can&#39;t reset it back to my old one b/c now it needs a number. then it changed my security answer and i couldn&#39;t put the correct one back since now it has to be 5 characters when it was always 4 before. last night was the first time i wished they&#39;d asked me if i could be transferred for a survey of CS performance. this woman was DUMB. the first thing i said was &quot;all my lights are green and steady, none are flashing like they are supposed to&quot; what does she ask me next? &quot;is your dsl light flashing?&quot; ARGH!! <br />verizon is a hassle. get something else and save yourself further aggravation.<br />the only reason i have it is because we don&#39;t have cable to set up cable modems. one of my roommates refuses to get cable. and our utilities would jump up if we switched to that instead of satellite. we&#39;re getting what we pay for.

				A few people mentioned that RCN shapes traffic - blocking bittorrent traffic, for example. Have any of you experienced any issues with that?

				TWC is pretty decent overall.&nbsp; I have Verizon for phone service and that&#39;s bad enough.&nbsp; They really seem to enjoy being awful to their customers (though I think their reception is supposed to be better than their competitors).

				That&#39;s actually kind of funny (in a depressing way), because we had almost the same exact experience with Verizon.&nbsp; The ironic thing is that when we first moved to the city a few years ago, we had the exact opposite experience.&nbsp; We spent long hours over the phone with Time Warner trying to convince them to let us pay them lots of money, but they just couldn&#39;t get their s*#@ together, and they stood us up on two occasions and on the third try, they came at like 11:30pm and couldn&#39;t figure out how to install the damn thing (even though we lived in a newly-wired cable ready high rise in Manhattan where everybody else had the damn service already).&nbsp; So -- and this was already a month after we moved -- we finally called Verizon, and they came right over and hooked up DSL without a hitch, and it worked well for us for two years.<br /><br />Fast forward to our move to Astoria (at the end of August).&nbsp; We wanted to continue with Verizon DSL (we had no problem with its service, and it&#39;s a few bucks cheaper than cable), and they said it wouldn&#39;t be a problem for them to hook up the DSL as soon as our phone line was up and going.&nbsp; The phone line was good to go on August 30.&nbsp; No DSL.&nbsp; We call Verizon (with the requisite being on hold for an hour), and they say it takes the DSL a few days to &quot;kick in.&quot;&nbsp; We wait a few days, call again, are put on hold for an hour (at work!), only to be told by someone in India that there&#39;s some kind of problem, but they can&#39;t tell us what it is or how long it will take to be fixed, or if it can be fixed.&nbsp; We ask to speak to a supervisor- same repsonse.&nbsp; We wait a few more days and call again.&nbsp; On hold for an hour.&nbsp; we are told that they have no record of us wanting DSL or some crap like that.&nbsp; Ask to speak to a supervisor- on hold for an hour.&nbsp; Response: Some problem with the line.&nbsp; Question: &quot;Can we get DSL or not?&quot;&nbsp; Response: &quot;I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ll call you back in a few days.&quot;&nbsp; Nobody ever calls us back.&nbsp; At this point, we&#39;ve been at our new place for two weeks without internet.&nbsp; So I just called up Time Warner and had them come set up Earthlink.&nbsp; They were actually quite professional and efficient (only thing was, their next opening was like a week later).&nbsp; Actually, the really annoying thing is that Earthlink offers a &quot;self-installation kit,&quot; which includes the software and modem and coax cable, etc., which you can pick up for free upon signing up for cable internet- this is extremely easy to set up, and in theory, should have saved me from having to wait a week for the cable guy to come.&nbsp; But, here&#39;s the catch- apparently, the Queens self-installation kit is different from the Manhattan one, so I couldn&#39;t just pick up the kit in Manhattan where I work- oh no, I would have had to go to the Time Warner store in JAMAICA.&nbsp; That bites.&nbsp; But anyway, after waiting a week, the dude came over and installed the thing very quickly, and so now we&#39;re online.&nbsp; Time Warner is a few bucks more, but they got me online and Verizon couldn&#39;t.<br /><br />next project: get rid of land line!&nbsp; no more money to verizon.<br />bennyt

				I have to say I had a great experience with Verizon DSL. &nbsp;We already had home and wireless service with them and when we placed the order with them for the DSL, the modem and SAD was sent &amp; activated without any issue. &nbsp;I even had them walk me through the installation on the phone so I didn&#39;t have to use the CD&#39;s they sent. &nbsp;Even when I&#39;ve called for help they&#39;ve been great and always had a fluent english speaking person on the phone (I can get crazy over that issue, but have to defend them in this case). &nbsp;I also find that their wireless service is the best in the city. &nbsp;Others with Sprint, or other services can be standing right next to me without service or in a roaming mode, while I dial out just fine with clear and quick service. &nbsp;

				We had a bad experience with Verizon DSL, but that may have been because it was supposed to have been installed on September 11.&nbsp; I can&#39;t blame them for having lost our order, because their main computer that contained the records was destroyed (yes, they had a backup, but that was the least of everyone&#39;s problems around then).<br /><br />A few months later we got the cable modem instead, through TWC, and it&#39;s been great.&nbsp; We don&#39;t subscribe to cable but we have the wiring and were using it as an antenna, and they installed a splitter so we could still do that -- and now we get most of basic cable to boot.

				If you hook up a cable directly to the TV (no box), you get whatever&#39;s coming through that isn&#39;t blocked.&nbsp; We&#39;ve had two TWC reps hook the cable up (when we first had it installed, and when we had to have the modem replaced last year), and we get some channels.&nbsp; Not full basic, though.

				I should probably mention that I have Verizon DSL also and have had no problems. Well not NO problems -- ocassionally it does something fishy and I have to call them and they walk me through a quick fix on the phone no prob. And sometimes it fixes itself. That said, the installation process was kinda hellish. But once it was done, things have been good.<br /><br />On the other hand. I&#39;ll never give another cent to Time Warner Cable. Worst. Customer. Service. Ever. This was my experience just for the cable, not the internet service. But I wasn&#39;t about to go sign up for cable internet after the hell I went through just to be able to watch uninterrupted TV.
