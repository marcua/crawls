				<strong>New York Voices: The Greenmarket at 30</strong><br />(WNET, Channel 13, Friday, November 24, 2006 at 10:30 PM)<br /><br />If you were wondering how the city’s greenmarkets came into being, Thirteen’s public affairs series celebrates the 30th anniversary of these unique New York City institutions. Historian Barry Lewis, best know from Thirteen’s “A Walk Through” series will be featured in the program.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(http://www.thirteen.org/homepage/images/home/homepage_header_01.jpg)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />(http://www.thirteen.org/nyvoices/images/newyorkvoices.gif)<br />(http://www.thirteen.org/nyvoices/images/feature_title.gif)<br /><strong><br />Greenmarket at 30</strong><br />It&#39;s hard to imagine that in a city where you can get a bagel with ten kinds of cream cheese at 4 a.m., it used to be a challenge to simply find a fresh, juicy, delicious-tasting peach. 30 years ago, our restaurants were great, but our fruits and vegetables left much to be desired. Visionaries Barry Benepe and Bob Lewis saw a produce-challenged city surrounded by struggling small farms, and thought &quot;aha!&quot; And thus, the <span class="bbc_u">Greenmarket</span> (http://www.cenyc.org/site/) was born.<br /><br />What started with a few farmers selling tomatoes and eggplant on 59th Street has become a New York institution. With 45 markets sprinkled throughout the five boroughs, the Greenmarket system has changed the way New Yorkers shop, eat, and cook. Today, one need look no further than the local Greenmarket to find produce so fresh, it may have been dug out of the soil just a few hours earlier; produce so varied, one can spend all day deciding which of 350 different varieties of peppers to buy, or figuring out what to do with unusual vegetables like purslane or crosnes. It&#39;s one of the reasons celebrated restaurateur <span class="bbc_u">Danny Meyer</span> (http://www.ushgnyc.com/) opened up his first restaurant, Union Square Cafe, in that area: he wanted his chefs to be within walking distance of the market and all that it had to offer.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><strong>The whole article can be found</strong> <span class="bbc_u"><strong>here</strong></span> (http://www.thirteen.org/nyvoices/features/greenmarket.html).<br /><br /><br />
