				Doesn&#039;t seem to be any activity and it&#039;s been closed for a while. That&#039;s got to be costing the owner a lot of $$$....<br /><br />Maybe the owner(s) are flush with cash and can afford to shut down for several weeks, but I have a hunch the place is not going to be back soon.... :?

				It&#039;s a long time for a small, cash business to be without revenue. Shut downs are very costly in other ways too -- it&#039;s hard to recoup business because customers might not come back. Especially when there are a bunch of alternatives in the immediate vicinity.<br /><br />Like I said, maybe the owners can float for a while w/out the income (and I hope so... I like Oleput a lot and want it to reopen), but that&#039;s more the exception than the rule.<br /><br />

				construction usually slows down in the winter when it rains and snows but in this particular situation I think its because the current slowdown in the real estate market.

				What paratactical said.&nbsp; One of the biggest points in the cafe wars was that the product being served was overpriced and sub par, and that the clientele was typically at these places to be seen, so people avoided them.&nbsp; This in turn got people up in arms.&nbsp; Now the same arguments are being used by people who defended the cafés against another business.&nbsp; As I&#039;ve said before, I don&#039;t go to cafés, be it Fló or Oleput, so in the end it doesn&#039;t matter to me, I simply found this double standard at least slightly humorous.

				As a business owner, you should know that there is no such thing as overcharging. &nbsp;There is price gouging due to supply/demand inequities created by geography. &nbsp;There is the selling of product or service which cannot be supported by the market. &nbsp;In cafe rich Astoria, the former certainly is not the case, the latter may be.<br /><br />

				I don&#039;t understand how, if the market is willing/able to support the prices, their prices can be considered overcharging. Especially for something as non-essential as coffee and pastry.<br /><br />Of course, I didn&#039;t take econ, so maybe I&#039;m missing something here.

				Sorry, but this seems to be something of a Queens issue. There are places like Oleput all over Brooklyn and Manhattan that serve coffee, wine, pastries at higher prices in exchange for what some consider a cool ambiance. I happen to think Oleput&#039;s a charming little cafe that adds something to the neighborhood. Plus, the owners are local. We could stand a few more places like it, in my opinion. Of course, I&#039;m a hipster, so what do I know? Maybe I should be living in Brooklyn.

				Sounds to me more like Pink Floyd has an axe to grind with Oleput&#039;s owners -- maybe because Oleput is cutting into his profits, or he wanted that space himself and was outbid.&nbsp; Otherwise, if he doesn&#039;t like it, all he has to do is not patronise it, rather than badmouth it every chance he gets.<br /><br />The coffee I get in the morning costs $2.71 at Starbucks, $3 at Oleput, and $3.50 at Freeze Peach (if they were open mornings).&nbsp; Is it pricey?&nbsp; Sure, it&#039;s more than the swill I could get other places, but Oleput is in line with the other higher-end coffee places around.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried coffee in many other places along Ditmars and I prefer the taste of it at Oleput or Freeze Peach (more so than Starbucks).&nbsp;

				lanseaux you are so wrong in your assessment its funny.<br />First of all I am not in the same business as them, secondly I never bid on that location because its too small for me and thirdly I have no axe to grind with oleput i have an axe with every place that sells ambiance and b/s.<br />I hate starbucks coffee just as much as oleput, maybe its because I am 40 and I am not the target market for this places.<br />Sometimes I forget that this is a different generation, me and a 24 year old do not respond to the same way to the s___ being spewed by the advertising and merchants<br />IMO this is a microcosm of the American economy instead of selling the best product at the best price everyone now wants to sell a brand with no real substance behind it. Nike makes a shoe in china for $6 pays labron james 300 million dollars so now that show has to sell for $120. this is only one example of a long list. <br />What made this country the biggest and the best in the world is not the selling of smoke and mirrors.<br />there is alot more i want to say but its too political.

				For what it&#039;s worth, I&#039;m near 24 and I agree with you for the most part. I won&#039;t spend the money on shoes, bags, pants or the like that most people do. Heck, the only reason I even have a TV is that I got one for free on the street. But I there are the occasional things I&#039;m okay with spending money on. While I&#039;d never get the food or the ice cream at Oleput, their coffee beverages are superior to the cheaper alternatives in the area. <br /><br />On another note, to me, overpriced has always meant that I thought the quality of the good was not worth the price that was being asked.

				I think what pink floyd is really upset about is that he started a thread with a negative opinon of oleput and the first handful of responses were all folks who like oleput.&nbsp; Some people like them, some people don&#039;t, some people will pay their prices, some people won&#039;t, we get it.

				heff i am not upset about anything<br />I am sure that there are many people who like oleput.<br />I am also sure that there are people who might think that i place i like and frequent is a horrible place and they will never go there themselves, that is the beauty of a free market.<br /><br /><br />Frappe <br />I answered that way because i thought you were joking,<br />I can imagine you going to a bank with that idea.<br />I used to be amazed at the kind of business that cater to a select few but not anymore. The last 6-7 years has made people in this country so rich that they are looking for ways to spend it in unusual ways. I guess if your buying a pooch for 3 grand a carrying bag for one grand on top of that spend a few hundreds a month on food toys day spas then why not buy your little doggy freshly baked organic dog treats.<br />with 3 girls at home I like to spend my money on unimportant things like clothes food a home and a college fund but that is just me what do I know.

				Nawh, not joking at all.&nbsp; Also sell dog clothing too.&nbsp; Some folks find it pretty overpriced and they scoff, but enough find it a good value to support a mid-town manhattan store rent that dwarfs the ones paid on Ditmars.&nbsp; <br /><br />We have a high level of disposible income in this country which allows us to spend on things which we like.&nbsp; The way people wish to spend it is as unique as the individual.&nbsp;

I dont think that shelter, food and warmth are what defines our needs any longer. <br /><br />And I have still not been to Oleput, although, last time I was at Freeze Peach and ordered a warm cider, watching the barista pour 5 ounces of cider out of a store bought container and then ask for $4 made me wince. But, I do frequent their couches often so I kinda consider it a rent payment as well.

				I think we&#039;re all ignoring a very important issue here: Oleput has the best damn brownies on Ditmars. Also the best ice cream on Ditmars.

				Well, here&#039;s the deal. Just called over to Sparrow for the low down on Oleput.&nbsp; Bartender there says they got the beer &amp; wine license already.&nbsp; They are renovating to make space for&nbsp; a bar(?) and more room to sit.&nbsp; Also putting in a small kitchen of sorts and will be selling some sort of food.&nbsp; Should be open by Christmas.&nbsp; BUT she is not the owner. It is what she has been told.&nbsp; She asked me why people doubt this since there is a sign in the window explaining what they are doing.&nbsp; I have no idea what the sign says but there you go.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hope this helps.&nbsp; I for one am looking forward to the reopening.

				Very interesting posts. &nbsp;A few random thoughts:<br /><br />My husband is 57 and I am nearly 50 (OMG), and we like Oleput as well as the cafes. &nbsp;We like being around younger and older people. &nbsp;Everyone has something to offer and one can learn from every age group.<br /><br />I run a hotel. &nbsp;We are currently charging over $700 plus tax for a 240 square foot room. &nbsp;The hotel is full. &nbsp;The market can bear it. &nbsp;It is price gouging, but it is a matter of supply and demand right now. &nbsp;Also, there is a market out there willing to pay!<br /><br />I sometimes pay $5.00 for a really great double espresso and sometimes I don&#039;t feel like spending money and drink our coffee at work.<br /><br />To each his or her own!

				so many issues<br /><br /><br />1st of all - ART IS A NECESSITY.&nbsp; Get it (visual/music/performance) back in the public schools!!!<br /><br />2nd.&nbsp; I think Oleput prices are sort of high.&nbsp; But I also think Starbucks, and Freezepeach, and the cafes on 30th prices are kinda high.&nbsp; And I think Dunkin Donuts coffee blows.. and don&#039;t understand why people even group DD with places that make good coffee (Starbucks is debatable - I know) <br /><br />3rd.&nbsp; I like to think of the high price as RENT.&nbsp; Don&#039;t go there for take out.&nbsp; You pay for the atmosphere you may as well use it.&nbsp; And stay for a few hours to get your $$ worth. <br /><br />4th.&nbsp; There used to be a cafe in Tel Aviv that didn&#039;t actually sell anything. People would sit at the tables and read or use their computers or whatever.. and then when they were done sitting they would get the bill.&nbsp; Apparently it was an extremely cool/hip spot.&nbsp; <br /><br />5th.&nbsp; It went out of business after a few months.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

				Art may be necessary for you to have a certain kind or style of life, but it is not necessary for life itself--the physical which keeps the body alive. <br /><br />I think it&#039;s important to keep in mind that all of these things we&#039;re debating about (jewelry, coffee, brownies, dog treats) are things which we are lucky to have to debate about. There are people in parts of the world who can&#039;t argue about such things because they have to worry about sustaining life itself. It&#039;s not that we should feel bad or we shouldn&#039;t have these things. I support things that are necessary to the kinds of lives people want, but it&#039;s important to remind oneself that these are not the things that make life possible, these are the things that enrich the life once its physical needs are met. These are first world problems and we&#039;re really lucky to have them and not the others that we can.<br /><br />I&#039;d also like to say that in my opinion, the most vital and important of art in ones life is that which makes nor demands money. The art that you make and that you share with those in your lives is the most vital, at least to me, and that doesn&#039;t have to cost a thing.

				As for the bags, even buying in bulk from Pennsylvania (with all of the pulp refineries there, it is a center for paper products, including a neat outfit called Dunder Mifflin based out of Scranton), nice, attractive, debbie sized bags run 22 cents per unit before tax and delivery, whereas cheap plastic &quot;Thank you&quot; bags run a penny or two.&nbsp; Is it overcharging to pass this luxury along to the consumer?<br /><br />The ability of humans to see in the abstract and conjure questions beyond the here and now has come with the price tag of needing art for our mental well being.&nbsp; But what is art?&nbsp; What makes it so necessary?&nbsp; Is it limited only to things produced for art, either art for art&#039;s sake or art for money&#039;s sake (or a combo of the two)?&nbsp; I certainly don&#039;t think so and I think this is what the disagreement is based on.<br /><br />For me, art produced for either is wholly unnecessary, be it paintings, jewlery or <em>music concerts/cd&#039;s</em>, because they are artistic expressions for the creator, not me (though creating the art itself is extremely satisfying).&nbsp; I find my own art, be it hearing the muffled wind in my ears at the beach, a header goal in soccer, multicolored leaves on the pavement, the smell of aquanet hair spray (weird, but I grew up in the 80&#039;s and I have good associations with it), old derelict factories, clam sauce, et cetera.&nbsp; It is from those things I get my mental well being.&nbsp; The art I need mixes in with life so much that it is hard to tell the two apart.

				after sleeping on this i came to a similar conclusion as paratactical.<br />The reasons that make this country so great is the same reasons other nations are jealous and hate it.<br />This kind of luxury you find in the US is hard to find in any other place. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if some tourist walked into frappe place and went back home and opened the exact business because people from all over the world come here to learn how to make money.<br />If people here don&#039;t see the problem with a place like oleput (and i wish them all the luck in the world) then you need to look 2-3 years down the road. Once a bottom price is established its never going to go under only higher. Today you are very comfertable paying $5 for an excellent cup of coffee but where does it stop? The next guy to open up&nbsp; a coffee place will charge $7 because higher prices &quot;represents&quot; higher status and the next guy might charge $10. Ten years ago $4 coffees on every corner didn&#039;t exist so we don&#039;t know what we will have on every corner in 10 years. If you think I am wrong look no further then restaurants selling $50 burgers and $30 hot dogs.<br /><br />And for all the people who keep saying that if i don&#039;t like just don&#039;t go, that is not the point. I will not go there that is a fact but i can give my opinion on it.

				You&#039;ve contradicted yourself because clearly if you don&#039;t want to pay the price they charge, there are still cheaper options. you can go get a cup from one of the dozens of deli&#039;s or go to dunkin donuts. Free enterprise is exactly that. There are more than several options on Ditmars, 30th, B&#039;Way, etc as to where you can get a cup of coffee. <br /><br />I seriously think this is rooted in jealousy rather than business principle.<br />The owners of Sparrow and Oleput are locals, not corporate invaders. Let it go dude.

PF also never said there weren&#039;t other options or other places or whatever. All his position has been is that Oleput is too expensive and overrated for his tastes. I&#039;m inclined to agree with this position. As far as I can remember from the thread, PF never said that everyone should stop going there. People keep mistaking a personal opinion for someone saying &quot;Everyone else do what I do!&quot;<br /><br />Also, I think some of the people in this thread have been pretty nasty to PF and while some of PF&#039;s comments have seemed a little angry or aggressive, calling him jealous or suggesting that he just wanted to rent the space instead of them is petty and rude. Just because he&#039;s not on the side of the majority opinion on the Oleput issue doesn&#039;t mean that we can&#039;t all be civil in our discussion. <br /><br />I would hope that in future discussions on this kind of thing we can all be less inflamatory. I know I&#039;m guilty of it too when I get fired up, but it&#039;s disheartening to be the only one with an opinion and immediately get ganged up against. I like a diversity of opinions and keeping people with other views around is important to maintaining a board like this as an actual valuable resource.

				Cool.<br /><br />First, you put in enough effort to remark on how detailed my post is and that it was a joke, but not enough to ascertain the question I asked.<br />Second, you have taken the time and effort to make your opinions very well known, but not enough time and effort to repond to the simple question of what business do you run.<br />Third, you went through the effort to spell check a word, but not the effort to figure out what the phrase meant.<br /><br />If English is not your first language, I can certainly appreciate one missing some of the nuances, even if fluent.&nbsp; But I just did a quick scan of your posts and I have noticed that you know almost all of the nuances of the English language, so I find it pretty difficult to believe that you need the phrase explained to you.&nbsp; I think you know exactly what it means, but you&#039;re avoiding the obvious contradiction of anti-consumerism and dropping down money for recorded music (or concerts).<br /><br />Re: Your college education.&nbsp; The level of one&#039;s formal education should never be used as a detriment on one&#039;s opinion, nor as a defence.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				don&#039;t worry they will open soon enough because lets face it, it happens all the time that a cafe or restaurant closes for revovations during the busiest time of the year because they are doing so well.<br />You people can give me all the negative feedback you like but as you can see a business cant survive catering to a chosen few and when i &quot;bad mouthed&quot; this place it was only on the business aspect of it.<br />I do not wish for anyone to go under , when you invest all your money and energy to any business you want to succeed and when i went in there once I knew right away that it will not work. <br />I hope they will come back and revovate and make a go of this place.<br />I have tried IL bambino because of this forum and i found it to be a great place with excellent food and great service maybe oleput can see how they did it and try a new approach.

That is not the case. Like any other chain, Starbucks was once just a single location. It took them years to get where they are now.<br />As for Oleput, it&#039;s just a cafe that sells coffee, gourmet desserts, and some sodas. I don&#039;t get why you keep going on about this place, as if what they&#039;re doing is outrageous. Yes, they are expensive, but there are similar places all over America and various other countries. Freezepeach isn&#039;t cheap, and neither is Waltz. Neither is Starbucks. You might also say that they cater to a chosen few, and yet I don&#039;t see you going on about them. The impression I&#039;m getting from you is that the Oleput guys personally screwed you over, but you don&#039;t want to say that, so instead you keep making up reasons why the mere idea of the place is bad.

				When a new business, just making a name for itself, suddenly closes for renovations it&#039;s a major disappointment.&nbsp; I think there is something to be said for consistency and allowing your customer to understand what kind of establishment you are, where you are headed, and whom you wish to attract to be a patron.&nbsp; <br /><br />The issue for me isn&#039;t about the cafe&#039;s bottom line but more about what the establishment set out to be and why/how it is so quickly changing.&nbsp; They obviously think it&#039;s ok to stay closed for 6 weeks, regardless of how much it may be costing them in revenue, and that turns me off a bit.&nbsp; I miss my new option and I don&#039;t desire another bar. I was enjoying the little cafe that sells overpriced coffee and homemade cakes (although both were not superb).&nbsp; I pay for the ambiance and free wifi. <br /><br />Point is, don&#039;t open, get me excited and then close for 6 weeks +. Most people aren&#039;t sitting around waiting for the reopen. Growth and change is good, but&nbsp; learn how to do it smartly without losing your customer base to all the other options around. <br /><br />Oh and BTW, what about the employees who worked there. Did they lose their jobs?

				I wasn&#039;t in anyway trying to not be supportive. Just stating my disappointment. In fact, I realize that it is their business and only they know how long they can close for.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t think it&#039;s the best move as far as keeping a solid client base. <br /><br />My sister is a small business owner and I have worked with her extensively.&nbsp; When the business needs changes there is no way we would close the doors for more than a few days. We worked around it, always making sure that we and the shop were available to the customer. Growth of any kind is great but business renovations, typically shouldn&#039;t occur within the first year of opening. It&#039;s important to become acclimated and in decent financial standing before investing in renovations, it&#039;s just smart. But like I said, it&#039;s their business not mine. I know they have Sparrow money as well.&nbsp; I&#039;m just saying I&#039;m not waiting around and not going anywhere else.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have bad wishes for them.&nbsp; I just think they could have found of way to expedite&nbsp; the change, even if it meant opening the shop p/t.&nbsp; I&#039;m confused as I heard nearly first hand that the Williamsburg business really tapped them out. I figured staying open here in Astoria really could have helped that situation. But who knows what the financial situation is. They could have a backer or have lots of capital to allow them to stay closed so long.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t think it&#039;s good for customers to see a closed shop.

				Hopefully<br /><br />The place opens again and Astoria continues to have options .Dunkin is across the street , Starbucks is a stones throw and <br />there are plenty of places and things to gripe about for everyone. <br /><br />Bottom line is Oleput is a great addition to the area, and like many of the business owners in Astoria could tell you the Dec/Jan months are the slowest , least profitable months of the year. So the guys at Oleput , were very smart to do the renovations and close up during this time frame. <br /><br />If you don&#039;t like the idea of Oleput , Freeze Peach , Fatty&#039;s , Waltz, Crescent &amp; Vine, Il Bambino ,Cafe /Bistro 33 ,Sparrows..Kristee&#039;s.. or any other establishment that are attempting to run a business, have fun and take the chance to actually do something. Then don&#039;t go to them.<br /><br />They have every right to attempt to create something they love .<br />You have every right to live in your world also.<br /><br />Maybe its&nbsp; &quot;Just Me&quot; <br /><br /><br />BUT<br />&quot;Be Nice&quot;<br />&amp; &quot;Do Something &quot;<br />

				Hey all.<br /><br />Ate at Sparrow a few weeks ago and had a few seconds to chat with Evan. <br /><br />Yes, they are getting a liquor license, but I am not thrilled that they also plan to turn off the WiFi after 6 PM &quot;so that not everyone there is in their own little world.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Now, I don&#039;t mind paying a slight premium to camp out and enjoy the wifi and the ambience--I used to be a freelance writer, and I like to write in my spare time, and I love places like Waltz, Oleput, and Sparrow for their wifi.&nbsp; And, I do indeed order more than coffee at Oleput--I typically get a coffee beverage or herb tea (depending on the time) and one of their excellent ice cream floats or fruit smoothies.&nbsp; I once ordered peach pie, and it was in fact a bit dry--and overpriced for what it was.&nbsp; In all honesty, store-bought pie <strong>woulda </strong>been better.&nbsp; The ice cream was peerless, though.<br /><br />My one fear for the place is that a liquor license plus no wifi after work will make it a less bookish, quiet place and more of a meat market.&nbsp; Mind you, I don&#039;t have issues with meat markets in general; however, I have had more interesting conversations (believe it or not) whilst working on my computer in a semi-quiet cafe&#039; with hip music in the background than at any bar.&nbsp; FWIW, I am one of those &quot;wandering tech help gurus&quot; that can usually diagnose and fix any computer problem, so maybe I&#039;m just in my element in cybercafes, but still...<br /><br />OTOH, if Oleput starts serving hot appetizers and savories (which I also understand is in the cards if I heard right), then the place may just transform into a Baby Sparrow or something.&nbsp; We&#039;ll see.&nbsp; <br /><br />PS--to anyone who is wondering--I am a SWF, turn 40 in March; been in the &#039;hood for almost 7 years, did 8 years in Brooklyn Heights back in the days before 9/11 and know what it is to see a neighborhood grow too quickly.&nbsp; Native NYer from the Bronx.&nbsp; And no, I don&#039;t like MoreBucks coffee, but remember when they used to really at least TRY for that &quot;small cafe&#039;&quot; feel.<br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;ve actually been hoping and waiting for either wifi-free cafes or areas within cafes prohibiting them. IMO it has gotten *much* more difficult over the years to find a seat because so many people park and camp out for hours if not all day over their laptops. I won&#039;t miss &#039;em!

				Ya know I was thinking...It was mentioned above (and its certainly true) that January and February are the hardest months of the year and the best time to reno...My mother had a bookstore for quite a while and January was always her lowest selling month..But then I got to thinking..I NEED warm coffee in the winter months. I really only stop into coffee shops in the summer for iced biz, but that&#039;s much less frequently than in the winter when I can get my hot cup in the morn, maybe defrost a bit etc- I see more people in Starbucks on freezing mornings than in the summer months. So, in my novice opinion, I actually think doing repairs in the winter when you offer hot beverages isn&#039;t the best idea. :-o

				Oleput re-opens tomorrow! I was walking on Ditmars, and after taking a gander at the new Balkan/Middle Eastern grocery/deli that&#039;s going to be taking the place of the former Greek/Italian deli, I noticed that Oleputs door was open. So I sauntered on over and saw one of the owners inside ( I forget his name) and asked him when they&#039;re re-opening. So he said tomorrow. Kewlies....

				I am so over it! Gates are up, gates are down.&nbsp; You never know when it&#039;s open and at this point I&#039;m turned off by the whole thing.&nbsp; <br /><br />I spoke to the manager the other day (not Evan or Mano) and he said that things were really slow when they were a coffee/internet place.&nbsp; &quot;We did away with internet&quot; and the old fashioned fridges and have replaced the space with more seating and more food options like paninis. He said that they were closed for so long because they were waiting for &quot;the wine&quot; while he was waiting for his job. But he also said, the Williamsburg spot was bumping and crazy busy &#039;til 3am all the time. Maybe they couldn&#039;t juggle it all. <br /><br />Nevertheless, I just think these guys do what they want, when they want, and how they want.&nbsp; It&#039;s not about us, it&#039;s about them.&nbsp; Regardless, I still go to Sparrow...at least I know when they are open.

				It&#039;s disappointing that they can do so well in Williamsburg and not here. What is that place like? (I mean their place, not Williamsburg. I know all too well what that&#039;s like).<br /><br />I think they should make it a nice, old fashioned, non-sports &quot;corner bar&quot; and do away with the food stuff. Have some nuts or something and that&#039;s it. Don&#039;t most restaurants make most of their money from alcoholic beverages anyway? Why bother with food? Even Sparrow seems more like a restaurant to me now than a bar. Same thing with Crescent and Wine. I don&#039;t think they&#039;d lack from customers.&nbsp; <br /><br />Do they even have the wine license yet?

				FINALLY tried Oleput last night for the first time, and it was terrific! Helps that it was uncrowded.<br /><br />At first, we wanted a bit of coffee to wind down the evening (well, we were set for a night bike ride, but then got comfy.) Sat down and the BF noticed people drinking beer, so we got that instead. Then another. Then we got hungry. <em>Then </em> we had coffee (decaf).<br /><br />The beer selection is unique, and we enjoyed the dark German selection. The sandwiches were not cheap but very tasty and again, somewhat unique/ upscale (kinda like what I&#039;ve eaten @ Sparrow.) BF had the chorizo and I had the grilled cheese. Both came with bitter greens which I love. Coffee was fine.<br /><br />Best of all was the service. The waiter was friendly and knew the beer well. The woman was also friendly and when we asked about the music, not only did she check on it for us, she asked our opinion of it. That was cool.<br /><br />So I can fully understand why they&#039;d serve drinks and food rather than just coffee: We were going to spend a few bucks on coffee, maybe a few more on a snack, but ended up spending nearly $50. Which is not something we&#039;d make a habit of- for a few dollars more, we could&#039;ve had a full-blown meal. But the atmosphere, given all its hipsterness, was definitely welcoming and chill. At least mid-week.

				The chorizo was nice, spicy. It had a bit of sauerkraut and mustard on the baguette- maybe some cheese, I forget. I try to eat vegetarian for the most part which is the only reason I didn&#039;t order it, or the sandwich with speck and cheese. <br /><br />My grilled cheese used......manouria???

				Manouri.&nbsp; It&#039;s a Greek cheese, similar to ricotta, but a bit creamier and with more of a tang, I think because it&#039;s made with sheep or goat&#039;s milk rather than cow milk.
