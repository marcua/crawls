				Finally, another bookstore in Astoria!&nbsp; A used bookstore opened on 34th Ave between 42md &amp; 43rd Streets.&nbsp; It is small and has an interesting mix of books.&nbsp; Terrific for browsing.&nbsp;

				Seaburn books, they recently reorganized their downstairs used books (!!!!)<br /><br />Also, does the new bookstore have a name?<br /><br />BTW, the thrift shop on Steinway between 25 and 28 (next to the boutique on the West side of the Street) has a fair mix of unorganized used books.&nbsp; The books are all the way in the back.<br />

				I think it&#039;s this<br />http://www.woodsidebooks.com/<br />I swung by today but they were closed.&nbsp; Their web page is a bit puzzling, who are their &quot;sponsors&quot;?&nbsp; The wording of the website makes me think scam or cult, but I could be wrong<br />

				That website is definitely strange.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />1.&nbsp; There should be a period or hyphen between here and we.<br />2.&nbsp; The next sentence is short and choppy.<br />3.&nbsp; The sentence after that uses &quot;benefit&quot; twice - the first one could be eliminated for better structure.<br />4.&nbsp; I believe the word &quot;schools&quot; in the next sentence should be singular.<br />5.&nbsp; &quot;All books we received at the end&quot; - just plain huh?<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m not even an English teacher or an editor, and their grammatical errors leap out at me.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />If you shop there, definitely pay cash and get a receipt.&nbsp; For the sake of the neighborhood, someone should check with their benefactors (click &quot;New Events&quot;) what the actual affiliation is.

				I think whoever wrote the copy on that page just isn&#039;t a native English speaker. Though wrapping up that paragraph with<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: x-large;" class="bbc_size">We do our best to help promote literacy .</span></span><br /><br /><br />is a bit much. You&#039;d think someone with such lofty goals, knowing they&#039;re representing their business, could find someone to proofread.

				I&#039;m not saying they are a bad store....but that has to be one of the most amateurish websites I have ever seen.

				It&#039;s pretty ironic that people have been complaining about the lack of local brick and mortar bookstores and now that one has opened, people are complaining about it&#039;s website...
