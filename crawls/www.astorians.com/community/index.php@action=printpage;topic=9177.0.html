				I&#039;m wondering how it all works in Astoria.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;m a recent college grad and I rent a room on Broadway &amp; 33rd.&nbsp; My rent is extremely low for the size, condition, and location, but my roomates and I pay for most upkeep. <br />I have never met our landlord, who owns the building.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				When I lived in Manhattan, I always lived in buildings with management companies and I have no idea who actually owned the buildings. I dealt with a super for repairs or the management company for lease issues. <br /><br />Now I live in a private house with my landlords downstairs. I MUCH prefer an absentee landlord. While for the most part, mine have been fine, there&#039;s still a level of involvement I don&#039;t like. They&#039;ve asked several times to come up and &quot;fix&quot; things that I didn&#039;t think were broken (a drawer they said they meant to fix before we moved in, which I never noticed there was a problem with; replacing a towel rod that was just fine in my opinion; stuff like that). They&#039;ve also been on our balcony several times when we weren&#039;t home and rearranged the furniture each time, and I really don&#039;t believe they climbed a ladder to get there, which means that they went through the apartment. I can hear snoring from their bedroom at night, which means they can hear noises from MY room, and I&#039;ve seen them peeking through the blinds when I come home late at night. Now, some of this might happen with just nosy neighbors, but at least in that situation, the nosy neighbors aren&#039;t also getting a big wad of money from me every month. I feel like it&#039;s too close for comfort. <br /><br />The next place I move to, I will only take if the landlords are offsite.

				I second the motion. I live in an apartment and our landlord lives in Connecticut. He comes around once a month unless there is a problem, and that&#039;s the way I like it. I have heard *way* too many bad stories about living in the same building with a landlord, and I think it&#039;s highly preferable to avoid that situation if at all possible.

				I live in a multi-unit building owned by my family, and as the family lawyer, some view me as the de-facto landlord, or worse, the landlord&#039;s lawyer.<br />Yes, it sucks if your landlord is a nosy person, or wishes to pass judgment on your personal life, or makes up random reasons to enter your premises (Especially when their lives are so empty that they have nothing better to do than snoop). I&#039;m basically pro-tenant, and would not support that type of activity.<br />I think my neighbors benefit from my presence in that if something is broken or needs attention, I can&#039;t (nor would I wish to ) ignore them.<br />Our building looks nice and is safe because I live here and that matters to me! The building two doors down is owned by an absentee and looks very run down.<br />The downside- I wish my neighbors didn&#039;t know of my relationship to the owner (a conundrum).<br />I not always sure if a neighbor is being nice because they feel compromised. I once made friends with a tenant who subsequently screwed me based on private things I said to her.<br />It&#039;s a fine line.<br />My advice: <br />Unless you are into having your privacy invaded, do not live in a landlord occupied building with less than three or four units. <br />Some of the landlords who have been here the longest are usually the most invasive- they feel entitled, and miss the days when their tenants didn&#039;t know they had [http://home2.nyc.gov/html/housinginfo/html/tenants_rights/tenants_rights.shtml]<strong>rights</strong>.<br />Start a blog so you may communicate with the other tenants in the building you occupy- this can be phenomenally useful in figuring out if your landlord is a jerk, or is just having a very bad day. Lock the landlord out of the blog by making it accessible to invited guests only.<br />Ask the landlord if they have ever been a tenant! My experience as a tenant directly informs my understanding of my (and my neighbors&#039;) situation.<br />Ask the landlord if they work from home- especially if your unit is close by.<br />Google the management company or owner.<br />Responsible stewards (I HATE the word &quot;Landlord&quot;) are usually concerned (sometimes we lose a lot of sleep about it) with the rights of the tenants- this means unless you reach out to us and let us know you want to be friendly, we are going to pretend we don&#039;t know you outside the building. I don&#039;t see this as rude, I see it as allowing the person in the more compromised position to make that call.<br />Some of the occupants in the building walk by me without a look my way. I generally take that as a cue to leave them be. Some are super nice and even send postcards and party invites!!<br />I&#039;m a person too...<br /><br />

				my landlord lives about 10 blocks away and keeps a workshop in our basement (3 family).&nbsp; Our building is beautifully maintained and the landlord is more than happy to help out with pretty much anything we want fixed or worked on.&nbsp; I think we&#039;re going to get some more kitchen cabinets this month.&nbsp; <br /><br />Our next door neighbor lives in Greece.&nbsp; His building is a shite-hole.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t seen the inside - but the outside (front and back) is in horrific condition.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t get shoveled.&nbsp; The front stoop is cracked and falling apart - it&#039;s an eyesore.&nbsp; YUCK.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure our neighbors rents are lower than ours.&nbsp; But i&#039;m sure we&#039;re living in a much nicer space.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				My landlady (and her husband) live about 2 miles away (I&#039;m near Ditmars, they&#039;re near 30th Ave.). I live in a small, 4-unit building, definitely not a big, corporation owned type place. I think they just own this building and the 2-family house they live in. I love it because they&#039;re close enough and responsive when there&#039;s a problem, but not so close that they&#039;re all up in my business.<br /><br />I actually saw them last week in the stairwell because they had to stop by another unit to check something that one of my neighbors called about, and it was a very &quot;hey! Nice to see you, how&#039;s it going?&quot; surprise encounter. We had a little chat, and I was on my way. I pay my rent on time every month, they fix the roof when it leaks (I&#039;m on the top floor, and my bed is where a fireplace used to be, so it happens about once a year), everyone&#039;s happy.<br /><br />In my opinion, absentee = good if there&#039;s a super or they&#039;re close by.

				I live in a family home (I live upstairs and my landlord and his family live down stairs).&nbsp; He has always been very considerate of our space.&nbsp; Even when he has to talk to us he stays downstairs or asks if he could come up.&nbsp; The only time he has come up without us here is when our new bathroom cabinet was delivered and he had the guys put it inside our door.&nbsp; Even more of a bonus since his children are around my age range he treats me like part of the family.&nbsp; Any special events he will send in invite.&nbsp; And on our birthdays he will even come do a shot with us to celebrate.&nbsp; In exchange most repairs that need to be done I do my best to do myself.&nbsp; I figure the less often I need to call for his help the more he will be willing to give it.&nbsp; <br />I had an absentee land lord when I had lived in Vermont.&nbsp; Let me tell you that our hot water heating pipes burst and it took him at least four months to figure out how to repair them.&nbsp; Living in a house with no heat in the middle of Vermont&#039;s winter is not something I would ever like to repeat.<br />I guess I sum it up by saying that a close by land lord can be a good thing but as always it depends on the person your land lord is.&nbsp; Always try to talk to other tenets about their experiences before making and decisions.&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:

				I totally agree with Allison. We live near Ditmars, too, and our landlords are in LI...but they keep the basement apt in our building for them, for when they&#039;re visiting family in the area and don&#039;t want to drive home late at night.&nbsp; They are the NICEST freaking people, ever. They got us a housewarming sausage and some cheese with a loaf of Italian bread (they&#039;re Italian, so is my fiance), they got us an Easter goodie for our pup, and every time we went by to drop off boxes, they were there fixing things.&nbsp; They told us that they didn&#039;t want or need copies of keys, that they&#039;d never bother us and to just call them if there was anything ever wrong and they&#039;d come right over.&nbsp; It&#039;s comforting to have them nearby enough that they could hop in the truck and come fix something, but it&#039;s also cool that they have their own house, their own stuff to do, and their own lives.&nbsp; The husband actually grew up in that house, so he has a very strong personal attachment to its care and wants the people living there to love it, and that makes all the difference.<br /><br />Versus the hell in Washington Heights/Inwood that we came from, where the super was a 75 yr old woman and her spinster daughters, who were all not only lazy, but whiney about having to do stuff like take out the trash (&#039;Who but so much garbage in this garbage can?&#039;) and nasty.&nbsp; The one daughter was a nice lady and I felt bad for her being stuck with that family, but her sister....WOW.&nbsp; I seriously wonder if she had mental issues, because I have never seen anyone so rude and hostile in my life.&nbsp; And I&#039;ve BEEN to the DMV!<br /><br />The owners weren&#039;t much better; the wiring in our apt shorted and the managing agent told us that it &quot;wasn&#039;t an emergency&quot; and he would get an electrician in there &quot;when he could&quot;...and then went on vacation.<br /><br />We were without light in most of our apt (save the kitchen) for a whole week.&nbsp; And it was downhill from there.&nbsp; Court, letters, calls to the City, the whole 9 yards.<br /><br />All I can say is THANK GOODNESS FOR PRESENT LANDLORDS WHO CARE (but not enough to check on what time you come home).
