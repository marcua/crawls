			Freeze Peach is starting a storytelling and reading group. If you're interested in telling or reading a short story (under 5 minutes) please join this group.<br /><br />We're recording the stories to be archived and put on a website for kids. The idea is that anyone can go to the site and listen to a story over streaming audio.<br /><br />The group meets weekly, on Wednesday afternoons at 3:00PM in the Freeze Peach cafe located at 22-00 29th St. in Astoria.
