				My wife and I went there tonight to try it out.&nbsp; It was a fun place, with good food, good wine, and an awesome dessert.<br /><br />The place is cozy with exposed brick walls, art and photos on the wall, and wine bottles on high shelves.&nbsp; The staff was friendly, funny, and honest.&nbsp; <br /><br />The menu spoke of Italian cuisine and local markets, combining orrechietta, kale, and sausage in plain wonderfulness.&nbsp; I had a striped bass over couscous that was pretty good.<br /><br />I recommend their Fennel Orange salad.&nbsp; Tasty and healthy as an appetizer.&nbsp; <br /><br />BUT, the cherry on top was the dessert.&nbsp; Joe, who seemed to be the head honcho, recommended a toffee cake which he called the Baby Jesus.&nbsp; He said it was a homemade cake that received a &quot;Baby Jesus!&quot; exclamation the first time someone tried it.&nbsp; We had it and it lived up to its name.&nbsp; We heard somebody at a nearby table describe it as Jesus in your mouth.&nbsp; It had the atheists proclaiming the holiness of Jesus.&nbsp; It was that good.<br /><br />I think y&#039;all should check it out.&nbsp; It seems like a nice place, with friendly folks running it.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking forward to going back there.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh, and the wine was good too!

				This place also got a pretty good review on Chowhound (http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/565671#4113002). I walked past yesterday evening, and it looks very pleasant. Prices seemed quite inexpensive for a creative Italian place...

				We went on Friday night, knowing they had just opened.&nbsp; Frankly, we didn&#039;t expect a large crowd.&nbsp; Although 21st Street undergoing a pretty big transformation, it&#039;s still off the beaten path for some.&nbsp; However, with this place being only 2 store fronts from the very successful Club 21, it gets more attention.&nbsp; We walked in on Friday night to a surprisingly large crowd.&nbsp; Nearly every table and every seat at the bar were taken. Really great atmosphere.&nbsp; Very friendly people - owners and the customers there that night.&nbsp; As others just said, they have a great wine list by the bottle or the glass.&nbsp; We ordered a bottle of chianti that we didn&#039;t care for.&nbsp; Way too young.&nbsp; But no harm, they turned it into a bottle to be used for glass orders and we got a different bottle.&nbsp; We wound up ordering a pizza and staying quite a while.&nbsp; The pizza was so tasty that we decided to go back again yesterday.&nbsp; And this time we also got the striped bass dinners.&nbsp; The fish was cooked perfectly.&nbsp; Delicious.&nbsp; Another minute and it would might have been dry.&nbsp; The fresh mint cous cous was light and tasty.&nbsp; A nice compliment to the bass.&nbsp; I highly recommend the side order of sauteed kale with garlic.&nbsp; Just the right amount of oil, garlic and salt to make it delicious.&nbsp; The roasted parmesan brussels sprouts were also very good.&nbsp; We also had the baby jesus cake both times.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t that impressed with it on Friday but I thought I better try again on Sunday when I didn&#039;t have an large quantity of wine prior.&nbsp; Frankly, I didn&#039;t like it much better.&nbsp; But I&#039;m really not a cake guy.&nbsp; But I can&#039;t help but think that it&#039;s zapped the microwave for 30 seconds.&nbsp; It has that odd hot center and funny texture.&nbsp; But the taste is very good.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather have another Margherita pizza than that cake.&nbsp; They make the pizza on a stone and the crust is so thin and Delicious.&nbsp; &nbsp;You only get four slices out of it.&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s too small or a rip off.&nbsp; But I&#039;m a big eater and I can easily eat about 10 of them when it&#039;s that thin crust, feather light pizza.&nbsp; I think the prices are reasonable.&nbsp; That&#039;s a very subjective thing.&nbsp; I think the pizza might be 8 or 9$ and the striped bass entrees may have been in the 18$ range.&nbsp; For the quality of the food and the experience, I think the prices are very fair.&nbsp; Mangopaco, I think we saw you there.&nbsp; Your description indicates comments that we both made and heard ourselves!&nbsp; This location is convenient for us.&nbsp; And like with Club 21, we&#039;re thrilled that there are finally some great places opening up on 21st!

				I&#039;m glad someone started this, I kept thinking the name was Vespa, as in scooters.<br /><br />Stopped in last Wednesday before the debate with a friend who lives right on that block.&nbsp; The owners were very friendly and let us try a few different wines before we settled on one we really liked and then asked us try (on the house&nbsp; :mrgreen:) two appetizers that they were experimenting with.&nbsp; One was a ricotta cheese dip the other was a garlic bean dip, both fantastic.&nbsp; We didn&#039;t have time to order entrees but the orders coming out around us looked and smelled delicious.&nbsp;

				My boyfriend and I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this neighborhood trattoria, and let me say, we were not disappointed. We have been twice in the last week and a half, and I look forward to another visit this weekend. We would like to think of it as our &quot;Cheers&quot;-it really does have that neighborhoody-where everyone knows your name-feel.&nbsp; The owner and staff are very friendly and accommodating, and the food speaks for itself. We have had the pizza every time. Thin and crispy crust, not overloaded with cheese-fabulous!!! And all I have to say is thank goodness for some &quot;little baby jesus&quot; in our Astoria hood. We always went to Schiller&#039;s on the Lower East Side to indulge in their toffee cake.&nbsp; But now we won&#039;t have to make the trip.&nbsp; I actually think that Vesta&#039;s is better. <br />Just order it for dessert. You will thank me. And Jesus. A perfect addition to the neighborhood.

				Was so excited for a new place to come to the neighborhood... and finally checked it out ...also on two occasions last week.&nbsp; I went once with a larger group of six, then went again on Friday with a friend and sat at the bar for dinner.&nbsp; Both times were really fantastic.&nbsp; <br /><br />The bartender was super-knowledgable, friendly, was interested in finding a wine that we would love.&nbsp; On Friday I tried two whites, and ended up deciding on the Pinot Toi. It&#039;s one of these places that invite you to have a taste with one of their &#039;shots&#039; then move onto a glass or bottle once you&#039;ve made a decision.&nbsp; Great concept.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The wine list isn&#039;t your typical Italian list and the food isn&#039;t typical Italian either.&nbsp; I loved the striped bass and lemony cous cous (cooked amazingly), the lasagna is awesome (comes in a personal baking dish, the sauce is delicious and meaty), the pizza is also great (super, super-thin crust), the steak was cooked perfectly, and the brussels sprouts are my favorite.&nbsp; A couple of misses were the chicken, which was okay, but paled in comparison to the other entrees I tried, and an olive oil cake that was on the menu the first time I went, then off when I went again.&nbsp; Was kind of dry...and next to the Jesus cake was a miss.&nbsp; Jesus cake is ridiculously good.<br /><br />Will absolutely be back - I really love the vibe.&nbsp;

				I checked out Vesta last night with a friend of mine.&nbsp; We both thought the place was great.&nbsp; I had a soup special to start (pumpkin/butter nut squash I believe, with roasted pumpkin seeds) that was delicious.&nbsp; I had the lasagna as my main dish which was also very good.&nbsp; &nbsp;My friend had the Salumi Plate to start and Orecchiette Pasta and was very pleased with both dishes.&nbsp; We had a bottle of an Italian Chardonnay which was quite good.&nbsp; To cap off the meal my friend ordered the sweet baby jesus dessert which nearly brought her to orgasm.&nbsp; I only had room for one bite and I think my exact words were, &quot;that is sick&quot;.&nbsp; Very yummy indeed.<br /><br />The wait staff was very good and the owners were very warm and inviting.&nbsp; I would recommend the place.

				AJ neglected to mention that the owner brought us a complementary side dish of creamy polenta that changed my life. CHANGED MY LIFE. If you like cheese, butter and polenta, run don&#039;t walk. I wanted Port after dinner and they didn&#039;t have any but he said if I came back he would have it. Nice touch.

				I went there with a date and it was excellent, I highly recommend it.<br /><br />My only complaint is they didn&#039;t cut the bread enough and the crust was hard. Otherwise, excellent. I had the steak and my date had the striped bass. We tried the baby jesus cake and it was delicious.

We ended up sharing the soup, which was good.<br /><br />I&#039;m glad to have them in the &#039;hood as one of the things I missed most about my last apartment was Crescent &amp; Vine.

				Another thumbs up for Vesta! Went there last night, party of four. Great ambiance and service. (Except for forgetting a pizza order, which they quickly turned around. It was worth the wait, and they comped us a glass of chianti...!) We had: squash soup-of-the-day, bread soup, asparagus, olives, fennel and orange salad, lasagna, pizza, the Baby Jesus cake, and some biscotti. The bread soup and olives were good; everything else was great. Great crust on the pizza. Perfect dressing on the salad. I don&#039;t want think about how far that asparagus flew first class to get to us in November, but it would have been excellent in May. Also, they&#039;re starting Brunch (weekends) and Lunch (weekdays) starting this week. Highly recommended!

				Leonardo, I also had the pleasure of having a meal at Vesta this weekend.&nbsp; I just loved it!&nbsp; That winter squash soup is fantastic, and the asparagus was really delicious.&nbsp; I also loved the lasagna, and the Baby Jesus cake was also wonderful (as were the biscotti, yum).&nbsp; David, our server that night, recommended a really nice wine, too (the name of which I forget but it was in the first level of wines - next time I&#039;ll try the Primitivo).&nbsp; I actually look forward to many great meals there - thank you for such great work!

				Just got back from our first meal there.&nbsp; :mrgreen:&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />Truly impressive. What a restaurant should be: Casually elegant. Elegantly casual. Borderline bistro. I didn&#039;t feel like I was being rushed, upsold, or bamboozled. Had the chicken w/kale and &quot;life-changing&quot; polenta (normally I don&#039;t eat chicken, but made an exception since it was a FreeBird(tm) but will go vegetarian from now on); BF had the pasta w/homemade sausage. Each had a glass of the waiter&#039;s favorite red (from the cheaper options) and it was great. Appetizer was fried Brussels sprouts (mmm) and fennel salad w/oranges.<br /><br />Of course, Baby Jesus for dessert, and BF said it looked exactly &quot;like a meatloaf.&quot; But tasted heavenly&nbsp; :lol:<br /><br />Indeed a great place. <em>Not</em> cheap (I think the bistro-like setting lulls people into complacency, &quot;ah it&#039;s not fancy so it&#039;s not expensive!&quot;) but reasonable.

				We went last night. It certainly was hopping, for a Wednesday. Congrats to the owners. <br /><br />I don&#039;t have much to add to what&#039;s been said by others. Nobody else mentioned trying the calamari - it&#039;s very good: light batter - almost tempura-ish - and uniformly very tender. I had the lasagna - nice variety of flavors, and very cute in it&#039;s individual pan. The gf had the orecchiette &amp; sausage which she found good, but not outstanding. The low-price-range glass of Merlot was very good. The Baby Jesus cake was way sweet for my taste - (a rum soaked variant would be a great thing.)<br /><br />I think Manetta&#039;s in LIC will remain our regular place for this sort of food: similar prices and quality, large enough portions to take some home for another meal. But I&#039;ll be back to this place for the cozy intimacy, friendly staff, and the proximity to home. (And life-changing polenta: I forgot to ask for that.)<br /><br />Next time, I hope that one of the grown-up tables will be available. I didn&#039;t find the high-chair very comfortable.<br />

				Christine - we must have just missed you; we got there shortly before 8:30 tonight.<br /><br />It was a very nice meal.&nbsp; I had the squash soup and the lasagna, choices I based on reading through this thread a couple of times.&nbsp; The squash soup was a little too sweet for my taste, but otherwise had a very nice balance of flavours.&nbsp; The lasagna was a deceptively large portion - I brought part of it home with me.&nbsp; It was a hearty dish that had very tender noodles in the middle and nice crispy edges, and overall good flavour.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been on the hunt for a lasagna as good as a mind-blowing one I tasted in southern Switzerland nearly 20 years ago, and this was one of the closer ones.&nbsp; The individual pan was a nice touch, but I was surprised that it was lined with a non-stick, Teflon-like coating.&nbsp; I had a taste of the polenta, and it was delicious and cheesy.<br /><br />The Baby Jesus cake was achingly sweet but otherwise tasty.&nbsp; Normally it would be way too sweet for me, but I did enjoy my share until I developed a real sugar buzz and had to stop eating it.&nbsp; It was served with a dollop of unsweetened whipped cream on the side, which helped cut the sweetness a little.&nbsp; We decided that the cake itself is a very mild spice cake, and the taste and texture of the cake itself was reminiscent of warm chocolate chip cookie dough without the chips.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to go back and try a couple of other things on the menu.

				We tried Vest last night for dinner. Very nice!<br /><br />We arrived a little before six. There were a couple of other tables occupied and a nice<br />atmosphere. We were seated right away and given menus, water, etc.<br /><br />I had the cracked wheat salad and the roasted chicken. Both delicious. Chicken wasn&#039;t hot<br />enough, but they were great about taking it back and it was perfect on the second try. <br /><br />Boyfriend had calamari and lasagne. He loved both. He&#039;s a calamari connoisseur and he<br />ranks this up there with Mojave - theirs is great. His lasagne was piping hot and looked/tasted<br />homemade. He&#039;s pretty picky and gave it two thumbs up. <br /><br />Only drawback - no Corona on their beer menu and then they were out of Heineken. <br />He went with Amstel light and that was fine. I had Pinot Grigio which was great.<br /><br />Overall - very nice place with good food and a friendly feel to it. We&#039;ve already decided to try <br />stopping in for a drink after work. The bar looks comfortable and it&#039;s so close to both our homes.<br /><br />Hope it works for them in this economic climate.<br /><br />

				After reading all of the great reviews here, I decided to take my bf to Vesta last night for his birthday. And I have to say, the meal definitely lived up to (if not exceeded) all of the hype. &nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br />We started off with the dish of olives &amp; caper berries. Then he had the cracked wheat salad, I had the fennel &amp; orange salad. Both salads were great (and the portions were a bit more generous than I was expecting, which was nice). The only thing that perplexed me was that I couldn&#039;t detect any fennel in my salad (it has a pretty distinct flavor). When I asked about it, I was told that the fennel was &quot;shaved very thin&quot;, but for the life of me I couldn&#039;t taste it. But it was a very good salad anyway.<br /><br />For entrees, my bf had the gnocchi with mushroom cream sauce, and I had the salmon with lentils and prune reduction. WOW-- both were fantastic. The gnocchi was tender and fluffy, the mushroom sauce very mushroom-y, and it had some toasted pine nuts on top which gave it a nice texture. The salmon was cooked <em>perfectly</em>-- tender, with a nice crispy crust around the edges. The sweetness of the prune sauce balanced nicely with the lentils. For sides, we got the grilled asparagus and creamy polenta-- both <em>very</em> nice. With all of these great dishes around me on the table, I couldn&#039;t decide where to stick my fork :)<br /><br />Then of course, we had to get the jesus cake... and oh. my. god. YUM. I&#039;ve never had a dessert quite like it. It was kind of like a spice cake, but not overly spiced. Nice toffee flavor. The cream on the side was perfect-- not overly sweet, which was a nice balance with the sweet toffee sauce. The cake was moist and warm, and had a nice little crust on top. Had a cappuccino too, which was really good.<br /><br />Also, nice wine list, and I dig the &quot;shot&quot; option... you can order by the bottle, glass, or &quot;shot&quot; (a 2 oz. portion for about half the price of a glass). I often can&#039;t drink 2 full glasses of wine, so I love that I have the option to have just a little more, without having to buy a second full glass that I know I won&#039;t finish. Or, if you want to taste a bunch of different wines, that gives you a good option. Maybe Vesta should look into introducing flights?<br /><br />Very happy to have this place in the neighborhood. We will definitely be back!<br />

				I actually got Jesus cake to go last time and they packaged the cake &amp; sauce separately.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t ask for it that way, it&#039;s just what they did.&nbsp; But it was brilliant because...<br /><br />1) allowed me to warm the sauce only, not the cake<br />2) I&#039;m not a huge sweet tooth<br />3) pinched off pieces of the cake &amp; dipped each in just a bit of sauce<br />4) was like a little fondue all for me! :-o<br /><br />I haven&#039;t mentioned this to Joe yet, but will next time we go.&nbsp; I think it would be great to do some sort of Moses/Jesus Fondue twist with the cake and maybe some apple and/or asian pear chunks to go along with it?!&nbsp; Also wouldn&#039;t take as long to service the order this way...&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Went back there tonight and noticed the changed the menu a little. By chance, ran into friends there so we made it a group dinner.<br /><br />We had the butternut squash soup.&nbsp; It was delicious!&nbsp; It&#039;s Butternut squash, with pumpkin seeds, cinnamon, and light cream. My wife described it as Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas all rolled into one.&nbsp; <br /><br />I had the Free Bird Chicken.&nbsp; It was juicy and tender.&nbsp; The polenta was really good too.&nbsp; My wife had the salmon.&nbsp; I forget what the dish was exactly but it was pretty good.&nbsp; <br /><br />The waiter did an excellent job picking out the wine to match our meals.&nbsp; <br /><br />If they keep changing the menu we&#039;re going to be spending way too much money going back and trying it all.

				Thank you, I will be greatly looking forward to dining at Vesta again for this upcoming thanksgiving as well.<br /><br />Last night was my second time being there, brought along some friends for their first time.&nbsp; Just as I expected, we all had a wonderful evening.&nbsp; The atmosphere was very cute and relaxing, great wines and the food was the best part of all.<br /><br />One of my friends&#039; entree came out a little late from the rest, however, our waiter was so considerate, concerned and friendly that it was not an issue at all.<br /><br />At the conclusion of our dessert and coffees we all normally would have left, yet we all felt so comfortable and were having such a good time that we ended up having a few more shot glasses of wine.<br /><br />So happy there&#039;s a place like this in the neighborhood now!&nbsp; Can&#039;t wait to go back!<br /><br />Cris

				<br />Last Tuesday night a group of five of us went for dinner to Vesta - a couple of friends made the trek from Long Island City - it was all of our first time.&nbsp; We were all so pleased with the meal and overall experience and we&#039;ll definitely be back.<br /><br />We ordered a margherita pizza, cheese plate and fennel and orange salad to start.&nbsp; The pizza was cooked perfectly and we should have ordered another one for our table of five!&nbsp; The manchego was great with the fig spread and the fennel (my favorite thing to put in salad) was light and fresh and dressed perfectly.&nbsp; We had a bunch of different things for dinner and passed our plates around to taste - the favorites were the steak, salmon (the prune reduction with lentils was awesome!), and chicken with polenta.&nbsp; Polenta is out of control good.&nbsp; &nbsp;The only critique we had was for the linguini with breadcrumbs which was a little dry, but we asked for more olive oil an all was good.&nbsp; <br /><br />We were so happy with our wine selection that we ended up ordering four bottles - Aglianco - and didn&#039;t get to try anything else.&nbsp; But we&#039;ll definitely be back - especially since I just moved into the neighborhood.&nbsp; Looking forward to sitting at the bar for dinner, which seemed like the place to be the other night.&nbsp;

				Finally went here on Friday night after reading all the great reviews and I was very impressed. I ordered the free bird chicken which was an odd choice for me...I never order chicken out, but I am really glad I did. I kid you not, it was the best chicken I&#039;ve ever had! After the first bite I had a huge smile on my face. The polenta was amazing, as was the crispy carmelized asparagus. Had a glass of cabernet sauvignon which was fantastic as well. Great service, atmosphere, and vibe. Really happy to have this place in the hood!

				My gf had a similar reaction to the chicken one evening last week. (She said I shouldn&#039;t pay for it though, since the menu said &quot;free bird&quot;.) I had ribollita (Tuscan bread soup) and the gnocchi - I will be having both again sometime.

				So I finally tried Vesta last night and I have to echo the sentiments of others in the thread.&nbsp; I loved it.&nbsp; The lasagna was fantastic and the waiter recommended a great wine to go along with it.&nbsp; And the baby Jesus cake - my friend and I were still talking about it hours later. :)&nbsp; I&#039;m so happy to find a place like this in my neighborhood.&nbsp; I&#039;m already thinking about when I&#039;ll be back!

				I have gone to this restaurant now 5 times in the last 2 months. I have always had a wonderful dining experience. The menu selection is perfect as is the quality and preparation of the food. In addition, the wine selection is very nice and quite reasonable. The service is spectacular!! The owners clearly took time to do things right - everything from the food to the decor to the service is well thought out. I think any Astorian interested in having a really good meal and a lovely evening out, should try it. Oh, importantly, the prices are very reasonable.

				<br />another cool thing about Vesta is the &quot;shots&quot; of wine they offer. it&#039;s more like a half glass of wine then a &quot;shot&quot;. it&#039;s a great way to try out some wines that you&#039;re not too sure about. also, the service is top notch!

				I took yesterday off and we went in on a whim for lunch. Every time I go there, I&#039;m surprised at how good it is. The pizze was amazing. We had soups, pizze, two glasses of wine each and espresso and it came out to a little over $50. <br /><br />The owners are great and are clearly interested in establishing Vesta as a neighborhood spot. There were pretty many people there at 12:30 on a Tuesday, so I hope that they&#039;re doing well. Even the lady doing the school crossing guard outside on the corner was raving about their food!

				I&#039;ve been meaning to post about a Holiday Party the staff from my school had there last week:<br /><br />Joe and the staff of Vesta did an amazing job taking care of us!<br /><br />On that dark, cold, rainy night last Thursday, Vesta made us feel warm and at home.&nbsp; They fed us great stuff and we drank lots of wine - at least I did.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the evening is sort of a blur now so I can&#039;t give specific reviews about much:<br />- there was a meat and cheese appetizer that was awesome with the Grand Tuscan wine.<br />- There was a dessert that tasted like a fruity flan, delicious!<br />- Everyone loved the Baby Jesus cake, of course.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure it&#039;s not easy to deal with about 20 public school teachers and staff after a hard day (and a couple of glasses of wine), but the Vesta staff did awesome.&nbsp; Some of our staff ordered food to take home to their loved ones - the pizza was a favorite - and keep talking to me about going back.<br /><br />On a similar note, my coworkers keep asking me to bring in Baby Jesus Cake - Does Vesta do bulk orders?<br /><br />I highly recommend Vesta as a place to hold a holiday dinner or birthday celebration for groups of 20-30, it was fun and delicious.

				I have the worst luck.&nbsp; I went on an off night or something.&nbsp; The service wasn&#039;t the greatest in that our meals took a really really long time to come out, and when it did, my lasagna was burnt.&nbsp; The polenta was delicious but is listed as an appetizer - it should be considered a side dish as it comes out with the regular meal.&nbsp; <br /><br />So disappointed :(&nbsp; But so willing to go back and give it another chance.&nbsp; I have to say that Baby Jesus cake was amazing.&nbsp; And I do like the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant.

				It does have that housey feel.&nbsp; I still think the polenta is a side dish though.&nbsp; It&#039;s a heaping bowl of polenta, meant to go on the side of your plate.&nbsp; So it was served correctly, just listed wrong on the menu, and that threw me off, making me think the polenta would be perhaps a different take on polenta.&nbsp; It took about an hour or so for the food to arrive, and when you&#039;re hungry, that&#039;s a bit long to wait.&nbsp; And then my lasagna came burnt.&nbsp; I was so hungry I didn&#039;t want to complain and wait for a whole new dish while all my friends sat there eating.&nbsp; Does it always take that long?&nbsp; Has that been other people&#039;s experience?&nbsp; I like to take my time too but I find that long and if you don&#039;t know that ahead of time, and don&#039;t order an appetizer (which I hope would come out sooner than an hour), you sit and wait a good while.<br /><br />With all the good compliments here, I&#039;m thinking I just went on an off-night.

				Daisy, we&#039;ve gone many times and never had an experience even close to what you described.&nbsp; An hour wait would have stuck out in my mind as I would have been pretty upset.&nbsp; I think Monday is the worst day to try a restaurant.&nbsp; Not that any of this is your fault.&nbsp; But they should probably close on Monday, like other places - so they get a rest.&nbsp; They were probably exhausted from the weekend.&nbsp; We&#039;ve stopped in on Friday and Saturday nights after being out at other places and it has a surprisingly active bar scene that goes late.&nbsp; Which I think is a good thing.&nbsp; Maybe you can go back Wed - Sun and see what happens.&nbsp; We also order a lot of food - always a Margherita pizza as an appetizer - plus other things before our main dish.&nbsp; So if the entree took an hour, we wouldn&#039;t have noticed.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think they assemble and bake the lasagna to order.&nbsp; So if you skip other courses and wait for the lasagna, it could be a while.&nbsp; I think it was more the Monday thing.

				Hello Daisy,<br /><br />I am sorry you had that experience, waiting that long. The Lasagna generally takes around 30 min to cook, it is cooked from scratch and I can see how monday night that could have become 40 or 50 min. I do appolgize and because of your advise have made some corrections on the menu with the polenta. It is more of a side :mrgreen:.. My name is Giuseppe and I am one of the owners along with Leo. Why dont you give us a call this evening let us know your name and Im sure we can make you happy.<br /><br />Giuseppe and Leonardo

				WOW. vesta&#039;s food was amazing. my friend Liz and I ate there tonight and everything we had was amazing, including several glasses and shots of wine. we had the cannelli bean crostini which was full of flavor and just the right amount of bread, the pizza with the goat cheese, apples, potatoes and whatnot was amazing. the brussel sprouts were roasted and seasoned beautifully, and oh boy, the baby jesus cake was spectacular. we also had the chocolate cake, admittedly not as good as baby jesus, but good. WOW. What a great new addition to the 30th ave neighborhood. <br />On thing did upset me though, every table around us was given wine bags with Vesto Vino wine glasses in them as a thank you for visiting, even tables that only had a glass of wine and an appetizer, and we were not. I was really upset by this, because there were several left when we left and we were not given one, kinda upsetting that they didnt care about our business, or maybe i am just being a spoiled brat, but we did look around and notice that every other patron in the restaurant was given one but us.... kinda made us feel like we were not appreciated as much as others. could it be that every other customer was a repeat customer and we were the only two trying it out for the first time??? maybe so if only some of the other tables had been given the gift, but everyone (not just every table, every one) had been given one but us... Hmmmmmmm... It was def. good food, great amazing atmosphere and i do plan to go back sometime, but maybe not as soon as we would if we were acknowledged as much as other patrons.

				MFells<br />my experience is if you dont ask you dont get<br />not getting a glass was probably just an oversite<br />next time you find yourself in a similar situation just ask the waiter whats in the bag<br />and dont be shy - ask wheres yours<br />the worst that could happen is you dont get one <br />the best is you get one and you make a friend/contact<br />just think how embaressed the owner would have been if he noticed you were the only one without a gift<br />you probably could have gotten a glass of wine out of the deal&nbsp; &nbsp; :-)

				My better half and I&nbsp; had dinner there on Sat. night. It was our second<br />visit and even better than the first. They were pretty busy even though<br />we got there at about 6:45. We got the next to last open table.<br /><br />Service was terrific even though, as I said, they were pretty packed.<br />I had the cracked wheat salad and the salmon - best salmon I&#039;ve ever had,<br />so delicious! He had their calamari and the lasagne which he said were<br />both terrific. <br /><br />We didn&#039;t get any wine glasses either, but I didn&#039;t see anyone getting them<br />on Sat. nite. But the meal was so relaxed, the atmosphere was buzzing and<br />it was just a nice outing. My birthday is in January and I&#039;ve already decided<br />that&#039;s where I want to go.

				Well, the Feast of the Seven Fishes dinner was a real winner.&nbsp; The lobster ravioli dish was awesome, and I hope they consider putting it on the menu full time.&nbsp; I also loved the cod &amp; potato spread, and the scallops with almond pesto entree.&nbsp; We were really stuffed by the end and had no room for dessert, but the owners actually comped us each a Baby Jesus cake, with little take-home containers of caramel sauce and whipped cream!&nbsp; That was such a sweet gesture and totally out of the blue.&nbsp; The atmosphere is really nice too.&nbsp; We&#039;ll definitely be back.

				Ate here last night - 4 people. Great food! The mussels were garlicy and very good and the coating on the calamarie is light and crunchy. We also shared lasagna and gnocchi.&nbsp; While the lasagna is good, the gnocchi is outstanding - light, fluffy pillows that melt in your mouth - the best ever.&nbsp; Also shared baby jesus cake and chocolate ice box? cake - both good but baby jesus better.&nbsp; Very good restaurant

				I went with 4 people to this lovely place a couple of weeks ago for brunch.&nbsp; Really nice people there, and it&#039;s true about the Baby Jesus cake!&nbsp; I ordered the polenta and egg dish, and both mine and at least one other person&#039;s at our table was kind of burnt tasting.&nbsp; He&#039;d had it before and loved it (which was why I ordered it), and was disappointed.<br /><br />I wasn&#039;t going to post about this, but read a page or so back about Daisy&#039;s burned lasagna.&nbsp; We didn&#039;t say anything, and I would also definitely try the place again...

				Vesta is my new favorite restaurant in Astoria.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s just wonderful!&nbsp; &nbsp;The space is welcoming, the staff friendly, and the food delicious.&nbsp; Last night their New Year&#039;s celebration dinner was also excellent.&nbsp; My friends and I had a blast!&nbsp; I thought I saw paratactical, but wasn&#039;t 100% sure it was her - I hope you had a good time!&nbsp; The food was great - I absolutely loved the short ribs, and the arancini were a big hit at our table.<br /><br />I had brunch there last week, too, and reviewed it for Joey in Astoria:<br /><br />http://astorianyc.blogspot.com/2008/12/vesta-trattoria.html<br /><br />I look forward to my next visit, and wish Vesta continued success in the neighborhood!

				Maybe I shouldn&#039;t judge them by a NYE event, but I am completely bowled over by Vesta.&nbsp; The food, the wine, the appearance, the warmth of the staff and the customer service were all breathtakingly good.&nbsp; (the company was great, too, but I can&#039;t give Vesta the credit for that.)&nbsp; Because it&#039;s tucked into such a residential area, I hope people make the effort to find it--but then again, maybe it&#039;ll become one of those places that the people in the immediate neighborhood will make their second home.&nbsp; I&#039;m really impressed and it was a great way to end a less-than-wonderful year on a good note.<br /><br />Sorry I didn&#039;t recognize you, paratactical, but I did see your lobster detritus and had a moment of envy...until I remembered how exquisite my striped bass had been.

				I&#039;m very happy to report that I started off the new year with a Saturday evening at Vesta - and being the only person on here with the negative review, I must come back and say they have totally redeemed themselves!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;Yay!!!&nbsp; Dinner was awesome.&nbsp; I had the mussels and the orecchiette pasta, while my friend had the butternut squash soup and the pasta with mushrooms.&nbsp; All were amazing (that soup is so tasty), and the staff were friendly and helpful.&nbsp; One of the owners sent over some fried brussel sprouts, which was so funny because all I could think of was how you when you are young, your parents always tell you to eat them and all you think is yuck.&nbsp; But damn, they were good!&nbsp; Parents should get the recipe!!&nbsp; I&#039;m glad to see they are doing well, tucked away in the boonies there.&nbsp; Looking forward to a return visit soon.

				Yes, I&#039;ve had better meals in my life &amp; in New York &amp; in Astoria, but I think the enthusiasm is coming from a different mentality - from the love of the neighborhood &amp; good food &amp; passionate service &amp; a need for a real community gem &amp; feeling that all these are in Astoria&#039;s grasp, but new establishments don&#039;t always manage to capture everything we want.&nbsp; Like sometimes things are still a little off in what are otherwise good restaurants - trying a little to hard to be Manhattan, cranking up the techno beats just a notch, overpricing cocktails, skimping on ambiance, inconsistent service, you know the drill.<br /><br />Vesta does a great job of being what a lot of us were looking for - a refreshing neighborhood joint that can turn out some pretty great food, wine, an overabundance of handshakes, of listening to the patrons&#039; comment on a message board, of promoting community.&nbsp; <br /><br />Rereading this sounds pretty hokey, but I can only say as a 5 year Astoria resident, I do get really excited about the few places I feel embody the spirit of our hood that often doesn&#039;t get translated into our dining establishments the way Vesta seems to be able to (I&#039;ll put Mundo, Seva, Il Bambino, Sparrow in this category as well).&nbsp; Not that the Greek cafes, a plethora of great other ethnic cuisines, kebab carts, taco trucks, seafood extravaganzas don&#039;t also represent the beautiful diversity of this place.&nbsp; I just find Vesta has a j&#039;nai se qua that I often seek.

				People are enthusiastic about this place, and it&#039;s packed every time I drive by, so folks clearly like what they see. I felt people were potentially going overboard, but the one time I went I was blown away by how good the food was and at the ambience. Everyone who worked there made me feel welcomed there, which is really a huge thing. How many times do you go to a very good restaurant and the staff seems to take you for granted? If Vesta continues to welcome people, accept feedback, and address the few concerns they&#039;ve had than I have no doubt that folks will continue to frequent this place and give it the business it deserves. Can&#039;t wait to go back on Friday!

				Went here last night and like nearly everyone on here, we agree with how wonderful the service and food was. :mrgreen:&nbsp; We could have gotten a better table but it was really busy last night and if we go on a not so crowded night, we prob will.&nbsp; We loved ordering our wines in shots and getting a chance to try several types.&nbsp; Each wine we tried was unique and smooth going well with every dish we ate.&nbsp; The Frito Misto was absolutely perfect.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t believe that the squid was so tender, not one chewy piece in the dish!&nbsp; The salmon dish was so delectable and went so well with the prune reduction.&nbsp; I&#039;m usually not a fan of salmon since most of the time you&#039;re served a thick slab of meat that ends up too dry but this was the best salmon dish I have ever had.&nbsp; Everything we had there was outstanding including the brussel sprouts, mushroom pasta dish and the Baby Jesus Cake.&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait to go back and this time I&#039;m ordering the salmon dish.&nbsp; I&#039;m already salivating while writing this post.

				My husband and I are in love with Vesta. It feels like you are over at a friend&#039;s house for dinner, but that friend cooks exceptionally well. The service is always fantastic. The last time we were there, my husband was uncertain of what wine he wanted to try and told our waiter what he typically drinks and asked for a recommendation. He did even better than that - he got shots of three different wines for my husband to try for free so he could be sure to get something he liked. I thought that was really above and beyond. I&#039;m now craving brunch - why isn&#039;t it the weekend already?!!!<br /><br />Ooh, and the new panna cotta is absolutely delicious. Even better than the clementine one, I think. It&#039;s strawberries and champagne with a kind of balsamic vinagrette on top. Soooo decadent. Oh, and the mint is still on top too. I love the mingling of flavors they do here - that crisp clean taste mingling with all those rich flavors is amazing.

				My fiance and I finally made it over there last Friday night.&nbsp; As most have said, it&#039;s a very cozy and warm venue and we were heartily greeted when we came in.&nbsp; We weren&#039;t too adventurous with a our food choices (we shared the Crispy Calamari &amp; garlic aioli dip which also came with some fried shrimp and fried zucchini - the zucchini was by far my favorite, and then I had the lasagna and he had the margarita pizza) but it was very good.&nbsp; And I also made room (mostly by taking half of lasagna home in a doggie bag) for the Baby Jesus Cake.&nbsp; I was wonderful!&nbsp; After my guy and I (okay, mostly me) scarfed it down, Joe came by and exaclaimed: &quot;You killed it!&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;d say we had a very good meal, but unfortunately our service was lacking a bit.&nbsp; Our waiter, a blond guy, often forgot about us and was very curt.&nbsp; Also, we waited for long stretches of time between courses.&nbsp; However, Joe made up for what our waiter was lacking by checking in on us a few times during our time there.&nbsp; Anyway, looking forward to going back.

				I just wanted to post further praise of Vesta!&nbsp; I made the decision to go there solo for lunch on my birthday yesterday and I definitely made the right decision.&nbsp; Having been there for dinner before, I knew my favorite wine to order, and even though the gnocchi were no longer on the menu, I went with an open mind to try other menu items I have not yet had.&nbsp; Since it was my birthday (and even though I was alone) I decided to splurge on 2 items -- their ricotta, mozzarella and pesto pizza and their new mushroom pasta dish.&nbsp; I was excited to try these both of these items to enjoy them fresh at lunch and then take half of them home with me as leftovers.&nbsp; Both were extremely delicious!!!&nbsp; <br /><br />The service for lunch was fantastic and so friendly!&nbsp; I did not feel uncomfortable dining alone and instead just had a fantastic lunch.&nbsp; They were so nice, that they brought me an infamous &quot;Baby Jesus cake&quot; as a b-day gift.&nbsp; I was so happy to try the much talked about dessert and it was amazing.&nbsp; I only wish I had more tummy room to eat more of it at the time.&nbsp; But I must say, I am quite happy to have leftovers of all of the delicious food to enjoy later.<br /><br />Thanks Vesta for making my birthday lunch extra special!&nbsp; :-) I look forward to more visits to Vesta!

				Had brunch there this past sunday and was afraid it might be packed but I think the slushy snow kept folks in bed longer. I will add to the chorus of praise on this loong thread. <br />We had <br />2 orders of the L’Italiano poached eggs; grilled Italian bread, hot sopressata &amp; ricotta cheese $6.95<br />and <br />1 of A Warm Bankie fried eggs with creamy polenta, asparagus, cremini mushrooms &amp; truffle oil $7.95<br /><br />delish, satisfying and all for 10 per person.<br /><br />The place was great, classic hip hop was playing overhead. At first I was like wha wha what?- - soo not brunchified mood music. <br />But then before I knew it, I was dusting off my old rap skills to some Wu Tang and erik b and rakimin between bites and successfully annoying and embarrassing my brunch mates.<br />Forgot to try the infant jebus cake. Oh well that means another visit is guaranteed.<br /><br /><br />

				Another good meal last night, this time with the family.&nbsp; I loved the roasted squash soup, and the bucatini with clams &amp; mussels has a great sauce.&nbsp; But service was really slow for a quiet, early Sunday evening.&nbsp; It was us and 2 tables of 2, and though a table of 8 (4 kids &amp; 4 adults) came in after we&#039;d ordered, that still doesn&#039;t really explain the long wait to get appetizers and an even longer wait for our entrees.&nbsp; But still, the food is very good, so I&#039;m hoping that this was an aberration.&nbsp;

				Sometimes I wonder if slow service in really good restaurants is just their way of saying, &quot;Take your time; we don&#039;t need to turn the table over.&quot; But then, the server should just say, &quot;Let me know when you&#039;re ready for the check,&quot; or something along those lines.

				I actually appreciate slow service sometimes, it makes u feel like ur not being rushed out and not being asked to leave. I understand if there is a line waiting to enter, but when there isnt, its nice to digest the food before the next course and be able to talk to your companion. I think Vesta does a nice job of allowing you to enjoy the experience, rather than just rushing you out. Plus, the bar area is not that big, so its nice to sit and enjoy the company. I do think that the waiters could ask, are you in a rush this evening? or if its pre-theater time, do you have a show you need to make? that way, they know if you need to be in and out. Asking if you want the check is always annoying to me. I much prefer them to ask, can I get you anything else? would you like to sit and enjoy the space, maybe another glass of wine or tea? and let the patron ask for the check.

				The menu has rotated and the chicken is taking a vacation, replaced by a very tasty sliced duck breast with some sort of fruity barley (as I recall.. too much wine.) I am writing to recommend it heartily.

				I felt the same way recently. I like a salad as a starter and they didn&#039;t have the cracked wheat<br />salad anymore so I ended up w/soup.<br /><br />Also more fish would be nice.

Had the L&#039;Italiano last week and the Hangover Pizza today, which was just amazing, and there&#039;s a few slices left over for tomorrow morning (or tonight, perhaps!). What&#039;s great is that two people can have a really tasty brunch for $25-$30. high quality food at reasonable prices, i am really loving this place! Happy to see that it&#039;s so popular too.

				Well, to be fair, if you&#039;re splitting the bill that would be $15 each for brunch. <br /><br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />So, my fiance had Vesta&#039;s pre-fixe V-Day dinner last night.&nbsp; Oh my lord, it was good!&nbsp; They started us (and all of the other diners) with a glass of champagne and we also each got two cutely wrapped mint buttercream cookies to take home with us.&nbsp; I had the penne for the appetizer, lamb shank for the entree and the baby Jesus cake for dessert.&nbsp; My guy had the three oysters, seared scallops and the pear strudel.&nbsp; I&#039;m afraid his dishes were much smaller than mine so he was still hungry at the end, but he did say it was extremely tasty.&nbsp; My stuff was just awesomely good and there was a lot of it.&nbsp; The lamb shank was especially impressive.&nbsp; The meat was just falling off the bone.&nbsp; MMMmm... I hope they keep it on their menu.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, this is the first time I&#039;ve ever been out for a V-Day dinner (we usually either go out the night before, or avoid going out at all) and it was perfect!

				We were there for the prix-fixe last night, too, and ran into a couple of other Astorians there as well.<br /><br />I had the foie gras, lamb shank (took some of that home), and the pot de creme, and he had the scallops, duck breast and baby Jesus cake.&nbsp; Everything was cooked extremely well and tasted delicious.&nbsp; My only (minor) quibble was that the menu on the website said the pot de creme would be chocolate, and it turned out to be espresso.&nbsp; That meant that there was no chocolate on the dessert menu at all, and I think on Valentine&#039;s Day of all days there should be at least one chocolate option.&nbsp; That, and I&#039;m a complete chocoholic!&nbsp; <br /><br />The prosecco to start was a nice touch.

				What else is there to say about Vesta?&nbsp; This place is simply one of the best restaurants I&#039;ve ever dined out.&nbsp; I also love their focus on keeping the menu fresh and celebrating the local community in their food purchases, art-work, etc. From the food to the service, the folks at Vesta always find a way to give you a little extra something to make your time there special and memorable (decor and complimentary champagne/cookies on Valentines Day; providing my boyfriend with Baby Jesus Cake to-go for his bday with the family; the time I thanked the bus-boy for clearing my table and he said &quot;it&#039;s my pleasure!&quot;)&nbsp; My guy and I have actually had to take a Vesta hiatus as it was, seriously, the only place that we were eating at when we ate-out or welcomed friends and family to Astoria!&nbsp; &nbsp;It is that good.&nbsp; Cheers to Vesta!!

				I agree on both sides, the portions are small compared to other restaurants but I think that&#039;s the way portion sizes SHOULD be. At Mojave, they throw profits out the window by serving such huge portion sizes. You should be paying for one meal, not two or sometimes three. That&#039;s from the perspective of the restaurant making money though, I understand that from a patron&#039;s perspective you want more for the money. I always leave Vesta feeling content and full, not disgusting I want to purge full (see Mojave). That&#039;s a plus for me but I can see how if you&#039;re used to diner sized portions it would be disconcerting.

				Tough call. On the one hand, restaurants have distorted the average American&#039;s perception of what a &quot;serving size&quot; ought to look like. And if it&#039;s in front of me, I&#039;m inclined to eat it all as I linger while conversing with my companions.<br /><br />On the other, I also like having leftovers, even if they&#039;re usually just enough for a snack. <br /><br />I go to Vesta when I&#039;m not ravenously hungry.

				The menu changing is something I don&#039;t like much. We went one night really in the mood for certain things that<br />were taken off the menu - for me it was their cracked wheat salad and grilled salmon, for my partner is was the<br />calamari. Odd things to remove since I would think they&#039;re fairly popular. <br /><br />Plus just looking recently at the latest menu, whole grilled bronzoni (sp?) turns me off. I think another poster here <br />mentioned ordering and they wouldn&#039;t fillet it. Not everyone wants the &#039;whole&#039; fish - since I don&#039;t eat chicken or red meat,<br />we haven&#039;t gone back there.<br /><br />It is good, but they need to keep some things consistent, not just the baby jesus cake. <br /><br />

				The branzino was fabulous, although there was bacon on the plate (at least when I had it), so if you don&#039;t eat red meat it wouldn&#039;t work for you.&#160; Regardless, if you don&#039;t get the whole fish, you miss out on the delectable cheek meat, which is the most succulent part of the whole fish.

				I guess I&#039;m in the minority, but I&#039;ve found that I really prefer a restaurant with a smaller menu that is constantly changing. I don&#039;t want or need to order the same thing every time I dine and it&#039;s nice to have a place where I can have faith that whatever is on the menu will be done well. The changing menu is definitely a big plus for me.<br /><br />As for the size of the portions, I guess now that I think about it, I can see how Vesta&#039;s sizes wouldn&#039;t be ideal for someone with a large appetite that just wanted an entree. I don&#039;t eat a ton and I usually don&#039;t like to take food home with me. I think the portions are very good for me.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=12689.msg169652#msg169652">Quote from: JoeyC on March 27, 2009, 01:04:15 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I had the gnocchi once, it was size of an appetizer.&nbsp;&nbsp; They need to be more consistant too, stop changing menu.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m surprised at way some posters defend place so strongly, as if they take personal offense that someone questions a restaurant.&nbsp; &nbsp; Vesta is o.k.&nbsp; Nothing more.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t think that anyone has really taken personal offense at critiques of the restaurant.

I think Vest is a great restaurant and I&#039;d have a hard time thinking of places in Astoria that I thought were better. But hey, I still haven&#039;t been everywhere yet and maybe my opinions will change. One of the things I like the most about restaurant reviews on the board is that I can hear why people did or didn&#039;t like a place and decide what sounds good to me!

				I have recently moved to Astoria from Brooklyn (bayridge). &nbsp;Over the weekend, my wife and I went to Vesta which was recommended by one of our new neighbors. &nbsp;The place was very crowded so we had a drink at the bar and with in 15 min we were able to have a table. &nbsp;The place has a very relaxing and cozy feel to it. &nbsp;I worked in many different restaraunts in Brooklyn for over ten years plus and the menu selection was a bit small for my liking but I did like the quality of their carfully selected dishes. &nbsp; Prices were reasonable, slightly inexpensive for the quality of food that they serve. &nbsp;My wife had the Bronzino and I had the Pork Milanese. &nbsp;Both dishes were amazing and fullfilling. I do wish they also had a wider selection of beers but like their food they&#039;re choices of beer are great, particularly the Hofbrau. &nbsp;The staff was extremely helpful and attentive but not overbearing like some places could be. &nbsp;Last but not least the baby Jesus cakes OMG amazing!! Something this heavenly definitely has it&#039;s proper name. &nbsp;<br /><br />Since we just moved to Astoria a month ago, we really can&#039;t judge this place as one of Astoria&#039;s best restaurants...we&#039;re going to continue to explore...but for now this is definitely our favorite local spot!

				Went here last night for my husband&#039;s bday.&nbsp; <br />After reading all the comments about the small portions I was pleasantly surprised that we left feeling very content, and we are good eaters.<br />We started with the pizza (with greens/apples/potatoes)...fantastic, very light, nice combination of tastes.<br />For entrees we ordered the steak (nice and tender, very very good) and the linguine- which was also good.&nbsp; Slightly disappointed that they did not have any specials and no seafood on the menu last night, but it was all good in the end since our food was excellent.<br />We don&#039;t usually order pasta when we go out but honestly we didn&#039;t know what else to get (we don&#039;t eat pork and we didn&#039;t want chicken).<br />I skipped dessert (gave up sweets for Lent) but my husband had the baby Jesus cake and liked it.&nbsp; He thought it tasted better as he went along...said it got better as it cooled down a bit.<br />We also both had a glass of wine, not sure which one but it was very good.<br />I will definitely be going back.

				I went to Vesta for brunch for my birthday two weeks ago and it was divine!&nbsp; The Warm Bankie was amazing and personally I found it to be a better hangover cure than the hangover pizza (we went to Sunswick&#039;s the night before and that place is just dangerous).&nbsp; My dad loved the mushroom and chickpea soup so much that he ordered another one to take home with him for later!<br />I don&#039;t agree with the portion size complaints, though.&nbsp; My husband and brother-in-law both ordered the hangover pizza and those things were massive for one person!&nbsp; My nephew and mom both got pancakes and those were pretty huge as well.&nbsp; The bankie looked small but with all of the butter and cheese and truffle oil in the polenta it was super-rich--I wouldn&#039;t have been able to finish a bigger portion!&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait to go back for dinner.

				The only dish I&#039;ve felt was too small is the Il Italiano at brunch. At first it was more than enough, but I have noticed that it seems much smaller now. It actually wasn&#039;t enough the last time I ordered it, so I haven&#039;t gotten it again since.

				I can&#039;t possibly find enough words to explain how much I love this place. The wine is average at best, but I guess that&#039;s just my taste. The food is truly magnificent - the use of contemporary Italian with local produce is just awesome and the staff there are fantastic. We&#039;ve been going once every 4-6 weeks since it opened and always are treated like friends. I&#039;m about to move out of Astoria and will truly miss this place.

				Just now calling around for reservations for tonight (happens to be Mother&#039;s Day, right?), and the first place sounded a little like, &quot;huh, you&#039;re actually planning to come tonight, on this busy night?&quot;, and then I called Vesta, and they were as ever - consistently - so pleasant to talk to.&nbsp; <br /><br />At some point I have to wonder, how is it that they have this magic ability to make people feel so welcome, comfortable and relaxed?&nbsp; So many places find that tremendously difficult.&nbsp; I hardly need to be fawned over, but I also do notice it when people do have that special touch.&nbsp; I guess I think they should be commended for it.&nbsp; Makes you want them to be very successful, and well treated where they go and in what they do.

				Vesta has a new pizza: roasted eggplant, charred onions, and ricotta salata atop mozzarella and tomato sauce. It is absolutely magnificent and apparently available at brunch, lunch, or dinner. It has the same cracker crust as their other fantastic pizzas, and it is typical Vesta: each topping tastes as fresh as can be and all blends together beautifully.

				Went to Vesta for the first time in awhile this past weekend and it was great as always, but I had to mention the incredible fried polenta. It must have been created by god himself. So frieking good. They are these little fried pieces of polenta that are incredibly moist on the inside and flavorful- very sweet, almost like a dessert item. They were so rich that I couldn&#039;t eat them all...I left one on my plate and haven&#039;t forgiven myself.<br /><br />The thing that I love about Vesta is that it&#039;s always very welcoming, the staff has always made me feel like a regular even though I don&#039;t go there that often. It doesn&#039;t appear that they&#039;ve let the success of it go to their head which is incredibly refreshing in this day and age.

				Leo, one of the co-owners, had us try a cheesecake mousse last night.&nbsp; It was incredible.&nbsp; Tasted like a soft, light, NY-style cheesecake.&nbsp; <br /><br />The breaded fluke on special was great.&nbsp; Their food tastes like home.

				we had brunch Italiano was nice, poached egg could of been poached a bit less ( i like it runny). Polenta with schrooms and eggs a nice treat to find if you like polenta (who wouldn&#039;t). The truffle oil smell lurked inton my nose has a ate my Italiano and it just made it even better.<br /><br />The BEST was the Gingerbread cake with the mini guggelkopf shaped apples (sinful) and icecream so smooth.<br />One of the best best desserts ever. Baby Jesus watch out here comes Liebe Gott.

				I went with my wife last week to try out Vesta on our &#039;date night&#039;.&nbsp; The staff was super friendly, and we liked the ambiance but the food didn&#039;t measure up.&nbsp; I liked the people and space so much that we will give them another try, but what we had that night was not good.<br /><br />The cracker pizza was deplorable.&nbsp; That crust was like eating pizza on Matzoh.&nbsp; I ordered a fish entree that was so dry I could not eat it.&nbsp; But as I said, the staff was super nice and handled my disatisfaction perfectly.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t ask for them to redo it (I was full) and expected nothing, but they comped all our wine and this was greatly appreciated.<br /><br />It is amazing how proper costumer service can make up for such a subpar meal.&nbsp; The food was not good, but we had a nice time.<br /><br />Until we return to Vesta we will stick to L&#039;Incontro for a different but truely amazing Italian dinner.&nbsp; If you watch how you order it isn&#039;t much more expensive either.

				Vesta has super thin-crust pizza.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t like crust that thin, you probably won&#039;t like any of their pizzas.&nbsp; If you go back, give the lasagna a try.&nbsp; It&#039;s amazing, and tends to be what regulars get.

				Yeah it&#039;s a style thing with me for the pizza.&nbsp; I love super thin crust pizza, but I like the crust to have some pliability.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t try any pastas so I&#039;ll go in that direction next visit.

				The lasagna is very tasty and I like the pizza.&nbsp; The pasta dishes I&#039;ve had have been top notch, and the fish I had there last was perfectly cooked.&nbsp; We had some chocolate donut holes for dessert, but next time I&#039;ll stick with the Bebe Jesus cake.&nbsp; The donuts were ok, don&#039;t get me wrong, but the Jesus cake is amazing.<br /><br />You might consider checking out Ornella, too.&nbsp; They have some very interesting dishes - the imbustata is wonderful!

				We finally got around to trying Vesta the Thursday night before Christmas, and I don&#039;t think I can express enough how much I wish it was closer to our end of the neighborhood, because it was fantastic. We tried the butternut squash soup and the meatballs to start, and then three pasta dishes for mains. Everything tasted so super fresh and wonderful, the service was fantastic.&nbsp; I have a feeling I&#039;m going to wind up here for my birthday, so I can carb load for the half marathon I&#039;m running the night after. <br />Also, I regret not trying the lasagna.

				We love living close by to this restaurant. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting. The staff members are super nice and make you feel like an invited guest. I recommend the fluke, house brussle sproats, soups (they are all good), and the linguine.&nbsp; I&#039;ve met some interesting people there as well!

				I finally got to try this place a couple of weeks ago. A good friend was in town during her birthday and they actually managed to be open the Monday night after the big snowstorm. So I proposed we go there for her birthday dinner and boy was it a good choice.<br /><br />For appetizers, we split the Prince Edward mussels and Charred apple salad, for entrees I had the fusilli &amp; fennel sausage and she had a fettucine dish that I think had brussel sprouts &amp; pancetta. For dessert we split the Baby Jesus cake of course. I loved everything I ate and my friend felt properly &quot;birthday-ed.&quot;<br /><br />Next, I want to try brunch!
