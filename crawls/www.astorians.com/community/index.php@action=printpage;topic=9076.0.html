				Hi, I am new to posting on the board and having a profile although I&#039;ve lurked on it a long time. I see that my &#039;position&#039; is &#039;tourist&#039; but don&#039;t understand what that means. I&#039;ve lived in Astoria for 9 years and in NYC for over 15 years so I can&#039;t help but blanch at the designation. Would someone mind explaining to me how it works? Thanks. sbkastoria

				I&#039;m not sure but I just joined about a week ago too and I am also a tourist.&nbsp; I think the longer you are a member of the site the more your status goes up - you go to citizen, mayor, etc. . . whatever the blog&#039;s categories are.<br /><br />Don&#039;t feel bad - I was insulted by the &quot;tourist&quot; designation as well.<br /><br />Keep blogging - your stock will go up!

				The various levels -- such as tourist, illegal alien, citizen, resident, senator, governor, president -- are post count indicators.&nbsp; Keep posting, and you won&#039;t be a tourist for long.&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:

				Thanks. What&#039;s the difference between tourist and limited new user? I see both with zero posts in their profile? Also how does voting work and have there been many polls? :-)

				I think the ranks are ultimately determined by post count. Tired of being a tourist? Get to postin&#039;.

				Indeed, ranks are based on posts. And the new user status is just there until you post one or two posts. It&#039;s a way to keep people from registering just to send a bunch of private messages. i.e. spammers :)
