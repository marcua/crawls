				<br />&quot;Starting this Sunday, and continuing throughout the presidential primary/caucus process, &quot;Meet the Press&quot; will present in-depth interviews with candidates running for the White House. Our &quot;Meet the Candidates&quot; series kicks off on Sunday with 2008 Democratic Presidential candidate former Sen. John Edwards (D-NC). The exclusive interview will be conducted by moderator Tim Russert, and will originate live, from our NBC studios in Washington, D.C.&quot;

				<br />http://usliberals.about.com/od/extraordinaryspeeches/a/Obama2002War.htm<br /><br /><br />extraordinaryspeeches/ Obama2002War<br /><br />&quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;m opposed to. A dumb war. A rash war. A war based not on reason but on passion, not on principle but on politics.<br /><br /><strong>On Saddam Hussein </strong> <br /><br />Now let me be clear: I suffer no illusions about Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal man. A ruthless man. A man who butchers his own people to secure his own power.... The world, and the Iraqi people, would be better off without him.<br /><br />But I also know that Saddam poses no imminent and direct threat to the United States, or to his neighbors...and that in concert with the international community he can be contained until, in the way of all petty dictators, he falls away into the dustbin of history.<br /><br />I know that even a successful war against Iraq will require a U.S. occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.<br /><br />I know that an invasion of Iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the Middle East, and encourage the worst, rather than best, impulses of the Arab world, and strengthen the recruitment arm of al-Qaeda.<br /><br />I am not opposed to all wars. I&#39;m opposed to dumb wars. So for those of us who seek a more just and secure world for our children, let us send a clear message to the president.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You Want a Fight, President Bush? <br /><br />You want a fight, President Bush? Let&#39;s finish the fight with Bin Laden and al-Qaeda, through effective, coordinated intelligence, and a shutting down of the financial networks that support terrorism, and a homeland security program that involves more than color-coded warnings.&quot;<br /><br />
