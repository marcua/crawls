				I came back from work today only to see a very serious looking envelope with the words &quot;Juror Questionnaire&quot; stamped on the front.&nbsp; My heart sunk when I opened it and saw that tis true, tis an official Juror Qualificiation Questionnaire courtesy of Queens County.&nbsp; Gulp.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now let me just say that in theory, I have no problems doing jury duty.&nbsp; In fact, having never been called to do it before, I&#039;m actually curious to do it.&nbsp; I&#039;m just one of <em>those </em> people.&nbsp; However, the reason why my heart sank upon receiving this is the timing.&nbsp; I have a three week trip scheduled to India that I have been planning for over a year.&nbsp; The trip is from June 23rd - July 11th.&nbsp; I am really really worried now that potential jury time may interfere with said trip.<br /><br />So I have many questions about this now.<br /><br />Firstly, while this form stresses it is not a summons and that I am not required to appear for service, am I right to assume that after filling this out, that since I would likely qualify as a juror (US citizen, Queens resident, over 18 years, speak English fluently, no criminal record, never served jury duty before), I will in fact be called to come in for jury duty?&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping that this form is sent to all new Queens residents (I have been here for 1.5 years, but with this most recent tax season, it&#039;s the first time there&#039;s been an official record of it) for their own recordkeeping but somehow I doubt that.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have ten days to turn this form in and I&#039;m really worried now about the timing.&nbsp; How can you get out of this?&nbsp; How long after I turn this form in can I expect a response one way or the other?&nbsp; What happens if I don&#039;t respond?&nbsp; Can you give the court an IOU of sorts and postpone service for another time?&nbsp; And is non-refundable airfare sufficient cause for dismissal from a jury?

				Don&#039;t sweat it. You get a mulligan. Fill out the form and hope they don&#039;t call you on those dates. If they do you can refuse and go the next time.<br />BTW I have lived in India and have served on jury duty in Queens. Jury duty was more enjoyable.<br />&nbsp;

				I got one of those questionnaires as well about 3 months ago.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived in Queens almost 4 years.&nbsp; Still haven&#039;t been called since I sent it in.&nbsp; Right now I am out of work so I have all the time in the world for jury duty but knowing my luck I&#039;ll get called when I land a job.<br /><br />BTW, where are the courts in Queens?

				There is something wacky going on with the New York Unified Courts website, but I found the link to postpone your jury duty online.&nbsp; There&#039;s a ton of other information for the prospective juror.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.nyjuror.gov/users/wwwucs/<br /><br /><br />

				There is the criminal courts in Kew Gardens, next to the old Queens Detention Center. &nbsp;I don&#039;t know if they made any improvements, but it was really cramped and the selection process was dehumanizing. &nbsp;<br /><br />I kind of enjoyed my experience at the civil court in Jamaica. &nbsp;It&#039;s a newer building and there were plenty of seats and lots of magazines and newspapers to read. &nbsp;The court officer actually took the time to try to pronounce everyone&#039;s name correctly and he was very, very patient. &nbsp;Maybe the difference is that it is civil and criminal. &nbsp;<br /><br />

				I know this is a big no-no, but I was supposed to show for jury duty and flaked and didn&#039;t show up. (This was early September 2008, life got busy and that notice ended up on the bottom of the pile of stuff and I flat out forgot!!! I know I knowwwwwww, I should have showed. But I didn&#039;t and it&#039;s all my fault.) About a week later I realized what happened and I was worried that I wouldn&#039;t be allowed to vote, would get fined/arrested, etc. I called and was all &quot;omg! I didn&#039;t show! I&#039;m so sorry, have mercy on me bla bla bla&quot; and the lady looked me up and said &quot;yep. you were marked absent. Don&#039;t worry about it, but make sure you show up next time you&#039;re called.&quot; I haven&#039;t heard anything since, but I&#039;m going to be all over it next time I&#039;m called.<br /><br />I&#039;m just saying, worst case scenario, you&#039;re called on your date and can&#039;t postpone and just don&#039;t show...you won&#039;t die.<br /><br />(Also, I&#039;m one of those people that likes jury duty. I served on a murder case once and it was the most interesting two weeks of that year.)<br /><br />Man, I&#039;m not trying to say you shouldn&#039;t show up to jury duty! But, worst case scenario...

				I got one of those questionnaire notices last summer and after ignoring it twice, they sent me the same questionnaire labeled with some sort of &quot;bad juror&quot; language in February.&nbsp; So, this time, I sent it in and got selected as a telephone juror in April.&nbsp; On the notice, they said that it was possible to reschedule your jury service at least a week from the date you are required to call in, through mail, online and phone.&nbsp; You have to reschedule your jury service dates within 6 months of the notice date. <br /><br />There are the LIC, Kew Gardens and Jamaica courts.&nbsp; I got selected for Jamaica and I too was worried about my upcoming trip but they were very accommodating.&nbsp; Vacation/Travel is one of the issues you can talk to them about for rescheduling.&nbsp; Ultimately, I was just called for one day, so the trip became a non-issue.<br /><br />&nbsp;--- I&#039;ve been to India a number of times and I loved it each and every time (even though I had to see all of my family&nbsp; :-D).&nbsp; Hope you have a great time there!&nbsp; :mrgreen:

				That&#039;s okay - I got the juror questionnaire AND a juror summons on the same day! Explain that one.&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br />You won&#039;t have any issues - if you get called while you are out of town and miss it since you never got the mail, you can always mail them a copy of your travel itinerary and explain you were out of town and never got it when you get back if you are concerned about getting fined/in trouble.

				Eh, Mr.NY got one of those questionnaires months ago and he just totally ignored it (To my credit, i did encourage him to send it in). He hasn&#039;t heard anything since. <br />I personally did jury duty about 10 years ago in NJ. It was a complete waste of time, but at least my job paid me. My Dad told me he&#039;s been called a few times over the years and he always circled the &quot;I am the head of household and jury duty would cause severe economic hardship&quot; (or something to that effect) box and that was that. Don&#039;t sweat it.The odds of them calling you anytime soon are pretty slim.

				Wait til you get served for Grand Jury Duty... You&#039;re called? you serve- 5 days a week for 4 weeks. You either have to be dead or darn near close to it to get out of it. It&#039;s a lot more interesting than regular Jury Duty, though.

				Queens Criminal Court in Kew Gardens treats potential jurors like criminals. The central jury room accommodates about 1,000 people with seating. The problem is that they call 1,200 people or so every Monday and Tuesday for duty. People stand for hours. They act like the people called in are under arrest i.e. you can&#039;t leave the building, get coffee or simply get some air. <br /><br />I don&#039;t recommend driving there and planning to park in the municipal lot either. They won&#039;t let you leave to add quarters. If one is called to report there, I recommend bringing something&nbsp; to drink and read.<br /><br />The two cases that I was interviewed for were attempted murder cases. During breaks in the corridors, juror intimidation was overt by acquaintances of the defendant(s.) Thankfully I was disqualified from both juries.

				i got a summons and have to call on friday to see if i have to show up on monday. <br />my question is, how do they decide which court in queens to send you to? i live 15 minutes away from the LIC one and would love to roll out of bed and head down there, instead of dragging myself to kew gardens or something.

				They decide, so far as I know. Nobody has ever asked me which I&#039;d prefer. The LIC courthouse has no more than 2 courtrooms active at any time. Odds are you&#039;ll end up in Jamaica.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been called 5 times; only one of them was LIC.&nbsp; The LIC one was certainly the quickest - they had one case to try in my jury term. After 2 half-days of jury selection, the parties settled, and we were all sent home.

As far as where, the odds definitely favor ending up at the main courthouse out in Jamaica: more cases to try = greater need for jurors. Be ready to write quickly - it&#039;s a pain trying to figure out the addresses.
