				<br />On occasion, like to highlight these events.<br /><br /><br />John Dean and Barry Goldwater Jr.&nbsp; <br />Monday, April 21, 2008&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />John Dean was the White House counsel to President Richard Nixon and a key figure in the Watergate scandal. Dean&#039;s testimony during televised hearings in the U.S. Senate implicated high-ranking White House officials in the 1972 Watergate break-in and wiretaps and asserted that Nixon was involved in efforts to cover up the scandal. Dean&#039;s allegations played a key role in Nixon&#039;s eventual resignation from the presidency. <br /><br />Barry Goldwater Jr. is a member of the legendary Goldwater family, known for their governmental service over the last two generations. At age 30 Goldwater, Jr. won a seat in Congress, the beginning of eight such wins. He and his father made U.S. history as one of the few father-son pairs ever to serve in Congress simultaneously. <br /><br />Ever since John Dean and Barry Goldwater, Jr. were roommates at Staunton Military Academy they have dreamt of collaborating on a project, dedicated to the legacy of the latter’s iconic father. <br /><br /><br /><br />http://www.oxoniansociety.com/About.asp<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;The Oxonian Society is dedicated to provocative discussion and debate with the world&#039;s best and most interesting minds, and is a Manhattan-based non-partisan non-profit organization. The Society is open to people of all educational backgrounds and experiences. By connecting great leaders and thinkers with a highly intelligent, motivated, experienced and well-networked audience, the Society hopes to play a small role in shaping the great debates of our generation. The Society is committed to providing access to this generation&#039;s leaders and great thinkers in hopes that we can inspire the next. <br />&nbsp;

Goldwater loyally defended Nixon during the Watergate Scandal and it was not until 5th August, 1974, that he joined the campaign to have him impeached. Nixon then knew he could not survive and resigned from office four days later. <br />
