				<strong>Esther m Palmer &amp; aemp:dance | amiti perry+company</strong><br /><strong>June 11th at 8:30 pm </strong><br />Palmer&nbsp; &nbsp;and Perry intentionally challenge their joint audience to undergo two&nbsp; &nbsp;divergent dance experiences, allowing their distinct relationships to&nbsp; &nbsp;body and space to merge into an evening of unforgettable dance. <br />&nbsp;<div align="center">(http://www.greenspacestudio.org/images/EMP-OS6MiguelAnaya-73.jpg)</div> <div style="text-align: right;">Photo by: Miguel Anaya</div>Esther m Palmer straddles&nbsp; &nbsp;the boundaries between performance and workshop in her new project only&nbsp; &nbsp;shallow people, an improvised dance inspired by the relationship&nbsp; &nbsp;between the unique and the universal body, and between the experiential&nbsp; &nbsp;and the visual body. Palmer and dancers Erin Cairns, Sarah Lehman, Emily&nbsp; &nbsp;Leonard, Joanna Nobbe, and Alexandra Taylor welcome the audience to&nbsp; &nbsp;share in a half hour performance that attempts to look at these bodies&nbsp; &nbsp;full of curiosity and without judgment. Splitting their time between the&nbsp; &nbsp;dance floor and the audience circle, the cast shares honest movement as dancers and talks candidly as viewers, taking the audience on a quick educational journey of the non-judgmental vision and improvisation that they developed in the creation of this interactive work. Audience are encouraged to speak alongside the dancers and participate actively in the conversations that result from this heart-opening experience. only shallow people&nbsp; is supported in part by the Queens Council on the Arts&nbsp; &nbsp;with public funding from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs.<br />&nbsp;<div align="center">(http://www.greenspacestudio.org/images/Perry_EricBandiero.JPG)</div> <div style="text-align: right;">Photo by: Eric Vandiero</div> <em>“Amiti&nbsp; &nbsp;Perry&#039;s unique and challenging choreography consistently inspires and&nbsp; &nbsp;throws out of the window what you may have thought you knew about&nbsp; &nbsp;dance…” </em><br />Amiti Perry’s <em> STUCK: in the IN-betweens&nbsp; |head,&nbsp; &nbsp;heart, gut, body, place| peers</em> into a realm of the intellectual and&nbsp; &nbsp;physical process of being constrained, restrained and bound to something&nbsp; &nbsp;or someone. This company of powerful females, including Emily Bass, Amy Campbell, Perry, and Sophie Torok, embraces&nbsp; &nbsp;the elements of these situational constrictions and finds their way to&nbsp; &nbsp;complete release through challenging choreography that explores the&nbsp; &nbsp;spectrum of intimate gesture and full force movements. A voyeuristic&nbsp; &nbsp;audience will be consumed as the provocative vignettes carry them&nbsp; &nbsp;through the journey of finding function within dysfunction in a highly&nbsp; &nbsp;charged environment. <br /><br /><br />Tickets:&nbsp; $15
