			<br />reply to: fallinguphill15@gmail.com<br /><br />Have you ever felt like a fish out of water? Have you ever found yourself in a &quot;fake it til you make it&quot;, unexpected kind of situation in your personal, professional or even your inner life?<br />If the answer is yes and you have a great story to tell, I want to talk to you for a new podcast I&#039;m producing.<br />Your story might be funny, suspenseful, awkward, frightening, uplifting, absurd unthinkable ... (feel free to insert a more original adjective here).<br />All stories must be 100% true to the best of your recollection. First and third person narratives are both acceptable. This is ideally your story but could also be about someone you know.<br />Please e-mail me a one to four sentence description of what happens in your story. And please include your location. Also, keep in mind that if your story is selected, I&#039;d need to meet with you somewhere in the NYC area for 60 to 90 minutes to record.<br /><br />
