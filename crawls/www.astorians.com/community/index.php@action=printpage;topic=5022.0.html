				Hi everyone - cool board!<br /><br />I&#39;ve just relocated to NY from overseas (British guy, 12 years in Hong Kong... long story!) and am really attracted to Astoria. <br /><br />Looking for a 2 bedroom (ideally) to rent from around 2/15 - or before. I&#39;ve got quite a lot of furniture, and work from home (media professional) and so am looking for a minimum 12 month rental. At least 700 sq ft - more preferably. <br /><br />Budget around $1,600 but can maybe stretch a tiny bit more if it&#39;s a really nice place, quiet, and has a balcony. Prefer not to use realtors and would rather deal with owners direct - I&#39;m a landlord too. Oh, and having recently arrived, I don&#39;t have a US credit history, but am good for a long rental.<br /><br />Any help appreciated - Thanks!

				Hi everyone<br /><br />I posted this request a couple of weeks back (as a $1,600 listing) but having seen goodness knows how many places in the last 2 weeks, and few of them being all that nice, I need to up my budget - sadly - to around $1800.<br /><br />So if anyone has (or knows of) a really nice 2 bed / 1 bath apartment for rent, preferably in Broadway / 30th Ave / Kaufman Studios areas, then please do let me know. Renovated kitchen and bath is pretty important, and an open-plan living / dining area would be good too. Preferably building not private house, but open to most types. Will be working from home so will be a home / office environment. <br /><br />Need this for immediate move in, though can be 3/1 if needs be.<br /><br />Thanks again everyone.<br /><br />Neil&nbsp;
