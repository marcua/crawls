			Dear Astorians,<br /><br /><br /><br />* Do you want to rid our communities of sexual and intimate partner violence? <br />* Do you have two 6-hour slots of time per month available to visit the Emergency Department (ED) and support a survivor of this violence? <br />* Are you available to train for 40 hours with experts in the fields of trauma and social justice in October?<br />If yes, please join the Mount Sinai Sexual Assault and Violence Intervention (SAVI) Programâ€™s roster of volunteer ED patient advocates. We are currently recruiting for our Fall 2018 SAVI Volunteer ED Patient Advocate Training. <br /><br /><br />For details and the online application, please go here: http://www.tinyurl.com/savirecruit. <br /><br /><br />For more information, please call 212-423-2140 or email savi@mssm.edu now. YOU can be an early positive support for those on the path towards healing.
