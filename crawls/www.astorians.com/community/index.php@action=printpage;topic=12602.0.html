				I have&#160; a&#160; whole host of reasons&#160; why I would&#160; never&#160; vote&#160; for Obama, but, one of the most disturbing aspects&#160; about the&#160; man is&#160; the continuing attacks on anyone&#160; who tries&#160; to look into his background.&#160; The&#160; controversies&#160; of his &#039;radical&#039; buddies&#160; to the more&#160; benign, like why he changed&#160; his name, and the&#160; whole middle&#160; name nonsense, reminds me of that scene from the Ten Commmandments.. &#039;The Name&#160; Of Moses&#160; will be erased, and remain unspoken.&#039; :-) Seriously, we&#160; know&#160; about Palins&#160; daughters pregnancy, McCains divorce, even Bidens&#160; five&#160; differments&#160; from Vietnam, although the latter&#160; was not as publisized&#160; as Cheney&#039;s, but, Obama is&#160; beyond&#160; rock star or celebrity. It&#039;s almost like&#160; he is some &#039;Holy&#039; man. I was recently&#160; sitting in with some democrats to register&#160; voters for the elections. The usual&#160; shenanigans, one of the democrats was trying to bring in street/homeless&#160; drunk people&#160; and filling out the form and trying to submit it.&#160; :lol:&#160; Anyway, when I bought up the radical bomb thrower Ayers&#160; story, it was &#039;hiss&#039;, and be silent, it&#039;s a&#160; &#039;low blow?&#039; Really? Then I bought up the middle&#160; name and why is everyone and everything connected&#160; with Bush&#039;s&#160; name bought up with McCains name, but, we can&#039;t ask as to what&#160; is behind the change of name of Obama?&#160; It seems&#160; to me, that we are electing&#160; a President, not King or Pharoh.

Bombing and killing innocent people is now excused as &quot;young and irresponsible&quot;. Let&#039;s leave Obama out of this so we don&#039;t confuse politics with reality. Ayers was, is and will live his remaining days as a scumbag who cares nothing about the lives that he destroyed. He has done <strong>NOTHING</strong> to help children. He works tirelessly to destroy education and turn it into radical, idealogical bullshit which celebrates communism above all else. And a university still hires (and celebrates) him and his statist ideals? <br />As for today, has he ever uttered a word of sorrow to the lives that he has ruined? Ever say &quot;ya know, it was probably wrong to attempt to blow up a judges house while his young children were asleep in their bed&quot;? I haven&#039;t heard it. People in the 60s have done some truly courageous things and have changed our society for the better in many instances. Bill Ayers was not one of those people.<br />Now back to Presidential politics. So let me ask:<br />If a Republican nominee, for the POTUS, started his political career in the living of an abortion bombers living room, would he also be considered &quot;young and irresponsible&quot;?

				OK,now this is my problem with this whole Obama thing <br />(1)he says William Ayers is &quot;just some guy in my neighborhood&quot;,but as it turns out he sat on 2 boards with him, had his political&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;coming out &quot; party at his home (yet says he didn&#039;t know whose house it was) and helped get grants for education<br />now if Obama had said early in his campaign that the cost of doing business politically in Chicago is associating with MR. Ayers/ Rev. Wright and that he strongly condemns Mr Ayers / Rev. Wright&#039;s actions/words it would probably be over and done with.<br />(2)Hussain is the guys middle name , dont cry racism, say it with pride, My name is BARACK HUSSAIN OBAMA and i am running for president

However, I think rather than looking directly at Ayers to re-evaluate Obama, it would be better to look at what the board they served on actually did. There are often differing opinions on boards and I would think that the outcomes of the group would reveal more about Ayers&#039; influence on Obama than speeches that Ayers gives now or crimes he committed in the past.

				Palin is married to a man who wishes Alaska to leave the US. But that, unlike Obama&#039;s association with Ayers, it&#039;s a very tenuous connection--they&#039;re just married, for crying out loud. And Palin did use her office to try to get a state trooper fired for personal reasons that had nothing to do with how he did his job, but that&#039;s just high spirits, I&#039;m sure. And McCain and his association with the Keating 5--who cares about that? And McCain giving the Vietcong state secrets as a POW--no biggie. He&#039;s a war hero--don&#039;t let anyone tell you anything different. And he chose a woman as his running-mate; that is incredible, and should brand him as a supporter of women. Don&#039;t let his record on women&#039;s issues or the fact that he called his wife Cindy a c*nt in front of 3 reporters change your mind. Obama knows Ayers, somehow, and that should be enough for voters. And his middle name is Hussein.. crazy. <br /><br />

				This piece from the NY Times pretty much sums up my feelings right now: http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/opinion/12rich.html<br />This in particular:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">All’s fair in politics. John McCain and Sarah Palin have every right to bring up William Ayers, even if his connection to Obama is minor, even if Ayers’s Weather Underground history dates back to Obama’s childhood, even if establishment Republicans and Democrats alike have collaborated with the present-day Ayers in educational reform. But it’s not just the old Joe McCarthyesque guilt-by-association game, however spurious, that’s going on here. Don’t for an instant believe the many mindlessly “even-handed” journalists who keep saying that the McCain campaign’s use of Ayers is the moral or political equivalent of the Obama campaign’s hammering on Charles Keating.<br /><br />What makes them different, and what has pumped up the Weimar-like rage at McCain-Palin rallies, is the violent escalation in rhetoric, especially (though not exclusively) by Palin. Obama “launched his political career in the living room of a domestic terrorist.” He is “palling around with terrorists” (note the plural noun). Obama is “not a man who sees America the way you and I see America.” Wielding a wildly out-of-context Obama quote, Palin slurs him as an enemy of American troops. <br /><br />By the time McCain asks the crowd “Who is the real Barack Obama?” it’s no surprise that someone cries out “Terrorist!” The rhetorical conflation of Obama with terrorism is complete. It is stoked further by the repeated invocation of Obama’s middle name by surrogates introducing McCain and Palin at these rallies. This sleight of hand at once synchronizes with the poisonous Obama-is-a-Muslim e-mail blasts and shifts the brand of terrorism from Ayers’s Vietnam-era variety to the radical Islamic threats of today.<br /><br />That’s a far cry from simply accusing Obama of being a guilty-by-association radical leftist. Obama is being branded as a potential killer and an accessory to past attempts at murder. “Barack Obama’s friend tried to kill my family” was how a McCain press release last week packaged the remembrance of a Weather Underground incident from 1970 — when Obama was 8.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ve seen these rallies, and it&#039;s pretty scary. It&#039;s not just politics as usual; McCain and Palin have been making people truly hate Obama, truly be afraid of him, and in some cases truly want him dead. <br /><br />It&#039;s worth noting about Weather Underground that, while they did bomb government buildings, monuments, and banks, they never killed anyone (aside from when a couple of their own members were killed accidentally while assembling a bomb). They warned people ahead of time and gave people time to leave - the bombings were to serve as a way to bring attention to the atrocities being committed by the US around the world, and they did not want to kill or injure more people in the process. These people are hardly in the same category as Al Qaeda or anyone else the average American thinks of as a terrorist. Not to mention that Ayers has turned his life around in the decades since then. Unfortunately, neither McCain/Palin nor the mass media is bothering to say any of this. If they did, nobody would care how well Obama knows the guy.

				This will be my final comment on this, or any other political issue on this board. <br />I believe the election is a foregone conclusion. Obama will win. I sincerely wish him the absolute best, for his own sake and more importantly for the sake of this country. I have never accused him of being a secret Muslim Terrorist. He associations give me (and many others) cause for concern. He has spent twenty years in a church that preaches Liberation Theology. Take away the firebrand stuff that makes the evening news and the core of it is small c communism. He was selected to chair a board by William Ayers (more on him later), who has a political agenda that does not hide his Marxist worldview. His stump speeches are full of a &quot;new way&quot; rhetoric without any specifics.<br />Any citizen of this country who feels that government intervention into the lives of private citizens is a necessary evil at best, should rightly be alarmed.<br />Odenhal made a valid point, that this may just be the price of admission to Chicago politics. I hope so, but than what does that say about Chicago or the political class of that city?<br /><br />So now onto Ayers:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It&#039;s worth noting about Weather Underground that, while they did bomb government buildings, monuments, and banks, they never killed anyone (aside from when a couple of their own members were killed accidentally while assembling a bomb).

When his girlfriend was killed by that bomb, do you think Bill wrote a long and sorrow felt letter to the girl&#039;s parents? Maybe explaining why he felt it is for the greater good, that their daughter had to die to bring the revolution to the the shores of the United States?<br />Shame on all of you apologists. What does someone have to do earn banishment?<br /><br />http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/Read.aspx?GUID=9E8CD8A7-E90B-4311-8AA9-AEFD014A14B2<br /><br />I understand frontpage isn&#039;t everyones cup of tea, but you may find it interesting.<br /><br />Bill Ayers and his sociopath wife have not changed. Their goals are the same as when they set bombs. But they decided that to accomplish their goals, they needed to have access to children so that the revolution can be seeded into your kids and my kids. Let me repeat: The goals are the same, the tactic has changed.<br />He has never actually helped a child.&nbsp; His idea of charity is to raise money from other people to advance his own selfish cause.<br />And Essen, most importantly, he will be the first to tell you that he has not turned his life around.<br /><br />With that, I will go enjoy this beautiful Autumn day with my son. <br />Sorry for all that I have offended, it was not my intention.

I thought this went without saying, but I am not a supporter of bombing things to make a point whether it involves killing people or not. But McCain/Palin were very clearly aiming to get people to think that Obama is associated with terrorists that wouldn&#039;t be out of place in Al Qaeda. Bill Ayers was and probably still is a radical, but he was never that kind of terrorist. I think everyone in this thread is aware of the distinction, but I would wager that when the majority of people in the country hear the term &quot;domestic terrorist&quot; they&#039;re imagining the Oklahoma City bombing as well as tactics used by Islamic extremists, thinking that this friend of Obama&#039;s is plotting suicide bombings and blowing up buses filled with people. McCain actually had to tell a concerned old lady at his rally that Obama is not an Arab. Now that the reaction to this campaign tactic has been so badly negative from all sides, they&#039;ve changed their tune. Sweeper, you are concerned about this for entirely different (and more legitimate) reasons.

				<br />Republicans never seemed to have a problem with the Bush family connection to the Bin Laden family, not to mention the countries biggest corporate criminal, Ken Lay. yadda yadda... We can go back and forth with this for months.<br /><br />If Obama named Ayers as his running mate, or added him to his administration, I would have a problem with that.<br /><br />The real serious question is <strong>Obama&#039;s connection to Kevin Bacon</strong>.

				May I ask a stupid question?&nbsp; If Ayers is a &#039;terrorist&#039;, what is he doing working with schools and not in prison?&nbsp; I thought we do not allow terrorists to roam around freely.&nbsp; Is he equal to Osama bin Laden?&nbsp; Is he like Qadaffi?&nbsp; How about the Oklahoma bomber?&nbsp; Who is this guy?

It&#039;s not just politics as usual; McCain and Palin have been making people truly hate Obama, truly be afraid of him, and in some cases truly want him dead. <br /><br />It&#039;s worth noting about Weather Underground that, while they did bomb government buildings, monuments, and banks, they never killed anyone (aside from when a couple of their own members were killed accidentally while assembling a bomb). They warned people ahead of time and gave people time to leave - the bombings were to serve as a way to bring attention to the atrocities being committed by the US around the world, and they did not want to kill or injure more people in the process. These people are hardly in the same category as Al Qaeda or anyone else the average American thinks of as a terrorist. Not to mention that Ayers has turned his life around in the decades since then. Unfortunately, neither McCain/Palin nor the mass media is bothering to say any of this. If they did, nobody would care how well Obama knows the guy.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ayers&nbsp; is&nbsp; a&nbsp; typical&nbsp; Left_wing bomb thrower&nbsp; from the generation&nbsp; of &#039;peace.&#039; They wanted&nbsp; Communist&nbsp; to win worldwide and he still advocates&nbsp; radical Leftist&nbsp; indoctrination in schools. They wanted&nbsp; to alert&nbsp; the world of&nbsp; US atrocities, while advocating genocide&nbsp; committed&nbsp; by Communists, wonderful. <br /><br />What is&nbsp; truly scary has been the last 8 years of&nbsp; white washing from movies showing the assassination of&nbsp; the President, Bush, to &#039;jokes&#039;&nbsp; in the miantsream of&nbsp; deaths&nbsp; of Republicans. Several GOP delegates&nbsp; to this year Convention were attacked by the &#039;peace&nbsp; and love&#039;&nbsp; mob that had gathered&nbsp; outside.

But that, unlike Obama&#039;s association with Ayers, it&#039;s a very tenuous connection--they&#039;re just married, for crying out loud. And Palin did use her office to try to get a state trooper fired for personal reasons that had nothing to do with how he did his job, but that&#039;s just high spirits, I&#039;m sure. And McCain and his association with the Keating 5--who cares about that? And McCain giving the Vietcong state secrets as a POW--no biggie. He&#039;s a war hero--don&#039;t let anyone tell you anything different. And he chose a woman as his running-mate; that is incredible, and should brand him as a supporter of women. Don&#039;t let his record on women&#039;s issues or the fact that he called his wife Cindy a c*nt in front of 3 reporters change your mind. Obama knows Ayers, somehow, and that should be enough for voters. And his middle name is Hussein.. crazy. <br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks&nbsp; for repeating the BS from the internet about Palin and McCain. First, Palins&nbsp; husband&nbsp; has some &#039;native&#039;&nbsp; blood and wanted to advocate&nbsp; for the natives of&nbsp; alaska, and the party has not advocated&nbsp; for seccession since&nbsp; the 90&#039;s. Second, the Gov was within her rights to fire him, he was&nbsp; a thug. The only question was if&nbsp; any &#039;ethics&#039;&nbsp; violation, using undue family pressure. A husband supporting his wife and sister-in-law&nbsp; may be stretching, but, admireable. <br /><br />Bring up the Keating 5 and watch Obama lose Ohio, provided&nbsp; the&nbsp; 200,000 phony votes&nbsp; are not counted. Both John McCain and John Glenn were cleared of any criminal involvement in the scandal. Both worked the rest of their political careers fighting corruption.Does Obama care so little for the good names of Democrat Senators, Alan Cranston (D-CA), Dennis DeConcini (D-AZ), John Glenn (D-OH), and Donald W. Riegle (D-MI) ? :mrgreen:<br /><br />Now, we get&nbsp; to the gutter of politics, attacking a man who was held prisoner&nbsp; by Communists&nbsp; and beaten&nbsp; for years. A man who would not leave&nbsp; or publicly renounce&nbsp; his nation as&nbsp; giving state secrets&nbsp; while&nbsp; a POW. Nobody sane questions that McCain went through hell in Vietnam, or belittles his torture and abuse. For his military service, McCain won the Silver Star, Bronze Star, Legion of Merit, Purple Heart and Distinguished Flying Cross. But, when dealing on the internet, sanity&nbsp; is in short supply, as is reality. It&#039;s disgusting<br /><br />Finally, what are &#039;womens issues?&#039;&nbsp; I think the &#039;reporters&#039;, no doubt by the same unbiased&nbsp; press, that thinks Obama&nbsp; knew nothing of&nbsp; a &#039;Rev&#039; who for 20 years vented his spleen against &#039;Garlic Noses&#039;&nbsp; and&nbsp; this G*D D@MN&nbsp; America.&#039; In and of itself it means&nbsp; little, but, Obama&#039;s&nbsp; list of &#039;buddies&#039;, seem to hate&nbsp; this country, hug Communists&nbsp; and Islamic Fascist and any &#039;questioning&#039; as my original post stated, is now confirmed as being VERBOTEN.

				Yeah, Drudge cherry-picked that poll. If you actually go to this link: http://www.gallup.com/poll/111211/Gallup-Daily-Obama-49-McCain-43.aspx (http://www.gallup.com/poll/111211/Gallup-Daily-Obama-49-McCain-43.aspx), you can see that Obama is up, according to that very same poll, by 6 points using a registered-voters screen, and also up 6 points using a more realistic likely-voters screen. The 2-point lead is if you assume the relatively low turnout of African-Americans and young people, and the enthusiastic evangelical turnout, of 2000 and 2004. Which is not bloody likely. A 6-point lead is not impossible for McCain to make up in these last couple of weeks, although he has structural problems with the electoral college that makes even a tie not quite good enough for a win.<br /><br />It will definitely be an interesting election night, that&#039;s for sure!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=12602.msg154879#msg154879">Quote from: Billz1981 on October 17, 2008, 09:37:54 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hold the presses.&nbsp; Just saw on Drudge that the Gallup traditional poll of likely voters has it as Obama 49, McCain 47: http://www.gallup.com/poll/111124/Gallup-Daily-Likely-Voters-Traditional.aspx<br /><br />Well within the margin of error.&nbsp; And then when you correct for all the dead people who are registered but can&#039;t actually vote, the traditional poor turnout of youth, the fact that most college kids don&#039;t go home to vote or screw up their absentee ballots, etc. it looks like this will be an interesting race down to the wire.<br /><br />I am glad, because I knew we all wanted it this way.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Just wanted to qualify my remarks above.<br /><br />What I mean is that it is true that Obama has an association with Ayers, an unrepentant terrorist.&nbsp; It is also true that Ayers espouses some education policies that are considered very radical to many.<br /><br />It is true that ACORN, which receives treatment by the Associated Press and other news organizations as a non partisan group that lobbies on behalf of minorities, is unabashedly campaigning for Obama.&nbsp; It is also true that they have been under investigation several times for voter irregularities, including the latest dust up.&nbsp; Finally, it is true that the Obama campaign paid an ACORN affiliated group 800 thousand bucks for GOTV services, 80 grand of which made its way directly to ACORN.<br /><br />Now, how much any of this means to you probably depends on how you were inclined to vote in the first place.&nbsp; But it&#039;s still a valid part of the discourse.&nbsp; Personally, I am willing to give Obama a slide on the Ayers thing.&nbsp; Yes, Ayers is an unreformed terrorist, and stands against everything I believe in.&nbsp; But all politicians have dubious associations.&nbsp; As noted political journalist David Letterman pointed out, McCain has connections to Watergate burglar G.

				o bill you know how the nods go by now :lol:<br /><br />Now regarding ACORN , while voter fraud does worry me ,i think the premise of ACORN is a noble idea (get out the vote /voter registration/minority housing issue&#039;s)it has been perverted much like the &quot;trickle down &quot;theory has .we have had so called Conservatives in the White House for 20 of the past 28 years and look at the deficit,the only President who has balanced the budget was a Democratic one &nbsp;:oops:<br /><br />now Obama&nbsp; i too feel that he doesn&#039;t have much of a voting record to go on(heck i am having a very hard time finding his voting records from his state senate days) so his associations come into play more ,but as i said before that&#039;s the cost of doing business as a democrate in the city of Chicago. my opinion of William Ayers is he should be in jail he is a f....in A..hole. his associations with the rev&#039;s Wright,Jackson and my personal fav. Louis Farrakan, can they be compaired to McCain&#039;s assoc with some far right preachers( that was for you Casicua). :roll:while i do like Obama as a person i am not convinced the he is &quot;THE ONE&quot; just yet<br /><br />And last regarding McCain&#039;s rallies , why is it if some idiots scream out some vile bull%$it do we brand McCaina racist?.If McCain is guilty by association because of a handfull of as&amp;^%oles at his rallies,what does that make Obama for his 20 years with his preacher? <br />

I sincerely hope you never find yourself on the wrong end of that stick. People who are living with either life-threatening or genetic diseases don&#039;t want no stickin&#039; charity. Keep your bloody handouts. They want to be kept from death&#039;s door, with food on the table and a roof over their head.

				I think it&#039;s amazing that some McCain supporters can be so very concerned about Obama&#039;s acquaintances and professional relationships, but it&#039;s not even a slight concern that Sarah Palin&#039;s own husband was a member of the Alaskan Independence Party for several years. Why is that? In case you&#039;re not really aware of the AIP&#039;s goals, here are some things directly from the AIP&#039;s FAQ page (italics are added by me): <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Q: What is the Alaskan Independence Party?<br /><br />A: An Alaskan political party whose members advocate a range of solutions to the conflicts between federal and local authority; from advocacy for state&#039;s rights, through a return to territorial status, <em>all the way to complete independence and nationhood status for Alaska</em>.<br /><br />Q: Aren&#039;t most Alaskan Independence Party members a bunch of radicals and Kooks?<br /><br />A: The party has its share of individualists, in the grand Alaskan tradition. <em>No longer a fringe party, the A.I.P. is a viable third party with a serious mission and qualified candidates for elected offices.</em><br /><br />Q: If Alaska became independent, wouldn&#039;t we lose a lot of federal money?<br /><br />A: No. If Alaska returned to territorial status, most federal money would still be available. <em>If Alaska were to attain complete independence, its revenues from oil and other natural resources would far exceed the amounts currently received from the federal government, at our current level of resource utilization. </em><br /><br /><em>Q: Would I lose my U.S. citizenship?<br /><br />A: Depending on the form of independence, several forms of citizenship would be possible, including the retention of U.S. citizenship or dual citizenship. However, considering the moral, educational, and economic decay of the U.S., Alaskans&#039; who hold themselves to a higher standard might very well decide to at least maintain an arm&#039;s length distance from a country in decline. </em></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />How is Palin allowed by McCain supporters to speak lovingly to the &quot;pro-America&quot; areas of the nation while her own freaking husband belonged to a political party whose specific goal was to secede from the morally, educationally, and economically bankrupt US while they were married and while she was mayor? Are her supporters simply not aware of it, or does that not matter as much as the fact that Obama has had a professional relationship with a radical Vietnam protester and has supported a group that tries to get minorities to vote but has some poopie employees? And why is it not a bigger issue that the Troopergate thing, whether you think it was an unbiased investigation or not, did in fact find that she violated ethics rules, and yet Sarah insists that the report found she did nothing wrong? It&#039;s one thing to say the report is invalid, but she said the report did not find &quot;any hint of any kind of unethical activity.&quot; That&#039;s a blatant lie. Is this her idea of ethics reform: publicly disparaging the people investigating you, and then lying about their findings when they don&#039;t suit you?<br /><br />Why aren&#039;t people who don&#039;t live in Alaska more concerned that the Sarah/Todd Palin team is going to work very hard to promote issues that benefit Alaska above all else? I just don&#039;t get it. Why does anyone think Sarah goes on and on so much about Alaskan oil and how important it is that we get oil from Alaska? Candidates&#039; families are supposedly off-limits, and yet it&#039;s clear that Todd Palin, an Alaska oil producer by the way, has been very actively involved with his wife&#039;s work as governor. I would guess that the only reason no one in the Obama campaign is making a bigger deal about this is because he doesn&#039;t want to give the opposition a reason to drag his wife through the mud anymore than she already was for her &quot;I&#039;m proud of my country&quot; comment.<br /><br />I have no problem with the fact that some people don&#039;t support Obama. It&#039;s taken me a long time to have a remotely positive opinion of him, and even now I&#039;m still not totally confident that he will do great things with this country. What I don&#039;t understand is how some people can come down so hard on him for these &quot;trust&quot; issues while totally ignoring Palin&#039;s. And don&#039;t say it&#039;s because Palin isn&#039;t running for President. All indications are that she is going to try very hard to be relevant if McCain gets elected- and so will her husband as the 2nd Dude. <br /><br />I&#039;m not exaggerating when I say that Sarah Palin was one of the worst political decisions John McCain has ever made, and I think she is the reason he won&#039;t be elected.<br /><br />EDIT: I realize this thread had taken a somewhat different turn onto Obama&#039;s perceived socialist endeavors, but this ACORN/Ayers crap keeps coming up, and she&#039;s going around giving speeches to &quot;pro-America&quot; areas of the country and it just bugs me.

You cannot have your cake and eat it too- either accept that Obama&#039;s associations are as valid as Palins, or accept the irrelevance of it all.

Example, when the press said the word &#039;terrorists&#039; and &#039;kill&#039; him&#039; at a Mccain rally represents Republicans.<br /><br />Well, I wouldn&#039;t have to go far to find radical&nbsp; left-wing quotes here, but, let&#039;s&nbsp; keep&nbsp; on subject. The subject of this&nbsp; post&nbsp; was teh seening Pharoh-like deity&nbsp; treatment of Obama&nbsp; by the press and media in general. The posts&nbsp; I read, both pro and con,&nbsp; confirm my premise.
