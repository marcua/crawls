				<span style="font-family: Helvetica;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 14px;" class="bbc_size"> I am looking for someone to share the cost of my share in the Hellgate CSA (Community Supported Agriculture). I am a single person and it was always plenty enough for me. I would say that a couple could easily share a half of my share and it would be enough for them. I want to purchase an organic vegetable and fruit share- which would cost $13 a week. Although completely worth it, at a 28 week season the cost is $365 each. See the website for more information:http://www2.hellgatecsa.net/faq</span></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica;" class="bbc_font">[/size]<span style="font-size: 14px;" class="bbc_size">I did this last year and I ended up eating far healthier than I normally would. And imagine how many more nutrients are in produce sun-ripened and picked within a day vs. picked unripe and transported for weeks!It is very important that I find someone who is able to pick up for their fair share amount of times. Pick up is every Tuesday evening between 5:30 and 7:30 PM and we could work out a schedule of every other week unless one of us has something and needs to switch with the other. If we are both available we can just both go and split it up there. I live at 21st Ave and 31st St. Feel free to discuss CSAs in Astoria below but email me directly if you are interested or know of someone who would be. Thank you! meggan.r.miller@gmail.comEven if I find a share partner for myself I may be able to suggest you group with someone else so don&#039;t hesitate to email:)</span></span>
