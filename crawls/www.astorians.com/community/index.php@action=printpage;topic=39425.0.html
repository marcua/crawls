				Another example of big developers moving into the Queens/Astoria property market: The Related Companies are in talks to purchase the Marine Terrace Apartment complex between on Shore Boulevard and 21<sup>st</sup> Street.<br /><br />As part of the plan, 100 garages will be demolished and replaced with two rental buildings that will include housing for the homeless and veterans.<br /><br />http://therealdeal.com/2016/06/07/related-in-talks-to-buy-astoria-affordable-portfolio-for-115m/ (http://therealdeal.com/2016/06/07/related-in-talks-to-buy-astoria-affordable-portfolio-for-115m/)<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

				Roger that Braun. Sounds like the repeat of the unmitigated failure that is low income housing. The last thing we need.

The change of ownership of the small to medium sized apartment buildings is what&#039;s really driving the bigger demographic changes and it&#039;s largely behind the scene.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font"></span><br /><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">We&#039;ll see what happens.

				What a complete lack of empathy from people in this thread.<br /><br /><br />We don&#039;t want &quot;those people&quot; in our neighborhoods, they are someone else&#039;s problem. <br /><br /><br />I can&#039;t wait until this homeless shelter is built and sanitation garage moves to 20th avenue. Maybe it will get people in that part of Astoria off of their holier than thou high horses.
