				Well the noise of 33-08 Broadway is under control the street fights and blatant drug dealing is not.<br /><br />I woke up to a huge street fight at 3am and watched from my window as cops drove by and did nothing and innocent pedestrians timidly watched from a safe distance.<br /><br />Then I watched several men run up to cars, reach in to the passengers and walk away staring at a wad of cash.&nbsp; Since I have a birds eye view, I can see and hear all of these illegal BS that is ruining Astoria.<br /><br />What to do?

				I&#039;m sorry for you Toodles! I wouldn&#039;t be able to put up with it for more than a week. When I&#039;m rudely awakened by street noise I automatically wake up swinging. I hope you win this fight, but wouldn&#039;t blame you if you just throw the trowel in and move! The area in which you live is a business area? A lot of transients passing through, with no sense of affinity for the neighborhood. That&#039;s also the reason there&#039;s graffiti, trash, in other areas as reported in other threads. I&#039;d start saving my money to move. Not out of Astoria, but to a quieter part. Move to a block where a lot of older homeowners have set down roots and actually live in their homes. No guarantee, though. I think the likelihood of aggravation is more likely to occur the closer one lives to business districts: Ditmars, Steinway, or to a block where there is night-life (club). I live near the park and it&#039;s blissfully quiet in the winter, but forget about it from Spring through Fall. I have to sleep almost every night with earplugs, and have had to yell out the window often to people to pipe down. In your case the noise is year-round! Plus, you are dealing with more sinister characters, it seems. It&#039;s hard not to have a William &quot;D-Fens&quot; Foster moment. Remember the movie Falling Down?

				Thanks everyone! I never called 911 for anything, and since its really for life threatening emergencies, I will only call if I see weapons again.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mean to sound like a crochety old man, but really, some people pay a lot to live here and deserve a clean and quiet neighborhood.<br /><br />My rent is $425 a month to rent a bedroom in a beautiful apartment-I&#039;ve been blessed with this and I&#039;m not moving for awhile-gotta pay off student loans!<br /><br />I guess it comes with the area....I dunno, I thought Astoria was classier....<br /><br />You guys are awesome though!<br />

				I think Astoria in general is classy.&nbsp; The people that hang out at that club, fight in the streets, etc. definitely do not live here.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure some do, but the people I see hang around there I rarely see during the day.&nbsp; That kind of place brings in troublemakers from surrounding areas, all the more reason that it should be shut down.&nbsp;

				Calling 911 is a very important step and you should call when things get violent on the street - make sure there is a record.&nbsp; I think your idea of videotaping the fights is another really good suggestion and could help get it resolved.

				Call 911. If you&#039;re really that worried if you should or not, call 311 (the city&#039;s non emergency line), and explain the situation. I&#039;ll bet they tell you &quot;yeah, call 911.&quot;<br /><br />I once called the 114th precinct because someone vandalized my car and I wanted a report done (for a bunch of reasons), and when I called, they told me to call 911. I explained that it was just a smashed windshield, nothing was stolen or anything! It was still in the frame and everything, it just looked like someone jumped on my hood and kicked it/smashed it with a bat. I also explained again that it had happened overnight sometime, and it was late morning when I called, so it&#039;s not like someone was messing with my car right then. Again, they said, &quot;you need to call 911.&quot; So if an hours old smashed windshield is worth calling 911, a street fight and (what sounds like) drug deals are a no-brainer.

				I&#039;ve noticed when I walk by Ultra at night that it appears they&#039;ve changed bouncer staff.&nbsp; I wonder if these are also former 114th Precinct officers, which is one of the big problems we had with NuBar.&nbsp; It could also explain why the officers are loathe to cite the place.&nbsp; I do not know anything about the new staff.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s the same owners though.

				Hey Astorialuv you are a complaining whining uninformed liberal idiot. You are quick to jump on the cops and call IAB on them and blame everything on them. You seem to know a lot about the police. How about helping them? Point out the people that are doing wrong when the cops get there so the cops can make arrests. Cops work with the community. When cops roll up people scatter. Arriving patrol cars only see what they drive up on. Not the events that transpired before they got there. I can&#039;t stand listening to people like you. If you see so much drug dealing then maybe YOU are hanging out in the wrong spots. Maybe YOU should do something to help the police. Maybe if you move on a block with numerous bars and clubs then you asked for the noise. Maybe you should take pride in your neighborhood and start a neighborhood watch or show up to community board meetings. I am active on my block and we have no problems there.

				In my own defense, I am absolutely a liberal and sometimes an idiot, but definitely not uninformed and far from being a cop hater, I have a lot of respect for what they do and what they go through on an almost daily basis.&nbsp; However, if you read the posts carefully, it was not about police bashing; it was about the alleged action, or lack of action, by one or more specific, yet unidentified police officers.&nbsp; It was distressing to me, having worked with the 114th on community issues and investigated officers in the past for the city, to read about how these particular officers were supposedly watching a crime, in this case possibly multiple assaults, and not doing anything.&nbsp; I might have overreacted a little in my posts, however, as I stated before, I want to feel relatively safe in the Broadway area because I go to bars and restaurants in the area often and I would like to think the police would respond.<br /><br />And by the way, I didn&#039;t witness the gang assault and drug dealing on Broadway.&nbsp; I, personally, have never seen police officers not take action when there is an ongoing crime.&nbsp; However, if I did, I would report them and the crime to, by calling 911.&nbsp;

				AstoriaLuv it sounds as if you were an investigator for CCRB. Which is fine. Unfortunately most investigators never grew up in the city. And most investigators have never been on patrol with real cops. Maybe you would have a better understanding if you applied with the 114 pct to go on a ride along with a patrol car and saw what it was like for yourself and maybe give input to the officers. Your post earlier sounded to me like you saw the drug dealing yourself. I am sure that there are some cops that don&#039;t care but I am doubtful in this day and age that cops would sit and watch a fight on Bwy as security cameras (and digital cameras) are rolling. A cop cannot ignore a 911 call. It is all recorded and scrutinized. Cops care more than you think.

Cops care more than you think.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You&#039;re right, I was a CCRB investigator.&nbsp; And you are correct, I did not grow up in the city.&nbsp; I did, however, live in the city for almost 10 years before I took the job.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t go to &quot;stick it to the man&quot;; I worked there because I love investigations and I wanted to work for the city.&nbsp; <br /><br />In addition, I have done many ride alongs with different precincts and commands and more than most investigators, I worked closely with commanders, officers, and precinct personnel to make sure that police officers got a fair hearing in their cases.&nbsp; I am proud of the work that I did there and I believe, despite many obstacles and a lot of political BS, that both the citizen and the police officers were dealt with fairly in my own investigations.<br /><br />But getting back to your point regarding respect for the police officers, I did note that I have a lot of respect for what they do and I was not picking on the NYPD or the 114th.<br /><br /><br />

You are quick to jump on the cops and call IAB on them and blame everything on them. You seem to know a lot about the police. How about helping them? Point out the people that are doing wrong when the cops get there so the cops can make arrests. Cops work with the community. When cops roll up people scatter. Arriving patrol cars only see what they drive up on. Not the events that transpired before they got there. I can&#039;t stand listening to people like you. If you see so much drug dealing then maybe YOU are hanging out in the wrong spots. Maybe YOU should do something to help the police. Maybe if you move on a block with numerous bars and clubs then you asked for the noise. Maybe you should take pride in your neighborhood and start a neighborhood watch or show up to community board meetings. I am active on my block and we have no problems there.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wow! You are so out of line with this post. If you were familar with astorians at all, you would recognize that AstoriaLuv is actually one of the good guys who does care about his community. I think it is pretty apparent that he has a lot of pride in Astoria AND in police officers who do their jobs.&nbsp; :roll:

				I&#039;m also going to pipe in here because I know AstoriaLuv in real life and he comes out not just to our social gatherings but I have seen him at local functions and meetings, so I know first hand that he is involved in our community.&nbsp; You I don&#039;t know, in real life or on these boards, so I suggest you spend a little time in your own community, real or virtual, before you start picking fights with someone else.&nbsp; Just because you spelled Original Astorian in all caps doesn&#039;t mean I have to believe it.

				I would appreciate knowing the cross streets for the street fight that occured on Broadway.&nbsp; (I live just off B&#039;way and want to get a feel for where things like this happen.)

				Astoria luv I am sure you love this neighborhood and frequent the local bars and restaurants such as I do. But your first bit of advice should be for the public to work with the cops not to get their shield numbers to report them because you don&#039;t agree with their service provided.<br />&nbsp;<br />I stick up for cops. If they are wrong I will be the first to call them out on it. Cops are people too. Few are bad and most are good. It&#039;s too bad that the bad ones get all of the media attention. <br /><br />I see that you are well liked on this board but I am just stating my opinion. Maybe I was too quick with the keyboard after I read your post and should have refrained from the name calling. My bad. It sounded to me like you just wanted to sell out cops.
