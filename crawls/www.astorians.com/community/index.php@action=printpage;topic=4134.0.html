				Life is 100% unexpected&nbsp; &nbsp;:-o<br /><br />My father passed away two weeks ago&nbsp; :cry: and as I sat Shiva at my parents&#39; home, I decided it might be good to start looking for a job in California in order to be closer to my mom. <br /><br />What happened next is: I sent a resume sunday night, I got a call this past monday to interview, I interviewed monday afternoon, the job was mine tuesday afternoon<br /><br />when opportunity beckons, even under the worst of circumstances, you take what you&#39;re offered. <br /><br />so it&#39;s sudden, it might seemed rushed, but it&#39;s a good thing right now to be closer to home.<br /><br />That said, I&#39;ve loved my five months here in Astoria. I&#39;ve had opportunity to meet wonderfully warm, vibrant and creative people working hard to create a thriving online and offline community. I&#39;ve enjoyed this neighborhood and discovering its haunts through the eyes of the many online posters here at astorians.com. I&#39;ve enjoyed stuffing my face to food goodness from the Taco Roll to EATS to the social events we&#39;ve celebrated. It&#39;s been short but it&#39;s been very very sweet.<br /><br />thanks for understanding,<br />Miri
