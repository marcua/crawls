				<strong>Documentaries for the 99% - Sponsored by Occupy Astoria LIC</strong><br />www.OccupyAstoriaLIC.org (http://www.OccupyAstoriaLIC.org)<br />Feature Presentation - Tuesday 31 July, 6:30 PM<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: 2.65em;" class="bbc_size">Michelle Alexander: </span><span style="font-size: 2.65em;" class="bbc_size">&quot;The New Jim Crow&quot;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 1.35em;" class="bbc_size">Presented by Dr. Michelle Ronda, Professor of Sociology, Marymount Manhattan College</span><br />&nbsp;(http://chipbruce.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/the-new-jim-crow.png)<br /><br />“There are more African Americans under correctional control today—in prison or jail, on probation or parole—than were enslaved in 1850.” In this incisive presentation, former litigator turned legal scholar Michelle Alexander provocatively argues that we have not ended racial caste in America: we have simply redesigned it. The New Jim Crow is a stunning account of the rebirth of a caste-like system in the United States -one that has resulted in millions of African Americans locked behind bars and then relegated to a permanent second-class status. The New Jim Crow challenges the civil rights community—and all of us—to place mass incarceration at the forefront of a new movement for racial justice in America. (60 minutes)<br />The program will be presented by Michelle Ronda, Professor of Sociology, Marymount Manhattan College, a gifted teacher and lecturer.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><strong><span style="font-size: 1.35em;" class="bbc_size">All Are Welcome Tuesday Evening July 31!<br />DOORS OPEN AT 6:30PM, FILM STARTS AT 7PM<br />Speakers, Discussion, and Light Refreshments!<br />At Church of the Redeemer<br />30-14 Crescent Street at 30th Ave</span></strong>

				If we don&#039;t put them in prison, and leave them on streets, author would be coming to talk about book&nbsp; &quot;The Conspiracy to Leave Criminals on Streets in Minority Neighborhoods to Prey on Residents&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; Before 1960, prisons were largely of White inmate populations.&nbsp; Often over 90%.&nbsp; No one complained.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				JoeyC, have you read this book? Have you watched this film?<br /><br /><br /><br />I do wish you didn&#039;t make up what-ifs. You are not inside Michelle Alexander&#039;s head. You do not know what Michelle Alexander would be writing, if there was no drug war. You do not know what she would be writing, if African Americans were not disproportionately arrested and imprisoned, and given longer sentences compared to other groups. Your comment indicates a close-minded attitude - you already know it all, in advance of examination.&nbsp;<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry that you are so easily provoked by a blurb. It might be a good reason to consider ideas outside your comfort zone.&nbsp;Thanks for your comment.<br /><br /><br /><br />Everyone&#039;s invited to this free film, presentation and discussion. Open to the public!

				I will try to be there. But as you state that <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> <span style="font-family: Helvetica;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 14px;" class="bbc_size">The program will be presented by Michelle Ronda, Professor of Sociology, Marymount Manhattan College, a gifted teacher and lecturer. </span></span> </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Please let me know by whom Professor Ronda was gifted. <br />It seems like an interesting discussion, but the answer looks like it is preordained.&nbsp; Will there be a Q&amp;A or just a lecture? The idea that there is&nbsp; a &quot;new Jim Crow&quot; really plays to the audience with no concept of actual history and how it pertains to modern day politics.

				Sweeper, there&#039;s no need to be sarcastic or hostile if we choose to describe our speakers as gifted. In Prof. Ronda&#039;s case, it happens to be true.<br /><br /><br />Have you been to any of our film events? Have you received reports from anyone who was at one of our events? If you have not, then by what process were you able to decide that our audience has &quot;no concept of actual history&quot; ? Isn&#039;t that an example of a preordained answer?&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Our events always include lively discussion, not just Q&amp;A. Discussion and debate are the point, since after all people can nowadays watch movies anywhere and anytime. We intentionally choose films of a length that allows more time for people to talk. All we expect is for people to show the same respect for speakers and organizers as at at any other event of this kind.&nbsp;<br /><br />

				Although this event is open to the public, and everyone is welcome, I should clarify that Alexander, in the introduction to her book on &quot;Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness,&quot; is clear that the intended audiences for the thesis and data therein are people who care about racial and social justice in the US today.&nbsp; Sometimes &quot;preaching to the choir&quot; is a goal rather than a critique (at least the history of successful social movements tells us so).<br />Alexander once believed that to equate mass incarceration with slavery or Jim Crow was hyperbole that would only damage a movement for equity in punishment, but her own research and engagement with data led her to a different view. As a discussant, I will pose some questions following the video viewing of Alexander&#039;s lecture on her book (whether I am gifted as a discussant seems wholly irrelevant to me given the format).<br />If you are interested in learning more about incarceration in the US and more about Alexander&#039;s argument on racialized social control, I hope you will join us.
