				<br />I am excited that a fine fellow has published his first novel, for readers young and old. My hope is to read a copy soon and share a review. If anyone may be interested in a signed-copy, I could check into that.<br />&nbsp;** Fishing? Ugh.**<br />For info-<br /><br />http://www.eastriverpress.com/book.html<br /><br />http://www.eastriverpress.com/author.html<br /><br />&quot;Twelve-year-old Mark Hoffman disrespects authority, cuts class at every opportunity, and suspects he knows better than nearly every adult in Walton, New York. He may be rightâ€”he is, after all, one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the community. As the co-founder of the phenomenally popular Desserts Express, Mark and his hilarious friends just might revitalize their dying hometown, if only the grown-ups would stop arresting them and shutting down their businesses.<br /><br />The Walton Street Tycoons is a young adult novel about the friendships and misadventures of an extraordinary group of pre-teen capitalists. Mark and his friends confront the challenges of a corrupt small-town government, condescending teachers and parents, and the onset of girl trouble. Themes of freedom and individualism underscore a fast-paced, humorous narrative filled with food fights, practical jokes and the quest for a perfect day of fishing.&quot;<br /><br />**<br /><br />&quot;Like the heroes of <strong>The Walton Street Tycoons</strong>, &nbsp;Jim Lesczynski grew up wanting to be wealthy and powerful. Unfortunately, he lacked their drive and ambition, so he became a writer instead. He has been writing and editing full-time for the last 20 years, mostly for the financial services industry. In his spare time, he is a relatively well-known libertarian activist, whose controversial and politically incorrect bits of street theater have led to interviews and features on The Daily Show, News Night with Aaron Browne, Wolf Blitzer Reports, dozens of talk radio programs, and in newspapers around the world.<br /><br />Most recently, Jim is the editor and publisher of Serf City, a free tabloid newspaper covering New York politics from a libertarian perspective. He has published articles in The New York Sun and in various online publications such as The Libertarian Enterprise and Rash Magazine.<br /><br />Jim lives in New York City with his wife and <del>two</del> three daughters. <br />This is his first novel.&quot;
