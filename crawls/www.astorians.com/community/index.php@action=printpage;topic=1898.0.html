				Meg, I knew I could count on you! I&#39;m now spending my entire workday tracking down different leads I got off that link, both absinthe, cheap bistros, ice cream, everything! THANKS! And yes, I&#39;ve followed Clotilde&#39;s choc&amp;zucchini but had forgotten about its utility until you had mentioned it awhile ago. And don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve still got that Camembert du Normandie on my list to bring back!!<br />If you think of anything else, feel free to email me!<br /><br />A bientot!<br />a

				Annie,&nbsp; I will have to go searching when i get home. a recent new yorker magazine did an interview with a guy living and working in Paris, working on recreating the original version of the stuff. He listed the companies making it today and his opinions on them.&nbsp; Let you know tonight.<br /><br />

				Jonathan, I know the guy you&#39;re talking about.&nbsp; There was a TV program all about absinth not too long ago, but I&#39;m blanking on what it was.&nbsp; D&#39;OH!&nbsp; It might have been Anthony Bordain.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, I think it was.&nbsp; He was searching out Absynth in Europe, and found the American expert, who relocated to Europe, spending his days researching and recreating absynth formulas.

				Merci boucoup, Astorians! You guys always come through for me. I have undertaken a crash course in absinthe today and found that ironically, in its most potent form, its prohibited from sale in France but that there are a lot of companies now that are authorized to make it IN France for export ONLY. Weird. I&#39;ve got the lead on that bistro that Meg found... otherwise I think we&#39;ll have to find some bootleg and swig it on the banks of the Seine? ha!<br /><br />In other pertinent news: YES I am endeavoring to be a Cheese Smuggler. Jayme, your expertise here is higly valued. From what I can find, its illegal to bring in anything thats not aged at least 60 days. Which is why the raw milk ones are outlawed. Most people say that I should:<br />1) rip the labels off (so that the Customs dupes dont see &quot;raw&quot; written anywhere)<br />2) have them vaccum-sealed or else Ziplock-baggie them<br />3) hide the in the checked baggage<br />4) NOT declare.<br />So this last part is the only one that seems questionable. Isnt it smarter to declare that I&#39;ve got some &quot;semi-hard&quot; cheeses that are &quot;aged more than 60 days&quot; because:<br />(a) these are technically legal, and<br />(b) the Customs dupes cant tell the difference between cheeses.<br /><br />Anyone know what the best smuggling technique is?<br /><br />faithfully,<br />Your Cheese Mule

				What I&#39;ve been doing for the past few years is declaring that I have food, and make sure I have enough boring stuff* so that their eyes glaze over before you get to anything remotely interesting, they cut to the chase and say, &quot;do you have any meat?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Have you been on a farm?&quot; &quot;Do you have any vegetables?&quot;&nbsp; I look very serious and shocked and say, &quot;no, no, no,&quot; very patiently.&nbsp; Then they say have a nice day and wave me on.<br /><br />I know that Jayme just didn&#39;t declare anything, so that can work, too.&nbsp; That&#39;s what I used to do.&nbsp; Not sure why I switched.&nbsp; Jeffrey Steingarten believes firmly that at JFK, they don&#39;t care about the raw cheese issue.&nbsp; He always declares in large capital letters on his customs form that he has &quot;RAW MILK CHEESE (AGED LESS THAN 60 DAYS).&nbsp; He&#39;s never been stopped, and I doubt it&#39;s because he&#39;s batted his eyelashes.<br /><br />*coming back from Mexico, this consists of hot sauce, tortilla chips, spicy potato chips, and tequila.&nbsp; Oh, and raw fish, which is allowed, at least from Baja, if you catch it yourself.&nbsp; Not that I bring back Camembert from Mexico, but there&#39;s been random things.&nbsp; Coming back from England, it begins with Marmite and lemon curd, and proceeds through tea and biscuits.&nbsp; I never even got to the Harrod&#39;s chocolates, and I sailed through with my fine raw milk cheeses.&nbsp; I have not yet used this technique coming back from France, but I&#39;ve used it successfully at LAX and JFK.

				Great!! Thanks Laura and everyone else for your sharing your smuggling expertise and experiences..<br /><br />&nbsp;I think I&#39;m going to use an amalgam of many techniques: declaring everything BUT the raw milk cheeses. Between the baked goods and the wines and the hard aged cheeses, I&#39;m confident now that the smelly yummy culprits will slide right on through.<br />See you all when we return! (or else you&#39;ll hear about our detention and full body cavity search at JFK.. ack!)<br /><br />salut,<br />annie

				Ah, Paris. You guys just brought back a memory of returning to NY w/ a suitcase stuffed with bottles. It went through the X-ray machine and the guy watching the monitor simply muttered, &quot;Ca va boire.&quot; Loosely translated, that means, &quot;There&#39;s gonna be a lot of drinking.&quot; Nothing was confiscated........then again, bottles of booze aren&#39;t exactly contraband.<br /><br />French food makes me think it&#39;s possible to die from pure pleasure. Hope you guys have an amazing trip!<br /><br />
