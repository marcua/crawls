				Rotten Tomatoes:<br /><br />http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10009599-alice_in_wonderland/<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve been looking forward to seeing this since I haven&#039;t been to the movies in ages. I think the last film I saw was &quot;Up&quot; in 3D at the thee-ater.<br />Based on the above reviews (almost 50:50) I&#039;m not planning on being the first in line for tickets, but isn&#039;t everything better in 3D?<br /><br />&quot;Consensus: Tim Burton&#039;s Alice sacrifices the book&#039;s minimal narrative coherence -- and much of its heart -- but it&#039;s an undeniable visual treat.&quot;

				I saw it at midnight last night as I&#039;m a HUGE Tim Burton fan.&nbsp; I gave it an 8 out of 10.<br /><br />Personally, though, I found the 3D to be a little distracting since it was originally filmed in 2D then converted.&nbsp; It would be perfect to see on an IMAX in 2D but was still a decent film overall.

				My vote goes to 2D IMAX, especially if it wasn&#039;t originally filmed with the intention of being 3D. <br /><br />I didn&#039;t see Alice, but I did see Avatar in 3D and I didn&#039;t really feel like it enhanced my viewing experience. If anything, it hampered it because the grey lenses of the polarized 3D glasses dulled the colors of the film.

				My better half and I saw the non-3D version yesterday. We liked it, though not at first. About mid-way through<br />we got more into it and we both liked the ending.<br /><br />I also don&#039;t think it&#039;s great for very young children. A couple started crying in our audience yesterday.<br /><br />Visually, I was happy not to see in 3D. I find 3D distracting and overwhelming at times. I saw both versions<br />of Avatar and preferred the non-3D. <br /><br />Favorite character in Alice though is Helena Bonham Carter&#039;s Red Queen - she&#039;s hilarious.<br />And the makeup on her and Johnny Depp is wonderful.

				I saw it in 3D and it looked fine, but I didn&#039;t think it was a very good movie.&nbsp; It dragged a lot, IMO.
