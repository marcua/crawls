There were even a couple of people who were claiming to be American Indians, or rather for the P.C. people, &quot;Native Americans&quot;, who took offense at his characterizations of the Indians, and the fact they spoke Yiddish and were played by Jews, specifically that the Indian &quot;chief&quot; was played by Mel himself.

				&quot;If you&#039;re gonna steal from Terry Benedict, you&#039;d better goddamn know. This sort of thing used to be civilized. You&#039;d hit a guy, he&#039;d whack you, done. But with Benedict... at the end of this, he&#039;d better not know you&#039;re involved, not know your names, or think you&#039;re dead.

				From &quot;Office Space&quot; one of my all time favorite movies...<br /><br />Bob Porter : Looks like you&#039;ve been missing a lot of work lately. <br />Peter Gibbons: I wouldn&#039;t say I&#039;ve been *missing* it, Bob. <br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Peter Gibbons: So I was sitting in my cubicle today, and I realized, ever since I started working, every single day of my life has been worse than the day before it. So that means that every single day that you see me, that&#039;s on the worst day of my life. <br />Dr. Swanson: What about today? Is today the worst day of your life? <br />Peter Gibbons: Yeah. <br />Dr. Swanson: Wow, that&#039;s messed up. <br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Bob Slydell: You see, what we&#039;re actually trying to do here is, we&#039;re trying to get a feel for how people spend their day at work... so, if you would, would you walk us through a typical day, for you? <br />Peter Gibbons: Yeah. <br />Bob Slydell: Great. <br />Peter Gibbons: Well, I generally come in at least fifteen minutes late, ah, I use the side door - that way Lumbergh can&#039;t see me, heh heh - and, uh, after that I just sorta space out for about an hour. <br />Bob Porter: Da-uh? Space out? <br />Peter Gibbons: Yeah, I just stare at my desk; but it looks like I&#039;m working. I do that for probably another hour after lunch, too. I&#039;d say in a given week I probably only do about fifteen minutes of real, actual, work. <br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Bob Slydell: I&#039;d like to move us right along to a Peter Gibbons. Now we had a chance to meet this young man, and boy that&#039;s just a straight shooter with upper management written all over him.
