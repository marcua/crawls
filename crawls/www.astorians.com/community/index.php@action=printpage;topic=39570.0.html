				This morning I noticed that some of the benches by ditmars and 31st street have been removed.&nbsp; the one by the bus stop was replaced by a metal bench with no back on it.&nbsp; I used to like the benches.&nbsp; Now there isn&#039;t anywhere to sit.&nbsp; This isn&#039;t an improvement to me and the benches without backs are very uncomfortable to sit on.

				I think uncomfortable is the point.&nbsp; Backless or benches with armrests placed so that people must sit up are used for a reason.&nbsp; They&#039;re meant to take a load off or just to sit briefly waiting for a bus.&nbsp; Not to spend the day or night.

				Homeless still manage to lay down on benches even with armrests so that doesn&#039;t help.&nbsp; Anyway, I think there should be more benches.&nbsp; Now there isn&#039;t any bench at all where the mister softee truck usually stands.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t notice if the benches by Starbucks are still there.&nbsp; I hope so

				I found those benches to attract a very unsavory element that mills around the Ditmars station. I&#039;m glad they are gone.

				I miss those benches.&nbsp; A lot of the seniors used them and everyone who sat there wasn&#039;t an unsavory element.&nbsp; Those benches were there for years.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived here for 22 years and they were there when I moved here.&nbsp; I feel that the benches give the area a sense of community.&nbsp; If you get a coffee from dunkin donuts you could go outside and sit on the bench and drink it.&nbsp; When I get a slice of pizza from Rose and Joes I used to go outside and sit on a bench to eat it because there isn&#039;t anywhere to sit in there.&nbsp; I would like to know whose idea it was to remove the benches.&nbsp; There must have been at least 8 benches and now there is only one to take their place.&nbsp; Also the bus stop by Pizza Palace doesn&#039;t have a bus enclosure on the bus stop and the bench where people used to sit to wait for the bus is gone.&nbsp; I repeat that this was very wrong.&nbsp; There are benches on Steinway because it&#039;s a shopping area.&nbsp; Well Ditmars is a shopping area too.

				I hear ya. They weren&#039;t exclusively used by vagrants but they were enough that I would never sit on them. I agree that instead of removing the seats they should have removed the drunk/druggie/criminal element. of course that would require the 114 getting off their Facebook pages. Not likely.

				Homeless don&#039;t care about benches.&nbsp; They sit on the ground.&nbsp; I see beggars sitting in front of Key Food and other places on 31st St. near Ditmars.&nbsp; Like I said before, I would really like to know whose idea it was to remove the benches.&nbsp; I would like to know if they asked the people who live here if they thought it was something they wanted to do.

				You like to call people names like losers.&nbsp; Why is that?&nbsp; And I&#039;m doing just fine taking the W train.&nbsp; I dont&#039; even have to wait for it.&nbsp; It&#039;s waiting for me at the Ditmars platform and going home from Rector Street it came very quickly 2 days in a row.&nbsp; Don&#039;t you have anything nice to say?&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t seem that way.&nbsp; Everything you say is negative.

				Benches are a public amenity that shouldn&#039;t be taken away without some community input.<br /><br /><br />If there is a problem with vagrants camping out at the benches it should be reported to and handled by the NYPD.&nbsp; Since we&#039;re in a relatively low crime area someone at the precinct must have some time.

				Has anyone walked through the newly renovated Hoyt Playground (across from Neptune Diner)? I think they did a great job with the space.&nbsp; Notice all the new benches.&nbsp; They&#039;re made of a composite material but they look like wood.&nbsp; They have armrests set apart so the benches aren&#039;t vagrant-friendly.&nbsp; They would look attractive if they were placed around town in sensible spots.&nbsp; Maybe the benches that were removed are going to eventually be replaced with this model or something else?

				This morning as I was walking to the train I saw some new shiny silver benches they put to replace the old ones that they removed.&nbsp; It&#039;s the same bench as the one in front of the library on 31st St.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if they were all replaced.&nbsp; I&#039;m very happy about this.
