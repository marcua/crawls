				I know we have Jujube Tree but I would like to see more vegetarian places. I&#039;m not vegetarian, but sometimes would like more options. I know most menus have vegetarian choices but I think we could use a few more. I&#039;m thinking something like Angelica kitchen on LES

				<br />West Indian (I&#039;m not aware of anyplace in the nabe to get oxtail, which I love!&nbsp; I think I heard there may be such a place over around 14th Street and maybe 36th Ave., but that&#039;s way on the other side of Astoria for me...<br /><br />I&#039;d also love a takeout Puerto Rican place so I can get my pernil y mofongo on!&nbsp; ;-)<br /><br />And yes, as others said...a true vegetarian place.&nbsp; I happen to love Caravan of Dreams in the EV.&nbsp; Would love something like that!!<br /><br />Oh, and a homemade ice cream place (or is that asking too much?... ;-)&nbsp;
