				Hey folks,<br /><br />I currently have broadband internet through Time Warner Cable, but I do not have Cable TV.&nbsp; I am thinking of getting cable/satellite tv with HBO and DVR.&nbsp; Does anyone have any strong feelings between Time Warner Cable and Direct TV satellite?&nbsp; Are there other companies I should explore (satellite, that is -- I think TW has a monopoly in my area on cable)?<br /><br />As far as I can tell, satellite is cheaper by about $15-20/month and has better DVR (200 hours vs. 60 hours recordable), but I would need to sign a year contract for satellite.&nbsp; There is no contract with cable.<br /><br />Any thougts would be greatly appreciated!<br /><br />All the best,<br />Adam<br />

				We got DirectTV back in 2001, and the Tivo box about 2 years later. We absolutely love it and I seriously don&#39;t know how we&#39;d live without it! The channel selection is wonderful and I won&#39;t even get into how much a DVR changes your life.&nbsp; &nbsp;:lol:<br /><br />The only thing I would warn you about is the actual hookup itself. If no one else in your building has DirectTV, make sure you clear it with your landlord or coop board first. The techs that came out to install it back in 2001 drilled a hole in the street facing wall, with a thick white wire that goes from the roof to my apartment. When we added Tivo a couple years later, they had to drill yet another hole with a wire in the same spot. (I also have heard that if you plan on getting DirectTV in HD that will add yet <em>another </em>hole/wire...) The sound and vibration of the drill cutting through brick was enough to set off a car alarm right outside and caused the neighborhood dogs to freak out.&nbsp; :|&nbsp; Thank god I have an understanding landlord! I called them up about a year ago and asked if there was maybe another way to install it so that the cables didn&#39;t have to run down the front of the building, but they didn&#39;t seem to think there were any other options...maybe I just had a bad customer service rep that day?<br /><br />Also, a couple years ago we intended to move, so in my calling around to various real estate agents, I asked if getting a DirectTV hookup would be a problem in most buildings. All of the agents said satellite hookups are pretty tough to get a landlord to permit. Maybe things have changed in the past couple years, though.<br /><br />All that being said, if you can get DirectTV, I highly recommend it.

				I grew up with Direct TV at home and was always getting frustrated because it would go out often either due to weather, clouds, what have you. Since I moved out of my parents, I have always had Digital Cable (with HBO &amp; DVR), and have been very pleased. I rarely ever have problems, definitely not as frustrated as I was with Direct TV.<br /><br />A plus to Cable, you get your local channels at no extra cost, unlike Direct TV.<br />Besides, not so many holes either!&nbsp; The cable can go through any spot, rather than a specific corner of the building for the dish.<br /><br />As far as Tivo and DVR is concerned, they pretty much work the same for both platforms. It is a definitely a &quot;requirement&quot; nowadays. Besides, I think there is no sense in paying for the channel selection without having some sort of recorder.

				i refer to my satellite as stuttervision.<br />there is also a whole on the street facing wall which my landlord flipped out about apparantly. the dish predates me living in the apartment and although i would love to get cable the drama the original roomies went through to get the Dish is apparantly not worth it to switch. eh whatever...i&#39;m probably moving out in a few months and &quot;Hello Cable!&quot;

				Direct TV now makes you get a signed letter from your landlord stating that you&#39;re allowed to put up the satellite.&nbsp; Apparently, they were getting sued left and right from angry landlords.&nbsp; My landlord refused, and that&#39;s how I ended up with cable.&nbsp; And yeah, it&#39;s better.

				Thanks for all the responses!&nbsp; Especially to Angastoria for the RCN mention...I think that&#39;s what I&#39;m going with.&nbsp; In fact, I have already set up an appointment on Saturday to install.&nbsp; If anyone&#39;s interested, here was my thinking:<br /><br />Prices include estimated tax &amp; fees<br /><br />TIME WARNER<br />$125/month for Internet, Digital Cable with DVR and HBO<br />Pro: Convenient as I&#39;m already an internet customer<br />Con: Priciest of 3 options<br /><br />DIRECT TV<br />$70/month for Digital Satellite TV with DVR and Showtime (still would have to pay $42/month for TWC internet)<br />Pro: Cheaper than Cable ($112 vs. $125 after internet), extra premium channel, better DVR (200 hours vs. 60 on TWC)<br />Con: 1 year commitment required, no OnDemand, possible outages with storms/wind<br /><br />RCN<br />$120/month for Internet (supposedly faster than TWC), Digital Cable with DVR and ALL premium channels<br />Pro: Much more programming for less than TWC, better DVR (100 hours vs. 60 on TWC)<br />Con: New installation, some people have disliked their layout (but I hear they changed it this month)<br /><br />Of course, I could be proven wrong and RCN could suck, but I&#39;m willing to try it for virtually no risk.&nbsp; At the moment, it seems clear that RCN is the way to go.&nbsp; Again, thanks so much for the feedback, and I&#39;ll let you know how it goes.

				I just remembered the tv in the living room has the antenna from which we only get broadcast channels, but my roommate has her TV plugged into the cable jack (but we don&#39;t pay for any service) and we get select channels for free; a dozen or so.&nbsp; Sorry...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=4542.msg46840.html#msg46840">Quote from: eblack on January 08, 2007, 12:56:07 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Josh is a LIAR!!!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I wanted to throw in my $0.02 even though it seems like this has already been pretty well researched. I see a lot about Direct TV but I have Dish Network and I love it. I used to have cable when I was in Brooklyn (Time Warner) and found it went out all the time and with no explanation. Could have just been my building, but the customer service situation at TW while I was dealing with those problems made me swear them off permanently.<br /><br />I looked into both Dish Network and Direct TV and found they had pretty similar deals at the time. I&#39;ve been with Dish Network for about 2 yrs now and have found them to be really fantastic. And yeah, during SEVERE weather, the dish will occasionally go out, but it&#39;s always back on shortly -- whereas I found with cable I had no idea when it would go out or would be back on and often had to schedule some tech person to come out and fix it.<br /><br />My landlord had to okay the installation of the dish - but I&#39;ve had two separate landlords okay this without any hassle. Been lucky I guess? And yeah, sometimes I miss NY1.
