				Hi everyone,<br />Did anyone hear a loud boom type of sizzling sound and lights flicker around Steinway and 30th avenue?<br />That&#039;s what happened to me. I woke up around 3 am , went to kitchen and came back to my bed to sleep.<br />After 30 or 40 min just laying down with lights off in my room there was a flash of lights coming from my window which is right across me and I heard that boom sound like helicopters were running into my window.<br />I didn&#039;t see anything. I was scared for a second and just stayed in my bed. Then I got up and looked through the window but everything looked fine. Please let me know if you noticed something like that.

Well at about 5:30 I heard a really loud noise that just got louder and louder.&nbsp; It didn&#039;t sound like a helicopter.&nbsp; Well I looked out the window and up at the sky and then I saw and heard what looked like a military plane flying extremely low right over my building.&nbsp; All I could say was Oh My God!&nbsp; I never saw anything like this before in a residential area. Did anybody else see this?

				Sounds like a joint effort of police on the ground with helicopters searching for a suspect. I haven&#039;t heard any&nbsp; news about your incident though.
