				Title: <strong>31st Avenue</strong><br />

				Hi<br />I am looking to study the history of 31st avenue in Queens and related cross streets like Astoria Blvd, Ditmars Blvd, Crescent and Vernon Blvd. I have already taken a lot of pictures of old buildings, such as the Piano Factory, but am looking to get as much history as possible on this avenue from Vernon Blvd to College Point. I have already contacted the Greater Astoria Historical Society and pulled articles and book references on this avenue.<br /><br />What I am particularly looking for are good and reliable sources of historical materials, old photos from 1800 on, videos of course, links to any references about the Avenue. I also need to know why Ditmars Blvd ends at 82nd Street, starts again at 86th street, and why 31st Avenue breaks off at 103rd street and restarts on the other side of Astoria Blvd at 105th street. A useful overview of the Philadelphia Plan would also be helpful<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Neil

				31st Avenue was extended as Jackson Heights and East Elmhurst was developed, much of that development did not occur until the late 1950s. The break off occurs because the side of East Elmhurst north of Astoria Boulevard was developed first as many wealthy blacks purchased residences over there which happened during the early 20th century. Ditmars Boulevard was initially planned to go out to Flushing Bay but the development of LaGuardia Airport got in its was which is why Ditmars Boulevard is the way it was. Otherwise Ditmars Boulevard would have run out to Flushing Bay.

				Thanks this is very helpful. Do you know why 31st Avenue gets cut off between 103 and 105th street in each side of Astoria Blvd. Also can you refer me to sources that I can use to document your answer? I am planning to do a website on 31st Avenue and an article, where i must also document/footnote the information. In that I must also include the history of Ditmars Blvd as well as Astoria Blvd.<br /><br />Once again, thank you very much. Are you a local historian or interested on the history of the various streets and avenues?<br /><br />Neil

				Thanks. Are you in politics. I see your note. You have a great memory. I&#039;d like to know more about you. Are you by chance a member of the Greater Astoria Historical Society?<br />Thanks,<br />Neil

				Go to the Queens Borough Library. There is plenty of information on your topic there.

				The avenue will prove more obscure than many of the roads that adjoin or intersect.&nbsp; As late as the 1970s, perhaps beyond, old-timers in Astoria were still heard to use its former name, Jamaica Avenue.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t named because of its destination like Flushing Avenue (today&#039;s Astoria Blvd.) or Newtown Rd (bound for what later came to be known as Elmhurst).&nbsp; Where I refer to 31st Avenue below, you should keep in mind that Jamaica Avenue would show on early maps and atlases.&nbsp; Before the days when Astoria became part of Long Island City (1870), much of the avenue was little more than a contrivance for encouraging sale and development of newly established building lots.&nbsp; As a &quot;new&quot; stretch, its eastward march up from the river arose from a line on the map, not as a product of passage or boundary.&nbsp; From inception, it was made to &quot;square up&quot; with existing parallel roads, and didn’t undergo the kind of straightening and grading that older roads required.&nbsp; If you haven&#039;t already done so, and are so inclined, you might consider a two-step project that you can pursue independently.&nbsp; First walk the length from the river to the jagged cross of Astoria Blvd., then do some surprisingly easy internet research.<br /><br />You’ll see much more than described in the highlights to follow, but landmarks and other visual cues will help when sitting at your computer.<br /><br />The piano factory is already familiar to you, and Sohmer had the East River, not the avenue, in mind when considering his transportation options.&nbsp; As you approach and cross 21st Street, most of the frame houses and a few of the brick houses date from the “Jamaica Avenue” era and undoubtedly once bore three-digit house numbers in the 100-260 range as they progressed towards Crescent Street.&nbsp; Crossing Crescent Street note how the avenue widens.&nbsp; The section was developed as a district of large homes on large lots, continuing to 32nd Street, crossing 31st Street’s one-time horse-car, and later, trolley tracks.&nbsp; Postcards survive depicting a handsome, planted median dividing the stretch.&nbsp; Climbing the avenue towards Steinway, note the pair of adjoining apartment buildings on the 30th Ave. (north) side from 36th to 37th Streets.&nbsp; They were significantly more high tone than the Astoria apartment building that later came to predominate.&nbsp; Note the fine home on the Broadway (south) side on the far corner of 38th Street.&nbsp; Surviving postcards show it from way back, and a 1909 atlas indicates it to be the solitary brick structure in the long stretch from 33rd Street to just short of 44th Street.<br /><br />At 44th Street the avenue crosses the ancient Newtown Rd, a survivor of the colonial era.&nbsp; As it makes its way towards the one-time “city line” of Long Island City, the “cutting through” of the avenue was part of an obliteration of an original, but largely incomplete, alternate grid that I understand to have been the creation of the German Cabinetmakers Association.&nbsp; The most recognizable vestige of the grid near your route is visible on the 46th Street side of 45th Street between 31st Avenue and Newtown Rd, where you’ll find a former street that abides the abandoned plan.&nbsp; The peculiar lot shapes on the irregularly shaped block on the other side of 45th Street (back towards 44th) also date from the former layout that aimed to fit the pattern suggested by Newtown Road and the long-obliterated Ridge Road.<br /><br />In its early years, the stretch of the avenue that continued eastward was truly laid out through the hinterlands.&nbsp; Bryant High and PS 151 appear in surviving photographs, seen from blocks away like improbable pieces of urban density in the midst of open country.&nbsp; As you arrive at roughly 51st Street, you cross the line of another road from colonial days.&nbsp; Bowery Bay Road took travelers from Woodside to the waterfront, and also marked the boundary of Long Island City, where mapmakers rested and allowed the town of Newtown to plan the further reaches of 31st Avenue.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Since I’ve probably overtaxed the Astoria-centric interests of the audience and abused the privilege of sharing this by exceeding my allotment, we’ll pick up the pace a bit.&nbsp; The sidewalk that runs the entire 31st Avenue frontage of Boulevard Gardens has things worth seeing if you keep your nose down.&nbsp; Granite distance markers – too near one another to earn the name milestones – are embedded in the concrete.&nbsp; I know nothing about their origin or purpose, and you’d make a mighty contribution if your research uncovers the story.&nbsp; The “change of course” that the avenue has taken after crossing 51st Street brings it into alignment with a grid whose spine is Northern Blvd.&nbsp; This diversion was at first a brief one, for the avenue at this point was only a couple of blocks long, marking the northern boundary of a small district originally laid out and parceled into lots by 19th-century cousins of the German Cabinetmakers.&nbsp; Around 1871 the Bricklayers Cooperative Building &amp; Loan Association named their creation Charlotteville.&nbsp; It is doubtful that any single home was erected along 31st Avenue at the time.&nbsp; <br /><br />The next mile or so was a soggy and seldom-visited backwater until the era described in Clearview’s earlier post.&nbsp; Take note of the sudden and seemingly inexplicable alignment of lots at the corners of 79th and 81st Streets.&nbsp; Here you reach a point intersecting a now-obliterated ancient road.&nbsp; Astonishing photographs exist of the district (see below).&nbsp; Further along you’ll arrive at another point at which the avenue crossed the ancient Jackson Mill Rd, but surviving evidence is scarce.&nbsp; This area is treated in the usual delightful way here: http://www.forgotten-ny.com/TROLLEYS/jackson.mill/jacksonmill.html<br /><br />When at last we arrive at the curiosity of the jagged leap across Astoria Blvd, you see the limits that even the most energetic mapmaker and dutiful engineer must recognize.&nbsp; The grids on the opposing sides of Astoria Blvd can’t be reconciled, and occupied lots on both sides would have been arguments against a more zealous forcing of the right of way.<br /><br />Internet investigations should include New York Public Library’s (NYPL) Digital Gallery and the LaGuardia &amp; Wagner Archives (photographic section) of the LaGuardia division of CUNY.&nbsp; With embedded quotes search for 31st Avenue.&nbsp; At times a search of a cross street or a parallel street will reward you with a view of 31st Avenue, particularly when made before buildings blocked the view.&nbsp; Search newspaper websites (Library of Congress’s Chronicling America is good) for “Jamaica Ave” with Astoria and you’ll come across the occasional story.&nbsp; Same goes for searching the vast electronic catalogue of books through Google.&nbsp; The NYPL device has a great treasure of maps that can be enlarged to reveal fine detail.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t a snap to find what you&#039;re looking for.&nbsp; Start with searches like Atlas Astoria, Atlas &quot;Long Island City&quot;, etc.<br /><br />Since the great run of 31st Avenue was never a thoroughfare, never was the “center” of anything, and ran through territory largely unremarkable before and since its creation, you’ll find less than you will for better known roads nearby.<br /><br />Good luck.<br />
