				The Astoria Park Alliance is proud to present our third annual Astoria Park Shore Fest (formerly Astoria Water Walk) this August. In partnership with Green Shores NYC, Astoria Music and Arts, the NYC Department of Parks &amp; Recreation and NYC Department of Transportation, this event includes a variety of activities occurring along Shore Boulevard, bridging the many amenities of Astoria Park with the adjacent waterfront and our diverse, vibrant community.&nbsp; Scheduled events include educational activities, a food tasting with neighborhood restaurants, music from Astoria-based artists covering a wide range of genres and more.<br />&nbsp;<br />The Astoria Park Shore Fest will occur on August 7, 14 and 21 (all Sundays) between 1 and 6:30 PM, with activities along Shore Boulevard.&nbsp; (Shore Boulevard will be closed to vehicular traffic on these dates.)&nbsp; This year, we are also partnering with Astoria Music &amp; Arts and their Astoria Music Now! Festival for a day of music from local bands throughout Astoria Park on August 21.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Astoria Park Alliance is a community organization made up completely of fellow Astorians who volunteer their time to support our neighborhood and strengthen this community landmark.&nbsp; Staging an event like this comes with a substantial cost, and we are asking for any support our fellow community members can provide to help make this happen.&nbsp; All donations will be matched dollar for dollar by the North Star&#039;s Greening Western Queens Fund!&nbsp; The link below provides more information on how you can donate to support the Astoria Park Shore Fest.<br />&nbsp;<br />https://ioby.org/project/support-car-free-programming-astoria-park-shore-fest (https://ioby.org/project/support-car-free-programming-astoria-park-shore-fest)<br />&nbsp;<br />For more information about Astoria Park Shore Fest, Astoria Park Alliance, or if you want to get involved, find us on Facebook:<br />http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=124029294345511 (http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=124029294345511)<br />The exact lineup for Astoria Park Shore Fest will come soon, and Facebook is the best way to stay informed about this event.<br />&nbsp;<br />Thank you for your support of this event, Astoria Park, and our great, diverse neighborhood.&nbsp; We look forward to seeing you this August!<br />&nbsp;
