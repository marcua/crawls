				I don&#039;t get overly excited for new places going in, but I&#039;m definitely eager for this one! I think it&#039;ll do well - pretty original for the area.

				Pretty sure it&#039;s never going to open.&nbsp; The last time I walked by it had a Notice of Seizure, indicating that the landlord had repossessed the space.<br /><br /><br />I think that space would have done really well for them.&nbsp; Quite unfortunate.

				Too bad. I had spoken with them at the Union Square holiday market and they were excited about opening a shop. They were still working out the details at that point. I noticed that they&#039;re not scheduled for Madison Square Eats this time, either. They usually had a stall there.

				IT OPENED!!!!! <br /><br /><br />They had some stuff go down with their landlord, but apparently persevered and it is in a &quot;soft&quot; opening as of Saturday (7/18).&nbsp; They have a limited menu for the next 2 weeks or so, as they get their operations going.<br /><br /><br />Wife and I stopped in and had the Give Thanks (turkey meatball, cranberry jelly and spicy feta) and a turkey meatball w/ jalapeno jelly (I love that jelly!).<br /><br /><br />If you&#039;re around, go show them some love.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure they&#039;d appreciate it after their travails.
