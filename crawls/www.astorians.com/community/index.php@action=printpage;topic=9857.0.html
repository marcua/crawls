				Museum of Moving Images is good but short. They can play free video games there too. At least that is what my 5 year old likes to do. If they like like swimming you can get a day pass at the new pool in Flushing. It doesn&#039;t cost anything for the kids and the pool is spectacular.

				If they&#039;re not too old for &quot;Horton Hears a Who?,&quot; that&#039;s out already. When my niece was in town, this was a great resource:<br /><br />http://gocitykids.parentsconnect.com/?area=197

				I would second NYCMacUser- ice skating and the Central Park Zoo would be wonderful.&nbsp; There is also a Children&#039;s Museum on the West side- 83rd Street, maybe?&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been (my girl is only 2), but I have heard good things.&nbsp; If you go to the Zoo, you can also go into FAO Schwartz, which would wow them, for sure.&nbsp; Have fun!

				thanks for all the ideas... we took it easy.&nbsp; Lunch at Jackson Hole Diner.&nbsp; Then we went to Socrates - and we were going to head to the playground at Astoria Park but it was bitter cold on the water.&nbsp; We went to a neighborhood playground for a while.&nbsp; Then headed home for Dance, Dance Revolution and Blokus.&nbsp; <br /><br />We were going to go to 5 Pointz - but totally forgot to go.&nbsp; D&#039;uh. <br /><br />

				Haha.. if I had time and broadband here at work, I would make a &quot;Michael Jackson&quot; screen name and tell you to send them to &quot;my&quot; place for babysitting.&nbsp; It would just take too darn long with the dial-up.<br /><br />The pool was a good idea, but I&#039;m guessing they&#039;ve swam before.&nbsp; I think something new that they might remember for a while would be better.<br /><br />Mac&#039;s idea of central park sounds pretty good. Did anyone suggest the Bronx Zoo?
