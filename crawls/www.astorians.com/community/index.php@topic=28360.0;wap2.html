			It was a spokesperson from Sanrio who said it.&nbsp; Somebody was writing down information for an exhibit on Hello Kitty and sent it to Sanrio to fact check it.&nbsp; Shockingly, Sanrio is adamant that Hello Kitty is not a cat, she&#039;s a little girl who lives in England.&nbsp; And she&#039;s a cartoon.&nbsp; But she is not a cat.&nbsp; No explanation for the fur, paws, whiskers, pointy ears....&nbsp; But the person who did the image of Kitty as a girl is a genius.
