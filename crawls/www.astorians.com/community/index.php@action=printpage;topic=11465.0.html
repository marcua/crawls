				So I went to look to buy at this place last summer, and passed on it (for reasons mentioned in other threads). However, I now see that they are doing rentals, and they are relatively well priced. I know a lot has been talked about this Pistelli place, but it seems to all concentrate on purchasing the apartments. Just curious how posters feel about renting here? 2 BRs with terrace was $2050, a very good sized 2BR with terrace was $2350. that&#039;s not too bad for Astoria. <br />P.S. They have listings on craigslist.<br /><br />

				Do you know if a broker is handling rentals?&nbsp; I&#039;d be curious about the price of one bedrooms.&nbsp; I looked several times and decided against buying.&nbsp; But I would consider renting while looking at other properties.&nbsp; I have a dog, though, and don&#039;t know about the building&#039;s pet policy.

				They have ads on Craigslist. Angelica is the real estate broker. do a search on astoria apartments on CL with &#039;jacuzzi and doorman&#039; and you should get her number.<br />She did ask me several times if I had pets, so I don&#039;t think pets are allowed.

				Just thought that you might want to hear from someone who lives at the Pistilli building on 24th Ave. Yes, I did see all the negative threads on this place and I do understand where some folks are coming from. The materials used aren&#039;t the most high end, but given that the rent and even the purchase prices are really low, it doesn&#039;t concern me. We do enjoy living here. We love having a huge balcony, great closet space for low rent. We came from Manhattan, the Financial district, so I know what it&#039;s like to pay high rent. The kitchens are small I&#039;ll agree, but given that I spend all day at work and when I get home I whip up something really quick for dinner, the space is good for us. It&#039;s still comparable to what we had in the city and we had a huge place in the city. But if I wanted a jacuzzi apartment in the city I would have been paying more than my initial 4,200 a month. We currently live in a spacious two bedroom, two bath for 2050, which is an amazing savings given that we live in front of an amazing park, with a free pool in the summer, we have a balcony, we have a jacuzzi, we have a dishwasher, we have lots of closet space, we have a doorman until midnight, we live near the city (quick commute), we have plenty of parking in the area, we live near great restaurants, there&#039;s a great school for our son, they accept pets, it&#039;s a great neighborhood and community. Yes, like any building there are some things that I&#039;ve called management to complain about, but they listened and addressed my issues. They may an initial runaround, but I think that most places do. <br /><br />Too many folks complain about too many things without looking at the more important factors and at the bigger picture. Im not here to advertise for Pistilli, i&#039;m sure he does fine without my opinions. I just mention this because it would be a shame for others that don&#039;t want to head out too deep into the suburbs and still want to enjoy a community like Astoria and miss out at an inexpensive opportunity to do so. Hey, we can all still go out to LI and get a house and upgrade our kitchens and bathrooms for thousands of dollars, but I think life is more that just if my counter top is made of granite or laminate. And yes, it might be cheaper in Woodside or Jackson Heights. But I&#039;m here to stay. <br /><br />You can ask me anything about the building if you want an inside take of it. I&#039;m more than happy to share.

				Hi Elkelorraine1&nbsp; -- welcome to the neighborhood.&nbsp; I was wondering re the parking&nbsp; - were you offered a space in the garage, but just opted to park in the street instead?

				Hello Claire. The building offers it at a price, but since the weather is good we decided to request the spot once winter comes. I&#039;m sure they told me how much the spot costs, but i can&#039;t seem to remember. I see a lot of people using the garage so I am looking forward to using it and avoid shoveling snow off of my car come the season. I thought, hey, why spend the extra money now?

				The price was $180/month for indoor parking and $150/ for outdoor parking. <br />pretty reasonable.<br />We decided to pass on renting here, for 2 main reasons - rather far walk to the subway, and just cheap fixtures in the kitchen and bathroom. Although the space was great for the price, just didn&#039;t want to be renting and have such shoddy fixtures. Just sends a bad message about the building.

The building initially opened up for purchase, not rentals. As a purchase building, home owners usually, for the most part want to personalize their space. Not every home owner wants the same counter top or cabinet wood color or bathroom tile. The building decided to give us just the basics, then offer the space at a low purchase price and when coupled with the amount of money to spend on the fixtures of my choice, I still come under what other buildings are charging up front to provide its buyer with granite counter tops, marble tiles and stainless steel appliances. I don&#039;t want a building to dictate my choices for me. I just want my mortgage to be low overall. In LIC, the new condos going up, a two bedroom with amazing fixtures is going for 750K. I can get a THREE bedroom here for less than that. It&#039;s not a bad message, just a basic bare bones one.<br /><br />I took a look at the smaller apartments, one bedrooms just out of curiosity. I guess I was trying to live House Hunters in person. Really cute with nice sized bathrooms, same sized kitchen as the two bedrooms and it depended on the unit that dictated the size of the living and bed rooms. But there are still plenty available, but I see people coming everday to look. As for the two bedrooms, the one for 2050, both bedrooms are a nice size. In my sons room I have a twin sized bed, a desk and a wall unit with his television with still some room to play in. Hey, maybe not as big as in a house in the suburbs, but very comfortable. I hate feeling claustophobic and enclosed, and I don&#039;t feel that way in my unit. <br /><br />Yes, I find parking after 9PM. Maybe not right in front of the building but definitely along the park.

				elkelorraine1 makes fair points, but I started this thread about renting in this place, not buying. I understand if you&#039;re buying and you want to personalize it, but renters are not going to spend thousands of dollars to do renovations. I was just curious to see if people had more favorable opinions of the building as a renter.

Being that most of the buildings around here are pre-war, the fixtures and cabinets and/or countertops are cheap or dated nonetheless. Not to mention what some of the bathrooms are like. We saw quite a few with complete pink or blue tiled bathrooms. How do I work around that? LOL. :-D&nbsp; &nbsp;
