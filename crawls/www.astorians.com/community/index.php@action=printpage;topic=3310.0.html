				Yeah, is there anyone following the races closely who can suggest whether I should vote for Cuomo or for Green in the AG primary? The Times endorsed Green, but Cuomo&#39;s gotten a number of prominent endorsements too. They seem more different in temperment than policies...<br /><br />As for Pataki, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s going to get much farther than Iowa in 2008...

				Dang, I just wanted to add snarkily.<br /><br />Why did the Times endorse Green?<br />If you are choosing on temperment, let us go with Green.<br />I would rather someone who loves their family to bits and would be like a bulldog who needs a chain as AG.<br /><br />What does Cuomo have going? Is it to resurrect the family political line?<br />Is he being endorsed for dropping out in the 2002 race?<br /><br />***<br /><br />Snark.<br />At a recent debate, cable watchers were asked if they wished Pataki were running for re-election?<br />80% said NO<br />The audience in NYC found the question hilarious.<br /><br />More interesting to me, the same cable watchers were asked which issue of 3 is MOST important this race for Governor:<br /><br />Both Reforming of Albany and the Economy were favored over Education 2 to 1.<br />One candidate wisely pointed out that responses probably varied widely by location.<br />The locations were NY City; Rochester; Albany; Syracuse.<br /><br />My hunch is that the residents who knew best how much Reform is needed in Albany live in Albany.<br /><br />***<br />Baseball- my mom never roots for favorite sports teams.<br />With all due respect to her, she strongly believes the Mets will win it all this year.<br /><br />More surprising than their leading their division is the speed in which they are chomping down their magic number. Like they are Babe Ruth eating hot dogs.<br />Now it seems a question in both leagues- which teams will earn the privilege to lose to NY?<br /><br />***<br />If you still cant decide between Green and Cuomo for AG, <br />toss a coin.<br />Cuomo wont need it; but Green does.<br />Or vote happily in protest for Mr. Maloney.

				<br />http://www.dfnyc.org/cms/node/87701?PHPSESSID=9e83d5c239f88f652299231bda3c7008<br /><br />Maybe Cuomo skipped Democracy for New York because he felt Mr. Green worked more closely with activists for change and would eventually earn the endorsement.<br />Or maybe he does not like small forum questions as a front runner.<br /><br />In that sense, Cuomo at 11% matches well against King with 4%.

				I think Cuomo skipped DFNYC as the voting base was already closely aligned with Green and he didn&#39;t think he would have a competitive chance, but I always think it&#39;s a good idea to go even where you won&#39;t win, just so people meet you and hear your case.<br /><br />I know all three candidates, Cuomo, Green and Maloney personally and like them all.&nbsp; They have different skill sets and strengths.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have supported Mark Green for every past election he&#39;s contested in NYC (except his loss to Congress, which was before I moved to the city).&nbsp; He was a good Public Advocate and would have made an outstanding Mayor.&nbsp; That being said, he can be very arrogant.&nbsp; He&#39;s smart and he knows it.&nbsp; He is a good man and would make a good AG, but would probably conflict with the rest of the Statewide Democrats as he did in the city, especially with our hopeful next Governor Eliot Spitzer.&nbsp; Green is honest and has a good record, but probably can&#39;t win this race.&nbsp; His negative campaigning has really shocked me.&nbsp; I would have liked to have seen him run a positive campaign.&nbsp; Lord knows he has done enough positive things to run one.<br /><br />Andrew Cuomo is also a good man.&nbsp; He came across as someone with a sense of entitlement when he took on H. Carl McCall in the Gubernatorial primary four years ago, and I strongly opposed him.&nbsp; I&#39;ve gotten to know him much better since then and have found him to be both charming and intelligent.&nbsp; His record at HUD was one of reform and achievement and he would also make an outstanding Attorney General.&nbsp; He took the most troubled national agency and salvaged it, a feat for which he should be praised, not attacked.&nbsp; Was his record perfect, no, but then no elected official ever has a perfect record.&nbsp; He is among the most tenacious people I have ever met and he is well connected and would be able to marshall resources to take on any problem he might face as AG.&nbsp; I really like him and suspect he will win big on Tuesday (probably by 10%).<br /><br />Sean Patrick Maloney is also a great guy.&nbsp; My Democratic Club, Stonewall Democrats of NYC, endorsed him and I&#39;ve been campaigning for him.&nbsp; He&#39;s smart, driven, ambitious and honest.&nbsp; I think he has a bright future ahead of him.&nbsp; This may not be his race, but a vote for him could send a message for reform.&nbsp; Sean has raised better issues in this campaign than any of his opponents and I think he really wants the job, instead of wanting to keep his political career alive (as he doesn&#39;t really have one yet - he&#39;s a first time candidate).&nbsp; <br /><br />We will do well whomever wins the primary, but keep in mind, Jeanine Pirro, the Republican nominee is waiting to savage whomever wins our primary.&nbsp; Mark and Sean don&#39;t have the funds to fight back against her, so in that sense, Cuomo may be our best bet, but Green and Maloney might be able to beat Pirro too.&nbsp; Who you vote for depends on what you want in an Attorney General.&nbsp; All three are very smart, but Green is an outsider, Cuomo a coalition builder and Maloney an investigator/litigator.&nbsp; All three can make credible claims to being a reformer, but keep in mind, whoever the AG is, will put their stamp on the office.&nbsp; Eliot Spitzers AG office looks very different from that of Dennis Vacco, Oliver Koppell or Robert Abrams, they all have their own issues and interests and that will help flavor their tenure.

				Dirk, thank you very much for that! I&#39;ll keep your comments in mind on Tuesday! I did hear a bit of Maloney on the radio a few weeks ago, and was pretty impressed by him, but I haven&#39;t heard either Green or Cuomo to compare...

				Anytime!&nbsp; I&#39;m glad to be of service.&nbsp; They&#39;re all good, it just depends on what one wants the next AG to be.

				I have to say that over the years Cuomo has gotten a rep for just going with the flow and changing direction and alliances to suit his needs.&nbsp; He is determined to win something and will do what it takes to get it.&nbsp; The reason he never gets it is because people say he is not dedicated or driven for any particular cause.&nbsp; None of this is a direct quote, just my feelings and remembrances.<br /><br />Don&#39;t know much about Maloney but this city has a good rep for producing investigators turned politicians (gulianni, spitzer).&nbsp; Id probably vote for him but most likely won&#39;t win this race.
