				Hayleyree&#039;s story of how she got her cat in the Dogs and Hot Weather thread and casicua mentioning that he is rescuing a dog made me wonder how all you folks came to be pet parents. <br /><br />I&#039;ll start: my cat Bella (who lives with my sis and I here in Astoria) came to be ours through a friend of a friend. She was busy all the time (the friend, not Bella) and wanted Bella to go to a home where she&#039;d get more attention. My sis and I wanted a cat anyway, so the opportunity was perfect. In October, we&#039;ll have had her for two years. She is hilarious, the antics she gets up to! The cutest thing about her is that when she stretches, all her paws stretch out into kitty jazz hands .... it&#039;s almost unnatural, but soooo cute!<br /><br />My cat Briscoe, living with my mom in California, sort of found me. At the grocery store where I used to work, a family stood outside one day giving away kittens. Atrociously, sometime that evening, they apparently gave up and just left the box o&#039; kittens out in front of the store. A customer let our manager know and she tried furiously to find homes for them so that they were gone by the end of her shift (and so that she wouldn&#039;t have to call Animal Control). They were two little black kittens and super fiesty. I desperately wanted one, and begged my mom, who finally relented. I picked the slightly less hysterical one. I named him Briscoe (after Detective Lennie Briscoe from Law and Order because I&#039;m a dork). He is awesome. He&#039;s a big, healthy, shiny cat and he lets me carry him around over my shoulder like a rag doll. I love him to bits.<br /><br />The other 2 cats that live with my mom are also rescues. And our dog Kelsey, who we lost last February&nbsp; :-( , was a Sheltie Rescue dog.<br /><br />Who&#039;s next?

				Maybe 20 years ago, my former landlady had a strong fear of cats. The idea of their claws especially bothered her.<br /><br />She had a soft spot for them though - she would put food out for the strays behind the building, and boxes with bedding for them. Then she&#039;d wonder why there were so many. I guess she thought that after a good meal and a nights rest, they&#039;d move along down the road. Some mother cat abandoned three kittens in the alleyway.&nbsp; The landlady had some neighbor-kids gather them up in a cardboard box. They were all black, a male, and 2 females, in graduated sizes.<br /><br />She tried to take them to North Shore Animal League, but was told they were too young.. she would have to wait until they were 5 weeks old and could be vaccinated. I came home that night to find them in the hallway, on the apartment steps, somewhat filthy. I called them little kitty, littler kitty, and littlest kitty. I volunteered to look after them for the duration of the waiting period, and I was able to stretch the 5 weeks into 15 years. Whenever the landlady was mad at me about something, (often enough -- too bright a bulb in the hallway fixture, for example,) she would mention that she never gave me permission to have those cats either! The littlest kitty had her revenge by outliving the landlady.<br /><br /><br />About 7 years ago, a week before Christmas, a young woman from 2 doors down stopped me on the street to ask a favor. Her friend had recently broken up with someone and moved back home with her mother. The mother&#039;s boyfriend hated cats, and had given her until Saturday to find someplace for them, or he would.&nbsp; Since I was a known eccentric cat person, I was their natural mark. So I got a slender black and white &quot;tuxedo&quot; cat, and an extremely plump orange and white job.&nbsp; She thought their names were Dre (as in Dr. Dre?) and Monkey, but I determined them to actually be Penguin and PumpkinBuddhaCat. <br /><br />The landlady&#039;s sister became the new landlady, and she is as sweet as her sister was annoying. The cats began to visit her in her apartment, and find they prefer her company to mine. So the visit me to eat, and poop, and they seek me out when she is away. It is a mostly satisfactory arrangement. <br /><br />(One day, a couple of months after this arrangement began, I noticed that Penguin was not eating very much at all. Concerned, I asked her if she had noticed anything, since he seemed to be off his feed. &quot;No,&quot; she said, &quot;In fact, he seems to enjoy the turkey I bring from the deli very much.&quot;)<br /><br />Hope that&#039;s not too much words for too little story.<br />

				I got my cat Hannah a little over a year ago. I&#039;d been waiting for years to get a cat of my own.&nbsp; And finally, I got my own place that was in a pet friendly building and with a little push of my cat-loving boss who was in the process of adopting two kitties of her own, I adopted Hannah from Humane Society on 59th &amp; 2nd Ave. <br /><br />Hannah who was 7 (now 8 )&nbsp; was one of the older cats there, but she extremely playful and affectionate.&nbsp; Also, since this was my first pet adoption and a little nervous about it all, I only wanted one cat for the time being so I&nbsp; chose one who seemed better as an only cat.&nbsp; The volunteer caretaker who knew her best assured me that Hannah much preferred playing with a toy by herself then playing with another cat.&nbsp; &nbsp;And it&#039;s true, Hannah has the energy of a kitten and with amuse herself for hours playing with a milk jug tab.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, my boyfriend (who was not a fan of cats before Hannah) calls her a dog-like cat since she likes to play fetch and always needs to be around humans.&nbsp; I tend to roll my eyes at him when he brings it up, but hey, whatever gets him over his prejudice.&nbsp; He&#039;s cat person now.&nbsp; :evil:<br /><br />Hannah&#039;s famous boudoir photo: <br /><br />(http://photos-865.ll.facebook.com/photos-ll-sf2p/v148/84/108/637906865/n637906865_223569_4839.jpg)

				I acquired my pet through Astorians.com&nbsp; :lol:<br /><br />If anyone recalls the sad story of Twiggy from a year or so ago, at the time I had been in touch with Astorians poster Darcee about possibly fostering a kitten, since I knew I wanted to adopt a cat, and I wanted to start young.<br /><br />Twiggy unfortunately passed away, and I exchanged some half-hearted messages with Darcee and Jayme about reclaiming the towels I had donated to the cause, but none of us ever really got around to making that happen.<br /><br />Fast forward to this past New Year&#039;s Day.&nbsp; I was lounging around nursing a hungover with friends in North Carolina watching St. Elmo&#039;s Fire and playing on my laptop when I received a message from Jayme that Darcee had found a six-to-eight-week-old stray kitten who was currently using the towels, and did I still want the towels back, and did I want a kitten along with them?<br /><br />Sirius moved in with me about a week later, and we have no idea where he came from or why he was wandering around homeless on New Year&#039;s Eve, but he&#039;s a pretty happy and healthy camper these days.&nbsp; He&#039;s especially popular in the lobby of our apartment building, where he enjoys prowling and hunting flies and enthusiastically greeting everyone who enters the building.&nbsp; He also enjoys carrying a weasel ball around in his mouth, keeping a close eye on the activity in the recycling area outside our window, hiding in the closet, and throwing his toys across the apartment.

				i got my pitbull sidhartha when i was working as an attendant at the animal hospital at the aspca.&nbsp; she was brought into the hospital, half-conscious, by nypd.&nbsp; they found her in a dumpster in forest hills.&nbsp; from what i heard, the doctors weren&#039;t going to do anything for her, but one of the vet techs urged them to try.&nbsp; later in the day when i came into work during my 4pm to midnight shift, i was cleaning one of the wards when i saw this little face staring at me.&nbsp; she had this huge bandage around her neck (holding a catheter in place).&nbsp; a week later, she was all better.<br /><br />i had been looking for a dog and knew this was the one when i heard that she didn&#039;t belong to anybody.&nbsp; i made all the right contacts, ended up fostering her until she was old enough to be spayed and adopted (aspca won&#039;t adopt out any animals unless they&#039;ve been spayed or neutered).<br /><br />she&#039;s been mine ever since.&nbsp; this was summer of 1999.&nbsp; she was about three months old.

				My dad found my cat on his porch in pa. She was starving to death, and literally dragging herself across the deck to a large pail that used to hold cat food (crunchies) It was currently being used as a bucket for a mop, but she must have caught a scent of the cat food that used to be in it. He fed her and brought her in, unfortunately his fat bully cat wouldn&#039;t let the poor tiny kitty be, so she caught an emergency ride home with my mom. we got her cleaned up (she was a mess, worms and fleas and earmites and all kinds of microscopic grossness) and fixed, and now she&#039;s fat and happy and guards the house and goes crazy for her toys, my boyfriend, and my sneakers. <br />the disturbing part is she came potty trained. meaning someone either kicked her out, or she escaped. i try not to think about that part.&nbsp; :|

				On day in 1997, me and my dad were out fishing at the Cap Tree a fishing place near Jones Beach.&nbsp; We were there all day long.&nbsp; When we came home and went into the kitchen to where my mom was sitting at the kitchen table and my brother was standing in the dining room with Travis cause he was a little scared.&nbsp; They proceeded to say that we now have a dog, who was about a year old at the time.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-o&nbsp; My brother explained that his friend moved in with his grandmother and didn&#039;t want Travis, so my brother took him.&nbsp; &nbsp; I went to try and get Travis to come to me but he didn&#039;t, he was scared.&nbsp; &nbsp;So I sat down on the kitchen floor, while everyone was talking, not paying attention to Travis, and then he came into the kitchen slowly and came to me and I started playing with him.&nbsp; And that was that.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; &nbsp; My puppy rules!&nbsp; &nbsp;:rock:

				We adopted Mitzie from the ASPCA.&nbsp; She was &quot;on hold&quot; for an officer.&nbsp; However, when I called later in the week about new dogs coming in (they told me to call each Wednesday), I inquired about Brandy (the former name of Mitzie).&nbsp; They said she was no longer on hold, but still undergoing testing.&nbsp; If we came by after work, we may be able to put her &#039;on hold&#039; until the test results came back and she&#039;d be available.&nbsp; After work, I rushed there in anticipation.&nbsp; I was easily won over.&nbsp; However, I figured my husband would be the more difficult of the two of us (since he never had a dog).&nbsp; Well, Mitzie did her magic by immediately jumping into his lap.&nbsp; While there, the lab results came back negative and she was immediately released to us (after completing the paperwork).&nbsp; We walked from the ASPCA on a cold February night holding Mitzie in a purple towel they gave to us (since it was cold and we hadn&#039;t been expecting to bring her home so suddenly).&nbsp; We brought her to Petco and bought a lot of stuff (some being useless). This was one of the best days ever!

				After we lost our cat, Yui, in November 2007 to pancreatic cancer we had two small pieces of criteria for future pets:&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; We wanted two cats so they could keep each other company and 2.&nbsp; They had to be rescued.<br /><br />As it normally happens with friends/loved ones we started receiving offers for new cats within days of Yui&#039;s passing but none of them felt right to us.&nbsp; We knew that that the Universe would let us know when it was time.<br /><br />Fast forward to February of this year.&nbsp; I was running late to meet my partner so he was killing time by walking around Petco in Union Square when he saw our new kids on the bottom row of the &quot;wall of cats&quot;.&nbsp; Over dinner that night he described them from memory (they were white, brother and sister, couldn&#039;t be separated) but that was it.&nbsp; He ended the conversation by simply saying &quot;I think it&#039;s time.&quot;&nbsp; Two days later fate found me in Union Square killing a few minutes in between errands when I realised I was standing in front of Petco so went in.&nbsp; I immediately saw the two cats he was describing and it was love at first sight.&nbsp; My partner met me at Petco a couple hours later and we brought our new kids home that night.<br /><br />Fred and Paige are half Siames/half Tabby and all attitude.&nbsp; They were rescued by the city from a woman who was a &quot;horder&quot; and lived caged in the shelter system for a really long time.&nbsp; To them our modest size apartment is a palace and they love to run and chase each other through the place at all hours (thankfully our neighbours don&#039;t hear them too often as they quiet down when we go to bed). Fred is a true cuddleslut and wants to be wherever you are. He also thinks that 4:30 am is the appropriate time to wake us up to play but will usually go back to sleep if we refuse.&nbsp; Paige is the true portrait of teen angst and is fine as long as you are feeding her but wants nothing to do with you otherwise but to be left in peace.&nbsp; She&#039;s slowly coming around though and is uber protective of her brother.<br /><br />

				We got our cat Pixel (yes, like the pixels on a computer screen) in 2004 from the New York Animal Care and Control (http://www.nycacc.org/) on the UES. We picked him out, and then were able to pick him up after he got neutered.<br /><br />I grew up with cats, so I was very interested in having one here. Husband took a while to convince, but when we had a good number of mice that knew how to circumnavigate around traps he was willing to get him. Since we&#039;ve had him, he&#039;s killed one mouse, and all others have retreated. He&#039;s a very friendly and energetic cat, although he&#039;s calmed down quite a bit since we got him. The only downsides are that his hair is EVERYWHERE, he has clawed up our furniture a bit, and he randomly uses the bathroom in other locations than his catbox. All in all though, I still say he&#039;s perfect. ;)

				When I was in my 20&#039;s, I took a few mini-vacations in Woodstock, N.Y.&nbsp; During one of them I befriended one of the local residents and his brother--the two of them lived in a house and nearby trailer in West Hurley.&nbsp; The one who was my principal friend, who lived in the trailer most of the time, had two white cats, brother and sister.&nbsp; The female had litter after litter, mostly with her brother so most of the kittens were white.&nbsp; But this particular litter was probably fathered by some roving Casanova: two were white, one was a gray tabby, and two were tortoiseshell and white (or calico).&nbsp; Of the calico kittens, one was healthy and one was sickly, the runt of the litter.<br /><br />My friend had no trouble finding new owners for the kittens.&nbsp; Of the litter I knew, the white ones were adopted first, leaving the tabby and the two calicos.&nbsp; Then the healthy calico was given to a police officer who lived a few doors away.&nbsp; That was when I visited my friend.<br /><br />At about mid-evening I looked at the food dishes and saw three kittens where there should have been two.&nbsp; I told my friend, and he saw that the healthy calico had returned.&nbsp; My friend took the kitten and tried to return her to her new owners, but soon after he left her there she was back in the trailer again.&nbsp; He tried to return her two or three times, but she always returned to the trailer through a pipe under the stove.&nbsp; It was finally evident that her new owners had put her out for the night.&nbsp; Meanwhile, her mother and sisters (my friend assumed all the kittens were female) rejected her because the familial bond had been broken, and she snuggled up to me.&nbsp; I slept alone in the trailer that night while my friend slept in the house.<br /><br />The next morning, as I was about to go back home to New York City, my friend said that he didn&#039;t think it right to put out a little kitten for the night.&nbsp; &nbsp;He urged the kitten on me, saying, &quot;I think this cat will be good for you.&quot;&nbsp; I hesitated at first, but finally I agreed to take her home if the bus driver would let her on with me, in the carrier from the local vet.<br /><br />When I got home, there was no one else in the apartment--I still lived with my parents.&nbsp; I deposited the kitten in the apt. and went down to buy food and litter and a toy.&nbsp; I left a note saying, &quot;We have a new member of the family, can we keep her?&quot;&nbsp; My mother arrived home in the meantime, and it was love at first sight.&nbsp; My sister, who already lived elsewhere, was delighted; during her late childhood and early teens she had been after our parents to get a cat.&nbsp; She visited us very often after that, because she was really visiting the cat.

				Stella was one of a litter of four kittens found by a neighbor.&nbsp; They were unable to catch the mother.&nbsp; I came home from work one day to find my then-roommate talking to our landlady - the neighbor had tried to give my landlady the kitten, but her dog wanted to eat it.&nbsp; So they handed me Stella, and I was hooked.&nbsp; She was about 4 weeks old - just a tiny ball of fluff.&nbsp; She decided pretty quickly that I was her mom, and now, 3 years later, she still nurses on a blanket before going to sleep.<br /><br />After those roommates moved out and took their cat with them, Stella befriended my goldfish, and would bring him toys and talk to him all the time.&nbsp; Then the fish died.&nbsp; So I went to the ACC and adopted Doyle.&nbsp; Stella was less appreciative than you might think, but now she likes him ok.&nbsp; :)
