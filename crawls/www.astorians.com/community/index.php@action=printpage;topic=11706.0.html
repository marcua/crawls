				Still me!&nbsp; Still me!&nbsp; I&#039;ll still organize all of Astoria one house at a time.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ll be back in Astoria soon.&nbsp; (Not to mention, I&#039;ll need any excuse to come back to the old neighborhood.)<br /><br />I&#039;ll just take the subway instead of the bus to get to you.&nbsp; :)

				Carrie, if I buy a piece of furniture from you like the couch or wardrobe, I would have to arrange to hire a mover bring it to my apartment so is it possible for you to keep an item for a few days after it&#039;s bought until a mover is hired?&nbsp; What&#039;s your time frame?

				Hi Rene,<br />Yes, you can leave it here for a few days while you arrange for a pick up.&nbsp; As you can imagine, I&#039;d rather it be out sooner rather than later, if possible.&nbsp; We&#039;re trying to move everything out of here by the 24th, so you&#039;d have about a week.&nbsp;

				This is what the bed looks like:<br /><br />(http://www.ikea.com/PIAimages/22203_PE092115_S3.jpg)<br /><br />This is what the TV cabinet looks like (but ours has a lighter finish):<br /><br />(http://www.ikea.com/PIAimages/38213_PE130114_S3.jpg)<br /><br />Here is the couch:<br /><br />(http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a155/Monkeypie47/P8110625.jpg)<br /><br />^^That photo coloring is a little off so it doesn&#039;t do the couch justice.&nbsp; It&#039;s very comfortable.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ll try to post more later but that&#039;s a start.&nbsp;

				The wardrobe is from this line but ours has two doors, not three and three drawers, not two.&nbsp; It&#039;s total measurements are 70&quot;H, 20&quot;D, 38&quot;W if that helps.<br /><br />(http://www.ikea.com/PIAimages/53850_PE154486_S3.jpg)
