				I&#039;m starting to think that some people, when using a cell phone, lose their ability to do anything else.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure we&#039;ve all seen them wandering aimlessly on the sidewalks, in crosswalks, on the stairs in subway stations and they seem to think, I&#039;m on a cell phone, I&#039;m too important to worry about anyone around me - I can walk into folks, I can cut them off unexpectedly, I can do anything I want.&nbsp; Can&#039;t people multi-task?&nbsp; What about talking on cell phone shuts down the other parts of your brain, especially the parts connected to human courtesy?&nbsp; If you&#039;re going to be on a conversation and don&#039;t want to pay attention to anything or anyone else, why not step over to the side so you aren&#039;t in the way?&nbsp; Did their brain already disconnect the minute the call went through?&nbsp; I don&#039;t get these folks at all.

				Or how people still don&#039;t get that they don&#039;t have to yell into a mobile phone to be heard.&nbsp; Speak normally and the other person can hear you.&nbsp; And if there&#039;s something wrong with the line, shouting won&#039;t help.

				It&#039;s called cell yell and I don&#039;t know what accounts for it.&nbsp; But my favorite example of egregious cellphone use occurred in the Isamu Noguchi Garden Museum.&nbsp; A woman was sitting in the Sculpture Garden telling a friend that &quot;it&#039;s very relaxing.&quot;&nbsp; Yes, lady, it would be if it weren&#039;t for your cellphone!<br /><br />As Guy Noir said, if God meant you to carry on a loud one-way conversation in public, He would have made you a crazy person.

				You know how on landlines, you can kind of hear yourself in the receiver when you talk? Cell phones don&#039;t have that capability. That, combined with being out in public (and therefore probably having more ambient noise than you would have in your living room) makes people think that they have to talk louder. I&#039;m sure we&#039;ve all been guilty of this at some time or another, but it still drives me INSANE when I hear someone talking really loud on their phone.<br /><br />I found this (http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4229967) when I was trying to find the article where I first heard about this.

				I totally realize that.&nbsp; And in the beginning, back in the day when cell phones were 9 pounds and only the fancy people had them, I could understand, but now...&nbsp; by now we should have caught up with the technology and understand that they are designed to hear us when we speak.&nbsp; It&#039;s been, like, a decade already.&nbsp;

				I thought everyone loved ovearing cell phone conversations.&nbsp; Just last week I got to hear all the trials and tribulations of a girl trying to plan her wedding while on the train at 7:30ish in the morning - who doesn&#039;t want to hear ever minute detail of a strangers life while they are half asleep!&nbsp; I forgot to mention that I had my iPod up louder than normal and could still hear her!&nbsp; *rolling eyes*<br /><br />Good thing she was out of arms reach or I might have bonked her over the head with a magazine or something - heh heh

				What kills me are the people who get off the train @ Astoria Blvd and start texting as soon as they get onto the stairs. An entire sea of humanity is rushing down the steps and these folks are blocking traffic as they go down at a snail&#039;s pace with their heads down! Arrrrrrrgh. Multitasking is not your forte.

				I still see people driving with hand held cell phones. I have&nbsp; a cell phone, only bring it with me if&nbsp; I am going to an appointment, in case I am late, and then I stop&nbsp; and&nbsp; call, out of peoples&nbsp; way. Also, I bring it with me when I leave the area. I don&#039;t know if anyone read about the still &#039;dead spots&#039; in Upstate&nbsp; NY, cause&nbsp; there is&nbsp; law against&nbsp; phone towers, some guy with&nbsp; a&nbsp; cell&nbsp; phone froze to death?

				Is there actually evidence that cell phones affect the equipment on airlines. I know that I recently read a study that the cell phones do NOT affect hospital equipment. This seems obvious as if they really did affect hospital equipment, and lives were at stake, I would assume a much more stringent screening process would be necessary. Additionally, doctors and nurses are often seen catching a quick phone call in the hospital.

				I have a friend who is a pilot and he says he can hear interference on his headset when someone makes a call.&nbsp; No, it doesn&#039;t bring the plane down but if there is a problem and he needs to talk to the tower, it could prevent a clear message getting through.&nbsp; It&#039;s more of a precaution than a direct link to fatalities.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m waiting for planes to have wireless internet.&nbsp; That would be more fun than phones.<br /><br />
