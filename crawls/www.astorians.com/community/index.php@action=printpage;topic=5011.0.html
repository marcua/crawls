				Hey everyone, my roommate is leaving, so I&#39;m looking for someone new! I posted an ad on Craigslist, but I figured I&#39;d post it here too. There are pictures on the CL ad here: http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/roo/272268755.html (http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/roo/272268755.html). Also, if you&#39;re interested, please email me through the email address on the Craigslist page, not through here, since I&#39;m trying to stay organized :) Thanks!<br /><br />----------------------------------<br /><br />My roommate is leaving to move in with her boyfriend, so there&#39;s a bedroom available March 15 in spacious 2BR on Steinway Street at 21st Ave. Laundromat &amp; delis downstairs, good street parking, and its a safe neighborhood. This area of Steinway is mostly residential, but the Q101 bus (the one that runs up &amp; down Steinway) stops right out front and will have you in the Steinway shopping district in about 10 minutes. The N/W is an 8-ish minute walk down Ditmars, which has most of what you&#39;d need on a daily basis (supermarkets, drugstores, banks, post office, restaurants, etc etc etc). Its a 15-20 minute walk down 21st Ave to awesome Astoria Park.<br /><br />No backyard access, but we do have roof access. The landlord has been attentive to the few minor issues we&#39;ve had, but she doesn&#39;t allow pets. This is also a no-smoking apartment.<br /><br />We split the rent, it&#39;s $750 each (so $1500 total), and we also split ConEd (around $60 each a month, usually) and Time Warner cable/wireless internet ($65 each a month). We don&#39;t have a landline, but if you want one, your room is wired for it, and the bill will be your responsibility since I&#39;ll never use it (I use my cell phone). If you don&#39;t want a cable box in your room, your share of that bill will be $10 less. First &amp; last months rent plus a one month security deposit is due to move in (so $2,250 total to move in).<br /><br />About me: I&#39;m a 28 year old female who will be graduating from SVA with a photography degree in May. I&#39;ve been here since August 2005, and I love the apartment and neighborhood. I don&#39;t really have a set schedule - between class, assisting, and interning, its kind of all over the place. Socially, I do like to go out with my friends after class and on weekends, but I&#39;m not a huge partier and am not the type to bring it back to the apartment after the bars close. I consider this place my home and it is where I unwind and chill.<br /><br />I&#39;m not a neat freak, but I do keep the common areas neat (living room, kitchen, bathroom), and I would expect the same from you. I&#39;m not big on chore charts or anything like that - just be decent. If you don&#39;t think you can always keep the common areas clean, then we probably won&#39;t be a good match.<br /><br />The other random stuff: I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re male/female, gay/straight, as long as you&#39;re a decent person, you&#39;re cool in my book. I&#39;m not necessarily looking for a new best friend in a roommate, but I would like to be friendly with whoever ends up living here. I don&#39;t mind your boyfriend/girlfriend spending the night or hanging here with you a couple times a week (occasional out-of-town guests are cool with me, too), but I&#39;m not looking for a 3rd roommate, you know?<br /><br />I&#39;ve attached two pictures of the room (http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/roo/272268755.html) (one from the bed and one from the door), and if you want to see more pics of the apartment, email me. I&#39;ve lived in the room since August 2005, but am switching to the other for a change of scenery. I can say from expeirence that it is nice and quiet at night (no street noise, unless the 18-wheelers that go up and down Steinway honk their horns, which has happened exactly once since I moved in 1.5 years ago), and right now I have a full-size bed (youcould fit a queen), nightstand, dresser, and a small tv stand and desk in there. The room isn&#39;t staying green (unless you want it to! I love the green, but that&#39;s just me).<br /><br />Hmm, I think that&#39;s it. I know this is super long, but I figured I&#39;d put as much info out there as I could. Oh, and I took the time to write all of this out, so if you respond, please take the time tell me a bit about yourself, why you&#39;re moving, and anything else you&#39;d like to say :)
