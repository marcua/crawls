				<br />We all know Astoria is getting &#039;hotter&#039; by the minute.&nbsp; And for many landlords, both commercial and residential, this means they see dollar signs, and use it as an excuse/opportunity to jack up the rents.<br /><br />However, I also know that as the average sale prices increase, with that usually comes increased property taxes, at least at some point down the road.<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to get a sense of just how much the property taxes might have increased, or are expected to increase, vis-Ã -vis the % of rent increases that landlords are imposing.<br /><br />I get that rents sometimes &#039;need&#039; to go up due to increased costs to run/own property.&nbsp; But I also know that for many landlords, it&#039;s all motivated by pure greed.<br /><br />So for e.g., in the small apt bldg. where I live (9 units in total, 1 of which is the LL and family, another which is the LL&#039;s extended family....not sure if he charges them &#039;rent&#039;....so there&#039;s either 7 or 8&nbsp; &#039;rental units&#039;....) ... in just the past 6 years, and in reviewing the rental history for my unit alone, I see that the rent is now about 30% higher than it was 6 years ago.&nbsp; (Much of the bigger jumps in rent came about via vacancy leases, with new tenant turnover).&nbsp; <br /><br />I suspect similar increases (maybe a bit higher, maybe a bit lower) occurred in all the other 7 or 8 rental units, and over this same past six years.&nbsp; Can this really all be attributed to higher property taxes, or would you say more likely, just the LL capitalizing on fact that the nabe is becoming more desirable?<br /><br />I ask because, I don&#039;t mind so much a rent increase if it&#039;s really needed.&nbsp; But when I feel it&#039;s being done out of pure greed, it leaves a really bad taste in my mouth, and makes my overall home environment feel less warm and fuzzy.&nbsp; I want a LL who&#039;s &#039;fair&#039;...who raises the rent when it&#039;s necessary...and not &#039;just because&#039;...&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; I also get that LL&#039;s need to have some kind of a cushion for unexpected repairs etc.&nbsp; And they also need to &#039;make a living&#039;.&nbsp; But there&#039;s obviously a point at which it can go well beyond that...&nbsp; I&#039;m just trying to get a sense of what may be what here....

				I educated myself a lot about residential property taxes in NYC because I could not fathom how the numbers were calculated for our house, and I wanted to know how much they might increase.<br /><br /><br />Your situation may be very different, since I believe that the laws are different for multi-family dwellings (more than two units) than for private homes, coops, and condos.<br /><br /><br />Regardless, you can look up the latest property tax bills for your building here: http://nycserv.nyc.gov/NYCServWeb/NYCSERVMain. That gives you the Borough/Block/Lot numbers for the property, which you can use to look up the latest assessment here: http://nycprop.nyc.gov/nycproperty/nynav/jsp/selectbbl.jsp.<br /><br /><br />The latest bills may not reflect the latest assessment, however, because there&#039;s a limit on how quickly property taxes can increase on a given property. So if the property value increased by 20% in a given year, that increase will be phased in to tax calculations over several years (for single family properties, the cap on the increase is 6% per year, but no more than 20% over 5 years - I&#039;m not sure how it works for multifamily). But the assessment will tell you both the assessed value and the &quot;effective market value,&quot; so you can see both what the current taxes are and what they&#039;ll be increasing to within a few more years.<br /><br /><br />We&#039;ve seen our property taxes nearly double in the 6 years that we&#039;ve been in our house, and once housing price increases are phased in, they&#039;ll probably going to double again. So it&#039;s a not-inconsiderable increase, but still buffered to an extraordinary degree by generous city policies. And it&#039;s worth noting that by regional and national standards, our property taxes are insanely low.<br /><br /><br />I hope these tools help you get a handle on how your building&#039;s costs have increased! I&#039;d be curious to find out what you learn.

				Thanks.&nbsp; If the attachments function works, then you should be able to see what I found.&nbsp; &nbsp;Otherwise I can type in the details.....<br /><br />I blanked out some of the codes that might identify my building/lot...just for confidentiality purposes...<br /><br />I should also add that 421-a status is due to end around 2020 I believe.<br /><br />Also in case meaningful, my bldg. is near Steinway and 21st Ave., so not exactly in the thick of things.&nbsp; Granted, in five minutes I can be near supermarket, cafes, etc. but walk to subway is 10-15 minutes depending on how fast one walks.<br /><br />Thanks!

				Yippee, I feel your plight but in the end what diiference does it make if your rent is raised because of taxes or any other reason? <br /><br />If your landlord is receiving a tax rebate through 421-A, taxes are probably very much reduced compared to similar properties. If your rent is rising I doubt it&#039;s because of property taxes.<br /><br />Is your building covered by rent stabilization laws? If it&#039;s a newer building, i.e. built after 1971, then it might not be but often in exchange for 421-A status, landlords have to agree to abide by stabilization laws.<br /><br />In the end though, if it&#039;s not covered, the landlord has the right to charge whatever he/she thinks the market can bear. You have the right not to pay it, but you&#039;ll have to move out of course.<br /><br />I wish I had a solution for you but &#039;fair&#039; is in the eye of the beholder. The rental situation is increasingly precarious in this city, and in Astoria. It really worries me and I think tbe dismantling of rent stabilization system is really unfair.<br /><br />
