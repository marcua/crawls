				Especially one that specializes in antique jewelry and does the work on-site. Re-setting, resizing, cleaning, hopefully someone who could tell me something about the piece, etc.<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#39;m interested in places around here as well as in the City.

				I&#39;ve been referring all my friends to this guy who made my antique engagement ring (as well as my husband&#39;s and my wedding bands). He&#39;s midtown, in the Diamond District and he&#39;s amazing. Of all the stores we looked at in (and outside of) the district, he was the most genuine (no hard sell) and honestly works with you to make original pieces from the beautiful antique models he&#39;s got in his catalogue. AND he was able to get us our rings on short notice (we eloped to the Bahamas)<br /><br />Only drawback is the hours he keeps (M-Thur 10am-4 or 5pm and of course no Saturdays!) but hey that&#39;s the district for ya. Otherwise, he&#39;s the best! His guy upstairs even does free steam cleanings (&quot;Leigh&#39;s Dollar Specials&quot;)<br /><br />Leigh Jay Nacht<br />10 West 47th Street <br />Booth 10 (all the way on the left, near the back)<br />212.719.2888<br /><br />http://antiqueengagementrings.com/Default.aspx<br /><br />good luck!

				Thanks for the recommend! I&#39;m going to pass this along to my fiancee (yes, we got enaged last weekend) and see what she thinks.<br /><br />We already have the ring -- a beautiful 1930s art deco piece that was my grandmother&#39;s. I just need to have two of the smaller diamonds replaced,and have it resized and cleaned up.<br />

				Thanks meg and annie!<br /><br />I figure I&#39;ll make an appointment, go and talk to the jeweler and tell him what we need to have done. Then decide if he&#39;s our go-to guy. I&#39;m also looking at Greenwich Jewelers. Family-owned business that had a few very posititve reviews on citysearch.<br /><br />http://www.greenwichjewelers.com/
