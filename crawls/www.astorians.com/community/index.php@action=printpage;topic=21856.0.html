Yummy is far from descriptive, and does little to share your experience, hence the inquiry regarding your potential stake in this restaurant.

				I think Psari is the best Greek seafood restaurant in Astoria.&nbsp; It&#039;s a little underrated and a little off the beaten path on 36th Ave.&nbsp; But it&#039;s worth the trip.&nbsp; They do a really good raw bar.&nbsp; They definitely have the best raw oysters I&#039;ve had anywhere in town.&nbsp; Clams good too.&nbsp; It&#039;s not easy to talk about the menu because it&#039;s exactly the same as Telly&#039;s, Elias Corner, Kyklades, Okeanos, etc.&nbsp; But I think their grilled shrimp are exceptional.&nbsp; I think their fish always seems the freshest to me.&nbsp; I tend to get what they say is recommended that day.&nbsp; If you like the traditional style of Greek seafood restaurants in town, then try this and see what you think.&nbsp; I think it comes out on top without a doubt.&nbsp; It used to be called Greek Captain and was much more rustic.&nbsp; More like Elias.&nbsp; But they renamed the place and remodeled.&nbsp; It&#039;s very nice inside and yes - the prices are not exactly cheap.&nbsp; But you can&#039;t touch a meal like this in Manhattan for what they charge.&nbsp; I&#039;ve recommended Psari to others and everyone is really happy they went.&nbsp; They also have a full bar and a very nice staff.&nbsp; It&#039;s also a nice spot for dinner if you are planning to hit Studio Square after.&nbsp;

				I had the filet of sole from the lunch menu. It came broiled in a hot plate with a side of lemon potatoes and a Greek salad. The thing I liked the most was the sauce on the filet made with butter and garlic. It was so flavorful and so &quot;yummy&quot;. The service was ok but nothing special. And the best for last they gave me a complimentary piece of galaktompoureko....

				If she says it&#039;s yummy take her word for it, I don&#039;t know why long time posters feel need to bully new posters.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like Greek food, (nothing personal agianst Greeks)&nbsp; &nbsp;so I ain&#039;t going anyway.&nbsp; Pastichio and vegetables, and&nbsp; an occasional&nbsp; spinach&nbsp; pie, that&#039;s it for me and Greek food.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not a fan of lamb (nothing personal agianst Sheep) and not a fan of all that lemon juice they squeeze on (nothing personal against Lemons)

				I&#039;ve never eaten there, but I pass it regularly on my way to the Kaufman movie theatre on the weekends. It&#039;s always busy<br />with people at tables both inside and outside. That&#039;s always an indication to me that a place is at least decent - I&#039;ve never<br />seen it empty. Don&#039;t know about the yummy factor, but most of what I&#039;ve seen people eating looks pretty good. <br /><br />

I don&#039;t know anything about this restaurant and &quot;yummy&quot; doesn&#039;t tell me anything. In fact the post where the meal was described was roughly the same amount of words, but 1000% more informative. I don&#039;t think I was bullying anyone, I was simply trying to get real information about the restaurant and the meal that was consumed and possibly advance a dialogue. <br />It was also suggested, before I chimed in, that the original poster had a stake in the restaurant. A surefire way to immediately disspell that sort of notion is to provide details regarding one&#039;s experience.

				I agree. Once while there I was just in the mood for the filet of sole.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I ever had a filet of sole that tasted that good anywhere.&nbsp; And I remember it being huge.&nbsp; The nice thing is that they don&#039;t do any batter or heavy breading on anything.&nbsp; They really know how to showcase the freshness of their fish and shellfish.&nbsp; It&#039;s an impressive place for seafood lovers.
