				A former Associated Supermarket on 21st Ave and 21st street in Astoria has been remodeled and is becoming a Cherry Valley Marketplace.&nbsp; Inside looks real nice now, new registers, fresher produce.&nbsp; <br />The former Associated would have terrible produce, dated milk on the shelves.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Let&#039;s hope that this trend continues.

				I agree that the City Fresh market (formerly Associated) on 21st &amp; Broadway is a big improvement. It&#039;s cleaner, with wider aisles and a somewhat improved selection (produce isn&#039;t always in great shape, for example). The 24 hour schedule is also a plus. However, their prices are getting ridiculous. It seems like every time I shop there, something I bought a few weeks ago is now $.50-$1.00 more. I&#039;ve actually found it cheaper to get certain things from Fresh Direct and Whole Foods.

				Agreed on Best Yet.&nbsp; It&#039;s the Best Yet!&nbsp; Also love the Fish Market at California Farmer&#039;s Market.&nbsp; What used to be Astoria Fishery on 31st Street just North of 23rd Avenue has relocated to the California Farmer&#039;s Market.&nbsp; The owner of the building on 31st street wanted them out.&nbsp; Thankfully, they were able to salvage the business.
