				Hey all, I'm new to this site, but not to Astoira, and somehow only<br />just discovered FreezePeach last week...<br />I have a scarf that I've been wanting to knit for 4, yes 4 years.<br />Since the weather is about to turn towards fall when you can stand<br />to have wool in your lap for an hour or two, I wanted to know if kniting still is happening and &nbsp;if there are members of this group willing to help me out? Or is this advanced/Intermediates only? &nbsp;Any guidance would be apprecitated!<br /><br />Many Thanks,<br />Andrea

				The crochet/knitting group is still going on, but at the moment the knitters aren't there. At the moment it is just us Crocheter's who are attending. I am assuming that once it gets cooler the knitters will start showing up again. You are free to still come however, If you want to learn crochet we can teach you that. I myself am trying to learn how to knit as well and I just picked up a book called Teach Yourself How To Knit. Me and Rosemary might be able to get you started with a basic knit stitch for a simple scarf and I would let you look at my knitting book. Also other people who do other crafts are free to attend as well and all are welcome no matter what the skill level. :)
