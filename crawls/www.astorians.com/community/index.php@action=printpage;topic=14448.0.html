				<br />Maybe I was not looking before. Today was suprised how dirty some of the doors were. And I could not tell if they just would need cleaning or sadly perhaps replacement.<br />Perhaps cleanliness is low on the priorities with budget concerns.<br /><br /><br />Note to self, dont put feet on doorways.

				I&#039;ve noticed the subways have been much dirtier for months now.&nbsp; From the seats, to the floors and to the doors, they are just filthy with dirt and grime.&nbsp; I sometimes wonder if they ever get cleaned.&nbsp; Not to mention the actual tracks that are disgusting with murky water and garbage floating around.&nbsp; I can only imagine it&#039;s going to get much worse with all these cutbacks.

				In addition to seeing people with their feet up on those doors while standing all the time, I once walked into a car (that i assumed from the outside was empty) that contained a homeless man asleep on the floor with his barefeet on the door.&nbsp; ICK.

And the marks would be all over because people are of different stature and their feet hit the door at different places. I think the real problem is what someone alluded to earlier....The trains are likely not being cleaned often.

				Hog wash! It&#039;s poop! Who&#039;s leaning on doors like this? What do we have, the ghost of James Dean riding the N/W? I&#039;m making an effort to search for these one legged leaners because this sounds too ridiculous. Sadly, I believe there has been a conspiracy formed by disgruntled train riders who are taking their frustrations out on Joe and Jane commuter.
