				I&#39;m thinking of making some homemade Mexican food tonight, and I need a Mexican grocery to get some good corn tortillas, salsa, maybe some queso, etc.&nbsp; I know there are a few down in the Broadway area, but I live near the Ditmars side of things and would like to find a place I can go to on the way home from Manhattan (I can walk home from Astoria Blvd. subway, or MAYBE 30th ave., so someplace around there would be ok too).&nbsp; Any ideas?<br /><br />thx<br />bennyt

				The Trade Fair on Ditmars has a small section with Mexican food. Check the end of the aisle near the spices. (Facing the meat section.) And their corn tortillas are usually in the dairy section for some reason.

				These are outside of BennyT&#39;s &#39;zone of convenience&#39; but for other Astorians there are Mexican Groceries on 41st just south of Broadway &amp; on the north side of Broadway between 42nd and 43rd.

				Only moths.&nbsp; They are special moths that don&#39;t like anything else in NYC cupboards, and do eventually die out.&nbsp; It could be much worse, but it&#39;s still not pleasant while it lasts.
