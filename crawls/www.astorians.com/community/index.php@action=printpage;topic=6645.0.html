				I think there are not very many bookstores in the area because there are a lot of libraries.&nbsp; <em>A LOT</em> of libraries.<br /><br />In case anyone doesn&#039;t know, the Queen Public Library System is separate from the other boroughs, so in New York City you need two library cards to experience true library joy.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a bonus point connected to the subject of libraries:<br /><br />If you look at the QPLS (and NYPL) you can get a list of all the locations of the library and their hours.&nbsp; Going to a branch you&#039;ve never been to before is a great way to get to know a neighborhood.&nbsp; It gives you a starting point, and, important for walking around - there&#039;s sure to be a bathroom there.&nbsp; Cheap entertainment (walking around) and you can take out books from any branch and return it at your local one.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if they made that return-locally policy available for movies took, though I think so.&nbsp; And, speaking of cheap entertainment - there are always events going on at the libraries, and most of them are free.<br /><br />

				I&nbsp; love our libraries too. And if they don&#039;t have what you want, they will special order an Inter Library loan for you. We even have a Carnegie&nbsp; one on Astoria Blvdhere in Astoria (Classic design)&nbsp;

				The library on 31st/Ditmars is open on very weird and inconvenient hours.&nbsp; 6am-10am most days.&nbsp; I think this is for budgetary reasons.&nbsp; But it still sucks that I never see the library open at normal hours and on weekends.&nbsp; Are they all like this?

				As you may have already heard on the news, the mayor is budgeting more money for library hours/days.&nbsp; <br /><br />This Friday a new branch is opening on 21<sup>st</sup> Street at about 37<sup>th</sup> Ave.&nbsp; It replaces an old one that was located in the midst of the Queensbridge Housing Project.&nbsp; The opening celebration will be at 12:30 pm.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t live in the area...you know, you hate to put down any part of our neighborhood...maybe we can phrase it this way - it&#039;s nice that the city has faith in the area, or, if you&#039;re on the 19A or 66 and going to the F train, you might want to stop at the library first, or, it&#039;s convenient if you have to go to Staples <em>and</em> a library.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I was actually shocked when I moved here to see how bad the library system is in New York. I came from Pittsburgh, a much poorer city, but they had an absolutely amazing central library and terrific branch libraries. <br /><br />Open every day with great hours, excellent selection, quick inter-library loan. <br /><br />Then I come here and realize my local library (on Ditmars) is not even open on the weekends. They finally have evening hours a couple of days a week, but I have to carefully plan when I&#039;m going to get books and return them because I can&#039;t return them when they&#039;re not open. Stupidest thing I&#039;ve ever heard of. <br /><br />Most of the time I just go to the Brooklyn Heights library near work, which isn&#039;t much better.

				Hey, I can&#039;t even arrange for enough people to show up to a regular (1x/month) book-swap. Totally free, and you can keep the books....<br /><br />By the way, has everyone heard about the used bookstore owner in Kansas City who burned his books because no one would take them? <br />http://www.kansascity.com/115/story/125497.html (http://&quot;http://www.kansascity.com/115/story/125497.html&quot;)<br />

				Great point BookMinstrel.&nbsp; People will continue to kvetch about the almost messanic coming of a bookstore to Astoria, while <span class="bbc_u">grossly</span> ignoring the realities of demographics, economics and geography.&nbsp; Then to add even more, the folk on this board, English reading foilk who are the most likely to support a bookstore, are not evening willing to visit a bookswap.

				Just speaking for myself, the reason a book swap doesn&#039;t interest me is because I had to get rid of most of my books when I moved here (tiny apartment). The only ones I kept were the ones I plan on keeping for a lifetime. I can&#039;t even buy any more books due to space restrictions, so the library is my only option.

				Jennifer: You don&#039;t need to feel guilty about taking out more books than you bring in. I&#039;d like it to be a swap, but as you say, if you can&#039;t bring a book the first time, I suggest a &quot;pay it forward&quot; mentality. Also, once all the participants have picked over the books, then anyone else in the cafe is welcome to help themselves to whatever&#039;s left. Then we bring the unclaimed books to the local thrift shop.<br /><br />On the other hand, we&#039;ve had people bring armfuls of books (wanting to drop them off with us, not to sit and participate). Because we have to take all the books with us when we finish the swap, it doesn&#039;t work to have people leaving books and not staying to, uh, carry their weight. <br /><br />Jumpattack: I realize what it must be like living in such tight quarters and having to restrict your book purchases. But one of my great joys is finding a second-hand copy of a favorite book and buying it, so that I can force it on a friend and say &quot;Read this. Now.&quot;&nbsp; :lol:&nbsp; And you don&#039;t have to keep the books you acquire at a swap...you can give them back at the next meet. Consider it a long-term library loan, with no late fees!

				While not in Astoria, I request a lot of books and dvds to be held for me at the 58th/Lex branch. It&#039;s very nice.<br /><br />And as far as bookstores go, I&#039;ve been buying them online for a few years now. If you can have them delivered to your office in Manhattan, Barnes &amp; Noble delivers them the same day and for no delivery charge if over a certain amount.<br /><br />I know... people like browsing, and it is fun sometimes, but we have so much more to offer in Astoria - and you can&#039;t have it all!&nbsp; :wink:

				on the topic of book swapping. . . I&#039;m happy to bring books (in this case, due to space constraints, I&#039;m more of a giver than taker), but what kind of books are people interested in? I should say very quietly that I work at a p.u.b.l.i.s.h.i.n.g house shhhhh and will run into a few books now and then, but it would be great to know what to shlep over if I knew what to shlep.

				Books and CDs are what I&#039;m always buying like crazy.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the libraries that makes for the dearth of bookstores.&nbsp; The libraries have such inconvenient hours; the only branch I know of that&#039;s open on Saturdays is the Broadway branch.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s because Astoria has only recently become a neighborhood of readers, now is a bad time for indie bookstores and there&#039;s no place to put a Barnes &amp; Noble.

				I think Astoria has been lacking in bookstores because it&#039;s such a nice area to sit outside and talk to other people in. :-D There&#039;s no time to read.<br /><br />It&#039;s a good question, what makes a persont want to buy books, what makes a person go to a library instead.<br /><br />There&#039;s alway been people giving away books in A/LIC.&nbsp; They had to buy them somewhere, but aside from the one on Bway I don&#039;t remember ever seeing a store dedicated to selling new books.<br />

Sorry if I sound like I&#039;m banging on but my point (and opinion) was not that Astoria is “inferior” to other neighborhoods in Queens, it was that demographically, the population of Astoria traditionally has been comprised of a large number of immigrants or children of immigrants, many non-English speaking or non-native English speaking, which could pose a problem in sales, given that B&amp;N mostly sells many books printed in English. <br /><br />Also, I looked up average income and found that in 2004 the average salary/income of people listed on tax returns in Astoria was 37K per year (in 11105 – it was lower in the other Astoria zip codes). In the main zip code of Forest Hills it was 63K and in Bayside the average salary was 67K per year, which leads me to believe that people who live in those areas probably also have higher levels of education in addition to higher incomes – two factors that make these areas a highly attractive place for B&amp;N to operate in. <br /><br />The ‘youthful’, ‘cultured’, and ‘sophisticated’ place you describe is the Astoria of today, to which B&amp;N or Borders may finally notice and open a store to cater to. The Astoria of 10+ years ago, well, as much as I love this neighborhood, sophisticated? – eh not so much. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				You make some good points, especially about Astoria 10+ years ago.&nbsp; I do have some reservations about the income data, or at least, I&#039;d like to know more specifics.&nbsp; Do those tax returns include joint tax returns filed by married couples?&nbsp; If so, I&#039;d venture to guess that it would be a major factor in both Forest Hills and especially Bayside having a higher average income, as those areas are probably home to more &quot;traditional&quot; families than Astoria is.&nbsp; Especially Bayside, which is in some ways very suburban.&nbsp; Forest Hills may also be skewed by its one very affluent area, but Forest Hills also has an aging population and lots and lots and lots of poor immigrants of its own, who I don&#039;t think are regulars at B&amp;N.

				I agree with you about Forest Hills but as you describe it is also the Forest Hills of today, which has seen a big increase in immigrants from the former Soviet Union, many not as affluent as native residents in the neighborhood. Ten plus years ago this was not the case. And the income numbers may be skewed by the residents of the Forest Hills Gardens, but you cannot discount them -- money talks. Austin Street may be a small shopping street but it was once considered the most &#039;upscale&#039; in Queens.<br /><br />B&amp;N is a successful bookseller, so I would think they know what they are doing. Why do you think they opened stores in Bayside and Forest Hills and not Astoria?<br /><br /><br />I found the income data on a site www.city-data.com. It listed the following statitics:<br /><br />Bayside (11360): Average Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) in 2004: $67,056 (Individual Income Tax Returns)<br /><br />Forest Hills (11375): Average Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) in 2004: $63,239 (Individual Income Tax Returns)<br /><br />Astoria (11105): Average Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) in 2004: $36,720 (Individual Income Tax Returns)<br />

				Ive been out here a long time and yes things are changing.&nbsp; Just the fact that we have a Pizzaria Uno and a Panera now shows that the big boys are moving in.&nbsp; I&#039;d say there will be a borders before a B&amp;N but when I don&#039;t know.

				I feel so much better that there is an upscale pizza place in our community - it sort of negates everything else said. As to LIC being a fantastic place (wasn&#039;t this a discussion of Astoria?) I guess your idea to to hollow out our community like they did to Hunters Point and Dutch Kills, dangle some incentives to the homeowners to move, then bulldoze what is left.<br /><br />Yes, that is one solution, but you know, we kind of like it here just the way it is. You got a problem with that? <br /><br />And as a taxpayer and voting citizen (and someone who actually stayed awake during civics) I have every right in a public forum to comment that I expect my tax dollars to go towards improving my services (as opposed to satisfying campaign chits) and to vocalize my concerns on the deterioration that I, my friends, and neighbors see in the community around us. <br /><br />But this is really not a thread on your ideas or mine, but observations on the community. To the points raised I would invite you and others to post and make this a lively debate. It is perfectly fine to have a difference of opinion. It may make certain sectors, who crave glassy-eyed uniformity, uncomfortable, but, what can I say? Such is the nature of American political discouse since this republic was founded.<br /><br />One final point: that &#039;Greeenway&#039; bike lane is a $6 million dollar joke. Someone is going to get killed taking a bicycle into that traffic and it will become an impassible nightmare once all those buildings some of you want go up. If that is what they want to spend my taxes on, then they just might as well leave my hard earned money in my pocket. <br /><br />Our community deserves a waterfront park, not turning a valuable community resouce over to the highest bidder. This is what is happening in the rest of the county. I do not know a single example except the working class communities in Brooklyn and Queens who are treated like this. I do not know why new residents in LIC get a park (to say nothing about new wiring from Con Ed) while the rest of us get blank walls (and old rotten wiring that should have be replaced a decade ago).<br /><br />Those who made those discisions let us down and bury us in bullcrap when we question it. <br /><br />Pure and simple.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				&quot;I agree however that Astoria was not a prime area for a book store a few years back.&nbsp; It is now, and I would venture to say that we will have something move in here.&quot;<br /><br />Backed up by what stats, Debbie? <br /><br />If you look at the caliber of stores on Steinway over the past few decades and contrast them today, there is not an upgrade but deterioration. 99 cent stores and nail salons and places with cheap furniture. no store fronts and bins of flipflops. Many of the chains that opened in Astoria have branches in Corona, the Bronx, Jamaica and the like. Only 10 years ago there were three places I could by Florshiem shoes on Steinway. Today, I can shop on that street dress myself like a hip-hop artist. Seamans Furniture moves out, El Mundo Discount moves in.<br /><br />This is the opposite of trends in shopping in Manhattan or downtown Brooklyn. Even long term residents and boosters of the local shopping that have spent their entire lives on local streets have told me that they are sadly writing them off. I used to be proud of our shopping areas. Now they look like they way that 14th Street used to be. <br /><br />Take a look at the comments from posters on this board. Are they happy? Thread after thread on wishful thinking and dashed hopes. <br /><br />As to the cafes being filled with people, from my conversations with business leaders, it seems that a good portion of those patrons are people who do not live in our community. For example, the Greeks, like other ethnic groups, are moving out of Astoria. Being a tight-knit community, many come back here frequently to shop and hang out in those cafes.<br /><br />The big question is not why those cafes continue to grow (while their local population shrinks) but why the population of young professionals that supposedly are moving in have almost no impact on stores, meeting places, and the cultural life of our community. <br /><br />This is the kind of thing that B&amp;N looks for.

				Interesting points, Gleason. (Never thought I&#039;d say that...!)<br /><br />It does seem like shopping for clothes, furniture, housewares, etc., is less of an option in the neighborhood than it seems it used to be. On the other hand, the number of coffeeshops, non-Mediterranean restaurants, bakeries, specialty stores, etc., are growing rapidly.<br /><br />On the first point, I suspect that a lot of this has to do with the growing number of big-box stores farther out in Queens, and peoples&#039; ability to drive to Ikea to get furniture. I kinda doubt that the neighborhood is getting any poorer, looking at recent changes in rents and property values. Instead, people spend their money elsewhere. The Internet might take a little blame too, as people do more shopping on-line. <br /><br />While shopping can be &quot;outsourced&quot; to other neighborhoods efficiently, I strongly disagree that the quality of &quot;meeting places&quot; is decreasing at all. To the contrary. (Just on Ditmars alone, Freeze Peach, Oleput, Fatty&#039;s/Crescent and Vine, Waltz, etc., are all new and great meeting places.) And regarding &quot;a good portion of those patrons are people who do not live in our community&quot;, as far as I&#039;ve seen, this only applies to the Beer Garden. It may be that the old-timers don&#039;t recognize us yuppies as &quot;people who live in our community&quot;, but there certainly are plenty of yuppies here, and they support both the old-time butcher shops and the new-fangled organic groceries. They just don&#039;t buy shoes on Steinway.<br /><br />To restate, I assert that the changes in shopping patterns in Astoria over recent years are due to both Astoria-specific changes (more immigrants, more yuppies, higher property values), as well as to global patterns of more-efficient but less neighborhood-based shopping for major items. Both of these changes are probably good on balance, although I agree that there are an excessive number of 99 cent stores...<br />

				just a few quick notes as I would like others to post... tons of points raised in this tread that I would love to see others post on....<br /><br />The cafes &#039;catering to outsiders&#039; info came comments from my friends in both the Greek community and merchants.<br /><br />As to rents climbing in Astoria, so what? Go to East New York and Mott Haven - rents going through the roof in those communities, too. The local leaders and property owners I speak to don&#039;t feel that its from economic revitalization (that one got a dry laugh from one guy I talked to), but demand from immigrants &#039;pouring through broken borders&#039; in ones civic leader&#039;s words. <br /><br />I am pleased as punch on the places you did mention, but, if you read the paper and see stuff posted on the web they have a small presence. That footprint needs to be a hell of a lot bigger to catch the attention of corporate types in B&amp;N head office. You will need clothing stores and houseware stores and the like, as well as much more cultural activities at a level that will give a clear indication to them that the demographics fits their image.<br /><br />Merm, perhaps moving this thread to politics?

Am I confused? Don&#039;t we already have several? Astoria Park and its extension Demarco park. Socrates, Rainey, Queensbridge and our newest, Gantry. I say, not too shabby.<br /><br />Like it or not, the residential development in LIC replaced derelict, formerly manufacturing PRIVATELY OWNED land. In return for government help and a change in zoning the developers turned over a portion of their privately owned land for a public park so you can say our elected officials did get something back for the people.<br /><br />

The main reason why there are few housewares or clothing stores on Ditmars and the shopping streets in the neighborhood, aside from Steinway, has less to do with current immigration patterns and changes to the ethnic composition of the neighborhood than it&#039;s not how people shop any more. These types of shops left the avenues long, long ago, before the neighborhood &#039;changed&#039;.<br /><br />In fact started decades ago with the rise of shopping malls and branded stores -- simple as that. Malls pulled shoppers, selling branded items that people wanted to buy, away from the shopping streets here just as they did across the country. We are lucky though that other types of stores, mostly food-related, moved in and were able to find a market for their businesses. I say lucky because there are many towns and cities in this country with ghost towns for main streets.<br /><br />Everyone wants to return to this supposed golden age of yesteryear where you can buy everything you need within three blocks of your house, from Ma and Pa who own that treally authethenic shop. Its never going to happen.<br /><br />And finally, the neighborhood isn&#039;t getting poorer. It&#039;s pretty much as it always was. The only difference is the price of real estate, which is insane and shouldn&#039;t be used as a a marker or proof of anything.<br />

				I seem to remember an awful lot more 99 cent shops about ten years ago than there are today.&nbsp; Also, if I use myself as a typical Astorian, I drive to Bed, Bath and Beyond in the Bulova Center, Target in Whitestone, and I purchase books on Amazon.&nbsp; I also shop in Manhattan because I work in Manhattan and it is simply easier.&nbsp; I like the new Atlas Mall as well, and it is not far away.<br /><br />Now, if I was as thin as I would like to be, I have noticed some nice shops with unique women&#039;s clothing in Astoria, and they are not cheap.&nbsp; There is a place on 31st Street close to 21st Ave, the other place on 31st Street close to 23rd Ave, a place around 26th Street and 23rd Ave, a place around 31st Ave near 37th Street.&nbsp; They all seem to have interesting stuff.&nbsp; I think Steinway probably caters to a different crowd.

				There seem to be several different retail zones in Astoria - for example, you have the big box stores on Northern Blvd., chain eateries/entertainment near the Kaufman Astoria 14, discount stores on Steinway, restaurants on Broadway, more restaurants and cafes on 30 and 31 Aves.&nbsp; If a Barnes and Noble or Borders were to open in Astoria, I&#039;m thinking that it would be most likely to open on Northern Blvd. or near the Kaufman Astoria 14.<br /><br />But like 28Grand and Debbie pointed out, our consumer behaviors have changed.&nbsp; It would be great if more bookstores opened in Astoria, but even it they don&#039;t, I know that I can go somewhere else in Manhattan.&nbsp; I don&#039;t look at the lack of a national chain bookstore in Astoria as a sign of decline or that we&#039;re less well off than other Queens communities.&nbsp; I also think it would be great if another independent bookstore opened - why wait for a big chain?

				Also, if big retailers are a sign of prosperity, it is only over the past ten years that a Victoria&#039;s Secret, Bath and Body Works, Aerosoles and Starbucks opened on Steinway.&nbsp; With all due respect Gleason, I am not sure about Florsheim shoes.&nbsp; I know my Dad wore them to Church years ago but I am not sure what the reference has to do with anything.&nbsp; Please elaborate.<br /><br />My Mother, who is 78 years young goes to one particular shop on Steinway for her shoes.&nbsp; The shoes are expensive and made for people with foot issues.&nbsp; It is still around and she is delighted because she would have to go to Manhattan otherwise.<br /><br />Personally, I never loved Steinway and still don&#039;t.

Also not having a car I sort of don&#039;t even consider much of Northern -- it&#039;s easier to take the train in/out of Manhattan than walk or cab across the highway of Northern Blvd. It&#039;s not really a stretch of stores you want to amble down the way with -- it&#039;s like playing in the middle of I-80. <br /><br />In general, shopping is a vastly different experience for those with vs. without a car.

Even if somehow the total numbers were equal, they are widely spread out all-over Astoria -- there&#039;s no central traffic point or any area as concentrated as LIC will be or Court is. There is also Brookyn City Hall and the Fulton St mall (which is actually very Steinway-ish) which generate more people and pedestrians. I just don&#039;t see any single point of concentrated traffic like Court St or anywhere in Manhattan -- Astoria just doesn&#039;t have the same geography.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure plenty of people here would welcome one though -- I sure would! I just don&#039;t think the conditions exist. <br /><br />

				Well I sometimes pick up stuff on Steinway, as do many local residents; overall though, this strikes me as the applicable marketing-ese description:<br /><br />========================<br /><br />Segment 44 Urban Melting Pot<br /><br />This small market, rich in ethnicity and household types, includes recently settled immigrants. More than half of these residents were born abroad; half of them immigrated to the United States in the last 10 years. Most rent apartments in the urban canyons of large cities in high-density, high-rise, pre-1950s buildings. Their median age is 35 years, slightly younger than that of the U.S. population. Their median household income is approximately $36,700. Fashion conscious yet cost conscious, Urban Melting Pot residents love to shop. They enjoy the outdoors with trips to the beach and theme parks. Soccer is important to these residents; they play and attend matches. They purchase long-distance telephone cards and package deals offered by cell phone companies to keep in touch and save money. Reflecting their diversity in age and upbringing, their taste in music covers urban, Hispanic, and contemporary hits radio. <br /><br />========================<br /><br />I will now brace for expected dissent...

				Well, Barnes and Noble and Borders both have huge big box stores in plazas in suburban areas like Route 9 Wappingers Falls Dutchess County where they rely on car traffic only for business.&nbsp; Similarly, Queens Blvd and Northern Blvd has Best Buy, Target, The Mall - including Macy&#039;s and JCPenney, Stop and Shop, Pathmark, Sports Authority, Michaels Crafts, and Home Depot with parking lots and busy car business.&nbsp; Is the difference that we don&#039;t think people who drive cars in Queens don&#039;t read or speak English enough and so will not shop at a book store, but will go to Best Buy and grocery stores, etc. instead?&nbsp; I wonder what kind of business the big box book stores upstate do.&nbsp; For the record, I used to live on the R line for 4 years or so, and would always travel to Northern Blvd to go to all the big box stores.&nbsp; I came by subway only 2 blocks away, and felt the stores were worth the two blocks.&nbsp; I now live on Ditmars and am known to make 3 train transfers just to get to Target and the Mall.&nbsp; Are there just not enough people like me in Queens?&nbsp; I&#039;m not talking about Astoria here, because that area is on the border of LIC,&nbsp; Astoria, and Woodside/Elmhurst and gets busy traffic from all of Queens.

				Hmm not sure if &quot;let me get this straight&quot; was in response to the marketing-ese profile I posted; if so I have to say I&#039;m not familiar enough with the areas mentioned to agree or not. I do think the profile well-covers the vast majority of present-day Steinway, with of course aberrations up- and down-market price-wise. I don&#039;t understand why that would be controversial in any way (well unless you&#039;re a business owner trying to push things &quot;upscale&quot;). It&#039;s not like the many discount clothing/fashion and cell-phone stores, and large immigrant population are invisible or something. Nor should they be. They&#039;re apparently serving people well.<br /><br />As for &quot;Is the difference that we don&#039;t think people who drive cars in Queens don&#039;t read or speak English enough and so will not shop at a book store, but will go to Best Buy and grocery stores, etc. instead&quot; I personally don&#039;t know the answer, but I&#039;m sure B&amp;N knows the answer (statistically at least), and it seems at this point the answer may be &quot;no&quot;. Or at least not at levels sufficient for their store models/projections. [I do have a suspicion that the biggest buyers of electronics (think TV/games) are not the biggest book buyers. And that shopping at grocery stores probably has no relation to book-buying patterns.] <br /><br />Or maybe it&#039;s too expensive -- seriously -- B&amp;N is closing their Astor Place store in Manhattan, smack in the middle of the E.Vill/Village and NYU-town because the rent is too high. So it even happens to mega-chains.<br /><br />And for the record, yes, I think you&#039;re a little nutty to make 3 train transfers to get to Target and the mall. Some here might even yell at you for &quot;not supporting local businesses&quot; or similar. But if that works for ya, then why not do it?<br /><br />So I&#039;m still betting on LIC before Northern Blvd or Astoria; of course it&#039;s easy to bet since I&#039;ve got no money on the table!

				Well TAG, you are knowledgable about Court Street in Brooklyn and live in Sunnyside, but want us to accept that you have no idea about shopping in Corona and other parts of Queens, particularly immigrant areas. Perhaps you also believe that Main Street in Flushing has never looked better. <br /><br />I do know one thing, areas that fit your description (think 14th Street) are shrinking in Manhattan and Brooklyn and are being replaced by the type of environment that used to be on Steinway even a decade ago. And to my knowledge, no one is complaining.<br /><br />And 28 Grand, do you seriously claim that the caliber of shopping on Steinway Street is the same level as 5 or 10 years ago in terms of quality and diversity? Most of the posters on this board don&#039;t think so, but perhaps you like nail salons, patronize 99 stores, get your flipflops out of bins on the sidewalk and buy furniture at some of the new places on Steinway.<br /><br />if you do, then your opinions are understandable.

				The types of stores on Steinway are pretty much the same now as it was 10 years ago. In fact I&#039;d say there are more national chain stores now. The only stretch that could due with some improvement in my opinion is between Broadway and 34th avenue -- but if you&#039;re honest this block was ALWAYS somewhat of a problem and never had top caliber shops.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry to be blunt but the only difference between now and 10 years ago is that there are probably more Spanish-speaking shoppers and shops on Steinway, which I&#039;m beginning to think you have a problem with -- given that two of the other shopping streets you mention as a comparison and being sub-par, National in Corona and Fordham in the Bronx are located in predominately Spanish-speaking areas.<br /><br />I have a suggestion for you -- why don&#039;t you put a business plan togther and open the type of store you feel the street is so lacking.

If you didn&#039;t agree then fine by me.<br /><br />You then expanded the question to make a complaint against the quality and diversity of all stores in the neighborhood, not just Steinway, and in my opinion it was your complaint that was out of date because your complaint was based on patterns of shopping that had disappeared from the neighborhoods more than 10 years ago -- that&#039;s why I mentioned malls because that&#039;s what killed off the types of stores you&#039;re moaning about.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have many ideas about Steinway because I don&#039;t see much of a problem, yet.<br /><br />I do think some sprucing up needs to be thought about to make shopping on the street more pleasant and secondary maybe working with landlords to encourage them to rent to businesses that will have a long-term, positive impact on the neigborhood but as long as stores are rented and in business I&#039;m happy. Contrary to what you say, not everything is a bank nail salon or dollar store.<br /><br />You&#039;re right that the age and influence of the mall is over and I hope that will make it easier for local businesses. Unfortunately it seems to me that local shopping streets have to become either very high-end (which would be very damaging to the character of Astoria) or very-low end to survive, which is probably what worries you about Steinway. It&#039;s a possible problem but I in no way think it&#039;s in such dire straits as you imply.<br /><br />I do have one thought and maybe you can bring this to CALDC: One possible way to improve Steinway is encourage landlords to reconvert spaces above stores back into apartments, like they used to be. I think having people live on the street again would attract the types businesses you feel are lacking<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				As to bookstores in Astoria, when I moved here in &#039;96, there was a bookstore under the Ditmars stop of N line that sold mainly Greek titles and computer reference books.&nbsp; It also sold computers and offered printing/copy services.&nbsp; It got turned into an Italian Deli sometime around 1998.&nbsp; I know there was a lot of hope that the current Commerce Bank (that used to be a ladie&#039;s department store) was going to be a B&amp;N when it was converted back in 2002.<br /><br />I am so happy to have the bookstore on Ditmars and 33rd.&nbsp; The commercial rents in this area of Astoria have gone up so high that it would seem to be very difficult to the amount of inventory you would need to cover expenses, esp if you are competing with Amazon.com.&nbsp; But I am not in the book business.<br /><br />Am I the only one puzzled by the proliferation of banks taking over what used to be small shops and diners?&nbsp;

A decade ago, most big banks were shedding their branches, not building more. They steered their customers away from teller lines and encouraged them to use cash machines and telephone banking services, which were less expensive to operate. And many had grand visions of Internet banking, even if consumer-friendly technology had not yet arrived.<br /><br />Today, there has been a serious change of mind. Banks view their branches as gold mines, not costs. Their checking accounts can generate a steady stream of fee income. Their tellers can sign customers up for new products, spurring overall sales. All the while, branches can collect millions in cheap deposits that can be lent out at higher rates. Even as they offer options like online banking and kiosks in convenience stores, banks still hope to lure customers inside a physical branch.<br /><br />The upshot is that big banks are treating their branches more like traditional retail outlets than ever before. Bank of America’s New York regional manager is a former Barnes &amp; Noble executive who talks about his “distribution network.” Commerce promotes its evening and weekend hours; Wells Fargo executives refer to their branches as stores. And across the industry, there is greater focus on branding, customer service and placing more products — from home equity to retirement savings accounts — into existing customers’ hands. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/09/business/09banks.html

				In the limited knowledge I&#039;ve garnered on the subject, it seems like the bookstores that were once in Astoria were small and specialized, either to one language, subject or used books. Perhaps what makes the difference is that the capital to start up a large, diverse bookstore is larger than the capital needed to start a more specialized store and that the latter is more in line with Astoria start up capitals. However, the larger, less specialized a bookstore is, the more desireable it is to the community--that store that used to be under Ditmars wouldn&#039;t appeal to me or lots of others in the area--so those that buy books seek out those stores which are, tada!, in Manhattan.

				<br /><br />Interesting responses on this thread.<br /><br />Just focusing on the narrow point of bookstores, the store on Broadway seems to have had at least four or five names over the past ten years and a few owners. Seaburn, the current occupant, has three locations during that period of time.<br /><br />There was for a month or two, a discount bookstore in the old babies r us space on Northern and 48th.<br /><br />The future of small private bookstores is grim. AOL did an interesting little sidebar earlier this week and highlighted 5 things that may not last the decade, and inde book stores, like payphones and film stores do not have good prospects. Today you can go on abebooks.com and the like and order just about anything out of print. <br /><br />To truly understand the prospects of B&amp;N we should examine the direction of both local retailing and our community in general. This thread skirted the issue, then pulled back. <br /><br />On one hand, some claim that freshly minted yuppies are pouring into the community, then on the other, the local shopping districts are aligning themselves with other shopping areas in Queens by becoming ethnicly oriented. <br /><br />Can both be happening at the same time?<br /><br />Certainly the recent declining quality of both stores and merchandise is evident, something becomes glaringly obvious when compared to other parts of the city that successfully compete with us on B&amp;N locations. The trash that swirls around the retail districts certainly does not help.<br /><br />There are a lot of complaints that we all read about on this board on local shopping, complaints that have oddly not been picked up on this thread.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />I find it chilling, and a bit sad, that a segment of our community breezily has written off local shopping in favor of big boxes outside of our community. Some Astoria boosters there. <br /><br />What will happen to our community when they roof over the Sunnyside railyards?<br /><br />Yes, we can get a B&amp;N into our community. But this requires a lot of work, and fresh leadership. Couching arguments in terms that were discussed decades ago certainly makes this glaringly obvious.<br /><br /><br />

				I think that if a chain bookstore opened in Astoria and they were smart about it, they would include some foreign-language periodicals and books in their stock, as well as a good children&#039;s section.&nbsp; Don&#039;t forget, it&#039;s not just that a community has to have certain preconditions met before a chain moves in, but that the store also has to pitch itself to a community in order to be successful.

It seems blatantly obvious. It&#039;s a demographic fact, not any sort of slight to immigrants or non-English speakers. It&#039;s probably also the first thing any bank would ask a prospective indie bookstore owner asking for a small business loan. i.e. &quot;Is it actually feasible you&#039;ll be able to bring in enough money to pay back the loan? Who will your customers be?&quot; I don&#039;t think that should set off any PC-Police alarms.<br /><br />Interestingly, the &quot;...some claim that freshly minted yuppies are pouring into the community, then on the other, the local shopping districts are aligning themselves with other shopping areas in Queens by becoming ethnicly oriented.&quot; is pretty accurate on both counts, though I don&#039;t know about the word &quot;aligning&quot; -- that implies some coordination, which I don&#039;t think exists.<br /><br />The random marketing research website I got the long profile on (&quot;Segment 44 Urban Melting Pot&quot;) also listed two others -- basically yuppies and hipsters (this was for 11103). So yes, those crowds are starting to show up in marketing research, and yes, Steinway has probably become more spanish-speaking and/or twenty other languages over the years. Both can be true.<br /><br />I&#039;m still going with LIC (or nothing) for where a &quot;local&quot; B&amp;N could show up. Simple demographics. Point of evidence #1: there is no B&amp;N or Borders anywhere near Astoria already. And they have teams of people who research this stuff everyday.<br />

And that place is open late so you can always hit it up on ur way home from work. <br /><br />But more importantly SPEAK about the train yards!!!<br /><br />PS I did not read anything before the last page on this thread so plz don&#039;t yell at me if I missed some facts. :)

				The current construction going on in the Sunnyside railyards is the extension of the 63rd street tunnel (the one that the F train runs through) to link the up with the LIRR&nbsp; allowing LIRR trains to access Grand Central station.<br /><br />The deck over the railyards idea is a project that’s been either ‘threatened’ or ‘promised’ depending on your viewpoint, since at least the early 70s but nothing has ever come of it.<br /><br />There was a semi-serious plan floated in the 80s to build a deck and a stadium but it thankfully fell through.<br /><br /><br />

				I was honestly wondering if it was because the population is too diverse, therefore there would need to be multiple languages represented and no one is willing to take that on. Your thoughts?
