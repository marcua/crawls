				For some reason I woke up this morning to the sound of a very loud plane at 6:30am that shook the entire house.&nbsp; I then proceeded to hear every other plane that&#39;s going to LaGuardia.&nbsp; Most of the time I don&#39;t notice the planes, but this morning they seem to be nonstop.&nbsp; I&#39;ve never seen a rant on here about it before though.<br /><br />So here, I&#39;m ranting.<br /><br />These planes are f-in loud, man!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;:x

				Yeah, whats the deal today?&nbsp; When its heavy with rain and clouds, the planes come in lower which I understand. But what happened last night/today?&nbsp; Looks nice out.&nbsp; <br /><br />Daisy, did you piss off some pilots or something?

				Jonathan - I was about to say the same thing, that this usually happens when it is stormy and raining. Oh well. I didn&#39;t notice it myself this morning - usually it is the helicopters in the middle of the night that bother me.

				yeah, the plane woke my wife up too (i didn&#39;t hear it though).&nbsp; Is that unusual?<br /><br />Also, what is the deal with the helicopters?&nbsp; (We just moved here, so forgive me for asking if this is obvious).&nbsp; Every morning starting at about 4 or so I hear all these choppers.&nbsp; I can only assume that they are traffic helicopters checking out the triborough bridge.&nbsp; Is this right?<br /><br />either way, can&#39;t wait till it gets cooler so I can sleep with the windows shut!<br />

				I don&#39;t know why those helicopters are there. Sometimes I get it into my head that they are police, but you could be right - they could be traffic related.

				I heard the planes this morning too - they are much noisier than I would have expected, and I woke up earlier than usual, and it took a while to figure out from where and what the sound was coming.

				I wonder if actually what you were hearing were the turbines at the power plant, and not plains.&nbsp; I know they can be incredibly loud, and resemble jet engines.

				I&#39;m down just South of Broadway, I think I&#39;m too far from the plants to hear them, and it was just in the morning.&nbsp; I thought it was the subway at first, but it&#39;s never that loud and when I hear them I hear them enter and leave the station, and this was just one sound, though it happened quite a bit this morning.&nbsp; I suspect if I hadn&#39;t woken up early, I would have slept right through them.

				I noticed the noise too.&nbsp; Every now and then, they&#39;ll alter the flight patterns for a day or two.&nbsp; However, if it was going on and on, it may well have been the turbines of the new power plant they&#39;re building down the street from the Steinway factory.<br /><br />The helicopter flight path, both for police copters and for commuter/wall street ones, does go over the Ditmars area.&nbsp; It seems more noticeable on some days, but I don&#39;t know why.&nbsp; I did in fact see a police helicoptor flying directly overhead this morning at Ditmars and 35th St.

				Noise, noise, noise!&nbsp; You can&#39;t get away from it.&nbsp; Too much, too loud, too incessant.&nbsp; What difference does it make if it&#39;s planes or turbines or whatever?&nbsp; I didn&#39;t even hear whatever you all heard this morning but there is so much noise it. is. driving. me. CRAZY.

				More than likely it&#39;s planes that are taking off and not coming in for a landing that we hear so loudly. When it&#39;s stormy (or when the wind blows in a certian direction) planes will take off heading out over the water. It&#39;s safer in low visibility to have a plane take off over water obviously so that if there&#39;s a problem they don&#39;t blindly land on houses.<br /><br />The problem is though that when the take off in that direction we are directly behind the engines as they climb out after takeoff. You hear a loud rumbling for a minute or two then it quiets down as they make their turn. It can get really annoying when you&#39;re trying to sleep, that&#39;s for sure.

				Id say it was definitely a plane this morning.&nbsp; too many people all over Astoria heard it.<br /><br />When ever a plane flies too low on a nice sunny day I still get spooked.<br /><br />

				It is the planes. When the wind blows strongly from the airport into LIC they can be heard clearly. Also, when there is little traffic, as an evening when they play the Superbowl and many people are in front of the tube, the city gets quiet and the airport is heard clearly. Its eerie. Check it out. <br /><br />Groups like UCCA routinely have meetings -- with seemingly little effect except to plant in people&#39;s minds that something of substance is being accomplished by talking talking talking about this. Newspapers going back to the 1940s had complaints about airport noise with a big spike on the issue when they converted to jet traffic about 1960. If you think things are bad, go out the Flushing or East Elmhurst. I recall the Concorde thundering overhead once while near Kennedy.<br /><br />Again, Queens benefits from really great planning. Get used to it. The bottom line is indifference by our leadership on both noise and pollution from the airports (except getting headlines as they talk about it.) They lack the ability, or perhaps the desire, to do anything of substance about this problem. <br /><br />And yes, the airports rank right up there with automobiles and power plants&nbsp;adding to our already dangerous levels of pollution (off thread, did anyone see all those dead birds at the power plant up in Steinway?)

				I never paid attention before, but I heard the choppers this morning at 7:15am on my way to work.&nbsp; And now that I realize, I probably hear them all the time.&nbsp; I guess I am so not in tune anymore with what&#39;s up in the sky.
