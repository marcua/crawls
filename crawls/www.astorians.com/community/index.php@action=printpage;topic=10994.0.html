				So I found an old thread with recommendations for medical doctors in Astoria (not too many actually) from 2006.&nbsp; I was wondering if any one had any new suggestions recently.&nbsp; I would prefer a doctor in Astoria but if not then someone who is fairly close by car or train.

				as promised, my review of Dr. Harris. She was very polite, however, she was very young, and I found her to be rather condesending. I got the impression that she became a doctor for the sake of the accomplishment of having become a doctor, rather than because she wanted to help heal people. Her mannerisms/body language made me extremely uncomfortable, and I felt that she kept asking me the same questions over and over because she was trying to goad answers she wanted to hear out of me. <br />Let us know if you find a good doctor :)

				So, this Dr. Pippia guy that accepts patients without insurance, that all of you love so much - does he have evening/weekend hours? As is so happens, I quit my job and my insurance went out the window with it, and my new job doesn&#039;t give me insurance for the first three months (which I believe is standard and I am not complaining) and it turns out I need to get immunization shots for mumps and measles and blah blah and have proof of immunization by August 4th. Timing has always sucked for me, ALWAYS!<br /><br />Does Dr. Pippia do those shots? Does he have evening or weekend hours? Hell, does anyone know where I can get these immunization things, without insurance, this or next weekend?

				I just started to go to Dr Ewa Wierzba at Manhattan Medical 934 Manhattan Ave in Greenpoint, Brooklyn tel 718 389 8585.<br />She is very kind, patient and observant. the office is very efficient in an Eastern European way but friendly.<br />I had seen a Dr in Woodside who was abrupt and made an inaccuatre diagnosis.<br />Dr Wierzba asked lots of questions before making her diagnosis and wasn&#039;t afraid to say she was unsure about one issue for which she refered me to a specialist.<br />

				Also a patient of one of the docs mentioned here, and like them a lot. However, I&#039;m wondering if anybody else has been a little frustrated at times?<br /><br />This weekend, I left a note and a phone message with the office, but no response. The doc&#039;s not on vacation, though, and I ended up having to scrounge up some prescription meds from a retired doctor in the family. Another family member (also a doctor) said that leaving me hanging with this particular infliction was pretty inexcusable (when not treated quickly, can be dangerous.) <br /><br />This is the second time a health professional has told me bluntly, &quot;You need to switch docs; this behavior is unprofessional.&quot;<br /><br />What sucks is I&#039;d rather not, and just wonder if these are coincidences or if others have experienced anything similar. If so, feel free to respond in a PM.
