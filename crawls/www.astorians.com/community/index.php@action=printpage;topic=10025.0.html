				Crazy Horse and Custer by Stephan Ambrose.&nbsp; I have been trying to read this book for years and I finally commited myself to it this time.&nbsp; I love books about history, especially American history.&nbsp; Also, Stephan Ambrose is a great writer (he wrote Band of Brothers which the HBO movie was based on).&nbsp; I have just about all his books and they are all great.

				I&#039;m currently reading VALIS by Phillip K Dick. It&#039;s great. I really love almost all of his stuff, but A Scanner Darkly is my favorite. I just finished reading Richard Pevar and Larrissa Volonhsky (sp?)&#039;s translation of War and Peace. It was such an awesome book and it took me a while, but it really felt like an accomplishment.<br /><br />Do most people reread books? I&#039;ve only once read a book cover to cover twice. I always feel like there are *so many* books I need to read that it would be bad to spend my time rereading something.

Even movies I really love--if it&#039;s depressing I don&#039;t feel up to it. Speaking of depressing books, though, I recently finished <em>In the Time of the Butterflies</em>. It actually wasn&#039;t as depressing/intense as I thought it would be. Julia Alvarez sort of softened it, I think. I definitely reccomend it, as well as <em>How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents</em>.<br /><br />And of course, if you want somethign REALLY depressing, The <em>Massacre at El Mozote</em> is a really great book, but it is very depressing. I feel awful just looking at it, and yet, sometimes I can&#039;t resist picking it up and reading through it, I think, just to torture myself...

If you liked Norwegian Wood, which is by far his most accessible work, you might want to try South of the Border, West of the Sun next. It is also pretty accessible. Hard Boiled-Wonderland is a little stranger, but still not as out there as Wind-Up. His short stories in Dance, Dance, Dance and After the Quake are also pretty easy to get into. Try those and then Hard-Boiled before you get into the more bizarre Wind-Up and Kafka on the Shore.

(David Fincher (Zodiac, Fight Club), directing; Morgan Freeman tentatively starring). <br /><br />I&#039;m currently reading Berlin Diaries (http://www.librarything.com/work/details/20845282), a book I got at the book swap many months ago. It&#039;s the diaries of an exiled Russian royal who lived in Berlin (and other places) during WWII, and who knew many of the plotters of the July 20th plot on Hitler&#039;s life personally. Fascinating.

				Am I reading? It feels like I read about 2 books a year. So I may be up to 1980 by now.<br /><br />I really like the suggestion of re-reading some classics. Quite a fan of Twain, so I might want to pick up his works again.<br /><br />That Berlin Diaries sounds quite interesting.<br /><br />I pretend to myself that I am reading Snowcrash and Namesake.<br />[ I also want to read some more of Clarke. btw, if I could have a nickel for every film project Fincher is working on ... but would love to see Rendezvous make the big screen.]<br /><br />Read Moon is a harsh mistress. A classic but far from my favorite writing style.<br /><br />Audacity of Hope by guess who. A collection of speeches. But I like the speeches.<br /><br />Born Standing Up - by Steve Martin.<br />Many of you probably know that he is a very good writer. I guess I like celebrity autobios. This one does not seem to me to be a wide audience book, but several readers really like it. For me, I like the nostalgia of Disneyland opening up, his luck breaking into showbiz, and his approach to comedy.<br />I will leave it to others to write the book about his life that I would want to read more.<br /><br />Are you reading any comedies/ funny books now?

Not for the censorship, but for her description of her book &quot;Forever&quot;. <br />And I&#039;ll tell ya what, parents have a responsibility to check the influences on their children. Sometimes they might get over defensive, but it beats the hell out of the alternative.<br /><br />I&#039;ll stop my rant now.

				I think it&#039;s far more healthy for a girl to equate sex with responsibility than with punishment.&nbsp; I don&#039;t find it disturbing at all.&nbsp; I find it realistic.&nbsp; &nbsp;I read many a Judy Blume book as a teen and still do.&nbsp; I think I turned out fine.

I&#039;ll always remember how at the end of <em>Forever </em> (spoiler alert), Kathy&#039;s father tells her, &quot;Theo called&quot;--it really brings it home that her relationship with Michael is really over, and that life goes on. I always had it in the back of my mind when I was growing up, so it really prepared me for reality. Just because you feel like the one you&#039;re with is THE ONE doesn&#039;t mean he is...it&#039;s basically the polar opposite of all the &quot;happily ever after&quot; tripe young girls are fed, and if you ask me that is way more dangerous than a Judy Blume book. Oh, and for the record, I read Forever when I was about 13 or so, and by then I had already read my share of bodice rippers, which I read on my grandmother&#039;s front porch, and FYI Forever wasn&#039;t worse than any of those...if anythign it was realistic, informative. <br /><br />BTW, one of my professors said she read <em>The Godfather </em> when she was twelve--talk about smut!!!

				I just finished reading a Star Called Henry by Roddy Doyle and am starting the second in this particular series called Oh Play That Thing.<br /><br />I find myself ridiculously engrossed in his books.<br /><br />To whoever mentioned Gregory MaGuire, I&#039;ve read Wicked, Son of a Witch and Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister.

				I am half way through the book The Double Bind by Chris Bohjalian. I had picked it up because I loved his other book Midwives. I have gotten so into The Double Bind that I even, though embaressed to admit it, got on the wrong train the other day because I could not stop reading. I would recommed both his books.

				Predictably Irrational, by Dan Ariely - it&#039;s a fascinating book.&nbsp; He talks about how intelligent, reasonble people make illogical decisions everyday, and he conducts many interesting experiments that prove his point.&nbsp; It is already making me question some of things I do, and I haven&#039;t even finished it yet.&nbsp; I usually prefer fiction, but I am loving this book!

				Judy Blume - I loved her as a kid - all my friends did too.&nbsp; We all signed up for the waiting list at the library for each new book she wrote.&nbsp; I was in 4th grade when my friends were reading Forever (one of them owned a copy - it wasn&#039;t in our elementary school library).&nbsp; My mom forbade me to read it... which of course made me want to read it all the more.&nbsp; I remember being confused by the fact that her friend Sybil was fat - yet she&#039;d been &quot;laid 6 times.&quot;&nbsp; In my 4th grade head - being fat meant you couldn&#039;t possibly be having sex so I couldn&#039;t figure out what &quot;laid&quot; was.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />anywho... I&#039;m currently reading The Book Thief by Markus Zusak.&nbsp; I&#039;m finding it entertaining - but not a real page turner. <br /><br />I just finished &quot;Memory Keepers Daughter&quot;&nbsp; I thought it was pretty lame.&nbsp; My mom gave it to me - she hadn&#039;t been impressed either yet all her friends were RAVING about it... she was happy to have me verify that it was .... eh. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				By that point I was more into it than you seem to be. Not as engrossed as the last book I was reading but I was drawn into the Book Thief story and the whole Death as a narrator thing.<br /><br />Which reminds me, The Girl in the Red Coat&nbsp; by Roma Ligoka is a phenomenal memoir of growing up and surviving WWII. I couldn&#039;t put the book down. I was reading it everywhere, even on the street on my walk home! (it&#039;s one block without a lot of foot traffic so I wasn&#039;t being <em>that</em> person).
