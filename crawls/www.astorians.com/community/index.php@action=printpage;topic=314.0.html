				hello all!<br /><br />this is Rosemary. &nbsp;you are getting this email because you signed up to be on the Astoria Community Garden Planning Meeting List. (some of you may have met me today at the Rev Billy thing...)<br /><br />what a great day! it was a chilly but beautiful day!<br /><br />i started off my day by going to the demonstration that Rev. Billy and the Church of Not-Shopping had in Astoria (www.revbilly.com). &nbsp;it was so great to hear everyone's comments, both of lament, and of hope. &nbsp;<br /><br />i was one of the people offering a glimpse of hope... we are trying to gather interest in starting a new community garden in astoria in efforts to have our own gardening space, grow our own produce, increase green space in our community as well as strengthening the ties of community we have here. <br /><br />during our meeting at Freeze Peach (a GREAT cafe who's mission is to create community www.freezepeach.org) we had a special guest: Sandra R. from ARROW Garden (www.arrowonline.org).<br /><br />Sandra was very helpful and informational in sharing with us her story in how she got her first garden started. some of her tips included splitting up tasks into small bits for each group member, gathering the group members and doing activities in the community to gather more interest (having &nbsp;a plant sale/swap in the park, etc), as well as partnering up with her garden/group in getting support and resources.<br /><br />speaking of which, Sandra's Garden, ARROW will be having a meeting on Saturday, March 19 at 3pm at the ARROW garden ( 35-30 35th Street, Astoria Queens). &nbsp;this will be a meeting where people can sign up to have a plot! Sandra says the plots cost $10 per year. Robyn and I are seriously thinking of getting ourselves a plot! how exciting! you should join us! this will keep us motivated! <br /><br />well, this email is getting long, but it was great day, and i'm really excited, and i'm so glad we have new members in our group. please keep in touch! we should be having another meeting in April, so keep your eyes peeled for emails/new messages on the blog, astorians.net, etc. <br /><br />Let's make this dream come true!!<br /><br />Rosemary (and Robyn)<br />www.astoriacommunitygarden.blogspot.com<br /><br />some links you might want to know:<br />ARROW Garden www.arrowonline.org<br />a great Astoria forum www.astorians.net<br />a great cafe www.freezepeach.org<br />for more on the Remson House and information on historical buildings in Astoria, www.astorialic.org<br />Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop-Shopping<br />www.revbilly.com
