				I walked past MP Taverna yesterday and was surprised to see that it was closed.&nbsp; There was a sign on the door saying they were temporarily closed because of something that has to do with outdoor seating and that they would be open on Wednesday.&nbsp; I think this is strange because they had this outdoor seating since they&#039;ve been open and didn&#039;t have any problem with it.&nbsp; I think there is another reason for the closing

				Something bigger seems to be going on in this area as Sandwich Bar started a renovation yesterday. My thought is that someone checked the sidewalk permits and is giving out fines to anything that isn&#039;t perfect.&nbsp; Hopefully MP will be open again today as it&#039;s one of my favourite restaurants.

				What does the outdoor seating have to do with the place closing? They have indoor seating, correct? Double talk for something else like a health issue or building issues.
