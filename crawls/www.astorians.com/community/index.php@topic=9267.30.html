								<div class="inner" id="msg_110524">Lol, I can see the paradox in my post, but I do agree with you in principle.&nbsp; I also find no inherent moral dilemma with incomes based solely on market competition.&nbsp; Where we differ, however, is in the worlds which are operating within.<br /><br />The strict market economic model which you espouse is steeped in a theoretical world, rather similar to the theoretical world in which a strict command economic model would also be sucessful in.&nbsp; Both ignore social realities.&nbsp; So while I concurr with your views on the strict economic ramifications of minimum wage laws (I&#039;m sorry I did not communicate myself well on this, as I saw that four-fifths of your post dealt specifically with such), I can&#039;t agree with your opinion that they are harmful on the balance.&nbsp; Social unrest, labor unrest, crime and physical coercion must not be excluded from the equation.<br /><br />I&#039;m interested to see how my concept of wealth is obsolete.&nbsp; The pen/magazine story has been going on since the Eygptians sent their excess gold down to Canaan for lumber.&nbsp; While I do appreciate the absolutes noted in your previous post (a 15th century king v. 20th century $35,000 salary) and I attempt to personally live my life thankful of such a prosperity we enjoy today, that again ignores the social realities.&nbsp; Wealth is not an absolute, it is a relative and to treat it as an absolute disregards the human condition.&nbsp; How exactly is assertion that a severe inequity in wealth distribution is dangerous is obsolete?<br /><br />I can tell you that throughout history, such thinking has not been oboslete.&nbsp; Severe inequities of wealth distributions are almost always one of the chief components of the downfall of most civilizations.&nbsp; The Greeks in the 3rd century BC, Roman Republic in 2nd century BC, Roman Empire in the 5th AD, Bryzantines (nearly!) in the 7th century, Franks in the 10th Century, Croats in the 11th century, Spanish in 17th, French in 18th, Russians in 20th.&nbsp; The Chinese made something of a sport of it, with a new change in dynasty every two or three hundred years or so.&nbsp; The interesting times are when the moneyed elite become cognizant of this and they redistributed the wealth (without a revolution from below).&nbsp; The Athenians of Solon and the Bzyantine reforms of the 9th century come to mind.&nbsp; In both situations, everyone became more properious, <span class="bbc_u">including</span> the wealthy who redistirbuted their wealth.&nbsp; <br /><br />Finally on wage slavery.&nbsp; Your response to it was again attached to the minumum wage.&nbsp; Wage slavery is based on the premise that money is not simply a tool, it is a form of power and it in itself can be coercive (more so than a Castro-henchman).&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying its upto the individual business owner to solve it, nor that it is even a concious policy which is being pursued, but it exists nonetheless and it represents a danger, as well as a moral stain, to the republic.&nbsp; </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_110670">I&#039;ve&nbsp; been in Astoria&nbsp; for nearly&nbsp; 40 years, with several years&nbsp; away&nbsp; in the service and traveling. I could&nbsp; have&nbsp; predicted&nbsp; the increase in everything, when Manhattanites &#039;discovered&#039; how&nbsp; &nbsp;8-)&nbsp; Astoria&nbsp; is and moved here. To them it VERY cheap. So, the old&nbsp; small shops&nbsp; started moving out, Starbucks and banks&nbsp; on every corner with the disposable income&nbsp; &#039;singles&#039;&nbsp; moving in have created the situation. Wall Street was always raking in the bucks, it had nothing to&nbsp; do with little Astoria.&nbsp; There is&nbsp; a bright side, maybe, when it gets&nbsp; too congested, many will move out and old Astoria&nbsp; will be back again.&nbsp; :-)</div>

Both ignore social realities.<br /><br />Absurd, right? But why? They&#039;re both &quot;just theories,&quot; right?&nbsp; :roll:<br /><br />Economics as a science focuses on studying human action: It is concerned with *what human beings really do*.<br /><br />Economics investigates and examines the costs, motivations, and consequences of human action (including human rules/social structures) given the nature of humans as valuing and acting individuals with certain abilities and limits operating in the context of the natural world and human society. <br /><br />Economics as a science does not tell us what humans should or should not do. The role of an economist vis-a-vis public policy set by politicians is to discover the impact of those policies on people&#039;s lives. <br /><br />There is a centuries old research project (broadly speaking, it&#039;s called classical liberalism) that has developed and continues to refine our economic understandings. It is now understood that prosperity (people living longer lives with more choices and more wealth), not the theory of prosperity, but the real lived phenomenon, arises consistently when individuals are free to seek their own ends, according to their own individuality and awareness of the specifics of their time and place. <br /><br />The failure of central planning to produce prosperity has been observed, its problems perceived, documented, studied, and explained. Your haphazard support of minimum wage laws is, to be blunt, mystical. The real world effect (&quot;social reality&quot;) of minimum wages is that people are fired, jobs that would be created in one place are pushed underground or overseas or simply never get to exist. You speculate about all hell breaking loose (see your next quote) if people are hired at market rates instead of rates set by the government. Your speculation does not correspond to what happens when people contract to work jobs at rates the market will bear.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=9267.msg110524#msg110524">Quote from: Frappe on January 28, 2008, 09:31:16 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">So while I concurr with your views on the strict economic ramifications of minimum wage laws (I&#039;m sorry I did not communicate myself well on this, as I saw that four-fifths of your post dealt specifically with such), I can&#039;t agree with your opinion that they are harmful on the balance.&nbsp; Social unrest, labor unrest, crime and physical coercion must not be excluded from the equation.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So, one question that occurs to me is: By what right does a person tell another person what price he or she can exchange his or her labor for? If you attempted to explain to an unemployed person your speculation that &quot;social unrest, labor unrest, crime, and physical coercion&quot; might be the result of allowing her to contract with an employer for $2.45 an hour, she might wonder aloud about how you know this will happen (news flash, you have no basis for knowing this will happen) before asking you how the hell what she does is any of your business (it really isn&#039;t).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />You would say that her unemployment helps us to live in a better society. What is her next best option, in your opinion? To leave our society? To take jobs off the books and hope she doesn&#039;t get caught and fined/imprisoned? Maybe you&#039;ll propose that there should be organizations, perhaps the government, that will offer job training so that she qualifies for better paying jobs? That would not change the underlying reality: there are producers who need certain jobs filled that do not require higher levels of knowledge or skill, and there will always be people qualified to take on those jobs who will be denied access to those opportunities because of minimum wage laws.<br /><br />Advocating for a minimum wage is morally and practically untenable. Morally, because no person should have the right to interfere in the relationships other adults form with one another based on mutual consent. And practically because the existence of minimum wage laws only has the effect of driving low-paying jobs underground or overseas, not eliminating them. Like what results from all forms of prohibition, law-abiders are screwed, decent people are made into law-breakers for engaging in behavior that is peaceful and productive, and, of course, a black market will thrive. <br /><br />Minimum wage laws are one of many misguided attempts by a coalition of well-intentioned, arrogant, and manipulative people to design human society. Prosperity is not the outcome of design, no matter how well-intentioned or intelligent. Prosperity is not the point of these laws. Politicians propose minimum wages and then propose raising them for a variety of reasons that all point in the direction of their being re-elected. </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_110954">But, Communism did not succeed.&nbsp; In the end, people need something to strive for, a reason to excel and achieve above the average/expected level, and that &quot;carrot in front of their noses&quot; to truly be happy.&nbsp; The capitalist system, while flawed in the distribution of wealth, provides a &quot;reason&quot; for the average citizen to strive to better themselves and a goal (wealth) for them to work to achieve.<br /><br />The fatal flaw in capitalism is greed.&nbsp; This flaw is broad and covers quite a bit.&nbsp; First, it hits people in becoming crazed in their push for wealth.&nbsp; Examples of this are Tulip Mania, The South Sea Bubble, the Florida Land Bust, the dot.com, and, now, the real estate bubble.&nbsp; People saw easy money and ignored rational thinking and the inevitable changing of cycles.&nbsp; They figured RE values would continue up and they, armed with easy credit, bid homes to astronomical values.&nbsp; Look at a chart of the Case/Shiller home index (On the 2nd page of this great article: <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/real-estate/article/104341/Housing-Meltdown" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://finance.yahoo.com/real-estate/article/104341/Housing-Meltdown</a>).&nbsp; Starting in 2000, home prices skyrocketed and were only carried further by the average greedy citizen that had NO CLUE about home values; but they were armed with all sorts of stories and 767,865,786 TV shows and books telling and showing them the path to easy millions.<br /><br />The second part of the fatal greed flaw in capitalist society is the reluctance of many of the wealthy to &quot;share&quot; their wealth with those that are less fortunate.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t have to be in the literal sense of handing off their money; but it can also be in the sense of donating to clinics, schools, and youth programs.&nbsp; We don&#039;t place enough importance on this in our society.&nbsp; Perhaps it is greed; perhaps it&#039;s because many wealthy believe that the government should take care of those things with their tax dollars.<br /><br />IMHO, we have to work to find a happy medium.&nbsp; We need capitalism to provide the spark and drive to achieve greatness for so many people.&nbsp; However, we need a little communism to be instilled on the ones that succeed in becoming wealthy.&nbsp; It could be done by giving better tax breaks for donating large portions of money.&nbsp; Or, it could be done by overhauling the current tax code to a fair tax system so those that spend more, truly pay more.<br /><br />In the end though, I don&#039;t think it is a good thing that our government is meddling so much in the stock market.&nbsp; This decline is very needed and, with any hope, will help bring reality and sanity back to the housing markets.&nbsp; If we have a particularly bad recession, sustained flat market (like the 1970s), or even a depression, it could really help to reign in this massive debt and re-instill the importance of SAVING in they younger generations of our society.<br /><br />If the Fed keeps meddling and debt keeps increasing, it will eventually collapse and, if it continues to grow unimpeded, that collapse could be very catastrophic.<br /><br />(P.S. Sorry if this gets a bit rambling; I&#039;m doing 5 things at once and my thoughts are jumping everywhere).</div>

Socialism is (an outrageously well-received) speculative hypothesis. <br /><br />Why is socialism a widely accepted idea? Probably as a result of its free lunch promises (so enticing), its deep reliance on the popular morality of sacrifice (thank you major world religions), its emphasis on nonmaterialistic virtues (starving as transcendence, thanks again religions), its hypocritical but insistent emphasis on the power of reason (central planning is possible, if we treat people like disposable machine parts!), and its play on the psychology of envy and wish-fulfillment (feel taller by kicking wealth people in the shins). <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=9267.msg110926#msg110926">Quote from: Frappe on February 05, 2008, 11:28:44 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">2.&nbsp; Agreed on comments about economics being a science, however, since you are taking it past simple economics and you are clearly advocating a policy change, you are undertaking the role as a politician.&nbsp; So what&#039;s the point of that statement with regards to the discussion?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />One of the rules I&#039;m following is &quot;first do no harm.&quot;&nbsp; My policy change advocacy is based on a harm reduction strategy. Presumably, people don&#039;t elect government officials to create problems, make people&#039;s lives more difficult, increase costs of living, cut off opportunities, cause deprivation or shortages of goods and services, etc.&nbsp; But government officials, through faulty economic policies given the force of law and harsh noncompliance penalties, are hurting people. Let&#039;s make them stop!<br />&nbsp; <br />Coercive wealth transfer laws, like tariffs and minimum wages, harm people. The harm is direct (jobs disappear) and indirect (opportunity costs, the wealth and/or options that would have been created, but now won&#039;t be).&nbsp; Now pointing that out and calling for the repeal of those laws is the next logical step. Politicians created these problems, and prodded by an (eventually, sooner-rather-than-later please!) educated and infuriated electorate, they have to clean them up. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=9267.msg110926#msg110926">Quote from: Frappe on February 05, 2008, 11:28:44 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">3.&nbsp; Classical Liberalism stems from humanism, which is the thought that humans are rational beings and that they shall make good, rational decisions if given the opportunity and access to information.&nbsp; From this, two distinct strains of though developed:&nbsp; The first is very similar to your opinion:&nbsp; Leave people alone as much as possible and on the <span class="bbc_u">macro</span> level, people will make the right choices (Classical Liberalism).&nbsp; The second strain sees humanity as an interacting unit rather than dispersed individuals:&nbsp; It is within the power of humans to conjure a world in which they can use their rational and intellegence to benefit their society on a <span class="bbc_u">macro</span> level (i.e. social welfare laws). </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>&nbsp; <br /><br />In the U.S., a strange propaganda war against socialism targeted the word liberalism, which is now a word cut off from its actual, derived meaning, which led partly to the birth of the unwieldy word &#039;libertarianism.&#039; I prefer liberalism, but it&#039;s only by qualifying it as &quot;classical&quot; that people clearly understand that one doesn&#039;t mean socialism, which, again, is ridiculous, but c&#039;est la vie. <br /><br />There&#039;s liberalism, which recognizes the individual and his/her liberty as the moral basis for human society, and there&#039;s socialism, which subordinates individual liberty to the so-called good of society. Liberalism versus Socialism, liberty versus society. Does society exist to serve the individual or do individuals exist to serve society? <br /><br />Classical liberalism does not view individuals as &quot;dispersed.&quot; Pure bullpoop. It recognizes individuals as what they are: acting, valuing, unique egos, with their own particulars of space and time, their own perspectives based on their individuality, experiences, culture, environment.&nbsp; Liberalism recognizes the fundamental right of every individual to operate according to his or her own goals, thoughts, preferences, and priorities. This means that when individuals interact with one another, there must be mutual respect for this basic right. Ergo, all relationships are based on mutual consent. But there are relationships, Frappe. Dispersed? What a silly notion. Have you ever read Adam Smith&#039;s scientific observations of people of all different cultures interacting? Liberalism recognizes the right a person to live outside of society, but it is based on the proper basis for relationships between people as they naturally emerge.&nbsp; <br /><br />Liberal relationships are voluntary; socialist relationships are involuntary. It&#039;s that simple. Liberal societies require governments that uphold each individual&#039;s liberty. Socialist societies require that each individual serve the needs of every other individual.<br /><br />The U.S. is swinging hard in the direction of socialism. For example, Hillary isn&#039;t inhibited by the notion that voluntary consent is the core value of a free society. She&#039;s psyched about mandating... that&#039;s her b.s. word, but really, she&#039;s brazenly motivated to FORCE people to behave the way she needs them to for her health care system to work. She has a vision for a new America, she&#039;s stated over and over, explicitly, that her vision is going to require sacrifice, that her changes won&#039;t be easy or popular, but she believes we&#039;re all up to the challenge.... of being FORCED by her.... to make America better.&nbsp; This is no different from the &quot;change&quot; that Obama promises, by the way. But I still prefer him to her.&nbsp; <br /><br />Wasn&#039;t America founded on the idea that governments must be subordinate to individual liberty? Isn&#039;t that what makes our country so different from the rest of the world? Isn&#039;t that why they come here? <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=9267.msg110926#msg110926">Quote from: Frappe on February 05, 2008, 11:28:44 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> This is called New Liberalism.&nbsp; The superiority of one over the other is not &quot;understood&quot; nor self-evident.&nbsp; But thanks for the cute tip on the centuries old research project.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&quot;New Liberalism?&quot; That&#039;s ridiculous. There&#039;s nothing new about the socialist public policies Hillary and Obama want to impose. And there will be nothing new about their failures, either.&nbsp; <br /><br />If it is self-evident to you that you have a moral right to your own body and to choose your own purpose work toward it, and that the only moral basis for human relationships is voluntary, mutual consent, then the inferiority of socialism should be self-evident to you, as well. But if this isn&#039;t self-evident to you, that&#039;s okay. Just because something isn&#039;t intuitive doesn&#039;t make it wrong.&nbsp; Frappe, socialism is well-understood and its failures are profoundly well-documented.

Pay labor too much, your products will be priced above your competition&#039;s and your whole business will collapse. <br />3. Commit fraud or coercion against your laborers or your customers, in a just society, you&#039;ll face jail time and fines yet again, maybe even garnished wages for the rest of your life.<br /><br />I would contend that the historical record supports the proposition that the worst problems occur when businesses collaborate with corrupt politicians (or evil politicians coerce businesses). When businesses are able to bribe politicians to look the other way as they violate contracts or to confer on them special advantages at the involuntary expense of private citizens, the ensuing wealth creation is immoral and unjust and involved business people and politicians should be punished.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />However, it is just as wrong for laborers to seek the intervention of politicians to coerce employers to give them special protections from competition, to offer benefit guarantees and advantages at the involuntary expense of taxpayers.&nbsp; <br /><br />Your notion that the differences between the amounts of wealth people have in a free society cause unrest is specious, at best, and pernicious, at worst. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=9267.msg110926#msg110926">Quote from: Frappe on February 05, 2008, 11:28:44 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">With regards to the remainder, we have already discussed this.&nbsp; Its my opinion that you are viewing the matter through a very narrow economic spyglass and you are choosing to ignore the long term economics, demographic movement or the social costs (if you weren&#039;t ignoring them, you still might disagree with them.&nbsp; You just wouldn&#039;t find it mystical).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It is my opinion that insofar as you have adopted the view that it is moral for the state to coerce businesses or individuals to behave in the way that you would prefer or coerce wealth transfers from some individuals to others based on constantly changing &quot;social realities,&quot; you and I absolutely do not agree on principle.

A few years later she makes an advertising deal that compensates her $500,000 to promote soap, and is netting $50,000 a month from live performances. She starts selling recordings of her performances and her monthly income skyrockets to $300,000. She starts a chain of restaurants and makes even more money. Say she&#039;s making $10 million a year. $100 million a year. $1 billion a year. $1000 billion a year. When exactly does this every become a problem for anyone? As long as all of the transactions are based on mutual consent between adults, I don&#039;t sense a problem. Do you? <br /><br />If instead of money, she were simply having an ever greater amount of great sex, would you have a problem with that?<br /><br />How much profit is too much profit is a question that assumes if person A is making big bucks, it&#039;s somehow got to be at the involuntary expense of many other people. Well, there surely are examples of this. Castro&#039;s wealth is blood-drenched. But what about the comedian above? She&#039;s laughing all the way to the bank because people value her product. No harm, no foul. Right? <br /><br />It&#039;s okay to agree with this, despite your intuition that there&#039;s something amiss. Just because something is counterintuitive doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s not the case. The evolution of the human mind over the course of about one hundred thousand years living as hunters-gatherers certainly increases the likelihood that some of us will naturally feel averse to wealth inequality. Hunters-gatherers were used to living in what game theorists call a zero-sum gain context. There were only so many berries collected, only so much meat. When George the hunter ate more meat than usual, it almost certainly meant that somebody else was eating less meat than usual. But that all changed with our transition to an economy based on producers-consumers. If you plot the progress that human beings have made in the last millennium against the progress made during the first 99,000 years of human civilization, you&#039;ll find that human beings AT EVERY INCOME LEVEL are benefiting tremendously from startling improvements in health, longevity, technology, and quality of life made possible by the emergence of ever more sophisticated and inclusive markets for more advanced and more accessible goods and services. <br /><br />***<br /><br />Wealth inequality is a boon to human society. Why? <br /><br />Scientific discovery, technological innovation, the development of advanced manufacturing/distribution/transportation techniques... developing all of this progress involves a continuum of highly risky, speculative, costly endeavors.&nbsp; The existence of super wealthy people represents a target market for novel inventions, for prototypes of goods and services that are, at least initially, extremely expensive to produce. The absence of such people would represent (1) the absence of an incentive for people to risk capital on the development of cutting edge breakthroughs and (2) the absence of a market-based PROFIT AND LOSS feedback loop for these highly risky projects. Profit and Loss are the ways in which capitalists learn when to launch/discontinue one project or how to make products more useful and appealing to potential investors/customers/consumers.&nbsp; &nbsp;:mrgreen:<br /><br />(Actually, all of us make profit/loss decisions every day. You put less energy/time/wealth into relationships, professional endeavors, career choices, romantic involvements&nbsp; (etc.) with lower rates of return than alternatives. You put more energy/time/wealth into relationships with higher rates of return, so on and so forth. There is no way to operate outside of a profit and loss context. We are always using finite resources in finite contexts with results that can be measured against better or worse possible outcomes. Generally, we try to make the most of what we&#039;ve got, or, in other words, to use what we have as profitably as possible.) <br /><br />Automobile, electric power, medical (therapeutic and diagnostic), home theater, and computer technologies are all examples of innovations that were first enjoyed only by a precious few wealthy people. Plasma tvs that now cost under $1000 once cost a minimum of $70,000. Cell phones used to be huge and cost tens of thousands of dollars, now they&#039;re tiny and included with sub $30/month subscription plans. It must be noted that although wealth made it possible for a first wave of entrepreneurs to offer products based on these technologies, terrific levels of wealth only accrued to the subset of these entrepreneurs who were able to produce and sell products/services profitably to the masses, not merely to niche markets.&nbsp; <img src="http://www.astorians.com/community/Smileys/SoLoSMiLeYS1/wink.gif" alt="&#58;wink&#58;" title="wink" class="smiley" />&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />Think about that for a moment. <br /><br />It is a comforting thought to imagine a world filled with people who are trying to develop products and services that you and I would benefit from using at a price you and I can afford. If those people become phenomenally wealthy, it means that a huge number of people valued their products MORE than what they paid for them. We all benefit from entrepreneurs&#039; risk-taking, intelligence, insights, and competence, and they benefit from our choice to use their product instead of their competitors&#039;. Raise your hand if you have a complaint about this. No hands? Great!&nbsp; :D<br /><br />I will offer only this qualification: From each according to his/her freely made decision to pay a price, to each according to his/her ability to create/offer things that people value is the moral formulation of wealth creation. Tragically, there are people in this world who have captured wealth by force, by actually stealing it physically or through systematic expropriation, or through profane alliances of corporations with governments (fascism).&nbsp; There are also people who attempt to bribe politicians to pass laws that create artificial advantages for some at the expense of others. That&#039;s horrible, too. All of this coercive b.s. is obviously horrific and not at all what I&#039;m describing when I celebrate wealth inequality. :x<br /><br />The best part of wealth inequality, by far, is that it speeds up the discovery and deployment of life-extending and life-enhancing goods and services. :mrgreen:</div>

While this recent book &quot;Who Really Cares,&quot; focuses on religious and nonreligious, it also finds an interesting distinction. To quote from a report 20/20 did (<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=2682730" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=2682730</a>):<br /><br />Arthur Brooks, the author of &quot;Who Really Cares,&quot; says that &quot;when you look at the data, it turns out the conservatives give about 30 percent more.&quot; He adds, &quot;And incidentally, conservative-headed families make slightly less money.&quot; And he says the differences in giving goes beyond money, pointing out that conservatives are 18 percent more likely to donate blood. He says this difference is not about politics, but about the different way conservatives and liberals view government. <br /><br />&quot;You find that people who believe it&#039;s the government&#039;s job to make incomes more equal, <span class="bbc_u">are far less likely to give</span> their money away,&quot; Brooks says. In fact, people who <span class="bbc_u">disagree</span> with the statement, &quot;The government has a basic responsibility to take care of the people who can&#039;t take care of themselves,&quot; are <span class="bbc_u">27 percent more likely</span> to give to charity.<br /></div>

Wealth inequality itself isn&#039;t problematic. It&#039;s not a cause, it&#039;s a consequence. A consequence of what? Human action of one sort or another. <br /><br />Wealth inequality that results from voluntary, peaceful human action, principally trade based on mutual consent, is a great thing. There is no moral justification for a violent response to this kind of wealth creation. There is no moral justification for legally or otherwise outflanking the consent of a property owner in an attempt to acquire his or her wealth. <br /><br />On the other hand, wealth inequality that results from stealing, or from a government&#039;s coercive expropriation, or from legal systems that make it impossible for people to benefit from trading (slavery), or from no-bid contracts awarded based on political pull... basically, any wealth transfer that involves the use or threat of coercion or fraudulent acts... is morally unjustifiable. <br /><br />The French didn&#039;t rebel against Louis XIV because of his wealth. They rebelled because his wealth WAS THEIRS. He didn&#039;t earn it. He took it from them, by force, arbitrarily. France was basically lawless. Local politicians didn&#039;t protect people&#039;s property rights, they abused them! That was the problem. If Louis the XIV had gained his wealth by selling people recordings of his stand-up routine, they wouldn&#039;t have stormed the castle.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, when Apple creates the iPod, it&#039;s a win-win deal for Apple and everybody who buys one.<br />But when Bill Clinton facilitates business deals that enrich brutal dictators and himself on the backs of oppressed people, there are reasons to object. Not because of the wealth inequality itself but because what is happening is not mutually beneficial trade but rather an involuntary wealth transfer. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/31/us/politics/31donor.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/31/us/politics/31donor.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin</a><br />Same goes for Bush&#039;s no-bid contracts to Blackstone to reconstruct Iraq/cater the troop bases, etc. <br /><br />I hope my position is now clear.<br /><br />Love always,<br />Adam<br /></div>

What exactly would you like me to clarify? <br /><br />For the record, I simply never said that New Liberalism was an invention of Clinton or Roosevelt. I don&#039;t think anything I said even suggests that.<br /><br />Yes, the ideas underlying the Progressive Era in the U.S (typically considered to be from about 1890 through the 1920s, though many agree that Roosevelt&#039;s New Deal represented a climactic expression of Progressive Era thinking) took shape during the Enlightenment Period, which itself was ignited by a re-discovery of the ideas of Aristotle and Plato and other philosophers of antiquity. Certainly Rousseau would be considered an intellectual forefather of the progressive era. His views on the important of state-controlled education certainly influenced Dewey. And his notions of freeing individuals from their own self-interests by teaching them from an early age to adopt as their own the general will of society certainly were part of the intellectual assault on liberalism that characterized the Progressive Era. <br /><br />The Enlightenment&#039;s extreme reaction against mysticism would also lead, ironically, to an exaggerated sense of the power of human reason. That was great insofar as it inspired many to seek ever deeper and more sophisticated understandings of human nature and the natural world, and also tragically misguided insofar as it would inspire some to believe that societies might be improved by expert thinkers from above. <br /><br />New Liberalism is ridiculous to me because the &quot;new&quot; stuff is all about undermining the &quot;liberal&quot; stuff. What exactly is so new about that? Most of the history of humanity is about some human beings holding power over others for no other reason than their own enrichment. Frankly, the warlords who sacked and pillaged never told the people they were plundering that it was for their own good. That was a socialist innovation.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I know that many of the Progressive Era proponents of &quot;positive rights&quot; did not believe that their proposals posed problems to individual liberty. But they were wrong. Liberty rights are logically incompatible with rights that impose obligations on some at the involuntary expense of others. Once that contradiction is overlooked and laws begin to encroach on liberty, the results are ultimately dismal. <br /><br />I know that intellectuals inspired by scientific breakthroughs were probably quite well-intentioned when they recommended putting experts in charge of the economy. But they were wrong, too. They mistakenly believed that their successful mastering of the mechanism of nature would translate into improving human society. Hence, during the Progressive Era, there&#039;s a great deal of jabber about &quot;fine-tuning&quot; human values, about individuals as &quot;instruments&quot; through which society improves, et cetera. Some people objected that human beings were not &quot;means to ends&quot;, but the whole &quot;individuals as ends in themselves&quot; crowd was written off as regurgitating &quot;old-school&quot; thinking. Classical liberalism was on its way out.<br /><br />So socialist ideas were increasingly in vogue at the beginning of the 20th century. I will grant that many (possibly most) advocates of positive rights and central planning back then were well-intentioned. If they could have known what the consequences of their ideas would end up being, I bet they would not have pursued their agenda of diminishing individual liberty and increasing the role of government in the economy.<br /><br />But a great deal has happened since then. <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/</a>&nbsp; We simply no longer have any excuse to trust government to serve our interests better than we can. There&#039;s no longer a reasonable basis for believing that idea.<br /><br />We&#039;ve learned from experience that central planning fails, that its unintended consequences are profoundly harmful and even lethal. Intellectuals have developed theories that accurately describe the problems with central planning. Public choice theorists, Austrian economists, experimental economists (see Vernon Smith). There is an overwhelming data set bolstering the case for more individual freedom and less government interference. <br /><br />The tragedy of the commons (how the absence of prices leads to shortages, abuse, and violence). The knowledge problem (the impossibility of central planners accounting for human individuality and contextual dynamics in a complex society). Unintended Consequences (there are costs and opportunity costs and unexpected costs with government interventions). Greed in the Public Sector (the keen observation that government employees are human beings just like the rest of us, but that the incentive structures at work within public institutions cause inefficiency and vice). Spontaneous Order (like Evolution, how social complexity arises from simplicity over time, not by design but as a result of human action).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />So, to all Democrats and Republicans excited about intelligently designing human society, I say this:<br /><br />GIVEN what we&#039;ve learned about what happens when the most well-intentioned government interferes coercively with the freedom of individuals to make choices, respond to incentives, adapt to their conditions, trade with one another, relocate themselves and pursue their own goals; <br /><br />IF you care about poverty, if you care about starvation, if you care about the quality of education and health care, if you care about longevity and quality of life, if you care about discovery and innovation, if you care about prosperity; <br /><br />THEN you have to become a bleeding heart advocate for human liberty and against state power. <br /><br />You think there is something &quot;extremely debatable&quot; about this position? Bring it on. :mrgreen:<br /><br />Love always,<br />Adam&nbsp; :-)</div>
