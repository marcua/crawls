				Hey everyone,<br /><br />I was digging around in some trash that people left behind my apartment (I hate trash dumpers) and I found a metal vase/lamp thing.<br /><br />It was all dirty from being in the trash and so I got an old rag and started to wipe it off; Indeed it was beautiful.<br /><br />Suddenly a I found myself in a whirlwind and lo and behold a figure, what seemed to be a human being, appeared beside me. The &quot;genie&quot; told me that I would be granted three wishes.<br /><br />Of course I asked for a raincheck so that I'd be able to pose the question to the group and get some help on what I should ask for. Genie said that was fine.<br /><br />So now I pose this question to you. What three things would you wish for? I am hoping this will help me to decide what I should do.<br /><br />Thank you for your help as I am finding it most difficult to decide.

				My <em>real</em> most important three wishes are too personal and painful to post here. &nbsp;Anyway, how do I know there wouldn't be some catch, a la The Monkey's Paw?<br /><br />Here are 3 wishes I'm willing to post:<br /><br />A bathtub long enough to take a bath in.<br /><br />A kitchen big enough for a slow cooker.<br /><br />Housekeeping skills good enough to get rid of the clutter for good.

				Wow. Most of these wishes could be granted by Bill Gates. I think we need to try a little harder here guys I don't want to waste these wishes.<br /><br />I'm thinking that for starters I'd like to wish for a society that isn't based on money. Maybe I'd wish for all money (currency) to be banished.<br /><br />The reason I say this is because I think money allows us to place an external arbitrary value on human beings, and it's not *really* necessary for trade anyway I'd love a society in which everyone could do the job they wanted and not have to worry about the fact that it doesn't pay much.<br /><br />I'd let the genie figure all the problems that transitioning to such a society would produce.

				Geez, I know it's cliche' and kind of obvious but I would wish for:<br /><br />1) A wish that any wish that I make in the future (or otherwise) will not prevent me from making any more wishes that come from a sound body and mind, without any negative repurcussions (unless I wish it).<br />2) A wish that would grant me an infinite amount of wishes.<br />3) (Although superfluous at this point) A wish that would call forth a gigantic marble monument dedicated to Franz Kafka spontaneously sprouting from Rumsfelts's buttocks. :-)<br /><br />-zero content

				OK, I'll ramp up my wishes and dream bigger, since merm asks it - but i'm going to be totally selfish about it:<br /><br />1) One year's pay so I can take a year off to live in Amsterdam and scout around Europe<br />2) After paying off my debts and getting a nice head start on a Roth IRA account, of course, for which I would need another sum which I am unwilling to specify here<br />3) &nbsp;100 lightweight paperbacks for subway reading

				I'll have to do this in installments. Am pondering this, so I only have one so far.<br /><br />Wish #1: I wish that every single person alive could be someone else for a day. Kind of like Freaky Friday, except it would be global, and it would teach everyone to take a different perspective on themselves and others, with the outcome of people hopefully having a little more understanding.<br /><br />Wishes 2 and 3 to come later.

				i dunno. &nbsp;what about the people who have to be jeffrey dahmer for a day, or someone with really ultra serious baggage (say, a history of abuse) and all the subsequent suicides the next day?<br /><br />i don't think many people are capable of taking on someone else's emotional/psychological/physical crap without suffering some fairly serious negative effects. &nbsp;not to mention the invasion of privacy involved. <br /><br />would make a really good novel, though..... &nbsp;about a random man in iowa who has to track down and kill a random woman in new york because she got to see his memories and knows exactly what he did last summer.<br /><br />wow, i think you've given me my nanowrimo plot!

				That's just the thing. Nobody knows what it is like to be Jeffrey Dahmer or Osama Bin Laden. There are just some people we don't want to be, but if we understood them more, I think that we might understand better how to relate to them or to people like them. You wouldn't necessarily take on their persona, but everyone would think &quot;You are Osama bin Laden. You are a terrorist&quot; or &quot;You're Jeffrey Dahmer. You are an incredibly sick individual.&quot; Or better yet, &quot;You're Britney Spears and you have a seriously twisted life and don't deserve to be rich.&quot; Or &quot;I wish I was you, Britney Spears. You're rich.&quot; And the list goes on... (Isn't Jeffrey Dahmer dead, though? Dead people would be excluded. It would probably suck to be dead for a day - not that I know what that is like, though.)<br /><br />I don't think that if you switched bodies with someone it would necessarily mean that you would have their previous memories. If you have seen the old Freaky Friday (and I am sure the new one is similar) the people who trade bodies are still their original selves, just within someone else's body. It would be a chance for a white person to experience racism (which sucks by the way - I experienced that mildly in Europe a few years back) or to experience poverty, etc., etc.<br /><br />I think merm's intent in starting this post was to get people to figure out how to change the real issues or to think of things we can't already accomplish. Sure it is one thing to wish that you had money or a dishwasher or got to sleep in later, but these are all things that people can already change themselves. I also believe my wish isn't perfect or even entirely positive, but every wish always has repurcussions. Even the good ones. I would hope that the positive would weigh out the negative in this wish, though. It most certainly would change the world for a day.

				At least it can't be granted by Bill Gates!

				I haven't seen freaky friday, so I guess I read you the wrong way. &nbsp;Sorry :-)<br /><br />It would be interesting to live for one day in another color or as another gender. &nbsp;And the world would definitely be a better place if we all learned to be more thoughtful and considerate and ... imaginatively empathetic. &nbsp;I think literature and drama accomplish this to to some extent.<br /><br />It's funny, because in some ways we've already lived in more than one pair of shoes. &nbsp;I mean, I've lived in a rural area, a small city and a big city; as a child and an adult; as a conservative christian and an atheist. &nbsp;I've been wronged and I've wronged others. &nbsp;I've been healthy and I've been sick. &nbsp;I've done things out of love, spite, anger, hope, courage, cowardice, greed and generousity. &nbsp; And if I'm honest with myself about who I am and what i'm doing and why, I can learn something from myself that will impact my future behavior and my treatment of others.<br /><br />A few years ago I read a magazine article in which a man and a woman (a couple) traded genders for a week. &nbsp;With some clever makeup and costuming, each passed as the opposite gender. &nbsp; They both had a sort of revelation from their experience - I wish I could remember the source, you would like it...

				I'm enjoying reading the comments here.<br /><br />I have a couple thoughts: <br /><br />If someone is taking care of themselves so that other people don't have to take care of them that's not selfish. Selfish is taking care of yourself at the cost of others being able to take care of themselves.<br /><br />Also, I wish that more people would subscribe to a kind of &quot;think local&quot; approach to change the world. However, thinking &quot;global&quot; and thinking &quot;local&quot; aren't mutually exclusive. You could argue actually that they are one in the same. A person who truely thinks global cannot exclude the local, and a person who thinks local must also consider the wider community (since no community is an island unto itself.)<br /><br />It's a perversion of these views that ends up in a kind of twisted &quot;think local/global&quot; approach. Like when one starts thinking local in the sense that they are better than anyone else and who cares what happens to the rest of the world. Or when someone is only focused on feeding the starving African children, while they abuse and starve their own children.<br /><br />As to my comments about the things that can be solved by Bill Gates. I suppose that what I was getting at was that I'd like to use my three wishes for something that cannot be solved simply with the use of more money. I see money as more of a part of the problem (to poverty, war, inequality, etc) than part of the solution. So I was wanting to make the genie's job a hard one.

				and here i thought you meant technology problems that bill gates could fix for us all!!!<br /><br />it's funny what you say about thinking globally/locally. &nbsp;i was thinking about this after i read this thread before. &nbsp;the impact that one makes on a community in astoria nyc doesn't just stay there. &nbsp;you don't know who ten years from now might be living thousands of miles away but be inspired by something they experienced here - or read about on a blog. &nbsp;the world isn't really contained to localities anymore. &nbsp;<br /><br />i do think that taking care of myself first and not sacrificing my primary needs for anyone else makes me better equipped to make an impact. &nbsp;goldfish boy and you both make good points.
