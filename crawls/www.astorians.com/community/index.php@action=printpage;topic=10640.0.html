				I have 3 new large posters comming in from Europe: size: 46.8 x 33.1 inch<br /><br />I got an estimate from a poster frame place here in the city and they wanted $250 each&nbsp; - but for a poster that cost $40 each- it doesnt make sence to spend all that <br /><br />Now what other options/solutions do i have ? i want to just have it on the wall, protected and want it to look good<br /><br />-it dosnt have to be glass<br />-i am open to building my own frame but i would need the material<br /><br />I had one of these posters up before just with bulletin pins and my cat ripped them out the wall and them ripped the poster off the wall and destoyed it - so now i want to protect the new ones<br /><br />Here is one of the posters if you would like to see: NYC Pixillated<br />http://hello.eboy.com/eboy/productdetail/?token=NYC&amp;pic=0&amp;cat=poster&amp;<br /><br />Links or any additional advice would be great !!!<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />PJ

				Well you could always go to a hardware store or a place like Home Depot that sells plexiglass, buy a couple of sheets that are approximately the size of the posters. ( nice poster BTW) Then you could either try and make a frame for them or just affix the plexiglass directly to the wall using wall anchors, so then the wall itself would be the frame. But if you do it the second way you&#039;ll need something to attach the posters to the plexi so they don&#039;t just fall down, glue I suppose.

				There is a good framing shop on 30th Avenue at 38th Street, south side of 30th Avenue.&nbsp; Friendly staff, reasonable prices, they might be able to frame them for you.

				Dude, I didn&#039;t see the neg nod, not that it bothers me in the least. I see that occasionally on posts of mine, like water off a duck&#039;s back.<br /><br />It&#039;s like when you&#039;re in your car with your turn signal on waiting to turn left, but you can&#039;t because there are cars coming towards you. Then as you turn, the guy behind you honks his horn loudly, and yells out his window &quot;asshole&quot; really loudly, as if it was really possible for you to actually make that turn in front of 20 cars! It doesn&#039;t bug me in the least. It&#039;s the other guy who needs to get a reality check. But seriously, $250 for a frame!?!?!?!? I mean that&#039;s fracking highway robbery!!

				There&#039;s a place at 29-04 23rd Ave that is going out of business. I&#039;m getting two posters framed there for $180 total! Plus he&#039;s doing it in a few days. I think he&#039;s closing in early June so you should check it out soon.<br /><br /><br />

				Mine were odd sizes too. (Damn you Met Museum of Art and your odd sizes!) Otherwise I would have bought some pre-fabs at Micheals. They were somewhere around 29&quot; x 38&quot;. Something like that. Just big enough to not fit a standard 24&quot; x 36&quot; and to small to fit in the next size up. <br /><br />You can probably talk the guy down a little. When I first went (a month ago) I got him down to $140 but that was still to much at the time. This time he bumped it up to $180 but I didn&#039;t complain because it&#039;s still a good price and the poor bastard is going out of business already. I don&#039;t want to be the nail in a local business&#039;s coffin.

				Yea thanks PJ, I just got into them recently( ATHF I mean). I just passed by that shop today and saw that they&#039;re going out of biz. Sad but it has&nbsp; been happening a lot lately rising rents and such.

				Have you looked at http://www.framesbymail.com/. I&#039;ve used them a few times and they are odd size specialists. You can customize the frame, the Plexiglass and the matting. I&#039;ve been very pleased with both the final product and their prices.
