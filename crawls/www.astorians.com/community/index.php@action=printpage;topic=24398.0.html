				this could turn out to be an age-related question, but i can&#039;t decide, so i thought to take a poll. as a 41-year old woman who is a fan of both, i can see the pros and cons for both franchises being the more relevant.&nbsp; :undecided:

				Franchise vs franchise?<br /><br />Original trilogy vs original series?<br /><br />With the many Star Trek TV series&#039; and the Star Wars prequels, it&#039;s not such a black and white question. <br /><br />

				Also, the poll question is ambiguous.&nbsp; Is the op asking:<br /><ul class="bbc_list" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li>Which one is more popular in the general public (measured with some defined metric)</li><li>Which one do we &quot;think&quot; is more popular or.</li><li>Which one do we personally prefer</li></ul>

				Taking each as a whole (which is kind of unfair since ST has a whole lot more to its canon), I&#039;d definitely say Star Trek .&nbsp; I will always be fond of Ep. IV - VI of Star Wars (forget that prequel crap) because lots of great childhood memories are attached to it and it was my gateway drug to all things sci-fi and fantasy, BUT it lacks the depth of ST (esp. TNG and DS9 ST).&nbsp; &nbsp;That said, I&#039;m super excited to see what JJ Abrams and crew does with the SW franchise.

				Just saw this thread.<br /><br />Fortunately for all we seem to have our answer: Mr Abrams will crap on both equally and they&#039;ll thus turn into the same piles of poo, albeit with slightly different hues and scents.

				Personally Star Wars ships are much better than Star Trek ones. I mean, X wings; TIE fighters; Star Destroyers; Death Stars? In terms of design, power and canon, the spacecraft in Star Trek really don&#039;t match up compared to them.
