				Title: <strong>Power Point Class?</strong><br />

				Can anyone recommend a place to take a Power Point class? I need to take a class- did a search on google and came up with a bunch of places- but was hoping to get a recommendation from someone rather than just blindly sign up for a class at a place that I have never heard of. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks!

				PowerPoint for Dummies is so much cheaper.&nbsp; It is a very simple program (I use it all the time).

				Thanks for the suggestions Sweeper. That is definitely an option- though I might need a more of an intensive hands on kind of approach. Unfortunately I am not the most disciplined when in comes to reading manuals and instructional books.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Urrisgirl,<br /><br />Start with the Microsoft training on their website:<br />http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/training/CR061832731033.aspx<br />I think you&#039;ll see that it&#039;s a pretty easy program once you get started.

It would be helpful for the job I have now and for any jobs I take in the future. I have to admit I am a little overwhelmed- though everyone keep telling me its an easy program to learn.

				I haven&#039;t used any of the newer versions of it, but if you just want to learn the basics, it&#039;s very simple. Just set an hour or so aside for yourself and start messing around in it. I taught myself how to use it a few years ago while waiting in the airport for a delayed flight, and by the time I had to pack up and board I felt I knew the program well enough, and I&#039;d made a presentation for personal amusement. I would recommend coming up with something dumb to make a presentation about and then figuring out how to make it. Aside from it being a sort of rewarding educational experience, you might start laughing hysterically. You will want to involve clip-art and text effects in some way.

				Robert Grauer&#039;s <em>Exploring Microsoft Office 2003</em> series is a really good classroom-type series to help learn any of the office products.&nbsp; It comes with a CD that has files you can practice with step-by-step and plenty of on-your-own exercises, too.&nbsp; I use it with my seventh graders.&nbsp; It helps people develop basic skills and proficiency.&nbsp; If you are okay with used books, the cost is only $8.00 and the files are also downloadable from the internet.<br /><br />Here is the link for the PowerPoint book on Amazon.com:&nbsp; http://tinyurl.com/yrah86<br /><br />ISBN: 0131434845
