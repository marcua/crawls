			My son has played both over the last 10 years. The guy at ICYP (Bob) does a great job but the level of competition is not that high, on the oher hand while the level of play is higher at Elmjack there has been some dissent amongst some parents with the conditions of the fields as well as the current board of directors (They were in court, not sure of the outcome) ICYP uses only wood bats, while Elmjack (which is little league affiliated) uses metal bats. Elmjack does have in addition to it&#039;s spring season a &quot;snowflake league&quot; which runs from Labor Day until the 1st week of November. Both have their pros and cons, it all depends on what your looking for. One other thing ICYP also offers girls softball in the spring as well as touch football in the fall while Elmjack is strictly boys baseball, although there have been a few girls playing there over the years
