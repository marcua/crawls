				Are you interested in working with the senior population in Queens? Then here is your chance to apply to a program that connects selected artists with senior citizens and places them in-residency at Senior Centers in Queens.<br />&nbsp;<br />Application Available: Wed, September 3rd<br />Application Deadline: September 30th<br />SPARC Info Session at QCA: September 16th<br />RSVP Here (https://dnbweb1.blackbaud.com/OPXREPHIL/EventDetail.asp?cguid=C4C9C365%2DD305%2D4621%2DA036%2DBD7AA34429E7&amp;eid=50018)<br />&nbsp;<br />ABOUT THE PROGRAM<br />&nbsp;<br />SPARC (Seniors Partnering with Artists Citywide) is a community arts engagement program that places artists-in-residence at senior centers across the five boroughs of New York City. The program provides selected artists with a stipend in exchange for the creation and delivery of arts programming for seniors. Selected artists will engage participating seniors in an art project or series of cultural programs over the course of the residency, which will also include a public program component – exhibits, readings, performances, open houses or other cultural interactions open to the surrounding community.<br />&nbsp;<br />This initiative seeks to connect artists with seniors in senior centers and aims to positively impact the well-being of older adults through arts-based activities.&nbsp; SPARC seeks to place artists who are sensitive to the needs of older adults and who are interested in engaging their communities.&nbsp; Each senior center is unique and offers access to different types of spaces, resources and communities.&nbsp; Selected artists will work with the senior center where they are placed to further refine project goals and coordinate a schedule for residency activities and use of facilities.<br />&nbsp;<br />HOW SPARC WORKS<br />&nbsp;<br />In exchange for the creation and delivery of arts programming at a senior center during the residency period, SPARC artists-in-residence will receive a stipend in the amount of $1,750, an additional $500 materials/supplies budget and access to materials/supplies of their choosing from Materials for the Arts. Individual artists can apply directly to participate in the program without a fiscal sponsor.&nbsp; SPARC expects to fund 50 artist residencies at senior centers across the five boroughs of New York City.<br />&nbsp;<br />All components of the application must be received by QCA no later than 5PM on Tuesday, September 30th.&nbsp; Applicants will be notified of their application status and, if applicable, which senior center they will work with, by the end of December 2014.&nbsp; Residencies will take place between January 1, 2015 and June 30, 2015. <br />&nbsp;<br />SPARC Info Session<br />September 16, 2014, 6:00-8:00 PM<br />Queens Council on the Arts<br />&nbsp;37-11 35th Ave, Entrance on 37th Street<br />&nbsp;Astoria NY 11101<br />Please RSVP here &nbsp;(https://dnbweb1.blackbaud.com/OPXREPHIL/EventDetail.asp?cguid=C4C9C365%2DD305%2D4621%2DA036%2DBD7AA34429E7&amp;eid=50018)<br />&nbsp;<br />Starting Wednesday, September 3rd – for more information on how SPARC works and to view and submit the complete application, please visit qca.submittable.com (https://qca.submittable.com/)<br />&nbsp;<br />If you have any questions please contact Daniel Arnow at danielarnow.qca@gmail.com.
