				Hey all,<br /><br />Ephraim and Thom here. We introduced ourselves yesterday and thought we should ask if anyone else works out at the new Evolution Gym on 35th ave and 37th street?&nbsp; It&#039;s new and we&#039;re enjoying it.&nbsp; The equipment is nice and there&#039;s plenty of cardio machines.&nbsp; &nbsp;Want to get other Out peoples opinions about the gym.&nbsp; We feel comfortable there.&nbsp; Any thoughts?&nbsp; Anyone else a member?<br /><br /><br />-E and T

				I&#039;ve never been there guys so I can&#039;t offer an opinion. I work out at NYSC at 30th Ave and Steinway. It&#039;s well equipped and not crowded mid afternoon when I go. It is not a very friendly place but I don&#039;t go there to socialize so I&#039;m not bothered.

				Yeah, we heard the NYSC was nice, our old roommate goes there as well.&nbsp; Evolution is still new and could use some more people there and is never really crowded. We also work out early like 5 and 6 am.&nbsp; It&#039;s open 24 hours, which is convenient for our crazy schedules.&nbsp; While we just go in to do our work outs and get out of there, it makes us feel comfortable that the owner and staff are great and clearly comfortable with us being an openly gay couple.&nbsp; <br /><br />We&#039;ve found this whole part of the neighborhood by Kaufman Astoria Studios very warm and welcoming by our neighbors.&nbsp; It&#039;s really getting nice down here with more places to eat and the Starbucks. Nest to open up is a Panera Bread.

				Hello- my partner and I just joined Evolution- and work out at all different times and have no problems there either-- We like it a lot and Anthony, one of the owners, is very nice.&nbsp; We were at another gym for 3 years in Astoria, and are very happy to have found evolution.&nbsp; I was tickled to find your post- We joined 3 weeks ago and I just found your post today, although I had been thinking the same positive thoughts about Evolution.<br /><br />

				When we joined a few weeks ago he was running a special-- i think it was 550 a year-- normally 700...<br /><br /><br />i think he runs a special every weekend tho so i bet you could talk them into giving you the lower price.
