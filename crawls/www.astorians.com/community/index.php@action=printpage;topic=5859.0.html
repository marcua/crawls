				I think it is the best sushi in Astoria, that&#039;s where I order from.&nbsp; If you go, try Tropical Roll 1 and the Tuna Sashimi and Apple Chips in Wasabi oil...delish.<br /><br /><br />The pop stickers thing...was that in New York Magazine?

				They have some really creative appetizers along the lines of tuna tartare and I want to say wasabi shumai if I&#039;m remembering that correctly.&nbsp; Some of them can only be eaten in-house, though.&nbsp; I second the vote for JJ&#039;s as having best sushi in Astoria.&nbsp;

				31st Ave between 37th and 38th just west of the supermarket. <br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;ve never had the pot stickers there.... yet.... but it&#039;s probably our favorite local restaurant already.&nbsp; We usually get sushi and the house lo mein, and occasionally will mix in something new. <br /><br />

				JJ&#039;s gets my vote too.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had a bad meal there.&nbsp; (And I&#039;ve found that if you ask real nice-like, they&#039;ll deliver the things they say are in-house only.)&nbsp;

				I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; I don&#039;t eat sushi on Mondays so I&#039;ve never been to JJ&#039;s on a Monday.&nbsp; Interesting.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s worth going again tomorrow night!&nbsp; Promise.

				I put in an order for pick-up with JJ&#039;s over the weekend and noticed on their menu that it said they&#039;re closed Mondays.&nbsp; Also saw the big banner out front declaring &quot;Best Potstickers 2007 - New York Magazine.&quot;&nbsp; Guess they&#039;re pretty excited about it!&nbsp; Had a chat with someone there who said they didn&#039;t even know for a while until someone casually mentioned it and then they rushed out to buy a copy of the magazine to make sure.&nbsp; I told them some rather complimentary things were said about them on Astorians.com too.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)<br /><br />Thanks for the tip about sometimes being able to order the special appetizers for delivery!&nbsp; That night I went with the potstickers (still yummy!) but good to know...

				Well I wasn&#039;t necessarily impressed by the potstickers, but the sushi was great - a step or two up from Go Wasabi for sure! Best sushi I&#039;ve had in Astoria so far!

				I will agree with pretty much everyone else here and say that JJ&#039;s is the best sushi in Astoria.&nbsp; The first time I went there, I fell in love with the sweet potato tempura roll. I haven&#039;t been in a while, so I think it&#039;s high time for a visit.

				It&#039;s got to be Tropical Roll I for me.&nbsp; I might have already said that.&nbsp; It&#039;s because I feel so strongly about it.

				My one gripe with JJ&#039;s is their refusal to serve regular soy sauce (they only have the low sodium stuff, blegh!), but everything else is great.
