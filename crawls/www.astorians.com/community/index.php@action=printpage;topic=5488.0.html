				Related thread:&nbsp; http://www.astorians.com/index.php?topic=2758.51<br /><br />From Planned Parenthood:<br /><br />Emergency contraception (Plan B) is now available without a prescription for people 18 and older, but we&#039;re still hearing reports of pharmacists refusing to provide it to their customers. This is outrageous. We need your help to ensure that every woman in every community can access emergency contraception (EC). We&#039;re asking people across the country to go to or to call their local pharmacies and to find out if EC is available. But we need your help —&nbsp; join the Planned Parenthood Pill Patrol now (http://pillpatrol.saveroe.com/main)!<br /><br />We are already getting reports back from the field.<br /><br />There&#039;s good news at a Target in Arizona:<br />&quot;I called my pharmacy and Darcy was very helpful, obtained the price, let me know that I would need to pick it up at the pharmacy counter and provide my driver&#039;s license as proof of age. She said they had it in stock and were open until 9:00. Good customer service.&quot;<br /><br />But not so great news at Walmart in Missouri:<br />Jack told us that at his Walmart, &quot;If anyone in the Rx department wouldn&#039;t provide EC for religious reasons, they wouldn&#039;t provide it to the general public.&quot;<br /><br />We need to know what&#039;s happening in your state. It&#039;s easy to sign up and easy to report back. Visit our website (http://pillpatrol.saveroe.com/main) to find out how and then repost this bulletin so that your friends can join too.<br /><br />P.S. We specifically picked Target, Walmart, Osco, and Costco because these pharmacies either have a thumbs-down policy on EC or have not responded to our requests to clarify their policies.<br />

				City View Pharmacy on Astoria Blvd, who are a super-friendly new pharmacy (about a year old) definitely do provide it - they have signs up announcing that its available. Support a non-chain pharmacy!

				ohhh, i just read this.<br /><br />i am a social worker for a women&#039;s health clinic. our agency has clinics in 4 boroughs (none in staten island yet) but all of our clinics provide EOC, contraception, free condoms, full gyn check ups and prenatal care.&nbsp; there is one here in astoria that provides all of the above services.&nbsp; <br /><br />www.mic4care.org<br /><br />so if any of you ladies do not wish to go to a pharmacy, there is a clinic right here in astoria that will gladly help you out.&nbsp; <br /><br />but yes, all pharmacies are supposed to carry this.&nbsp; <br /><br />btw-- this form of contraception is pretty much a really strong dosage of the common birth control pill. it pretty much thickens the lining of the uterus preventing a fertilized egg from sticking/implanting, therefore making the woman, technically pregnant. not all fertilized eggs are able to implant. i hope more and more people become educated about this as an effective form of emergency contraception even when you are using contraception (such as the condom broke, or missed a few bc pills).<br /><br />if anyone wishes to discuss this further, feel free to post, or pm me. i&#039;d love to talk more about this and our clinics. <br /><br />good luck to everyone, and yes, please pass this message along to all who are interested.

They also provide sources to their information, something the ALL does not do.&nbsp; Click on the link to read the whole article.&nbsp; All of it is really interesting and I had to resist copying it all here for you to read.<br /><br />&nbsp;The Difference Between Emergency Contraception And Medication Abortion<br /><br />There is considerable public confusion about the difference between emergency contraception and medication abortion because of misinformation disseminated by anti-choice groups. Emergency contraception helps prevent pregnancy; medication abortion terminates pregnancy. According to general medical definitions of pregnancy that have been endorsed by many organizations including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the United States Department of Health and Human Services, pregnancy begins when a pre-embryo completes implantation into the lining of the uterus (ACOG, 1998; DHHS, 1978; Hughes, 1972; &quot;Make the Distinction...,&quot; 2001). Hormonal methods of contraception, including emergency contraception, prevent pregnancy by inhibiting ovulation and fertilization (ACOG, 1998). Medication abortion terminates a pregnancy without surgery. By helping women to prevent unplanned pregnancies after unprotected intercourse, emergency contraception has the great potential to decrease the rate of abortion. By helping women terminate unwanted pregnancies up to 56 days after their last menstruation, medication abortion is a safe and effective option.<br /><br />What is EC?<br />EC contains hormones that reduce the risk of pregnancy if started within 120 hours of unprotected intercourse. The treatment is more effective the sooner it begins. Plan B® is currently the only product marketed specifically as emergency contraception. Certain oral contraceptives taken in increased doses may also be used as EC (&quot;FDA Approves...,&quot; 1999; Rodrigues et al., 2001; Van Look &amp; Stewart, 1998).

				On the topic - as the morning after pill is essentially just a super-dose of the normal pill, it is possible to administer it yourself if you happen to have the pill. Just take it morning and night (instead of once in the morning) or take two instead of one (if you&#039;re normally on the pill, taking just one would be fine if you&#039;re not). As long as you can keep it down (the real MAP comes with anti-nausea meds as well) and trigger your body to have a period, then you&#039;ve successfully dosed yourself. Warning: this and the MAP will give you the worst PMS ever... <br /><br />

				Thanks for the new link!&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />My guess would be that you&#039;d have to take a bunch of regular pills to equate the dose of one MAP.

				When I was in college, the on-campus clinic dispensed regular birth control pills as the morning after pill -- this was 20 years ago, long before any official &quot;morning after pill&quot;.&nbsp; The instructions were to take two regular pills in two separate doses 12 hours apart.&nbsp; You had to take the first dose within 72 hours.<br /><br />And Melee is right -- City View Pharmacy is at 23-07 Astoria Blvd., Astoria, NY 11102.
