			My husband and I are seeking a nanny share in Astoria. We have a wonderful nanny who is CPR certified, First Aid trained and has experience with multiples. We are seeking a share for late August or early September with another couple who has a baby 2-6 months old. Our daughter will be about 3 months old. We need coverage from about 8:30 to 5:30 on weekdays, but could extend those hours to accommodate your schedule. We live on the second floor of a townhouse near the 30th Ave. subway stop in Astoria. It&#039;s one block from a large playground. We have a washer/dryer in our apartment and two large rooms for the children to play. My husband works from a home office, so he&#039;ll be available in case of an emergency. We have a small 13-pound dog (Pekingese). Please email us at astorianannyshare@gmail.com if you&#039;re interested. Thanks!
