				I&#39;m moving from 34th and 34th to 30th ave and 33rd St. I was hoping to be closer to Freeze Peach because it seems as though its where all the action is. I love little coffee shops and, living in Astoria for 5 years, I&#39;ve noticed that they are few and far between (especially with Starbucks popping up everywhere). <br /><br />Are there any funky kinda coffee shops near where I&#39;ll be moving to (minus the obvious abundance of Greek cafe&#39;s on 30th ave). Wi-Fi would be amazing.<br /><br />Thanks everyone! :)<br /><br />-Joe

				There&#39;s nothing quite as quintessential-coffeehouse as Freezepeach closer to Grand 30th, but Wassi (28th ave. and 37th st.) is chill and enjoyable (despite very friendly but not very efficient service), and I think they do have wi-fi.

				You might also try the Himalayan Teahouse, on 31st Ave and 34th St.<br /><br />And there&#39;s a falafel place on 30th Ave, just before Crescent, that&#39;s very friendly and serves up a wonderful cup of what they call Jerusalem tea.

				yeah I&#39;ve been to Himalayan, it was really good but more on the expensive side and more restaurant-style than coffee shop. Amazing Iced Matcha tho!<br /><br />I&#39;ll check out the falafel place as I love falafel anyway :)<br /><br />Cup by my old apt&nbsp; used to be pretty good until it got bought out by crappy Lite Bites. And I&#39;ll always miss being across the street from Cafe Bar :-\
