				Anyone try the deep fried oreos?&nbsp; I had some Latin food for lunch (from a vendor around 29th St.) and it was pretty good.

				I saw that and didn&#039;t try it. One thing, was it weird that there was sushi outside? how can that keep in the hot sun? <br />Also, I felt like I kept seeing the same vendors over and over again. I ended up having a Thai spring roll.

				I usually don&#039;t buy at these things, but had a hunger craze while passing sausage and pepper stand between&nbsp; 32 street &amp;33rd street.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I saw actual peppers, which is nice, since they usually give all onions.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was surprised at price ( $9)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was o.k.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The fair itself is more of&nbsp; a flea market, not a fair. It was a little better this year.&nbsp; &nbsp;I miss the bands and tables that used to be in front of Broadway Station Bar. This year they did not have anything.

				Yes, this particular street market was better than usual, maybe because the weather was so glorious.&nbsp; My friends are telling me deep fried oreos are delish, so next time I&#039;m buying some&nbsp; :lol:
