				Well this is a topic we all love, isn&#39;t it? I grew up next to a farm, and now I&#39;m living in New York City. I&#39;m seeing bugs I&#39;ve never seen before. Last year we had a few house centipedes&nbsp; :-o, and so far this year I&#39;ve seen a few bugs I can&#39;t identify. I mean they&#39;re all the same kind of bug, but I have no idea what they are. I thought maybe they&#39;re young house centipedes, but I can&#39;t find pictures of those. They&#39;re maybe half an inch long with a body that&#39;s maybe 1/5&quot; wide, have a bunch of very short legs, and they squish easily. They also like appearing on my bed and walking on my wall, and I think they&#39;re afraid of light.<br /><br />They&#39;re not particularly frightening and they apparently are not there to bite me, but I am not a big fan of anything on my bed aside from people and cats, so I do not appreciate their presence. Anyone have any ideas what these bugs are?

				Sounds like what you&#39;re describing is a silverfish. Funny, I just saw one of these on the wall over my desk the other day. I notice I start to see them when it&#39;s been damp out (and uh, well, we&#39;re pretty much well waterlogged after this past week ...).<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">http://www.ext.vt.edu/departments/entomology/factsheets/silverfi.html</span><br /><br />Not a fan of these guys myself, but much prefer to see one of them than a roach ...

				Whoa, I think I had one of those things in my apartment not too long ago.&nbsp; It was a good inch and half long with wild antennae, kinda yellowish brown, and had way more legs than was necessary.&nbsp; I looked at the silverfish picture, and it had many more legs than that.&nbsp; What I do know is that it was disgusting and horrible, and I just wanted it dead.&nbsp; If it had been on my bed and not my wall I think I would have lost my mind.&nbsp; We did not have these nasty things in California.&nbsp; Silverfish, yes - loads - but not these alien critters.&nbsp; I truly hate bugs.&nbsp; Except ladybugs&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D

				I get those too. I always called them silverfish, but the ones in my apt do have a lot more legs than the ones in the picture, so maybe they are something else. Before I got my cat I used to get some really big ones, now they don&#39;t survive nearly as long, and it&#39;s fun to watch the cats stalk them- they used to spend hours lurking behing the toilet b/c there was a hole in the wall that the bugs came out of. They were very upset when I plugged it up :)

				Earwigs (http://ohioline.osu.edu/hyg-fact/2000/2068.html) are black bugs that crawl around mostly outside, and have a pincher looking appendage at their butt end.&nbsp; They won&#39;t bite or pinch (at least I&#39;ve never been pinched), but are just grody.&nbsp; Very fast moving, too.<br /><br />I think you are referring to mosquito hawks, those guys with the long legs and snout that fly erratically.&nbsp; Used to get them all the time in CA.&nbsp; Totally harmless.&nbsp; &nbsp;But a little scary looking.<br /><br />I think I had a brown recluse living in the back corner of a cupboard I rarely looked into.&nbsp; Now I realize not eradicating it was probably unwise, as those suckers are more poisonous than black widows (which I saw from time to time in CA).&nbsp; I was never bitten or anything, but still.<br /><br />Yellowjackets still freak me out, as do most stinging insects.&nbsp; I remember sitting in a park with my family having a picnic.&nbsp; There was a little bit of luncheon meat sticking out of a sandwich.&nbsp; A yellowjacket landed on the meat, cut off a chunk and flew away with it, bobbling from right to left as it flew off.&nbsp; Was freaky.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=2323.msg16042.html#msg16042">Quote from: JustDesserts on June 09, 2006, 11:00:04 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What is an earwig?&nbsp; It sounds horrific.&nbsp; And I&#39;m with you on the spider thing.&nbsp; Sure, they eat other bugs, but they&#39;re just plain awful.&nbsp; Fortunately, I haven&#39;t seen any in this apartment.&nbsp; And that treacherous -pede thing is really the only serious bug we&#39;ve had.&nbsp; In CA around this time of year, we would get this disgustingly huge, long-legged flying mosquito-looking things.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re called, but they fly really erratically and they have a long snout thing.&nbsp; They&#39;re my worst nightmare.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t seen any here, thank goodness!!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Checked out the earwig link - yup, those things are hideous.&nbsp; Had a lot of them in the garden in CA.&nbsp; They loved to hang out in the potting soil bag.<br /><br />Ah, mosquito hawks.&nbsp; Well, there&#39;s an accurate name if I ever heard one.&nbsp; They&#39;re huge!&nbsp; Good to know they&#39;re harmless.&nbsp; If only they weren&#39;t so disgusting.&nbsp; <br /><br />How terrifying - a brown recluse!?!&nbsp; Black widows are just a joe-average spider compared to those things.&nbsp; Speaking of black widows, they seem to be rather common in CA.&nbsp; Had quite a few of those in the garden, and one in the garage.&nbsp; I love that they stay outside, though.&nbsp; We never saw one in the house.<br /><br />Yeah, anything that stings is a problem.&nbsp; I had a gigantic bee in my room a couple days ago.&nbsp; I pointed my fan at it and it blew him out the window.&nbsp; Meg, your story about the yellowjacket was both hilarious and creepy.&nbsp; :)&nbsp;

				Pretty sure they&#39;re not silverfish. I&#39;ve seen grown ones of those back<br />home, and what I&#39;m seeing now aren&#39;t as fast, plus they&#39;re more of a<br />tan/brown color and the antennae aren&#39;t very long. I guess it&#39;s<br />possible they&#39;re young silverfish (don&#39;t know what those look like),<br />but they don&#39;t seem to be in the same family. I&#39;ll have to do some<br />more Googling from work.<br /><br />Some of you are describing house centipedes, those terrifying looking<br />things with crazy antennae and a ton of long legs that like to fall<br />off your wall when you try to get rid of them. Our cat loves those<br />too. This site has a bunch of good/terrible pictures of them:<br />http://whatsthatbug.com/cent_2.html<br />THANKFULLY I HAVE NEVER SEEN ONE OF THESE ON MY BED.&nbsp; :-o I&#39;ve only<br />ever seen them on the wall in the kitchen, and thankfully I&#39;ve never<br />seen their prey, the roach, in my apartment. These things I&#39;m seeing<br />in my room are not nearly as scary.

I don&#39;t have a HUGE bug problem, but I have a few, and hey - it&#39;s free. <br /><br />I have serious issues with stinging, flying things. I&#39;m the one at a picnic or any other social function who screams and flees the area when a bee/wasp/etc. starts flying too close to me. Really embarrassing. Luckily, my whole life I have only been stung once. I don&#39;t know what it was - bee or wasp or something - but it made the underside of my arm red from my sholder to my elbow for days. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s normal... and additionally it hurt like hell, so I just steer clear of them.

				I moved out of a pre-war rent-stab blg in astoria due to a massive bed bug problem.&nbsp; The whole blg was infested, and had to be exterminated multiple times.&nbsp; But I just moved cuz it was the last straw of a number of problems.&nbsp; I&#39;m told the problem is everywhere in astoria and nyc.&nbsp; The bugs are essentially hitchhikers, easy to pick up from someone even on the bus or subway, and hard to eradicate.&nbsp; &nbsp;Let me tell you, the whole experience was pure hell.

				I found out what those mystery bugs are that I&#39;ve been seeing! Sow bugs. Apparently they are common, but I&#39;d never seen them before. And they are crustaceans, not insects, so maybe that&#39;s why they don&#39;t creep me out as much as the rest of the bugs around here do. :wink: <br /><br />here&#39;s a picture of one: http://home.att.net/~larvalbugrex/sowbug.jpg<br />They&#39;re a lot smaller than that.

				For anyone not already aware, the bug Harlan posted is the house centipede. They are regarded as helpful bugs because they eat household pests like cockroaches and silverfish, and they have no interest in you or your food. It&#39;s too bad that they are terrifying looking because I do like that they eat roaches and don&#39;t damage anything or make webs like spiders. I&#39;ve never seen a roach in my place but I&#39;ve seen a few of those. Maybe that&#39;s why. The only enemy they&#39;re going to find in my apartment is our cat.

				well, not to freak anyone out, but I had to move out of my old apt building a couple of years ago because of ..... BED BUGS.<br /><br />They are EVIL critters. You can&#39;t get rid of them. I had two roommates and of course I was the only one getting eaten alive. The scary part? I couldnt find ANY in my bed and I looked in every possible crevice. They live in the walls - they actually like wood. They&#39;re called bed bugs though because they&#39;re commonly found in bed frames and mattresses as that&#39;s where they have their nightly feast.<br /><br />Next to getting gay bashed, it was probably the worst experience I&#39;ve had in Astoria. The landlord came in every couple of weeks to fumigate but it didnt do anything. Apparently, they had been in the building for years but no one told me when I moved in.<br /><br />Bed bugs are becoming a very very very big issue in Astoria so everyone should beware of hand-me-down furniture and stuff. Even the cleanest of apartments and hotels have had bed bug issues.<br /><br />Anyhow, never move to 34-04 34th ave. Its bad news.<br />

				your landlord may have cheaped out on the type of extermination. knock wood (no pun inteneded) mine are gone. and they weren&#39;t in my bed either. although my landlord maintains that there are no cracks in the walls and that since we don&#39;t have roaches we couldn&#39;t have a problem, and tried to pass the blame and bill on me(unsuccessfully). and it was my room that was infested, not the others. that was the worst ordeal i have ever gone through. october will be a year since we nuked the suckers in two shots. i did recently wake up one morning with a few welts so john and i promptly got bug spray and he went to work. here are a few upkeep tips:<br />raise your bed off the floor with risers. and keep it away from the wall if you can (my room is so small i cannot). the more room under your bed the easier you can spray underneath.<br />on the risers, put double stick tape. if they come up from the carpet the have to get to the legs and they won&#39;t get far. and since my bed is against the wall we lined the wall with double stick tape as well (right above the molding near the bottom). so if they come up from the carpet they get stuck there as well. <br />spray the crap out of your box spring and floor under the bed every few weeks. john went one step above for me though. since my mattress is encased in a plastic cover he took construction grade plastic sheeting and wrapped my box spring in it while it was covered in bug killing goodness. so i basically sleep in a plastic bubble. but i haven&#39;t been bit since.<br />there&#39;s another thread about the blood suckers somewhere.

He explained that the stuff they use now, and the placement of the stuff, can be safe for pets and children.<br /><br />He comes once a month. He puts a dab of this stuff on the hinges of everything in my house. Just a drop on the hinge. I *never* realised that that is one spot that we never touch. And because the cabinet doors, room doors and closets are usually closed, there is no way a pet can get to it.<br /><br />As for the mice—I hate them but still use them— glue traps behind all kitchen appliances and in a corner of every closet.

				I&#39;m not afraid to admit that I am a country girl from farm country who at one time was not afraid to go swimming in a creak to cool down even if it met a chance of getting a few blood sucker leeches on me. Never had one on me but my brother did. I used to take those potatoes bugs and tap on them until they formed a ball and fling them from the palm of my hand at my brothers and their friends growing up. I would pluck spiders from the house and re-release them outside, some where huge. What fun times. However, after moving to NYC and seeing all the cockroaches, I have totally become freaked out from them. I used to live in a pre war building on 27th street that was infested with millions of them. You could turn on the stove and 10 to 20 would run out of the stove. Especially when my neighbor moved and they started tearing up the apartment to redo it I had tons flow into my apartment. My landlord would exterminate once a month but to no avail. It was the main reason why I had nine cats, they kept the massive cockroach wave at bay. When I finally did have money to move, I ended up throwing away hundreds of dollars worth of kitchen appliances that where clean, and nothing wrong except for the fact they where infested with roaches. I CANT stand roaches, or the BIG HUGE WATER BUGS that look like roaches but bigger.<br /><br />My new apartment didn&#39;t have roaches thank god I manage not to bring any when I moved, but being a basement apartment it had silverfish, giant black water bugs, the house centipede, ants and even an occasional water bug and mosquitoes when it was warm. The apartment in the basement had a washer and dryer and I remember once doing my laundry and pulling my clothes out of the dryer only to find these HUGE black legs. Turns out there must have been a water bug in the washer or something and he was now toast and all over my clothes. Grossest thing I ever had to deal with. Gives me the shudders just thinking about it. Since then I moved into a nice apartment that had no bugs for a short time and now I have to move into an apartment that has roaches once again. Can I never get away from the roaches. Before moving my stuff in I set off 3 of those roach bombs and laid down a whole s___ load of traps but does anyone have any Idea on how to keep them out.&nbsp; Before I move my stuff in I want to eliminate the problem and try to keep them out. I have filled up any hole I saw but I’m sure they will still come in from cracks where the floor meets the wall and so forth. Any ideas as to how to limit them from coming in. <br /><br />OOOh, as I write this, I’m in my boyfriends apartment, he isn&#39;t here and I just saw a big black water bug start to run across the floor.&nbsp; He is having problems with them coming in looking for moisture. I got him and squashed him, but I don&#39;t want to touch it. EWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Now do you blame me for having 9 cats, disgusting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sorry the pic is so big, I don&#39;t have my software to resize it.<br /><br /><br />(http://i39.photobucket.com/albums/e185/kildarasidhe/P7220020.jpg)

				I am amused, maybe wrongly so, by the combination of the picture and your quote at the botttom.&nbsp; Anyway, here are a few suggestions I had previously gotten from the googling my problem when I was at my wits end from crushing yet another lovely pestilent of my building.&nbsp; <br /><br />1) Caulk any crevices between floorboards, wall, doorframes, tub, toilet, sink, etc.&nbsp; If you stop and look well you&#39;d be surprised at how much you find to do this to.&nbsp; Make sure you get a caulking lesson from someone who is familiar with it if you have never done it before.&nbsp; Also make sure that there aren&#39;t cracks under your door, etc.<br /><br />2) Depending on if you have animals or children in the apt. you can do one or a combination of things:&nbsp; Bug spray, boric acid, peppermint oil, sticky glue traps (make sure they&#39;re made for bugs and not mice).<br /><br />3) Preventative maintenance helps also.&nbsp; Try to make sure that you don&#39;t leave dishes in the sink, trash in the trashcan, or crumbs on the counter.&nbsp; Also try to make sure that none of your cats is stashing cat food anywhere, and also that you clean the litterbox really often as six legged critters can sometimes be drawn to the excrement.&nbsp;

				Try changing your detergent or not using softener.<br /><br />As for the bedbugs - just because you don&#39;t see them doesn&#39;t mean their not there. And if you think you *might* have them, I would call the exterminator sooner rather than later. Are the bites in rows or randomly spaced?

				Goldfishboy: I had a similar occurrence this Spring.&nbsp; The bites were big and caused inflammation and localized fever. The itching lasted for weeks- like it was time released! It turned out that I had a spider infestation! So I had the super caulk up all the holes and seams in the apartment and then I put extra boric acid around everywhere, mothballs in the corners, and had the exterminator come in.&nbsp; There has been a lot of poison involved- I don&#39;t know what I would have done if I had pets or children. Everything seems to be under control now, but I do think Astoria is extra buggy. I also bought this: http://bitesandstingsonline.com/extractor.htm which might seem extreme, but really helped suck the poison out. I highly recommend it!

				What does everyone use as far as Roach Motels, or those elctronic gadgets you plug in that emit anti critter signals? I found a roach on my pillow last night, and I&#39;m freaked out. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love spooning, but not with roaches. Thanks ...

				Yeah.&nbsp; I saw a big sucker perched up on top of my window in my bedroom last night.

				OHGOD I hate roaches. I have waged war, and continue to do so, in my ancient apartment since the day I moved to Astoria. They definately come out of the woodwork during this sweltering heat wave. For those of you just joining the eternal fight against <em>Periplaneta americana</em>, I found this helpful &quot;Ask Gothamist&quot; primer published last spring:<br /><br /><em>Q: This morning as I was getting ready for work I found myself looking into the beady eyes of a humungous cockroach. After some squealing and donning of rubber yellow gloves I managed to kill the roach with a hammer. There must be a better and cleaner way to exterminate roaches. What options do I have? Also, what is an acceptable level of cohabitation with these buggers? Is it realistic to believe that if the right steps were taken my apartment could be 100% roach free? This is the first cockroach I have ever seen during my 8 months in this apartment.<br /><br />-Scared to sleep<br /><br />A: Ask Gothamist has done battle with roaches before. And it is a battle. For a really bad infestation, you truly have to wage an all-out war, but we believe the war can be won. Even if you just see one roach, it&#39;s worth it to take preventitive steps - because roaches breed like crazy and can multiply quickly. Your first step should be a thorough cleaning of your apartment. If you&#39;ve been hoarding bags from the grocery store, get rid of them - that&#39;s how a lot of roaches and eggs find their way into your home. Throw out any cardboard boxes too. Make sure that all of your foodstuffs are sealed in airtight containers - especially dried goods like cereal, flour, etc. Examine all open containers and when in doubt, throw it out.<br /><br />After thoroughly cleaning you&#39;ll want to exterminate. According to this article on Cockroach Elimination by an entomologist at the University of Kentucky, &quot;Homeowners attempting to control cockroaches themselves will find insecticidal baits and boric acid effective and relatively easy to use.&quot; Baits are a good first step as they are small, have no odor, and are easy to place around the house. Boric acid is extremely effective if used properly - according to the above article, &quot;For best results, the powder should be applied in a very thin layer barely visible to the naked eye. Piles or heavy accumulations will be avoided by foraging cockroaches much as we would avoid walking through a snow drift.&quot; You should probably try a combo of bait and boric acid, focusing on the kitchen and bathroom areas. Baits can be placed on the floor up against the wall, in cabinets, under sinks, etc. Boric acid should be lightly poured along cracks where roaches might enter your apartment. Needless to say you don&#39;t want to pour the stuff on your counter tops or put it near your food, although it has a low toxicity to humans and pets.<br /><br />We also suggest you talk to your landlord and see if he or she is willing to send an exterminoator to your apartment on a regular basis - in some apartment buildings, exterminators come around every month and this seems to prevent the cockroach problem. And if and when you do see an actual roach, we don&#39;t know of a better way of killing it than to simply squash the little bugger. </em><br /><br />Battle on!

				When I was in Manhattan, my flatmate and I kept a clean apartment (literally clean enough to eat off of), we didn&#39;t hoard anything, we swept crumbs and all at least three times a day, we cleaned the kitchen and the bathroom every day, we sprayed the kitchen and the bathroom....<br />and still about once a month we&#39;d find one little sucker....<br /><br />what finally worked? plugging all the holes in the wall - every crack of drywall underneath windows or along the edge of the floor - even if they were nothing -&nbsp; we plugged all of them in! <br /><br />Lo and behold, I never saw another roach for the rest of my time with Columbia Apartment Housing.

				Hello,<br />Boric acid does wonders-just spread some around the cracks in the walls and in between spaces in the appliences-bugs will avoid it completely.<br />Another (less toxic) option is laurel. Just spead leave pieces in the same places as above-this has to be changed often.

				I had an infestation last year with the german ones.&nbsp; I was never able to be home when the exterminator showed up.&nbsp; (Always during work hours :x)&nbsp; So I shelled out a bunch of money and hired my own exterminator.&nbsp; He showed up, and within 2 weeks, problem solved.&nbsp; That was at the end of August, I think.&nbsp; I&#39;ve only seen maybe 10 roaches total in the last year, and they&#39;re always dead.&nbsp; So I think the stuff he used must be pretty potent, because it still seems to be working.

				i think in my 5.5 years here i have caught 1 that was larger then 2 inches. we randomly get the regular sized ones (im thinking young teens maybe?) and sometimes smaller ones. we also do the best we can with not leaving dishes unwashed and crumbs on the floor but it is after all apartment living and we can&#39;t do anything about the other tenants who may not mind the little nasties! Luckily our building does have an exterminator come one saturday a month. AND my little Tallulah is a champion critter catcher so that helps too. they used to really really really REALLY creep me out when i first moved here, and they still kinda do (don&#39;t even get me started on your new monsteroaches) but at least now when i see one and scream, i can then instinctively go for the raid in 2 seconds flat!

				without actually showing me a picture, what&#39;s the difference in these various roaches. do they have different accents or something? i&#39;ve seen enough roached lifetime to probably have encountered all of them, but to me a roach is a roach.<br />and i think it&#39;s kind of freaky that some of you can tell which roach is which! eeewwww!<br />the only roach i can tell is a live one or a dead one.

				Well, they are different species, and are different sizes, have different nesting habits, and somewhat different, although overlapping, habitats.<br /><br />(Yes, I have learned far too much about roaches lately....)<br /><br />This is what I remember from the sites I perused:<br /><br />-American cockroaches:&nbsp; these are the biggest roaches in the NYC area.&nbsp; They are called palmetto bugs in Florida, and they are the only common roaches that can fly, at least in NYC.&nbsp; The websites all say their maximum size is about 2&quot;, but I&#39;ve definitely seen ones that approach 3&quot;.&nbsp; These same websites also say that NYC is too far north for them to fly.&nbsp; They obviously didn&#39;t see the one flying around our hall light.&nbsp; :roll:&nbsp; I&#39;ve seen others fly, too - one in our living room last summer, and one at work a few years ago.<br /><br />American cockroaches do not generally live in buildings, but prefer sewers and underground places.&nbsp; They reproduce relatively slowly, with a long gestation period, and produce only a fraction of the number of German roaches that can come from one roach in a year.&nbsp; They are a relatively light, reddish brown - some say mahogany-ish.<br /><br />-German cockroaches:&nbsp; these are the most common household pests in NYC.&nbsp; They are usually less than 1&quot; long, and are the ones that people are generally referring to when they say, &quot;my apartment has roaches!!!&quot;&nbsp; They are darker brown than American roaches, live in buildings, and have a faster and extremely productive life cycle.&nbsp; If you see small pale or mottled creatures that look sort of roach-like in your kitchen, those are German cockroach nymphs - the babies - and that means you have nests in your building (although not necessarily your apartment).<br /><br />Others that are around but less common are the Oriental cockroach and the Banded cockroach.&nbsp; I&#39;ve had a couple of apartments where I&#39;ve occasionally seen big, round, nearly black bugs that I think are Oriental cockroaches.

				Blech!<br />thanks for the info. <br />i think growing up my mom&#39;s building had both of them-she used to get some big suckers. john&#39;s seems to have just the german, since they&#39;re not the &quot;oh my god, that&#39;s gross!&quot; kind. but since i usually see them in the kitchen, i still think &quot;oh my god that&#39;s gross&quot; let&#39;s just say, that unless it comes out of the fridge i don&#39;t eat it, and unless i just washed it, i don&#39;t use it. <br />they have a monthly exterminator that they had to stop using b/c of his fish and my ozzy.<br />won&#39;t listen to me about the boric acid. men...<br />

				Unless you have a really bad infestation, boric acid really works well.&nbsp; A few apartments ago, I started to see roaches in the first week I moved in - five, IIRC.&nbsp; I saw three in the kitchen - one on a dish in the sink, blech - and one in my bedroom.&nbsp; And then - one was on the underside of the armrest of my couch, and ran across the back of my hand.&nbsp; Double blech. Small German roaches.&nbsp; So I got some boric acid and spread it all around.&nbsp; In the two years I was in that apartment, I saw only two more - one alive, and one dead (the dead one was in fact an American roach).<br /><br />But if you have pets that are not caged in your apartment, you shouldn&#39;t use boric acid, I&#39;ve heard.&nbsp; Some commercial roach traps use a gel form of boric acid that is safe around pets.

				The problem with bedbugs isn&#39;t necessarily lack of response, it&#39;s that the pesticides that once contained them are no longer in use -- primarily DDT.<br /><br />The pesticides currently used are not as effective, partly because they are often more species-specific.&nbsp; Pests like roaches have been more common, so have been more targeted.&nbsp;

				I&#39;m coming out the closet.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been fighting bedbugs this summer. Not a big infestation, just enough to keep me completely miserable. I&#39;ve thrown out thousands of dollars worth of clothing, bed, bedding, furniture, etc. (properly bagged, of course). Everytime I think I&#39;ve got them licked and can relax I wake up with another god damn bite.

				Thanks. I&#39;ve done the hot dryer thing - at least 20 minuites on high - and then put the clothes in clean plastic bags. Then I would open the bag and smell that smell (Of course you get paranoid and start smelling things and itching EVERYWHERE). I finally threw nearly all of my stuff away. Everything not thrown away is in a plastic bag. <br /><br />The landlord knows and I&#39;ve had the exterminator in several times. I have not insisted that the landlord or exterminator check my neighbor&#39;s apartments, though. I wonder if that&#39;s where the problem is ... <br />&nbsp;

				They are smaller than mosquito bites, generally on the extermities (fingers, toes) and may occur in rows of 2 or 3. I&#39;m just guessing but you probably have moquito bites. If you have bedbugs you will generally see one or two fresh bites every morning.

				ok. thanks. good to know.

				cool. I like the idea of sharing the information because like you said, it really is helpful for everyone to be open and supportive and disspell myths while sharing tactics for fighting them. One of the biggest problems in NYC is that you can call the health department (or 311) and ask whether a restaurant you ate at had rats during inspection... BUT you can&#39;t find out if the building you live in is infested. They claim there are privacy laws, but I&#39;m talking about if you suspect that your <em>own</em> building is infested. If none of my next-door neighbors are going to speak up, then each individual will fall to the bedbug and ultimately feel as if they&#39;re fighting alone. Then ultimately the landlord wins because there&#39;s no organized effort to confront him-- everyone&#39;s battling in silence, behind closed doors.<br /><br />

Or if <em>everyone</em> has complained of bedbugs. By law, he&#39;s only required to hire an exterminator. And even then, its his decision whether he wants to have just those apartments treated or spill the beans and have the whole building treated. I think we can guess which option most cheapskate landlords go with. <br /><br />My landlord in Brooklyn wouldn&#39;t treat each apartment until each tenant could <span class="bbc_u">PROVE</span> that there was a systemic flea infestation (which there was). We had to actually capture the bugs on a piece of fly paper. (Apparently having <em>twenty-three </em>bites on my legs weren&#39;t proof enough.)<br /><br />I suspect that one of my neighbors, on my floor, has extreme bed bugs. But since this person is an anti-social hermit that none of my other neighbors talk to, no one knows for sure. But there are signs. Additionally, a lot of the other tenants in my building are hispanic and do not necessarily speak english. They have different circumstances ruling their everyday lives and ordinarily do not approach my landlord for broken door jams, much less bug problems.<br /><br />What does my management company say? &quot;No problems!&quot;, of course.<br /><br />Guess I&#39;ll just sit and wait for them to come!

				Landlords had better be worried about treating the whole building because retroactive rent abatements have been awarded (for rent stabilized buildings) when they can&#39;t prove they treated the whole problem:<br /><br />http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1087501796449<br /><br />I think it&#39;s more complicated when a mgmt co is involved, but generally they contract to fulfill various owner obligations so they are on the hook for handling the infestation.<br /><br />I got the *feeling* from letters sent by my mgmt co re: building wide treatment last month that they were putting the onus on the tenants to do everything they said pre and post treatment or have their tenancy terminated: I think they&#39;d like to push out a few of the long term residents so they can continue gutting units and turning them into 3 tiny BR apts to rent to young roomates who want to pay $700 each (vs. working parents, etc.)&nbsp; I was careful to do and document everything they said (even though I was not suffering the infestation I did *last* summer) because I&#39;m not moving unless I want to.<br /><br />Talk to your neighbors, maybe there is somebody bilingual who can help with the spanish speaking residents.&nbsp; A landlord presented with a lot of complaints will have little choice but to act.&nbsp; Consider forming an ad-hoc group w/ an impressive name (e.g. The XX-YY ZZ Ave Residents Anti-BedBug Coallition) to send very formal letters via registered-mail as well.&nbsp; Once they realize they&#39;re facing rent abatements *and* ever worsening infestation they&#39;ll get the point.<br /><br />If somebody moves out because of bugs, don&#39;t be shy about mentioning it to people who come to view the apartment.&nbsp; It is helpful to know how your owner/mgmt co advertises vacancies (do you remember how you found your place?)&nbsp; because you can find out when an apt. is being shown.&nbsp; My old owner used to do it about 5:30PM so peopel could make it after work.&nbsp; He&#39;d show once to a whole mob of people and pick the application that was best.&nbsp; A situation like that would be ideal to make a bedbug apartment difficult to rent: just leave a stack of LARGE FONT xeroxes in the entryway after the show starts.<br /><br />OK, I may be fantasizing with that last bit, but it&#39;s possible.<br /><br />

				I guess mine started slow, but I didn&#39;t think about it at first. &nbsp;I just kept waking up with what I thought were mosquito bites. &nbsp;My roommate thought she had hives. &nbsp;Eventually, it got to the point of VERY ANNOYING to wake up in the morning with 4 or 5 new bites a day. &nbsp;I think it depends on your level of infestation. &nbsp;Oh god, what bad memories I have. &nbsp;My confirmation that I had them was that it decided to crawl across my book one day on my desk, as I was preparing to resign my lease. &nbsp;It told me they are not microscopic nor solely nightcrawlers. &nbsp;I took it as a sign from above and did not renew my lease. &nbsp;Please don&#39;t read below if you don&#39;t want to find out more about this. &nbsp;An excerpt:<br /><br />http://cahe.nmsu.edu/pubs/_g/g-318.html<br /><br />The mature bed bug is a brown- to mahogany-colored, wingless insect. Its size depends on how recently it has eaten a blood meal. An unfed bed bug is between 1/4 and 3/8 inches long. The upper surface of its body has a papery, crinkly, flimsy appearance. When engorged with blood, its body becomes elongated and swollen, and its color changes from brown to dull red. The color, size, and shape change from an unfed to a full bug is remarkable.<br />Bed bug eggs are white and about 1/3-inch long. Under favorable conditions the female bed bug lays about 200 eggs at the rate of 3 or 4 per day. Eggs have a sticky coating and stick to objects where they are laid. It usually takes the eggs 6 to 17 days to hatch, and the newly emerged nymphs will feed immediately. A bed bug goes through five molts (shedding of its skin) before it reaches maturity. Depending on environmental factors and the availability of food, there can be considerable variation in developmental rate. Bed bugs may live for several weeks to several months without feeding, depending on temperature.<br />A bed bug generally feeds at night, but if it is hungry and the area has a dim light, it may feed during the day. A bed bug generally pierces the skin of humans as they sleep. It injects a fluid into the human skin to aid in obtaining blood. Often this fluid causes a welt on the skin that becomes irritated, inflamed, and itchy. If left undisturbed, a full-grown bed bug becomes engorged with blood in 3 to 5 minutes. It then crawls into hiding, remaining there for several days to digest its meal. When hunger returns, the bug emerges from hiding and seeks another blood meal.<br />Heavily used hiding places are evident by black or brown spots of dried blood excrement on the surfaces where the bugs rest. Eggs, egg shells, and cast skins may be found near these places. Usually there is an offensive odor where bed bugs are numerous. In early infestations the bed bugs are found only about the tufts, seams, and folds of mattresses and daybed covers; later they spread to cracks and crevices in the bedsteads. If allowed to multiply, they establish themselves behind baseboards, window and door casings, pictures, and moldings, and in furniture, loosened wallpaper, and cracks in plaster and partitions.

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: NY Times, published Tuesday, September 19, 2006</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">By SEWELL CHAN<br />New York City is experiencing a dramatic resurgence in bedbugs — those pesky oval insects that hide in the crevices of furniture and feast on human blood at night—and officials are confounded about how best to respond.<br /><br />(http://graphics10.nytimes.com/images/2006/09/19/nyregion/190_Bedbug_2.jpg) Bedbugs, including the one alive, center toward left.<br /><br />Moreover, city officials revealed yesterday that state regulators had failed to publish standards for sanitizing used mattresses and box springs before they can be resold — even though such standards were supposed to be developed years ago. The proliferation of secondhand furniture is believed to be one factor in the rise in bedbug infestations.<br /><br />Although bedbugs are not considered a major health threat because they do not transmit disease, they can cause itchy welts and often require expensive exterminations. In the last fiscal year, the city’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development received 4,638 complaints about bedbugs in rental housing—nearly five times as many as in the previous year.<br /><br />At a City Council hearing yesterday on the issue, entomologists and exterminators said that bedbugs have been proliferating at levels not seen in decades. The cause of the resurgence is not certain, but experts have speculated that increased international travel, a recent ban on powerful pesticides and the market in used furniture have been factors.<br /><br />A bill by Councilwoman Gale A. Brewer of Manhattan would ban the sale of reconditioned mattresses—old mattresses with a new fabric cover sewn onto them, often with the original upholstery and padding underneath—and create a task force to study the issue and make recommendations within a year.<br /><br />The International Sleep Products Association, the trade association for mattress manufacturers, said yesterday that it supported a ban on the sale of reconditioned mattresses. “The filth from the used mattress that lies just beneath the new fabric cover of a reconditioned product can be astounding,” said Ryan Trainer, a lawyer for the association.<br /><br />Andrew Eiler, director of legislation for the city’s Department of Consumer Affairs, however, expressed uncertainty about the bill. A twin-size mattress without a box spring can be bought for $40 from the Salvation Army, or about $50 less than a new mattress. “While $50 may not appear as a significant difference to some, it may be an unbridgeable gap to consumers with limited incomes,” he said.<br /><br />Under a 1996 law, manufacturers of used bedding must certify that they have sanitized the bedding, using standards developed by the state’s Department of State, in consultation with the Department of Health. The law was later expanded to cover sellers of used bedding—there are currently 261 registered with the state—as well.<br /><br />The problem, Mr. Eiler said, is that the state has never published sanitization standards. “Since there are no rules, the certifications are relatively meaningless,” he said.<br /><br />In a telephone interview after the hearing, Eamon Moynihan, a spokesman for the Department of State, confirmed that “there were no standards promulgated.” The reasons why were not entirely clear, he said, but it seems that when the staff looked at the 1996 law, they concluded that to enforce it would have made reconditioned mattresses so expensive as to effectively outlaw them.<br /><br />Mr. Moynihan said the department had no plan to revisit the issue.<br /><br />The city does not directly regulate the sale of used mattresses. It licenses 3,795 dealers in secondhand goods, not counting used-car dealers, Mr. Eiler said, but it has no way to know how many of those dealers sell used mattresses. There is just not enough information, he said, to know whether banning the sale of used mattresses in the city would prevent the spread of the pests.<br /><br />Richard J. Pollack, an expert in parasitic insects at the Harvard School of Public Health who testified at the hearing, said he doubted that the proposed ban would be effective. “As long as used mattresses have value, they will remain a commodity despite attempts to regulate their movements,” he said.<br /><br />The resurgence of bedbugs appears to be affecting the city as a whole. “There is no clear pattern, or neighborhood that’s particularly at risk, at least that I’m aware of,” Daniel Kass, director of environmental surveillance and policy for the city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said at the hearing.<br /><br />Exterminators have been grappling with how to suppress the infestations. Several of them testified yesterday, and Cindy Mannes, of the National Pest Management Association, said in a telephone interview that it recorded a 71 percent increase from 2000 to 2005 in the number of exterminators who had received calls about bedbugs.<br /><br />Councilman Leroy G. Comrie Jr. of Queens, who presided over the hearing, said that residents often blame themselves for infestations. The insects easily crawl between homes through walls, floors and ceilings.<br /><br />Louis N. Sorkin, an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History, said there was an urgent need to raise public awareness. “In some cases, people are using old remedies that may be dangerous to one’s health, such as spraying a mattress with gasoline or kerosene to kill bedbugs,” he said.<br /><br />Dr. Pollack said, “We shouldn’t be too hysterical when dealing with bedbugs.” At one point, he showed a slide of a 1793 pamphlet on how to control bedbugs. ‘We keep trying to throw things at them, but they are outwitting us,” he said.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I have a metal loft bed so I never worried......until a few weeks ago when I found a series of small bites on my arm. They fit the characteristic pattern- little bumps lined up in groups of three&nbsp; :-o<br /><br />So I immediately tossed the mattress, replaced it with a brand new one, did a LOT of laundry in hot water and dried on the furnace setting, ripped up the carpet (needed replacing anyway), and vaccumed the couch thoroughly. Luckily I&#39;ve got one of those Ikea metal loft beds, so no box spring or wooden surfaces to worry about.<br /><br />Have yet to see any more bites, knock on wood.

				http://bedbugblog.blogspot.com/ <br /><br />Do your linens touch the floor? Even if your bedding has been sanitized, if they are living elsewhere in the room they can travel to the bed. They are also very, very hard to get out of box springs if they are in there. You can buy vinyl mattress covers for your mattress and box spring at Bargain Stop on 30th Ave and 34thish. I suggest doubling up - two covers for both. It&#39;s suggested that you tape up the zipper. <br /><br />My roommate doesn&#39;t get bitten. They first appeared in her room but she actually saw a bug and that was why she called an exterminator. They just don&#39;t bite her. I hear vitamin b1 is supposed to make you taste nasty to bugs (toxic in high levels, though). <br /><br />You can wrap the legs of your bed in tape (sticky side out) and keep the linens from dragging on the floor to help keep them away from your bed. I&#39;ve also heard of putting bed legs in plastic yogurt containers - empty or with mineral oil - to keep them from crawling up. <br /><br />All of that said ... I don&#39;t know what to think of the fact that you are only occasionally getting bites. Also, note that they are nocturnal and live in tiny crevices. I think I&#39;ve heard about using glue traps not to erradiate them but just to trap them and confirm that you do have them.

				the extirminator has to treat the walls if its this bad. they will have to do the whole building and basically nuke the walls.<br />mine were never in my bed, they were in the cracks and crevices. i made sure the extirminators (A Federal, based in brooklyn) saw where all the cracks i was concerned were and they super shot the cracks. <br />they came twice, and said if they had to come one more time they would recommend to the landlord (again!)to do the whole building through the walls.

				Alright people, I&#39;m scared that a bedbug bite just woke me up. I don&#39;t have to be in the city til 2 today, so when I woke up and saw 5:56, I was pretty angry!&nbsp; :ticked:<br /><br />So will ya&#39;ll who have had them tell me if this is typical of the little jerks? I had a few bites on my arm early last week, and I was *hoping* that they were mosquito bites. They were all on my left arm, just below my elbow. I wasn&#39;t in town from Friday - Monday, so I don&#39;t know if anything would have happened over the weekend. Tonight is my first night back. I woke myself up because I was scratching my right arm in my sleep. I fully woke up, thought, &quot;CRAP, this better not be bedbugs,&quot; and I could feel that the itchiness on my arm was a bite of some sort and stood up out of bed. I peeled back the sheets and THEN turned the light on (because I heard that they don&#39;t like the light, and I was looking for them). I didn&#39;t see anything. I lifted up the mattress, and didn&#39;t see anything there either.<br /><br />So I checked myself out, and I think I&#39;ve got 3 bites I think right now, one on my right forearm (the itch that woke me up), one on my right elbow, and one near my left shoulderblade. I&#39;m sure they&#39;re all new, since when I found them, they were little pinpricks, and now they&#39;re bigger. The one I was scratching is probably 75% the size of a quarter, and the other two are about half that size. The bigger one is a non-uniform shape (probably because I was/is scratching it), the other two are round.<br /><br />Would I even actually feel these bites? I might just be super sensitive to this because I&#39;ve been thinking and reading about it on here, even though I said I would NEVER READ THIS THREAD AGAIN. Haha...<br /><br />I have not seen any of the telltale blood signs or anything like that, and this is only the 2nd time I can remember being bitten, so if I do have them, its early on. Should I go get those mattress bags at the bargain shop that someone mentioned? Will that even make a difference if 2 sides of my bed are against the wall? I have a small room, so its really the only place for it. I&#39;m going to vacuum in a couple hours (no middle of the night vacuuming for me, that&#39;s a jerky move, haha) and wash all my blankets and stuff in hot water when the laundromat opens.<br /><br />Sorry for the long post, but I am SO GROSSED OUT.&nbsp; :|

I know they&#39;re harmless, but LOOK AT THAT THING! It was ridiculous huge. We&#39;ve also had mice here (we stuffed steel wool in cracks where they&#39;d come through, and that&#39;s taken care of it), and oddly enough, they didn&#39;t bother me because we had a mouse issue at one of my old jobs so I was used to them.

				I&#39;ve got the exact same problems (as I&#39;ve been posting here): bites in twos or threes, every 7-10 days, unlikely to be a mosquito, and&nbsp; most disturbingly, <strong>no visible signs of bed bugs</strong>. But after reading enigmacat and daisy&#39;s posts, I realize that you <em>don&#39;t need</em> to see them to know that they&#39;re gaining a foothold in your life.<br /><br />So I&#39;ve been talking to our exterminator. My building management has him come once a month for cockroach spraying (another totally disgusting infestation in this filthy city). Being very knowledgeable, he told me authoritatively that:<br /><br />1) When the bed bug infestation is just beginning, or when the individual bugs are young, the cycle between bites is a few days because they have to molt to grow and re-feed and thus build up to capacity population.<br /><br />2) Bed bugs use the same mode of targeting as mosquitos: CO2 detection. Some people emit more CO2 than others (hi, my name is annie) and will get bites even when their bedmates will not.<br /><br />Well, this all sufficiently freaked me out.<br /><br />So he&#39;s coming to take a look (and hopefully spray) this Thursday.<br /><br />I KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. I could see the rising tide of infestation, coming at me through the ancient hollow walls of my decrepit apartment... and I was powerless to do anything about it. Damn this place.<br /><br /><br />

				At least you have a knowledgeable exterminator. The last one told my roommate they didn&#39;t bite her because they didn&#39;t like her blood. <br /><br />The C02 and bite cycle information is good to know, if icky. <br /><br />Is it time for a bedbug support group yet?

				Hi gang,<br /><br />Definately have the exterminator come and do a bedbug treatment. I had one, and no more problems. (They spray Suspend, use a residual dust, then a fumigation where you have to leave your apt. for a few hours) If you have bites every other night, or every night; if they are on your legs, back, arms, or feet; if the bites are in rows of 2-3 bites (sometimes more); if they are super-duper itchy, then, you have bedbugs.<br /><br />Responsible landlords are very keen on making sure that any complaint of bedbugs or potential infestation of bedbugs are taken seriously.<br /><br />Good luck!

As for the fumigation, I had it done just 3 weeks ago. And so far, no bb in sight. I live in a 4-floor pre-war building. Enigmacat, if you want, I can get the phone number of the guy who did the apartment. He was very very thorough and professional. Let me know.<br /><br />As for bbs itself. Not something to be proud of, but I am obsessed over them because I am so sensitive to their bites, and when they bite, I know. I take action soon thereafter, and I never get a huge infestation. As for other apartments in the building having them, it is true that your apartment can be bug free, but if the neighbors aren&#39;t doing anything about their infestation, you will most likely see them again in your apartment.<br /><br />In a way, people who get itchy welts after bb bites are lucky. They are able to know that there are bedbugs around. People who do not feel their bites (and there are a few) often think that they don&#39;t have bbs in their homes only to find out that they are totally infested since their breeding cycles haven&#39;t been disrupted due to the lack of awareness of the hosts.<br /><br />Something one can do is refrain from buying anything from thrift stores. Many of the items in there are teeming with bb larvae, adults and eggs.

				Not only have I seen bbs in my apartment on numerous occasions, I&#39;ve also collected them for the exterminator to see. YAY.<br /><br />I&#39;ve also seen a goddamn nymph feeding on my foot one day, and MAN are they small. But not small enough for you not to see. Here is the trick; just be aware. If you feel ANY itch at all, be aware of it, and look around the area for them and usually (for me anyway), I find them! They are VERY fast moving bugs for their size, and hide so easily. They are brown in color.<br /><br />And you know how some describe the smell of bbs as &quot;sickly sweet&quot;? I never knew what the hell that meant exactly until I captured a nymph feeding on my foot and crushed it. WOW. Then I knew what the heck sickly sweet meant. It definately has an odor (I think from the anti-coagulant/anesthetic present in the bb itself). It smells a bit like sweet grass.<br /><br />I think we should bring DDT back just for a little bit. BBs are really pissing me off.&nbsp; :evil: :x

				I am all in favor of bringing back DDT.<br /><br />I know the smell - I can tell whether bedbugs are present by bagging an item in plastic for a week or so and then opening it up and giving it a quick smell (very quick, before the scent has time to dissapate). I found that even after drying items for the recommended length of time, I would sometimes still smell them. Now I dry everything for about 40 minutes.

				We just had a new exterminator in yesterday. He seems more knowledgeable than the other guy (who told us that it wasn&#39;t possible for us to get them from another apartment in the building, and who told my roommate that they didn&#39;t bite her because &quot;they didn&#39;t like her blood.&quot;)<br /><br />I&#39;ve found out that the tenants above us had their apartment fumigated in April - we started having problems in May. Building management called my roommate and drilled her about where she had gotten them from and when she said she supposed it could have come from an international visitor we&#39;d had, he told her not to invite that person over again. Now we find out that we most likely got the problem from within the building and that building management most likely knew about it. Bastards.<br /><br />I think there ought to be laws.<br /><br />1. Building management should have to reveal, when you sign a lease or on request, whether there have been bedbug infestations in the building within the last 18 months. <br />2. If people have bedbugs and do nothing about it, especially when it doesn&#39;t cost them anything because the building is paying for the damn exterminator, something bad ought to happen to them. I&#39;m not sure what.<br />3. When the building management knows there is a problem with bedbugs in the building, even if they do not tell everyone about the problem they should provide educational material to tenants so that they will be able to recognize signs of an infestation, know what to do to avoid one, and what to do if they suspect an infestation.<br />4. Building management should have exterminators check all apartments around an infested apartment. <br />5. If building management claims that there are no other problems in the building when there are, they should be taken out and shot at dawn. Assholes.

				by the way, you can call and report your landlord via 311. I&#39;m not sure what exactly the requirements for a report are (just that you have bedbugs in the apartment, or that the building isn&#39;t getting them taken care of) but I tried to call a while to get more info on how to deal with them and they tried to put me through to that line.<br /><br />Oddly they had no information on how to deal with bedbugs.

The building management is supposed to be responsible for fumigation and pest control. NOT the tenants. Our bedbug treatment was paid for by our landlord, who is quite responsible and very fast. Unless it is specified in your lease that you are responsible for all treatment. To me that sounds really weird. <br /><br />IN any case, it&#39;s good to hear that your apartments have been treated.<br /><br />As for petitioning other to come forward, perhaps it would be oportune now to have inspectors search all apartments for bugs and have them investigate.<br /><br />Like I said, not all people show visible signs of bites. So you could have an infestation, but if you aren&#39;t sensitive to their bites, it&#39;s hard to know that you have bbs.

				I have no idea why they like books, it&#39;s just that everything I read online, and there&#39;s a lot out there on it, said that they love them.&nbsp; So I did without them for four months when I moved.&nbsp; I also did not buy an entirely new real bed and pillows until I moved.&nbsp; I hate to think that you might have to move to be free of these things, but unfortunately your neighbors are probably not as vigilant, and it might have to be a last resort if all else fails.&nbsp; It really sucks, I hate these bugs, they ruin your life.

				Every person&#39;s immune response will be slightly different. The spectrum can run from huge black-and-blue welts (like mine. yay) to nothing at all (some people do not mount an inflammatory response at all to the anti-coagulant). Its debatable whether those who react violently are &quot;luckier&quot; because at least they get an indication of a growing infestation. I suppose that certain neighbors of mine in the building may not react at all if bitten, and so the carrying capacity of the bugs becomes larger and larger until its a full-blown infestation and has spread through the walls before they even really notice (especially if its a cluttered house). <br /><br />Anyways, mosquitoes are a valid option too. I&#39;m beginning to think that I may have had a combination of bug bites (I am a veritable smorgasboard)<br />

				This thread has got my attention again and I started doing reading about this.<br /><br />Two things came to mind for natural &quot;bed bugs&quot; control:<br /><br />First. The millipedes that you see in your apartment are a good thing (like the one Harlan took a picture of). The smaller ones are harmless, but the big ones can sting (though it&#39;s not bad I hear). They are good because they actually eat the larvae of things like roaches and probably bed bugs as well (don&#39;t see why they wouldn&#39;t but haven&#39;t confirmed that specifically). If you see one of these and you have a problem with roaches or bed bugs you might want to let them be instead of killing them.<br /><br />Second, I got to thinking about praying mantises. A friend of mine has a friend who has one for a pet. They are harmless to humans (friendly actually) yet will eat many insects that are their own size. I&#39;ve verified that preying mantises will eat even the large kind of roaches, so there&#39;s no reason they wouldn&#39;t eat bed bugs too. It&#39;s an intersting thought. Many people have them as pets - maybe they will become a popular pet in NYC. :)

				I&#39;d much rather have a mantis or two around my house than bed bugs or roaches that&#39;s for sure. Especially since I know they don&#39;t live off my blood or my food. I wonder why I don&#39;t see too many of them naturally around NYC in the summer. You&#39;d think there would be lots of them since there are so many little critters for them to eat. Mosquitos, roaches, etc.<br /><br />Maybe we should introduce some to NYC next spring (outside) and see how they do. Problem is probably the winter, they need to find an insulated place to lay their eggs I think.

				I have a small potted lemon tree. It now lives in my bedroom by the window, but when I lived in Illinois, it lived on the back porch in fairly full sun. (And thus produced the one and only lemon of its 10 years of life!) It also for one summer was a hangout for a local mantis. I&#39;d never seen one before in the wild, and was surprised how small it was! Perhaps an inch and a half long. I don&#39;t think it would have been a match for a roach, but perhaps for a bedbug.

There are a lot of different sizes of mantises, I&#39;m thinking that to kill the giant roaches in NYC it would need to be a good size mantis. But the smaller mantises might work too since they&#39;d catch the roaches when they are younger/smaller. I found a video somewhere of a mantis attacking one of the monster roaches. That thing didn&#39;t have a chance. I&#39;ll post it if I can find it again.<br /><br />Bed bugs for sure I&#39;d think would be toast.

				I have a vivid memory of being at Crabtree Valley Mall in Raleigh, NC many years ago and emerging to find a large (four inches sounds about right) praying mantis sitting on the back of my car.&nbsp; I walked around just to check it out, and the creepy part was how its head followed me.&nbsp; They look like aliens, too.&nbsp; I got in the car and drove off, and the thing only flew away when I got ready to go on the highway.&nbsp; It hung out for a couple of blocks.&nbsp; <br /><br />But I wouldn&#39;t mind something that would fend off potential bed bug attacks.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been thinking of getting a cuddly pet, but that might be better...?&nbsp; I wonder if praying mantises ever give TLC..?&nbsp; (I&#39;m going to go with no.)

				Something that has disturbed me this year is that I&#39;ve seen a couple roaches in my apartment and no house centipedes whatsoever.

				The war against bedbugs continues. This weekend, after being subjected to the unholy wrath of my roommate, our evil landlord finally sent over someone to caulk/seal our apartment (he was supposed to have done this in May). They did a good job but missed some places, and I am a control freak anyway, so I bought the equipment and have been caulking all the places they missed and recaulking everything that doesn&#39;t look good enough. <br /><br />I now have a whole new list of things I would look for in a new apartment - is it properly caulked and sealed? - for one.<br /><br />I have been sleeping without pillows and that sucks, so I bought new ones and put protectors on them. It&#39;s hard to describe just how nice it is to sleep with a real pillow. I re-treated my futon, made it up so that all of the covers are tucked under and NOTHING touches the floor, and then, in a stroke of genius, I put glue traps under all the legs. Anything that is attracted by my sexy C02 and body heat and tries to get to me in the night will meet a sticky death!!!!!! MUAAAHAHAAHAAAAAAA!!!!!!!<br /><br />I think this whole thing is making me a little &quot;off.&quot;<br /><br />The diatomaceous earth should arrive tomorrow. I can&#39;t effing WAIT.

DDT is bad in the environment when used in agriculture, but it&#39;s not horribly bad for people in small doses. There&#39;s a movement to bring back DDT in malaria-prone regions, I understand. The inside walls of peoples&#39; houses would be sprayed with DDT, and bednets would be impregnated with DDT too. That would eliminate a large number of mosquitos and drastically reduce malaria. Environmental consequences would be minimal, I think, as the amount of DDT sprayed would be orders of magnitude less than was used back in the day to kill insects on crops. (And indirectly, damaged the eggs birds who ate the dying insects...)<br /><br />Enigmacat, we want photos of bedbugs dying a sticky death!<br /><br /><br />

				Enigmacat, hope your bedbug problem gets erradicated once and for all...<br /><br />About DDT, I always thought that part of the reason it was banned it because of it&#39;s negative impact on the environment. For example, they dumped a whole s***load of DDT in the LA harbor, which was a really smart move since DDT just happens to be toxic to fish. Lets just say that the fish continue to be poisoned...<br /><br />I guess what I&#39;m thinking is that I hope for your sake, Enigmacat, that there is way to use DDT to kill the bugs without negatively impacting on the environment at large (birds and fish in particular since they&#39;re the ones DDT is toxic to)

				Even as some people are arguing to bring back DDT to battle mosquitos, others are arguing that in regions where they have been using DDT, the mosquitos developed resistance to DDT...<br /><br />As for urban use, all it takes is a couple thousand households using what they thought to be safe trace amounts to add up to a large amount running down the drain towards, for example, the already polluted Hudson River.

				Hi,<br />Las December I moved out of my apartment on 42nd and 34th Ave due to an infestation in my entire apartment building.&nbsp; We had to throw away our bed, 2 couches, chairs, basically anything that couldn&#39;t be washed and dryed in extreme heat.&nbsp; I contacted my landlords multiple times, but they only kept sending the cockroach guy who was using chemicals that wouln&#39;t kill them. We ended up waiting out our lease (probably 6 months of bedbug hell) and then moving when it expired. When we moved we washed everything and stored what we weren&#39;t going to use in Space Bags and kept out a couple of things, then the DAY we moved into the new place I paid a bedbug specialist to come and spray the new apartment, the boxes that we had moved, everything. He did a great job and i havne&#39;t had a problem with bugs since we&#39;ve lived in the new place (almost a year).&nbsp; I still wake up having nightmares that they&#39;re crawling on me and itching.&nbsp; I still have scars where they bit me on my legs and ankles.&nbsp; It was a nightmare and I wouldn&#39;t wish it on my most hated enemy.&nbsp; If you&#39;re looking for a great exterminator I can give you this guys&#39; name.

				If you are just worried about *getting* bedbugs but have seen no signs, I would recommend dusting any nooks and crannies with DE (I have a 10-pound bag, just bring over a jar and I&#39;ll give you plenty), and caulking thoroughly. <br /><br />The exterminator can tell you whether or not you have them now, but caulking can help prevent the problem. <br />

				http://www.sterifab.com/bro.pdf<br /><br />their product brochure claims that it kills up to 24 hours after spraying.

				Daisy are they the little tiny ones? If so you might want to check if there is a leak anywhere. Those types of ants are sometimes a result of a leak or water damage. We have had them as well.

				I thought I&#039;d resurrect this thread because I now am dealing with a new apartment with totally new bugs. Or old bugs, I guess, but new to me.

AND THEN THEIR ROACH COMRADES WILL EAT THEM, AND THEY WILL ALSO DIE. I WILL LEAVE THIS DEAD ONE LYING IN THE CABINET SO THAT ANOTHER ROACH WILL STOP BY AND EAT IT AND THEREFORE EAT THE POISON THAT KILLED IT, AND THEN IT WILL DIE.

				Oh Essen, I feel for you.&nbsp; Is there any way you can caulk up all the holes in your apartment?&nbsp; I used to get way more bugs, but after I spent time caulking every single hole and crevice in the walls and cabinets throughout the kitchen, and bathroom and even other rooms, I don&#039;t see them nearly as much anymore.&nbsp; I also bought that spray foam and plugged up the holes around the radiators and other pipes in the apartment.&nbsp; Any hole they could crawl up was plugged as much as possible.&nbsp; I also left bay leaves everywhere. <br /><br />Last resort - get a cat.&nbsp; They don&#039;t seem to like cats.&nbsp; Good luck.

				Well, the good thing is that (up until yesterday anyway) I&#039;m not seeing all that many of them. I saw a few freshly dead ones a couple days after I moved in, when I went to load my dishes into the cabinets - and I freaked out appropriately - but then an exterminator came out and put his stuff down and since then I&#039;ve only seen one every few days. Except for today and yesterday, when I&#039;ve seen at least two (one being the dead one referred to in the previous post) as well as a new egg. What concerns me most is the fact that the &quot;roach dirt&quot; is <em>everywhere</em>, in every cabinet in the kitchen as well as the bathroom vanity. It was in crevices of the old oven that has since been replaced, dead roaches in the broiler drawer, so disgusting. I have no way of knowing how long it took to get that bad, if that&#039;s the result of years of untreated roach infestation or if that stuff builds up really quickly. All I know is it was all there before I moved in, but I didn&#039;t know enough to look in the cabinets with a flashlight before taking this place. Everything looked nice and clean at first glance.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-(<br /><br />We caulked up some obvious cracks where they were getting into the bathroom and I got the spray foam too, but unfortunately I think their main point of entry is in the kitchen through an inaccessible wall area behind the counter. The landlord insists there are no holes in the wall over there, and that the roaches are just living in that counter unit from the previous tenants, but the roaches keep emerging from the same place. It seems there&#039;s a new wave of them now, after the landlord and exterminator both assured me I wouldn&#039;t be seeing anymore of them. <br /><br />The bay leaf thing is interesting and I&#039;ll definitely try that. Some serious roach cleaning still needs to be done here, after which I&#039;ll adjust my methods. I do want to get a cat eventually, not even because of the roaches, but that will be a plus also.

				Declare war.&nbsp; Take a few weekends and clean your entire kitchen and bathroom out and disinfect the s___ out of it.&nbsp; Then caulk every slip and crevice in the entire cabinet, along the counters next to the wall, even down on the floor where it meets the wall.&nbsp; Basically run the caulk gun along all the edges in and outside the cabinets and smooth it in there real tight.&nbsp; Get spray foam and foam up the cracks near the pipes under the sink and around radiators.&nbsp; Then take paper and tape over any big ass holes that you can&#039;t caulk or foam.&nbsp; Put combats in the cabinets, and brush borac acid into the floor along the walls.&nbsp; Clean your kitchenware and put it back in the cabinets when done.&nbsp; &nbsp;Drop bay leaves throughout the cabinets.&nbsp; Let the exterminator in every time he visits.&nbsp; Then get a cat and let it roam free to kill anything in its path.&nbsp; Wash your dishes every night and bag up your food in plastic baggies and containers.&nbsp; Keep the kitchen free of crumbs and don&#039;t leave food lying about.<br /><br />This process takes awhile but it&#039;s so worth it.&nbsp;

Also, you need to completely clean all droppings that have accumulated. Not only is it food for roaches, but the chemical trail lets other roaches know this is a hospitable environment. <br />I love cats and kittens, but I would not get one while I have roaches. They are of no help for German roaches (they do love to kill the big American ones), and the water you leave out for the cat will be a very welcome treat for the roaches.

				Yeah, I&#039;ve given up even trying to eliminate water sources, aside from closing up the drains at night. If they are coming from the walls, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever be able to stop them from coming in without the entire kitchen counter/cabinet being pulled out, which doesn&#039;t seem to be an option at this point. So I&#039;m just using the &quot;tasty poison&quot; method and trying not to leave any non-poisonous food out for them to eat. If I were to get a cat, I&#039;d try put its food and water up on a sort of stand that I could possibly roach-proof via some sort of oily slipperiness. But that&#039;s a later project.

				When I was pregnant with my daughter we moved into this apartment in Brooklyn that was in an AMAZING area for super cheap. When we moved in we had a ton of roaches literally falling out of the cabinets. It was horrible and disgusting but with diligence we got rid of them or at least kept them out of our unit. <br /><br />We made sure EVERY crevice was cleaned in the kitchen. Under the stove top, under the oven. We swept and mopped everything. We cleaned out all of the cabinets and laid down contact paper. We also lined the cabinets with roach traps and beneath the stove and oven with Boric Acid.&nbsp; The trash went out EVERY night. There was NEVER food left out. We also immediately wiped down the area behind the sink where water accumulates. Dishes that were washed were immediately dried before being put away. <br /><br />There were areas where we knew they were coming in and we had those areas caulked off. If its behind your counters line under your sink along the rim with boric acid. Just make sure pets dont get in there. <br /><br />We had roach traps EVERYWHERE for a while. But it worked. Especially if you have a bug person come in regularly for a while they will go away. <br /><br />Good luck!

				Well, I&#039;m hesitant to jump to any conclusions because I&#039;ll go for a week or two without seeing any and then see two in the same night, but I seem to have defeated them in the kitchen and bathroom. We (me and some cleaning people) cleaned the hell out of the kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanity, where the main infestations were and where I think they were coming in from the wall also. After it was clean I applied copious amounts of boric acid in the unreachable areas they were emerging from. I also got those little plastic outlet covers and plugged up all the open outlets in the kitchen and bathroom. This apartment is chock full of outlets, which is cool until you have roaches that like to live in them. I have not seen any evidence of roaches in the kitchen or bathroom since this cleaning, which was done in mid-February.<br /><br />Then it was all good and I felt pretty good about stuff, until a couple weeks later when I started seeing them in the goddamn coat closet in the living room. Like, one was walking on my coat. I despised it and caused it to die. I found a bunch of cracks and crevices in there and broke out my trusty can of expanding foam, so I closed up everything I could see that they might be coming in through and put a couple little Combat baits in there. Haven&#039;t seen any since, but I saw what I think was a tiny baby one climbing up my front door a few days ago. I have not seen any eggs, so I don&#039;t know where that came from. <br /><br />So.... there it is!

				Oh, and I don&#039;t know if this has actually done anything, but I read that roaches don&#039;t like the smell of cloves. So after I cook particularly strong smelling meals, I&#039;ve been putting a few whole cloves in a pot of water on the stove and boiling it for a couple minutes, leaving it to sit there overnight after that. I personally like the smell, and the added humidity is nice in the cold weather. I have not seen any roaches emerge during clove time and would be interested in hearing if this works for anyone with a more consistent roach problem.

I have not seen any evidence of roaches in the kitchen or bathroom since this cleaning, which was done in mid-February.<br /><br />Then it was all good and I felt pretty good about stuff, until a couple weeks later when I started seeing them in the goddamn coat closet in the living room. Like, one was walking on my coat. I despised it and caused it to die. I found a bunch of cracks and crevices in there and broke out my trusty can of expanding foam, so I closed up everything I could see that they might be coming in through and put a couple little Combat baits in there. Haven&#039;t seen any since, but I saw what I think was a tiny baby one climbing up my front door a few days ago. I have not seen any eggs, so I don&#039;t know where that came from. <br /><br />So.... there it is!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />The only way to get rid of them is foam and caulk.&nbsp; Boric acid and sprays is just a temporary solution.&nbsp; The pesticides only help with what is already in your home.&nbsp; I&#039;m going about 4 years without seeing so much as a spider in my apt.&nbsp; &nbsp;Construction in my apt brought them out.

I was not able to convince him to do that, and believe me, I tried. So, boric acid and poison bait are what they will get, along with my foam stuff where I can manage to use it. While I&#039;d rather not see any of them ever again, seeing a stray one wander about every few weeks is a lot better than what was going on when I moved into this place. I imagine the previous tenants decided to leave a plate of hamburgers and a birthday cake out on the counter while they went on vacation.

				I&#039;m glad to hear the problem has gotten better, Essen.&nbsp; I had some bigger holes and actually put xerox paper over top them and sealed that off with tape.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s possible for you to do.&nbsp; I used to do just the boric acid and combats and the only time I managed to get rid of the roaches was when I went nuts caulking and sealing.&nbsp; The difference was amazing.&nbsp; I credit Enigmacat and other Astorians with teaching me the caulking trick.&nbsp; I still see roaches from time to time but nothing like it was.
