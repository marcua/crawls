				This is a remarkably outdated post, but the subject line is on point for me, so here goes...<br /><br />I have a friendly, energetic, female (spayed) Pit mix, about 1 1/2 yrs old., who craves dog play mates. We live near Steinway/Broadway crossroads but would happily come to Astoria Park for a pooch play date.<br /><br />Any dogs in need of some romping?

				Well, if you get up early enough, you could come to Astoria Park and join the rest of us dog owners+dogs for the off-leash time, which starts anytime in the morning until 9a.m. Usually most of us congregate on the &quot;Great Lawn&quot;, as some call it.

				Off-leash time?&nbsp; I didn&#039;t know about that!&nbsp; Is that 7 days a week?&nbsp; Is the area fenced in?<br />Can&#039;t offer myself or my mutt as a play date (yet) as we haven&#039;t moved to NYC yet, but look for us later this summer...

				Yes, it&#039;s 7 days a week. No, it&#039;s not fenced in since it is in the middle of the park. Here is a link to the NYC Parks off leash laws.http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_things_to_do/facilities/af_dog_runs.html#queens (http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_things_to_do/facilities/af_dog_runs.html#queens)<br /><br />&nbsp;Anyway, hopefully you have a place to live set up already, in any event Welcome to Astoria!

				My sweet pooch and I are not quite ready for off-leash time (we&#039;re looking for some dog training now) but when we are Grrly looks forward to meeting Bentley, his dad and the rest of the early morning pack.

				My Murphy (9 1/2 month old Lab mix) isn&#039;t ready for off-leash either.&nbsp; We went to the park on Memorial Day and had to watch the off-leashers from the sidelines. :-(&nbsp; <br /><br />I work every day so I can&#039;t bring him in the mornings, but my partner and I plan to be at the park with Murphy on Saturdays, and I am also going to bring him next Friday morning, June 6, to work on some recall so we can be off-leash soon!<br />

You cannot do that in the park. Minimally, he should know sit, down, stay, come and stop. He should know that he has to keep you in sight at all times. Off-leash hours are a privilege that require a responsible owner and a well-trained, well-behaved doggie. If any of those requirements are missing, it may prove to be a disaster waiting to happen. Not all dogs are meant to be off-leash. You and your dog must know what to do, how to react or how to respond to another dog who approaches menacingly. Please enjoy yourself, but be safe and encourage your dog to obey the rules for his own safety. <br /><br />I have 2 small dogs who do very well off-leash. In fact, one of them hates the leash. But, in the park, they stay leashed. That way I can control any situation with a BIG dog that tries to bully either of them. AND THERE ARE A FEW BULLY DOGS AND OWNERS DURING OFF-LEASH HOURS.

				Thanks for the advice. I would say that Murphy is at kindergarden level at pretty much all of those &quot;skills&quot; (great indoors, only okay outdoors).&nbsp; I plan on keeping him at a long tether and tied to me at all times when we&#039;re at the park.&nbsp; He doesn&#039;t get to be off-leash for at least several months!&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />

I usually don&#039;t wait to find out how bright a dog is before I get right into NILIF. I start a few days after I bring them home. I tether the puppy to me and we go from there.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The NILIF program is remarkable because it&#039;s effective for such a wide variety of problems. A shy, timid dog becomes more relaxed knowing that he has nothing to worry about, his owner is in charge of all things. A dog that&#039;s pushing too hard to become &quot;top dog&quot; learns that the position is not available and that his life is far more enjoyable without the title.<br /><br />It is equally successful with dogs that fall anywhere between those two extremes. The program is not difficult to put into effect and it&#039;s not time consuming if the dog already knows a few basic obedience commands. I&#039;ve never seen this technique fail to bring about a positive change in behavior, however, the change can be more profound in some dogs than others. Most owners use this program in conjunction with other behavior modification techniques such as coping with fear or treatment for aggression. It is a perfectly suitable technique for the dog with no major behavior problems that just needs some fine tuning.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Search for NILIF on Google and see how well it works. You have to be totally consistent, though. If you do decide to try it, feel free to ask any questions. Although NILIF has only been around since the early 1990s, the basic program is what most Police Departments and the US Army had been using for decades.

				I already do clicker training with Murphy and that site you linked does seem to have the same principles I&#039;m trying to implement with Murphy.&nbsp; Thanks for the info!&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken him to the obedience classes at Astoria Park on Saturdays, but I&#039;m not 100% keen on their methods.&nbsp; I may or may not bring him back.

I don&#039;t go at regular times, but you can&#039;t miss my furballs. If they are off-leash (and I rarely allow it), they are tethered together by a 6 foot lead, and not more than 30 feet away from me. That is how they were trained; they will not approach another dog unless (or until) I give them the okay and they will return to my side immediately if one of them feels unsafe for any reason or I call them to come. One is all black and the other is all white. AND YOU DAMNED WELL KNOW WHO THOSE BULLIES ARE! Their owners are really no better!

				I will reiterate that Grrly and I would love to have play dates but we are also very happy to meet to practice behaving with other dogs. Sharing information, skills and liver treats?<br /><br />I am practicing in the house with &quot;come&quot; - we&#039;ve already mastered &quot;sit,&quot; &quot;paw,&quot; &quot;make it,&quot; and &quot;let&#039;s go.&quot; But &quot;come&quot; is not coming easy, even with favorite treats! And for me it is the most important of the commands.<br /><br />I would love to meet up for informal romping and training.

They are not very important, and you can always come back to them at a later date. For right now, Grrly, needs to excel at the basics: sit, stay, come, release and stop. For sit, stay and release use one type of reward treat; for come another and for stop yet another. Remember that the treat does NOT have to be food. It can just be the smell of a food product. And you cannot use it all the time or the dog will never work without it. Your objective is to get your dog to do what you want her to do, when you tell her to do something, and be extremely grateful for a pat on the head and a high-pitched &quot;whatta good doggie.&quot; If you are having trouble with the &quot;come&quot; stop using the word, and try using only a hand signal. As soon as Grrly responds, put her into a sit, and then give the reward. Most dogs really want to please their owners, so show her who the boss is and take the stress off her by not allowing her to dominant over you. If she doesn&#039;t respond to a word more than twice in a row, go over to her and physically help her. One other thing that might help you when you work her in the house . . . keep her on a 16&#039; training lead. Use the lead to get her attention and also to prevent her from ignoring you. Are you using a clicker?
