			Hey jbh,<br /><br />That&#039;s pretty great to have a list of coupons that match up with sales, but last time I tried using coupons printed from the internet at the Key Food on 31st @ Ditmars, they wouldn&#039;t take them.&nbsp; Has that changed or do you go to a different Key Food?

It just seems too good to be true. Has anyone signed up for an account? I don&#039;t want to get a lot of spam and tons of unwanted e-mails. <br /><br /><br />--- End quote ---<br /><br />I have! It&#039;s not shady at all. I get email updates when new coupons have been added or when a popular coupon has been relisted and that&#039;s it. I haven&#039;t noticed any additional spam types emails in the 6 months or so that I&#039;ve been on there.

They no longer get my business for any but highly discounted items.

			I recently picked up couponing for whatever I can save on. I found the CVS has the most valuable sales by using coupons and their in store sales every week. I would like to start a thread about how I and others save money by shopping at CVS. <br />In the past two weeks, I&#039;ve used $42.43 in cash (including tax) to get $186.82 worth of stuff from CVS. CVS is well known for it&#039;s overprice items but even cut the total price in half, I still did pretty well in saving. <br />I used to only print out coupons online but now I also buy one or two newspapers on Sunday and occasionally buy coupons from some website to save more. <br /><br />Here&#039;s the few sites that I use to print online coupons or get ideas of what upcoming sales/coupons in Sunday papers would be:<br /><br />www.simplycvsshopping.com<br />www.couponmom.com<br />www.coupons.com<br />www.smartsource.com<br />www.redplum.com<br />www.neutrogena.com<br />www.loreal.com<br /><br />I would love to have weekly transactions post up here to help whoever needs to save a few bucks. I also would like to know how other people save on groceries and other items. Time is tough and we need to spend less to get more&nbsp; :wink: .<br />
