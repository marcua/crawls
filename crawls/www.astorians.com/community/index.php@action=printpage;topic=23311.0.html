				<br />Hello everyone!<br /><br />I am 29 y/o and I live in Greece. I would like you to give me some information about the labor market in NY.<br /><br />I know that the economy is not so good. Furthermore, I was told that it is very difficult for a non-american to take government permission to live and work there. I admit, this highly disappointed me. However, the situation here in Greece is really awful and I do not want to spend my time living in insecurity and waiting for economy recovery. Therefore, I try to be courageous and take the significant decision to leave. Yes, immigration to a EU country is much more easier because there no requirements and bureaucracy. But since Europe faces a really dangerous crisis, USA is an important option.<br />------------------------------------------<br /><strong>My qualifications</strong><br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Bachelor degree:</span> Accounting<br /><span class="bbc_u">Master</span>: MBA (2013 expected)<br /><span class="bbc_u">Languages</span>: Greek, English ( in listening I am good, but in speaking I am not so good since I do not have the chances to speak english here)<br /><span class="bbc_u">Certifications</span>: MS Office and 2 Accounting software programs<br /><span class="bbc_u">Experience</span>: 3 years in Retail Sales Glassware store (but it is a family business. Does it count as a disadvantage in my CV?)<br /><br />My objective is to work in business field and to be hired by a company. But, I realise that an immigrant has to compromise and does not have so many choices, at least in the beginning. <br /><br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">So, what is your opinion? Do you think I could be hired or it would take me a lot of time to achieve it?</span><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />P.S. 1 I do not have any relatives there. There are just some Greeks I already know, that live in Miami, others in NY and others in Toronto (&lt;--- I know, it&#039;s not USA, I just wrote it&nbsp; ) . So, what do you think about my possible attempt to immigrate to US? Agree or disagree and why?<br /><br />P.S. 2 What bureaucratic requirements for a successful immigration do you know?<br />

				With all due respect, I would say to stay and fight it out as much as possible.&nbsp; The only guaranteed way that Greece will not go forward is if all of its young minds leave.&nbsp; (I&#039;m Greek, spend a substantial amount of time in the country each year...no, not for &quot;vacation&quot;, so I am aware of the situation there).<br /><br /><br />Besides, things really anre *not* much better here, as evidenced by the large number of young college graduates, some with advanced degrees, who I personally know and who are living at home, or working menial jobs in retail or at supermarkets, or who have been laid off repeatedly over the past few years.<br /><br /><br />Just as there is insecurity in Greece, there is insecurity here too.&nbsp; Homelessness is up, petty crimes such as burglaries are up, millions of homes have been foreclosed upon nationwide, there is an ongoing protest movement in the country (which is more long-lasting than the one in Greece) and young people in particular are having difficulty finding work: [size=78%]http://news.yahoo.com/1-2-graduates-jobless-underemployed-140300522.html (http://news.yahoo.com/1-2-graduates-jobless-underemployed-140300522.html)[/size].<br /><br /><br />Then there&#039;s the pragmatic aspect: the cost of living in New York City is quite high, and if you don&#039;t have a steady job, especially at the beginning, it&#039;ll be very easy to go under.<br /><br /><br />Unfortunately, things are challenging everywhere and won&#039;t necessarily be improving anytime soon (though I hope I&#039;m wrong!).&nbsp; Whatever you end up doing, I wish you the best of luck, from one Greek to another!

				Why would you want a government position?<br /><br />You will need to be more specific with your experience, it is VERY competitive here with many applicants. You will be one applicant out of MANY and have the language barrier, and no citizenship.<br /><br />You can try other ways to obtain your citizenship. Marriage a possibility?<br /><br /><br />Right now it is very difficult because (I could be wrong) current immigration policies are not European friendly. I&#039;ve had this conversation with several folks, and there also seems to be a &quot;need&quot; for skills that are rare. So from what I have discussed, you have to posses some kind of unique skill set.<br /><br />Here are some immigration statistics from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_States (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_States) :<br /><br /><br />Top Ten Foreign Countries â€“ Foreign Born Population Among U.S. Immigrants <div style="text-align: right;"><table class="bbc_table"><tr><td> Country[/r][/t] per year 2000 2004 2010 2010, %&nbsp; <table class="bbc_table"><tr><td>Mexico</td><td>175,900</td><td>7,841,000</td><td>8,544,600</td><td>9,600,000</td><td>23.7%</td></tr><tr><td>China</td><td>50,900</td><td>1,391,000</td><td>1,594,600</td><td>1,900,000</td><td>4.7%</td></tr><tr><td>Philippines</td><td>47,800</td><td>1,222,000</td><td>1,413,200</td><td>1,700,000</td><td>4.2%</td></tr><tr><td>India</td><td>59,300</td><td>1,007,000</td><td>1,244,200</td><td>1,610,000</td><td>4.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Vietnam</td><td>33,700</td><td>863,000</td><td>997,800</td><td>1,200,000</td><td>3.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Cuba</td><td>14,800</td><td>952,000</td><td>1,011,200</td><td>1,100,000</td><td>2.7%</td></tr><tr><td>El Salvador</td><td>33,500</td><td>765,000</td><td>899,000</td><td>1,100,000</td><td>2.7%</td></tr><tr><td>Dominican Republic</td><td>24,900</td><td>692,000</td><td>791,600</td><td>941,000</td><td>2.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Canada</td><td>24,200</td><td>678,000</td><td>774,800</td><td>920,000</td><td>2.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Korea</td><td>17,900</td><td>701,000</td><td>772,600</td><td>880,000</td><td>2.2%</td></tr><tr><td> Total Pop.
