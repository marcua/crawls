				I passed by Cafe Bene on Ditmars yesterday and see that they will be opening today.&nbsp; It looks like an interesting place.&nbsp; They had some of food that they serve in the window for display.&nbsp; They have interesting looking waffles.&nbsp; The inside looks like a nice atmosphere. I think they will do good business.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to check it out

For starters, I imagine Caffe Bene &quot;food&quot; to be mass produced whereas OK Café items are produced by local folks. I&#039;ve also seen a lot of reviews that says service isn&#039;t up to standards at many of Caffe Bene&#039;s 1,500+ locations and that everything is overpriced. While I may stop in to check it out for myself, I just can&#039;t help but to prefer a small business over a large company or franchise. This simply seems to be an alternative to Starbucks. Need a great atmosphere and more space to sit? Try 60 Beans. They have a great (LOCAL!) thing going as well.

I will likely try Caffe Bene just to see what the waffle craze is about, and I certainly agree that it&#039;s smart to have on the run or dine in food options past sweets. That said, unless their coffee is far superior to the small places (I have to doubt that) I&#039;ll stick with the locals for my coffee splurges.&nbsp;

				Cafe Bene in Times Square is always jam packed especially with tourists. When i used to work there I had the customer loyalty card and would get a free coffee after 10 purchases. I like their coffee although their prices for the tiny pastries are a little outrageous. I wonder if the Astoria Bene will be a little cheaper overall. Now 60 Beans I tried going at night but by 11 they are closed and I usually wind up at Martha&#039;s Bakery lol Would be nice if 60 beans would stay open late.

				whatever floats your boat sam?&nbsp; Perhap I should say whatever strikes your fancy?&nbsp; i don&#039;t know what type of coffee that you like to drink.&nbsp; &nbsp;Different strokes, ya know?<br /><br />a large cup of regular coffee is 2.99 at the chelsea location of Caffe Bene.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t eat any of the sweets so i cannot speak for them. <br /><br />For comparison&#039;s sake...Martha&#039;s across the street charges 3.75 for a slice of cheesecake.&nbsp; Personally, I find Martha&#039;s disgusting but that is a separate thread.&nbsp; <br /><br />60 Beans and NYC Bagel House charge $3 for a doughnut (oh but they are from Dough in Brooklyn!?!?)<br /><br />so the $4 slice of cheesecake seems rather in line if you ask me.&nbsp; &nbsp;How much do you think it should be?<br /><br />I just find it funny when people bash a place when they haven&#039;t even tried it.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s a chain so it must be the devil!!!&nbsp; It is like when people leave Yelp reviews when they have not even been to a place.&nbsp; What is the point?

				I know at the few Bene&#039;s I&#039;ve been to in midtown, the fancy dipped waffles (not the plain ones) are roughly $4.95, so something seems off there.<br /><br /><br />Regardless, I noticed the Ditmars location has their Oatmeal Raisin cookies, which are to die for, and for some reason only found at a few locations.

				Stopped into the Steinway location last week. Mediocre latte and pre-packaged tasteless bear claw put me back almost 10 bucks. <br /><br /><br />And who&#039;s the brilliant architect that decided to put the POS directly in front of a column? <br /><br /><br /><br />Never again, especially when Love Cafe is right there, local, friendly and has better, cheaper coffee.

				The MOST delicious breakfast sandwich is at Cafe Bene - Eggs, ham, arugula, red onion and toasty bread - - the combo is simple but out of this world - - try it!&nbsp; And the free chargers for cell phones are cute too!&nbsp; And the packaging of everything - - all pale blue - - - my favorite color!&nbsp; Enjoy!
