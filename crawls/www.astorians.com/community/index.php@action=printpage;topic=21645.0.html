				I usually do not post reviews but based on the outstanding customer service I received at Astoria Apartments - located on 31st street btwn. Ditmars &amp; 21st Ave - I felt it was the honorable thing to share my experience!<br /><br />I just graduated college and was looking for a 2 bedroom with my roommate - something close to the train and in a quiet neighborhood.&nbsp; I specifically told Tasos Makedon, the realtor with whom I worked (and recommend!) that I did not want another college dorm and that I wanted to be near the Ditmars train station.&nbsp; Sure enough, he showed me a BEAUTIFUL, newly renovated apartment with the sweetest landlords, just a 5 minute walk from the Ditmars train.&nbsp; Unfortunately, my roommate was not able to view the apartment with me that first day and I knew an apartment this nice was going to go quickly.&nbsp; Luckily, Taso was able to hold that apartment for me with just a small sum deposit I put down.&nbsp; As soon as my roommate was able to come and view the place, we signed!<br /><br />Too good to be true, right??&nbsp; The first day of apartment hunting I find EXACTLY what I was looking for?&nbsp; Well - it gets better.&nbsp; Taso has continued to work with me - AFTER we have paid the security, his fee &amp; signed the lease.&nbsp; Any other realtor would be done with until it was time to give you the keys.&nbsp; This is especially true because I know I bothered Taso every other day prior to coming down and viewing an apartment (I like to call it persistence!).&nbsp; He keeps me updated daily as to the progress of the renovations in our apartment and has served as an integral communication link between the landlord and me.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would HIGHLY recommend going to see Taso over at Astoria Apartments.&nbsp; His office gets the best inventory of apartments and ALL of the agents truly go above and beyond for their clients!!!&nbsp; Just ask him about the 4 girls &amp; the ladder story!!

				This... &#039;person&#039; posted the exact same thing on Yelp.<br /><br />http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=PzO6eanFTVodfTS-FYiRGQ<br /><br />It&#039;s their only yelp posting too.<br /><br />Hmmmmmmmm...&nbsp; very interesting.&nbsp; *raises eyebrow*

				Well looks like you are a good researcher!! I DID post the same thing on yelp...after all it is my own writing I think I have every right to &quot;copy &amp; paste&quot; to another website. I believe credit should be given where credit is due and I make it a point to go out of my way for someone when they have treated me well.&nbsp; No need to raise any eyebrows, my friend.<br /><br />And my reason for making the point about not living in a dorm was because this was the first time I had ever dealt with a realtor.&nbsp; As I mentioned in my post I just graduated college and have never been apartment searching.&nbsp; I was merely acting on preconceived notions which were luckily eradicated. <br />&nbsp;<br />I&#039;m looking forward to moving to Astoria despite you rude, skeptics out there!<br /><br />Stay classy.

				One of the many of&nbsp; Taso&#039;s relatives/friends posting again.&nbsp; It is amazing how so many 1 or 2 post&nbsp; people come here singing Taso&#039;s praises.&nbsp; The people on this board are pretty savvy and most of us are skeptical of posts like this.

				Yeah, I want to ask for recommendations for brokers but I think I&#039;ll demand a post-minimum before I take any advice.&nbsp; <br /><br />Not to say that&#039;s true or not true of you, Aimprescia, and I&#039;m glad you found the apartment you wanted.&nbsp; It&#039;s just that when a person&#039;s first and only post is a rave, it tends to raise eyebrows.&nbsp;

				Aimprescia, do a search on this board for &quot;Taso&quot; and you will understand the skepticism.

				whether this is the broker or a satisfied customer, it just makes me very uncomfortable that &quot;the&quot; is in quotation marks.
