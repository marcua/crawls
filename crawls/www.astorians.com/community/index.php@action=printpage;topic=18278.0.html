				[quoteForgive me if I took this a little personally.][/quote]<br />I am glad that you take this personally. When I differentiated teachers from the union I did it with purpose. You can tell the world how much you care about &quot;the children&quot;, but the organization you belong to use children as a human shield for a bargaining chip. Why do you care if the city spends Xmillion dollars on recruitment? Is the UFT now the forefront of fiscal conservatism?<br />I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s because you don&#039;t want to compete for your job. <br />But if the city of New York can find a better K-2 Science teacher for less money than they should hire him/her. That&#039;s what every else does. Why are government employees different?<br /><br />[quoteI am a big fan of UFT myself.&nbsp; They work hard to keep quality teachers and make our educational system better.][/quote]<br /><br />No they don&#039;t. They have the same job as any union. Protect the members and increase the rolls.

				I don&#039;t understand why a teacher caring about his job and caring about his children have to be mutually exclusive.<br />Do you think it&#039;s possible that someone could want to keep his/her job with fair treatment and decent wages while also caring about the children that said job affects?<br />I respect teachers and what they do- I don&#039;t recall (in my experience) ever seeing a teacher just kicking his/her feet up riding on union laziness and putting out as little work as possible for the kids. Most teachers I&#039;ve seen make crap pay for a hard and very respectable job.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=18278.msg195635.html#msg195635">Quote from: Sweeper on May 18, 2010, 11:02:33 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">But if the city of New York can find a better K-2 Science teacher for less money than they should hire him/her.

The problem is when there are severe budget cuts, do you think that the hiring personnel will be more concerned about who will do the job for the least amount of money or about who will put out the best quality of work?<br /><br />I know unions of all kinds have their problems, but they exist for a reason. They are not machines to ensure that people put out the least amount of work for the most money- they exist so that employees across the board don&#039;t get screwed over by the higher-ups. <br />

				If you had to balance the budget.....who would you cut first? The teacher making 90,000 or the teacher making 45,000? CompUSA took the 90,000 route and lost all it&#039;s experienced employees and no longer exists.

				Right.&nbsp; Hiring the cheaper teacher would give little incentive for anyone to become a teacher.&nbsp; If with time you&#039;re going to be replaced with a younger, cheaper version or if you&#039;re going to have to agree to a lower salary to keep your job, why would you take on a hard job?<br /><br />Plus, we&#039;re not putting out a &quot;product&quot; where it <em>might</em> make sense to hire the cheaper worker.&nbsp; This isn&#039;t a business.&nbsp; We are teaching children!&nbsp;

I&#039;ll leave the debate about whose interest the UFT represents to others though I do think they should do a better job of working with the City to remove incompetent teachers from the classroom.<br /><br />But if you feel the UFT isn&#039;t interested in children, can&#039;t the argument be made that neither does the City. What if they just want to hire someone cheaper, not better?<br /><br />No for-profit company ever hires someone cheaper because they are better or more qualified. I&#039;m sorry, it just doesn&#039;t happen.

				On a personal note - the reason that I am successful today is not because of high school or college - it is because of my Elementary School teachers and the services that schools provided when I was growing up in the 60&#039;s in Washington Heights.<br /><br />We learned how to read and write, how to calculate, how to dance, how to play, how to make things, how to perform, how to draw.&nbsp; What I learned was endless.&nbsp; Also, my parents could not afford to send us to camp in the summer and the schools were open for any child who needed a place to be while their parents worked.&nbsp; During the summer, it was all about arts, crafts and the performing arts.&nbsp; I had the luxury of a well balanced education funded by the city.&nbsp; <br /><br />Our teachers were motivated, dedicated individuals who were given the tools they needed to teach.<br /><br />This was before the cuts came and schools went downhill.<br />

I appreciate the first hand report.<br /><br />A few stories, good or bad.<br />In high school, I wanted to take a class. The teacher said they had run out of desk space. It was important to me, so I said I did not need a desk.<br />It all worked out and was a life changing experience.<br /><br />I heard from a NY HS teacher that unfortunately the majority of their students were not ready to learn at grade level. To make matters worse, there was pressure from the principal to promote the students regardless.<br /><br />My understanding is that class size is often times cost prohibitive and rarely directly affects learning. HS attendance and graduation rates are quite an issue. Class size most likely does have an effect on learning in lower elementary grades with a goal of 1 teacher for 20 students, but methodology and quality of teacher is most important.<br /><br />It is interesting that yesterday many voters supported modest increases in school budgets. On Debbie&#039;s points, I wonder how much has been lost with cuts in arts/music/health education.

Why fear them?&nbsp; I&#039;ve never been given the impression that charter schools are a scourge upon the earth.&nbsp; Are they generally corrupt or something?&nbsp; Can someone please enlighten me, because obviously I don&#039;t understand the full scope of the problem the union has with charter schools.&nbsp; Thanks in advance.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well, in the interest of fairness, I am not the one to give you the &quot;full scope.&quot;&nbsp; If you&#039;d like the union side of the argument, you&#039;d have to speak with someone in the union.&nbsp; But I can give you my understanding as someone who is not in the union and is openly in favor of charter schools.<br /><br />The short and cynical version as to why the UFT is against charters is that the teachers in charters are generally not affiliated with the union.&nbsp; Policy scholars who are in favor of charters argue that being free of the union is the whole point of the exercise.&nbsp; Charters should be free to have new and innovative rules and administrative procedures and should not be bound by union work rules, argue proponents of the charters.&nbsp; You will see this idea expressed in the work of scholars like Checker Finn and Marcus Winters (http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/winters.htm)<br /><br />The union waged a fierce battle to unionize certain charters (I believe one of the KIPP Academy schools) so now there ARE several charters run under the UFT rules.&nbsp; But again, many in support of charters argues this defeats the purpose.&nbsp; The union, for their part, claims that there are certain things that are unfair about the way charters are run.&nbsp; For example, they say that charters only get better educational outcomes from their students because they don&#039;t have to deal with as wide of a special needs population, or as many students learning english.&nbsp; They advocate that charters should have to accept such students:&nbsp; http://gothamschools.org/2010/01/04/uft-recommendations-add-fuel-to-the-charter-school-debate-fire/<br /><br />Of course, the cynic in me believes that this is a gambit by the union to lower the outcomes of charters (which are now, essentially, their competitors) or to agitate for unionization.&nbsp; Mulgrew, the head of the union claimed just yesterday that he is not holding back an increase in the number of charters: http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/05/ufts-mulgrew-were-not-blocking.html&nbsp; He alleges mismanagement by the charter schools, but was unable to produce few, if any examples.&nbsp; He also went back to the old chestnut that the charter schools can be for profit entities, and collect per pupil management fees, whereas he believes that money should go &quot;into the classroom&quot; as opposed to a for profit entity.&nbsp; My question to him is, if a for profit entity can do a better job why does it matter where their money goes?&nbsp; Unless you have a vested interest in preserving the union, that is.

				I&#039;m glad that this conversation expanded, because it is important.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">But if you feel the UFT isn&#039;t interested in children, can&#039;t the argument be made that neither does the City. What if they just want to hire someone cheaper, not better?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Certainly that argument can be made, and that&#039;s an excellent point. But who hires people to run the city? I would say that it is you and me. So who is the UFT negotiating with ultimately? Again, it is our responsibility to ensure that the most competent officials are running this great city. (I&#039;ll let the judgement on this stand)<br />Personally I&#039;m not interested in any public employee having a bad work environment. I know very well the value that positive management support can have. That being said, it is also important that labor issues are dealt with without emotion. More than once it has been said that education is not producing a product. I disagree. The product is the knowledge imparted to the next generation. Do it well and you should enjoy raises and job security. Suck at it and be fired. Every where we look this is the status quo and it works. But for some reason we look at public sector employees and feel that the laws of economics don&#039;t apply. This goes for police and firefighters too, by the way. Medical cost in the private sector go up, so companies make employees start to share the burden. In the public sector, the taxpayers pick up the burden. And the worst part about this: political hacks brag about union endorsements. Holy crap! They are actually telling you that they are going to suck when it comes to spending money that you have earned.

My contention is simply that the fighting for self-interest, in the case of the teachers, does not necessarily equate to being against the interests of the children they teach.<br />To be honest, I don&#039;t know every detail of what the UFT stance on every issue is. I do, however, know quite a few NYC teachers who are members of the union and from what I can gather, take a primary interest in the kids that they teach above their own. Frankly, I know that if they wanted a career where they got overpaid for the work they do- teaching certainly wasn&#039;t the choice profession for it. I believe that their vested interest with the UFT is a fair one.
