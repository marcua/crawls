				Someone tried to PM me, but apparently my inbox is full (it shows no indication of this when I look at my messages).&#160; My supporter subscription is not due yet for renewal; can merm or someone look into this?&#160; It&#039;s my understanding this is not supposed to happen.&#160; Thanks.<br /><br />(I know there&#039;s a thread around somewhere about full PM boxes, but I can&#039;t find it.)

				Thanks, mcw, for finding that.&nbsp; The issue is that as a supporting member, I&#039;m supposed to have unlimited space, but someone is getting a message that my inbox is full.&nbsp; Has the unlimited personal message space for supporters been modified?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=4489.msg45254.html#msg45254">Quote from: merm on December 29, 2006, 01:13:38 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Incidentally, anyone who is a supporter of the site gets unlimited personal message storage.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Can you try deleting the messages in your outbox (if you&#039;ve been saving them)?&nbsp; And yes, according to what I was able to find out, you should have unlimited space.&nbsp; But, let&#039;s see what happens.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve done a lot of deleting (not today) of both my inbox and outbox, and I&#039;d prefer not to delete anything else unless I know that&#039;s the only option (which would really be irksome in any event, because that&#039;s not &quot;unlimited&quot;).

				I had the exact same problem a couple of days ago. I deleted everything I felt comfortable doing. Too bad there also isn&#039;t some way of archiving some stuff. I got the message that my box was full the same way lanseaux . . . in a thread.

				Indeed as a supporter you are supposed to have an unlimited PM capacity. I&#039;m going to instate some really high limit and see if that fixes it.

				There was none it was set to &quot;unlimited&quot;. Now the limit is like 65,000 private messages. We&#039;ll see if that works better.

				I&#039;ve discovered this is a verified bug in the SMF software that will hopefully be addressed with the next update. I&#039;ve found a temporary fix however until they officially address the problem. My apologies to all the people who had trouble with this.
