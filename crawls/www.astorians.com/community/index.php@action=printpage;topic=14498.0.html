				Sorry for the late replay - just saw your post and i didn&#039;t get an email alerting me. My child has been there from just under one until present (she is 3). She loves it - has many friends there and loves the teachers. It&#039;s a small school which i wanted as she was young when she started. Any questions pls. don&#039;t hesitate to ask - if you want to send a private message pls. email me at baglover30@yahoo.com.<br /><br />bl30

				To my fellow moms,<br /><br />I can vouch for Bluebirdchildcare for your kids. My son is 4 months old and I am at ease with Joan watching him. I got an excellent vibe from her when I first met her. I get to watch my little one on the webcam. She does flashcards with him, she gives him needed belly time, she reads to him, she plays with him and I even see that she soothes him when he needs it.<br /><br />As a mom, I&#039;m always looking for other moms to get a reference from and to answer needed questions. If you want, you can reach me at 917-640-1434. Feel free. I know how difficult it is to leave your baby with someone unknown.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Elke
