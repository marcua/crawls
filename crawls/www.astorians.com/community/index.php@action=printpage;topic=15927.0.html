				This is floating around tumblr where a friend of mine reblogged it. She points out that it is better to call than email but an email is better than nothing. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This appeal is not just some BS request. I literally mean it. The Democrats are losing the health care debate right now. The Republicans and the insurance companies have stirred up lies and fear and are succeeding.<br /><br />The main issue centers around the idea of a “public option”, which would be a government owned and operated health insurance company. The reason for this is to create a company that will compete with existing insurance companies, forcing them to provide better care and lower their costs. Such an entity already exists for seniors, Medicare, and it works really well.<br /><br />Republicans are claiming that this entity will put private insurance companies out of business and will put the government in charge of health decisions -&nbsp; for example deciding whether someone gets a treatment or not. Currently, that happens to be how it is with all insurance companies, including Medicare.<br /><br />As for putting insurance companies out of business, the US government and state governments currently have organizations that compete with private industry. State universities have not put private universities out of business and have allowed many more people the opportunity to get an education. The U.S. Postal Service competes with FedEx and UPS.<br /><br />Right now, Republicans are trying to kill the public option. They claim that that is their only objective, that they would be open to health care reform if only the public option was removed. The truth is that their goal is to reject as much health care reform as possible because they want to hobble the president and win back seats in the Congress.<br /><br />You are not going to change the mind of any Republican representatives, which is okay, because health care reform can be passed without most of them onboard. Unfortunately, there are fiscally conservative Democrats and weak kneed Democrats who are resisting the public option. Many of these people are up for reelection next year.<br /><br />So, I’m begging all of you to please call your local representatives or state senator’s offices, and tell them not to back down and that you support the public option and believe that it is the only way that health care costs will be brought down, as there is currently no mechanism in the health care system to incentivize it to do so.<br /><br />Find your congressman using this website:<br /><br />whoismyrepresentative.com<br /><br />Please take a few minutes to call and briefly tell whoever answers that the public option is essential.<br /><br />And please, reblog this, don’t just “like” it.&nbsp; Thanks.[/url]</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I have a feeling that Astoria&#039;s Congresswoman....Rep Maloney, will be supporting what the House finally calls up. <br /><br />Maybe I should call her to get my name in the Health Care refomr column either way.

				Even if you&#039;re for health care reform, without a public option, there is no meaningful change. It appears Obama is more concerned about getting a bipartisan bill passed, regardless of the compromises, than reeling in the outrageous cost of health insurance companies and big pharma. My hope for real change is fading.

Obama is just trying to keep together &quot;at play&quot; democrats. And big pharma is no longer the boogie man. They have paid all the right people, so the goverment will now ensure that they get their profits from taxpayers. It&#039;s a lot easier to do business with just one customer.

				I am in favor of &quot;health care reform,&quot; but I have trouble trusting such a crapped up congress to come up with something good. Which brings me to this Onion article, which somehow gives me comfort. http://www.theonion.com/content/news/congress_deadlocked_over_how_to?utm_source=a-section<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;People should know that every day we are working without their best interests in mind,&quot; Reid said. &quot;But the goal here is not to push through some watered-down bill that only denies health care to a few Americans here and a few Americans there. The goal is to recognize that all Americans have a God-given right to proper medical attention and then make sure there&#039;s no chance in hell that ever happens.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Could Congress make health care worse than it is? Quite possibly.<br /><br />I find the note below interesting that voter intensity is very high on this issue as expected.<br /><br />http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/most-important-number/the-most-important-number-in-p-27.html<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Not surprisingly, those who believe their member should vote against health care reform are more likely to call it a major factor (82 percent) in their decision-making in the next election than those who want their member to back health reform (62 percent).</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				<br />As already mentioned, this issue is intense and the stakes are high.<br />It will be quite a feat and a push of political skill for a health bill to get through.<br /><br />If you dont know, Sunday, Sunday, Sunday Obama should be found on several tv shows pushing again on this.<br /><br />I cant keep track what proposed bill is considered White House backed. On first cursory look, the Baucus plan has some interesting proposals.<br /><br />One area that I would like to hear before anything goes through is how would this affect the self-employed.<br /><br />Should the NY House members and candidates for Senate consider themselves bullet proof on this issue?<br />It seems NYS is almost MASS blue now.
