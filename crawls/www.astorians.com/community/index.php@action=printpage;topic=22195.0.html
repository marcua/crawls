				I really enjoy where I live and I always try to be pleasant with my neighbors.<br />However, there is a person that always blocks my driveway, and after numerous requests to stop blocking my driveway, he always just shrugs it off like it&#039;s no big deal and ignores all my requests. I am sure that many people have this problem with their neighbors, but ever since the snow fall, the vehicle has just been more in the way of my driveway and I can&#039;t always be out there when he is parking.

				Unfortunately there is not much else you can do, imo you shouldn&#039;t even have to ask someone NOT to park in&nbsp; your driveway, but the fact that you&#039;ve even had to ask once and they did it again is enough to just tow the guy. Get the car ticketed, then call the tow company. <br /><br />Also cops might take forever to show up and ticket (or not show up at at all), so not sure if calling a local tow company might get the car ticketed quicker since they are dying to tow the car.

				Blocking a driveway isn&#039;t something that is normally ticketed for because it isn&#039;t illegal. They can only ticket or tow if someone complains about it. People who have driveways park there if they are multi car owners and it becomes almost private street parking. Best bet is to call 311 and ask what the procedure would be. Firstly- you didn&#039;t say if you have a sign posted. If not, then get one before you do anything. You might have to arrange with a Tow company that is registered to tow parking violators. Next time he parks there, leave a note that he will be towed the next time. Then arrange for the tow if he does.<br /><br /><br />You mention &#039;tension in the neighborhood&#039;, is he some neighborhood mob connected wanna be? If he blocks your driveway, he probably blocks others and never had anyone do anything about it, so he&#039;s not worried. Ask your neighbors about it- all it might take is one ticket or tow to stop. And then you would be the hero among the neighbors.

				This one is pretty easy .&nbsp; First you go out and put a note on the persons car saying next time around , he will get towed and to NOT BLOCK YOUR DRIVEWAY , you cant get in or out .&nbsp; &nbsp;Then if he shrugs , you shrug back and call 311 .&nbsp; 911 wont respond to blocked driveways since they arent emergencies . Get the plates , model number and car type .&nbsp; You should also take a pic of the part of his car that is actually in your driveway enterance .&nbsp; Thats your proof .Give them all the info and once they get that ticket call your local or nearest tow company and they will be there ASAP .&nbsp; &nbsp;They are dying to tow cars .&nbsp; All expenses will be paid by the person shrugging . You warned him , you told him nice , now its time to take the next step .&nbsp; I just towed someone last week cuz their entire rear end of their car was in the front of my driveway .&nbsp; The tow guy told me it would cost $300 dollars for them to get their car back ...plus the cops ticket .&nbsp; Ive probably towed abt 8 cars so far .&nbsp; Some people just dont learn not to block driveways so you gotta teach them the hardway .

				By driveway do you mean alleyway? There seems to be two problems here that need to be solved. The first one - someone is parking on your property, right? If that&#039;s the case tell them to move or leave a note that they&#039;ll be towed next time. If they don&#039;t stop you have a right to get them towed, like Thanos said. The other problem is - he is blocking the egress/easement. You or other neighbors most definitely can call 311- complain that a car is blocking the alley and you or they can&#039;t get through. An inspector will come out there-the same day. Hopefully the car will still be there when the DOB guy arrives. No one is allowed to block any of the residents&#039; right to pass through the alley in case of emergency, fire or otherwise either with cars, or fences or gates. And no homeowner can block the other residents&#039; right of way when they want to pass through by saying &quot;It&#039;s my property. Back up and go the other way!&quot; They cannot make an alleyway that&#039;s used communally by other property owners of the block to pass through their private parking space.

				This happens to us CONSTANTLY.&nbsp; In fact, my car is blocked right now.&nbsp; I&#039;ve asked nicely a bunch of times, but no one seems to care.&nbsp; There&#039;s been at least 3 times where we&#039;ve needed to get our car out and cannot.&nbsp; I stood in the street, honked the horn on my car... nothing.&nbsp; Once I called 311 and tried to get the cops to come to tow it, but they took about an hour and a half to get here and by that point the car was gone.<br /><br /><br />It&#039;s the same people every time, and I&#039;ve talked to them... they just don&#039;t care.&nbsp; One lady even brought us a gift basket on Christmas to thank us for &quot;letting her&quot; park in our driveway.&nbsp; We pointed out (again) that we don&#039;t, in fact, let her park in our driveway but it really didn&#039;t impact her.<br /><br /><br />So, in short - I have no idea how to modify or stop this behavior.

				I rent a parking spot in Astoria and it&#039;s down an alley/driveway that opens to 8 garages between blocks. The owners of the garage across from mine leave their car (or whoever needs a space when they have parties) in front of their door (shared driveway space) all the time and it makes it impossible to get my car into the garage space I rent. <br /><br />They&#039;ve also locked the gate access to the street closer to their place so every time this happens I have to walk around the entire block to bang on their door- ugg! I also run into problems where cars each block part of the driveway edges so I can barely squeeze my car in between them to get up into the alley/driveway- I have a smaller car too! It&#039;s so annoying!<br /><br />Is 311 the only number to call? Or do you have to call the cops to ticket the car first, and then call the tow truck? Anyone have a good tow truck number?

				It&#039;s nice that some people say , leave a note on the windshield first. I used to do that.<br />Then it escalated and more folks were parking in my driveway.<br />We put up a &quot;no parking &quot; sign.<br />Someone parked, totally blocking the driveway, took pictures, asked neighbors if they knew the owner, called 311, gave all info, police came, ticketed car, I called tow company, they were there within 10 minutes, towed car away. Later that evening, doorbell rings, irate woman asking me if I had her car towed. I said , yes, you were blocking my driveway and I couldn&#039;t get my car out. She was, of course, irate, and asked me why I didn&#039;t notify her her before I had the car ticketed and towed !? Duh.... why did you think you could park in my driveway?<br />It has now become actually a very fun game, notice car, take photos, call 311, car gets ticket , call my favorite tow guys, Boulevard towing 718-392-7676 or Kimberley Towing 718-710-3388, car gone, problem solved.

				Homeowners aren&#039;t allowed to block the alley. There&#039;s a document called &quot;Declaration of the Right of Way&quot; that should be attached to everyone&#039;s deed which restricts the owners from obstructing other owners and occupants of the block to their property, garages, parking spaces. You should call DOB, tell them your problem. Go to ACRIS website or the office in Kew Gardens to see if the Declaraton of Right of Way is attached to the deed-info is public access. And if a vehicle belonging to a resident of the block is constantly and for long periods of time blocking the alley -not just loading, unloading-you most definitely can call 311. It&#039;s a priority A complaint and someone will be sent out there that very day. Problem with that is that if the car isn&#039;t there when the inspector comes no violation can be issued. You should also talk to other residents of the block who I&#039;m sure are just as frustrated as you are. Maybe some community agitation is needed to resolve this problem. Too many self-entitled inconsiderate a-holes get away with it because they know they can.

				On the flip side, there are a bunch of blocks in astoria where the owners have made &quot;imaginary&quot; driveways in front of their houses by putting up a no parking sign even if there is no driveway cut or anything.&nbsp; I note the address and report them to 311.&nbsp; In a few weeks you&#039;ll see those no parking signs come right down.<br /><br /><br />These are houses that have some sort of front yard where people have removed the fence so they can park their cars there.

				There was a news article about this a while back.&nbsp; People were/are claiming driveways that don&#039;t have city approval.&nbsp; In general, I think the gist was that if there is no curb cut - it&#039;s not a legal driveway.

				A handfull of people on my block tried cutting their sidewalks to create curbs so that people wouldnt park infront of their house . Once one got reported they all got ticketed . I dont know the exact fine but they had to pay the ticket and fix the curb the way it was before .So they spent a good amount im sure .

				They do that crap with the cones in front of Tellys and Stamatis on 23rd ave . They block out spots on the street so they can get front parking for their customers or soon to be pulling up owner . I one time just pulled over and took the cone out of the way&nbsp; and pulled my car in . One valet guy was saying&quot;hey we have to make money too&quot; .&nbsp; I told him he can explain it to the cops if he wants and he just shut up real quick .&nbsp; They had the owners of those places on NY1 news cuz so many people complained abt this issue .

				It&#039;s been fenced off for a long time, but the no parking signs are new.&nbsp; At some point they also painted the curb yellow (there is no cut) but it&#039;s almost all worn off by now. <br /><br /><br />People park there anyway because they know it&#039;s bogus.<br /><br /><br />There usually is a van or truck of some sort parked in there though.&nbsp; Today it was a truck with CT plates.

The parking situation has caused an uproar from the residents.<br />The owner of Telly’s Taverna said she didn’t realize her valets were causing a nuisance.

				<br />Kathleen, if the other residents of the block are just as annoyed as you are perhaps you can get together and do something about it? There&#039;s strength in numbers: one of you can cut the lock, ring the selfish idiot&#039;s doorbell and hand it to him while someone else drives a bulldozer-that everyone chipped in for-and tears the damn gate down. Then have a block party and celebrate.<br />No seriously-you and your neighbors need to raise holy hell. You got nothing to lose. Make lots of phone calls, take pictures. You might try calling the FDNY: 718-999-2000, and they&#039;ll connect you to Field Public Communications Unit. They might be able to send an inspector out and possibly issue a violation. After all, what if someone&#039;s garage, or unfortunate car parked in the middle of the alley blocking the way catches fire, or there is a medical or other emergency which requires access to and from the street?&nbsp; Also call the DOB-Customer Service 718-286-0781 tell them your problem and they might connect you to Construction. That&#039;ll most likely be the supervisor of Construction who might or might not tell you to call 311. If you have to call 311 (you should do it anyway in addition to the other calls) give them the address of the person who put up the gate. They&#039;ll probably ask if a permit was issued for the construction of this gate. Say no. There&#039;s no way a permit would ever be issued for such a thing unless they lied about where they were going to put it-and that it&#039;s blocking the other residents&#039; from getting through-at this moment, right now. Call Vallone&#039;s office, call Community Board 1. Be a pain in the ass and don&#039;t give up!<br />Of course it would&#039;ve been less of a hassle to stop someone from putting up a gate in the alley before or during construction, but hopefully the person who paid to put up this gate will soon have to pay to take it down. Good luck and let us know how it all turns out.

				We place our recycling and garbage in the alley behind our homes for pick up. The residents prefer it this way because the streets and sidewalks stay clean and don&#039;t become an eye sore. However, when the alley is blocked the sanitation guys have to go through all kinds of contortions to pass through-they have to go around the block and enter backwards, or walk through the alley and pick up and carry the bags to the truck, or they have to honk REAL loud and continuously to get attention. Then the owners of cars that are blocking the alley come out of their homes all surprised like they didn&#039;t know the garbage men were coming that day. Meanwhile these people have lived here for over 20 years and this happens regularly. Sometimes the recycling guys get pissed if the car owners don&#039;t respond to the honking and get their asses out of the house to move their cars so they skip that stretch of alley, and the other residents along that stretch get pissed because their recycling isn&#039;t picked up. There are just 2 or 3 home owners on my block that are responsible for this crap, but they live right across the alley from each other, so the cars and SUV&#039;s are jam packed near the main entrance.

Cars though can get through , so the owner of the corner house put up a fence with a padlock cuz i guess too many people who didnt belong in that alley were passing thru. He gave keys to every single home owner on the block . One day a couple of months ago the fence was totally ripped off the hinges . Doesnt look like it was removed by a pro either . Looks like someone just used a blow torch or huge clippers . So far now its been like 6 months and a new one hasnt gone up yet .

				I wish the DSNY made little metal replicas of those trucks-like the Hess trucks. I&#039;d send them to my homesick relatives who live out west!<br /><br /><br />Or they could make a coin bank type where you throw your coins in the back and turn the crank-voila! the coins disappear. Just like living in NYC where we throw our money away daily because the cost of living is so high! <br /><br /><br />Sorry to go off topic, but when I read okkichan&#039;s post &quot;adorable little garbage truck&quot;&nbsp; my mind started spinning :cheesy:

				Thanks McKenna!&nbsp; They are adorable indeed! Those are about the only size that&#039;ll fit through our blockaded alley on Saturdays!<br /><br /><br />I like the lego type set too:<br /><br /><br />http://a856-citystore.nyc.gov/1/Gifts/2/NYPD-FDNY-DSNY/1656/DSNY-Construction-Blocks

				Oh I see.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t seen the mini sanitation trucks.&nbsp; If cars block the driveway they should get ticket just like cars do when they park on alternate sides during cleaning days.

				Hi.&nbsp; I&#039;m new to the site but have been living in Astoria since the late 90&#039;s.&nbsp; I just wanted to give you all a big thank you.&nbsp; there is this jerk in a Silver ford escape who keeps parking his truck on the entrance to the communal driveway on my block.&nbsp; After being at my wits end I ran a few searches and came across this site.&nbsp; I took your advice and after calling 311 and the 114th precinct, I&#039;m now waiting for the ticket so I can call the folks at Boulevard Towing or Kimberly Towing.&nbsp; Thanks all for your help.

				Check it out:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;https://www.facebook.com/blox.drvway.1<br /><br />If you live across a private establishment with high client traffic or city community center or daycare and the parents and/or employees of the establishment have blocked your driveway:<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;1. Take plates make and color of vehicle<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;2. File a complaint through http://www.nyc.gov/html/mail/html/mayor.html][url]http://www.nyc.gov/html/mail/html/mayor.html (http://[url)[/url] and give them dates and times those vehicles block. This office sends a notice to NYCHA and trickles down to the city community center/daycare. They end up having a parent meeting over it (but be prepared to file annually- new kids attending new parents dropping off.)<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;3. Even if it is just a regular person or neighbor i would still file a complaint with the mayor&#039;s email. The more you file the more a pattern is formed and the more folks like you and I have a chance of changing and having the law enforced.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;4. Write to dmv in albany about the law &quot;Parking or standing is not allowed: In front of a driveway.&quot; It is not sufficient and needs to be more detailed like: Parking or standing is not allowed: In front of a driveway and needs to be 5 feet away from the driveway on either side.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;If a hydrant can have a safety distance why can&#039;t a blocked driveway. There are some folks that park right up to the curb cut of a driveway and the vehicle owner can&#039;t open their car door without having to block traffic to do so in order to open their gate.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;5. Have the number of a good towing company that tows within 5 minutes usually. Call them as the officer is writing the ticket.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;6. Place a private reflective: No Parking in Driveway Violators will be towed at owner&#039;s expense sign.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;7. Request from DOT a No Parking anytime sign be placed on either side of a driveway. Forewarned they deny the first request. So you refile stressing the problem and your experiences and take pictures of you driveway and either side of it and of the infraction violators. Once the request is approved check on its placement. One person checked and DOT records showed that the sign was placed when it wasn&#039;t. The individual had to file with DOT and 311 a complaint and make a request for a replacement. Even when the sign was to be placed the city employee was unsure about placing it and was not going to.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;a. either sweet talk or calmly explain the problem and why the sign is being placed to convince the employee or<br />&nbsp;b. call DOT where you requested the sign and report the individual immediately or for afterhours 311 and the next day call DOT. Take his name or description, date, time, plate of vehicle s/he&#039;s driving file it with the complaint.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;8. Don&#039;t bother talking to folks about them blocking your driveway. They disrespect you by blocking, they might end up cussing you out as I&#039;ve seen. They will respect a ticket and tow more than you talking to them. You do not owe them anything. They owe you for blocking your driveway in the first place!<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Now a days no one knows the definition of respect. If you block a driveway you are disrespecting the owner then don&#039;t expect respect... expect a ticket and possibly a tow.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Get the number to your local precinct for nighttime service because through 311 the cops take longer in certain areas and boroughs. Get the number of traffic in your borough because they can come quicker in the daytime.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;If the cops give you problems, and some will, then file a complaint with all: the mayor&#039;s office email internal affairs and the civilian complaint board and 311.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;And you can always put them to shame by messaging me or by placing the info personally here! I do not give out my sources. I just list the vehicle info of the person who causes the infractions.<br />
