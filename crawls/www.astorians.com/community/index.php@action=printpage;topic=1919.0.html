				Aggh - I cooked too.&nbsp; A quick pasta sauce I saw on Chowhound today based on a Marcella Hazan recipe - an onion, peeled and halved, half a stick of butter, and one 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes, salt to taste.&nbsp; Throw it all in a pan and simmer for 45 minutes to an hour.&nbsp; I covered it for about 45 minutes and then simmered uncovered for about another half an hour, waiting for Jim to get home.&nbsp; Remove the onion before tossing with pasta and serving (I used penne).&nbsp; Right amount for two people - 8 oz. uncooked pasta.&nbsp; Man, that was <em>good</em>.&nbsp; And simple. <br /><br />Ah - you just posted as I was about to!&nbsp; Glad you had a good time.&nbsp; Must now find out about Wave.
