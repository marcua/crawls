As I understand it, they are simply cutting a deal that would allow content providers to pay internet service providers to have their content prioritized for transmission over other data. Say Google pays Comcast, Time Warner, &amp; Verizon to have YouTube prioritized. Under this circumstance data from YouTube would be given a higher priority on the internet and presumably allocated a larger bandwidth for data transmission than say Vimeo or Flickr. It&#039;s anti-competitive and in a capitalistic system, such as the US economy, it&#039;s bad news because lack of competition leads to poorer quality products. It could basically mean that the company with the most money to burn would control the internet. It&#039;s also resembles the internet version of Payola.

				Perhaps I&#039;m over-simplifying this, but isn&#039;t this like criticizing businesses who can afford to buy ad space on prime time television? <br />They pay for better exposure and service, which in effect is the same thing, isn&#039;t it?

				I guess this is a problem if one assumes the amount of bandwidth available overall shall henceforth remain static.<br /><br />You know, it wasn&#039;t that long ago that one paid for internet access by the hour.&nbsp; Internet access that was all text.<br /><br />I cannot muster much sympathy for worries that one&#039;s $1.50/day ludicrously-fast internet access might theoretically be infinitesimally impacted by a hypothetical.&nbsp; Sorry.

				Think of it this way......<br /><br />How many of you would take the time to wait for a start up business, who can&#039;t afford to pay the higher price for faster upload speeds, to upload on your screen? Or would you get frustrated and then go to an established website who can afford to pay for a faster speed. <br /><br />Net Neutrality is about a level playing field that everyone can compete on. <br /><br />Speed on the internet is everything.......<br /><br />

				To clarify/update this story, it seems as if content-specific throttling being discussed is limited to wireless networks, not to wired home/business internet connections. Here&#039;s a story about it (http://news.cnet.com/8301-31322_3-20012822-256.html?tag=mncol;6n):<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Google and Verizon aren&#039;t saying much more, for now, and The New York Times appears to be tacitly sticking to its story. But if you read between the lines, and read CEO Eric Schmidt&#039;s comments on Net neutrality from this week&#039;s Techonomy conference, it&#039;s clear that the real traffic battleground is wireless networks.<br /><br />My guess: Google and Verizon are almost certainly negotiating in a way to keep wired networks neutral and open, but to preserve Verizon and other telcos&#039; ability to tier and shape their wireless networks as they see fit. It&#039;s bad news for mobile broadband in the United States, but it&#039;s clear that Google&#039;s not standing in the way. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />FWIW, I&#039;m opposed to this too, although I&#039;m not opposed to modest preferential treatment of certain protocols. Companies should be able to register certain data streams as particular types of content (streaming video, etc, based on protocol only), and ISP should be allowed to make data quality guarantees for specific types of content, but ISPs should not be allowed to engage in financial relationships that would yield faster load times for one company&#039;s web page versus another company&#039;s web page, period, regardless of wired/wireless issues.<br /><br />

				I don&#039;t agree with these arguments about &quot;level playing field&quot;. Big businesses are big because they are money machines. They are in the business of earning money whether it be by buying ad space, investing in R&amp;D, increasing distribution, etc. Why would you begrudge a big business for this? If the big businesses were paying to slow down competitors&#039; download speed, that would be different and morally unethical. They are paying for their own content to arrive to the consumer faster, which in my eyes, there is nothing wrong with.<br /><br />I would, in fact, argue that for small businesses to be spending way less money for consumers to receive the same ad experience as they would with big business is actually a grossly uneven playing field and unfair to larger businesses who would be paying much more.

I may be wrong, but if I read the articles correctly, it seems like they are accelerating their own content, not slowing down or limiting others. <br /><br />Can anyone on here confirm whether or not they are actually slowing down bandwidth for other companies? <br /><br />On a principle level, I have no real objection to the concept. In any business, having the deliverable reach the customer at a timely rate is key. If you are looking in terms of a website, then the deliverable of the business is the web page content. If a company will pay to have this content reach their consumer at a faster rate, then I have no problem with that.<br /><br />To bring it back to your Amazon vs. BN analogy: what if either BN or Amazon decided to pick up the tab on free overnight shipping to their customers? Their deliverable gets to the consumer faster because the company paid a premium. Doing this has not actually slowed down or hindered other companies which choose to ship their items via regular mail. In this hypothetical, the company chose to pay a premium, and their content got to the consumer faster. I would consider that a competitive advantage, certainly- but not an unfair one.

				Thanks Casicua........<br /><br />I just realized that I am approaching this issue in a free speech way as opposed to a business argument. <br /><br />My understanding of the argument is that once you let the genie out of the bottle.....You can limit any political website et al......compete via speed as opposed to ideas. <br /><br />not sure where the answer should lie....but I don&#039;t want google controlling what I post....or I should say....who many people would see what I post because I don&#039; feel I should pay......or I cant afford, a faster speed.

				Sorry to resurrect an old thread. My laptop when belly-up, so I&#039;ve been without a computer for the past few weeks.<br /><br />At any rate, here&#039;s a well balanced synopsis of the Net Neutrality issue ...<br /><br />NPR Planet Money: Creating Lanes On The Information Superhighway (http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2010/08/13/129179471/the-friday-podcast-creating-lanes-on-the-information-superhighway)<br /><br />It&#039;s also incidentally a pretty amazing podcast and well worth the time to listen to on a regular basis. :mrgreen:
