				Hi everyone, and thanks for reading. <br />My roommates and I have a 65 year old landlady who deserves to be put out in the streets, as she&#039;s too mean and crazy for a mental hospital. She&#039;s definetly coherant, but is essentially harassing us daily, as she is on the ground floor and we&#039;re on the second.<br />One of my roommies is in England (which she knows) so my other roommate and I have a guest staying with us for 3 days. Our lease is super general, but that didn&#039;t stop the crazy bitch from confronting us and saying that we&#039;re not allowed to have guests! We are all super quiet, and doing NOTHING to disturb her. But she is a shut-in essentially, and monitors our every move. Oh, and bonus, she comes into our apartment when we&#039;re not there. <br /><br />I&#039;m so scared that she&#039;ll do something crazy like change the locks on us! The agency that placed us there, Metropolis Reality, is not returning our calls!!! If someone has been in a similar situation, and dealt with it...I&#039;m counting on your advice! SHould I file a grievance, so that if she tries something shady, there&#039;s a record documenting her insane behavior?? Where do I file this? I&#039;m not familiar with NY laws, but know that mostly they are in favor of the tenant, especially when they are not in the wrong. <br /><br />Please help me! :cry:

				Is it a private house or an apt building?<br /><br />(not 30-15 45th St is it??)<br /><br />How do you know she goes in your apt when you&#039;re not there?&nbsp; &nbsp;Little booby traps could probably stop that.&nbsp; &nbsp;Or heck.. be silly obvious about it and put a barracade inside your door.&nbsp; Something simple that you could move but would be difficult for her.<br />I think you&#039;d need proof of her going into your apt before you could file anything like a grievance and still, I don&#039;t know who you&#039;d file such a thing with.<br /><br />Good luck tho.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I had the same problem with my landlord.&nbsp; He&#039;s between 70 and 80 years old and just the most horrible human being you can imagine (if you want to call him a human being) and he did exactly the same thing.&nbsp; I finally reported him, I do live in a 6 unit building so that helps.&nbsp; I called 311 and reported him, said he was harrassing me and my b/f.&nbsp; My b/f moved in last year and I had to put up with hell with the landlord, every day he would wait for us and he would start cursing my b/f out in greek and they ended up cursing each other, it was horrible, he came into my apartment and I know this because I booby trapped and I got him on camera (my pc).&nbsp; Every time he harrassed me I filed a report, he was fined with $500.00.&nbsp; Also, as general as a lease may be, you have the right to have a roommate (roommate law) even if it doesn&#039;t say it in the lease and you are entitled to have a guest AND YOU ARE ENTITLED TO HAVE SOMEONE LIVE WITH YOU (a mate) AND (wait there&#039;s more) if you have children (doesn&#039;t matter what age) they can move in AND your mate&#039;s children.&nbsp; So I told the old man that not only would I keep reporting him but that I would call my kids and tell them to move in with me and that if I catch him inside my apartment again that I&#039;m going to call the police and tell them you stole from me.&nbsp; <br /><br />I used to be so nice to this man, help him with the garbage, sweep the hallway (all three floors), mop, just felt bad for him because he&#039;s old.<br /><br />Every once in a while he&#039;ll pass us in the hallway and he&#039;ll say giamisu to my b/f and my b/f says malaka something to him....<br /><br />UGH, so call 311 and report her, she can&#039;t just kick you out either and if she changes the locks...she can get in a lot of trouble for that.&nbsp; If you report her you&#039;ll establish a history of harrassment and proof.

				The landlord MUST provide you with a written notice that he/she is going to enter the premises.&nbsp; The only time the landlord can enter the premises without notice is in case of an emergency (i.e. fire in the apartment).&nbsp; If the landlord enters your apartment without notifying you the landlord is breaking the law.

				Uhm, folks, you need facts. In this case the relevant facts are the law and the conditions stated in the lease you signed. Many landlords use the same &quot;Rent stabilization Lease,&quot; which does in fact, grant a right of entry, and not only for emergencies.<br />The LL or Building Management here (includes me) can technically enter the other apartments in the multiple dwelling for example, when the exterminator is around or if I hear a weird noise--after all that noise could be the sound of a pipe bursting or some other condition that would affect everyone in the building.<br />I don&#039;t need to give written notice and it is not trespassing. (Though I don&#039;t, haven&#039;t been in anyone&#039;s unit in forever, have other things keeping me quite busy and I figure if I respect everyone&#039;s space I stand a better chance of having my space respected).<br />But you may have signed a different lease- start by reading the lease you signed. Having a crazy person as a landlord is a pain in the ass, but not illegal. <br />On the other hand, is there harassment? Are you telling us the whole story? Is she questioning your visitor because she has dementia or because your visitor represents something of which she doesn&#039;t approve?<br />Ex: Landlady busts your chops because you have a visitor- you remind her there is nothing in the lease that prevents this. (So far no legal issue). LL goes on to say she doesn&#039;t like that your friend is gay/Hispanic/disabled or something of that nature. (Now you have a cause of action, or at least the potential for one.)<br /><br />Also, if you really want to know what goes on- install a webcam. They are cheap and efficient. Then you can see if LL is actually invading your space. For EX: You see on your webcam LL came into your unit, went near your stove and left (probably no issue);in the alternative, you see on the cam that LL came in, wandered around and took something out of your shredder or picked up your phone and pressed redial- now you have something.<br /><br />Do not dismiss the possibility the LL has some illness (you say she is&nbsp; shut-in)&nbsp; your life may be simpler with a different LL.<br />If LL is sane and these perceived violations continue, get yourself one of those lawyers you don&#039;t have to pay unless you win in court. The first consultation will not cost you anything and you can fully describe the situation to them and they can tell you if there is an issue upon which relief may be granted.<br /><br />

				The thing is, although you have extensive legal rights as a renter here in NY, they&#039;re basically rights that allow you to get out of your lease. You&#039;re not going to end up with thousands of dollars of punitive damages awarded even if your landlady is crazy and breaks the laws. My suggestion* would be to write your landlady a letter indicating the things she has done that are in violation of the law and/or lease, and that if she does them again you will hold her to be in violation of the lease, will give 30 days notice, and will expect the security deposit returned per normal rules. Then move. If she doesn&#039;t send you the deposit (minus itemized deductions, with receipts), take her to small-claims court.<br /><br />(* following my suggestions is usually a bad idea...! :) )

				I also had a landlord in a private house who said the lease stated I could not have overnight guests. I argued back, saying the lease clearly said that only my roommate and I could LIVE there, but absolutely nothing was stated about overnight guests, and having a friend from another country spend four nights on our futon was no violation of our lease. When I went to go get the lease out of the filing cabinet, she relented and went back to screaming about whatever else she was upset about. I lived there only 8 months, and I will never live in a private house again. I know it works out for some people, but it&#039;s not for me.<br /><br />Keep in mind that a lot of the rights that protect tenants in buildings with six or more units do NOT apply to private house situations. If you think the landlady may be violating the law, call 311 or the attorney general&#039;s office to find out for sure and figure out what your next steps are. (If I were you, I&#039;d also be preparing to move and kiss your security deposit goodbye, but that&#039;s me.) <br /><br />Also, Metropolis Realty is in no way obligated to help you on this matter. Unless you can prove that they lied to you about the place (and not mentioning the woman is crazy doesn&#039;t count), they&#039;re just a broker and are there to match listings to tenants. They&#039;re not responsible for helping with the landlord/tenant relationship once they&#039;ve received their fee. They might be willing to work with you on finding a new place for a reduced fee, though, especially if they think you might advertise them as only working with crazy landlords.

				When apartment searching, I found a sweet 2 bedroom over on 35th Street right off of Broadway.&nbsp; When I went to sign the lease, the LL handwrote &quot;no overnight guests allowed&quot; on the lease.&nbsp; While I realized I probably could have them anyways with no legal recourse against me, I figured this LL was a bit crazy and walked from the deal (the place is still showing on Craig&#039;s List and the rent keeps dropping and the realtors keep changing).&nbsp; I could only imagine I&#039;d be having these same issues in the future had I signed on for that.

				Too ethnic probably means someone who speaks at least two languages , while he probably doesnt . <br /><br />Living in a 6 family building isnt always great either . You dont know who is sitting on the stairs when u are coming in late at night,dont know if someone is acting like they live there meanwhile they just walked in the door that was left open a crack&nbsp; by the other tenants . At least in a private home you dont have to worry abt 20 other people walking in and out all night long .

				OK.. I am a landlord here.. get the pitch forks and fire going... I think it is crazy going into another persons apartment - when they are not home.&nbsp; (I hate it even though my tenant has given me permission.) Why you may ask?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what I am about to be confronted with.&nbsp; I would rather have one other person or the tenant himself present as a witness.&nbsp; I think a more appropriate &quot;other side of the coin&quot; comment is having to go in, because you are trying to fix something, and not knowing who might be there.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have a problem with my tenant having over night or whatever guest, some people which I personally wouldn&#039;t have as a guest- but hey- to each their own.&nbsp; But then, something happens upstairs, like when they leave the water on and are flooding the tenant below... so I call, knock, etc. but I HAVE to go in.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know who I might find up there.. they may be asleep - which has happened.&nbsp; I am a not a big woman, and to have a guy who looks like they are hung over <strong><em>or something </em> </strong> in their undies, who fell asleep and did not wake up with the water running, the phone ringing and the bell ringing is a bit scary to deal with by myself.&nbsp; I think the older landlady who is entering is a bit nuts.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				<strong>The landlord has the right to enter the premises if there is an immediate danger of damage/danger to property or life.&nbsp; If there is a water leak coming down, smell of gas or something similar.&nbsp; Check what your lease says...some will state that if there is a gas/electric meter or some sort of main valves the landlord has the right to enter the premise to address the issue pertaining the the specific task at hand.&nbsp; Other than those handful of situations the landlord would be a moron to enter the tenants premises with no valid reason.&nbsp; I have never ever entered my tenants premises and my lease specifically gives me the right to do so for a number of reasons, including to allow the exterminator if they fail to list themselves once per month.&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; :lol:
