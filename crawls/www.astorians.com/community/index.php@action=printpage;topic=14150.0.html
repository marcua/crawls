				Hi everybody ,&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />I&#039;m very happy to be part of the Astorian community. I recently moved here and I would like to share a current project, It&#039;s a stop motion animation series with playmobil characters, hope you guys like it. <br />Also please post your projects and stuff, It&#039;s fun to share with Artists in the neighborhood and get to know the Art and Music scene.<br /><br />Do you guys now any places around the area that showcase experimental electronic music?&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks&nbsp; :-)<br />Sincerely,<br />J<br />www.myspace.com/vectorzero (http://www.myspace.com/vectorzero)<br />------------------------------------------<br /><br /><strong>SoWhat? episode 1 - <em>&quot;The Beginning&quot;</em></strong><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6te5t_UDgI<br />Written by Sascia Pastori, Grace Shin, Lex Kolychev<br />Directed by Sascia Pastori<br />Music by _vectorzero<br />Animation and editing by Sascia Pastori<br />Executive producers Sascia Pastori and Monica Ponzini<br /><br /><strong>Synopsis</strong><br />There are different dimensions, ours is just where this story begins.<br />There is then one where The Six-state Federation is a separatist nation that ditched the declined United States, during what was called the second big depression.<br />This Federation is formed by Manhattan, Bronx, Queens, Kings, Staten Island, and Jersey City. The six boroughs are fighting for economic and political power.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Their political power became corrupted, and big corporations rule with their armies above the police forces.<br /><br />&quot;The organization&quot;, also called &quot;The ORG&quot;, is a secret team determined to re-establish democracy in the six boroughs. They fight the corporations power struggling to re-create the big city once again. Their members have an alias to cover their secret activities.<br />You are about to find out how this story starts watching the series beginning.<br />One morning a big cargo ship appears in the Jacqueline Onassis Reservoir.<br />Seven professionals are called to investigate this unusual event. Some of them will become heroes, others will end up becoming villains.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />The whole movie is realized with Stop motion animation.<br />The actors are Playmobil figures.<br />Several scenes are filmed on green screen and then edited with footage filmed in Manhattan.<br /><br />

				hey there! i think we&#039;re friends on why leave astoria?! ;)<br /><br />you should check out wonderland collective in astoria www.wonderlandny.com, especially for their upcoming event on april 18th with astoria music &amp; arts. texas firehouse in LIC is another artist collective that usually has a live band playing at their monthly spring/summer events, and what i heard last time i was there was pretty experimental, so it should be cool ;) www.texasfirehouse.org.<br /><br />cheers!&nbsp; :mrgreen:
