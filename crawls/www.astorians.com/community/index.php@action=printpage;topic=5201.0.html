				Hello,<br /><br />Here&#39;s hoping that everyone makes it to their destination safely!&nbsp; On my way to the office, I saw a couple of people slip&nbsp; &nbsp;:-D&nbsp; &amp; then&nbsp; :-(&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I can live with the snow, but this sleet crap is really annoying!&nbsp; I should really stop complaining because the train (46th St on the R) is less than a block from my apartment and when I get off it&#39;s only a block and a half to my office!&nbsp;

				Yeah, one thing about Astoria that I always hate when it snows and/or sleets - the cleanup effort - or should I say lack thereof!!&nbsp; Not everyone shovels or salts and there seems to be no enforcement of it, so there&#39;s puddles and ice everywhere, and the snow just piles up in slush through everyone&#39;s footprints.&nbsp; There will be one spot where there&#39;s a nice neighbor or storeowner who actually shovels and salts, but then the next will not do anything with the mess!&nbsp; Even the roads don&#39;t get plowed enough.&nbsp; It&#39;s been this way in the 10 years I&#39;ve lived here.&nbsp; So yes, be careful out there!!

				I&#39;m looking forward to testing the non-skid nature of my chef&#39;s clogs.&nbsp; They worked when I spilled canola on the floor a couple weeks ago. I wonder if they can handle sleet (whatever that is).&nbsp; I&#39;ll keep everyone posted.&nbsp; &nbsp;:wink:

				Me and my limited-mobility foot (torn tendon) did not have an easy commute today.&nbsp; Despite taking both crutches (something I&#39;ve been trying not to do since I&#39;m okay on even surfaces) and my best weather shoes, I STILL slipped getting onto the train.&nbsp; &nbsp;:oops:&nbsp; (But happily, once again someone saw me struggling for balance with two crutches in hand, and offered a seat).<br /><br />I now am elevating my foot and have taken Tylenol.&nbsp; Ow....&nbsp; :| <br /><br />But I made it to work on time!

				I just got back from Albany - they were predicting two feet of snow up there from last night through this morning (which thankfully didn&#39;t happen), but it was coming down fast enough that it seemed like a better idea to come back earlier rather than get trapped up there for another two days or so.&nbsp; It looks like it&#39;s starting to come down heavier!

				Is anyone in this group from the Oswego area?!&nbsp; I lived through some pretty snowy winters in Minnesota, including one year where my family went trick-or-treating in ankle high snow, but I never remember it getting that bad.&nbsp; We should all be lucky that we didn&#39;t get smacked with even 1/4 of the amount that they have upstate!&nbsp; (Hopefully, I didn&#39;t speak too soon!)

				It looks like even Manhattan was completely unprepared for the snow.&nbsp; I had to dodge puddles and snow/slush all through 50th and Broadway, 9th Ave and to 6 Ave, it was a mess everywhere!&nbsp; Of course Astoria&#39;s side streets were even worse, but still, I&#39;m surprised Bloomberg wasn&#39;t more on top of this one.&nbsp; Guess he had better things to worry about.&nbsp; I expect Astoria to suck but Manhattan&#39;s usually better at this.

				Chef clogs: def non skid.&nbsp; Managed not to even slip, though I&#39;m not sure I enjoyed being pelted with ice pellets this morning.&nbsp; It was like God was shooting me with a BB gun. I didn&#39;t appreciate it.&nbsp; But I&#39;m not gonna lie to ya - I had a blast walking home from the train tonight.&nbsp; I walked into the big piles of snow like a little kid.&nbsp; If I hadn&#39;t been so sore from bending over trays of fiddly petit fours all day I would have busted out a snow angel.&nbsp; And then for lunch, the chef made this gorgeous barley lentil soup with cheese bread.&nbsp; I hate cheese, but she used Jarlsberg and truffle butter, which was an absolutely heavenly concoction. Winter is fun.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)

				I agree, Manhattan did seem really unprepared for this. I think the streets were a bigger mess there (at least where I was all day) than in Astoria, which is crazy! Maybe that&#39;s what happens when the first snow of the season comes in mid-February....

				I hope everyone is able to safely make it to where they need to be today!<br /><br />The days following a heavy snow in NYC are the worst!&nbsp; I had to use what little energy I had at 6:30 this morning to maneuver around mounds of snow that were piled at the intersections!&nbsp; At one point, I saw people simply walking down the middle of Broadway in Astoria.&nbsp; I can&#39;t wait until the snow starts to really melt, creating those huge water/dirt puddles.&nbsp; There&#39;s nothing like starting your day off by going in ankle deep into a puddle of slush!&nbsp; &nbsp;:x

				Astoria seems to be less slippery and miserable, because of the lack of sidewalk-shoveling and salt--better traction on the actual snow.&nbsp; For once the old Astoria passivity/laziness seems to have paid off.

				Even house owners are supposed to shovel their sidewalk.&nbsp; Basically hardly anyone does it, and it seems like it&#39;s not enforced, even the MTA doesn&#39;t clear its stairs.&nbsp; But technically, you are supposed to clear your part of the sidewalk in front of what you own, and if you don&#39;t, you are supposed to be fined.&nbsp; Does this happen?&nbsp; I don&#39;t know, but it doesn&#39;t seem like it.&nbsp; I personally hate that people don&#39;t shovel and it creates a slushy mess, which in my experience is slippery and doesn&#39;t provide much traction for me.

				It&#39;s one thing if a residential building hasn&#39;t shoveled in front, but a business should be doing it. On that note, poop on the Eckerds on 30th Ave (between 31st and 32nd) who had NOT shoveled last night when I was coming home around 7:15. It&#39;s not like the space in front of their building is SO HUGE, unlike the Rite Aid down the street who HAD shoveled.<br /><br />Also, it used to drive me crazy when I had a car and they wouldn&#39;t give us a break from alternate side parking but my street was still a disaster. If they want me to move my car, they need to clear the snow! Days like this I&#39;m glad I don&#39;t have my car anymore.

In my former home of Illinois, there was no such law. And even worse, there was some case law that gave property owners the following dilemma. If you don&#39;t shovel, and someone falls on your sidewalk, you&#39;ve done nothing, so you&#39;re not liable. If you <strong>do</strong> shovel, and someone falls on your sidewalk, then you did an inadequate job shoveling and are now liable! <br /><br />I was very pleased that my landlady shoveled the walk and the stairs... But I don&#39;t think my street (that 3-block section of one-way 32nd St off 24th Ave) will be plowed until May sometime...<br />

				I have to say I was completely shocked that the MTA didn&#39;t even shovel the train platforms or stairs. I tried asking the guy in the token booth (anachronism) about it and he said the only cleaning crews were at Ditmars, and apparently they hadn&#39;t bothered to visit any of the other stations in Astoria... what the hell?

Maybe he told you that since he figured you&#39;d be travelling toward Manhattan, not away so you won&#39;t see that it wasn&#39;t cleaned up here. I didn&#39;t get a pic of the platform, but this is what the stairs looked like when I got there at 11:15 this morning. They were like this yesterday too. I saw one person fall each day, and I helped a woman with her bags today b/c she couldn&#39;t hold the railing with all the bags (why so many bags! lol)<br /><br />I took this picture with my phone with the intention of writing an angry letter, but I&#39;m exhausted right now after schlepping around in Manhattan all afternoon with my mom (yes, she RULES! no doubt). Anyone wanna do it for me? Ha&nbsp; :wink: But REALLY - this was at ELEVEN FIFTEEN the day after a storm! (The stairs are clear now, I just came home about 30 minutes ago.) As you can see, even the closed down McDonalds managed to clean out in front, I guess the guys that are working there did it.<br /><br />(also sorry for not attaching the picture with the board, it was over 50K.)<br /><br />(http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a80/alie354/ditmars.jpg)
