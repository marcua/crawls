				Why did Sai Organics close there location on 30th Avenue?&nbsp; What do you think will replace it in that location?&nbsp; Hopefully something fun and might I suggest gay friendly?&nbsp; I would love to see the rainbow flag up on 30th Avenue! :cheesy:

				If you mean the store near 36th Street, it&#039;s been closed for weeks now. I don;t think it did much business. Their other store is also on 30th Avenue at 30-21 30th Avenue, just passed the train station.

				That location was kind of weird and I&#039;m not surprised that it closed. Their hours were like bankers&#039; hours; almost every time I walked by there on my way home from work, it was closed. It wasn&#039;t really Sai any more, despite the sign; there was a different owner and yet I would see Syed in there pretty often (on the rare occasions when it was open). Their merchandise selection was a lot smaller than Sai&#039;s, and their half-hearted attempt at a hot food bar gradually petered out (I guess no one wanted Indian food for breakfast).<br />&nbsp;<br />I don&#039;t know what I want in there. A 99c nail bank would be nice.

				I agree about their hot food, the cuisine was either indian or spicy, and I&nbsp; don&#039;t care for either. I would usually only end up getting one of their soups, which are pretty good. They had a good selection of health food groceries and they were great until they opened their second store by the train station, and then they concentrated on that one, and ended up closing the first. It was never the same after it reopened.

				Sai&#039;s just sucks in general.<br /><br />I used to go there for bagels with their tofu walnut raisin cream cheese. then they stopped making it.<br />and now they don&#039;t make smoothies on Sundays. wtf?<br /><br />only good thing there is the coffee.<br />if they didn&#039;t have that great location by the train, they would be history.<br />

				Nice folks and I loved the fact that I could for once get South Asian cuisine (albeit steam table) with enough fresh veggies.&nbsp; Too bad

				The place was really bringing in the big bucks and that&#039;s what funded his plan to open the other location on 30th avenue by 31st street.&nbsp; Unfortunately I think he focused more on the new location instead of the original concept and location.&nbsp; That&#039;s what did him in.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know we loved going there and lot&#039;s of people are upset he closed that spot.&nbsp; <br />

				Sai Organics (36th St &amp; 30th) is the only place in town that stocks my favorite variety of Amy&#039;s soup so they get my business. I order it by the case. I was bummed they closed that site but I&#039;ll try the one by the train once I run out of soup!
