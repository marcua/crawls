				I just read an update.&nbsp; Supposedly he killled this dog because it had bitten his other pit bull puppy.&nbsp; Authorities found this other puppy locked in an unventilated shed on his property where he was starving it.&nbsp; It was seized and is now up for adoption.

				Wow... people like this just don&#039;t deserve to live... and I feel like that&#039;s a definite understatement.&nbsp; He deserves to be chained to a tree and burned just like he did to the dog. As my mom says, &quot;A life is a life&quot;... doesn&#039;t matter whether it&#039;s human or if it&#039;s a dog, cat, etc. It&#039;s just so sad to think of all the other animals, even in this country alone, that are being abused and locked in small cages, starved.&nbsp; :-(
