				<br />although I am new to this site, I don&#039;t get the impression it serves as an on-line dating service (or did I miss those forums!?)... <br /><br />ok, Miss Single In Astoria...<br /><br />www.lavalife.com<br />http://newyork.craigslist.org/<br /><br />but risky... best to opt for the good old-fashioned method of getting out and about, join groups (in person) and meet people face to face for this kind of thing.<br /><br />happy hunting! ;-)

				hey nothing wrong with wanting to meet people for...whatever.&nbsp; i think it was just the way she approached it that seemed a little strange for this particular forum.&nbsp; this site seems to be a little more down-to-earth than a lot of other networking sites.&nbsp; it was certainly out of place (which is why it didn&#039;t seem to get much response initially).<br /><br />maybe i&#039;m just too sensitive from seeing too much spam in my emailbox.&nbsp; i&#039;m a woman but i&#039;m constantly getting emails about viagra-like products, etc.&nbsp; ugh!&nbsp; what&#039;s up with that?!<br /><br />
