				I used to pay about $90 for a cut and full head highlights in Astoria. All of a sudden all the salon&#039;s prices are WAY UP. I cannot afford it. Have short hair that needs constant maintenance. So.............. before I go changing my style on account of my budget, can anyone recommend an affordable salon or a salon with a deal? Thanks in advance. My wallet appreciates it.

				New Image Hair Salon on Ditmars and 36th St-ish. They&#039;ve done a cut and dye for me for under $70. I dunno about highlights though, since that&#039;s more involved, right? Worth check out though, I&#039;m very please with them.<br /><br />

				The above poster has a point. Highlights are always more $$$. I have them done with the balliage technique and I pay $250 for a full head,<br />$150 for half.<br /><br />But this was just posted a couple of weeks ago - Time Out did its roundup of the city&#039;s best stylists and colorists and two of them are from<br />Saloon on 30th Ave. <br /><br />Here&#039;s the post and the link to the Time Out article:<br /><br />I cant find the thread now, but a long time ago I was looking for a stylist and found someone named Selvi who cut my hair. Since then, she is the only stylist I have ever used and has done every single cut since.&nbsp; She really is so wonderful. Well finally girlfriend got the credit she deserves and was listed in Timeout NY as one of NYCs top stylists. The girl with her, Kathleen is an amazing colorist. She did my hair a red that seriously turned heads. Congrats to them both. They are both at Saloon Salon on 30th avenue. Here is the article link: <br /><br />http://newyork.timeout.com/articles/hair/85778/new-yorks-best-hair-stylists/3.html

				Well, I&#039;ve found that you get what you pay for when it comes to cut and color. We&#039;re in an urban area, not in some small town.<br />$75 for a good cut is really not a high price by NYC standards. Prices aren&#039;t going down these days. If you want quality, it&#039;s not cheap.

				Lift Up prices are $40 and up for a woman&#039;s cut, partial highlights $70 and up, full highlights $95 and up - just<br />proves my point. I&#039;d be very surprised to find anywhere that does highlights and cut for $90 combined. Still,<br />if their work is good, these are great prices.
