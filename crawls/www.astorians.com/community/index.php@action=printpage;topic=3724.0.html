				When you say to the world that you are a Met Fan, it is the permanent pronouncement of alligning yourself behind the underdog!&nbsp; I don&#39;t know how to pronounce the words &quot;favored&quot; against St. Louis.&nbsp; If only the geriatric pitching will hold together?!?&nbsp; :? Will Steve Trachsel stop envisioning throwing a striken quickly enough to throw the next pitch before my coffee grows icecold?&nbsp; &nbsp;:-o&nbsp; Oh man!<br /><br />- Cannibal<br />Eleven years old in 1969.&nbsp; That about says it all!&nbsp; Go Orange &amp; Blue!

				Man, this (game 4) is one ugly ballgame.&nbsp; The Mets are going to have to figure out how to play much smaller ball if they&#39;re going to get past this series and succeed in the WS.&nbsp; They need to do the kind of thing where Reyes starts to steal second and LoDuca punches one through the gap, like they did in that crazy sixth inning.&nbsp; They can&#39;t rely on Delgado and Beltran to hit home runs any more than they can rely on three Cardinals fielders to stand around watching the ball drop between them (which was pretty hysterical).

				<br />NEW YORK Dec 1, 2006 (AP)— Tom Glavine decided to stay with the New York Mets, agreeing Friday to a $10.5 million, one-year contract and opting against a possible return to the Atlanta Braves, a baseball official with knowledge of his decision said. <br /><br />Glavine and the Mets were to announce the decision later Friday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the decision had not yet been announced.<br /><br /><br />***<br /><br />I am a little curious about how these negotiations went. Really impressed how they let Glavine settle with his family and try to get Braves to budge towards a preferred contract. (At least Mets knew they had a 50% chance.)<br /><br />Now if only the Yanks could return some lost pitching sheep.<br />
