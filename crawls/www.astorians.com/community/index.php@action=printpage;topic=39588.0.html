				Just a word about this new Himalayan restaurant in town.&nbsp; Definitely one of the better new dining options to come to the neighborhood, IMO.&nbsp; Very kind and welcoming staff.&nbsp; &nbsp;Clean and comfortable place, though a little more art and d√©cor wouldn&#039;t hurt.&nbsp; Music was very nice and perfect volume.&nbsp; Liquor license coming soon.&nbsp; Food was delicious.&nbsp; The momos were a little disappointing.&nbsp; I&#039;m more accustomed to the round, heartier version.&nbsp; These are crescent shaped and lighter - similar to Japanese fare.&nbsp; The rest of the food was unique and very delicious.&nbsp; Interesting spice combinations and the dishes are very colorful.&nbsp; The Indian style cream of spinach soup is really something else.&nbsp; This place should do well.&nbsp; On Steinway right off 28th.&nbsp; Next to where Cold Stone moved.<br /><br />http://himalayanrestaurantandgrill.com/

				Agreed, so far so good.&nbsp; The chicken is tender without being stew, and the sauces are distinct.&nbsp; They serve bread with the rice dishes which is nice but a bit too carby for my taste.&nbsp; The range of cuisines (Nepalese, Indian Chinese and Indian and Chinese (each distinct) is nice.&nbsp; I have not been disappointed yet.<br /><br />The wait staff also listens if you have any intolerances or preferences.&nbsp;

				Another recommendation for Himalayan Restaurant and Grill here. I ordered delivery from them a few weeks back on GrubHub and it was delicious. Probably because I was wiped out after a long week, I accidentally clicked around too many times and ended up ordering 3 momo appetizers in addition to their mango lassi (which isn&#039;t overly sweet, in fact it&#039;s somewhat on the savory side of the spectrum which is nice). Pretty sure they threw in an extra mango lassi for free since I only saw one on the receipt and yet I got two. The delivery was prompt and everything was terrific.

				I went here yesterday and I liked it. Good food, good service. It was the early-dinner special, so the bill came out to about $17-18 and included appetizer, main course with rice and naan, and coffee (I think there was dessert as well that I didn&#039;t bother with).<br /><br />Portion size was good.

				Went there to have lunch yesterday.&nbsp; Closed.&nbsp; Big sign saying &quot;under new management&quot; and several work permits on the windows.&nbsp; &lt;sigh&gt;<br /><br />I hope for the best, but the last time a nearby place changed hands, (Flames) it was NOT for the better.

				I had one meal there, which I enjoyed, but I suspected they wouldn&#039;t make a go of it. They didn&#039;t have the staples of most Tibetan/Nepalese places on their menu, leaning more heavily on what appeared to be standard (Northern?) Indian food. Always seemed pretty empty in that strip in &quot;Little Egypt.&quot;
