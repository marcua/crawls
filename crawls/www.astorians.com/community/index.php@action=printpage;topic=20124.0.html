				A May 1991 NY Times article mentioned him; killed at 2 am leaving his bar; 1975.<br /><br />According to the article:<br />The police never found the driver. Of the incident, Mr. [Peter] Vallone would only say, &quot;I am absolutely convinced it was an accident.&quot;<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/23/nyregion/playing-for-power-council-s-bid-for-influence-last-four-articles-king-new-york-s.html?pagewanted=3&amp;src=pm
