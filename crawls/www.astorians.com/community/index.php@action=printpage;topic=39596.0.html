				<br />Now that TD Bank stopped offering their coin exchange machines (because some people actually took the time to apparently count their own coins before dumping them into the machines...they realized they were getting short-changed by a few dollars...they complained...so TD then removed ALL machines...thanks a lot guys...either way we generally have to pay for this service, which I&#039;d much rather do than sit around stuffing paper coin holders my entire weekend???)&nbsp; So now I&#039;ve no idea where in the nabe I can lug my piggy bank to dump it into a machine to get bills.<br /><br />Anybody know?&nbsp; Btw I&#039;m up by Ditmars &amp; Steinway.&nbsp; Tx!<br /><br />

				There is a place that&#039;s a bit of a walk if you don&#039;t have a car. Stop &amp; Shop supermarket at Northern Blvd &amp; 48th street. They have a coin counter machine that gives you a receipt which you use to get cash from their customer service. 8% of the money goes to charity through.<br /><br />But perhaps there&#039;s a closer place that others here may know.

				Best Market on 37th St. and 20th Ave has a coin star machine. I&#039;m not sure what it charges, maybe 5-10%. It gives you a receipt and you take it to a checker for cash.

				Go to a coinstar machine and convert the change to a gift card for NO FEE.<br /><br /><br />https://www.coinstar.com/howcoinstarworks#eGiftCard (https://www.coinstar.com/howcoinstarworks#eGiftCard)<br /><br /><br />Here are the machines in 11106:<br />https://www.coinstar.com/KioskFinder?SearchAddress=11106&amp;SearchType=all (https://www.coinstar.com/KioskFinder?SearchAddress=11106&amp;SearchType=all)<br /><br /><br />Click on the Details link to see which giftcards are available at each machine (varies by location)<br /><br /><br />If you don&#039;t get a gift card and pay the 8% fee, the money DOES NOT GO TO CHARITY.

				I used to use the coin machine at TD bank and was so surprised when they discontinued it.&nbsp; I have so much change that I don&#039;t know what to do with.&nbsp; Now the machines are sitting there unused. What a waste! Maybe they&#039;ll bring them back into use.

				I used the Coinstar machine and got credit to my Amazon account. It&#039;s actually a pretty decent solution as you get no penalty fee and then you can just buy almost whatever you want on Amazon. I mean, rather than getting various items at Duane Reade or wherever just order them online. &quot;Same money&quot;, just delivered instead of picked up.

				It&#039;s best to keep coins in a tin can. Coffee cans with a lid are good. Easier to store and to carry.
