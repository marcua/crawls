				Has anyone else heard all the noise from the helicopters? It started over a year ago and the noise is driving me crazy! I was sleeping the other day and the noise was so loud I woke up from the vibrations :-P!

				I see them from my bedroom window sitting over the Grand Central / BQE and in our front room over the Triborough Bridge.&nbsp; When they are sitting in a row not moving much, I have come to learn that they are usually traffic helicopters.&nbsp; I know this because I turn on the television and hear reports about accidents and can tell that the helicopters are above the accident.&nbsp; Not sure what you can do about it.

				Yah, I always figured they were traffic helicopters and/or going back to lga to land. We are close to the BQE, the GCP, and a few bridges. Plus, we&#039;re between Manhattan and an airport.<br /><br />Did they just start all of a sudden last summer for you? I have always heard them (I moved here two years ago, Steinway &amp; 21 Av.), and while they&#039;re noticeable, they haven&#039;t woken me up or anything. (Maybe I&#039;m a sounder sleeper than I thought!)

				Is it also possible this is increased surveillance with the Fourth? I know there were more check points along the grand central and I noticed Helicopters around the airport hovering.

When we first moved here we used to hear the occasional helo/airplane, but since I grew up near JFK airport, it didn&#039;t really bother me. But lately, meaning about 8 months or so, the air traffic above us here in the Ditmars area above Astoria Blvd. has increased at least 5 times the amount it was beforehand. Sometimes it is helicopters doing their traffic reports. But it isn&#039;t helicopters going to the Hamptons since they are coming from LaGuardia and heading to Manhattan and vice versa. And other times, like late last Thursday night and last week Wednesday night, when a helo is hovering pretty much overhead above 42nd St and Astoria Blvd at 4 in the morning it isn&#039;t a traffic helo , but rather a police helo obviously searching for something. And it is irksome but, again, we live in a city not in the suburbs and such things are to be expected. If they wake you up I suggest getting&nbsp; good earplugs. <br />During fleet week, it was really unbearable. One day I counted 25 (TWENTY FIVE!) in one hour!! And they literally pass right over our house. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Personally I don&#039;t get awakened unless my windows are open as they have been lately. But I actually haven&#039;t heard them in about 4 days
