			I want to plant a garden this spring. &nbsp;<br /><br />OK, I would be satisfied with planting a few pots of basil, chives, oregano, mint, parsley, and lemongrass. &nbsp;Maybe cherry tomatoes. &nbsp;Ohhh, eggplant. &nbsp;Broccoli. &nbsp;Sugar-snap peas. &nbsp;Zucchini, summer squash, spiiiiiiiiiinach! &nbsp;Okra. &nbsp;Cukes. &nbsp;Is it hot in here? &nbsp;<br /><br />1) Astoria has 2 community gardens, neither of which is satisfactory/accessible/safe <br />2) My landlord won't let me go on the roof, much less plant stuff up there.<br />3) My fire escape isn't feasible either. &nbsp;<br /><br />Does anyone have access to some dirt in a relatively safe place? &nbsp;Can we talk? &nbsp;PM me.

			I too would be interested in doing a Garden. In upstate before I moved here I use to have a vegetable garden, a herb garden, and a flower garden. It was so nice when I wanted to cook and could get fresh vegetables and herbs and decorate the table with flowers from my garden. I'm all out on the garden idea hook me up.<br /><br />Colleen

			Wow Colleen. You better be careful. With all this talk of vegetables and herbs people might mistake you for a Vegestorian. &nbsp;:lol: <br /><br />I think it would be really cool to have a community garden of some kind around here.

			Just cause I am a meat loving eater doesnt mean that I don't love and enjoy eating vegetables too! Especially home grown tomatoes, nothing in the world beats home grown tomatoes. &nbsp;:lol: &nbsp;Also just cause I eat meat doesn't mean that I don't enjoy a good salad once in awhile like today for lunch. :D <br /><br />Colleen
