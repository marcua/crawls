				Post by: <strong>merm</strong> on <strong>October 27, 2006, 09:58:07 AM</strong>

				<strong>General Board Guidelines:</strong><br /><br />- <strong>This board is an open community site.</strong> Anyone and everyone is welcome here as long as you obey the rules. No member of this board speaks for all the other members. Everyone is equal, there are no cliques. To our best ability the rules are applied equally - please let us know if you&#039;ve been treated unfairly.<br /><br />- <strong>This isn&#039;t a random internet site.</strong> Given the nature of this online community having real world connections to a real community (Astoria &amp; LIC) it&#039;s important to keep in mind that what happens here is not limited to the void of the internet. What you say, and how you behave here has an impact on <em>your</em> real community that you live in. Please treat others with the same neighborly respect you would like to receive from one of your neighbors. This isn&#039;t just a random internet site with people you&#039;ll never meet.<br /><br />- <strong>This is not a &quot;bulletin board&quot;</strong> like the kind you see at your local grocery store, it is a community discussion and conversation board. There is a bias on the board towards &quot;discussion&quot; and less interest in &quot;classifieds&quot; and &quot;advertisements&quot;. If you have a classified or advertisement to post it&#039;s no problem, just please do it in the business or trade categories, or post on craigslist.<br /><br />Basically, please try and keep in mind that this is a public conversation and dialog just like you might have in a local cafe or bar. You might feel insulated from other people on this board because it&#039;s an electronic conversation but try and keep in mind that unlike most random internet sites, you probably live next door to the people you interact with on this board. The way you treat others here has a direct impact on the &quot;Astoria Karma&quot; you experience on the street. As you engage people please keep this in mind.<br /><br /><strong>THE &quot;RULES&quot;</strong><br /><br />- <strong>Don&#039;t make it personal:</strong> If you have a problem with something someone has said, ask for clarification, or <strong>send them a private message</strong>. If you feel the need to respond publicly don&#039;t make it personal (like &quot;hey you jerk, I&#039;m offended&quot;). Instead engage the person&#039;s idea and express your disagreement with it in a respectful way (I disagree with what you&#039;ve said here and this is why...).<br /><br />- <strong>No name calling:</strong> Don&#039;t call people names. This includes calling someone a troll. Calling people names does no service to this community and it will not be tolerated - <em>don&#039;t do it</em>, even if &quot;the other person started it&quot;. If you have a problem with someone and you want to take it to the playground and duke it out do it in your own space (email, private message). If you can&#039;t behave, the moderators reserve the right to temporarily or permanently ban you.<br /><br />- <strong>Hate speech is not welcome here:</strong> If you must be a bigot, you may not use hate speech (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech) to express your ideas.<br /><br />- <strong>Use the &quot;report to moderator&quot; feature:</strong> If you find something offensive, or if someone is misbehaving or not following the board guidelines please assist the moderators by reporting that post. A message is generated that goes to the moderation queue and moderators will respond as soon as possible.<br /><br />- <strong>Don&#039;t post the same thing more than once:</strong> You might think this will give you more exposure; it does, but in a negative way because this is seen as rude. Post your content once, to the correct category, people will see it and will be more likely to appreciate and respond to your post.<br /><br />- <strong>Do not quote personal messages publicly:</strong> Unless you are sure the other person would be ok with it. We don&#039;t want to read your personal conversations.<br /><br />- <strong>Do not troll:</strong> Trolling is when you just provoke people to make them upset by making it personal, calling them names, or posting offensive images or text to upset them. Your ideas are welcome, your personally-directed insults are not.<br /><br />- <strong>Contact a moderator or admin</strong>: If you are having an ongoing problem, or feel you are being harassed by another member you can contact one of the moderators directly. We are always here to help in any way we can.<br /><br />* Please provide feedback about these ideas. As this community grows the rules may need to change, please feel free to make suggestions or provide feedback as your ideas are welcome.

				No name calling.&nbsp; (Jerk!)<br /><br />No assumptions of belief or intentions.&nbsp; (Like OK to ask -- Are you a non-smoker?&nbsp; But not OK to say -- You must be a self righteous scum sucking awful holier than though non-smoker who knows nothing about the <em>real</em> trauma of addiction!)&nbsp;

				So many r00lz ... I would get kicked off this board so fast...&nbsp; :-D <br /><br />Rummaging through a mass of old floppy disks (looking for something entirely different) I found this &quot;Welcome&quot; message from a BBS I knew in the early 1990s. Membership was usually paid for, so those who got freebie memberships (mostly girls) got this tremulous welcome. (I never had one of the coveted freebie accounts, but those who I knew who had freebie accounts on this board are <em><strong>DEAD!</strong></em> See where it got them...&nbsp; :? )<br /><br />All accounts here are &quot;complimentary&quot; so I think this screed has resonance -- someone (probably not you) is paying for this board to be here.<br /><br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">&nbsp; Dear [Spamhead]:<br /><br />&nbsp; We&#39;d like to take this opportunity to welcome you and point out a<br />&nbsp; few details that are applicable to the use of your account.<br /><br />)[&gt; First and foremost, you should NEVER let anyone else know that you have a<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; complimentary account on the system.&nbsp; This tends to make those who are<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; paying for you to be here, feel bad, and results in an endless cycle of<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; bickering and long tirades by mail about &quot;hey, how come he gets one and<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I don&#39;t.&quot;&nbsp; WE DON&#39;T WANT TO HEAR IT, SO BE QUIET AND DON&#39;T RUIN A GOOD<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; THING.<br /><br />)[&gt; In general: DO NOT ACT LIKE AN ASSHOLE.&nbsp; This is the part where you use<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; common sense.&nbsp; Do not add work for us by being annoying to management,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; or paying members.&nbsp; Under NO circumstances are ElYtE DuDeZ to start<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; El!tE wArZ with people who have no comprehension of the underground.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; They don&#39;t know any better, if they are pissing you off, then reply<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; with witty verbal repartee.&nbsp; DO NOT turn off their phones or make any<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; person&#39;s life turn into living hell!&nbsp; This makes things REALLY annoying<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; for us and will result in a total loss of good will in your direction.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; While someone may indeed be an asshole, and have all their karma<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; catching up to them RIGHT NOW.&nbsp; DO NOT hassle people who are members<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; here, because then WE get to hear all about it and have to hold their<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; hand and comfort them.&nbsp; And we have a lot of other things we&#39;d rather<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; be doing.<br /><br />&nbsp; Conversely if you help make things&nbsp; flow&nbsp; smoothly,&nbsp; post&nbsp; cool&nbsp; stuff,&nbsp; and<br />&nbsp; generally&nbsp; act in accordance with system harmony -- then everything is cool,<br />&nbsp; life is good, and you are made to feel at home here.&nbsp; Which is as it&nbsp; should<br />&nbsp; be.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There really aren&#39;t any rules,&nbsp; just try to be decent to each other.<br /><br />&nbsp; This entire missive&nbsp; has&nbsp; been&nbsp; written&nbsp; in&nbsp; anticipation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; combined<br />&nbsp; elYtNeSZ&nbsp; of this BBS pushing the limits of peaceful coexistence by gathering<br />&nbsp; together every elite dude on earth and allowing them to&nbsp; congregate&nbsp; in&nbsp; one<br />&nbsp; place&nbsp; --&nbsp; with the almost assured result of:&nbsp; &quot;He called me a lame loser in<br />&nbsp; 1984 and stole my drugZ at last year&#39;s SummerCon.&nbsp; I&nbsp; thought&nbsp; disconnecting<br />&nbsp; his&nbsp; dog,&nbsp; infecting&nbsp; his&nbsp; toaster&nbsp; with&nbsp; a polymorphic virus and making the<br />&nbsp; computer spontaneously decombust, was a&nbsp; reasonable&nbsp; response&nbsp; to&nbsp; that.&nbsp; &nbsp;I<br />&nbsp; don&#39;t see your problem?&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; As a&nbsp; wise black&nbsp; man once&nbsp; said to me&nbsp; on a street corner:&nbsp; Peace out&nbsp; bro&#39;<br /><br />&nbsp; On behalf of System<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></code>

				Also, it&#39;s helpful to remember that your actions/words here can reflect either well or badly on you.&nbsp; We all have choices as to what we say, and time to reflect on our responses because it&#39;s written not spoken.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know if it falls under the category of trolling, but please don&#39;t egg on a fight if it sprouts up here.&nbsp; You&#39;ll appear tedious at best and annoying at most.<br /><br />&quot;Just try to be decent to each other.&quot; pretty much says it all as I see it.

				daisy brings up a good point.<br /><br />I think a natural consequence that will happen is that those who are nasty and unreasonable to others on the board will just not be taken seriously in the future, which in effect makes their message null and void.&nbsp; I mean, who wants to listen to someone go on and on about how stupid you are?&nbsp; Or how you don&#39;t care enough?&nbsp; There are a number of people I&#39;ve encountered in my life - both on board and in the real world - that I just can&#39;t take seriously anymore because of their unfortunate behavior.&nbsp;

				Good point Daisy.<br /><br />We pretty much operate on a case by case basis. If someone is particularly rude we&#39;ll give a warning, if it keeps up we&#39;ll issue a temporary ban for X days.<br /><br />Nobody yet has been permanently banned, though we&#39;re not against doing that. The &quot;rules&quot; are just guidelines, but the reality is that if someone makes a real jerk of themselves they can expect to be temporarily banned from posting.

				I have tried to read your codes but even with reading glasses and a magnifying glass, I cannot. Now I know who wrote the Lords Prayer on the head of a pin. I will just assume if I say something like &amp;^^%^%$#$$ or call someone a rotten #$@#%##@ or tell somebody to go #^%$# then I&#039;ll get kicked off. But of course I would never do that.
