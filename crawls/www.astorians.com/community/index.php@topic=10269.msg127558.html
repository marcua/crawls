And I certainly do not recall anyone in the US supporting bomb throwing. <br /><br />I do recall in later years many abortion clinic bombings and murders of doctors and innocents by so called right to lifers. Something I found incredibly hypocritical and morally repugnant to say the least.<br /><br />If you can&#039;t be civil with your bombastic rhetoric, at least try being truthful to the facts, instead of making things up to suit your warped views.<br /><br />There is a big difference between a peace demonstration and hurling a bomb which you conveniently lump together. <br /><br />BTW - all the instance of violence in these demonstrations, many I personally witnessed came from the right and particularly Police and government forces. Kent&nbsp; State and Jackson State particularly came to mind where innocent students were shot by Nat&#039;l Guardsmen - many of whom were innocently were walking across campus to go to class.<br /><br />I have also seen NYPD on horses in riot gear&nbsp; club innocent students and getting trampled by horses and girls injured running into and being then struck by oncoming traffic into 2nd Avenue. In front of my eyes I saw this happen - where ? Those apparently dangerous thug students of Stuyvesant HS. When I saw this nation&#039;s best and brightest being assaulted like that - if I had any dought about Viet Nam in ended right there.<br /><br />So please don&#039;t lecture me about your vague recollections of something you heard about as a kid. Try getting your facts straight first.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I do have my facts&nbsp; straight. Of course&nbsp; you recall the two&nbsp; guys who bombed&nbsp; an Abortion clinic, but, don&#039;t recall&nbsp; the bombings that happened&nbsp; by extreme left groups, cause&nbsp; those who write the news were and are on the side of the Left wing bomber throwers.<br /><br />I know people who were in the Guard and Vietnam, at the time, and&nbsp; what happened in Kent State, the burning down of the ROTC building, the SDS other incidents. <br /><br />They didn&#039;t bring the &#039;end&#039; of any war, they were supporting Ho Chi Minh, and the Communists, who did win, and then the so-called&nbsp; &#039;Peace&#039; demonstrators&nbsp; walked&nbsp; away and applauded as millions were killed&nbsp; in South East Asia. Claiming to be for &#039;Peace&#039; while turning a blind eye&nbsp; to genocide is&nbsp; pretty warped.</div>

So,I replied about the 60&#039;s&nbsp; &#039;bomb throwers&#039; who now&nbsp; are teaching and have grown up. Unfortunately, my stab at sarcasm, invoked the usually &#039;outrage.&#039; So, this&nbsp; response here&nbsp; is highly appropriate, thanks.&nbsp; :lol:</div>

And I certainly do not recall anyone in the US supporting bomb throwing. <br /><br />I do recall in later years many abortion clinic bombings and murders of doctors and innocents by so called right to lifers. Something I found incredibly hypocritical and morally repugnant to say the least.<br /><br />If you can&#039;t be civil with your bombastic rhetoric, at least try being truthful to the facts, instead of making things up to suit your warped views.<br /><br />There is a big difference between a peace demonstration and hurling a bomb which you conveniently lump together. <br /><br />BTW - all the instance of violence in these demonstrations, many I personally witnessed came from the right and particularly Police and government forces. Kent&nbsp; State and Jackson State particularly came to mind where innocent students were shot by Nat&#039;l Guardsmen - many of whom were innocently were walking across campus to go to class.<br /><br />I have also seen NYPD on horses in riot gear&nbsp; club innocent students and getting trampled by horses and girls injured running into and being then struck by oncoming traffic into 2nd Avenue. In front of my eyes I saw this happen - where ? Those apparently dangerous thug students of Stuyvesant HS. When I saw this nation&#039;s best and brightest being assaulted like that - if I had any dought about Viet Nam in ended right there.<br /><br />So please don&#039;t lecture me about your vague recollections of something you heard about as a kid. Try getting your facts straight first.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />The Weathermen??&nbsp; Never heard of them?? The Symbonise (sp?) Liberation Army nuts, who kidnapped Patty Hearst??&nbsp; Never heard of them??&nbsp; You are very biased in your opinions. </div>

To listen to the music, for the promised &quot;Three Days of Peace and Music&quot; and for the counterculture to open dialogue with our ethical and cultural counterparts. I remember the Black Panthers, Vietnam Vets, Rednecks, anti- and pro-war protesters, gays and lesbians, pro- and anti-government advocates, pro- and anti-drug advocates. Although not scheduled, the music started around 5:00 PM on Friday. The meetings, however, had started as soon as people arrived the evening before. Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin and Paul Krassner kept a list of where each group was camping so that anyone who wanted to could find each other.<br /><br />Sure there were plenty of drugs and alcohol.

Our brothers, boy friends and husbands were being conscripted into the armed services to die fighting an illegal war that we weren&#039;t going to win and no-one was listening to us. We shared our food, dry clothing and anything else we had that someone else didn&#039;t. We, yes all 400,000+ of us, respected each other even if we disagreed with their political stance. There was no name calling. I don&#039;t even remember a single fist fight. <br /><br />We were grooving to the music, and planning how to overthrow the current administration for the good of the nation. Everyone who would become infamous in the future of resistance movements was there.

I am personally heart sickened at the Obama backers who are calling for Clinton to drop out and leave her millions of supporters disenfranchised because they want to show their muscle without any regard for those disenfranchised. In 1969 we were not only willing to hear each other out, to the end, but to try to understand the other point of view. There were those who had started the non-peaceful demonstration movements in Chicago in 1968. It was a time for proponents of both the civil disobedience and more radical violent movements to hear each other&#039;s objectives. <br /><br />The outcome of all those meetings produced the counterculture of Love, Sex and Rock &#039;N Roll. We had empathy and love, even for those who did not agree with us. <br /><br />And one other truly remarkable thing happened on that memorable weekend. After trying and failing for years and years, I became pregnant with my now 38-year old twin sons. </div>

After trying and failing for years and years, I became pregnant with my now 38-year old twin sons. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wait, you admit there were plenty of drugs and alcohol&nbsp; and that you became pregnant that weekend, so I am I &#039;dead&#039; wrong about was going on? BTW, God Bless twins, that must be something.&nbsp; :mrgreen: So, the Woodstock generation started on a&nbsp; LIE?&nbsp; OK, I at least thought they were being truthful.&nbsp; :lol:&nbsp; Just kidding. I play drums/skins, and over the years have run across&nbsp; many musicians and folks who were there, and they have given me a decidedly different&nbsp; view of the event. You list Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, these folks weren&#039;t&nbsp; &#039;Hippies&#039;, but, &#039;Yippies&#039;, the &quot;peace and love&#039; they advocated had a&nbsp; healthy, or IMO unhealthy, dose of Marxism. Still, &#039;Steal This Book&#039; was one of the first books I ever read, in my &#039;Lefty&#039; days, when my hair&nbsp; was long and Led Zeppelin was playing the Garden. Older than your twin sons, by about a decade, I did&nbsp; know folks who still idolised Hoffman till his unfortunate death.&nbsp; Abbie Hoffman. In a speech he made only a few years before his death, Abbie described the Left as &#039;three people in a phone booth, with two conspiring to throw the third one out because the third one is a revisionist.&#039; I can attest&nbsp; to this view, as most intolerance&nbsp; I find is coming from the Left. Though his politics may have ranged from far left in the 1960s to much more &#039;moderate&#039; toward the end of his life, Abbie, as you correctly stated, believed groups of people, black and white, rich and poor, conservative and liberal, could be brought together if they focused on a single issue. Yes, the vegan, lesbian could probably stand to be in the same room with the middle-aged, cigar-chomping, meat-eating homophobic construction worker if they both opposed the purchase of pristine forest land by a developer. <br /><br />Sadly, this&nbsp; did not last long, beyond&nbsp; the well-meaning, but, naive, Woodstock generation. Free Love, led&nbsp; to &#039;Aids&#039; and broken families, &#039;Peace&#039; at any cost, led to manipulation by Communist and even Fascist&nbsp; forces, that would end such freedom.Leonard Weinglass, the famed lawyer for Tom Hayden, Abbie Hoffman, and the Chicago Seven, is now counsel for Black Panther and cop-killer Mumia Abu, which I referred&nbsp; to earlier.&nbsp; There&nbsp; are millions&nbsp; of examples&nbsp; of bad things&nbsp; that happened as a result of what you refer&nbsp; to as the &#039;resistance&#039; movement of the 60&#039;s. Certainly, Vietnam&nbsp; was not justified, as to the cost of blood, especially since&nbsp; the Vietnamese had the support&nbsp; from China and the Soviets and had defeated&nbsp; the French in the&nbsp; 50s. But, like&nbsp; the goals of maximum Freedom you profess, the intent was good, in turning back Communism as the intent of fighting Fascism, today symbolised by religious extremist in the 9/11 attacks and others worldwide. We should be on the same side. I hate being in conflict with my fellow&nbsp; Americans, more to the point, Astorians. :| I hate&nbsp; that we have &#039;speech codes.&#039; In the end&nbsp; Abbie Hoffman, killed himself during a deep depressive period. One can be critical about the war,&nbsp; Abu Gharib, and the reasons U.S. troops were over there in the first place. But,&nbsp; the Left should be loudly cheering,&nbsp; the capture and overthrow of Saddam Hussein, who kept his people under his boot, and horribly tortured and killed anybody who dared oppose him. The Left should be drowning out the Right with cheers that this man is no longer a threat to anyone. The left should be out in front opposing Islamic fascism, that subjugates women and kills&nbsp; gay and lesbian folks. After all, in the end, Al Qeada, and&nbsp; Saddam, and others like them, didn&#039;t see us as Hippies, Yippies, Punks, Lesbian , Gay, Straight, Republican, Democrat, Left or Right. They saw Americans, and that was enough. <br /></div>

After all, in the end, Al Qeada, and&nbsp; Saddam, and others like them, didn&#039;t see us as Hippies, Yippies, Punks, Lesbian , Gay, Straight, Republican, Democrat, Left or Right. They saw Americans, and that was enough.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>If you really hate being in conflict, then why don&#039;t you start to moderate your own posts? How many of our husbands, fathers and sons died to overthrow Saddam Hussein? Even one would be too many. We didn&#039;t belong there. We, all non-Muslims, are considered as heathens by those who applauded the acts of 9/11. It had nothing to do with our Nationality. It was all about the freedom of our religious beliefs. I don&#039;t want to have anyone tell me how to live my life and therefore I will not tell anyone else how to live theirs. Al Qeada&#039;s ultimate goal is to wipe Israel and all the Jews off the face of the earth. Once they accomplish this they will start on the Christians. Their change has to come from the inside. We need to protect our borders and citizens without going to war with anyone ever again. But, oh, wait, John McCain thinks we&#039;re going to have to stay in Iraq for the next hundred years. Yeah, that&#039;s the way to make peace in the world.<br /><br />And one other thing, Abbie was my friend. Back in the 60s no-one understood how depression affected the human brain; it wasn&#039;t until the early 80s that he was finally diagnosed as manic-depressive; now known as Bipolar Disorder. He was put on newly discovered medication a few years later, but it never helped his deepest, darkest bouts of depression. Only after weeks of not being able to get out of bed, home alone in a small apartment in New Hope, PA, and helping his mother deal with her impending death from cancer did I finally accepted the coroner&#039;s report of suicide as a result of the amount of Phenobarbital found in his system. I don&#039;t remember who said this at Abbie&#039;s funeral, but I somehow always remembered it: Abbie lived his life in the Jewish prophetic tradition, which is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.</div>
