				I just got back a little while ago from the show &quot;Putnam County Spelling Bee&quot;. I loved it, while the first half was funnier, the entire show was great, funny and very amusing. I forgot what it was like to go to a play (hadn&#039;t been in five years). I can&#039;t wait to go again. <br /><br />Any comments on Putnam or recommendations for other great off-broadway shows, etc?

				That&#039;s a great show. I avoided seeing it for a long time, not really appreciating the concept.&nbsp; But it really is a good show and has a great cast right now.&nbsp; For something really different, go see Spring Awakening.&nbsp; The music is by Duncan Sheik, it&#039;s a little risque, different.&nbsp; You can get seats on the stage for $39 or so--a great deal.&nbsp; For a really funny, more traditional show...Drowsy Chaperone is my favorite right now.&nbsp; Of course, Wicked is a must see, but I think it&#039;s still a very long wait to get tickets.

				I&#039;ll check out the tickets,....Putnam was surprisingly funny, and laugh-out-loud funny. We got tickets at the last minute, (thursday for a Sat showing) and they were half price and in the FRONT row....really really funny, and the cast was excellent. <br /><br />I read Wicked and loved it, so I would love to see the play. Still lamenting missing out on Producers with the original cast....anyone catch that one? Tony Danza is in it now, and I just don&#039;t know.....

				Producers is closing next month, so if you haven&#039;t seen you only have a little time.&nbsp; A new Mel Brooks play will be opening soon, but I&#039;m not sure when.&nbsp;

				I thought Wicked was a little cheesy.&nbsp; I suppose nearly all Broadway musicals are coated with at least a thin layer of Velveeta, but it was a little too much for me. The woman who played Elphaba had an amazing voice, though.&nbsp; I forget what her name is (Jennifer Rodriguez, or something close to that), but she was easily the best part of the show.&nbsp; I got to see The Producers near when it first opened, but Matthew Broderick was on vacation when we were there, so it was just Nathan Lane, who is, of course, fabulous, and the understudy who played Leo Bloom was terrific.&nbsp; The movie didn&#039;t work, I found. Definitely better onstage.&nbsp; I saw A Chorus Line recently, too, and adored it.&nbsp; I loved how different it is from most Broadway shows.&nbsp; It&#039;s not all about the set and costumes and lighting.&nbsp; It&#039;s simple, the writing and songs are brilliant, and along with Chicago (which I saw funnily enough in London), it&#039;s one of my favorites.&nbsp; I hated Phantom.&nbsp; Loved it when I was ten and got to see Michael Crawford, but no one else can sing the part of the Phantom properly, if you ask me.&nbsp; And talk about cheesy ... I personally felt it worked better as the new movie with that Emmy Rossum chick (even though the dude who played the Phantom was less than fabulous).&nbsp; Les Miserables is a must-see.&nbsp; I cannot describe how thoroughly in love with that show I am.&nbsp; And I&#039;m so sad Miss Saigon is done.&nbsp; I saw it in LA when I was in high school, and I wish I could see it again.&nbsp; Wonderful.&nbsp; <br /><br />When my dad comes to visit again we&#039;re seeing Mamma Mia because it sounds adorable.&nbsp; Would love to see The Drowsy Chaperone.&nbsp; That&#039;ll be next, provided it doesn&#039;t close for when my dad visits again.&nbsp;

				<br />A number of the shows have drawings a few hours before the show starts where you enter your name and they pick out about 10 names who can buy 2 tickets for something like $25 each.&nbsp; There is a website somewhere with all of the details, I&#039;ll try to find it.&nbsp; As for my favorites, Les Mis, Aida (no longer on broadway), Rent (got $20 seats in the first row through the drawing), and of course Spamalot.&nbsp; For Spamalot one of my friends stood on line for 2 hours last January and got us standing room seats.&nbsp; We stood at the back of the Orchestra seats for the first half and then the ushers seated us in empty seats for the second, I ended up in the sixth row!&nbsp; On my list to see are Avenue Q, Wicked, and Mary Poppins.&nbsp;

				the last thing i saw (which is the only thing in recent years) was Avenue Q and i LOVED it. I even have the soundtrack. I have to get one of those Sucks to Be Me tee-shirts. <br />This was also John&#039;s first broadway show and he was very wary of seeing a musical, but he loved it as well. <br />Next on our list are:<br />Wicked (read the book and it was fab...son of a witch is on my list of books to read next)<br />Spamalot<br />Drowsy Chaperone<br />There were another few that i had read about but their names escape me. I&#039;m not addicted to musicals, i do enjoy a straight play.<br />Sign up for emails from Playbill.com there are usually some really good discounts that don&#039;t involve waiting ages or luck of the draw.<br />Also, Roundabout productions (such as Cabaret) do volunteer ushering where you hand out playbills and what not and in exchange you get a free seat.<br />I saw Hurrah at Last (Richard Greenburg Play which was very very good-&quot;Money doesn&#039;t buy happiness but ut upgrades dispair so beautifully)handed out some playbills and directed a few folks to their seat and then watched the show from 4th row center.<br />Don&#039;t know what other ones do it but it is worth checking to see which productions do the volunteer usher thing.
