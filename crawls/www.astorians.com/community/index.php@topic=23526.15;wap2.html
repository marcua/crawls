			Hello hockey fans been awhile since I posted on here. Just wanted to inform anyone new on here or new to seeing this post that the group of hockey guys and myself have gone back to playing at hoyt park. Right near the entrance to the Astoria Blvd train station across from neptune dinner. We have anywhere from 10 to 12 skaters on a Sunday and have 2 goalies if needed. The surface at hoyt park is alot better now and the surface feels like your skating on ice.<br />If anyone is interested in some roller hockey pick up games come thru we will be ther every Sunday from 12 til late afternoon. We play a fun, fast, friendly and enjoyable roller hockey games. Hope to see ya there. <br />&nbsp;
