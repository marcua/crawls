				Hi, how're you all doing. &nbsp;Just wondering what people were thinking about<br />the current state of the world and the U.S. in particular.<br />&nbsp; The thing that has been on my mind lately is the re-passing of the U.S.A. <br />PATRIOT Act and how maybe some of it's &quot;sunset&quot; clauses may conflict with our basic constitutional rights as citizens of this country. &nbsp;Any thoughts on the topic would be appreciated. &nbsp;I'm not quite sure myself what to think of it yet.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;It would be nice to hear some rantings &amp; ravings or just some good ol' fashioned civilized debate from any and all sides of the political spectrum, about absolutely anything to do with freedom, security, privacy, laws, pollution, taxation, war, etc.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I believe that these are exciting times that we're living in and to let it <br />pass by without comment would be saddening.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Ciao :-)<br /><br />[October 2005]: Below is a list of hyperlinks to political discussionisms (&lt;Newspeak) as appeared or are appearing on astorians.net...<br />By doing this am I making Big Brother's job easier? or am I adding fuel to the fire that lights the proverbial as*ses of le Resistance?

				Actually, the measure has only passed with portions of the original act, so it's hard to say. &nbsp;I'm willing to bet most people who think about it aren't behind it. &nbsp;People who are easily scared and don't think of the consequences of what the actual details of the Patriot Act are (or even know what they are) will probably be rooting for it to pass.

				Thank you, Telesphoros for replying.<br />I am so glad that there are people who are willing to talk/communicate about these things.<br /><br />&quot;Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT ACT) Act of 2001&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; At first glance a lot of the provisions (the original 2001 Act) seem to make sense and they even go so far as to say something to the effect that congress will be &quot;condemning discrimination against Arab and Muslim Americans&quot;. &nbsp;Hey, I'm all for obstructing terrorism. &nbsp;Who isn't?<br /><br />&nbsp; I downloaded the 2001 version:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; http://news.findlaw.com/cnn/docs/terrorism/hr3162.pdf<br />or<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; http://tinyurl.com/83j9r<br /><br />and I must say that it's pretty daunting as far as size goes (132 pages long). &nbsp;I am not so clear about which parts were retained either &quot;permanently&quot; or not up for revoting until another 10 years.<br /><br />Oh, O.K.,<br />I just googled it...<br /><br />Here are two links, the latter of which goes into more detail about the 16 provisions that were set to expire, (14 of which did not). &nbsp;They include such <br />things as &quot;sneek and peek&quot; searches, roving wiretaps, gaining personal information from libraries, bookstores and ISPs (which are prohibited from revealing that they even provided any information about their customers). &nbsp;The article also lists some of the abuses of the act where people that had no links to terrorism were subject to surveillance and intimidation.<br />I also see that there is a lot of opposition to the law by both Republicans and Democrats. &nbsp;I find it strange that the first Act was signed by Bush immediately after the capture of Sadam Hussein who is generally believed now not to have had any links with September 11th or Al Queda.<br /><br />http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/07/21/patriot.act/<br /><br />or &nbsp; &nbsp;http://tinyurl.com/88zxw<br /><br />http://rawstory.com/news/2005/democrats_dissent_patriot_act_721<br /><br />or &nbsp; &nbsp;http://tinyurl.com/csdta<br /><br /><br />Here is another article from the L.A. Daily News that states that, &quot;The Senate voted unanimously Friday to make permanent virtually all the main provisions of the law known as the USA Patriot Act...&quot; and also, &quot;The House passed a bill of its own last week that would also extend the law's surveillance and law enforcement powers...&quot;. &nbsp;However, there is also talk of Republican leaders agreeing to install civil-rights safeguards.<br /><br />http://www.dailynews.com/Stories/0,1413,200~20954~2988186,00.html<br /><br />or<br /><br />http://tinyurl.com/a5f7t<br /><br />I must confess that I'm feeling a little bit skeptical about the whole deal especially after being assured by the authorities in the aftermath of 9/11 that Americans would not be expected to give up their basic freedoms or alter their traditional values in order to feel a little &quot;safer&quot;.<br /><br />Let's keep this dialogue going,<br />&nbsp;----Zeno

				Yes, the whole act was renewed, with the exception of 2 out of 16 &quot;sunset&quot; clauses which were set to expire this year providing that the &quot;Crisis&quot; was over. &nbsp;It will be another &quot;10&quot; years before these provisions will come up for revision or dismissal.<br />&nbsp; However, many parts of the act were up for revision even though their institution became &quot;permanent&quot;.<br /><br />&nbsp; For example: the law granting the Justice department to investigate library records and bookstore purchases of individuals without a warrant must now first be granted permission (in writing) by the director of the F.B.I.<br /><br />&nbsp; These surveillance initiatives are really the tip of the iceberg however. &nbsp;What seems to me to be even more frightening is that under this act it will (has) become perfectly legal to detain ANY alien or someone of less than citizen status for indefinite periods of time while totally circumventing the right to a formal trial or even the right to even be formally charged with a crime; IOW, due process.<br /><br />&nbsp; Many, at this moment, are languishing in prison without being able to communicate with family or even an attorney for extended periods of time. <br />What is even more disturbing is that many of these so-called &quot;threats&quot; have been released (after serving several years) without ever have been charged and not so much as an apology. &nbsp;In addition to this, many (if not all) have been tortured.<br /><br />&nbsp; But, I digress. &nbsp;These so-called &quot;records of abuse&quot; are wholeheartedly denied by the proponents of this law just as global warming as a now established scientific Fact has until this year also been denied by this administration. &nbsp;Once, a long long time ago, the Earth was also Flat.<br /><br />&nbsp; Anyone disagree? &nbsp;I'm really not 100% sure I have all my facts straight.<br />But my overall impression is that the repassing of this Law forebodes something very ominous for us all in the near future. &nbsp;Wiretapping someone's phone in the not so distant past was once considered a gross violation... now it seems to be taken for granted as standard operation procedure.<br />&nbsp;<br />----Zeno

				Ok, I have no idea what I can add. &nbsp;I'll critique the last link....<br /><br />It was amusing, but it was really only a readers digest look at the patriot act. &nbsp;It's worth taking the time to watch for entertainment value but only marginally useful in informing on the topic.<br /><br />The use of the concept of what a common person would do was hopefully something the general public will be able to relate to. &nbsp;The idea of trying to stop &quot;the bad guys&quot; is indeed admirable, but the problem as in all aspects of life crops up in the execution and serious consideration needs to be given to cost/benefit. &nbsp;Every goverment agent you give these sweeping powers (i.e., sneak and peak, etc.) will use them only as well as his character will allow. &nbsp;Someone is bound to do something bad and to what end? &nbsp;In the hope that we MIGHT catch a bad guy? &nbsp;Not worth it to me. &nbsp;'Nuff said. &nbsp;Someone else give some insight.

				Well, I had hoped there would have been more discussion here in humble, yet amazingly cosmopolitan Astoria, concerning not only the imminent Eclipse of human rights (now soon to be codified by law with utmost finality) but what we as individuals can do to change it. &nbsp;From the short time that I've been here (a little over a year) I have met many a diverse and stimulating individual, all seemingly ready to speak up, stand out and do what they really believe to be right. &nbsp;I have no illusions about the general awareness of my brethren. &nbsp;I really believe that 90% of the people I meet in the street really knows what is &quot;going on&quot; and are yearning for something better.<br /><br />So why the silence?<br /><br />Is it guilt? Don't be. &nbsp;No one is to blame.<br />Is it apathy? &nbsp;I don' think so, after observing first hand the industry of my fellow Astorians, I know it cannot be apathy.<br />Is it callousness? &nbsp;It cannot be. &nbsp;Everyone I have met here has shown some sign of humanity and sensitivity to one another's pain or joy.<br /><br />So why the silence?<br /><br />It must be fear. In fact, I know it is. How do I know? I feel it in my bones. I know it pervades our lives. &nbsp;I know it because every time I watch the news or even look at the weather section in the newspaper I can see very clearly and very concretely painted in yellow or orange color codes the <em>level</em> of my fear. &nbsp;When policy in England is to shoot first (maybe seven times in the head) and ask questions later and to examine our own country and see the similarities that are oh so close, to know that when the cops and private security fear the terrorists, when private citizens fear the cops <em>and</em> the terrorists, when our own President cowers in fear of his own constituents surrounded by a contingent of bodyguards rivaling the ancient Julian emperors of Rome, and to see every nation on earth cower in fear of Him as if He were the undisputed Master of the Universe, &nbsp;When torture has become mainstream serial television, when due process has become a joke and the constitution and the bill of rights are nothing more than &quot;quaint&quot; dreams of an ancient past, when ethnic cleansing happens almost unnoticed and words like genocide provoke no emotional response, when slavery is demoted to a buzzword of the disenfranchised and has no real bearing on how we live <em>today</em>, when War becomes something to be desired and enthusiastically participated in by children who only want to make us proud,<br />I know that time has come to fear.<br /><br />I envision a world where there is no killing, no slavery, no poverty, no slandering, no snitching, no disease, no waste... only creativity, love and the pursuit of wisdom, empathy and understanding, where diplomacy and not brute force is considered the best way (ethically and economically) to solve our differences. A world where the freedom to speak is reasserted each and every day by excercising that &quot;inalienable&quot; right, without regard to the consequences, without regard to what people may think of us or want to do to us, without regard to the tyrant of the hour or the corporate superstructure that rewards or punishes us, and with knowledge of the absurdity of how they may condemn us for being who we cannot help but be; that is, who we <em>are</em>, in this, our Precious land of freedom and democracy, or Republic, if you will.<br /><br />However, I am not so blinded by my own dreams or ideals that I am willing to step upon the dragon. &nbsp;I am not so unrealistic as to believe that one individual shouting to a nation of sheep will make him or her any more safe or less lonely. &nbsp;With all conscience, I too must bow down to all powerful fear. &nbsp;Self-preservation inevitably wins out over ideals and precocious dreams of how the world <em>should</em> be.<br />So, my fellow Astorians, as one individual to another, as one American to another (I do consider myself a patriot) I am making an active decision to only talk about &quot;safe&quot; things from now on, thereby relegating this cold, lifeless Topic to the dead-letter box to which it so obviously belongs.<br />And in so doing, I'll let a little piece of me die while saving my own proverbial neck from the scrutiny of Big Brother and soon to be by extension, you're own crushing disapproval.<br /><br />Peace and Love be with you all,<br /><br />----Zeno.

				I didn't mean to be so harsh or so pompous, but you have to admit, that long and tiresome post did elicit a response ;-)<br /><br />The tiredness thing I can understand. &nbsp;With all that has happened in the last few years, New Yorkers have been through a lot. Unfortunately, the machinery of oppression never rests. I feel that our morale is being worn down intentionally, just like our shock over the attacks on September 11, has been used to manipulate us successfully. To let our country go without even a word of protest is to justify the use of these tactics of intimidation and fear which will only pave the way to more abuse. We don't have to be a part of this sick process.<br /><br />This link serves as a great source for news concerning the Act as well as a portal to other resources, one that I think we should pay attention to each and every day our freedom is threatened. &nbsp;Once that law is signed by Mr. Bush there may be no going back. &nbsp;Right now it's the subway, tommorow it will be our homes.

				Title: <strong>Intelligent Design</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>merm</strong> on <strong>August 10, 2005, 02:24:25 PM</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				I saw something on CSPAN this morning that I found interestingly disturbing:<br /><br />They had the Presdient of some &quot;Liberty Association&quot; (the &quot;conservative&quot;) and put him against the president of some &quot;Association for separation of church and state&quot; or something like that (the &quot;liberal&quot;)<br /><br />Then they launched into the debate over Intelligent Design (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design).<br /><br />This whole debate started long ago (some would say thousands of years ago with Cicero's &quot;Watchmaker analogy.&quot; (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmaker_analogy) (Which basically says that if one were walking along the beach and came upon a fully-functional pocket watch lying in the sand, think that it just came about entirely by chance [and thus even natural selection it is argued])<br /><br />Ok, so back to the debate: On the right you had a &quot;conservative Christian&quot; who was arguing for intelligent design from the perspective that &quot;God&quot; created the world. And on the left you had this guy that was over and over saying that the &quot;theory&quot; of Intelligent Design isn't scientific, and that it was religion.<br /><br />What struck me was this:<br /><br />While the &quot;liberal&quot; was talking he was bringing up points (against ID) such as:<br />- We don't have time to try and figure out if ID is right, there are too many other important issues to be discovered in science right now. <br />- What will this &quot;open the door&quot; for in the future? Religion being taught in schools?!<br />- ID isn't scientific.<br /><br />The conservative kept playing right into all his traps, even expressing his own &quot;beliefs&quot; about what an intelligent designer might be (&quot;God&quot;) and saying that ID should be taught in schools because lots of people believe that way in the U.S. Then, later he actually defended Jerry Falwell as being non-political and &quot;good.&quot;<br /><br />I was about to pull my hair out.<br /><br />I don't feel threatened by Intelligent Design; because if you read about it you will see that intelligent design has <em>absolutely nothing</em> to do with &quot;God.&quot; Intelligent design is NOT a &quot;new&quot; argument, this is stuff that has been around for a very long time, and the principals that it is based upon are completely valid within the scientific community in most cases.<br /><br />Take for instance in archeology, when you come across a stone that is oddly shaped. Scientists use well accepted scientific methods to determine if the rock was naturally &quot;carved&quot; that way, or if an external force (intentional or non-intentional) caused the rock to be carved that way. When it comes to things like this, the pyramids, stonehenge etc, it's relatively easy for us to determine these things probably did not happen &quot;naturally&quot;, but that some external cause is responsible (humans in this case.) Intelligent Design theory simply applies well settled scientific method in biology, specifically molecular biology, and comes to the conclusion that Darwinian natural selection does not adequately describe the specified complexity exibihited at this level. ID goes on to say that the specified complexity we observe is best and most simply described by some external cause (intentional or non-intentional.)<br /><br />Ok here is what is upsetting to me. First, ID does not, nor has it ever as I understand it, tried to prove there is a &quot;God.&quot; It only evaluates the data, and applies a non-Darwinian method, and comes to a different answer. Christians are going crazy trying to make the irrational and illogical leap that this means &quot;God&quot; exists. NO IT DOESN'T. Even if ID is &quot;correct&quot; the external cause could have been intentional, or NON-intentional. This is just pure manipulation, and I don't stand for it.<br /><br />But on the other side you have these &quot;liberals&quot; who are doing the SAME thing. They are saying that ID is &quot;religion&quot; and &quot;all about God.&quot; It's NOT about God, you are LEGITIMIZING THE CONSERVATIVES POSITION WHEN YOU SAY THAT! It is NOT about God. For all we know the &quot;intelligent designer&quot; could have been a UFO traveling by and the drivers needed to take a load off and shat on earth before speeding away to another dimmension. ID does NOT disagree with &quot;evolution&quot; entirely per-se, it just disagrees with Darwinian evolution as it relates to the &quot;origin&quot; of species, saying that natural selection cannot account for the specified complexity at the cellular level. Darwinian approaches break down at this level (aparently.) They are just saying that there was an external cause that cannot, and is not currently explained by evolution.<br /><br />Anyway. I wanted to call in and just tell that liberal guy that he's really a conservative after hearing him say &quot;we don't have time for this&quot; and &quot;what will this open the door to.&quot; This is the same thing conservatives say. &quot;We don't have time for people to decide to be a democracy, we need to force it.&quot; And &quot;oh my, can you imagine what will happen if we allow gays to marry, they'll want to marry animals next.&quot; This is pure fear-mongering and manipulation and I'm tired of it from both &quot;sides.&quot;<br /><br />I'm against Christians trying to push ID as an agenda into public schools to try and get creation taught. But I'm EQUALLY against scientists who write off the entire ID theory as &quot;religion&quot; that's pure dogma on BOTH their parts. I don't &quot;believe&quot; in evolution, and I neither do I think Intelligent Design solves the problem, but that doesn't mean I'm ready to throw the baby out with the bathwater on both of them. Is there no such thing as non-partisan discussion anymore? Everything seems to be either the &quot;Christians&quot; are hjacking the nation, or the &quot;Liberals&quot; are hijacking our morals. I'm wondering if there's anyone else who isn't afraid to just say &quot;I don't know - but let's talk about it.&quot; It's like we're afraid if we don't pretend to have all the answers for our kids in school, or in our own lives that we're somehow weak or something. I don't know - now I'm just rambling.<br /><br />Anyone else thought about this?

				A most excellent post merm.<br /><br />There are many theories of evolution just as there are many theories of creationsism, for example:<br /><br />A says: Jehovah created this.<br /><br />B says: No, Baal created that.<br /><br />C says: You're both wrong, a dual entity Ahuramazda/Ahrimanes in constant flux creates and destroys both of them.<br /><br />or,<br /><br />A states: Survival through competition.<br /><br />B states: No, survival of species through symbiosis.<br /><br />C states: No, recombinant genetic material is totally random.<br /><br />ad infinitum...<br /><br />What I think that this so-called &quot;debate&quot; and many debates boil down to is this...<br /><br />There are two functions of every human brain, i.e.<br /><br />The Thinker,<br />and<br />The Prover.<br /><br />It is the Thinker's job to think up ideas no matter how irrational, rational or outlandish, in order to better understand the chaos of sense impressions which we can for the moment call &quot;reality&quot;.<br />It is the Prover's job to find evidence in support of and to either manipulate or eliminate evidence that is contrary to what the thinker thinks.<br /><br />Add to this the emotional component of intellectual &quot;territory&quot; and how passionately world paradigms are defended and/or promulgated, then we can see two separate schools of &quot;thinkers&quot; using the same datum as Proof positive that conforms to one another's agenda of what is and what should be &quot;correct&quot;, no matter how diverse or diametrically opposed they be.<br />If one side gains the upper hand in the assimilation of an idea then that idea is most summarily (and easily) rejected by the opponent.<br /><br />The possibilty that the datum may not conform to either paradigm or may support a third or fourth paradigm or even by it's nature not lend itself to conformity to ANY paradigm (as yet thought up of) holds no interest for the battling entities in question.<br /><br />I have to think about this topic deeper. &nbsp;It is a problem that has been around for quite a long while, but many problems <em>do</em> have a synthesising solution, in my, &nbsp;maybe overoptimistic <em>belief</em>.<br /><br />----zeno<br /><br />P.S.: Add to this quagmire that &quot;datums&quot; for all intents and purposes are effectively (to us at any rate, at this moment in temporal flux) infinite in number, to prove anything or to graduate any hypothesis/theory into absolute and all encompassing Law, is imho, a futile excercise at best.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />&quot;Each of us<br />A cell of awareness<br />Imperfect and incomplete<br />Genetic blends<br />With uncertain ends<br />On a fortune hunt<br />That’s far too fleet...&quot;<br /><br />----Peart, Lee &amp; Lifeson

We have plenty of people for that.&quot; endquote.<br /><br />Well, I went home a little more (alledgedly) drunk than usual, feeling a little less &quot;safe&quot; and frankly not giving a damn, a little more alienated, a little more displaced, and quite frankly, a little more depressed than usual.<br /><br />Hopefully, I'll wake up tomorrow having forgot that this enlightened conversation ever took place.<br /><br />----zeno.

				I got to say that even though this small discussion group hasn't got much in the way of response, I am overjoyed at the number of views it has received; 420 + and counting. :-) And all in the space of a few weeks, so now I Know I'm not speaking into the wind. :-)<br />Sometimes with the lack of observable evidence my imagination gets away with me... &nbsp;and for that, I apologize. :-i<br /><br />Maybe the subject matter was too broad, rather than focussing on specifics.<br />In my overzealousness I had imagined a forum within a forum, neglecting the fact that there were already many posts besides (until I had actually read them through).<br /><br />When Americans get together we can really accomplish wonders. &nbsp;It's just too bad that our duly elected officials sometimes think otherwise. &nbsp;Folly is easy to forgive in a child.<br /><br />It's reflections such as these that keep me personally optimistic,<br />So good night and sweet dreams my gentle Astorians,<br />May we all wake tomorrow, into a better day, ;-)<br />The future is ours.<br /><br />zeno

				Zeno,<br /><br />I think what you are trying to do is a good thing, and it should be continued. &nbsp;As far as the amount of responses goes, I would attribute that to the huge scope of the thread, as well as a small bit of 'preaching to the choir' syndrome. &nbsp;Most of the people on this list seem bent pretty heavily to the left ... or at least, most of us here agree that the war is bad, Bush is a puppet, Bush's cronies and Lockheed Martin are running the country, etc, etc.<br /><br />Yet there are so many things to discuss in the realm of world and local affairs, that it would be wrong to say &quot;Well, we're all on the same side, so there's no need to discuss it anymore&quot;. &nbsp; <br /><br />I would suggest a new top level category for the board, &quot;Local and World Affairs&quot;.<br /><br />This would give us a place to, for example, rant about a particular article in the times, converse with council member Vallone, or have an in depth discussion on the ethics of cloning your pet. &nbsp;Most of these posts end up in the &quot;General Astoria Discussion&quot; category, and that category is simply too broad.<br /><br />My two cents.<br /><br />-m

				you know, zeno (and other interested parties), it might be nice to have a weekly discussion - focus on something very specific, perhaps even an essay or article to read beforehand (not more than a couple, then you lose people who don't have a lot of time to commit). &nbsp;<br /><br />The specific is always more interesting than the general. &nbsp;<br /><br />i'd be up for hanging out with a cup of tea and discussing essays by betrand russell, nicholas kristoff, molly ivins, maureen dowd or wendy kaminer. &nbsp;one at a time, though.

				Thank you guys and gals for the contructive input. I think I'm going to start a topic strictly devoted to the PATRIOT Act and it's related abuses, this for me (at the moment) has become quite obsessive and like any other obsessions has been given priority over other aspects of my life in a rather unhealthy manner. <br /><br />It wasn't until hindsight that I saw that the scope of this topic was too large for people to digest, lacking focus and diffuse. Unfortunately I'm about to make the same mistake again for another general type of topic, this one having to do with tech.<br /><br />Cloudnine and Merm started a topic that made me jump with joyful enthusiasm, but the topic was also kind of specific, which is kind of different from my free-association scatterbrain type mentality. ;-)<br /><br />I also tend to compartmentalize things into rather large categories to avoid getting confused. Something about specialization fills me with dread, I don't know why. It probably has to do with that old Rip Van Winkle folktale I heard as a child. Also something in me sincerely desires to drop the whole political category altogether once all of the problems have been solved, but I guess this is pretty unrealistic not mention naive):-/ .<br /><br />Anyway cloudnine, I understand the &quot;preaching to the choir syndrome&quot; that you speak of, but my original intention wasn't to convince but to Organize. I was well aware that the majority of New Yorkers agree with me on this particular topic, but I found the lack of protest, demonstrations, communication and solidarity quite frightening. This to me was either due to apathy or fear. Apathy, I can deal with, but the fear component is what really bothers me. If people are afraid to speak and demonstrate publicly their outrage over real or percieved injustices then we might as well live under a dictatorial regime. Trust me, right now I'm quite cynical on that score, but I have found that cynicism doesn't conduce itself well toward contructive change, which is really what we need right now.<br />Some previous posts of mine were quite negative and preachy, and for that I apologize. It wasn't my intention to try and make people feel bad... in fact that sort of system (of exploitation and shame) is exactly what I'm/We're against.<br /><br />If the future can only be imagined in bleak terms then why bother at all.<br />I refuse to believe in a future that is set in stone or that a television series depicting a possible future can decide that future, and when I look around at the present I see alot of good in people, &nbsp;much more in fact than I was originally lead to believe.<br />I guess it comes to what we choose to focus on. [Statement coming...]<br />And there is Choice.<br /><br />And as far as enigmacat's idea of forming a discussion group, I am all for it. I must confess that alot of the authors she mentions are not known by me, and this is probably what cloudnine was getting at. But, hey, all the more reason for me to get involved and actually try to learn something new.<br /><br />Again, unfortunately, the specific topic of the PATRIOT Act is taking precedence in my list of priorities, only because of the time factor involved. The window of opportunity to protest it is now rapidly closing, so if the readers of this board feel the same way, I would like to get together <br />to meet and discuss this issue in person with the proprieter's of Freeze Peache's permission of course.<br /><br />And to all of you out there who are puzzled by the law (130+ pages) or who know nothing about it's history, don't feel intimidated; I'm no lawyer and I'm in the same boat as far as bewilderment is concerned.<br /><br />Again, I thank all of you again.<br />You have shown me that I'm not alone in this and that there <em>is</em> hope.<br /><br />Peace be with all of you,<br /><br />zeno.

In a federation, unlike in a &nbsp;unitary state, the self-governing status of autonomous regions is constitutionally entrenched and cannot be revoked by a unilateral decision of the central government.

Tricky because (with some notable exceptions) the Democrats have failed to oppose and even supported the Republican’s militaristic imperial policy. The exceptions on both sides do not change the fact that both Republicans and Democrats together are supporting this war and the huge imperial military budget.
