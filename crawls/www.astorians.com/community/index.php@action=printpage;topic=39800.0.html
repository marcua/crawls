				It looks like the new korean BBQ place will be opening soon. I saw they put up a sign that says I think Pelicano.&nbsp; I&#039;m excited about this new restaurant opening right under the Ditmars train station

				Greetings Braun ~<br /><br /><br />Opened finally last week.&nbsp; It was crowded the day I went after work (Wednesday) but went for take-out.&nbsp; Since they advertise &quot;premium chicken,&quot; I wanted to at least try it once since I found it a bit pricey.<br /><br /><br />Would I try it again?&nbsp; I might.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t too bad.&nbsp; I had the chicken teriyaki w/rice and it had a side green salad included w/truffle dressing for it.&nbsp; My thought was that it would not be filling but it was.<br /><br /><br />The Columbian place across the street is better and much needed in our area since we don&#039;t really have any latin american food places nearby (that I&#039;m aware of).<br /><br /><br />C&#039;iao for now ~<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;ll have to try it and see how pricey they are.&nbsp; I also have to try the colombian place.&nbsp; Right now my favorite restaurant is the Brazilian place Kilo.&nbsp; You really get your money&#039;s worth there and the food is delicious.&nbsp; I go there every weekend.

				I read a few bad reviews on Yelp so now I&#039;m not so sure I even want to try this place.&nbsp; First they say it&#039;s expensive and then they say there is bad service and you don&#039;t get your money&#039;s worth.&nbsp; Someone said they dont&#039; think they will last long in Astoria and that they have a menu that says lunch specials but then when you get there there they don&#039;t honor the lunch special. I changed my mind about wanting to try this place.

				Pelicana is a chain in Korea. I don&#039;t think they are traditional Korean BBQ (hotpot). Their specialty is KFC--Korean fried chicken, which in my opinion is the best fried chicken ever. The thing to order here isn&#039;t a chicken dish like chicken teriyaki but wings (and beer if they serve it). Very excited to try out this place since K-Town is too far for me these days.
