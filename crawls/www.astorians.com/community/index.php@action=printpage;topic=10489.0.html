				I&#039;ve never been though altho I drove passed it a million times to the Rockaways. Has anyone ever been ? <br /><br />I&#039;m thinking it would be a nice nature walk when the weather clears, maybe the weekend of 5/24 ? Anyone interested ?

				I checked it out and it is a beautiful peaceful nature walk -a nice 1 hour hike lots of birds and ducks. Highly recommend it. Will do it again as a pre-beach activity

				It is just the place for a Goldfish boy to find quiet.<br /><br />If I make the trek again I will pm you but sometimes I&#039;m spur of the moment. At this time of year - I&#039;ll more likely go straight to Rockaways

				I was there back in the days when the Concord was still flying.&nbsp; <br />1.&nbsp; The Wildlife Refuge really <em>is</em> a beautiful area.<br />2.&nbsp; The Concord really <em>was </em> loud.<br /><br />Please go again, soon, and take me!&nbsp; It&#039;s a difficult place to get to by public transportation.

				We went last year. Had never been before and have to say that it was a beauty of a park. Nature and wildlife everywhere. I think it&#039;s what the wetlands around NY looked like 200 yrs ago. You get to walk on paths skirting inlets, marsh and bays. As you walk around one bend you see geese flying overhead, tall grasses ringing the inlet and then off in the distance the gleaming top of the Empire State building off in the distance.&nbsp; The place is serene and awesome.&nbsp; Very safe, good parking in a lot and not that far away (by car on an off time).
