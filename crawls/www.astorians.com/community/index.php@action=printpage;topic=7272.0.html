				I love poker, just moved back to Astoria recently. I heard about a Monday night $20 buy-in cash game with usually 5-6 people in it. Going this Monday to play in it assuming the guy gives me a call. <br /><br />If that fails maybe we can start up a regular friendly game with random people some day during the week.<br /><br />I generally prefer doing a $20 buy-in tournament instead of cash games. You get more play for less money, can only lose a certain amount and can always win a lot and the evening has a pre-defined &quot;end&quot; whereas some cash games can go all night. Of course, we usually do a $10 buy-in &quot;loser&quot; bracket tournament.

				Can&#039;t do this Monday here either.&nbsp; &nbsp; I mean I can, but with the Tues Wingtacular and the Sat Indigo meet-up, I can&#039;t manage to miss another evening at my building.&nbsp; &nbsp; It&#039;s amazing how little stuff piles up unless you stay on top of it.<br /><br />Damn, I hate being responsible sometimes.

				I don&#039;t play, but saw this and must&nbsp; mention a bit of trivia for the Astoria people who are poker fans&nbsp; here.&nbsp; Stu Ungar, 3 times World Series of poker winner, was always in Astoria in the 1970&#039;s.&nbsp; Not playing in any games, but practicing Gin, poker, and other games in his friend&#039;s house here.&nbsp; He never hung out in area though, just up friend&#039;s house.&nbsp; Also, I used to bring bunch of friends from Astoria park to a game in city where he played (we went for the food)&nbsp; we were teenagers, and when my friends would see him playing they would ask &quot;why &#039;s that little kid playing poker (Stuey was 23, looked 12)<br /><br />If you are asking &quot;who is stu ungar?&quot;&nbsp; then&nbsp; nevermind.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />
