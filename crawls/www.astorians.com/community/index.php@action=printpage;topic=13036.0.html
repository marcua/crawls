				I have a huge, plastic Mets cup full of change and I was wondering if that Coinstar machine is still at Commerce (now TD) bank on Steinway. The threads I found on the subject are on the old side, so I don&#039;t feel horrible about starting a new topic. Or is there any other place to exchange coins without having to roll them into those paper things? If anyone knows, could they please post before 6 tonight? That&#039;s when my internet communication will cease for a few days.&nbsp; :wink:<br /><br />Thanks!<br />

				Use the Penny Arcade at TD Bank.&nbsp; It&#039;s still there (if it&#039;s working that day).&nbsp; I didn&#039;t roll my coins and it worked fine.&nbsp; You might call ahead to see if the machine is working though, if it&#039;s a heavy amount to carry.

				Yes on the Commerce/TD Bank Penny Arcade. But don&#039;t get it confused with Coinstar because I believe Coinstar takes a percentage of your dollars. Also, if you want a real bank as opposed to a plastic Mets cup, count the money ahead of time and guess it on the machine. Actually I don&#039;t know if they&#039;ll do this now that it&#039;s not Commerce bank anymore (they had a C bank before) but maybe you&#039;ll win some other kind of prize.
