				There is as 28 minutes BBC broadcast from 9/11/01 where they were covering the collapse of the twin towers. They then went further to report on the collapse of WTC 7 (Soloman Bros Building). The problem is they reported this news about 20 minutes before the collapse of WTC 7 actually transpired. There is even a live broadcast with a correspondent (about 15 minutes into the video) where you can still see the standing WTC 7 building on the right of the woman reporting. The collapse happened right after she went off the air (was cut off). I would say that this only adds the the conspiracy theory that at least building 7 was possibly destroyed intentionally.<br /><br />BBC video 9/11/01 (http://&quot;http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=49f_1172526096&quot;)

				It was. It was in serious danger of falling and hurting a lot of people, and compromising the rescue(s)(ers) in/on the big pile. So the powers that be, decided that it had to be taken down in a controlled situation. I have a friend who used to work in WTC 7, who was called and told what was to be done. No-one was given an opportunity to get their personal belongings out. If you didn&#039;t take everything with you when the building was evacuated, it all went down with the building.

				If that is so, then why is the government still insisting that WTC 7 collapsed on it&#039;s own accord? This is what keeps all the conspiracy theorists stories alive and kicking. I&#039;m by no means a specialist, but I&#039;ve seen images of the damage to WTC 7, and it was minimal, and basically on one side only, and it didn&#039;t have the immense weight or size of the twin towers, so collapse did not appear emminent.

				You only saw it from the outside. The inside exhibited all the structural damage. All accounts tell of the building squeaking and swaying. There was millions upon millions of dollars of equipment lost in it&#039;s collapse. Can anyone really believe that there was some kind of conspiracy involved? We all watched it on TV. We all heard the same story from all the networks around the world covering the story. We knew at least 30 minutes before it came down, that it would be happening.

				I thought this was going to be about the new 7 WTC! What a great building. Looks great from the outside, and is a really wonderful space inside. Elegant lobby, what with the poetry on the screen behind the security. Super-cool elevators. And unbelievable views through the floor-to-ceiling windows. If you ever get a chance, it&#039;s totally worth visiting.<br />

				I was at the new WTC7 a couple of weeks ago on a business meeting, the view of towards the East River is really something.

				As an added bonus, the new WTC 7 isn&#039;t in the middle of Greenwich Street, like the old one was.&nbsp;

As I remember it, the building was on fire, no? It was built up on massive supplies of Con Ed fuel oil, no? Seems to me it was going either going to be a complete wreck or come down anyway.<br /><br />NYCMacUser is right. We, the public, only saw what was happening on the outside, and most us from a comfortable position in front of a TV screen. <br /><br />Is it that you think ‘The Government’ destroyed the building to make the attack look worse than it was – do you really think that was necessary? I would argue that it was already ‘worse’ as soon as the first plane hit. <br />
