				What gym do you belong to and what is the price and agreement terms ( 1/yr contract is $x/month, monthly payment is $x amount, etc)? I moved to Astoria kind of recently and really want to join a gym but it seems everything is pretty pricey. I paid $35/month at LA Fitness, but I understand it&#039;s not going to be like that here. I just don&#039;t want to (and can&#039;t) pay $100/month plus $200 initiation fee. <br /><br />Also, has anyone had any luck with negotiating? My friend who lives in Flushing has negotiated his gym rate more than once, but in the research I&#039;ve done already, I have seen pretty much the price be consistent. (-ly high). Although I haven&#039;t really found much price info. Also, please share your experiences with each gym; how long you&#039;ve been going, types of people there (meatheads, old ladies, ditzes in spandex barely breaking a sweat while chatting on their cell phones, etc...)<br /><br />Thanks in advance!

				If you have health insurance you should check to see if they have any agreements with the gyms in the area.&nbsp; I know that a lot of them seem to be doing this nowadays.

				I&#039;ve had memberships at the NY Sports Club on 30th and Steinway and at Club Fitness. Those memberships run around 80/month. I think you should be able to avoid the initiation fee, though. I think it was automatically waived at both places when I signed up. <br /><br />Astoria Sports Complex charges something like $250 for a year. It is seriously No. Frills. And I got really pissed at the owner because when I signed up I misunderstood something, and tried to get him to change my membership accordingly - not only did he refuse to change it he was very condescending. &quot;You have an opportunity to make a choice here.... &quot; It made me so angry that though I couldn&#039;t get out of my membership that year as soon as it was over I signed with another gym. However, that&#039;s just me. And they do have a pool. *shrug*<br /><br />There are a couple of other cheaper gyms in the area - I think both Finess Point and Synergy have pretty reasonable rates, but I&#039;ve never checked them out myself.<br /><br />I once did a tour at Lucille Roberts. I really just wanted to know the price, and when I called to ask they signed me up to take a tour. OK. I showed up, let the CSR walk me all over the gym and show me everything. Then she sat me down with some paperwork and told me there was a big sale going on but it ended THAT day and I needed to sign right then. I said I was just shopping around and didn&#039;t even have my wallet with me. She had a mini meltdown. It was kind of funny but also seriously turned me off that place.

				Also, NY Sports Club has a no cell phones rule but as far as I could see they don&#039;t enforce it at all.<br /><br />Club Fitness also has a no cell phone rule - and so far I&#039;ve only seen one person using the phone, so maybe they&#039;re a bit better about it.

				The program through my insurance company is www.globalfit.com. &nbsp;I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s open to everyone, but you can try. &nbsp;You didn&#039;t say what part of Astoria you live in, as location is so important when you choose a gym! &nbsp;<br /><br />I have 2 gym memberships:<br /><br />Fitness Point: &nbsp;Insanely cheap... Last summer I signed up for some kind of &quot;buy a year, get 2 months free&quot; thing and I remember it broke down to be about $17 a month. &nbsp;Of course, you get what you pay for... &nbsp; It used to be full of broken machines, but recently I have noticed all new treadmills and they&#039;ve fixed their ellipticals. &nbsp;Honestly, I&#039;m afraid to try the weight machines because I&#039;d rather not injure myself.. but I&#039;d let someone else comment on them who has used them. &nbsp;Gym is kind of dirty, but you should know better than to touch anything and then not wash your hands... &nbsp;It&#039;s located on 34th Ave/28th Street and is really close to my apt, so I rush in there when I don&#039;t have that much time or it&#039;s raining. &nbsp;They have 2 friendly staff members, and the rest will ignore you. &nbsp;Locker rooms are creepy (at least women&#039;s is) and I wouldnt recommend showering there. &nbsp;I&#039;ve never noticed meatheads, but you will see the occasional idiot on their cell phone while doing cardio (which means they need to move their fat a** a little faster), but unfortunately, those are everywhere. &nbsp;They don&#039;t seem to realize that others really, really do not care to hear their conversation! &nbsp;I also saw a woman walking on the treadmill while holding her purse on her shoulder, which I thought was really odd..<br /><br />Synergy: &nbsp;I like Synergy, but many people do not. &nbsp;Staff there is friendly, but several also will try to sign you up for personal training at an additional cost (solution: &nbsp;politely say no--they&#039;ve stopped asking me awhile ago). &nbsp;I originally was going to join Synergy through the globalfit insurance program, and the price on there was something like a &nbsp;$50 activation plus $14 every 2 weeks, I think. &nbsp;I decided to go in there and check it out first. &nbsp;They had some kind of deal going on for $35 a month (you probably see the flyers everywhere!) but I said I&#039;d go through globalfit if they couldnt match the price. &nbsp;Final price was $30 a month with no activation fee. &nbsp;I&#039;ve heard about problems with Synergy auto-renewing you and continuing to charge your credit card if you do the monthly charge (don&#039;t know if this is true), so I just prepaid the entire year-$360. &nbsp;As far as the gym goes, I like it. &nbsp;They have nice, new cardio equipment (including those dumb tvs on top of the machines that I have no use for!) and a decent, well-maintained selection of weight machines/free weights. &nbsp;There are some meatheads, but I don&#039;t mind them--at least they&#039;re there really working out! &nbsp;A few dumb girls in spandex not really doing anything... not so many that they really get in your way, though. &nbsp;I have seen some idiots on cell phones... and have encountered a few that offended with their extremely strong perfume or old man odor. &nbsp;Again, though--that&#039;s everywhere. &nbsp;Oh and Synergy is located at Broadway and Crescent St.<br /><br />No matter what they say, you can always negotiate. &nbsp;They do not want you to walk out the door without buying. &nbsp;Even if you really don&#039;t go to the insurance website, say you did and that you will not pay more. &nbsp;At least get them to drop that stupid activation fee (which, if you think about it--you&#039;re paying a fee so that you can start paying them every month?). &nbsp;<br /><br />Good luck and gyms are one of my favorite topics--so feel free to ask anything else!

				The thing I like about Matrix is that there is a no-contract option, you can pay month-to-month (that&#039;s the option I&#039;m using).&nbsp; Additionally you can put your month-to-month membership on hold for up to three months per year if you won&#039;t be using the gym.

				&nbsp; Although there aren&#039;t any in Astoira, I must warn you to avoid Bally&#039;s AT ALL COSTS!!!!&nbsp; I can&#039;t say enough bad things about them and their horrid so-called customer service.&nbsp; I have had terrible personal experiences with them , and I have heard numerous stories from close friends who tried to cancel their memberships when they realized that certain benefits they were promised when they signed up weren&#039;t included in the membership plans they signed up for.

				When I signed up @ The Rock a bunch of years ago, my insurance covered the $200 initiation fee. I would never want to pay some b.s. &quot;activation fee&quot; even without the insurance.<br /><br />My original cost for The Rock is still in place (around $72) so as expensive as it is, I&#039;d hate to switch, also due to the convenience. They also allow you to stop payment for one month each year due to whatever (going away, illness, etc.) which I try to take advantage of.

				I also belong to the Rock- I signed up for a year commitment and pay $83/mo. They waived the initiation fee for me (I joined in Sept and they were having an end of summer sale).&nbsp; I usually work out in the mornings, so it&#039;s mostly seniors, other moms like me, and a few die hards that look like they spend a lot of time there.&nbsp; Not a meathead vibe at all though.&nbsp; But the scene may be different after work and on the weekends.<br />They offer a lot of great classes, if you are into that.&nbsp; Plus the machines are new, pristine, and plentiful.&nbsp; I have never showered there, but the locker rooms and bathrooms are clean.&nbsp; They also offer free childcare, if that applies to you. The babysitters are great.<br />Good luck with your search :)

				I&#039;m a big fan of Matrix.&nbsp; Last year a I paid a $129 initiation fee to get a cheaper monthly rate.&nbsp; My rate is $49.95 per month for life.&nbsp; It will never go up.&nbsp; I actually like it better than I liked NYSC and it is $30 cheaper per month.&nbsp; Like another poster said you can freeze it for 3 months every year.&nbsp; This is a good option for those who prefer to exercise outdoors in the summer.&nbsp; It also has extensive hours and free parking.

				I go to Fitness Point and am pretty satisfied with it. It&#039;s cheap, functional, and you don&#039;t have to deal with employees trying to hard sell you a personal trainer, convince you to renew, etc. <br /><br />I just renewed a few months ago for $160 for the year. I don&#039;t see why anyone would pay a $200 initiation fee when you can pay for an entire year at Fitness Point and have a year left over. The place is to say the least no frills but that&#039;s what I&#039;m looking for. I do a lot of free weights which are going to be pretty much the same anywhere. Sometimes there will be a broken weight machine or two around. They usually seem to fix them in about a week. The treadmills are usually fine but sometimes you&#039;ll see one that&#039;s pretty beat up. It doesn&#039;t matter whenever I&#039;m there as there&#039;s usually at least a half dozen to choose from.<br /><br />I agree with newastorian in that I would generally stay away from the locker rooms. The men&#039;s locker room has all the charm of a poorly maintained gas station bathroom. It doesn&#039;t really matter to me since a lot of times I&#039;ll just run home from the gym anyways, but if you are planning on going somewhere after the gym without going home you should keep this in mind.

				I&#039;m only going to throw in my quick two cents cuz no one mentioned the only gym in astoria I&#039;ve ever gone to. Evolution on 35th ave and 38th street (around the corner from Starshmucks)<br />They offered monthly or annually, I paid $600 for a year, now I believe it is $700. The monthly rate I&#039;m not positive on. The gym was very clean, I had no problem with the girls locker room, although the water temperature in the shower was fussy. They had a steam room and the bathroom was clean. I never saw an out-of-order machine, but sometimes the tvs on the treadmills did not work. The staff was nice, and they seemed to always be quick to help people who needed it, but I never saw them approach people for no reason. When I signed up apparently I was entitled to like an hour or whatever with a trainer for free, but frankly I wanted nothing to do with some stranger telling me how to do anything, and after a few weeks when one approached me with &#039;Excuse me, miss, have you had your complementary session with a trainer yet?&#039; and I said &#039;Thanks but I don&#039;t want one&#039; I was never approached again. There are a handful of guys who look like they live there, but they don&#039;t seem to be too clique-y and everyone mostly kept to themselves.

				Having worked out at both, I prefer club fitness, though I do not use their bike machines, treadmills, et cetera, so I cannot comment of those.&nbsp; Their only drawback is that their general workout room, which has the punching bags, weight balls and is the best place to do stomachs (i dislike their upstairs mini-ab area), is closed to general users when their classes are in session, something which occurs pretty much at 6 every weekday.&nbsp; If I wasn&#039;t lucky enough to get my workout done before 6, I wouldn&#039;t have joined that one.<br /><br />Their fees are pretty good.&nbsp; No joining fee.&nbsp; If you pay for a year up front, they give you a discount.&nbsp; Also 10% off for city and state employees, so it comes out to a shade about $60 per month.<br /><br />Enimgacat made a comment regarding cell phones.&nbsp; In club fitness, its always the same few meatheads who use the damn things.&nbsp; Aside from just busting up the rythmn of other peoples workouts, its just dangerous when they are not paying attention in the free weight area.&nbsp; One guy even uses it when he is working out with his trainer.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				AS said earlier Evolution is pretty good. My girlfriend was going to synergy way down on broadway and said it was filthy and they were always calling her for personal training sessions. I signed up for evolution around when it first opened, i pay 55 a month. its clean, the trainers will never bug you (or have never bugged me) the bathrooms are clean, the equipment is always working, really the only thingi can say is i wish they had a pool, but oh well. The owner is ALWAYS in there, hes a very hands on guy and if you have a question, problem or anything he&#039;s very receptive to anyone just walking up and talking to him. My girlfriend switched from synergy to evolution and paid all of her membership up front, which was like 550, they&#039;re usually running some deal if you want to pay it all up front, if not then its a year contract. I was a member at a brand new Gold Gym in virginia before i moved here and I have to say evolution is just as satisfying as the golds, same equipment, better service, but all on a smaller scale.

				I&#039;ve belonged to the Rock for five years. As someone said, yes, it is pricey but it&#039;s clean,<br />well-maintained and the variety of equipment and classes is great. <br /><br />They do belong to Global Fit if you have that option. They also give discounts to certain union<br />members -&nbsp; I know SAG was one, and I think police department staff also. You&#039;d have to ask.<br /><br />One thing they do allow is that if you want to pay in cash, they&#039;ll give you a cash discount. I make <br />two cash payments, one in the late fall and another a few months later. <br /><br />I also belonged to Synergy for a few years, but left because it was filthy. Mice running around in the<br />workout area, roaches in the locker room, etc. Plus they had very few classes and when I asked a <br />trainer if he was ACE certified, he asked what that meant.<br /><br />I toured Evolution just before it opened and it looked good. Nice layout, lots of equipment and the<br />people I talked to were friendly. If it was closer to me, I&#039;d have considered it more seriously.<br /><br />Location is key - luckily now in Astoria you have a few choices. You should go in and visit the<br />clubs you&#039;re interested in. The Rock will give you a three-day pass to try it out. I think others will too.<br /><br />You have to go when you would normally use the club to get a feel for it. <br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br />

				So I&#039;ve been at the Rock and while I like it, I know when I move down to 28th Ave and Crescent St that I won&#039;t hike up to Ditmars to exercise.<br /><br />Synergy sounds like the closest. NYSC has one on 30th Ave and Steinway.<br /><br />Are there any other gyms in that area? Where is Club Fitness?

				I could use a workout buddy!<br /><br />I mostly care about cleanliness and price. From there, I don&#039;t really use too many machines or care about classes. I just need a treadmill or eliptical occasionally and some free weights and mats. Eventually, I&#039;ll get my own and won&#039;t need a gym, but I don&#039;t have room at my house and getting out helps to motivate me.

				I recently joined Fitness Point because it&#039;s close to where I live. I&#039;ve been there a few times already and never had a problem. I see people cleaning off their benches and machines all the time, and one of the workers is usually going around the room wiping them down. I don&#039;t know if it matters that I go there during the day when it&#039;s not busy, but I&#039;ve seen some people bring their own towels to put over the benches if that helps. I like the place because it&#039;s really no frills and no one bugs you while you work out. I don&#039;t use the locker rooms because I live so close, but now I&#039;m curious to see what the men&#039;s room looks like compared with the women&#039;s! (The women&#039;s is kind of bare.)<br /><br />BTW, has anyone gone to the classes at Fitness Point? I keep meaning to go (they have Zumba!), but haven&#039;t had the chance. Thanks!

				There is a purpose to dropping weight and grunting... I know many dont care for it, but there is a reason behind it. That being said, I&#039;m pretty sure no one is Oly lifting in these places, and I&nbsp; know that a lot of d-bags are doing it to &quot;show-off&quot;. However I would question anyone who needs a gym that is &quot;quiet&quot;. Its a gym, not a library.

				Well, of course you cannot expect silence in a gym like a library.&nbsp; You&#039;d expect to hear music, and the sound of machines running and weights being lifted and put down (not thrown down).&nbsp; I personally don&#039;t mind the &quot;meatheads&quot; grunting, but sometimes the loud sound of a weight being thrown down is a little startling.&nbsp; Anyway, my take on the so-called meatheads is that at least they are working out.&nbsp; I am much more bothered by the person talking on their cell phone while they&#039;re &quot;working out&quot; (notice--it&#039;s never the fit people who do this) and those who are not considerate of others and get in the way (again--not usually the fit ones, usually the new years resolution, or get-ready-for-bathing-suit-season nuisances who will show up for a month or so, get in the way and then disappear without achieving their goal).&nbsp; I&#039;m also not fond of people talking to me beyond a friendly hello, because the gym is my time to be alone and complete my workout, not a place to chat.&nbsp; So yes, I do expect silence beyond the basic gym noises.<br /><br />Just curious--what is the purpose for dropping weight?&nbsp; I think I can see the purpose of the grunting.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been to many gyms over the years (and dated my share of trainers) and I&#039;ve never heard there was a real reason for dropping weights.

				I&#039;m curious about the purpose of dropping weights too. I&#039;ve read a fair amount of writing by weight lifters (trying to get excited about lifting weight myself) and to experienced lifters the practice seems generally discouraged and viewed as an unnecessary, rude behavior. <br /><br />

				Olympic lifters have to drop weights for example... When you have 300+ lbs over head, its hard to set it down gently. Of course like I said, not too many Oly lifters are doing that in commercial gyms though (ok I will admit to probably none). Also, if you hit muscular failure before your are finished, then you should drop the weight before you hurt yourself. I was merely pointing out in my previous post just to show that there are times and legitimate reasons for the dropping in certain cases. But I agree that its mostly just idiots who don&#039;t know what the hell they are doing and lifting weights wrong anyways. And its that plus the phones which pretty much made me move away from the Mcfitness Center/Globo-gyms.

				people seem to be ripping on astoria sports complex but they offer you basically everything for a dirt cheap price. u cant expect to have towels handed out with your initials on them when u are paying $ 125 a year for a free weight gym .&nbsp; &nbsp;the upstairs is the cardio gym and that also is the same price . ive been there for years and i have to say the toughest part is finding parking since everything there now is meters&nbsp; and since evolution opened around the corner ,parking is worse than ever.&nbsp; if u wanna pay the rock price on ditmars , so u can have a&nbsp; dj play while u work out&nbsp; and have guidos pulling up in daddys bmw , then go for it /&nbsp; &nbsp;If u want to work out , then even a dungeon should be enough as long as u have the willpower&nbsp; and determination to keep your workouts going every week

				They spell it both ways in the same Ad!<br /><br />( I tried to copy and paste. It wasn&#039;t as simple as that, or perhaps I am too simple.)<br /><br />Anyway, in the &#039;gear/wheel&#039; graphic on top of the page it is spelled with an &#039;e&#039;.<br /><br />A little further down the &#039;banner&#039; has the same phrase, &quot;No Judgment Zone&quot; spelled without the &#039;e&#039;.<br /><br />So I suppose that this proves out essen&#039;s point!

				I belong to the Rock now, but am switching to Life Health &amp; Fitness (formerly known as Evolution) on 35th Avenue and 36th St. <br /><br /><br />I just went there Sunday to check on fees. They have different plans - with and without contracts. You can also pay cash upfront for a year or six month stint. I&#039;m planning to do either the six months for $300 or the year for $550. Very clean gym, good equipment. Open 24 hours Monday - Friday, which was important to me. <br />They also have classes - spinning, yoga, etc. <br /><br /><br />And no heavy sales pitch. I asked for info, they gave me a printout with the fees clearly listed, no games, which I liked. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				I been to Club Fitness 3 times, guests passes form friends. It has become a bit raggedy around the edges past few months. It was great year ago.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They charge way to much, try to pass self off as an Equinox type gym, which they are not.&nbsp; &nbsp;Nice place overall, but price is out of whack.

				I had thought that Club Fitness was going down a little bit -- but I&#039;ve changed my mind. Been a member there for 3 years, and I get a discount for 1) being a student 2) paying the year in advance. Makes it near 60/month.<br /><br /><br />The thing that changed my mind was that I mentioned one of the machines was missing a shoe strap, and the next day it was fixed. I think that the employees just don&#039;t use the machines that much, and don&#039;t know if something goes wrong. I&#039;ve seen the few machines that are having issues be fixed. Otherwise, I can&#039;t complain.<br /><br /><br />I agree the price is a bit steep, but I&#039;ll pay for location, non-crowded, and clean. I&#039;ve been in ratty gyms. Gross.<br /><br />

				I worked at a school so I took advantage of the student/teacher deal at NYSC over the summer. It was $139 to join and $29 a month for any NYSC (the catch: extra fee if I wanna sign-in between 4:30pm-7:30pm Mon-Thurs) . I only did it because of my insurance will pay for it if I go for certain amount of times. I&#039;ve been to the Astoria one a few times while it isn&#039;t bad, it certainly isn&#039;t the best NYSC or any gym I&#039;ve seen. Most of the NYSC I&#039;ve visit in the city and Long Island are renovated. The Astoria one certainly doesn&#039;t look like it. I hate it smells so bad even before I&nbsp; get into that elevator to get to the gym. Unless someone pay for it, I&#039;d never join that place.<br /><br /><br />BTW, I&#039;d heard there is a promotion going on in November that for $60 something you&#039;d be able to join NYSC for the all passport which means you can go to any NYSC you want. Not sure if it&#039;s true but if you really want to join them, keep your eyes out for that.

				I just joined Life Health &amp; Fitness at the Kaufman Studios in September. I&#039;ve been very pleased so far. The equipment is very good - modern, well maintained and good variety of machines to choose from. It&#039;s also very clean and the staff are great. I was at the Rock for 5 years but was very disappointed in the last year as the club became very run down. Life Health is also very reasonably priced and they have a couple of payment options. I got a 13-month membership for just slightly half of what I paid at the Rock for&nbsp; a year. <br /><br /><br />And no, I don&#039;t work there or have any connections there if anyone is wondering. I&#039;m just happy to have found a good facility at a good price. And great about this new gym coming to Astoria. The more competition the better for all of us. <br /><br />

				That&#039;s ridiculous. Life Health didn&#039;t charge me any initiation or startup fee. I&#039;ve actually never paid one, not even at the Rock. In my view, they&#039;re charging you for giving them your business/patronage. Ridiculous. To join a gym you fill in a couple of forms, sign them and that&#039;s it. For that they&#039;re going to charge $100+? Ridiculous. And knowing that they only charge $19.99 a month means they&#039;re just a step up from Planet Fitness, which I&#039;ve never heard anything good about. Too bad. But I wonder where they&#039;ll be located. <br /><br />
