				My membership is just over $70/month since joining a couple of years ago. I heard it&#039;s up to around $80 now. <br /><br />The Matrix in the shopping center on Ditmars (43rd St.?) is like half the price, I just might defect. The price of The Rock is ridiculous, as is the music.

				I just joined yesterday.&nbsp; So far I like the place.&nbsp; But then again, what it has going for it is convenience.&nbsp; There&#039;s not much out here by Ditmars and The Matrix is much farther for me.&nbsp; I joined with WellQuest which is like GlobalFit, you go through your health insurance (Oxford or others) or your job, and it&#039;s $57 a month.&nbsp; And a month to month contract.&nbsp; Which is great.&nbsp; The gym is clean, the staff have been friendly if not very helpful to newbies, and they have good equipment.&nbsp; The pilates class I took today was awesome, and most importantly, nonjudgmental.&nbsp; I used to think it was a gym for trendsters, but so far I haven&#039;t encountered them.&nbsp; Most of the girls I&#039;ve noticed are not all decked out, wearing makeup and the like, rather they are just in Tshirts working out just like everyone else.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t appear to be much of a scene at least in the morning.&nbsp; Honestly haven&#039;t noticed the music much but then again, who doesn&#039;t work out with their ipod?<br /><br />Basically, everyone just joins the gym that works for them, cost and convenience-wise.&nbsp; If it&#039;s not working for you, move on.&nbsp; I do wish this area would get more gyms though.&nbsp; We don&#039;t have many choices by Ditmars.

				They&#039;ve made a lot of changes in the last year and a half. When I joined in 2004, a lot of the desk staff had been there for awhile. They knew their business, could answer a question, and weren&#039;t rude. Most of them were let go about a year ago and a lot of young, inexperienced, snotty kids were hired. They really couldn&#039;t care less whether you stay, go, or even drop dead in front of the desk. <br /><br />Another thing that&#039;s annoying now is that they&#039;ve cut the air conditioning since they put in ceiling fans. On hot, humid days they cut the power on the AC and pretend that nothing is different. Their official story is that the system is old, needs to be replaced, etc. etc. Yet, they spent&nbsp; money for these fans instead of upgrading the system.<br /><br />The reason I go there is that the equipement is very good and maintained well. Plus I do a few of the classes, which saves me money. But when it comes to good, basic people skills and customer service, the owners are more concerned with their new offices there - which they moved into to save money renting a space on 30th Ave. &amp; Crescent - than they are with how their staff are treating the members. <br /><br />Is that specific enough?

				I agree, the AC can definitely be turned up more. After being on a cardio machine for 30 minutes, it can get so hot. <br /><br />Overall I do like the Rock though. The location is very convenient for me plus it&#039;s open all the time. It&#039;s pretty big so you never have to wait for machines. And the gym is super clean in my opinion. I&#039;ve visited gyms that were funky, but this one isn&#039;t at all.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				My understanding regarding the AC is that ConEd actually limits how much power the gym can have (to avoid black outs), and since fans use less electricity, they can stay at full power.<br /><br />I agree that a lot of the counter staff are less than stellar, but I think Diego in particular is attentive and helpful and the poster child for good customer service. Interestingly, Dora (? er, I think that&#039;s her name, but now I&#039;m wondering if I&#039;ve just watched too many Dora the Explorer cartoons with my son), one of the two new managers, used to work the counter. I think they threw her into the deep end but she&#039;s done a good job with such a steep learning curve. (Seriously, to go from working the desk to running the whole gym?!?)

				I actually belonged to the Rock for several years and just quit last month for many of the same reasons I have been hearing on this board.&nbsp; Basically there is&nbsp; just a general attitude there that they could take you or leave you and I always experienced horrible customer service.&nbsp; About 6 months ago I purchased a gift certificate for a massage for my bf but when I tried to schedule an appointment I was told that the rooms were under renovation but would be available soon.&nbsp; I was given this run around for months and I even asked if they wouldnt be giving massages anymore to which I was told absolutely and not to worry.&nbsp; Naturally, I called again two weeks ago to try and get this massage and of course they dont give them anymore!&nbsp; When I asked what I was supposed to do with my gc now no one had an answer for me.&nbsp; I was told Dora the manager would be calling me, which never happened.&nbsp;

				Are you going to continue to pursue getting your money back?&nbsp; That massage gift certificate couldn&#039;t have been cheap.&nbsp; I would be very aggressive about contacting the owners, writing formal letters, threatening legal action or reporting to BBB.&nbsp; That&#039;s not right.<br /><br />One thing I like about my new membership there thru WellQuest is I have no commitments.&nbsp; I can leave anytime.&nbsp; But so far it&#039;s working for me.

				I agree with daisy - rather than frustrate yourself by waiting for Dora to call, I would give them a deadline by which they&#039;ll refund your money, after which you&#039;ll report them to the BBB.&nbsp; Maybe put the timeline of events in a letter and give it to Dora so that you have documentation in writing.

				As much as I love it the cost is too difficult to justify. Might be cheaper if I spend $10/visit as a guest and bike/run in the park the rest of the time. Or try the Matrix.<br /><br />As a city employee, I get to use the rec centers free of charge ($50/year for the riff-raff&nbsp; :-D ) not that they&#039;re convenient, only one per borough or something.

The &quot;lack of professionalism&quot; and &quot;look annoyed&quot; are both right on the money. I also started to notice that the bathroom/shower weren&#039;t maintained as well as they used to. Empty shampoo/soap containers, not cleaned, no little bags for used gym clothes, etc. And then there&#039;s the whole classroom thing. I haven&#039;t been in this summer, so I wasn&#039;t aware of the A/C problem.<br /><br />It all adds up, and from what Iv&#039;e seen at other gyms, the exodus of customers b/c of the decline in quality will only worsen things. They;&#039;ll get less money and/or have to up their rates which will mean less paying customers to help keep it up, and on and aon...<br /><br />It&#039;s probably worth asking for a free pass to th eMatrix to see how they match up.

				I just wanted to say I&#039;ve been going to the Matrix for a year now and I think it&#039;s great. The Rock struck me as the &quot;Globo-Gym&quot; equivalent. The Matrix is clean, air-conditioned, well-maintained, and cheaper.

Their customer service reps, such as Manny, who&#039;s been gone for a while, were among the best customer service reps I&#039;ve ever dealt with anywhere. <br />Anyway, I rented a small locker for a year with my membership. EVERY SINGLE TIME that I&#039;d check in before going in, the girl at the desk would tell me that my locker expired. I really mean EVERY TIME.&nbsp; And EVERY TIME I would explain, they&#039;d see the error, and apologize. I&#039;d then EVERY TIME say &quot;Can you please put it in the computer?&quot; to which they assured me they would. (When I tell you that this went on for months, please don&#039;t think I&#039;m exaggerating.) Well, one day, of course, I get there and they cut my lock off, telling me that I hadn&#039;t paid. I went bananas. I felt like a jerk because then the manager came out, and I took it out on him. He apologized, gave me a new lock, and gave me a month free or something like that.<br />&nbsp;I also hear a lot of bad stuff about the trainer with the little dreads. He&#039;s kinda rude, sexist, loud, obnoxious, and women don&#039;t feel comfortable with him. ONce I was in the locker room, right next to him, and he burped so loudly, then looks at ME like &quot;What are you gonna do?&quot;&nbsp; Whatever. Just watch the way he behaves when he&#039;s training women, compared to men.

				I agree with the above poster about the state of the showers/locker rooms. <br />For instance, in the first shower stall - for any of you female members, it&#039;s the one closests<br />to the toilet stalls - the floor drain has been loose for about a year. All it needs is to be screwed back<br />down into the floor. A couple of times I&#039;ve almost tripped on it or stuck my foot in the hole since it moves<br />off the drain when you move around.<br /><br />I&#039;ve shown this to male and female workers at the front desk, yet it&#039;s never fixed. <br /><br />Plus they&#039;ve installed these awful incandescent (sp?) lightbulbs around the mirror that give off so much<br />heat that I can&#039;t believe they&#039;re even sold nowadays. <br /><br />What they don&#039;t seem to get at these gyms, is that basic things like these are what members are concerned about.<br /><br />All I want is a place that&#039;s clean, safe, professionally staffed and equipment that&#039;s maintained. That&#039;s not<br />rocket science. <br /><br />Regarding the person who bought the massage certificate, you&#039;ve let it go too long. The owners are lawyers. <br />I&#039;d threated to report them to the local bar association since they allowed those certificate to be sold. <br /><br />And personally, I don&#039;t think the owners care about the things that have come up on this thread. I&#039;ve seen them<br />working out many times in the gym. They just come in, work out, talk to one or two at the desk and leave. <br /><br />Like I said before, they&#039;re so happy to be saving the rent money from getting rid of their old offices that they <br />don&#039;t care. <br /><br />

				I joined the Rock through Well Quest and my health insurance in March of 2007 and pay $57.&nbsp; If I had to pay full price I probably wouldn&#039;t join.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s very expensive.&nbsp; I totally agree about the air conditioning not being strong enough.&nbsp; It gets very uncomfortable in there on hot and humid days and I don&#039;t even feel like exercising.&nbsp; I think the staff that works behind the desk are nice and polite.&nbsp; I never had a problem with any of them.&nbsp; I did however have a problem with a personal trainer which cost me a lot of money.&nbsp; When I first joined the gym I thought it would be a good idea to workout with a personal trainer so I could get personal attention and learn how to use the equipment be guided about what exercises are good for me.&nbsp; Well, this trainer worked me so hard that I ended up getting a shoulder injury and and now going to physical therapy for.&nbsp; This really upset me, but I didn&#039;t complain to the management about it.&nbsp; I did, however let the trainer know about it and he tried to put the blame on me.&nbsp; It&#039;s getting better, but it&#039;s taking a long time, about 2 months now.&nbsp; Oh well, I learned a lesson from this.&nbsp; I will never ever use a personal trainer again.&nbsp; Also, they put this really dumb extra bright lights hollywood like lights around the mirror in the ladies lockerroom.&nbsp; They are so bright that they hurt your eyes. :-(

I wanted to change after a few sessions, but the manager (this was 2 years ago) was grilling me on why I wanted to switch. The manager was nice, but I clearly felt like I was going to get the trainer in trouble and I didn&#039;t want to cause problems&nbsp; so I just let it go.&nbsp; I really wish you could bring your own trainer to gyms.

Of course they are gonna have young people working there, you think a 30 year old is gonna work behind that front desk for what they probably get paid.. I think the Rock is Great, clean, friendly and exactly what I want in a gym...what other gym has a professional boxing ring other than Gleasons.

				I have been a member at the Rock for three and half years&nbsp; and I have noticed the mngmt change but hey people move on to better jobs. I see the owners more involved and there is always some kind of renovation going on. From putting new pads on the machines to new lights and cabinets in the locker rooms. The gym is superclean and maintained very well. Front Desk always greets me with a smile and i have never had any problems. From all the gyms in the neighborhood I think its the best one!! Has anyone taken any classes....they are amazing!! I go there mostly for classes and I enjoy them. For some people it might not be the greatest gym&nbsp; but I havent had any problems with it!

				I did bring this thread to the attention of a manager last night. Her reaction was, I have to say,<br />very defensive. People always find something to complain about, maybe it&#039;s time for people to move on, <br />this is a much better gym than others around here, etc. <br /><br />I told her that this wasn&#039;t a lot of mindless sniping, but genuine gripes that members don&#039;t feel are<br />taken seriously. I also said this was the wrong attitude. Your initial response shouldn&#039;t be &quot; well, time<br />to move on.&quot; No, it&#039;s &quot; Gee, long time members are upset about a few things and don&#039;t feel they<br />can communicate with us. Hmmmm....gotta fix this problem.&quot;<br /><br />Honestly, I don&#039;t know if it did any good, but I tried. <br /><br />And a couple of things - to the person w/the massage certificate: I&#039;m told that you should have been<br />given the contact info for the masseuse who was doing the massages there and that they would honor<br />your certificate. <br /><br />And to the other person who got a cross-eyed look when asked if he would renew at his current rate - I<br />was told you are supposed to get the rate you were paying before, if you joined prior to the increase. <br /><br />So......picking the right gym is a matter of chemistry. What bugs some may not phase others. While these<br />seemed like valid complaints, I don&#039;t know if anything will be done. <br /><br />

				Yes, I noticed those two posts as well. The first one was five minutes after I stated the case,<br />the other one was later on. As an editor, I would scold them both for sounding so much alike. <br /><br />Funny how they&#039;ve both been members for 3 1/2 years. What a coincidence.<br /><br />With regard to your&nbsp; massage certificate, I would head over there asap. The longer you let it go,<br />I think the harder it will be to make any good on it. <br /><br />Also, don&#039;t get me wrong. I do like the Rock and it is basically a good gym w/great equipment and<br />classes. It&#039;s just that those things aren&#039;t the only ones important to the members and sometimes <br />management doesn&#039;t pick up on that. I&#039;d still recommend it over Synergy and NYSC on Steinway.<br />Can&#039;t speak for Matrix or the new Club Fitness.<br /><br />Like I said, what irks me may not even register on someone else&#039;s radar. I left Synergy because of<br />mice running around my feet and roaches in the lockers. My friends there said I was too fussy. Go figure!<br />

I&#039;m not going to complain about the lights around the mirrors, because in my opinion that&#039;s nitpicking, and if the a.c isn&#039;t high enough for you, maybe that&#039;s complaining too. What&#039;s next, that the TV&#039;s don&#039;t have your favorite reality shows when you&#039;re there? What bugs me is the astronomical cost, the &quot;who cares&quot; attitude towards loyal members, and the trainer who is harassing women.

				Debbie, that sounds like the same experience I had with my personal trainer.&nbsp; I too am older than most of the ladies in there and I asked him if he takes that into account with the workout and also the fact that before working out with him I hadn&#039;t done much exercise at all except for walking and dancing.&nbsp; Of course he said that he took that into account.&nbsp; When I felt a pain in my shoulder that didn&#039;t go away for over a week I told him about it and he didn&#039;t pay much attention to it.&nbsp; Then I went to the doctor and the doctor told me I shouldn&#039;t lift my arms over my head and not do anything to strain my shoulders and when I told my trainer that he told me that I shouldn&#039;t listen to everything the doctor tells me.&nbsp; I&#039;m still going to the physical therapy 3 days a week for about a month now and it&#039;s not better yet.&nbsp; I still have the thought to tell management at the gym about this, but I don&#039;t think they would do anything about it. :-(

				I don&#039;t think that lack of air conditioning is complaining.&nbsp; It&#039;s very uncomfortable exercising in there on a hot and humid day and if you&#039;re paying that much money for membership it shouldn&#039;t be that way. I noticed that the locker room is very cool and also the boxing room, so why can&#039;t the whole gym be that way.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think that&#039;s too much to ask.

				I&#039;ve used the Rock for a couple of years now, with mixed impressions. <br /><br />I personally had an excellent trainer when I first joined. The music is WAY too loud. The desk staff are polite, but don&#039;t do anything hand out towels. (I&#039;m sure they get minimum wage.) There are supposed to be guys walking around with &quot;ask me if you need help&quot; t-shirts, but I&#039;ve never been able to get any assistance from them.<br /><br />When I&#039;ve put a note in the comment box, I bet it goes straight in the trash. I&#039;ve requested that broken ellipticals be fixed, ventilation improved, music turned down, the new lights in the women&#039;s locker room removed, etc. The most success I had was a sign that was put on one of the broken ellipticals saying &quot;out of order&quot;.&nbsp; :x

				To be very honest, I agree with a couple of postings that sometimes when someone writes about issues, a mob mentality forms and everyone seems to recall all of their experiences, bad or good.&nbsp; My overall experience about a year ago was good, but the Personal Trainer experience was awful.&nbsp; When I had an issue, I went straight into their office and the Manager at the time was very accomodating.&nbsp; I think that it is a good idea however, to have them look at this thread.&nbsp; Enough people have had negative experiences to make it valid.&nbsp; It seems that if they increased the A/C and trained their staff, got better Personal Trainers etc. they would be fine.

				Overall, I think the Rock is great!&nbsp; <br /><br />In my opinion, my only gripe is the AC not being high enough. When it&#039;s super hot, you&#039;re motivation for doing alot of cardio dwindles. <br /><br />It&#039;s a very clean gym and the location is great. If you can get the discount through you&#039;re health insurance, it&#039;s not that expensive.

				Maybe I&#039;ll go there and avoid the personal trainer thing altogether. I was hoping to get with one that could help me use the strength-building machines in a way that won&#039;t screw up my weak joints, but I&#039;m worried if this guy has a habit of pushing people to uncomfortable levels.

				Posted this earlier-- I *have* worked with Lois (and hope to again in the near future). She&#039;s great, IMHO. Definitely talk to her-- she&#039;s not the sort of person who&#039;s going to charge you for talking first. Explain what you&#039;re nervous about and ask her what experience she has, what she thinks you could work together on. <br /><br />My take on Jeff (aka PT w/dreadlocks) was that the drill sergeant thing he does is a role-- and that some people really eat it up. (I&#039;ve watched him, and some people really enjoy whining at him.) He was also assigned to me as my orientation PT. I&#039;m glad that I had waited to sign up for the orientation until I&#039;d been around for a few months and had an impression of the various trainers. Instead of whining after the first hard thing we did, I jumped up, smiled, and asked if we could do it again? He blinked, said, &quot;You&#039;re teasing me, now&quot; and *never* gave me a hard time about anything ever again.<br /><br />YMMV, and I do think that some Overly Fit people forget that us mere mortals can and do get injured doing things we&#039;re not ready for. If you don&#039;t bring it up to them, though, how can they improve? How can they learn and not mess someone else up?<br /><br />(Or you could sue.)<br /><br />:*)<br /><br />I *am* sorry to the poster who got seriously injured. I don&#039;t know enough about the topic to have anything wise to say on it, though, so I&#039;ll just offer my sympathy.<br /><br />alia

				also, best advice given to me about the boxing class: don&#039;t eat for 3-4 hours beforehand. (my first time, even though i followed that advice i was nearly sick at the end...) i&#039;m not the most fit person ever, so your response might not be so extreme. ;)<br /><br />what i figured out after two sessions, btw, was just because Dean is shouting out the pace, nobody is going to be offended or make fun of you if you choose a slightly slower pace, or a lighter weight, or whatever. it&#039;s a pretty welcoming group.

				Have&#039;nt worked with him - but the session I had with David was very basic - showing the equipment - and not very driving. He has a nice personality, But if it&#039;s like what I had don&#039;t expect much. I think they save the real deal for when you sign up for sessions.

				You really should try out clubfitness I used to work out in manhattan and I just recently moved to the area and joined synergy first (no comment) and then was walking by clubfitness and walked in and was absolutely amazed...its a bit misleading from the outside but you cant actually see the 50,000 sq feet and my trainer is prob the best trainer ive ever had and ive lived in hong kong, london, manhattan, and l.a...<br /><br />i actually ended up joining this site after reading this point and all these reviews

				It&#039;s funny reading HotStepper&#039;s two posts on astorians.com side-by-side.<br /><br />In one he/she claims to have just moved to the &quot;area and joined synergy first (no comment) and then was walking by clubfitness and walked in and was absolutely amazed... my trainer is prob the best trainer ive ever had and ive lived in hong kong, london, manhattan, and l.a...&quot;<br /><br />In the other he/she writes: &quot;Yeah I joined clubfitness on broadway as well... its actually the best gym ive probably ever been to..

And no offense to HotStepper as well, but I think one major flaw with Club Fitness is that it&#039;s on the ground floor with large windows for everyone to see. Anyway, I&#039;m going to visit all 3 places to get more information.

				Update: after considering going to another place (however reluctantly since The Rock is close to home), I decided to renew. They gave me an offer I couldn&#039;t refuse: 14 months for the price of one year, which comes out to about $60/month.<br /><br />And I went back (after a hiatus of several months) and everything seemed to have improved. The desk staff was friendly again and the bathrooms were restocked. I&#039;m still not crazy about losing the classroom space on the 31st side of the building, but whaddya gonna do.

Con ed has a program where they give businesses serious discount if they put certain electrical loads (mostly AC) on a remote line. That way anytime electrical usage in NYC goes higher that a preset amount the AC will automatically be turned down.

				For the prices they&#039;re charging, I&#039;m surprised to read of all of the negatives in this thread.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m currently debating which gym to join.&nbsp; The Rock is asking for something like $85/month, or $78 or so if you sign up with a spouse or roommate, waiving the initiation fee and if you sign up for a one year contract, gives you the last two months free, which basically balances out to around a $70/month contract.&nbsp; It still seems quite pricey to me, and while I will indeed be using my three guest passes that I was given when I looked at the gym to try it out, I&#039;ll also be shopping around a bit and plan to make a sojourn on over to Matrix as well.&nbsp; The Rock&#039;s main advantage for me, like seemingly everyone else, is convenience.&nbsp; It&#039;s just a matter of at what price do you place that convenience.

				I&#039;ve been a member for a little over two years. The manager told me that the towel thing<br />is because the regular workout-size towels have been disappearing and the cost to replace them<br />has gone up 70% - that&#039;s what I was told.<br /><br />As for the fans, if you want them on all you have to do is ask. I haven&#039;t lately because I&#039;ve been<br />feeling cold there but when it was warmer in Sept. &amp; Oct., I just asked and they were turned on.<br /><br />Things have improved since this thread was at its peak a couple of months ago with all the complaints.<br />I printed out a copy and sent it anonomously to the owners. Don&#039;t know if that did it or something else,<br />but even though the price is high, you do get good value. <br /><br />The equipment is great with lots of variety. Classes are excellent. I used to take pilates at a studio 2x<br />week near my office and now I take 3 classes per week at the Rock and the quality is much better. <br /><br />It&#039;s really a matter of how much you train, the priority you put on it&nbsp; and, of course, economics!

				This is what I noticed regarding the towel service @ the Rock:<br /><br />Used to be I got a towel for showering right when I checked in. And they always gave me a 2nd one if I asked for it. This time, I asked for two towels and were given the small ones, and I was kinda peeved about it. It was friggin cold out and I didn&#039;t want to walk home all sweaty.<br /><br />But, when I finished my workout I asked the desk guy why they got rid of towels for showering, and he asked whether I was going to use the shower. I told him yes and a got a large towel. Simple as that.<br /><br />Oh, and I did notice that they keep the large towels in a bag below the desk, instead of on display like they used to.<br /><br />The big towels are there; you gotta ask.

If they didn&#039;t, it would be easy to argue that they are being socially irresponsible.

I recently signed up at Evolution. The Rock was price prohibitive.

				I&#039;m considering joining the Rock since it&#039;s in a very convenient location for me and the class schedule works well with my schedule. The cost is the one thing holding me back. <br /><br />I saw that some posters had used a program called WellQuest. I was looking through their site, which did not explain much. Is this service applicable to everyones health insurance? Do you need to meet certain requirements? I have Oxford, which I believe an earlier poster had as well. <br /><br />Any information on this would be helpful!

				http://www.wellquestonline.com/<br /><br />Click on the drop down menu on the front page under sponsoring organizations.&nbsp; All the health insurance companies and work companies that participate in the program are listed.&nbsp; Oxford is one of them.&nbsp; The application process is short and sweet.&nbsp; And once you set it up, even if your health insurance changes, you can stay in the discount program.&nbsp; It&#039;s a great deal.&nbsp; The only two in Astoria that participate are The Rock and Synergy, I think.&nbsp; You are allowed to use other gyms in the network as well (which are all over including Bally&#039;s) in addition 4 times a month.&nbsp; But Global Fit is a similar program as WellQuest and worth looking into as well.<br /><br />If anyone wants a 2 week pass to the Rock, PM me.&nbsp; I also have 2 certificates for almost no initiation fee.

				<br />As a long-time Rock Member (4+ years), there are plenty of positives and a some negatives associated with being a member there, in my opinion:<br /><br />On the good side:<br /><br />* Equipment is well-maintained and when things break, they are repaired quickly<br />* The gym and locker rooms are typically very clean and well-kept<br />* Hours can&#039;t be beat<br />* Classes are free, if that&#039;s your thing<br />* Members are generally pleasant, non-psychotic, and free of steriod-induced rages<br /><br />However,<br /><br />* It ain&#039;t cheap<br />* It appears the membership has taken a hit since Club Fitness opened on Broadway a few months ago, which might explain why the towels provided to members for working out have shrunk in size and quality<br />* Music, especially at night, is way too loud.&nbsp; Staff must think they&#039;re managing a disco, not a gym.&nbsp; Even blasting your iPod can&#039;t drown it out completely<br /><br />Guest passes / visits are easy to arrange, so anyone interested in the gym should stop by and check it out.<br />
