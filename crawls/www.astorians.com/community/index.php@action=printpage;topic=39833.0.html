				<br />There are large roaches...the types you may sometimes see on subway platforms...which are typically referred to as &#039;water bugs&#039; or &#039;german cockroaches&#039; and ...I think more down South, Palmetto bugs.<br /><br />Anyway, I am curious how many others here also see them in their apartment now and then?<br /><br />I&#039;d also like ot know...do you live in an old building... an apartment that has lots of craps and gaps along the floor/wall, old window frames, etc. ?....or is your building &#039;not that old&#039; (maybe 10-40 years old?) or do you live in a new or luxury bldg?&nbsp; I&#039;m just trying to get a sense of which bldg types have this problem.<br /><br />When I lived in an old rowhouse type bldg in Harlem, I had centipedes but never saw one waterbug in 7 years.&nbsp; I then lived in a brand new really well-built house in Ridgewood and saw one waterbug in 5 years.&nbsp; Then lilved in a new luxury bldg in Astoria for 2 years and never had a waterbug.&nbsp; Now I&#039;m living in a small apt bldg that was built maybe 15-20 years ago near 21st Ave and STeinway and I notice these bugs more on the sidewalk here, AND in my apartment (I typically see about 10-15 waterbugs between May-September, mainly in the bldg hallway, but also in my apartment).&nbsp; I feel like there is something about this part of Astoria (near 21st Ave and STeinway) that is more hospitable to these bugs...&nbsp; Anyway the bldg itself is overall pretty well kept so I just don&#039;t know what to do about it.&nbsp; There are no old or big cracks in my apartment...

				<br />I think everyone in my bldg. have now come to the conclusion that all the underground street construction in the area (new plumbing pipes being installed) has worsened the waterbug issue.&nbsp; In the past few days alone, I saw three waterbugs in my apt., and that’s just the bugs that I SAW (all of which I killed BTW)!<br /><br />After doing considerable research, I am instituting a multi-pronged attack.&nbsp; ;-)<br /><br />LL is having exterminator come to do entire bldg. (esp the outside perimeter of bldg.)<br /><br />I have bought Combat Roach traps (for large roaches i.e., waterbugs) and will put them throughout my apt and in the hallways and stairwell as well (since that is where I see the waterbugs most often…in the hallways).&nbsp; In another apartment where I lived, I had an issue with small ‘kitchen’ roaches.&nbsp; The Combat Roach traps (for small roaches) absolutely worked.&nbsp; Within two weeks of my putting out the Combat traps, no more roaches, for months!&nbsp; Then the roaches would start to reappear, I’d get new Combat traps, and again, within two weeks, no more roaches.&nbsp; So the trick is to be sure that you indeed replace your Combat traps on a regular schedule.<br /><br />I will have a handyman come by and seal up every little crack in my apt.<br /><br />I will periodically spray a water solution that is strongly scented with clove or peppermint oil (both are strong scents that bugs do not like) around baseboards and under my sinks where the pipes meet the wall. <br /><br />I will always have bug spray on-hand to kill any bugs on-the-spot, that I may see.<br /><br />I am going to buy electronic bug repellants, which apparently CAN also help.&nbsp; &nbsp;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073VJL6ZH/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=A3ORWJRNTZRT61&amp;psc=1<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074DTQCSW/ref=ox_sc_act_title_3?smid=A35WK6PLQS6XXM&amp;psc=1<br /><br />...and I already keep my apartment impeccably clean...but still, clearly that does not keep bugs out...it only prevents MORE from finding something attractive to eat, etc.<br /><br />A multi-pronged approach is the best tactic!!!&nbsp; ;-)<br /><br />Here’s to a bug-free future!<br />
