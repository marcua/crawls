				Man, as if they haven't done enough screening for this film....? &nbsp;<br /><br />Focus Feature has always been aggressive in promoting their film for Oscar. &nbsp;I still remember how aggressive they were for &quot;Lost In Translation&quot;(Don't get me started... I can't use any civilized language when I talk about this film) and &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; &nbsp;Screening after screening with Q&amp;A session w/ stars and all. &nbsp;Even after I unsubscribed from their e-mail list, the please-vote-for-this-film e-mails or free voter screening notices/tickets kept pouring into my inbox (they probably have an access to e-list from SAG or something) and around December, January, they print the ads like every other pages in trade papers. &nbsp;<br /><br />I'm just not crazy about their in-your-face approach in pushing films for Oscar. &nbsp;(But we're going to see this tomorrow anyway... &nbsp;No Tommy Lee Jones or Ron Howard though. &nbsp;We'll have Meirelles, Weisz and Ralph Finnes)<br /><br />BTW, we just saw &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; and &quot;Rent&quot;. &nbsp;We had relatively low expectation for both films and surprisingly we liked them better than we thought we would.. &nbsp;More on this on different posts.
