				First New Good One closes and now La Vita Mia pizza has been shuttered for at least a week. When I first moved to 24th Ave, they made pretty reliable pizza and really good baked ziti and lasagna. The quality has declined a little since then, but not enough to make me stop going. Anyone know what&#039;s going on?

				So I caught one of the guys working on La Vita Mia and asked him if they would be re-opening.&nbsp; He said yes, definitely.&nbsp; Right now they are renovating to make the sitting area nicer and more inviting for customers to eat in, rather than getting their order and running out.&nbsp; I look forward to seeing what they do.&nbsp; It definitely needed a face lift!!&nbsp; As you noted, it was better a few years back.&nbsp; That was when Claudio owned it.&nbsp; After he sold it, it did go down hill a little.&nbsp; Not sure if this is another new owner or the same.<br /><br /><br />As for New Good One, a few months back I caught one of the workers who looked like he was cleaning out some belongings and asked him why they closed.&nbsp; He told me the landlord doubled their rent and there was no way they would be able to make it, so they just had to close.&nbsp; Let&#039;s see how long that space remains empty.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing a long time.

Since they&#039;ve been closed, I&#039;ve realized that there aren&#039;t many places close to my apartment to get just a slice or 2. I&#039;m glad to hear they&#039;ll be back.
