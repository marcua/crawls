				I need to move a piano from CT to NY or possibly MA. I haven&#039;t had this piano tuned in more than 6 years. Is it better to tune it before or after it&#039;s been moved or both? Anyone have any experience with a professional and affordable moving company? I have no clue what this might cost. Maybe this is something I can do myself as long as I know how to keep it stable...help.&nbsp; :cry:

				Don&#039;t know about moving it, but definitely tune it AFTER the move.

				i&#039;d start calling movers, tell them you have a piano, and ask for an estimate. not all movers will move pianos.

				Thanks, I saw the pianocarriage link as well and will give them a call tomorrow, but I thought someone might have direct experience, too. <br />Having to spend this money on moving it and tuning it is stressing me out right now and even though I haven&#039;t played since I was 9, I can&#039;t sell it (present from parents) and can&#039;t give it away for sentimental reasons. Besides, my dad has already said I can only have it if I keep it, but I can&#039;t sell it or give it away. WTF?&nbsp; :-(

				If you haven&#039;t played it since you were 9 and the idea of moving and having it is stressing you out, may I gently suggest that you not keep it?&nbsp; Unless, of course you plan on playing it again.&nbsp; If it&#039;s sentimental but not useful, perhaps you can take a picture of it and frame it nicely so you&#039;ll remember it always.&nbsp; Take pictures from all angles and make an awesome collage.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t sell it and don&#039;t want to keep it, can you donate it to a child who yearns to play?&nbsp; Perhaps a church could use one for choir practice?&nbsp; Maybe a local bar could use one.&nbsp; <br /><br />In my line of work, I have a lot of experience with the sentimental-but-unusable-and-creates-undue-stress category of items.&nbsp; It&#039;s a tricky one.&nbsp; But usually, the item is smaller than a piano.<br /><br />I wish you luck.

				I actually have some recent experience with piano moving. Definitely have it tuned after it&#039;s moved, and I&#039;d recommend waiting at least a couple weeks to get it tuned once it&#039;s in its new environment, because the wood needs time to adjust. Do not by any means attempt to move it yourself. If any stairs are involved, be expected to pay more, but just the moving of the piano will be pricey.<br /><br />I have to ask though, where are you moving it from/to? Is someone keeping it for you or are you putting it in storage? Will you or anyone else actually be playing it?

				I&#039;m moving it from CT (no stairs) to either here in Astoria (no stairs) and might start playing it here or if I move it to MA (one flight possibly), it will probably just be surrounded by other furniture and 2 people who don&#039;t play. magicpie, I hear you about not bringing in unwanted things into the home and I&#039;m a HUGE editor of all misc. ugly crap, but the piano is a special case. If it stays with my Dad, he will either give it to away, sell it himself, or move it to Ohio, in which case, I need to keep it because I don&#039;t like any of those scenarios. There are very few things I am sentimental about, my husband will tell you that I throw things out pretty ruthlessly and unfortunately, this is one of those things that I can&#039;t part with. This has been an ongoing event since my mother passed away and well, the piano is just something I can&#039;t let go and I haven&#039;t been able to control much else that&#039;s happening in the house my parents and I used to live in. So, the piano will be with me or with my in-laws. To get &quot;all psychological,&quot; I&#039;m probably more upset about my Dad moving to Ohio (my brother lives there currently). The piano is just a side-effect of the major illness, doctor.

				I think you were replying to me, not Essen, but I appreciate what you are saying.&nbsp; I just thought I&#039;d throw it out there as a suggestion since you said it was a source of stress for you.&nbsp; There are some things you just can&#039;t part with.&nbsp; I hope it brings you joy once it&#039;s delivered and tuned.&nbsp;

				Depending on the type of Piano, it isn&#039;t that hard to move it.&nbsp; My parents had an upright piano, and when it came time to sell it / move it, my dad rented a piano moving jacks (for small jacks that fit around the corners of the piano), we used a ratcheted nylon clamp, pushed down on the jacks lifting it up on its wheels and rolled up the ramp into the moving truck.<br /><br />It isn&#039;t nearly as daunting as it appears, you just have to make sure you get the right tools.&nbsp; I believe my dad rented the jacks from Home Depot... but I could easily be wrong there.
