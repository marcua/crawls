				Yes, I know not all of you have one, but I found it odd/cute when I heard that you were asked to name your iPod when you loaded the software.<br /><br />I&#39;ll start.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have a green mini... his name is Kermit.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(As in Kermit the Pod)<br /><br />Anyone else want to share?

				I have a plain white 20 GB iPod. Its name is Atticus. Not sure why - I just like the character (and the movie, and the book.. and Gregory Peck for that matter!).<br /><br />And speaking of naming electronic devices, my computer&#39;s name is Bailey, for George Bailey from It&#39;s a Wonderful Life (it was a Xmas present).

				I had named my (now-obsolete) iPod mini &quot;Newton&quot; - because it did afterall resemble a fig newton.&nbsp; Naturally, my newer nano has been dubbed &quot;Hooke&quot; because... aren&#39;t scientific rivalries are totally in these days?&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyways, Newton has since been sold.&nbsp; Check out PodSwap (http://www.ipodswap.com/) if you are looking to sell/upgrade.&nbsp;

				I&#39;m way behind the times, mainly because I&#39;m broke, but soon hope to have an ipod. I&#39;m really stupid when it comes to technology. How do you get songs on there? Where do you download them from? How much does downloading cost? Is it possible to get whole albums or is it single tracks only? I know someone who has a site on burnlounge (think that&#39;s the name). Do you pay with debit/credit or what? Is Apple ipod better than other cheaper mp3s? <br /><br />What is the deal with the huge headphones I sometimes see people wearing - Sony is the latest I saw.

				Jtrane you make it sound so simple! Maybe when I actually DO get an ipod someone will help me. Max is even more tech-challenged than me, so he won&#39;t be ANY help.

				My husband uses emusic.com for downloads.&nbsp; I believe it&#39;s a different format from Itunes but it&#39;s still compatible with it.&nbsp; It costs about $20/month for 90 downloads, has a wider selection than Itunes, and you can keep your preferences in a queue like Netflix.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been amazed at some of the stuff my husband has found on that site - curious about what others will think.

				So what&#39;s the purpose of names for an iPod?&nbsp; To distinguish between iPods that get linked to the same computer?<br /><br />And when I say &quot;together&quot; I mean in sequence, not necessarily running into each other.
