				They demolished that pretty crusty strip of shut-down stores on that block (21st ave &amp; 23rd st), but does anyone know what is going to go up in there?&nbsp; Last time I was near there it was still a vacant, cleared out lot (but a large space).&nbsp; Thanks!

				Is that a huge plot of land with wood barriers on its perimeter?&nbsp; I couldn&#39;t figure out what was going on there either but it&#39;s huge.&nbsp; Doesn&#39;t look like anything&#39;s being built yet, but if things were demolished recently that makes sense.

				The whole strip of shut down shops was demolished in early February, and the wall has been up every since. I don&#39;t know if anyone is doing anything with the property yet, as I think there&#39;s still a realtors sign on the wall.

				If there are building plans, they&#39;d be filed at the Department of Buildings.&nbsp; If someone tracks down the address, we could look it up on their online systems (but maybe the property is for sale or nothing is planned?)
