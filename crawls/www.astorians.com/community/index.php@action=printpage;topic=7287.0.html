Wiskey is the W, Romeo is the R line and Mike is M train.&nbsp; From 57th street to the 59th street in Brooklyn, the N train will run local from July 30th to Aug 20th. It will not go through the Manhattan Bridge but rather the tunnel that connects to brooklyn heights in the south which is already used by the M, R and W (on occasion) so the the first stop in brooklyn will be the Court Street station.<br /><br />Am i right?

				It actually works out pretty well for me too going to work and needing the prince street stop. I don&#039;t have to worry about switching to a local.&nbsp; Making a few extra stops is a good trade off.&nbsp; Maybe it would be worse if I was going to Brooklyn, but I&#039;m not sure how many commute to Brooklyn from Astoria that way (would the Q be an option?).&nbsp; I&#039;ll take this over having the train just run a shuttle to Queensboro Plaza, or even the 7 not running and having all those people cram onto &quot;our&quot; train :)

				This is definitely more painful for Brooklyn-Manhattan commuters than Queens-Manhattan commuters. Try taking the local N home from Union Street in Brooklyn late on a Saturday night (after the R stops running) and you&#039;ll know what I mean. The train that once went straight from Atlantic Ave to Canal Street is now making 7 additional stops between those.

				Yeah, it&#039;s gonna suck fow a month for Brooklyn folks, but it&#039;s part of the deal of having a 24 hour transit system.&nbsp; Maintanace needs to happen sometims, and how else would they do it?&nbsp; If trains run 24/7, how else would they do the needed repairs?

				Lanseaux, I think the term nickname is referring to the personalized name of each line.&nbsp; I know C is &quot;Charlie&quot; and V is &quot;Victor&quot;&nbsp; I have a friend who works for the MTA and I actually had a chance to change tracks and signal lights at the Hoyt-Schermerhorn Station.&nbsp; That was interesting, especially noting that it is still all hand done.&nbsp; I will have to find out from him what they call the other lines.

				Does anyone know how many of those new prototype trains are running on the N line?&nbsp; I saw two run in opposite directions so I know it&#039;s at least two.&nbsp; I really like those trains -- very bright and cheery, clear announcements, easy to read electronic subway maps, and bench seating.
