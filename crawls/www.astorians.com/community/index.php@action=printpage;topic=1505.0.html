				Hey Windows, I posted this on another post as well here. I have mixed feelings on the issue. While I think it sucks what google is doing with thier searches in China I am sure they are not the only ones who are doing it. Many american movies, TV shows books and other stuff are always audited to satidfy the Chinese government. I read about one of the Nike commercials a year and a half ago or so that the Chinese government was upset about to they fixed it to please them. <br /><br />I think the reason we are hearing about google is because they are the only major search engine to stand up against the FBI and not give our private information about what people search for, like you and I, in the hopes of what the FBI calls stopping child porn. I know child porn is a problem but I don&#39;t feel that my privacy should be invaded because of it.<br /><br />It&#39;s terrible what happens in China but it is not just googles fualt. How many things do amercians purchase every year from china? Most of those things come from people forced into slave labor camps for thier belives with things like Falun Dafa &amp; Falun Gong. One person who escaped and came to america saw Bugs Bunny dolls they where forced to make sitting on the shelves at a local store. <br /><br />There was even a Chinese american who traveled to China Charles Lee) and got arrested as a Falun Dafa &amp; Falun Gong supporter and our government doesn&#39;t to anything about it. He has been there now for over 1,000 Days!!!!!&nbsp; :-o (UPDATE! He was finally released and is now safley in California) http://faluninfo.net/displayAnArticle.asp?ID=9339 People are tourtured by being beaten, forced fed feces, urin, hot suace while a tube is shoved down their throat, shocked on thier private parts, thrown in a cage and submerged up to thier nose in sewage and <strong>worse</strong>. Many people have died. <br /><br />The next time someone buys something made in China people need to think twice about where this could have come from.<br /><br />For more info....<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falun_Gong

				Hi KilDaraSidhe,<br /><br />The topic that you were referring to that you started is Here (http://astorians.com/index.php?topic=1503.0).<br /><br />I recently had a conversation with a friend of mine who is a waiter in NYC.<br />Earlier in the year we had a discussion on whether people were inherently &#39;good&#39; or &#39;evil&#39;.<br />While it is to be assumed that most people are an admixture of <em>both</em>, it was my contention that people are more evil than good, while my friend clung to the idea that Homo sapiens were born innocent and profoundly believed in the &#39;nobility of the human spirit&#39;.<br /><br />Listenening to him rant for some time on the pettiness of the customers that he served I brought up our earlier conversation and asked him if he still believed in the intrinsic generosity of Humanity and he replied to everyone&#39;s amusement (including his own) &quot;Not when it comes to food, I don&#39;t! When it comes to food people are animals!&quot;<br />I thought about this for awhile, spinning it around in my head. Later that evening while walking home I came to the conclusion that it would be safe to assume that people are generally good... that is, until their survival or even <em>comfort</em> are threatened.<br /><br />If we accept Google&#39;s or some of the many other corporation&#39;s lack of standards in the ethics department and continue to give them our support and money then we become just as accountable as if we were the enslaver&#39;s themselves. We are effectively not only helping them in their &#39;evil&#39; work but in fact become their raison d&#39;etre.<br />Btw, I am not excluding myself from this indictment. I think that my value lies in the fact that I can <em>see</em> my own chains, but this seems to me to not be good enough.<br /><br />Blessed be,<br />-zeno

				I think it is worth pointing out that a person does not need to be &quot;good&quot; in order to value and protect freedom. All that is required is an appreciation for one&#39;s own freedom. Once that is in place, it is only natural to work toward empowering others; even if only to protect one&#39;s own sense of freedom.<br /><br />In the context of technology, this is even more obvious. Let&#39;s imagine (for a moment) that I have equipped myself with all I need in order to use my computer in freedom and that everyone else on the planet has allowed themselves to become part of the subscription based, &quot;All your information is belongs to us&quot; model offered by today&#39;s vendors of freedom-restricting technology. The end result is that allthough I may be &quot;free&quot;, I have in fact, become the prisoner as a direct result of my inability to interact with others. Maybe this is because I am the only one who doesn&#39;t have a valid Passport login, or I never made it to my RFID implant appointment, or maybe I&#39;m just the only fool on the planet who doesn&#39;t own approved (e.g. TCPA) hardware. Regardless, the most logical path for me to take in order to protect my own freedom is to try and empower others.<br /><br />Best,<br /><br />Adam

				Recently the film of the early life of the Dalai Lama was shown at AMMI<br />Kundun<br /><br />Because the owners of the film (Disney) want to stay in good graces with the Chinese (tolerant? dictators?) government, they do not want this film shown at screenings.<br />However, the director helped make this showing possible.<br /><br />(Not a traditional film by NY standards. But I find the music very interesting. Not watching it as a history lesson.)<br /><br />http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119485/<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305090580/104-3649513-3555105?v=glance&amp;n=130<br /><br />&quot;I rented Kundun to further my quest to see all the Scorsese movies I can. I never expected such an incredible movie. I didn&#39;t want this movie to end. It&#39;s really difficult to describe how I feel about this movie since I have only viewed it once and was completely blown away, it left me in complete awe.<br /><br />Like most when I first started watching Scorsese I thought that he did brilliant gangster films and that was his thing, but I have recently discovered that this couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. First seeing The Last Temptation of Christ and now Kundun I wouldn&#39;t care if Scorsese ever made another gangster film. It is easy to see that he is an artistic genius, the acting in the film was great, but I could have watched it on mute and still have been amazed.<br /><br />If, like I was, you are unfamiliar with the Buddhist religion and the Chinese takeover of Tibet this film has even more to offer. Scorsese&#39;s risk of using real Buddhists to do all of the acting payed off better than I ever expected it would, the fact that we are hearing the story through the people it affected adds another level to this movie.&quot;<br /><br />

				See, thats my point! It&#39;s not just google doing it. Others do it as well and have been doing it way longer then google. The issue here lies deeper then just google and by boycotting google it isnt going to fix the problem. Its goes way beyond that.<br /><br />And at least google helped me and everyone else who searches on it to reserve some of my freedoms by not caving into the FBI for things I search for. I wont ever again use Yahoo, MSN, or AOL again to do searches on the net. (AOL, Now there is an evil company but should be a different topic altogether.)

				Dear Folks,<br /><br />Here&#39;s a piece on the Google situation from antiwar.com <br />editor Justin Raimondo, that raises some interesting issues. <br /><br />Hands Off Google!<br />http://www.antiwar.com/justin/?articleid=8467<br /><br />Interestingly he developes the issue raised by KilDaraSidhe that Googles recent standing up to the FBI&nbsp; by refusing to provide them search records might belie a <br />political factor behind the promotion of the Google-as-violator-of Chinese-civil-rights story in some quarters..<br /><br />http://www.axcessnews.com/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=7974<br /><br />http://news.google.com/news?sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=<br />GGGL%2CGGGL%3A2005-09%2CGGGL%3Aen&amp;q=google%2Bchina&amp;btnG=<br />Search%2BNews<br /><br />The column also cites a CNet article as a source for examining exactly WHAT Google has conceded to the PRC govt. (A specific so far undiscussed here and certainly lacking in the LXer article originally posted.)<br /><br />http://news.com.com/2100-1030_3-6031727.html<br /><br />According to Raimondos summation, the &quot;restrictions&quot; are fairly limited and are <br />easily circumvented by the power of everything else that www.google.cn can still provide access to including uncensored access to www.google.com<br /><br />Raimondo also notes that not only has Google stood up to the FBI here at home,<br />they are also standing up to the Eurocrats of the EU that are demanding their cooperation in the censoring of political websites that are deemed unacceptable.<br /><br />So how does two cases of Google standing up to state demands for censorship in the West jibe with their alleged failings in China? It maybe as suggested in other postings here that in so many words &quot;nobody is perfect&quot;. Or has the case against what Google is ACTUALLY DOING in China been inflated for political purposes?<br /><br />Lets look a little closer.<br /><br />

				Well, the US gov&#39;t does a LOT of business with China, despite the drum beat of &quot;freedom&quot; being banged out by the administration.&nbsp; Kind of talking out of both sides of their mouths.&nbsp; But I&#39;ve heard some people say that by Google even being available in China, they are helping the progression of democracy there.&nbsp; It&#39;s just chipping away, gradual like.&nbsp; I am still holding out judgement.&nbsp; There was a really good segment on this on the Brian Lerher show a couple weeks ago on WNYC radio.

				JTrane.......<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The points you raised I suspect are real valid.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I think I may have heard the Brian Leher program you mentioned: was the author of&nbsp; The Google Story one of the guests?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I recall someone called with a qestion that I thought what was much more relevent: Ought we not be concerned that Google has the archival powers to record the search behaviors of its users that it does. Now THAT I dont feel so sanguine about and I believe stands on its own as a cause of concern whether or not my scepticism on the China issue is bared out or not.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Best,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M Coat<br /><br />PS;&nbsp; &nbsp;There was an error in the URL I provided to &quot;Hands Off Goggle&quot;.
