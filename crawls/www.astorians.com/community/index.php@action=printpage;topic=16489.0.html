				Title: <strong>GENERAL ELECTION NOVEMBER 3, 2009 - VOTE LYNNE SERPE for CITY COUNCIL!!</strong><br />

				Hey Folks!<br />Be sure to get ALL the facts about the City Council candidates!!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Please do research on the candidates and don&#039;t simply re-elect the same person because you recognize the name! There are two main candidates: the incumbent, who has already had his two terms in office and voted to extend term limits so he could run again, and the challenger, Lynne Serpe, who will bring fresh ideas and actually work for the residents of Astoria! The incumbent, Vallone, voted to give himself a 25% pay increase during the current stagnant economy when Astoria schools can&#039;t even afford to hire substitute teachers. The current council member is running for re-election as BOTH a democrat AND a conservative - in the past, he&#039;s even run as a republican too. He gets more than 50% of his campaign funds from real estate developers and power companies. We NEED Lynne Serpe to take over as our City Council member. She is committed to 7-day library service, green industry instead of 40-story high-rise luxury condos, safer streets for ALL of the community, and a lot more. Get additional info on her plans at http://www.SerpeforCouncil.com (http://www.SerpeforCouncil.com).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And please, don&#039;t let Vallone&#039;s scare tactics get to you! He is obviously afraid of losing, so he just printed up entirely new campaign materials attacking the Green Party&#039;s national platform on the issue of military funding - which isn&#039;t even a local issue!!! City Council members DON&#039;T vote on that at all! If you are worried about local community safety, which is the real issue, just look at Vallone&#039;s record, or lack thereof! Graffiti has gone up despite his anti-graffiti platform! And one resident of 34th Street informed me that she called Vallone&#039;s office about getting more patrols on her street, and he told her he couldn&#039;t do anything to help her! It&#039;s time for a change! Vote for LYNNE SERPE on November 3rd!<br /><br />

				I voted for Serpe, because I refuse to support anyone who backed the repeal of term limits.&nbsp; That was just a disgrace.
