			I&#039;ve had several great haircuts from Space Salon on Ditmars. The haircuts for women are usually around $40-$50 +/-. But I feel like I&#039;m repeating myself.

			I still recommend SPAce too, though it can be pricey if you get dye, cut and blow dry- but its still my fav in astoria. I also tried GIGI&#039;s on 30th Ave but did not like the attitude in there or the prices.
