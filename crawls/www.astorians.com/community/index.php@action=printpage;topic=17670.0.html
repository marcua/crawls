				Looking at the comments on that article, I&#039;d say Aravella&#039;s support among the gay community is pretty much limited to other politicians. A lot of these commenters don&#039;t seem convinced at all:<br /><br />http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/03/early-lgbt-support-for-simotas.html#comments<br /><br />I certainly had never heard of her until I saw this post. I have, however, heard of this Jeremiah Frei-Pearson everyone keeps mentioning. He was at the big Marriage Equality rally at Atlas Park, he&#039;s been to our local Out Astoria events, and just about everything else I can think of. I&#039;ve never seen Aravella at any of these things so I guess the LGBT politicians are supporting her for the same reasons politicians always endorse each other.

				In reading the NY Daily News article, she is practically ordained by the local Democratic Right:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">These early endorsements are intended to send a message that the Democratic establishment is lining up behind Simotas, just in case anyone is thinking of challenging her.

				Frankly, the article&#039;s title is right--it&#039;s EARLY support. It&#039;s only March, the elections aren&#039;t &#039;til Fall. If this Jeremiah guy or somebody else decides to run, then we all have a choice to make. And we all have lots of time to get to know the candidates so we can make an informed choice. I know I, for one, would resent people telling me the choice is already made.

				I don’t know why you posted this twice Steve Crawford, but I am responding on both threads so in case you are only checking one.<br /><br />I can’t believe anyone can sincerely state that Simotas would have more support from the gay community than Jeremiah Frei-Pearson! Few if any Astorians who are politically active in the marriage equality movement or who were involved in the local movement to pressure George Onorato have heard of Simotas. Simotas may have secured approval from prominent gay politicians but I have yet to hear any praise from any actual Astorians involved in LGBT issues.<br /><br />All we know about Simotas now is that she has loyally served Mike Gianaris and the Queens Democratic party, but we know little to nothing about her community involvement and have yet to see if she has gone to the streets to stand up for the rights of any group, let alone the LGBT community.<br /><br />Frei-Pearson on the other hand has been an inspirational and dependable ally to the LGBT community and the marriage equality movement. It is absurd to accuse him of not being involved. I can only assume that the person posting that is ignorant of Astoria LGBT issues or is intentionally lying. <br /><br />Frei-Pearson has put in more time than most LGBT people on marriage equality! It is an issue near and dear to both he and his wife, both of whom could be seen regularly last summer handing out fliers on street corners, attending rallies, and at many meetings. Let me emphasize the point that Frei-Pearson has not just stood up in front of crowds of thousands arguing for marriage equality. He is not one of those “gay friendly” politicians who just shows up at the right PR moments. Frei-Pearson has done the truly thankless, gritty, at times personally risky task, time and time again of standing on the street asking strangers to support marriage equality and to become more active in their government. If there were more straight people like Frei-Pearson, there would no longer be “gay issues” because LGBT people would have full equality and complete social acceptance.<br /><br />Both Simotas and Frei- Pearson are pro marriage equality and this is a blessing for the LGBT community so now we need to see where they stand on all the OTHER issues. Challenge Frei-Pearson on a real issue in play but for God’s sake, don’t question his incredible service to the LGBT community. After all the time and work he has put in standing along side us, after all the times he has put himself out there to publically defend us, it is offensive to say that he isn’t involved in “any real community issues”… unless of course, you don’t think protecting the relationships and families of a growing number of Astorians with marriage equality is a “real” community issue. I hope the rumors of Frei-Pearson running are true. We don’t need more politicians whose records show consistent service to a party, we need more politicians whose records show them consistently standing for what is right. <br />

				I&#039;m relatively new to Astoria, so I&#039;m still learning about the political scene, so I haven&#039;t heard of Simotas before, and I don&#039;t see how the original article in the Daily News (and its comment thread) or the originator of this thread can be so confident that Simotas has the support of me and the rest of the LGBT community, or that Frei-Pearson can&#039;t get it. Simply saying it doesn&#039;t make it so. What&#039;s the source of this rumor anyway? The original article didn&#039;t mention him, just the sort of smug line suggesting nobody should bother opposing the hand-picked party favorite. His name got brought up pretty disparagingly and seemingly unprovoked in the comment thread, though. And how do you know the LGBT community and even elected officials on Simotas&#039;s side wouldn&#039;t also support him if he is indeed running?<br /><br />Anyway, the LGBT community has learned too many times that many candidates will court the gay vote and money but won&#039;t necessarily be there when the going gets rough, and just lining up behind the party favorite isn&#039;t enough. Maybe she will prove herself (and I&#039;d expect the same of JPF, too), but so far the only thing I gathered from this article was exactly that sort of empty, opportunistic courting, posturing, name-dropping, and threatening potential and rumored opponents--with exactly nothing about what she&#039;s actually done for the LGBT community.

				I could be wrong....but I don&#039;t think Jeremiah wants to run. When Sen Onorato first announced his retirement, there was a draft Jeremiah movement and he took himself out of the running. And I can&#039;t recall any indication of his wanting to run for anything else.

				I hope that Jeremiah Frei-Pearson does run.&nbsp; He should run.&nbsp; Primaries are good for our democracy. <br /><br />For years he has been active in this community -- and when I say &quot;this community&quot; I mean Astoria -- his work for with Western Queens for Marriage Equity only represents a portion of his community involvement -- he has done excellent work with Power for the People, helping get the blackout settlement from Con Ed in 2006.&nbsp; He worked really hard in the community during the Obama campaign.&nbsp; He&#039;s a real leader and a person of integrity. <br /><br />Simotas might have the endorsement of some electeds, she better, because she was picked by the politicians.&nbsp; She seems nice enough, but I don&#039;t think she&#039;s going to have the same desire to reform Albany that Jeremiah will.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				New to the Board but not new to Astoria.&nbsp; I ran into this woman at the Powhattan Club a month or so ago and she was great.&nbsp; I think the issue is that while her and Jeremiah (who i have also met) are very similar on the LGBT issue and obviously Quinn, Van Bramer and Dromm agree and think she would be a better leader. While it doesn&#039;t mean the entire LGBT community (I am a member) will support her it shows that she is on the right side of the issue. <br /><br />I follow local politics as a hobby and for me marriage equality isn&#039;t really an issue for the Assembly. I believe it has passed easily each year.&nbsp; From her speech at Powhattan she was great on other issues but Im willing to give other candidates the benefit of doubt. <br /><br />

				Too be honest I haven&#039;t gone to the Powhattan that much over the years so I dont know if she goes. But she seemed to know everyone in the room. She was good. She talked about need for larger hospital, the power plants and something about some rally to save W train. I briefly chatted with her after the event and she was great.&nbsp; And most importantly she talked about her support of marriage equality. My partner just saw her at town hall meeting with Maloney and said she was pretty good but was talking about the crisis in greece so it was somewhat over his head. <br /><br />As for a slice I love Rosarios on 31st near Ditmars.

				I went to the DFNYC candidate forum tonight to hear both Assembly candidates speak.&nbsp; I arrived a few minutes late and caught what seemed like the second half of Jeremiah Frei-Pearson (http://jeremiahfp.org/)&#039;s opening.&nbsp; I was surprised to learn that Simotas didn&#039;t show up.&nbsp; Having clicked on the link earlier, I knew she was unconfirmed, but seriously?&nbsp; <br /><br />In a local election that is decided by less than 10,000 voters, you would think that the candidates are looking for as much public face time as they can get.&nbsp; As someone said on the earlier Simotas thread (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=17670.15), she&#039;s going to have to do more than ask for money on her website to get any votes (http://www.aravellasimotas.com (http://www.aravellasimotas.com)).<br /><br />The crowd at the DFNYC event was well-informed and asked some pretty good questions of Frei-Pearson.&nbsp; His campaign seems to revolve around reforming Albany.&nbsp; I particularly liked the idea of implementing term limits in our State government.&nbsp; As he said, the seat belongs to the people, and no one should be able to sit in one for forty years.&nbsp; He also talked about Campaign Finance reform as another way of ensuring more fair elections.<br /><br />I have to say, I liked his ideas but also his honesty.&nbsp; There were some suggestions from the crowd - like on residential parking permits - where he didn&#039;t seem completely committed to endorsing the idea, but he would say that he liked the idea, would look into it, and have a better answer later.&nbsp; It&#039;s obvious he&#039;s not trying to make himself out to be a know-it-all savior type.&nbsp; He&#039;s real, willing to take input from the constituents and have a conversation about it, and honest about his thought process.<br /><br />This is the first time I&#039;ve seen Frei-Pearson in a forum/debate (is it a debate if the other person doesn&#039;t show up?) and I was really impressed with him.&nbsp; I felt like he really connected.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking forward to hearing more from him but also from Simotas.&nbsp; I want to hear what she stands for - aside from just asking for money.&nbsp; <br />

				I&#039;m sure DFNYC will endorse in the race. I assume they will endorse Frei-Pearson he is in a leadership position, he is a Co-Chair. Its funny I used to be a member of the group until he and a few others came along and started using the group as a self promotion tool.&nbsp; First he wanted to run for City Council, then he wanted to run for State Senate and now he wants to run for Assembly.

				I don&#039;t think Aravella is a one issue candidate.&nbsp; She&#039;s been a member of Community Board 1 for over 8 years and has been active with UCCA, the largest civic association in Astoria for a long time as well.&nbsp; She&#039;s a lifelong resident of Astoria, over 31 years and she worked on the campaigns of the Vallones and Mike Gianaris.&nbsp; I know she&#039;s been particularly involved in women&#039;s issues, immigration (she was born in Zimbabwe herself and is an immigrant) and has worked on Greek concerns for many years.&nbsp; I&#039;m very impressed with her (and in the interests of full disclosure, have endorsed her - I serve as the President of the Powhatan Regular Democratic Club which is behind her and my boss, Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, is officially endorsing her on Saturday).<br /><br />That all being said, I am a huge fan of Jeremiah as well (we&#039;re both congregants at Trinity Lutheran Church and he&#039;s also a member of Powhatan, and has been an incredible advocate on marriage equality).&nbsp; He&#039;s truly one of the best people I know and would also be an outstanding Assemblymember.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll be updating the website soon - I was surprised that the splashpage is only the donation page, but that happens with campaigns sometimes - they roll out the website in pieces.&nbsp;

				she was very good. She spoke about the importance of marriage equality and said she fully supports it.&nbsp; She also spoke about the problem of LGBT homeless youth and fighting hate crimes and basically just talked about all the work she has done in Astoria. I was very impressed. Pearson was ok but he seemed more concerned with being &quot;more&quot; for marriage equality. Also as a member of the club i found it interesting that Jeremiah brought a small crowd with him that was rude to Simotas and then asked him very softball questions. It was almost like he was afraid to engage.

				I am also a board member (and one of the longest serving members) of the Lesbian and Gay Democratic Club of Queens.&nbsp; I thought both Jeremiah and Aravella did well at the meeting - I&#039;m happy to see two candidates who are strongly in favor of equality - candidates who will continue the support of marriage equality shown by our outgoing Assemblymember and soon to be State Senator, Mike Gianaris.

				Thanks, Dirk - I appreciate your telling us more about Simotas.&nbsp; I found the fact that her website has simply a donation page to be off-putting.&nbsp; It makes it look like she&#039;s more interested in raising money than telling us what she stands for.<br /><br />I&#039;ll look forward to future events that I can attend, as well as an update to her website, to give me a better impression of her and a better idea as to how Jeremiah and Simotas differ in their philosophies/stances.

				I do hear the concerns.&nbsp; Gianaris, like Simotas, was picked by the established leadership in Astoria when he first ran, but he&#039;s been remarkably independent and has pushed a really aggressive reform agenda.&nbsp; <br /><br />While Aravella Simotas is Mike&#039;s candidate, she is her own person and I wouldn&#039;t think they&#039;re going to agree on all issues - no two candidates do.&nbsp; Aravella is a remarkably accomplished attorney and an articulate voice in Astoria.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think we&#039;re lucky to have two good candidates running - either way Astoria wins.

				I think it&#039;s always better to have a well-fleshed out website, but candidates often get the fundraising part of the website up first to aid in getting the donations in to pay for the printing of their literature, their signs, their office space, staff and their website. <br /><br />I hope they flesh out Aravella&#039;s site quickly. &nbsp;<br /><br />Jeremiah&#039;s site is beautiful - very impressive.

				From what McDirk was saying she has spent her whole life in Astoria serves on a bunch of local boards including the community board. I find it insulting that people are now attacking Danny Dromm, Jimmy Van Bramer and Christine Quinn as backroom politicians. Also Michael Gianaris has always been a friend of the LGBT community. Could you explain your reason for being so negative MacUser or are you just a plant by the other candidate?

I got my heart broken on November 22, 1963 and again when I was working for Bobby and staying up waiting for results at 2:00 in the morning. I am now tiring of the status quo. They all seem to be coming at us in different forms; different genders, different sexual preferences and races. But, they are all of the exact same mold. I no longer believe that party politics is the way to do the right thing for our Community. And starting this early is going to lead to additional expenditures for campaigning. How is that going to help decision making for residents? <br /><br />I am not nasty, I am just weary of the same old, the same old, crap.<br /><br />Why did it take so long to get Onoroto to be forced into retirement?

				I feel compelled to comment here on last night&#039;s forum since my name is attached to the DFNYC linkup here in Astoria.&nbsp; As many of the people on this blog have seen, I have been posting DFNYC events here for almost 3 years.&nbsp; I wear a lot of hats here in Astoria, DFNYC co-host as one of them.&nbsp; I love this organization and have worked hard for the ideals that they stand for.&nbsp; Last night, I was not in attendance because I was attending the rehearsal class for my son&#039;s baptism coming up. <br /><br />Last night&#039;s forum was not promoted accurately.&nbsp; Jeremiah knew very well that Aravella Simotas was not attending the forum weeks in advance.&nbsp; His promotion of this event as a &quot;forum&quot; when he knew all too well that this was not going to be a forum is disappointing.&nbsp; This was a &quot;meet and greet&quot; for Jeremiah Frei-Pearson.&nbsp; It should have been promoted that way. It should have been in a non-publicly funded space that was appropriate for a meet and greet and not the Greater Astoria Historical Society.&nbsp; There would have been nothing wrong with him being honest about the event.&nbsp; People would have come to hear him speak!! There would be no shame in that. <br /><br />So instead, he stands up and smacks an opponent for not being somewhere that he knew she wasn&#039;t going to be.&nbsp; That isn&#039;t what DFNYC is all about.&nbsp; A good government group like DFNYC deserves better.&nbsp; The fact that he attached my name to an email promoting the event that was misleading is frustrating for me personally, but I am a big boy I&#039;ll survive&nbsp; :-).&nbsp; I am more disappointed that the people in attendance didn&#039;t get what they came in expecting and everyone looks silly.&nbsp; <br /><br />I will be strongly supporting Aravella Simotas for this seat because I think she can do the better job and bring back to Astoria the resources that we need. Jeremiah is a nice guy who I respect both personally and professionally and I have worked with him to do some good things.&nbsp; &nbsp;But on this one, he made a mistake that disappoints me.&nbsp; And he will not be the person I will be supporting for Assembly.&nbsp;

				I was not at the meeting but am enormously upset by Costas comments. He is a well known activist and respected for his work in the progressive movement. He is saying that Jeremiah forged his signature on an evite and in that evite he made it seem that Jeremiah&#039;s opponent (who Costas supports) was ducking a debate. Which Costas says was rigged. I would like to hear from Jeremiah on this before I form an opinion.&nbsp; But this is startling news. Why hasnt Jeremiah responded ? :-(

And notice the line &quot;Every effort has been made to accomodate schedules. As best we can tell, there is no legitimate campaign conflict that should prevent any candidate from attending. &quot; Well its pretty obvious Jeremiah knew Aravella Simotas was not going to be there. I mean, Day One and this guy is making up baloney ???? Thats really, really weird. <br /><br />Why would he do that ? So he could attack her later, knowing she wouldnt be there ?

The other announced candidate is Aravella Simotas.&nbsp; I encourage you all to come with your questions and to hear from us both before you make your decision.<br />&nbsp;<br />Best,<br />Jeremiah &amp; Costa

				I dont concur. I am not sure why being active in the civil rights movement gives you credibility to say that a perosn like Aravella has no credibility ? She has been active in local civic groups for ten years. She has been a member of the Community Board for ten years. She was born and raised in Astoria. She went to kindergarden, grade school and high school in Astoria and college and law school in NYC. <br /><br />Jeremiah moved into the district 6 months ago once Mike Gianaris said he was running for Senate. He didnt attend the schools in the neighborhood. He didnt live here until 6 months ago. He had been active for about a year, when he became active in the marrigae equality issue (and deserves credit for his work)&nbsp; and he announced that he was running for public office AT THE RALLY ! I mean lets GET REAL !<br /><br />Maybe you cant see it, but one person seems like an opportunist and the other person seems like they have lived here their whole lives and volunteered and is now being supported by local electeds who have done a good job for us and citywide progressives. Christine Quinn, Danny Dromm, Jimmy Van Bramer, Mike Gianaris and Carolyn Maloney are all hacks now ? Cause they support Aravella ? Cause they dont support Jeremiah ? Really ?<br /><br />And by the way, she will be the first WOMAN to serve in the NYS Legislature representing our neighborhood. Thats not a good thing ?<br /><br />I am leaning her way, but it seems that the Jeremiah supporters do nothing but attack her.&nbsp;

				Why do my comments appear manuipulative ? It seems that while everyone was bashing Aravella Simotas as some &quot;unknown quanity&quot;, that was OK. But I am being manipulative when I point out some facts ? Well, that seems rather unfair.<br /><br />I think that comments on her have been inappropiate. If anyone here had attened a Community Board 1 meeting, or a Astoria Civic meeting, or a Taminent Democratic Club meeting, or a host of other groups she has been active in, they would have met Aravella. And I think, they would have liked her.<br /><br />She could be the first woman to represent Astoria in the NYS Legislature. She is a lawyer. She went to locals schools. She is active in her community. She has the support of local and citywide officials who are champions of progressive causes. She is progressive. And yet, Jeremiahs supporters dismiss her.

I know that because I took like 300 pictures and even posted a link to my flickr folder for those pics. And yes I clearly recall Jeremiah&#039;s speech. As much as I recall McDirk&#039;s speech. But, for the life of me, I can&#039;t recall Jeremiah saying that he was running for a position that, at that moment, did not have in opening. <br /><br />I have a feeling that is because his only concern, at that day, was the fact that he believed that I should be able to marry my partner if I wanted to. <br /><br />Now, second off, because you brought it up.<br /><br />I once had a female professor in my poliSci class once say that she hopes we have moved on from the days that we should vote for someone because they are black, female, gay etc. <br /><br />Give me freaking qualifications damn it. <br /><br />I have heard Jeremiah speak passionately at a Marriage Equality rally. And while that act is a qualifier for me, it is not the end all of why I should vote for him. <br /><br />Aravella obviously has connections. Why else would one be appointed to a Community Board? But to go beyond that. Did she go to Sen Oranoto&#039;s office to lobby for gay rights? Did she go to Albany? Jeremiah did. <br /><br />And yes it may sound single issue....but it isn&#039;t. What I am getting at is that I have seen Jeremiah step up and take action in a public and vocal way. Can you tell me of one time the candidate you support has?<br /><br />Again, I am not attacking.<br /><br />I really want to know the effing facts!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />

Jeremiah moved, right after Gianaris said he was running for the State Senate. He didnt live in the Assembly district. He moved in order to run for the office.

Well thats strange. It just all seems to be some contrived story of Jeremiah as some urban, tough guy. And quite honestly, bless him and Carla, but I feel that he uses his interracial marriage to promote himself. I have lots of friends in interracial marriages and its SOOOOOOOO normal. Thats another thing he has posted all over YouTube. In 2010 ????? <br /><br />Its just plain weird and it all seems like some kind of Broadway production and we the voters are the audience.

				These are some pretty serious charges leveled against Jeremiah.<br /><br />1) The claim is he forged a well known activists name on an email.<br /><br />2) the second claim is that Jeremiah sent an email out to progressive groups saying that he knew off no reasons his opponent wouldnt show up to a &quot;forum&quot;, when Costas, the Co-chair of the group, says that Jeremiah new several weeks in advance that Simotas was not actually showing up at the event because of a scheduling issue. <br /><br />This is serious stuff. Why hasnt Jeremiah or his campaign rsponded ? Anyone how to contact him ? His side of the story surely deserves to be aired and I suggest we all withhold judgement until we hear both sides of this story.<br /><br />P.S. Brrrrrrrrr ! Its cold outside

				So here is the situation. Jeremiah Frei Pearson sent out this email below to progressive groups throughout NYC:<br /><br />Dear Astoria Linkup Friends,<br />&nbsp;<br />I apologize for the late notice, but I&#039;m very excited about this month&#039;s linkup.&nbsp; DFNYC and the Astoria Historical Society have put together a candidate forum for the 36th Assembly District.&nbsp; The linkup/forum is TONIGHT (Wednesday) at 7:00 at the Astoria Historical Society (35-20 Broadway, 4th Floor).&nbsp; This is a joint linkup, so we will be joined by folks from around the city and from our community.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />The forum will be moderated by Dan Miner, the Chair of the New York City Sierra Club.&nbsp; All candidates have been invited and every effort has been made to accomodate schedules.&nbsp; As best we can tell, there is no legitimate campaign conflict that should prevent any candidate from attending.&nbsp; I will definitely be there and I&#039;m looking forward to seeing all of you there as well.<br />&nbsp;<br />Full disclosure:&nbsp; I am a candidate in this race. The other announced candidate is Aravella Simotas.&nbsp; I encourage you all to come with your questions and to hear from us both before you make your decision.<br />&nbsp;<br />Best,<br />Jeremiah &amp; Costa<br /><br />Costa, a well known community activist and major progressive figure in NYC had this responce:<br /><br />I feel compelled to comment here on last night&#039;s forum since my name is attached to the DFNYC linkup here in Astoria.&nbsp; As many of the people on this blog have seen, I have been posting DFNYC events here for almost 3 years.&nbsp; I wear a lot of hats here in Astoria, DFNYC co-host as one of them.&nbsp; I love this organization and have worked hard for the ideals that they stand for.&nbsp; Last night, I was not in attendance because I was attending the rehearsal class for my son&#039;s baptism coming up. <br /><br />Last night&#039;s forum was not promoted accurately.&nbsp; Jeremiah knew very well that Aravella Simotas was not attending the forum weeks in advance.&nbsp; His promotion of this event as a &quot;forum&quot; when he knew all too well that this was not going to be a forum is disappointing.&nbsp; This was a &quot;meet and greet&quot; for Jeremiah Frei-Pearson.&nbsp; It should have been promoted that way. It should have been in a non-publicly funded space that was appropriate for a meet and greet and not the Greater Astoria Historical Society.&nbsp; There would have been nothing wrong with him being honest about the event.&nbsp; People would have come to hear him speak!! There would be no shame in that. <br /><br />So instead, he stands up and smacks an opponent for not being somewhere that he knew she wasn&#039;t going to be.&nbsp; That isn&#039;t what DFNYC is all about.&nbsp; A good government group like DFNYC deserves better.&nbsp; The fact that he attached my name to an email promoting the event that was misleading is frustrating for me personally, but I am a big boy I&#039;ll survive&nbsp; .&nbsp; I am more disappointed that the people in attendance didn&#039;t get what they came in expecting and everyone looks silly.&nbsp; <br /><br />I will be strongly supporting Aravella Simotas for this seat because I think she can do the better job and bring back to Astoria the resources that we need. Jeremiah is a nice guy who I respect both personally and professionally and I have worked with him to do some good things.&nbsp; &nbsp;But on this one, he made a mistake that disappoints me.&nbsp; And he will not be the person I will be supporting for Assembly.&nbsp; <br /><br />Waiting for Jeremiah to let us know what his side of the story is on this emerging controversy.

				Well thats not very nice. Who am I bashing ? Is this a closed forum ? are you allowed on only if you support certain candidates ? I have been polite. I havent made any personal attacks or spurious claims. There were ten posting saying this and that about Aravella Simotas. Some were very mean. I didnt see you jumping in. I didnt see you threatning anyone with &quot;the Board.&quot; What are we in grade school here ? Now, there is a claim by an active person on this board that a candidate for local public office possibly did some inappropiate things. We havent heard his side of the story. He professes to be all about openess and the debate of ideas. I would like to hear from him. I would like to debate those idea. Thats it.&nbsp;

				I consider myself friendly with both Jeremiah and Aravella. &nbsp;Jeremiah goes to Trinity with my friend Dirk, and I was part of the advisory committee that ran Western Queens for Marriage Equality. Aravella and I met through some common friends on Community Board 1 and some common friends through the Helenic Society. &nbsp;She also exchanges recipes with me often.<br /><br />On personal levels I get along with both and think they are genuinely nice people. &nbsp;There are many of us who have to maneuver our way through this election because of the insular nature of a small community like Astoria.<br /><br />I have no desire to speak against either candidate. &nbsp;I have been helped last year by the Aravella/Gianaris camp on some unemployment insurance troubles--and am extremely grateful for the diligence in helping me deal with a very bad employer separation situation. &nbsp;I also respect highly Mike Gianaris additionally because of his constant support for LGBT issues, and the change he has brought to the political spectrum here in Astoria. &nbsp;Further, I respect Daniel Dromm and Jimmy Van Bramer, both personal friends and leaders of the LGBT community that have integrity and do not just go with the political machine--but actually stand for what they believe. &nbsp;I am surprised at the dismissal of their endorsement by my friends who support Jeremiah, and accusations tantamount to calling the same leaders political hacks. &nbsp;Jimmy has been integral in molding the Queens library system to the flagship that it is now, and he has been actively seeking office for many years, and has dedicated himself to our LGBT causes. &nbsp;Daniel Dromm has been an activist well into the 80s and served our Education system and the UFT when our County leaders did not. &nbsp;He lead a campaign against the County candidate this past year and won. Neither of these two are county &quot;Yes&quot; Men. <br /><br />Their endorsement speaks words to me about Aravella and the work she has done with Community Board 1 and the UACC. &nbsp;And if you know anything about Rose Marie and the UACC, you know that they are a civic organization that does not cow-tow to political leaders.<br /><br />I like Jeremiah, and I have worked with him on marriage equality. &nbsp;He was an active advocate, like so many of us; and he was a leader in 2009, like so many of us that joined the Coalition that is Western Queens for Marriage Equality.<br /><br />I am fortunate to know both of the candidates, and grateful that both are on the right page with the issues that mean the most to me. &nbsp;I know that whoever wins, this district will be a vote for YES on marriage equality.<br /><br />However, given my experience and friendship with both, the work of Aravella on Community Board 1 and the UACC, and the endorsements of leaders I respect, and the help I&#039;ve received from the Aravella/Gianaris camp, I am going to endorse and support Aravella Simotas. &nbsp;

				A friend of mine dragged me to the Taminent Club in Astoria yesterday. In all my years in Astoria I have always driven by the building and been curious about what is inside. Simotas was holding some sort of rally it was actually very fun. The room was packed. About 250 people in the room and everyone very excited. She spoke and was quite impressive. She spoke about fixing the MTA, cleaning up Albany and about ensuring that discrimination is a thing of the past. I was very excited at the end of the event and even got to talk to her a little bit and she was great.

				I tried contacting Jeremiah. I dont have a number for his campaign. I sent him an email from his public sites. I recieved no responce. I spoke to friends who also emailed him. They recieved no responce. <br /><br />Are we to believe that at this point Jeremiah DOESNT know that people are looking for a responce on why he forged Costas name and why he sent out an email that made believe he didnt know Aravella had told DFNYC two weeks before the event that she couldnt attend ? <br /><br />I mean, Costas apparently, according to his post, sent Jeremiah an email himself ! This is upsetting. we deserve to know whether this campaign has started this way. its just a real, real simple question.

				Thats a really good point.

				I have not participated in this web forum before but I&#039;m a resident of Astoria and a vocal supporter of Jeremiah&#039;s candidacy. I am not a paid spokesman for his campaign but I wanted to be clear about where I stand on this race before I said my piece. I cannot respond to any of the accusations--many unsubstantiated--made on this forum. I can only speak for myself and why I support Jeremiah.<br /><br />Jeremiah Frei-Pearson has the courage and integrity to be a true leader in a time when our government in New York is known more for scandal and corruption. He has a strong public record of fighting for the little guy. He works as an attorney for Children&#039;s Rights, where he helps get children out of broken foster systems into caring, safe, and healthy homes. He&#039;s well known in Astoria as part of the legal team who won a $63 million dollar settlement from ConEd to compensate the victims of the 2006 Queens Blackout and fund neighborhood Greening projects to improve the quality of life in our communities. Jeremiah rallied with the gay and lesbian community to fight for marriage rights and helped found Western Queens for Marriage Equality. He works with the Long Island City Alliance to keep poorly-planned development from disfiguring our neighborhoods.<br /><br />It&#039;s been mentioned on this forum several times that Jeremiah&#039;s opponent is a lifelong resident of Astoria. Jeremiah may not have lived in Astoria his entire life but in a community as rich with immigrants as ours, I don&#039;t feel being a lifelong resident is necessary to hold public office. Neither does the law, which only requires 5 years of State residence and 12 months in the District to run for the Assembly. Jeremiah more than meets both qualifications. Many of us have moved here from somewhere else but few have worked as hard for our communities as Jeremiah. His candidacy has been met with enthusiastic support by many residents--myself obviously included.<br /><br />I have no desire to speak against Jeremiah&#039;s opponent in this race. She has the endorsement of many worthy figures in our community. But it takes more than endorsements to win the support of this Astorian. Our government is making headlines for scandal practically every week and we need candidates with a strong public record of working for our communities, a history of fighting when the odds are tough, and a willingness to stand up to authority when necessary. Jeremiah Frei-Pearson has all of those qualities in abundance and I am proud to support him.

				I&#039;d just like to point something out.<br /><br />&quot;Sting55&quot; has made exactly 26 posts on this board: http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?action=profile;u=5500<br /><br />Of those posts, 21 have been about Jeremiah Frei-Pearson: http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?action=profile;u=5500;sa=showPosts<br /><br />Sting55 has virtually nothing else to say on this board except attacks against Jeremiah. This individual obviously came here with an agenda. I&#039;m being straight-up: I just joined this forum tonight (though mcdirk has been asking me to forever so I check the forum periodically) and my very first comment was in support of Jeremiah. I live in the District and I support Jeremiah and I was moved to comment when I saw all the talk about this race--and specifically when I saw the unanswered attacks from people like Sting55.<br /><br />Sting55 is not being candid. Sting55 said, &quot;I am leaning her way, but it seems that the Jeremiah supporters do nothing but attack her.&quot; Sting55 is obviously more than leaning Aravella&#039;s way. This individual is the one who&#039;s literally done almost nothing but make attacks.<br /><br />This is school-yard nonsense and borderline trolling. No wonder Moderators are raising eyebrows.

				Sting55, all I&#039;m doing is casting a little light on what looks like a pretty clear agenda. You can cross-examine me all you like but you seem to be well informed by your &quot;friend&quot; in the Simotas campaign so I expect you can Google the Board of Election requirements just like I did. I don&#039;t expect you&#039;ll find any nonsense about &quot;if the election were held today.&quot; Heck, that almost sounds like pollster-speak. And I don&#039;t think you&#039;re here to &quot;share thoughts and debate issues.&quot; You can claim you want free discussion all you like but if you ask me, you&#039;re the one with an itchy trigger finger. I think you&#039;re here on a hit-job and a look at your posting-record confirms that as far as I&#039;m concerned. You may suddenly get deferential when people call you on your agenda but that doesn&#039;t seem to be fooling anybody.

				I dont know why you are attacking me.<br /><br />There was an earlier discussion and someone questioned my claim regarding the fact that Jeremiah moved in to this Assembly District recently. I said that the Board of Elections confirmed that.

Less ?<br /><br />I mean you can attack me all you like, but I would shut up if you just told everyone the answer.

				I&#039;m not attacking you, Sting55. I&#039;m just calling you out for trying to cast aspersions on a candidate you&#039;re gunning after for some reason. You&#039;re trying to raise all kinds of spurious questions to see what you can get to stick. You can call that &quot;honest debate&quot; all you want but you&#039;re not fooling anybody. Now I&#039;ve said all I&#039;m going to say on this. Maybe you&#039;ll give me some kinda gimmicky ticking clock &#039;til I answer one or another of the questions you&#039;re manufacturing but I&#039;ve already wasted enough time on these shenanigans of yours.

				So you said in your earlier post that you KNEW that Jeremiah was eligible to run for Assembly and that you KNEW the facts regarding when he registered to vote in this Assembly District.<br /><br />But you have posted three times since then and havent been willing to restate what is actually public record.<br /><br />You wont tell the folks on this message board what date Jeremiah registered to vote in the Assembly District.<br /><br />And you wont respond to Costas charges.

				<br /><br />I would like to know when there may be a public forum where the candidates attend and could address questions that have been raised.<br /><br />I know Costa is likely very busy, but he may know JFP better than most. Would Costa agree with some that whatever the result of the election, that it could be a win for the folks of Astoria?<br /><br />What would be the pros and cons of JFP in the Assembly?<br /><br />Encouraged to know that AS had a good welcome. Readers may want to see her introduction on a revised website. Even being fairly critical, I think it merits at least a strong B.<br />Both candidates should have points about the budget mess that Albany is dealing with.<br /><br />What are their views on bridge tolls? A soda tax? Any return of a commuter tax? What spending cuts are reasonable? Will they give priority to education or healthcare? What would prevent officials from increasing state debt?<br /><br />I would like to hear soon in the campaign of the candidates past support for officials. I know the ballot is secret, but did JFP support and vote for Gianaris and Onorato.<br />Has AS supported term limits in the past, did she support Thompson or Bloomberg for re-election?<br /><br />

				Good points TRX. I am heading over to the Board of Elections today.

				So, I checked at the Queen&#039;s Board of Elections and Jeremiah Frei Pearson only registered to vote in the 36th Assembly District 5 months ago.&nbsp; <br /><br />He moved into the district in order to run.<br /><br />And incredibely, if you could believe this, but it is fact, Jeremiah actually DID NOT vote in the 2008 Presidential Primary.<br /><br />Can you believe that ? The guy who actually talks about President Obama endlessly, did not actually vote in that election.<br /><br />And more insanely, for all you progressives and gay folk, Jeremiah did&nbsp; not vote in the general election of Kerry versus Bush. Can you believe that ? He never showed up to vote for Obama and never showed up to vote against George Bush. A complete and utter bullshit artist.<br /><br />&nbsp;I am going to post his great voting record online tommorow. What a complete phony.

				TRX, I agree with the reforms you listed. While we might disagree on what should be cut, the gimmicks the state has been doing for years, I fear, will come back to bite us in the ass.<br /><br />One thing that impresses me is the financial stability of New York City. While we may be facing drastic cuts such as in education, this is due to the state. In fact, we just got Governors Island because the State can&#039;t finance it properly. <br /><br />Mayor Bloomberg deserves props for his fiscal responsibility and I wish the state had adopted his actions that have left the city in a good state while we go through this recession. <br /><br />And I hope that both candidates agree with what you posted. It is time to do away with the gimmicks and corruption in Albany.

				One of the reason Albany is out of control is voter apathy. If the politicians think voters are paying no attention, then they just kowtow to special interests.<br /><br />This is why I am completely amazed that Jeremiah Frei Pearson failed to vote in last Presidential primary and he didnt even vote at all in the General Election against George Bush when Kerry got the election stolen from him.<br /><br />I mean we all miss some elections, but skipping presidential elections ?

				It doesnt seem fun to me. Jeremiah has a horrible record.<br /><br />1) He moved into this Assembly district 5 months ago just to run for office.<br /><br />2) He failed to vote in last years Presidential Primary and he failed to vote in the Kerry/Bush election. What kind of person&nbsp; does that ?<br /><br />3) He is a tool for Con Edison. The backroom deal he cut to give Astorians a bunch of trees as a swap for Con Edison almost killing the elderly in Astoria with their 2 week blackout reign of terror, will certainly be an issue for Jeremiah to explain.<br /><br />4) In his first weeks in the campaign, he has sent out false emails forging peoples names on the email.<br /><br />This is fun ?

				sting55, almost every message you have posted on this message board has been designed to cast Jeremiah Frei-Pearson in a negative light.<br /><br />Considering that Astoria has never really had much a choice in viable candidates for office (other than what the local political establishment decides for us), I think voters should be receptive to hearing both candidates and decide who they want for office.<br /><br />Also, I think the Powhatan Democratic Club should invite Jeremiah Frei-Pearson to speak at the club meeting (even though its leadership is backing Aravella Simotas) in the interest of allowing its members to learn more about the candidates and issues.

				Mangopango:<br /><br />so the Con Edison scam was a good deal ?<br /><br />I lose electricity for two weeks, the merchants lose their food (tens of thousasnd of dollars in value), people had to move to hotels for a few days, some elderly had heart attacks and died, and Con Edison was generous enough to not charge people elcetricity for that same period and gave then $100 bucks credit (not even $100 cash, $100 bucks to buy more electricity.)<br /><br />100 bucks credit ?<br /><br />For the tens and thousands who suffered ? <br /><br />And that was a &quot;great deal&quot; ? <br /><br />Sounds like a bunch of people who have no political sophistication got used by Con Edison and were so happy to see their names in the newspapers that they sold out the people of Western Queens.<br /><br />Now those same people are trying to run for public office. Good luck.

				Why dont you answer the questions instead of attacking me ?<br /><br />As Jeremiahs spokesperson, you dont think he is going to have to face people who think the Con Edison deal was a scam ?<br /><br />As Jeremiahs spokesperson, you dont think he is going to have to answer questions on why he failed to vote in the Presidential primary last year of in the Preseidential general election the time before ?<br /><br />As Jeremiahs spokesperson, you dont think he is going to have to answer longtime residents and activists who will ask him why he deserves to get elected if he moved into the district 5 months ago ?<br /><br />Are you going to attack them also ?<br /><br />I mean, some kind of responce to these questions from you, a strong supporter of his, would be appropiate I believe.<br /><br />Thank you.

				The thing is, sting55, the impression I&#039;ve gotten from all your political posts (your disrespect and derision (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=12274.msg169281#msg169281) toward many of those who live in this community is another thing) is that you do not have an open mind from the get-go.&nbsp; You are obviously supporting Simotas, and there is nothing wrong with that.&nbsp; However, I find you faux astonishment regarding Frei-Pearson as distasteful and unbecoming.&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t it be better to talk up Simotas instead of tearing down her opponent?&nbsp; You could do her campaign a great service by telling us how great she is and what an excellent candidate she is for this position, instead of focusing so much on the negatives.<br /><br />Jeremiah is having a kickoff event (http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=115368135147558) next week (April 26, 6pm, at Athens Square Park) at what seems like an open and inclusive event.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t know about the Simotas event until after the fact, which was disappointing to me (though, I&#039;m not sure if it was open to all - Dirk, Costa, do you know those details?).&nbsp; I would kindly suggest that you attend this Monday event and perhaps even ask Jeremiah the questions you have.&nbsp; I believe the best and most accurate answer would come from the source.&nbsp; Face to face interaction can generate excellent results.&nbsp; I imagine he&#039;d welcome the opportunity to speak to you and to help you understand where he&#039;s coming from.<br /><br />In my opinion, based on what I&#039;ve read so far, both candidates have something to offer to Astoria - it&#039;s great to have choices!

While I am a progressive, I am registered as a Democrat because the action occurs mainly in the primaries. Not bashing the party. I&#039;m pretty happy at the moment.

I am inclined to vote for Jeremiah because of his work on Marriage Equality. However, McDirk&#039;s and Costa&#039;s support of Simotas is important to me because I respect them. I think the only controversy for me and others is the feeling that the political machine has already determined who the candidate should be without the people themselves getting a chance to get a feel of both candidates. <br /><br />

				I attended the Simotas opening event.&nbsp; It was not as showy as JFP&#039;s looks like it will be, but it was open to the public, and my email invitation said to share it with anyone who would be interested, and I did.&nbsp; It was very well attended, and Simotas made Pistacchio herself.&nbsp; I do not think they spent a lot of $$ on the event, despite her financials saying she raised a lot of money by that point, but as such, I&#039;m more inclined to support her financially because it wasn&#039;t that extravagant.<br /><br />Carolyn Maloney and Joe Crowley was there, as were a lot of electeds, and Mustafah who I believe was a potential candidate, but had chosen to support her instead.&nbsp; Our presumed Senator-elect Gianaris was also there.&nbsp; There were kids and adults.&nbsp; <br /><br />Gianaris is someone who has brought progressive politics to the area, and who did not need goading by WQfME to vote the right way in the Assembly.&nbsp; He is not corrupt, and has voted right on all of the LGBT issues, and I would assume well acquainted with JFP.&nbsp; In fact I know many in JFP&#039;s camp who claim to support and like Gianaris.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how that is going to play out, and am curious if the altruism of JFP will allow him to endorse a progressive Senator who has endorsed someone else.&nbsp; In the world of politics alone, usually it&#039;s a &quot;I&#039;ll do you if you do me&quot;.&nbsp; We know where Gianaris stands, so it will be curious, if JFP would endorse him for who he is and his record, or not because no endorsement back.&nbsp; Similarly, that will go for Carolyn Maloney.&nbsp; <br /><br />Maloney&#039;s opponent appears to be being run by the bankers--a lot of wall street money, and IMHO because of the Credit Card restriction act that she authored and got passed--which I&#039;m extremely grateful to her because it directly effected me.&nbsp; I am curious who JFP will endorse since, Carolyn too has endorsed Aravella.&nbsp; Carolyn--a US Congresswman who I think has done a very good job representing me--not just a member of the political machine.&nbsp; <br /><br />When it comes to petitioning, it is most likely the case that Maloney, Gianaris, and Simotas will be on the same petition...will JFP partner with Rushma, or will he be on the petition by himself?<br /><br />I do not know the answers, but these are questions I feel should be asked.<br /><br />To try and show some side of unbiased response - I am not fully sure that JFP&#039;s move into the district was conscious or not.&nbsp; I do know he got married to a wonderful woman and actress, and as a result moved from one home that I believe was in Markey&#039;s district, to what I believe is a home in Gianaris&#039; district.&nbsp; With the odd interweaving of the district, I cannot say it is more than coincidental.&nbsp; I AM curious to know that if he had remained in Markey&#039;s district if he would have primaried her, especially since she DID NOT vote the right way on marriage equality.&nbsp; Personally, I wish he would have stayed in her district and done just that, even though again he would be running against the alleged and so-called party machine.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am curious if he has answers to some of the other questions Sting is asking.&nbsp; His voting record is important as an elected official because it shows how engaged one is in the process, as well as, if they are vocal about a person like Obama, if they backed it with a vote.&nbsp; I am not sure, but I would guess that anyone who chooses to run for a public office agrees to disclose their voting record, though it is pure speculation.&nbsp; I know that in phonebanking, if one voted in an election, your name appears on the list of dems who voted.&nbsp; Additionally, I&#039;ve heard people mention prime voters--those who&#039;ve voted often and in primaries... so perhaps all the records are public to some extent.<br /><br />I can&#039;t speak against JFP on this, he&#039;s a good guy and a friend, as is his wife Karla.&nbsp; And I join Dirk and them at Trinity.&nbsp; I have no personal beef with him at all, and any concerns regarding this run I&#039;ve had, I&#039;ve openly expressed to him.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am an advocate of speaking pro-somoene vs. against someone.&nbsp; I am supporting Aravella because of her work with civic organizations like UACC, and for her work on CB1.&nbsp; I&#039;ve already said that I respect the electeds that came out in the LGBT community, none of which are party-machine folks.&nbsp; They have integrity, and I weighing heaviest are Dromm and Van Bramer who I highly respect, and have seen stand against the County machine.&nbsp; I do not think they would endorse blindly or because they were told to just do that.&nbsp; That&#039;s not my experience with them.&nbsp; <br /><br />Well, anyway, I&#039;ll be off to Minneapolis now.&nbsp; Back on Saturday-- I hope no one verbally kills anyone whilst I&#039;m gone.

				Here is a story in todays Astoria Times.<br /><br /><br />Simotas leads money race by 4-to-1 margin<br /><br /><br />By Nathan Duke<br />Thursday, April 22, 2010 11:13 AM EDT<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Jeremiah Frei-Pearson (l.) and Aravella Simotas are both running for state Assemblyman Michael Gianaris&#039; seat this fall. <br />Two young Democrats who work as Manhattan attorneys will face off this fall in the race to replace Michael Gianaris (D-Astoria) as the state assembly member for Astoria.<br /><br />Aravella Simotas, a Manhattan litigator and Community Board 1 member, has already been endorsed by a number of Queens elected officials, such as U.S. Reps. Carolyn Maloney (D-Astoria) and Joseph Crowley (D-Jackson Heights), Gianaris, former City Council Speaker Peter Vallone Sr., Council Speaker Christine Quinn (D-Manhattan) and Councilmen Peter Vallone Jr. (D-Astoria), Daniel Dromm (D-Jackson Heights) and Jimmy Van Bramer (D-Sunnyside).<br /><br />Jeremiah Frei-Pearson, who works as a civil and children’s rights attorney in Manhattan, is active in a number of civic groups, such as Western Queens Power for the People, Democracy for New York City, Coalition for a Better Astoria and the Long Island City Alliance.<br /><br />Simotas has raised $49,490, according to state campaign finance records, while Frei-Pearson currently has $11,380.<br /><br />Gianaris has raised nearly $100,000 in his bid for state Sen. George Onorato’s (D-Astoria) seat after the senator announced earlier this year that he would retire. He currently faces no opponents.<br /><br />Simotas kicked off her campaign April 10 at Astoria’s Taminent Club, drawing several hundred people of varying ages.<br /><br />“It’s great that the younger generation is getting involved in politics and government,” Simotas said. “A new generation of leadership is coming through in Astoria.”<br /><br />Frei-Pearson said he would make his campaign official during a concert at Astoria’s Athens Square Park at 6 p.m. April 26.<br /><br />“Albany is very dysfunctional,” he said. “My opponent is picked by Albany leaders, but she’s not going to fundamentally change the system.”<br /><br />Simotas said she would focus on funding and improvements for public schools, environmental issues and expanding hospital space and health clinics in western Queens. Frei-Pearson said term limits and campaign finance reform were key issues as well as health care access, school overcrowding and the economy.<br /><br />Mike Murphy, campaign spokesman for Simotas, criticized Frei-Pearson for his role in Western Queens Power for the People, which sued Con Edison for the 10-day blackout in July 2006. Frei-Pearson was one of two attorneys who worked with the group.<br /><br />Power for the People reached a $7.9 million settlement in 2008 with the utility for planting trees and other green initiatives in western Queens. But some community leaders, including Gianaris, said the group should not have settled on the community’s behalf.<br /><br />“The people of Astoria know they can trust Aravella Simotas,” Murphy said. “She’s a lifelong resident who understands the needs of the community and will fight for expanded access for health care and better schools. That’s why she’s endorsed by all the leaders we can trust. He’s already betrayed our community by selling them out to Con Edison after we suffered through the blackout.”<br /><br />Frei-Pearson downplayed a recent message posted by Astoria district leader Costa Constantinides, with whom he runs Astoria’s Democracy for New York City meetings, on the community Web site astorians.com.<br /><br />In the message, Constantinides said he believed Frei-Pearson had not promoted a DFNYC forum “accurately” by mentioning that his opponent would attend. Constantinides wrote he was frustrated his name was attached to an e-mail promoting the event and that Frei-Pearson knew Simotas would not be in attendance.<br /><br />“I think there are important issues facing the community, so this is political nonsense,” said Frei-Pearson.<br /><br />Constantinides did not want to comment on the matter, but both he and Frei-Pearson said they have worked together through DFNYC for years. However, Constantinides has thrown his support behind Simotas.<br /><br />

				I see the negative comments from Sting55 line up with those of Aravella&#039;s spokesman. I think it&#039;s no surprise that the Simotas campaign has already gone negative and attacked Jeremiah and everyone else who marched and worked with Western Queens Power for the People. It&#039;s just Albany politics as usual from a negative politician. Simotas&#039; spokesman smeared Jeremiah and all the good people who worked hard for Astoria because Simotas has virtually no public record of her own. Where was Aravella Simotas when the battle was fought to bring justice to the victims of the 2006 Blackout? All Astoria got from her was silence. Now that she&#039;s running for office, suddenly she has an opinion? She&#039;ll have to do a lot better than showing up late with nothing but attacks to win over the voters of our communities.

				agreed mcdirk.<br /><br />I am interested in getting info on this whole Con Edison situation and this group Western Queens Power Brokers.<br /><br />From what I can see, they somehow became the &quot;chosen&quot; local group (who excatly chose them I cant find out), that are the local front for a group named NorthStar, which is a big not-for-profit conglomerate taht recieved the grant from Con Edison and the Pulbic Service Commission (PSC). The PSC is the govt agency that always gives Con Edison those insane rate hikes. Being in bed with those guys is pretty much like being bed the worst of the worst.<br /><br />Iam interested in what the candidates and bloggers think about all this. Im looking at the websites now and all info is helpful.

				or better yet, invite Jeremiah to speak at the Powhattan Club, then we cant attend cause of a conflict, make believe you never heard from him, call it a debate, and then attack him for not showing up.<br /><br />oh, wait, someone already did that.<br /><br />im guessing here, ddanny999, but there has been some bad faith shown on some of the candidates part already with this forum stuff.<br /><br />but, its a good suggestion. im sure other groups will have debates. looking forward to it.

				I don&#039;t have a pony in the race, so to speak.&nbsp; Aravella Simotas and Jeremiah Frei-Pearson are candidates for office and I have not yet heard anything meaningful from either of them.<br /><br />My concern with Ms. Simotas is that she was chosen by the local democratic machine.&nbsp; My concern with Mr. Frei-Pearson is that he seems aloof and used very poor judgment in writing a letter of support as if co-signed by Mr. Constantinides.<br /><br />I think that for voters to be able to make the most informed choice, there needs to be open venues that both candidates can speak and debate.&nbsp; As voters, we need to be able to ask questions and better understand the issues.

				I think it&#039;s no surprise that the Simotas campaign has already gone negative and attacked Jeremiah and everyone else who marched and worked with Western Queens Power for the People.<br /><br />and btw mjmurphy:<br /><br />no one has &quot;attacked everyone else who marched.&quot;<br /><br />Thats a silly attempt to drag in a whole bunch of people into the debate over Jeremiahs candidacy. The people on this blog and the progressives in this community are a lot smarter than that stuff. I get a that a certain young man may be advising Jeremiah that this bag of dirty tricks stuff is good for him. Its not.<br /><br />That reaks of the whole Costas email thing. Some kinda weird mind game. Just make your point man, no need to try and trick folks. On the merits.

				I&#039;d love to see what documentation there is of Aravella speaking poorly.&nbsp; The only stuff I&#039;ve seen are unsubstantiated rumors by JFP&#039;s campaign about some blogger being verbally attacked by some unknown person.<br /><br />With regards to both sides, I think documentation would be helpful, more so than hearsay and speculation.&nbsp; Right now the only documentation we have is the email that JFP sent out with Costa&#039;s name attached, and a posting on the board by Costa saying that it was inappropriate and done without his consent and that the event was advertised in a misleading way.&nbsp; An actual statement by a person related to the situation at hand is a documentation.<br /><br />I say the proof of any allegation is in documentation.&nbsp; Otherwise it is rubbish IMHO.&nbsp; Sting says he has documentation regarding voting records, which I think would be interesting to see here.&nbsp; <br /><br />If JFP&#039;s camp has documentation of Aravella, let&#039;s see it here.<br /><br />My experience of Aravella is not one of malicious attacking.&nbsp; Unfortunately the emails I get from JFP&#039;s campaign tend to suggest otherwise, with no proof.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am not a fan of victimizing oneself to garner support.&nbsp; It is almost as repulsive as tearing down the other person for support.&nbsp; You want my support, tell me why to support you.&nbsp; Aravella&#039;s campaign sends me information doing just that, and not ever mentioning JFP or suggesting anything bad about him.&nbsp; That speaks to me.

				I have not gotten there to Astoria yet, but I ALREADY know where Jeremiah Frei-Pearson stands on the issues, and he is not the typical politician courting the LGBT vote just to get elected.&nbsp; There will be a rally on Saturday where he will officially announce his candidacy.&nbsp; I can&#039;t be there because of other commitments, but check out his website, go out and hear him, and trust me, speak to him and ask him questions.&nbsp; He is VERY approachable!&nbsp; THEN make your decision about supporting him or others.<br /><br />Peace<br />Pastor Paul B Milholland<br />Trinity Lutheran of LIC

				I find it funny that Jeremiah seems to rail against his opponent for having insider supporter but I have it on pretty good authority that he went and asked all these same politicians for their support...I heard just last week he went in and talked to Vallone.

				The Con Edison deal is a real issue. BTW, calling it a lawsuit is kinda not correct. <br /><br />Read this excerpt from the Public Service Commisions own press release: http://www3.dps.state.ny.us/pscweb/WebFileRoom.nsf/Web/C0CAEF47EA0A107C852574880067659B/$File/pr08080.pdf?OpenElement<br /><br />Disallowance of Repair Costs<br /><br />The settlement contains two basic monetary provisions which were offered by Con<br />Edison in exchange for the termination of the prudence investigation instituted by the<br />Commission in April 2007. The first is the disallowance of $40 million of plant costs and $6<br />million of accrued carrying charges incurred by Con Edison to replace and repair electricity<br />delivery facilities in the Long Island City network associated with the July 2006 power outages.<br />The second is Con Edison’s provision of $17 million in community-benefit funds dedicated to<br />the community directly affected by the 2006 Queens power outage.<br /><br />So, the &quot;settlement&quot; was actually proposed by Con Edison. Read it clearly, there was no &quot;lawsuit&quot; that brought Con Edison to their knees. This is the NYS Public Service Commissions own press release. This &quot;deal&quot; was proposed by Con Edison.<br /><br />And it was done, and pay close attention here, &quot; in exchange for the termination of the prudence investigation instituted by the Commission in April 2007.&quot;<br /><br />So, Con Edison proposed giving everyone $100 in credits on their bill (zero cash) and giving a not-for-profit 17M to plant trees.<br /><br />We, the citizens, agreed to &quot;terminate&quot; an &quot;investigation&quot; as to why the blackout actually occured and forgoe any penalties.<br /><br />And, some very in-experienced press hungry activists formed a brand new group, Western Queens Power Brokers, and signed on to this horrible crime. <br /><br />And now, Jeremiah is running with this &quot;lawsuit&quot; (which it was not) as one of his main platforms. <br /><br />So, lets talk on the merits here about maybe the most single important thing to hit this community in a whole bunch of years.

				and read this from Jeremiahs Wikepedia page:<br /><br />Jeremiah Frei-Pearson is a child advocate and civil rights attorney living in Astoria, Queens, New York. In 2009 and 2010, activists encouraged him to run for state Senate in the Democratic primary against incumbent George Onorato. [1] [2] [3] [www.tinyurl.com/runJFPrun] Frei-Pearson is very active in Western Queens. As a pro bono lawyer for Western Queens Power for the People, he helped get a $63 million dollar settlement from ConEdison for the people of Queens after the 2006 blackout. [<br /><br />And this number of $63,000,000 settlement is all over. Just google Jeremiah and Con Edison. But you know its close, $17,000,000 to a <br />not-for-profit for trees and $63,000,000 is only about a $46,000,000 discrepancy.<br /><br />$46,000,000. Amazing. why not admit Con Ed gave us a bunch of trees.<br /><br />But no, add $46,000,000 and call it a $63,000,000 settlement.<br /><br />

				Not sure how this balances out.....but PFP was listed as a signatory of the deal approved by the Public Services Commission. Which to me, says they were involved in negotiations. <br /><br />Relevant portion was at the end of the document.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Signatories to settlement include: Con Edison, Staff of the Department of Public Service, the New York State Consumer Protection Board, the Western Queens Power for the People, New York Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, The City of New York, and the Public Utility Law Project. The Utility Workers Union of America Local 1-2 stated that it does not oppose approval of the settlement agreement and a Korean community development organization filed correspondence expressing its support for the settlement.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What I am curious about is how they became the spokespeople of Western Queens. Can anyone shed any light on this? <br /><br />If I understand correctly, Assemblyman Gianaris among others feels that PFP gave too much away. I have a feeling that has to do with the $100 credit. I remember my partner saying.....Whee.....a whole one hundred dollars.<br /><br />The 46 million the previous poster refers to is the least controversial to me. That&#039;s the amount the shareholders had to take a hit on instead of it being passed on as a rate hike. <br /><br />And I&#039;m glad to learn the lawyers at PFP did the work pro bono. If they made money off the deal, I would have declared them ambulance chasers and voted elsewhere. I&#039;m done with the John Edwards of the world.<br /><br /><br />

				&quot;Mangopango:<br /><br />This is what you said about me:<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;i have repeatedly seen you post things with no backing, no documentation, etc.&quot;<br /><br />So I guess, since you were at Jeremiahs event, you asked him or Murphy if Jeremiah had in fact voted in last years Presidential primary or the Bush general election ? Cause you would have been able to get all of us an independant answer from the horses mouth so to speak, since Murphy simply attacks me every time I raise the issue.<br /><br />Did you ?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />And no, I didnt go to the event, cause I think it would be kind of a lie for me to go to the guys event if I dont support him right now. im happy to see his event went well. I started being open minded about his campaign, but his spokesperson, Mr. Murphy, doesnt answer my simple factual questions that are based on government transparency. Its hard for me to get past this issue, the Costa forgery which I have never heard a responce to, or the whole Con Edison fiasco. Not one response. Its kinda weird and unprecedented. And yes, I have emailed Jeremiah five times and never recieved a responce from him either. Is there a phone number I could call ?

I&#039;ve been totally honest about who I&#039;m supporting. I came to this board to say why I support Jeremiah and point out the agenda of some of the commenters. I have largely refrained from making negative comments about Aravella--the sole exception being in response to her spokesman&#039;s attack on Jeremiah&#039;s hard work for our community. Now here we see an anonymous smear campaign against Jeremiah. I wonder who&#039;s behind it.

			<dd class="postbody">
				I do not agree with the personal attacks on either side, or at individuals specifically.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am curious why JFP&#039;s camp (which I know you&#039;re part of MJM since I know you personally), has not responded to stings accusations.&nbsp; I do not feel it is my place to inflame the situation, but I am curious why there has been no clarification.&nbsp; If the accusations are truly without merit, they should be easily defended against.&nbsp; <br /><br />So rather than this being about JFP or AS, this has turned more into a supporter-vs-supporter attack session that is not helpful.<br /><br />1. It is fact that JFP sent an email inviting folks to a debate between him and AS and &quot;signed&quot; Costa&#039;s name in the email.&nbsp; Costa has posted on the board a rather direct comment addressing this, confirming that it was done, and saying that the premise of &quot;debate&quot; was incorrect and that JFP knew that AS would not be able to attend well in advance, despite the letter leading folks on to the contrary.&nbsp; As of date, no response has been posted explaining this from JFP or a rep.<br /><br />2. Sting alleges that JFP has moved into the district 5 or 6 months ago with the sole intent to run for the Assembly.&nbsp; I am not sure how one could prove or disprove intention, but I think if JFP DID move into the district he should own up to it.&nbsp; It is my understanding, as a friend of his, that he had moved in that time period, related to his wedding.&nbsp; I cannot confirm or deny any special intent on why he moved to where he did within Astoria.&nbsp; I can confirm that our Assembly district lines are very oddly shaped, that I recently moved, and that it took me some time to figure out which Assembly District I live in.&nbsp; Some clarification from JFP would be helpful.<br /><br />3. Sting alleges that JFP did not vote in some important elections and primaries.&nbsp; JFP has not refuted this on the board.&nbsp; Those who speak against sting&#039;s allegations focus more on why the voting record is public.&nbsp; I would be curious why he did not vote in the presidential primary, especially with his public statements of support for Obama.&nbsp; <br /><br />4. I have raised concern that JFP sent an email blast about &quot;lulu&quot;s claiming that none of the folks in Albany deserved them, despite the good work that our Assembly did, especially Mike Gianaris (emphasis is mine).&nbsp; He said in his blast that none of them deserved a bonus.&nbsp; I have to disagree, as I think Mike Gianaris has done an excellent job as an Assemblyman, bringing Astoria from Onorato-style politics to a mainline democratic politics--at a time when it was not yet popular in this constituency.&nbsp; He voted the right way on many issues in the past, but most notably he voted FOR marriage equality both times it came up last year.&nbsp; He DID a good job, does a good job, and I believe will do an even better job as our Senator.&nbsp; Blanket statements like JFP made in his blast are concerning.&nbsp; &nbsp;I know that several folks on JFP&#039;s camp have expressed that they intend to support Gianaris personally and JFP personally.&nbsp; I am curious if JFP is going to do the same by endorsing Gianaris even though he knows the endorsement is not returned.&nbsp; My challenge is that the endorsement is altruistic and not a political ploy...will he endorse our presumed democratic Senatorial candidate before the primary?&nbsp; Similarly, will he endorse Maloney who has also endorsed AS?&nbsp; I am a big fan of Gianaris and Maloney (in addition to Simotas), and it is of interest that any Assembly candidate saying they&#039;re doing this out of good-will support those who have done great things for us already.<br /><br />5. I am curious about petitioning.&nbsp; It is very likely that ballot petitions will be including Maloney, Gianaris, and Simotas on one petition.&nbsp; Will JFP be petitioning with opponents to Maloney and Gianaris?&nbsp; Or will he have a petition that is only his, aware that anyone who signs the M/G/S petition would not be able to sign his and vice versa?&nbsp; <br /><br />6. Maloney took a major stand against the Credit Card businesses.&nbsp; She helped pass one of the most important Acts protecting citizens from exploitation by the same.&nbsp; As a result she has a Wall St. well-financed opponent challenging her.&nbsp; What is JFP&#039;s opinion on this and will he stand by Maloney?<br /><br />7. Sting has raised allegations regarding the ConEd settlement, offering documentation that JFP&#039;s website refers to it in a different manner than the official press release.&nbsp; Though it is often semantics, several folks who were on the fence on this issue also admitted to this.&nbsp; I&#039;ve still not seen any explanation refuting the allegations of Sting other than attacks on his tone and presentation.&nbsp; I was not part of either side on this issue, though I do see the merit in questioning the settlement, as $100 electric credit does seem like a hollow gesture, and I think there are more important issues facing Astoria than trees, especially if we may still have remaining problems that could cause another black-out.&nbsp; Similarly related, a newspaper asked AS her opinion on the settlement, and she spoke positively of it but mentioned that Mt. Sinai could use some of that money to become a better facility in the area.&nbsp; I received an email from JFPs camp accusing her of hijacking &quot;his win&quot;.&nbsp; I rolled my eyes, as it appeared they were clearly reading into the situation--and it made them appear like they were trying to be victims.&nbsp; (That was early on in the campaign, and probably what initially led me to be a Simotas supporter, as I do not like feigned sensationalized victimization).<br /><br />8. Several folks including the JFP camp mention &quot;political insider&quot; clearly referencing that politicians have already endorsed Simotas.&nbsp; I offered defense of these politicians, especially Dromm and Van Bramer.&nbsp; I have also spoken highly of Maloney, Gianaris, and Quinn for the work they have done, and the respect they deserve for it.&nbsp; I have said I thin it is unfair and a misnomer to consider Aravella a political insider because of support by these progressive politicians.&nbsp; The real question is if her politics conform to the progressive democratic party&#039;s platform.&nbsp; And they do.&nbsp; If JFPs do also, then a new argument should be made by him.&nbsp; <br /><br />9.&nbsp; I am ashamed that anyone would compare the discussions on this board with Karl Rove tactics.&nbsp; That again smells of victimization talk rather than rational discussion.&nbsp; It makes mountains out of mole-hills.&nbsp; Additionally, one should really be thinking, that after one of the two wins the primary, they still have to win the election, and a divided democratic base would hurt either candidate.&nbsp; Additionally, in the long run, we have to be a community afterwards.&nbsp; Accusing anyone of of Karl Rove tactics seems a bit out of line.&nbsp; It is like comparing someone to Hitler when they may have done a few rotten things in their life.&nbsp; Hyperbole, and exaggeration.&nbsp; It does not bring sympathy to a side, and is said to be inflammatory.&nbsp; NEITHER SIDE has engaged thus far in tactics that warrant being called Karl Rove-esque.<br /><br />Now that I&#039;ve spent 25 minutes ranting, can we actually discuss the issues at hand? I&#039;d love some answers to some of the questions posed to JFP&#039;s side.&nbsp; I also want to be clear, that though I am a supporter of Simotas, I am not connected to her campaign.&nbsp; And I speak without any prompting by them.&nbsp; I believe what I believe because of what I&#039;ve observed, in this race, observed in my friendships with both AS and JFP, and how I&#039;ve sen both perform in civic and marriage equality-related associations.&nbsp; All things tallied up, I&#039;m supporting Simotas.

				So too early for news from either it seems. I welcome announcements of campaign events. And welcome any questions the campaigns have answered.<br />I see many shared questions. What are the answers from Aravella? from JFP?<br />Hopefully there would be more to follow when the campaigns are rolling.<br /><br />Do you think either campaigns might petition simply on their own behalf? Need either depend on insider effort. It appears that a party candidate may only need 500 valid signatures.An independent would need as much as 1500. There are thousands of Dem voters, and thousands who are not.

During law school, Ms. Simotas served as the managing editor of the Fordham Environmental Law Journal. She also worked as a district representative to the former Speaker of the New York City Council. An active community member, she has served on the Queens Community Board 1 since her May 2002 appointment by the Borough President. <br /><br /><br />Before joining Bickel &amp; Brewer, Ms. Simotas clerked for Senior Judge Nicholas Tsoucalas and Judge Timothy C.

I dont know if there is yet an announced Dem candidate for governor.<br />A budget is still overdue.

				This is the positive, reform open government statement by Jeremiahs spokesperson in responce to my very simple questions:<br /><br />&quot;You&#039;re here to manufacture questions and raise spurious accusations as part of a Karl Rove style smear campaign. And then you whine that I&#039;m &quot;attacking&quot; you when I point out that you are, in fact, here for no other purpose than to attack one of the candidates. For all we know, you&#039;re a plant from Jeremiah&#039;s opponent.&quot;<br /><br />I mean, I dont know Mr. Murphy, but he sounds a bit unhinged.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Just two quick things. <br /><br />1. If I was either Candidate, I&#039;m not sure I would jump into this thread at all.<br /><br />2. If you are appointed to a community board, you are an insider. You are a part of the system that the average citizen has no connection with. You have the connections etc that get you an automatic endorsement. Because they know you.&nbsp; That is why an outsider doesn&#039;t have as much of a chance of drumming up endorsements as someone that is known to the powers that be.

				or maybe &quot;the powers that be&quot; wouldnt endorse someone who they dont know. cause why would they do that ? its hard to make the argument as to why jeremiah deserves the &quot;powers that be&quot; support. he hasnt really demonstrated a lot. he just hasnt been around very long in this community. that doesnt mean he shouldnt run. he has that right. <br /><br />and he has the right to ask for support. he certainly asked for it from those same elected officals he and his campaign now attack. in fact begged for it from what i have heard. and numerous people on this site have and can confirm that. Mr. Murphy trashes those same people that Jeremiah asked to endorse him. <br /><br />okay, so he has been active in the marriage equality issue for the last year or so, but the gay leaders of this area and nyc oppose jeremiah in this race. so, he has to trash them now as hacks and corrupt politicians ? danny dromm is corrupt ? really ? says who, Mr. Murphy ? what exactly has he done for this community ?&nbsp; <br /><br />its the same old thing again and again and again: Credibility.

				I&#039;ve been thinking about this off and on and I want to address this more clearly now. <br /><br />First of all, I want to say this is not an attack on Simotas. This is more of the way I look at it.<br /><br />We&#039;ve had politicians come out and say that they support Gay Rights and then have been disappointed. A perfect example is Bill Clinton. From him, we got DADT and DOMA. From Obama, we are getting bits and pieces of Executive Orders.....but nothing of the &quot;fierce Advocate&quot; he promised us. Hell, today we got a letter from Sec Gates asking for Congress to hold off on DADT until his review is over. <br /><br />I can&#039;t help but take with a grain of salt when politicians say they support &quot;Equal Rights for all&quot;. Senator Addabbo said he was for equal rights for all and then voted against the Marriage Equality bill in the NY Senate. And he was someone who received large gay donations because they thought he was on our side. And it should be realized that his no vote is thought by many to have lead to the defeat of the bill. <br /><br />When I think of a fierce advocate for gay rights.....I don&#039;t think of President Obama.....I think of Jeremiah. He has actually been in the thick of lobbying Sen Onorato. There are other things that give me pause and I want to explore more.....but when it comes to gay rights.....I know who I am comfortable with. <br /><br />This is not a singular issue for me when I go into the voting booth. It is an important piece for me though.

				and it doesnt give you pause that the guy who had dedicated his life to the cause etc doesnt bother to actually vote ?<br /><br />and the Costas thing. its of course a small thing, but look at what it represents. the guy starts his campaign with this trickery. claiming simotas blew off this big event, when he knew she was never going. using his friend costas. why would he do that ?<br /><br />which makes me think, what else is trickery ? he takes part in this onorato thing then starts having people &quot;draft&quot; him for the onorato seat. all over youtube. go to youtube. he recruted like two or three vocal folks who are gay and got them to do this whole thing. its actually kinda sad the way he used those people. video after video. draft jeremiah. draft jeremiah. then when onorato doesnt actually run, he doesnt run for that seat. its a vacant seat seat and he doesnt run for it. why ? because he has actually moved to run for another seat. <br /><br />cause btw ask yourself this question. has jeremiah frei pearson ever done a single thing for the gay community BEFORE onorato and marriage equality vote. was he a member of any of the gay democratic clubs. did he work to get any openly gay candidates elected. did he do anything in the gay community or for gay people ?<br /><br />the answer is no. he got involved, with the rallys and the youtube videos, only when he saw it as an opportunity to run for office and build a platform as the pro-gay progressive candidate. he thinks he is the next jimmy van bramer or danny dromm. his involvement with onorato was all motivated by his preparations for a run for office.<br /><br />that should give you as lot of pause.

				Its funny how every time I ask a question, or make a statement i believe to be true, I get attacked. But no one ever responds to the substance of my question.<br /><br />Since you all know this gentleman so well, than I guess you could tell me what Jeremiah has done for the gay community before inserting himself in the Onorato situation.<br /><br />Every act of his was followed by a YouTube video of his speeches and his rallys. There are folks that have dedicated a long time to issues the community cares about. I have just never heard of Jeremiah before he showed up at the Onorato rallys.<br /><br />and thats not disqualifying, but if the person has used this issue to his political advantage, then he should be called on it. and that in itself is not disqualifying either. thats what politicans do. and the way to refute that is to go to his record. and i just dont see any. so lets not make him out to be some saint. <br /><br />And BTW, there were rallys being held before he showed up. We just started seeing him all over YouTube once he realized the gay community was getting active on the issue. And it fit his political goals.<br /><br />Sorry if you dont like to hear the truth as I see it. <br /><br />I started out a sceptic and now am almost convinced that we are dealing with a 3 dollar bill here.<br /><br />PS Magopango: thanks for advocating for kids. nyc&nbsp; teachers are the best ! <br />

				One of the reasons I am interested in finding out more about Jeremiah is that I dont know anybody who knows him. And while he has inspired support amongst activists who were involved with him in the marriage equality rally, I get a sense he is an enigma. So, on Jeremiahs website, this is what he has to say about himself:<br /><br />&quot;Jeremiah grew up in Baltimore, Maryland, until his family moved to New York State when he was 16.&nbsp; He attended private schools in Baltimore, but lived on the city&#039;s troubled east side—an area wracked by crime, where he saw too many friends end up in jail or dead. The difference between the opportunities available to the kids from his neighborhood and the kids he met in private school has driven him ever since. During Jeremiah&#039;s high school years, his family lived in five different towns or boroughs in New York, and he attended New York&#039;s public schools.&nbsp; Jeremiah graduated from John Jay High School in Cross River, New York&quot;<br /><br />I have been having a hard time buying the rough streets of Baltimore story. But he does say that he graduated High School from John Jay in Cross River. And this is what Wikepedia has to say about Cross River, New York :<br /><br />As of the census of 2000, there were 12,324 people, 4,218 households, and 3,425 families residing in the town. The racial makeup of the town was 95.18% White, 1.19% African American, 0.06% Native American, 2.09% Asian, 0.49% from other races, and 0.99% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.48% of the population.<br /><br />The median income for a household in the town was $112,462, and the median income for a family was $129,473. <br /><br />So he came out of the tough streets of Baltimore where &quot;he saw too many friends end up in jail or dead&quot;, but moved to a&nbsp; &nbsp;neighborhood that was 95.18 % White and the median income was $130,000 ? <br /><br />Oh, and just so we are all clear, this is from the 2000 census. Its 10 years later. So whats the median income of Cross River and Lewisboro (the town he is from) now ? $150,000 ? $200,000 ? You think it got any whiter than 95.18 percent ?<br /><br />I mean its a pretty simple question. How did he go from a place that his friends were being killed to a neighborhood that is 95 percent white and the median income is over $130,000 a year ? Ten years ago, in the year 2000 ?<br /><br />And before I get attacked, this is his bio. He posted it. Not me.<br /><br />And I will tell you why its relevant. Cause if he never lived in the &quot;poor&quot; side of Baltimore, and he never &quot;saw his friends end up in jail or dead&quot; , then ladies and gentlemen, we have a real 3 dollar bill on our hands.<br /><br />And I wonder if our teacher from the WFP would be as enamored of a guy who would make up something like that. I mean, I cant imagine something worse than making believe you are poor if you are in fact born to wealth. Or saying you lived in Brownsville if you grew up on Park Avenue.<br /><br />And in this day and age, it aint going to be too hard to figure out where this gentleman lived in Baltimore.

				I am sorry. Allow me to correct myself. He says the lack of opportunities for the &quot;kids from his neighborhood has driven him ever since.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />So his entire lifes work eminates from this one thing. We certainly should take a look at that.

				Cmon already defending this guy.<br /><br />The neighborhood he went to high school is in Westchester and is one of the most exclusive neighborhoods in the United State of America.<br /><br />Do you think his dad was a truck driver, they lived on the east side of Baltimore, then he got a raise and they moved to a neighborhood at the level of Scarsdale ?<br /><br />He says that he moved there from a neighborhood where his friends were getting killed or going to jail. And btw, as he is prone to when he fibs, he also put out some truth. He says he went to private schools. That what made me look into this and which triggers my questions.<br /><br />I believe its another fabrication, and this is the relevance:<br /><br />If he is the big DFNY guy, but didnt vote in the Bush/Kerry election and<br /><br />If he is the big supporter of Obama, but didnt vote in the Presidential primary and<br /><br />If he is the big agent of change, but puts out a false email misrepresenting the views of his close friend and<br /><br />If he the big progressive who emerged with a mission from the slums of Baltimore, but is actually a rich kid then<br /><br />Guess what. His involvement in the marriage equality movement was a scam to position himself to run for office. <br /><br />Its a Broadway show dude. Its all made up.<br /><br />

				As I do on my lunch breaks, I read up on national and local news while I eat.&nbsp; Found this from two weeks ago that I missed:<br /><br />http://www.queenstribune.com/not4pub/Not4pub_042210.html (http://www.queenstribune.com/not4pub/Not4pub_042210.html)<br /><br /><em>District 36<br /><br />Aravella Simotas and Jeremiah Frei-Pearson, two bright, young, impressive candidates, are squaring off to replace Mike Gianaris in the Assembly – Gianaris will take George Onorato’s Senate seat with little or no opposition. Aravella, the insider in this race, with the endorsement of the present Assemblymember, appears to be using his influence to insure her election. She has all but been guaranteed the support of the Democratic Organization in the Primary. <br /><br />But don’t count Jeremiah Frei-Pearson out. As a lawyer, Jeremiah has spent his career fighting to give voice to foster children and others who have been shut out and shoved aside by our political system.&nbsp; He strongly believes that New York state government must work because our children need better schools, we all need quality healthcare, and we need a government that can tackle the serious economic problems we are facing. He is committed to working toward that end.<br /><br />While Aravella places her priority as bringing home the bacon for the District, Jeremiah recognizes that Albany does not serve the people of his District or the State and places his priority at fixing the dysfunction in the State legislature. <br /><br />It could be a classic battle of inside vs. outside. And while Aravella’s path of lining up the party’s support and promising to focus on fighting for the District’s share in Albany has been the typical path of victory in the Dem Primary, have the people reached their limit of Albany abuse and will they embrace Jeremiah’s vow to devote himself to changing Albany?<br /><br />We’ll be watching. </em>

				Michael Gianaris has no primary challenger. He has been free to devote a lot of time and energy to Simotas&#039; campaign. It is my personal opinion that Simotas would not have as much success locking up endorsements from the Party infrastructure without her friend Gianaris&#039; ubiquitous and relentless advocacy on her behalf. That said, Unions are a vital part of securing a fair deal for the hardworking people of Queens and their endorsements are something to be proud of.

				On one hand, I wonder how many may vote simply on who has nicer hair. Your call.<br />It would be great if the issues surrouding the blackout were addressed by Jeremiah and Aravella.<br /><br />Unless it is explained where Aravella was, what were her actions, then I think most would end up siding with Jeremiah. ConEd might have passed on $ millions more of charges to users.&nbsp; Those were terribly black days for Astoria, and by extension the leadership of NY. However, I think Gianaris should campaign on these issues for Senate and should lobby the next Governor.<br /><br /><br />I see reminders of loss from the blackout sometimes in the neighborhood. Still frustrated with the lack of leadership from Bloomberg then.<br /><br />If you were not here, you were spared.

				Everything that transpired in the ConEd situation is a matter of public record.<br /><br />Jeremiah and Western Queens Power for the People took ConEdison to court through a &quot;prudence&quot; proceeding via the public service commission. The settlement is publicly available at http://www.powerforthepeople.info/63millionproposal.html <br /><br />It was signed by a variety of parties, including the Staff of the Department of Public Service, the New York State Consumer Protection Board, Western Queens Power for the People, New York Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, The City of New York, and the Public Utility Law Project.<br /><br />The settlement did not prevent people from pursuing additional damages against ConEdison. What it did do was ensure that: <br /><br />(1) ConEd apologized in writing (something they had refused to do at all, initially)<br />(2) Require ConEd to make restitution to everyone who lost money<br />(3) Ensure that the extent of the damages were documented<br />(4) Prevent ConEd from passing the cost on to rate payers<br />(5) Bring home money for greening projects to address the health concerns created by ConEd power plants in the area.<br /><br />As for the many folks who suffered more than $100 in losses, State Law limits the maximum that ConEdison can pay. They actually brought home significantly more than most thought we were entitled to under state law (see this NY Times article saying ConEd was only liable for 9.3 million http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/19/nyregion/19coned.html?_r=1). <br /><br />The law needs to be updated to allow for greater reimbursement.&nbsp; This hasn&#039;t happened because our broken government in Albany hasn&#039;t updated the reimbursement rates in over 30 years. In the Assembly, Jeremiah will fight to increase the reimbursement rate allowable.<br /><br />Jeremiah Frei-Pearson stood with his neighbors and together, they fought to get what they could out of ConEd. Aravella Simotas did nothing and now she has the nerve to criticize Jeremiah for not doing enough.

				I don&#039;t want to get in a back and forth with you because you obviously have your own agenda but I am curious about what this settlement involved and what sort of public outreach they did. If you don&#039;t know that is ok but please refrain from these attacks. I don&#039;t remember any hearings or anything. I am just curious how people can represent the community but they don&#039;t have an open process. If you look at all the documents the only thing this settlement seemed to accomplish was give 100 dollars to some people, give 10 million dollars to this power people group and stop a formal investigation by the Public Service Committee.

				I haven&#039;t got a horse in this race one way or the other. While I&#039;m grateful for Frei-Pearson&#039;s participation in the Marriage Equality movement, it always seemed somewhat of a political opportunist move rather than a sincere fight for the cause. It was (and is) a hot issue with Onorato as an easy target to go after, while gaining the support of Astoria&#039;s growing gay community and giving him the opportunity to get his name out there. As a member of that Astoria LGBT community, I always found myself somewhat suspicious of his motives, though I could very well be wrong.<br /><br />And for what it&#039;s worth, I work in the child welfare field and among my colleagues, no one has a clue who he is, nor do I recall seeing him presenting at any professional conferences. Granted, while he would in all likelihood not have a clue who I am either, I probably wouldn&#039;t try to make my professional achievements seem like more than they are if I were running for office. It&#039;s a fairly small legal field. I know other people who work for his organization, and hear the names and know the reputations of some of his colleagues, but I can honestly say his name has never come up. <br /><br />As for Simotas, I haven&#039;t a clue who she is, what she&#039;s done or what she stands for. I know she&#039;s gotten a number of endorsements, but that&#039;s about it. <br /><br />If the only information a voter gets is from the two sides presented on the Astorians board from the warring factions, then I suspect a lot of voters might just stay home. The nitpicky fighting really doesn&#039;t help and certainly doesn&#039;t provide anyone with the tools to make an informed decision on election day.<br /><br />Just my two cents.

				holyfrjole, I think both candidates have very informative websites:<br /><br />www.jfp2010.com<br /><br />www.aravellasimotas.com<br /><br />And keep in mind it&#039;s only May. The election is September 14. We&#039;ll be hearing a lot from both candidates in the next several months--I suspect there will be more than enough information available to make an informed decision on Election Day.<br /><br />As far as Jeremiah&#039;s work, I can point you to his &nbsp;page &nbsp;(http://www.childrensrights.org/about/staff-and-board-of-directors/staff/jeremiah-frei-pearson/) on the Children&#039;s Rights website.<br /><br />Also, as a gay man myself, I&#039;m moved by Jeremiah&#039;s sincerity and passion in the fight for LGBT equality. I think it&#039;s no surprise that his tireless advocacy on our behalf has led to so much enthusiasm for his candidacy in the LGBT community. It&#039;s also no surprise that people are skeptical about that. Here in New York, we&#039;ve had enough scandals to turn anyone into a cynic. But I can honestly say that I have no doubt in my mind that Jeremiah is a true friend and ally to our community. It&#039;s a rare individual that can reignite idealism in a State as beleaguered by corruption as New York. But I truly believe in Jeremiah&#039;s sincere devotion to the cause of equality as well as his devotion to a brighter future for all of us.

				this is my first post so go easy on me...I don&#039;t know much about the other candidate so I won&#039;t knock him. I just met Ms Aravella at Astoria Park and she was so nice and seemed very genuine. I talked to her about the schools and the after school programs (my sons program was just cut) and she was so passionate about it, she had some great ideas about how to fix the damn mess. <br /><br />I think it is great that young people want to get involved and want to give back. Plus I think it is great that we finally have a female candidate for something in Western Queens. How amazing is that!&nbsp;

Are you working for Jeremiah? I don&#039;t think you understand what endorsements are. Unions and groups like NARAL endorse people because of someones record of accomplishment. Not to take away from your candidate but I think to say someone like Simotas hasn&#039;t done anything is very unfortunate and not true.&nbsp; I have heard her speak and met her numerous times. Again I don&#039;t know much about your candidate but what i do know is he was involved in some bad deal with Con Edison and that when he was with Marriage Equality he turned into a group to promote one of his many thoughts about running for office

				Wow this is a long thread. I confess I haven&#039;t read every single post but I&#039;m wading in (with some trepidation--this seems like a very hot topic!)<br /><br />I don&#039;t really know either candidate. I remember hearing about Frei-Pearson helping organize a benefit for Haiti after the earthquake this year and of course, his work on the ConEd lawsuit. I&#039;d honestly never heard of Simotas until I saw this thread but having looked at her website, it seems like she&#039;s definitely taking the right positions on all the issues. What are her accomplishments though? I mean, mjmurphy is saying she&#039;s attacking Jeremiah&#039;s work on the ConEd thing when she wasn&#039;t even involved. Why wasn&#039;t she involved? What has she accomplished living here all this time?<br />

				Again I don&#039;t want to get in fight but I was a member of Marriage Equality and every meeting was about what people can do to help Jeremiah. That is why i stopped going. I don&#039;t know why you have to get so aggressive and negative. &nbsp;As for the Con Ed deal...the facts are the facts and I think it was a bad deal for the community. I have lived in Astoria my whole life and was deeply hurt by the blackout and to get a credit for 100 dollars after they raised my rates was insulting. &nbsp;I think a few other people on the board have pointed out that they weren&#039;t happy with the deal either...

				TRX, that&#039;s correct. I&#039;m not a paid staffer. I&#039;m a resident of this district, a registered Democrat, and I&#039;m supporting the candidate that I feel is the better choice for Astoria.

				Wow, this is a really toxic thread. At least mjmurphy is openly a volunteer with Frei-Pearson and has tried to answer some questions (as TRX recently quoted) and tried to explain why he supports Jeremiah. All the Simotas fans are doing is attack, attack, attack. stevecrawford is obviously here on a mission to defame Frei-Pearson. Maybe hellsgatetim will answer some of my questions:<br /><br />If the Blackout compensation wasn&#039;t good enough, why didn&#039;t Simotas try to help Frei-Pearson and the other activists get more out of ConEd back then? Why didn&#039;t she get involved in the Marriage Equality stuff last year? Why has she been completely absent from these important issues? What accomplishments DOES she have?

				I just got this from Simotas website<br /><br />Aravella Simotas is a lifelong resident of Astoria with a strong commitment to her community and public service, and has devoted herself to making a positive impact on the lives of others. &nbsp;Aravella’s career in public service began at the New York City Council’s Office of Oversight and Investigation, where she focused on various public safety, youth and environmental issues, and was followed by community affairs work at the offices of Council Members Peter Vallone, Sr. and Peter Vallone, Jr. Now, she is running for the State Assembly to continue delivering results for her community and middle-class families because she understands the serious issues facing western Queens.<br /><br />A graduate of the New York City public school system, Aravella appreciates the value of a solid public education. &nbsp;Aravella attended Public School 17, Junior High School 126 and William C. Bryant High School in Astoria, and continued her education at Fordham University and Fordham University School of Law. &nbsp;Aravella is dedicated to ensuring that our children receive the same first-rate education that she did. &nbsp;That’s why, as our next Assembly Member, Aravella will ensure that critical education funding is not cut during these tough economic times.<br /><br />Aravella fully understands the environmental issues facing western Queens. &nbsp;Over the years, Aravella has demonstrated a relentless commitment to our community’s environmental health. &nbsp;While at the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Aravella advocated for environmental causes with New York State Assembly Member Michael Gianaris and fought to curb construction of highly polluting power plants. &nbsp;Aravella’s hard work in this endeavor resulted in a reduction of over 250,000 pounds of our state’s annual toxic emissions. &nbsp;In Albany, Aravella will continue her diligent environmental oversight so that western Queens remains a clean and safe place to live.<br /><br />Aravella’s dedication to public service is rooted in her commitment to protecting the civil rights of all citizens. &nbsp;Irrespective of one’s race, age, ethnicity, religion, gender, disability or sexual orientation, Aravella understands that equality for all should be the foundation of our society. &nbsp;That’s why Aravella has volunteered a significant amount of her time to providing legal representation to the economically challenged, and has handled cases that have had a widespread impact on the local community. &nbsp;Recently, Aravella was honored by the United Spinal Association for her part in representing an individual in a wheelchair who was denied access to his housing development and discriminated against on the basis of his disability.<br /><br />Aravella is also a staunch supporter of LGBT rights. &nbsp;Aravella knows that for too long, LGBT couples have been denied the rights and benefits they deserve, including social security benefits, hospital visitation rights, co-parenting rights, tax equity, and bi-national family-based immigration rights. &nbsp; As our next Assembly Member, Aravella will fight to ensure that equality for all is finally enacted by our Legislature.<br /><br />Aravella knows that working families are the cornerstone of New York’s economy. &nbsp;As an attorney at the United States Court of International Trade, Aravella addressed disputes involving domestic companies and American workers who lost their jobs because of outsourcing. &nbsp;In turn, these hardworking men and women received the benefits they deserved. In the Assembly, Aravella will continue to look out for working men and women and will fight to take away tax breaks for companies that outsource jobs overseas. <br /><br />Aravella is a long serving member of Queens Community Board #1. &nbsp;Aravella also serves on the boards of the United Community Civic Association and the Hellenic Times Scholarship Fund. &nbsp;She was presented with a Citation of Honor by Queens Borough President Helen Marshall for her commitment to these and various other community organizations. &nbsp;Aravella currently lives in Astoria with her husband John Katsanos.

				I haven&#039;t seen any evidence offered about Frei-Pearson&#039;s voting record one way or the other. There seems to be an element on this thread that wants to raise questions without backing them up and spin everything into a negative for Frei-Pearson. I hope they&#039;re not affiliated with the Simotas campaign, because it speaks pretty terribly for her if they are.

				The ConEd issue has been a confusing one for me. <br /><br />The first question is who was/is Western Queens Power for the People. How did this organization come about? I&#039;ve asked before and haven&#039;t received an answer.<br /><br />The second is how the settlement came about. I just googled and came up with this link that contains a treasure trove of information from the Public Services Commission. <br /><br />http://www3.dps.state.ny.us/W/PSCWeb.nsf/All/0F519E7284794F3085257687006F38D3?OpenDocument (http://www3.dps.state.ny.us/W/PSCWeb.nsf/All/0F519E7284794F3085257687006F38D3?OpenDocument)<br /><br />There are two things that intrigued me as I clicked on the various links. <br /><br />The first thing is that there was a final report released concerning the investigation into the power outage. It was released Feb 9th 2007 and is a 190 page document. So it isn&#039;t completely true that the settlement ended the investigation. But, interestingly, PCS wanted to continue the investigation. April 2007, they called for a Prudence Investigation that would, as far as I can tell, move from the factual investigation into more of an investigation of the culture/attitudes of ConED that would have created the process that would have lead to the blackout. I think that means looking into whether ConEd cared more about pleasing the shareholders then updating equipment. <br /><br />Anyway, on April 24th 2008, a settlement was announced. And as you can see WQPFP wasn&#039;t the only group to sign off on it......Here&#039;s a link to a page that shows that four other groups signed off on it. http://www3.dps.state.ny.us/W/PSCWeb.nsf/All/ACD11A54EB8E5B7E85257696006D4A78?OpenDocument (http://www3.dps.state.ny.us/W/PSCWeb.nsf/All/ACD11A54EB8E5B7E85257696006D4A78?OpenDocument)<br /><br />okay, now I just found an article from the Queens Gazette stating that state law actually doesn&#039;t allow for much more of a settlement. <br />http://qgazette.our-hometown.com/news/2008-04-30/Features/Lawmakers_Denounce_Con_Ed_For_Paltry_Blackout__Set.html (http://qgazette.our-hometown.com/news/2008-04-30/Features/Lawmakers_Denounce_Con_Ed_For_Paltry_Blackout__Set.html)<br /><br />Here are two quotes<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;This proposal must still be reviewed by the Public Service Commission before it goes into effect, <strong>and some have pointed out that we would not even be considering this settlement plan if it were not for the inadequacy of state laws that stymie efforts to hold private utilities truly accountable for their failures.</strong> No matter how this issue isultimately resolved, it is very clear that we need to make changes in our laws to better protect all of New York&#039;s communities from the type of devastation we experienced here in Queens.&quot;Vallone (D- Astoria) stated,</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Alyssa Bonilla, of Sunnyside, a member of the Power for the People organization, stated: &quot;The laws that currently exist to seek justice against a privately owned utility company are inadequate.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And to end this long post....Our retiring Sen Onorato had this to say. <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;On the other hand, under the terms of this proposed settlement, Con Ed will not be able to pass along $40 million in outage related costs and $6 million in other charges to its customers, and it will provide $17 million from shareholder funds to pay for the refunds, community environmental projects, and a study on the economic and health impacts of the blackout. <strong>Members of the Western Queens Power for the People Campaign worked hard to win these concessions, and are to be commended for their efforts.</strong></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />My conclusion:<br /><br />An investigation was done and completed....but ConEd didn&#039;t want the prudence investigation. <br /><br />The laws of our state didn&#039;t really provide for a more satisfactory settlement. <br /><br />WQPFP worked hard to get terms beyond what the law allowed for. <br /><br />And for all the carping by Maloney, Gianaris, Clinton et al........State Law Sucks.....and Western Queens Power For the People got us more that we actually would have gained. <br /><br />ps....I just spent an hour creating this post because it is an important issue and not an attack on anyone...I do truly want to know what happened. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

And as you can see WQPFP wasn&#039;t the only group to sign off on it......Here&#039;s a link to a page that shows that four other groups signed off on it. http://www3.dps.state.ny.us/W/PSCWeb.nsf/All/ACD11A54EB8E5B7E85257696006D4A78?OpenDocument (http://www3.dps.state.ny.us/W/PSCWeb.nsf/All/ACD11A54EB8E5B7E85257696006D4A78?OpenDocument)<br /><br />okay, now I just found an article from the Queens Gazette stating that state law actually doesn&#039;t allow for much more of a settlement. <br />http://qgazette.our-hometown.com/news/2008-04-30/Features/Lawmakers_Denounce_Con_Ed_For_Paltry_Blackout__Set.html (http://qgazette.our-hometown.com/news/2008-04-30/Features/Lawmakers_Denounce_Con_Ed_For_Paltry_Blackout__Set.html)<br /><br />Here are two quotes<br />And to end this long post....Our retiring Sen Onorato had this to say. <br />My conclusion:<br /><br />An investigation was done and completed....but ConEd didn&#039;t want the prudence investigation. <br /><br />The laws of our state didn&#039;t really provide for a more satisfactory settlement. <br /><br />WQPFP worked hard to get terms beyond what the law allowed for. <br /><br />And for all the carping by Maloney, Gianaris, Clinton et al........State Law Sucks.....and Western Queens Power For the People got us more that we actually would have gained. <br /><br />ps....I just spent an hour creating this post because it is an important issue and not an attack on anyone...I do truly want to know what happened. <br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />this is a great post.&nbsp; I pretty much agree or at least understand what you are saying. But my main concern is the creation of this group (power for the people) and the deal they made. I don&#039;t remember any sort of public outreach or public meetings about this. All i remember is an announcement about this stupid settlement. It annoyed me!&nbsp; Maybe I am too cynical but I think it was all about getting peoples name in the paper..and too be fair the only person I saw pushing it was this guy Brodsky from westchester. I dont want to attack anyone I dont remember seeing pearsons (so he might not be as bad as i think) name but i do remember the guy from westchester and being annoyed that he was dictating to us......anyways my main point is that pearson is pushing this deal and I dont like the deal but again i dont know the whole details behind it i just know it hurt me.

				<br />Thanks for the info. Because of the candidates and issues involved, I hope voters will take very seriously the race for <span class="bbc_u">Attorney General </span> as well.<br />Curious, who might Gianaris be supporting for AG.<br /><br /><br />I am surprised by the reactions when all the local officials, and Gianaris as colleagues, were aware, and were asked throughout to communicate with residents.<br />I was not made aware of the issues by them except&nbsp; by occasional press release and eventually a town hall, appreciated but would have liked more.<br />&nbsp;I was updated thanks to the efforts of the QP4P. What were you doing at the time? Where were you getting your information?<br /><br />I see it as comparison a group creating a new school that may be crowded. You then say what a problem. But as an alternative, would you rather have no school at all?<br /><br />As I understand it, rather than any payment from Con Edison, without the agreement we each would have had to pay Con Edison hundreds of dollars to pay for the damage they themselves caused. Then you would cry, how come no one prevented that. This deal <span class="bbc_u">helped </span> you.<br />We all wished the deal could have helped more.<br /><br />One other point, I think some imagine folks simply like the color green. Part of the agreement is to put back in our communities investments aiming to reduce the need or demand for energy. The hope is to make it less likely of a future blackout.<br /><br />**<br />What surprises me is that a number are well versed on the issues. We need that then translated into action and resolution.<br /><br />http://www.dps.state.ny.us/06E0894/06E0894_CoverLetter_JP_4-24-08.pdf<br /><br />Gianaris and active members did have very helpful research and recommendations.<br /><br />http://assembly.state.ny.us/member_files/036/20070130/<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The PSC should institute a formal proceeding on the question of Con Edison&#039;s prudence and gross negligence. <br /><br />The State Legislature should amend the New York State Public Service Law to remove the tariff bar against suits for damages from outages due to simple negligence.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The concerns of the monopoly powers regulated by the state are known.

				While I was at dinner last night with TRX and Megc, TRX asked a question that got me to thinking. <br /><br />First off, this is not an attack on any candidate but an analysis of the situation as truly exists in Albany. <br /><br />Let us begin with the reform agenda both candidates are presenting. We are in an era where everyone hates Albany. But the simple fact is unless we throw out every current member of the legislature, not much will change. I do remember someone posting that it seemed ironic that we are in the process of promoting Gianaris to the State Senate. <br /><br />So both candidates are promising us reform. But how is that possible if Sheldon Silver is still the Speaker of the Assembly? Silver, one of the three men in a room. <br /><br />Really?<br /><br />Your gonna make Speaker Silver reform Albany and take away his power?<br /><br />Really?<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry but it is not happening. Not for an hour, not for a minute, not for a second. <br /><br /><br />So where do we go from here? To me this is key. What you have to ask yourself is, do you want to vote for a candidate that has been groomed for this moment? Or do you want to vote for a candidate that has marched in the streets and made some noise? <br /><br />I&#039;m sorry, but I want change (yeah, I know that phrase has been abused).<br /><br />But, I don&#039;t really see how you can get change from someone who has served on a Community Board and is clearly a part of the establishment. I really don&#039;t see Simotas going up against Speaker Silver. <br /><br />Can anyone on this Board provide me a concrete moment where she has stood up against the Establishment? And the LIC editorial column doesn&#039;t count. <br /><br />

				It sounds like Ciafone is really conservative--one of those Democrats who&#039;d be a Republican if he lived in a district where the GOP had any shot of winning. I&#039;m definitely not voting for him.<br /><br />I find this interesting:<br /><br /><em>“They’re the older voters who supported George Onorato for so many years,” Vallone said. “They have a very large membership, and they love Aravella.”</em><br /><br />I thought Simotas was a progressive? But Ciafone is a threat to her <em>conservative</em> base?<br /><br />I have to say, given what I&#039;m learning here, I&#039;m starting to lean toward Frei-Pearson. I&#039;ll admit, the dirt-throwing from Team Simotas on this thread isn&#039;t helping. But at least I know where Frei-Pearson stands--he has a record to back up his statements. I like what Simotas is saying but she seems to have a very thin record to support it. And it seems like her base is mainly conservatives and Party power brokers.

				Well, you could attack me personally all day, as you do, and the moderators sit on their hands, but read this newspaper article below. Read the red section.

				so Ciafone, who has no reason in the world to make this up, says on his own, that Pearson encouraged him to run.<br /><br />So Jeremiah wants a conservative who is gonna attack the gay community and attack marriage equality to run, and make this race ugly, and create a climate where anti-marriage pamplets will be distributed by Ciafone and terrible things will be said bringing out peoples worst prejudices, all so Jeremiah could benefit from some strateguy to split the &quot;conservative&quot; vote. <br /><br />So, since everyone has had a problem with everything i have pointed out, all the truths, all the times I got deleted or banned or whatever, here is a person, Mr. Ciafone, who is against the person everyone says I am with, saying that Jeremiah encouraged an avowed anti-marriage equality candidate to run.<br /><br />I would love to see what you all think about this ?

				Sting55, you have no credibility at all. Anything you say is pure spin and if you&#039;ve been banned or otherwise had your comments removed I suspect it&#039;s because you&#039;re relentlessly making malignant, defamatory statements against Frei-Pearson. And, to my knowledge, that kind of viciousness isn&#039;t allowed on this board. You are obviously either a Simotas plant or a pure troll. You can whine about being called out for it all you want, but I hope you know how bad you&#039;re making Simotas look. I came to this thread to learn about the candidates and mostly all I&#039;ve learned is that her supporters on this board are running a smear campaign.

				Thinking more about Vallone&#039;s comment. How can the LGBT community expect Simotas to really be a champion for marriage equality if she&#039;s depending on Onorato&#039;s supporters and can&#039;t afford to alienate them? Especially if she&#039;s competing with Ciafone for those voters!

				New York Times<br /><br />Violence Comes Uncomfortably Close to a Gay Shelter <br /><br />By COLIN MOYNIHAN<br />Published: July 14, 2008<br />For the people who live at a residence for gay and transgender youth in Astoria, Queens, the cramped four-room apartment they share is a congenial harbor, a place where they do not have to worry about the prejudices and dangers they often face on the streets.<br />&nbsp;<br />Ruby Washington/The New York Times<br /><br />The Rev. Louis Braxton Jr.was attacked last week outside Carmen’s Place, a shelter he runs in Astoria, Queens. <br />Last Monday night those dangers arrived on their doorstep when a group of young people confronted the residents outside their home. Insults were exchanged and punches were thrown. No serious injuries resulted, but four teenagers were arrested and charged with using improvised weapons to attack an Episcopal priest who runs the shelter, which is called Carmen’s Place.<br /><br />In the end, the confrontation could have been much worse, but the half-dozen or so residents of the shelter, who are in their late teens to mid-20s, said they were still alarmed. <br /><br />“This is a safe haven for the kids,” said Michael Dropp, the president of the group’s board. “That’s why the things that happened Monday night are really a shame.”<br /><br />That conflict began when the Rev. Louis Braxton Jr., who runs the shelter, witnessed teenagers striking a resident in the head with a bag of garbage. Moments later, Father Braxton said, the teenagers turned on him, striking him with an empty paint can, swinging metal shelf brackets at him and finally breaking a wooden miter box against his head. He was treated for minor injuries.<br /><br />The police arrested four teenagers and charged them with assault, criminal possession of a weapon and harassment. Witnesses said that the teenagers shouted anti-gay slurs. The police were investigating whether the attack was motivated by bias. In the past few days, advocates and elected officials have condemned the attack.<br /><br />A spokeswoman for the Legal Aid Society, which is representing one of the defendants, said the agency was looking into what happened.<br /><br />Father Braxton said that he had called the police twice before for minor incidents, but that he had never experienced a conflict as serious as the one last week. Some Astoria residents who had heard about the attack expressed sympathy for the residents. Many others said that they had no idea that the residence existed.<br /><br />Carmen’s Place opened in 2005 as part of St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church in Astoria, after Father Braxton allowed teenagers who had been living on neighborhood rooftops to sleep in the church basement.<br /><br />After the church closed in 2007 because of financial difficulties, Father Braxton decided to continue the mission by renting a second-floor apartment on Steinway Street in Astoria, in the midst of a busy commercial strip. <br /><br />There, anywhere from six to eight youths sleep in bunk beds and store their few possessions in metal lockers. There is always an adult chaperon on the premises. Carmen’s Place is the only residence in Queens for gay and transgender youths, and residents come from as far away as California and Hawaii.<br /><br />Life is not always easy for Father Braxton’s flock. There are manipulative boyfriends to deal with and unfamiliar men who form odd obsessions after seeing residents on the streets. They are tempted by nighttime boulevards and alleys where sex can be sold as easily as cigarettes, Father Braxton said, and by an inclination to mistake the lust of strangers for romantic love. There is also harassment, running the gamut from nasty looks to rude words, or worse.<br /><br />“I’ve been spit on,” said Cherry Snodgrass, a 20-year-old gay man from Oklahoma who lives at Carmen’s Place. “I’ve been hit.”<br /><br />Some of residents battle depression or other disorders and take medication to stay on an even keel. Others have been ejected from similar shelters in Manhattan after behaving disruptively. For many of those who show up there, Carmen’s Place is a refuge of last resort, Father Braxton said.<br /><br />Supervising the youths and trying to steer them toward productive paths can sometimes be difficult for Father Braxton, who said that he had served at parishes in Rye, N.Y., and Teaneck, N.J., before taking on the duties at St. Andrew’s. He said he was motivated by the urgency of trying to help people in need.<br /><br />“The Gospel calls on us to feed the hungry and clothe the naked,” he said.<br /><br />Fulfilling that charge is arduous. The residence relies on private donations and the largess of food pantries. Each week is a struggle to make ends meet, Father Braxton said.<br /><br />One resident, Chloe Elsworth, 25, described coming to New York 18 months ago from Orange County, Calif., hoping to design clothes, but instead being kicked out of a Manhattan shelter and sleeping on the No. 2 train before being taken in at Carmen’s Place.<br /><br />Ms. Elsworth said she was rattled when she saw Father Braxton being attacked.<br /><br />“I was scared for him,” she said. “Seeing a man of the cloth being beat down like that was brutal.”<br /><br />Father Braxton said he was planning to move to a bigger place with more security, provided he could raise the necessary money. He added that he had already chosen a spot — in the same neighborhood.<br /><br />“Astoria people tend to mind their own business,” he said. “It tends to be a live-and-let-live kind of place.”<br />

				If Ciafone is telling the truth about Jeremiah Pearson encouraging him to run, knowing that Ciafone&#039;s entire platform will be to oppose marriage equality, I believe that those actions risk bringing out and increasing anti-gay bias.<br /><br />How exactly does one run a campaign focused almost exclusively on opposing marriage equality and it not increase bias and prejudice ? And you dont think bias and prejudice and some guy running around trying to get votes by saying &quot;the gays are taking over, lets stop them&quot; might eventually lead to a bias incident ?<br /><br />Well Mango, your a righteous person, but I just disagree with you.<br /><br />And most importantly, if you care about the issue or the people it could hurt, WHY in the world would you encourage such a campaign ?<br /><br />Disagree with me in regard to the possible risks or results, but certainly an anti-gay marriage conservative shouldnt be ENCOURAGED to enter the primary by a marriage equality activists ? Lets say he wins ? How does that help our cause ?<br /><br />There are dozens and dozens of posts here that say how great it is that two marriage equality people are running. I have never read someone saying &quot;No, what we really need in this race is a homo-phobe who will run on a anti-marriage platform and that we the gay commnuity should organize to go find that person and recruit them.&quot;<br /><br />I mean cmon Mangopango. Lets call it for what it is. This guy Jeremiah is enormously disappointing, constantly. No matter how much you and other folks have invested in him.<br /><br />But you read about it all in the article. Jeremiahs folks spun the article. Ciafone running a nasty anti-gay campaign will help Jeremiahs electoral chances. Thats what THEY told the reporter, not me.

				Okay, I think I&#039;ve had enough vodka to think this through without losing my mind. <br /><br />I want to say first of all that I was a bit offended early when I read about gay bashing. It felt almost like a threat to me. But I didn&#039;t respond and decided to wait until I got home. And now I am not as offended. Give me a moment to explain. And yes, this will be a long post. <br /><br />I was initially puzzled by Ciafone&#039;s entry into the race. But as I read through several 2001 articles, the feeling I get is that there is an amount of bitterness regarding Our current City Council member. Claims of a monarchy etc. And ironically, the other candidates slammed the clubs etc for endorsing Vallone without considering anyone else. <br /><br />I can&#039;t help but feel that Ciafone is entering the race to get revenge against the establishment. <br /><br />And I think that may come back to bite some in the ass. <br /><br />Now regarding Marriage Equality, I was a bit offended Sting, that you called me out. But I have a feeling you did it because you know how passionate I am about the issue, having been with my partner now in Asotria for 6 years and wanting to protect him with every legal advantage that a straight married person has. For me, I do not doubt for a second the commitment of JFP or AS when it comes to Marriage Equality. Simotas was very specific on this issue on her website and I am happy with that. <br /><br />Okay, so on to the statement by Ciafone that Jeremiah encouraged him to run. In a chess match sort of way I get it. To have an opponent enter the race that will peel off natural supports of the other candidate is a brilliant move. One hopes. <br /><br />Because it may be possible that in an off year election that doesn&#039;t contain a presidential candidate, Jeremiah may have outsmarted himself. Look at the statistics for those types of elections. Only the most dedicated voters show up at the polls. In the 2001 election, Vallone won with only 5,000 some odd votes. The second closest candidate got 3000. And that is the whole reason that Ciafone was angry back then. Statistically, he knew he would lose. <br /><br />Let me end this post with this thought. My Partner and I have often said that we will have full rights once our parents die. We say this because support for full gay rights is generational. The polls prove it. And old people are more reliable voters. <br /><br />And in the end......<br /><br />We could end up with a Democratic candidate that hates marriage equality.......<br /><br /><br />And wouldn&#039;t that be ironic.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Im sorry I have to be the one to lay out this heavy stuff, but here we go. Everyone knows that John Ciafone and George Delis, former Community Board # 1 District Manager, are best friends and political allies. In fact, George Delis stood up at the Aldos Club and made a big speech about the need to support Ciafone. Read below. This is who George Delis is. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />LocalQueensCommunity Board 1 district manager George Delis hit with sex harass lawsuit&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Community Board 1 district manager George Delis hit with sex harass lawsuit<br />BY John Marzulli <br />DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER <br /><br />Tuesday, June 16th 2009, 10:07 PM <br />&nbsp;<br />George Delis known as the &quot;mayor of Astoria,&quot; retired in 2008 after 30 years as the district manager.A former female staffer at Community Board 1 in Astoria is alleging she was sexually harassed by longtime district manager George Delis, according to explosive charges in a lawsuit.<br /><br />Marcela Gutierrez contends in the suit that she was forced to quit her job as a receptionist in December 2007 because her complaints about Delis&#039; behavior were ignored by board Chairman Vinicio Donato and, as a result, her health was deteriorating. <br /><br />Gutierrez alleges that Delis frequently made comments about his sexual prowess, twice invited her to watch pornographic films in his office, openly touched his private parts and referred to her as a &quot;hooker&quot; and a &quot;lesbian,&quot; according to the suit filed in Brooklyn Federal Court. <br /><br />Delis, 64, a charismatic community activist who is known as the &quot;mayor of Astoria,&quot; retired in 2008 after 30 years as the district manager. <br /><br />The suit also alleges that Delis was thrown under the bus by Donato in sworn testimony before an unemployment insurance appeal board. <br /><br />&quot;Mr. Donato testified that &#039;On many occasions, [Gutierrez] had come to me complaining about [Delis&#039;] abusive language to her and reference to her sexual preference,&#039;&quot; according to the complaint. <br /><br />The suit seeks unspecified monetary damages from Delis, Donato, the City of New York and Queens Borough President Helen Marshall, who appoints the district managers and has a supervisory function over the boards. <br /><br />Marshall&#039;s spokesman said the borough president&#039;s office has no record of complaints filed by Gutierrez. <br /><br />Donato refused to comment, but Delis had plenty to say about the suit. <br /><br />&quot;I had nothing but problems with her,&quot; Delis told the Daily News. <br /><br />&quot;She was totally incompetent. She bragged about being gay, and she hit on every woman who came in the office. Why would I watch adult movies with her? I couldn&#039;t stand her.&quot; &nbsp;<br />Donato hired Gutierrez for the $24,000-a-year job without going through the proper screening by the board because she was his daughter&#039;s baby-sitter, Delis said. <br /><br />&quot;Vinny should step down before this gets messy, because I&#039;m not a guy who backs off,&quot; Delis said. <br /><br />Gutierrez&#039;s lawyer said yesterday he had nothing to say beyond what is stated in the suit. <br /><br />The city Law Department said yesterday it is reviewing the case &quot;thoroughly.&quot; <br /><br /><br />

				City settles federal sexual harassment suit against George Delis for $98,000<br />BY John Marzulli <br />DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER <br /><br />Thursday, March 4th 2010, 4:00 AM<br />&nbsp;<br />George Delis was accused of sexual harrassment by a female staffer. The city has paid a $98,000 settlement to a former female staffer at Community Board 1 in Astoria who had claimed in a federal lawsuit that she was sexually harassed by former Board 1 district manager George Delis.<br /><br />Marcela Gutierrez&#039;s explosive allegations included Delis inviting her to watch pornographic films in his office, commenting about the size of her breasts and constantly bragging about his sexual conquests.<br /><br />Gutierrez also claimed that Delis referred to her as a &quot;hooker&quot; and a &quot;lesbian.&quot;<br />The suit, filed last June in Brooklyn Federal Court, also named Queens Borough President Helen Marshall and the board&#039;s chairman, Vinicio Donato, as defendants for failing to control Delis.<br /><br />A spokeswoman for the city Law Department said the settlement was in the best interest of all parties - but Delis and his lawyer blasted the payout.<br /><br />&quot;I objected to settling,&quot; Delis told the Daily News. &quot;It was all a crock of s--t. The fact that she&#039;s getting anything is an injustice.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;She was incompetent and the lawsuit was retaliation because I told her to get out or I&#039;d write her up and get her fired,&quot; Delis added.<br /><br />Gutierrez claimed she quit her $24,000-a-year job as an aide due to Delis&#039; alleged abuse. Her lawyer, Bruce Bernstein of New Jersey, said they were satisfied with the settlement and declined further comment.<br /><br />Delis, who retired in 2008 and is known as the &quot;mayor of Astoria,&quot; said he favored fighting the charges all the way to a trial.<br /><br />&quot;Though the city opted to settle, there was no finding or admission of any wrongdoing by Mr. Delis,&quot; said Walter Kretz, an attorney hired by the city to represent Delis.<br /><br />Assemblyman Michael Gianaris (D-Astoria) said it was unfortunate taxpayers had to foot the bill for Delis&#039; alleged behavior. &quot;He [Delis] should have to reimburse the city for the damages,&quot; Gianaris said.<br /><br />jmarzulli@nydailynews.com<br /><br /><br /><br />Read more: http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2010/03/04/2010-03-04_city_settles_federal_sex_harass_suit_against_delis_for_98g.html#ixzz0pJJtRM7u<br />

				City Hall News<br /><br />Conservative Democrat Enters Race For Gianaris Seat<br />By Chris Bragg<br />&nbsp;<br />Add one more candidate to what at first seemed like it would be a sleepy race for the Assembly seat of Mike Gianaris. <br /><br /><br />John Ciafone, an attorney and former school board president in Western Queens is getting into the race—and he hopes to appeal to conservative Democrats with a platform which includes support for charter schools and opposing gay marriage.<br /><br />Ciafone, who is Italian-American, officially announced his candidacy at a meeting Tuesday night the Long Island City-based Aldos Democratic Club, which he heads. The meeting was also attended by his two Democratic opponents in the race, civil rights attorney Jeremiah-Frei Pearson and corporate attorney Aravella Simotas.<br /><br /><br />Gianaris is running for the Senate seat being vacated by George Onorato, who is retiring.<br /><br />Ciafone, who opposes same-sex marriage, said he would run to the right of the two other candidates, who are pro-same sex marriage and who so far have been jockeying for the liberal primary vote. The district has a heavy Latino, Greek, Irish and Eastern European populations that can be more socially conservative than the normal Democratic primary electorate.<br /><br /><br />The district largely overlaps with that of Council Member Peter Vallone, Jr., one of the most conservative members of the City Council, and is squarely within the Senate district held by Onorato, who voted against the same-sex marriage bill.<br /><br />Even though he is a former school board president in the area, Ciafone also said he was strongly in favor of lifting the charter school cap, which he said also said differentiates him from his two opponents.<br /><br /><br />“I saw first hand how afraid everyone was of the UFT,” he said. “Most politicians are afraid of them.”<br /><br />Ciafone said he hopes charter school supporters will provide him funding in the race. He has hired consultant Michael Tobman, who is working with several pro-charter candidates this year. <br /><br />Ciafone was complimentary of Frei-Pearson—whom Ciafone said had encouraged him to run—but bashed Simotas for her close ties to Gianaris and other members of the Queens Democratic Party, which last Monday voted to officially endorse Simotas.<br /><br /><br />“All the politicians have already gone with her,” Ciafone said. “They’re like the political mafia.”<br /><br /><br />As a conservative Democrat, Ciafone could cut into the base of older, more conservative voters in the area that typically back the county candidate, in this case Simotas. Frei-Pearson, meanwhile, is trying to make inroads with the younger voters that have moved into Astoria and Long Island City.<br /><br />Simotas’ campaign, though, in a statement to City Hall said that, “It doesn’t matter who runs because Aravella is the best candidate and is going to win.”<br /><br />That sentiment was echoed by Vallone, who beat Ciafone in a heated 2001 Council campaign, and has endorsed Simotas. Vallone noted that Simotas, who is the first Greek-American woman to run for Assembly, already had lined up the support of the biggest Democratic club in the area, the Taminet Regular Democrat Club. <br /><br /><br />“They’re the older voters who supported George Onorato for so many years,” Vallone said. “They have a very large membership, and they love Aravella.”<br /><br />

				Jeremiah Frei-Pearson is a steadfast friend to the gay community with a proven history of advocacy for our rights. Sting55&#039;s odious comments are truly beyond the pale. Politicizing the tragedies that struck my community is both incredibly offensive to me as a gay man and a disgusting attempt to defame the character of a man who stood with us when those terrible attacks happened. Sting55 will do anything to destroy Jeremiah&#039;s reputation and distract from the fact that Aravella Simotas was nowhere to be found in the LGBT community&#039;s hour of need. The unrelenting smear campaign waged by Team Simotas on this board is yet another reason I&#039;m proud to&nbsp; support Jeremiah Frei-Pearson.

				I think all the back and forth is a lot to take but I will say that I think the fact that Pearson encouraged a bigot to run is just horrible. This man (Ciafonee) has made statements that compare homosexuality to incest. I wouldnt even want to sit down in the same room with him. I think Pearson is obviously playing politics but it is a dangerous game imagine all the progress we make and we lose an assembly seat. I was at the Stonewall meeting this week and even Pearson said he 100% trusts Simotas on LGBT issues. I think the issue is now do we trust him because he is encouraging Ciafone to run. Just my two cents

				As usual, whenever Sting55 goes too far, somebody else from Team Simotas steps in to lend him credibility.<br /><br />Ciafone claims Jeremiah &quot;encouraged&quot; him to run. The Simotas Attack Squad is attempting to spin that against Jeremiah like they do with everything anyone says. The truth is, Jeremiah feels, as I do, that primaries are good for our Party and he wouldn&#039;t dissuade anyone from throwing their hat in.<br /><br />Over and over, Jeremiah has stood with my community whenever we needed allies. His record is beyond reproach, despite the malignant attempts at character assassination being carried out by Team Simotas here.&nbsp; But, as usual, they&#039;re just trying to distract from the fact that Simotas has no actions to back up her words. Why should we believe Simotas will be a champion for equality now when she already had numerous chances and was nowhere to be found? If she wouldn&#039;t stand with us when we needed her, why should we stand with her now?

				As long as we&#039;re making things up and asking people to prove they&#039;re not true, maybe Sting55 will prove that he and his disgusting comments are not sanctioned by the Simotas campaign? Or maybe he can prove that he himself is not an anti-gay bigot?<br /><br />You see, I would be remiss if I seriously asked those questions because the burden of proof would be on me, not Sting55. But Sting55 doesn&#039;t play by those rules because he&#039;s not here for a discussion. His posting record shows he&#039;s a hatchet-man who came here to do nothing but attack. Like the rest of the Simotas Attack Squad, he&#039;s here to destroy Jeremiah&#039;s reputation and distract from Simotas&#039; lack of involvement with the issues important to Astoria. And he&#039;s here to do it anonymously so he can do it by any means necessary.<br /><br />And you&#039;ll note, not a single Simotas supporter has denounced these disgusting tactics on this board.

				You&#039;re a very angry young man, Mr. Murphy. You will learn though. <br />&nbsp;<br />Most importantly, because of your behavior, LBGT leaders thougout the city have decided to call on Jeremiah to renounce Mr. Ciafone and Mr. George Delis. <br /><br />Which I guess will lead to Mr. Delis speaking to the press and telling everyone what exactly his conversations have been with Jeremiah.<br /><br />For the record, Mr. Delis has been convicted in a court and a $100,000 judgement was awarded to a woman who worked for him and was the target of sexual harrassment and anti-lesbian slurs. <br /><br />Between Delis and the anti-gay bigot John Ciafone, your buddy Jeremiah is keeping quite interesting company.<br /><br />

				&quot;Sting55,&quot; you&#039;re right I&#039;m angry. I&#039;m angry because you&#039;re brazenly waging a smear campaign to destroy a good man&#039;s name. I&#039;m angry because you have the audacity to politicize the hate crimes in my own community in service of a candidate who never had one thing to say about LGBT rights until she needed our votes. You deal in lies and insults. You hide behind anonymity because you know as well as I do that you could never get away with your defamation if people knew who you were. You and your cohorts are exactly what&#039;s wrong with our politics and people are sick of it.<br /><br />A number of individuals have come forward on this board to declare their support for Aravella Simotas. I&#039;ve yet to see any of them denounce Sting55 or his cohorts for their relentless attacks and negativity. Will any of them do so? Or is dirty politics all we can expect from Team Simotas?

Although some of the LGDCQ members are indeed Party staffers, the club has diverged from the Party line on occasion (currently with Lynn Nunes race) and they are not stooges. I was surprised they endorsed the AD 36 candidate who has no record of LGBT advocacy but they&#039;re entitled to their choice. Jeremiah has a lot of LGBT support in the district and the endorsement of three LGBT organizations to date. In the end, though, I&#039;m more interested in a candidate&#039;s record than their promises or endorsements.

				I agree, mcdirk, Laura Jean is one of the good ones. She&#039;s also reliant on the goodwill of the Party--like most Simotas supporters I know. While I disagree with ditmarszoe&#039;s implications about the LGDCQ, I do think it&#039;s pretty telling how many Simotas supporters depend on the Party for a paycheck or otherwise rely on the Party&#039;s goodwill professionally. Meanwhile, many of Jeremiah&#039;s supporters are ordinary residents in the community who just want a fair choice for their representation--a choice the Party is doing everything it can to deny them.

An Orthodox Jew who backs same-sex marriage, the elastic Silver adapts, ingratiates, and compromises as deftly as an Albany leader astride such a diverse Democratic conference can. He weathered one coup a decade ago, and mixes just enough muscle and mensch to get what he wants out of a 150-member body of caged egos and blatherskites, each straining for their elusive moment in the klieg lights.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If your mad at Albany and you want things to change........Well, what we have seen unfold over the last two months is a perfect example of why it will stay the same. <br /><br />Here&#039;s a link to the article which is an intersting look into what Cuomo faces when he, most likely, becomes Governor.<br />http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-06-08/news/andrew-cuomo-biggest-rival-old-school-democrats/1 (http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-06-08/news/andrew-cuomo-biggest-rival-old-school-democrats/1)<br /><br /><br />

				From everything I have read or heard about Aravella she seems like she is on the right side of every issue, that is why I like her.

				You know, the Simotas supporters on this thread are throwing around all kinds of accusations about &quot;attacks&quot; but ever since I came to this thread, I&#039;ve seen the majority of the hostility coming from their side. Honestly, just read the nonsense from Sting55. Mcdirk and BRIAN are notable exceptions and I wish we&#039;d hear more from them.<br /><br />I&#039;ve thought a lot about this race since it&#039;s my district and my representation. I started out trying to be open-minded, despite the overwhelming negativity from one side on this board. But as I&#039;ve said, I&#039;ve decided to support Frei-Pearson.<br /><br />As stevecrawford says, Simotas &quot;seems&quot; like she&#039;s on the right side of things. But she&#039;s mostly talk from what I can tell. She just doesn&#039;t seem to have <em>done</em> much to back up her words. Honestly, I just don&#039;t feel Simotas is running on her own merits: she&#039;s benefiting from tremendous systemic advantages as the Party pick and the playing field in this election is just incredibly distorted in her favor. Given that the Democratic Primary is the only chance voters in this district will have to choose their representation, I think that&#039;s disgraceful.<br /><br />Astoria&#039;s representatives, Mike Gianaris and George Onorato, just voted to cut $775 million dollars from New York&#039;s healthcare; taking away indigent care funding for people who can&#039;t afford insurance and reducing Medicaid reimbursements for the poor. How can we expect their protege, Simotas, to do any different? I think that&#039;s the fundamental question of her candidacy: she&#039;s a product of the same Albany system that gives us scandal, corruption, and failure. How on earth is can we expect her to be anything but more of the same?

I don&#039;t think that anyone is personally attacking Aravella. I&#039;m pretty sure that all of us agree that Aravella is a great person. However, several people, including myself, have made the point that if you are a part of the establishment and you are appointed by the establishment, when you get to Albany, you will be inclined to become a part of the establishment up there too. And that is because of the way the system is set up in Albany. If you make waves up there, Speaker Silver will assign you office space in the tiniest closet he can find. <br /><br />2. Many people here feel that this was decided in back rooms and We the People don&#039;t really have much say here. That is were another part of the frustration lies. <br /><br />One last point, many Aravella supporters have made the point that she will bring resources back to the district.

				I suppose what I don&#039;t understand is why it&#039;s so bad to be part of the establishment. While I <em>do</em> understand the importance of bucking trends and being a strong voice in our dysfunctional government to try and bring about some reform, how does an outsider who failed to capture the endorsement of the major party bigwigs get <em>anything</em> done in the chance they actually do get elected? Wouldn&#039;t there be resentment and stonewalling? And wouldn&#039;t that only hurt the district?<br /><br />In 2008, Barack Obama was backed by the established Democratic Party and thrust into the spotlight over candidates with more experience and greater recognition. Was that a bad thing too?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been on the fence about who to vote for, but this point I see myself voting for Simotas. I do believe that a person who is supported by the others in her party will be more likely to get things done than an outsider with little party support. I believe she&#039;s on the right side of the issues and would do a good job representing the district. <br /><br />And frankly, the accusations of &quot;plants&quot; on the board and the bickering between supporters of <em>both </em> sides makes me feel like I&#039;m in high school again and we&#039;re talking about student body president elections. <br />

Just like Sting55, you often make negative claims about Jeremiah without providing any evidence whatsoever.<br /><br />In fact it was Aravella&#039;s paid spokesman, Mike Murphy of the Parkside Group, who attacked Jeremiah in the press for his work on the ConEd lawsuit: http://www.yournabe.com/articles/2010/04/26/astoria_times/news/at_astoria_assembly_spat_20100422.txt<br /><br />Echoing the smear tactics of Sting55, Mr. Murphy (yes we share a name) accused Jeremiah of &quot;betraying our community.&quot; It would seem the Simotas campaign is the one &quot;bashing&quot; people--starting way back in April.

				Where are the campaign HQs?<br /><br />I like the example of the Dromm campaign. I do feel Jeremiah is in that model.<br /><br /><br />But doesnt Dromm support Aravella?

				TRX, to answer your questions:<br /><br />Jeremiah&#039;s campaign headquarters is at 25-06 31st Ave on the corner of Astoria Blvd.<br /><br />Aravella&#039;s campaign headquarters is at the Taminent Democratic Club at 33-09 23rd Avenue.<br /><br />I have no idea where John Ciafone&#039;s campaign headquarters is but it wouldn&#039;t surprise me if it&#039;s the Aldos Independent Democratic Club at 28-11 23rd Avenue.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think Danny&#039;s campaign is a one-to-one comparison to Jeremiah&#039;s. There are similarities but every campaign is different. Lynn Nunes&#039; city council run last year might be a closer match--though I hope it doesn&#039;t end the same since Lynn lost by only 4 votes. Speaking of Lynn, he&#039;s running for State Senate now to unseat incumbent Shirley Huntley. Huntley was a vote against marriage equality and I encourage everyone to help Lynn out: http://nunes2010.com/

				For the folks that have been saying how they&#039;d like to hear more from the candidates, I have good news! Jeremiah invited his opponents to 9 debates in a letter sent to each campaign today by his Campaign Manager.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the text of the letter:<br /><br /><em>In exactly three months, the people of our community will decide who will represent them in the State Assembly. It’s the first time in a decade that this district will not have an incumbent in the running, which makes this election a unique chance for the voters to choose a new direction for our government. With government dysfunction leaving our community in the lurch day after day, the stakes are high. Jeremiah Frei-Pearson feels that the candidates owe the people of our community every opportunity to hear from those who seek to represent them.<br />&nbsp;<br />Political debates are a time-honored tradition that will give the voters a forum to hear the candidates discuss and defend their visions for our community. Jeremiah believes that a robust contest of ideas strengthens our democracy and helps ensure that our neighbors will make an informed decision on September 14th. With that in mind, he issues this challenge: Aravella Simotas and John Ciafone meet Jeremiah for nine debates, open to the public, before election day. We suggest each candidate choose a debate venue in the order in which they announced their candidacies. This will ensure a fair process and a diverse set of forums.<br />&nbsp;<br />I’m certain the three campaigns can come to an agreement on matters such as times, dates, and other specifics. In the interests of scheduling, however, I ask that you please confirm your acceptance of this proposal by Wednesday, June 16th and that the first venue be chosen by Friday, June 18th.<br />&nbsp;<br />In three months, our neighbors will choose from three individuals offering three different paths for our community. Let’s give them the chance to make the most informed choice possible.<br />&nbsp;<br />Sincerely,<br />&nbsp;<br />Jesse Laymon<br />Campaign Manager<br />Jeremiah Frei-Pearson for Assembly</em>

				The specific details would have to be worked out between the campaigns but Jeremiah has proposed that each candidate alternate in choosing a venue for a total of 9 debates with the candidates choosing in the order in which they announced their campaigns. And I&#039;m certain at least Aravella and Jeremiah will make the ballot as I know both candidates have a committed group of people working hard every day to get them signatures. I can only assume the Ciafone campaign is doing the same. I saw him canvassing in my neighborhood on Saturday and he&#039;s already got palm cards made up.<br /><br />Also, Jesse Laymon is a he, not a she.

				Update: <strong>John Ciafone</strong> contacted the Frei-Pearson Campaign via email last night to say that <strong>he will attend all nine proposed debates</strong>. His response came before the end of the Wednesday deadline requested by the Frei-Pearson Campaign.<br /><br />There has been <strong>no response</strong>, however, <strong>from the campaign of Aravella Simotas</strong>. I think that&#039;s very unfortunate and I have to wonder why she&#039;s choosing to deny the voters the opportunity to hear all the candidates discuss and defend their plans for our community.

				There&#039;s an Assembly race happening in Astoria this year and I was hoping that would mean -- since it&#039;s such a local race -- that I&#039;d get to meet the candidates and really compare them up close. Jeremiah Frei-Pearson I&#039;ve seen a couple times. He held a free public concert recently and I see his supporters on the street quite often collecting signatures or knocking on doors. So my question is, has anyone actually seen Aravella Simotas anywhere?<br /><br />Does she have any interest or intention of meeting the voters or is she just running on her endorsements because honestly that&#039;s how it&#039;s starting to feel. I saw recently she held a $100 per person fundraiser, which I guess is sort of cheap in the scheme of things, but it&#039;s definitely out of my price range and I imagine it is for most in the this community as well. Are there any free or public events coming up? I&#039;d even take a debate but so far she has yet to commit to one even after both Jeremiah Frei-Pearson and John Ciafone have done so. Does she not think she has to earn our vote?<br /><br />Well, Aravella, my vote is definitely still up for grabs, but not if you have no interest in meeting me or debating so I can hear from you exactly what you believe in. <br /><br />Come out come out wherever you are, Aravella! <br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />an interested voter in the 36th

				I meant it as a serious question. Has anyone seen Aravella?

You&#039;re right that I hadn&#039;t read the previous thread, I couldn&#039;t find anything related to politics on the front page so started my own topic. I&#039;m glad the moderator moved it for me to the right place but I seriously hope we can have a civil discussion about this race in more than one topic thread here. I mean, if folks don&#039;t like the debate, you don&#039;t have to read it, right? Does fresh air = no political debate? I would think this would be a perfect use of this board.<br /><br />B. Not sure what hellsgatetim means when he says &quot;I mean lets call a spade a spade but Person and Ciafone are going to debate they are both on the same side. Jeremiah was the one that encouraged Jeremy to run.&quot;<br /><br />First of all, Jeremiah Frei-Pearson and John Ciafone are not on the same side -- Ciafone is a conservative Democrat who is opposed to gay marriage and Pearson is a progressive.

It&#039;s not even substantiated but what if he did? What does it have to do with Aravella&#039;s refusal to face the voters and face her opponents in an open process? That&#039;s what I want from all the candidates in this race and I resent the notion that the Queens machine is going to hide her away as if she can&#039;t handle herself in an actual campaign. I&#039;m sure she is a smart woman who can hold her own. So I ask again, where is she?<br /><br />Clearly, I am new here but as I said in my original post, I am a concerned voter in the 36th AD. Hopefully we can have a productive discussion on this board about this race. <br /><br />Thanks.

As well as photos on her facebook page of her canvansing Astoria. <br /><br />As far as debates go, I would like to see it worked out. But this nine debates challange fits the norm. ie, the underdog makes a debate for many debates the the presumed frontrunner bats down.....back and forth, back and forth and we mostly end up with two to three debates......if any at all. I&#039;m curious to see where it falls and would really love for Aravella to agree to something. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				@kempsternyc: Very true, but the very fact that she is &quot;the frontrunner&quot; is absurd b/c it&#039;s simply a function of her being Mike Gianaris&#039;s handpicked choice. She&#039;s not the incumbent but is running as though she is. I wish she&#039;d act like she has to earn our votes. Ultimately, I bet you&#039;re right about the debates.<br /><br />@mcdirk: good to hear. Hopefully I&#039;ll run into her some time.<br /><br />@stevecrawford: no idea what you&#039;re talking about. I&#039;ve never posted on whyleaveastoria but will check it out. this may serve as a good lesson to me, however, to come up with a more creative username. I must say, I did wonder how long it would be before I was accused of working for Jeremiah. nope, I don&#039;t work for Jeremiah but I do admire his politics and his style. I&#039;m certainly leaning toward him but genuinely hope this race becomes the sort of thing where I can meet all candidates and make an informed up close and personal sort of choice. That&#039;s how a race at this local a level should be, IMHO.

				My criticisms of the political process notwithstanding, I am still undecided on both candidates.&nbsp; Even though I feel Aravella Simotas&#039; candidacy is for all the wrong reasons, she might very well do a good job in office.&nbsp; Jeremiah Frei-Pearson has not yet distinguished himself in the race so far, but he is out there fighting a tough fight.<br /><br />I know that there are two camps here with leanings for one candidate and the other, but I don&#039;t think anyone can honestly say how these two really stack up until we see them together in a debate.<br /><br />On the basis of name recognition, financials, endorsements and strategy, Aravella Simotas seems to be way ahead.&nbsp; On the basis of experience, capability, education, political views, they are similar.<br /><br />As for John Ciafone, I know little about him but I don&#039;t think he is a wildcard in this election.

				Sweeper, it&#039;s a big deal when they&#039;re lying about being committed to a campaign and possibly posting under multiple screen names. What kind of discussion can anyone have with a shady group of anonymous posters cynically pretending to be interested voters while systematically trying to discredit Simotas&#039; opponents, even to the point of character assassination (as we saw with Sting55)?

				Talk about clearing the air.<br /><br />Anyway, a lot of folks on this board have asked for more specifics from the candidates. So here are two policy statements Jeremiah has made which weren&#039;t picked up by the press, so you probably didn&#039;t know about.<br /><br />Sensible Zoning:<br /><br />&quot;The Zoning Proposal coming before City Council today is the result of eight years of hard work carried out by the people of our communities. I&#039;ve been proud to stand with them and stand up to over-development that distorts the character of our neighborhoods and puts unsustainable stress on our infrastructure. Over a year ago, as a member of the Long Island City Alliance, I called for rezoning to protect and preserve the unique character of our neighborhoods and the quality of life in our communities. I am very proud to see this process finally come to a vote in our City Council.<br /><br />But this is only the beginning. More needs to be done to ensure that our subways, our electrical grid, our schools, and our hospitals can handle our growing population. Many times, I&#039;ve joined my neighbors to rally and speak out against over-development. Recently, I have helped gather signatures to prevent tenement-style construction near Athens Square Park that would over-stress our resources, contribute to over-crowding, and reduce the quality of life in our area. Time and time again, we&#039;ve shown that when people come together as a community, we can enact real change. And that is what we need to bring to Albany now. In the Assembly, I will continue to stand with the people of our neighborhoods to bring change to Albany and fight to keep over-development from disfiguring and overwhelming our communities.&quot;<br /><br />Living Wages:<br /><br />&quot;I strongly support the Fair Wages for New Yorkers Act. It is unconscionable that any working people live in poverty in a city that has more billionaires than any other place on earth. The working families of New York deserve better. This bill is an important first step to securing the foundation of our economy: the hard-working men and women of our communities.<br /><br />When I&#039;m elected to our Assembly, I pledge to introduce a similar bill to protect the middle and working class people of our State. By guaranteeing them the fair wage they deserve, we will provide much-needed security to the people who drive our economy and we will invest in sustainable, bottom-up growth that will strengthen and rebuild our State.&quot;

				Thank you moderators!<br /><br />So, is there a pro-Simotas person (in the district, preferably) left on here who isn&#039;t a troll and who might want to actually engage in a substantive debate about this race? Personally, I have yet to hear a real argument FOR Aravella&#039;s candidacy. I loved the person at the N train today handing out Simotas lit saying &quot;campaign to change Albany.&quot; Really? I&#039;m not saying Gianaris is among the worst we have up in Albany, at all, but Aravella by definition, as the candidate hand picked by the party to replace Gianaris, represents a continuation of the status quo. By definition. I mean, no one who knows anything about the race can really argue she&#039;s a change agent. So, what is the argument FOR her? More of the same!? Hey, I have all the endorsements!? Sad that that&#039;s all she has but that really is it, right? I do welcome another argument (although spare me the &quot;she&#039;s Astoria&#039;s candidate&quot; thing. I might throw up in my mouth a little...)seriously...a substantive one...anyone?<br /><br />And I have yet to see her anywhere by the way...<br /><br />And what&#039;s with her refusal to debate? What is she afraid of?

				After reviewing the positions and qualifications of both candidates, I am pro-Simotas. I am not a troll, don&#039;t work for her campaign, and have engaged in discussions on this board that have nothing to do with politics.<br /><br />Simotas and Frei-Pearson have very similar positions on the issues that are important to me. Where they differ is their background. Aravella is a lifelong Astoria resident with strong ties to the community. As a lifelong Astoria resident myself, I respect that and believe that she can appreciate both the new, younger generation moving into Astoria as a less expensive alternative to Manhattan and Brooklyn, as well as the old Astoria residents who laid down roots here decades ago. <br /><br />I firmly believe it&#039;s important for both Astorias to be represented -- the old and the new -- and think that Aravella can do that. While I&#039;m sure JFP would do just as good of a job if elected, I think Aravella would be more responsive to the needs of the community based upon her strong ties and roots here.<br /><br />While I do believe that JFP has laid down roots in this neighborhood and I greatly appreciate what he has done in the time he&#039;s been here, I just don&#039;t believe he has the same insight into the community that she does.<br /><br />In reality, endorsements don&#039;t typically influence my vote, but in this situation, people who I respect have thrown their support her way and I can appreciate that. Had they endorsed JFP, I would have considered the reasons why as well.<br /><br />The &quot;change&quot; and &quot;more of the same&quot; argument may have worked for Barack Obama&#039;s campaign in 2008, but it&#039;s really not applicable here. Mike Gianaris did a great job as Assemblyman and quite frankly, if we can expect &quot;more of the same&quot; of that from Aravella, I&#039;d be perfectly happy. The status quo in Albany can be blamed on senators like Ruben Diaz and Pedro Espada and assembly members like Sheldon Silver. Onorato represented this neighborhood for so long, he became completely out of touch with it. Fortunately Onorato will be replaced by Gianaris, so at least one creaky cog in the wheel will be gone. I suspect that Aravella has been &quot;hand picked&quot; because she&#039;s capable, intelligent, respected, and will do an excellent job representing this community. <br /><br />And fwiw, check out her Facebook page and you&#039;ll see where she&#039;s been. I haven&#039;t seen JFP anywhere, does that mean he hasn&#039;t been out there? No. I don&#039;t profess to be everywhere at all times, I can&#039;t imagine you are either.

I imagine that she&#039;s respected because she&#039;s earned the support of many other well-respected people. I have no evidence that JFP is intelligent, respected and will do a good job either -- but I suspect that he is, and would do a good job as well. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s an especially difficult conclusion to come to about either candidate.<br /><br />Second, she says she supports gay marriage. I don&#039;t believe one needed to protest at Onorato&#039;s office to prove that. I support gay marriage and I wasn&#039;t at Onorato&#039;s protesting either. JFP took that particular issue and ran with it -- I appreciate that, believe me, I do -- but to me, there&#039;s more to life in Astoria than marriage equality. <br /><br />I&#039;m not a single issue voter. I don&#039;t think someone earns my vote just because they&#039;ve &quot;[fought] for the LGBT citizens of Astoria.&quot; It&#039;s nice that there are candidates out there that support the LGBT community and recognize the importance of equality, but being gay is not the be all end all of who I am. I&#039;d rather see a politician that works to get our neighborhood better access to education and better funding for social service programs. If they support equality, even better.<br /><br />Someone asked if there was anyone here who supported her who didn&#039;t work for her campaign -- I responded. Why you feel the need to aggressively challenge me about my choice seems kind of odd. I get that you&#039;re a JFP supporter, but I would think that a respectful dialogue about why we support our candidates would go much further to make one&#039;s point.

				Thanks holy for your thoughtful reply. But, as I suspected, it&#039;s just more of the same she&#039;s lived in the neighborhood and she has endorsements reasons, which is fine if that&#039;s important to you. But I&#039;m looking for something substantive. Like, as Kempster notes, what has she actually done? So Gianaris appoints her to the community board and now he&#039;s essentially appointing her to the Assembly and people are acting as though she&#039;s done anything to earn a vote. I find it really strange.

Many of the same questions might be repeated. If there are a significant number, I would hope each debate might have a lead theme, perhaps suggested by each canddiate.<br />Debates on education, reform, health care, family values, civil rights, ...<br /><br />There is no reason any of the candidates should fear debating. I hope they take place before end of August.

				Here is Jeremiah&#039;s statement on the decision to end the race:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Together, we collected a massive number of signatures and raised more money than all but one non-incumbent Assembly candidate in Queens. More importantly, we helped frame the terms of this debate. We lead the fight for marriage equality, for good government, better schools, more hospitals, a sane energy policy, and a government that doesn&#039;t ignore the 80,000 children in Queens who live in poverty. I am very proud of our what we accomplished and of the values we fought for.<br />&nbsp;<br />Unfortunately, the dynamics of the race have changed in the past week. After this past week&#039;s developments, we still have path to victory - but that path would require us to run a negative campaign against a fellow Democrat.&nbsp; This is a path that I am unwilling to take. <br />&nbsp;<br />As a result, after many discussions and lots of prayer, Karla and I have decided not to go forward with this campaign. This was a very tough decision - and it was made even more difficult by the amazing outpouring of support we received. <br />&nbsp;<br />Although this political campaign is ending, the causes for which we fight endure. I am looking forward to working with Marriage Equality New York to help all New Yorkers get the right to marry; I am looking forward to continuing to fight to ensure that more children get the opportunities they need; so that our community&#039;s schools improve, so that we get more hospital beds, so that immigrants are welcome throughout our country, and so that we can finally fix our energy policy. We have lots of work to do and I hope you will continue to work alongside me. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Of course I&#039;m saddened by this decision. But even so, I understand and support Jeremiah&#039;s reasons for ending the campaign. His only remaining path to victory required a negative campaign against a Democrat with a considerable following in the District. He&#039;s put our community and our shared values ahead of this single election and I can assure all of you that he isn&#039;t going anywhere. We will continue to have his leadership, his support, and his advocacy on all the important issues facing our communities.<br /><br />I strongly believe that competitive primaries are good for our Party and good for the people. A robust contest allows the best candidates to emerge, vetted out in the open by the people. I believe that we&#039;ve achieved that for Astoria. We know a lot more about all the candidates and their views than we would&#039;ve if Jeremiah hadn&#039;t made his bid. There are 36 pages of discussion on this forum that never would&#039;ve happened if Jeremiah hadn&#039;t run. This race has also proven that Aravella Simotas has tremendous support in our community. I&#039;ve had the opportunity to speak with her on several occasions and I have found her to be intelligent, interested, and open to good ideas from wherever they emerge. She will be Astoria&#039;s voice in our Assembly and I hope we can all come together to work with her on the issues facing our community.

				I feel bad for the people who campaigned for Jeremiah and I think he let them down.&nbsp; The primary was only a little more than a month away and his candidacy at least offered a choice for Astoria residents.<br /><br />Jeremiah did not engage in a negative campaign, but it did not make him look gracious, he seemed dispassionate and boyish.&nbsp; As if his innate goodness could overcome an inane campaign that was more cabaret than caliber.<br /><br />Aravella&#039;s campaign had no compunctions attacking Jeremiah as evidenced in this message thread.&nbsp; In a political race, there is no second place (unless you are Hillary Clinton).&nbsp; You play to win.&nbsp; Aravella knows that.<br /><br />I take stabs at the Astoria Political Machine for its evident entitlement, obsequious self-praise (on this message board and in print), and for positioning a woman for the Assembly whose greatest accomplishment, frankly, is being Greek.&nbsp; However, Aravella&#039;s campaign is effective and she communicated better than Jeremiah.<br /><br />Here is how Aravella described herself on her campaign website (first paragraph bio): &quot;Aravella Simotas is a lifelong resident of Astoria with a strong commitment to her community and public service, and has devoted herself to making a positive impact on the lives of others.&quot;<br /><br />Here is how Jeremiah described himself on his campaign website (first paragraph bio): &quot;Jeremiah Frei-Pearson lives in Astoria with his wife, Karla Mosley Frei-Pearson, and their two cats: Scooby and Scrappy.&quot;<br /><br />This is not a contrast of style, this is a WTF gaffe.<br /><br />Jeremiah is grassroots and organic, while Aravella is establishment and systemic.&nbsp; She has an enormous warchest (with a billionaire organizing her fundraisers), political connections, advisors and endorsers at her side, and a local newspaper that celebrates her every move.<br /><br />I guess Aravella&#039;s supporters are relieved since there is no other candidate to stand in her way (and John Ciafone doesn&#039;t count).&nbsp; They can breathlessly swoon over Aravella as she is &quot;changing the way Albany does business&quot; ...for the next twenty years.

BTW are you the same M Murphy that the e-mail goes to because that would be just weird?<br />From her facebook page someone thanked CWA local 1180.&nbsp; Will Ms. Simotas take a position on who she is willing to fight for in a battle between tax payers and public sector unions? Because that battle is brewing. And from where I stand, she is more than willing to take up the mantle of the public sector union over the tax payer.

				For reference:<br /><br />http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2010/08/17/2010-08-17_simotas_lone_seatseeker.html<br /><br />Ciafone was never remotely likely to win but it&#039;s still gratifying to now be absolutely certain that he won&#039;t be taking his regressive views to Albany on our behalf.<br />
