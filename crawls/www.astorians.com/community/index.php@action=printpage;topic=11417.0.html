				As long as we don&#039;t have a repeat of last year&#039;s storms following days of oppressive heat!<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/08/nyregion/08cnd-weather.html?hp<br /><br />In Minnesota, a few days of heat and humidity would sometimes end in tornado watches and warnings as cooler air from Canada (I&#039;m just guessing here, but it sounds good!) would collide with the warm air.&nbsp; It would get really calm and you could see the clouds start to ripple and swirl.&nbsp; <br /><br />But, yeah, if rain brings us relief from the heat, I&#039;ll be very excited!

				Yeah, it took me a while to get into Manhattan and then I ended up walking from Grand Central, after going to Times Square first and being told that the Lexington lines were working, to my office downtown, in muggy, 90 degree heat.&nbsp; To top everything off, I stepped in backed up sewage, somewhere near Houston Street, if I remember correctly.&nbsp; That was not a fun morning.
