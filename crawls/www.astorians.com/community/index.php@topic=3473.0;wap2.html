			We have been living in a wonderful 3 bedroom apartment near 31st Street and Ditmars Blvd. for 7 years but are being kicked out due to the buildings sale. We would love to find an apartment footsteps from this one because we LOVE the neigborhood! If anyone knows of a moderate/cheap place for rent in this area, that may or may not be on the market yet for the next coming months, please let me know. <br /><br />We are:<br />Amanda: responsible &amp; employed 20something<br />Joe: Amanda&#39;s brother, responsible &amp; employed 20something<br />Possible 3rd.<br /><br />We pay on time, are quiet &amp; tidy (and handy, which has helped with this old place!), and do not have pets.<br /><br />Thanks!<br />Amanda<br /><br />Amandasband@yahoo.com

			hey amanda<br />that blows. but nycmauser is right. check your lease and depending on the buildings status there may not be a legal reason to evict you and your bro. owner occupancy is however legit, so if the buildings new owner is ousting you so that their fam can move in its legit. but if they are ousting you simply because they bought it and feel like renovating it to make more money they can&#39;t do that.<br />post some info about the building, nycmacuser is a wealth of info and i can see what i can dig up.<br /><br />ps-when are you gonna book a gig in the neighborhood?<br />(we&#39;ll be helping out a future rock star)

			I don&#39;t know what price range you&#39;re looking for, but I&#39;ll copy here what I wrote to another person looking for apts in the area:<br /><br />There is a group of apts building on 21st Ave (one ave block from the Ditmars train station on 31st Street) from 28th Street all the way down to 21st street.&nbsp; They are recently renovating and are all NO FEE--the management company is renting directly.&nbsp; They have hardwood floors and are a decent size, and you can find some with really nice light. One bedrooms are&nbsp; going for $1200 up to 3 beds for 1800, I think.&nbsp; To contact the management, call 718-726-4000 ask for Shannon for Central Astoria (above 21st Street).&nbsp; I&#39;ve been told by a tenant in one of the Crescent St buildings that the owners are planning to go co-op and will offer tenants a chance to buy.&nbsp; It also looks like the buildings getting the most renovation are between Crescent Street and 28th Street on 21st Avenue--which is a lovely tree-lined block across from St. Johns Prep.&nbsp; My friend would not recommend the buildings West of 21st Street, which is owned by the same company, same number, different manager.&nbsp; Good luck.
