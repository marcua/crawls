				We are considering returning to Astoria, but need to get an idea of the price range for a 2 to 3BR apartment that&#039;s big enough to accommodate a family of 4 (our children are 2 &amp; 5).<br /><br />Can someone offer their knowledge on this?&nbsp; A lot of the 2BR second bedroom sizes seem TINY from what i&#039;m seeing on this forum, so that&#039;s what concerns me.<br /><br />Thanks very much.

				My husband and 14-month-old and I just moved to a 3-bedroom in a 2-family house and the rent is $1900.&nbsp; It is technically a 3-bedroom but the 3rd bedroom is pretty small and we are using it for storage since there are not many closets.&nbsp; It&#039;s great for storing all the kid stuff, though, and the other bedroom that our son is in is big enough for 2 children, I think.<br /><br />We&#039;re in the Ditmars area, about halfway between the train and the park, and the place is newly renovated with a spacious living area.<br /><br />Hope that helps!&nbsp; We were hoping to pay around $1700 but when we started looking that wasn&#039;t realistic for a big enough, nice place.

				Thanks very much.&nbsp; This is what it seemed like from the bit of looking around I&#039;ve been doing--we were hoping for more like $1700 as well, but it&#039;s looking like that&#039;s unlikely.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping maybe we&#039;ll be able to find something to buy instead of renting for a time and having to move twice.&nbsp; Appreciate your taking the time to share this helpful info!

				Our family of four (6 and 2 yr old) lives in a very large 2 bdrm on 21st St, just north of the TriBorough/RFK bridge. Our rent is 1800. FWIW, small single family 3 bdrm houses near us are being listed for between 575k (not safe for small children, you&#039;d have to rent somewhere else while you did tem up) to $650k.<br /><br />Good luck!

				Thanks--appreciate this info.&nbsp; We&#039;re actually looking to perhaps buy a 2-family (and actually have an accepted offer on one, but the inspection didn&#039;t go as well as we&#039;d hoped so we&#039;re not sure now).&nbsp; Just don&#039;t want to be rushed (since we&#039;re selling our house so are under a deadline), so that&#039;s why we might rent for a time.&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking it will probably need to be a large 2BR.&nbsp; Again, thanks for your input.

				YMMV, etc: we got an apartment bigger than we thought we would need, that we only planned to stay in for 2 years. Almost 6 years later, I am so grateful that we did. Keeping our options open has been very good for us; I am assuming that you&#039;ve considered what school you will be zoned for when you put in an offer... you might want to rent in a &quot;good&quot; school district until your youngest has gotten into Kindergarten, and then you can buy in a &quot;meh&quot; school zone which is also much cheaper. If you want to PM me, I&#039;d be happy to discuss our experiences off list. :)

				<em>looking to perhaps buy a 2-family (and actually have an accepted offer on one, but the inspection didn&#039;t go as well as we&#039;d hoped so we&#039;re not sure now)</em><br /><br />We&#039;re so disappointed with the selection in this area- everything would require serious renovation, yet the prices are on par for a move-in-ready places. For something in the same condition, you can spend $250k less and get a place in one of the much better school districts in NYC. Just look a little further into Queens, a few miles away. House prices seem to be coming down to a more realistic level everywhere but Astoria, as today we noticed a few houses we were keeping an eye on have been sold, most of them months after going on the market.<br /><br />Even New Hyde Park- just over the Queens border, it&#039;s right near the LIRR, maybe 45min into Penn, taxes are higher BUT one cute house in a top-rated school district was $399k. Even if you pay an extra couple grand in taxes, it&#039;s still 80% than private school each year.

				And dont forget if you work in NYC and live in NHP you wouldnt pay NY City taxes either . So adding that in , if both partners work in Manhattan the savings are pretty decent . Add in not having to pay for private schools and getting Herricks school district , its a great deal &gt;&nbsp; Only possible problem is the commute and the traffic . Dealing with that for some is murder .&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Im looking at New Hyde Park and hoping one day i will find something there . Just be carefull cuz alot of the houses in that area are zoned for mineola schools or even worse elmont .

				Thanos, the fact that *you&#039;re* looking there makes me think it&#039;s a good idea, since you&#039;ve got experience with real estate! It was killing me not to bid on the $399k house, but John&#039;s got a construction background and didn&#039;t like that the basement was mostly finished already, or that he wouldn&#039;t be able to knock down a wall or two for renovations. If he weren&#039;t handy, and if we had kids, we&#039;d have been all over it I&#039;m guessing. <br /><br />In any case, the shopping process is going to take a while, but there&#039;s hope.....just not around here, which is too bad. We&#039;ll just have to keep coming back to eat!&nbsp; :-)

				So you dont have kids , but do you want to have kids ? To be in that area as nice as it is , is really for the school district/&nbsp; Do you know what school district that $399 house was in ?&nbsp; &nbsp;If you dont find what you think is right for you in Astoria then dont let it get to you . NHP can give your a &quot;real&quot; back yard to entertain and relax and you dont have to have your neighbors right ontop of you like in Astoria.

				The realtor told us that it was zoned for the &quot;good&quot; school district, and he explained how tricky that can be, since other houses nearby fell into the less-desireable SD zones. Something like that.<br /><br />We probably won&#039;t have kids, but if we move out-of-state in the next few years, figure a good SD helps a house maintain its value.

				To me the schools other than some elementary schools , just arent that good . When you compare what you can get in LongIsland , theres no comparison . Plus more space and more privacy AND basially more house for your money .

				I am sure that I could one can buy a bigger, better house in Long Island, but the commute would be a nightmare.&nbsp; I have a 15-20 minute commute on the N.&nbsp; The quality of life that gives me is something i am not willing to trade for a bigger house, no matter how nice.&nbsp; &nbsp;Instead, i just complain about not being able to find anything i want to buy 8-)&nbsp;

				I think Astoria&#039;s a great place to raise kids.&#160; I find the suburbs bland, boring and isolating in comparison.&#160; Here, we have the world at our fingertips - all the fantastic places in Astoria and nearby in Queens and Manhattan and Brooklyn (and beyond!) to explore on the weekend - foods to try and people to meet and museums and parks and plays to go to and music to hear.&#160; We don&#039;t need a big house - we&#039;ve got life all around us.&#160; Every day when we go out we see people we know on the street and in their yards and in the shops - and I don&#039;t have to drive anywhere to get to it all.&#160; As for schools - zoned schools are not the only option.&#160; I haven&#039;t fully waded into the fray yet, but I&#039;m actually excited about all the possibilities.&#160; I don&#039;t think the suburbs have as many options.

				It depends on the age of the child and who is caring for them.<br /><br />If I lived further out I could have a nicer place and better schools, but I would also lose at least 1.5 hours a day with my daughter, meaning she would be in daycare/aftercare that much longer and I would not see her during the week.<br /><br />I&#039;d rather have the shorter commute at this stage of her life.

				There are actually very good schools in Astoria.&nbsp; And taxes on Long Island are very high-- 3 to 4 times as high as taxes in NYC.&nbsp; Commuting costs are also high.&nbsp; If you actually do the math Astoria is one of the best values in the area.&nbsp; <br /><br />For a 2-3 BR big enough for a family of 4 you&#039;d probably pay between 1500 and 2500 depending on what you feel like you need. Prices also vary based on the the state of the apartment. <br /><br />Good luck with your search!

				Astoria is great for renters who want to enjoy the social life. When you have kids, you&#039;re not eating out as often, plus you want to save for their college. A house in NHP can cost about HALF of what a house costs in Astoria, with maybe 1/2 hr extra commuting each way. That&#039;s $400k in savings. <br /><br />Taxes are more, but you don&#039;t have to pay for private schools, plus there&#039;s less garbage/fewer potholes/less crowding. And you can always visit Astoria.<br /><br />Yeah I hate the blandness of the &#039;burbs myself, but we&#039;re trying to stay in Queens since we don&#039;t need a whole lotta house or yard. We just want more room, peace/quiet and freedom to fix and update our surroundings.

				Christine is exactly right saying you can always visit Astoria ...and not paying NYC taxes on your check along with not paying private schools(i hve 2 kids) saves you a ton of money . SJP costs abt $7500 , so for me that would be like $15,000 .&nbsp; A year !<br /><br />Yea theres thing to do in Astoria , but theres tons of things to do in LI too , like go to the beach . Beautiful parks with lots of sports teams for the kids to join . ICYP looks like a joke when you see what LI&nbsp; has to offer with sports . <br />Ok PS 122 is good and Ps 2 is a&nbsp; good school but after that&nbsp; the schools arent that good . No matter how much people want to prop up Astoria saying there are good public highschools , test scores show they are among the lowest . Im born and raised in Astoria all my life&nbsp; and trust me&nbsp; when i say i do love it.&nbsp; But with kids you can get alot more for your money&nbsp; not too far away .&nbsp; NHP like Christine said isnt that far away&nbsp; and visiting or coming to Astoria to visit&nbsp; isnt hard to do . Yea commutes would be longer&nbsp; but its worth the sacrifice .&nbsp; If i didnt have kids , i probably wouldnt even be considering this&nbsp; , but since i do , i am . <br /><br />Taxes are high in LI luchamos cuz of the schools , so if you dont have kids in school&nbsp; then it wouldnt be worth it . <br /><br />

				I can&#039;t argue that anyone else is wrong for the housing choices they make for themselves and their families-- we all are doing the best we can. For me, I will say that I hope we can afford to stay in Astoria until we&#039;re old and wrinkly. I have two children, one is already in the public school. I love that I can walk down 24th Ave and the shopkeepers smile and wave at me and my children; when the toddler attempts to run into the street, there is always someone to stop him (he stops himself, but they don&#039;t know that and I&#039;d rather they stopped him than they didn&#039;t, you know?). I am pleased to live a carless live that is full and interesting. I love that my neighborhood is tiny but my world is vast. Why do I need a huge yard when I have Astoria Park? Why do I need to paint my walls when I can take my kids to the Met? Times change, minds change, maybe later we&#039;ll leave Astoria without a backward glance. But for now, for my little family, Astoria fits us just fine.

				I am with Lanseaux and Alia.&nbsp; I love the fact that my daughter is growing up surrounded by the diversity and complexity of the city.&nbsp; For us, the choice to raise our child in the city is about minimizing our ecological footprint, about access to the museums, art and music we treasure, and diversity.&nbsp; I grew up in the suburbs, and I much prefer this for her.&nbsp; (That is not to knock anyone else&#039;s choices--we all have our priorities and all of us struck the same balance between competing priorities, it would be a very dull world indeed.)&nbsp; We will be sending her to the public schools here and i am sure she will do just fine.<br /><br />But, as I said earlier, i do wish we could find a place to buy rather than rent.&nbsp; I am so sick of offwhite walls and neutral interiors.

				Well i know why i would want a nice big back yard with grass , and its&nbsp; because my kids can play in safety and in MY view . I can BBQ and enjoy the company of my friends and family without having to worry abt bother the neighbor whos house happens to be glued to mine . <br />Yea we have Astoria park , but&nbsp; we also have Astoria park filled with broken bottles , dog crap everywhere ,&nbsp; rats and other vermin&nbsp; as well as possible drug needles around .&nbsp; Sorry ill take the nice back yard anyday . Why would you need to paint your walls ?&nbsp; &nbsp; Well paint would brighten up the place and give it your own special look that you want .&nbsp; Going to the Met has nothing to do with that .&nbsp; &nbsp;Yea you might not need a car but to each their own . I couldnt live without one even in Astoria . How do people get to Costco ? Target ? Old navy ? Home depot ?&nbsp; &nbsp;Shopping bags in a bus or taxi ?&nbsp; &nbsp; I guess to some going to those places isnt a must .&nbsp; What happens when its 20 degrees out and you have to take the kids to doc&nbsp; or to the market ?&nbsp; im just wondering
