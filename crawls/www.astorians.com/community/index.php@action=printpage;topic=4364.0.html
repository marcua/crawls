				Hello all...<br />So, I&#39;d mentioned earlier in the week that I&#39;m looking at schools. I had been interested in photography and been doing some serious contemplating. (sigh):::<br />First and foremost I would like to be a Lit major and finish up my BA. Photography is sort of a &quot;dream&quot; and not a passion...its a fun idea.<br />So...down to the matter at hand. Has anyone attended the New School in Greenwich Village? Im not orig from NYC-been here 2 yrs and don&#39;t know too many people I can ask in my realm of friends. So far nobody. I&#39;m just looking for feedback on the cost, the quality of learning and if its flexible.<br />I work full time but will be looking to attend class at night. <br />Any feedback would be great.<br />Thanks in advance.

				I&#39;m almost through my first semester of graduate study at the New School. I moved here from out of state and chose to go to NS over the University of Miami for film/media studies. <br /><br />As for the cost, it&#39;s absolutely insane but that’s grad school in NYC for ya. (Now that I think about it, I believe Miami was slightly more expensive.) <br /><br />However, there are TAships and they do offer partial scholarships...at least for the media studies program, which is a rarity in the field. <br /><br />You should be able to find exact cost for the courses of the program that you&#39;re interested in on the NS website. I believe most students work during the day and take out federal loans to cover the cost.&nbsp; <br /><br />Nearly all of the grad classes begin after 4:00PM, most around 6:00PM and you&#39;ll find a good mix of folks right out of undergrad as well as professionals. <br /><br />The school is extremely diverse, much more than I expected. The student body is quite eclectic and I&#39;m continually stunned by how intelligent the students are. In the media studies program, the professors are a perfect mix of professional filmmakers, producers, artists, and academics. It&#39;s very well balanced.&nbsp; <br /><br />I can only speak for the media studies program but the level of academia is fairly intense. When they tell you 3 classes is full time, they mean it. You will be very busy trying to keep up! <br /><br />Aside from the cost, the only gripe I have with the school is the extremely small campus. Classes are much too small (physically) and resources can be hard to come by. Of course, I went to a large state school and much is that has to do with my move and adjustment to NYC. <br /><br />It’s a wonderful school. I’m very happy I made the choice to move here and feel that it will prepare me for PhD applications in a few years. <br /><br />I know the media studies program holds open houses. You should check into your program of interest to see if they do the same. Go check it out. Meet the professors. Talk to as many people as you can.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hope that helps! Feel free to PM me if you have any other questions. <br />

				Hi,<br />Thanks a lot, thats very helpful. I&#39;m a little leary because of the cost-I keep hearing now that its so expensive. Boo&nbsp; :-(<br />Oh well, theres always CUNY. My friend says Baruch is good so maybe i&#39;ll check that out. As much as I&#39;d like to go to New School the cost is freaking me out...darn<br />Thanks, i&#39;m glad you enjoy it...im sure i would too.<br />I looked at the Lit courses online and was psyched-it looks amazing! I want to major in Literature.<br />

				I am finishing up my MFA in Poetry&nbsp; at the New School this semester.&nbsp; Generally speaking, it is overpriced and not really exceptional in any way.&nbsp; There are some good teachers, but there are good teachers everywhere, at much less expensive institutions.&nbsp; <br /><br />I chose the New School based solely on the reputation of its Philosophy department, which is focussed on continental philsophy (e.g. Post-Modern Theory and the like); but is writing program is not like that at all: the emphasis is on &quot;craft&quot; and instructors tend to be somewhat theory-phobic and old-fashioned. I wouldn&#39;t describe the MFA program as particularly academic or intense.&nbsp; Then again, it is an MFA and not an MA or PhD program.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you are interested in the New York School, like the New York School exclusively (the head of the program&#39;s book about the NYS is called <em>The Last Avant Garde</em>, that about sums up the attitude of the program)--then the program is a good match.&nbsp; &nbsp; I don&#39;t know much about the undergraduate or the other graduate programs.&nbsp; Cschilds experience seems more positive than mine, but that is a different program.

				I formerly had a coworker who was finishing her B.A. at the New School.&nbsp; The class schedules were flexible, and I think she found the work challenging.&nbsp; She always seemed positive about the whole thing.<br />The CUNY schools have excellent faculty, and I&#39;m sure you can also get a great education&nbsp; at any one of them.

				Hey there~<br />I&#39;m enrolled in the Art Therapy Certificate program at New School. It&#39;s not undergrad and it&#39;s not grad (I have a BFA in painting already). What&#39;s nice is that it&#39;s much less expensive and has flexible evening classes, which is nice since I work full time....The teachers are wonderful and the students at the New School are very diverse (age/background) and bring so much to the classes.<br />It&#39;s giving me a really strong foundation in art therapy and giving me a better idea of whether I&#39;d like to pursue my MPS in the field. <br /><br />A good way to see if you like the teachers and the school in general would be to take some Continuing Ed photo classes. New School offers many of them....You could take some of the cont. ed classes while you&#39;re finishing up your other degree. Also- have you checked out SVA or Pratt for photo classes? I haven&#39;t taken any cont. ed classes at the art schools here in the city yet, but they obviously offer many more classes in the arts than New School!<br /><br />Best of luck!<br />
