				I saw them tonight on 35th &amp; Ditmars, on the south side of Ditmars...along the side of Crown Chemists. Anyone know why they had to move? A friend thought maybe permit issues, but it&#039;s been the same guys for long enough that they know what the deal regarding what permits they need, right? Around the corner from 35th &amp; Ditmars vs. Ditmars at 31st St is definitely a worse location for them. I already miss walking though and smelling the trees during my commute.<br /><br />If it was CVS that kicked them off the sidewalk, boo CVS. (I&#039;m a CVS fan too, so saying &quot;boo CVS&quot; hurts. Someone prove me wrong.)

				I had been getting my trees from them for the past couple of years but this year left a sour taste in my mouth.<br />I asked about an identical tree to what I had just seen sold and was quoted ten dollars more. I guess the gentleman assumed that with my young son and very pregnant wife that he could rip me off. <br /><br />Well done! <br /><br />

				When I was walking home last night around 7 pm last night the Taco Truck in front of CVS was packing up and leaving so I wonder if CVS is trying to push everyone out from that block?&nbsp; I also noticed tonight about 10:30 that the truck wasn&#039;t around which is a bit unusual for a Saturday night.

				According to one of the guys who sells trees there, the landlord from CVS had them move (twice). The landlord for the building next to Crown Chemists, they said, has been much nicer and is okay with them being there. I love the red and green lights that Crown uses during the holiday season so I&#039;m happy with the move. :)<br /><br />Sucks about 917 man being quoted a different price. These guys are always negotiable by at least $5 - $10. I think they make up the prices as they go along.

				I wonder how they&#039;re doing on that corner since they sell trees(and I got a beautiful one there) right across the street for about half the price.
