				I&#39;ve had good work done, and have also heard good recommendations for, the guy in the tiny little nook right near the post office on 31st St. His prices were extremely reasonable.

				I&#39;ve used the guy (who&#39;s super-friendly, BTW) on 28th Street, just south of 23rd avenue, next to that old man&#39;s bar that just closed. He did nice work re-soleing (sp?) my dress shoes, and the cost was pretty reasonable.

				I&#39;ve used both the guy on 28th (fixed a suitcase zipper) and the guy on 31st under subway (fixed a purse handle) for non-shoe purposes.<br /><br />Both were good but I liked the 31st street guy a little better.&nbsp; Not sure why -- might just be the smell of his store.&nbsp; Ah the fumes.

				Jim and I have used the 31st st. Guy next to the post office many times for lots of different things - heels, soles, fixing straps and such.&nbsp; He&#39;s pretty good, and reasonable.

				It&#39;s great to hear all this good feedback on the guy on 31st.&nbsp; I&#39;ll be visiting him this week.&nbsp; Thanks to all who have helped out with the advice!&nbsp; I appreciate it.

				Anybody know of any shoe repair stores around 30th Avenue? There used to be 4 stores on 30th Avenue between Steinway Street &amp; 31st Street, and now there are none. There is a small store on 36th Street just of 31st Avenue, but it tends to be closed more than it&#39;s open. I&#39;ve made 4 visits there in the last 2 weeks, only to find it closed each time.&nbsp; :?<br /><br />Seems like shoe repair is becoming a fading profession. <br /><br />If anybody knows of shoe repair stores near the 30th Avenue area, I&#39;d appreciate it. Thanks.&nbsp; :-)
