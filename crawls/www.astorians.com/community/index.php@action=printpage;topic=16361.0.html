				I don&#039;t know if anyone looks at google street view or even cares about it being you all live there but as an old 32nd street resident from the middle of the last century now living in NJ I have been waiting for the google execs to finally send the four way view truck down my forgotten street so I can finally see where I lived as a kid.<br /><br />Granted it&#039;s only a two block stretch before it ends at either the railroad trestle or Chinky Hill but people did grow up there and might be interested, like me. Thanks google.<br /><br />Some nice new sharp images of the old sleigh riding hill which is now a parking lot for Staples and the old building that looks like it is next in line for demo that was possibly the button factory that put many neighborhood Czech immigrants to work. <br /><br />Be warned, my grandfather will come out of the grave and shoot whoever did 23-20 32street, his beloved home, in red siding if google is available in the hereafter.&nbsp; Hank&nbsp;

				i think it is only a matter of time before human memory becomes searchable. when IBM or Rand or MIT needs beta testers then i will gladly volunteer one of my unused brain lobes to host an .idx file of my memory, searchable by swish-e or other open source products. it won&#039;t be google, though. their algorithm is too influenced by&nbsp; marketing and is focused on the frosting of the now while human memory is a composite creature made of all its times. <br /><br /><br />

				Actually, I find it&#039;s already a time capsule of sorts. The venue where we&#039;re getting married is newly renovated and amazing; the aerial view of Google Maps shows it as a construction site. <br /><br />Street View still shows Top Tomato and I&#039;m sure many other beloved, lost establishments.

				I was going to say that that data will soon be overwritten, but then I remembered that the Googies still claim Doubleday Books is it 724 5th Avenue. Doubleday retail evaporated and ceded that 5th Avenue space to a foofie purse and jacket shop over a decade ago. So when the Googies are gone maybe their old data will forever lie in state on Streetview, too. <br />p.s., I love old data. I think it should be sustained. I think every place of business should have a plaque or publicly accessible sign listing every business that previously occupied that space or street address. <br />

				I just wonder at what point Google Street View will need to be re-done? Every decade? &#039;cause it would be impossible to keep it truly current.<br /><br />As for the rest of Google Maps, guess they just have to keep plugging away at it, like a live phone book. They list CitiField although the map shows Shea Stadium as it was.

				That is what keeps people working. Hire more troops and keep everything updated every Monday...not realistic but a plan none the less.
