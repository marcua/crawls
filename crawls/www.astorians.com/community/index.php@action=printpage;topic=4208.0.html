				First off, hello everyone.<br /><br />I&#39;m old to Astoria, new to the board.<br /><br />Anyways, as someone looking to trade in my crappy tenement 1BR for something better, I see a lot of Criaglist ads for places in Garden Bay Manor.&nbsp; None of my friends seem to know where this is.&nbsp; Do you?<br /><br />As a side note, I love the neighborhood - been here 5 years now - and I want to find a new rental and even have an eye on buying.&nbsp; One thing that bothers me is that the architecture in Astoria really kind of sucks.&nbsp; Very few nice buildings compared to other neighborhoods in Brooklyn and even Jackson Heights.&nbsp; What&#39;s that all about?

				Well, actually, he is right to an extent. Some of the stuff going us is downright ugly and would be laughable if it weren&#39;t in our backyards. Astoria is getting a reputation as a place with with less than good taste when it comes to an urban landsapce. Go down to 12th Street and see Tara replaced by trash. Can you name any other place that would happen while a community says nothing?<br /><br />The only way that Astoria can remain a nice place is for everyone to work at it. Its dangerous for us to always say that everyting is nicey nice. Its not. Its even more dangerous for us to not get involved in our community, or let someone else define what is important and what is not. This is a prescription for disaster. <br /><br />Keeping Astoria nice is not a spectator sport.

				There&#39;s always so many ads (CraigsList and elsewhere) for this development, it doesn&#39;t seem very appealing.&nbsp; The fact it&#39;s in Elmhurst and always listed as Astoria is bothersome - am I somehow going to miss this small detail if I ever took a look at the place?

				Well, it&#39;s actually in East Elmhurst, which is not contiguous with Elmhurst; it&#39;s kind of wedged between Astoria and Jackson heights, sort of.&nbsp; The broker will try to convince you that it&#39;s not <em>really</em> that far from the train...that there&#39;s a bus on Ditmars that takes you right to the train, lickety split.&nbsp; But do you really want to wait for a bus then wait for the train?

It seems relatively quiet and very residential. The biggest problem really is that it is a long haul from the subway and like Goldfish Boy mentioned who the heck wants to wait for the bus and then wait for the train (especially in the inclement weather). My husband and I went to look at a two bedroom a few months back- and it was quite nice- but in the end didn&#39;t work out for us. <br /><br />It all just depends on what you are looking. If you have a car and drive to work it might work out for you.

				The moderators are discussing this right now. Before we create any rule though we might like to see if brokers posting in multiple places becomes a problem. We&#39;re of the opinion that it&#39;s better to not make rules unless necessary. That being said, I think we&#39;re generally okay with brokers participating in the discussion as many of them will have helpful advice. It&#39;s when someone just comes in and posts an advertisement in the middle of a conversation that really doesn&#39;t speak to the conversation that it&#39;s perceived as being in bad taste. Hopefully we&#39;ll all find a good balance for the new &quot;Apartments&quot; board that stays true to the &quot;Astorians.com&quot; format of conversation and minimizes the advertisement/spam mentality.<br /><br />Of course anyone is welcome to post a blatant advertisement in the advertising section. But the general rule here so far is that if someone wants to post outside the business section, it&#39;s better if the post be conversational, and less promotional.<br /><br />A good way to &quot;advertise&quot; I think is to just put your website using a simple text link, (or name, or phone number) in the signature of your profile - which shows at the bottom of every post.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=4208.msg43091.html#msg43091">Quote from: cjford on December 05, 2006, 01:04:05 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Is there a rule against brokers putting ads on threads that demonstrate clearly that they didn&#39;t fully read the post?&nbsp; If there isn&#39;t such a rule can one be created?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I think VPREALTY answered the question posed by the original poster. While it is clearly a plug, it did answer the question as to where GBM is. In fact, VPREALTY&#39;s post did it better than anyone else who posted in this thread. I figured one of us general public types ought to weigh in. I find plugs tacky, but I don&#39;t think they hurt the board unless they are abused. I think there was no abuse here.
