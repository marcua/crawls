				Will it be President Hillary in a few years? Maybe! (http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/01/20/clinton.announcement/index.html)<br /><br />I know that this one will be a bit of a controversy, but I think that with her running and Obama considering a run we&#39;ve got some history in the making. This election, I think, will be even more interesting to follow than the last presidential one. And that was a good one - with sad results in the end IMHO.

				I think it will be interesting to see how campaigns compare to the 2000 race.&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br />And will the next administration keep much or any of promises made before the election.<br /><br />The Daily Show had a wonderful debate between President Bush and campaigning Governor Bush.<br />&nbsp; :cry:&nbsp; :-D<br /><br />How would 2008 be more historical and interesting than when Senator Mosely-Braun was seeking the nomination? Is it because of money, name recognition, insider connections?<br /><br />If you look at the committees where Clinton and Obama serve, they cover very important issues.<br />From armed services and homeland security to aging; health and education.<br /><br />I hope whatever ticket will be chosen would include experience beyond just time in the Senate. Ideally they would have someone with executive experience on the ticket.<br />(But I guess we already had that since 2000 ...&nbsp; &nbsp;:|&nbsp; )<br /><br />May the &quot;conversations&quot; serve the interests of the people of our country.

				I&#39;ve been through her web site since the announcement, and while it is impressive, (especially as compared to Barack and John) I was a little turned off with the &quot;conversation&quot;. I found it condescending in a way. Possibly she is trying to overturn her <em>unfriendly</em> persona that has been alienating people thus far and trying to bring it down to earth, show that she is really friendly. Still, the tactic stunk of <strong>Lifetime, television for Women.</strong> But I will watch with interest..<br /><br />

Bill Richardson, D-N.M., said Sunday he is taking the first step toward an expected White House run in 2008, offering extensive experience in Washington and the world stage as he seeks to become the first Hispanic president.<br /><br />&quot;I am taking this step because we have to repair the damage that&#39;s been done to our country over the last six years,&quot; said Richardson, a former congressman, U.N. ambassador and Energy Department secretary.<br /><br />&quot;Our reputation in the world is diminished, our economy has languished, and civility and common decency in government has perished,&quot; he said in a statement.<br /><br />He said he had set up an exploratory committee that will allow him to begin raising money and assembling his campaign organization.<br /><br />&quot;The governor is in it to run for president,&quot; spokesman Pahl Shipley said. The formal announcement will come in March after the end of New Mexico&#39;s legislative session, he said.<br />

				I think Hillary is using the same playbook she used when she ran for Senator here in NYS - a listening tour/conversation where she goes and talks with people and shows that she is not the monster she has been portrayed as in the media over the years.&nbsp; It worked in NYS and I think it might humanize her to many people who do not know her, aside from as a caricature, nationally.

To the best of my recollection, he&#39;d be one of a very few democratically-elected national leaders who were not of the majority race of their country.
