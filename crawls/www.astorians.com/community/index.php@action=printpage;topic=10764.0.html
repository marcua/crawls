				Just ate at Seva for lunch today. Really good, and friendly owners. They said they&#039;d deliver up to 15 blocks, which certainly includes Ditmars...<br /><br />

				I ordered from Seva tonight.&nbsp; First I ordered via their website, which for some reason required me to put my info in twice, and then gave me no confirmation that my order had been placed or when it might be delivered other than a &quot;your order has been submitted&quot; message at the top of the page.&nbsp; After waiting an hour, I called to check on the status of my delivery to find that their online ordering is down.&nbsp; So I placed an order via phone, which arrived 45-50 minutes later. <br /><br />As for the food, I got an appetizer sampler (veggie pakoras, two samosas, and something they call a &quot;lamb spring roll&quot;) , apricot lamb, garlic naan, gulab jamun for dessert, and a mango lassi. The pakora were delicious though greasy.&nbsp; The chicken samosa was kind of dry, grainy and flavorless.&nbsp; And the &quot;lamb spring roll&quot; was...weird?&nbsp; It was kind of a long breaded and fried tube stuffed with ground lamb, very oily.&nbsp; The garlic naan was yummy.&nbsp; The apricot lamb was so-so, it tasted much stronger of cinnamon and clove than of apricot, i think I was expecting some sweetness that wasn&#039;t there.&nbsp; It came with an order of rice which was very good.&nbsp; The gulab jamun was delish.&nbsp; The mango lassi was good, but because it was simply put in a plastic container and tossed in the bag with the rest of the order, it arrived warm-verging-on-hot.&nbsp; I poured it over some ice and let it cool down for 15 minutes, and it was pretty decent, but I&#039;m a little disappointed they didn&#039;t put it in a separate bag, or at least at the top of the big delivery bag rather than buried on the bottom between the curry and the appetizers.<br /><br />Overall, it was alright, but certainly nothing exceptional.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be ordering from them again anytime soon.&nbsp; I&#039;ll give Gandhi a try next time, and if they&#039;re as mediocre as people around here say they are, I&#039;ll probably just save indian for trips into Manhattan from now on.<br /><br /><br />

				If you love indian food and have the time, the best place to go is Jackson Heights in Queens.&nbsp; You can take the G,R or V from Steinway street uptown to the Roosevelt Ave. stop (10-15min subway ride).&nbsp; Other trains that go to Roosevelt Ave stop are the E,F and 7.&nbsp; The food in JH is inexpensive and very good.&nbsp; As soon as you exit the subway, you will see plenty of places, but I would recommend going along 74th St to 37th Ave.&nbsp; My favorite is an all-vegetarian indian buffet (maharaja) on 73rd and 37th, but there are also plenty of buffets with meat and the Jackson Diner is good.
