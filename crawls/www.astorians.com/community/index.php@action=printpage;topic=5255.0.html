				Nope. Happy Presidents&#039; Day to you, as well!<br /><br />Did you know it was originally &quot;Washington&#039;s Birthday&quot;, but since the 1980&#039;s it&#039;s become &quot;Presidents&#039; Day,&quot; no longer focusing on Washington and his accomplishments. At least, that&#039;s what Wikipedia told me (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidents_Day_%28United_States%29)!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In the late 1980s, advertisers began playing a role in changing the holiday title. In 1986, when Congress implemented the second federal holiday tribute to an American-born citizen, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. of Georgia, they chose a Monday on which King&#039;s birthday would occasionally fall. With neither Washington&#039;s birthdate of February 22, due to the Congressional error, nor Lincoln&#039;s birthdate of February 12, ever falling on the third Monday, the way was open to promote a generic agenda.<br /><br />Advertisers, noting the discrepancy, began to aggressively amalgamate separate Lincoln and Washington birthday sales into a longer &quot;Presidents Day&quot; sales period. The popularity of the term grew, and in the process the emphasis on Washington and his achievements began to diminish.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Oh wow, I didn&#039;t know that.&nbsp; But then again, my knowledge of history left me soon after high school.&nbsp; &nbsp;I had no idea what this holiday is for, except that I rarely have it off.&nbsp; Enjoy your day Kungfoofool!&nbsp; By the way, do you take karate or do you just like kung foo?

				I read in the New Yorker that the official holiday is Washington&#039;s Birthday but several decades ago a department store or something came up with the idea of a &quot;Presidents Day Sale&quot; and the idea caught on. Hence all the confusion over the apostrophe: Presidents? President&#039;s? Presidents&#039;? There&#039;s no official way to punctuate, because it&#039;s not an official holiday! But Washington&#039;s Birthday is, and that&#039;s what we&#039;re observing today (even though it&#039;s impossible for his actual birthday and its observance on the third Monday in February to coincide).

				Yes we used to have both Lincoln&#039;s Birthday and GW Birthday off. LB is a state holiday and GW a National. They were both observed by schools and major companies. When MLK day was signed as a Federal Holiday most companies and school districts with mandated number of school days dropped observation of the state holiday and eventually George&#039;s day morphed into President&#039;s day. Stores and advertisers pushed this as Lincolns Birthday was a big sale day with Lincoln being on a penny - many places had a buy one at regular price get a second for a penny.

				I don&#039;t technically have to work today, but I&#039;m auditing a class, which for some reason is meeting today! What&#039;s up with that? The University (NYU) is closed, I had to swipe my card to get into the building, nobody&#039;s here.... but there&#039;s a class anyway. I suspect the Prof guessed wrong about which Monday was President&#039;s Day...!<br />
