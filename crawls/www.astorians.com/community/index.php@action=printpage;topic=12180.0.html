				Hello, everyone! I am trying to figure out the cost of sending my child to a daycare in Astoria. Although some daycare centers have web sites (i.e. Les Enfants Montessori), they don&#039;t list their rates. Could you please let me know how much you pay? If you don&#039;t wish to specify the exact amount, please give a range - for example, from 900 to 1000 a month for a full-day schedule? I am trying to work on our family budget and eliminate the daycare centers that are too expensive right away; I will then start contacting the ones that are reasonably priced and well-liked. From the previous posts, I saw that everyone has their favorite. So, the neighborhood&#039;s favorites are Les Enfants Montessori, Bright Beginnings, and Kid Krazy. How about The Learning Odyssey Family Day care? <br /><br />Thank you very much for all your help!

				You&#039;ll find it ranges from about $1,200-$1,600 per month for Astoria daycares.&nbsp; Some provide meals, some don&#039;t.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had great luck with Learning Odyssey.

				And if your kid is age 4 or over, some places have universal Pre-K which means the state pays a portion of the costs (I think the state pays for 3 hours a day, or something).&nbsp;

				My first child went to les enfants but found they were a little uniform crazy- more focused on that than the actual learning. That was a few years back though so hopefully things have gotten better. My youngest is in Blossoms Montessori - it&#039;s pretty small but we are happy there - pay $900/month for 8-5, mon-fri. Figure around $1000 a month (give or take a bit) is about right. Mushroom Daycare recently opened on ditmars and steinway or 41st - my friend went, said it looked very nice.

				I can speak only about Les Enfants.&nbsp; My son was there for wto years and I thougth about leaving the entire time.&nbsp; The administrator is very difficult to dela with.&nbsp; The classes are too big (especially for the younger years) and the administrator really fights any parent involvement.&nbsp; The oyl reason we stayed the 2 years is becasue my son had a wonderful teacher, Khensee Wangmo, who now has her own daycare.&nbsp; when she left, I knew it was time to enroll in PreK!&nbsp; <br /><br />The cost of daycare, no matter where you go, usually depends in part on the age of the child.&nbsp; An infant will cost mroe than a toilet trained 4 year old.&nbsp; &nbsp; any wehre from 900-1200 I would say.<br /><br />Mrs. Wangmo has her own daycare -- it share space with Blossoms.&nbsp; Blossoms is for infants, MRs. Wangmo&#039;s Montessori-based daycare starts at age 3.&nbsp; Love her.<br /><br />We also did very well with PReK-- full day PreK with afterschool onsite at Immaculate Cnception school worked out great for us. (and affordable) My son is still there for K now.

				If my son was at an age to follow Ms Khensee when she left Les Enfants, I would have done it in a heartbeat. She is world class. His preK teacher Ms Carosuel was probably even better as a teacher, but no where near as warm.&nbsp; I agree that the administration can be a bit over bearing about things like uniform and lack of parental involvement, but I actually liked that and came to see the reasoning. Either way, it really worked and the children and teachers are wonderful. Tuition is just over $900 (depending on times) but expect extras like &quot;optional&quot; music classes and karate.

				Learning Odyssey is $400/week for infants and an extra $12/hour for outside of regular hours (I don&#039;t remember what the regular hours are - but we didn&#039;t fit in them).&nbsp; <br />I weighed $460/week + schlepping the baby to and from and needing to find alt care when he&#039;s sick <br />vs. <br />paying a sitter $12/hour to come to my home.&nbsp; <br /><br />Babysitter won out.&nbsp; And the little guy isn&#039;t even 6 months - he surely isn&#039;t in need of any sort of socializing

				bumping this since a search pulled up everything except day care threads.<br />looking for current opinions on day care in astoria, ones mentioned in this thread and new ones since this thread.<br />not looking to start him in day care until he&#039;s one which isnt until the summer, but it never hurts to check out what&#039;s available and what they cost. not to mention what to avoid (as in the day care center on steinway street who recently left a child behind at sean&#039;s place and then tried to blame it on the child for not being in line when the group was leaving)<br />Thanks!<br />

				I don&#039;t recommend Mushroom House in Ditmars Blvd. For $1,000, the food is very poor, the Director, is a neurotic mess and it&#039;s a fire hazard being the children are upstairs on the 2nd floor and no escape from there if the fire starts on the first floor.

				I worked for Mushroom House for 2 weeks and I saw many hazards. The food was coming in raw and not a meal for small children who needs vitamins. I mean, pizza and small green apples are not a great meal. Second, the director and Vice President is very neurotic, her nerves jumping all over the place and if you say something wrong, she has a bad altitude and needs to go for coffee to get away from her stuttering of words. Money is all they think about and not the safety of the children. They are herded like small cattle up the stairs to the second floor where there is no fire escape or means of exit if there is a fire on the first floor. They will roast alive! The teachers taking care of the children are frequently yelling at them in a mean manner. I hear them telling them to shut up, and the poor child starts to cry.<br />I won&#039;t recommend this place to any child and parents beware of the mask the Director, wears just to get you to give money and enroll your child. She has others do her work and frequently calls them her right and left foot as though to say, my hands are clean and I don&#039;t do any dirty work!<br />I resigned from this daycare as her Assistant and I surprised myself as to why I took a position in such a nasty enviroment as theirs. If anyone calls the New York City Dept. of Children&#039;s affairs, they will be given fines!! I promise you this!

				anyone have any opinions on les enfants? we were impressed by the site visit last year, despite their still finishing with the construction at that time. but all the online reviews are either 5 stars or no stars, which isn&#039;t particularly helpful. it&#039;s very close to us (we&#039;re by astoria park) and though i know they&#039;re not a &quot;real&quot; montessori school i&#039;m not sure at that age it matters. it was, iirc, $1000/month for three days a week.<br />
