			I have two double-hung windows, right next to each other, in the room where I spend most of my time at home. The top parts of each window have slid down and there&#039;s no putting them up again. One window has slidden about 2&quot; or 3&quot; down; the other has slidden all the way down. I am defenseless against both insects and the elements.

			You need your springs repaired.&nbsp; Pretty simple job - you can youtube it and do it yourself or call someone like All About Glass.&nbsp; Or someone at your neighborhood old fashioned hardware store could give you a recommendation - there are still a couple of these around Astoria.

			Thanks, astoria101, but I&#039;ve looked at a few of those videos and I haven&#039;t seen a one that doesn&#039;t confuse me further. I&#039;m going to have to call a handyman (brrr).
