				On June 9, Procter &amp; Gamble announced that it is recalling specific lots of Iams canned cat food as a precautionary measure. The affected products include all varieties of Iams ProActive Health canned cat and kitten food in 3- and 5.5-ounce cans and with expiration dates—printed on the bottom of the can—from 09/2011 to 06/2012. <br />Tests indicate the recalled cat food contained insufficient levels of thiamine, also known as vitamin B1. Thiamine is an essential vitamin for cats—it supports the central nervous system—and an ongoing dietary deficiency can lead to neurological problems from mild loss of balance to life-threatening seizures. Other symptoms of thiamine deficiency include lethargy, loss of appetite, vomiting, mental dullness, dilated pupils, increased respiratory rate and low body temperature.<br />The ASPCA urges all pet parents to make sure they are not feeding the recalled products to their cats, and to discard any cans with the aforementioned characteristics. If you suspect your pet may have ingested a recalled product, please contact your local veterinarian or the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center at (888) 426-4435. For information about a product refund, please call Proctor &amp; Gamble at (877) 340-8826.<br />To learn the latest news about pet food recalls, please visit the FDA online.<br /><br />http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm214996.htm

				We only give our cat organic or all natural pet food. It&#039;s more expensive but we haven&#039;t had to deal with this type of nonsense yet so i think it&#039;s work it.

				Wish I could feed my kitty Wellness, but it simply doesn&#039;t agree with her tummy and GI-tract.&nbsp; We feed her an organic food from Castor and Pollux (I get it at Fresh Start).&nbsp; She likes it, and I don&#039;t worry about pet food recalls.

				This new store sells better quality foods at competitive prices.&nbsp; Just off Ditmars.&nbsp; <br />http://www.yelp.com/biz/triple-jd-discount-pet-food-and-supplies-astoria&nbsp; <br />They sell this brand of pet food and our cat really likes it.&nbsp; Our vet felt it was an excellent choice.&nbsp; But to combine with an occasional Science Diet food since this food is strictly grain free.<br />http://www.tasteofthewildpetfood.com/&nbsp; <br />And you really can&#039;t go wrong at Whiskers down near Bistro 33.&nbsp; Years ago I would swear by Iams.&nbsp; Now I wouldn&#039;t dream of buying it.&nbsp; I think our cat was turned off by the Wellness brand texture.&nbsp; Evo is also a good choice.<br /><br />

				You know, there is also some sort of discount pet food store over on one of side streets off 36th Ave.&nbsp; Seems very similar to the triple jd one.
