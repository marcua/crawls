				How do you store your veggies to keep them fresh? Our fridge is pretty small so the &quot;Crisper&quot; isn&#039;t cutting it. By the time Monday rolls around my lettuces look wilted. What is your secret? eat them as fast as you can?

				There is a CSA book inside the cafe called &quot;veggie tip sheet&quot; or something to that effect (inside Freeze Peach) that has veggie storage tips for different veggies.<br /><br />The problem is that different veg require different techniques/have different shelf lives.&nbsp; Lettuce I eat as fast as I can but I&#039;m just finishing the last today.&nbsp; I kept it in a plastic bag (grocery bag) inside the crisper drawer.&nbsp;

				Often when I buy lettuce by the head, I prep it right away.&nbsp; Clean it and tear the leaves off (sometimes break up the leaves) and store them that way.&nbsp; Takes up a little less space.&nbsp; I find the CSA veggies don&#039;t wilt or go bad nearly as fast as the conventially grown stuff does.&nbsp; Keeping the veggies as close to the bottom of the fridge helps, too, even if they&#039;re not in the crisper.&nbsp; The paper towel technique works, too.<br /><br />Oh, and you can often &quot;refresh&quot; lettuce by plunging it into very cold water.

				My grama has a special bag made out of an old towel; she dampens that towel bag and puts the lettuce inside, that way it keeps in her fridge for a while. Just in general: if you have a drawer in your refrigerator, the fruits and vegetables keep better in those drawers rather than on the shelf.

				Summing these up a bit and seconding several of the suggestions (since I just finished prepping and storing my share from this week):&nbsp; greens and leafy things will go south the most quickly and require the most care in storage.&nbsp; Wash them <em>well</em> first (you may as well cut/tear them up and remove any stems or other parts you&#039;re not going to use when you do this), and then get them as dry as possible (salad spinner, or patted with a towel -- paper or regular).&nbsp; Store them wrapped in a paper towel or dishtowel, or in one of those terrycloth or muslin bags you can get for the purpose, and put this inside a plastic bag in your fridge, in the crisper if you can.<br /><br />For herbs, it&#039;s best not to wash them ahead of time since it accelerates their breakdown, but otherwise the same storage method is good.<br /><br />Root vegetables, zucchini, broccoli, etc. -- no need to worry much.

(trying to eat more salad and your way makes it easier to just make the salad as opposed to washing and making it at the same time...this trying to lose weight thing is killing me)
