				Am I the only one noticing this, or is lack of common courtesy on the subway trains increasing?&nbsp; I keep seeing folks taking up two seats with their legs spread so far apart it looks painful, even using their knees to prod the people trying to sit next to them.&nbsp; I saw an elderly lady standing as no one with a seat would get up despite the fact that it was the after-work rush last week.&nbsp; I thought I&#39;d seen it all until I saw a guy spit on the seat next to him to guarantee that it would stay empty.&nbsp; That was just vile.<br />Maybe it&#39;s my Southern upbringing, but shouldn&#39;t folks be standing if they see someone elderly, with a disability, a baby stroller, packages or a woman who is pregnant?&nbsp; I&#39;ve been noticing people stopping at the top of the stairs as well - making everyone behind them come to a complete stop.&nbsp; I&#39;ve seen folks stop at the bottom of stairs when they realize it&#39;s not their train making everyone behind them, whose train it was, miss the train.&nbsp; Is is just the Summer or are the subways becoming less civilized?

And your Southern upbringing may lead you to be more courteous than the average New Yorker, indeed! <br /><br />Compared to 20 years ago, when (as I understand) there were regular muggings, shootings, etc. on the subway, I should say they&#39;re still relatively civilized... What you&#39;ve seen seems to me to be exceptions, not the general rule... The guy spitting on the seat should be made to ride on the outside of the train, however, as punishment!<br />

				I saw 2 men sitting on the subway with an empty seat between them. One of them had his legs spread out and the other one had his bag in the seat. A girl was looking for a seat - they ignored her. Jerks. I wish i had a camera so I could take pictures of people littering, spitting, and being rude and post it on a &quot;subwayrudeness.com&quot; website. ARGH!

				I see it both ways. Sometimes are overly nice on the subway, and sometimes they are overly rude. A city with millions of people is bound to have a good dose of both and everything in between and beyond.

				Merm -&nbsp; You are definitely right about good manners being found in all parts of the country - lots of very polite as well!&nbsp; Sorry if my posting implied that Southerners were more polite, it&#39;s not always the case, though I think the emphasis on proper deportment in public may be more emphasized down South.&nbsp; I just see parents lately who don&#39;t discipline their kids when they&#39;re acting out, who encourage asocial behavior and all this rudeness on the subway, and I just wonder why people act this way.&nbsp; I&#39;ve seen it back down in GA as well, so I know it&#39;s nothing endemic to NYC.<br />Someone grabbing a seat from an older handicapped man, that&#39;s just wrong.<br />I&#39;m seeing people pushing into the trains before letting people get off them more often these days as well.&nbsp; It makes for a less pleasant subway experience.

				So one time on the subway, Im sitting there in a full car, a woman comes onto the train. &nbsp;Is she pregnant, is she a little overweight? &nbsp;Cant tell. &nbsp;Im guessing she is overweight and just know that if I offer her my seat and she is not pregnant Im going to seriously offend her in front of the whole car. &nbsp;So I do nothing. &nbsp;Few minutes later the woman next to me gives me a big &quot;HRMPH!&quot; gets up and gives the woman her seat. They start saying loudly how rude men are these days, wont even give up a seat to a pregnant woman. &nbsp;<br /><br />I knew I could never fully explain myself, they would never believe me. &nbsp;Just sat there in shame.

				Don&#39;t even get me started with the overall topic of etiquette and NYC.&nbsp; I have a list of ideas for an etiquette guide to living in NYC which deal with subways to umbrellas.<br /><br />The spitting, the open legs (sorry but, as I guy, I&#39;m guessing that their package is not THAT big to necessitate spreading ones legs that far!), bags on seats...One time, though I didn&#39;t even need a seat I told a woman that it was rude to leave her bag on the seat (no one wanted to ask but people were eyeing the space).&nbsp; Her response: &quot;You&#39;re obviously not from around here.&quot;&nbsp; Actually, I am.&nbsp; Before the end of the dialog she was calling me some very nasty names.&nbsp; <br /><br />That is New York.

				here&#39;s a great one. i&#39;m sitting on the R on one of the 2 seaters, i&#39;m not sitting straight ahead in it but rather to the side. When the train goes the opposite way i am facing it makes my head a little woozy. the seat next to me is empty. at the next stop this elderly man shoves is way across the train and over to the seat. i move to give him room, and when he sits, his rear takes up more than his seat. i&#39;ve got enough junk in my trunk to cover one seat (i&#39;m not at 2 yet!) so there is only so much room i can give him. I then sit up straight, b/c my back hurt from slouching, and then the old man starts to fidgit, like trying to move me over. I say politely, excuse me your kind of pushing me. He then lectures me on sitting in the seat properly and how i am not facing the right way. <br />eh? <br />so i tell him, it doesn&#39;t matter, but i would appreciate it greatly if he didn&#39;t keep pushing me. he obviously doesn&#39;t care. mind you, he chose to sit there, knowing full well i was facing the &quot;wrong way.&quot; Then he starts to dig his elbow into my back! i mean he was almost at deep tissue massage level when i had to say (not very politely this time) that he was doing that on purpose and it hurt. he didn&#39;t care and proceeded to lecture me again about properly in the seat. As if i was asking for this torture. I was trying to be nice, you know calling him sir, but damn i kind of lost it. i didn&#39;t yell but i was quite testy. and then i have these people around me looking at me like i am being this meany to an old person. <br />couldn&#39;t win.<br />still don&#39;t sit the &quot;right&quot; way in those seats either.<br />Jenn

				A lot of times I see this kind of thing happen and I just sit down. I figure &quot;hey, if this guy/girl wants to take up two seats then I guess s/he doesn&#39;t mind me sitting on their lap&quot; and I just sit right down. It&#39;s no problem, I&#39;ve never gotten any trouble for doing it. I don&#39;t think people are as rude as they are being made out to be here.<br /><br />This reminds me of when I lived next to Trade Fair on Steinway Street. The space between the aisles are so tight there that two people can only barely fit through. You can&#39;t help but bump into people as you weave down the row. Every once and a while somebody get&#39;s all fired up with all the &quot;bumping&quot; and waiting in the traffic jam and you see them standing there brooding in anger that people are so &quot;rude&quot; to bump into them etc. One lady in particular I remember went down every aisle of the store yelling &quot;EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME&quot; and then I heard her say &quot;NEW YORKERS ARE SO RUDE, DOESN&#39;T ANYONE SAY EXCUSE ME ANY MORE?!&quot;. &quot;No,&quot; I said back, &quot;in New York you are automatically excused&quot;. In other words, if we all went around saying &quot;excuse me&quot; in the grocery store and on the subway for every little bump or mistake in etiquette we&#39;d be saying it incessantly all day long. I only say &quot;excuse me&quot; if I accidently run into someone or something, but not for little bumps or traffic jams along the way. <br /><br />My point here is that I think the rule is the same on the subway; when some people sit down (and don&#39;t tell me that this is a male-dominated problem) they may just by habbit put their bags on the seat beside them, or spread their legs, or lean over into the next seat, or sit with their legs up on the next chair - but that doesn&#39;t automatically mean they are being rude. If you want to sit down, just sit down - chances are the people will scoot over (they do for me, and I&#39;m not exactly small).<br /><br />My motto is that in New York you&#39;re automatically excused (unless you really ram into someone or something). So I just make room for people without them saying &quot;excuse me&quot;, but also expect others to make room for me without my having to say anything either. I just sit down and it&#39;s never been a problem. Honestly though sometimes I forget and I sit there with my legs crossed or something (which blocks the next seat) and just forget. But when someone sits down it&#39;s no problem, I just make room.<br /><br />I&#39;m not making an excuse for people who spit on the seat or whatever, but some of these stories are just the result of some of you not realizing that it&#39;s okay to just sit down I think.<br /><br />I do find it mildly distrubing that it&#39;s expected that the males in the car will give up their seat if an elderly person, or if a woman comes into the car. That&#39;s both sexist against men and patronizing to women and elderly. I&#39;m against discrimination. If someone wants to give up their seat that&#39;s an individual thing and I personally do it on a case by case basis, but any &quot;rules&quot; that say that people &quot;should&quot; act that way are just plain unfair to all involved. I had an old guy yell at me one time for singling him out and offering him my seat. He was right, what exactly am I saying by doing that? He told me if he needs my seat he&#39;d ask for it, but didn&#39;t appreciate my making assumptions about him.

				People have strange ideas about poles - I&#39;ve seen people come right up and stand in your space. &nbsp;I hate it when people lean on your hand though, or touch your hand while you&#39;re trying to hold on. &nbsp;I guess I have a larger personal space than others, but I try to give people room when I can, unless it&#39;s like a sardine on the train in which case I try to stand still and not bump folks. &nbsp;<br />I&#39;ve seen people come and put their butts up against your face if you&#39;re seated in the end seat on both the N and the R next to the door. &nbsp;I do wonder if people are thinking when they do that, or just leaning up against the seat without thought.<br />I&#39;d love to hear the spitting on the floor story - that sounds interesting!

				The pole thing is weird. I love it when your hand has to jockey for position on the pole.&nbsp; And yes touching is always a no no.&nbsp; You can be smooshed right up against other people but no hand touching!<br /><br />Or how about people leaning papers up or down so you cant read the opposite page when you sit across from them. Hell I do that too.&nbsp; Its like they are invading your space which is silly.<br /><br />As for the spitting story, I will say it was my only physical confrontation ever.&nbsp; Guy spit between my feet after I sat down.&nbsp; Next thing I know, and it all happened so fast, he was across the car on the floor looking up at me.&nbsp; His girlfriend mumbled something but I was so hyped up I want listening.&nbsp; They stayed by the doors until the next stop and got off.&nbsp; No one on the car said a word but no one seemed upset by me or my response to his behavior. It seems that spitting is one of those things that I find beyond uncivilized and disgusting.&nbsp; I didnt even know what happened till it was over.

				The thing that always drives me crazy is the way in which people tend to crowd next to the doors rather than just moving into the car and making room for everyone. <br /><br />On the other hand, it means there is more room for me when I do finally make it to the middle of the car... ok, I take it back... keep crowding near the doors people!<br /><br />But the people who stand right in front of the door and refuse to move for people getting in or out fully deserve to be shoved out of the way.

				Oooh, Jonathan, THAT sounds exciting. I think I&#39;d buy tickets to see you rough up some kid on the subway. &nbsp;:-D<br /><br />As for me, I never stick up for myself -- wish I did but I&#39;m SO non-confrontational. I did once yell at someone who stole a cab from me. It had been a long day...<br /><br />My biggest issue with subway politeness (aside from the guys who need to sit whilst doing the splits, though this was a much more common problem in Brooklyn than I&#39;ve found in Queens) is the feet on the seat thing. AND it&#39;s illegal to do that now! I glare at people when they put their feet on the seats. No one wants to sit where your dirty shoes have been. When I first moved here, an older woman started lecturing a guy who had put his feet on the seat. It was awesome.<br /><br />Although, all in all, when you consider how many people are taking mass transit everyday, and how often we&#39;re all invading each other&#39;s personal space, it&#39;s a miracle that we don&#39;t witness more train fights/confrontations. And a miracle I don&#39;t get pissed off more often. <br /><br />OH, and Anzubird, I LOVE shoving people when they don&#39;t clear the doors. If people start getting on before everyone&#39;s gotten off, I go into bull-dozer mode.&nbsp; :evil:

				Re: giving up seats to elderly<br /><br />One time that I got up for an elderly woman with a cane, she kindly told me to keep the seat and that she was just fine standing.

				Male or female, bags on seats or spread legs - people SHOULD know better than to do this.&nbsp; It&#39;s a bigger issue - not simply rudeness...rather entitlement.&nbsp; They are entitled to have more space than you because they got there first.&nbsp; They are entitled to lean on the pole, squashing your hand, because you didn&#39;t think to lean on the pole instead.<br /><br />It is rudeness.&nbsp; People are not entitled.&nbsp; The little bumps count.&nbsp; <br /><br />People do try to a certain extent - we try to act like gas molecules - allowing for the maximum distance between oneself and the next molecule.&nbsp; But some people simple could care less that their actions/lack of action has an effect on those around them.<br /><br />Remember the herd mentality too - no one, and I mean no one, likes the unstable isotope that upsets the herd by acting out or being the lone wolf.&nbsp; It draws attention and causes tension in the other animals in the zoo that is New York City.

				I can&#39;t stand the leaners. It doesn&#39;t bother me if they just hate to sit and the train is empty, but I don&#39;t get why they insist on leaning on a pole when people are holding on everywhere. Sometimes they move if I just dig my hand underneath their back to grab the pole, and sometimes they don&#39;t. <br /><br />Obviously a lot of people who take up way more space than necessary are willing to move when someone is going to sit next to them, but they hope to encounter as many shy people as possible who would rather stand than ask them to close their legs or put their bag on their lap or the floor. It&#39;s not just the subway, it&#39;s trians, buses, and anything else that doesn&#39;t have assigned seats. They just like to be the last resort, so people will take all the other seats first; but they will usually move when asked. <br /><br />One of the sillier things I&#39;ve witnessed on the subway is this one guy on the N train who decided to strike up a conversation with me. He was like &quot;A beautiful woman for a beautiful day&quot; and I just thought &quot;here we go...&quot; So anyway, he spent the ride from Ditmars to Queensboro chatting it up with me, and he was drinking one of those orange juice pints with a straw. He went to get out of the train, and he left his orange juice on the floor. I chided him for this, and he justified it by saying he&#39;s giving the people who clean the train a reason for their job. He was completely serious. What a thoughtful guy.&nbsp; :roll:

				My favorite - of which I was reminded just now on my way to class - is when two guys (it&#39;s always guys) enter the train together and they&#39;re talking.&nbsp; There are loads of seats available, but rather than sit next to each other to continue the conversation, they sit across from each other and holler across the aisle over the noise of other people talking and over the noise of the train.&nbsp; What is that?&nbsp; I don&#39;t recall asking about the annoying woman in their office who puts her work on the other secretary&#39;s desk.<br /><br />Another fun one is when the iPod toting youths have their music cranked so loudly that you can actually identify the song that&#39;s playing from across the train regardless of the use of headphones.&nbsp; And what is up with those mini-radio-lookin&#39; things?&nbsp; So loud!!!

				Meg I love the trains too and am awed by their ability to get so many people to so many destitnations in such a relatively short period of time. We went to Coney Island yesterday and rode the N train end to end, it was only an hour and 10 minute trip. I wonder how long it would take by car in traffic?<br /><br />Also, I&#39;m not trying to be the old-timer here, but when I lived here in the 1980&#39;s the trains were so disgusting. I don&#39;t recall ever seeing someone sweep or mop, and every train/station/platform smelled like pee mixed with the b.o. of all the homeless people. It was rare to get in a car and NOT see a homeless person sleeping/passed out. And understanding the intercom announcements? Fughedaboudit (sp? LOL) I was so shocked at the difference when I came back to visit NYC in 1999. 42nd street also blew me away....it went from XXX everywhere to Disney and WWF!<br /><br />

				Has anyone ever had a bad experience from sitting down in an open seat?&nbsp; I made the mistake recently of taking an open seat next to a rather rude young man (one of a pair sitting across from each other in the far corner - the two sets of two seats).&nbsp; While I didn&#39;t slide into the seat and only used the front inch or two to sit and try to read, I got a non-stop commentary from 34th Street back to Astoria (Queensborough Plaza) about &quot;punk ass bitches&quot; (I guess that was me) and other not so nice terms.&nbsp; He wasn&#39;t a very big guy, but he definitely was aggressive and unpleasant, though we didn&#39;t get into an altercation, not even a verbal one.&nbsp; It was weird - he kept complaining about me to his friend, but we never exchanged words.&nbsp; It was late enough that no one was standing on the train, and when a seat opened up down the train, I immediately moved.&nbsp; He seemed even more offended when I moved and complained about that as well.&nbsp; It was just strange.<br /><br />What is the proper etiquette?&nbsp; If someone gives you a nasty look and seems to want to hold two seats, while only using one, should you not sit down?&nbsp; I just wanted to read and not get jostled by the train.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have always thought one should try and accommodate others on the train.&nbsp; I learned recently that this consequences.&nbsp; I slid over to the edge to make room and a woman sat next to me on the bench.&nbsp; It was tight, but it was the right thing to do.&nbsp; When the person on the other side moved though, she stayed right up, almost in my lap.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t know whether I should say something - &quot;Um, you have several inches on the other side, why not slide over...&quot; or just ignore it.&nbsp; I was surprised that she opted to stay smushed right up against me and not have more space.&nbsp; Thankfully my stop came soon and I left the train.

				I think you&#39;re right - it&#39;s probably a sense of entitlement, and a lack of manners/consideration for others.&nbsp; I never want to start a fight - you don&#39;t know if someone is unbalanced or if they have a gun or a knife, but I just couldn&#39;t believe the behavior.

				This morning a panhandler got on the N at 57th St and told his life story until I think 34th St. When he only got $1 he yelled at all of us that what goes around comes around and god is watching.<br /><br />Thing is, I&#39;ve heard him before and his story was shorter. He claims he was incarcerated for trying to defend his child against a harrassing neighbor and after getting out jail he was homeless and jobless and then his kid was taken away and he went ballistic and was jailed again. Anyway, there&#39;s a lot more, now highlighting a sister who is sick with cancer and has either already died or has only a short time left to live. <br /><br />He&#39;s SO BAD at this that I think his story is probably mostly true.&nbsp;

				Exactly. When you see the same people begging with the same story month after month, year after year, it means they&#39;re managing to get by with begging. Once I heard a man openly challenge a woman on I think the F/V by suggesting that she go to a shelter. She just kept telling her speil(sp) in louder and louder tones. And he kept talking over her about the shelter. It was crazy.

				Most subway-car panhandlers have a story that they can tell in about 2 or 3 minutes - enough time to tell the story, make the rounds through the car to get cash from anyone who gives it, and then get off the train almost immediately after. <br /><br />The story usually runs along the lines of &quot;I lost my job, my husband/wife/other died, I have nowhere to sleep tonight/nothing to eat/etc., please help.&quot;<br /><br />The guy I mentioned is unusual because his story went for 3 stops, which is not a best practice at all.

				I usually give some change to the performers if they are good, and even if they aren&#39;t too talented but they have enthusiasm, I&#39;ll still contribute. Never again the blind accordian player (earlier in this thread)! We all have a sob story, that&#39;s life, so I never give to anyone straight begging except if they are missing a limb. That may sound crude but at least I <em>know</em> they have a hardship greater than me, and whether my change helps get them a hamburger and/or a hooker, well, so be it. <br /><br />My latest favorite encounter with a train performer: Kinda early one Sunday morning we were going downtown I think to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge but anyway the trains weren&#39;t crowded. We were sitting across from the door and at Queensborough this dark-haired, kindy messy but cute girl gets in the car, looks around feverishly and jumps back to the platform as the other train pulls in and is clearly torn between the two, then barely gets back in our car before the doors close. She stands at the pole right in front of us and I was looking at her, she was about 20, very cherubic-like, and I thought &quot;I hope she&#39;s not lost&quot;. Just as the train pulled out of the station she opened her mouth and out came the most beautiful operatic melody, instantly every eye in the car was upon her. She sang almost the whole way through the tunnel and, man,what a powerful voice, you could hear her perfectly over the roar of the train. The car erupted in applause - it was fantastic! She made out pretty well, everyone in the car was giving bills including us,a (very rare) buck each. At 59th she thanked us and took a bow before getting out. I&#39;m smiling just thinking about it. I love New York City.

				I rarely if ever give to panhandlers. Usually the only time I ever give to people is if they&#39;re playing classical music. Like a violinist or something. It&#39;s not intentional. I&#39;m just thinking back over the few times I&#39;ve given and I&#39;m pretty sure they were all playing classical music - it&#39;s soothing, which I really appreciate when I&#39;m commuting! One time out in Park Slope this guy was playing the violin and it was SO lovely. And he was cute. So I gave him a buck.&nbsp; :wink:<br /><br />And I don&#39;t like giving to people ON the train. Only if they&#39;re in stations, on platforms and such. I&#39;ve got issues with people invading my space and MAKING me listen to them, you know? But if you&#39;ve just picked a spot somewhere and are playing, that&#39;s cool.

				A couple nights ago I was on one of the trains with the long gray benches, this guy and a girl sat down next to me. You know how the benches are split up into three parts and there are cracks between each one? So I was in the middle section, and the guy and the girl were in the section next to me with plenty of room. And then the guy started showing the girl something on her cell phone, and she kept shifting over to face him, and then she&#39;d shift again, and her butt kept getting closer and closer to me. On the other side of me was a very large woman and I was as close to her as I could be without touching her, so I couldn&#39;t move. <br /><br />So eventually the shifting woman&#39;s butt ended up against me, and then she shifted again and her butt was even more against me. At that point I tapped her on the shoulder and she looked at me, and I just kind of made this hand motion like &quot;Dude, stop moving into me.&quot; and then she apologized and moved back. Then she kept apologizing every few seconds.&nbsp; <br /><br />If some people started making out next to me and ended up upon me, I would do the same thing. I am very small and unintimidating, so maybe they would listen.

				The only time I&#39;ve given money to anyone panhandling on a train was when these two young kids were breakdancing on the train as it was moving.&nbsp; Not only did they not knock into anyone but they were busting backflips and handstands in the middle of the car.&nbsp; I figured they earned it.

				I had a very unusual experience this morning.&nbsp; I got on at Broadway, as usual, and at 36th Street a guy who was probably 6&#39;6&quot; got on and I moved over a bit so he had room (we were in the back corner near the conductor booth, standing as there were no seats).&nbsp; By Queensboro Plaza, he had moved over to stand next to the bench and I had a big more room and slid over to the other side of the Conductors door.&nbsp; At QBP, a guy who must have been 6&#39;9&quot; got on, and did not move over to the center of the car, but rode stooped over in the lower part of the car.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think he could raise his head even if he wanted to.&nbsp; Unfortunately, he had a big backpack and I was right about eye level with it and had no place to which I could escape.&nbsp; I spent the ride under the East River and until 57th Street when the car emptied out a bit with it hitting me repeatedly, though not as badly as it could.&nbsp; It was just a weird and strange situation.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think there was any place for him to put the bag, and the train was packed, but I don&#39;t get why he didn&#39;t move to where he could stand up.&nbsp; I&#39;d never seen anything like it and to be trapped in the low level part of the car with two guys who could barely stand up there was just odd.

				I just read this, from AMNY&#39;s Subway Tracker blog (http://weblogs.amny.com/news/local/tracker/blog/2006/12/subway_etiquette.html).&nbsp; As one who currently rides one of the most unpleasant trains during commute hours (the 7, and thank goodness that&#39;ll be over soon), it resonated well with me:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I’m the self-proclaimed King of Subway Etiquette. Here’s my four biggest issues with subway riders. These apply year-round, but are especially true during the holiday season. <br /><br />Let people off first, then you can get on. (Goes for elevators as well. What kind of idiot gets on the subway before anyone has had a chance to get off? Yet it happens all the time. When it happens to me, I push straight through the person trying to get on first until he or she gives up and backs away. The entire time I’m looking at the offender and saying semi-loudly “Let ‘em off first. Let ‘em off first. Let ‘em off first.” Offenders usually think that I am either 1.) really tough; or 2.) really crazy. (Truth: a little bit of both.) <br /><br />Bags, backpacks, work bags, big purses, etc. do NOT go on your shoulder, but on the ground between your feet on a crowded subway car. Bags on your shoulder take up a tremendous amount of space, especially considering that people are generally bigger (and fatter, like me) on top, rather than the bottom. And every time you turn with a bag or backpack slung on your shoulder, you’re hitting someone. That’s right, I’m talking to you. YOU ARE BANGING INTO ME WITH YOUR BAG. STOP IT. NOW. <br /><br />Putting your bag on the seat next to you. Or even THINKING about putting your bag on the seat next to you. Do you really think the subway car isn’t going to get crowded? And when it does and your bag is on the seat, are you saying that YOUR BAG’s comfort is more important than another HUMAN BEING’S comfort? And the look you get when you dare sit down where someone’s bag is sitting! It’s like the offender is saying “can’t you see that this is my bag’s seat? Where do expect my bag to go? On my lap? Oh no. And my bag will not stand while you sit.” Swear to God, I came about two inches away from sitting on someone’s bag before they moved it. After I sat down, I just stared at them the entire time. Cuz that’s good manners. <br /><br />For God’s sake, hold onto something. A rail. A strap. An armrest at the end of the seating section. You may think you have balance better than Tony Hawk and Bode Miller combined, but you don’t. You’re a 40-year-old, out-of-shape, one pack a day fogey and you should be holding on for dear life. You’re lucky you’re standing with the help of a railing, let alone without one. <br /><br />That’s item. The gospel according to me. I’d write more, but it’s time for my medication. <br /><br />Regards, <br />Bob Zeitlinger<br />Managing Director</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I wish more people followed Mr. Zeitlinger&#039;s rules.&nbsp; I was next to a man who felt that his bag could, and should rest on me most of the trip (the 1 hour, 20 minute commute from HELL this morning).&nbsp; He stayed on until 57th Street, when he finally left the train, but I could not escape his bag (and I was paranoid I was going to bump the poor lady next to me with my bag), so it was not the most enjoyable trip.

				Folks with bags really need to take them off on the train.&nbsp; I had a woman who seemed very nice, but incredibly oblivious move over to sit between me and her friend on the W last night.&nbsp; She was, however, wearing a big bulky backpack - which immediately was on me and in my lap.&nbsp; After a minute or two of annoyance and shock, I moved to her old seat on the other side of the train - at which point she said, &quot;Sorry.&quot;&nbsp; That&#039;s nice, but if you&#039;re wearing a big bag and you feel it hitting something, and the only thing it can be hitting is the person sitting behind you, who you don&#039;t know, why not just take the bag off and put it on the floor?&nbsp; I just don&#039;t get what folks are thinking.

				What I&#039;m about to say will, most likely, not win me any fans but, well, too bad...<br /><br />With the exception of very pregnant women or very frail looking elderly people, I rarely give up my seat.&nbsp; I spend the better part of my day on my feet and when I get on the subway all I want to do is sit down.&nbsp; My legs and feet ache and I&#039;m usually carrying a backpack filled with large science books.&nbsp; I&#039;m not being rude, if someone gets on the train who looks like they won&#039;t make it one stop without falling over I&#039;ll give up my seat, but just because I&#039;m fairly young and healthy doesn&#039;t mean that I don&#039;t need to get off my feet.&nbsp; My philosophy is, this is a city of walkers.&nbsp; If you managed to get yourself to the subway, and you&#039;re going to manage to get yourself wherever you&#039;re going when you get off, then you&#039;ll be just fine if, perchance there is no seat for you.<br /><br />Maybe not the most popular opinion, but that&#039;s the truth.

				Thanks Urrisgirl!<br /><br />I agree with Paratactical - folks with strollers should be polite and wait until the stairs are clear (then folks are also going to be more open to helping them move the stroller down the stairs - especially during rush hour!)<br /><br />I think we&#039;re all in agreement on most of the unspoken rules of giving up seats, though there seems to be some disagreement over folks with strollers.<br /><br />I have to agree I think many of the stroller set are pretty rude on sidewalks, but that&#039;s a different thread.

				I can understand giving up a seat to someone with a baby carriage (and a baby in it!) if only because you understand getting around the city with a child (or two) can be difficult and you choose to show a little compassion or make someone&#039;s day a little easier.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think it&#039;s required or expected, but guess that&#039;s why some people do it.&nbsp; Unless a person obviously is better off sitting, I don&#039;t get up unless asked.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen people give up a seat for someone going one stop.&nbsp; And to make it worse, they lose it when the person leaves and someone who was standing nearby all along jumps in without letting the original person sit again.

				Dirk is a polite saint.&nbsp; Me not so much.&nbsp; <br /><br />Last night around 11:00 I was on a crowded N/W and saw two different people sitting with their bags on the seat next to them.&nbsp; They both were visibly annoyed when someone had the audacity to ask them to move it so they could sit.&nbsp; It&#039;s fine if the train is empty on a Saturday morning but inexusable when the train is packed to the gills.<br /><br />I feel the same way about strollers.&nbsp; My thought has always been that if you are adult enough to have a kid then you should be adult enough to have some sort of general respect for those around you (easier said than done, I&#039;m sure).&nbsp; I used to always be the guy who offered to help people with their carriages up/down stairs but after one too many person not having the decency to say a simply &quot;thanks&quot; I&#039;m over it.&nbsp;

				I can definitely see that getting to the subway would be harder than getting out of the subway with a stroller. <br /><br />I think what it all really comes down to is knowing when to &quot;stay on target&quot; and when it&#039;s important to *notice* the other people around them and give them the same room and respect you&#039;d want.

				It&#039;s presumptuous to think that just because you are a certain way means you deserve someone else&#039;s seat. What if that person has had a long day on their feet, or if they have bad joints, or if they&#039;re feeling dizzy or sick? You can&#039;t tell these things by looking at them. No one should assume that just because someone&#039;s young means they&#039;re healthy or feeling great at any given time. <br /><br />Generally what I like doing is, if I&#039;m sitting between two empty seats and a couple people get on that are friends (or mother and child or something) I&#039;ll move over so they can sit next to each other. That way we&#039;re all happy. But I don&#039;t think anyone should &quot;expect&quot; a seat just because they appear one way and someone else appears another way.

				I guess I&#039;m irritated with these responses, and the point is lost on many. Yes, being a parent it tiring, but didn&#039;t you read the brochure? What makes you more tired than someone who has been on their feet all day waitressing? How do you judge who gets a seat. Give me a break already. <br /><br />Common courtesy is common courtesy. If you are older, this happens, you have lived a long life, and deserve to rest your weary bones. If you have had an accident, have a crutch, a disability, my seat is yours. You have a kid in a stroller...well...the kid is in the stroller, and you can stand with the rest of us. Peace out.

				I too am irritated by many of the responses on this thread, but so be it. If you chose to not give up your seat to a person with a carriage -fine that&#039;s your choice. But don&#039;t try to make me feel like crap- because I do feel empathetic towards parents who live in this city and try to navigate around it. <br /><br />Good luck if you have kids- I hope its as easy as you think it is.

				Wow, I&#039;m amazed at the responses in this thread.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard not to read some of this as everyone out for themselves.&nbsp; I agree with Urrisgirl, kindness and empathy towards your fellow man, especially the elderly, disabled, and obviously pregnant, can go a long way.&nbsp; It&#039;s not easy raising children, and if I&#039;m not tired, I will offer my seat to those who do look tired and in need of one.&nbsp; Half the time, I stand up most of the ride anyway, because I&#039;ve been sitting down all day at work, and my legs need to stand.<br /><br />But it&#039;s funny, the whole pregnancy thing is difficult.&nbsp; A month or two ago, this woman on the train asked me if I was pregnant, and if I&#039;d like to sit.&nbsp; I admit, I was pretty pissed.&nbsp; And I think I gave her a dirty look to boot!&nbsp; She was embarrassed and must have felt awful.&nbsp; It was a gut reaction, and I ended up have mixed feelings of being insulted, and feeling awful for being upset with her, when it was just an honest mistake.&nbsp; When I later got a seat across the train from her, she mouthed sorry, and I said it was ok.&nbsp; I do have a tummy, but I&#039;m also Latina and Italiana and curves go with the territory.&nbsp; If I do look pregnant, it can&#039;t be more than a few months!&nbsp; So perhaps seats shouldn&#039;t be offered unless the woman&#039;s tummy is out to Austrailia and is obviously mega-pregnant?

				No one is saying that parenting is easy. What people are saying is that no one should be <em>expected</em> to get up just because someone else has a kid and a stroller. If people want to get up for them, that&#039;s great. But when it gets to the point that people shoot each other dirty looks because someone is not getting up, I think that&#039;s wrong. You don&#039;t know what that person has been through or why they don&#039;t want to get up. Do they need to explain why?

				Speaking of subway etiquette, today im riding the train (N Train of course!) and some girl is continously shoving me during the trip. I think she was mad because I claimed &quot;her spot&quot; on the train, so she was being a bit passive-aggressive.&nbsp; I had &quot;the spot&quot; first and of course I never move unless someone says excuse me. Then again I dont think &quot;excuse me&quot; is in a lot of folks vocabulary.&nbsp; Mind you there was plenty of room on the train to move to another spot. After awhile I gave her the&nbsp; :x and she said sorry.&nbsp; I seriously was about to punch her in the face.&nbsp; Its so hard to contain my anger, but I also remember that several coworkers live in the area and that would be kind of embarrasing if they were somehow on the same ride and saw me put the smackdown on someone.&nbsp; &nbsp;Its ridiculous that people enter the train with some sort of entitlement. <br /><br />As far as giving up seats, it really depends on a lot of factors. Its all about observation - if someone is having any type of issue causing difficulty standing (older person thats not in good condition, disabled person, visibly/obviously pregnant woman (use good judgement to avoid offending someone that is just chunky), someone injured, someone carrying a child or a pet)&nbsp; then I offer my seat. Im on the fence with strollers. If Im sitting in an area where a stroller would comfortably fit then I would, but if im sitting near a poll or somewhere that may obstruct people from moving in or out the train then I dont. I usually stand anyway bc I have this whole thing about subway seats (thats a whole &#039;nother issue).

				When I was recovering from gallbladder surgery a couple of years ago, I was sitting in the outside seat of the two-seater when a short woman came along and asked me to move over.&nbsp; I pointed out that being nearly an Amazon, I can&#039;t really fit in there (most of my height is in my legs), happily offered to do the 90 degree thing so she could get in.&nbsp; She said that no, she had to have that seat because she had bad knees.&nbsp; At this point I retorted that I also have bad knees (two years of teaching special ed preschool with emergency lifting of tantrumming children on staircases can do that to you) and was also recovering from recent surgery, but she proceeded to escalate the argument until all I could do was stand weakly.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like arguing.<br /><br />Someone else who had overheard offered me a seat, and I was very grateful for it.<br /><br />I really wish I&#039;d pointed out to her that there are in fact seats reserved for people with disabilities, and since I had mine, she should have taken one of those, but I didn&#039;t.&nbsp; I was fairly shaken by the whole encounter, honestly.<br /><br />Whoever said you can&#039;t always see disability is right - I&#039;ve had days where I don&#039;t mind standing, and also days when I need my seat.&nbsp; That was one of them, and that woman was foul.<br /><br />Oh, and she works in my industry.&nbsp; At the time I didn&#039;t know who she was, but now I know exactly where she works.&nbsp; You never know when that kind of thing can come back around to you. <br /><br />On a better note, I was very relieved about the courtesy of N train riders when I sprained my ankle last winter.&nbsp; While I was on crutches and visibly hurt, people were quick to offer seats.&nbsp; Once I was over the crutches I was still having balance issues, and was lucky enough to get a seat most days, but one day the train was packed and since I &#039;looked&#039; normal I decided to tough it out and hang on for dear life on the way home.&nbsp; I just didn&#039;t feel right asking people to give up their seats when I was walking fairly normally and appeared perfectly healthy.<br /><br />At Fifth Ave the train did the sudden brake thing and I wasn&#039;t able to hold my weight on the injured ankle, which ended with me tumbling into a couple of people (yes, it was humiliating and yes, I apologized quickly).&nbsp; Someone overheard me laughing about it and explaining the state of my physical therapy to the coworker I was with, and offered me a seat.&nbsp; Whoever it was, thank you!&nbsp; <br /><br />It wasn&#039;t one of the people I&#039;d fallen on, either.

				Like Katie, I&#039;m kind of lucky, as I&#039;m a bigger fellow, who, by the end of my work day, typically has the &quot;2 seconds from snapping&quot; look on my face, so I don&#039;t get much in the way of sass from riders on the subway, but my top 5 complaints about riding the rails every morning are as follows:<br /><br />1) People who come to a complete halt when they reach the top of the stairs.&nbsp; I usually combat this sort of behavior with my meanest, gutteral &quot;C&#039;MON!! [insert olde tymey out of fashion term here, I love using words like toots, chief, champ, etc.]&quot;&nbsp; It usually causes people to at least get out of the way.<br /><br />2) Door blockers, especially the ones that get on, get both feet in the door and come to a complete stop.&nbsp; GET IN THE TRAIN ALREADY!!!<br /><br />3) People who play music on their cell phones aloud on the train.&nbsp; Seriously, the speaker on that thing is HORRIBLE, and whatever you&#039;re listening to is even worse, why do I have to listen to it? <br /><br />4) Litterers.&nbsp; Coming back from the Mermaid Parade in Coney Island, this woman was sitting across from me and she put this HUGE greazy bag of Nathan&#039;s garbage on the floor, it was so gross, and I&#039;ll say this as kindly as possible, this woman did not need a huge bag of Nathans.<br /><br />5) Groomers.&nbsp; The people who put on makeup, clip their nails, brush their teeth, whatever it is on the trains, it drives me up the wall.&nbsp; Can&#039;t people do that in their bathroom at home?&nbsp; The one that always baffles me are the eyeliner pencil women, who will lose an eye if the train jerks just right (the sadistic horror fan portion of my brain is always rooting for this).

				People do a lot of gross things on the subway - but I doubt they go around admitting it.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to think most folks would admit some of the things they do on the trains or platforms are wrong or at least uncouth, if it was broached with them in the right context.

				Yeah I agree with cyberia in that if it isn&#039;t infringing on anyone&#039;s personal space, then it shouldn&#039;t really matter. I don&#039;t do my make-up on the subway, but I used to last year on the LIRR, and it really does save time - and for people like me who&#039;d rather sleep that extra time, it&#039;s worth it.&nbsp; The only thing I do now that might possibly bother people is file my nails, but I do it very discreetly... again, it saves time!&nbsp; I&#039;m a bit OCD about my nails being even... and if I can get it over with on my way home from work, then I will!&nbsp; <br /><br />I guess I just don&#039;t see why someone would let something this little get to them... there are so many worse offences...

				while we are on the topic of subway etiquette.....what is it about men useing the train as a way to get dates(and I am sure it works both ways-i bet women do it too). This happens to me ALL the time on the A train....the men are usually old enought to be my father and they interupt me from reading whatever it is that I am reading to try to get my number or more annoying, when I am listening to my I-POD they will try to talk to me. Obviously, I have my I-POD on for a REASON. Of corse I ignore them like I can&#039;t hear them and they stare, till I have to get up and move. TAKE A FRIKIN HINT!

				On the 1 train on wednesday when a big ol&#039; boy came on wearing a bigger backpack and was knocking into people.&nbsp; I was so amazed by his inconsideration that I squeezed over in his direction and wacked his pack with my hand and barked at him to take it off.&nbsp; I got thank you&#039;s from all the riders in that part of the car.&nbsp; Its a nice feeling to get thanked on the train.&nbsp;

				What about smelly and.or messy food on the train?&nbsp; The other night a rider was eating a full pasta dish, just slurping away.&nbsp; I don&#039;t mind the smell of the sauce, but this one passenger looked like she was going to throw up and there really wasn&#039;t anywhere else for her to sit!&nbsp; The eater just gave her a dirty look and kept twirling her spaghetting and loudly slurping (is that the right word?) it down her throat!<br /><br />Sort of a non sequitur/OT here, but: I think this discussion and the pet peeve discussion has actually helped me tolerate rude behavior better than I did before.&nbsp; I understand I can&#039;t be the only one who finds certain activities/actions rude and I certainly can&#039;t hope to change everyone.&nbsp; I will die a very miserable man at a very young age if I let so many things irritate me, especially when it comes to the trains.<br /><br />Needed to get that off my chest.&nbsp; Whew.<br /><br />Back on OT, I also hate people who stretch their feet out into the aisle and then expect you to have to walk, jump, hop over them!<br /><br />All better!

				Regarding coffee, I can&#039;t complain. Taking the train and enjoying a cup of coffee or a frappe is one of my greatest joys. Taking that away or making it illegal is almost unamerican. I can&#039;t understand people that aren&#039;t careful about it, but people that aren&#039;t respectful of others are a problem regardless of what they are eating, drinking, spraying or speaking.

Which is why you see so many young people drinking beer through a straw in a paper bag on the street. If you carry an open container of any alcoholic beverage on the street, or any open container of anything on public transportation, you are subject to a fine. Open simple means not sealed, or it is considered unopened. If you can drink from the contents of the container, it is opened. Please bear in mind that they won&#039;t even let you take a sealed bottle of water on an airplane. IMHO, the hassle just isn&#039;t worth it!

				..definitely have to determine the kind of eye contact... see if he/she looks squeamish like &quot;oops we just made eye contact and now they think i want them&quot;... because that happens sometimes and it&#039;s soo awkward. At the same time, there&#039;ve been times when I&#039;ve made eye contact with a cute guy on the train and I try my best to show I&#039;m interested but he never comes over,... so you never know. <br /><br />As for this topic, I know this has been said before.. but as it happened to me this morning, I must re-emphasize my dislike for women with large purses, standing near the door when it starts to get crowded - and they don&#039;t even TRY to be accommodating of the new people coming into the train, they just stand still as their bag blocks some free space past them.

				I&#039;ll agree that there seems to be an increase in both intrusive behavior and attitude on the subways lately... but I suspect that might be a function of my traveling during rush hour while working 9-5 during the summer. Everything is just &quot;more&quot; when people are in a rush.<br /><br />But here&#039;s a question for you - people rarely complain about people talking to each other on the subway. They might complain about people yelling or making a scene or being idiots.. but not for talking. Why? Because everyone considers that normal. We all do that - if we&#039;re riding with a friend, we&#039;re probably going to be talking to them about something. Right? We aren&#039;t expected to sit in silence, next to each other. This isn&#039;t a funeral, it&#039;s the morning commute.<br /><br />So then, why are people annoyed when people talk, -at the SAME volume as an in person conversation-, on a cell phone? It isn&#039;t necessarily the content of the conversation that bothers the overhearer, right? It isn&#039;t really the volume..(I don&#039;t believe that people are always louder when talking into a phone, just because it&#039;s a phone. Some people do- but not ALWAYS). So what is it about watching/hearing people on the phone that is intrinsically annoying to people?<br /><br />Is it because:<br />- It&#039;s still new and we still haven&#039;t gotten used to people talking on the phone in public yet?<br />- The listener feels left out/excluded from the conversation because you can only eavesdrop on one side?<br />- It breaks the peaceful silence (in this case, the tranquility of the screeching, thumping aboveground subway with loud but incoherent announcements, occasionally screaming children and -other- people&#039;s conversations to each other in person? *grin*)<br />- Because some people have been rude about the usage of their cell phones, so now all cellphone use is presumed annoying?<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong - I&#039;m annoyed by people on their phones sometimes too:<br />- if they&#039;re being too loud for their environment, <br />- if they&#039;re talking about topics that are annoying, <br />- if they aren&#039;t paying attention and therefore run into or inconvenience people...<br /><br />But all those activities stand alone from cell phone use. It is possible to use a cell phone without being rude, just as it&#039;s possible to talk to your friend on the subway without being rude.<br /><br />I guess I&#039;m just trying to pose the question about -why- we&#039;re annoyed by particular things. Why is someone having a one-sided conversation an intrusion on your well-being if two people having a two-sided conversation aren&#039;t?

				...responding to the phone thing...good question. maybe it&#039;s jealousy. maybe they&#039;re thinking to themselves, &quot;I wish I had somebody to talk to on the phone.&quot;<br /><br />or maybe it is indeed the one-sided eavesdropping thing, and people want to formulate a judgement on both of them. maybe the person&#039;s exerting a bunch of energy into the conversation that isn&#039;t present on the train, and they&#039;re like in another universe and out of place. at least with two people, they&#039;re in the train&#039;s compact universe, and the combined energy of the two is in a way compatible with the collectively shared atmosphere. but when it&#039;s only one side of a conversation that we get, that&#039;s like...that&#039;s like...hmm. that&#039;s like somebody&#039;s body sitting right in front of you in the real world, while their brain&#039;s plugged into...umm...the...Matrix. and...you know...the plug is the...phone. sigh.<br /><br />i don&#039;t really know what the hell i just said, either. i gotta stop getting high.<br /><br />or...maybe it&#039;s a lovely girl, and she&#039;s talking all sweet to somebody on the other line, with such a sweet and lovely voice, and smiling, with an expression that betrays that she&#039;s at such peace with this person on the other line, this bastard who&#039;s worthy of envy, who&#039;s taking this lovely creature away from my universe, and...and...umm...yeah.<br /><br />nevermind.<br /><br />and Murdock, i&#039;m also anti-MANdals. but ladies, such as Daisy and Ladyli who make things look pretty on that level, open-toe away..!!

				Taking out your phone and calling someone to just talk about mundane stuff on a subway seems egotistical to me.&nbsp; You hear conversations that can obviously wait for home or a more private place, like talking about how well you did on online poker last night.&nbsp; You know the call can wait, but you had to take it out on a subway and have the convo in front of people?&nbsp; Yeah, people have conversations with people next to them, but to go through the trouble of communicating with a friend who&#039;s miles away to talk about pointless shite while a bunch of other people overhear you is stupid<br /><br />That&#039;s just me<br /><br />Also, and this isn&#039;t supposed to be anti-foreigners in anyway, but have you experienced loud talking sometimes between people who are not speaking English?&nbsp; Like, volumes way above normal?&nbsp; I&#039;ve experienced it often and I think those people who have conversations in the subway in another language feel that because no one understands them, they can speak incredibly loud.&nbsp; They fail to understand that volume has no native language

Not sure if you can get the whole article, BUT even when noise volume was the same for cell phone people and face-to-face people (controlled), conversations that were 1-sided got higher &quot;annoyance&quot; scores. So it isn&#039;t necessarily that they actually are louder, we just get more annoyed with the one-sided conversation.

				I have a subway story for you.....<br />A couple of months ago I was waiting for the 2 train uptown at times square, when a homeless man came up to me and asked me for the time... I politely told him, when all of a sudden he makes his hand into a gun and starts mock shooting me...then he turns and runs and i mean runs down the platform.....Crazy right....wait it gets better....<br />As the train pulls into the station I see that he is running back in my direction... I am thinking &quot;what the hell?&quot; I get on the train and he gets in the same cart as me but on the other side...I am seated on the opposite end next to the doors to the next car next to 5 MEN..... well he comes over to me and stands in front of me and his knuckles are all BLOODY right in my FACE, and he tells me in a very polite voice &quot; excuse me I seemed to have cut myself, do you have any tissue&quot; I was like &quot; no sorry&quot; 2 guys seated next to me move away..... Crazy man sits next to me ....... all of a sudden he completely changes and he is screaming ....you are the devil.....i will clean you I am your savior&quot; the god damn train is express and there was no where for me to go...so I stand up and he gets behind me and starts shooting me again....when fffffaaaarrrr on the other side of the train and man finally stood up and asked it there was a problem.....crazy man ran into the next car after that.....<br />crazy thing is the next day I saw him again and he was looking at me crazy on the platform ( i was standing next to a MTA employee) I had to change my routine to work cause he really freaked me out....<br />My question is???? nobody could come to my defense... this homeless man has his bloody hands in my face&nbsp; ( i am a 26 year old woman that hardly is 5feet) and not one of those men could come to my help sooner....no instead they get up and move to the other side of the car.......<br />But I love the train and I will continue to use it crazy people and all&nbsp; :lol:

				Has anyone seen the assless pant man on the N/W lately? There&#039;s a homeless guy who I&#039;ve seen on the N/W twice now -- once getting on at City Hall, another time getting on at Times Square. From the front he looks like your typical homeless guy -- dirty, disheveled, maybe a bit out of it with his big belly sticking out from under his t-shirt and over his pants. Not exactly a pretty picture, but it gets better... when he walks past, you see him from behind... you see A LOT of him from behind. Like the entire back of his pants is missing (hence the assless pants). Then he sits down. On the bench. On the train.<br /><br />Since this is a thread about subway etiquette, it&#039;s a no brainer -- obviously one should have a front AND back to one&#039;s pants before sitting on a seat in the subway. But really, I&#039;m just wondering if anyone else has noticed this guy -- I thought it was pretty odd that he keeps popping up (and I don&#039;t take the subway all that often).

				A friend and I were returning to Astoria a week or so ago and a very strange, and somewhat disheveled man sat next to him.&nbsp; I knew something was up from the smell - I don&#039;t think he&#039;d bathed in a while, but he kept staring (at my friend, not really at me) and pushing his leg up against my male friend.&nbsp; We were both very uncomfortable, but not sure if he was just nuts or&nbsp; being offensive intentionally.&nbsp; We got off two stops after he sat next to my friend, but youch - too many strange people on the trains.

				It usually depends.&nbsp; Some seats you can tell how many people will fit.&nbsp; The older trains with the obvious seats are simple to figure out, but the N trains usually fit 6 &quot;average&quot; sized people.&nbsp; By average, I mean people who aren&#039;t HUGE.&nbsp; Sometimes I get in and look at the seat and if there are 5 people, I&#039;ll find the biggest little space and say &quot;excuse me&quot; and start to sit down.&nbsp; Usually, it opens up.<br /><br />However, if 5 of those 6 people are small, it might appear as though someone else could fit, but they really couldn&#039;t comfortably and I don&#039;t bother. <br /><br />Totally depends on the situation.&nbsp; I&#039;d say the rule of thumb is, if you&#039;re not going to be more comfortable sitting than standing, don&#039;t sit.

Why would you sit in a space you can&#039;t fit in? I&#039;ve been on the outside end of the 3-seater N trains, with someone on the third seat with an empty seat in the middle. Then someone who clearly wouldn&#039;t fit in the middle sits in the middle seat. So then I&#039;m squashed against the bar with this person&#039;s ass pressing into me, and the person on the other side gets pushed out of his seat too. It can suck that the seats are so small, but if a space is too small for me I don&#039;t push people out of the way so I can sit down unless there&#039;s clearly room on the other side of them to move (or some dude has his legs spread open or something).

				I noticed something when getting off at the Broadway stop as opposed to my regular Ditmars stop. The people walking down the stairs off the Broadway platform were actually <em>walking.</em> Why is it at Ditmars, people run down those slanted, rickety steps? I&#039;ve begun a one-woman protest where I walk down those damn stairs. I&#039;m tired of the NY minute beat everywhere- after work I&#039;m ready to chill out.

				On the contrary, I am a proud New Yorker who fights for a seat just to claim the space for that pregnant lady or elderly person in need of a seat. My father taught me that doing mitzvahs is the best thing a person could do. I’m not a religious fanatic but I understand the rules and enjoy incorporating what I like into my life. The rules of New York are simple, if you get a seat on the subway, it’s yours. If you want to do some good, fight to get the seat, then give it away as you see fit. If people see you doing this, they might learn something about, what I believe to be, good edict.<br /><br />Much love.

				So I was babysitting the 11 year old girl I babysit and we had to take the 6 train somewhere in Manhattan. We were waiting on the platform. It wasn&#039;t rush hour or anything, the platform was pretty dead. A 6 train comes in and it is really empty. The doors were open and the girl I babysit was waiting behind several men to board the train after passengers got out at the stop. I was struggling with a backpack and near the wall, so there was at least 5 feet between the girl I babysit and myself. That&#039;s 5 feet of open area on the platform. <br />Well, I see this old woman, wearing a lot of fur, and she&#039;s running down the platform, passing all these open doors that she could easily board and be on the train. Instead she&#039;s running, and as she runs in between the girl I babysit and myself, she stops and freaking all out shoves the girl I babysit. I mean, two hands, intentional shove. The girl is 11, and very tiny for her age! She almost slammed her face into the platform the woman shoved so hard. There was no need for that, since it wasn&#039;t like she couldn&#039;t easily navigate the 5-6 feet of space between the girl and myself. <br />I wanted to choke that woman so much. Who does that, let alone to a little girl?

				On my train ride home tonight, I saw an interesting thing take place.&nbsp; A couple who were tourists were sitting with their friend who seemed to live in NYC.&nbsp; They were talking in muted tones, appropriate for the train, and he was going on LOUDLY, it was incredibly grating.&nbsp; I watched two groups move away from the seats behind them - the train was crowded, so when the bench opened up a second time, I moved over only to find it so incredibly annoying I moved to another car at the next step.&nbsp; <br /><br />Don&#039;t most New Yorkers try to keep their voices lower on trains?&nbsp; I&#039;ve always seen it be non-locals talking louder, unless folks are just clueless, but in this case it was the New Yorker (however long he had lived in the city).

				I almost threw down on the subway today. I&#039;m waiting at the N train at Lex coming back in from a meeting in the city. As the train pulls in, three young girls plow, almost knocking me over...(I&#039;ll mention that i&#039;m nine months pregnant only because it made it more difficult for me to retain my balance). I turned to them and reflexively yelled &quot;jesus christ&quot;...one of the girls said sorry, and as she got on the subway, whispered &quot;bitch&quot;...a friend of hers whispered &quot;she&#039;s pregnant&quot; to which the original pusher responded &quot;i don&#039;t care&quot;....so if I had cold-cocked her, would that have been wrong? It took every fiber of my being to keep myself undercontrol...(they weren&#039;t native to queens from their conversation although they got off at the ditmars stop...<br /><br />I&#039;m still upset that i contained myself.

My rationale for women whom you can&#039;t tell with is that I&#039;d rather play it safe and not offer her a seat for the following reason: I believe it is a far worse offense to imply a woman is overweight than to not offer a seat up to a pregnant lady who&#039;s not that far along. Most pregnant women will just assume that it is NY and people are generally rude, but I wouldn&#039;t want to send some woman home feeling bad about herself because a guy on the subway mistakenly thought she was preggos.&nbsp; <br />When I can tell a woman is pregnant, though, I will always offer my seat up. Same goes for elderly folks and women with babies strapped to those weird backpack slingy things. It amazes me how rude people are in that respect. <br />On that same note, I always help mothers carry strollers up and down subway stairs. It baffles me how so many people walk by and see a mother struggling like that. It takes like 30 seconds out of your day and it&#039;s not like you run into that situation that often.

				I don&#039;t help because I think it&#039;s rude to try to bust down the stairs with the rush of people walking a normal pace. When I&#039;ve been at the end of the line with&nbsp; someone who&#039;s waiting with their load until the crowd thins out, I&#039;ve helped. I just think that it&#039;s a good idea in the city to be prepared to carry your stuff yourself and to stand on the subway.

There&#039;s no need for any intentional rudeness with all the unintentional things that happen.<br /><br />I think the real thing that makes your story so bad is that the friend pointed out that you were pregnant and was (seemingly) not cool with being that rude but that the first girl didn&#039;t give two shiats. It&#039;s one thing to be rude and then go &quot;OMG, I didn&#039;t realize&quot; and another to be &quot;yeah, so?&quot;

				This guy sounds a little pathetic and maybe jealous he wsan&#039;t in one of the cliques he loves to refer to. Also, the operative word in public transportation is &quot;public&quot;...there will always be people doing rude or annoything things on the train, and it is irritating, but the least you can expect is an absence of violent or hostile behavior. I&#039;d be happy if we got that under control first and then began targeting other things. <br /><br />I still don&#039;t get why people get so irritated with the make-up unless powder is being puffed around everywhere. Spraying perfume is one thing, but what is the harm from fixing up eye shadow and lipstick. Surely there are more troublesome activities to complain about.

				I was just pointing out that everyone gets a little carried away with the complaints on the train. The one that cracked me up the most was the text messaging...who the hell cares if someone next to you is text messaging...anything taken to an extreme is inappropriate and can be encrouching on the rights of others...most people have a bag, some are too big, a lot of people talk on the phone, some have inane conversations loudly....a lot of people primp and put lipstick on, but some spray their powder and s___ all over the place...this is life etiquette, not just subway etiquette...<br /><br />some people complain about appropriate things...others get annoyed about absolutely eerything....like texting too much, which I think is the most polite way to communicate on the train...<br /><br />I keep my bag on my lap, while I text and apply new lipstick. I might even make a phone call, and I usually have a beverage. Sometimes I have the nerve to look for my keys in my bag so I can get to my car quickly...and the ipod is usually going...i wonder how many I have offended at once...and imagine my concern.

				I&#039;m going to change it up a bit and share 2 GOOD subway stories that happened yesterday.<br /><br />On the R on the way to work yesterday I started feeling wicked dizzy and warm. Start peeling off the layers and hoping someone would get off at QP-no luck in my vicinity. Starting to feel weak in the knees and hoping I can just make it through the tunnel, guaranteed a seat at Lex. I can&#039;t. I feel like my face should be ghost white since I feel so clammy and like there&#039;s no blood up there. I cave-I ask a woman if she wouldn&#039;t mind if I had her seat since I really wasn&#039;t feeling well. No problem no attitute she got her s___ and got up to stand where I was and I proceeded to sit with my head between my knees til 23rd street. I really must have looked bad, because it didn&#039;t take much for her to get up.<br />Karma rewarded her with a seat at Lex in a few minutes and I didn&#039;t pass out thus being the sick passenger gumming up the works.<br /><br />On the R train back home yesterday there was a middle seat that had a small puddle of water on it. No one decided to sit there until Lex when everyone and their mother comes in through the last door of the last car. One woman decides she&#039;ll just sit on the edge. The woman next to her takes out some tissue and wipes the seat dry for her. I thought that was super nice.<br /><br />Thought I would share to temporarily put our faith back into humanity. Until the next idiot comes along...

				quick question, and this isn&#039;t meant to be anti-cop.&nbsp; Have folks seen a LOT more cops in the stations lately, especially Union Square?&nbsp; They look like NYPD cops, but they seem to have little to no subway sense.&nbsp; I saw one officer standing RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE STAIRS down to the R/N/W/Q, blocking half the way, for no reason.&nbsp; What New Yorker would ever do that?&nbsp; Folks didn&#039;t want to shove past a cop, and a number of us missed the train with the traffic coming up - just so frustrating.

I get off at the northernmost end of the Union Square station when I go to work. At that end, in the morning, they have a table set up with a sign stating they&#039;re there to check bags and packages. I&#039;d say it&#039;s been going on for the past three weeks. For some reason, they&#039;re there only in the morning. In all the time&#039;s I&#039;ve passed them, I only once saw them check a bag - the briefcase of a young woman wearing a business suit who was pretty obviously just going to work. And she was coming OUT of the subway, not going in. My guess is they chose her so they wouldn&#039;t look as if they were &quot;profiling.&quot;<br />Rather pointless, if you ask me.

				Has anyone ever had someone who appeared really tired keep falling over on them while riding the subway?&nbsp; I did last night and it was really awkward.&nbsp; I slid over as far as I could (thankfully I was in the corner seat), but that did not have much of an impact.&nbsp; After the 10th time or so of falling over onto me, I finally got up and stood, giving up my seat.&nbsp; At this point, the guy, now appearing wide awake, slid over into my corner seat and was awake for the next few stops until we got off.&nbsp; What the heck?!&nbsp; Do people really scam you like this to get your seat?&nbsp; I wonder if my getting up woke him up, but I don&#039;t think it did.

				I once pulled an all-nighter at work, and didn&#039;t manage to leave to head home until around 4pm the following day.&nbsp; This was back when there was no such thing as &quot;office casual&quot;, so I was in a suit with a briefcase.&nbsp; I caught the early rush home, so the car was moderately full - although I got a seat.&nbsp; Somewhere after QBP, I simply fell sound asleep from sheer fatigue.&nbsp; When the train pulled into Ditmars, a woman gently shook me awake, and I found myself with my head resting on her shoulder - without another soul in the car.&nbsp; When I had fallen asleep, I apparently leaned against her.&nbsp; Instead of waking me or jumping up, she let me rest there, and didn&#039;t even move when other seats opened up.<br /><br />Very different scenario to yours, mcdirk, and I don&#039;t recommend falling asleep on the subway, of course, but I&#039;ll never forget that woman&#039;s kindness.

				Beyond the pushing into the trains and the lack of general courtesy, I think the worst is when people think the train is their time for personal grooming.<br /><br />I can not count how many times I have seen people pull out the fingernail clippers and clip away with nails flying everywhere. I&#039;ve even seen people flossing their teeth and then drop the floss on the floor of the train or leave it on the seat. <br /><br />It boggles my mind that people are so lacking in basic etiquette that they think it is okay to floss and clip their nails on public transportation, not to mention leaving the behind their trash...

The first and probably the toughest issue is determining whether or not the woman is actually pregnant. If she is late in her term it is usually pretty obvious, but there are definite grey areas. I for one wouldn&#039;t want to offend someone in that regard. I certainly wouldn&#039;t say something to others to get them to give up their seat. It might be inconsiderate but quite frankly if they are that inconsiderate I doubt they would get up anyway.<br /><br />In the end, to me it doesn&#039;t effect me all that much. I very rarely get a seat on my commuting route and when there are empty seats I stand 99% of the time anyway since it is better for you.

				I agree that it can be tough if you&#039;re not 100% positive if a woman is pregnant.&nbsp; I think a lot of times people don&#039;t get up because they&#039;re not paying attention.&nbsp; If I was standing and saw that no one was getting up for a pregnant woman, I might inconspicuously nudge a seated guy and give a head nod in the direction of the pregnant woman.&nbsp; Then they get to look like a gentleman and all is good.&nbsp; If they see the pregnant woman and don&#039;t get up, then I&#039;d shout, &quot;you stupid piece of crap!

				I&#039;ve said it on here before, and I&#039;ll say it again: I&#039;d rather offend a pregnant woman by not offering her a seat then offend a non-pregnant woman by calling her pregnant. I always offer blatantly pregnant women my seat when I can, but when it&#039;s a close call, I&#039;ll refrain from accidentally mistaking a woman from pregnant. <br />Sometimes a tactic that works is offering up the seat, and then when she asks you why, just give her the &quot;You just had that &#039;it&#039;s been a long day&#039; look on your face and looked like you needed a seat&quot; and a smile.

				I&#039;ve often been offered a seat and it never occured to me that anyone might think I was pregnant. I figured they were just very gentlemanly, or I looked tired, or I was weighted down with packages. Even after i realized they might think I was pregnant, I just smiled and told them no thanks if I didn&#039;t really need to sit. Being offended over that doesn&#039;t make sense, and being gracious about it just means they will be more likely to give up their seats again, maybe to someone who really does need it. <br /><br />But the other night I was on the train, sitting down, all wrapped up in my book, and it wasn&#039;t until I got off the train that I realized a pregnant woman had been standing up the whole time. I didn&#039;t mean to be rude, I just didn&#039;t see her. I think that&#039;s often the case.

				This isn&#039;t about the train, but has something to do with giving up seats.&nbsp; I was on the bus today in Manhattan and there were probably 10-12 other people on the bus.&nbsp; All of the forward facing seats were taken on the lower level.&nbsp; No-one was sitting in the front section.&nbsp; This older lady got on and asked this guy in one of the single forward-facing seats to get up so she could sit there.&nbsp; He kindly mentioned that there were seats available up front.&nbsp; She basically said, &quot;No, I don&#039;t I like those seats, I want to sit here. Please move.&quot;&nbsp; It just baffles me that some people can be that picky and rude about it.&nbsp; We were in the 70s and she then yelled out to the bus driver that she was getting off at 18th street.&nbsp; Hello?!&nbsp; UGH!!&nbsp; That just totally pissed me off.&nbsp; I don&#039;t normally get too frustrated with other people&#039;s etiquette or lack of, when on public transportation, but this just got to me.&nbsp; What do you guys think about this situation?

				Another pregnant on the train story...today I was sitting absorbed in a newspaper article on the W still in Astoria when a woman in her 60&#039;s or so taps the shoulder of the woman next to me and asks her to give up her seat for a pregnant woman standing. I then witnessed one of the most nasty, vile exchanges I&#039;ve seen in a long time. The woman sitting was with her boyfriend (or husband) and first the boyfriend says &quot;she&#039;s pregnant too&quot; which she wasn&#039;t and then his girlfriend yells over and over &quot;I am going to f-- with you.&quot; The boyfriend even said &quot;you chose to be pregnant, you messed around.&quot;&nbsp; I realize it was stupid thing for the older woman to ask a stranger to give up her seat, but I couldn&#039;t believe their response. Low class idiots...the boyfriend could have stood up for the pregnant woman. Someone on the other side of the train did get up and give the pregnant woman a seat. I was about to give up my seat but didn&#039;t want to get involved. I rode public transit for twenty years on the West Coast and I don&#039;t think that would happen there.

				Sure, it&#039;s sexist, but it&#039;s a pretty common attitude in my parent&#039;s generation (not assuming anything about the poster&#039;s age here), and I&#039;ve never wanted to be one of those feminists who get pissed off when a man holds the door for me. I just smile, say thanks, and when I&#039;m first through the door I&#039;ll hold it for whoever is behind me. <br /><br />Our whole society is so interwoven with sexism, it&#039;s kind of hard for any one of us, no matter how aware we are, to be completely untainted by it. And to me this seems one of the less virulent forms. It&#039;s not as if it&#039;s a new and dangerous trend, and pretty soon if we aren&#039;t careful men will be standing up and letting women sit on the subway like mad. It&#039;s very much on its way out. This seems sweet and old-fashioned, like something my grandpa would have done, and something I would smile at even if I also see the sexist aspect of it. <br /><br />As casicua says, a sexism that is not misogynistic may be a step in the right direction :)

				So is the consensus that only negative behaviors (discrimination) are considered sexist?<br /><br />Not to say that getting up to give a woman your seat, or hold the door open, help her carry luggage up the stairs etc is not a nice thing to do or that you aren&#039;t being a gentleman or chivalrous, but choosing your actions based on the gender of the other person involved to me implies sexism.

				At the risk of sounding like a 25 year old sexist dinosaur, why is it a problem to treat women differently if it&#039;s in a good way? I know that there is the underlying sexism of &quot;oh, men think they&#039;re just bigger, stronger and better all the time&quot; within those actions, but that isn&#039;t always the case. Yes, I treat women differently, I am generally more pleasant to women and I am more willing to help women than men. If that makes me a sexist, then I&#039;ll gladly wear that badge.<br />Watch an old-timey movie, and look at how guys used to treat women. I know there was all sorts of tacit and blatant sexism back then, but we have culturally evolved enough at least to recognize the bad from the good. I know it&#039;s easy getting caught up in gender equality these days, but let&#039;s not forget the good things we&#039;re letting go and overlooking in the process. <br />If I hold the door for you, and you&#039;re thinking in your head that I&#039;m a sexist for it, please let me know so I can keep a look out for you and maybe you can open the door for me next time &nbsp;:-)

				A man on the subway once asked everyone within a two-foot radius for a tissue to give me when I had a contact lens malfunction and my right eye streamed like a leaky faucet. I was too embarrassed to ask around myself, so I was extremely grateful to him. The fact that he noticed I was suffering was pretty amazing, since most folks on the subway seem to go out of their way to not notice the people around them (like I do). I don&#039;t think he did it because I&#039;m a woman; I think he was just a plain ole nice guy. It seems a shame to be suspicious of other people&#039;s random acts of selflessness. <br /><br />Same kind of deal on the airplane, on my way back to NY from CA. As soon as that seatbelt sign is turned off, everyone jumps and grabs their crap out of the overhead bins. My bag was small and not heavy, easily accessible and I was in no one&#039;s way to get it. However, the gentleman in my row asked if he could get it for me. Could be because I&#039;m 5&#039;4&quot; and he was 6&quot; plus and he figured it was just easier for him ... could be because I&#039;m a woman, or he figured out I was depressed being back in NY, I don&#039;t know, but it warmed my heart a bit. It was just a nice thing for him to do ... I thought. <br /><br />I dig chivalry. Makes me feel a little special when I&#039;m so used to feeling very much the opposite. A door opened for me or a seat given up to me by a man because I&#039;m a woman actually kind of makes my day. Maybe I need to lay off the Austen.<br /><br />All that said, I don&#039;t think (and I believe I have stated this before) anyone should feel obligated to relinquish a seat on the subway (or open a door, or let a woman go into the building first, etc). Sure, it&#039;s nice, but the first-come-first-served adage applies to the train. In my opinion, humble though it may be.

				I&#039;d rather accept kindness without worrying too much about motives (unless it&#039;s something like $10K jewelry), and offer kindness in return. If the same guy who opened the door for me was offended when I opened the door for him, THEN I might think his motives were off. But so far that hasn&#039;t been an issue. <br />

				Wow, a fight over pole hogging<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen a cat fight on an E train before, there were a lot of hair pulling, and none of the guys around were able to pull them apart.<br /><br />But Pole hoggers annoy me the most in the subway, sometimes I do want to slap them like the lady did...my only drawback was law suit.

				Wow - sounds intense, but scary.<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen a lot more people standing over the edges of seats lately - with body mass or limbs starting to make contact with the person at the end of the bench, maybe I&#039;ve just been noticing it more lately.&nbsp; If I can, I always sit at the end of the bench and try to be flush against the end, making more room for others, but when someone comes and stands right next to you, it can get a bit too personal, especially if they stink.&nbsp; That was my problem this morning, the garlic odor was just over-whelming.&nbsp; I finally gave up the seat and moved to get away.

				I need a ruling on this.&nbsp; &nbsp;What about women who put their face on while riding on the subway.&nbsp; &nbsp;I sat next to a woman on Sunday who literally was putting her face on as I was sitting next to her.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is about the third time I&#039;ve had a close encounter of the worst kind this way.&nbsp; &nbsp;They seem to need a lot of room to maneuver the makeup, eyebrow pencil, lipstick and the little pocket mirror they carry to check it out.&nbsp; It seems to take them quite a while to do it.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is not something you can do between a subway stop or three.&nbsp; &nbsp;They can spend their whole time doing it.&nbsp; &nbsp;This woman eyeballed when I sat next to her like I was encroaching on her space.<br /><br />So it is kosher for women to pain their faces on their morning subway ride?&nbsp; &nbsp;I say let them get up a little earlier and do it at home.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Oh Chris you opened up the vault!&nbsp; :-D<br /><br />Way back in this thread somewhere there is a big debate on whether this is kosher or not. I was in the camp of people that thought it was kind of rude to apply a full face of making on the train. A little lipstick or powder no problem- but a full face- a little much. Some agreed with me others didn&#039;t.

				One time there was a woman sitting across from me who got on at Ditmars, and she was a plain looking but attractive person. Within the next 15 minutes, she looked completely different with all the makeup she was putting on. I tried not to stare at her, but I was fascinated by this process because it was so elaborate and there was such a huge transformation. There were products I&#039;ve never even thought of using, like 4 different foundations and concealers, and I was amazed she was using this all on the subway. Generally, I&#039;m not bothered by people who put on their makeup as long as they stay in their own space, but I for one would not put eye makeup on while on any sort of moving vehicle.

				Re the makeup and stuff - mostly it doesn&#039;t bother me, though I may form some sort of prejudice about the person doing it.&nbsp; The one thing that does give me the willies is watching someone apply mascara or tweeze their eyelashes on a moving train. I suppose the number of actual injuries from this is right up there with deaths from running with scissors, but still.. eeech.

				This could be like a nice little intro for tourists to N.Y. What not to do in the subway. Hysterical. DO IT! Also catch the yelling and screaming people shoving each other into the trains. This is way I don&#039;t go to work on a &quot;regular&quot; schedule anymore, come in really early or later and leave before the madness ensues. It makes my whole subway experience that much saner.

				I&#039;ve given up on sitting in the seats on the subway all together - no matter how tired I am. <br /><br />In fact, from reading this thread - I&#039;ve actually grown in the sense of what people are bothered by. I&#039;ve switched from big headphones to earbuds to avoid disturbing people. Anytime I&#039;m leaning or standing near the door I always exit in the way of incomers/outgoers. I try to keep space and respect privacy (though I cringe not glancing at the newspaper being read LOL) b/c I&#039;ve decided to not carry them anymore because I&#039;m standing up. <br /><br />I&#039;ve also noticed this is an A+++ with the ladies, I&#039;ve gotten a couple of smiles.

				But really, does anyone react gracefully to being admonished in public by a stranger? It&#039;s something that inevitably evokes an emotional response. One may feel wronged and indignant, or feel guilty and humiliated. It&#039;s not likely one will be sanguine, and even less likely, grateful.<br /><br />If indeed you were &quot;less than polite&quot;, the person may have concluded that you are of no better class than she is. Hence, race must be the issue.&nbsp; It&#039;s probably immaterial - I don&#039;t think Americans consider their class to be inferior to any other. Most individuals calibrate their sense of what&#039;s appropriate to place themselves squarely in the center of a spectrum, with uncouth asses in one direction, and priggish asses in the other.<br />

				Some people really do seem to think that paying money for something allows them to use it in any way they wish, including public transportation. <br /><br />Once I was on a Greyhound bus and some girl got in a very loud argument with her boyfriend on her cell phone. This was at night, so people were trying to sleep. People were telling her to shut up and she would just yell back at them, and finally the driver requested that she get off her phone and she wouldn&#039;t even listen to him, because of course she bought a ticket just like everybody else. I love how other people become &quot;entitled&quot; just because they don&#039;t wish to hear someone scream at somebody while they&#039;re riding a train or a bus; it&#039;s never the yelling people that have that sense of entitlement, of course. And yes, some people love to play the race card as soon as a white person tries to either admonish them in public or fire them from a job. In conclusion, people are nuts. <br /><br />Billz, I don&#039;t think you were necessarily in the wrong for less than politely shushing her, but if I were you I wouldn&#039;t have said anything because her reaction was fairly predictable. Anyone who would freak out like that on the train because someone bumped into them isn&#039;t about to be told by anyone else to be quiet.

				Thanks, everyone, for your insights.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve been thinking it over, and I have determined that although it does not excuse the behavior of the subway loudmouth, I was at very least, silly to offer my two cents.&nbsp; First of all, it lowered me to the level of the subway loudmouth.&nbsp; Second of all, I should have expected her reaction.&nbsp; Perhaps on some level, I was anticipating her reaction and looking forward to it, given that I was in such a bad mood.&nbsp; And that&#039;s pretty nutso on my part.<br /><br />I&#039;m still dumbfounded by the racial thing.&nbsp; You&#039;d have to feel pretty alienated from polite society to see not making a huge scene on the subway, or being annoyed by such as scene as a &quot;white&quot; thing.

				One time in Boston two women were arguing loudly on the subway. They were being really really rude, especially because it was everyone&#039;s 8am commute. I took out a notebook and marker and wrote in big letters &quot;I will pay anyone $5 if they shut them up&quot;. People in the train started to laugh and snicker. The women arguing thought they were being laughed at and after glancing around a bit and glaring at people, they did quiet down. I think pointing out to someone that they&#039;re embarrassing themselves sometimes works. You just must posses finesse.

				I had an all time low experience today. <br /><br />There was a guy who I assume was really drunk - it was noon. Thankfully he was passed out for most of the ride, but he would wake up every other station or so and spit. Not pick up his head and look where he was spitting, but just spit. It would land anywhere from between his feet to across the subway car from him. At one point he did wake up and pick up a bag from between his legs and drink beer out of it, and then hocked the biggest wad of all across the car.<br /><br />When I got off the train the conductor was in the next car back, so I told her about the guy spitting and she was going to get some one to come &#039;investigate&#039;. Don&#039;t know if anything happened b/c I had gotten off to transfer to another line, but good lord! Do people really think this kind of behavior is okay?

				I had a rather unusual experience on my way home tonight, which I found uncomfortable.&nbsp; I got a seat next to the middle rail in one of the cars on the N.&nbsp; I leaned forward as the woman to my left was really close to me and wanted to make room, but by 49th Street (I got on at 14th Street - Union Square), the middle of the train began to get a bit crowded.&nbsp; A woman walked up the pole, looked at me and stood so close to my face, that I was in shock.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t think she was coming on to me or anything, but it was really odd - who would stand so close to someone that your crotch was basically in their face, especially when there is room all around you?&nbsp; I was taken aback and pulled back into my seat as far was I could.&nbsp; <br /><br />Is this ever normal behavior?&nbsp; Just obliviousness?&nbsp; Is it a type of flirting?&nbsp; (It seemed really strange to me).&nbsp; I suspect it&#039;s just differences in personal space, but how uncomfortable.&nbsp;

				I&#039;d call it obliviousness. Sometimes I&#039;m sitting on the seat next to the door, and people either hug the bar or lean their ass against it, therefore being in my face. I don&#039;t think they realize how close they are, since it&#039;s not their face down there.

				I had a close encounter of the worst kind on Saturday.&nbsp; &nbsp;I got on at 30th Avenue in the second to last car, which was surprisingly empty.&nbsp; &nbsp;I soon knew -- or smelled -- why.&nbsp; &nbsp;Yup.&nbsp; &nbsp;A sleeping stinky passenger.&nbsp; &nbsp;And since I was taking the train all the way to Prince Street I wanted to read.&nbsp; &nbsp;And when you get the stinky passenger phenomenon the two adjacent cars are overcrowded and I didn&#039;t want to stand.&nbsp; &nbsp;So I grinned and beared the stench and it was hilarious at each stop as people got on, starting sniffing and then would exit at the next stop to get in another car.&nbsp; &nbsp; The happened all the way to Prince Street.&nbsp; &nbsp; I did have a headache from the stench by the time I arrived at Prince Street, but did get a lot of reading in.

				I was walking w/my girlfriend thru the 42nd St station last weekend, transferring to the E train.&nbsp; Some woman, who seemed to be in quite a hurry to get somewhere, walked at full bore towards the two of us.&nbsp; She went to move to her left to get around us, but saw that there was a bench in the way, so she stutter-stepped, spun around, and went to her left - something you&#039;d expect to see out of Randy Moss on a football field.&nbsp; It was impressive.&nbsp; Anywho, at this point, my GF and I had stopped moving completely, unaware of what this woman was going to do next.&nbsp; As she completed her maneuver by walking/brushing by us, I commented &quot;Nice dip move&quot;.&nbsp; I guess she didn&#039;t like my compliment, because about two seconds later I hear, &quot;B!TCH! OH, TWO BITCHES!!!&quot;&nbsp; I turn around and look at her, wondering if this outburst had been directed at us.&nbsp; It was.&nbsp; She made it clear by following her previous comment up with a &quot;WHITE TRASH!!!&quot; while staring at me.&nbsp; I threw up my hands in confusion and started to laugh.&nbsp; She got back to being in a hurry and left, and my gf and I kept walking... and you know what?&nbsp; I thought we both looked really nice that day.<br /><br />And no, she wasn&#039;t white.&nbsp; However she seemed to be very unhinged.

				Do folks say anything when someone is oblivious enough to stop and just stand there at the top of stairs inside MTA stations?&nbsp; With so many places to stand, why do some folks think that the top of stairs is just a wonderful place to stand?&nbsp; Why would people want to go down or up stairs to get to incoming trains or make connections?

				&nbsp; The most disgusting experience that I&#039;ve had on a subway train since I&#039;ve been living in NYC is a strange case of public urination.<br />&nbsp; I was returning from Far Rockaway on the A train one afternoon and a homeless man entered the car.&nbsp; He dropped his pants, yanked out his willy, and proceeded to spray the two double seats at the back end of the car by the rear door.&nbsp; When he was finished, he pulled up his pants, and quietly took a seat in his own mess.&nbsp; The train pulled into the next station (Broad Channel) and he exited the car a happy and relieved man. I guess that he was just really pissed off at the recent MTA fare increase. :|<br /><br />-=: Astoristani :=-

				Horrifying.&nbsp; Why can&#039;t folks go into restaurants or bars or at least find some place less problematic than urinating in MTA facilities (and not in their few bathrooms).&nbsp; I saw a mother have her son pee at the end of the Broadway platform this weekend.&nbsp; I was shocked - there are so many places right around the entrances to the station, why not just have him go before taking him into the platform?&nbsp; To encourage your child to pee on the platform on the garbage can at the end of the platform is just wrong, though not nearly as bad as pissing on seats inside a train.

				Long time ago, i had a situation on train, guy comes on, big, fat, and goofy, talking to self, and trying to talk to people. Not dangerous, but people were a little tense.&nbsp; A seat opens up next to your&#039;s truly, and he sits and starts asking funy questions. I answer one or two, ignore a few. Everyone is looking straight ahead, trying to turn invisable, as New Yorkers do on trains and elevators when they are uncomfortable.&nbsp; &nbsp;I finally asked&nbsp; guy &quot;8 million people in New York, how the f___ did you find me?&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; People all started laughing, and goofy was smiling,&nbsp; He said he didn&#039;t know and just smiled. He was harmless though.<br /><br /><br />Another time, N train coming out of Lexington toward Queensboro Palza, crowded. Guy starts talking:&nbsp; &quot; I shoot the motherfucker, in the head, I shoot the motherfucker, in the head, I&#039;ll do it now, cut open his brain, cut&nbsp; the bullet out, put it back in my gun right now and shoot him again....&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was fun too.

				After staying over at my boyfriend&#039;s apartment last night, we had the fun of commuting back to Astoria in the morning to get to church services at Trinity Lutheran (31st Avenue at 37th Street - it was Christ the King Sunday and I wasn&#039;t about to miss it).<br /><br />We got on the train at 14th Street and 8th Avenue, the A line headed up to 42nd Street where we were going to transfer to the 7 (such joy all this track work - I hope they&#039;re really doing track work).<br /><br />We had the weirdest experience, really quite disconcerting.&nbsp; We were sitting together talking and at one point held hands while making our plans for the rest of the day - nothing big, not even kissing or anything like that, but it set off a woman sitting across from us (I am not sure if she was homeless or coming/going from an airport - she looked unkempt but the bags could be from traveling). <br /><br />After glaring at us, which happens - I get it, I&#039;m gay, you don&#039;t like gay people, glare away, she started singing.&nbsp; At first I figure she&#039;s just another subway preacher and she&#039;s singing &quot;The Solid Rock&quot;, which is one of my favorite songs and her voice isn&#039;t half bad, so I just keep talking and ignore her, like most people on the train are doing (amazing how we New Yorkers can ignore strange behavior, isn&#039;t it?), but then she starts in on the gay nonsense and all this talk about s___, and how can you f___ where there is s___ (um, no offense, but heterosexual folks also do that).&nbsp; She went on and on quoting scripture and yelling for a good 15 minutes as the train went slowly to 42nd Street.&nbsp; Two folks told her to shut up, but we just ignored her.&nbsp; <br /><br />The funny thing is that she was clearly not going to church (though maybe she&#039;s of a denomination that meets on another day or time) and we were on our way to church - somewhat funny and ironic.<br /><br />I do wonder what the best approach in these kind of situations is - confront a crazy person, talk back or just ignore the offensive and rude behavior?&nbsp;

				Take classes at New York Sports Club -- various locations, they have a pretty healthy schedule of classes/instructors, most of which provide a great workout.&nbsp; They don&#039;t allow sparring, which I&#039;ll sometimes do at Kingsway, which is on 28th and 5th in Manhattan.&nbsp; (Can&#039;t afford both gyms, so I&#039;ll pay visitor fees at Kingsway through my instructor at NYSC.)<br /><br />Realized after the fact how nutty my description sounded without details -- this incident happened on a very dark side street about 10 pm on a Monday night, no one else around, sound of a man&#039;s footsteps rapidly approaching (I&#039;m a fast walker), expecting him to pass me on the left as there was plenty of space, but quickly realized someone was walking behind me, less than a foot away, a few beats too long.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t pause to look back or wonder who it was -- just did my thing, and it turned out to be an early 20ish guy lost in iPodland.&nbsp; Not sure if he was trying to be a wise-ass or spaced out, but you don&#039;t put your body that close to someone in a situation like that, unless you&#039;re up to no good, stoned, wildly unattentive or all or the above.

It&#039;s completely underground, thus warmer. I wish they&#039;d all stay in one car together rather then spread out, but I feel very sorry for them. 3 or 4 days a week I have food in my bag (I get it from the local sandwich shop at closing time) so I&#039;m prepared if someone comes along and asks for money. <br /><br />There is a circle of hell below the NYC Subway though - Ride it sometime and you&#039;ll appreciate the cleanliness of our subway again!<br />Ride the N/W/R to 34th st and transfer to the PATH train to Newark, Hoboken or Journal Square. Egads, is it filthy. Even before you enter the PATH you&#039;ll notice the change in the tunnel down from the subway. The floor is clean until right where the subway ends and the PATH starts!

				A few months ago, my wife and I took a trip to Buenos Aires. At the time her pregnancy was just barely starting to show, and - no matter how crowded a subway train was - every man (in a seat) that we stood near would offer her the seat. Little stickers on the train windows revealed that offering seats to pregnant women was mandatory by law, but I believe there is a cultural pride and courtesy too around pregnant women there. Men were offended if my wife didn&#039;t take the seat they offered; quite a few times they stood and left the seat empty rather than be seen sitting beside a standing pregnant woman. <br /><br />Of course now back in NYC, with my wife is entering her 9th month of pregnancy, it is rare when she is offered a seat. I think I may petition the MTA to put up some of those stickers from the B.A. Metro! ;)

				Now, are you embellishing your story to create a starker contrast between Buenos Aires and New York, or does your wife really never get offered a seat.

				BronwynBurke sorry to hear there was nobody on the train who was observant or considerate enough to give you a seat. I would have; I always give my seat to a pregnant woman, elderly, people with canes, or just somebody who looks like they need to have a seat.

You are awesome; you are a kind person who was raised well and I thank you for your genuine response. The fact is, many (most?) are at least somewhat considerate; it&#039;s just the other large minority who can be very uncaring and selfish.

				If you need a seat, I think you should ask. It&#039;s that simple. You can&#039;t expect people to read your minds or assume by the way you look that you need one or even pay attention to notice. There have been plenty of times where I have offered or seen people offer a seat to someone who didn&#039;t take it because they didn&#039;t want to sit down. If I need someone to scoot over a little so I can sit down, I ask. With a smile, of course. I don&#039;t know why people find this so difficult to speak up for themselves.

				A man on the subway offered me a seat today (I said no)... hope he didn&#039;t think I was pregnant! Maybe just someone being polite...&nbsp; I also saw someone immediately give up their seat yesterday to a very pregnant woman.&nbsp; So, some people are still considerate:)

				An interesting story that probably hasn&#039;t happened to too many of you. Last week I get on the almost empty last car of the Jamaica bound E at Roosevelt and the smell of bums hits me right in the nose - nothing unusual I say to myself and I try to take a seat that&#039;s rather far from them. Problem is that they&#039;re right in the middle of the car so sitting or standing very far is somewhat impossible. What happened next was that one of the bum takes some stinking cigarette from behind his ear and lights it up. So what are my options at this point: to spend 6 minutes in a smelly and smoky train, to do something illegal and possibly dangerous by moving to the other car or to risk getting assaulted by two smelly old guys. I decided that there were at least a couple of guys who weren&#039;t happy with them either and would&#039;ve stood up for me if something happened so I took my headphones out of my ears and said with a big smile and my thick accent (completely natural): &quot;Do you mind putting it out?&quot; He did, I said: &quot;Thank you&quot; and that was it.<br /><br />So what was my point? First, people do a lot of inappropriate things in NYC Transit but smoking isn&#039;t usually one of them. Second, if you want something to happen, you have to speak up. If I&#039;d kept my mouth shut the guy could&#039;ve lit a second one after the finished the first. Of course, beware of your surroundings and don&#039;t tell a group of 15 loud high-school kids to shut up. Best you&#039;re going to get away with is even more shouting.

				I got treated to a &quot;performance&quot; tonight on the N ride home.&nbsp; Some man ranting about someone not sitting next to him.&nbsp; It was unclear whether what he was going on about, but clear that he felt gay men should not hang out with straight women as it keeps him from having sex with them - that&#039;s all I got out of three train stations worth of ranting.&nbsp; What a nut.&nbsp; It certainly seems like there are more unusual folks out there lately.

You gotta assume in situations like that that the lady is crazy as soon as she sits down. You knew this before you said anything because she squeezed into a space that was too big for her along with a big, heavy bag that she hit you with. Clearly your comfort was not a concern of hers, and the fact that you spoke up was an affront to her. If you must protest in situations like that, I find it&#039;s best to do so in a way that appears oblivious. <br /><br />A few days ago, I was on a rush hour R train and there was a dude leaning against the one pole I could get to. Now, there was a slight gap between one section of his back and the pole that I could grab onto, but unfortunately he was wearing a big messenger bag with the strap running down the full length of the pole. Instead of asking this guy to hold onto the pole properly, or asking him to move his bag so I could hold onto the pole without his strap pressing against my hand, I held onto the strap and the pole at the same time. This meant that if he swayed at all, he would get pulled back because I was essentially holding on to his bag. He glanced over at me a couple times when this happened, but I just stared blankly. He apparently wasn&#039;t bothered enough to move, or he realized that he was being a dick for standing like that in the first place and he didn&#039;t want to move regardless, but for me the aggravation turned into vague amusement on my way to work.<br /><br />As for how this strategy would apply to your scenario.. I dunno, I probably would&#039;ve found a way to disgust her without making it look like I was doing it on purpose. I liked Yaxpac&#039;s idea of the involuntary spasm. Sometimes the only way to fend off crazy people is to out-crazy them.

				So i was sitting on a packed train the other day in one of the seats designated for the disabled when I heard someone say &quot;Excuse Me&quot; and so I looked up.&nbsp; There was a man who was probably in his 50s standing over the seat and when he got my attention he calmly and quietly said - &quot;i&#039;m disabled and I&#039;d like to sit there.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh - okay and I got up.&nbsp; By looking at him - you never would have known that he was disabled - but as he tried to maneuver into the seat in such a packed area it was pretty apparent.&nbsp; In the meantime the guy sitting next to me (closer to the disabled guy) continued to look down and didn&#039;t acknowledge anything going on around him.&nbsp; Meanwhile this disabled man had to climb over clueless guy all the while hanging on to the pole to help ease himself down into the seat - I offered to help while not being sure what more I could offer - but disabled guy said he was okay, and he thanked me.&nbsp; Clueless guy - still clueless. <br /><br />Just wanted to share.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a guy who really needed a seat - I&quot;m sure he&#039;s used to asking - I wonder how often people just ignore (or don&#039;t hear) him.&nbsp; I wonder how loud he would get if I didn&#039;t hear him when I did. <br /><br />ALso I noticed that I think the people heading to queens from 59th st have gotten nastier and more aggressive this year.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Speaking of stories...<br /><br />I was on a packed 6 train during morning rush hour--like smooshed to the door packed--and once the doors opened at 51st st. I got out and moved to the side of the door to let others off (like a good subway rider should!). Well, there was a man standing there who would NOT move back to actually let me get out of the way of the open door. I had no where to go and kept getting pushed by the flood of people and thus kept getting pushed back into him. So instead of moving out of the way, he--with BOTH hands--SHOVES me (5&#039;1 petite lady) into the flood of people more. <br /><br />Shocked, I turned around and, in front of many, many people, said (loudly) &quot;Excuse Me!&quot; Of course he yelled back saying it was my fault b/c I was bumping into him. So I said, still loudly,&nbsp; &quot;You don&#039;t push people like that! move back to let the people off and don&#039;t you DARE put your hands on me!&quot; <br /><br />Perhaps I created a bit of a scene, but good b/c now everyone could see this rude man pushing a lady! I mean, pushing anyone like that is inappropriate unless you are playing hockey!<br /><br />I was all riled up about it all day though. I couldn&#039;t believe it.

				I had a good end seat this morning, but the trip was ruined by these two very short ladies.&nbsp; They couldn&#039;t reach the bar above the seats, so they had to share the lower pole next to my seat.&nbsp; The thing was, they clearly didn&#039;t know about personal space.&nbsp; Now I normally don&#039;t care if someone is close to me if the subway was crowded, but it&#039;s just weird when it is not, which was it was this morning.<br /><br />So anyway, they are standing WAY too close to me.&nbsp; Like, one of their stomachs was in my face.&nbsp; She could take two steps back.&nbsp; They begin having a conversation right over my head because one of them is leaning against the door while the other one is hanging onto the pole.&nbsp; Then the one leaning against the door rests her hands on the small bar right next to my head, so her hands are REALLY close to my head.&nbsp; AND SHE BEGINS PICKING HER NAILS!&nbsp; I turn to her and gave her a shocked look and she quickly pulled back.&nbsp; Then when I got up for my stop, I turn to her and her hands are back, VERY close to my head!&nbsp; Like I turned and I had a hand right next to my eye.&nbsp; She pulled back again.&nbsp; Jeez, how could some people be so unaware of that?

				Even when I&#039;m not trying to read, loud conversations can be a bit frustrating, though I&#039;ve never shushed anyone (and don&#039;t think it&#039;s polite to do so).&nbsp; I always wonder if conversations in another language (especially the loud ones) are as inane as some of the ones you hear in English.&nbsp; Sounds like an amusing situation though!

				On Friday night, I was waiting for the N/W at 57th and 7th, and two men shoved me out of the way just as the train arrived, so that they could grab the two last seats. &nbsp;I would have fallen over if someone with far better manners hadn&#039;t grabbed me. &nbsp;Oh yeah...and I&#039;m HUGELY pregnant. &nbsp;I walked on the train and the car was full of young guys, and not a single one offered me his seat, even though I made eye contact with several. &nbsp;I don&#039;t even accept most of the offers I get for people&#039;s seats, because if I&#039;m not having a bad day, I can stand for a few stops until one is vacated. &nbsp;But it absolutely stuns me that at least 20 able-bodied passengers are too lazy to even offer.

				I can&#039;t believe I didn&#039;t post this here last week! <br /><br />I got on the N at Canal Thursday night and sat down when I was assaulted by the smell of garlic. It was almost like inhaling a pickle. I was all WTF? Then I realized that this middle aged woman diagonally across from me was PEELING CLOVES OF GARLIC on the train. She had two bags. She would take bulbs of garlic from one bag, pull a clove from it, peel it with a paring knife and then deposit the finished product into another bag. She did this over and over again. <br /><br />By the time we hit Union Square she had done like five or six, at which point I moved to a different car. Again, WTF. Food prep on the train? :yuck: How can anyone think this is acceptable (or hygenic)? <br /><br />The kicker is that she had surgical gloves on while she was working, presumably to keep the smell off of her hands. Gee, if the smell of garlic on your hands is distasteful to you, maybe the 35+ people traveling with you don&#039;t want the train car to smell like it either.<br />

				So, on Sunday, as the doors were closing in my subway car, a family with three kids just managed to make the train.&nbsp; They had two boys about the same age (four or five) and a baby boy in a HUGE stroller that took up way too much space.<br /><br />The two older kids begin walking around the train, grabbing onto people&#039;s pants for balance.&nbsp; The father and mother just stood there.&nbsp; Imagine how you would feel if a tiny kid suddenly grabbed your thigh muscle and just kept walking?&nbsp; I would think he was pickpocketing me.<br /><br />Anyway, the baby in the stroller began to cry.&nbsp; The mother takes him out, she sits in the stroller (it was that big) and she whips out her breast!&nbsp; Full view!&nbsp; She begins feeding the baby and the entire train saw the whole thing.&nbsp; Normally breast feeding doesn&#039;t bother me, but it just seemed faux pas to do that on a crowded subway.

				The other day I was heading into Manhattan and sat down in one of the two-seaters at the end of the new subway cars. I sit on the left side of the seat because it appears the seat on the right may be a bit dirty. I wasn&#039;t wearing a long coat and didn&#039;t want to risk getting dirty on my way in to the office. I&#039;m reading my Metro and minding my own business, until we get to Queensboro Plaza. At that point, a woman gets on the train and comes and stands in front of me. The seat next to me is still open, but she looks down at me and very rudely tells me to move over. She is wearing a long raincoat, but somehow feels that I am the one that deserves to sit in the dirty seat even though I was there first and there are OTHER OPEN SEATS available on the train just a few steps away. I was totally baffled by this behavior and sense of entitlement.

				Oh, I moved. I moved about a centimeter closer to the bar on my side of the seat to make it clear I wasn&#039;t going to be sliding all the way over. And then I apologized like I thought I had been taking up too much of the other seat as well and went back to my paper.

				Good for you Jenriet!<br /><br />I sat across from a guy tonight who decided to leave his guitar and bag on the seat next to him, despite three folks standing near him glaring at him and looking longingly at the seat.&nbsp; I do wonder if it&#039;s general cluelessness that causes that sort of behavior or just wanting more space - a feeling of self entitlement.&nbsp; Weird.&nbsp; He finally did move over, but the dirty looks definitely seemed to have no impact on him.

				Both of those things annoy me a lot too.<br />On one hand, subway seats are not storage space, particularly on a crowded train.

				&nbsp; In a similar vein, this a.m. I got on the train and made a beeline for the empty seats toward the front of the car only to find that there was a reason they were empty. At the very front of the car, in the two-seaters, was a homeless guy surrounded by full trash bags, which were also partially blocking the entrance. <br /><br />I just tried not to breathe.

				I hope the following doesn&#039;t come out like too harshly but I am bothered by the argument some have offered here about not glaring and why not just ask for the seat.<br /><br />I&#039;ve learned in recent times that ignorance is no excuse for a lot of things in life. If I&#039;ve heard correctly, people can be ticketed for occupying more than one sit with packages etc. So I&#039;d think that information might find it&#039;s way to a fair number of riders. At least the adults who ride the train.<br /><br />This train is a public space. We&#039;re all paying for it in some way or another. I&#039;m a native New Yorker and a homegrown Astorian and I&#039;m fully aware of the circumstances that would make someone occupy more space than they need on the train. I understand and accept mental disabilities or other handicaps as a reason. But as stated before, there are a sickening number of people in New York who have an insane amount of self entitlement and expect others to ASK for a seat or worse yet the seat hoggers get offended that another rider asks for some space.<br /><br />In my head I can only think &quot;Get a clue&quot; and have some courtesy for fellow passengers. I&#039;ll have all the space in the world on the train some times and the moment I know we&#039;re hitting a stop I further prepare myself for anyone who needs the space. On the N/Ws, the new ones that have a bar in the middle of the long row you can fit three adults on either side of the bar. I know this and I take it into account when I occupy a seat.<br /><br />Don&#039;t expect people to have to ask for some space. Be aware of your surroundings and know that you should share the space REGARDLESS of whether someone speaks about it or not. These people who sit there taking up two seats, with legs spread out or packages while others stand by deserve to be glared at.<br /><br />I remember seeing to young guys in suits on a ride home from work I assume, Ditmars bound. Crowded train. One of them took up two seats practically lounging, legs akimbo like nothing mattered and no one on the train existed except for his friend. WTF I thought. He was talking loud and acting hard. You mean to say someone has to deal with this guy to get a seat where you&#039;ll either be turned away or have to deal with being next to him for however many stops? Ridiculous.

				danootz, you&#039;re preaching to the choir. We can all be pissed at the people who do this, but unfortunately, unless they read this board and see themselves in the board complaints, they aren&#039;t going to change. What I do in these situations is not ask someone to close their legs or move their crap; I just go to sit wherever it is, and it&#039;s up to them to move out of the way before I sit on them or their crap. They always do move it once they see I&#039;m in the process of sitting down.

				The reason I believe that people don&#039;t &quot;just ask&quot;, is that a lot of people don&#039;t want to deal with a potential public confrontation. &nbsp;I&#039;ve seen people flip out on more than one occasion, and sometimes it has ended violently. &nbsp;Some of us are less assertive when it comes to seats, or even asking someone to turn down the music (I fear for a whole generation of people with tinnitus in their future).<br /><br />These days, if I see what looks like a space, I politely say &quot;excuse me&quot; and sit down. &nbsp;It was harder when I was using a cane, for some reason. &nbsp;My suspicion is that it was because I was already feeling self conscious, and didn&#039;t want to bring more attention to myself. &nbsp;My issue, I know. &nbsp;<br /><br />These days, I look up and around much more and give up my seat more often to pregnant women, parents with children, and the disabled (including those with canes). &nbsp;When I&#039;m alert and paying attention, it feels good to help in this way.

				Goldfish, people often don&#039;t stand up for themselves because they feel an outburst would be inappropriate in a public environment. If a creep is touching you or making unwelcome advances to you, you should respond loudly, or perhaps stand up and remove yourself from the situation.

				Kathyjean - It was one of the trains with the time display.<br /><br />AlexNYC - The only thing really inappropriate about this touching was its prolonged nature.&nbsp; If he hadn&#039;t backed off, or had touched anything besides my shoulder, I would have handled it differently.&nbsp; I was bigger than this guy. :)&nbsp; Really more stunned than scared - it was just so far outside the norm of accepted touching in our society.<br /><br />Part of it is also that I&#039;ve been losing weight, and am still adjusting to being back on the radar for creeps.&nbsp; In the past, I was invisible to most of them.

				So from that day on, you decided to ride your motorcycle instead of the train, making a point of revving it loudly and drag-racing on your way to the mid-eastern music festival (complete with fireworks) that was going on after midnight in the park.<br /><br />Only problem was a dangerous homeless person approached you, and when you swerved, you ended up on the sidewalk, plowing into Cadillac Man&#039;s pile of stuff, which scattered all over the street, breaking some car windows, and an innocent homeowner was fined for the pile of &quot;trash.&quot; Cockroaches then moved into the debris, causing panic among more innocent homeowners.<br /><br />No longer wanting to eat in their roach-infested kitchens, they researched where to find the best pizza, but riots ensued. Instead, they brought their babies into nice restaurants with them, and more riots ensued when the babies disturbed the child-hating patrons. So they got on line for the Beer Garden, but didn&#039;t like dealing with the frat boy crowd, and headed over to Studio Square.<br /><br />After putting the kids to sleep with beer in their bottles, they returned home to their bedbug-infested beds, falling asleep while reading the Cadillac Man&#039;s new book.<br /><br /><br />

Then I saw that she was picking her teeth with her thumbnail and making sucking sounds as she picked, or something - I tried not to look straight at her so this was seen through peripheral vision. At one point she did something with her ring, and the way it appeared to me was that maybe she was sucking on her ring for a while, like to clean it or something like that.

				Re: wanting to sit when you see someone taking up more than one seat...<br /><br />If I want to sit down, and someone has their bag(s) taking up a seat, I always just ask politely with a smile. No one has ever given me an issue about it. <br />However, I got an unusual response last week... <br /><br />It was evening rush hour (probably 6:00-ish), and I got on a W at 23rd St. There was one unoccupied seat, which was being taken up by a guy&#039;s plastic shopping bag, which he was holding onto. So I went over, gestured to the seat, and said &quot;excuse me, may I sit?&quot;. Guy took his headphones off because he didn&#039;t hear me, so I politely repeated myself. His response: &quot;I&#039;ll let you sit if you tell me where you&#039;re from&quot;. I was in no mood, so I rolled my eyes, said &quot;ok, buddy&quot;, turned and stood across the way until another seat opened up down the car a couple stops later. <br /><br />Cheesy pickup line, or ploy to hog 2 seats? If it was the latter, it worked&nbsp; :roll:

				I have to share this story.<br /><br />My wife is 34 weeks pregnant, so she&#039;s big and obvious.&nbsp; It&#039;s split about 50/50 if people will offer her a seat, and it is usually women who do so.&nbsp; So it was not entirely surprising that on Saturday as we were on our way home, no one offered her a seat.&nbsp; <br /><br />But here is the thing.&nbsp; The guy we were standing RIGHT IN FRONT OF from 5th Avenue/59th street through 39th Avenue was reading a book called &quot;The Modern Gentleman&quot; aloud to his girlfriend as they commented on all of the various things that he does showing how much of a &quot;Gentleman&quot; he is and how he does this or that for various people.&nbsp; At one point the guy even got up to look at the subway map, leaving his bag on his seat to hold it for him.<br /><br />My wife is a bit shy, and I was busting up laughing, which made her even more shy, so she wouldn&#039;t let me say anything to him.&nbsp; But I had to share this story.<br /><br />

				I think the 2 year-old should be allowed a seat. That said, the parent should keep their young child from touching other people sitting around them. I do not like random child hands on me (or random adult hands, for that matter). I tend to try to avoid sitting next to little kids because they are often all over the place, standing on the seat, etc.

				Kids should get to sit in a seat.&nbsp; That said - a parent knows their child and if a parent is polite and they see someone who seems to need a seat more than their child they should move the child to the lap IF the child will sit there calmly.&nbsp; If you child won&#039;t sit on your lap and the person isn&#039;t elderly, disabled, obviously pregnant or doesn&#039;t tell you she has some reason she needs to sit - they I think saying &quot;no&quot; is fine.&nbsp; <br /><br />as far as the small enough to ride for free slogan.... it&#039;s great - but only if you have a kid who will sit on your knee.&nbsp; <br />

				Thanks all for your comments!<br />It seems we all pretty much feel the same way.&nbsp; I was astonished that someone actually asked me to take daughter out of her seat, but at the same time I do understand the sit on your knee if you&#039;re free idea.&nbsp; I do wish that she would sit on my knee, but of course at this age I wish she would do a lot of things she is a long way from doing.&nbsp; She loves sitting in her seat on the train!&nbsp; And it&#039;s all I can do to keep her from running all around the train car.&nbsp; (which is what she really wants to do but is not aloud as she will go flying!)<br />For now I will decide how to react depending on how confrontational I am feeling.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; &nbsp;(whether I say no or just stand up)&nbsp; At this point I don&#039;t even try the lap thing, the flailing screaming child on a moving train is hard for me to handle.&nbsp; Ha!

				After two fun experiences this morning, my sense of subway frustration is high again.&nbsp; <br /><br />It is important for groups to speak as loudly as possible on the trains, especially during the morning commute.&nbsp; You should work to pitch your volume loud enough to ensure everyone on the car gets to share your conversation, especially if you have a really unique and grating voice.&nbsp; Folks may look annoyed, but they&#039;re secretly enjoying getting to share in the back and forth.

				After 25 years riding the N,R,B,RR or whatever- You tend to at least try and tune out the discussions, phone calls and arguments about vaginal warts, STD&#039;s, husband&#039;s (and wive&#039;s) &quot;inadequacies&quot; and &quot;shortfalls&quot; in the bedroom, etc... These people wouldn&#039;t discuss some of this stuff with their mothers, but they&#039;ll let 50 total strangers know that the Doctor gave her a prescription for her yeast infection...

				One of my favorites is when I&#039;m riding the train w/my boyfriend. He&#039;s from South America, but doesn&#039;t look Latino - he&#039;s often<br />mistaken for Italian. Anyway, we usually end up overhearing conversations between women speaking Spanish and they figure<br />that other people don&#039;t understand them. But thanks to my trusty translator, I get the scoop on people&#039;s extra-marital affairs, how<br />good or bad the sex was last night, anatomy size comparisons (I&#039;ll leave it at that, no details), etc.<br /><br />Things always sound more interesting in another language!<br />

				I can&#039;t stand it when women apply makeup on the subway.&nbsp; Can&#039;t they just wait to get to where they&#039;re going?&nbsp; Some of them use powder and that stuff gets all over the place.&nbsp; And they most often times are juggling everything like their purses or makeup cases on their lap, if that train stops, everything is falling to the floor.&nbsp; <br /><br />The subway is a mode of transportation to get you from Point A and B not your personal makeup counter.<br /><br />Let me note the stench in a subway car when a homeless person is camped out in them.&nbsp; Why don&#039;t police officers every do anything about them?&nbsp; I would get on the train at the Ditmars stop and an entire car is empty because there&#039;s a homeless person inside.&nbsp; Yet, there&#039;s a cop standing right outside and just watching people as they just go to the next car.&nbsp; I guess its a person&#039;s choice if they want to deal with the smell or not.

				How about we all agree no one calls it &quot;the subway&quot;. No NYers call it that. ALthough you would be hard pressed to find a NYer in Astoria these days.

				Actually you can get a ticket for having any other drink than water on the train .&nbsp; You can burn someone with coffee and spilled soda attracts all types from roaches to rats .&nbsp; No reason to be drinking soda anyways&nbsp; esp on the train .

				My old job used to hand out sporting and theater tickets regularly. One year my boss have me a pair&nbsp; world series tickets about five rows behind home plate at Yankee stadium. I hate baseball but I couldn&#039;t say no so I took the tickets. On my way home I&#039;m on a crowded train and there is this guy sitting on the seam between two seats with a cheek on each one. I asked him to slide over so I could sit and he ignored me. I asked again and he have me a dirty look and still didn&#039;t move. I was about to get nasty when this guy sitting in front says not to worry about assholes, that he was getting off at the next stop and I could have his seat.&nbsp; I said thanks, sat down and asked him whether he liked baseball.&nbsp; He said yes and I gave him the tickets. The asshole who wouldn&#039;t move just sat there with his mouth hanging open.

				When is it (or is it) ever acceptable to take your bike on the subway?&nbsp; I&#039;ve wondered that a lot myself.<br /><br /><br />http://gothamist.com/2013/03/22/subway_bike_etiquette.php (http://gothamist.com/2013/03/22/subway_bike_etiquette.php)<br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t get why folks bring their bikes on the train - isn&#039;t the purpose of having the bike to be riding it?

				Maybe they bring the bikes into the train cars because the route they need to use is not good for bikes so that&#039;s why the train is a better option.<br />But they want to use the bikes sometime during the day? I find it annoying a little bit but what can I do? It&#039;s none of my business. Now if the bike is blocking an empty seat I want to sit in, then I might politely ask the owner of the bike to move it out of my way so I can sit. <br /><br />There are things I see on these subways that irk me serious. Like when people put their stuff on an empty seat and won&#039;t move it for someone to sit. I just move their junk myself! That&#039;s all. They can have a hissy fit all they want.

				I also hate when people put their feet up on seats and leave dirt from their shoes on them afterwards.&nbsp; Then it further bugs me when people come in with a brood of kids taking up seats, particularly during rush hour, and you know darn well they let each one go under the turnstile.&nbsp; (In the 1960s, there actually was a sign on the trains that said &quot;little enough to ride for free, little enough to ride your knee.&quot;)

				I push the bag until it&#039;s no longer in my way and maybe say excuse me. If it happens again I would push the bag away and if they guy doesn&#039;t like the dirty look I am giving him at the point I would point to him and say &quot;Control your **it.&quot;

				Depends on if you are physically imposing enough to make people know you&#039;re serious and also willing to back it up if need be. I am. Not to sound like someone that goes out looking for trouble, but I will always stand up for myself, even if it means that I&#039;ll ultimately lose a fight.
