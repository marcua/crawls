				Does anyone know of a good auto glass place in the area? I&#039;m gonna go google some stuff, but if anyone&#039;s had a good experience with a place in the area, please let me know, since I need this fixed asap. I left my apartment this morning and look what I found: <br /><br />(http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a80/alie354/0320071100.jpg)<br /><br />:x :x :x :x :x :x :x :x :x :x :x :x :x :x :x :x :x :x :x :x :x :x :x<br /><br />WATCH OUT! ALISON&#039;S GONNA BUST SOME HEADS!<br /><br />Oooh, there&#039;s one a block from me (http://www.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=s&amp;q=auto+glass&amp;near=11105&amp;radius=0.0&amp;cid=40776270,-73910965,4407032367992768314&amp;li=lmd&amp;z=14&amp;t=m). Anyone ever use them?

				Ouch!<br /><br />I think we used the place in your link a few months ago to have our windshield replaced.&#160; They did a great job, were fast and reasonable.&#160; Cash only, though. <br /><br />ETA:&nbsp; The place we used fronted around the corner on 20th Ave, but it was just a few steps west of Steinway.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to try to find out if it is the same place.

(I&#039;m glad I opted for the extra glass coverage! I almost didn&#039;t.) If there are any issues, I found another one on Astoria Blvd. that has a couple good reviews online. I&#039;d just rather use the closer one because I&#039;m not gonna drive it like this and I don&#039;t want to pay for a tow.<br /><br />Thanks lanseaux, I&#039;m gonna go take a walk up there now.

				Ok, since I&#039;m just sitting around waiting for the glass guy to call me back (he&#039;s out now, he&#039;s gonna call me when he gets back to the shop), I&#039;ll tell you another strange thing about this - there was a set of apartment keys (not mine) on the roof of my car. Just two keys on a keyring.<br /><br />The only POSSIBLE explanation I can think of is that maybe an angry ex thought it was their ex&#039;s car (or maybe the car of someone their ex is cheating with), and they smashed the windshield and left the keys to the ex&#039;s apartment? I have no idea. And no, no one that I know of is mad at me, and I&#039;m not involved with anyone (on any level).<br /><br />Also, is this something I should report to the police? Because if someone thinks the car belongs to someone else and keeps doing this...well, that would stink.<br /><br />I&#039;m so pissed that I have to miss my favorite class to deal with this.

				I would suggest reporting it to the police just so they have a record of it.<br /><br />That&#039;s funny about the keys.&nbsp; A few years ago a friend of mine had her car broken into on 29th Street between Ditmars and 21st Ave. The thing that was funny is that they numbskulls left a receipt from the Home Depot in her car by accident where they had used a credit card to pay for the crobar they used to break in.&nbsp; Obviously, it didn&#039;t take long to track them down and make an arrest!<br /><br />Hope that lightens your day a bit!

I love stories like that. Ha!<br /><br />I called the police, and they came out and did a report. Funny: when the police showed up to take my report showed up, there were 2 traffic cop cars giving a guy parked in the bus stop a ticket, so they were all standing around listening to my stupid theory about a jealous ex. Ha! It was like a fun little segment on COPS: Astoria here for a couple minutes. Also, my ex-roomie tells me she&#039;s seen another green Corolla in the neighborhood (I never noticed one), so that gives me even more reason to believe that its something scandalous! Nosy Alison MUST find out! (And put an end to this - I&#039;m thinking of getting something like this (http://www.bigboygraffix2.com/catalog/popup_image.php?pID=121&amp;osCsid=3be5cf70280dd14233bfbb48ed6507b1) that says &quot;Alison&quot; so they won&#039;t mistake my car for someone else&#039;s again. Cheesy, but if it&#039;ll keep me from having another day like today, then I&#039;ll go for it.)<br /><br />Also, if anyone sees a green Corolla near Stwinway &amp; 21st Ave that does not have a &quot;School of Visual Arts&quot; sticker in the back window, let me know. I want to leave a note on it that says, &quot;dude, if someone&#039;s mad at you, tell them they have the wrong effing car.&quot; Dumb idea? Probably, but whatever.<br /><br />My car is still sitting out there, the glass guy is coming at 4, and I just (a little while ago) had to go out and babysit it because the Jr High at 21st Ave &amp; 37th Street let out, and all the kids swarm that corner for the deli and bus stop. I totally yelled at a couple of kids (SERIOUSLY, DON&#039;T TOUCH THE BROKEN GLASS, KIDS), and now I fear that I&#039;m the crochety old lady in the hood (I&#039;m only 28, but STILL). For those who I will see tonight at EATS, remind me to show/tell you what I did...it amused me, if only for a minute or two.

				AWESOME about the babysitting the car - I would do the same thing if I had a car to babysit!<br /><br />Hope that everything gets fixed with no problems!

				Ok, for future reference if anyone needs it -<br /><br />Now that I have my car back, I can heartily reccomend the auto glass place I (and lanseaux, awhile back) used. They came and got my car because I didn&#039;t want to drive it (I was afraid the windshield would collapse in on me), and while I didn&#039;t pick it up the next day because I had class all day, it was ready early the next day. He also quoted me a really good price, although when I mentioned that it was going to go through my insurance, there was no hassle at all. I just had to call Geico with their phone number and it was taken care of.<br /><br />Here is their info:<br /><br />Quality Auto Glass<br />20-02 Steinway Street (door is around the corner on 20th Ave, black &amp; yellow awning)<br />718-204-7227
