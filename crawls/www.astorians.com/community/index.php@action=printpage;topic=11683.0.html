				Hello,<br /><br />I&#039;m going to northern California in a couple of weeks for a good friend&#039;s wedding.&nbsp; I&#039;m really excited because I&#039;ve never been there and it is my first real vacation in a long time.&nbsp; In order to get around I had to rent a car.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t driven since my last move in February of 2007 and that was just on local roads.&nbsp; Three years ago, I drove to Lancaster and Allentown and had no problems adjusting, as the last time I drove before that was in Minnesota in 2002.&nbsp; <br /><br />All that being said, I&#039;m a little anxious about driving in an area that I&#039;ve never been to.&nbsp; I&#039;m a fairly good driver, but I have absolutely no idea what it&#039;s going to like out there.&nbsp; I should note that I drove in NYC a lot for a few years while I was going back and forth from Purchase College in the mid-90&#039;s and then as a city employee from &#039;99 to 2002.&nbsp; <br /><br />Does anyone know what driving is like out there?&nbsp; I don&#039;t plan on driving into San Francisco.&nbsp; A group of us are actually going to drive to the nearest BART station and ride into the city.&nbsp; I do plan, however, to do a lot of night driving, mainly on the highways and busier streets.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was actually trying to find a driving simulator, like the one I used in driver&#039;s ed class about twenty years ago.&nbsp; Or I could just go to an arcade and find one of those driving games, although I probably don&#039;t want to use that as practice for the real thing.<br /><br />Whew, that was a long-winded post to basically ask two things: 1. What is driving like in the Bay Area, particular around Berkley and Oakland; and 2. Does anyone know of a driving simulator or something like that in the area.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.&nbsp; And hey, if anyone wants to let me practice with their vehicle, I&#039;m free this weekend&nbsp; &nbsp;:lol::evil:

				We&#039;ve driven in the San Francisco area -- picked up a car at the airport, drove south as far as Santa Cruz (where we got a parking ticket) and off road through the hills just north of Santa Cruz, then north through San Francisco on surface roads, over the Golden Gate, and then swung around and headed out to Sacramento and I-5.&nbsp; While the entire west coast has a different driving style to the northeast, the SF area wasn&#039;t difficult to deal with.&nbsp; In fact, around the time went, I was taking a lot of business trips to the Minneapolis area, and doing a lot of driving there as well - I don&#039;t recall anything standing out.

				SF and Sonoma are very nice to drive in. I&#039;d say the biggest difference is the steepness of some roads. Driving in the valleys north of SF are fun and fantastic. We drive out from the city to the beach each time and it&#039;s the simplest drive. SF is mostly grid and is very small. Driving gets easier and less frustrating the farther away you are from the center of it all - Market &amp; Mission. <br /><br />We always take the metro to the city from SFO and then rent a car from there. Hertz is widely available there and some cars have GPS. I&#039;m a GPS addict so I always use it to get around. <br /><br />Parking is difficult as there is minimal street parking. Most everything is garaged. It helps if you get a hotel with a small parking lot. Be prepared to pay about $25 a day.<br /><br />Believe it or not, I&#039;d say having a car is a necessity for getting around and living in SF. The metro doesn&#039;t cater to every neighborhood and walking is so not an option unless you carry Olympian calf muscles - one hill will take you out.

				I&#039;d say that if you&#039;ve driven in the metropolitan NY area than the Bay Area shouldn&#039;t be too difficult.&nbsp; I think the only difference is that some of the major highways like I-80 can widen in areas to 4 to 6&nbsp; lanes.&nbsp; But I understand the anxiety, I grew up there and I&#039;m still scared to drive in San Francisco.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather take BART in.

				I lived in the Bay Area for 9 years and drove the whole time there.&nbsp; It was pretty easy (driving stick shift makes it harder).<br /><br />I agree that if you&#039;ve driving in NYC, driving in Berkeley/Oakland is a piece of cake.&nbsp; Even driving in SF is ok, except downtown near the financial district.&nbsp; You have to deal with crazy drivers like you do in NYC, coupled with the hills.&nbsp; Not pleasant.&nbsp; <br /><br />White liners, yes - motorcycles often drive in between the lanes.&nbsp; I never had a problem with them.&nbsp; <br /><br />One thing CA does well is the length of off-ramps and on-ramps.&nbsp; They are usually nice and long and give you plenty of time to speed up to traffic, or slow down to make merging into town traffic easier.&nbsp; Enjoy.&nbsp; I swear, here in NY the traffic engineers must have gotten their degrees at K-Mart.&nbsp; On-rams and off-ramps SUCK here, and are dangerous.&nbsp; Yuck.<br /><br />I think you have nothing to worry about, actually.&nbsp; Be sure to check out the parking meters in Berkeley - Columbus Day there (which is exempt from feeding the meter) is called Indigenous People&#039;s Day.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sidebar:&nbsp; I find it interesting in CA that in southern California you say &quot;the 101&quot; and in northern CA you say just &quot;101&quot;.

				Since part two wasn&#039;t answered yet and I can&#039;t answer part one, I can tell you that Ferrari Driving school on Steinway has the simulator but I don&#039;t know the rates.<br />Good Luck! I&#039;m still terrified to drive. But that probably has more to do with learning in a tiny ferrari school car and then having to drive a Ford Explorer. I am not a fan of the Ford Explorer.

				So, I&#039;m back from the Bay Area and I have to say that it was one of the best vacations/trips I have ever had.&nbsp; Despite my own crazy anxiety about driving, in particular driving in an area that I was unfamiliar with, I didn&#039;t get into any accidents or get a moving violation.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t easy, though.&nbsp; I got lost a couple of times, well a lot, and at one point, I had to back-up into oncoming traffic on the Bay Bridge because I had missed my exit and was about to drive into San Francisco.&nbsp; Totally unrelated to actual driving in the area, I came out of my hotel to leave for Oakland Airport and could not start the car.&nbsp; The battery died.&nbsp; I called Hertz and they got a third party vendor to give me a boost within 30 minutes.&nbsp; I was then off to the airport and, of course, I got lost again.&nbsp; Fortunately, I left about three hours early based on my NYC experience with JetBlue (see below) and I got to the airport way ahead of time.<br /><br />I absolutely love San Francisco.&nbsp; I spent the entire day on Friday just walking, taking trolleys (for $11 you can ride any trolley or San Francisco bus for the day) and riding the BART.&nbsp; It was about 70 degrees in the city with a light breeze and plenty of sunshine.&nbsp; I was wearing a t-shirt, but I had brought a jacket because of what people told us about the weather in San Fran.<br /><br />Oh, and as an added bonus, I didn&#039;t even need to drive the before-mentioned car, except to get to the rehearsal dinner and the wedding.&nbsp; I was staying in Emeryville, a small town across the bay from San Francisco and bordering Berkeley.&nbsp; The town of Emeryville has a lot of big box stores that people from outside use.&nbsp; There was a bus stop right outside of our hotel.&nbsp; It was free and it was quick 15 minute drive or less to the MacArthur BART station in Oakland.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I couldn&#039;t figure out the ticket machine at the station and ended up wasting a couple of dollars.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks again for all of your suggestions.&nbsp; <br /><br />PS: A word of advice to anyone who is flying JetBlue out of JFK: Maybe it was just a particularly busy day for them, but it took almost 2 hours to get to the gate!&nbsp; &nbsp;The sheer number of passengers, along with the layout of the terminal building led to confusion and really long lines.&nbsp; There were several employees of JetBlue who were &quot;yelling&quot; directions like prison guards.&nbsp; <br /><br />Having said all of that, I would recommend flying JetBlue.&nbsp; They have a in-flight DirectTV and XM satellite radio installed. You will have to bring your own headset or buy one for $1.00.&nbsp; This entertainment was really great, considering the baby who was screaming in front of me on my flight from Oakland.

				Ha ha, I&#039;m late to this game, but I wanted to say congrats! I&#039;m a native Bay Arean and learned to drive on San Francisco&#039;s hilly streets. I loved driving there, and whenever I go home to visit my parents it&#039;s still one of the things I enjoy doing most! The roads there tend to be clearly marked, which is something roads in the NY metro area are NOT! I&#039;ve spent enough time here in NYC helping friends move and borrowing cars to get out of the city and taking cabs, and I&#039;m appalled by how poor the road signs here are. Thank goodness for NY&#039;s awesome public transportation...<br /><br />Anyway, it&#039;s great to hear you survived. A few false starts can be expected every time you go somewhere new...you were smart to give yourself lots of extra time!&nbsp; :mrgreen:<br /><br />I agree that JetBlue&#039;s great! I fly between JFK and SFO or Oakland all the time. I&#039;ve never had a problem getting though the checkpoints at JFK. I wonder if something was up at the airport the day you left?...

				Thanks, goRaina, I really had a great time.&nbsp; I have actually found myself looking up Bay Area jobs and rentals.&nbsp; Not that I would ever leave Queens, I&#039;m just curious.&nbsp; I really loved the weather and the vibe.&nbsp; I hope to get out there again.
